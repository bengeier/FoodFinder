{"text":"My family didn't enjoy any of the cupcakes we tried from here. We tried 6 different kinds and I think I'd rather have cupcakes out of a box.  I was also disappointed with the service I received. I asked the woman which were the top sellers or the best ones. She just said in a really unfriendly manner that what was there is all they had and never made a recommendation. I wouldn't of payed any attention to the crap service had anyone enjoyed them, but that's 2 strikes which leaves them with 1 star."}
{"text":"Maybe I just don't get it, but... I just don't get Pure DeLite. The cupcakes look beautiful. I mean, they look like bakery cupcakes. But every one I've had has been extremely dry, too dense and nearly flavorless. I love that they have organic and gluten free options (and if they would offer a gluten and sugar free option, I'd actually come back), but IMHO, the cupcakes just aren't good. I can make better ones in my house from scratch. 

The frosting really is tasty, though. It's light and fluffy and not too sweet. There's a lot of it, but I like frosting a lot, so that's fine with me. 

As far as the staff goes, the woman working behind the counter was borderline rude and appeared to be annoyed with us and the woman in front of us as soon as we walked in the door. Maybe we disturbed her text session with her boyfriend or something. I don't know."}
{"text":"I bought a Living Social voucher, so I got a good deal. The first cupcake I ate was Lemon Meringue. It was good. The cake was a little too dense for my liking, but it was moist. The woman behind the counter seemed to be annoyed by our asking questions. I probably won't go there in the future, but it was a nice treat."}
{"text":"I tried pure delight out when they offered a groupon I believe last year.  I personally liked the cupcakes. I love the fact that they aren't loaded with sugar and I can get vegan and gf options. Yes, are they a little \"off\" when you think of a decadent cupcake laden with sugar and more sugar...but they make it a point if not their philosophy of this shop that they are purposely half the sugar etc. so ummm yeah they aren't going to taste like your \"typical\" cupcake. So for someone to expect that is kinda silly. 
I thought they were good. The greatest healthy cupcake ever...no, I think I make a better one at home. I eat a paleo diet and I haven't had one since last year because even with less sugar it's still sugar but I might be back again on a treat day for myself. I would love though if bakeries started using almond flour and coconut and other nut flours to make baked goods. Gf is okay but it's still not healthy for you. I make coconut flour cupcakes at home and they are so moist etc and that's the problem with gf goods, so dry! So if you are in the health/good business maybe you should branch out on the baking knowledge out there and try new flours to make the cakes a bit more moist. Also adding coconut oil ( I get it it, it's expensive) makes any cake fluffier and moist and the health benefits of coconut oil pretty much are amazing. 
So yes, if you want a sorta guilt free treat and you are in the area def stop in. Like I said I mig be back and if they do branch out of gf and start using nut flours and honey or maple syrup only sweetened frosting I would buy stock in this place."}
{"text":"2.5 stars rounded up to 3 for this decent, if not underwhelming, cupcake joint. For as spacious as the place is, they had a pretty small display of bakeries on display for purchase. On Sunday evening, they had about 6-8 \"normal\" cupcake flavors available, one gluten-free flavor, and one vegan flavor. They also had 3 flavors of cake balls, two flavors of \"macarons\", and a few cupcake sized pies.

I got a caramel apple cupcake. I agree with Alan S. that the frosting to cake ratio was overwhelming. The dollop of frosting was bigger than the cupcake itself (which was kind of already small). I was worried my teeth would be in agony as soon as I took my first bite. Luckily, they held true to their self-proclaimed \"guilt-free\" products because it wasn't too sweet. In fact, they managed just the right amount of sweetness without sacrificing any flavor. The cake was a bit dry, though.

Overall, I would say it was just an OK cupcake. My girlfriend got the chocolate one and she was underwhelmed.

Some other observations: Their \"macarons\" don't pass the eye test. They're oversized, and the cookie parts aren't properly made (they're shaped more like Hershey kisses, making it almost football-shaped instead of flat in its finished form. Their cake balls weren't properly made either. The candy/chocolate coating wasn't uniform around the balls. They likely draped the coating over the balls while they rested on a pan, causing them to have a flat, exposed bottom, and no one likes an exposed bottom, much less a flat one."}
{"text":"I've tried this place a few times and frankly, save your money. In short, the cupcakes are ALWAYS dry, the cashier is ALWAYS rude and their credit card machine NEVER works."}
{"text":"Gluten free, organic, and guilt free?  I am in!

We stopped here to get a cupcake as a birthday present.  It is nice that they have small boxes for one cupcake!

They had a sign outside that advertised 20% off if you bring your own cupcake container.

I have had 4 or 5 different flavors of cupcakes from here and they all have been excellent.  Quick stop if you want to pick up a quick gift!

I want to try the coffee next time I come."}
{"text":"This place sounds like it would have been great and the variety of cupcakes is great, but they just didn't taste that great. Slightly dry and all the frosting tasted the same. I was super excited for the s'mores cupcake, but the frosting just tasted like regular sugary frosting. Kind of disappointing. I wish I would have tried the vegan cupcake, because those are hard to get right. The floor in the place was so sticky I almost tripped because my shoe wouldn't come unstuck. Yuck! 

I did use the Yelp! coupon and got 20% off which was awesome for buying a dozen cupcakes."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to try Pure DeLite, and glad I did.  If half stars were available I would have graded them at 3.5. 

What I like: cute store. They obviously took care to make it look inviting and they succeeded. Nice selection of flavors. Quality ingredients and nothing artificial. Prices seem reasonable. 

 What I think could be improved: I realize this is very subjective, but I really like frosting. But, imo these beauties have too much. WAYYYY too much. Not that it wasn't good. In the four flavors we tried all the frosting was tasty. However, there was  SO much of it we had to take some off each one so the 'cake' portion didn't get totally overwhelmed.  If they get others writing and saying the same, I might consider at least making a few varieties with maybe 25% less frosting. AND...25% more cake. Right now they strike me more as \"Cup Frostings\" versus \"Cupcakes.\"  The balance seems off to us.  If they used those proportions I could see easily giving them 4.5 or 5 stars. 

In summary,  I think Pure DeLite makes a quality product and delivers it it in a great looking store at what seem reasonable prices (for high-end cupcakes).   We'll certainly try them again."}
{"text":"I really love these cupcakes. I'm not so much into sweets, which is probably why I don't mind that these are a little dense and dry. I think that there is a perfect amount of frosting. I love the variety.
Here's why I can't give 5 stars: I completely agree that the staff here is just aloof. It's not the end of the world, but very out of place at a happy, guilt-free cupcakery. I am extremely turned off also by being charged $.75 for an extra box."}
{"text":"This 'cupcakery' recently opened in Strongsville and I went in to check them out.  They were offering a 'Grand Opening' promotion which was Buy 3, Get 1 free.  I assume it was for all of the desserts.  I chose cake balls since I specifically went in for those.  The cupcakes looked delicious, but I opted out for this visit.  They were out of a lot of choices because she stated they were so busy for their 'Grand Opening'.  That's fine since I'm there for the cake balls anyway.  Looking at the selection, they had a pretty poor presentation (stacked in a cylandar jar and sweaty) and only four different flavors.  However, I tasted two and they were delicious.  It is, I suppose, what's inside that counts.  

I can't write a legit review not having tried the cupcakes, so I will surely go back for those.  There was one particularly intriguing called 'The Glob'.  See photo for what's inside.  I also got a pumpkin latte which was good and inexpensive.  My 4 cake balls and latte were $5 and some change.
  

I'll go back and try them again.  Apparently they have a vegan and gluten free section as well.  For each dessert,  they state the calorie amount which is nice, but actually made me feel even a little more guilty.  Ignorance is bliss."}
{"text":"I went here wholly understanding that these were \"diet-friendly\" cupcakes, so I did not expect the grandest of tastes. However, my overall experience with Pure Delite was purely substandard.  Most of the cupcakes I tried were dry and had a strange after-taste. Everyone has mentioned the word \"dense.\" That's the perfect words to describe the cupcakes. They aren't going to melt in your mouth one bit. They load the frosting on each cupcake, and it is not needed. All the frosting tastes the same. Getting a salted-caramel cupcake? That frosting is going to taste the same as the frosting on the cherry or s'mores variety. Really, it's not bad frosting...but, it's standard buttercream.

When I think about a gourmet cupcake, I'm thinking something a little larger than your normal cupcake. These are the size of the cupcakes you bake at home from the boxed mix. I know they're going for the healthy thing, but c'mon...I could make these at home. (And I'm not being cocky; I really could.) 200 calories for an averaged-sized cupcake is pretty standard without that funky diet-ish aftertaste. 

The only redeeming quality about Pure Delight is their vegan cupcakes. They're actually pretty good. If you're into that kind of thing, that'd be a great option. The vegan cupcakes were more moist than our dense, non-vegan ones. But, $28 for a box of barely passable bakery treats is way too much for me to ever spend again."}
{"text":"Lately I have been on a hunt for French Macarons in my area and after reading some reviews about how this place occasionally has them, I thought I'd check it out. I didn't expect much from how bad some of the reviews are so I didn't go in with high hopes. But I was actually very disappointed, it's worse than I thought. First of all the address listed is wrong. It took me a bit to find the actual location. Once I got inside I thought the place is actually pretty nice, definitely more of a coffee shop feel to it. Anyways, I was surprised at how small the display of cupcakes was. There was probably only about 5 different flavors and maybe 4 of each one. Not to mention they did not have the macarons I was looking for, and the couple other pastries they did have were all smooshed in the bottom of a small jar. So as I was looking at everything I would have thought somebody would have come to the counter. But nope, I stood there for probably 15 minutes wondering if they were even open. I wasn't too impressed with their display anyways so I walked out without even trying a cupcake. I probably won't be back here for awhile."}
{"text":"not sure why there are so many low reviews here. I think the cupcakes are great (name a better cupcake place in strongsville). not only are they great but they are organic and lower fat/calories. I love all the peanut butter chocolate choices. shared with several family members and all gave a thumbs up and i eat sweets all the time so i know my stuff here."}
