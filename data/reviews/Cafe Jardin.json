{"text":"Stopped here for lunch on our holiday to Scarborough. Just wanted to find somewhere to stop for food and couldn't have picked a better place. Nice relaxed cafe and friendly staff. Good choice of food on the menu and the specials sounded great. We were not disappointed as the food we ordered was fantastic. Got a kids pack for our son and comes with loads of cool stuff for the kids. Glad we stopped here and will make a point of going back. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"nice food and pleasing surroundings. service was ok but not to friendly. generally a nice place."}
{"text":"Certainly one of the better cafes which Scarborough town centre has to offer, I frequently stop by for a drink when I;m out and about, and usually make time to have a meal once in a while.


 Theres a small outdoor seating area, which is basically just a sectioned off area on the high street, but the inside is much bigger than you'd expect - its three levels, so theres usually plenty of room even in the busiest periods, and the seating varies from the standard chairs to the more comfortable leather sofas.


 Theres a wide range of food ion the menu or the daily specials board, from sandwiches and cakes to full meals. the food is unpretentious and very nice. Prices are reasonable and waitress service is attentive and friendly without being intrusive.


 Coffees are a step above the usual standard of seaside cafe coffee, and you never feel rushed when you're in there. Highly recommended and one of Scarboroughs better cafes."}
{"text":"Best Cafe in Scarborough. All homemade food. Kids made really welcome, comfy sofas upstairs.
The coffee is Excellent and I haven't had a bad one yet.
Both the specials and the menu are excellent and the specials change regularly. We always feel we get value for money and quality food. 
You can't beat it.
The children are accommodated and they do a great kiddy bag which is really good value at Â£3.95 it's got loads in it. 
You can have a lovely meal and won't feel ripped off.
The staff are all really friendly and nothing is ever too much trouble. 
We like it cos its kept spotlessly clean too. 
They have started to offer a gluten free menu too which is great as my mum is a coeliac. She loves their gluten free lasagne."}
{"text":"friendly and very tasty food."}
{"text":"I frequently visit the Cafe Jardin, it has a lovely atmosphere and has started opening late into the evening now which I have yet to try out. However, it's a great place to stop for a biteand their homemade coleslaw is gorgeous! Plenty of seating and its waitress service. The staff are pleasant, never had a bad experience there and would recommend it to anyone. If I had visitors coming to see me here in Scarborough and I wanted to take them for somewhere nice to eat and make a good impression of the town then this is where I would come every time!"}
