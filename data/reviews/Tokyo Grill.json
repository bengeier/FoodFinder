{"text":"I have been coming here about once every month or two for at least 5 years.   I always order the chicken katsu which was initially introduced to me by several Japanese people I know. It is a tender piece of breast meat (I think they brine it cause I have no idea why it's always so tender and juicy) perfectly breaded in panko and fried to golden brown perfection.  It is served with a simple iceberg lettuce salad with a nice dressing, and miso soup.  About the miso soup - it is one of the best I've had in the city.  There are always so many pieces of tofu and super thin slices of green onion in a rich broth that is well balanced between dashi stock and miso paste.  There are too many places to name in Toronto where a piece of toasted seaweed is submerged in an awful bowl of slimy liquid which is supposed to wet your appetite.   I can't speak for the other options on the menu.  Just stick with chicken katsu, you won't be disappointed.   Update: I came here recently and the place was looking a little dirtier than normal. The owner needs to paint/clean up a little as the interior is looking tired and dingy."}
{"text":"I saw the review on Yelp, and decided to dinner out since I miss Japanese style curry with Katsu.  I almost missed it, such a small place. I had Katsu curry, Katsu is really good crispy outside, and tender inside. the plate is huge, and using good short rice. but the curry is too much, not in the right proportion to the size of Katsu. the Katsu curry came with a small salad as well.  overall, I think it is a nice but average place. the menu option is very limited, the cooking is home made style which mean wont give you surprise, both in good and bad way."}
{"text":"I go there occasionally for their Katsu curry rice. Seats are narrow inside and my Japanese friend once told me Japanese like to eat at restaurants of small space. The food comes in a big portion. The waiters and waitresses are nice but communication with them in English is somewhat difficult. Good place to go when you are eating alone or too tired to find another restaurant. Lol"}
{"text":"Really good pork katsu curry.. used to have more meat in the curry though.  Would not recommend the ramen here, but the katsu curry or dons are definitely authentic.  Great place for a quick bite for lunch. =)"}
{"text":"It's pretty good but I believe they changed owners recently and have modified the menu slightly. It's still a regular haunt for me as the staff are friendly and the is consistent.   It's nothing spectacular but makes for a good, quick lunch for sure.  It's wheelchair accessible as there is no step to get in the door but the washrooms are in the basement."}
{"text":"I always get the Katsu curry rice. The curry is not too spicy, and I always feel very full after eating the large portions. Sometimes I get an extra half cut of katsu. While this might not be the best curry in the world, I keep coming back, and the food remains consistent. Also, there's other foods such as ramen, teriyaki etc. to keep me satisfied."}
{"text":"Heard a few good reviews from elsewhere and decided to give this chicken katsu curry a try.  It was not spectacular.  There's nothing bad about it, but there's also nothing good about it.  The curry tasted exactly like the ones you can make using those japanese curry cubes, and just add your own vege and meats.  For $10.95, i'd say it's way overpriced.  The portion is huge though, and comes with a side salad.  Also, this place is CASH ONLY.  The guy who gave 5 stars is insane. The rating is 'As good as it gets'.  REALLY?   I've had better."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for lunch.    If your idea of Japanese food is raw fish, you need to check this place out.  There is not one raw fish on the menu.  The closest you will get to \"raw\" is their fermented soya beans, natto, which, I would recommend everyone try at least once with raw egg.  I happen to love the taste of natto and raw egg - the dark flavour of the soya beans (almost like coffee) and the gooiness of the raw egg.  Yum.  If you're on a budget (or trying to lose weight), you can eat it with rice and make it a nutritious and filling meal.  Otherwise, order it as an appetizer.  If you haven't acquired the taste of natto, not to fear, there are many delicious items on the menu.  My personal favorite is their tofu steak, or wait maybe it's the oyako don, or maybe the Tsukimi udon, or maybe the sukiyaki, or the chicken katsu curry on rice... Can you tell I love this place?  The katsu is deep fried and yet the meat still retains its yummy juiciness.  The tofu steak is wonderful, wrapped in egg and served with a large salad.  The oyako don should be renamed comfort-don.  The sukiyaki is a real steal.  And a meal for two could easily be had for less than $30 including tax and tip - what's not to like about this place?    The only downside is that on a busy weekend lunch period, service may be slow because of the lack of wait staff.  The service is friendly, although better training might make things run more efficiently.    A great little place in a seedy downtown area.  Cash only so don't get caught with only plastic in your pocket."}
{"text":"Very small restaurant haha  Great food, katsu don is my favourite as well as a few other items  Don't bother complaining about the ambiance the food is all you need to focus on"}
{"text":"They have lunch specials, to compete with everyone else during the weekday lunch rush. I have tried two of their lunch special menu items.   For around $9, you can get half-serving of katsu curry. You literally get half a cutlet and some curry. Cutlet was nothing special. I'm not one of those people who over-lace their rice with curry, and I still ran out of curry. I didn't feel like I was eating a lunch special, just a half serving of something that should never be a half serving. I noticed that other people who had ordered the katsu curry had just ordered the full serving of it, and I knew why after my food arrived. If you want katsu curry for lunch here, go ahead and order the full portion. Curry was nothing spectacular. Tasted like what one could make with packaged Japanese curry by adding some potatoes and other vegetables, didn't taste what could make it \"house curry\" as they boasted.  For $6, you can get udon with some meat. Their udon was pretty good. Warm and filing, would be good for a cold day. On the salty side, but that's typical of Japanese cuisine. Service is very good, and always very polite."}
{"text":"ordered sukiyaki bc i read a lot of raves on here, couldn't even finish it!  It was pretty pathetic!  Honestly, who the hell puts bean sprouts in sukiyaki?  Cheap, cheap, cheap filler.  The beef was not the proper cut, and i seriously doubt it was even graded!  Was tough like shoe leather, omg!  Hot water is poured into the boilermaker to make green tea?  Are you f@#king kidding me?  Hot water is non potable!  Omfg!!!  No wonder it tasted like sewer water!  What a waste of time~never again!   Go to cafe michi for proper sukiyaki, (same price) but your stomach will love you for it!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a cute, no-nonsense Japanese meal, Tokyo Grill is a great place.  They serve authentic Japanese food.  It's a small unassuming place with a loyal local following.  Their Yakisoba and Udon Noodle soups come out very hot and fresh. Perfect for the cold winter day of our visit.  They are cash only payment."}
{"text":"Have been to this tiny restaurant for years. They have the best home-made Japanese ramen that's really light, healthy, and delicious. Since I moved out of Toronto, I returned to this restaurant again last time I was in town. Still the same taste, some decorations, really quite nostalgic. High recommend if you are around the area."}
{"text":"I went to Tokyo Grill solely because they stock Chu-Hi, and you cannot purchase it at the LCBO. A Japanese friend gave me the tip, and let me know that the place was very home style.  I guess Japanese home style isn't for me. I got a Pork Cutlet with a huge unsatisfying salad and some okay sauce. The breading on the Pork Cutlet was fine, but nothing really spectacular. The cost was $9, and I feel that there are a lot of other restaurants downtown, even other Japanese ones, that deliver more value for $9 or up to $11 and at the same time provide a much nicer ambiance and don't only accept cash.   My boyfriend got the large beef ramen. The serving size was appropriate for a large, and there seemed to be a good amount of beef. He commented that the beef wasn't all that great, but the noodles were good. He'd end up at Kenzo before he ever ended up here again though.   The ambiance is totally lacking, yellow walls with bright pink molding. Very little seating. Maybe their curry is totally excellent, and I can vouch that the employees and owners are genuinely Japanese. Like I said, a Japanese friend of mine enjoys it, but if you're just going out for Japanese food I'd recommend Kenzo down the street for Ramen or any of the other myriad choices at Yonge and Wellesley for Teriyaki/Sushi/etc.   Also they only had Grapefruit Chu-hi, kind of a downer (not a grapefruit fan), but it was still worth sitting there and getting full up on Pork, Rice and Salad."}
{"text":"Comfort Japanese food. The portions are big, the taste is consistent. And the staff is friendly. The food arrives promptly as well."}
{"text":"Whenever I go to Korea, my go to food is curry katsu. Unfortunately, most places I've come across don't have it. Not only does Tokyo Grill have it, it's amazing. Their curry is more sweet than spicy and has a lovely aroma. Their donkatsu is nicely fried and fits perfectly with the curry.  Price is reasonable at around $12-13 and the dinner portions are quite filling. I haven't tried anything else there even after going 4-5 times because I can't resist going back to the curry katsu.  Only downside I'd say is that they only take cash so I have to make sure I visit a bank before going. Also, while I haven't had an issue yet, the place is quite small so definitely not a place you can take a large group and expect to have seats for everyone."}
{"text":"This is basically Japanese comfort food. I was told to try one of the following three: nabeyaki / sukiyaki / curry katsu. Since I went with a friend, I ordered 2 of the 3. I opted out of the nabeyaki mainly because I already had udon for lunch; but I have seen it and it definitely looked delicious!   FOOD: 1) Miso soup: tasty and smelled miso-y (is this a word?). Had lots of seaweed and tofu. Yummy! Wouldn't mind a second bowl. 2) Salad: I had better. I didn't finish this. There was barely enough dressing. The lettuce was fresh but the dressing was nothing truly spectacular. I prefer the Manpuku salad. I know this is 'free' but if you are going to to it, then do it well. 3) Sukiyaki: beef is tasty and tender. Broth is smooth and had all the complex flavors of the ingredients: spinach, noodles, egg, tofu, onions, beef, and mirin stock. I had to sprinkle some chilli powder on it but that is because I like it spicy. Well worth the value. Would come back just to have this. 4) Chicken Katsu Curry is meh. The curry was earthy but I can replicate this at home without much effort. The chicken was moist and flavorful. However, I could count the amount of SMALL pieces of beef cubes / chicken slices. Would pass on this one.  SERVICE & DECOR: 1) It is stuffy and hot. Basically just tables and chairs. Nothing fancy. But the price reflects this.  2) The waiter was patient and refilled our glasses. When we entered and left, both the cook and waiter said hello and goodbye.   I would like to give this a 3.5 but I don't round up. I would come back again to sample the nabeyaki and perhaps give it a new rating.  Stay tuned ..."}
{"text":"Popped by here for a quick lunch after class. I got the chicken oyakodon special ( comes with free miso soup), and pickled vegetables.  The service was good, the waitress was polite and friendly. The food was horrendously bland, and I'm sure I finished half the spice mill she gave me by the end of the meal. The miso soup was good though, the green tea lukewarm when I got it. The pickled vegetables were meh, but a saving grace to the bland disaster that was the chicken oyakodon.  They don't accept credit cards apparently, resulting in me limping to the other side of the street with my heel blisters, to draw cash from the ATM. I had to pay extra to draw cash which pissed me off, and I also had to pay extra for the packaging for taking the leftovers home. HOWEVER, if i'd let either of these incidents affect my rating, I'd give this place 0 stars.  Final verdict: I'm not going back there.  Sidetone: there was a small black fly hovering over me and my food throughout the entire meal. I spent more time shooing it away than eating."}
{"text":"Ramen.  Comfort food for millions.  This ain't the packaged and instant Mr. Noodles that's for sure.  Today, it was beef ramen with an side order of edamame.  The beef ramen arrives steaming hot, with thin slices of (flank?) well-done beef and a medley of cooked spinach and beansprouts.  The broth is dark and delicious, shoyu-style soy-based goodness.  The noodles are fantastic and it's preferable over Ajisen and Kenzo.  Great hot noodle soup for a cold, snowy day.  Edamame was overly salted, not a big deal for a salt lover like me but it might be too much for some people.  I don't think I'll order it again.  Service is always bright and efficient and they filled up the water cup without asking, which for an inexpensive Asian place is awesome service."}
{"text":"I think of Tokyo Grill as the home of the Japanese grandmama you never knew, but she welcomes you into her little home with simple homecooked fare and warms you up and tickles your chin.  Now the specifics of that are not actually true, but whenever my boyfriend and I are stuck as to where to grab food in my area, we usually end up at Tokyo Grill (when we can remember it). It is authentic, simple, and just right to satisfy any fix.  If you blink, you'll miss it in between all the asian-run clothing stores, tattoo parlours, and porno shops. As a marker, it is directly across from the new Sugar Mountain, and a safe refuge from all the dressed-up commotion of Yonge. The decor can be described as quaint and rural, and most of the patrons are usually Japanese. Due to the language barrier, you may have some trouble communicating with the servers, but they are friendly and their new and improved menus also help to make ordering quite easy.  This particular night that we went, I ordered a small size bowl of beef ramen noodles. Blame it on the fact that everyone else there seemed to be ordering it. The poor waitress had to explain that the noodles would take longer (30 minutes) because of what seemed to be an unexpected popularity that night. To her dismay, I insisted on having them. You know, it's like you want what you can't have, right? I'm glad I went with it, because the '30 minutes' turned into something more like a 19-minute wait, and my partner and I enjoyed some crispy potato/ground beef appetizer whose name escapes me, but my boyfriend described it as something like \"a fried Shepherd's Pie\". Pretty much it.  The ramen noodles were simple and delicious, topped with tons of thin slices of beef. Nothing fancy or over-dressed, just plain simple goodness, and even with my hunger, I could barely finish the small size. Worth the short wait if there is one, but if not, any of their other entrees are pretty darn satisfying as well. Good stuff, Nona."}
{"text":"I am going to tell you the horror experience I had at this restaurant. I had been there so many times for their curry katsu. So today I went again by myself hoping for some of this yumminess. I told the waiter I want pork katsu, and 10 mins later he brought a bowl of rice and a katsu on a plate without the curry. I explained to him that there might be a misunderstanding as I was expecting curry katsu and I had been here so many times before for the katsu curry rice. Granted, I admit I made a mistake and it would be nice if they bring back the rice and katsu and just add the curry to make it curry katsu rice. But NO... he left the katsu + rice on the table and brought me another plate of curry katsu rice. Now now, they can't honestly believe I will pay for both of them knowing that obviously I can't possibly finish all those food. Again, I tried to sort out the misunderstanding, and instead of fullfil what the customer wants he brought in the other waitress to ARGUE and gang up on me. Can you believe that? Which restaurant on earth will have waiter and waitress arguing with the customer so the customer will just suck up and take the wrong order. Other customers tried to help me explaining as the waiter and waitress there speak very little English. Finally, they caved and gave me what I wanted - Curry katsu rice, which is what I expect to eat half an hour ago. Oh no... this is not over yet. When they gave me my bill, they charged me $3 more for the extra katsu and telling me that the katsu I had is of bigger size than the usual one on the curry katsu rice. So I ended up paying $17 for ONE dish of curry katsu rice. I will never go back again! Ever!"}
{"text":"I love Tokyo Grill because it feels just like one of those little family style restaurant you would find in Tokyo.  If you're expecting something elegant and refined, this is not for you.  But if you love home style Japanese fare, this place is the best I've tried in Toronto.  My favourite thing to order is the Nabeyaki Udon.  It's the perfect comfort food for me and I can eat it everyday!!"}
{"text":"My favourite food here is Croquette(side) with Japanese curry meal. Their croquette is very big compared to other Japanese restaurant serving them. Their curry taste like typical Japanese homemade curry! (which is good)  I have tried their udon too (udon is nothing special here)  If you want homemade Japanese curry, this is the place for it"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Tokyo Grill for years, and anytime I'm in the area, this is my \"go to\" spot for Japanese food.    The restaurant itself is small, with some tables to accommodate more guests at the back. The times I've come in hasn't been too busy, and I'm usually seated right away.  My favorite dish is the chicken katsu curry rice.  It's a generous serving of Japanese curry, with chunks of beef, carrots, and potatoes, served over crispy breaded chicken and white rice. It comes with a salad beforehand. After eating this, I'm good for the rest of the day.  During the work week, there are smaller portions offered for lunch.  I've also tried the chicken teriyaki, ebi fry, oyako don, and croquettes, which are all equally good.  One thing to remember...cash only!! No debit or credit cards.  Also, the restaurant closes at around 3:30 pm, and reopens for dinner at 5:30 pm.  If you want authentic Japanese food that's not just sushi, you'd want to pay Tokyo Grill a visit."}
{"text":"A nice place to curry lovers. A small warm and nice restaurant! The washroom is so clean!!! The service is not bad, however waiters would forget to give u menus when they are busy."}
{"text":"OMG What's that? The servers are speaking Japanese? They are!!   Totally did not expect Tokyo Grill to be actually Japanese-owned, especially with so many Korean and Chinese owned sushi places that have taken over downtown Toronto. Well, what a pleasant surprise!   As anticipated, the waitresses were so very polite and moved very quickly. Their English may not be fluent, but they know the basics of what their customers want.   I've since been their loyal customer. I LOVE their beef sukiyaki! The portions are large for one person, so I suggest sharing with a friend! It's loaded with tofu, veggies, and the beef is sweet and tender. Hmmm.... nom nom nom!  I'm also a fan of their Katsu Curry! The sauce is home-made and has it's own unique taste, with a hint of pepper. It's definitely one-of-a-kind! The chicken is lightly battered, glazed in curry sauce.   They're conveniently located steps away from Wellesley Subway station. Too bad I don't live in that area anymore because I just made myself very hungry.   Tip: Park at the visitor parking spots at 24 Wellesley for free!"}
{"text":"??????????? Unagi don was very good~ authentic, big bowl, but a bit too much sauce in the bottom.  Eel tasted 10/10 like in Tokyo.  Waitresses are nice ^^, 15 cad unagi don with miso soup with tax. Will come back for more!"}
{"text":"Love it here. Just discovered it and it's already closing! But I have to say they have the best miso soup ever"}
{"text":"A small cozy restaurant with good food and good prices. The service was nice as well with friendly staff.  My friend and I were feeling like soup so we came in to order some udon (beef for my buddy and tsukimi for me - that's with an egg).  Before the soups came out we also ordered the tsukemono (pickled veggies) and I wanted to try natto for the first time!  The pickled vegetables were crunchy and tangy. They were a great counter balance to the texture and flavour of the natto. Natto is a fermented soybean dish. Here they served it with an egg yolk and some scallions. I've heard that some people are put off by the strong natto flavour but honestly I enjoyed it. The only issue was how difficult/messy it became to eat with the slippery egg yolk coating it (maybe there's a trick to this??). The udon soup was good. Noodles were a nice chewiness. Adding the spice they provided on the side really kicked up the flavour.   I'd come back here for sure!"}
{"text":"Tokyo Grill is not your typical Japanese restaurant, their food is fresh, authentic, and the servers are very pleasant.    The restaurant itself is very small, and can get a little crowded at lunch hour. Tables-for-two are squeezed tightly together.    I had the Chicken Katsu, upon my dad's recommendation.  It was delicious and really hit the spot! The size of the chicken is very generous, and I realized I should have opted for the lunch portion. Hot, crispy, and tender, the chicken is complemented by the tonakatsu sauce along with a salad, and steamed rice. It's a well-rounded meal, and comfort food close to the University of Toronto campus."}
{"text":"Came here with the boyfriend over the summer, and I rather enjoyed this place! It's relatively hidden and small, but I kind of like the quietness of it, and it's definitely a change of pace to have lunch at a japanese establishment that does not merely consist of AYCE, ramen, or bento box specials.   I ordered a beef sukiyaki, which came with rice and miso soup. It was really yummy, and I always loved mixing soupy things with my rice. Portions are also generous and was proportionate to the costs. In fact the sukiyaki portion is big enough to be shared between two people along with a snack as well. Some people may find the sukiyaki to be on the sweet side though, but I was fine with it.  Overall I did enjoy my experience here and would certainly return when I'm in the are and feel like Japanese food."}
{"text":"Im sad to go against most of my fellow yelpers and leave a bad review but I wasn't a fan. I had the sukiyaki, which was missing some of the ingredients and I found really salty. My stomach also didn't agree with me after this meal. Maybe the kitchen was having an off night ...."}
{"text":"Came here today for a late lunch. A small establishment; the service was very good. The waiter would come around whenever she saw our glasses could be refilled. The food was excellent, and I will definitively go there again to try some of their other things."}
{"text":"This is a great little place on Yonge...a cute and charming Japanese hole in the wall. Stopped by here with my sister on the weekend. It was a hot Saturday afternoon, so we wanted something not too hot. We ordered the summer noodle, California roll, tofu and the fish cake.  All were yummy ~ The summer noodle was refreshing and chilled, perfect meal for the weather.  I wanted to order the Soba, which is only available the last Saturday of the month..unfortunately, it was sold out :(  Guess I will have to wait until the next Saturday."}
{"text":"Tokyo grill is the definition of comfort home food. Chicken ramen, curry udon, ika fry, koroke! My friends who left Toronto and moved to NYC years ago are jealous that I can still eat here. Whenever they visit Tokyo grill is where we go!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place so much! Love the cozy mom and pop atmosphere, but I felt the food was a bit lackluster.   Last year I got the chance go go to Japan and loved having curry there! I've been dying to get a taste of authentic nostalgia and found this place. Bit of a hole in the wall, it doesn't really stand out but that's what intrigued me all the more.   I went for dinner during a weekday so it wasn't too busy, and we were seated very quickly. The service in general was very quick and pleasant so service definitely gets an A+ from me. Looking at the menu the prices seem pretty comparable to some of the newer Japanese curry places like Mr. Tonkatsu.   We decided to order the chicken katsu curry that seems to be really popular here on yelp and the croquette curry! It wasn't long before we received our orders. The chicken katsu curry was a pretty good size, lots of rice, plenty curry, and a sizeable piece of chicken. The croquette on the other hand was really quite small... I'd say it was comparable to the size of a McDonalds meat patty. And only one piece for the sane price as the chicken katsu. Also keep in mind croquettes are mostly just fried potato. This croquette was suppose to have beef mixed in as well but i'd say the mix ratio was something like 10:1, so that was certainly disappointing.  Aside from the surprisingly small croquette, I was not a big fan of the curry sauce. Its so sweet!!!  If I was in a blindfolded taste test I would have thought it was some kind of weird butter chicken sauce.  Its just so sweet with barely any curry flavour at all.  My mind was so confused eating this as all visual and olfactory signs would have pointed to an amazing curry sauce.  One redeeming factor however was that the spice level of the sauce was quite nice.   Overall, the quantity of the food was good but I definitely think with the astounding amounts of Japanese restaurants opening up, there's definitely better places to try at the same price point."}
{"text":"You know a place is good when Japanese people come here. Several regular Japanese customers walked in to get their take out orders.  It's hard to put your finger on it but there's a very nostalgic feeling to this place even though it's not fancy. Maybe to Japanese people it's a piece of home.   We had the chicken katsu and katsu curry. I wouldn't say the food blows my mind. Curry is curry and katsu is katsu. They've made it right and I had a good meal. Meals come with a salad.   I didn't find the price very cheap at $11.50 but it's not terrible either. I would come again. For some reason this place feels more authentic than other places, even though I can't identify why. I would come again to try another thing."}
{"text":"If you like strong flavours, Tokyo grill will do! We had the kitsune udon and the pork curry katsu. I found the kitsune to be a little heavier (and kind of salty?) than other ones I've had, but I was surprised that the udon was flavourful as well! Usually the udon I have are bland, and you need to drink the soup for flavour. The katsu curry was surprisingly sweet and spicy, and you get a LOT of rice and curry sauce - so the amount of pork you get might seem quite small in comparison. Overall, a great place for comfort food and I'd come again!"}
{"text":"This small little japanese joint is one of the more authentic japanese restos in Toronto.  I always get a nice friendly service, and they were pretty quick too around lunch time (got in a bit after 12pm and out before 1pm)  We got the curry udon and the beef ramen today.  The beef ramen is not instant noodles and is one of their specialties. The soup was a clear miso-y broth and all had a very clean, non msg taste THe curry udon had a thick-ish soup base that was spicey (but not too spciey) and tender beef, carrots and potatotes stewing inside. I really liked it! Price wise, it's all aroun $8.95-$9.95 per dish. No it doesn't come as a special with salads and soups on the side (altho they do have one special each day that does), but it's more than enough for a full hearty lunch that gives you itis."}
{"text":"This little Japanese restaurant serves some great homey food! My bf and I visited Tokyo grill a few weeks back. I ordered pork katsu because that is my favourite thing ever! And my bf ordered the eel rice.   My pork katsu came in a hugeee portion, they give you a lot of curry enough for your rice and katsu. The largest plate I have ever seen! It was really delicious too..taste homemade which is nice. My bf also enjoyed his eel rice a lot. The pork katsu seemed to be a popular dish as most tables ordered that. I'll definitely come back again if I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Small restaurant with limited seating available.  Authentic Japanese chef (owner, perhaps?) and the server were overheard their conversation in Japanese.  One of the main reasons I came here was for the famous curry pork cutlet.  Lunch portion was smaller than regular (I guessed) and it's comparable expensive lunch that I had ($12 after all).  Curry sauce was tasty and a little spicy.  I always thought that Japanese curry would have little touch of sweet taste.  Pork chop was perfectly cooked, soft and not too dry.  Also, $1 charge for green tea, btw.  CASH ONLY too!  Yes, I will be back for another lunch, perhaps.  Maybe try something else?"}
{"text":"Love the lunch specials. I've had the katsu rice and also ebi fry, both are great! Love the dressing on the salads and for $6, you can't find that anywhere else. I would love to come back for dinner and try some of the things others recommend.  The place is a bit run down but it serves good comfort food!"}
{"text":"Stop 5 of AlzCon 2k16, or something.  You know, I really only came here for Chicken Katsu Curry, which is something I've really wanted ever since that one episode of DAYS came out. What a weeb. Katsu Curry is such good comfort food, honestly. In particular, this curry had just the right amount of flavor to make it spicy, but not punishingly so. I wish they gave more katsu, but it's fine, because I also got to taste the croquettes. They're filled with ground beef, instead of vegetables, and I think I prefer the latter, but that doesn't detract from how good they are.  Don't come here for eye candy.  2/5."}
{"text":"So here's the thing about this place: it's not a sushi place, it's not Japanese fusion, it's known for Japanese comfort food and it does that well.   I ordered the katsu curry (comes with rice and Japanese green salad) for 11.95 and it was a very large portion.  The katsu was crispy but it still had plenty of meat inside, so the breading to meat ratio was perfect.  As for the curry, I don't know if it was using chicken cubes or was packaged or was homemade, and frankly I don't really care because it tastes great.  As my friend said, it would make great drunk food or great hangover food. I think it's great sober comfort food too.   Verdict: will visit again.  Try it out peeps.    Tip 1: Cash only Tip 2: Curry is made with beef so if you have any dietary restrictions pertaining to beef, don't order the curry."}
{"text":"I came here after work with excitement. My buddies at work said its a decent home-style Japanese restaurant with affordable pricing. My girlfriend looks asian cuisine so I decided to check it out. The place itself had very limited seating and the decoration was out-of-date. I question the sanitary condition of the kitchen from the looks. I ordered a Pork cutlet and my girlfriend ordered a Beef ramen. I think the cutlet was alright. It wasn't special or anything. However, I was very upset with the ramen my girl has got. We clearly saw some kind of bug in the ramen and asked the waitress nicely to replace the dish. Guess what. They were like..\"Its not a bug..It's one of the condiments in the ramen.\". This got me really mad. They were thinking non-asians couldn't even tell the difference between an ingredient and a bug. We ended up going to a different restaurant right after. Wouldn't go here ever again."}
{"text":"This place attracts alot of japanese folks and it's one of my favorite japanese restaurants for a home-style cooked meal. Their portions are generous and fair for the price. Love the sukiyaki, inari and futomaki. Cash only is the only drawback for me."}
{"text":"Order: Chicken Katsu Curry Rice  The first thing I noticed about this hidden gem was the number of Japanese people eating in that day.  And if you know Japanese people, you would know that they tend to be food snobs when it comes to Japanese food.    Otherwise, this place is just average everywhere else across the board (atmosphere, service, etc) - which is the main reason for the 3-star mark.  The food itself is fairly priced and is close to authentic.  My curry was good, but the taste award definitely goes to the katsu, which was nice, juicy, and tender.  On their menu it's listed as a popular choice item - and rightly so.    [Pros] + has a little bit of everything a Japanese foodie may want - various zensai, curry, soba, ramen, and the works + fairly inexpensive  [Cons] - not worth coming for the atmosphere - service was sub-par - food wasn't bad, but wasn't to die for either  [Recommendation] * Chicken Katsu Curry Rice"}
{"text":"We ordered Unagi Don and Gyu Don. I must say that it was a wonderful experience. The restaurant was quiet and the service was nice. The food was delicious! Good price. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Always good. Downside is that it is small and people are too loud when they talk or eat. If you are asian like I am, quiet down. Otherwise the food is great and I don't have any complaints"}
{"text":"I just wanted to say that I ADORE this restaurant. The food is good and the staff is polite. Personally, I like places where I can eat in peace with a not much loud noise and this place is one of those. I don't think a lot of people give this place the chance because of the surrounding area their in but I promise you its worth the try!   The restaurant inside is small so theres not a lot of tables (probably about 7 only) so this isn't a place to bring big groups in if your like a party of 20 or something but its a good place to bring a date or a friend whose into Japanese food and casual dining.  Anyway, we ordered the chicken katsu curry and the sukiyaki and both were really good! Tasted like a good home cooked meal.  I would go back again and try other things from their menu. They have a repeat in me customer for sure!  And we paid by debit. Am not sure why previous reviews said cash only but yeah.. you can do both. Not sure about CC though.***FYI"}
{"text":"Chicken Katsu was 'decent'...  Sauce was pretty nasty.  Salad around the plate very plain.  Very simple/basic breaded fried chicken, wouldn't order that again...  Sukiyaki is good, but not great.  Less tofu, more beef!  Not sure I would return, might like to try their curry...   CASH ONLY.  Invest in some debit, it's annoying in 2014 to assume everyone is going to ONLY pay cash."}
{"text":"Tokyo Grill seems to be a favourite among the university student crowd because every time I go, they're the dominant demographic. I can understand why, since the food is decent and not over-priced.  They offer many home-style or \"typical\" Japanese foods, like those you would be served if you visited a Japanese friend at their home.  My favourite selections have been the udon, and the tofu \"steak\", the latter being a slab of steamed silken tofu wrapped in a crepe-like fried egg dressed with sauteed bean sprouts. It's probably not the most tasty dish you can ever imagine, but it's unique, healthy and always manages to satisfy my hunger. Another favourite of mine that's available in the summer months is the hiyashi-chuka, or Chinese-style chilled noodles... it's also something that you can't always get most places.  The broth they use for udon and ramen has been excellent. I suspect though that they might use packaged/instant ramen... not sure--I've only ordered it once, as I can find better ramen elsewhere.  Their sukiyaki is also a good deal, and very tasty, though it's not cooked at your table. Rather, it is served in the cast iron pot it was cooked in."}
{"text":"Never been let down here. The food and service are consistently good.  The only issue is that they don't accept credit, which can sometimes be a hassle.   Additionally, the bill isn't promptly brought to the table, which throws some customers off. Just head up to the front counter after you finish your meal."}
{"text":"Sukiyaki is a must-try dish (especially during winter)! It's super flavourful. Just the mere thought of it makes my mouth watery lol.   PS This place is strictly CASH ONLY."}
{"text":"It seems that whenever I need food that could inspire and motivate me, Japanese or Korean food are often what I turn to, yeah, just something about the presentation of these dishes. So now I've included Tokyo Grill on my list of Japanese go-to places if I need food to soothe my ruffled soul :-) The look of the interior doesn't do any justice for the atmosphere that the staff gave off. And oh my god! The place is operated by Japanese folks and you're getting the familiar \"Irashaimase\" type experience that you see on youtube clips; this was noticeable when I went in and the girl was going over the menu with a customer who was practicing his conversational-level Japanese.That factor alone was enough to convince me plant myself at a table have give the food a try. And no issues with the small space of the eatery, it's was just too quaint. Not the best for groups bigger than four people but good enough for a solo diner on-the-go or two people who want a more intimate, quiet dining experience. I didn't want to splurge much so I just ordered the Chicken Tonkatsu dinner which comes with rice, miso soup and the typical simple salad. The chicken obviously flattened with a mallet, was tender and flavorful even when not dipped in the pool of tonkatsu sauce. And the panko coating was crispy. And the miso soup was just too soothing. Definitely heightened up my gaming mood so I was ready to engage in a few rounds of boardgames afterwards. Tokyo Grill, you've captured my the loyalty of my appetite and I hope to make over again soon."}
{"text":"After passing by Tokyo Grill on Yonge Street so many times, I finally came in and gave it a try. The waitress was very nice and greeted me with her warmest smile she could. Atmosphere feels like home. Selection of Music is typical Japanese teenage song. Starting with hot water, I ordered a Katsu Don (Pork Cutlet with Rice). Food came very quickly! Pork Cutlet was not as crispy as I would expect but still tasted good."}
{"text":"We ordered the Chicken Katsu Curry lunch special. The food was not that great and small portions. I think Kaiju on Yonge/Gerrard is way way better. Bigger portions and higher quality before they closed down & looking for new location now due to high increase in rent. I would not go to Tokyo Grill again :)"}
{"text":"Big portions. Very homestyle comfort food.  Serves Japanese curry.  From these three facts alone, I should love this place.  It was solid (a friend recommend that I check out this place since I am a J-curry fiend) but it's almost too homestyle - like, I'm pretty certain the curry was made with Glico or S&B curry mix cubes.  Nothing wrong with that as most non-J-curry-specialists places don't make their curry from scratch -  but the curry seems to be the top-selling item here and it's inferior to the J-curry I make at home... with store-bought curry mixes... and I'm not a good cook by any means.  Got the katsu pork curry on rice - and it's a huge plate of food for ~$10.  So it's a good option if you're hungry and want to eat cheap.   Maybe it's just because the plate of rice and curry was huge, but the pork katsu look comically small on top of all that.  In addition, it was a bit odd that I wasn't asked how spicy I wanted my curry.  As mentioned, the curry seems to have been made with Glico/S&B cubes but was seemed thicker and darker than usual.  I'm not sure if they did something different but I would be surprised that no one else has mentioned this: there are chunks of stewed beef within the curry.  Now, I normally stew beef in my J-curry as well, but I don't make katsu at home (don't have the right tools).  It was a bit odd to be eating katsu pork with big chunks of beef in my curry.  Overall, it's not bad if you want a cheap, hearty, filling meal.  But do not expect quality Japanese curry that you would get from curry specialist.  For that, I would have to say Kaiju (Yonge & Gerrard) is the tops in Toronto."}
{"text":"Bland katsu don. Venue was plain. Food were over priced for the quality of the venue. Service was not bad"}
{"text":"A little disappointed with the ramen, but it was a good size portion. Kenzo seems better."}
{"text":"I'd say yes to authentic, homemade-style japanese food anytime.  Everything is yummy, savoury, and served piping hot!  Highlights: Any of the deep fried items(pork, shrimp, potato). I don't like just eating them with rice as a meal so I always get them with curry.  Their curry is also thick and flavourful. I love getting the Curry Udon as well. A generous amount of curry spooned over udon and broth is just so gooooood.  The ramen is also very well executed. Unlike traditional ramen (such as those served at Kinton and Santouka, which is two of the best ramen shops in Toronto), their broth is not pork based nor is it thick and milky. It is simply ramen noodles in a savoury broth with vegetable and meat of your liking. They offer beef, chicken, or vegetable ramen. The beef sliced served on beef ramen is also the ones they put in the Sukiyaki dish, so essentially you get sukiyaki ramen. :D :D  Their service is friendly and fast, but when it comes to paying the bill, it is much faster and easier to just go up to the cashier rather than waiting for them to bring the bill then the change.  CASH ONLY"}
{"text":"3.5/5, +.5 for service  If you're looking for high-class exquisite quality Japanese food, this is not the place for you. However, if you're looking for cheap, fill-you-up, still good kind of Japanese food, this place is definitely up there.  The size of this restaurant is quite small, although that might be because they only had the front section open. When I was walking to the washroom I noticed an extra section behind the kitchen, although the lights were off. Not sure if the area is used, but if not I can imagine this place being crowded for lunch.  I had the sukiyaki, while my friend had the chicken katsu. The sukiyaki came with a miso soup, while the katsu came with a salad. I overall found the sukiyaki to be very good, in fact the portions were so big you can probably have it for two if you're not that hungry. I managed to barely finish the sukiyaki (but not the rice), and I entered the restaurant quite hungry. The miso soup, while I liked the fact there were extra onions, was a little too salty for my liking. My friend was satisfied with both the katsu and the salad.  Service was excellent, as we were taken care of the entire time we were in the restaurant. It helps the restaurant size is quite small. If I'm in the Yonge/Wellesley area and am looking for cheap Japanese food that's not sushi, this place would definitely be in my consideration list."}
{"text":"It was on a rainy, sad day that my boyfriend and I decided to stop by here. We were both starving and eager to drench our sorrow (re: the weather) in any kind of warm food. Thankfully Tokyo Grill was open and ready to embrace our tired selves.  I had not realized this before, but this restaurant falls under a type of Japanese comfort food. Their menu consists of katsu-don, curry, udon and sukiyaki. Tokyo Grill's side dishes are nothing that fancy, so I would recommend against getting it, but their main meals sure taste good.  I had udon with raw egg, sweet mushrooms and narutomaki (the pink swirls) swimming in a broth of seaweed soup. My boyfriend got the pork katsu curry that arrived in a huge platter he couldn't even finish. The food arrived swiftly and steaming hot- just the way I like it! Our ice-cold waters were refilled as soon as they were gone, and the waiter was very attentive to our needs.   I already wrote a tip about this, but I must reiterate: TOKYO GRILL ACCEPTS CREDIT, DEBIT AND CASH. I suppose they only accepted cash a few years back, but let it be known to all that Tokyo Grill will accept all of your plastic cards. That is all."}
{"text":"This is a hole-in-the-wall restaurant.  The decor is suffering from some heavy wear-and-tear, but the service is prompt, the prices are cheap and the food is delicious.  It's not fine dining though.  It's home-cooking or comfort food depending on your perspective.  Plus, I think it's perhaps the only affordable Japanese restaurant downtown that is actually run by Japanese staff!  Everything I've tried thus far from their menu has always made me happy."}
{"text":"This is one of rare Japanese ran Japanese Restaurant  They specialize in comfort japanese food, and they Do Not Sell any Raw Fish!  The owner is the chef and hes been running this spot as long as I remember  My go to dish here is Beef Teriyaki, thinly sliced beef in sweet tangy sauce. I have also tried their Curry Don Katsu which was quite good as well. Portions are just right.  If you want some good authentic japanese food minus raw sushi, this is the place you need to check out.  P.S Service could be slow sometimes as normally they would only have one or two servers at a time."}
{"text":"I really like Tokyo Grill, the food, the service, even the mom and pop shop atmosphere is fine with me.   What really irks me is the fact that the last 3 times I tried to go, they were either out of ~something~ or closed early. I'm not going to dock stars for this but it's hours have become really inconsistent and you should call ahead before coming here.   They being said, I love the croquettes here! They're so good. Udon dishes and curry is also superb. The food is very tastey and they give a good amount for the price. I really recommend the croquettes here though, they're the perfect consistency and they add beef for extra flavour. I always end up craving the croquettes!"}
{"text":"Me and my sister got the lunch special seaweed udon along with the fried mackerel. The waiter who was very nice and fast, got us our drinks while we waited for what felt like 2 minutes for our food. The food itself was great and comforting...also our portions are small because the lunch special is smaller."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for years, authentic Japanese food, exactly the same as what i had in Japan! My favourites are Katsu Curry, Oyaka Don, Sukiyaki and Udon! Weekdays lunch time can be very busy, I prefer calling in and pick up, which saves time :D I didnt write any review about this place before, but recently noticed Google map put this place as \"permanently closed\", which is not true at all, in case this might cause problem, plz note it's NOT permanently closed, it used to close regularly on Tue., now it changes to close on Sunday.  Hope this helps."}
{"text":"Authentic Japanese restaurant ... Authentic Japanese food. I love the fact that the servers and the cook are actually Japanese! Very rare! Anyway...   For my first visit, I ordered pork katsu since i've been craving for this for days now! The breading is very light, it does not take the spotlight from the pork itself - you're getting what you paid for. The katsu sauce is good too! Craving satisfied! Overall, it was great experience!"}
{"text":"Very convenient location as it's just steps away from Wellesley station. As I entered the restaurant, the atmosphere is small and cozy. Very traditional family style food. Pictures from the other reviewers are accurate. Was intrigued about Japanese curry as I've never had it before and was told that Japanese curry is very different from the usual Indian curry which I am not fond of.  Was served quickly by the waiter which is always nice. Went ahead and ordered the chicken curry with an extra order of chicken, came to $24 with tips. Was definitely more on the expensive side. Food came out in reasonable time. Only so much you can really do with curry when it comes to presentation but it could have definitely looked more appetizing. Curry was aromatic and looked more like a gravy for the katsu chicken. Curry tasted different from the usual Indian curry as it was more sweet and mild. Chicken was moist and the exterior was crunchy. Salad was very basic.  Overall a decent place to go, but will definitely look into other japanese curry restaurants before returning to this one."}
{"text":"Consistent.  Have been going there for years and years (decades).  I remember the original waitress was very stern and used to scold me that I was eating too fast (seriously).  I think she's retired by now.  The food there reminds me of the smaller places in Japan where they serve traditional home cooking.  I have never had a bad meal here, ever.  The prices are very reasonable and it is true Japanese fare.  Good to grab a lunch which is healthy and delicious, not to mention dining in a quiet place without all the wannabe's shrieking in order to be \"seen\".  Highly recommend this place.  DOMO ARIGATO, Tokyo Grill!"}
{"text":"Nice cozy place, old style feel with oldies music. Food is edible Very kind servers but service seems to be slow for large groups a good place to get a warm quick meal."}
{"text":"Decent downtown Japanese eatery... Udons are delicious and broths are well prepared. It's more worth it to go there for the lunch special katsu. PS it's a cash only restaurant"}
{"text":"And now, for something completely different...  Frequent Yelpers and other diners-out have surely noticed the proliferation of \"Japanese\" restaurants along the Bloor-Dundas strip. They're pretty much interchangeable. Grungy storefronts promise all-you-can-eat sushi at back-of-the-truck prices.   Truth be told, I avoid most of them. If something sounds too good to be true, it usually is. Besides, unless I'm in the mood I prefer my fish cooked.   Tokyo Grill is a neat exception to the rule. Although I've never had an actual grilled item, I'm told that it offers reasonably authentic takes on Japanese classics. Before the Ramen Rollout of 2011, it was one of the few places to get your slurp on. Slurp-worthy it is. Springy, chewy noodles in rich broth; a toss of vegetables and other goodies satisfy stomach and soul, in a portion that defies you to finish it.   First-daters will probably prefer something a tad less messy. For them, I suggest pretty much anything else on the menu. It's mostly fried, sometimes tofu-y, and always sided with a heap of toothsome rice. On Friday afternoons in the summer, you can tuck into a plate of cold, handmade soba noodles; pleasantly gritty, dragged through the usual condiments.   Tokyo Grill is hardly fine dining, but for nearby office workers, it's certainly satisfying."}
{"text":"I still like eating here when I am downtown and in the mood for some real Japanese home cooking. It is not fancy but, the prices are reasonable and the food is good. The owner is lovely and he seems to hire students that are attending University. I have been eating here for many years now. If you have not been.... you should go. As I said it is not fancy but very tasty and you can not beat the prices. Chicken curry katsu!! Miso soup is awesome as well."}
{"text":"cheap, filling, delicious. Home style japanese food, really nice udon. Don't forget your ramune drink!"}
{"text":"I had the katsu don, and it was veryveryvery average. While the sauce was  nice, the tonkatsu was small and the rice mushy. The small portions may just be a result of it being take out, though - the portions in the restaurant were quite large.  Probably will not go back."}
{"text":"Overall, nothing too outstanding about it, though nothing too bad about it either. Prices are reasonable considering the size of the food you get, and pretty good for the most part. Also, in what seems to be a rarity around here, it's run by Japanese people, so that's a plus in some sort of way."}
{"text":"Quick and easy for lunch. Not sure if I want to have dinner here. It is not as authentic, so try somewhere else if u want something more Japanese."}
{"text":"We went to this place under recommendation from a friend, and it was just down the street. Honestly if it wasn't for a recommendation, I don't know if I would have discovered it.  My friend and I ordered a pork katsu curry rice and chicken katsu curry rice respectively. The host was really nice, and I appreciated a smaller menu (without all the choices.   Our dishes came decently quick, and the portion was actually a lot bigger than I imagined it to be. The curry was sweet and a little spicy, and that spicy is quite delayed. There were chunks of vegetable, which is great, and then I found a random raisin. Which I'm guessing elevates the overall sweetness, as our produce here is overall not as sweet as those in Japan. Within the curry, I found chunks of beef brisket, which was surprising. But the sauce vs rice ratio was just right.  To the pork katsu, it was tender and I appreciated that the batter was not too thick on the cutlet. One thing my friend did comment as that her veggies were on the \"al-dente\" style, which I didn't mind. But that is one thing you might want to note.   The dish was $13.95+tax.   Overall the service was good as they don't flutter around you, yet they are attentive to the things you want.  I can't wait to come back to try other dishes here."}
{"text":"I give only 3 stars because THEY ARE OFTEN RANDOMLY CLOSED! I love nearby and like to go to this place. So imagine I go there just to find out they are closed for whatever reason. Otherwise food is good, no complaints."}
{"text":"Walk into a small and quiet, family style restaurant. The decor was kind of old and plain. They at most can sit a table for four but nothing greater so big parties are out of luck. There menu consisted of a small variety of dishes. They serve ramen, udon and rice and some appetizers. Definitely no sushi so don't bother. Service was average, the waitress was nice.  Ordered the lunch special katsu curry rice. The special was a smaller portion from the regular main for a few dollars less, it doesn't come with anything. The plate was packed full when it arrived. Half rice, half curry with fried pork. The katsu was fried really well, it was crispy and the pork was tender. The curry had a little spice to it, not as sweet as the normal Japanese curry. That plate might not look like much but it was extremely filling. Finished about half of it and then had to get help from friends to finish the rest.  Overall, another possible lunch place added to the list that's close to work."}
{"text":"Everything here is delicious! Just don't hesitate to come! You must try the curry tonkatsu rice and the individual sukiyaki hot pot! The restaurant is small and a little bit narrow, but it's very cozy and lovely, and very Japanese style, tiny and cute!"}
