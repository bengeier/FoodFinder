{"text":"The food here is good but as for customer service I have nothing good to say. My husband and I would come here often just to grab some Chinese food since it was only 5 mins away from where we live.  Last time I had called in to place an order I asked if I can place an order of beef broccoli and an order of tofu in brown garlic sauce. She said something that I couldn't understand and hung up . So once I got there an old lady approach me and said \" hi can I help you\". I told her that I called in not to long ago but wasn't sure if she had my order down correctly. So she brought me the slip and well the beef broccoli was correct but as for my tofu  she had wrote down something so I told her and pointing it out on the menu that I wanted tofu but instead of the oyster sauce if I can have in with brown garlic sauce. We came back to pick up our food and there was a guy server this time and we've been served by him before and he was super nice.  We told him that we placed a pick up order for beef broccoli and tofu in brown sauce. Once he opened up my box of food he had a confused look on his face and asked me if I asked for tofu and I responded\" yes I did\" he looked at me and said I don't see any tofu in here so he called out the lady and said that I had asked for tofu but there's no tofu in here.. Well this is where all the madness happens the lady came storming out  pointing her finger in my face while there was a customer sitting at the table waiting for his pick up order, yelling at me and honestly I couldn't understand what she was saying. So we sat down and waited for our food and the same nasty old lady was at the front desk and said that it was my fault and stuff about her working there for over 10 years .. HA!! Really!!??? Is this how you treat the customers ...   I was soo mad and hurt by the way I was treated that I kind of tear up a bit . I honestly will NEVER EVER come back here again after that incident. I just feel bad for the business because their food is wonderful and well I thought their service was good until I met that nasty lady .."}
{"text":"Coming from the Hawaiian Islands it's hard to find good Chinese food here in Arizona.  But we did some research and thought we would try this place out. It is nice, clean and they had entertainment. When we got there the wait was 15 minutes which was fine,  but because we have a child with special needs we asked the girl in the front if we could put our order in while we wait so that way it will be ready when we sit down. She said ok. However 10 minutes later when she sat us she only then gave them our order to put in  Then to top it off as she is walking us to our table all the way in the back she just walks all by herself leaving us behind and not even looking to see went we are taking so long to get to her.  We took long because we had a wheelchair and there was no space to maneuver around the tables. We had to ask other paying customers to make room for us to go through! So they are not wheelchair accessible.  So we sat down and waited 30 minutes to get our food that we thought was put in ahead of time which was not the case, and our server was so forgetful that he told us 2 times our soup was coming which took 15 minutes!  Then we get our food with only 2 plates and none for our child with special needs and when we asked for a bowl he takes 5 minutes cause he forgot and we had to remind him  And the biggest disappointment is that the owner was there and he went around and talked to people to see how things were but because we are not white he didn't bother to acknowledge us. Goes to show you don't judge us cause you know what my hubby is white asian and I am Hawaiian asian. People here automatically put us in the Mexican race which we are not and there is nothing wrong with that but oh boy they only acknowledge you if you are white.  So I will never give them business again! And I will be sure to tell people about my experience there.  Btw the food was good.  Just bad service and not handicap friendly! !!!!!!"}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time last week based on a recommendation from a teller at the nearby Wells Fargo. Always good to ask people who work nearby where they like to eat.  The restaurant is stylish and tidy with welcoming staff.  They have a lunch buffet, which we didn't bother with as we were eating lunch late. The waitress was in the middle if taking our order when another gal came over and insisted I change my salad order to the House Salad that isn't on the menu. I'm always suspicious of this, it happens a lot at Asian restaurants and I often feel obligated to go along with the recommendation. She was rather insistent, so I gave in. What can I say?  I'm a middle child so I dont like to let anyone down.  Well, for once I wasn't sorry, as this often goes quite terribly wrong.   Here's our whole order:  Crab Puffs, as expected but the sauce was nicer than the horrible orange stuff you usually get.  House Salad, lovely chopped salad with a mildly tangy sauce and crunch cabbage and almonds (no meat) Thai Shrimp Salad, spicy with big shrimp.   Everything was wonderful.  They actually gave us an extra dish after my aunt said how she likes things really spicy. It was a spicy chicken dish that was also delicious.   I'll definitely be back to this restaurant, although it's nowhere near my house in Mesa, but luckily my aunt lives close by!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, service, and atmosphere. Definitely the best Asian food I've had In a long time."}
{"text":"I just returned from my second amazing visit here and all I can say is...OMG.   After eating here twice I can honestly say I will never go anywhere else for Asian food in the Valley. When my boyfriend's and my plans fell through tonight, we were pretty upset. Luckily, he knew just what to say to cheer me up an suggested we visit George and Sons, our new favorite since our first visit in May. Remembering the delicious taste of my thai curry chicken, I was eager to agree and I can't tell you how happy I am with our choice.  Walking into George and Sons (located by the Deer Valley 30 movie theater), is a calming experience. The decor is tasteful and beautiful, the employees treat every customer like family, and the seating is super comfortable!   After ordering my drink (I've ordered a few here and they're always delicious), my boyfriend and I went on with the (usually) daunting task of choosing an appetizer to share. Luckily, we both read the description of \"George's Seafood Pocket\" and couldn't resist. Let me tell you, it was AMAZING. The fresh seafood cooked to perfection combined with the fried scallion pancake and sweet sauce was irresistible. Two hours later and we're already talking about going back for more. We even saved some of the sauce for our perfectly cooked rice that accompanied our entrees.  I ordered my new usual, the thai curry chicken and it was perfection. A spicy coconut milk sauce covers delicious hot chicken. The dish also comes with fresh, crunchy veggies like bell peppers (my favorite!), and I always have to force myself to save some to take home instead of eating it all right there. My boyfriend got Miona's special chicken which I had (way more than) a few bites of. It is AMAZING. He was mid-binge when Miona herself visited our table to check in on us. I basically had to give him a reflex test doctor-style on his knee under the table to get my boyfriend to stop eating the chicken long enough to let Miona know he loved it. I also might have encouraged him to drink way too much Diet Coke in an effort to force him into the bathroom so I could delve into his dinner. Perfection.  Even more impressive than the food (which is perhaps the best Asian food I've experienced in YEARS) was the service. We had an incredibly attentive serving staff, and got to chat with Miona who made us feel like family. She even said goodbye to me using my first name as we left which was a special touch.   I recommend this place to anyone in the area and especially if you're catching a movie at the Deer Valley 30 movie theater! This is truly a hidden gem and although I love the personal service and quiet environment, I will be even happier seeing it filled with customers so I can ensure my favorite place in the Valley is here to stay.   I could go on for pages, but I have some leftovers waiting for me..."}
{"text":"The weekday lunch buffet is a good choice for meeting friends, easy, quick, eat and back to work. The price is a little high, but the quality is good."}
{"text":"I went with a friend midafternoon on a Friday, with not much hope that I would finally find decent Asian food in Phoenix.  But I was hugely surprised at the quality of their food, and you'll pardon me if this review sounds like it's a fake.  I grew up back East, and haven't found a restaurant to match, so I guess I'm kinda excited about finding it.  We shared the Won Ton Soup which will become my \"comfort food\" in the future.  The broth was flavorful, and the won tons and BB pork were generous and cooked without being soggy.  We also shared the Roast BBQ Pork, which was tender, and the sauce did not overwhelm the flavor of the pork.  I had the Spring Roll With Pork, which contained a delicious stuffing of pork inside a crispy wrapper; not greasy nor soggy at all.  The Pork Fried Rice was \"real\" fried rice.  This isn't the usual minute rice with carrots and peas you get at other restaurants.  This had slices of BBQ Pork, shreds of egg, and a nice hint of sliced green onions.  The Sweet and Pungent Pork was crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, and the pineapple tasted as if it was fresh off the tree.  We were also offered a shrimp sample, from the Shrimp With Walnuts entree. I think I will have to have this next time I go.  Lightly breaded, with a yummy cream sauce that did not overpower the fresh taste of the shrimp.  It was quiet in the restaurant; not a lot of customers, even though we stayed long enough for people to get off work and come for a bite.  The prices were a bit high.  I've decided it's worth it, but others may not.  The wait staff was pleasant and helpful."}
{"text":"Giving it 2 stars because the food was good, but it took forever to get there. My dish came about 10 minutes after everyone else's. And only after desperately flagging down several harried-looking servers. My husband paid with a credit card, which was not brought back to him until he got up and went looking for it. He asked to speak to a manager.  After waiting for 10 minutes, he gave up and left. We will be getting our money back for this one, that you can be sure of. Pity, because the food was good."}
{"text":"This used to be a Bamboo Grille and then it was something else I think?  Now it's a really good Chinese food restaurant.  I get the Sun Devil Chicken (At least I think that's what it's called?) and the wife gets this fried coconut glazed shrimp stuff, they are both out of control!  Abacus Inn also has a Sun Devil Chicken but I don't think it's quite as good.  Very happy this place moved in near home."}
{"text":"Had the day off & Wife had mentioned we should try this place for lunch. I'm glad she did. It is a nice small restaurant located in a shopping plaza. The lunch offered buffet style meal along with regular menu orders. We obviously went buffet (no brainer). The food was great and just when you thought they've run out of a tasty dish. They brought out new entree's in its place for the buffet. Try this place if you're looking for some good Chinese buffet with a variety of dishes during lunch."}
{"text":"OK...I've gotta give it up for G&S.  I finally tried it after I had heard from a few reliable sources that it was the place.  They were sure right.  But before you plan your Saturday night around the place I've gotta be clear that the atmosphere isnt going to blow you away when you walk in the door.  It sits in a strip mall between a pool supply store and a Blockbuster and there isnt any of that fancy new Zen asian stuff going on.  Well...at least not well done.  There are a few tacky fountains and some circa 1985 booths and chairs...but that's not what you're going to be going there for anyway.  So we sit down and and inquire about a Happy Hour.  I guess that they dont do that anymore.  OK.  So our first 5 minutes made us think that maybe we should have done Flo's instead despite the fact that we wanted to finally give this place a try.  So I ordered the Chef Special Noodles as well as the citrus chicken thinking that we've gotta go for the specialties if were going to give this place a one time shot.  Two minutes later our waitress tells me that they are out of the noodles so I am already doubting the recommendation.  So I ordered the beef noodles (chow fun) and sat back and waited.  5 minutes later the food comes out.  That was when I figured out why I had heard such magnificent things about George and Sons.  Wow!  The food was amazing!  The portions were wonderful and despite the fact that it tasted so fantastic I still have leftovers for tomorrow (or maybe when I am done with this review tonight!).  Just wonderful!  It was so fresh and so unique in flavor.  You could tell that their \"citrus sauce\" was the real deal.  It was created there by a cooking genius.  The chow fun was fantastic and although the service was simple...it was wonderful.  No attitude, no ego and very little trendy atmosphere.  Just awesome food in a low key environment.  I will be back!  Oh yeah....I will be back!"}
{"text":"Love the lunch specials. Very filling and have always had a great flavor. Friendly staff make this place great as well. Our new favorite, but would like to see the TVs removed...don't need that while I'm eating."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place after waking past it many times. It was very good. Fresh. Good service. Fast for lunch. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Love this place never disappoints always amazing!! The food is always fresh and amazing! Service Is great and always friendly!! We come out of our way to come here best Chinese food around"}
{"text":"My husband & I came here for an early dinner. We read the good reviews and wanted to try it. Unfortunately our experience was not good. It's not the worst restaurant I've ever been to but definitly won't be back.  We ordered the lemon chicken because of the recommendations on Yelp. It was hideous. My husband was starved and ate it. It was greasy and tasted like powdered lemonade mix had been use d for flavoring. It was tough as leather, a sharp knife had to be used to cut it. I had the spicy shrimp which were a bit fishy tasting, on the small side and bright pink with some kind of food coloring but much better than the lemon chicken.  Our check was presented with a fortune cookie that was completely smashed in 20 pieces. That just shows no respect for the guest. We won't ever be back.  PS portions are small too."}
{"text":"Rudest people ever. I just called to place an order and was deciding on our second soup with now wife, and the guy on the phone actually told me to hurry up with an attitude. He's lucky I don't go there drag his little Chinese ass out and send him back on with a statement. I canceled my order after."}
{"text":"I can't believe it has taken us this long to find this hidden gem of a restaurant! We were made to feel like part of the family by the servers and George and his wonderful family. Every item we tried was prepared perfectly, bursting with flavor and piping hot. The Thai Basil Chicken is a must along with the Kung Pao 3 Seas. I can't enough great things about this place!"}
{"text":"I was in town for a conference and saw the reviews on Yelp and thought I would give George a try.   I was going to go for one of the lunch specials but switched to one of the house specials at the last second. The Kung Pow 3 Seas was one of the best dishes I have ever had at any chinese restaurant. The perfect amount of sweet, fire, smoke, and the fish was all perfectly prepared (scallops, shrimp and white fish). Perfection."}
{"text":"Wow, really impressed!  Stopped by for lunch today 6/1/14 (which is a Saturday).  Got there around 12:30 pm and the place wasn't too busy.  I was seated right away and looked over the menu.  First of all, the staff here is super friendly.  Every person I encountered, was really nice and had a smile on their face.  That is pretty rare.  Usually, one person (your server) might be nice but that of course is because they are working for tips.  In this case, everyone seemed eager to assist me from the beginning to the end of my dining experience.  Secondly, they offer lunch specials, even on weekends which I thought was amazing.  Usually, lunch specials are reserved for weekdays only but not here.  $7.95 got me my main entree (firecracker pork), a small salad, crab puff, eggroll, lo mein, and white rice.    The food was excellent and I was really impressed with the quality and quantity, especially considering the very inexpensive price.  I will definitely go back when I'm in the area again, which should be soon since I am only 5 miles north or so of this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is definitely my new favorite Chinese restaurant! First off, they don't use MSG or preservatives - this is rare for a Chinese food restaurant, let alone an inexpensive one. Secondly,  the food was outstanding and the presentation was impeccable. Last but not least, the owner and staff were amazingly attentive throughout our entire visit. I cannot say enough great things about this place!"}
{"text":"Normally i never really write reviews, but thanks to the chicken curry i had there, i decided to. The texture of the chicken in that can only be described like i was eating squid. it was rubbery, chewy, and tasted bland. I Love chicken in any way, shape or form; Yours is also an exception. Besides the curry it came with which was excellent in flavor, this chicken ruined my meal.   I've worked in restaurants, I know how the chicken we prepared was, but i still cannot fathom how yours ended up like that."}
{"text":"We are local as in we live less than 3 miles away..i find this irrelevant as if this cozy little family owned and operated little place were 30 miles away, I would certainly make the trip ...but i am so fortunate as to have the advantage of being so close ...a warm quiet atmosphere...but at the end of the day thats not why I am here. It's for the food and oh my ...all the seafood entrees are as fresh as can be as well the extensive  diversity.....it's really hard to recommend a Single or even a couple dishes as all of them are excellent ...it's strange that the best chinese restaurant would be way out on the outskirts of town... but it is..such as it is with all gems..their hard to find. i was just one of those lucky enough to find this one!  .portions are huge as well so the only thing better than really excellent food...is more of it !!   Oh and no msg!!    See you here!! ..chris"}
{"text":"My family and myself went to George And sons for lunch special and we snowed the waitress why we wanted and off the lunch menu, we ate our food, food was bland and when it was time to pay we noticed that they over charged us,so we questioned the check with the cashier and he said our meals were dinner plates, we told him we ordered lunch specials and even pointed at the menu because the waitress didn't speak English very well, we needed to repeat our order 4 or 5 times and still got it wrong..very disappointed we won't be back."}
{"text":"For the second visit in a row, our kitchen was unable to plate and serve our party of four at the same time. One entree came out, 10 minutes later another dish, and 5 minutes after that, the final dishes were served. It's beyond me how a kitchen can't keep up with a dining room that half full at best.   My advice:  order food to go. At least you'll get entrees all at once.   The food is good, no complaints. They just can't properly serve even a small party of four time and again.  Forgot to mention that our server never checked on us after our party of four FINALLY got the food we ordered."}
{"text":"I have put in a thousand restaurants in the valley I have never went into a restaurant and told the owner to make whatever they wanted to make this restaurant whatever they have made in the last 6 months has been delicious everything about this place is good I enjoy the the atmosphere I enjoy the food I would recommend it to anybody"}
{"text":"This place used to be good and I was disappointed the last time I went. Soggy fried rice, the waitress didn't ask us how the food is, I hope they shape up."}
{"text":"We ordered take out from this place the other night. They were very friendly over the phone when we changed our order a few times, and they even offered to deliver even though it was out of their area.  The food was good, although it was a bit expensive. We did get quite a bit for our money though.   All in all, we would dine here again, but our favorite is still Joyful Chinese!"}
{"text":"I have been to the lunch buffet several times - always good and always ALL YOU CAN EAT :)  My experience is somewhat limiited as I have only sampled the lunch buffet - but you cannot go wrong with that experience. the food is fine and the people watching... is always interesting... you would be surprised what you see people do for some additional food on a buffett.. i have always had fun watching. very entertaining!"}
{"text":"I went to George and Son's today for lunch and had an amazing experience! The food and service were excellent. For 7.95 you get rice, lo mein, an egg roll, crab puff, soup, and main dish. A great deal. I had the generals chicken and my husband had the curry chicken. Our food arrived quickly and was delicious! Some of the best chinese food I've had in a long time. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time today, and was not disappointed.  Had the hot and sour soup, pot stickers and the beef chow fun.  The food was amazing, in a clean and comfortable ambiance.  I think it's my new favorite Chinese food place."}
{"text":"Great food, fun times and great piano music on Fri, Sat and Sun nites! Where did the piano go?"}
{"text":"Got take out after seeing this place has 4.5 stars on here (with 76 reviews!). Mongolian beef is the dish that I always get in any Chinese restaurant - this was the least good Mongolian beef I ever had; can't say it's bad, just not good, blend... The other dish we got was Miona's special chicken - great seasoning but extremely questionable chicken parts. I expect chicken breast to be used in any stir fry/Chinese food; not only this wasn't chicken breast, it was really hard to even find a \"meaty\" part - mainly chewiness and skin - pretty much disgusting, I wasn't able to eat it, my husband nibbled at it a bit. Really surprised that they have a 4.5 start rating...."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE!!  The owner will just insult you like no other. This was our second visit. Me and little brother were in yesterday and the owner just made fun of my brother for being overweight. Mind your own business and learn to talk to kids..  Will not be returning!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite restaurant in the area!! We are vegetarian and love their salt and pepper tofu, eggplant dishes and they make a veggie pocket that we crave on a daily basis. Amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"In town on business. Great food and service. Loved the pot stickers and all of the Kung Pao items. Give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite restaurant around the area.  George is a character if you happen to run into him and the staff is friendly if sometimes a little backed up on busy nights.  The sign of a good American-style Chinese place is a good quality Egg Foo Young, and George has the best one I've have in Arizona since Ming's in Tempe closed.  I'm also a huge fan of their lemon chicken, and kung pao chicken.    The Kung Pao Chicken excludes peanuts which I've never understood in that dish and delivers a nice spicy kick.  I normally ask for it extra spicy.  We've probably picked up dinner here 20 times in the past few years and they haven't had a bad night yet."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff came in tonight and it was 20 mins before they closed but they were more then happy to sit us and didn't make us feel rushed."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!  A group of us had just finished watching Guardians of the Galaxy at the AMC and were feeling a bit hungry and wanted to visit for a while so we decided to pick somewhere to eat.  We walked past George and Sons and decided to go in.  It was about 9ish at night and there was only 1 other couple in there eating at the time.    We ordered beer, sake, spring rolls, potstickers, and 3 entrees (orange chicken, General Yang's, and a Thai curry shrimp dish)  EVERYTHING was delicious.  You get a ton of food, my hubby and I split the General Yangs and it was plenty for us after having had some popcorn at our movie.  I think out of the three entrees the Orange chicken was actually the best.    Anyway, food was great, service was great, we kept chatting on and on and then realized that they turned off the OPEN sign and were closing at 10.  We felt bad for having stayed so long but we had already told a friend to meet us there and he was about to arrive, we just didn't realize they closed so early for a Saturday night.  They were so nice about it, they kept serving us while they were closing the tills and whatnot.  They gave us more water, beer, and even offered to make our new guest any snacks that he could prepare that wasn't on the stove/oven.  They were fantastic, and happy to keep us happy, they were never acting in a foul mood for us having stayed for so long.    These guys definitely just earned some loyal customers, I'm probably going to want to head over to that movie theater instead of Westgate just so we can eat at George and Sons while we're there.  Needless to say we gave them nice tips for being so polite and thoughtful, and I felt compelled to finally start a Yelp account so that I could write a nice review for them as well.    GO EAT THERE!  If you love Asian food you will not be disappointed!!  I'd give them more stars if they let me!"}
{"text":"What an awful, awful experience with take out from here.  They lost the order.  After having me wait for 35  minutes, it was \"found\" and ice cold.  I have no idea of why I was stupid enough to just walk out.  Never, ever going back."}
{"text":"This has been my favorite Chinese restaurant for years! I have gone to George's restaurants for many years and I absolutely love it. The food and service have always been great. And George comes around to talk with his customers, which I think is a nice touch. I highly recommend it. They also have a good lunch buffet that they constantly refill which keeps the food fresh and hot. Mmm... just typing about it makes me hungry for their orange chicken, or sizzling rice soup, or walnut shrimp, or mushu pork, or pretty much anything on the menu!"}
{"text":"The house fried rice is the best I have ever had.the happy hour menu is excellent.spoke to the owner and he was very gracious.please support this restaurant, the food and service are EXCEPTIONAL."}
{"text":"The Kung Pao Beef melts in your mouth!!  And George and the staff are friendly and super courteous. Can't wait for the Happy Valley location to open."}
{"text":"No hint of a taste of griddle here. Everything tasted fresh and the flavors were varied and distinct. My sister coined it well, \"it's so delicious, I don't even feel guilty...\""}
{"text":"The owner of this restaurant practically dragged us in off the street .. but we are so glad she did!  The food was great!  I haven't had Chinese food this fresh and tasty in a long time!  This restaurant will definitely be on our list the next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"Never disappointed when I come here. It's good Chinese food with an elegant feel. I love their Jumbo Shrimp it's really yummy! Their lettuce wraps are also very tasty. I wish they had a more vegetarian options. Overall awesome place!"}
{"text":"I've only eaten at this restaurant once, but have been fortunate to have had George's food catered to our medical office on many occasions.  The food is consistently good in either situation; survives the travel to our office well, always hot and fresh, and almost always delivered and set up by George himself.  George even had \"and Son\" with him several years ago, when he was still small enough to be traveling in his car seat; sweet baby boy.  He sticks around long enough for the first few of us to come in so that he can make sure we are happy with the food.  The fried potstickers are good, maybe a little greasy, and the dipping sauce kind of bland.  Crab puffs are tasty, too, with a nice filling of cream cheese with crab bits, and an unnaturally orange-red (but still good) sweet-sour sauce to accompany.   The Crispy Spicy Pork is just that, served with white rice; one of the outstanding dishes, lots of flavor with just a little spicy heat.  Shrimp Honey Glazed Walnuts is excellent, nice fat shrimp with an unusual thick and creamy sauce; one of my favorite dishes here.  The Fresh Mango Shrimp \"house specialty\" was OK; the shrimp again were big, fat, fresh-tasting, plenty of big chunks of mango and onion, but the sauce was very bland.  Szechwan String Beans are really good, lots of garlic and nicely stir-fried haricots vert.  Spicy Basil Chicken and Vietnamese Chicken are both reliably good.  Fairly large portions with the entrees at the restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is horrible I ordered two meals and I ordered soup on the side. I hated the soup and let them know that I wanted it returned. Normally a restaurant will automatically take the returned item off the bill, however this place refused and told me I was just to full to eat it. She said I would have to pay full price for the soup even though she had already thrown it away without telling me she was going to charge me for the soup. Had I of known she was still gonna charge me for the soup I would of kept it and fed it to my kids or something. However she took it and said nothing until the bill came. Then she argued with me about the bill for 5 mins before agreeing to take some off. By this point I am not letting up on the subject because I can't believe how this business is treating me! Do not eat here. Ps, the food was a 5 out of 10 as far as taste goes."}
{"text":"First ate here on Christmas Day...very crowded but were seated after a short wait. The service was very good. I don't care particularly for Asian food, but both my husband and I enjoyed our orders. Our two companions from CA weren't too impressed, but they have traveled in the Far East more times than we have so .... We took our daughter, son-in-law, and two perfect granddaughters this week. All six of us thought our meals were good, and the service, once again, was good."}
{"text":"We've been coming to George and Sons for about 10 years and have never been disappointed.  It's a family business, and the staff is always very friendly and attentive.  The atmosphere is extremely nice inside.   The most important thing, of course, is the food.  I've been stuck on their Honey Walnut Shrimp for years....amazing!...and the Pepper Beef, MuShu Pork, Lettuce Wraps...all delicious.  Do not skip the Pu Pu Platter (presented with a small flaming tabletop hibachi) or the yummy Spring Rolls. My husband and son have also enjoyed the lunch buffet from time to time, and for $6.95- I think- it's one of the best values in town. The last time we were in, there was a little combo playing (sixties oldies mostly) and everyone in the house and bar were having a great time. I hope George and Sons will always be here!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It's clean, has delicious food, good portions, and fast/friendly service. I have lunch here every chance I get."}
{"text":"Amazing Asian Food, the Spicy Fried Rice is great. Great environment, fast service and the pricing is solid.   If you want great Asian food this is a dang good option. I had the KPow chicken but I try their orange beef and it was great."}
{"text":"We were excited when we found that we could add George and Sons to our delivery list.  The food is good, not great, but it was a great option on lazy nights.  Tonight when the food was delivered it seemed like the price was a bit high.  There wasn't an itemized receipt attached to the credit card slip so I said to the delivery guy this seems high.  He gave no explanation so I tipped as usual.  Well turns out that there is a $4 delivery charge so this guy made a pretty big tip for driving down the street. I have no problem with delivery charges because there are some crappy tippers out there; I just hate having extra charges slipped onto my bill with no explanation. This will probably be the last time we order."}
{"text":"Ate here a few times, the food was pretty good. The last time I ate here I had a dish I was used to and after a few bites, I broke out in a rash. They advertise no msg, but my reaction proved otherwise. Very stingy when I asked for my money back. To be fair, I was at work and wouldn't get there in time to get my money, but I was scolded about not saying I was allergic to msg. ..Didn't know I was supposed to if there is a no msg note on the menu. Really uncool. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I have eaten at many chinese and asian restaurants over many, many years, looking for good, authentic food. We saw  George & Son in the Deer Valley Town square just off the 101 and 27th ave. and decided to give it a try. I am so glad we did. The food is amazing! So are the prices. Our lunch for two came to $19.39. The amount of food was more than I could eat, at one sitting. Service was five stars as well.  My search is finally over. I found what I was looking for.  Many thanks to George and his Son's!!!"}
{"text":"I'm from the East coast, so living in Arizona feels like living in the land that Chinese food forgot. George and Son's offers the closest thing to \"Chinese\" food that I have found in Arizona (yes I know this isn't real Chinese cuisine, just look at my picture). PF Changs is not Chinese food, and that is the best I have eaten before I came here. All the other Chinese food that I have found is full of MSG, and makes me sick.  The restaurant is cozy and relaxing, and the staff is very attentive. The sesame chicken is very good. I recommend asking for firecracker chicken. It is not on the menu, just ask for the firecracker pork, but with chicken. It has the right kick to it. I would NOT recommend the orange peal chicken. After eating 1/2 of my plate, I wan't to swear off anything orange for a month. I guess I needed something less sweet with a more varying taste.   Last time I went in, I had the three amigos, which was very good. This is shrimp, chicken, and beef in a brown sauce, poured over a hot skillet plate at your table. I would recommend any of the three I mentioned."}
{"text":"Good Chinese food.  Lucky Budda beer goes well with the calamari.  Had crispy spicy pork and some other seafood dish.  Twice as much as we could eat, and we ate lots of it.  It was very tasty.  No msg, not greasy, and most importantly NOT OVERSALTED. Just good cooking.  Staff was very attentive and friendly.  Will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Have eaten their buffet lunch a couple of times and find the food and service to be outstanding.  The number of selections is a bit small but that allows them to keep everything fresh and hot.  The dishes tend toward fried items and thus the one star reduction.  Don't get me wrong...I love me all sorts of fried anything.  Also, their fried appetizers and main dishes are crispy and not at all greasy.  I just would like a couple more healthy selections to balance things out a little.   Service is attentive, prompt, and pleasant.  The servers always have a smile on their face and are quick to refill drinks.     G&S has become a welcome part of my weekly dining rotation."}
{"text":"The sizzling rice soup is amazing...the Mongolian beef was probably the best we've ever had and that's saying a lot! We will be back."}
{"text":"This place was amazing, the owner was extremely kind and his family was charming. the food was out of this world, don't think I can ever eat Asian food from anywhere else again. The service was great, a nice hostess guided us to our table where we were regularly checked on. Overall 5 out of 5 hands down"}
{"text":"I walked into George & Sons starving and felt very satisfied when I left. The food was delicious, I wouldn't say amazing but it was very very good. The prices seemed high because it was just my friend, her little brother and I, but I have been to many Chinese restaurants and all are priced at at least $10 for dinner because the plates are served family style. The portions are huge and are meant to be shared with the group. I know my cuisine hungry family would really enjoy this place. The service was great since we went on a slow night and the waiters kept an eagle eye on us. In fact, my friend's kid brother drank 4 glasses of lemonade because they kept offering! I saw both George & his son, whom the place is named after. They were both much older than the picture on the takeout menu since the business first opened years ago. The father and son were both very friendly and I could tell they take pride in their business. The restaurant made us feel welcome and gave us about 15 fortune cookies because my friends brother was enamored with the treats (haha). Our little party all enjoyed the food. When we left the employees/owners earnestly wished for us to come back and I would not hesitate. But I would probably bring a big group if it was for dinner, or do takeout. Gotta love Chinese takeout!"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place for the first time and we loved it. We ordered the baby bok choy, house chow mein and orange chicken. It was all fresh and had great flavor. There was a lot of food for the price too. I think we found our new favorite spot."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. With good experiences at other Chinese restaurants in the area (Flo's, Ling & Louie's, etc), mostly positive Yelp reviews, and a vote of confidence from a friend of mine, I was eager to try out George and Son's.  Unfortunately, the expectation didn't meet up with reality.  I called ahead and made a reservation, which seemed to be a good idea, even though we were going early on a Thursday evening.  It turned out to be a smart move, as there were several groups waiting for seats when we walked in.  We were quickly seated, given menus and water, and then left to peruse the food selections.  For twenty minutes.  Now, I don't mind being given a little extra time to look over the offerings at a new place, but when I've been able to review everything twice, pick out the different font choices, and play \"find the typo\" on the menu, it's been too long.  When our waitress finally came by, she spoke to us with an almost-indecipherable accent, which made it difficult for us to figure out what she was saying about the food, kitchen, or what have you.  What I was able to interpret was that if I wanted to get a (as in one) veggie spring roll as an appetizer, it would take twenty minutes.  Exactly why it would take twenty minutes, I don't know, but that did seem a little absurd.    We ordered our entrees (citrus chicken for my friend, chicken chow mein for me) and a pot of tea.  When the tea came, the waitress gave some kind of warning, which we later determined was along the lines of, \"we just put the bag in, this will have to steep for a few minutes.\"  After about 15 minutes of steeping, it was still very weak.  The portions on the food were generous; I definitely had enough left over to make a good-sized lunch the next day.    When I try a new restaurant, I pick a dish that I can get at almost any restaurant of that type (eggplant parmesan at Italian places, pastrami on rye at delis, and so on), since it's usually a good litmus test for the restaurant itself.  If they can handle the basic, less adventurous fare, that   And while the chicken chow mein was decent, it reminded me of chow mein that I'd had at AA Wok on 32nd Street, where it costs less than half as much.  For the price, location, and reputation, I expected more.  Also, the brown rice I ordered on the side came with a $2 surcharge, something that I didn't see on the menu.  Overall, George and Son's was serviceable, if not remarkable food.  But the overall experience and price have all but ensured that I won't be coming back, especially with the other options available in the area.    Also, my friend got a fortune-less fortune cookie.  I'm pretty sure that's a metaphor for this place."}
{"text":"Amazing food, by very expensive. It's still worth it every few months to drop that cash."}
{"text":"I love this place! Some of the best Asian food I've ever had. Their calamari appetizer is my favorite and the sweet walnut shrimp is the best I've ever had hands down. Great lunch specials, good sized portions and comes with amazing egg drop soup. The dinner portions are nice and full and reasonably priced. Everything I've ever tried there is amazing. There hasn't been anything I've had that I didn't like. No MSG like a lot of other places. They're really clean and nice setting in the restaurant and their staff is very friendly. This is by far my favorite Asian restaurant in North Phoenix!!!"}
{"text":"Great Authentic Chinese food in Phoenix! I'm Cantonese, and always looking for good Chinese food. I ordered, Chow Mein, Beef with rice noodles, and the Walnut Shrimp. My kids and I loved everything. I loved the atmosphere and the service. Our waiter was very helpful and attentive, (which is rare for an Asian restaurant!) I'm definitely coming back here every time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"We really enjoy dinner at George & Sons. The food is excellent! The entire staff makes you feel welcome, everyone is friendly and enjoy making dinner experience fun, and this brings us back again and again. Miona is owner (along with George) and loves to stop by and talk, looking to make sure your visit is perfect. We stumbled upon this restaurant when going to movie nearby (actually Miona saw us and invited us in for dinner), but now go back often to enjoy great food and nice people. Many delicious items on menu, ranging from Chicken Lettuce wraps, tasty Iced Tea, our favorites of Shrimp Miona and Sizzling Pepper Beef, Szechwan String Beans are delicious, and special new \"surprise\" items we get a chance to try from time to time. Nice people, great food, enjoyable atmosphere, what else could you ask for."}
{"text":"I love this place! I tried for the first time today and everyone was sweet and kind and the food came out fast and it was phenomenal!! They kept our drinks full and our hearts happy!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years, and hadn't been back in awhile.  We have always had good food and very friendly service, but we may have hit G&S on an \"off night\".  First, it felt like we got seated in Siberia, and left behind.  They appeared to be understaffed, and it took 20  minutes for our app to arrive.  When our entrees finally came out, my usual fave shrimp with walnuts was lukewarm and my husband's mongolian beef waaay undercooked.  Our waitress only came to check on us after we were done picking at our food.  We weren't the only ones since the couple across from us also had problems with wrong dishes being brought to their table several times.  The worst was when I informed the waitress that my dish was cold, she insisted it was because of the sauce???  In the end, it took 1 hour and 45 min for dinner - not an easy feat with a toddler.  Unfortunately, we won't be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I went to its scottsdale location just because of the coupon they sent out, although I forgot to bring my coupon. Anyways, the restaurant was spacious and staff were very friendly. I ordered beef Chow Mein lunch combo and it came with rice, soup, and spring rolls! The Chow Mein was delicious, exactly what I expected it to be! Price was reasonable too.  The buffet was a bit pricy on weekend though cuz there were not many varieties, compared to other restaurants. That's why I didn't pick buffet."}
{"text":"Finally found a reasonably priced delicious Chinese restaurant.  We have only got take out, but the quality is there (speaking as a former chef).  Love the shrimp spring rolls!  So glad to have found this place!"}
{"text":"Great Chinese can be difficult to find in the middle of the desert, but this place is delicious and friendly every single time. They also have some curry options so more diverse than your typical Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Love this place! I always get the hot and sour soup and its to die for. Best thing is that it doesn't have any msg in it. It is a little on the pricer side. I wish they would sell the soups in smaller portions."}
{"text":"Spicy calamari was pretty good. It was a little too much breading for me but it seems to be a very popular dish here! For the entree we had the beef with rice noodles (SO good) and the sizzling pepper beef! Both were delicious! The waiters/waitresses were all very nice. There were at least 4 people who waited on us (weird?). Kitchen was very slow that night but that won't stop me from going there again!"}
{"text":"I first found out about George & Sons when they catered lunch at my place of work a couple years ago (I later came to find out that it was George himself dishing out the food, which I thought was a nice touch). After spending a long time on my to-try list, I finally decided to pay the restaurant a visit just a few months ago. I have gone back a number of times and it might be my favorite Chinese food place in the area. Some of my favorite dishes are Dragon & Phoenix, Thai Basil Chicken, Crispy Spicy Pork, and Pepper Beef. The only dish I've had that I wasn't crazy about was George's Bird Nest.   It's never been very busy when I've gone, so the wait staff has been very attentive. In fact, on either my first or second time there, the waitress brought out another dish on-the-house after we finished our meals. Apparently, it was a new entree or appetizer they were testing out. Every time I go back, I check to see if it's been added to the menu, and in fact the first time I ordered the crispy spicy pork that's what I thought I was getting (it was deep-fried, spicy pork bites -- delicious, but not cooked in sauce like the entree currently on the menu which is great in its own right). Hopefully one day that dish makes its way onto the menu, though. Also on the topic of service, the last time I visited, George spent most of the time we were there fraternizing with a large party of elderly people, pouring drinks for them, etc. It was nice to see that level of service.   I'm surprised by the number of poor reviews that are on here, but it appears those customers ordered dishes I've yet to try, so I guess I've just been lucky to choose the right meals.   Overall, great food at an affordable price with a welcoming atmosphere."}
{"text":"********** Last night was the \"Last Chopstick\" for us ***********    I'm well aware that some Folks love \"George's Visits\" to their table. The food here is \"Hit or Miss.\"                ....... and when they Miss ......... its beyond belief.                       Finally my Wife said ........ NEVER AGAIN.  Last nights experience, finally brought her around to agreeing with what .....  I've been  telling her for years.                                Confucius and Marvin say ........ Don't waste your Yuan here."}
{"text":"The food was great ! The staff was friendly ... Definitely we'll be back. I recommend the house chowmein and the sun devil chicken."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Glendale! Service is always fantastic and the portions are enormous. I've had almost everything on the menu and haven't had anything I didn't like. Miona's Chicken is amazing and the Orange Beef is highly addictive. The potstickers are freshly made and the best I've ever tasted."}
{"text":"We just ate at George and Sons recently and had such a wonderful meal. George stopped by our table and joked around with us! We've been going there for nearly 10 years and love it!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I didn't eat at the restaurant, but used them to cater an event. That being said, I was blown away by the experience. I used the online form to initiate the catering order, and then got a call from the store owner (George himself) the next day. He was very personable, and was willing to work with me for all my needs. We needed a vegan menu for the event, and he was absolutely willing to accommodate us. He worked with us to meet our pricing needs, and was even still flexible when I called on the day of the event and needed to adjust the menu and size of the order. He arrived on time, and set up everything (brought utensils, plates, water, pepsi's) and really made sure we were taken care of. The food itself was great of course. he brought a varied set of dishes and everyone loved them. I really appreciate everything he did, and the amount of work he put into our event. Cannot recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"Great food!the Thai basil chicken is my favorite.  Portions are large and the service is excellent too.  The calamari on the appetizer menu is another thing you must try!"}
{"text":"Just in my opinion the best Chinese in AZ hands down. I dream of this place."}
{"text":"The entire staff was friendly, prompt, and efficient. My water glass was always full. Recommend the shrimp fried rice. It was delicious and my preteen son chowed it down. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely amazing! The portions are gigantic. My family's favorite is the Miona's chicken. It's sweet and spicy with a tang. This is real and authentic unlike most Chinese food places around here."}
{"text":"I love love love this place. It is always busy the staff if friendly and efficient. They had a person there singing when we went, he wasnt the best however he was very entertaining! The atmosphere was really nice this location is in a very crowed shopping complex so sometimes it is hard to find parking. Food is always hot and fresh and very affordable."}
{"text":"My wife and I had the wonderful experience to dine at George & Son's in north Scottsdale a couple of evenings ago.  Although in a strip mall, the interior of this restaurant will surprise you by its upscale contemporary look and feel, very pleasant! The staff was attentive, friendly and professional, but not intrusive.  One must understand that they will pretty much customize the dishes to your taste or health desires.  They won't put peanuts in any dish unless you request it.  The degree of spiciness also needs to be addressed if important to you.   We started our meal with Tom Yum Thai soup for two people.  You actually got enough for three bowls and glad I am!  This soup was better than any Tom Yum Thai soup I had eaten in Bangkok (we ate this soup in Thailand 8 or 9 times, the year before last).  The degree of spiciness was perfect, flavors strong and the ingredients plentiful and definitely fresh.  Sorry to go on like this but this soup is my favorite, I even learned to make it in a Thai cooking school while there on vacation.  Next came refreshing Chicken Lettuce Wraps, 4 large crunchy iceberg lettuce leaves, with a side of plum sauce and a plate of the delicious chicken and vegetable filling.  The true gem of the meal followed with one of their specials, Kung Pao 3 Seas.  Over flowing with plump shrimp and delicate scallops, the \"kicker\" was pieces of Tilapia fried in an unusual and very tasty breading, all immersed in the Kung Pao sauce, crunchy sweet onions and green pepper chunks in a spicy but not burning sauce, peanuts added at our request.  Next came the Firecracker Shrimp that couldn't match up to the fabulous flavor and heat of the Kung Pao dish.  It did have twice as many shrimp as I had expected, and had a fresh taste.  Perhaps if we had this dish on a different evening, without the Kung Pao, it would have been judged differently.  For dessert we were given a free sample of a miniature \"egg roll\" filled with banana and chocolate, deep fried and covered in powdered sugar.  Then followed the ubiquitous fortune cookies and almond cookies as well. We will return to eventually sample the full menu!"}
{"text":"We had fathers day lunch here. Calamari appetizer was delicious, also had spinach fried rice. It was so tastey. Service was great. All main dishes were awesome. Even my kids enjoyed everything."}
{"text":"Went there for the lunch buffet. VERY DISAPPOINTING. The egg drop soup was luke warm and some of the entree dishes needed to be refilled. The quality of the food was mediocre at best. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"We listened to the reviews and decided to give it a try. My husband ordered King Pao Chicken and I ordered Miona's Chicken. We both LOVED! our dishes and ate every bit. We don't live in Phoenix but if we did we'd come here a lot. Give it a try, you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Tried George & Son's for the first time tonight. My family & I were in heaven. The atmosphere looks amazing and its very clean , tv screens are a nice touch and there was plenty of room to dine comfortably. We had the egg drop soup and my son who doesn't like anything loved it. I highly recommend the honey walnut shrimp, crab puffs, and their specially made bloody Mary was delish!"}
{"text":"My roommate spoke highly of this place and I'm an avid fan of Asian food. This place by far has the worst customer service I've ever experienced I've worked in the industry for more than 7 years and I'm absolutely appalled at the managers behavior. I called because my take out order was wrong, the first time I was hung up on, the second time I was told there was no manager and the third time the guy who answered the phone was completely disrespectful. He didn't even listen to what I was saying. I wasn't trying to get anything for free i was trying to explain to him that the menu they have online and what they serve are completely different. After about 5 minutes trying to explain and being talked over I told him I would not be returning to their establishment and he said \"good.\""}
{"text":"Excellent quality and friendly service.   The Thai basil chicken and house fried rice are two of our go-to carry out orders."}
{"text":"I've been avoiding Chinese food in AZ for awhile now, because every time I get the craving I end up with a little bit of everything that somehow all tastes like the same thing.  I got a recommendation from someone in the area and decided to give this place a shot. I ordered for takeout and everything came nicely vented as to not sog on the drive home and it smelled amazing!  Crab wontons, spring rolls, orange chicken and the Dragon & Phoenix... No leftovers in this household. Giant plump shrimp that were magically not rubber by the time I got it home to the family. The orange chicken was actually chicken, not bits and pieces coated in thick breading. The sweet and sour sauce wasn't just pink gelatin, but a flavorful and visibly seasoned sauce.  We will be back soon!  Oh and if you think you know about beers... They carry Gulden Draak. The wine menu was nice as well... They even had Prisoner."}
{"text":"Being from Massachusetts and living in Boston, it's been hard to come by some legitimate Chinese food. This place is pretty damn close. I ordered the shrimp with black bean sauce. The appearance is a little questionable but it was pretty delicious. My boyfriend ordered the Mongolian beef which was super flavorful and just all around yummy.   Service was super fast and pleasant. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for dinner the other night and we're quite impressed.  Best Chinese food I've had in years and we will be returning!  We started with vegetable spring rolls.  The wrapper was flaky and crisp and the filling had a great balance of veggies. For our mains, we had egg fried rice, beef & broccoli and Asian Vegetable Delight.  The fried rice was the best I've ever had!  Clearly made fresh to order, the eggs were light and fluffy and it had great flavor.  The beef in the beef and broccoli was tender and tasty.  The veggies in the Asian Vegetable delight were well cooked (firm but not too firm) with large, fresh mushrooms, carrots, broccoli, onions topped with a great garlic brown sauce.  Not a complaint, but some water chestnuts added to the Asian Veggie Delight would seal the deal for me!  Can't wait to visit George & Sons again!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, good food, and nice atmosphere. We have been going here for years and never had a bad experience. I visited last week and the waitstaff was exceptionally attentive, which is rare in restaurants these days. The New York eggrolls are outstanding and the beef dishes we ordered were flavorful. Nice, family-oriented business. Highly recommended :)"}
{"text":"We diecided to try this place. We dned in. We had orange chicken and citrus chicken. Both were mediocre. Large portions.. Price was high but enough food for two or three people. We had to order spring rolls and crab puffs as a side order. No egg rolls. No smiles on any of the employees. Then they started boxing up our food before we were even finished . No thank you for coming... we will stick to our regular place which provides an egg roll and crab puff with the meal and is still enough food for two at a much better price with friendly service."}
{"text":"This mayonnaise and soy sauce were sitting in the direct sunlight, 108 degree heat, for at least 10 minutes. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"This restaurant would be my first choice to have Chinese food?Especially the sesame chicken?that's my favourite. Hope you guys gonna have a wonderful dinner there?"}
{"text":"Disregard all other Asian food places. This place is the only option. Great food, prices, portions and service."}
{"text":"So my girlfriend and I walked in around 8pm on a Monday night. Needles to say, it was pretty dead; a large party and a 2 top. I'm baffled tht it took the wait staff between 5-10 minutes after we were seated to be greeted. After the initial wait, the rest of our meal was enjoyable, the food came out hot, and u could tell it was fresh from the fryer and hasn't been sitting under a heat lamp. My only negative comments are towards the wait staff; not very friendly and the service was lacking, they were definitely saved by their kitchen"}
{"text":"I like the soup with spinach, and several of the dishes. The entire menu is not complete. Use the \"to-go\" menu."}
{"text":"This is where I would eat if I hated Chinese food. Everything is greasy and bland either George or his sons are losing hair, 3 out of three times I have eaten here my plate had more hair than a truck stop urinal."}
{"text":"Nice service from the bartender and the only reason they get one star.   This is Asian food at its worst.   The shrimp was way undercooked and rubbery, the chicken was a mass of connective tissue, skin and what looked like small tumors. Do chickens get tumors?  One of their wait staff (a leathery old Chinese woman) asked if I wanted my food to go and I replied \"No thank you, it's the worst Chinese food I've ever had.\".  She said \"OK, you pay now\".    Sheesh, didn't bother her at all. Not even an offer to make it right or make me happy.  Avoid."}
{"text":"Gave it two stars because:  1. The food was ok, nothing special. Soup was bland, almost had no flavor.  2. Old lady at cashier desk needs some training on customer service. Extremely rude and made a big deal (and talked bad about me while I was still in front of her) because I paid cash and did not tip her. So, I will point out that I do in fact tip in restaurants ALL the time, but my order was a pick-up. I will only tip pick-up orders if you actually helped prepare my food or if I feel like you are doing an outstanding job customer service wise. Well, you failed at your own job so I didn't tip you on my pick-up order, which was over $20.00 for a lunch special on myself alone. Not only will I not come back here, but I will let others know about the service here. Someone tell the old lady to lighten up or get lost, talking bad about a customer while they are right in front of you is bad service."}
{"text":"Best Egg foo young!! Finally a great Chinese place. I moved from Seattle 4 yrs ago and this is as good as it gets. Nothing in the Valley is worth trying except for George's"}
{"text":"Great place to eat! Very friendly staff, fresh food and fast service. Don't let the location make you think it is not good as one of the best in Phoenix!! Don't miss out!"}
{"text":"This review is for dinner only ... we've never had lunch here before. We've been eating at George & Son's for years and it's still our favorite Chinese restaurant in Phoenix/Scottsdale hands down! The food quality is pretty consistent (at least with the dishes that we order regularly) and excellent. We've had friends report less satisfying visits when they go without us, and I think the trick is in menu selections.   There are some really great dishes and a few so-so ones. Our favorites are the House Chow Fun (you can taste the intoxicating \"wok hay\" or breath-of-the-wok in this dish), Garlic Green Beans (I like it a little more spicy and \"done\"), Lemongrass Chicken (the sauce is incredible and is wonderful drizzled over steamed rice) and the House Chinese Salad (I'm Chinese and not a salad eater, but I'd make an exception for this one ... the dressing is awesome!).   Some people enjoy the Honey Walnut Shrimp but it's a little too sweet and rich for me. If you like spicy foods, ask for the chili paste ... it goes great with most of the dishes."}
{"text":"Always in the mood for Good Thai food, I searched Yelp and saw that George & Son's was located close by, so I pulled in.  Although the restaurant was crowded, I was seated right away.  I ordered the General Thai chicken, and my soup was outright away.  I usually skip the soup, but today the Soup was excellent.   My meal followed shortly after (within 4 minutes) with a smile!   The presentation and smell was awesome.  This is a nice semi upscale restaurant with good food and even better service. So the Owner knows who served me, her name was Becky.  I will definitely be back the next time I'm in NW Phoenix."}
{"text":"I'm leaving two stars instead of one because I came to George and Son's once before and it was pretty good overall, other than the service being a bit slow.  I arrived a little bit early and asked for a booth for 2 as I was waiting for my girlfriend to show up.   She arrived and we decided to share the Miona's chicken together which was okay. We ran out of water and had to wait a long time to get any refills. Every time we needed something we had to wait on someone to get anything as only one person checked on us the whole night (other than when we got the check).   The service was quite mediocre to say the least. I then decided to order some more food to go for the next day. I sat down by the entrance waiting for my food when the hostess started asking me if I had left a tip, and she was really pushing that point. When I told her my girlfriend left cash (As I paid with my card) she had two people check our booth to see if we had actually left money. She then proceeded to ask me if that was all that I had left as a tip! I finally got my food in box cut in half that was used for vinegar bottles. I don't understand why they wouldn't just give me a bag.  I've never been to a place that has harassed their customers and begged them for more tip money... I will never come back to this place and I'm looking forward to finding another Asian restaurant who treat their customers right!"}
{"text":"I work nearby on Happy Valley Road and often go to George and Sons for their amazing lunch specials. They have a great lunch which beats out any chinese restaurant nearby (Even that overpriced bland PF Changs!) The food was high quality, filling, and a step above other places. This is my favorite Chinese Food Place in the North Valley. My favorite is the Sun Devil Chicken! The owners George and Miona are always so personable with all of their customers and make sure you enjoy your lunch. It also has a really relaxing, roomy atmosphere and they have a huge Bar and TV's to watch ESPN/Sports too. The decor inside reminds me of my experience at \"Tao\" in Las Vegas, completely relaxing and special. I have lunch here 1-2 times a week with my coworkers."}
{"text":"The kung pow 3 seas and green bean with pork were excellent.  The orange peel beef and Thai spicy basil chicken were also very good, as was the hot and sour soup.  Based on the food along, George and Son's would be a full 5 stars.  The service was only OK.  The waiter did a fine job, but some of the other service staff were not as attentive and did not fully support the waiter.  This brings the overall rating to 4 stars only to leave a fair comparison to truly best in class restaraunts.  The decor and atmosphere were appropriate for the price range and had a very comfortable feel.  I would recommend George and Son's to friends visiting the Scottsdale Area."}
{"text":"Ordered the chowmein and spicy asian vegetables. The chowmein was very good. If it had less salt and oil it would have been a bit more healthy! The waiter was kind enough to make everything vegetarian. I was not a fan of the spicy asian vegetable. Seemed to have a lot of Soy and less of spice. Ambience was great!"}
{"text":"I first tried George & Sons at their original Scottsdale location, which is just down the street from my parents' house. I was happy to see they opened a location across the street from where I work. They have lunch specials daily for $8, and it includes your choice of entrée, a cup of soup, a crab puff, an egg roll, lo mein and rice. It's a lot of food for the price. My favorite entrée is their Thai Spicy Basil Chicken. Service is quick and friendly, and the interior is nice and clean. We happily make the walk over when we're in the mood for Asian food."}
{"text":"We ordered for take out.. it was pretty good and comparable to some other places we have tried.  They have some interesting takes on Chinese so I would recommend if you are looking for something kinda different.."}
{"text":"My family has been going to the Scottsdale location for many years and its been our favorite place for Chinese food ever since.  When I discovered that they opened this  location in the Northwest Valley my wife and I were really excited. They really do have the best Chinese food!  Kung Pao Beef and Crispy Spicy Pork are delicious! My wife always gets the chicken and vegetable! Lots of food for the money and always fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"We recently discovered this restaurant and we think the food is very good. So, when relatives from out-of-town asked where to meet, we suggested George & Son's. We haven't seen these relatives for years so we were having a great time catching up. However, the manager came over and asked us to leave even though no one was waiting for a table! We arrived at 6:00 and this was 7:15. Maybe because we didn't have alcohol or desert... I don't know. They kept coming over and asking us if we wanted anything else. It was very uncomfortable! Our bill, without alcohol was over $100 for just 4 of us!  I've never been ASKED TO LEAVE A RESTAURANT in my life!!!! So very RUDE!!!  So much for our favorite new restaurant. NEVER GOING BACK!  Thank goodness there are plenty of other restaurants to choose from around here!!!"}
{"text":"The wife and I wanted Chinese . we found George and son on yelp , outstanding service! These people are at high standards of service , they do not take one table or section , I watched them move around the room to service customers . friendly , very cozy , clean place . The food was excellent . they have the every meal that other restraunts have but have some I have not heard of . some of the usuals have a slight difference , overall , I've found a new restraunt ,,,"}
{"text":"The price is right but the food lacks. I ordered a lunch special of curry chicken and it was rubbery and flavorless. I would have sent it back if I hadn't ordered it to go but I was truly afraid it was undercooked. The  positives though is that it comes  out quick and you get a lot of sides and a good portion of food with the lunch special."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch yesterday. The restaurant is clean and bright. Serving staff was friendly and efficient. Our waitress, \"Beckie\" was very friendly, good sense of humor.   The calamari appetizer was good. The green tea, also very good.   Two of us had lunch combos, large portions with both rice and noodles.  The two others in our party ordered the meals. Huge portions.   If you like spice, be sure to try the Sun Devil chicken, and the Firecracker shrimp.   A good experience for our first visit.  We all agreed we would return."}
{"text":"First time here and it was okay. I have worked in the restaurant business for a couple of years now. The service here lacked majorly. They were quick to talk to you and walk away as quick as possible. we ordered ice cream and I think there was a lack of communication since the ice cream never came but the bill did. A simple reminder and we were able to get ice cream. To say the least the hot and sour soup were the best part of the meal. Don't think I'll be back"}
{"text":"Finally a decent place for Chinese food in Phoenix!  Pros are it's very good compared to any other Chinese/Asian food place I've been in the state.  Pricing is very reasonable and the lunch special portions are huge for the price.  Décor is nice; the location is in a strip mall and parking can be a challenge on busy days. It looks like they have a full bar.  Everything is very good. I don't think I'd call any of it outstanding, but it's heads and tails above most of the Chinese places in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Excellent Asian food.  Very pleasant servers &management.  Quiet atmosphere with tables, booths, &a bar. Food is very fresh.  There's always plenty to eat!  It's located in a shopping center with lots of parking spsces.  They have pickup service."}
{"text":"As good as it gets is an understatement. Had the egg drop soup it was delicious. Had the orange chicken the best I ever had. My wife had the noodles and shrimp fantastic. Topped off with buddah beers and pot stickers. Service 5 stars food 5 stars. Then the owner came up and made us some walnut shrimp OTH.  What an incredible restaurant. an absolute must go back."}
{"text":"We've been going here and ordering take out from here for 13 years. It never disappoints! The coconut shrimp with walnuts is absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"We visit every time we are in the area and this time brought 10 friends with us. George was very welcoming and treated us like family. As usual the food and service were awesome. All of our guests were impressed. Will definitely visit when we come back to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I've heard pretty good things about George & Sons. Those people don't know what they're talking about. A friend and I went for the buffet. A buffet that was supposed to be of a higher quality.   It isn't. It's not bad, just not better.   George and Sons buffet is about the same as every other Chinese buffet I've been to except it's small, really small. Not just in number of dishes (which is 12) but in how much of each dish is made. There is little of each dish put out at a time. Initially, I thought this was good. Small batches ensures food will always be fresh, right? However, I didn't try a couple of dishes because there was never any there. The staff would bring out more noodles, one to two people would take a plate, load up and then, all gone. No more noodles. The same went for the Stir-Fry Veggies and the Tempura Veggies. Bummer.   Of the dishes I did try, I was most impressed by the Sesame Chicken. It wasn't syrupy like most, it was crispy and very lightly coated in a sweet sauce. It's the best Sesame Chicken I've ever had but that's not a dish I eat outside a buffet setting, traditionally.   My favorite part of the Chinese buffet (besides the tapioca pudding, of course) are Pot Stickers. George and Son's are among the worst I've had. The flavor was OK but they were soggy. The wrapper would fall apart when gripped by my chopsticks. Grilling those bad boys, postcooking, would make them much better.   The staff was super-attentive and friendly. Points for that. I noticed a bowl of Wonton chips at the bar, provided for \"thirstier\" patrons, free of cost. Nice touch.   Overall, George & Son's isn't bad but it wasn't the quality buffet I was expecting. It's nothing special."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: We arrived to live music on a Saturday night. The playlist included \"For the Good Times\", \"New York New York\", \"Pretty Woman\", and a couple covers by Louis Armstrong. The clientele matched the songs.   Food: We've been here a few times and enjoyed the Mongolian Beef. I'm not sure if they've changed cooks or we received someone else's dish but it wasn't Mongolian Beef. The gravy was entirely too sweet and had absolutely no heat like we requested.   The house chow mein was better but the chunks of chicken were huge and should've been cut into smaller pieces to match the other proteins on the plate. It was also too oily.  Normally, this is our favorite spot for food when we're in this area but unfortunately, we're going to have to think twice the next time we're craving Chinese."}
{"text":"I really wish yelp wold allow for 1/2 stars. This one is def. 3.5 stars. Not as bad as a 3 but not deserving of 4.  Pros 1. One of the best Chinese (in terms of food quality/taste) restaurants I've been to in the Phoenix area  Cons 1. Customer service no bueno -- they're not accommodating for takeout orders at all. I ordered seafood bird's nest and they told me they don't do that for takeout. Well, that's odd...I let them know that a few weeks earlier I had that same exact thing from them for takeout. The guy argued with me and told me that wasn't possible. Okey dokey! 2. They run out of or don't have items on the menu. I wanted the eggplant (didn't have it), wanted another veg dish (didn't have that one either)...."}
{"text":"Although not authentic, George & Son's has pretty good Chinese food.  We went there for the lunch buffet today and the food quality was a notch above the typical Chinese buffet. There were about a dozen dishes, ranging from egg drop soup to sesame chicken to fried fish to Mongolian beef. They seem to know what buffet eaters want as there wasn't much veggies in the dishes.  Service was polite and prompt and empty dishes were cleared away quickly.  They did raise the price of the lunch buffet from what the previous reviewers mentioned, but it's still a good value."}
{"text":"I've eaten here about 4 times now. And while I think the food is top notch. The people leave a lot to be desired. My biggest hang up with the place is NO ONE on the floor will refill your soda without you having to flag them down and ask them. At one point tonight the boss Meona or something like that was making rounds asking people how their food was and I thought I'd mention this issue to her. BUT while she hit the 4 other tables occupied she completely blew me off.  I might suggest take out from here thus no drinks no tips. But for dine in I seriously suggest somewhere else."}
{"text":"The north valley has little to offer for Chinese food. Husband & I found this place after visiting a family member at JCL Hospital.  We've been back there two more times  in just over a week.  All 3 times I was very happy with the food. Their happen hour menu is extensive & very affordable.  We're already planning what to get on our next visit."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! The spicy fried rice is my favorite dish. The SunDevil chicken and house cho-mein are other favorites too. Mona's Special chicken needs a mention, as well, but no matter what you order from the menu, you won't be mistaken. Their food is great and the place is very charming. The staff is courteous and we have never been disappointed with our experience"}
{"text":"I love their food! My dad bought over a bunch of take out 2 weeks ago and I have been craving it ever since. And let me let you, I do not like Chinese food. This place is great!"}
{"text":"Great food! I've been to this restaurant twice and have had nothing but great food. The first time I went, I ordered Mongolian beef, which is what I usually order from Chinese restaurants. This is the best Mongolian beef I've tasted so far. Even the samples we got were delicious. My husband and I went here for dinner today and I tried their chicken with mushrooms dish. That was great but we got to sample their Kung pao chicken and thought that was even better. Now I know what to get on my next visit. I highly recommend this restaurant not only because of the great food, but also because of the great service."}
{"text":"Amazing! Everything was so great! The right spice mixture, vegetables were perfect! Vegetables are hearty slices and protein in every bite. The girl who took the order was so sweet and they took the time to be precise. Delivery was fast and it was easy to give them a tip! The NY egg rolls are my favorite! If you get any dish, I highly recommend the \"House\" style! If I could give 6 stars, I would. A Merry Christmas it was!"}
{"text":"5 stars all the way!   Yay a very good Chinese restaurant!!  The food was equivalent to eating in Chinatown San Francisco for me.  I am a very picky eater and this place was excellent.  I had the shrimp with walnuts and it was soooo yummy.  The vegetable fried rice is soooo good as well.  Thank you for making the best!  I will look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for lunch for the first time and it was pretty good! I got the citrus chicken lunch order and it comes with white rice, noodles, an egg roll, and a crab puff. A lot of food for only $8! When I called to place the order they were super nice and friendly!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing and very delicious. I appreciate the service. They never fail to make us feel at home and they are extremely happy to always have us."}
{"text":"Excellent Tom Yun!  Curry chicken was very good and lunch combo was a great value!  I will be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Not only is the food delicious the services is quick and excellent. My coworkers and I frequently eat here for lunch, even though we have a short lunch sometimes they manage to serve us quickly while providing excellent service."}
{"text":"Went here tonight for Christmas. Thank you for being open. There was a crowd of people and i swore there would be a long wait but there wasn't.   Pros: -Everyone is efficient & friendly   Cons: -There was a special Christmas menu that did not include Miona's chicken which is the only reason we came here  -Automatic glasses of water that include straws. Please it's 2017 and by this point we are very clear on the damage humans are doing to the environment and every little bit helps. Let me ask for a glass of water and DO NOT PLACE A STRAW IN MY CUP"}
{"text":"Friday night 6:00 pm first time. Food was great pork fried rice, chicken egg foo yong and sesame chicken. The waiting staff and hostess were a joke took forever to even get waited on. Not one smile from any's server. We will go back but for take out only"}
{"text":"Love their food and service! Never had an empty glass, server always made sure we were happy. Recommend  the Shrimp with honey glazed walnuts and the Mongolian beef which is our favorite! This last visit we tried the Sesame Chicken that a friend recommended and that was great! The fact that George actually comes around and thanks you for coming in and has occasionally sat down with us and given a complimentary desert which was a warm crispy roll with bananas and chocolate  with powdered sugar on them tops off our wonderful evening . We will be back!"}
{"text":"I came here last week with my family and this is one of the best Chinese restaurant in Arizona. They have great customer service and wine selections. I will definitely come back for more orange chicken!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"George - I hope you read this. If I could have given you 0 stars or a negative review I would.  Short version: 1. staff your restaurant appropriately and with adequate people, 2. don't tell someone 40-50 minutes and have it be 2 hours and still have no food, 3. instead of smiling and offering free drinks - go help the back of house or help man the front. 4 - if you can't handle to orders put a stop to them - I understand Xmas is busy but you should know the capacity of your kitchen, a lot of orders is NO excuse for not delivering on what you promise.  I feel bad for your staff since they are set up for failure, as the owner you are responsible for this.  I hope you read this and get your priorities in order not just your profits. Thanks!  Long version:  I did not have the opportunity to eat your food tonight so I am providing you feedback on the experience of someone who wanted to eat your food and wanted to give you my business. My family and I were looking forward to doing the Chinese on Christmas evening, so we called in and placed an order for a few items to try different dishes. We understand that Christmas night is a crazy night for Chinese restaurants, but the individual on the phone repeatedly said it would be 40-50 minutes for our order.  50 minutes later we arrived at your establishment and was greeted by a complete cluster at your entrance - total disorganization and unable to tell who was there to dine and who was there for take out. Once I battled my way to the counter, there were two young ladies working the phone and dealing with checking people in, finding take out orders, and appeasing customers in general. This should have been a huge red flag when I first walked in.... I finally got a hold of one of the front staff, and asked about the status of my order. She said she would check and then disappeared...  15 minutes later she reemerged from the kitchen empty handed - she did not say anything to me so I asked for an update. She said she saw some of the order but they were still working on 3-4 dishes and they were all coming out at different times. Again - I should have left at this time....When I asked how long, she said she didn't know - when I pushed she said 10-15 minutes.  30 minutes later and still no food I pushed more on where the food was - I know I was not the only disgruntled potential customer. SHe said she would check and then disapeared again....  15 minutes later she came back and said they are still working on it. My Dad waited 10 more minutes as I was waiting with my toddler in the car at this point. I then walked back to the restaurant with my toddler, checked with my Dad and the waitress apparently came back and again said it was not ready. At this point I went in alone, confirmed that your restaurant still had no idea on the timing of my food. I then provided the staff with my thoughts on how they should treat people on Christmas and left with no food.   30 minutes later we were eating tacos I made at home. Hey at least it was food. Merry Christmas."}
{"text":"Nice little Asian restaurant very friendly people our server is great I have to say they have the greatest egg drop soup ever unfortunately for me the pad thai was one of the worst I've ever had almost didn't finish it my wife's kung pao shrimp that was decent I guess that's what I get for eating a Thai Dish at a Chinese restaurant I may go back I don't know"}
{"text":"I have had Chinese food all over the country including San Francisco and New York. George & Sons is easily the finest. I highly recommend it.   Try the spinach fried rice, Singapore noodles, spicy wings and the kung pao. All delicious."}
{"text":"Best Hot and Sour soup I've ever had.  It was so hearty and tasty.  The service is excellent and they are very attentive. Great spot!  I will be back."}
{"text":"Good food, dirty dishes. This has been my second time eating at this restaurant. I came back because the food is really good. I've had the Cantonese style noodles - delicious and hard to find in the valley. Fried rice, sweet and sour pork/shrimp, walnut shrimp - all amazing. I would give this restaurant 4.5 stars based on the taste of their food, but I can't overlook the fact that my plate was dirty and I had a paper fortune floating in my water. It makes me believe that they don't wash their dishes well and grosses me out a bit. Clean your dishes, you guys have a great restaurant. I'm definitely coming back because the food is really that good. If the dishes are clean, I'll write a better review."}
{"text":"Well, this is a huge bummer. We came here due to good reviews and stumbled upon the buffet. I was a little excited to try different dishes and experience more of the cuisine. I really shouldn't have. The food was cold and not very tasty. Flavor was lacking and honestly I was disappointed that they would serve it that cold. I'm not sure about anything else on the menu but at this point, I wouldn't be interested in trying anything else."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I've had in a long time. Usually I'm not a fan because it's too greasy and heavy, however this place was amazing. Not only was the food great, but so was the staff and overall atmosphere. My drink was never empty, the food was fresh and came out quick, and the waitress was helpful with menu choices. The owner even came over and talked with us for about 10 min. I will def be back."}
{"text":"Best Chinese I've had... Delish!!!  George's seafood pocket is the best appetizer!!! Love the Cantonese chow mein and the festival shrimp is awesome!!! Yum yum! Best Chinese hands down!"}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST chinese food I've ever had, along with excellent service.  We started with the calamari, and were just blown away. These are not the sad little rings you see most places, oh no, these little beauties are 3-4 inches long, as thick as your thumb- and are cooked to perfection. No rubberiness here!  Hubby got thai basil chicken. Beautifully flavored in a rich, spicy sauce, with chicken so mouthwateringly tender it could be cut with a spoon. I got the tres amigos, which is served fajita style on a cast iron skillet. Same mouthwateringly succulent chicken, but with equally tender shrimp and beef tossed with snowpeas, baby corn, carrots, and a few other veggies in a rich brown sauce. While we were eating, the owner's wife came over and asked how we were liking everything, and asked if we'd like to try a sample of general yang's chicken. Of course we said yes! A few minutes later, we experenced the culinary masterpiece that is yang's. Same super tender chicken with extremely light breading- just enough that you get a lovely crunch as you bite down, and covered in szechwan sauce. Everything was perfect, and we are going back tonight for more!"}
{"text":"Came back here begrudgingly with some friends and it's still average.  There was 3 of us and we ordered a lot of food, lettuce wraps (they were tasty average) Grandma's salad (it was ok but I make this type of salad at home that I like better)  I did like the pork chowmein.  Probably because I was craving noodles.   Service is still very good.  The bill for 3 of us came to $96, (2 fountain drinks and a beer included)"}
{"text":"Sunday buffet was good . But a customer behind me had a small white dog I the booth . This is a health code violation And the staff did nothing about it. I will nit be going back. It was not a service animal"}
{"text":"Lunch buffet is worth for the price and the taste varies from proper Asian but it is good. Would suggest to add a dessert item in the buffet which is only a fortune cookie when we visited."}
{"text":"The food and service are ALWAYS immaculate! I always order the house-fried rice (minus the pork), and it's still finger licking good. The Mrs. orders the beef and broccoli with steamed rice, and she's always a happy camper. I wish they sold egg rolls, but whatevs!   Their hospitality is spot on and we'll always return for more."}
{"text":"I love this place. Everything is so good. The staff is friendly. But the food is what really shines. I love love love the chow fun beef and salt and pepper shrimp. Show stoppers!!!! I'm going to keep coming back."}
{"text":"Once again G&S did not disappoint. However, this time along with 8 other family members we had expert guidance from our server Becky. She really helped guide us to dishes that were unique and house specialities with a spin like adding yellow curry to Saigon Noodles. TREAT YOURSELF and try the Calamari as an appetizer...... best ever. 9 people, 9 main dishes, 9 very happy customers."}
{"text":"Just not impressed. Low quality ingredients in my opinion. Rubbery chicken and beef, high prices for the quality. Have been here twice, and there will be no third visit. Sorry George, but you need to improve your food quality."}
{"text":"I recently moved to the Valley and was excited to spend my first Christmas with friends and flip flops. For lunch, we went to Jasmine Tokyo. It. Was. Awesome! They had a wide range of sushi and a nice selection on the buffet. It was overpriced, but it was Christmas. We left there to meet our friend Jim for snacks and cocktails. He wanted to do an \"early dinner\".  He made reservations here. Good thing... Place was packed! I guess all Asian places were packed on Christmas. We weren't hungry, but had a few beers and ordered a few items on the limited menu. I read on Foursquare the chow mein was good. It comes with chicken, shrimp, and pork. The chicken was the highlight of the dish. VERY impressed with the flavor and the price point was average. Oh, and we ordered some spring rolls. The mustard is HOT. You've been warned.   We had a great time, and the service was great. Before you leave, head over to the bar and ask. It's not that bad. (You'll know what I mean.) I would highly recommend this place to friends and family!"}
{"text":"Had take out from here tonight and we were very happy. Food was delicious and prices were comparable to other places. Have been to the restaurant on Via Linda and I am so happy there is now a George & Sons in North Phoenix.  The Tres Amigos and Orange Chicken was awesome!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place for many reasons that have been stated in other reviews I've read. They are all true! Beautiful, clean, and quiet dining area leads to a relaxed dinner with some of the greatest Asian cuisine I've ever had. Portions are huge and I literally always take home leftovers, most times they will give me an extra bucket of rice to go along with my leftovers as well. The fried calamari is delicious and Miona's special chicken is perfect for someone who doesn't like things too spicy (the recipe was also created by the owners wife, who can be seen in the restaurant every night taking care of guests). This is truly a family owned business and this is a family that truly cares about their customers' satisfaction. The wait staff is prompt and polite, they will even box your leftovers for you. They also have a small bar with many many alcoholic options as well as about five televisions, usually tuned to a sports game.   I honestly can't say enough good things about this place, it has been my go to option for Chinese for over two years now and I have never once had a complaint or problem with the service. If I had to choose one problem it would be the pricing, but even that isn't a complaint as I feel the prices justify what you are served, but do be prepared to spend a buck if you are looking for a full, quality meal."}
{"text":"After over a year since my last visit, a friend suggested that we have lunch so I acquiesced to try this place again. They have a lunch buffet for a little over $8.00.  The egg drop soup tasted quite fresh.  Had some tofu in it and was not salty.  Light and flavorful.  They had a variety of dishes including chicken, fish, pork, shrimp, noodles, vegetables, white rice.  I was hoping that they had fried rice since I am not a fan of plain white rice.  My rule is not to eat out something I can make at home and white rice falls into that category.  They also had salad, onion rings, vegetable rolls and fried wonton.  For dessert they had almond cookies and fortune cookies were given with the tab.  Waters were kept full.  The lunch was enjoyable and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"lucky buddah beer is a great brew and the tres amigos was super good, a lot of food for one person to eat. The rice was good quality and the kung poa was excellent and I usually don't like that type of chicken."}
{"text":"We went here because the reviews were very good. It's hard to find good Chinese food, so we were skeptical. Both my wife and I really liked the food, and have gone back at least once. I highly recommend George & Son's. Very good food, inexpensive, clean, and great service. Not like the \"Best Chinese Food\" restaurants you find everywhere. This place is unique and rocks."}
{"text":"Love, Love, Love George and Son's. I used to live near this restaurant, but moved and kinda forgot how good it is. In the past couple years we've been making our way to George and Son's frequently and can confirm that it is better than ever.   I've really never had a bad meal here and I've tried a lot of their menu items. I mostly stick to either a chicken dish or the mongolian beef, but have liked everything else I've had.  In particular I like the general yangs chicken and the mu shu pork. The service is pretty good, there are some language barriers and abruptness at times, but it doesn't prevent me from having a wonderful Chinese meal. I would definitely suggest George and Son's over Flo's, which years ago would have been my top choice.   So, what I am trying to say is go. The food is good and reasonably priced. It's not the best place you will go to ever, but it's solid and consistently good.  Plus they give you a fortune cookie AND almond cookie... who could resist that???"}
{"text":"We chose this place for our annual Christmas Chinese meal after we saw it had four stars on Yelp (better than any other places in Scottsdale). I'd say the food was pretty standard American-Chinese fair. We got hot and sour soup, Kung pao shrimp, spicy eggplant, firecracker pork, and the sun devil chicken. Everything was mediocre and very Americanized. The dishes were sweet rather than spicy.   The service was good and we didn't expect much. Perhaps our tastes for Asian food are a bit refined having lived in New York and Philly but this was nothing to write home about for us."}
{"text":"If you like Dog Food then you will love George & Son's. Their Chicken isn't really chicken. Their food quality is so poor that the food isn't really edible. The noodles taste really old and smells funky. The oil they use has a weird smell and taste to it. The egg rolls taste like they had been in a freezer for years and they grind the meat inside their egg rolls so you can not identify what meat they are actually using. Their is MSG in their food even though they so it is not. I would stay clear of this restaurant"}
{"text":"This place has consistently been taking my money since it's moved in.  The daily lunch specials are the best!!!"}
{"text":"WOW.   Talk about a crazy party for my taste buds!! This place not only has amazing asian cuisine, their service is actually pretty good as well!!  Our family came here for lunch after church. There were 7 of us. We were greeted immediately and got seated; 1-2minutes later waters came out for all of us. We were given a few minutes to look over the menu. Looking around, the place was clean and neat. The decor was appropriate and the tables/chairs encouraged family style. They had a discounted combo lunch menu as well as your typical family style dinner menu.  We had questions about their orange and lemon chicken; the waitress basically said \"well it's lemon sauce on chicken\" lol. I think she was trying to say that its a basic dish.   Anyway, the little sister wanted to try it so we ordered that along with 4 other dishes: walnut shrimp, fire cracker spicy pork, shrimp miona and vegetable delight.  The dishes came out almost all at once. The walnut shrimp is always the first to go in our family; we absolutely love that blend of sweet and salty shrimp. The shrimp miona went next; we might be partial to shrimp at this point.   All the dishes was just perfect. It was delicious and wasnt overwhelmingly spicy. Each dish was also distinct; it wasnt your typical chinese/asian-stir-fry-with-the-same-sauces. Each dish stood out!   As we finished each entree, the server would take each dish away but will also ask if we were finished.   The pricing at this location is also very fair. I am definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I received dirty silverware which was very noticeable without any close inspection. The thought of potentially putting a fork in my mouth containing residue of the pervious user's meal is disgusting to say the least not to mention unsanitary. There simply is no excuse for that type of thing to happen in today's day and time.  Secondly, I ordered the chicken egg foo young which was tasty as usual however I noticed the portion sizes are definitely getting smaller. I am fine with two large sized patties or three smaller patties but not two smaller patties. Also, I requested brown rice instead of the white rice. My meal was brought to the table with what appeared to be barely a cup of brown rice. I actually thought the rice was missing because it usually comes out in a larger steam bowl and not a cup. I asked the waitress who advised me that the rice was underneath the cup. Sure enough, I turned it over and there it was. They up-charge $1.50 for brown rice but then proceed to bring you a 1/3 of the portion size or rice they would bring had you simply of stuck with the white rice. That's actually a negative value in my opinion.  My meal (Egg foo young w/ brown rice) totaled $14.61. The value in my estimate was more like $11-$12. The food is definitely delicious but the value is lacking."}
{"text":"Great selection and great tasting. A throwback to his wonder, albeit simple restaurant years ago on 40 th Street and Camelback Very pleasing decor and very helpful staff I am very happy I found a George run Chinese restaurant again"}
{"text":"Had lunch here with Arlin B.George M.Robyn N.Norm R and Rand H. Well for a small Chinese buffet (17 items) it was a pretty good buffet almost everything I ate was above average except the honey chicken was to sticky and the fish was ok but on the plain side.My only gripe was the only dessert offered was an almond cookie and that cost them the fifth star..But yes this is a good chinese buffet and I look forward to a return visit."}
{"text":"Been here before and re-visit again, food is good and so satisfying. What I like about the restaurant is they modify traditional dishes and add new elements to create new innovative dishes. So I'm always getting pleasant surprises.  This time I had an opportunity trying out a new dish named Shrimp Miaona, It was like popcorn shrimp lightly coated in a sweet & sour sauce with a slight kick of heat.  Before I realized to take a picture of a perfect dish the shrimp gone in no time, which left me no choice but to return on my next trip to capture my favorite dishes for the photo post.  George & Son, you did it again; good as usual and I shall return.....!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed our dinner here. The service was excellent. My boyfriend and I started with potstickers. Very good. He ordered spicy chicken fried rice as his dish. He enjoyed it. I ordered the orange chicken. They gave me fried chicken cutlets with orange sauce and oranges. It wAs a fresh unique twist on the dish. It wAs a huge portion so I had lunch for the next day."}
{"text":"http://georgeandsonsasiancuisine.com/phoenix-location/ Totally awesome. Everything about this place is great. The food is fresh, served the way you want it, and delicious. We had several items and it was all great! Met George and chatted for a while. They've been here 2 years, and I didn't know about them. We will definitely return! Thank you George, for a great evening!"}
{"text":"Great food, its obviously very busy at lunch but what place isn't. I have the fried rice and egg drop soup and was pleased. The one thing I didn't like was that I felt rushed to order and ended up getting something that I probably would not have normally gotten but overall it was good food."}
{"text":"My second time to George and sons  this time i came with my boyfriend and his family from out of town,  the food was incredible, we had chow mein, mooshoo pork, red pork, wor wonton soup, Mongolian beef, and walnut shrimp we all shared family style Evrything was fantastic ambiance was wonderful, and the service was fantastic,  Saturday night they had live music,  You can't go wrong here the food is wonderful  and o so delicious, I will definitely return to this fantastic valley gem, Here is a tip, come with a group order a few things, and share family you will be so happy that you did, come Saturdays as there is love music Don't miss out on this great chineese restaurant,"}
{"text":"Too bad George didn't see fit to comment on our experience of three weeks ago. Well, we've moved on, and will no longer be customers of George & Son's. George, if you're reading this, don't bother to comment, nothing would persuade us to come back. Good Luck to you."}
{"text":"I can only give two stars. The food is good but the staff and service are not. I wanted to substitute fried rice for white rice with my entree. Most places will charge you a dollar or two extra and make the substitution. They would not allow it, only if i bought an additional entree size fried rice. Rude and not customer oriented!"}
{"text":"Everything is delicious here. Especially love the basil chicken. Tried a spicy soup once and it was great. Can't remember what it was. Definitely recommend this place for done in or take out."}
{"text":"Not your typical Chinese restaurant. They have a full bar and I ordered sakes with my meal, which was good. My appetizer was also very good and unique. It was some sort of seafood inside a pie like crust. Main course was a Kao Pung dish that was well prepared. They also served brown rice for an extra charge. We were too late for the lunch buffet, so we enjoyed our early dinner before our spa appointment. I would recommend a visit here. It is always good to find quality local spots when traveling. This is one.."}
{"text":"Just had lunch there, It is the BEST Chinese food on Earth~! Fresh, steaming hot and large servings. . .Kung Pao chicken and Firecracker Shrimp are worth the trip. Champagne Buffet on week-ends is a trip out of town~!"}
{"text":"Second time here. Had to talk my 14 year old into coming because he really wanted Barro's pizza.    We should have gone to Barro's. Hostess was not friendly which should be a requirement for the first face you see in a restaurant. The half red half black hair and lack of care for her own appearance, said she wasn't there for service or hostessing.  The common denominator in all the comments on this site, is poor wait staff, even from \"the son\" of George and Sons.  My son asked for chicken fried rice with no veggies.. Menu states made to order, guess what, had veggies.  No one came to check on us until I was 2/3rds of the way through our meal. A server came by to see if everything was ok, I told her about the rice. She took it away without a word. No apology, no ANYTHING.    The check arrived and still the rice had not been replaced. I'm not paying for it.  Rice came out as we were heading up to pay, let them know I wasn't paying for it.. They seems shocked.  Whatevs. No tip and I'm not coming back until I see reviews posted AFTER THIS ONE, that they all took courses in how to treat a guest for a better tip."}
{"text":"I ordered from there on tuesday night. The person that helped me at the front was awesome and nice. However I didn't like the food. I had read the  yelp reviews. But I was opened minded. I got the General Yangs chicken.  The chicken was dry, and not alot of sauce to go with it. Sauce was tasteless per say with a hint of a kick at the end. I may try something else if I go a next time"}
{"text":"Excellent food, good service.  Its nice to find an authentic chinese food restaurant instead of panda express and samurai sams!  We used to order from a place called the pink lotus but its not there anymore, their food was good but not as good as the food at George and sons."}
{"text":"Service was wonderful.  Phad Thai not that great."}
{"text":"Well...this place was my 'go-to'...but thanks to the rancid hot oil they served me last night, we will not be back.  I suppose I cannot say for certain, but I figure I contracted food-poisoning there last night. I had not eaten since breakfast. My wife and I shared all the dishes we ordered...but I alone ate the hot oil I had requested; My bowels began complaining painfully within two hours after the meal. And a long, 'busy' night ensued. Thank God for wide-spectrum probiotics!"}
{"text":"Let me first rant for a second.  Boy do I hate the term \"Asian Cuisine.\"  What a generic term for what is really many many many different types of food.  Real Chinese food (hell, even Americanized Chinese food) is very different from real Japanese food is very different from real Thai food is very different from real Korean food is very different from real Vietnamese food. . .you get the picture.   To proclaim that your restaurant serves \"Asian\" food to me says \"we serve generic food\" since it is difficult to master one of these cuisines let alone all of them.   Furthermore, I'm used to Chinese restaurants with some or all of the following in their name -   \"Happy\", \"Joy\", \"Grand\", \"Dragon\", \"Wok\", \"Inn\".  George and Sons sounds more like a deli or a pub or something.    Anyway, on a lazy Sunday evening, still a bit burnt from the previous night of partying, my husband and I were looking for some quick, easy, greasy food to fill our bellies that would put us to sleep.   So we picked George and Sons, being that it is so close.  Indeed, the food was all rather generic exactly as I had figured going in.   We ordered take out and the portions were definitely not large enough to warrant the price they charge, and the food can best be described as bland.  The broth in the wonton soup was pretty much straight chicken broth with no flavor and, worse, there was so much spinach in it that the last few sips tasted like the run off when you defrost one of those frozen bricks of spinach from the grocery store.   The spring roll was decent enough but small, and they didn't give us any duck sauce for dipping (is that standard here?).  The steamed chicken and veggies didn't have baby corn or water chestnuts which I thought were standards of this dish.   The beef and broccoli and house chow mein again were pretty bland (hell, the term \"chow mein\" itself basically means \"generic noodle dish\").  As far as Chinese takeout, George and Sons serves overpriced average food."}
{"text":"Average at best.  The food is some of the best in Scottsdale for Asian, but it clearly does not come close to Asian in Chicago, San Francisco or any other major city I have been to.  The service is okay, it's clearly a family run restaurant that's why we go back.  They seem to do a good take out business, better than eat-in as it's usually empty when we get there.  It's good in a pinch!"}
{"text":"Tonight I dined at George & Son's Asian Cuisine for the first time. I looked up their menu online, which was convenient, but the menu at the restaurant was much larger. My husband and I decided on two chicken dishes: teriyaki and orange. When the waitress took our order, she told me that it was not a good choice because both have a sweet sauce. She told me I should order a beef dish or a noodle dish instead. She was quite stern about this, and I was a bit taken back, so I ordered the Festival chicken instead. I realized as I waited for my food that I had no clue as to what I had ordered. Lucky for them, it was actually pretty good. The \"breaded\" chicken is really a battered/deep fried chicken, but it is crispy. And the teryaki was not too salty. Overall, the meal was a success. George made his rounds to the tables, and boxed up the remainder of our meal for us himself. He even offered to fill our takeout box with more rice from the back. I found him much more enjoyable than our waitress. Bottom line: I will most likely come back. Next time, though, I am getting the orange chicken."}
{"text":"I love George and sons. The food was really fresh and hot. The servers are really on top of what you need. I will be back soon"}
{"text":"Fabulous food and staff.  Very quick service, incredible presentation on the food, great value.  We will be back.  Quan / AKA Becky was efficient and nice as could be.  Thank you"}
{"text":"You know it's good when the won ton soup doesn't taste like lake water! Honestly best Chinese food restaurant I've eaten at in years. And I've eaten at many the were okay!"}
{"text":"My wife and i have been looking for a place that has great walnut shrimp and chow mein. We found this place in yelp and it was a success!! We gad the calamari mixed chow mein and walnut shrimp and they were all really good. An added bonus is that they were super fast from order to having our dinner on our table. They have a great atmosphere for a date night.  We will be returning often!!"}
{"text":"5 star, no question!  Excellent food, great wine. The staff takes great care to treat customers like family. I highly recommend this restaurant with a special shout out to Miona and Joe for always making our visits special!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Prompt service. If you ask for tea, it's not your typical black leaf. It's a green tea fusion that is awesome! The Gramma Salad is terrific: light and spicy. Definitely coming back for more."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place!  Drove by there yesterday at noon and saw their sign for lunch specials $7.95.  I didn't have time to stop but talked the family into trying it for dinner last night.  We are hooked!  We started off with the potstickers.  Let me just say that these are the closest things to PF Changs potstickers, which are my favorite!  For dinner we tried a few different things .. The house lo-mein with shrimp, chicken, pork, and veggies.  Delicious .. the sauce was perfect and the meat was cooked perfectly.  Sun Devil chicken .. not many places have this dish, so when we find it we always try it.  This is by far the best we've ever had!  We asked the waitress, who was very friendly and helpful by the way .. what she would recommend for the kids.  She said the Miona's chicken was a favorite.  Now it's a favorite of ours!  Lightly breaded chicken with a sweet and sour type sauce.  We will definitely be back!  Fresh food, all made in-house, no pre-made food.  Super friendly staff, and very clean!"}
{"text":"Best pork fried rice I've had in years. Good price, quick and friendly service. Yummmmm!"}
{"text":"This place has the best Asian food ever this is the only place my wife will eat out for Asian food the only place"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the lunch buffet. The food was fresh for a Chinese buffet which was all I needed to know.   I didn't eat as much as I could've but I'll try again I'm sure.."}
{"text":"I live 2 minutes away from this restaurant and have been here a couple times for dinner. No Happy Hours, so, if you want a drink, don't be surprised that it's not cheap. But I get a drink every time I go anyway.   Let's talk about food first. I always come here for one dish only, the Mandalay chicken noodles. Period. It's delicious. It's a dish that is made with Asian rice noodles, coconut cream and a lot of spices. It's very creamy and rich but spicy at all. You also get tons of chicken out of it. I always order one, eat half of  it, then bring the other half to work the next day.   My friend on other hand has tried their Mongolian beef (he always gets this too) and he liked it.   Drinks: I have tried the \"Chi\" and the Pina Colada. they are around 9 to 10 dollars, a bit pricey but have decent taste.   Service was good. sometimes it gets sort of slow even though the place is not crowded at all. But we always come here to chill, so waiting a bit is not a problem."}
{"text":"Easily as tasty as any restaurant I've tried in LA's Chinatown!!! You need this food in your life! My husband would recommend the pot stickers and I ordered the baked scallop & crab meat... Yum!!! is all I can say!! We'll definitely be back!!! Excellent service, too!"}
{"text":"4 to 2 stars after 4 to 5 visits there is no consistency in taste specially for Thai basil chicken which happens to be the dish which brought me again last time I had to send it back and order another dish. This time it's ok not that bad not that delicious either. I might not come back again..."}
{"text":"Only one word sums up this food - -  AWFUL!!  We ordered ninety dollars worth of take out.  What a waste of money!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  The quality and consistency are what keep me coming back.  The sweet and sour....it doesn't matter what you choose....is the BEST around.  All of the noodles are fantastic, all of the rice...great.  If you care about the sides, you care about the entrees! Am I right?! *High Five*  Thanks!"}
{"text":"We have hit this place a few times for take-out and dine-in - every time was fantastic! Orange Chix is a big favorite (it's not the cheap nuclear orange version). Chix is crispy and covered in a rich sauce with a nice kick of heat. Twice cooked pork also has a great layer of heat. Pot stickers are plump and juicy too. Portions are large and a good balance of protein and veggies. Overall, a great place to satisfy any Asian food craving!"}
{"text":"Stopped at George and Sons for an early dinner before our flight out of phoenix. Didn't have high expectations but were pleasantly surprised. The food was very tasty and authentic, with a bit of flare since it is a fusion restaurant after all. Very well decorated and service was superb."}
{"text":"The food is always tasty. Service is timely and servers are attentive. Also, good value for the money."}
{"text":"Finding excellent Chinese is always a challenge. So happy to find George and sons! The shrimp with pecans and the lemon chicken were phenomenal. Definitely worth a trip"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience!   I dined here while visiting family in Scottsdale. It was quiet when we arrived and were seated. There were some other tables enjoying drinks and food. We were glad we got our order in when a large table of golfers arrived.  The food was great. It was my first time trying egg foo young. It's a new favorite of mine.   George himself ended up buying our table a round of drinks!! They were nice and strong without compromising flavor.  Overall, We had a great time and loved the food. Next time I'm in Scottsdale I'll be sure to dine here."}
{"text":"I'm a person that never writes reviews but I was so impressed by the friendly staff and the food was excellent.  To me this place is a 10 and I will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Lunch buffet was delicious!! Great meal and service."}
{"text":"We love this place.  The service is great, very friendly.  My preference leans toward the spicier dishes.  I personally find some of the less spicy dishes to be a little bland, but they do taste good.    The Tom Yum soup is absolutely amazing.  It's spicy enough to make your nose run, and if it was all they served, I'd go there just for the soup.  We get an order of it to go for the next day."}
{"text":"Food was delish!  Several families there on Sunday afternoon for the buffet. Service was okay."}
{"text":"Very standard Phoenix Chinese.  Pot stickers were warm and not very hot.  Also the bottoms were crispy.  We shared beef fried rice and orange chicken.  The orange chicken was too sweet and the rice was somewhat mushy.  Ambiance is nice and service was decent, not exceptional but not bad either.  Would I go back probably, but I wouldn't say oh hey let's go to that mediocre average chinese place."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this strip-center gem!   We don't have a ton of great non-chain food options in this area, but Yelp came to my rescue once again.  My husband and I both agreed that they did a nice job with the decor, helping you to forget that you were nestled in a large shopping center next to a movie theatre.   Unfortunately, we arrived too late for happy hour - we will have to aim earlier next time!  We ordered citrus chicken, kung-pao beef, and spicy fried rice.  The citrus chicken was delightful!  Crisp, with bright lemon flavor, and a fantastic choice.  They accidentally brought kung-pao chicken instead of beef, but it was still super tasty.  When they discovered their mistake (we had already eaten half of it), they insisted on making a brand new one for us.  We appreciated the effort, and were glad to have extra food to take home.  The spicy fried rice was yummy too - chiles and jalapeños made it just spicy enough to be interesting.   We will definitely return - and soon!"}
{"text":"Great dinner...we are so glad George and Son's headed West and now has a location in the West Valley.  We would highly recommend the kung pao 3 Seas dish."}
{"text":"Right when I entered this place I was in shock. The place is just beautiful I fell in love with the colors they have the bar inside with the drinks coming out of the wall. It was just a perfect sized small restaurant that's family owned.i walked in and a girl took me to a table. I had multiple waiters I don't even know who got my tip. Haha every time one waiter would come to another table he would also go to others to check on people. I even had the girl upfront come ask me how everything was and she went and got me a refill I don't even think she's suppose to do that. I ordered Citrus chicken and the calamari appetizer. The Citrus chicken was okay I saw it on Yelp someone suggested it but it's nothing to WOW about but I liked the way it tasted. The Calamari appetizer was just incredible. I was in shock it was huge easily can be shared with one more person. All of it was tasty and the food came out hot and fast. The owner I wanna say also came up to me and asked if everything is okay. I love the family feel I know everything has to be perfect. She was talking to every customers and I can tell she has regulars because of how long she was talking to them and how she greeted some of them. This place is just amazing. Can't wait to try some more things here. Good place to take family or friends or get some carry out!"}
{"text":"I got takeout and was impressed. I usually don't like Asian fare but it was great. The kung pao beef was tasty and not greasy like most places. We also liked the firecracker pork. Rice was a bit al dente for me. I will return to try more dishes."}
{"text":"New(er) to town, we had to take a chance on picking a chinese place on a lazy saturday night.  we got the number and menu from the phone book, and yelped it in our usual style to see that it was good news.    we got crab wontons, chicken chow mein, pu pu platters, and sesame chicken.  wantons and chow mein - A + - really good and impressive for to-go Chinese.  the pu pu platter was good, but surprisingly small.  the sesame chicken was just odd, delicious, but odd - with the runny funny sauce being put on the side - this with no explanation from the hostess chick.  no fortune cookies - wtf mate? - had to ask for soy sauce with an order of white rice to get two little packets (sad).  but littler things, in comparison to the well portioned, fresh tasting, yummy as heck Chinese places I've had in a while, does not compare.  I'd only mention to watch out for the front hostess/pick up girl - she just seemed overwhelmed and lacked focus; after watching her mess up one order, deliver the guy's who'd order had been messed up the last, mix up two different parties and question our phone number 3 times - we were sure to check our food and ask 3 more times for extra soy sauce.    Sum it - good Chinese food for a good price (15-25 per person) not too far away, and really good as leftovers!!!"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly Chinese dining. They have lunch combos or the traditional family style entrees. The Pad Thai comes in one option but the flavor is amazing. If you want it spicy, ask them or add chili oil. Good prices and potions to fill you up."}
{"text":"Not an impressive performance and George is a rude little man. When asked if we could substitute fried rice for white rice, he practically jumped down our throats and said no substitutions. It was a Nazi soup guy related performance, but his Chinese food is just nasty. The chicken honey walnut was a mix of some very poor tasting fried chicken strips loaded with a no tasting white sauce, It literally tasted like nothing, but was goopy, sticky and pure white if that's any positives for you. Beyond that, the greasy egg rolls and stale tasting egg drop soup just completed this horrible lunch experience. The other funny part is that all the employees look like they could pass for George's son, not kidding, check it out, but don't eat here."}
{"text":"So sad when you want to give a restaurant your money and all they want to do is close ! I came in one hour before they closed and they had no hot tea and we felt so rushed I guess we should have left."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, great service and very reasonable prices, this will be our new hangout for good Chinese food."}
{"text":"Very nice place to eat. The service is great and he food is amazing. The setting is very relaxing!!"}
{"text":"I've to say that I haven't had this good of a Chinese in a really long time! I've been to China twice and this comes the closest to authentic. I'm just visiting Arizona and man I wish I had this restaurant in my state I would go 2-3 times a week"}
{"text":"The interior was of high quality grade, gorgeously designed even the lighting gave it a nice ambiance. The food was great, had the chow mein and orange chicken. The bar was mesmerizing and also nicely designed. A lot of thought went into this restaurant, and I can appreciate that. They have a great beer selection too! But the service was mediocre. Our server wasn't attentive."}
{"text":"The lunch buffet is better than average.  Definitely smaller, but you get some quality food.  I wouldn't say that this is the best chinese food I've had but it's better than most."}
{"text":"If you are looking for AMAZING food and wonderful service, go to George & Son's!! Ever since I've left the area, I've been searching for a restaurant that will satisfy my cravings for savory Asian food like: Salt & Pepper Shrimp, Shrimp with Honey Glazed Walnuts, Special Chicken/Shrimp, Sizzling Rice soup, Hot and Sour Soup, Spicy Pork, General Yang's Chicken, Chow Mein, Lemon Chicken, Orange Beef, Crab Puffs, House fried rice and the list goes on and on. I have yet to find a restaurant that has so many GREAT dishes! Not to mention great music, ambiance and staff... It's at the top of my list for best local businesses in the Phoenix area.    If you're lucky enough to catch George and Miona there, introduce yourself! They're great = )  Website: http://georgeandsons.com/"}
{"text":"Food was dull, tasteless, and uninspired. The buffet was pushed hard but the trays were mostly empty. The dishes were named as to pork, beef, chicken, etc. but no other designation as to which were the spicy dishes, or, how the protein was prepared. I passed on the buffet and went for a lunch plate. There was a language problem with our server leaving me to believe the Wor WonTon soup was available as soup of the day. This was not the case when she brought me egg drop soup and when I asked was told it was the soup of the day. Very confusing as I would have paid for an order of the soup I wanted rather then be subjected to the dishwasher liquid flavored egg drop soup. I took a few tastes and gave up on it. My citrus chicken, ungarnished, arrived with the smallest vegetable spring roll I have ever seen. It tasted OK as did the small crab puff. The sauce was tangy and flavorful but the chicken was dry and overcooked. From reading the reviews I ordered the NY Egg Roll. Greatly disappointed in this as it in no way tasted like a NY Egg Roll. I should know as I am a native NYer and have been eating Egg Rolls since I was 10. This egg roll was very dry, how possible, I have no idea. DH ate it slathered in sauce and said it was just OK. DH had the buffet and said it was OK but could not tell me which dish he liked best. He said it pretty much was all the same to him as he slathered everything in sweet and sour mixed with the mustard to get some taste out of it. To be fair I did see them bring out some additional buffet trays. The food wasn't horrible but wasn't good either. The highlight of my meal consisted of the iced tea and the steamed rice. My expectations were most likely too high which made my disappointment all the more. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Consistently good, hot and well priced dishes. Watch out for the noon lunch rush....ger there between 1100-1130 otherwise the corporate offices near by flood in with sit downs and to go orders. For those of you that might remember, this was previously the Bamboo Grill. The menu is similar and there in spirit but I still wish they used some of the old owners techniques and dishes. Clean and space between tables make it a nice change to other Asian places in the local area."}
{"text":"Since moving to Phoenix, I have been searching for a good Asian Restaurant.  This is it.  The lunch special is phenomenal for $7.95.  You get alot of food. Would like to include sweet and sour sauce for the egg roll and wonton though.  As one person mentioned, I also wish they would substitute the egg drop soup at lunch.  I'd be willing to pay more. Their won ton is fabulous.  The dinners are a little pricey.  They serve a good sized portion of food but no soup included.  That would be a nice touch. It's very tasty and good quality. They also serve sticky rice which most restaurants no longer do.  Yay!"}
{"text":"We have found our favorite Chinese food place! The establishment is welcoming. Owner is engaging with customers, he makes you feel welcomed.   Our favorite dishes are Citrus Chicken ; which is perfectly crisp, and mouth watering! Spicy Fried Rice, just the right amount of spice and the combined ingredients are amazing with chicken! Kung Pao Beef; another crisp dish that is one of kind! We have visited many locations in search for the crispy beef, and this place has mastered it!"}
{"text":"Excellent Chinese food at good prices. I've been meaning to try the lunch buffet I've heard good things about, but have just been a handful of times for dinner. Cantonese Chow Mein was wonderful. Festival Shrimp was delicious. Highly recommended to anyone looking for great Chinese food."}
{"text":"The best in town! Flo's is closer to home and is not bad BUT George and Son is way worth the extra drive. The food is the most important thing in a restaurant to me and George and Son has simply the best Chinese food I have ever had. The bonus is the service. Always friendly and fast. George himself is usually there and he has a way of making everyone feel special like a VIP. Now they also have entertainment on Fridays and Saturdays its a blast"}
{"text":"Best Wonton Soup in the valley.  We have dined here 3 times now and great food and service every time.  Sweet and sour pork is my husbands favorite. But we have also enjoyed the Mongolian beef (we requested it be spicy)    I will definitely be ordering wonton soup for takeout more often when the weather cools off."}
{"text":"Today I had one of my best dining experiences in the Valley, and it was a lunch buffet - and this is what the review is for; the establishment is mainly a full-service restaurant. Of course it helped that I was with delightful company - fellow yelpers Rand, Mike, Robyn, Arlin, and Georgie. It also helped that the restaurant has a cozy atmosphere, very friendly service, and a pleasant contemporary vibe. But it was the food that totally blew me way - it was so good! There were not as many items as you would see in a super buffet, and this restaurant is not trying to be one. But every item that they do serve is cooked to tasty perfection - the succulent slices of beef, the crisp stir-fried vegetables, the crunchy spring rolls and onion rings, the awesome egg flower tofu soup, the best fish fillets I've  ever had ... everything was superb! I'm normally pretty good at portion control when dining out, but that went out the window this time around. It was so worth the long drive from my area in northwest Phoenix. Thanks, Rand, for introducing me to this stellar place!"}
{"text":"We had lunch today at George and Sons and it was excellent! We cleaned our plates and would have licked them if no one was watching! Service was excellent and we're sorry we missed the lunch time menu but the dinner menu was outstanding anyway. The  hot and sour soup was delicious. The only negatives were the tea could have been a little stronger and they are slightly on the pricey side but definitely worth it! Would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Found this place thanks to Yelp while vacationing in Scottsdale! We stopped in for dinner Sunday night, the restaurant was clean, good service and the food was pretty good. Veggies in our dishes tasted very fresh and we were very happy with our chow mein and Kung Pao chicken. Crab wontons were good too."}
{"text":"George and Son's is very good.  Went there on Christmas afternoon (with a reservation).  They were hopping but they did have one or two tables open.  They had a special Christmas menu that had something for everyone.  Started off with the calamari and it was fantastic!  We also had the pot stickers...they were also good (but not as good as the calamari).  Our table had the chicken chow mien, the General Changes Chicken and Orange Peel Chicken. All were excellent and had plenty of left overs.  George came over and gave us a plate of the fried pork for no change and had me wishing I ordered that because it was great.  This will continue to be our go to Chinese food in the north valley."}
{"text":"Lunch buffet is not everyday like they have advertised. I would have gone somewhere else if I knew the buffet was no longer going on."}
{"text":"Very good Chinese food, especially for the west side. There just isn't any good Chinese in this area. This place is very good and excellent service."}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten here three Fridays in a row. Each time it's fantastic, and each time we see something else we want to try. But, everything we've tried is so tasty it's hard to deviate and order something new. The Spicy Crackling Calamari is delicious, not overly breaded and perfectly fried, and the sauce is an excellent compliment. There's enough that it could be an entree. My wife is a soup lover, and says the egg drop soup is the best she's had. The first time she tried it, we didn't even order it. A nice woman (manager it seemed, but I am not sure) said they'd just made a batch and had an extra cup - now my wife says whenever she's sick I have to pick some up for her.  My favorite main dish so far is the Kung Pao Chicken (ordered extra spicy). The orange chicken is another winner, it is not the sugar saturated orange chicken many places serve, It's light, well seasoned, with a hint of orange from an excellent sauce.  Annnnd the General Yang's Chicken, also awesome. Not quite as spicy as the Kung Pao,  it falls on the sweeter end of the spectrum.  The food is marvelous, the service friendly, and the atmosphere pleasant. Give this place a try, you'll likely want to come back -- probably a lot."}
{"text":"I love the cuisine in the original George & Son restaurant in Scottsdale, so I decided to check this newly-opened branch in north Phoenix. It is conveniently located in the Deer Valley Towne Square shopping complex along the 101, flanked by 27th Avenue and 31st Avenue; the restaurant is closer to the 31st Avenue end. The interior of the restaurant is spacious, with modern decor, and has a full bar. And you'll be hard-pressed to find friendlier staff anywhere! The menu offers familiar Chinese restaurant items and the food is prepared in the same delicious flavoring style and with similar friendly prices as the original restaurant along Via Linda in Scottsdale. I'm glad they opened this branch since I often come to this area for movies at the AMC in the complex and for shopping in the nearby Costco, and now have a really decent place to eat and relax during such trips."}
{"text":"Really great people working here. Hot & Sour Soup was very good. The sauce that smothered the Mixed Vegetables was too dark in soy for my tastes ... this dish is served in a garlic white sauce in most places, which I prefer. The previously last time i was in was probably 18 months ago but my server remembered me and, since I was alone, sat down in my booth and started chatting me up. Some may be put off by this but she is a dear and I was disappointed to learn she is married!"}
{"text":"OK I've moved here from California and I am finding it difficult to find excellent Thai food but I do like the Pad Thai at this place"}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Its so hard to find great Chinese food in the valley, and now we found it!..I will definitely tell everyone about this place...great food, nice atmosphere, and excellent service. We tried 5 items, all were outstanding...have to say bye bye PF Chang's!! This place knocks it out of the park!"}
{"text":"Been in Arizona for 20 years and this is the best Chinese food we've had, the restaurant is clean the service prompt staff all have a smile loved it will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Huge portions! Great service too. They even do special requests with no problem. I will be back with a bigger appetite."}
{"text":"Where do I even begin on George and Son's. I guess I can start by saying, the only reason I would chose another nearby Asian restaurant over George's is because I am having a really bad hair day or feeling anti-social. Everyone in this place knows your name, your story, and will stop to say hello and ask you how your mom and dad are doing - zero exaggeration. Amazing food, friendly service, the kind of neighborhood feel you'd expect more of a sports bar over fine Asian dining.   Favorites: Gramma's Salad (trust me on this one, and get it with chicken). Shrimp with honey glazed walnuts. Potstickers. Crab Puffs. Cantonese chow mein (though sometimes we go light ginger on this dish). Ma Po Tofu. Szechwan string beans. I could go on.. but I think that's sufficient.   They do deliver, and takeout, and have a full bar. and how could I forget - buffet.  Last weekend, I wanted George's buffet so badly I made a CAPSLOCK style shouting facebook status in attempts to recruit just one innocent bystander to accompany me to the feast to end all feasts.. and I couldn't find a soul to go with me. Made me really wonder if i needed to get some new friends. Where my foodies at!?"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Phoenix.  Food is fresh and flavorful. Prices are more than fair.   Service makes George & Son a fun experience.   The spicy tofu with Asian veggies was among the best I've ever had.  Want to try a new treat?  Give the Spinach Fried Rice a go.  Its green color is a little jarring, but once you taste it, you'll realize it could be plaid and you wouldn't care.  It is very tasty indeed.  One piece of advice:  Be prepared to take home leftovers for the next day.  The portions are ginormous."}
{"text":"I've been regularly eating at George & Son's for years now. I'd say I'm knowledgeable about their food, and let me tell you, it's pretty damn amazing. The staff is friendly (although a few of them are difficult to understand), and although the place is frequently packed, the service is still pretty good.  Some of the best dishes here are the General Yang's Chicken with the green beans and white rice and, of course, the all-inclusive lunchtime buffet. Also, if you order an appetizer, Do Not pass up the Pu Pu Platter."}
{"text":"Sooooo good. My family and i always get take out from here, and unlike other restaurants, our orders are always correct. And its pretty cheap for the amount of food you get"}
{"text":"Crrab puffs and walnut shrimp i love the most .. The owner is a very nice affable person.. Love the lunch menu a lot!!!"}
{"text":"I've gotten delivery from George and Son's before, but we dined in the other night and as usual, it did not disappoint.  Food was really good, as was the service. Once they got a little busy the staff seemed a little overwhelmed but still good service overall.  Great neighborhood Chinese place:  check it out!"}
{"text":"Over priced. Ordered to go and what I got a entree and soup for $23 that's a lot I can go to a buffet and pay less and eat more then I bought. The veggies where huge they did not cut them small. Not the best I had. Maybe will try it again dine in. The egg drop soup was okay. Different then most places."}
{"text":"If I could give this place negative stars I seriously would. This place is the absolute worst Asian/Chinese restaurant. I ordered the Pad Thai for take out. After viewing the menu I asked for no Shrimp. The menu also stated \"all dishes can be tailored to your taste\". This however was horrifically incorrect. I asked to have green onions and bean sprouts added. They said they didn't have any bean sprouts when I arrived however I was charged an extra dollar. The menu did not state that tofu was part of the dish. However the main \"protein\" in the Pad Thai was tofu. SMH  Basically their menu was very inaccurate.   The women who assisted with the phone order and in the restaurant was extremely rude and had zero customer service skills.   I have never in my life had to return a take out meal and this place forced me to. This was caused by the falsifying menu, appalling customer service and downright revolting food."}
{"text":"Great retaurant...very personal owner....food was fine. Nice ambience and no TV's. You actually can enjoy a conversation."}
{"text":"Looking to cure your Chinese food craving!? Look no further than George and Son's. I think its safe to say this is my favorite Chinese food. Its better and cheaper than P.F. Changs, with all the cuteness and great selections. But a little more money than your average take out Chinese place, and obviously way better food. I usually pick my order up to eat at home but I have also eaten inside. I highly recommend doing both! The interior of this place is perfect! Little tables and bench seating through out, with a nice bar in the back. The service is very attentive and polite. And on most day's you will probably run into the owner or one of the family members. You can tell they are very proud of their business and love their customers. They will even come over to make sure the you are being taken care of.   As for the food, they have the best chicken. All their Fried chicken dishes are white meat, lightly breaded, thin, crispy, fried, tender chicken. Every piece is perfect. My absolute favorite is the MIONA's SPECIAL CHICKEN. It has a sweet, tangy flavor with some spice to it. Its very unique but totally delicious! Always the perfect amount of sauce. It's I get 90% of the time. The dinner entrée is most definitely enough to feed 2 people and comes with brown or white rice. I have had a few or their soup's as well. The Egg Drop, of course a classic, but still one of my favorites. I really love because it has crunch, thanks to the little Water Chestnuts they put in there. Just recently I had the VEGETABLE CHOW MEIN. It was covered in broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, snap peas, and onions. The noodles were thick and perfectly cooked with just the right amount of sauce. Honestly... I just don't think there is any way to go wrong here. I think I'd be willing to try anything on the menu and be confident that its going to be good.   This place is open on the Holiday's and it has become a tradition for me and my husbands to come Christmas night, sit at the bar, have a cocktail and enjoy some delicious Chinese to escape the crazy families of ours. You wouldn't believe how busy it is, but we love it. So we will see you soon George and Son's!"}
{"text":"George & Son's has one of the best Buffets in the Valley!  A group of us came here for the Lunch Buffet last Thursday.  Our merry Yelp'ers included our ring leader Rand H, along with Robyn N, Mike C, Norm R and Arlin B.  For some reason, I thought the place opened at 11 am (it's 11;30) and arrived early.  On the plus side, it afforded me the opportunity of watching as they setup.  It was impressive.  One of the weaknesses of the buffet concept is the inability of keeping food hot and fresh.  Chinese food, particularly Schezuan which has thicker sauces lends itself well to this steam-warming method.    WHAT MAKES GEORGE & SON'S SPECIAL? It is their method of preparing and putting out a only small amount of food at one time.  Though they have a setup for eight dishes, which is always in use. They are constantly rotating the food items, as the Cook prepares more.   Look at the photos and you'll see the smaller, more manageable size.  Given the nearly dozen or so dinners, in addition to our group, nothing was left for very long anyway.  I started with the tossed salad, with a light ranch dressing.  Next, I tried the Tofu Vegetable Soup(photo) which was outstanding and delicious.  The flavor was subtle and I left wanting to order some for later.    Next to the buffet, they had some deep fried onion rings, mushroom, and other veggies in a beer, rather than tempura batter. It too had a nice flavor.  As for the entrees, I found the Sauteed Shrimp and Onions(photo), and the Honey Chicken(photo) that stuck to the top of my mouth the best. As you took the Honey Chicken, you could see the silk thread like strands of honey attached to the serving tongs.  You cannot get anything fresher than that!  But, everything they made was very good.  The bill came to $9.75 before tip, but including taxes.  As I mentioned in my Yelp Tip, if you come here and check-in, you will get 15% off your next meal.  A nice incentive.    The restaurant came close to Five Stars.  But in the end, I felt the Four Star, \"Yay! I'm a fan\" was more on the mark.  Keep in mind, the Lunch Buffet starts at 11:30, Monday through Friday!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Another visit to see George, with equal success. I brought a coworker and he ordered Orange Chicken whilst I ordered Yang's Chicken again.   Our server brought soup very quickly. It was pretty standard egg drop soup. Our entrées arrived soon after we finished our soup.   The lunch special comes with a small veggie egg roll that is forgettable but the rest of the meal, oh my. My coworker said four to five times: \"This is probably the best Chinese I've ever had,\" as he cleaned his plate. The entrée also comes with rice, lo mien, a single Crab Rangoon and the main.   My Yang's chicken was crispy yet tender on the inside. The sauce was exceptional, with perfect sweet to heat balance.   Our server was very attentive despite a very full floor. I highly recommend George and Sons for really good Chinese food."}
{"text":"Possibly the best chinese food I've had. Way better than PFChangs. Dumplings started off the delicious meal. Thai chicken with Basil was the best! Husband had Cantonese shrimp chicken  stir fry but my Thai basil chicken was what he grabbed and cleaned the big dish! The white rice was steamed perfectly and device was very good. So well worth every penny."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. The food is excellent and the service is exceptional! I've never been to a place with better service. The waitresses are friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"This spot was great. The food was fresh and just what we wanted. The service was very prompt and friendly. The prices were good and it's a cute atmosphere. This will be our go to restaurant for Chinese."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant for the first time. Upscale decor with a nice bar. We tried the Thai Curry Chicken, was good but could be hotter for my taste buds. Also had the Miona's Special Chicken,  sweet and spicy, just right. Both dishes served with a delicious egg drop soup as a starter,  dish served with white rice, vegetable egg roll,  lo meIn noodles and tasty crab puff. $8 for most lunch items. WE WILL BE BACK SOON."}
{"text":"In a strip mall, you are pleasantly surprised with the modern chic and fashionable decor. Nice full bar, great service and the best Hot & Sour Soup EVER!!!! The food is traditional but with little tweeks (good ones). Only sad that we don't live in AZ and couldn't  take the leftovers home. Next time in town-well be back!"}
{"text":"Pros: Clean restaurant.  Great food.  Friendly staff. Close to home.   Con: No delivery...but worth the drive."}
{"text":"We stopped here for a late lunch this afternoon. The place was fairly empty so the service was quick. We ordered lunch specials; citrus chicken, chicken chow mien, and curry chicken. Everyone was happy with their meals but it was nothing amazing. The crab wonton was fantastic but no one cared for the spring roll. Lunch for 3 was about $31.00 before tip.  The place was clean but the endless Billy Joel music was a turn off. I'm a fan, but unless I am at a concert I need some variety in my music.  We went back here for dinner last night (3/5/16) and I am glad we did. The food was very good, as was the service. They even brought us out a sample while waiting to order of their Thai chicken. There were 5 of us so we ordered quite a bit of food and everything was good. My orange beef was a bit too sweet and after a couple bites I couldn't eat any more but it was still tasty. The orange chicken was my favorite dish on the table.   The Billy Joel music is still on but it was pretty loud there last night so it wasn't as noticeable."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Asian restaurants I have ever been to. The shrimp with black bean sauce was to die for, this is not your typical Asian restaurant. It's also well lit, clean, and the noise level is minimal. The menu is standard Chinese type dishes, by if the rest are like mine, they are different from hat you'd be used to because the quality and taste are amazing. Come experience Chef George and Son's cuisine for yourself!"}
{"text":"Oh dear where do I start? Well to start off it is located in a great area with plenty to do before or after dinner. The restaurant is very nice and clean with a wonderful staff. Ordering can be difficult because everything sounds so delicious. What I had was the house LoMaine and there were no leftovers . I wish I would have taken pictures but unfortunately my stomach couldn't wait. I should probably mention I actually ordered food delivery for dinner that night. I discovered Postmates offered delivery for them. Please don't judge . All I can say is you must try this place. It is so good."}
{"text":"I have recently discovered George and Son..very nice contemporary Chinese cuisine. The classics taste great..the hot and sour soup is both original and memorable. The service has been very efficient and George is a funny presence who clearly loves his business and takes care of his customers. It's been worth the drive and I'll definitely return!"}
{"text":"We ordered for pickup. Order was ready on time and it was as good as I expected according to the other the reviews.  I ordered 4 items for 4 people and asked if that would be enough for 4 people. The waiter said yes of course. So that impressed me that he was honest about that. And there was more than enough food. It was very good.  The restaurant seemed to be very clean and the waiter that took my phone call waited on me at the restaurant for pickup.    We had in house dinner for 4  sweet and sour pork, beef chow mein, Mongolian beef and orange chicken. Perfect again.  Plenty of food. Service was impeccable."}
{"text":"We ordered takeaway here for the first time. The spring rolls were fried, a bit of a surprise, but tasty. The shrimp curry entree had a bit of heat, but the low-carb chicken and veggies had no flavor at all (probably our own mistake).  Food was fresh, we were just wanting more spice in the dishes."}
{"text":"My wife and I live around the corner, hadn't eaten here in a few months. We got food for take out, Mongolian beef,kung po chicken,pad Thai noodles.  Mongolian beef, there were more white onions then scallions and it was very bland. Kung po chicken,lots of white meat chicken the whole dish only had one peanut and the taste of this dish was non existent. Very very Blah... Pad Thai noodles,the dish was dry and came out of the container in one giant clump. It tasted like plain noodles, i was glad I had peanut sauce in the fridge to,add to it. Then it was edible .... We will not be going back to G@S.. Very disappointed !!!! From now on it will be Jade palace on 92nd street. For take out Asian !!!!  Do yourself a favor go elsewhere !!!!"}
{"text":"Service was so fast that my boyfriend and I were concerned the quality might have suffered but it absolutely did not. We had the crab rangoon which were stellar, the Mongolian beef and vegetarian fried rice. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Quick food with good service. The orange chicken was great, although not the best I've had. My wife had the egg plant. She really liked it as well. If we come back, it will be because the food is good, quick, and really cheap (for lunch at least)"}
{"text":"Decent  Chinese food. They have a great lunch Buffett. Nice selection. Walnut shrimp is to die for. Friendly staff too and they deliver. Clean restaurant. Perfect place for lunch!"}
{"text":"Had take out from here and quickly realized it's probably more of a place you go sit down at instead of getting take out. Food seemed to be ready quick (wasn't me picking it up) but all in all it appeared to be standard nothing special take out. I wasn't super impressed at all but that's not to say I'm not willing to give this place another try."}
{"text":"Kinda pricy for the same quality food that u can get at a dozen other places in a 2 mile radius, in other words delusions of being a P.F. Chang's while being a neighborhood Chinese takeout. Quit changing your prices on a bi weekly basis."}
{"text":"Save your money!!!  I really had high hopes for this place.  Decided to visit because of the reviews.  Big mistake!  Customer service is awful!  Not friendly at all and it takes forever for them to take your order or even to refill your drink.  The food was average and very overpriced!    Totally not what I expected.  I do not recommend and I will not be returning."}
{"text":"First time ever here tonight and it was absolutely amazing! Had the sesame chicken and chicken egg foo young and would definitely recommend it. I will be back :)"}
{"text":"It's honestly way too salty for me... way too salty and sweet.  Came 3 times due to convenience. Tried several dishes but The only think I can say I enjoyed was the chicken wings but it s too salty to eat on it own :))"}
{"text":"Amazing food, very unique. Love the hospitality of the owner and his staff. They made sure everything was perfect and that we were satisfied. A must try would be the shrimp and walnuts (even if you don't like walnuts). It was delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Visited on a Sunday, the place was empty but I had read the Yelp reviews and I wanted to try by myself,the place looks outdated, the chairs at the entrance are ripped and repaired with a clear wide tape...and a the place is little bit dark...maybe that's nice if you are on a date...the staff is nice and friendly, I ordered to go. But unfortunately the food was very salty And the taste and portions of the food compared with another Chinese restaurant close to my home are inferior. So no I'm not coming back...if you like salty you will enjoy this place."}
{"text":"Best Asian food ever! It is so hard to find a place that uses quality ingredients and this place uses the best! I ordered take out and it was ready when I got there not even 15 min later. We ordered the sun devil chicken, the chili fried rice, and a spicy beef dish. All of them were so good, they were all very spicy without taking over the taste of the dish. I am super impressed and will be back time and time again. This is my new favorite place for take out."}
{"text":"I came because of a recommendation...I was floored by the service and the delicious fare. The portions are generous and the price point is more than fair. When I return to Phoenix, I will make every effort to return to George and Son!"}
{"text":"Ehhhh the food is mediocre at best. I am surprised that so many of the reviews are so high. Sure the service was pretty good, but the food was meh. I had the citrus chicken that so many people raved about, and for me the sauce was way too sweet. I could barely eat half of my plate. I did like how the chicken was cooked crispy on top though.  The brown rice was a little soggy. My bf got the Thai curry chicken and it was not very good at all. We go to touch of Thai on 35th ave and bell road and nothing compares to their curry so we didn't have high expectations to begin with. Anyways... Like I said, I wasn't impressed to go back a 2nd time."}
{"text":"We came in early in a Sunday and they had up a buffet that we decided to try it (I don't usually do buffet food but it looked great) and we were so pleased with the selection and the freshness of the food. Everything tasted GREAT and the service was excellent. We will definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"Currently visit Phoenix for business trip and find out this great place, this is the best Chinese food in town,you can't miss it . Very nice environment, we have spend over 6 hours in there. The best foods you have to try Kung Pao 3 seas, I never know sea food can be make in this way .  Another one is Shrimp Honey Glazed Walnuts and thee are lot more you will find out .  This place really change my point of view for Phoenix's Chinese foods .  I have told all my friends to go there and they are love it as well."}
{"text":"Ordered take out from George's a couple days after xmas. I was rather surprised about how tasty it was.  -Firecracker Pork = BEST PORK EVER. I've never had such a yummy pork dish from a take out chinese food place. The sauce they put on it is AMAZING. I want it on everything!  -Potstickers = these were really fat/full of pork and veggies. Pan fried on one side. I'm more of a thinner, pan fry both side kinda girl, but they were alright.  -Crab puffs = I hate cream cheese, so I hated these, but my whole family LOVED them. I gave it a shot and it was sweet too, which I thought was weird. Not down.  -Mongolian Beef and snow peas = Finally a place with not bouncy/fatty beef! I never found a weird piece or was upset about the texture of the beef. It was good stuff.  -Pork fried rice = nothing special, but it wasn't bad.  -Sweet n Sour shrimp (I think it was that..) = normal, wasn't amazed, but really good non the less.  Good stuff, pretty good prices. Our total for 9 people was 114 bucks / 13 bucks a person."}
{"text":"My experience was brief, but very good. I showed up almost at closing time.... You'd think they'd be annoyed and make faces since they are trying to go home, but it was all the opposite. An asian lady welcomed me w a big smile and ready to take good care of me. She went thru the menu, was patient, and friendly. I take up one star because I drove all the way over there thinking it was a buffett, but she told me the buffett is only up until 2, and I think that info should be highlighted to make it clearer somehow. But in a sense I am so happy I went because I found a new favorite dish... Seafood Pockets, yum! It is a phyllo dough kind of \"empanada\" filled w scallops and shrimp. It was perfectly flaky, not greasy amazingly fresh and exquisite concotion. Its not easy to find something so perfect, so yes, I will be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome good always here! Congrats George on your 2nd restuarant!  I love your house fried rice! Super quality food as always, great meats and done correctly! George 7.95 six item combo is great deal ! Super nice new spot with great bar and super personable folks here! Try George's buffet at his other restuarant too, you love it too and the food is higherst of quality there!"}
{"text":"On a rare break from work, hubby and I stopped in here after taking in a morning movie,  and boy, am I ever glad!!! The soft grays and muted reds with a stunning, gorgeous art wall set the tone --- beautiful!!! Hubby ordered Beef and Broccoli,  I got Orange Chicken, all from the Lunch Menu. Wow!! Hot rice,  hot chow mein, hot crab puff, hot veggie roll and hot Orange Chicken!!! Notice a patten here??? At other Oriental Places,  I usually very WARM. This was delightfu!!! Plus, all tasted wonderful!!! Orange Chicken had just a hint of spice, which was perfect for me. Hubby's was spiced as he requested and not over the top. Everything on our plates was delicious. We will be retuning!!!"}
{"text":"My go to for Chinese food in Phx. If you want a little kick ask for the item \"spicy\" and they do a great job of changing it. I've tried the wontons, bbq pork appetizer, spicy fried rice, spicy crispy pork, salt and pepper shrimp and general tao chicken.  Everything was great except the bbq pork, I prefer something with more sauce."}
{"text":"The unique decor and friendly staff are only the beginning to our great lunch experience.  My friend and I work nearby and only have an hour to eat and get back. The lunch service was fast enough that we didn't have to rush. Their lunch specials are great. The portions are decent and the variety of choices is remarkable. Lunch is served with a small salad, rice, lo mein, spring roll, crab puff, and a generous portion of the main item all for a crazy good price. Our server was attentive and helpful with menu items and offered suggestions and alternatives. This will go on my list of regular places to visit for lunch."}
{"text":"Looked for a place to meet friends along the I-17/AZ101 corner and settled on George and Sons Asian Cuisine because of it ratings...and we were not dissapointed.  Started with crab puffs and the scallion pancake.  The puffs were excellent and the pancake very good.  Mains included basil chicken, egg foo-yong (sp?), a walnut shrimp dish and spicy egg plant.  All were very good, but the egg plant was particularly flavorful and well prepared.  Certainly worth a repeat."}
{"text":"This is now my favorite Chinese restaurant. I walked in to place a to go order today (Sunday) and got the kung pao chicken lunch special with an extra two vegetable spring rolls on the side. WOW. The king pao was probably the best I have ever had, I usually go to places like Pei Wei, Pf Changs, and a few other local family owned Chinese restaurants and this topped them all. The cost was under $8 and I can't believe the lunch portions that were given, plus if you dine in you also get complimentary soup and salad. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Been here for lunch and it was good. The lunch menu is simple and the food was served fast. Absolutely love the chow mein more than anything. We were a bunch of 6 guys and we all tried different things on the lunch menu and I would have to say that they did a good job satisfying all of us. Pretty decent place and I would want to get back here for dinner sometime. Nice Asian place in Deer Valley area."}
{"text":"Delicious! We ordered Mongolian beef, spicy beef, and chicken chow mein. Food was ready quickly and the flavor is fantastic. Prices seem a bit steep but with few options in Phoenix, it is worth it. I will be back."}
{"text":"Always clean and friendly. I have had so many good meals here. I love the Kung Pao even though they stubbornly omit the peanuts from the preparation. I love the consistency of the Kung Pao sauce as it has a \"gastrique\" like quality.  The only reason for the 4 stars is because they dont have a hot and sour soup on the menu, rather they offer an odd cabbage salad (which is tasty) but I would rather have soup in its place."}
{"text":"I love George & Son's.  I used to live just a couple blocks up the street, so we frequented this place.  My favorites are definitely:  Sesame Chicken ($9.95) - Excellent sauce. House Fried Rice ($7.95) - With chicken, shrimp, and pork.  I highly recommend both of these.  I've also had the Pad Thai ($9.95), which is pretty good for the price, with more shrimp than I expected.  And, of course, I have had a number of other dishes as well, which are pretty standard (Americanized) Chinese food."}
{"text":"I've given this place three opportunities to wow me with their food, and they have fallen short each time.  My husband likes some of the dishes so I keep agreeing to try it again, but not anymore.  The first time I went I ordered the sesame chicken.  It is simply a grilled chicken breast (plain, unseasoned) with some sesame sauce on the side.  Next trip, I ordered chicken fried rice and an egg roll.  The egg roll, they call it a pork spring roll, is not really even edible.  There is no veggies in it, no spices it is literally pork stuffed inside a spring roll wrapper. The fried rice was bland and the chicken was also very bland.  Third try, I got the beef fried rice.  It was under cooked.  The rice was crunchy and lacked flavor.  If you can't even get fried rice right I don't think you should claim to be \"fine Asian dining\".  Hubby can go back on his own for lunch, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I've eaten here 3 times and it never disappoints. The dishes are served family style with a large pot of white rice on the side. My go-to is the spicy eggplant (I don't eat meat) and it's seriously SO good. I can't attest personally for the meat dishes, but my mom is currently RAVING about the sizzling peppered beef dish. She says it's the most tender beef dish she's ever had at an Asian restaurant. Overall, the waiters are attentive and helpful, the food came out FAST and hot, and the experience overall was nothing but positive."}
{"text":"I am so glad to have found a good Chinese restaurant.  I have tried so many below-average places that I thought Phoenix just didn't have good Chinese!  I settled on Beef with Broccoli and I was very happy.  Plenty of meat and broccoli, and the sauce was very tasty as well.  It was not the average beef with broccoli sauce.  The meat was of good quality too.  My dinner date who is Chinese commented that the brown rice was good and properly cooked.  The server's English was not good and when she couldn't tell me what precisely was in a certain entree, I settled on the something I knew wouldn't be a surprise.  It seems that after reading some of the negative reviews that a clear and detailed menu would solve a lot of their customer service issues.  I am definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful dining experience ! We ordered several dishes and a few appetizers. The springs rolls were hot and fresh served with spicy mustard and sauce. The potstickers were great also. The dishes we ordered were the beef and broccoli,general yang shrimp, house chow mein, chicken fried rice,Singapore chow fun, and orange chicken. I rated the general yang shrimp and house chow mein the best dishes of the dinner. Now the customer service was exceptional....our waitress was attentive and made us feel welcomed. I will be back!"}
{"text":"For this class of restaurant, which is a low cost chinese food restaurant, the service was excellent and the service was very good.  We had lunch specials, and this was our first time here, they have generous lunch portions.  The food was freshly cooked and the staff was excellent at keeping up with drinks and answering questions.  My companion is allergic to wheat and they knew exactly which dishes contained gluten and that soy sauce contained wheat (which is not commonly known by restaurant staff).  Also, they were willing to modify the meals if possible to remove unnecessary wheat.  And surprisingly my companion didn't suffer a post-meal stomach issue due contamination.  So, for the great food and service, and bonus excellent handling of a food allergy, this place is great for Chinese food."}
{"text":"Decided to try a new chinese restaurant. Will Definately be back. Food was fantastic (scallops were a little over cooked) portion sizes are good. Plus they have this awesome dessert with four tiny eggrolls filled with chocolate and banana and chocolate ice cream. The service is very efficient. What I enjoyed most is having the staff be aware of my needs without having to interrupt my dining experience (constantly asking how things were or if I need something while I have food in my mouth is annoying) Best service, decent food, a great overall experience. Well worth my time and money."}
{"text":"This is quite a find. Excellent food. Good prices, and a very comfortable, family-friendly atmosphere. Try the amazing spinach fired rice and the chicken teriyaki (which is made with dark meat!). I strongly recommend it."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Asian restaurant. I haven't had a bad dish. The service is always welcoming, friendly and fast. Their lunch special can't be beat.   I've been a regular here since they opened and I don't plan on stopping any time soon. Love George and Son!!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is the perfect t destination if your in the mood to share. The portion sizes are wonderful the staff is quick and efficient and very friendly. The restaurant was clean and very trendy. I would definitely do this again with my family."}
{"text":"First time dining at George and Son's,  the food was well prepared and tasty. The wife especially loved the eggplant and garlic sauce dish. I myself was partial to the Mapo Tofu. I find it very hard to find these 2 dishes in the greater Phx area who do it this well. Two thumbs up!!! Prices were very reasonable. Would I go back? I think I found my new dine in Chinese Rstrnt."}
{"text":"I ordered the fire cracker shrimp and walnut chicken. The fire cracker shrimp had barely any veggies in it besides a ton of onion and the taste was decent, but had way to much sauce. The walnut chicken was an absolute a waste of money though and didn't even look like chicken. The meal in general was definitely not worth $30 some dollars. I'm upset and feel like I wasted my time and money."}
{"text":"A friend of mine and I decide to stop in for some take out. It was a Friday night and man was this place jumping. Lots of couples were dancing it up and listening to the Elvis impersonator. Too funny but everyone really seemed to be enjoying themselves and having a good time. George was out and about talking to everyone and his customers seemed to be regulars as everyone really seemed to know everyone in this place.   Anywho, my friend and I had decided that we were going to order what is is called the Annie special in which you get a soup, two appetizers and two entrees. Plus all the entrees come with vegetable fried rice. We had asked if we could pay extra and have the house fried rice instead of the vegetable and we were told emphatically NO SUBSTITUTIONS! I was like ok, we had no problem paying extra, it wasn't that serious. My friend could tell I was pissed due to the look on my face. I was like wow really? Did that just happen?   Anyway, we ordered shrimp with honey glazed walnuts, house fried rice and Kung Pao 3 seas. Let me just say that the food was very good. I mean VERY VERY good. The house fried rice had tons of shrimp, chicken and pork. The shrimp with honey glazed walnuts were divine and the Kung Pao 3 Seas was nice and spicy with tons of scallops, shrimp and fish. So why only three stars? When someone says NO SUBSTITUTIONS the way that this person did, it kinda leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Will I drive all the way back out here again? Maybe but I know now to never, ever, EVER ,EVER ask to switch out one item for another and even offer to pay extra because it will NOT happen."}
{"text":"While I've never eaten IN the restaurant, I've had the food here dozens of times. SO GOOD! I'd venture to say the best Asian in town. I've met George - quite a character and proud of every recipe that has been passed down in his family - for good reason! I doubt you'll regret trying this place out!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed our meals at George and son the waiters were very courteous and knowledgeable af there menu. A must place to checkout. Dinner and a movie at AMC is a great way to end a day."}
{"text":"My go to dish for this restaurant is the House Chow Mein. Owner is probably the most approachable owner I have come across."}
{"text":"Looking for buffet as we traveled through and found Georges.  All was hot and good. Would have liked a few more dishes, and maybe something for dessert besides fortune cookies. Would stop again...  good price :-)"}
{"text":"Wow, what happened. Three years ago, when this restaurant opened, the food was fantastic. Today I ordered some take-out..(Annie's Choice). I was very disappointed. Everything was generic and bland, at best. I will probably toss out the left-overs. Yes, the portions were large, but size isn't everything. I make better lettuce wraps at home. And I still can't stop wondering why the \"gentleman\" at the front desk didn't open the door for me as I struggled out with my large box of food. There were no other customers in the restaurant. Won't be going back. Are there any authentic Chinese restaurants in Scottsdale? Does anyone know what authentic Chinese is? I've seen them only in Seattle and NYC. And, the beef was tough and fattty."}
{"text":"Orange chicken just misses the chance to be good. Very dry. If you order two entrees you split a quart of rice instead of getting a container of your own. Another disappointment. Overpriced compared to most."}
{"text":"First of all, this Hot and Sour Soup is the most flavorful I've found in Phoenix. Excellent!   I come here regularly, and I typically like whatever entrées I've tried. One of my favorite things are the Spicy Thai Chili wings...they take a while to prepare, however worth the wait.  Today, for the first time - I tried the Pad Thai. Very good. Whenever you order any shrimp dish, the quality of the shrimp is incredible. And typical to George and Sons, anytime you order protein in any dish...they DON'T skimp.   Love this place!"}
{"text":"I like the food here..try pepper chicken fry..other items are also good..only downside is waiting time.. min 30 mins max can be 1 hr.."}
{"text":"I'm Chinese and you must be able to \"taste the wok\" for it to be considered good. Its equivalent to tasting the grill on barbeque. This place does it right. And you get nice decor and pleasant service while you're at it."}
{"text":"I normally hate Asian fusion restaurants since they tamper with too many flavors from too many countries and fail. But this place does all the fundamentals perfectly. Great flavors and enough heat. If you're looking for a good sit down Asian restaurant..which is difficult nowadays for some reason, then give George and Sons a try."}
{"text":"The BEST place for Chinese cuisine in the Phoenix metro area. Their lunch buffet is always fantastic and full of good quality meat dishes, soups, etc.  If you are fortunate enough to meet the owner, he is a sweet, friendly, and funny gentleman who is always very welcoming, and the service is always top notch. Some of my favorites include the hot & sour soup, shrimp in walnut sauce, and the crispy pork."}
{"text":"Such good food every time i go in. Best buffet. I usually hate buffet but not theirs. Great service"}
{"text":"I was in for a late lunch today (Christmas Day) and had the poor luck of sitting next to one of the biggest jerks I have EVER had the misfortune of sharing a dining room with. He was unhappy about the abreviated menu due to the holiday, and I am not exagerating when I say he was a complete douche.  My point in sharing this is that inspite of his behavior, the staff treated him great. They apologized, did what they could to help, they were just great.  Another reason to love this place."}
{"text":"George and Sons recently opened in the Deer Valley Towne Center. What makes George and Sons different from other Chinese Restaurants in the area is George and his staff. He is a Showman and Master with communication and Service. He was very particular on the way we were served. He checked on the favors and spice of our dishes and said if you want something more or less spicy tell me and I will change it. If you want anything different from what I did you tell me and I will do that. You can't ask for much more than that. They offer mostly Chinese Dishes but do offer other Asian such as Thai.  The atmosphere is more upscale than other Chinese Places in this area with a Zen like Fountain and attractive modern decor. They feature a full bar but it looks like this location doesn't have a buffet. Also there is no mention of this location on their website.  We ordered one lunch plate and one regular entree. They started us both out with small regular salads tossed with a very thin white dressing.  I soon received my Spicy Thai Basil Chicken. Upon receiving it I thought it was lacking basil but when I tasted the chicken I found it was infused with the right amount of basil flavor so it was good and the chicken was moist. The spice level was good and not too much but also not too little.  This lunch plate came with generous scoops of steamed rice and a scoop of very tasty lo mein noodles not to mention a crab puff and also a vegetable spring roll.   My husband tried the Spicy Beef. It was beef in a Szechuan Sauce with a few vegetables. I thought the beef was good and tender. For me the sauce ran a little salty but was OK.  3.5 Stars Rounded up for very good Service and a very nice addition to the area."}
{"text":"Best Asian Cusine that I have found in AZ. Love the crab ragoons, sizzling rice soup and every entree I have had. The meat is not mystery meat, like some Chinese restaurants, but great quality."}
{"text":"George is a most gracious host and is very proud of his restaurant. I would highly recommend trying most anything on the menu but have had a recent favorite prepared to perfection...Peking Duck!!!  It was served as a first course but expertly prepared and cooked. Just the outer layer along with skin are served with the traditional pancakes and plum/hoison sauce. I recommend having the chef prepare duck fried rice with the extra duck meat not served.   George also has some excellent soups to try...but try everything. It's worth the trip.  Enjoy"}
{"text":"I'm always a little skeptical when I walk into a \"authentic\" asian cuisine restaurant and there are only caucasian patrons (I guess there are chinese waiters/cooks). I was actually very surprised at how good the food is. It's definitely a little more pricey for the entrees, but the lunch specials are great. You get a choice of an entree (seafood does not cost extra), with soup/salad (not when you get take out), spring roll, crab puff, and steamed rice for only $6.95! You can sub for fried rice for an extra dollar, which I prefer because I'm not a fan of steamed rice.   There's also a buffet for lunch for $7 and they have a large selection (12 entrees, soup, salad and some appetizers). The service was really good and the place is pretty homey. It definitely doesn't look like a hole in the wall, but it tastes as good as mom and pop shops. They also don't use MSG, which I like bc that stuff usually gives me a stomach ache.   I ordered the shrimp roll, chicken salad, and honey walnut shrimp and schezwaun green beans lunch special for over $20. I had a 15% off coupon which I got off their website so it saved a few bucks and paid for my fried rice substitution =)"}
{"text":"Today had a really disappointing experience which made me decide to never ever come back.  Let me start with the fact that I WAS a George and Sons believer. I went for the first time to this location when they had just opened about a year ago, I went there for dinner and the service was top notch. Every time I had a chance I stopped here for their lunch specials, which was pretty much at least a couple of times per week.  However today was the last time I dined here. I went there for their lunch special and as always I ordered brown rice (which by the way 80% of the times they mess up and bring white rice), today wasn't the exception. When I told the girl which looked like the food runner since I didn't see her serving any tables at all, she made a pretty nasty face like if she had to go back and cook the whole rice again! After she came back with my brown rice, I politely asked for some chilli sauce, instantly she made me a face like if that sauce was coming from her paycheck. I refuse to patronize a place with such bad customer service and attitude. I hope someone from top management reads this message and the others here on Yelp, and they do something about their customer service skills. If not they are going to keep losing loyal customers like me."}
{"text":"Favorite place!  Love their cheap lunch specials and their house fried rice!  Friendly and fast service!"}
{"text":"I went to this place after reviewing some of the posted reviews.  I love chinese food and have tried many places.  This place was OK, nothing great or better than some of the places I've been too.  The decor and atmosphere were nice but the food was bland for my taste.  I will stay with my other chinese places.  Thanks"}
{"text":"I read some reviews mostly great and a few bad ones due to circumstances. Anyway,  I had been eaten at this restaurant over the years, after the meals I always felt happy and satisfied.   What I like about the food is the restaurant adds innovated elements in making the dishes more interesting and delicious.  Example, the egg rolls rather using the traditional stuffing it has shrimp instead. The fried grass is fried scallions which is crisp and flavorful. The stir fry black truffle with beef and asparagus, etc. I can name it on and on; most of these dishes that you cannot taste them elsewhere. The restaurant design has a good vibe that makes you feel comfortable. Particularly the owner George with his warm personality always makes you feel welcome in his restaurant. I am a big fan of this place. The restaurant can be so extraordinary busy that bad moments can happen. If unfortunate that you have bad experience just because you catch them at wrong time, I suggest you give yourself and the restaurant a second chance, then you might find out what you could have been missed."}
{"text":"I ordered the potstickers, won ton soup, \"Three Amigos\", and house chow mein and all platters were delicious. The staff were both efficient and friendly. If one waiter was unavailable another was ready to assist. I also appreciated that staff was quick to clear the table after meals were finished. This way, there was enough space to pass around the platters and allotted plenty of elbow room to eat. I look forward to going back and enjoying another meal with my family here."}
{"text":"Best fried rice west of the Mississippi, nough said"}
{"text":"Finally!! A great Chinese food spot in Phoenix! It's been a long time since I fell back in love with Chinese food honestly, this place has tasty Chinese food I haven't enjoyed in a long time, the orange chicken was crispy and the sauce was perfect, their pad Thai was better then any place I've had and if you like beer try the Lucky Buddha. I'll def be going back again when my cravings for Chinese food kick in and I have a feeling it will be soon!"}
{"text":"The ambiance is nice, its not exactly romantic or five star but it's comfortable. They were playing a beauty pageant on the tv's. The service was fast and friendly. The egg drop soup was decent, it has a lot of veggies in it. The hot sour soup was very very good! It had big pieces of shrimp chicken and tofu. The sesame chicken is a huge portion and enough for two people to share! It needed more brown gravy and the rice comes plentiful in a big pot! I added broccoli which may have been over steamed. My friend got the house special chicken that was good but nothing special. My rum and coke was decent. It's a good place with a friendly staff and the food is flavorful and plentiful"}
{"text":"I decided to try something different from what I normally order. So, I ordered the Pad Thai. It was magnificent. The noodles were just right, and the sauce was perfect. It had the right balance of sweet and tangy. I will continue to work my way through their extensive menu. The service was great, and very attentive. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a wonderful meal at George and Sons tonight. The staff was attentive and friendly. Linen table cloths, ambient soft music so you could converse throughout our meal. We enjoyed house chow main and beef and snow peas. We were at George and Sons on Via Linda. We have searched high and low in the valley for good Chinese food, and now we've found it!!! Thank you.  We highly recommended!"}
{"text":"It was my first time at George and Sons! My fiancé has been before and after a crazy day at work it was our destination for dinner. We were greeted warmly and seated. Our meals came promptly, were piping hot and very tasty!! They checked on us several times throughout our meal and boxed it up for us as well! We had an enjoyable meal and will return again!"}
{"text":"Really good food. Best Asian food we've had in Phoenix. Significantly better than PF. Sauce had wonderfully subtle flavors (black mushrooms, ginger). Service was spot on & restaurant had nice ambience. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I ordered the small Greek salad with chicken, tender juicy and full of flavor.  My husband ordered the gyro, he said it was delicious, I tasted his french fries they were warm and crisp. We used the free drink offer on yelp. Highly recommend this place as we always try to support at mom and pop businesses. Definitely worth coming back to."}
{"text":"COMING FROM SOMEONE WHO'S WHOLE FAMILY WORKS FOR PF CHANGS! Best Asian cuisine in Arizona. Authentic. Friendly service (talked to several employees throughout the night). Most of all- outstanding food. They even brought us complimentary vegetable spring rolls for the appetizer coming out late. Highly recommend! We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"George is a very nice man but today sealed the fate of George and Son's in my culinary world.  Have eaten here a few times and have been underwhelmed.  I tried the buffet today and was very disappointed.  The egg drop soup was OK as well as shrimp with stringbeans. However, every dish was soooo greasy I just had to stop eating,  The salad had some creamy dressing that had absolutely no flavor...not quite sure what it was.  Even the plastic wrapped almond cookie was inedible-was soggy and tasted rancid.  The waitresses were very attentive and working hard.  There seemed to be a number of regular customers dining there.  I just don't get it...there are so many better options in North Scottsdale.  Maybe it's the neighborhood proximity?  Who knows but I rather spend money on gas than another meal here."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese food in AZ!  It's full of fresh ingredients, light and tasty.  This definitely isn't the kind of Chinese food where grease is a main ingredient.  It's the good stuff - reminds me of a few places in China Town, in Philadelphia.    I used to live nearby and eat there regularly, but these days, it's our favorite choice for Christmas dinner.  We had the Shrimp with Vegetables and Shrimp Fried Rice - both lovely.  They're quite generous with the shrimp!!  NOTE: They don't honor the Yelp 15% off your next visit deal!  It's quite a great place, so definitely visit, but not if you're counting on a discount."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times over the last little while. In all honesty, I tried it several years ago and was just not impressed at that time. I decided a few months ago to give it another chance and I'm certainly glad I did. I don't know what changed but it's definitely been an improvement!  My folks, my kids, my brother and I ordered take-out from them recently and by the time we had finished, all of us were fat and happy.   General Tso Shrimp, Black Pepper Beef, Orange Chicken, Lo Mein, Chicken Fried Rice and Pot Stickers - all were excellent. Egg rolls and crab puffs were meh.  Their Sunday Champaign Brunch was ON POINT! Less than $15 per person with a glass of champaign obviously included. Great deal."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim; probably in the top 5 best decisions I've ever made in my life.   Interesting decor. Very friendly and accommodating staff!   We ordered Sun Devil Chicken, Mongolian Beef, and a Spicy Curry chicken dish, all were delicious. The Sun Devil chicken had a nice kick, the curry chicken wasn't overwhelming like other places and beef was so tender and tasty!   But my favorite was the orange chicken which was a pleasant balance between light citrus tang and just the right amount of sweet. Nothing like Panda's, drenched in corn syrup.   The prices were very reasonable and portions were a decent size. I asked about the Sing-ha beer that they had in the bar and the waitress did not hesitate to tell me all about it and where to get it. She was just the cutest lady ever. When we left she chased us down in the parking lot and said, \"Forget what I told you about going to BevMo to buy Sing-ha, I don't know what I was thinking, go to the Asian market, much cheaper!\"  We also returned a few nights later and the orange chicken was just as good as the first visit. This time around we also ordered General Yang's (Tso) chicken and all I can say is it was bomb.com. Damn... Writing this review is making me hungry, I wonder if they deliver..."}
{"text":"I must say I don't like Chinese food.  Never have, never thought I would. Until this place. My fiance loves it, and I cringe anytime when he wants to go to an Asian restaurant. We walked in on a Saturday night and it was empty. A bad sign in my book. The hostess was sweet and sat us immediately. We ordered pot stickers. Amazing. I ordered the curry chicken and it was good! I don't normally like curry, but it appealed to me. My fiance had the Thai basil chicken and it was so flavorful. A woman, maybe the owner?, brought over a sample of Miona's chicken. It is now our favorite dish. Since, we have been back almost every week and had an array of dishes like shrimp fried rice, sun devil chicken, beijing beef, and chow mein dishes and have loved every single one! If you're ever in the area, don't miss out!"}
{"text":"I was looking for an Asian restaurant while visiting & found George's on Yelp. The decor is nice, the price & service was o/s! The pad Thai noodles lacked a little flavor however they fixed that right away. I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Still love George's, but the live Sat. Music night is too much for me.  Can't visit with friends.  Not background music.  Inappropriate for dinner I think."}
{"text":"For the last year I've been trying to find a really good Chinese take-out in the North Phoenix area, I believe I finally found it at George & Son's.  Ordered the Moo Goo Gai Pan which had brown sauce which is different from the garlic white sauce that I'm used to eating.  It's a little pricier than what I have been paying in the past but the helpings are nice size and the taste is worth it as well."}
{"text":"Wow - what great Asian food - the Hot Sour Soup was 7 on scale of 10 - some of the best I've had since Minneapolis 15 years ago.  The Kung Pao Chicken - what a delicate and perfect flavor it had - no peanuts - it did not need them either - the heat was just right and the flavors were not the usual Americanized version which leads me to believe this place is serving up Asian food much closer to the true form.  Kung Pao gets a 9 rating.  Spring Rolls - some of the best I've had since a Vietnamese place in Minneapolis 20 years ago.  My entire meal was a joy and good attention from the servers as well.  I will be back for more and trying other dishes."}
{"text":"No one gets five stars from me  So far so good at this place, as I write my reviews from the moment I get settled in. I have ordered a black pepper beef as well as the fried dumplings. When I tell you the dumplings are perfect in every way, you need to believe me. I've been doing dumplings aka pot-stickers for many years and I must say, you are free to come to this restaurant for nothing more than the dumplings. Like, for real!  The black pepper beef comes with bell peppers and onions all stir fried and presented on a sizzling platter. This is good for the palate as well as for the other senses. Some Chinese joints do the black pepper too spicy, but it wasn't spicy enough here. It was almost great though. The rice wasn't too sticky, either.   I had space for another meal after all this, but realistically, what I just ordered above is enough for two people  Prices here seem reasonable on the menu for the amount that you get, and very importantly, the restaurant is nice and CLEAN. That is important for an Asian restaurant, although I confess that some of the best Chinese I ever had was in dirty joints in Alhambra that had a C-rating  Service is excellent here, and very prompt."}
{"text":"Beware of fraud at this establishment.  On two recent occasions I ordered home delivery and the bill was inflated.  The second time I started looking into why, but not wanting to wait another hour to feed the troops etc... I opted not to question the delivery driver.   So the second time the bill seemed too high, I called and spoke to \"George\"  who told me the webmaster for his internet site had gone out of business over a year ago, prior to his price increases.  The bill was inflated by nearly $15 to best of my ability to calculate the difference over the published internet menu rates. When asked why he failed to include a paper menu for future use, he stated that everyone already has his menu... Maybe everyone except me...  When I asked for a credit , fast talking George had several reasons why he couldn't give it to me immediately and kept suggesting other options such as a free order on my next visit etc... Later he said come in and visit etc et al...  Then he finally agrees to get it done in the next  few days.   The point here is that I believe he gets away with this enough to make it worth his while....  So beware that the price  you pay is the published price just so that your guests don't leave your house remarking that this must be just another one of those Snottsdale things...   By the way the food is just okay, we did order it twice, but it certainly isn't as good as all the reviews you've  probably read on this site."}
{"text":"Live near by and go here regularly when in the mood for Chinese. Reasonably priced with good prep times if you're picking up your order or going the delivery route. Their chow mein and fried rice options are always above average. We also like their lighter menu options which include chicken or shrimp with vegetables. The rest of the menu is mediocre. Quality of some of their other meats are questionable. But if you're in the mood for Chinese, this is a safe bet for a reasonable meal."}
{"text":"85 Miles round trip. Ughhhhh, this is what we drive to get to George & Sons, yes it is that good!  Several years ago we were treated to take out at a friends house and as it turns out she picked up dinner from George & Sons and we have been hooked ever since.    Stand outs for us is the Sizzling Rice soup, Shrimp spring rolls filled with nothing but Shrimp, Thai Basil Chicken and the Honey Walnut Shrimp.  Everything tastes fresh and as it should be.  The service is top notch and it the mood strikes him, even George himself might stop by to say hello."}
{"text":"We tried this place on a whim. It is now my husband's favorite place. He had the sautéed spicy beef and I had the orange chicken.  We also had a lettuce wraps. Big plates for the $$.  Service wss outstanding. They will customize the order. LOVED IT! This took over Pei Wei and Chang's."}
{"text":"Good Asian cuisine. Best for takeout. Their Singapore noodles, nyungi noodles, house special fried rice, pork maa po tofu, and vege selections are our fav.  Their Sunday brunch is nice."}
{"text":"Came to Phoenix for spine surgery not knowing where to go for Chinese... This was recommended by the people at the Wingate. Had Sundevil Chicken. Holy cow... EXCELLENT!!! I have a new place to go every time I go to Scottsdale!!! AAA+++ I am VERY DISCRIMINATING when it comes to food. This place is awesome and the service... The lil Chinese lady was so sweet... Loved her laugh!!! Head over to George's if you want the best of the best!!!"}
{"text":"I've tried a few of the soups and have not found any of them very flavorful, very sad! My favorite thing I've had here is the mushu pork, and also the sweet and sour chicken! The sweet and sour chicken doesn't have a lot of breading on it, which I like. Dumplings are good! Highly recommend trying the wings, they say they take a long time, but they are worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service. The management really makes you feel welcome and they are extremely courteous. I've always had superb quality of food for the price and highly recommend this establishment to all. Nice to see a restaurant cretus customers like family."}
{"text":"Best Place for Chinese food in Scottsdale Hands down! All the food is outstanding, can't go wrong with anything served here. Excellent service in a friendly, family atmosphere. George knows most of his customers by first name, will deff be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Chinese restaurants...ever. Several reasons why. Great service! Great food! The place always looks clean. I've been going here to dine or getting carry out for over 6 years averaging 2 times a month minimum. That comes to over 150 visits! Don't get me wrong. I do get burnt out of some of the items I get but their variety of menu items with a twist keeps me coming back. I love the lunch buffet. Very simple and they cook it in small portions so I know it is always fresh! The fish is great as well as the egg drop soup. Not like the radioactive colored stuff you see at other Chinese restaurants. Also, try the calamari. One of my favorites!"}
{"text":"Great as always, I love there food. Most seafood are my favorite. The taste is excellent! And food are very fresh."}
{"text":"Ate here a few days ago. Not greasy buffet food.Good mid - range Asian food.They also brought out a deep fried - breaded  whole shrimp with a drizzle of melted icing and candied walnuts.They said it was on the menu NOW . INTERESTING! Unusual and tasty!"}
{"text":"ordered: - lunch buffet  pros: - don't let the small selection of food discourage you from doing the lunch buffet, everything is quality, unlike other buffets - honey chicken, house special chicken, potstickers, fish filets, egg drop soup, and the assorted fried appetizers are all delicious - the kitchen makes all the food in small batches so it's always fresh - if they're out of something, be patient, it will come out shortly - very affordable - the iced green tea is lit  cons: - sometimes, they don't have honey chicken - the lunch buffet is only until 2  protips: - get the honey chicken - if you do go for dinner, the house chow fun is a solid choice"}
{"text":"Ordered the Lunch portion of Tres Amigos at 11:05am for pick up $8.85 with veg roll.  When I got there to pick it up, they did a dinner size order at $16.95 and when I brought it to their attention, she kept stating she didn't take the order and it is $16.95. This was their mistake not mine but it was $16.95 or nothing. Will NEVER go there again. Poor customer service."}
{"text":"Over salted food. Haole Chinese food. Service means well, but the food is prepared poorly. Panda world be a better choice."}
{"text":"As much as I try, I don't like this restaurant. The only reason we keep coming back is because my husband really likes it. Go figure.  We have previously eaten at the Phoenix location, but decided to try the Scottsdale location in the hopes I may like it better...not so much. We went on Saturday night, which is live music night. All I can say is, \"Wow.\" We walked in the door and we were the youngest people in the place by 40 years. The band was playing standards and it was apparent that this was probably the big weekly night-out for a lot of the couples dining together. The band and tables were set up so it was difficult to move through the restaurant. We waited at the bar for our table and kept getting bumped into by the servers and other patrons trying to move around the restaurant. While not a fan of the entertainment, my rating is based solely on the food.  We ordered starters. I ordered the potstickers, which did not come at the same time as my husband's squid. Several minutes after the squid was delivered to the table, we had to flag our server down to #1) order our entrees since she had never come back over to take our order and #2) ask about my potstickers. I am assuming the order was never given to the kitchen because the potstickers were brought to the table well after my husband FINISHED eating his starter. The potstickers were fair. I found them to be oddly pink on the inside.  I went with the moo goo gai pan on the recommendation of the server. The dish should be renamed chicken & snow peas. I really can't see past the rice here. At least it is consistent...consistently dry.  The restaurant has been nicely renovated except for the bathrooms. I honestly think the bathrooms are original from when the building was built. I think the previous owner even threw in the rickety old toilet seat and the nasty garbage cans.  Maybe one day I will find a dish here that finally makes me a fan."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Asian cuisine in Phoenix. I love the waitresses. I always ask them to suggest something different when I go and I haven't been disappointed once. Sometimes I'll just say \"I'm on the mood for something spicy\" and they'll bring me out a dish that is perfect to my description. The general yang's chicken is awesome and the Dragon & Phoenix is my favorite. Also, the calamari is the best I've ever had. HUGE portions too. I always have leftovers. My goal is to try everything on the menu once, hell maybe twice!"}
{"text":"Take these folks back home, so... Atmosphere  - modern, clean, and very , very friendly staff. Food - started with egg drop soup, very good,  different from any I have had before  and hot (temperature ) Ordered house special  Miona's (misspelled I am sure) chicken. Came with sliced, fried chicken strips, white meat, in a sweet and sour sauce.  With,  Lo mein Crab puff Spring roll White rice  All very good and hot.  All for $7.99 plus iced green tea."}
{"text":"This was really, really good!  Came across George and Sons when down looking at a new vehicle in that area.  Attracted by good Yelps.  They were right.  Very pretty restaurant---contemporary with a gentle Asian influence.  Overall, excellent service.  Shout-out to one young man who had a super personality.  I don't know his name, but he was Asian and had glasses and black shirt and pants.  Well, that covers two or three of the young men working there, but this guy was just a sweetie.  On the other hand, maybe they hire all their young guys for great personality?  Anyhow, we were ravenous, so we eschewed appys and went straight for entrees.  I ordered George's Bird Nest, which had calamari and shrimp and scallops with a healthy amount of veggies in a spicy sauce, and then it was cradled n a \"next\" of deep-fried (not greasy) noodles.  DH got the Kung Pao Chicken, DS got the Citrus Scallops and DSG (who I will now refer to as Veggie Girl=VG since she has gone to the Dark Side) got the Asian Vegetable Delight.  Overall---delish!  My seafood was all cooked perfectly and (note to Tonto Grill!) the gianormous scallops did not have a bit of grit!  The sauce was tasty---might have ordered it a touch spicier---and the noodle bowl was pretty cool.  And DS's Citrus Scallops---tempura battered and fried, then dressed in this very light citrus sauce---not sweet or cloying, just perfect-----totally ordering that next time.  VG said her Asian Vegetable Delight was delicious...only DH was a little disappointed.  His Kung Pao chicken was not deep fried, and he likes it battered and fried.  But he said quality and flavor were excellent.  Really good food, good service, nice ambiance---why can't we have a Chinese restaurant like this in Cave Creek?  Anyhow, if you are ever around Deer Valley/101 shopping at dinner time, stop in!"}
{"text":"The most magnificent people you will ever meet.  Quality foremost,  fun first?  Or vice versa.  Great place to get the best tasting food you will ever eat."}
{"text":"Awesome food, not a bad price. My new local asian food place!"}
{"text":"I don't give reviews very often. I heard great things about this place and every time I drive by the place is packed. We looked at the menu online and we chose the bird nest. We ordered it to go. It said it was seafood with a bed of noodles underneath..so that is what we were expecting. Instead they gave us rice. We called to complain about the noodles not being in our order when the menu online clearly states that is what we will get.  First of all, the lady on the phone didn't even know the menu. Secondly when we asked to speak to the manager. The manager was arguing with us and saying we were wrong. The manager was extremely rude. I couldn't believe the customer service was horrendous. We will never be going here again. Ruined our Wednesday night dinner!!!"}
{"text":"Three of us ate there this evening and I was quite unimpressed. We all ordered different  dishes, also wonton soup and the vegetable spring rolls. Quite frankly, none of the entrees or appetizers was very good.  The food was, well....tasteless.  Sesame chicken that looked and tasted like chicken strips from Costco, fried in a sesame seed coating. Spring rolls, only warm in the center, wonton soup... I don't even know how to characterize it. Anyway, not lethal, not bad,  but definitely not worth a second trip."}
{"text":"Mionas special chicken is the best Orange Chicken around. The chicken fried rice it good too. I honestly do not get anything else."}
{"text":"Great, freshly made dishes, excellent service (almost too much attention, if that's possible!), and right by the AMC theater in Deer Valley. Come by 5:30pm and you won't have to wait for a table. No patio, unfortunately, but clean, casual dining room. They seem to have a very busy takeout business too!"}
{"text":"The best tasting Chinese food I've ever had.  The portions are plentiful as well.  Excellent service and quality.  It's a family owned place and a gem for sure.  Will be coming back here again soon.  Wish they had a location in Desert Ridge."}
{"text":"This is pretty good Asian food, and I'm told the best place in that plaza off the 17 and the 101 North. Portion sizes are very generous and pretty good service (up until they sorta questioned my father why he didn't eat his side of white rice - I laughed). It's clean, it's modern, and overall, it was well worth the visit."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just have a craving for Chinese food that needs to be satisfied pronto, you know? I've been to this location several times and the food has always been A+. The restaurant is conveniently located and I've been fortunate enough to go on off hours so I haven't had to wait for a seat. My go to is the shrimp with walnuts, it's almost like a very savory and sweet dessert and oh so yummy! Their lunch portion is pretty good size and also comes with white rice, lo mein, a crab rangoon, and a veggie eggroll. I always have some left over. I've also tried their orange chicken, all of the soups, house chow fun, and a few others. Everything I would recommend. I only docked a star because service can sometimes feel a little rushed especially if it's the end of lunch hour. It would never be enough to keep me away or detour anyone else from coming here. A must try!"}
{"text":"Well my friend and I decided to try this place out. First the positives. I was greeted quickly. Great explainations on the different dishes. Was very disappointed that they were not offering the lunch Buffet. I was told that it was only offered on the weekends. The firecracker shrimp and the other shrimp dish was good. The shrimp were of nice size. But unfortunately my quest of finding  my Chinese food home hasn't come to the end with this place. I will continue to search as the chow mein, egg roll and crab wonton were just average."}
{"text":"Pretty good food for Scottsdale, they offer not just Chinese but few other Asian dishes.  Very clean and nicely decorated inside, located next to Safeway, I always enjoy their food and service every time.  Daily lunch buffet is such a great deal, weekend price is a tad higher than weekday but it comes with mimosa.   I like to order from regular menu, I haven't had any bad food here. I wouldn't say they are authentic but their flavor cater the area residents well without being too Americanized.  Service is always good, friendly and attentive. Owner speaks Chinese and Japanese (and English) to me as he said I look like I speak/understand all the language.  Later I heard he spent 8 years in Japan. No wonder why their teriyaki chicken is pretty solid.  I come here a couple times a year for the past 10 years. May not be frequent but something brings me back here again and again."}
{"text":"We're baaaack! And George & Son's is every bit as good as ever. The wonton soup starter is a must then just let the menu pull you in. My favorite overall dish is the house rice.   We learned something interesting here today. If you eat at George & Son's and have leftovers to take home but are also going to be seeing a movie next door, they will hang on to your leftovers in their fridge for you to pick up after the movie. A nice touch and very smart!"}
{"text":"A staple restaurant for me. Their green tea is so yummy. I always ask for a to go cup. My favorite thing to order there is literally everything.... fresh, fast and friendly."}
{"text":"ill keep this review simple.  the food is striaght up nasty.  the chicmen eas mystery meat and they were recently hit with 6 health code violations.   STAY AWAY!!!!"}
{"text":"This was a huge disappointment! Food was terrible, over salted and over spiced to the point where my friend and I gave up eating and just left! We should have told waiter our food was unacceptable but my friend felt ill so we left. Did not agree with me later in night , was very uncomfortable!"}
{"text":"Service was good, Staff was friendly and the Restaurant itself was nice enough.  My meal (Beef & Rice Noodles) smelled and tasted like the Noodles were cooked in Dish Water- I couldn't finish it.  My son had the Shrimp- threw up when we got home, so I'm concerned it was bad.  My Wife seemed to like her meal, so there is the one Star.  Don't think we'll be back- bill came to $70 for the 3 of us."}
{"text":"George and his staff were classy, accommodating and down to earth. The restaurant itself is romantic and quiet. Everything about this restaurant is EXACTLY what an intimate or family dinner should be like. George goes to each table to ensure 110% satisfaction and the food is exquisite! I HIGHLY recommend this place for romantic dinners or even any event! We will be back each and everytime we want to eat out! FINALLY a restaurant worth talking about!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent.  Very tasty and enough food on each entree to share with 2 or more.  Service was attentive and always checking on us.  Would definitely recommend it for anyone craving some really good chinese food."}
{"text":"Oh em gee. This is the Chinese food I have been dreaming about. Drop everything and get there as fast as humanly possible because holy crap it's good. For the love of god just DO IT! You'll thank me later and be sure to order the orange chicken. Nomnomnommmmmmm"}
{"text":"*STOP SEARCHING BEST CHINESE RESTAURANT AND GO*   OK....Service was out of this world! From sitting down and immediately having water, to drinks being brought right away. Never an empty glass. All servers were so happy and polite.   Food was put of this world....from citrus chicken to chow mein. Also, how did they make fried rice taste like heaven!? Seriously, I could not stop. Fresh and not greasy. HUGE portions.   Came in at 630ish on a Friday night and was empty. Within an hour it was jammed packed. We met George!!! Not only does he walk around and talk to customers, HE WORKS! From serving to bussing. Blew me away.   The Yelp check-in deal is over a year old. He is having some trouble with Yelp. He explained his issue, and it sounds legit. He did honor it because we came all the way from Chandler.   WE WILL BE BACK ASAP!!   FYI....taste amazing left over and even cold. That's legit."}
{"text":"As always, best Chinese restaurant in the valley. I have been to both locations, and it's always amazing! The crab won tons are out of this world, the pot stickers are amazing, and the fried rice will make you want to slap yo mama! The citrus chicken is very good as well."}
{"text":"Soild.  Good food.  A little spendy."}
{"text":"Just WOW. My BF and I came here for the first time and we are so happy to have finally found great Chinese food in our area. We ordered orange chicken, shrimp fried rice, & Mongolian beef. We also ordered wonton soup, egg drop soup, and crab puffs. (yes, we can eat :) )  Well, EVERYTHING was delicious and service was beyond great! We will definitely be coming here for our Chinese fix from now on!"}
{"text":"Great food. We went for dinner on a Groupon and they were very busy but service was still great. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Loved every bite. You need to come here... support this business because I want to see it stick around! You will only need to take this advice once.  First, we got the pot stickers which the gentleman said we're home made - they certainly tasted fresh. Generous portions of juicy pork in a wrapper just the right thickness to hold it all in.  Next, the \"lightly fried\" orange chicken seemed boring but safe (that one was the husband's choice). I was still expecting a thick breading because I feel that I've fallen for this before and been disappointed. My expectations were low. However, I can honestly say it was the best version of this dish I've had. More chicken than breading? Finally! A sauce that isn't goopy but still coats each piece generously!  Lastly, the Singapore chow fun noodle... First time/long time... First time having this dish, though I've seen it on menus and considered it many times before. Again, I was pleasantly surprised. The quality of the ingredients stood out in a way I wasn't expecting for the price. I loved each one - the delicate noodles, the fresh and not over cooked shrimp, the small pieces of pork which were plenty and just the right size for the noodle. No piece cooked poorly, and each coming together to form and flavor the dish - it didn't feel thrown together to try to pass itself off as a dish like similar dishes elsewhere.   This will be our new go-to spot for Chinese in the area.  The price were great too for the quality and size. I think they could charge slightly more except,... I hate to say anything negative because I want people to come eat here... But there is one negative I can think to mention which is the decor/ambiance. We took it carry out as planned before we went in, but I didn't care for the inside. It seemed like it was trying for an upscale look with poor quality materials. Dark colors and a bit tacky paint job, TVs on the wall felt cheapening. It's a shame, but I am happy to carry out my Chinese."}
{"text":"Amazing! Great find. We got the spicey beef and it was delicious. Will defiantly be back."}
{"text":"I've ordered from here for quite some time. It's more expensive than other Chinese restaurants in the area, but they do seem to use higher quality ingredients (more meat, bigger shrimp, etc). In general, the food is pretty tasty. Some of the entrees are a bit boring, as it's just breaded meat with sauce on the side, and hard to tell the difference from any other breaded meat entree. They do have great spring rolls that have ground pork in them, and the shrimp rolls (fried) are stuffed full of shrimp. Fried rice is really good, as are the noodle dishes. It can be hard to order unless you get the American girl, so just know that you should double check the order with them before hanging up.  They do deliver, but some times they don't because their delivery guy has poor attendance.  They sent their chef to deliver my food once, which was cool and I appreciate the effort, but when a chef shows up with the big white Pope chef hat at your door it can be a little weird. I'm not sure how he even drove in that thing but, I digress. Either way, tasty food check it out."}
{"text":"I've heard about this place for a while..decided to check it out..very good and a nice variety of different Asian foods..we had the hot and sour soup, shrimp curry and the mixed bag of a little of everything..very good and big portions..plenty of leftovers.  If you're in the mood for Peking duck you need to order it a day in advance and the yelp discount for check ins doesn't work anymore."}
{"text":"I try to think of something I may not have liked about places when I write a review. For George and Sons, I couldn't think of any. We've been here about 3 times or so and they've always been extremely nice, courtesy and take care of your needs. The portions are completely satisfying. I take pride in finishing my plate but I usually have to take leftovers home from here. Your water is always filled and they are very homey."}
{"text":"This neighborhood gem has been in this location for 14 years and this is my first time back in about 12 years.    The food was truly outstanding and the service was great!  Before I left the restaurant I was already planning my next visit back.  I recommond this spot for lunch or dinner.  George (the owner) also adds a lot of warmth to this cozy and friendly place."}
{"text":"The people are great and so is the atmosphere. Order the sea food pocket and general yangs chicken! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"The crab puffs and calamari were fantastic and a great start to a wonderful meal. Try the Lady Buddy beer from China. The house fried rice, walnut shrimp and pepper beef are to die for, will definitely come back to try other dishes. Service was superb and very attentive to all their customers."}
{"text":"No more good buffet. We came for lunch and had overly salted Kung Pau chicken. Perhaps the chef confused hot with salty.  The other dish is not as it was a while ago.  Perhaps new management."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is always spot on. I normally get the sweet and sour pork with pork fried rice, amazing. The wait staff is always friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Pretty decent Asian food. My family thought it was a little on the salty side, but wasn't bad. I personally liked the pad Thai and the Walnut shrimp. I gave it three stars because my family felt it was salty but I would eat there again. Price reasonable. I hear happy hours it is full."}
{"text":"I ate here while traveling for business and I really enjoyed their food.  If you happen to come here I highly recommend getting the shrimp egg roll.  It takes about 15 minutes to come out but trust me, if you like shrimp, it is worth it.  There is no filler in this egg roll other than shrimp and it is amazing!  I also ordered their Kung Pao Beef and it was good.  i am saying \"good\" because the taste of the quality of the beef was enjoyable.  What I did not care for as much is that this is different than most Kung Pao Beef.  The beef was breaded, the peanuts where chopped up really fine, and it lacked the vegetables that you are used to getting in the dish.  This meal was enjoyable but not what I was expecting when I had ordered.  Had I of known about their unique twist I would have ordered something else.  I won't knock them too much though because it was good.  Where I am taking off a star is with their service.  I decided to sit at their bar because it was just me and I didn't want to take up a whole table on what seemed to be a fairly busy evening.  The experience started off ok but then quickly went down hill because of the lack of service.  I placed my dinner and drink orders pretty quickly and after I received my drink I did not see the bartender again until the egg roll arrived (remember I said it takes 15 mins to make).  I had finished the mixed drink that I was given but was not asked if I wanted another, nor could I ask since he wasn't there.  Another employee brought me my food when it was ready and I still had not seen the bartender.  I was half way finished with my meal by the time he came back to check in.  At that point I desperately wanted a water or soda.  By the time I got that I only had a couple of bites left on my dish.   I do expect a little better service than this if you want to earn a tip!    Overall, I enjoyed the food at this place and will come in again but I promise you that I will not be sitting at the bar!"}
{"text":"Food decent. Portion, mehh. Price, 10$ for a smaller lunch 'special' without a drink? For that, I don't think so. Decided to try anyway to see what the reason was, and if it was worth it... So the answer is a big NO. I don't mind paying that if it's worth the extra money. $10 gets you what the $5.99 Chinese food places get you. Fix the food or fix the prices."}
{"text":"What can I say, I was craving some Chinese food? Did this meet the requirement? Kind of, kind of not.  I would not call this Chinese one bit, I've been lucky enough over the years to try some of the best Chinese restaurants North America has to offer and this is definitely not it.   I would categorize this restaurant as America's take on Chinese food also known as Americanized Chinese food which is fine if that's what you're looking for. I'm not entirely surprised either, that this was more on the Chinese American side; Scottsdale isn't exactly the mecca for oriental cuisine.   I did notice on the website that the Scottsdale menu is priced higher, usually a buck more for the same thing over at the Phoenix location. If you are exactly between the two locations - it might be in your best interest to head to the Phoenix one - otherwise you've got to take gas into consideration.   I was tempted to try the Shrimp Roll everyone raves about, but $4.50 for a single roll seemed a little steep for me. I mean even if it is packed with shrimp it's at best 25 cents to make.   For our appetizer we started with the Spicy Cracking Calamari which was actually my favorite of the meal. It was a little greasy, but I mean it's fried so it's at the level of grease you expect if you know what I mean. My biggest complaint with it, is that it was not spicy one bit - but it was crispy and cooked perfectly, no tough or stringy calamari here. I would have preferred a dipping sauce with this one.   For the mains we ordered the Jumbo Shrimp with Glazed Walnuts - the shrimp were beautiful and large, the walnuts were crispy and perfect. My only suggestion on this one would be to have a little less sauce - some of them were doused a little too much. The other main we tried was the General Yang's Chicken. I am a huge fan of General (enter name here) Chicken. I've tried this dish at countless restaurants and there are usually a few key components that makes a memorable one - spice, lots of spice, crispy chicken and sauce but not too much sauce, and lastly nice fresh broccoli. This General Yang Chicken was a disappointment, it was too heavy on this glue like texture sauce that was incredibly sweet - it is much like the sauce you get on chicken balls. The nuggets had a good amount of white chicken meat, but there was no spice to it. The menu did indicate this was another hot and spicy dish and I had braced myself only to be let down again. I'm sure you can ask for a dish to be spicier (had I known), but when a menu warns you that it's going to be hot and spicy it better deliver. The main dishes were served with white rice (there was no option for brown) and the rice was a little over cooked by my standards - I think I ate about 1/4 cup with my entire meal if that.   The tea is not free here, it is actually $1 a person. The tea is nothing special - it's ok. Service is barely existent, the staff get the job done but are not entirely personable. Food is not timed well. We received the appetizer within 10 minutes of ordering, and it was not another 20 minutes until the mains arrived. I'm sure you're thinking, they must have been busy - they had only 7 full tables at the time we came (it was a little after the lunch hour) and 4 staff out on the floor.   We did have leftovers.. I skipped taking the rice and will be making my own to go with it and LOTS of vegetables. Did I mention vegetables are very skimpy here?   They do run a brunch buffet, and on Sundays it includes mimosas. We opted to order the dishes from the menu because usually made to order ends up being way more delicious and fresh. I did take a look at the buffet and was not very impressed. It is a small buffet and about half the items were nearly out - most of the items were noodle and riced based or soup and again lacking vegetables.   Chopsticks were not offered to us, nor on the table, I did manage to snag a couple sets when I was looking at the buffet. Also strangely there are no sauces on any of the tables. I'm so used to seeing at least a soy sauce if not more at most Chinese Restaurants.   The restaurant was of average cleanliness, bathrooms were OK. Would I go back? Only if I was craving American Chinese - but for real Chinese. Nah. What would it take to get to 5 stars? Better service, lighter on the sauces, but a dipping sauce for the calamari. Spicy dishes that are actually spicy. Perfectly cooked rice and VEGETABLES!!!"}
{"text":"Best lunch place in a while! Fast service, excellent portions, even better prices. If you're looking for a place in the area to stop for lunch try their shrimp and veggie lunch plate. They give you soup, rice, noodles, a full serving of whatever your protein is, a spring roll and a crab puff. Also try their iced tea A++. Phenomenal lunch!"}
{"text":"The lunch buffet rocks. Fresh and fairly priced. Everything tasted great and service was very good. Definitely will go back!"}
{"text":"Why is it so dang hard to find a great Chinese place???  Well, I am happy to say that we have finally found it.  It's located right next to the movie theater, and since we never see movies anymore, it took us a long time to stop in.  The next time I have a craving for lo mien noodles or orange chicken with a competitively priced brew, this is the place you will find me.  The service staff is very attentive and friendly.  The only small, minute thing that bugged me was the white butcher paper they lay on the tables.  It was cut so long that whenever I put my hands in my lap I got a paper cut!  Oops!"}
{"text":"I haven't had Chinese food in about a year. I'm a New Yorker so I am a snob when it comes to certain types of food. I live right down the street and I was craving some good Chinese food. Read the reviews and decided to try......eggplant in garlic sauce....DELICIOUS! Hot and sour soup.....yummy!!!! And I never eat noodles but I was craving lo mein...we got the house lo mein and it was really perfect!!! I will be going back!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good but took WAY too long. It was a very busy Friday night, and hopefully they fix the delay in the kitchen. It is not pleasant to receive appetizers at 6pm and dinner at 7:30."}
{"text":"Sooo hard to find really good Chinese food in valley.  House made potstickers and wonton soup so good!! Not oily like most places..pork fried rice delicious too!!Will be back!!"}
{"text":"So good. Love the Singapore noodles! I wish I could make it here more often! The staff is nice and the inside is clean. I love the dark but inviting interior. I can't remember what my friends ordered but they loved their meals as well."}
{"text":"Great service every time, I always end up getting 3 different items from the chicken menu.  I've sat down and ordered to go here and the food usually arrives pretty fast. I order 3 chicken plates but somehow they only give me 1 n half box of rice. Not 1 box of rice for each. So I guess it's maybe 1 per order??? I would recommend this place"}
{"text":"Being from Seattle I'm a Chinese food snob and am very picky about Asian cuisine   Therefore I was pleasantly surprised when we stumbled onto George and Son after a movie on Sunday afternoon. Great ambience, great service and great food.  The house chow mein was one of the better dishes I've had in any Asian restaurant in the Phoenix area. The veggies were crisp and fresh and the meats were delicious. Refreshing iced blackberry green tea was the perfect accompaniment. Would have preferred some Asian themed music rather than the contemporary American but will not let that keep me from returning. All in all a very good dining experience."}
{"text":"I'm coming back to write another review. After trying several other places (not around where I live) for Chinese food I've decided I really should take their business cards and write 'best chinese' on them. Then strategically placing them in the rest rooms, parking lots, and cars of other inferior places. It's only right that people be eating the best..they deserve it. George and Sons delivers it."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner tonight. I had pot stickers for an appetizer, my son had the steamed salmon and I had the spicy beef. I was concerned the portions looked small, but it turns out they were about right. The pot stickers were pretty standard(they could have included more sauce), but my beef was very tender and well prepared. My only advice would be to kick the spiciness up a notch. Szechuan cuisine should have a little more kick, but it was good. The salmon was prepared perfectly. My son who is a very picky eater, said he enjoyed it, so that is saying something.   It was a little expensive, but I will come back to try some different things and I'd like to try the lunch buffet too. After living in Iowa for 9 years (Ex-NYer), it was good to have decent Chinese fare for a change."}
{"text":"We arrived just before noon and there was a line. Since there are lots of places to eat in the area it seemed to be a good sign that it was worth the wait. The egg drop soup was ok; nothing special. My husband had broccoli beef, which he said was good. I had Kung pao chicken and while it was different than any I had had before, it was very tasty and tender. The vegetable rolls were only fair but the crab wontons were good. Overall, it wouldn't be a place that we would go out of our way for, but if you're in the area you might give it a try."}
{"text":"So so good. This place was packed, and for good reason. My wife and I were looking for legit lo mein and Chinese comfort food, and this place hit the spot. I recommend doing take out to avoid the line..."}
{"text":"This place deserves 5 stars without a question! There are very few places where you can say the food, service, quality, decor, ambiance, everything is great! Becky is excellent and we are definitely going back. The place is clean, food is amazing. We ordered the Tres Amigos and veggie crispy rolls and they were amazing! Oh! And the price is even better! We only ordered one Tres Amigos for under $14 and it was more than enough for a couple."}
{"text":"Awesome place... Ordered take out and it was ready before time.. Food was very tasty and spicy as we wanted. I loved the packing also.. Restaurant was very well decorated and prices were very reasonable.."}
{"text":"The food is very good. The problem is the lady cook who insults you in Chinese while smiling and saying nice things in English.( same lady that Natalia G. met) You can get insulted like this in San Francisco Chinatown and it doesn't cost as much."}
{"text":"I heard great things about this place and I was really anticipated it. I wanted to like it. I ordered also for a friend to say \"thank you\" for doing me a favor, & we were both very unimpressed. Maybe it was an off-night. I have to believe this was an isolated experience.  The lady taking my order was very courteous and helpful. I spent $50 for two (including delivery) & it's so bad I'm throwing away the leftovers.  No question the absolute worst Pad Thai I've ever had; but in all fairness, I've had some of the best. It doesn't even qualify.   I honestly hate leaving negative feedback like this & I rarely ever do, but this called for it. I would have enjoyed more a $0.25 packet of Ramen & a can of Spam. Sorry, but true story. I trust this is not the case for everyone, but no second chance is qualified for me. I do wish you the best though."}
{"text":"Omg they are so good. My girl is from NY and its hard to get her to eat or anywhere but she loved there food. There shrimp rolls were so good!"}
{"text":"Really good food and cooked to perfection. Veggies cooked crisp and flavorful. Decor is not too fancy and they have a full bar."}
{"text":"Best chinese food in Scottsdale. We used to go to Flo's and Jade's Place all of the time, but after always getting a stomach ache when eating at those places, we tried George & Son's.  We now only go to George & Son's and probably get take or or eat there once a week.  They use fresh ingredients and the food is not greasy like the other places."}
{"text":"This place was a pleasant surprise!  I went for lunch on a weekday.  The service was unheard of - absolutely excellent.  I had half a dozen people waiting on my every need.  The food came out quickly - hot and delicious.  I had the Dragon & Phoenix (chicken and shrimp). Their unsweetened Chinese iced tea doesn't even need sugar.  I had originally planned on just having a sandwich at Subway, but the line was out the door.  I gave George & Son a try, and I foresee many future lunches there."}
{"text":"Excellent Chinese and superb service. I tried this place on a groupon and I am hooked."}
{"text":"Great food! George is terrific.  Basil chicken is to die for. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Excellent food, efficient and friendly staff. The lunch buffet is to die for!"}
{"text":"Excellent Chinese food everything is top quality and has its own unique flavors. Great drinks and very attentive staff! One of our new favorite Chinese places I just wish we lived closer!"}
{"text":"Food was phenomenal, and the staff is some of the best i've ever come across. Our server was one AMAZING. He brought an extra dish free of charge just for us to try since we had never been there. Absolutely coming back"}
{"text":"Have eaten here several times and it is usually great but tonight I ordered fried rice with my entree and the server told me I could only have white rice with my meal.  Not happy!"}
{"text":"We ordered spring rolls for an appetizer, mu shu pork, shrimp with walnuts, and teriyaki chicken for our entrees. The spring rolls were good and started the meal out right. That was the only highlight. The entrees were overly sweet and were very small portioned for the price. The chicken in the teriyaki was dry and stringy. I had really high hopes for this place based on previous reviews and I was pretty disappointed. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and it was excellent. The food was great and the servers were very accommodating."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal Chinese food. I'm originally from New Jersey and sad to say that most of Arizona Chinese cuisine just does not compare. This is by far the BEST Chinese food I have had since moving here 8 years ago. If you have not given this place a try you should because it is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Good deal for lunch and the food was good but not great! I had eggplant dish for lunch it came with egg drop soup, (it was delicious), rice, fried noodles and egg roll & fried wonton.   Everything was good, but I didn't like the eggplant dish because it taste a bit sour and I wasn't crazy about the  sour sauce.  Service was good and they were very nice."}
{"text":"Very interesting sweet and sour had kind of a spice to it but good. The pork itself wasn't my favorite but it was good. The rice was very sticky. Unfortunately I had to get it to go so  I missed out on a lot that the great food specials have to offer. But I would def go again."}
{"text":"Love George Yang, my wife and I frequented his Sesame Inn location on 40st and Camelback 20+yrs ago. With \"George and Son\" he bring the same Excellent flavors/quality. This location is a bit of a trek for me now but I still pop in when in the north valley. I'm very excited for his new venture, \"George Yangs\" on north 16th st.(old Golden Phoenix). We will Once Again be regulars! George has excellent food and a great smile. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. It is clean, quick service and excellent food. It's nice to have a Chinese restaurant in town that has more ambience and better quality food. I highly recommend it.  Loved everything we ordered--including the fish dishes--which we'd never done at a Chinese restaurant.  Definitely worth getting adventurous over."}
{"text":"MSG heaven!!!!   please be warned... If you have an allergy to MSG like I do. I get headaches when too much MSG is used. And tonight I got a very big headache from eating the food . When you taste the food... It's really obvious that MSG is and everything. Because the flavoring and the salty taste is the same throughout every dish.  I'm always amazed at Americans love of really bad Chinese food. Chinese food in the USA at these kind of restaurant is not even close to what real Chinese food taste like.  I lived in Asia for six years... One year in China.   1) Pu Pu Platter... It was exactly as the name suggests. Everything is fried.... It was over fried and very hard.  Was definitely not worth $14 for two people  2) shrimp fried rice. Something that even a Chinese takeout place should not be able to mess up. The rice was mushy... It tasted like dirt. And the shrimp obviously was not fresh... And very salty. Vegetables used are frozen ... their not fresh.   3) chicken lettuce wraps... Basically they use the same frozen peas and carrots for every dish they make. So they bought some minced chicken... And then threw some frozen peas and carrots in it.  Loaded with MSG... And the only good thing about it was the sweet brown sauce.  I read through many of the reviews... And I just don't understand how people can give this restaurant four or five stars. I've eaten here before and ate the buffet. I thought that I would give them another chance and actually eat for dinner service.  If this is the best Chinese food around as other reviews say... Then these people have never eaten good Chinese food before in their life.  I've eaten better Chinese food at airport Chinese faster restaurants.  it's really expensive... For what you get. No fresh vegetables... Everything frozen... And loaded with MSG.  #disappointimg"}
{"text":"Quality ingredients and amazing flavors! 2 great locations... I would frequent the Scottsdale location and that was always delicious. Having a G&S right by my house could get dangerous :) Great service too!"}
{"text":"We've been going here since George and Miona took over.  As my previous posts have expressed it is really good. Hood service, good food, good ambiance.  Tonight I had a whole new great experience.  I placed a to go order by phone and when I got there realized I didn't have my wallet.  No Apple Pay so I called my husband who read off the card numbers to me.  Parkin, the wonderful guy helping me up front tried and tried to make the machine take it, no go.  He asked my husband to take a photo of the card (very resourceful) but my husband can barely answer the phone let alone take a picture. I told him I'd go home and get the card.  He offered to give me his number and i could send a picture when I got home, which I did.  It worked!  Parkin went above and beyond to get me and my food home with the least amount of effort on my part even though it was ALL MY FAULT.  Miona and George, good job hiring a truly fabulous employee.  Thank you Parkin!"}
{"text":"Not only is George and Son's super tasty, but George himself is one of the funniest nicest guys you will meet!   My company has hosted the annual Christmas luncheon at Georges two years in a row now, and there is a good reason why, The food is ALWAYS spot on and the service is always above and beyond!   My boss always orders ahead of time and it seems like coarse after coarse comes out from the kitchen.   Some of the highlights that stick out in my head, The Shrimp with glazed walnuts, the noodles w/chicken, and the pot stickers. We had about 8 different dishes and I cant pretend to remember them all.   One note of warning. George likes to mess with people. My boss had duck sent to the table, George set the plate in front of me with the ducks fried head just staring back at me! Eeeep! hahah   If you are up in this neck of the woods go drop by!"}
{"text":"Great Hong Kong Style Won Ton soup.  They have Lo carb healthy dishes.  This is one of the only great Chinese restaurants in phoenix"}
{"text":"We made the drive up there from Tempe based on the excellent reviews.  The food and service was fine, but in our opinion not necessarily worth the drive.  My wife had a yummy shrimp dish and I had the thai style chicken it was just okayish."}
{"text":"We had dinner tonight based on Yelp reviews.  We were NOT disappointed. The food was delicious, the service was excellent and the restaurant was spotless. We will be back!  We intend to tell  anyone who will listen about the \"Diamond  in the desert\"."}
{"text":"Best Asian food in the area! We used to drive from north Phoenix to Scottsdale to eat here. We are happy they opened a location near 17/101 area! We live the Tres Amigos!"}
{"text":"I was on my lunch break and intended to go to Panda Express, but then I saw the \"Grand Opening\" sign for George & Son practically next door. I went in to take a look at the menu, and upon seeing their reasonable lunch menu pricing decided to eat here instead.  I ordered the Thai Curry Chicken lunch special, which came with the chicken, salad, crab puff, vegetable roll, lo mein and steamed rice. The salad was the only item I didn't particularly care for because it was iceburg lettuce tossed in ranch(?) dressing. Everything else was fantastic.  Their iced tea (unsweetened) is also very good. My coworker and I were able to get in and out in our hour lunch. I will definitely come back (especially to try the Thai Spicy Basil Chicken, it was highly recommended by our server after I told her how delicious the Thai Curry Chicken was)."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night before going to the theatre to see a movie. The food is delicious! I was pleasantly surprised. The orange chicken was fresh and the noodles were amazing. Will definitely be coming back for the great food and awesome customer service."}
{"text":"Summary of a weekday lunch @ 12ish :  Greeted and got our choice of seats   Took our drinks ( iced cold water)   Gave us a couple of minutes to decide what to order 7/10 , they are always up on you , at times I felt their urge of me leaving for them ?  idk.   Asked and they brought what I wanted    Their LUNCH SPECIAL IS AMAZING! You get your little appetizer ( veggie roll && a cream cheese wonton ) with your choice of Entrée and half where rice && noodles    I ordered the Tres Amigos Entrée  minus the beef   Pretty great deal for 8.95 if you ask me    Customer service is great , but STOP the rushing."}
{"text":"Only picked up take out, but the staff was nice, Kung Pao chicken and potstickers- both items were very good. Quick service - I ordered and was able to pick up within 20 mins. I'll be back next time to dine in"}
{"text":"The lunch buffet was very good. Reasonably priced. Great service. The food was made in smaller portions so none went to waste. Overall this point they would be highly recommended."}
{"text":"Food was cold (still frozen), I had the ribs.  This is NOT as good as it used to be.  Had takeout last week, food again was cold and not up to what other restaurants are serving.  Will NOT go back."}
{"text":"Went on Christmas Day with one other and both of us thought the food was excellent.   The hot sour soup, which is my product to grade the quality of the restaurant, is very good.  They even throw one shrimp in each bowl.  It was a tad hot for me, but my companion said he wished it were hotter.  Different strokes I guess. He had the walnut shrimp which he loved.  I had the chicken with veggies which was so fresh and tender.  It was the best chicken and veggie dish I ever had at a Chinese place, cause I am convinced everything there is cooked individually and super super fresh. Normally, I don't care for Chinese, but this being a major holiday all the other restaurants  almost are closed.  They were packed, but we got right in and sat down.  Service is super  good as they all work together as a team, so your tip goes into a pot to be split later when they close.  I think we had something like 6-7 people take our plates off the table and re-get tea for us and so forth.  You want for nothing at this place. Prices were very reasonable (couple bucks more each item and a cut down menu) for Christmas Day, too. The decor is modern and nice without being too over the top, by the way. This is our new go-to for Chinese. Like I said before, I never have liked Chinese all that much...but I do really like George & Sons!  Try it!!!  We'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Going to George and Sons is like going home and having my mom cook me a homemade meal - having grown up in the area George and Sons was a frequent take out spot as a teenager! The food was good then and it's just as good if not better now! They have killer egg rolls, they don't skimp on portions (imagine a shrimp dish with more than half a dozen shrimp!) and service was awesome and imagine my surprise when good ol' George was there not only greeting patrons but bussing tables and ensuring things ran smoothly! They have live music on Saturday nights, an awesome lunch buffet during the week and a full bar!"}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorite spots for Asian food. Their customer service here is outstanding! The food is absolutely above average. The restaurant has a nice cozy family feel to it"}
{"text":"Headed here for dinner before a movie. Had never had it before. This will not be the last time. Had General Yang's Chicken and was one of the best dishes I've ever had. Spicy and sweet and was able to add broccoli. Have no problem ordering it every time I go, but will try some of the other dishes, too."}
{"text":"This place is sooooooo good! We visit all the time and have never had a single issue. Their food is amazing and fresh, and all their staff is kind and attentive. The 3 seas and calamari are the best! My kids love their orange chicken. Even their salads are great! We order it to go and the quality is still the same! Definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"I love Asian but eat it infrequently as my husband doesn't care for it.  I had Christmas dinner at George's and thought it to be the best.  They were crowded that night but managed to present all dishes served to our table in a timely manner and properly prepared.  It's spoiled me for other Asian restaurants.  As I said, best ever!!! Didn't know this type cuisine could be this great!  I understand George is quite knowledgeable about wine and found that to be true also.  Go there, eat, enjoy!"}
{"text":"All I can say is that this food is DELICIOUS!!! There is so many options for vegetarian. Hot & sour soup was so good I'll be ordering it every time I visit! The sauces had lots of flavor in 3 dishes our family ordered. You won't regret coming here"}
{"text":"I was starving so my review might be a little biased. I got the shrimp with broccoli lunch special. It came with small white rice, some Lo me in, and a small egg roll and crab puff. Everything was tasty but nothing spectacular. It was on the way home so I stopped but I wouldn't drive from my house just to go. However, if I'm in the area, I'd eat here again."}
{"text":"First time, a Yelp find, and sooo delicious!! We had the crab wontons that were good and the wonton spinach and pork soup as our appetizer. The soup was so good I ordered more to take home!  We had the Kung pu chicken, orange beef, and veggie fried rice for our entree. All of it was very good! The orange beef was my favorite!  We had their fried banana dessert at the end and loved it!  We went home with three boxes of left overs too!"}
{"text":"I consider myself a food snob, and this place was delicious!!! We were visiting from LA in search of good food and found this gem. We ordered the calamari appetizer, potstickers. The calamari is a must!!!! One of the best I've ever had. For entrees we had chow mein, eggplant and the Kung pao seafood trio. Absolutely delicious, especially the kung pao...wow!!! It's very hard to find a Chinese restaurant where everything you order is so tasty. The wait staff was very attentive and super friendly. We definitely put this on our list and will keep coming back when in town. Can't say enough good things about this place. You must check it out!"}
{"text":"From the time we walked through the door, this place was first class!!! Warm inviting atmosphere, extremely friendly staff and amazing food!! Becky was our waitress and we couldn't have asked for better service, she knew exactly what we needed before we even thought to ask for it! So attentive!! Becky alone is a reason to come back!! The general yang chicken, house chow mein and citrus chicken were all to die for!!  Will definitely be back again and again!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I recently moved across the street from George & Son's and found a local treasure! They have big portions for an affordable price and all entrees come with rice.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Fantastic Saturday and Sunday champagne brunch!! Food was terrific and service was awesome."}
{"text":"We have been coming to this place since they first opened and couldn't say enough great things about the owners, staff and delicious food. Haven't had anything yet that we didn't like and for price, it's a steal. The owners are always on site during busy nights and make their guests feel welcome and comfortable. The service is friendly and very prompt. We will continue coming here to enjoy this great atmosphere and amazing Asian cuisine!"}
{"text":"Food & service was great!  Waitress was very nice and explaining dishes to us and giving us recommendations.  Would highly recommend this place.  But, definitely ask questions about some of the dishes, as they are not as normal as some places would do them. Very flavorful!"}
{"text":"I have been there many times, and I would say it is my first and best choice for chinese food. They are very delicious, and all the food are fresh and hot. It is an excellent choice for chinese food. I always can get my wonderful meal there. I like the shrimp chow mein and sizzling pepper beef. Everything was awasome there. Like it so much. hope this review can help someone who would like to find excellent food place."}
{"text":"Couldn't have been better. The food and service were both awesome. We will be back! I had the spicy beef which was sooooooo yummy and the hubby had the Three Seas and it was absolutely delicious and I'm actually not a \"seafood person\" so you know it was impressive if I liked it!"}
{"text":"In my opinion one if the best Chinese restaurants in phoenix and the service is always good."}
{"text":"Went to George and Sons today at around 1:45 for lunch.  The lunch special was really nice.  You could choose an entree and each entree came with white rice, lo mien noodles, a crab puff and a spring roll.  Everything was very hot and delicious.  They asked how spicy you wanted your entree, it was great!  The service was really great too.  There were many servers waiting on us and all were very friendly.  Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"I recently found this restaurant and it is the best Chinese restaurant in Phoenix!! Every meal I have had has been better than the one before. There service is also out of this world and I am hooked. You must go and visit you will not regret it"}
{"text":"George's is a Chinese place with a friendly environment and very nice, attentive waitstaff. At least 4 different servers came to refill drinks, clear our table, ask how we liked our meal, etc. They gave us a sample salad to try, and even offered another sample plate but we had so much food coming, we said no thanks. We got the Hot and Sour Soup for 2, which was perfectly spicy and loaded with tofu, chicken, and shrimp. We both had an entree and split fried rice, and had tons of food left over. Their website has a 15% off coupon which we used, and they were even kind about that, too! If you check in on Yelp you get another 15% coupon to use.  Probably not the absolute best Chinese you'll ever have, but by far some of the best customer service at a restaurant that I've ever seen."}
{"text":"We love coming to this restaurant. After moving to the neighborhood, we tried several different Chinese restaurants and none felt right. From our first visit, the staff went out of their way to make our dinner to our specifications.  (I'm a vegetarian. My husband requests some ingredients be omitted.) They know our orders and are so pleasant to us. It's our regular Friday night date."}
{"text":"Best orange chicken I've ever had hands down. Also hot and sour soup was on point. A little spicy for my Nana, but my Papa and I loved it:)    Wonderful staff as well. They seemed to truly care about our dining experience. Definitely will go again."}
{"text":"Appalled at the service I just received! I have only written 1 other review and redownloaded the Yelp app just to tell people about their horrible way I was just treated. I am currently on a no carb diet and initially appreciated the options here. I opted for a veggie lunch special since it included soup/salad with my veggies. Website said they open at 10:30 so I took my lunch break at that time. After arriving, turns out they actually don't open till 11. Fine.. I'll wait 30 min. At 11, I ordered my food to go. After receiving my food, got in my car, I realized they didn't give me my requested spicy mustard and the soup/salad that comes with the lunch specials. I go back in (lunch break about over now) to get my items and was told that soup/salad is for dine in only- not take out. Ok... That's not mentioned online... I would've gotten lettuce wraps or something else instead of just eating $10 worth of veggies. Their response? \"Oh well that's how it is\" ok... Well, can you give me at least some soup for the false advertising? Of course not! The manager isn't there. But they would refund my $ if I returned my food. Ok.. I have no time to get anything else to eat now. So, can I please get 1/2 my money back since I can only eat 1/4 of the actual food I got? No! They said they'd give me $1! lol A DOLLAR! And the manager wasn't there to speak with.It comes down to this, to keep a customer, do what it takes. This was your fault for not having accurate info on your website! Twice! And you won't make it right? We are talking about $5!!!! If you're looking to spend $10.78 on a cup of vegetables, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"This place it is not a buffet and will not honor the 15% stays the contract has expired,therefore will not do it. Overprice and unfriendly customer service."}
{"text":"Excellent food, the best orange chicken we've ever had.  Great service, food, and atmosphere. We started with the lettuce wraps, chicken wings and ended with the orange chicken.  We asked for brown rice and it was perfect.  Thank you."}
{"text":"Was craving Chinese food with the family and took to Yelp to find this local gem. Wow I've very happy we did. Located in the AMC parking lot George and Sons was easy to find. From all of the good reviews we decided to try.   First off the restaurant looks great. Classy inside but chill enough for us not to be dressed up. Second of all the food was very good. We shared several items. Including orange chicken, beef and broccoli, noodles, and walnut shrimp. All of her items were excellent and we were impressed that the food had flavor but did t have much grease that sadly follows a lot of Chinese restaurants!   The portions were very good. I would say my favorite was the orange chicken but really everything was done very well. We will remember George and Sons and will visit again soon."}
{"text":"This is our 3rd visit and I can't say enough about them! Delicious food, friendly and extremely attentive staff. This is probably my favorite place to eat. You should definatley try it!"}
{"text":"Very Good! As we were entering the restaurant a woman told us, \"don't waste your time here\". I was a little skeptical and am very picky when it comes to Chinese food; but decided to give it a shot. This place was delish! We ordered the shrimp rolls. lettuce wraps, crab wantons and fried rice to split among all of us. The service could have been better, as they were completely dead, but the food was superb."}
{"text":"I'm always pleased with the service here. It's fast and the food is high quality and delicious. They do accommodate healthier options, you just have to ask for sauce on the side or no salt or oil for any of the dishes. The staff was so friendly and nice. I left my to go box on the table and the waitress actually ran out to the end of the parking lot after me to give it to me! I couldn't believe it but it was VERY appreciated! Definitely recommend this place for good family style Asian cuisine!"}
{"text":"Decided to venture out for Chinese food on Christmas and chose this restaurant based on the Yelp reviews. Thank you, yelpers...it was delicious! It wasn't greasy and everything was fresh & hot. We had the general yang chicken, house fried rice and crab puffs. Everything was awesome- especially the crab puffs which are a hit or miss at most places. We will definitely be back very soon!"}
{"text":"3.5 - 4 stars  They don't have a huge selection for lunch, but it's cheap and what they do have out is really good."}
{"text":"This is the second time we stopped into this restaurant and they did not disappoint either time! The food is so good! I had the Kung Pao shrimp and the hubby had the orange chicken. Let's talk about the orange chicken!!!! Not heavily breaded at all and a delight to the taste buds! Definitely going on the list of places to return. Everything was fresh and hot and not swimming in sweet processed sauce but delicious, just made goodness! Date night, YES!!!!"}
{"text":"George Yang is the king of Scottsdale Chinese food. Will never disappoint. I've seen so-so reviews on the buffet...all I can say is that if you're dumb enough to go to ANY buffet, you deserve what you get. Who wants picked over barely got food anytime of the day? Lunch specials are usually plenty so skip the buffet. For dinner though, this is as good as it gets. Family owned and run. Quality experience. Don't go for the buffet-order a meal."}
{"text":"We ate here on lunch last week. VERY good food and excellent service! We ordered the orange chicken and teriyaki chicken lunch specials. You get a ton of food for the price ($8 for lunch special). The orange chicken came out super crispy and the teriyaki chicken was very tender. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"I visited this with friends and was expecting medicare chinese food. I think I received it. It is neither good nor bad. However, the service is exceptional. The waiters/waitresses were very nice and approachable and helped as much as possible. 8/10 would go back!"}
{"text":"We had my father's birthday dinner here and we were not disappointed in the family style meal. The rice was light and fluffy. My son's orange chicken was incredible and he even ate it as left overs (very rare occurrence) the next day. I am not much of a soup person, but my family raved about the soup. A great place to celebrate my dad and a wonderful meal.  Very clean and great staff! Thank you George and Son's."}
{"text":"I have eaten at several Chinese restaurants in Scottsdale, most of them have watered down the Chinese flavor and spices to meet the flat palettes of the folks who live here - most of which are from the North and Northeast - and who really have little tolerance for spice, which is too bad.  So the Chinese restaurants cater to this crowd such as Flo's....AWFUL....  Nevertheless, George & Son's is a good place to get okay Chinese - and they too water it down, but not as much as the others in the area.  Don't get me wrong, I was bred on Chinese food in L.A. and Sacramento where spice is standard...I like it HOT!  Even when I ask for really hot, it doesn't even break a sweat on me it is that mild...  The flavors are good and the meat tender.  I've been here several times, so that ought to tell you it's okay!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for Chinese delivery but wow is it pricey. The high bill might be because it's delicious and you want to order so much!!!! Best place for Chinese in the area."}
{"text":"Placed an order to go being the only customer, took 25 minutes Quoted 10-15 minutes.  Great food, slow, forgetful service.   4/5 stars."}
{"text":"4years living in AZ looking for good Chinese food & I think we found it. First time here and this place is delish and the service is great. Jose was awesome!! The citrus chicken & veggie noodles were my favorite."}
{"text":"Do not take your toddler here. We love Asian food and wanted to try this place very badly. I got the citrus chicken which was okay and my wife got the sesame chicken which was bland. They did bring us out a sample of their Miona chicken which was very good. The strange part was my 20 month old daughter was fascinated by the waterfall display and wanted to check it out next thing you know they are giving us a togo menu saying our daughter cant sit still and next time we should order to go ? It was the strangest thing we have experience at a restaurant with our daughter. THREE times they told us to order TO GO next time. We felt that our daughter who was well behaved was not wanted in the restaurant. After this experience and the so so food we will not be back."}
{"text":"Actually tastes pretty good for Chinese food in Phoenix, ofcourse nothing like back home in ny but their food is really good, and fresh and service is great. Ambience is very soothing as well"}
{"text":"So who's the jackhole that didn't mention this place is a high falootin' date night type of joint? Maybe I just didn't read the reviews real well.  Service was impeccable. Water and tea always filled to capacity.  After getting past the language barrier ordering dinner, our food literally flew out.   Bob with the orange chicken. Myself with the suns chicken low carb style with extra jalapeno.  bob says his was excellent. Mine was very good. Asked for some chili paste and even it didn't quite bring it up to my heat level.  I guess a lunch buffet is served? I'd like to try that I bet its excellent.  then an almond cookie? my cryptonite."}
{"text":"My friend and I went here for lunch because of the good Yelp reviews. I ordered Kung Pao chicken and it lacked flavor and was a little dry. He had the Mongolian beef and it had the same problem. We shared some fried rice and it also was dry and lacking flavor.  I would expect this level of food at a buffet, not at a self proclaimed \"fine Asian Cuisine\" restaurant.  They were very busy and the staff was obviously over their head in terms of handling the situation. It was hard to get water and very difficult to check out.  Needless to say, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Love this place. Has a fantastic atmosphere and the employees/ownership are fantastic everytime I have gone here they have been super friendly and always made sure my drink was full(oddly very important to me) The crispy beef is amazing and portions are large enough to bring some home. Pricey in comparison to panda but with every dollar being its fresh and taste 10x better. Also the iced tea is great every time I have gotten it(every time i have gone because it's about all i drink out) it has been fresh and has great flavor."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with this place, the food was not at all good nor Spicey nor well presented and the server was extremely difficult to communicate with. Our orders were messed up entirely and, even though we had a difficult person in our party, the whole evening was bad. Won't be going back for sure and if you want real Asian food I suggest you go to an authentic restaurant."}
{"text":"When I visited Arizona last time, I found this Chinese restaurant near the spot we're staying.  I really like the food here in general. Some basic chinese platters are above average. They obviously have the best chinese food in town  Must get: Kung Pao chicken, Mongolian beef, and fried rice (any kind is fine).  Besides that, the wine selection they have is pretty awesome as well. Sorry didn't take any picture....since I'm Chinese, I don't realy feel like taking a pic of chinese food..."}
{"text":"Food is great. A little too pricey for me though. Again I always just get ridden off because I look young so of course I didn't get the best service. Especially when the table across from me has the manager there checking on them every minute and never touched my table.  I would just order takeout here."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I order take out from George at least 3 times a month.  Their calamari is so yum.  I've gotten multiple dishes from here and they've all just been wonderful.  The best by far is the Spinach Fried Rice.  Don't forget to join George for New Years Eve dinner!  It's the place to be!  When my relatives come out here for the holidays, we always go to George and Sons!"}
{"text":"The family enjoyed the spinning glass top in the middle of the table. Becky was a very accommodating server. We came at a great time-4:00. The restaurant was almost empty. Food was prompt and fresh. The extensive menu will surely offer you something you'll enjoy."}
{"text":"UGGGGGH.  OK.  First things first: Why the EFF is there a UNI poster adorning the dining room wall here?  As a still bitter, still angry, still crying Jayhawk, I could NOT believe my eyes when I spied this poster.  ARG.  Anyway.  My mom and I were in Arizona visiting the grandparents for a while.  My aunt and cousin had been out a few weeks prior and they all went to George & Son's.  A good time was had by all, so the gparents figured they'd take us here too.  We arrived around 6:00 (lay off, it was grandparent dinner time) and there were maybe 3 other tables in the place.  However,  as soon as we sat down and started perusing the menu, the place got crowded.  Good sign, right?  Well, NOT if the subsequent dining experience is what the crowd brought.  One girl came up and asked our drink order.  Water only, so easy enough.  Another came up and took our order.  I ordered the \"spicy\" tofu and vegetables (more on that soon), my mom ordered the spinach fried rice and both grandparents go the Kung Pao beef.  Still another girl came out with our food...well.  All the food but mine.  \"Your's is coming out, OK?\" she said to me.  Yeah, sure, no big deal.  I hung out, sampled my mom's rice (really tasty.  REALLY green.  It was like what the Incredible Hulk would have made for fried rice.), and waited.  ....aaaaaaaaaand.  Waited.  Girl who brought the food back finally caught my eye.  \"Oh, fourth dish, coming!\"  ....more waiting.  Apparently, they had to kill the tofu back there to get it in my dish.  Finally, my god-foresaken dinner arrived.  To their credit, it was really tasty: Fried strips of tofu, a medley of tasty vegetables.  However, this was NOT. SPICY. AT. ALL.  I'm kind of a wimp at spicy food but I'm getting better with it.  This was legit LAUGHABLE.  I wanted a bottle of Sriracha to drown my food in.  Oh!  And rice didn't come with the meals.  WHAT.  We finally asked for boxes for the three plates of food we had leftover.  Some guy came out with one small box for it all.  Commence hair ripping out.  We finally got three to-go containers and requested the bill.  You better believe I made sure to spy to see if our 15% off coupon had been added.  It had.  One of the few good things to happen during this trip.  Food is tasty enough.  Service is a complete joke.  (I noticed the table across from us waited and waited and waited and asked about their food and waited and waited some more.  Then everyone's food arrived, but the (leather-skinned, always on her phone, wouldn't shut up her obnoxious crying kid so I didn't really feel bad for her) mom waited and waited some more for the same dish I ordered.  And then an order of sauteed green beans came about 15 minutes after all their food had arrived.  Ugh.)"}
{"text":"The service at George & Sons, is incomparable. Kind, friendly, professional, friendly, welcoming .... even that doesn't say it all... always at the ready, attentive, helpful, knowledgeable, generous...   I'm from back east so I think I have my own built in preferences for \"genuine\" Chinese food. We've only been here 7 times, so although I think that's enough times to give a good review, I also think I have so much more to sample. We try something new each time, and I can't say anything has been a never again item.   We never leave here feeling unsatisfied or unhappy either with food or service. We're fans!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for lunch and ordered off the lunch menu.  Food was not memorable, but wasn't bad. I got the Mongolian Beef lunch special. It was okay, but the portions are generous... comes with rice, lo mien, crab ragoon, etc.  My husband got the pork & string beans lunch menu. And he enjoyed it. But this isn't the place to be wowed at, or something we'd crave again."}
{"text":"We stopped in on a whim, and to my delight, found this to be the best Asian fusion food around! We had the Orange chicken, Kung Pao 3 seas, and the house chow mien. All I can say is BOMB.COM!!!"}
{"text":"We came here last night for dinner.    Our appetizer was their crab puffs.  They were okay, but the filling was a little disappointing.  I guess my family was spoiled by Abacus's crab puffs.  It just seemed to be very light in imitation crab, and it was mostly just cream cheese.  It was more of a Cream Cheese Rangoon that you would get from Panda Express.  Our main course was Egg Foo Young and Sesame Chicken.  They were both served with a giant bowl of rice for family sharing.  I personally enjoy that because it allows us to taste a lot of everything.  Since my wife is all about that, it is starting to rub off on me.  The Egg Foo Young was good.  Personally, I felt it was kind of bland.  It wasn't something I found to be any better or worse than any other restaurant.  My wife enjoyed it, though.    The Sesame Chicken was a little weird.  On the positive, it was giant chicken breast.  The sauce was poured over it at table side.  That was different.  It tasted pretty good, and I do enjoy the larger family dishes to share.  It makes me feel like I get more for my money when we eat there.  Overall, they checked on us all the time to make sure we enjoyed it.  I felt very welcome there.  I am only taking off a star because of the crab puff because I cannot do a 4.5 review.  Either way, I enjoy this restaurant, and we will come back down here again."}
{"text":"My Fiancee and I visited this new establishment after watching a movie at AMC.  We are so glad we did! The decor is very modern and clean, and the food is delish! We got lunch specials and left feeling very satisfied. The food was fresh and very flavorful. We will definitely be back again! ALSO, everyone was SUPER friendly and NICE! It was awesome =)"}
{"text":"This is my go-to authentic Chinese food. The food is absolutely amazing. It is served family- style and the portions are relatively big. The ambiance is relaxing and aesthetically pleasing. They are very quick when you order to go orders. The staff is very friendly. Family friendly restaurant. Great place for any occasion."}
{"text":"This is excellent Chinese food.  Great portion size and amazing flavor!  The Tres Amigos is a sizzling skillet of chicken, beef and shrimp in a yummy brown sauce with veggies- Yum!  The wings are a cross between Buffalo and Bejing.  Soup is good, fish is good- haven't had any complaints there."}
{"text":"Amazing.  If there is still a word to describe amazing service and commitment to great dinning experience.  I pinch myself again to just make sure this is not a dream.  It has been a pleasure and just happiness for the care given by staff.  The food extends there care and exceptional taste they offer. Thanks to all the staff for great dinner."}
{"text":"It's possible that George & Son's has slipped lately, but from my experience three stars is generous.  They were still moderately busy on a Thursday evening, but that won't last if their food quality doesn't improve over what my wife and I were served.    Take, for example, that Chinese staple Crab and Scallop bake (appetiser).  I wondered how they would give a Chinese touch to a dish like that and I found out -- they didn't.  I couldn't find any crab, just small bay scallops, maybe a bit of cheese and bread crumbs, and tons of salt, in a filling that might have been mayonaise.  It did have one unusual ingredient however -- sand ... lots of sand!  To the cook: please rinse well before using.  Portions were generous and prices were typical of neighborhood Chinese restaraunts ($10-$13 for an entree).  They appear to use good ingredients but cook them indifferently.  For example, the Orange Chicken used nice size chunks of white meat chicken, but they were fried in a crust that charitably could be called undistinguished (flour and baking powder?).  The orange sauce was mild, almost tasteless, with no hint of acidity.  The Sizzling Pepper Beef had some nice tender pieces of beef and some that were very chewy.  The salt was evident but the pepper less so.  Service was very spotty -- the appetizers took 20 minutes to come out, but the main courses were right on their heels.  It was friendly, however.  Bottom line: this is just a neighborhood Chinese restaurant, not terrible but not particularly good either."}
{"text":"Too bad, this place is so close to where I live. We ordered carry out. It was expensive, portions were small for the price. Tasted decent, but VERY bland. Hours later my boyfriend and I are sick. Upset stomachs all night, it was pretty awful. Not worth it for bland food that makes you sick. At least make it flavorful! lol But yeah, please just don't pay a lot of money to get sick."}
{"text":"Food was good: citrus chicken & chicken chow mein both had good flavor n fresh.  From kitchen straight to dinner table nice fresh n hot no time to get cool.  Servers were friendly and kind."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. Stopped in to try George and sons tonight, as we have heard so many great reviews. We were rudely greeted saying \"we close in 20 minutes, can you order take out\"? I am sorry but you said you are open for 20 more minutes. I've been in the restaurant industry for years and I would never say that to a paying guest in the restaurant. Terrible customer service!!"}
{"text":"Seriously a hidden gem... get the lunch special - such a good bang for the buck and plenty for two meals!  The House Special Yang (?) Chicken - so yummtastic!"}
{"text":"Amazing. The service can be a tad slow but it is so worth the wait. Order a glass of wine and go through some appetizers.   We ordered the potstickers and crab puffs and they were really tasty and a nice intro to the meal. The citrus chicken and garlic scallops were unreal. Great flavor and texture- obvious that the food is fresh.  George chatted with is as we sat at the bar and gave us other recommendations for restaurants. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"First time here...but will DEFINITELY be back.  Not too busy (but we were pretty early..5pm) Very quick and attentive service. Full bar, which was nice. Ordered New York style egg rolls, sesame chicken, house chow mein, combo fried rice, and egg foo yung. All of it was AMAZING. Seriously..the freshest, tastiest Chinese food I've had in a long time. This is now the \"go to\" for delicious Chinese in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Ok, I've been her twice. Both times, the food was really good. My favorite food is Chinese, and I'm EXTREMY critical. On both of my visits, I was very impressed. I got Tom Yum Thai soup to start. OMG! The best Asian soup, that I've ever had! I was sad, when my cup was empty. I'm craving it right now! (Be aware, that it is spicy). Their fried rice is the best I've had in The Valley. We also ordered Miona's chicken. AMAZING! not too spicy, or overly sweet. Perfect! Nice modern decor. Great service as well. They \"tag team\" tables! It's like you have 3 servers waiting on you. I love this place! 12 years since I moved here, & I finally found my go to Chinese Joint in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Great as always... Pad tai and combination fried rice my favorite. Basil chicken not a fan but it's just my preference . Ordered via phone for pickup ..."}
{"text":"Finding a good Chinese restaurant is hard to do, but George and Son's is perfect.  They have great food, great service, friendly staff, etc.  If you are going for lunch, they have a buffet where you can try everything they have.  If you are going for dinner, they have a wonderful sitdown atmosphere.  Most of the time, I get my food to go.  Their egg drop soup is great and is garnished with fresh spinich leaves.  Their crab rangoon has real crab in it.  Their house fried rice is filled with meat.  The Chef's Special Noodles is really good.  It has very thin noodles with meats and veggies in it.  The spicy pork is good.  I have not had anything there that I don't like.  You will be very happy going there."}
{"text":"Soooo glad I found this place! It's hard to find good Chinese food in North Phoenix, and this place is fantastic. Delicious food and excellent service. My personal favorites are the pot stickers, orange chicken, moo shu pork, and chow mein."}
{"text":"I love their Thai Spicy Basil, moved to Scottsdale nine years ago and this was my first and favorite Chinese restaurant in the area with consistent food and service! Still is!"}
{"text":"If you enjoy great Chinese food with some ambient Neil diamond in the background for music , this is your place!  Happened upon This gem in Norte Phx a bit ago .  Not far from the house so we drove over to give it a whirl .  The egg rolls were incredible, like they were made right at that moment, crispy hot and a savory dipping sauce fit for a queen and king !  Orange chicken was better than any I've ever had , and the kids meal was a great surprise! Staff was friendly and punctual . Will definitely come back in the future"}
{"text":"Good food. Please note they do not honor their 15% off coupon. We ended up here from our several choices with this in mind."}
{"text":"Received a flyer in the mail yesterday and, after reading the reviews for both locations, decided to give them a try for dinner.  I went in about 8:30 and I was surprised to find the restaurant empty. That could have been due to the fact it was the middle of the week and only an hour prior to closing. The decor was rather dark, but appeared to be nice. Quite truthfully, I did not take the opportunity to scrutinize it since I was not planning on eating in.  I was immediately assisted by a young girl who was friendly and quite helpful. I decided to order my old standby - Mongolian Beef. This is my go-to dish and I have probably have had it at every Chinese restaurant within a five mile radius from my home. And, no, they are certainly not all the same. With the closure of Pick Up Stix, I have been severely disappointed in the lack of choices. And, yes, I am aware that Pick Up Stix is not \"real\" Chinese, but my family did enjoy many of the dishes they offered and it was rather affordable for a family in comparison to PF Chang or even Pei Wei.  I received my order in about five minutes. It smelled delish and I could not wait to get home to try it.  First things first, I was blown away how tender the meat was. A melt-in-your-mouth tender. I was impressed. I had asked for \"extra\" brown sauce with mine as I love how it mixes with the rice. I was not disappointed. Lots of juicy brown sauce. To note, unlike other restaurants that typically make their Mongolian Beef spicy, this was not though I am sure they would accommodate upon request. It was flavorful and it had almost a subtle sweetness to it. Honestly, I am having difficulty putting it into words, but suffice it to say I practically licked my bowl clean!   At almost $12 for the Mongolian Beef dinner the price is a bit higher than other local Chinese restaurants, but I think I can overlook that based on the cut and tenderness of the meat alone. Plus I was able to get several meals out the serving.  I will most certainly be returning. In fact, I am practically drooling as I sit here typing.   Four stars from me. Why not five? Well, we can all strive to better. Though my experience was a positive one, I am hoping it is not just a honeymoon phase. So more visits are in order... yum!"}
{"text":"What a terrible experience we had on Christmas night.  The wait for a table was expected, but the food was a disaster.  Everything took too long to get and the order was messed up.  Everything, and I mean everything, came out cold.  Have you ever had a cold egg roll?  YUCK!!  The owner is very nice and so was our waitress, but they really didn't do anything about the cold food and assured us it was not recooked.  Who cares, it was still cold.  He did offer to remove the egg rolls from the bill but basically wouldn't redo them for us.  Told us it would take too long.  I think he just wanted to turn tables and that was his goal for the night.  $$$$  What a shame, because this place is usually quite good.  I think if you are going to open on Christmas Day, probably your busiest day of the year, then you better do it right or don't do it at all.  It was an unorganized mess of inadequate help.  I am sure he lost customers for being greedy, cuz I won't be back and I am sure I am not alone.  Check out Mike C's review.  Spot on."}
{"text":"The best Asian food we've found in the West Valley.  Their menu has much to offer: lunch selections, soups and salads, tasty appetizers, low carb dishes, seafood, beef, pork, chicken and vegetable plates. Some of our favorites include Sizzling Pepper Beef, Firecracker Spicy Pork and Sun Devil Chicken.  They also have a full bar with a variety of nice choices of wine, beer and cocktails. Owner Miona and the wait staff are friendly and aim to please. If you're a regular guest, they treat you like family."}
{"text":"Today was my first time coming here.  My husband had to work today and I met up with him here for his lunch since it was nearby his office.  Their lunch specials are really a great value.  They bring out this salad consisting of shredded lettuce with a mildly spicy vinaigrette dressing to start with.  I thought it was fine, something to munch on while your waiting.  Husband didn't like it though.  I ordered the orange beef and husband had the teriyaki chicken.  The orange beef that I had here was one of the best I've ever had.  Its crispy like a good orange beef should be and the sauce was tangy and not spicy at all, even though the menu indicated that it was.  I was hoping it wasn't spicy and was so glad that it wasn't. The teriyaki chicken was like any other that you can find at any asian place.  It was still very good but nothing out of the ordinary.  We had a bad luck of the draw and our order ended up being behind a large party that was there first so service was a little slow.  My husband had to leave early and had me pack up his leftovers to take home because he was running out of time due to the slow service.  I don't know if I can recommend this place with a limited lunch time for work.  If you're just leaving the theatre and have some time for a meal, definitely stop by here and check it out.    I would love to come back and try their dinner or even stop by for lunch again."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place and was highly disappointed. Their basil chicken was super bland. The noodle nest was another disaster. It was chewy and unpalatable. I don't think I will ever be going back to them for thai."}
{"text":"Absolutley one of the greatest secrets of all the Asian buffets in The Valley....Try to stock whenever I'm in the area of either location"}
{"text":"Wow, this place takes first place in Chinese food in North Scottsdale... the food is great."}
{"text":"George and Sons has become our favorite local Chinese restaurant. The food is always fresh and tasty. We like it more than Jade Palace. They add just the right amount of spicy to really bring out the flavors."}
{"text":"This restaurant was thoroughly enjoyable from the moment that we walked in to the farewells as we walked out.  The atmosphere was pleasant. The space was sparkling clean. The food was delicious, abundant, and fast.  The service was attentive and professional. Our server was Joyce and she was awesome! Her attention to my need for gluten free food was above and beyond what I expected. The menu is very versatile, giving the gluten free diner many options. I would recommend this restaurant to anybody!"}
{"text":"Went here for my daughters high school graduation with a party of 11. Atmosphere worked great for a graduation. Not stuffy or too laid back. We ordered in waves knowing what we wanted would also come in different spurts. The food was great and came out fast !! Nice large portions that everyone loved. For 11 people the total came to about $200 which is great too. I'd recommend everyone go and try. And leave another yelp review for others. We almost went to PF Chang's in the same shopping center but their reviews of management were terrible. Support local businesses !!!"}
{"text":"The original George & Son's; oh I love you so much.  I can remember the first time my (now husband) took me on a date here. I even remember thinking to myself... If this guy ever breaks up with me I'm going to come back and eat here all the time. The food is THAT GOOD.  Over 4 years later and we even had our rehearsal dinner for our wedding here.  My entire family dines here, and we refuse to go anywhere else for Asian/Chinese food.   I have tried numerous things on the menu and am never disappointed.  There is a scallop appetizer that will blow your mind. Seriously, so yummy.   All the entrees are a decent portion size. Honestly, I always tell myself that I will take half of it home, but I can never stop myself from eating everything in front of me.   The service is always kind and attentive. For the prices and quality/quantity of the food you will not find anything better!"}
{"text":"My husband and I live on 55th avenue and Happy Valley. We used to drive all the way to the location on Via Linda just to eat here. I'm so excited they opened the new location in Deer Valley.  We frequently eat here and the food never disappoints. The prices are great for the quality and quantity of food. The calamari appetizer is one of our favorites.  We won't eat anywhere else when it comes to Asian food. We are definitely lifelong customers."}
{"text":"George runs a good ship!  The food is good, all the time and that's important to us.  Saturday night music was pleasant and didn't drown you out...we could still converse.  Guess why it's our go to Asian spot, even tho we drive 30 minutes for it."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic! It had both authentic Chinese and Thai recipes to choose from. The food was made fresh to order with unprocessed ingredients. Our service was just as top notch as everything else. This will be our new date night spot!"}
{"text":"I just finished my G & S meal that I ordered to-go; actually, I just finished throwing it out. It was HORRIBLE. And by horrible, I mean shamefully bad. And by shamefully bad, I mean, heinous! I had a very disappointing experience here about a year ago but I thought I would give it another try. I should have proceeded with caution when I asked the long-term employees at the neighboring Blockbuster what was good and to the person, they all stammered and failed to reply. Seriously, zero out of four could give me one \"great\" dish! I've lived in both Mpls & Chicago and my Ex used to travel the Orient and we were always surprised at how POOR the quality of Asian food was in this area and WHY the people here, seemed to like it!? It's absolutely baffling! I had the Orange Beef & Spring Rolls. The Orange Beef looked scarey right in the container. But when i ate it - UGH! The texture was all off and the sauce..... it had these big, clear, GELATINOUS, ..... ugh ugh ugh! I can't even talk about it. Like biting into a ball of corn-starchy orange extract! I'm still sick from those few bites! [Truly.] And while I ordered vegetable spring rolls, I got what tasted like low-quality hamburger meat! In fact I finally identified the flavor and texture as: SAUSAGE! It was like an Asian Spring Roll with chunks of Italian Sausage inside!! How's that for a combo? Ugh...... [stomach turning] I'm sorry, I'm a Single Parent and I'm usually grateful to have someone cook for me. Grateful even when i am paying. But during \"tough times\" when i actually \"treat\" myself and then plunk down $20(!!) for unedible... yuck - it's totally, TOTALLY unacceptable!  Shame on you, George, for offering such little quality control and not aspiring to a higher standard overall. No wonder the place was (not) hopping on a Saturday night! Simply one of the worst meals EVER."}
{"text":"We ordered Generals Chicken and Generals Shrimp as main entree and the spring rolls & crab puffs for appetizers; all of it was delicious. It was great to find yummy Asian fusion so close to home; it's been difficult to find. The atmosphere is simple but comfortable- nothing fancy; it's located in the Deer Valley Town Center. Will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"We saw a new restaurant at Deer Valley Shopping Center.  We tried the lunch special and loved it. Good food, generous portions, nice atmosphere and reasonably priced. They were quick, friendly and attentive. We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"I like this place! Unfortunately, the flavor of the dishes varies depending on who is cooking, but it is usually good regardless. I just wish there were more consistency. On a Friday or Saturday night we sometimes have to wait 30+ minutes to receive our food, but that only happens when they are really busy.  During one of our visits a lady came around and asked us how our food tasted, and we told her it was good. Her replay was, \"Just good? Not excellent?\" Ummm....awkward. Regardless, we like the food!"}
{"text":"Yummy! The calamari is the best I've ever had. The fried rice, champ.  I highly recommend the baby bok choy and mushroom dish as well.  The hostess was friendly and professional, even though a very rude guest was being horrible. Kudos to her!"}
{"text":"The best Chinese food hands down in the Phoenix area. I have missed my favorite Chinese restaurants in Los Angeles after to moving to the Phoenix area until I found George and Sons. All the food is 5 stars."}
{"text":"They're directly across from giant office buildings from which large groups of lunchseekers emanate. Is \"lunchseekers\" a word? I guess it is now.  Anyway, our group of 10 was seated quickly, then not much happened. Then we got beverages. My friend got a glass of water all over his shirt. The server accidentally dropped it on him. The glass shattered on the floor. It was ok: accidents happen and it was a hot day anyway. The wet polo shirt provided a cooling effect.   So, we waited a while longer. Too long, really. Food started coming out from the kitchen. The servers didn't know who ordered what. It's ok. It happens. Really.  It was standard Chinese lunch fare. Nothing really good or bad. It's ok. It happens. Really.  Started to notice people at other tables waiting for food or drinks or checks. It's ok. It happens. Really.  They gave us the wrong check at the end. It's ok. It happens. Really.  We waited about 15 minutes for a revised check to appear. It's ok. It happens. Really.  Our lunch hour turned into a lunch hour and a half. It's ok. It happens. Really.  And to be honest, I told the hostess that my friend with the wet shirt shouldn't be asked to pay for his lunch, and she agreed he didn't. The manager might have been upset about this, but. . . It's ok. It happens. Really."}
{"text":"Wow! This is one of the best Chinese food places in all of Scottsdale. I have always loved Flo's (on Frank Lloyd Wright), but this might have trumped it. The \"house special salad\" is freaking incredible, the shrimp spring rolls are packed full of shrimp, the egg drop soup is the best I've ever had (loaded with veggies), and the shrimp fried rice is as good as Flo's. The couple across from us was having Kung Pao beef and string beans, I will be having that next visit. George himself thanked us for coming.  This is a must try if you live in Scottsdale - they also deliver!"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout as this place is in the neighborhood.  Ordered house chow fun and the hot and sour soup.  The soup was AMAZING!!  Best I've ever had.  In the future I will go back and just have the soup.  It was full of flavor, and had shrimp in in.  I've never had hot and sour soup with shrimp, but let me say, I loved it!  The house chow fun was a different story . It had mostly chicken in it with mixed vegetables, but the chicken was rubbery and fatty.  Very gross!!!  The noodles were all clumped together and some of them were crunchy.  There was some sort of spice in the sauce that was very offputting as well.  If I had not ordered the soup, I'd never eat there again.   Maybe next time I'll try a shrimp dish, that's harder to mess up!  The portion was very large.  Enough to share with another person and have left overs!"}
{"text":"I went for their lunch buffet and was expecting a buffet. It was a few dishes and the honey chicken turned my mouth into a glue trap. Haven't been back since."}
{"text":"Wow!!  I had had George and Son's food before and always loved it but I had never eaten in. I just did today for Father's Day and their service amazed me. They are absolutely perfect!!!! You don't see that often now a days and I thought 'I need to write a review'. Everything was brought out quick and so fresh and my cup was never empty.  WONDERFUL service, and great great food like always!!! Totally recommend!"}
{"text":"This is a gem of a local restaurant in a sea of chains. Don't be misled by its mall like location.  The food is fantastic and has unique versions of dishes with great ingredients."}
{"text":"The chicken chow mein was great.  The vegetables were a nice surprise.   My husband had the kung pao chicken and loved it.  The lunch combos were more than enough.  Clean and service was great."}
{"text":"Food was great, but literally the most uncomfortable experience. The day led to a late dinner. So we went in and asked if they'd take us (half hour before closing) they said yes, but proceeded to rush everything. The back staff started truckling out and sitting in the dining room. It was obvious they were waiting for us to leave. I felt bad so I made the decision, without finishing, to have them box what was left. As we stood up to leave the workers did too and they followed us out. Wow! I wish I had more time to enjoy their great food. Hope it tastes the same as a \"left over\"."}
{"text":"I came to dine here with my mother after having surgery. I was excited to eat real food. The Asian Vegetables were good. Monia's chicken was dry (even drenched in the sauce which has good flavor). I was never sure who our server was because everyone sort of goes to all the tables. Anyway, when we went to leave because I was uncomfortable I asked for a cup to put my iced tea in. They said they would have to charge me for another drink. Seriously? I asked another person and they then went and congregated together and would not bring us the cup. Absolutely ridiculous. We were basically just getting our food to go! So my mom made us stay sitting there and she drank 4 more glasses of the iced tea and kept flagging them down to ask for the refill. That pretty much made my day. I just think it's atrocious when a business chooses to dissatisfy customers over something so trivial. Absolutely ridiculous and poor service."}
{"text":"Great food! The Sweet & Pungent Pork (yes, that's what it's called!) was amazing! Chicken salad was top notch, too. Service was great and friendly. The atmosphere was very casual, with a neat looking bar and TVs to watch if you feel so inclined. The food was promptly delivered and we left happy. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I have dined in, and we have gotten take-out many times, and I think the food is good and the ambiance is casual. Everyone is very nice."}
{"text":"My update: I give this restaurant five stars only because I can't give it six stars.  The service is personable, quick, and fun. Professional, but never cold. I've been here more than thirty times, so I'm both biased and experienced in their service. Francis is an amazing server, and he's one of a crew that is terrific. (If it's your first time, asking for Francis is a pro tip. :) )  The kitchen is absolutely the best Chinese in Phoenix. From the egg rolls to the egg drop soup (which still deserves a paragraph all for itself) to the festival shrimp and the three seas special, Ive samples a dozen main dishes and never had a bad meal. Seriously, the egg drop soup is out of this world.   On Saturday there is a great band, so much so that you want a reservation to get a seat at 6 or 7. Totally worth it.   The owner is a riot. George is pleasant, generous and very charming, and you'll meet the guy who owns the restaurant if you're here near closing.   From soup to fortune cookie, this is the place for great Chinese.   Also, great wine and great Scotch. It's funny - the Scotch is great at the end of the night."}
{"text":"This is the best tasting Asian food you will ever taste George is a very gracious host, he really cares about his customers!!"}
{"text":"This has turned into one of my favorite takeout places. Great food and the price is also right.  I have dined in once  and the service was great but for those days when I am lazy and really do not want to cook, who do I call?!? George & Son :).    Everything I have had here is amazing with pretty good potion size.  My usual go to is the Tom Yum soup.  I have had Tom Yum from a few Thai restaurants but the great thing about George & Son's is they load it up with both chicken and shrimp.  While I love having both meats, since it is pre-cooked, I could see this being a problem for a person that would like to choose between the meats.   Overall, it does not matter if you dine in or do take out this place will not disappoint."}
{"text":"We heard the buffet was good so. We went for lunch on a Tuesday afternoon. No buffet any more on week days, only on weekends. We stayed for lunch and were not happy about this choice. The food was only fair as compared with others we like, such as Jade Palace.  Staff was friendly and helpful. However, we should have left before ordering."}
{"text":"The food was quite good, and they even had live music! I don't know how often that happens, but I was there on a Saturday around 7 pm. The music was lovely, and while on a break the singer even came around and took requests! While I was there, I heard Sinatra and 'Beyond the Sea' by Bobby Darin. Overall, it was a very positive dining experience."}
{"text":"The food is very very amazing like beef and fish. The environment is very romantic and intimate. The decoration is very careful. Uncle George is very friendly to each guest.  Recommendation? Black Pepper Beef, Special Fish (Tilapia), House Special Steak"}
{"text":"Your not going to find too many places for a better lunch experience for your $.  A comfortable mid-size open bar/restaurant.  Clean.  Service is fantastic - your ability to be in and out is quick which often is desired by us people that work (3-4 individuals are involved & their timing is almost amazing).  The meals have been of great variety and taste!  Definitely recommend.  The Firecracker is a bit hot for me, however the Generals Chicken I recommend for anyone.  The lunch special includes soup, crab puff, vegetable roll, lo mein, steamed rice and your entree - with chicken/beef and pork options at $7.95 list.

{"text":"I live right up the street from this place and go as often as I can. The food is always good and I have yet to really be disappointed with it. Delivery can be a little pricey ($4 charge) but definitely worth it if you don't feel like throwing pants on for dinner. Service has been nice, I haven't had the chance to check their lunch buffet or champagne brunch out , yet, but as soon as I do I will update this review to reflect the experience.  I recommend ordering the \"Special Chicken\" really good!  My only issue with this place was the small amount of rice given when I ordered delivery, it was two full orders and we only received one box of rice to share, which is the same amount you get when you order one order."}
{"text":"OK, Bamboo grill or whatever is GONE... good riddens,, So, i tried this new place ,, ha hemm,, please upate your address on yelp,, it is kind of important,,,  Service A+  , was asked if everything was ok, and it was.. Salad, decent, Egg Roll made with the spring roll wrapper the thin ones like Lumpia... ok, not great,, add some meat...   Mongolion beef: decent flavors,, meat was very tender and decent cut of meat and very edible.. not the best, but better than average,,  I will be back..."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch buffet once. The buffet is not worth it. Theres so little food in their buffet it doesn't deserve to be called a buffet. Its tastes okay, but go elsewhere if your looking for a real chinese buffet."}
{"text":"The service was great and the food was delicious! Definitely coming back here. Perfect place for dinner/lunch before a movie."}
{"text":"Thanks once again to ASBA's Leslie Barrett for recommending another excellent restaurant in the Valley. George & Son's doesn't sound like much, but it is. It's the best Chinese inspired restaurant we've been to in the Phoenix Metro area so far. The vegetable dishes, fried rice and especially the Kung Pao 3 Seas - with shrimp, scallops and the most wonderful white fish - were all excellent. The Tom Yum Gum Thai soup was light on lemon grass but strong on Thai basil and so was a thumbs up, too. We enjoyed the friendly service. The only disappointment was the sizzling calamari, which had a little too much fried batter but did have an excellent use of onions and peppers on the dish, and the Singapore Sling that was too sweet for our taste. We've been to the Raffles Hotel in Singapore and so we're a bit spoiled there. Don't let that stop you - sail away to George & Son's and enjoy great Chinese and Asian food with a Tsingtao beer. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place has a great lunch buffets from 11 to 2.   I love that it's not a huge buffet that pumps out a bunch of trash, it's a smaller buffet with high quality food prepared in small batches. Definitely my favorite Chinese in the valley.  Don't forget about the bottomless mimosas on the weekends!  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Good food but not a lot of variety on the buffet. Service is A1 though, water was never more than half, was refilled promptly. Plates were taken out right away as well."}
{"text":"The food is ok--the service is horrendous. We have tried it 3 times wanting to like it, but can not get past the terrible service. Also the fact that there was hair in my dish and was still charged for it....not a good experience."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout from here for the first time. Not the friendliest people working the front desk. The Kung Pao Beef was some of the best I've ever had. The House Chow Mein was also very good. The Spicy Thai Basil Chicken was just okay. A lot higher priced than comparable Chinese food in the area. We didn't order appetizers because they were so expensive, and for a less amount of food than usual. I may go again for the Kung Pao Beef."}
{"text":"Every dish we have ordered has been delicious!  Best place in PHX hands down for Asian cuisine. I come from California where there are tons of great places and I had lost hope for AZ but I am definitely glad I found a place that is as amazing and affordable as this place!"}
{"text":"Consistently good food and service. High quality buffet items for lunch. Excellent value. Nothing really stands out as the quality and service are so consistent. We've been coming here for lunch and dinner for years but prefer the lunch buffet as it offers greater variety. Good vegetables, fried items such as crab rangoon and deep fried vegetables are fresh. The beef dish is very tasty and tender. Other items such as hot fish and sweet and sour pork, shrimp, and spicy chicken dishes are excellent. Potstickers... Yum! Hard not to go back again and again. Service is professional and charming. Some of the Staff have a wonderful sense of humor.  It seems this is our go-to restaurant when it comes to Chinese food. And we have three Chinese restaurants in Fountain Hills, but that's another story."}
{"text":"Delicious. Ordered take out, and it was ready before we even got there in about 20 minutes. Got the potstickers, which were amazing. Perfectly cooked and stuffed. I got the sesame chicken with white rice and the meat was juicy and the sauce was perfect! The vegetable chow mein was also perfect. Would definitely recommend, and I will be getting more."}
{"text":"Ridiculously good! Did a take out order and it was done within 15 minutes. The lunch specials are inexpensive for a great amount of food!"}
{"text":"Excellent music, good cocktails, really good food AND best of all they projected the snowbirds and increased staff so service was awesome!!!  Refreshing"}
{"text":"This is my second visit in 2 weeks. Both times I have eaten the lunch buffet and it was outstanding!! I will have to come in and eat dinner before I give it 5 stars! But so far the place is a must eat!"}
{"text":"Great service and great food. They have lunch specials everyday of the week. Portions are big. I had the tai curry chicken, it was marked spicy but wasn't very spicy at all, was delicious!"}
{"text":"Stopped in today to try it again and our favorite staff was in, Elsie and Alice.  The food was delicious.  So excited  to enjoy George and Sons again, have really missed it."}
{"text":"I love this place! I am not usually a fan of Asian food, but George and Sons is amazing. The food always comes out super quick, hot, and so tasty! This is a must."}
{"text":"I come here for lunch sometimes as my wife doesn't care for there egg rolls. That's a deal breaker for her. But I love this place. The lunch specials are perfect portions and affordable. I've tried several different dishes and you can't go wrong with any of them. However the general Yangs Shrimp is amazing. So delicious. Egg drop soup is bomb as well. My only gripe is the drink selection. I like regular ice tea and they have some sort of green tea. That's the reason for 4 stars. Others wise it would of been a 5. Go here. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"If you're looking for understated Chinese food without the lowest-common-denominator food of a corporate chain, George & Sons is where it's at in Scottsdale. Pretty much everything they offer is great, and their pot stickers and chicken friend rice are our \"Must Order\" list whenever we go. They consistently offer either an online coupon or Yelp check-in deal, so be sure to come prepared. Be sure to get to know George--yes, that George--because he's a hoot."}
{"text":"I have had my eye on George & Son's for years and finally made it for dinner.  The ratings are legit, folks!  Pleasant, professional and prompt (see that - is it alliteration??) service.  We shared pot stickers with a delightful sauce; fresh flavors.  My wife had seafood in a bird's nest (under the specials) and I had the old-boring-white man Mongolian Beef. For me, the critical test is taste and crispness of the veggies; they hit the mark there.  Tender beef with great flavor.  Very pleased and well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Good food been coming years. Very good service and food was terrific. A good go to spot for chinese food. The atmosphere is upscale as well."}
{"text":"Best buffet I ever ate at, small but consistent and always made fresh. Best time to eat here is for lunch anytime of the week."}
{"text":"The food was great and they provided me excellent service. A side note is that i had the mionas special chicken and general yan chicken. Super tasty and price is right for the lunch combo."}
{"text":"Pretty standard Chinese food... Nothing really stood out to me.  I would try it again though."}
{"text":"I came here with a large party and must say I was a little underwhelmed. Their menu is large with all of the usual Americanized Chinese food options. We ordered way too much food for the 6 of us: potstickers, spring rolls, wonton soup, NY style eggrolls, chow fun, pad thai, shrimp in lobster sauce, orange chicken, and sesame chicken. The dishes were fairly expensive - around 13$ a plate, but the portion sizes were quite large. Unfortunately, the food wasn't that great... the pad thai was overly limey.... not great at all (I guess we should have known better than to order a Thai dish at a Chinese restaurant). The chow fun was decent, but nothing special. The chicken dishes were those puffy fried chicken balls.... you know, overly breaded chunks of chicken.... not sure why restaurants do this instead of just frying a chicken breast and putting sauce on top. Anyway, the potstickers were alright and the NY eggrolls were oddly tasty (like peanut butter?). The wonton soup was good, a classic wonton with little green onions.  Anyway, I probably wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again, but if you're in a pinch, this isn't the worst place you could eat."}
{"text":"Dined here last night for the first time because of the high reviews on Yelp. We were not disappointed.  Mongolian beef was quality,  juicy,  thick sliced beef cooked perfectly in a savory sauce.  Generals Chicken was likewise, thick,  juicy pieces of chicken breast cooked perfectly in a wonderfully spicy sauce.  Both dishes prepared with quality veggies.  The House Chow Fun was also superb. It was very busy at 7:30 on a Tuesday night,  another good sign of the quality.  Service was very good although just a bit rushed,  probably due to the crowd.  High quality food at prices comparable to lower quality take out.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed going for lunch at this restaurant several times - what I like about it it's a healthier choice for a good lunch service is fast and quick so I can get back to work so I did"}
{"text":"We ordered takeout and the food was simply terrible. It was extremely bland and had no flavor. Maybe the worst Asian food I've ever had. No spice or dimension at all. We had the Mongolian beef, thai curry chicken, lo Mein, shrimp fried rice and egg rolls. It was so bad that we ended up throwing it out. So sad that $70 worth of food went to waste. Obviously Won't be back."}
{"text":"Worked across street and had to eat here st least once week. Now I take fam here. Price is rt and food is good quality and made well. Would rec to anyone who enjoys good chinese."}
{"text":"So it was our second visit and perhaps I had high expectation based on first visit.  But I was a bit disappointed with the food - it was not great but about average.  Perhaps it was because we ordered vegetarian.  Typically Pad Thai has peanut sprinkled on the top with a slice of lemon on the side but this one had everything mixed together so wasnt too impressed with its presentation either. Taste was alright nothing great.  Perhaps I need to go one more time to decide."}
{"text":"My family and I really like this place.  The food is very good, pricing is very reasonable. Way to go George. Nice job welcoming us to your restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food. Really great lunch special. The service is usually fast and good but have gone a few times when they are very busy and service slows down, understandable. Dinner is a bit pricey for what it is but still very good quality. Prefer this over all the typical Chinese places around."}
{"text":"They are so rude the customer service is terrible.  I called to place order she disconnected right away.  I called back to confirm she said she didn't have time to repeat herself"}
{"text":"The inside is smaller than I expected, but very nicely decorated. Great ambiance.  Went on Sunday afternoon and the place was not super busy. We were seated immediately.  Our drink order was promptly taken and we did not have to wait very long, which was good because I'm a thirsty feller.  We looked at the menu for a minute and ordered. We ordered crab puffs to share I ordered a thom yum soup and chicken curry lunch special. The lady ordered the citrus chicken lunch special.  I was really hungry, and hoped to get the crab puffs and soup right away, and we did. The lunch specials came pretty much immediately after.  The crab puffs were on point. Full of yummy filling. The soup was pretty good. I've never had thom yum it with tomatoes in it, and their addition steered the flavor toward familiar american style soup waters. I'm more in favor of the no tomato version though I would order it again. The chicken in the soup was tender and delicious and there was a full scrimp up in there too!  The lunch specials were full of food! They had a little spring or egg roll (I don't know which is which), a crab puff, white rice,  noodles, and the main dish. I liked my chicken curry main dish. My girlfriend didn't like the citrus chicken. She told me that \"it tastes like Mountain Dew chicken\". From wherever she ate it before, She expected it to be light, but it was in a heavy \"lemon syrup\" I tasted it, and my opinion was that it tasted like the lemon pie filling from those little dollar pies you get from the convenience store.  While my review may sound negative, I do want readers to know that I would absolutely go back in a heartbeat. I'm pretty sure George was there telling another table a story about when he started the restaurant, and I can appreciate and support what he's doing. The amount of food we got was a great value, and my GF even said she'd come back with me. The service and value was top notch, and lm looking forward to learning what dishes are my favorite."}
{"text":"Pretty decent lunch spot with some good vegetarian options. The thing that makes me laugh is that they have their Mapo tofu listed under the vegetable section on their menu and it has pork in it. What plant does pork grow on? Haha.   I recommend the spicy eggplant...as a lunch special if it's around that time because you also get a little side of lo mein, a spring roll, and a cream cheese wonton. The spicy eggplant isn't too spicy but it has a nice flavor to it.   Vegans should be careful when eating here though. I wasn't feeling well one day and I ordered the vegetable and tofu soup and was told that it was made with vegetable broth. It definitely was chicken broth and I couldn't eat it. Also, there might be egg in their lo mein noodles and in the spring roll...and there's definitely dairy in the cream cheese wonton. I'm not sure what's in the sauce used for the spicy eggplant...and no one at the restaurant seems to know either. Just be careful when dining here if you have dietary needs."}
{"text":"Gross, cheap ingredients. No flavor. Sesame chicken was dry chicken with soy sauce and sesame seeds. Tasted like minute rice. Smelled like dog food."}
{"text":"Seriously, it's that good. The food was delicious, the staff was attentive and friendly. For the price you can't beat it.   I will return as often as possible!"}
{"text":"Nice food and service but takes lot of time to bring the order. Hard to understand their English."}
{"text":"All I have to say is get the pecan/ walnut shrimp. It is amazing. We had noodles, spicy chicken, and tilapia. Those items were ok. But the shrimp. Yes, please give me more. Mr. George is very nice and funny. He makes the experience so much more satisfying."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent. I don't know what spices and techniques they use to make it but it always tastes great. George and Sons has all the staple foods of a Chinese place in America but I feel it's always a step up from what other places serve.   Be mindful of possible wait times during the rushes. The clientele is older and can be a bit impatient... But it's worth it."}
{"text":"Great little place! I ordered the Veggie and Egg fried rice which was excellent! The potstickers to start were also great! We also ordered the Miona's Chicken I think it is called and the flavor was great but was too breaded for me. All in all it was great and our server, was excellent! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Im not sure about the bad reviews but the service and food that we received was very good, the servers were very helpful with ordering and the questions we had. My wife orderd the tres amigos and I had the vegetable chow main. We shared the meals and it was very good. The meat was tender and the vegies wer perfectly cooked and still had  crispness to them. The servers were at our table often and the dinner was served within 10 minutes. So I am very suprised at the couple of bad reviews using \"horrified and absolute worst\"?not even close that discription for my experience. I truely hope that yours will be the same !"}
{"text":"Been here many times...always good food. Bold flavors. Favorites include hot and sour soup, lettuce wraps, pot stickers, kung pao, Mongolian beef, Miona shrimp (Miona is Mrs. George), and pork chow mein. Nice size portions and good lunch specials as well. I find other Chinese places not as tasty."}
{"text":"Had a great meal sitting at the bar. Very homey, antithesis of a chain.  They made a dish to suit my dietary needs no problem, plus fixed a nice manhattan. Hard to ask for more.  This area seems to have few good dining options, so definitively would recommend giving this one a try."}
{"text":"Four stars for the lunch-time buffet.  My team at lunch likes to eat here for lunch sometimes and I have to say it's pretty great for lunch.  The buffet is much smaller than your typical Chinese buffet place, but everything in it is much higher quality.  The dish with the fried fish is super-duper great.  G&S has better-than-average atmosphere for a Chinese restaurant and their wait staff is attentive and fun.  George himself is often there as well.  My family has eaten here a few times for dinner as well.  I can't give G&S 4 stars for dinner, but I'd definetly give it 3.5 if I could.  The portions are pretty big, the food is tasty, and the menu has a lot of stuff in it.  I'm not sure how authentic G&S is, but I think it's one of the best places for Chinese lunch buffet in this part of Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I frequent their Phoenix location, and I love their food. Today, I was in the area of their scottsdale location so I thought I give them another try. I had takeouts here once and found the food at their Phoenix location little better.  Today we ordered our usual beef chow fun and Tres Amigos. It was good but was little on the salty side. Also tried their seafood pocket appetizer. It was nice and crunchy on the outside and moist in the middle with ton of shrimp and scallops. It wasn't what I expected but it was tasty.  Overall, I still prefer their Phoenix location. The staff was attentive and the restaurant had very nice and clean atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for few years now and finally decided to write my review. The food is always consistent and portion sizes are huge especially lunch dishes. Today, we had dinner there and ordered Tres Amigos, crunchy tofu, calamari appetizer, and pad Thai (Chinese style). All were very tasty. $50 bill for three adults, but enough leftover for another 3. They have another location in Scottsdale, but I prefer this location. Food taste better here for some reason. The staff is attentive and service is fast even when they are full house. I can't think of anything that would improve this restaurant, so full 5 stars from me."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for 15 plus years. Always had a good experience with service and great food. In all this time between all my friends and family we have spent many thousands of dollars at his restaurant. Came in a week or so ago and we had about a $45 bill. Yelp offers a 15% coupon when you check in. And he got very rude with me about not accepting the coupon. And I told him I couldn't believe after all the years of patronage he wouldn't take off $7. George take care of people that have been coming to you for this many years. If anything you should have bought us dinner. Shame on you."}
{"text":"We were greeted in a friendly manner and promptly seated. Water and menus immediately---went downhill in a hurry.  Waited twenty minutes for the appetizers---my husband's arrived, but mine did not. Waited more-- complained-- was offered a glass of wine. I don't want to be placated with alcohol and excuses about the kitchen. I would like service. My appetizer finally  arrived. Waited another twenty minutes for dinner-- same thing. His arrived; mine wasn't served for another ten minutes. Cold and mediocre.  THEN we were charged for a bottle of wine when  the only beverage ordered was one glass of wine.  Who needs this with so many good Chinese restaurants in Scottsdale?????? Never again!"}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese we have found in this area. The lunch buffet has different choices ~ not the same every day but always good. The tempura is not over breaded and always crisp ~ a sure sign the food will be good."}
{"text":"I don't write reviews but my excellent experience inspired me to this time. Friendliest staff ever. Great food, good prices. Restaurant interior is very well done,  doesn't feel cheap but doesn't feel too fancy either. I was extremely comfortable the entire time due to ambiance and hospitality. The food was much higher quality than average Chinese. Blown away"}
{"text":"Took my sister and husband who were visiting from Illinois.   We ordered our meals and pork fried rice.  The rice came out before our meals, which I do not understand.  We did not want to eat cold rice waiting for our entrees, so we ate it while warm.  We wanted the rice to come out with our entrees.  Also, they forgot our egg roll order.  Everything was out of sync.  And, too expensive.  I thought we finally found a great Asian restaurant, but we were wrong.  So disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Scottsdale but the service is pretty slow/inattentive and the ambiance is bland. The kung pao chicken is fab. It comes without peanuts but you can ask for them to be added. Fried rice with meat is good but the vegetable fried rice tasted like plain rice to which they added veggies at last minute. My daughter loves the chow mein, which comes with tons of sautéed veggies. Flavor is the reason to come here!"}
{"text":"Not your typical Asian restaurant indeed!  I don't yelp.  In fact, I had to sign up just to write this review.  That's how good this food is.  Like Teri Hatcher in Seinfeld, this food is real.  And it's spectacular!  If you're reading this review, that means you're not currently eating George's Fish Pocket, which means you are mismanaging your time.  You really should be eating George's Fish Pocket.  It's that good.  I haven't been this excited about a culinary creation since I had Miona's Special Chicken.  Also to die for: General Yang's Chicken.  The wait staff is incredibly attentive and warm.  We even got to chat with Miona (of Special Chicken fame) herself!  She was awesome.  Sadly, General Yang was unavailable.  Full disclosure:  The main reason I am writing this review is that I don't want to lose my new favorite restaurant.  My girlfriend and I went recently for the second time.  When I suggested we go to \"that Chinese place by Deer Valley 30,\" she squealed in delight, and I knew I had earned bonus points.    I called in advance, but reservations were not needed.  Shockingly, the restaurant was nearly empty on a Saturday night.  As I looked around at the beautiful decor and read the innovative menu, a chill ran down my spine....The idea that people were filing into a Panda Express three doors down while I ate the best Orange Chicken I've ever had (made with ingredients of unquestionably superior quality and for a comparable price) rendered me momentarily heartbroken.  Then I had another bite and I was back to double-rainbow-level nirvana.  Don't let this place go away.  I fear it may be too good for this world, so don't miss out.  Put down your computer/phone/Google Glasses and run to George and Son's.  You owe it to your palette."}
{"text":"This place was just ok.  Service was not great but to be fair we had a large party so I am sure it is better with less people.  The servers were friendly just slow and we felt like we had to ask for everything, and even then we didn't always get it.    My husband and I shared the crab puffs appetizer, it just tasted like cream cheese.  We also shared the orange chicken, which was good but it need more flavor or spiciness(is that a word).    My kids shared beef chow mein (which was what I normally see as Lo Mein). They oved it and it did have good flavor and the beef was tender."}
{"text":"Love the Asian fusion menu.   Not the standard boring American style Chinese food that seems to be taking over the Valley.     Love the meat and vegetables for a low carb meal,  the Thai Basil chicken and a number of other items on the menu.  Service is attentive and the Owners always stop by and say hello.   If you want something different that the super buffets and Panda Express, give George's a try,  If you like the buffets and Panda Express, stay away :-)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!! The ambiance and staff are all wonderful! I got the miaona special chicken and it was delicious! They also had a live band that plays on Saturdays that were great!!"}
{"text":"Good people and good atmosphere. Great pricing and the food is amazing!! Been here 2x already and will continue to eat here."}
{"text":"My first yelp review ever!!!  Been here a few times for lunch and dinner. The food is phenomenal! I love the New York Style Egg Roll. It is packed with flavor. The Sizzling Soup comes with pork, shrimp, and chicken. There are lots of vegetables in it. I love to eat the sizzling rice. For entree, I normally get either the Shrimp with Honey Glazed Walnuts or the Kung Pao Chicken. If you want something sweet, definitely get the Shrimp with Honey Glazed Walnuts. The Kung Pao Chicken is the best Kung Pao Chicken I have ever had. George and Son's is the BEST CHINESE RESTAURANT in town. I will be coming back for more. Also, the service is out of this world. Servers are always happy and polite. I will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Food was ok. The service could have been better though.  I. Ordered take out and when i went to pick it up the restaurant was empty so i figured fast service, which it was until i asked for. A few cups of red pepper oil and the hostess came back with 1 small container of it 10 mins later and a bunch of other things i believe were plates. I felt as if i was burdening them . Maybe they were having a bad day."}
{"text":"Ordered take out on Christmas Day at around 430pm to avoid the rush. They told us we had to order from a pared down menu which was probably the first sign we should have passed and gone somewhere else.  I could understand having the limited menu during the rush, but there was none.  When we got to the restaurant there was one person in front of us. we waited over 15 minutes past the time our order was supposed to be ready.   We basically wasted about $100 on food that day. All of it had zero point zero taste. it's like they ran out of seasoning or something. plus every protein was over cooked!   I didn't even bother trying to get a refund because they probably would have offered store credit. Since we're never going back there's no point.   I really don't know how this place has an average rating of 4.   the only reason they get a 1 is because the food was packaged nicely."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Asian restaurants in Scottsdale. Food is always outstanding, servers are incredibly attentive. George creates a fun, welcoming environment for every guest."}
{"text":"My first time here, ordered the Orange chicken lunch special it was very delicious, it comes with rice, noodles, soup, spring roll and a puff. Great prices... Hot tea was delicious... Enjoyed everything! Service was fast and friendly I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the won ton soup, pot stickers and beef w/ broccoli.  Many places I have tried have been bland but this place was far from it!  I have been telling all my friends how awesome the food was!  I will definitely order from there again!"}
{"text":"No longer has weekday lunch buffet. Still a good restaurant, but the buffet is gone."}
{"text":"Ordered the Cantonese Style Chow Mein which had shrimp, beef, Chicken and onions. Was impressed by the crispy style panned fried noodles just like I wanted it.  Although my friends lunch plate looked very bland and what you would expect a white person to order he was happy..  People were super friendly and attentive, always filling our drinks and very positive."}
{"text":"If i could give negative starts i would. My husband and i first time there he went to go pick up the food and was immediately turned away because \"you look scruffy\" he explains that he is there to pick up an order and was told to \"hurry up and leave\". I orderd the 3 seas and everything was waaaay over cooked. And bland flavor. He orded the thi curry chicken extra spicy . He says it is bland and not spicy at all. I tried it and honestly a todler can eat that. So disappointed after all the rave reviews but for the price, horrible attitude, and inability to cook shimp i would not reccomend this place to my worst enemy. Dont waste your time or money."}
{"text":"I love Chinese food... I was not impressed with the food here on this visit. We ordered take out and had the Orange Chicken, House Egg Foo Young, Chicken Chow Mein, Pot Stickers and Crab Puffs.... The House Egg Foo Young am was very disappointing as the made Egg patties and then just through the Chicken, Beef and Shrimp on top.... Gravy was put on ahead of time sow the patties were mushy by the time we got them home.... They should know better than to prepare this item, this way... Orange chicken was decent... Pot Stickers were excellent!!! Crab puffs were just ok.... They are very stingy on the sauces too.... A $60 order should be offered a little more without question...."}
{"text":"Had our December 23rd Christmas dinner here. What a fun place with great food, band and ambience for this. All had a 10+ great time. Thank you Mr. George."}
