{"text":"My husband and I heard about Postino and went there for lunch.  The food was delicious and the customer service was fantastic!  We will definitely go back again!!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my experience at Postinos. Great vibe, great food. The service was a little spotty, but luckily wasn't in a rush! Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Fig and marscapone bruschetta is to die for. I crave it all the time! Vintage 95 in Chandler has attempted to copy Postino's recipe for success, but it doesn't compare to the service, atmosphere and quality that Postino is known for. Prices are completely fair, wine and beer selection is great. The Mixed Green salad was totally amazing. I drive 30 minutes from Gilbert to get there, and it is worth every minute. I can't wait for the Gilbert location to open! One of the best places in Phoenix, hands down."}
{"text":"Absolutely spectacular, as always. I only wish I had a bottomless tummy cuz I don't want to stop eating here. Ever. Keep it up guys !"}
{"text":"We recently spent some time in the Phoenix area and we started our time there at Postino's for brunch and didn't have anything as delicious the entire rest of the trip. We had the cheese board which was a good mix of cheese, nuts, dried fruits, and a selection of breads.  It was so much fun to try different combinations and everything we tried was delicious together.  We also ordered the bruschetta and it did not disappoint.  Our favorites were the Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone and Burrata, Bacon, Argula & Tomato.  Great atmosphere, great service and most importantly great food!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of this place.  Normally this place is packed, but its worth the wait.  The wine selection is great and the bruschetta is by far my most favorite thing on the food menu.  I am salivating just thinking about the bruschetta -- all different varieties for different pallettes.  mmm...  The paninis look delicious, too, but I haven't tried them yet b/c I always end up with the delicious bruschetta.  I normally have a hard time pairing it down to just four choices of bruschetta.  The vibe of this place is loungy and comfortable, which is nice.  And on a nice day, the doors/windows are open, so there is a very airy feeling to the place.  My only complaint is how small the tables are and how squooshed together everyone is.  But, if you are with a good crowd, you won't even notice."}
{"text":"We were visiting Phoenix last weekend for the Rock n Roll marathon, and a local took us to Postino's for pre-race dinner.  We weren't sure what to expect - we showed up early (around 6:45) on a Saturday, and the place was wide open - but we just beat the rush.  By 7:30, it was packed, but we were fine. 

Service was great, and with one Vegan and four cautious stomachs in the group, our only regret was that we couldn't eat more!  The salads are extraordinarily good, and the panini's were fresh and flavorful - the fresh cheeses are really, really good. 

We liked it so much, we went back on Monday before our flight left for Chicago.  Great atmosphere, good menu selections, good salads, and we only wish we had more time to drink...."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Owner and staff are great!! Food is amazing. PERFEKT is by far my favorite wine! Specials are worth the weight.  I cannot speak more highly of those places."}
{"text":"Excellent food, service, and vibe overall. Great wine list- but you have to get the boards! Try Sundays with live music and weekly specials."}
{"text":"I must be honest, I am not much of a wine guy, but I came here with friends last week and had a pretty good time. The sandwich I had was huge - really big. The waitress kept bringing more and more food in quick time, and the wine wasn't too bad either. I'll be back."}
{"text":"OMG!!! This place is A.MAZ.ING! If you dont get the bruchetta appetizer than you will be missing out. SO tasty!"}
{"text":"Fantastic patio, fantastic bruchetta, italian picnic salad is great.  I could eat here every day.

My only complaint is happy hour ends at 5pm."}
{"text":"Parking is an issue so you will need to valet.  Great soup, sandwiches and bruchetta

Love this wine bar.  Date night or girlfriend place. 

This is a city treasure"}
{"text":"Favorite wine bar I've seen in my life so far. The happy hour is fantastic any day ($5 glasses of wine?! can't beat that) Postinos is probably the main reason we didn't want to move away from Phoenix. It's a great date place with a great atmosphere. It can get quite crowded so, go early. But even if you have to wait, I still think it's worth it. There is no bad seat in the house. Parking can be annoying, but they do have valet. We usually parked on a side street near by (but be careful, some of the side streets you can't park on). Both locations are just as good. Bring one to Chicago please! I miss this place and will definitely be back every time I come back to visit!"}
{"text":"First time here and very impressed! My wife and I brought my parents here and we loved it!  The bruschetta board is the way to go with big servings of each.  We had the red peppers and goat cheese, apple brie and dates, classic bruschetta, and the smoked salmon. All were delicious!  The atmosphere is pretty trendy, and you have to valet your car cause there is no parking around the area.  To be honest its a little hard to have conversations in there as the music was pretty loud.  I could see how they would have that cause it seemed geared more to a younger crowd.  That was the only drawback.  I also had one of their Panini's, the Nine Iron.  It was good but could of done with out so much lettuce and had more meat.  Overall a great experience and coming back again to enjoy the bruschetta board."}
{"text":"Definitely a great stop especially at lunch to snag a multitude of $5 wines by the glass. Fill up on some create your own bruschetta like Tuscan white bean with proscuttio while knocking back Crazy Aunt Edna's favorite rose'.  I prefer the lounge chairs to the high top tables the same way Chuck Taylor lo tops are way cooler than some scuffed up Uggs.  Kick back and enjoy the quick, attentive and rather attractive service. Of course, look out for wine snobs,haters,cougars, and wanna be hipsters that will harsh your giggly wine buzz. Better ride your skateboard though, parking's tight and time-consuming."}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant. Literally I have to go here atleast once a week. Atleast. I do sometimes come here every other day. Their bruschetta is the bomb and my all time fave mixed green salad. Chicken mozzarella if i want a heavier meal. Different kinds of good wine. I personally love their exclusive Malbec which is Espiritu. Try it guys you won't regret :)"}
{"text":"Great new brunch menu! Thank you for the email for the free entree.  I will return!!"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place to go. Great ambiance and wine selection. Ideal for getting cozy on a date or happy hour with girls. Get the apple and Brie bruschetta and the tomato jam bruschetta. Delicious."}
{"text":"We went for dinner based upon the reviews and was very disappointed.  Lots of bread with most everything.  Tuna panini was just OK, LGO's across the street has a much better tuna melt, truly.  For apps we tried the artichoke dip and white bean hummus...while the artichoke dip was OK, the white bean dip was not very good at all.
We're glad we tried it because it was on our list but will def not be back."}
{"text":"I've only ever eaten at Postino once (and it was the Annex in Tempe), but I loved it so much that we ordered a bruschetta tray for my birthday party this past weekend. I am gluten free & I loved that I could get a whole tray of gf bruschetta!! Everyone at the party loved it and said it didn't taste gf at all. It was definitely a crowd pleaser!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!!!  It has delicious food. A great wine list and what else can you say.  It is a great place to sit drink and just talk and chill.  If anything eat the bruschetta.  Share it with a friend.  We need more places like this.  It isn't overcrowded like most places in the valley and lets keep it that way.  The one downside is parking, though I see it as a glass half full problem.  If there was more parking more people would come then it would be crowded.  So go enjoy and be merry."}
{"text":"Every time my wife and I are in Carefree she makes me drive down here at least once for lunch. What can I say that other haven't, wonderful everything. Can I please have one in the North Valley now please."}
{"text":"Long time patron. first time reviewer. Hard to believe I haven't given my two cents on this joint! I have been here a small handful of times. The service is good and so is the food, but from a noise perspective (I'm a noise nerd and acoustician), I cannot deal with the acoustics in this joint. I believe this shares part of the old post office but damn if it wasn't filled with hard surface decor making all that noise reverberate even more. 

I'm a social eater so where's the fun if it's too damn loud to hear your dining companions? Structural criticisms aside, the food is as good as my preferred location on Central. Just like the location on Central, though, I do not care for forced valet. Blocking off all the spots and not giving me a choice with what to do with my vehicle  really grinds my gears!"}
{"text":"Blah, blah, blah scrumptious bruschetta sampler. Blah, blah, blah delectable strawberry chicken salad. Blah, blah, blah fabulous atmosphere. 

O.K., so I don't have much to say that's very different from the accolades of many others. But every time I come here, whether for lunch or dinner, the experience is magical. Great food, great ambiance, great people to watch. 

And I don't even drink wine."}
{"text":"Ive been to this place a few times for lunch and always had a great experience so when a friend from out of town wanted to get together I recommended meeting here. We got there just in time to get happy hour drink prices,$5 for wine so we each grabbed a glass real fast and sat and chatted. Happy hour ends at 5 btw so go early. The crowd was light at 5 and we chatted for a good hour or so before ordering our first bruschetta board. You get 4 pieces of each selection and you can select 4 different types. The apple fig one was amazing of course the classic tomato mozzarella was to die for. The prosciutto and date melted in your mouth! We gnawed on that for about 30 mins then ordered another to try 4 more! We sat and chatted drinking just water and they kept filling our water glasses and in the 3 hours that we were there and while their waiting list portables grew they didn't rush us out of there at all. This is definitely going to be a staple on my hang out list now that I live closer!"}
{"text":"love love this place. great atmosphere and great food. they have the best bruschetta and has great deals on mon and tue night after 8pm. it gets pretty packed, so may wanna go late."}
{"text":"My favorite place by far and well worth the drive from Gilbert. Love the atmosphere, bruschetta, and of course the wine. Great place to catch up with friends. I can't wait for the location in Gilbert to open up."}
{"text":"My neighborhood spot! Great happy hour, service and vibe any day of the week. :)"}
{"text":"Very yummy! I love the bruschetta (of course). The music & atmosphere are always great, love this place! Not so fond of the valet, but whatever."}
{"text":"I'd been hearing about Postinos from some food snob friends of mine so I decided to try it out this past Friday night.  Got there at 7 p.m. and scored a table with no wait in the middle of the dining room.  Immediately I realized it was a little too loud for the audience with the music playing, but stuck it out.  I was meeting my friend's parents who were in town on vacation and thought it would be a nice, casual place with hopefully great wine and food.  They loved the architecture inside, with the exposed pipes and brick and large, open garage doors.  The patio was probably not quite as loud, but was full so we were definitely stuck inside.  

I had a glass of $11 Malbec, which was fantastic.  We ordered the bruschetta and I im in love with the artichoke version as well as the apple and brie.  I was not blown away by the mozzerella and tomato, which I thought I had heard was a guaranteed good time.  I also got the turkey panini though which I got with a salad.  It was bigger than any panini I've ever had and I took half of it home.  It had  a pesto sauce that made it the best panini I think I've had in my lifetime.  (Maybe I've had ten paninis though in my lifetime so take it for what it's worth.)  The salad I was not blown away by and was not disappointed when the waiter took it away while asking if he could take it away.

Service was a little slow, but again it was a Friday night.  The wait staff is a friendly, helpful group and didn't rush us as we sat and chatted while eating for three hours.  

Valet is $3, which is fair, but what is a riot is when you walk out, if you had your keys, you could walk the twenty feet and get your car yourself.  But instead, you have to wait behind five people for the valet to hand you your keys and THEN you walk to your car.  AFTER tipping of course:)

Overall, I will go back for the paninis, maybe try a few other bruschettas.  It will be hard to not to to LGO next door though..."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here on a date and had a great night. We were pleased we could start on our bottle of wine while waiting for our table. My only complaint is that it was extremely loud inside. We found ourselves straining to hear each other from across the table. But the atmosphere and food were great."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to meet friends. Great wine selection, and the food is always wonderful. Love their Sunday afternoons with live Reggie and sangria. Perfect!!"}
{"text":"Postinos is one of my favorite places to go monthly for a light dinner and wine. I get the bruschetta every time and I am never disappointed. The servers are always very knowledgeable on wine and will give you a great suggestion. I have had some of their Panini's and soups and those were also delicious! The Arcadia location is also my favorite Postinos to go to; I love the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Dear Postinos, 
I love everything about you.  I just wish your fabulous $20 deal was every night.  Oh well, a girl can dream"}
{"text":"Nothing too special about the place - the wine list is OK, and the bruchetta is really good, but besides that? The bar is set up awkwardly to where you don't feel much intimacy with those you are there with - it's like one big common standing area where people give you a look when you ask them to kindly excuse you as you make your way through. I've only gone there though to have apps and a glass of wine, so maybe the seated dining experience is where it's at..."}
{"text":"The butcher's block is always my go to. I sub the hummus for extra ricotta and soft baguette for the hard crispy toasts and it's fantastic every time."}
{"text":"Postino has the most amazing bruschetta in Phoenix and awesome specials! I highly recommend Postino for breakfast, lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Very efficient and friendly staff, good wine selection, bruschetta and cheese plate are great!"}
{"text":"Oddly enough I only came to this location after visiting the new Gilbert location. Have to say I think I like the Gilbert locale better and I'm almost a little sick hearing myself say that. Not sure what was up with the rap music on this visit as I am in love with the music at the other locations. Not a great fan of the valet either as they don't seem to know how to dive manual cars or operate emergency  brakes. 

So, I'm giving this location 4 stars based on the whole concept and the food (and assuming it will be better next time) but in my heart it gets 3 stars."}
{"text":"Nothing worth writing about except the bruschetta. Most of the wine tastes like cheap box wine and are unrecognizable labels probably stored in a warehouse! Salads are overpriced and no hot entrees...unimpressive."}
{"text":"Happy Hour Review

It's always fun trying out a happy hour in a new city - we know that happy hour is happy hour anywhere, from New Zealand to Memphis. So, when I set out for Phoenix to spend some quality time with family, my one goal for the low-key weekend was to hit up a local happy hour.

My great-aunt had heard good things about Postino's and Yelp confirmed it was a solid happy hour bet - coming up 2nd in the search queue. So great-aunt & grandmother in tow, I headed for Postino (quaintly named as the location formerly housed a post office!) for their Sunday afternoon reggae and white sangria. I first noted the full parking lot, which I came to find out later - has discouraged some other relatives from visiting Postino. But for an LA-kid, the fact that free nearby lots and street parking was available - well, ain't that a novel concept?

I also noted was that we did have to add our names to a waiting list; happy hour is not at the bar, per se, it's to be ordered from your seats. So we bopped around the adjacent La Grande Orange shop to bide our time - it also seemed like a good time with good food (albeit loud & busy). Thankfully, our wait was short and we were sat outside, which was fine in the 95 degree temperature - almost everywhere seems to have nice shading and misters.

My gang of three forwent the $5 wine and beer deals and instead opted for the Sunday special - $5 white wine sangria. I quite enjoyed mine, but my HH partners thought it a bit sour and added splenda. There are no food deals on the happy hour menu, but the prices are not too wallet-depleting. I got the  1/2 Italian Market Salad (greens tossed with roasted beets, goat cheese, bacon (no bacon for me!) and walnuts topped with crisped root vegetables in herb vinaigrette) and  1/2 vegetarian sandwich (grilled Asparagus, roasted artichokes, red onion, vine ripe tomatoes, goat cheese, and house-made pesto) for $9.50 and a cup of the Brocolli-cheddar soup for $2.50. 

I didn't leave any room for the bruschetta, but it sounded great - you pick four options of toppings (including brie & apples with fig spread; smoked salmon or salami with pesto; white bean with chopped tomato; ricotta with dates & pistachios, and more) for $12.75.

The crowd was pretty homogenous - youngish professionals on family time listening to the one-man reggae band. I think it'd be a great spot to catch up with a girlfriend over the weekend. And I'd love to see what kind of crowd the early evening/evening brings. To me, it seems weeknights would be optimal for a date night.

I also wonder about the 11-5 happy hour, which is great for the weekend, but I wonder who can partake on weekdays..."}
{"text":"All aboard for Brunch!  We are a Sunday Morning look for a great breakfast kind of people.  Our best friends told us that this place in the Arcadia district was now serving Brunch from 9AM and to check it out.  We arrived like 9:15AM with much apprehension as we were the only couple in the place.  The menu was limited but looked decent.  Oh My Goodness!  My wife ordered the Ciabatta French Toast.  Now she claims to just hate Ciabatta bread, but she was not in the mood for eggs.  ***** That was the 5-star rating she gave the dish as it was (as she admitted) the best French Toast she ever tasted.  I on the other hand always go for the biggest dish, so I ordered their Farm Scramble - Eggs, potatoes, onions,  \"secret\"  herbs of some sort and two kinds of cheese.  It came with a  salad of mixed greens and cherry tomatoes.  I had to take the salad even though I don't \"ever\" have salad for breakfast.  I moved the salad to one side and licked off the fork .... The best tasting dressing I had tasted in years.  So I finished off the salad (that I never eat) and dug into the eggs ... Yum Yum Yum, I now have a new favorite breakfast dish.  You want a Mimosa to go with the meal?  Order  up.  We are going back this Sunday with our friends and I would highly recommend it to everyone.  A couple at another table told us that if we thought that the Brunch was good, we should come in for dinner as those meals were out of this world.  Oh .... by 9:45AM every seat in the restaurant was occupied."}
{"text":"Postinos is one of my favorite restaurants in Arcadia!  The actual building itself is an old converted post office, complete with a closing garage door.  Great wine selection and the staff is extremely helpful if you have any questions or need a recommendation.  

As for the food, it is phenomenal!  I've had the roast beef sandwich, turkey and brie, bruschetta, salads, you name it.  I have never once been disappointed with my meal here.

I usually opt to split both a plate of bruschetta and a salad with a friend which is always more than enough.  My favorite salad is the raspberry chicken and for the bruschetta the brie/apple, salmon, pesto/salami, and fig/proscuitto are by far my faves.

This place is great for a first date, birthday, or dinner with a small group of friends :-) Looooove it!"}
{"text":"Such a great little date spot! I definitely suggest going on Monday or Tuesday nights when they have their bottle of wine/board of bruschetta special for $20. 
I am typically not a fan of mixed greens salads, but this salad is hands down one of the best I've had. Of course, it wouldn't be a trip to Postino's without bruschetta. My personal faves? Proscuitto and Marscipone, and Apple Fig."}
{"text":"this is my fav place in AZ to go. i visit about 3-4 times a year and i usually visit postino/la grande orange about 3 times minimum when i am there.

this is the hotness: everyday from 11am-3pm every kind of wine is $5/glass...hello liquid lunch.

well goodbye liquid lunch because you'll want to eat everything on the menu from the bruschetta to start (you cannot go there and not order the bruschetta) - i usually get: ricotta & dates & pistachios, brie & apples, mascarpone & prosciutto, artichoke. as for the main course for lunch, the salads are great and the paninis are f-in sweet as well.

the wine list is always good, changing a little here and there. afterwards go next store to la grande orange grocery and pick up some goods to go. 

i almost forgot - it's called Postino b/c they converted the old Arcadia Post Office into a restaurant, it's got an indoor/outdoor feel, so you don't have to sit outside in order to feel like you've got a little breeze and sunshine. there are also loungey/couch areas to sit and eat/drink if you want too instead of the traditional table & chairs.

when visiting AZ, don't miss this spot. (there is a lot of italian in AZ, and this place gets lunch right)"}
{"text":"Love the selection of appetizers. The atmosphere is perfect for lunch with girlfriends or a romantic dinner with your honey!"}
{"text":"Is there anywhere else in the Valley that does bruschetta this yummy? I think not! Love their catering too!"}
{"text":"Like this place needs any more rave reviews....It's everything that yelpers have yelped about: fun atmosphere, vast selection of wine, great bruschetta. We loved the brie and apples. The place is crowded and a little noisy, but food and wine makes up for it!"}
{"text":"1st time here!! Excellent Service by Jake...I will definitely be back, nice to see what phoenix has to offer- food was fantastic & the wine was amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Love the food, atmosphere, wine and menu selection, but some of the servers can be rude and have a snappy attitude."}
{"text":"Wow.  I am surprised at all the positive 'over the top' reviews of Arcadia. My experience on June 24 was quite different.  We found the service to be unprofessional and borderline rude. This is a place where you are supposed to relax and enjoy your companions and converse and enjoy a drink in peace.  Instead, the servers (and I don't mean just one but I mean all of them) hover over your table giving you the impression that they want you out of there. This is not good service on any calculation. It is not attentive at all but rather annoying.  Amanda, one of the servers, must have been either bored or not focused, because all she did was swish past the tables about every 1-2 minutes. It was so annoying that we started to time it and sure enough she went by again and again and again. It was as if she was on ice skates--or perhaps even more so was trying to get someone's attention.   NOT attentive but rude.  The others were abrupt in their interactions with us and frankly not very helpful. One of them just starting ripping all the glasses off the table when it was obvious we were in deep conversation. Back off! She just came up and interrupted our vibes at the table by reaching deep into the table to get all glasses. Was Postino's short of glasses? Really? This is beyond abrasive.
I can not complain about the food since we enjoyed the food and the beer and the wine.  But I can complain about the service and lack of manners and lack of sensitivity to your customers. I want to emphasize that this complaint is only directed at Postino's Arcadia. I find the other Postinos to be quite well versed on customer treatment and policy. Thank you."}
{"text":"Ohhhh Postino how I love you! I have been to Postino about 10 times and why now am I finally reviewing it...because today was my first lunch experience! And the best part about it, the patio is dog friendly! So me and my 4 legged companion sat outside and enjoyed the beautiful AZ spring weather.  I also enjoyed my Italian Picnic salad and Halo (my wonderful Belgian Malinois puppy) enjoyed a deep bowl of water with ice cubes! 

The service is always friendly.  The food is always amazing.  They have great specials. What else do you need to read, I advise you to stop what you are doing (but finish reading my review) then head over to Postino.  I will tell you to go with no intention of being in and out because I have yet to dine with out a wait.  Get yourself a glass of wine and chill out."}
{"text":"Visited for the famous $20 bottle of wine and bruschetta deal for the first time.  Loved the ambiance, our choice of wine, and the bruschetta, but I will probably pass on the bellini next time.  Warm artichoke bruschetta is excellent, and although we had to wait an hour and a half (we got there at 9pm thinking that's when the happy hour started) before being seated, the staff was courteous and accommodating as they worked to make sure we were taken care of to the best of the abilities.  Will return again very soon!"}
{"text":"Can't beat this place. Romantic ambiance (when it isn't packed and the music is too loud), the most amaaaaazing bruschetta boards and a good wine selection. We love going to their happy hour - fantastic deal. Thanks, Postino's!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out after hearing how great it is from both the reviews on here and from word of mouth. It is an awesome little hangout spot with a great selection of wine and beer and you can't go wrong with any food consisting of bread, brie, prosciutto, figs and the like.  The valet parking and the Range Rovers out front made me nervous for the clientele that comes here (as my boyfriend and I pull up in my Kia) but I have never had such excellent service.  In fact when we walked in we were slightly overwhelmed and didn't quite know who to talk to about a table when the hostess walks up to us and asks if we needed help and my boyfriend blurted out \"we don't know what we're doing!\" and without even smirking she said she'd take our name for our table of 4 and then come find us when one was available, in the mean time we could get a drink and wait at the cocktail tables. Not 30 seconds from when we walked over to the table another waiter walked up to us and asked if we needed a drink and showed us the drink menu. All this at 6:30pm on an already busy Friday night! About 15 minutes pass, our friends show up, we have our drinks and then a section of the bar opens up at the end that nobody else has taken so another waitress/hostess/whatever asks us \"are you a table of 4? would you like to sit here?\" We aren't fussy so we just sit and here we are the rest of the night. My friend even got a free Fish Head (Dogfish?) beer for just being right there when they accidentally poured the wrong one for another patron. I'll definitely have to check this out again on one of the happy hour nights, our waiter got me with the \"Bruschetta Board and bottle of wine for $20 on Tuesday nights\"!"}
{"text":"Coworkers and I go here all the time for a quick lunch or happy hour. Great atmosphere, great service, great food."}
{"text":"Great food. Unfortunately I haven't been back over here because it's so loud that it is impossible to have a conversation. I wish they would do something about it because I miss going there"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and I'm happy to report that it's still as great as ever. I met a couple of my girlfriends here after work last week. We stayed for hours at our little patio table and the wait staff was attentive, friendly and helpful the entire time. The wine was nice and the portions are generous. The bruschetta is beyond belief good. It's really just a proven nice place to spend some time with people over good food and wine. It will always be one of my go-to places."}
{"text":"Postinos is 'that place' that I just adore. No matter the occasion or time of day, I have never been let down.

I first went to Postinos on a date, and it was incredible. (I'm referring to both the guy & the food!)

The wine list is incredible - and there are almost always specials going on so you can try something new without breaking the bank. The food is delicious - I always suggest anyone try the bruchetta planks, and any of their salads are a delicious choice. I love both the Arcadia and Central locations the same; Arcadia seems to be where I frequent the most just due to proximity of our home. If you haven't been, just try it! Great food, great drinks, great staff, and friendly customers."}
{"text":"Great food, service, ambiance, and prices! Had a great time ordering a bunch of the bruschettas, and we just paid $10 a person. Our server was very nice and attentive and easy going. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Wow, $20 for a bottle of wine and bruschetta is an awesome deal.  (Mon and Tues nights)  The wait was long and it was loud inside, but the night was still very enjoyable."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!
The bruschetta is delicious, we've tried just about every one! My favorite is the brie and apple, something amazing about that mix.
The wine is always great too, with a lot of options and the staff is very informative! The cheese plate is a good mix of cheese, bread, nuts and fruit. 
The set up is so cute and it's a great place for a date (friendly or romantic). My only complaint is that the flies drive me nuts! 
You have to try this place, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Unlike Radio Milano, I am a big fan of Postino. The wine list is extensive, the roast beef panini is awesome and fulfilling, and how can you not love their bruschetta?  It's a great place to hang out with friends and chill. I am over most of the nightlife in Phoenix, but Postino is one of those places I don't mind coming on any given day. 

One downpart is the wait. A couple years ago, it was pretty easy to stroll in around 8pm on a Friday night and get a table. But, this is more a testament that Postino is a great place to hang out than anything else. Another disappointment is the fact refills are not free. 

Postino is one of my favorite places, and I hope this place doesn't fall victim to becoming a Radio Milano or now LGO (which has disappointed me as of late)."}
{"text":"Great place to go and relax, best brunch ever! Had the bruschettas and butcher's block with a Bellini and it was sublime, best way to start my day!
If you're in the mood for beer the pitcher is only $5 and they hace a very good selection of tap beer.
Excellent music and decor, even the restrooms are so nice and relaxing you even feel like if you are in a spa.
If you want to feel like you're on a holiday this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Great place for wine!!! Check it out on Monday and Tuesday for cheap wine and food. Great service, really nice environment"}
{"text":"Simply delicious! They even have gluten free bruschettas! One of my favorite places. Will be back"}
{"text":"Like everyone else in phoenix feels that's been to postinos, the Monday Tuesday $20 deal, is unbeatable. Which is exactly why you'll be waiting around for at least an hour on those nights. But when your looking to go on a nice date or double date this place provides the perfect atmosphere, great wine selection and bruschetta your whole table will be raving about all night. I never knew I was such a big fan of Fig until I tried the Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpon. You will never find me here without getting one of those. Every soup that I have tried here has been fantastic. This place is a must for every person living in the valley."}
{"text":"Great job Yelp and Yelp reviewers. We only selected this restaurant because of the good reviews. We were expecting a traditional Italian restaurant but it turned out to be much more fun. We ordered the pasta fagIoli soup and shared four bruschettas and a couple of glasses very good wine. Great music too!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!

This place is good at everything...good dinner, good post-dinner glass of wine, good lunch, good mid-day glass of wine...  

Everything I've eaten here is excellent.  My favorite is the variety bruschetta.  The wine list changes, and it is always good.  The service is always excellent... the servers are knowledgeable on the menu and wine, and extremely attentive.  

Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"the place is nice very hipster food  ok nothing to write home about needs a better beer selction with some more euro stuff"}
{"text":"I need to find a way to add glittery stars around this: YUM!!!! DELISH!!!!! 

I recently ventured to Postino again, and it is probably the only place that I can fall in love with over and over again. Okay..a bit dramatic..but I take food seriously (if you couldn't tell). 

The location and ambiance are perfect. The interior is decorated very tastefully and the selection of wine is proudly displayed. The patio is wonderful and relaxing. 

I was there for lunch and ordered the half panini (prosciutto and brie) with a salad (raspberry chicken). The panini was stuffed full of fresh ingredients and perfectly crunchy. The salad was crispy, with delicious chicken and sweet/tart raspberry dressing. 

The service was impeccable, while all along being super friendly. This seems to be a hard thing to find these days. 

And on a sidenote...what makes Postino special is not their extravagant extensive menu, but the simplicity and thought that goes into every single ingredient. And these ingredients are of the highest grade and quality. You will not find a load of crap on your plate that you don't need or that kills the true flavors. 

Heaven. 

Or at least what I would like to eat there."}
{"text":"Reggae Sundays are not to be missed. We went this last weekend and had a blast. I've spent a lot of time in Spain and they served the best sangria I've ever had--by far.
Postinos is ALWAYS good. But Reggae Sundays are a real treat."}
{"text":"The bruschetta is amazing. And the wine is great too. And $5 before 5 p.m. everyday. Also, $5 pitchers of pretty good beer. And $5 mimosas."}
{"text":"So, I'll keep this short and sweet, since reviewing Postino's is like writing a review of your best friend - there is never enough space and there is no doubt I will forget something! 

But in general, I always have a great time at Postino's! Love, luv, luhv the brushetta with my favs right now being fig and prosciutto, brie with apples, the white bean and pesto and salami! You also can't go wrong with their salads and sandwiches! Plus, I heart that the GF BF can make his own brushetta experience by ordering the platter off the appetizers list! It's basically a deconstructed brushetta platter with all the fixins!! 

The by the glass wines are usually very good, although they mostly will be ones you have never heard of! Never a bad thing to try something new! Their by the bottle selection rocks and I so appreciate their few nods to Washington wines like DeLille etc! 

Finally, what makes me love Postino's aside from my wonderful company, are the servers! I have to show some love for Dominic, who is simply wonderful and always takes such good care of us (thanks for picking out all the bright green olives for us yesterday!) He is GF too so he feels the plight of all of you trying to avoid that evil flour! Also a treat to see Troy as well! 

Finally, don't miss the $5 glasses before 5 pm on all days, including Sat and Sunday! It may make me slow on Monday morning, but at least I'm still smiling from the memories!! Thanks Posties!!"}
{"text":"Great location and atmosphere. The menu has many wonderful selections and the wine selection is plentiful. Service is very fast, friendly and professional. I enjoy the small plates or half sandwich and soup. They are always good."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. I recommend the bruschetta to all first time visitors. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is really good.  I absolutely love their bruschetta.  For $12 you get to pick four of their takes on the classic.  My favorite was the goat cheese with red peppers-- so tasty.  I had their turkey panini which was really good, and even better at about 2am after a night on the town.

The service was really good too.  My water was always full and our waiter was always nearby.

One thing I didn't like, however, was that they have cans of soda.  I like fountain soda better, plus this usually means refills aren't free, which is one of my biggest annoyances at a restaurant."}
{"text":"Great bruscetta salty carmel sundae, and of course wine.  Service can be a little slow from time to time but not a big deal.  Love the sparkling sav blanc on a hot day.  Cool atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"I love Postino's! Great food, great staff! Get the bruschetta, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"When we came to town to see the Lakers play the Suns, we stopped by here for a glass of wine.  This place is great!

Put this place on your list of places to go in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Monday and Tuesday night after 8pm, you can get any bottle of wine and a whole board of bruschetta for $20. It's a steal, and a delicious one at that."}
{"text":"I love Postino! There is nothing better than sitting outside on a lovely afternoon, sipping wine and munching on the best bruschetta board in Phoenix. This is one of my favorite places to go for happy hour, appetizers, wine and/or dinner, and I'll continue to go back often."}
{"text":"Hard to believe this was the old post office I used to go to with my mom. I know people go here for happy hour, etc., but to me this is a certified lunch place. $5 wines at lunch, amazing bruschetta, and reliable sandwiches. I look forward to going to Postino's every time I'm in town.

To people who claim it doesn't feel like you're in Phoenix: what?"}
{"text":"It had been awhile since I had been there for brunch and they sent me an e reminder that they do brunch. Well the power of suggestion, you know. Enjoyed very much my mimosa and french toast with berries and creme fresh. My boyfriend had the american breakfast version with toast, eggs and bacon and also liked everything he ate. The french press was strong, the way I like it. And it's a beautiful outside spot to eat."}
{"text":"You must get the Brushetta and order the roasted bell peppers and goat cheese! One of the best! It is usually pretty crowded and can be kind of noisy but if you know that going in ask to sit on the patio!"}
{"text":"I live for this! Every time I'm in Arizona I make it a must stop to visit Postino's. I've tried almost every variation of their Bruschetta now and all of them are great in their own ways. My personal favorites are the Salmon, Apple, Prosciutto and Artichoke. Great wine selection and yummy desserts too!:)"}
{"text":"Great apps, wine and beer.  Can get a little crowded, so get there early in the evening if you can!"}
{"text":"Amazing place to enjoy wine and a variety of tasty bruschetta. My favorite ones were the warm artichoke spread and ricotta with dates and pistachios."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, cool servers and who can complain about $20 bottle and bruschetta?   (Some of the better bruschetta I've had the pleasure of tasting... and I'm a crazy Italian girl).  The only thing that shot down the last star is that, while I'm sure the warmth of the Tempranillo didn't help.... It was extremely toasty inside.  No fans or anything to move the air around and in this AZ heat, if you're gonna keep those garage doors open, help a sista out who's sitting on the inside.  This hair will curl if I'm sweating during wine night.  

But I still love you and no hard feelings.  See you on Tuesday."}
{"text":"So cute, I love this place! My profile picture was actually taken there. Very great patio, we held a post graduation party with about 20 people and it was perfect. One person in our party unrolled her napking to find a coupon for a free dinner in the napkin, what a great idea! Very fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Bruschetta is a must here. All the flavor options are delicious, but a personal favorite is prosciutto and fig. Soups are delicious as well. Only downside is parking. The lot is really small so you either have to do valet or park further down the street and walk over. Great place for lunch or snacks with drinks in the evening."}
{"text":"Good food and wine = Yay!  No parking = Boo!  All in all, a nice place to visit on a week night.  I hear the happy hour is awesome, but I have never been during the happy hour time frame."}
{"text":"Luved the Bruschetta....For 12.75 you get a choice any 4 from the Bruschetta options...My fav was the Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone...Amazingly tasty !!!! A recommended pick for sure...Good place for wine and a chat with frndz."}
{"text":"1100+ reviews can't be wrong. The bruchetta plate is to die for, pannis are huge. Initially thought the price might be high, but ether are totally sharable and the service is top notch. Attentive without being annoying. A great selection of $5 mid-day wines by the glass encourages day-drinking. My dining experiences in Phoenix have been hit and miss (mostly miss) -were I a local, I'd be a regular. Flavor profiles and ingredient quality is top rate."}
{"text":"Great food and ambiance. Bruschetta is on par and very tasty! Cants beat 20 dollar wine and bruschetta board night."}
{"text":"I had a business lunch here, very cool vibe, great sandwhich, I'd go back even though parking is a pain."}
{"text":"Been here 50 times. I always leave thinking it was a great night! The service is amazing, the variety of their wines always has me come back for more and the bruschetta, oh my, it was piled high and delicious. Great portion sizes and flavor combinations! The staff is always fun and professional."}
{"text":"I had a written a review here on 6/30/2015, but I don't see it here anymore. However, I had a less than pleasant experience at this restaurant on my Birthday & I was very upset & disappointed. Why I give them 5 stars is, because the District Manager himself replied to my Comment & was humble enough to apologize profusely on behalf of his staff & put it right. I did say I would never go to this restaurant again, however much I loved the food there.
But Mr.Cox was so nice, that I couldn't even be angry for too long. He made it special & thanked me for giving them a 2nd chance to do things right. I didn't expect anything or even expect anyone to read or reply to my comment. I was so touched when The District Manager himself had replied the very next Day.
I will certainly go back & I thank Mr.Cox for being so kind to me. Your Kind words meant so much, at a time I was so sad & upset. This world needs more people like you. Your staff is so lucky to have you, & if they decide to take you as an example, I am sure the Manager who was there that night, would learn to be nicer to his customers & not laugh at them. I appreciate Your kindness & Your way of making someone feel better. It means a lot. Thank you very much."}
{"text":"Postinos has some of the best bruschetta I've tasted. its a classy little bistro looking place with really good lemonade as well.  its not too expensive but its definitely not cheap either. I would recommend this for a lunch type of place but not too big of a dinner,"}
{"text":"first time here the coke'd up owner stopped by our table and hit on my girlfriend. I would have never come back if he wasn't doing such a kick ass job with this place. Its really well done. The one wall opens up onto a wooden deck letting in the warm breeze. Food is well done and they have an excellent beer and wine selection. Style and substance. Prices aren't so bad either."}
{"text":"First, just be careful of sitting on the planters on the north side of the building if you have to wait for a table... sometimes you might get surprised by ants... 

Now, if that didn't scare you away (and I was trying a little, because I am hoping to tamp down the wait time a scoche) please enjoy yourself!

Postino's Arcadia location is the original forerunner in the revitalization of the Phoenix scene. Postino. Cleverly located in a former Post Office. Thanks USPS.  

If you find yourself here with a wait (not always, but sometimes) look about yourself. The patrons at this location are uber friendly. With a larger-than-average number of regulars, some of them have very good stories to share, and are particularly generous. 

We waited one night and had two gentlemen with a high top table offer to let us share their space. It was a rousing good time full of mutual ease, and they left before our party of 3 had finished. When we went to pay, we found out they had taken care of the entire bill. Thanks guys!

It's that kinda place. A little magical, a little homey, a little bit of wonderful with great food and plentiful draughts, and just enough contemporary edge that you can impress a date, or drink with the dudes."}
{"text":"Very classy. And a classic.
Not for a big dinner or a party over 10. 
Small group, small bites, share a bottle, maybe a cheese board; a guaranteed good time.

They have beer too. Great beer."}
{"text":"I was visiting a friend for the weekend and didn't have much time and wanted to go to my favorite places that I've already tried and liked.  She suggested we try Postinos but I whined because it meant we would miss one of the other places I'd been thinking about for months.  I'm so lucky she pushed the issue and took me here!  I don't even remember those other places and want to visit her again so we can eat at Postios!

We were there before 5 and did the $5 wine special and a bunch of the bruchettas plus a salad.  All of it was delish.  I didn't want to share!  I will say the food combos were fantastic but simple enough to try at home.  I grabbed a take-out menu and brought it back to Los Angeles and have been making my own bruchettas that taste pretty close.  My whole family raves about them."}
{"text":"Would give 5 stars but deduct one because it can be inconsistent.

 I love this place, definitely one of my favorites in the valley. I have been quite a few times and I find that the lunch time spread is better than dinner for some reason. Usually they're pretty packed no matter what time of day I visit, but for some reason my plate always seems to be better looking and more plentiful at lunch time, than when I have gone at dinner time. Either way, the food is amazing, I always get the bruschetta- the mascarpone fig is my favorite, the almond hummus comes in second, and the pesto salami third. SO GOOD. I've visited a few times with friends who have gotten a panini and the verdict always seems to be \"meh, it was okay\". I think when you come here the thing to order is the bruschetta if you don't want to be disappointed and trust me you wont be. 

They also do $5 dollar pitchers (small) and $5 glasses of wine till 5pm and you can't go wrong with that! The service here has always been great, will definitely be back. They also have an outdoor patio which is my favorite and i always request to sit outside, it also seems to be dog friendly."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch, we had the butcher's block, smoked salmon, farm scramble, fresh press coffee and fresh squeezed Bellini. The butcher's block is a must try, everything was very well seasoned and it's a great plate to share and snack on. The smoked smoked salmon was a great order to start your day with for brunch. The farm scramble was ok and it wasn't something to die for tho. Overall, customer service was good and the waiter directed to our problems in a timely manager."}
{"text":"Can't say anything that's not already been said, just reiterate it.  Fab bruscetta!  Can't go wrong with any of those selections. I've been in the evening when it's super crowded, but my favorite time of day is lunch especially when it's a beautiful day and the garage doors are open, you can't beat this place for ambiance!"}
{"text":"Great food and really cool laid back atmosphere"}
{"text":"I always love going here--feels like home in a great sense.  The decor esthetically pleases and relaxes me.  The service is always individual and
usually great (one slightly short bartender in Gilbert once ... ),  and the food (bruschettas mostly) makes me smile ... Contemporary take on them is refreshing."}
{"text":"I had read great reviews on yelp about Postino during my pre-trip planning.  I had it marked as a won't-go-out-of-my-way-to-eat-here places but would-eat-here-if-the-opportunity-presented-itself places (mainly because of the long wait).  I came to the area for Le Grande Orange Grocery but Postino was right there.  My friend and I had a late lunch here and got to take advantage of the $5 per glass wine deal from 11am-3pm daily.  I love that the wine is served in mini-carafes.  

I had the Pick Two deal for $9.50 and had half an Autostrada Panini and a bowl of chicken noodle soup.  The Autostrada was simply marvelous - proscuitto, sopressata, cappicola, mortadella and provolone with a balsamic vinegrette and olive oil.  The bread was incredibly good.  

The restaurant is housed in an old post office so it has an industrial feel to it.  The decor is hip and the waitstaff is very friendly.  The atmosphere is very chill and there is a diverse crowd."}
{"text":"I love Postino! It is such a cute place for a date, girls dinner or anything! We had wine, bruschetta and a sandwich and it was all delicious! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Met up with a new friend and an high school classmate there last night. Didn't feel like I was in Phoenix, which, no matter where you live, on occasion, can feel like a really good thing. More like being in Ess Eff...very urbane. Their crostini were great--brie and apple (not super imaginative, but still good), and ricotta/fig/pistachio--excellent. If you go on a 110+ day, be aware that their a/c system isn't up to handling it. We sweated it out last night until enough people left to help cool the place off. We're new to Phoenix, so we'll be trying the other La Grande Orange eateries on that corner."}
{"text":"I absolutely love positno! Has a very nice Ambience & Service is always great.  Great spot for a date or girls night out! Such a nice selection of wines. The only downside to this place would be that they don't have many options or dairy free or gluten free! Other than that it's a great place to sit and grab a glass of wine!"}
{"text":"Good Stuff can't beat the happy hour. Definitely sign up for their email prior to going in and you should receive a free bruschetta board email."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite places!! I've been here on multiple occasions and have no complaints! Food is great and I love the atmosphere. My go to place!"}
{"text":"LOVE the brushetta!
Great location - fabulous service - and nice wine selection!"}
{"text":"You know what I LOVE about Postino's?  THE PATIO IS DOG FRIENDLY!!!  We love to go there on a Sunday afternoon and share a bottle of wine or champagne, snack and enjoy the cool weather!  It's a great place to meet the girls for lunch too!  Great snacks, salads and wine selection!  Great neighborhood hang out!"}
{"text":"Postino Arcadia has excellent food and a great ambiance, perfect for a date or just a relaxed evening out.  Everything I have eaten there has been top notch, and I would specifically recommend the cheese plate, as well as the prosciutto with brie panini.

The one downside is the completely unnecessary valet parking.  While not that much money ($3), it feels like the restaurant is trying to squeeze a few more bucks out of you and is not a nice way to end the evening."}
{"text":"Postino's is a well decorated, little restaurant located in a former post office. My husband and I shared an order of bruschetta. We chose the apple and Brie, salmon and capers, BLT, and seasonal bruschetta. They all were quite good and imaginative. We were there in the afternoon, but I would definitely recommend the $20 bruschetta and bottle of wine special on Tuesday and Wednesday (I think that's right) after 8pm. What a deal! 

My only criticism is that it felt like we had two waitresses and one of them wasn't very friendly."}
{"text":"Who hasn't written a review on this place?  What's another 5 star review going to prove? LOL

Anyway, everything on here is true.  The bruschettas are simply heavenly.  It's as simple as that.  When you combine locally baked breads, with the best toppings around, you just can't go wrong.  The bruschetta and bottle of wine special can't get any better.  Their soups and cheese platters are yummy too.

Beware, parking stinks but they do offer complimentary valet during limited hours."}
{"text":"I stopped in on saturday because some friends told me that i was missing \"one of the best places in town.\"  So we stopped in for lunch.  

What a pleasant surprise. We weren't to hungry so we shared a bruschetta plate. I was so surprised bruschetta could be this good. My favorite was prosciutto with figs and mascarpone...drool.  

We came for the food but stayed for a few glasses of wine. Their list is extremely diverse and we ordered some glasses that we have never even heard of. They ended up being very satisfying.

Highly recommended, and we will be back."}
{"text":"My wife and her friends have raved about Postino and I finally had my chance to take in Postino a few days ago. 

The bruschetta is excellent. I had a hard time determining which was my favorite, but the white bean and tomato barely edged out the salami/pesto and mozzarella and tomato and basil. I don't think you can go wrong with any of the 8-10 choices on the menu.

I was very impressed with the food. I ordered the Nine Iron Panini and really enjoyed my meal. The panini was cooked perfectly. The chicken, bacon, mozzarella and dijonnaise went very well together. 

Often at trendier places, I'm not full after my meal. Postino filled me up though.

The service was very good. Our waiter was attentive to our needs and provided the check in a timely manner.

I can see why this place is popular. Very good food, nice atmosphere and a place to enjoy some wine with friends in a casual setting. 
.
The only downside is the limited parking and valet parking."}
{"text":"they probably don't need another review but here it is! always spot on! every single bruschetta flavor is delicious. interesting wines, great dessert."}
{"text":"Fabulous! I only give the effort of recreating at home if it's worth it...and the boards were well worth it! The wait staff were very helpful in picking out wines too! Good happy hour and weekend specials too!"}
{"text":"Bruchetta board, pitcher of Kronenbourg, sitting on the patio, stellar service and boyfriend = death because this is the best dining experience I might ever have. 
 Favorite slab consists of: Roasted Red Peppers on Goat Cheese, Warm Artichoke, Dates, Pistachios with Ricotta and Sheeps Milk below a sweet Tomato Jam. 

 The only *bad* (more so just personally annoying), thing I've ever come across here, had nothing to do with the food itself or even the servers..well not our server..was when one of the ladies walking around clearing tables felt the need to express to us that SHE has OCD therefore, we needed to remove the last 2 pieces of bruchetta from the board, so she could clear it..because it was making HER uncomfortable..

 Never push your 'disorder' off onto someone else and expect them to abide, especially when your customers are deep in mid-conversation about serious things like puppies and the night's baking agenda...this customer will not yield and out of spite, leave a lingering, lonesome bruchetta upon the slab for your sake.

 I, too, have a disorder - not caring about your fear of individual bread pieces on a plate.

 Despite said occurrence, there are NO complaints, ever. A valley staple that I recommend highly, for all occasions."}
{"text":"Love this place! Happy hour is great and extremely reasonable prices"}
{"text":"Love the food and wine here!! Can get a bit crowded but a great place to go after lunch in the middle of the week on a day off :)"}
{"text":"We were a very large group here recently, and we were treated quite well.  As our group continued to grow, our server brought more tables, chairs, and kept the food and wine coming.  We were here on a Sat. afternoon, and it was packed.  The atmosphere is quite casual, but it is classy at the same time.  I loved how comfortable the couches were (and I don't usually like to sit on a public couch)...All in all a great experience.  I appreciate that the valet is free, but I prefer to park my own car."}
{"text":"Great food, great Sangria, great live music, great vibe, great service EXCLAMATION MARK. Overall it was a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"Love everything about this place: The food, the atmosphere, the people watching! The happy hour is good too!"}
{"text":"This place is fast becoming a favorite happy hour stop for my fiance and I. Service is friendly, the panini's are delish and the bruschetta is to die for. Anything with their yummy fig jam is amazing. I love the ambiance. Very casual, trendy and lively with great outdoor and indoor seating. I'd say service is on the slow side, but it's understandable b/c the place is always packed. They have  pretty good happy hour deals. I will say that the parking situation kind of sucks (valet only unless you want to park down the street). But other then that, I have no complaints and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Really great atmosphere, wines, etc... but I didn't think the food was very good, so I give it only 3 stars.  The bread is very thick and maybe uncooked, no oil.  It was not what I expected.  I was hoping for crunchy bread with creatively delicious toppings.  The toppings are great combinations, just not executed like I expected.  I thought the bruschetta would be warm, but instead it was cold, nothing melded, and the bread was very large.  Great concept, but I don't get all the great reviews."}
{"text":"Obsessed with Postinos! I live right down the street from there and frequent it quite often. I'm a vegetarian so it's sometimes difficult for me to eat places but at Postino's they have wonderful meat-free bruschetta options. They also have excellent Sangria for those who are looking for a lighter fruity alternative to wine. I like to go there on Sunday's and drink $5 Sangria pints and listen to the reggae band. So fun!"}
{"text":"Food is good for what they offer, wish they had more to choose from other than bruchetta, salads and sandwitches. I think that's a good menu for lunch, but if you dine there for dinner they should have a few entrees to choose from like a pasta dish or something more flavorful. When you eat sandwitches at dinner it just feels wrong, especially if you just have time for a dinner date. However what keeps people coming is the dim hip atmoshere, the open layout, the wine and the twinkle lighted patio. Parking is a bitch, so bring cash for the Valet."}
{"text":"This place is amazing and one of our favorites when visiting Scottsdale. The Bruschetta is by far the best I have ever had (several varieties to select from) with a large enough portion for two. They also have a great wine list ($5 a glass between 11-4). Asked the waiter for any evening special for the week ( They had a plate of bruschetta and a bottle of wine for a great price after 8pm)"}
{"text":"Now I've been to the Gilbert location, and Arcadia, and I have to say I think I like Gilbert better. Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of Postino...amazing food and alcohol, great happy hour deals, and a unique atmosphere, I just didn't dig the Arcadia spot as much. Parking was kiiind of a pain...not many spots to park in. They have valet parking but when you don't have a bill on you it makes valet diffifult (valet guy was nice polite and friendly). Service inside was spot on as usual. Awesome bruschetta, cheese board, and butcher block. No other issues. Great local wine bar. If you're in the valley and looking for a cool spot, don't leave without checking out a Postino."}
{"text":"Bruschetta and the butchers plate are very delicious. Wine list is good. For happy hour up until 7pm, wine by glass is only 5 per glass! Great value! The restaurant has great ambience. Could be a nice date night kind of place. Lovely experience."}
{"text":"I love their bruschetta and wine nights - it's always packed, but you can stand outside and have a bottle of wine brought to you while you wait. All of the bruschetta is amazing (that I've tried), and the atmosphere is young and fun. The only reason it gets four stars is because the music inside is really loud and difficult to talk over and the lighting is super low. No, I'm not old."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's hip trendy and fun. The crowd is always fun to watch and I especially love love the olive canoe. It's my favorite. We had some great wine and great company and everyone I take to Postinos seems to really like it."}
{"text":"Now that it's an established business and has expanded to all parts of the universe, I would expect the menu to undergo a bit of a refresh as well. Visited the Highland and Scottsdale location and even though the new location and great use of an old building is great, the menu seems stuck in the past. Bruschetta and wine, even at its best, seems old hat."}
{"text":"Food and service are great.  However, had a nice table indoors with a great view but in came another indoor group that brought in a lap dog in a Green Bay jersey.  No leash, no harness, no restraint and certainly not sanitary (Management?).  Love dogs, but please be considerate of others (including those with allergies) and sit on the outdoor patio."}
{"text":"I've been craving to wine and dine here for so long, since my friends rave about it. So I finally got my opportunity to experience Postinos yesterday... Sunday Funday. It definitely felt like summer w/  the live reggae band that actually sounded more like Jack Johnson... enjoyed the music either way... while drinking amazingly refreshing sangrias. I was eager to order from their impressive wine list (definitely next time), but my friend influenced me to taste the sangria... which I'm normally not a big fan of... But it wasn't overly sweet at all.  We of course ate their infamous bruschettas... delicious!  Service was super friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Such a great place!!!!

The wine selection is awesome and the bruschetta rocks! 

If you are still hungry, walk across the parking lot to LGO and get one of the better pizzas in AZ!

PERFECT date spot!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this restaurant. It is perfect for a special occasion or just for a nice night out. My favorite is the bruschetta, I love that you can mix and match. They also have great sandwiches and salads. I will definitely be returning!!

It is definitely a trendy restaurant and expect to pay for valet parking ($3 I think) and to wait for a table."}
{"text":"Been here twice and plan on visiting again. The bruschetta platters are amazing. Also, Im a huge fan of  the Cucumber Honey Lemonade. Just remember one thing...be open minded about trying new things. Its all fresh! Nothing processed or frozen. Good luck and enjoy :-)"}
{"text":"Bruschetta was the best we've ever had - beautifully prepared, really tasty, and a great variety. Five stars for the Bruschetta. The salads were good, maybe 3.5 to 4 star fare. The sandwiches were also very good, four solid stars. Good service, nice surroundings."}
{"text":"OMG!  this bruscetta is to die for!!!  how I have not been to this place before, I don't know.  Great selection of wines and boards...get a pretzel rod when you go...to die for.

the brie/apple/fig bruscetta and the artichoke are just amazing...

great atmosphere in the old arcadia post office which is VERY cool with the glass garage doors open!!

lots of servers always milling around casually so you are well attended to..."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Amazing food and wine! Service was great! Beautiful experience."}

{"text":"Visiting Postino Wine Cafe makes me feel like I am in another city... an urban, metro, pedestrian city such as San Francisco. Its casual, yet sophisticated and quite enjoyable. I recently visited Postino with two friends and had the Bruschetta -- we selected the Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato and Basil, the Smoked Salmon and the Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese. Thumbs up on all of these yummy appetizers! The clientele is a hip, diverse crowd reflective of its gentrified, charming neighborhood of mid-century ranch homes, and yet just a hop from the Biltmore and Arcadia neighborhoods. Ah... Phoenix is growing up! Wish I knew more about wines to tell you more about that. It appeared to be a nice selection and there were bottles you can buy to take home as well. Parking is a challenge, however I will definitely be back.

Update: Postino's is one of many restaurants/bars in AZ that permits concealed weapons without permits and is noted on the Arizona State Rifle and Pistol Association in their CCW Cafe page: http://www.asrpa.com/ccwcafe.html For that reason I am reducing the previously 5-star rating to 1-star."}
{"text":"I'm embarrassed at the number of times I've eaten here since it opened.  i used to live half a mile from here and was one of the first people in the door.  The bruschetta is the best in town--period, end of discussion.  The salads sometimes aren't my favorite, but there are plenty that are delicious.  I'll admit that the cheese plates also sometimes leave me wanting, but that is a rare occasion.  It has been interesting to see the wine selections evolve over the past several years.  When it first opened, Postino seemed to have nothing above $35/bottle, and that selection was good.  It stepped up its game in the past two or three years and now boasts a more diverse and more expensive selection (e.g., Sea Smoke pinot noir).  I appreciate the addition of even better wine, and am happy to say that the glass list remains reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Love it all!!  Food, wine atmosphere. Only down side is the acoustics. Hard to have conversation and be heard"}
{"text":"Went there for an early brunch and we were driving to LA so we skipped the wine!  Their bruschetta is absolutely outstanding. The best we've eaten. Ever. We would go just for that again :-) oh, and will make sure to sample the wine too!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for a date and conversation. The decor is unique since it was a restored post office. Lots of lounge and table type seating.Try the bruschetta board! I always order the sweet tomato jam and sheep's milk, ricotta and dates, apples and brie, and salmon/pesto. Consistently great food & drinks. Service has more spunk and personality at this Postino location too. Try the cucumber lemonade if you don't like wine or just plain water. If you order wine and it isn't happy hour, you can easily spend more than $30 on yourself. However, I think it is worth it, and I always leave full and happy. Thanks Postino!"}
{"text":"Another of my favorite winebars (which is hundreds of miles away). I used to hang out with work friends for \"happy hour\"; the great part is we would drink and talk for hours and never once felt rushed to empty the table. My absolute favorite dish is their caprese sandwich and potato soup...the potato soup is cream, perfectly made, and full of flavor!"}
{"text":"Great wine selection,cozy atmosphere, excellent service and great food.  Its nice to find someplace out side of Scottsdale, nicer than most wine bars in Scottsdale without the SD attitude!  Love it!!"}
{"text":"Went to Postinos for a quick happy hour with my wife, sister and law and her boyfriend who are in town over the weekend. Just ordered drinks which I thought we might catch some flack for but our server Alexander was awesome. Brought the girls a sample of two wines that matched what they were looking for. (A dry white and red) awesome service drinks and experience. We haven't been to any of the other locations but I'm guessing they are also great. Might be time to try some of the others."}
{"text":"Just go.  Get the bruschetta.  Get a $5 glass of wine.  Get another.  Get another.  Get another.  Call a taxi.  Come back tomorrow.  Repeat as needed."}
{"text":"This place had such a great atmosphere. The wine list had a really good selection to suite just about any taste. Their food was great too. I highly recommend trying their bruscetta, I never knew there could be so many ways to eat bruscetta!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Postinos Arcadia! What's not to love about a beautiful, modern indoor-outdoor restaurant, with excellent paninis and bruschetta and a fabulous selection of wines by the glass?

Reasons why I love Postinos, and you may too :)

1) Great building with modern/chic decor - There's ample indoor and outdoor patio seating, and it's the perfect spot for lunch with the girls, or a date, or whatever! Parking can sometimes be tricky, but 9 out of 10 times, the valet guys will be there to help you (valet is free!)

2) Butcher's Block Appetizer - $14 and well worth it and perfect to share - It's loaded with an assortment of artisan meats and cheeses served with tuscan beans, olives, nuts and crostini - Yum!

3) Bruschetta - $14 for a choice of 3 - The bruschetta is made with beautiful thick, large slices of crispy, fresh bread, and topped with all sorts of delicious toppings. My favorites are 1) the Brie, Apples and Fig Spread, 2) Prosciutto with Figs and Mascapone and 3) Salami with Pesto

4) The Wines! Great selection of wines ; there's something for everyone.

5) Happy Hour! $5 glasses of wine/beer Everyday between 11am-5pm !"}
{"text":"I Love this cute little wine bar and almost felt like I was back home in the Bay Area. The bruschetta was good. We ordered the brie & apples w/ fig spread, mozzarella w/ tomato & basil, roasted peppers w/ goat cheese, and salami w/ pesto - nothing fancy, but tasty nonetheless.  Service wasn't the friendliest. Best deal in town has got to be their happy hour - $5 glasses of wine from 11am to 4pm daily! They also have a good Belgian beer selection."}
{"text":"I've heard so much about the bruschetta of this place that I just HAD to try it.  Well, the bruschetta is alright.  Nothing mind blowing.  Decor is nice.  The garage door concept works well to blend the outdoor and indoor seamlessly.  The table set up is pretty roomy for a winebar.  The good stops there.  The bread on one of the bruschetta was SO hard that it chafed the skin off the roof of my mouth.  Bruschetta with epidermis?  I don't think so!  Now what really killed it for me was how limited the wine selection was (by the glass that is).  You only had 1 choice for each type...WHAT?!?!  Hello...did I not just see the name \"winecafe\" in its name?  I was really disappointed and the servers DEFINITELY don't have a clue about the wines.  I asked for a recommendation on a cab and she asked me if I wanted red or white.  Yeah...'nuff said."}
{"text":"Today My son and I went to Dental Brothers. It was a great clean atmosphere, the staff were awesome and everyone was very nice and professional. If you are looking for a dentist then I would say go to Dental Brothers."}
{"text":"Great place to eat and drink and enjoy a relaxing night out!"}
{"text":"I've been putting off writing this review for ages, mainly because I love it so much that I want to do it justice. You're intimidating me, Postino! You're intimidating me with your loveliness!

Just get your butt to the Monday/Tuesday happy hour special. Just do it and get it over with for the first time so henceforth you will realize that it is where you need to be on Monday and/or (yes there have been a few occasions I have gone two nights in a row DON'T JUDGE ME) Tuesday night. 

You get any bottle of wine and a plate of the most decadent bruschetta, for $20. We're not talkin' a few little slices of bread with some chopped romas and basil... We're talking about full-flavored, substantially protein'd, tasty-ass bruschetta here, folks. You get to choose 4 of the 12 varieties they offer, and you get 4 slices of each. That way you and whoever you go with, can try them all. TWO PIECES OF EACH FOR ME AND TWO OF EACH FOR YOU, NO CHEATING. I'm watching you. And counting. And nomming. 

Here are my favs:
The prosciutto w/ figs and marscapone
Smoked salmon w/ pesto
Brie & apples w/ fig spread
Tomato jam & fresh sheeps milk cheese

Good god I want it and I want it now.

Some of the wines I've had are excellent. Some are just ok. That happens when you frequent this place as much as I do, and their wine list is ever-changing. I have discovered some of my favorite wines here, and nothing ever that I would turn my nose up at. 

I've now written so much about their food and wine that I am going to skip right over ambiance. It's awesome. End of story. And well worth the sometimes 1 hour wait.

Probably my favorite restaurant in Phoenix. Probably."}
{"text":"So relaxed, great food, great drinks. It's a little trendy but it's hard not to be when the atmosphere and food is perfect!!"}
{"text":"Beautiful food and beautiful people at a great price.  Can't beat that.  $5 pitchers at happy hour.  I had the chicken & mozzarella panini.  It was delicious."}
{"text":"This place is nothing short of EXCELLENT!! The ambiance, the food, EVERYTHING was exceptional! It was my first time here and the place itself was welcoming enough! The ambiance and everything. My favorite was the bruschetta! You can pick four types and they were all so good! The poblano soup was was so tasty! I would go to this place everyday! This is definitely worth going to!"}
{"text":"I love this place!   The bruschetta and the Italian Picnic salad are my favorites.  Great Happy Hour with $5 glasses of wine.  I would recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"Have you ever been to Postino for lunch?  I think of it as an after work spot, but the lunch is really good.  It's peaceful and pretty at Postino at lunchtime, the bruschetta is just as tasty during the day as it is in the evening, and the panini are good, too."}
{"text":"Went there with friend for a late lunch.  It was very busy for a Sat. afternoon.  People were very friendly and we spent the 30 min wait at the bar with a couple of glasses of wine.  The bartender was very much on top of it.  We ordered three appetizers: Cheese plate, olives and tomato+ mozzarella.   All was very good.  The prices didn't make sense though.  I think the cheese plate was a fantastic value considering what you get.  But the tomato and cheese version was prob. not worth the money.  The bowl of Olives is what it is.  I liked it, my friend wanted some salty olives in there too which was all oil cured olives.  I am a fan and will go.  Just a side note; it seems that you have to have many visible tattoos to work here, so if you don't want your wait staff to be very casual and with lots of piercing etc. be warned.  Also, we saw a person who must have been a mgr scold a couple of the staff in front of everyone which I thought was not necessary.  Mainly because they weren't doing anything wrong secondly I am sure this could have been done in the back of the house.  Overall, nice atmosphere and loved the garage door open walls which gave the open air feel.  I liked how the bartenders were on top of it even though they were busy.  Our tap for the three apps and 4 glasses of wine was $50 plus a $10 tip makes it not a cheap place to just chill in the afternoon but I will be back prob. later in the evening for a happy hour or something."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Postino between five and ten times, honestly I don't really remember (that's not a good thing), because I had a client for a while that loved the place.  This is not a review based on one visit.

Postino is a very \"trendy\" Arcadia hangout.  All the cool kids go there and love to be seen sitting in such a chic environment.  Postino and it's counterpart La Grande Orange are both modeled after a European experience.  The atmosphere is fun and it does make you feel just a little more important than you did before entering their door.

The food on the other hand is uninspired and nothing exceptional.  Yes it is good, yes it is somewhat unique, no it does not deserve the amazing amounts of praise that it enjoys.  The wine selection however  is good, there should be no problem finding something you like

To boil it down, we have a decent meal with a good wine selection, in a super trendy place to eat... Perfect for people who care more about appearances than food.  That being said you should try Postino out, it is fun and maybe you will think the food more inspired than I did."}
{"text":"I loved Postino. The happy hour was made better by their wonderful wine selection...the happy hour extends to pitchers of beer as well. 

The bruschetta was phenomenal and I could say the same about our sandwiches. The staff was friendly, helpful, and came by just often enough to make sure our glasses were never empty. We were here in the early afternoon and, with the garage doors open, there was a great breeze throughout the restaurant. I didn't notice one open table yet it didn't feel crowded nor did we have to yell over one another to have a conversation. 

Next time I am in Phoenix I will definitely be coming back here. Each and every time."}
{"text":"Found this place online and decided to take a chance and try it on Tuesday night. The drive north on Central had me a little worried until I got about a block away. What a relief to see a trendy, cozy, but still airy sort of place. Exactly what I wanted in a nice wine bar. My friend and I felt fine in nice jeans and cute tops.

This particular day they had a great special. We got a bottle of La Posta wine (I think that was the name) and 4 pieces of bruschetta for $20. The wine was recommended by the waiter...he knew what he was talking about. We got the bruschetta with apples, figs and brie; salmon and capers; prosciutto with figs & marscapone and the last had salami on it. The apple bruschetta was my favorite.

I'll be back and will take more friends to experience the food, wine and atmosphere."}
{"text":"If there was ever a restaurant deserving 5 stars, this is it.

We met some friends here on our last night in Arizona and it made a great book-end for the trip. We went on Monday, when they have a $20 deal for a bottle of wine and a plate of bruschetta. The wine that they serve is their \"house\" wine, but it knocks the socks off of your typical house wine. The Bruschetta makes a great meal by itself if you want. There are 11 choices (various toppings) and you can have up to four different ones per plate (really a long-handled cutting board, which makes for a nice presentation). The Bruschetta is carefully sliced into smaller pieces so that several people can try each kind. Be prepared to eat and drink a lot; it is such a deal that you will have a hard time saying \"no.\"

I mostly stuck to the beer that was on draft. There were only two choices, both very good. The draft beer was fresh and refreshing, plus at $7.50 for a small pitcher anytime it was quite a deal. If you come for the earlier happy hour it is $5/pitcher or $5 for a glass of wine, so you can't go wrong. It makes sense to have a small draft beer selection since they are a wine bar and it helps them move through the kegs quickly. I ordered the prosciutto with brie panini, which I had no trouble sharing with my friends. You get the choice of ciabatta or focaccia bread and fresh-made chips or salad- the chips and ciabatta bread were great. Our server helped me pick the ciabatta bread, which she accurately described as the \"thinner, crispier\" one for my panini.

The service here is amazing. Our servers were very patient and helpful. The busser would give any Indian restaurant a run for their money with his diligent water-refilling, plus he was thoughtful enough to get our server's attention if we needed anything else. Everyone was dressed nicely and very friendly. At one point a piece of bruschetta fell onto the table or the floor. Without even mentioning it, out server brought over a replacement. She must have noticed from somewhere else in the restaurant and wanted to help.

The restaurant had a very appealing atmosphere. Lights were dim, but not dark. The colors on the walls made it feel vibrant. Chairs and tables were comfortable, well-maintained, and fit in with the style of the restaurant. It might have been louder if we sat inside, but we were on the patio. Outside we sat in the shade (we arrived when it was still daylight) and the water misters helped keep us cool. The bathrooms are in the back corner, opposite of the front door. You might have to ask a server to point out where to go, but they are glad to help. The fact that the bathrooms simply say \"Both\" could be an interesting conversation point if you have to wait in line.

The parking is valet, but you shouldn't be driving anyway. Take a cab if you can help it, or bring a designated driver. The experience is so nice that you won't want to leave, unless maybe you make a friend to bring with you."}
{"text":"Best happy hour - $5 glasses of wine and pitchers of beer. Favorite place to go for good food and drinks on a Saturday afternoon! ! (get the tuna sandwich)"}
{"text":"I love this place! I have been here many times and I have always had a great experience. The bruschetta is something that I always get because this place is more of a app and drink place. The only bad thing is becasue this place is so good there tends to be a wait sometimes, so try to go in the off hours."}
{"text":"Food is not bad. Not enough lighting for a meeting. Dinner menu is pretty sparse. Not the place to go if you're not into wine. I've heard the pizza place next door is really good though"}
{"text":"What can I say, but date spot in the valley... Fair prices (esp. during happy hour) and the BEST bruschetta I've ever had... Period...end of discussion."}
{"text":"Enjoy Postino's atmosphere and selection of wines and food. I especially enjoy sitting outdoors with the garage doors open. My favorite times are Sunday afternoon with the live music."}
{"text":"Cant beat the bruschetta here, or the butcher's board."}
{"text":"I really adore this place. I've eaten here many times and the food has always been excellent. The atmosphere is fun and hip. The servers are friendly and helpful.

They offer a wide selection of bruschettas. Each selection is more delicious than the next! I especially love the prosciutto with figs & mascarpone and the ricotta with dates & pistachios. Their salads are tasty and are a perfect portion. I love their Pub Board with a nice cold lager. When they have tomato soup you should get the grilled cheese panini. Soo good! Good prices on wine and other drinks. I've never had to wait very long for a table, maybe 5 mins at the most. The only downside is parking. The last time I went valet was mandatory and felt a little ripped off to pay $3 for someone to park my car three feet from the valet stand. Oh well!

Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"LOVE. LOVE. LOVE. 

What a great place this is! I mean wine and bruschetta? You can't get better then that!  

 On Mondays Tuesdays they have a bottle of house wine and a bruschetta for $20!! What a steal! The only down side those days WILL be busy but it's totally worth the wait! (And you can start drinking your wine while you wait. They have little tables you can stand around or sometimes areas you can sit!)The outside patio at night is to die for! But it can be a bit noisy! 

Wonderful \"girl night\" get together spot!"}
{"text":"I miss Postino's.  Once upon a time, I worked less than a block from here, and frequently stopped by for lunch or after work for some wine and bruschetta.  To this day, I have never had anything like their bruschetta.  Don't order it as an appetizer; it's definitely a meal.  Large and luscious, sweet and savory, served on a slightly rustic wooden plank, topped with amazing things like apples, soft cheeses, figs, and pistachios.  It's the stuff dreams are made of.  I wish they would hurry up and open the one in Gilbert.  I'm never in Arcadia at the right time anymore.  Also, do not expect to find parking here; you will definitely have to valet.  That's not just a Postino's thing, though, that's an Arcadia thing."}
{"text":"We started with the bottle of wine and bruschetta for $20. It a great deal. I don't remember which ones we got but they were good. They were not my cup of tea though. My gf wanted and ordered them. I just had a few. But I'm a really picky eater. I don't like most things. But I could tell that most ppl seemed to really like them. 

Then I ordered the 9-iron sandwich. Like I said I'm a really picky eater. I don't like a lot of stuff. It was good and I can see if u want something different and unique how it would be good. But the cheese they used was weird and kinda gross to me. It was one if those weird name funky cheeses and that is the point but just not my kind if food."}
{"text":"Awsome!!!  Tried the prociutto with figs, brie & apples, and the roasted peppers.  All excellent (although my wife couldn't take the wild game taste of the goat cheese).  We also tried some sandwiches and salads......all excellent.  Didn't try their alcohol  but the bartender seemed really cool and knowledgable as we sat at the bar waiting for our table."}
{"text":"Love Postino! Haven't been to this location for a few years. The food was good and the service appropriate. The decor is tired looking and the room would benefit from a facelift."}
{"text":"I came here to meet a friend who I hadn't seen in ages. Some how the waitress assumed we just needed to catch up and decided, on her own, to not ask us for drinks or food for a solid 40 minutes. My friend, who works in the food industry, strongly insisted we should walk out. 

I insisted we stay because I'd been itching for some bruschetta. Finally, when this waitress noticed us we ordered. Food was decent, wine was great, Sub-par service. Love the neighborhood and the atmosphere. Might be back, but I have no strong desire to."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about Postino. As far as locations go, I think Gilbert has the best food overall followed by Postino Arcadia and then Postino Central, but I would give all of them 5 stars except Postino Central which I gave 4 (due to freshness of ingredients).  

If this is your first time trying Postino, you MUST try the bruschetta. It is out of this world. I've been to a couple of different other places that seem as if they are trying to copy Postino's bruschetta, but it is never as good. 

Aside from the bruschetta, the salads are wonderful, all of them, my favorite being the italian picnic. 

Most importantly, the wine is amazing at Postino. If you are not sure which to try, ALWAYS try the Postino exclusive. It will never let you down. All the locations except for Gilbert will let you take home an unfinished bottle which is really nice also. Even better, on Mondays and Tuesdays if you come at 8pm they have their special - any bottle of wine AND a tray of bruschetta! It cannot be beat!!"}
{"text":"Super awesome place for a romantic glass of wine (or two) with your best friend or lover. Great music, service and menu. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Always awesome.  Very good service, consistent food, great (rotating) craft beer on tap."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the entire LGO strip.  Yesterday was my first time a Postino's for lunch.  I've had their food before when we catered from them for work functions.  

I really like the atmosphere...very urban-chic feel.  Lovely interior design.  Makes me feel like I stepped into a restaurant you would find on the streets of Manhattan or San Francisco.  

We shared a bruschetta plate that allowed 4 options from their extensive \"toppings\" menu.  It was a lot food for two people, so I had the privilege of taking home some leftovers for dinner.  All I can say is, \"Yum!\"  I liked the variety of options and the rich, organic flavors (and if you really think about it, it's just toppings on some good, crunchy bread.).  

I also tried their cucumber lemonade drink.  Very interesting and different...but definitely refreshing.  I would say that I'd order it again because after I left the restaurant, I found myself wanting more of it.  

Parking is the only thing that sucks about that place...hence, just giving it 4 stars.  Thankfully, valet is complimentary during lunch (but we still left a tip).  :)"}
{"text":"i like the monday nites where bottles of wine at par & u can order flat bread pizzas from across the lot - sister place. Small & intimate, good servie, pretty ok patio."}
{"text":"Oh ya, can I get amen,  Their bruschetta is to die for and combined with their 5 dollar wine specials.  Then you have to try their sunday with the corn nuts and chocolate covered pretzels."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and wine.  The bruschetta boards are enough for a small meal for two people.  The atmosphere of Postino's is relaxed so that you are comfortable sitting enjoying your food and drinks without feeling rushed.  Make a reservation, this place is always full."}
{"text":"Oh. My. Bob!

Two words: TOMATO JAM!!!

I live in California -- The Bay Area. I recently went to Phoenix to see my best friend. She took me to the Arcadia Postino my first day there. We split the Bruschetta Board. My friend eats there all the time, so she picked the choices. I was 100% behind three of her choices and hugely timid to try the fourth choice -- the tomato jam. Let me say again. Oh. My. Bob. Words do not convey the splendiferously deliciousness of the tomato jam. Angels sang a chorus of hallelujah's and I'm pretty sure I had a mouthgasm on the spot. She barely got a bite before I horked the rest of it down. The rest of the food was great and the service was fantabulous but really it's all about the tomato jam for me. Tomato Jam! Tomato Jam!

Now I'm back in the desolate tomato jam-Postino lacking wasteland of a place I call home and am jonesing for a tomato jam fix!  Best friend, shmest friend, I'm going to get my butt back to Phoenix ASAP just so I can have more Postino and tomato jam!!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about Postino. I lived in Phoenix for eight years, and Postino is one of the only places that I consistently went for anything from dates to meeting friends to dinner with my parents. Every single time (I probably went over 30 times), the service was great, the food was perfect, and the atmosphere was enjoyable.

A few tips:
* If you order a panini, always get it on focaccia. Both breads are good, but the focaccia is amazing.
* The tomato jam bruschetta is probably my favorite item on the menu. It's a perfect \"dessert\" bruschetta for after you finish the others.
* The raspberry chicken salad is AMAZING.
* There's really no way to go wrong with any of their desserts, but my favorite was the vanilla creme brûlée.

Honestly, I really hope I can find a place as amazing as Postino where I'm living now, but it's going to be tough to beat."}
{"text":"My sister and I went in for some food because the pictures we found on yelp looked so tasty! I didn't realize it was more of a wine bar until we got there but was definitely happy to be there, I was totally feeling the vibe. It's very cute and trendy, great music, good staff. It's a great place for any occasion really... My sister and I ordered the bruschetta and split a panini and the food was most definitely AMAZING in every sense of the word. The  burst of flavors was exactly what I was looking for and totally hit the spot! If I had not had to be up at the crack of dawn the next morning I would have definitely split a bottle of wine with sis but we didn't have much time and were just wanting a bite to eat. I will be back for that wine though, I think my sis and I found our new favorite neighborhood place! I'm so glad we stopped by, I seriously can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"This place took me a few times to warm up to.  At first it was trying too hard to be cool and the food was so-so.  But now it's pretty rad and their bruschetta/wine special on Mondays and Tuesdays can't be beat."}

{"text":"i come here just for the bruschetta boards. delicious! they have great deals on drinks too"}
{"text":"Postino is normally one of our favorite local spots to grab a drink and some dinner. Last night however, was a different story. I can honestly say that after our experience yesterday evening, we will more than likely not be going back to Postino for quite some time. 
     The first issue we had was witnessing a waiter take water glasses off of a table, dump them into a pitcher of water, then dump that pitcher into another pitcher, and continue to go around the restaurant refilling cups. I for one think this is absolutely disgusting, and refused to drink my (much needed) glass of water. This was all before we waited roughly 15 minutes before being seen by a waiter at all. We placed our drink orders, and a few minutes later our drinks showed up - great. At this point we placed our food order. About 15-20 minutes later our bruschetta showed up, we nearly finished off the board, and about 30-40 minutes later, we had still not received our main courses. I kindly asked the host at the stand behind us if he could tell us how long it may be, since we had an appointment we needed to be at soon. He came back to our table, and said that our waiter told him it would be just a few minutes. 5 minutes later our waiter came strolling up to our table, with no food. He said that he hadn't put in our order, and that it would be out within a few minutes. Again, we said that we had somewhere we needed to be, and were very polite. About 5 MORE minutes passed, and finally our food showed up. I asked for the check, saying once more that we had somewhere to be and needed to leave immediately following our very late meal. We finished our meal, and sat for somewhere between 5-10 minutes AFTER our plates were empty before our check arrived. Mind you - we watched our waiter walk around the restaurant the entire time, talking to other servers, the host, and anyone else other than us. We were never given a discount, and had to pay for the entire (completely unworthy) bill.
     We were throughly disappointed in our most recent experience, and have already warned others of the poor service we received. Would definitely avoid this place if you have any hopes of having quality service."}
{"text":"This place makes me feel sexy. the wine selection is endless and did i mention it made me feel sexy?  I usually shy away from Scottsdale, cause I am not plastic enough............but there is something very earthy and graceful about this place that makes me feel very Audrey Hepburn....watch out Scottsdale, hot moms.   Watch out. 

The indoor and outdoor seating options  are close together but arranged in such away that you feel tucked away.

At first glance, you may be worried that the food will not be filling....WRONG, the paninis and bruschetta menu is plenty and reasonable.  My friends really enjoyed the apple/brie/fig brushetta.  I was happy with the basil/tomato/chicken panini.........stuffed.

Little extra bonus.........Valet Parking $3.00 ( which now,  living in chicago....this is cheap)."}
{"text":"It can be loud, it can be busy, the parking always sucks, (valet typically required)...but
 i am never disappointed.  Food quality is excellent every time.  Bruschetta of any variety is to die for. I love that they serve a little dish of giant green olives in kosher salt with your wine.  Kinda like chips and salsa for the Highbrow."}
{"text":"My husband and I just moved to Phoenix from NYC, and everyone told us that the food in Phoenix will never be as good as the food in New York.  We COMPLETELY disagree - the food at Postino was far better than the food at our \"go to\" neighborhood wine bar in NY.  We could not believe how delicious the food was at Postino, and the service was incredible too! The artichoke dip put Houston's to shame, and the bruschetta, and vegetarian panini were all mouth-watering.  We greatly look forward to going back!  My husband woke up this morning and said, \"Let's go to Postino again\" and it hasn't even been 24 hours since we were there..."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place! My husband and I met another couple here for dinner. We got 4 types of bruschetta- the seasonal, goat cheese with peppers, one with prosciutto, figs, and marscapone, and Brie apple and fig. All 4 were amazing!! I ordered a salad and the broccoli cheese soup. They were both good, but overshadowed by the amazing bruschetta. They had a very nice wine and beer selection. We saw on the patio under a heater and that made for a very nice ambiance. It took me a bit to catch on that we didn't have just one server, but that all the servers help all the tables. All in all- I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Wow!  The Bruschetta is phenomenal!  I love this place, and if you're looking to go out with a small group of friends, and need a place where you can have fun, but eat too, then this is the place for you.

Beware though, if you go during regular dinner rush, expect to wait at least 30-40 minutes before being seated.  I have eaten at Postino's on several occasions, and have never received bad service, that's of course after you have waited for 45 minutes.

If you want to try a place very similar without having to wait so long to be seated, but you can sacrifice a little bit of the quality than I would recommend The Living Room in South Chandler.  Otherwise, enjoy the food at Postinos and have a great time."}
{"text":"Went there today to catch up with an old friend. Had the bruschetta, you have numerous flavors to pick from. One of the ones we had was a combination of green apples and brie...it was so good! I had a side salad to go with it, a Mediterranean salad with a creamy, cool dressing. I also had a beer, can't quite remember the full name, just remember it said Twilight Ale. One of the best beers I've ever had, smooth, not too heavy, not bitter, perfect for a hot 114 degree summer day. Can't wait to go back!

Would give it five stars, but parking there is very limited and you are almost forced to valet."}
{"text":"Great place with great food. They are quite slow with getting you sat. This location will have a \"reserved\" sign for two seats at the bar and 3 vacant tables, yet there will be a line of 5 groups waiting to get sat. It's almost as if they don't staff enough for the nights they know it will be busy."}
{"text":"LOVE...this is by far the best wine bar in AZ...I love their ambiance and of course the bruschetta...every person I take here ends up loving it and coming back for more."}
{"text":"Greatest date spot! Literally every first date I tell them to bring me to postino's. Thank the heavens the wait staff doesn't out me to each date. But like, the food is good too, so.. definitely eat here!"}
{"text":"Postino Arcadia became a weekly event with friends on Monday nights.  We went for the $20 board of bruschetta and bottle deal. Because it's such a great deal, there was always a long wait.  But no worry, because wandering through the store at LGO is a perfect way to kill some time.

The bruschetta and bottle is usually enough for two, but we like to add in the Butcher's Block which is a selection of meats, cheeses, olives, and asparagus.  

I love Postino for providing a great place to be with friends, wine, and great food, at an excellent price on a Monday or Tuesday night.  I think it starts the week off right."}
{"text":"This place has the best wednesdays in the valley! I love all of their bruschettas! I will always love this place!"}
{"text":"Best place in Arcadia!  $5 for 5 is a great deal where you can get any glass of wine for $5 before 5pm everyday.  Their food is delicious and it's in a cool building that used to be a post office.  Their patio is also dog friendly.  This is a great place to meet friends and day drink!"}
{"text":"Excellent bruschetta and a nice wine selection. We went during lunch and parking is a bit of a nightmare but once we got inside we were seated rather quickly. The design is crisp and trendy. Cool place and we'll be back. Maybe sit outside next time."}
{"text":"I am a fan, the area is very small so parking is a pain but the restaurant itself is very nice and the food is great."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a 3.45...I don't know, maybe I was expecting more from the more than 50 glowing reviews. 

I am more of a drink and mingle kind of girl, but there is no mingling to be had at Postino.  On the other hand, I can also be an intimate conversation kind of girl, but I didn't feel that was to be had at Postino either.  The room was loud and bright - hence the lack of intimacy.  Maybe it's because I went around happy hour?  Maybe better at night?

As stated in previous reviews, the bruschetta is truly awesome!  I love the fact that they let you choose up to 4 toppings - very original idea.  The service was fabulous, we had more than 4 people attend to our table throughout the evening and our waitress was very helpful with wine & food recommendations. 

I will be back - that's for sure. And definitely for the $5 wines when I get the chance from 11-4.  But maybe I'll have lower expectations which will likely result in a better experience."}
{"text":"Stopped here for some after-work vino with a friend and co-worker.  Loved the atmosphere and quasi-outdoor space; great wine list, too.  Service was a bit odd - at times overbearing and at times fine.  I'll definitely be back when I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"love the atmosphere, the wine, and the bruschetta! great girls night/ day spot!"}
{"text":"I finally visited Postino's after being in AZ for a year...and I'm glad I finally did!  Great drinks and great food!  The bruschettas are to die for...but stay alive so you can come here again and again!

Staff is friendly and vibe is really chill...you can come after work with a few friends or bring a larger group to celebrate. 

The ambiance is superb...the indoor/outdoor seating gives great options depending on the heat!  :-)

Run, don't walk to Postinos (depending on how hot it is!)"}
{"text":"There's not much more I can say about Postino than hasn't already been said... the food is incredible, the wine list is extensive, the menu is reasonably priced, the ambiance is delightful, and the service rocks!

I was there last night and enjoyed the $20 bottle of wine + bruschetta deal after 8 p.m. The portions on the bruschetta deal were surprisingly generous, and amazingly delicious! I went with the mozzarella with tomato and basil, the goat cheese with roasted peppers, the smoked salmon with pesto, and ricotta with dates and pistachios; I loved the first three, but I would not order the date and pistachio bruschetta on my next visit. 

I also ordered the \"pick two\" panini and salad/\"soup of the moment\" combo, with the Brie and prosciutto panini and a healthy serving of tomato soup. The panini was scrumptious! It was perfectly prepared, and tasted amazing ... I wish I had ordered the full sandwich! The soup was just OK - it wasn't bad, but it was nowhere near as exciting for my tastebuds as the panini. 

I would liken my dining experience at Postino to \"If You Give a Mouse a Cookie\" -- after I had one phenomenal item, I had to have them all! After polishing off a bold and zesty Syrah from California, I ended up leaving with a bottle of the Reunion Malbec from Mendoza, Argentina. Restaurant patrons receive $9 off bottles of wine to-go, so I mean, I wasn't gonna not... (perfectly acceptable use of double negatives).

Although it is a trendy spot, Postino has somehow managed to remain friendly and unpretentious - both staff and guests alike. The servers all know their stuff and are more than happy to provide recommendations based on your preferences. Even the least sophisticated palate will feel comfortable dining here on account of the helpful service and charming atmosphere; hence why I hereby award Postino with my first 5/5 star review! 

Aproveche, my friends!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food, ambience and wait staff"}
{"text":"Woohoo!  This place is a great place to just chill and relax with a great glass of vino or an ice cold beer.  Great open atmosphere and friendly staff.  The ambiance rocks at night and the staff are very helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"I love this place. The embiance is a cross between laid back and classy. Great wine and LOVE their bruchetta!  This is a great place relax and enjoy an evening or an afternoon."}
{"text":"The food was great but our service was terrible. We had made reservations for a large group and was greeted as if we were the worst table assignment she could have ever had.  We had wine and bruschetta which were both amazing. It was pretty busy for a week night and extremely loud for a sit down restaurant.  I'd make reservations and go with loud friends."}
{"text":"I'm in love with Postino.  I do love the outdoor seating area, open air restaurant, wait staff, food, drinks - everything. 

 I have been coming here for well over 4 years and recently branched out from my usual picks.  I tried the Mediterranean salad and Veggie panini- both great choices!  

If you are looking for GREAT wine, AMAZING bruschetta, and a relaxing evening out, Postino is the place!  I've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Always a solid place to have a relaxing glass of wine and very casual laid back food! If you happen to visit the Phx area you should for sure add this place to your short list of stops!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love postino arcadia. The bruschetta is always delicious and the wine deals are great! Everyone is always very nice and friendly!"}
{"text":"This place is perfect the FIRST DATE SPOT, as well as being a major fan of burchetta.  I was originally a fan of it the crispy bread appetizer...but the first time i came here...I had the tomato jam...and it literally CHANGED MY LIFE!!  I am sure there are about a thousand people have reviewed this place, but one more won't hurt.  Great spot...and the best time to go is a Tuesday, just because of the deals, and be prepared to wait.  Typically a 45min wait.  THAT in it self should tell you something about the food and atmosphere of the place.  Oh..and the staff....SOLID 10!!!"}
{"text":"The food and wine here are amazing. The atmosphere is so comforting, its a treat to come here. Oh and the bartender is wonderful! Super friendly and personable!"}
{"text":"I won't even venture to guess why so many people like this place. But a few notes: no, it is nothing like a European cafe; no, it is not an actual wine bar; yes the service absolutely sucks.

We came here for a friend's birthday party. Her mother had arranged ahead of time for 10 of us to be there and to have wine brought to the tables and poured and some appetizers brought out while we were waiting for the guest of honor. But before that, let's start with parking. 

You can't park in the residential streets because you need a permit. Fine. I heard they had a valet and there's nothing on their website about parking so, whatever. I head to the valet who asks me if I am dining at Postino's or La Grande Orange. I say Postino's and he says \"Ok, that's $3.\" I asked if they seriously were charging me for valet parking based on which restaurant I was going to and they wouldn't answer. I asked if there was an ATM since I had no cash and they told me there is one but it doesn't work. I got back in my car and drove around looking for a place to park for about 15 minutes. Fantastic.

When I get there, about 6 girls from the party are standing at the front waiting for someone to notice them. Finally, a very unfriendly gentleman pointed to two tables and said \"Those are yours. Those other tables where people are eating are also yours but they're not done yet. We told them when they were seated they needed to be done in an hour but they're still there.\" Ok, so now we only have two of our four tables. Great. Finally they seat us at our two tables. Another unfriendly staff member comes over and plunks down a few wine glasses and asks if we want a glass of temperanillo. She pours one of the girls a random taste and then walks away. Upon her return I asked if this was the wine we were supposed to have because it was a Malbec. She argued with me about that for a few minutes until I pointed to the label. She said \"Oh\" and walked away. I never did find out if we were supposed to have the Malbec.

At this point, the other two tables had been cleared. No one brought any other glasses or put the tables together, so we did it. Also, no one opened the other bottles, and yes they were screwtop, but still. So I opened them. Finally, everyone else arrived. We still only had 4 wine glasses. After trying in vain for several minutes we finally managed to flag down the unfriendly woman and asked for more wine glasses to which she responded, rudely \"We don't have any more.\" and walked away. I had to ask three different rude, uninterested staff members for wine glasses and managed to finally get another few but still, not everyone ended up with a glass. 

Seriously? Anyway, the bruschetta came out. While the menu offers a lof of different ones, they are all so deplorably bland and under-seasoned that they felt unfinished. The fig, marscapone and prosciutto should have been good but the poor pig that gave its life was disgraced. Dry, flavorless. Most of the bread pieces weren't even cut all the way through so we were all man-handling the pieces to get them apart. The bread was obviously just grocery store bread and I doubt anything is truly hand-made. The issue is, the quality of their ingredients sucks. They obviously buy the cheapest grocery store crap they can and then mark it up. Everything, even the apples on one of the bruschettas were lacking in any real flavor when they should have been tart and crisp instead of dull and mealy. 

And as for a wine bar? Seriously. A joke. They have a half of a sheet of paper, one side, as their wine list. No flights, no tastings. But for the audience it attracts who are easily impressed by over-priced glop and wine in a trendy area, they'll continue to do just fine. I will never be back."}
{"text":"I love this place!  It's a fun place to sit and relax and sip a glass of vino.  Be sure to order the bruschetta...I especially love the figs and prosciutto."}
{"text":"I like this place for their appetizers (bruschettas and olives), their wine and beer selection and their happy hour prices ! Its a perfect after work before dinner kind of a place."}
{"text":"OMG I was taken here as a reward for upgrading a friend's laptop and I most definitely got the good end of the deal. While crowded, did not have to wait long to be seated, attended to quite promptly and ordering was not a hassle, I picked up the Roast Beef Panini with home made potato chips and I know my chips, these were awesome, and of yeah the sandwich was huge I only ate a quarter of it but trust me it did not make it overnight at home, enjoyed it with a gusto. Nice energy that flowed in the place, must do again."}
{"text":"To die for bruschetta.... savory and sweet, like you're having appetizer/entree with dessert. I love tomato jam & sheep cheese, ricotta with dates and pistachios, prosciutto with figs and mascarpone and smoked salmon. I just wanna try them all next time."}
{"text":"I liked it. The food was pretty good and the wine and beer selections were great.  It's definitely more of a happy hour spot for me though."}
{"text":"Postino's is a great place for a date or evening out with friends.  The Arcadia location is in a cool neighborhood and the building opens up on one side to an outdoor patio... which is awesome on an evening with nice weather.

I have to admit, I haven't tried very much from the menu.  Every time I come, the rest of the table and I order bruschetta to share and some wine.  Although I'm sure the rest of the food is great, I really do recommend bruschetta.  There are 12 different varieties to choose from, with everything from the classic tomato, mozzarella and basil to brie with apple slices to prosciutto.  Every single one is delicious.  They work well for one order for two people, so order accordingly.  For our group of 4, we got 2 orders.  With four varieties each, we got to try 8 of the 12 available.  It was easiest to say that we'd try one of everything, with the exception of the ones that had an ingredient someone at the table would prefer to skip.

We also split a bottle of wine, which complimented the meal very well.  Our server was knowledgeable enough to recommend a bottle based on what we were in the mood for, and he really hit the mark.  We were amused that the woman whose job it was to fill water glasses would come around so often that the glass never got below half empty.  It was almost too much, but hey, we stayed well hydrated.

The atmosphere is very \"cool\" with dim lighting, modern decor, and a definite wine theme throughout.  Service has been excellent each time I've dined here.  Those are perks for sure, but the bruschetta would keep me coming back anyway!  Check out any of the Postino's that may be near you!  If you go in on Monday or Tuesday after 8, their date night special is a bruschetta platter and a bottle of wine for $20.  Can't beat that!

Keep in mind that Postino Arcadia is valet parking only ;)"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this location!! The food at all the Postino's are very consistent and delicious, but at this location I've always had the BEST service. Everyone is very friendly and attentive.

My fiancé and I always share a bruschetta board and chicken mozzarella panini. Yum!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely one if my favorites in Phoenix! It's a tradition to make a stop when I come visit."}
{"text":"Eat, drink, be merry.

Love the atmosphere. Love the upholstered loveseats, love the bruschetta and salad. Love the open air.

Don't love the horrid parking options. 
Don't love when I'm seated on the wooden chairs. How can we be expected to relax and drink up when our bums are bruising?

Servers? Easy on the eyes. Nice bonus for girls' night out."}
{"text":"I can honestly say that you would've never caught me in this place if it hadn't been for my boyfriend suggesting it as one of our first dates.  The things that scared me away: valet parking and an overcrowded parking lot and the assumed pretentious wine snobs that frequent the area.

Of course, I was right about these concerns when I actually tried the place.  However....that doesn't mean that it can't be enjoyed with the right company.  The wine choices are unbeatable and they have a great app menu, of which I highly recommend the bruchetta (you can choose different several different toppings for one order and they were all equally delicious).

It's a great place to chat with friends, or go on a weeknight to grab some vino.  I'm not dying to go back anytime soon, so it's not a favorite for me.  However, I can see how some people would make this wine bar a regular stop."}
{"text":"I love the decor and ambiance, the food is delicious (try the brie panini) and there are plenty of wines to choose from. Plan on spending an hour or two to relax."}
{"text":"Postino's is my go-to carb-load-locale.  While the decor is rather industrial for my delicate Rococo sensibilities, it's always a warm environment for a rainy day--or the more frequent sunny day.  As for food, I always opt for bruschetta: great to split for a great price.  My personal favorite is the Sheep Milk and Tomato Jam.  A bite of this is like a bite of Christmas.  Try it and you'll understand.  Of course, everyone is nuts about the Pear and Brie, as well as the Proscuitto.  If your a vegetarian or keep kosher, opt for the Proscuitto without the proscuitto, as the figs and mascarpone carry boatloads of flavor and delectability on their own.  I'm also a sucker for the Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios.  The NYC Grilled Cheese is always a great choice as well--a savory treat that brings you back to childhood.  For non-wine drinkers, go for the Cucumber Honey Lemonade (and don't be intimidated by the icky sci-fi bright green color--the sweet and fresh taste is well worth it).  Of course, if you are a fine wine connoisseur or just a recreational drinker, hit up this classic Arcadia locale on Monday or Tuesday when you can get a bruschetta board and a full bottle of wine for just $20... incredible, I know.  Overall, everything at Postino's is pretty incredible, and so I highly highly recommend it.  Happy dining and wining!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to visit in the valley. Good wine and yummy apps. I've been here several times and I've never been disappointed. This place is a must!"}
{"text":"We had an event catered last night by Postino for a group of 30.  

The event was a fabulous success.  The food was terrific.  The service, both during the planning process and delivery was excellent.  

If you've never catered food before, please, for your own sanity, consider Postino.  They have an easy menu.  It's affordable.  They're easy to work with.  They also offer discounts for non-profits.

We will be using them for many events in the future.

Thank you Postino!"}
{"text":"This place is great!  I love it, not only for the ambiance and decor, but the food is great too.  Some people might not like that there aren't a lot of menu choices (mostly salads and sandwiches), but that is perfect for me because I am too indecisive if a menu has too many choices on it.

LOVE the bruschetta.  I get it everytime.  Share it with friends though, it's pretty big, even as a meal.  My favorite choices are the Tuscan White Bean and the Prusciutto and Fig bruschetta- but they're all pretty good.

If I had one complaint, it would be the parking situation.  It's really tough to find a spot to park so you pretty much have to valet.  They added some parking across the street, but it's still not enough.  Other than that, this is a great place to go and chill out, have a glass of wine or two, and enjoy some nice light food.  Saturday afternoons are probably the best time to go if you want to avoid the rush."}
{"text":"I cannot even begin to say enough great things about Postinos! Great food (try the artichoke bruchetta...yummy) , great service, great prices, and a wonderful atmosphere! If you haven't been there, you are missing out!"}
{"text":"Great happy-hour, try to slam 6 mini-pitchers in an hour!"}
{"text":"Excellent brunch on a Saturday at a reasonable price.  Quick and diligent service for our group of 12.  Everyone left satisfied and the check for all of us plus a hefty tip was less that $200."}
{"text":"The best of the Postinos in Phoenix. Epitome of a great restaurant and dining experience."}
{"text":"Great place to eat and drink for happy happy happy hour! $5 wine and great bruschetta!"}
{"text":"Everyone loves this place, it's always crowded, and their happy hour prices (wine, bruschetta, salad for $20 or something like that) keep everyone coming back. My fave bruschetta is their proscuitto one, just get 4 of those and you'll be good. What I don't like is that it's hard to get seating and there is a bit of an attitude with the staff, which is rare for Phoenix. Oh, and well after all, you're still eating bruschetta, one of the few things I can actually make myself at home."}
{"text":"Every time I come to Phoenix, I love coming to this hipster, old post office-converted wine cafe. I grew up in the area and the building is a post office my parents use to go to, so it's got a nostalgic feel for my family. We love the $5 glasses of wine until 5 p.m. and I usually get a half sandwich/salad combo. The chicken and mozzarella on focaccia is my fave, along with the mixed green salad with candied pecans and pears. Only issue of note is that it can be a bit noisy due to acoustics and luckily they kept the music to a lower volume than the past couple of times I have been there."}
{"text":"I don't know why it took me so long to get here, but it was truly one of the best meals I've had in recent memory.  Shared the bruschetta with my bestie, then we each got the half sandwich and salad - I absolutely can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I will say I love the ambiance, but the quality of food and service has gone way down hill. I still go with friends when they want to, but not by choice anymore."}
{"text":"Last night I had a friend call that was at the end of her week, her rope and needed simplicity (I never would have guessed that being called simple was a compliment).  I mentioned a few places like the Vig, El Chorro, even Tee Pee for a few libations.  She texted back that simplicity was the goal and wine was needed.  Postino, here we come.  Only a minute walk from home (had to through that in!) and never a need to find parking!

Waited only 5-10 minutes for a table.  Miles is always quick with water and olives for starting off.  We ordered the bruschetta, of course (Brie & Apples 2x, Prosciutto/Fig, Salmon.)  She was craving a spanish tempranillo and I settled on a zinfandel.  Talking, eating, drinking, lounging ensued...  Then, the phone starts ringing, a few different calls lining up the weekend, climbing etc.  Dhargya called and he mentioned that he and friend were heading to Postino Central, a quick re-direct and they were on the way here.  Wouldn't you rather join good friends?

They arrived and of course Postino staff is very accommodating.  Chairs were brought over immediately, wine and champagne ordered quickly.  Another great evening with great friends at the best Wine Bar in Phoenix! 

Try the happy hour special one day soon and avoid waiting for a table or attempting to find parking, 11am-5pm $5 wine glasses.  Perfect place for catching up with friends at 3pm in the afternoon."}
{"text":"Wow, looks like this makes review #700 for Postino's! I'm sure by now you all have heard of the great Monday night deal which includes a bottle of wine and their yummy bruschetta, and it doesn't really matter what kind of bruschetta you get, because its all delicious so they are all good choices. Other than the good monday night deal, this is simply just an overall cool little quaint spot to spend a couple hours, especially great for a date. It's dark, and intimate, nice baby-making music playing in the background... 

Not too many drawbacks I can think of other than parking being limited, and since it is a fairly small location, it can get crowded quick. Oh, and I must confess I did find it just a smidgen on the hipster side, but not enough to keep me away thats for sure."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!   It is so small and dark and quaint!!!  Huge wine selection...and that bruschetta ......Yum!

I didn't really need to add my review because there are so many and most agree that is place is great.

My favorite thing about Postino is on Mon and Tue nights .....you can buy a bottle of wine and a board of bruschetta for $20 ..plenty for two!

Parking can be hard around here...but they offer valet for $3.."}
{"text":"I would give this 3.5 stars.  good value, nice service, nice indoor/outdoor space.  Food is not as sophisticated as the menu might suggest.  Wines are good, not amazing.  My husband & i were in phoenix from DC & came here based on strong yelper recommendations.  We had a good time, but we've been to yummier wine bars."}
{"text":"The best bruschetta ever.
So many delicious  flavor combinations.
Make a meal of it.
Highly recommended.."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is lovely, friendly staff, excellent food! We are Italian and still loved the food that it's pretty authentic!"}
{"text":"Postino's.  I've been to this location for couple of happy hours and recently been here for lunch.  They are known for their variety of bruschetta boards, and selection of wines.  It's a good place to stop by for a good bite to eat, but really nothing on the menu that is really hearty or satisfying.  Great place for lunch or someplace to stop by and snack on some stuff.  They have decent meat and cheese boards.

I would recommend, but not for a dinner place.  There are several locations.  I have been here, Kierland, and the one in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Went during lunch hours. Quiet and such a relaxing atmosphere with great service. The food was amazing."}
{"text":"Great date spot. We had the bruschetta and cheese with wine. It's a busy place but you're not easily distracted from who you're with. Staff is helpful with suggesting wines and it's $5 for a glass between 11a-5p. Not a bad deal."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place-- the only issue, since it is an open venue, is that there are flies all over, and they are annoying as heck.

BUT that does not stop me from giving this place 5 stars because it deserves is based on their bruschetta alone.

The BF and I go here and share the bruschetta and a panini, and it is WAY filling. Sharing a bottle of wine is also a good time.

Parking is always awful, and I recommend reservations whenever possible because it can get packed.

My two fav bruschette are the salmon and the roasted red pepper with goat cheest. SO good!!!"}
{"text":"Ive been here several times with my friends & family; but also recently planned my birthday celebration here. Postino was fabulous at getting me in for my reservations for my party of 10, they sat me outside on the couch like I had requested, and the service was awesome. I will definitely continue to go here & recommend it to friends!"}
{"text":"I didn't think I could love anyplace as much as Postino Central... but I stand corrected.  After finally making it to the Arcadia location, I must say that I loved it equally, but differently.  

Arcadia seemed a little more comfortable with a relaxed vibe.   The perfect spot to have a casual chat and some noshes, without having to get all done up or break the bank.  

My favorites are still: bruschetta board (especially prosciutto with fig & mascarpone), mixed greens salad, and the salted caramel sundae - all are perfect for sharing!

the parking situation is a bit of a nightmare.  The valet is free, but only if you are going to LGO... So as a Postino's patron, you will need to pay $3 for this service.  you might be better off in the free parking across the street near the Arcadia Room.

TIP - Be sure to sign up for their email list for birthday & anniversary specials!"}
{"text":"Postino's is a great date restaurant. Especially on Mondays and Tuesdays when they have their $20 bruschetta and bottle of wine special. You can choose any bottle of wine off of their fairly long list of wines and get a delicious board of bruschetta for only $20. Major win. The proscuitto and fig is my absolute favorite, followed by the artichoke, brie and apple, and salmon and capers. The restaurant has a great interior and patio with a huge wall glass garage door that opens up to connect the interior to the exterior when the weather is nice. If you join their mailing list, you get a free bruschetta board on your birthday and the restaurant's birthday. I also love their sea salt caramel sunday - it's the most delicious dessert ever. You have to try this place. It's just great."}
{"text":"the salami and pesto bruschetta is THE BEST! wash it down with some sangria and your tummy will be cured of the rumblies."}

Love the bruschetta.
Use the valet parking or else you'll have a heck of a time finding a parking spot.

{"text":"What a great, casual brunch spot. The country toast was unreal...very rich and savory. My wife raved about her farm scramble and white peach bellini. 

Great service and food at a great price. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went on a Tuesday night for the $20 wine and bruschetta deal. We waited about 45 minutes but ended up with a lovely and romantic table outside. We ordered a bottle of Albarino and a selection of bruschetta. They are not reinventing the wheel or anything but, what they are doing, they are doing it very well. Service was friendly too which only added to the overall experience."}

{"text":"I visited this Positino location about 3 months ago and, having also been to the Kierland location I was reminded of it and thought I'd add my two-cents.  Searching for a spot for lunch while tooling around town I stopped in and found this nice little spot.  There is a fairly well appointed wine selection here as well as a good assortment of food.  The Turkey panini was quite tasty, consisting of smoked turkey, provolone, tomato, fresh greens and house-made pesto. Service was friendly and reasonably quick.  The general atmosphere of Postino Arcadia is one of relaxation with friends on a leisurely Sunday morning, getting out and just enjoying a bite with friends. I generally prefer the Kierland location simply for the patio area, but whenever in the downtown area, this is an ideal spot for an outing."}
{"text":"I have not located a better place to drink wine and enjoy bruschetta anywhere else in the world.  The food and wine selection are fantastic and the staff keep if flowing!!!"}
{"text":"This food was AMAZING!!! I had the Brussels sprout salad, pesto and smoked salmon bruschetta, and the goat cheese and jam bruschetta. I didn't want the meal to end!!!"}
{"text":"Great food.  Great atmosphere.

We got an Olive Appetizer, a Cheese Plate, and Bruschetta (Brie & Apples with Fig Spread, Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone, Tomato Jam & Fresh Sheeps Milk Cheese, and Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese)

I got the \"Nine Iron\"
Hickory smoked bacon layered with grilled chicken, fresh burrata
mozzarella, lettuce, beefsteak tomato and dijonnaise

My wife and her friend split the Vegetarian
Grilled asparagus, roasted artichokes, red onion, vine ripe
tomatoes, goat cheese and house made pesto

And, of course, a bottle of wine.  We rolled out of there STUFFED to the gills!

We will be going back again soon!

There is one problem...if you don't like to give your car to a valet, then you have to walk...far.  On the good side, it's only $3 for valet."}
{"text":"Yum! and more Yum!  We went for dinner and got really lucky that we didn't have to wait. The bruschetta is wonderful and they have a great wine selection.  Just thinking about how good everything was makes my mouth water and I want to go back."}
{"text":"I had a great time here in this post office converted to neighborhood restaurant.  Note to namers:  You could probably drop the Arcadio in the name because everything around is Aracdia this, Arcadia that.  Kind of like Florida where it is pelican or palm or sunshine whatever.  We get it.

Anyway, there was good,  live music somethere over there in the corner.  Servers were peppy and fun and informed,  The menu was largely small plates for small budgets and small appetites, which seem to fit in this hip, gentrifying neighborhood.

Organic and fresh all the way.  We had a choice of bruschetta and it was terrific.  Especially the fig and goat cheese with sauteed onion.

Decor is eclectic.  They kept the frame of the former federal post office, complete with delivery bay door framing, and put the required exposed ducts in the ceiling.  The wall next to where we sat at high topped tables was papered with a humorous, Brooklyn toile. 

Parking is really limited, so expect to cruise the side streets for a space."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!  My sister jokes that the only reason she comes to visit me in Arizona is for Postino's!"}
{"text":"We've always enjoyed our time at Postinos.  The best sangria I have had, unfortunately it is only served on Sundays.  Great place for light fare.  We've been to both locations and have always had a wonderful time."}
{"text":"Had my second visit to Postino Winecafe the other night. Lets break it down. 

The food? 5 stars - Well I've only had the bruschetta, let me tell you this, Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios, awesome. Trust me on this one. We also ordered the Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone which is equally amazing. Don't waste your time with the White Bean with Tomatoes. 

The parking? 1 Star - Why so much Valet and so little self park? I ended up hobbling (my cheap butt) down the street, two blocks, in heels to meet my friend inside. No bueno. 

Regardless, I'll be back. Again and again. Great service, fun atmosphere and the best bruschetta in town."}
{"text":"This is the 3rd location I've been to, and it's just as good!

Same cute, cozy atmosphere with a friendly staff.
I feel like this one has a bigger space than the one on Central though, but I'm not certain.

The board and bottle deal is amazing. The end. Any of the locations are a must-go!"}
{"text":"This is my 2nd review because I love this place sooooooooooo much...Everyone should go here!!! It is one if the best places in phoenix!! The atmosphere is beautiful especially at night! Im so lucky b/c i can just walk here and i do ALL THE TIME!!!  The greatest deal is the board and bottle night on monday and tuesday nights starting at 8 pm...the wine selection is quality...the selection isnt as large but all the wines are fabulous!! You can also buy wine and take it home...the food is just as fabulous...i love the bruschetta prosciutto and fig, brie and apple, ricotta pistachio and date, artichoke spread and the one with tomato bacon and i forgot the cheese...those are the ones i love but i have no doubt the others are great too!! The soups are so warm and delicious i love them on cold dzys and its great if you get a half panini and u can dip your sandwich in it and it makes both the panini and souo that much better...they have paninis for everyone!! The desserts are fabulous my favorite is the salted caramel sundae...i like the caramel ontop of their chocolate cake and ice cream its amazing...of course leave it up to me to love two desserts and combine them...or if you want a good drink other then wine try their bellinis and mimosas...they are delicious at anytime of the day hahaha...just dnt drink too many and drive have someobe get you a cab...
I love this place so much and cannot tell more ppl enough about this place!!! So come here and enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"I don't know how I've never reviewed Postino before! It's definitely my go to for date night or girls night. They have great specials including the infamous $20 bottle & board deal on Mondays and Tuesdays after 8pm. If you can make it for lunch or early happy hour they also offer $5 glasses of wine until 5pm. 

My favorite bruschetta toppings are the Brie, apple + fig, and the goat cheese + roasted red pepper. The smoked salmon pesto is worth noting as well. When I'm in the mood for something lighter I usually go for the mixed greens salad with pear, candied nuts, Gorgonzola and a light vinaigrette. 

The only reason I docked a star is because I'm not a fan of the parking situation. It's extremely limited. And while they have valet, I wish there was a way to offer more (free) parking."}
{"text":"Everything was amazing. We got the bruschetta: you get to pick for different kinds and a panini to share. We got the iron and it is giant and delicious. More than enough food for the two of us. The wine is great. We went for happy hour $5 a glass so we just got a bottle for $20 - I'll be back!"}
{"text":"My sisters-in-law decided to take me for quick dinner while I was visiting town. The ambiance was relaxing and different, I enjoyed the decor. The two who took care of us were professional and helpful. We ordered different bruschetta to share and they were all delicious. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"They're not opening multiple locations for nothing! Come here for their $20 bottle of wine and bruschetta deals on Mondays/Tuesday's after 8pm! Otherwise, I find dining here on the pricey side. Nevertheless, their bruschettas are amazing. My faves: prosciutto with figs and mascarpone and the white bean with chopped tomatoes!"}
{"text":"This is the kind of restaurant every other restaurant should visit and take thorough notes on \"How to do it Right\". Seriously, this places rules.

The service was super friendly and not in a fake, cheesy, over the top way. The people are real and just as hipster/classy as the establishment. The music, AMAZING. Nothing better than great jams while enjoying yummy food with good company. Everything from Tegan and Sara, Interpol and Broken Bells to Manchester Orchestra. My kinda jams.

The food gets its own category because holy miss moly, this stuff is good. We ordered their bruschetta appetizer where you choose 4 different types of 11 different bruschetta creations they offer. We went with 1-Brie and Apples with Fig Spread, 2-Ricotta with Dates and Pistachio's, 3-White Bean with Chopped Tomato and 4-Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese. FOODGASM. When we ordered this, we were under the impression we were only geting 1 piece of each type of bruschetta that we chose and when it arrived at our table we were pleasantly surprised to see we actually get 4 pieces of each flavor. Lots of food!! Great price point for what you get. Presentation: Rocks, Flavor: Unreal, Price Point: Totally worth it. Because we originally thought the bruschetta was going to be a \"side\" we also ordered the Vegetarian panini with a side Mixed Green salad which was also super delicious. Lets just say we were super full.

The atmosphere here is laid back and beautiful. If you want to dazzle your friends from out of town or take some one on a first date, you can't go wrong with Postino Arcadia."}
{"text":"My favorite of all the Postino locations. The service is always top-notch and the patio makes it possible to believe you're not in the desert. My only suggestion for improvement: make that amazing Roasted Red Pepper Gouda soup a daily offering. Truly the best soup ever."}
{"text":"Great for any occasion. The salty sundae is unusual and fantastic.  The bruschetta addictive."}
{"text":"Absolutely Outstanding!!!

The service was top notch..... Friendly and very welcoming. 

Great Atmosphere. Definitely an upscale place for adults. 

I will return here on each trip to Phoenix and a must do for food whether on business or pleasure travel in the Biltmore area of PHX!"}
{"text":"Not so much of a wine person, but the company with friends and food was just right."}
{"text":"Pretty awesome service! Excellent food and great music!"}
{"text":"Seeing as how I live within walking distance, Postino is absolutely one of my local staples. The service is always great, the food is excellent and the wine list is constantly rotating. The overall atmosphere is always inviting and honestly, I can't say enough great things about this place. Whenever I have someone visiting, this is always on my list of places to go. 

It's hard to provide a review of a specific time there since I go often but that should speak volumes since nobody would go back to a place over and over again if it weren't great!"}
{"text":"Went last evening for the first time. This is a wonderful place! We had wine, shared bruschetta and dessert. Service was impeccable. The bruschetta had fresh ingredients and very tasty and the creme brûlée was delicious. Our server was attentive. Will defiantly go back!"}
{"text":"This is a nice little gem that sure has not gone unnoticed. When I came (no reservations) I had about a 20 minute wait for a table of two - which I didn't mind and took this time to order from the bar. The bartender was friendly and quick. With a drink in hand, it was a pleasure to check out the wines and the milieu of this place of business. It's quite nice, it is however not very big and it can get quite loud in here. Not too loud for a simple conversation, but loud enough for me to take notice.

Once seated the service was great. Our server was a knowledgeable and energetic gentleman that gladly helped out in any decision making regarding the menu. I tried their beer selection as well as had a cheese tray. Note: For being a wine place, they sure do take pride in their beer selection - however I must say that I was not impressed by their cheese. They seem to take pride in their cheese diversity, but I was simply not impressed.

The service was great, the ambiance was relaxing, and the patrons were nice.. I truly enjoyed my visit and will be returning to this establishment. It wasn't expensive, but it isn't cheap nor should it be. (But they have unbelievable early weekdays specials) I give this place a 4, it has 5 potential - but then they have to step up the food a notch, and by food I mean cheese."}
{"text":"I love Postinos!!!  My only complaint was that it was to far a drive but have just heard you are coming out to Gilbert!!  Very very excited!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the bruschetta- it's nice to pick 4 different types for $15, and each piece is cut into 4 pieces. Great for sharing! We had the 1) Apple, fig and cheese 2) salmon pesto 3) artichoke 4) mozzarella tomato basil. All of them were delicious!

I had a glass of Malbec. It was good but at $9 a glass I could buy a bottle around that price for that quality. It didn't feel worth it to me. 

The service wasn't that great despite there being only a handful of other occupied tables."}
{"text":"This is an awesome place to go with friends or a date! Made me feel like I wasn't in  Arizona anymore. The vibe is super hip and classy. A group of my friends and I went on a Monday evening and loaded up on their $20 bruschetta and wine deal. The bruschetta was the best I've ever had! Plan to go back for brunch!"}
{"text":"As a wine and cheese lover, I was in Heaven! You can order a wine on menu or peruse their bottles for sale and open one at your table. My friend ordered the bruschetta and I ordered the cheese plate to start, or so we thought. They brought out a bountiful display that was more than enough for dinner and we did not need to order anything more. The bruschetta portions were much bigger than what I'm used to. Each one was basically an open faced sandwich. I can't stand when a cheese plate comes out with barely two bites of each cheese. Thankfully, that is not Postino's style. Their s*** was on point, to put it bluntly. 

Had I not been in town for business I probably would have cracked another bottle and hung out long enough to be hungry for more dishes. Next time!"}
{"text":"The service here is always above par! I have been to the other Postino locations and this is by far my favorite. The wait is never too long and the service is tentative and courteous. The food is so satisfying and consistent with every visit. I go almost weekly to this location but do visit the others periodically and it further confirms my belief that the service at the Arcadia location is superior. The staff is friendly. I love the patio and it is never too loud to have a great conversation! Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Just go get the bruschetta and the pub platter.

That's all that really needs to be said."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place in Phoenix!!! The vibe reminds me of San Diego, CA- and who doesn't love San Diego?!? Really!! :) My favorite thing to order is the Mixed greens salad and a board of assorted bruschetta."}
{"text":"This place will not disappoint. I got the bruscetta (you choose four) and all of them were delicious. Do yourself a favor and throw in the tomato jam option. It's actually sweet and provides a nice contrast to many of the other savory options. My husband got the B.E.L.T. panini and we both agreed it it needed a bit crustier bread and some melty, stringy cheese. The service is super friendly and non-pretentious, which is a pleasant surprise considering the hipster vibe... I usually expect a too-cool-for-school feeling from establishments with lots of beards and flannel. Overall, it was delicious and fun! Give her a go!!"}
{"text":"Perhaps the best way to re-use an old post office building, make a cozy wine bar in the middle of a trendy part of town and serve a great selection of wine as well as a unique menu of assorted bruschetta.  The staff was friendly, accommodating, and extremely helpful in choosing a nice crisp Sauvignon Blanc. This is the sort of quaint bar all neighborhoods should have.  Unfortunately, it is not in my neighborhood, thus the envy I have right now for my friends out there."}
{"text":"OMG OMG! We got to finally come here and let me tell you they have a customer for life! I ordered the bruschetta plate (warm artichoke spread and tomato jam with sheeps milk cheese were like heaven in my mouth) the tomato jam tastes like Christmas! Haha! My husband got the BLT panini and I got cheddar potato soup, all of which were amazing too! The service was amazing! This place really has it together. The only thing I wish they had was a couple higher dollar wines. The wines they have are fair. I would like to see a Justin or Duckhorn on their menu for those that want some extraordinary wine! But of course that will not stop me from going back! My mouth is watering thinking about the next time!"}
{"text":"I was a regular at this place for many years but the service and foot quality has gone WAY down hill.  I recently found a BUG in my food and management was very nonchalant and not accommodating whatsoever.  I will NOT be back."}
{"text":"I totally heart this place. The food is great - for a wine bar. You can actually eat dinner, and leave not feeling like you filled up on cheese and olives the whole time. Plus the wait staff is great.  You will have to wait on a Saturday/Friday night - but who is in a  rush then anyway? It reminds me of a neighborhood place in San Fran...a must-go in Phoenix."}
{"text":"girls night out, birthday dinners, dates, parents in town - this is the place to go! particularly on a monday or tuesday -- UM HELLO!! $20 for 4 different kinds of bruschetta and a bottle of wine!!! ive tried all of the bruschetta, all so yummy, but my favorite will always be the prosciutto and fig! word to the wise, get here EARLY on monday or tuesday, because everyone in the valley knows about this special and takes full advantage of it"}
{"text":"I live across the street and frequent postinos, lgo and Ingo, all of which I like a lot. I am also a manager at a restaurant a couple streets over. I did find my service a little odd tonight, given that our server, Jenna, told us we could not split our check when we were ready to pay. My friend also manages a local bar, and we have both used all of the common POS systems, so I'm unsure how us splitting a check was not possible. Her reaction was also very bothered and actually somewhat rude. To accommodate her, I said I would just pay the bill with my card so she didn't have to split anything. But I think the hospitality is supposed to go the other way around. Just saying:)"}
{"text":"CIAO! =)  

Beautiful bruschettas. 
Huge yummy paninis, decadent desserts, and great service....ah.. perfecto! =) Add in a dash of dim lights, open air, and casual jazz music and you have romance in the making! 

Postino reminds me of tapas...but Italian styled. They only serve a few items on their menu ... a few appetizers, salads, soups, bruschetta, paninis, and desserts. 

BRUSCHETTA is what they're known for... I agree that they are quite expensive $13 for 4 pieces of large varied bruschetta but they use some good stuff!

I ordered :
- Brie & Apples with Fig Spread -- FAVORITE! crisp tart apple contrasted with a light sweet spread, soft brie and toasty baguette. drizzled with a bit of sweetness for a perfect touch. 

- Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone -- who knew I liked fig so much??? Delicious. Loved the light olive oil drizzle too. I appreciated that the prosciutto wasn't salty. 

- Salami with Pesto -- not as unique , but still tasted great 
- Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato & Basil -- -mm.. fresh~! My sister ate almost all of these...=9

hubby + sister ordered paninis ... didn't really try those but they tasted fine. didn't really leave a huge impression cuz I was concentrating on my bruschettas. my bro-in-law got a customized salad w. soup. good portions!!! The people on our next table over ordered a cheese board ... looked delicious. I'll have to order that next time I'm around!

Oh ...and wine! $5 for wine before 5pm on Sunday! 
There is plenty of parking in their lot! =)"}
{"text":"Can I just say \"Bella Postino\"  yummm."}
{"text":"I LOVE it here! You can't beat the bruschetta combos they offer and I love their Sangria Sundays. Yes, it is always crowded- but for obvious reasons. Service is always great and I have had nothing less than an amazing meal here every time!"}
{"text":"This is the ideal place to go for a relaxing glass of wine & some food without the stuffiness. Great wine, great food, great atmosphere & great staff. What else is could you want ?! :)"}
{"text":"Postino, you are breaking my heart. I wanted to spend all afternoon on your porch yesterday but the music you play is so distracting and inappropriate that I had to leave early. None of your wait staff is able to change it.... really disappointing. Please change the music to something more appropriate and relaxing."}
{"text":"I have never been to a restaurant  that specializes is bruchetta.  This was a treat do not sleep on it.  The salmon and capers with pesto was my fav.  Happy hour wine 5 bucks added bonus. Special treat after a spa day.  Loved it"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness,  I love this place, but must admit that it can be frustrating trying to get a seat.  It is well worth the wait.

A favorite thing for me is that you get a chance to try some awesome wines, and if you like you can buy a bottle or two while you are there."}
{"text":"Went again last night - Can't say a bad thing about it. Bravo Postino!

Also - valet is only $3... totally worth it."}
{"text":"I loved the food. We had a table full of cheeses, olives, cured meats, and bruschetta. The wine list was fit to please. I'm not a wine person and I enjoyed my beer selection as well. The service was cheerful and helpful. The atmosphere was classy and fun. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"So good! i ordered the bruschetta (delicious) and a panini! both were great! I also enjoyed their famous amazingly good moscato de asti !"}
{"text":"Bruschetta is awesome and the nine iron sandwich is delicious. One of my favorite places to eat in Arcadia."}
{"text":"Wow, I love this place on Sundays! The patio and the music make me feel like I'm on a beach in Cali! Great mental escape. 

The sangria (3-stars) was not the best I have had but was still good. The bruschetta (5-stars) was really unique and really good. I also had a sandwich and soup. Both were about 4-star quality. Our server was AWESOME! 5-Stars to him! He was hilarious. I don't think he was trying to be funny but he just was. Great personality and he seemed to really like his job. The live music....5 STARS! The musician was talented and he played for about 2 hours. From Bob Marley, Jack Johnson, to Dire Straits. All summer type music, and all very well executed. 

The place was busy so it did take a while to get food, but I was relaxed, had my sangria, and had good music so all was right in the world:) The parking could be a problem but I got lucky and was able to pull right in. The bathrooms are unisex....eeeewh....but clean. As long as they remain clean I will keep my rating at 5 stars, the minute that changes....it will be 4 stars."}
{"text":"But also! The tomato jam and fresh sheep's milk bruschetta is the best thing in the world. I would like a bruschetta board filled with that, ev.er.y. day.
And, the service is very friendly and attentive whenever I go in, even if it's a busy time of day. Much appreciated."}
{"text":"I LOVE TO EAT... I tried and devowered every type of bruschetta they had and it was awesome. great prices and the Moscato wine to wash it all down. great service too. perfect date night. thanks everbody!"}
{"text":"I really miss this hot spot for lunch. You can not lose here. Really...

My fav would be the bruschetta. Such a hearty, italian treat served ontop of a wooden cutting board. The cheese boards are brilliant for snacking and socializing. 

The building is an old post office. How unique!"}
{"text":"Great food and drink! Great atmosphere! To die for Bruschetta and fantastic specials throughout the week. I only wish the restaurant was bigger to accommodate more people as it is not uncommon to have to wait quite a while for a table and there is really no where to sit or really even stand while you wait. However, the staff is great at getting you a drink while you wait either at the bar or if you're lucky enough to get a spot at one of their standing room only tables."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Phoenix, that I don't frequent nearly enough.  Great selection of wines by the glass.  The atmosphere is sexy, industrial pseudo-warehouse, I-don't-think-I'm-in-Phoenix type lounge.  I think on Tuesdays they have a live DJ in the mix.  

It's more of a wine bar than a restaurant and the menu reflects that - with the heaviest of items being their paninis.  The autostrada panini comes loaded with several meats (soppresatta and prosciutto among them) and cheeses and is amazing.

UPDATE - Great service just recently.  A bit of a wait, but forgot about it because of the great servers - Michelle I think, was one of them.  Just had a Tobin syrah that was incredible..."}
{"text":"Having a late night dinner last night at Postinos with two friends passing through town once again confirmed my love for this quaint wine cafe.  Do not pass up the bruchetta.  You can mix it up by choosing four over sized pieces for $12.  I love the arugula/buratta and mozz/basil/tomato but fig and cheese is the winner!  All sans meat but positive feedback on the meat selections.  We shared a generously plated cheese board ($14) and the pub board consisting of fresh pretzel-like bread, spicy nuts, cheese bits and a tasty mustard.  My friend also like their broccoli cheese soup.  I've had the vegetarian panini in the past which I enjoyed although the humus was a little overpowering and messy. I'd get it on the side next time. The salad served with it is phenomenal. 

The wait staff at both locations are great.  I felt bad for walking in 15 minutes before closing last night but I really, really wanted my friends to eat there.  We were greeted with a friendly face and our waiter was very attentive and conversational despite the time. We weren't rushed and were able to enjoy catching up over a bottle of wine and tasty meal on a perfect for patio evening. 

Downside is parking. The place was bare last night so that wasn't a problem. Friday/Saturday night is going to be a fight.  Also, they will not take reservations of less than six and WILL NOT seat you until your whole party is available.  Not so good for the group I usually go with but we're all learning to be more timely!  It can be a long wait but worth it!"}
{"text":"The food, service and atmosphere were fantastic. I'm visiting a friend and she's definitely planning to go back. We had a bruschetta sampler, our favorite's being the roasted peppers and goat cheese as well as the fig, pistachio and ricotta. The salad selection was great and we also had that with the mixed greens, candied walnuts and Gorgonzola. The open air aspect made for a peaceful environment and as I told my friend, you could easily transport this restaurant right into the meatpacking district in NYC...and it would be a hit."}
{"text":"Grea food and wine.  Lovely atmosphere.  A bit overpriced and entirely too loud, but that's the price for popularity!  
  My largest complaint would be that the service is a bit slow, and the servers seem incredibly overworked.  They should be paid more as without them the experience isn't worth showing up for."}
{"text":"I'v worked for Postino for about 3 years and it is the greatest place ever! If you haven't been, you're missing out.

{"text":"The things I like best about this place are their mini charcuterie board offerings.  This is one of my fav ways to eat and sip on a beautiful glass of wine, simultaneously.  So simple, yet casually elegant.  

Good prices.  Cool ambience.  Decent service."}
{"text":"Perfect date spot. Cute wine bar with tasty menu, good wine list and delightful ambiance. Enclosed alfresco patio out front is fantastic.

Bruschetta is  tasty and ranges from light to heavy, something for everyone. Would order all the below again:

Smoked salmon / pesto - salmon was fresh and delicious. Just a smidge of pesto, not smeared
Brie & apple w/fig spread - simple but refreshing. Thinly sliced Granny Smith on brie. Fig spread is jammy and adds the perfect depth.
Burrata, bacon, arugula, tomatoes - the burrata was outstanding. would've preferred this w/o the bacon, which somewhat overpowered this bruschetta
Prosciutto, figs, mascarpone - brilliant combination

The Pub Board is a great concept and cleverly presented - sliced soft pretzels, cornichons, aged cheddar (delish), giant corn nuts (so fun!) - just lacking stone ground mustard for the pretzels! Maybe they could add this...

Loved our server - pleasant and professional."}
{"text":"Exquisite

Fine wine and tasty appetizers 

Great place for evening get together with friends or a table for two with a special someone!

Highly recommended for people who enjoy the finer things in life."}
{"text":"Everything about this winebar makes me happy. The former postal location with it's huge windows and open space.It's \"just off the beaten path\" feel-- just a couple streets away from the main streets Camelback and Indian School, yet feels so far away. The fact that it's in Milano's mega-plaza next to LGO and other great places...it just all works for me. 

The wine is mostly good, although the selections could use a little more of an updating, but the prices are definitely right. Come before 5pm and all glasses of wine are only $5. Boyfriend and I have spent countless of lazy weekends lazing around this place with wine and their wonderful, orgasmic, bruschetta. The service is good and the people are friendly. The sandwiches are okay, but don't stand a chance next to the bruschetta and I wasn't a fan of the soup at all. 

Parking can be tough at times, but it's not impossible. Truly, a neighborhood gem not to be missed. 

Bruschetta favorites: 
-Prosciutto,fig, and marscapone (which I have successfully replicated at -home!)
-Roasted pepper and goat cheese
-Smoked salmon, cream cheese, caper
-Salami, pesto"}
{"text":"BEST. BRUSCHETTA. EVER. 

I now live in Chicago and thought it would be easy to find a good place for bruschetta and wine and NO SUCH LUCK. 

Postino is the BEST. I am flying back to Arizona next weekend to get some. Delicious.

YUM."}
{"text":"Best nights to go to Postino's are Mondays and Tuesdays.  They offer $20 deals where you get 4 slices of bruschetta out of the 12 that they offer and one whole bottle of the house wine.  Each bruschetta slice is probably the size of maybe your hand with your fingers outstretched -- if you're a petite girl  :) ...  They then cut each slice into 4's.  Perfect for sharing!

We went on a Monday night after 8PM and ordered 2 bottles of wine, the 2 orders of the bruschetta (which were 8 slices for those that can't count), and a bowl of olives.  The total came out to about $50...that's a little over $13/person w/o tip!!  AWESOME!!    PLUS, they have complementary valet parking. 

Everything was just fantastic, I've never had fig before and they made my experience there quite memorable.  I definitely recommend you come in, regardless if it's for their $20 deals on Mon/Tues or not.  They've got GREAT food and I WILL be back."}
{"text":"Oh heck yes.  I really like Postino.  The atmosphere is laid back (the dress ranged from t-shirts and shorts to sun dresses and collared shirts) the wines are good and the food is really good.  I do wish the wine list was more extensive though, especially for a wine bar.  The service is really friendly and attentive, although my husband didn't really go for the wine our server suggested to him.   The bruschetta is fantastic and the cheese plate is ginormous.  Its good to try to get there a little early (think 4pm or earlier) because it does filly up and the parking lot is tiny.  (Or you can fork over the $3 for valet)   Seriously though, I think it must be the tiniest parking lot in Arizona, its like something you'd find in Boston!\

Update:  I chose to have my birthday dinner at Postino because I wanted something casual and fun.  Postino fits the bill.  I called and made a reservation for 12 which was no problem.  (They did take my credit card information which I am totally used to doing for large groups)  We arrived and were seated promptly with great service throughout the night.

I was told when I made the reservation that if I wanted to bring in cake there would be a cutting charge but I could bring in something from Tammie Coe with no extra charge.  I purchased cupcakes and completely forgot about them until we were at Merc Bar later that night!  I called Postino and they were nice enough to hold them for me (again- they had held them from when Tammie Coe closed that afternoon until our reservation)  and I was able to get them the next day.  Cupcakes for breakfast!

I've eaten here several times now and I'm never dissapointed....not in the bruschetta or the salads.  One day I'll try a sandwich I'm sure....if only the bruschetta wasn't so yummy!"}
{"text":"The best local wine pub if you're in the Arcadia/Biltmore area - seriously. Great paninis and bruschetta and of course ! don't forget the Red Wine ! yum try the Mozzerella and Chicken sandwich or the roasted red pepper w/ goat cheese on bread :)"}
{"text":"This is one of three locations to enjoy bruchettas, pressed panini, and salads. I like to order the half salad and half sandwich. Italian picnic and raspberry chicken salads are my favorites. Chicken & mozzarella and the nine iron panini are my 2 faves.  You can't go wrong with any of the Bruschetta choices such as warm artichoke spread, Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone, Smoked Salmon with Pesto, Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomato. Come early to beat the rush hour of happy hour or you will be forced to wait a while. Come here on Monday and Tuesdays to enjoy the $20 bruchetta board and a bottle of wine! All locations have valet parking."}
{"text":"The word AMAZING should be enough said, but I'll tell you a little more. The cheese plate is delicious. They are always changing the cheese's out with whats seasonal. Keeps it fun and exciting! Now don't even get me started on the bruschetta! My boyfriend and I crave it all the time and could probably eat it seven days a week. Last, if you go there between 11am-5pm any day of the week any wine is $5. What could be a better deal than that?"}
{"text":"I've been to Postino a countless number of times, and have never been disappointed by the food or the service.  The servers are always friendly and helpful, and the food (especially the small sandwiches and bruschetta) is delightful.

If you're thinking about going during happy hour or for dinner, I recommend calling ahead to make a reservation, or expect to wait.  It can get pretty packed."}
{"text":"We started with the butcher's block (literally a wood block FILLED with the most delicious cheeses, olives, hummus, dry aged meats, bread, and heaven) then followed with the bruschetta plate.  We chose 4 different selections, but our favorite was the one with arugula.  We had planned on order a pannini to split and a cup of soup after this, but we were so stuffed we did not get passed the apps!  And for location and clientele (valet parking usually scares us off.... haha!), we were surprised we walked out of there with full, satisfied tummies and a slight buzz for less than $50!  We cannot wait to get a sitter again and check it out.  Right now they have a deal on Monday and Tuesday evening for a bottle of wine and the bruschetta for like $20. Whoa!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Postino Winecafe for about a year now, I am so pleased with my experience every time. From the wine selection, to the bruschettas, serving amount/portions, to the atmosphere (the outdoor setting area is beautiful on Arizona evenings). Every person that I bring to Postino Winecafe is pleased with their experience and even go back without me. They have great specials on Sunday afternoons too! With that said, try it out."}
{"text":"Oh, Postino how I love you so.  During my most recent visit on Labor Day with a fellow Yelping friend of mine, we had quite the memorable experience. Jet, the manager, was very kind, welcoming, and generous. He informed us about the history of the restaurant and recommended others in the area. Truly, he went the extra mile with his positive attitude and engaging conversation. Furthermore, all of the servers we encountered were incredibly hospitable, friendly, and considerate. 

Now, for the food and drink. The menu is simple yet superb: soups, salads, sandwiches, and most popularly bruschetta are the options. My favorite is definitely the Hannah's Field, which is so healthy and delicious! Not to mention $5 glasses of wine before 5pm...talk about a wonderful deal! The dishes are affordable and quite tasty. 

The ambience is casual, artistic, and relaxed despite the very loud music. This is truly a spot where you can relax and enjoy good food and wine. 

I HIGHLY recommend Postino!"}
{"text":"Great lunch place with good food and good service, but not so sure about five stars... I dont give those out that easily.

I ordered the bruschetta plate:
- Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone - delicious!
- Brie & Apples with Fig Spread - delicious though a little sweet
- Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomato - delicious but gets a little soggy
- Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato & Basil - good but the tomato was not very ripe

My sister had the chicken salad, with pecans, apples, gorgonzola and raspberry vinaigrette - she said it was alright. I tried some of her Prosciutto with Brie panini, that comes with fig jam and arugula - that was really really good. Heavy on the prosciutto, light on the fig jam - an excellent balance :)

They also have happy hour drinks 7 days a week -- all wines $5/glass, draft beers $5/pitcher -- worth noting!

Overall I liked the place and the prices were great, but I think my expectations of a soulful renovated historic post office were maybe too high."}
{"text":"Since moving nearby to La Grande Orange, I've lamented the amount of money I've spent at that most tasty place.  Now that I've finally made it to Postino, my lamentations will only grow.  Yeah, it's wonderful.

Carla greeted me at the door, chipper as only a Saturday night can create, and gave me a quick tour upon hearing it was my first time. She handed me off to Maya, who was also supremely patient with my many questions and general ignorance of wine.

Yeah, I'm not a wine snob. I have little patience for sniffing and swirling. I've good wines and bad wines, but I'm fairly convinced anyone talking about the boquet of light oak with a strong raspberry melon finish is making it up or part of a cult.

Didn't matter, though. Maya recommended a fantastic wine, and between her and Carla I sorted out which of their famous bruschetta I was going to try (proscutto + fig, salmon + capers, tomato jam + goat cheese, apple + brie).  

The garage doors were open and the weather was fantastic. Loved the decor, loved the staff, loved the food, and loved the... what's that other stuff they served.., oh yeah, the wine.

(sigh) Between this place and LGO it may be cheaper for me to just move again further away."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this restaurant as cheese, bread, and wine are my favorite food groups, and I have to say, it didn't disappoint.  Thankfully, my friends are similarly like minded and we feasted on bruschetta, cheese plates, and assorted dips.  While not the most balanced of dinners, it was incredibly delicious.  

I plan on coming back here and gorging on cheese the next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Stopped by when they first opened and wasn't very impressed. I'll admit I haven't been back for a second try, but here is the first experience:

It wasn't crowded and service was extremely slow, staff seemed to be more interested in their own conversations than serving guests. Food was okay, nothing fantastic, portions were small and price was large. 

I'm not quite sure what all the hype has been about this place, but I might give it one more try before I totally write it off."}
{"text":"Ive been here a few times for dinner. The atmosphere is great. It is dimly lit making for a more intimate feel. Their wine selection is good and their food is great. I've had the bruschetta board, which is a must try, with my favorite being the roasted peppers with goat cheese as well as their Nine Iron panini on focaccia. The cheese board is also delicious!! Really enjoy coming here, even if it is a little bit of a drive for me."}
{"text":"This is where it all started, my devout love for Postino. I've been coming here so long that I remember when you could still get pizzas brought over from LGO next door. I miss those days!

I mainly go to the Gilbert location since that's where I live, but I still stop by here from time to time. In Gilbert, you can't get wine to go unless the bottle is opened so the Arcadia location is useful for picking up something on the racks to take home. This store is also less busy than Gilbert so I enjoy the peaceful atmosphere at lunchtime.

Postino, thank you for being a friend."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places! Best bruschetta I've ever had, and amazing sandwiches and salads as well. 

Service is also fantastic.  We went for lunch recently and it was quite busy, though honestly we were in no hurry and didn't mind at all.  Regardless, our waiter offered us 2 desserts on the house!  It's nice to see a restaurant go above and beyond for its customers."}
{"text":"I have been a regular customer of Postinos Arcadia for about 2 years.  I initially fell in love w/ the ambiance and wonderful bruschetta but to make it better, it is within walking distance of my home.

Unfortunately I have been disappointed by my last two visits to Postinos.  Most recently I went Tues. evening (5/10/11) at about 6 p.m.  I ordered a Bruschetta and bottle of wine.  The bruschetta came out quickly but tasted stale.  Really, it seemed like it had been assembled hours earlier and sat on the counter waiting for the order.  So sad.  I thought, \"this is mediocre at best\".  The service was ok, but again, pretty mediocre.  

I hate to say it, but it seems like Postinos Arcadia might just be getting comfortable with their reputation and has stopped caring about the quality of food and service they were so well known for.  I want to acknowledge that Tues. evenings come w/ a coupon for a reduced board and bottle of wine after 8 p.m.  I was there at prime dinner hour and felt like I was treated as a customer coming only for the \"Special of the Day\".  I could go just about anywhere in Arcadia and find mediocre bruschetta and service and pay a whole lot less."}
{"text":"Postinos is a fabulous venue if you love wine and bruschetta.

I have been to the Gilbert location and now this one for lunch today. I much prefer the Gilbert locale for the square footage and parking alone. The Gilbert shop is at least double the size of Arcadia, and there is wayyy more parking. Food/service/everything else wise, though, and these 2 are tied for quality.

Lunch was great today. We tried the creme brulee and it was to die for. So yum!

Really, my only complaint is the parking here. I don't like that valet is the ONLY option, especially when I can see nearby spots right in front of the restaurant. Made no sense. There's an overflow lot they directed me to about a block north.  Got to walk off some lunch that way, on the bright side. I still will not be able to let someone valet my car when I could park it myself, walk 3 steps, and then be inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"Always enjoyable. Great bruschetta. Good value. Nice service and agreeable crowd. Only downsides are the limited parking and no liquor license."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants EVER!!  My husband and I came here 2 days before our wedding as our last date as an unmarried couple!  Our go-to meal includes: Bruschetta Board, Brie and Prosciutto Panini, and a Salted Caramel Sundae.  Everything is AMAZING!  It's also not just about the food but about the atmosphere; we love the easy going feel during the day, and the more upscale night crowd!  It's trendy without being pretentious!  We will always be great patrons of this place!"}
{"text":"Great location in Arcadia. Huge windows let in great lighting. Flowers all around the restaurant. Superb wine selection and amazing Bruschetta."}
{"text":"Good ambience & great combination of bruschetta with Malbec. Me and my wife had a perfect dinner.
Can add a bit more main course options, though!!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat in the valley!  I love Postino!  They have THE BEST buscetta in the world.  They have some interesting combinations and they all work very well together.  The service is great!  The vibe is very chill."}
{"text":"DELISH. Atrichoke sandwich is the way to go! (light on the cheese tho!)"}
{"text":"Really good gluten free bread makes the bruschetta menu work for this girl.  Fantastic combinations, small but selective wine list complements the menu. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great place for enjoying good food and drinks after work. Reasonable prices and complimentary valet parking makes this a place we will definitely be coming back to. The combo panini and soup or salad for $10 bucks was excellent. I enjoyed the raspberry chicken salad and roast beef panini."}
{"text":"I met a friend here for lunch. I had been to the Postino restaurant on Central but this was a first for the one in Arcadia. Originally, I was skeptical to go here for lunch because I knew the parking wasn't great. I ended up valeting my car... 


Postino is a great restaurant. The service was great along with the food. The waiters didn't come around too much which is good when your having a conversation with a friend. 

Keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! We came here for a glass of wine on a Friday afternoon.  The place was already hopping at 4PM and the atmosphere was great! We ordered two glasses of the Chateau Bonet, which is a wonderful Savignon Blanc. The wine was a little warm, but they serve it in little carafes so we put them in a cup of ice (problem solved!)

We also shared an appetizer called \"The Plate\" which had a mix of olives, almonds, cheese and meat.  Everything was delicious.

I defintely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere.  Plenty of good food and friendly service.  Parking is at a premium so use the valet!  Try the Butchers Block!"}
{"text":"Best bruschetta in town. Quirky, affordable, delicious wine selections. Perfect location. Postino's is my go to spot for a first date, to catch up with girlfriends, or for a later post-work drink and snack. 

I've never had anything that wasn't delicious there (the food and the wine are excellent). A+ across the board."}
{"text":"For starters, our server was definitely \"too cool\" for us.

That said, the place is a really interesting, urban space with either a social or a cozy vibe depending on which table you get.

The bruschette is what they are known for and it's pretty good, given that it is not your typical diced up tomatoes with olive oil and balsamic. We had one with ricotta and pistachio and dates (big hit), one with tomato jam and goat cheese (yum), one with spinach and artichoke spread (pass), and one with apple and brie (good combo).

Side note: seems like they use grocery store brand bread (like a vienna loaf) and then just put some toppings on it and make a killing. Nothing uber authentic about what's going on here, just to warn you.

It seems to me the rest of the menu is just okay."}
{"text":"Postinos is a great place to go!
They have a great selection of bruschettas..
They also have a great brunch on the weekends. 
Their catering is also great, as my sister used them for my bridal shower. 
Great wine, food, and atmosphere... love it."}
{"text":"Anytime. Excellent food, wine and service.  Good thing we don't live to close or I'd weigh 300 lbs.  Highly recommend.  Adore the bruschetta and pub boards.  Great wine pairings, atmosphere and fun bathrooms!"}
{"text":"I love coming here for happy hour when I'm in town.  $5 glasses of wine between 11 am - 5 pm everyday.  Nice selection of reds/whites to choose from.  They also have delicious paninis and bruschetta.  Their desserts are also really yummy!  Everything is reasonably priced.  The outdoor patio makes the food and wine even more enjoyable."}
{"text":"Our first and not our last visit. A great bottle of wine, soup and dinner! Bethany was the perfect wait staff, patiently walking us through the menu and wine list. A five star evening."}
{"text":"Imagine if you took an Italian deli and dressed it up and put the sandwhiches on menus instead of a chalkboard and provided mood lighting and had a metrosexual waitstaff bring the sandwhiches to your table.  That's essentially Postino in a nutshell.  It's next to the ever trendy La Grande Orange which just adds to its hype.  Seriously, I could start serving twinkies and pbj's  next to La Grande Orange and i would have 91 reviews with 4 stars too.  The food was unspectacular as I felt like I was eating lunch but paying 3 times for it.  The service was average. The waitstaff was not rude but they were not helpful either as we had to constantly remind them to bring items; they took nearly 20 minutes to take our order and you had to ask them for anything extra like water or silverware.  It just seemed like the owner walked into Six lounge and asked some people to be servers; they just seemed as if they had no experience waiting on people. 

Furthermore, it's not a \"winecafe.\"  It's just a cafe. The wine part makes it sound trendier than it is. The wine selection is a joke and there are hardly any \"by the glass\" selections. The servers have no clue about wine and if you ask them a few questions, you will see they do a really good job trying to b.s. you but if you have any knowledge about wine like I do, you enjoy the spectacle of seeing them trying to sound intelligent: \"Er, do you like white or red wine\" 

The food was good but again, why am I paying a lot of money to be served this for dinner. There are several panini Italian lunch delis that i could get this same food at. 

This is a great place for a light meal or a cocktail or a great place for friends to meet at for a quick drink before heading out to the clubs or lounges.  It's also a great place to impress a date (if you are less than 25 years old).  However, Postino should not be viewed as serious fare in regards to dining.  I would say Postino was a nice experience but I certainly wouldn't return unless I was meeting a group of people there."}
{"text":"Wonderful platter of bruschetta and a happy friendly staff.

Only down side for me, is that I personally dislike large crowds and a load atmosphere, and this place will sometimes get that way.  But that means it's got to be good then!

Wine selection is very nice as well."}
{"text":"I LOVE Postino! Best bruschetta ever, and their chicken salad is amazing! I don't think I've ever had anything here I didn't like. Friendly, knowledgeable staff and a great atmosphere for a variety of occasions!"}
{"text":"Love it here for weekend brunch. 
Great food great prices and service is always good."}
{"text":"This place always has a fun vibe and a great patio. Love meeting girlfriends here for wine and bruschetta.  Good service and nice atmosphere, a true staple."}
{"text":"It's a strange menu if, like my Mother, you come for a visit from a small town in the midwest. To us Phoenicians, it's a little bit of wonderful, if not a little bit strange of a menu. The food is wonderful, admittedly, I only eat the brucshetta (I know, I spelled it wrong) now because I LOVE it! There are several toppings to select, and they are all yummy! 
The salads are very flavorful, but I'd rather eat bread with goat cheese and roasted red peppers, or brie and apples, or hot artichoke spread...or...you get the picture.
Double delight: you can walk across the parking lot and enter the back door of La Grand Orange and get fabulous Tammy Coe cakes and cupcakes, as well as big, yummy cookies and a variety of other delights.
Go early or go late, or you won't find a parking place...or a table."}
{"text":"Wine, bruschetta and cheese boards, what else do you need?! Great wine list and the bruschetta options are fantastic! This is a fun place to grab and drink or two with some small plates to share. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"EVERYBODY raves about this place so I finally went with a friend last week.  I wish I hadn't heard so many good things prior to going because I was severely disapointed.  
Service was AWFUL.  We came at 4 pm so we could get in abotu 3 glasses of wine before the $5 wine ended.  WRONG.  It took 30 minutes each time we ordered a glass of wine and I mean 30 minutes from the time we ordered it.  When we went to order the 2nd glass of wine it was 2 minutes after 5 and luckily since we complained we still got it for the $5 price.  The bruschetta also took an excessive amount of time to come and 2 of the cut pieces had fell of somewhere so we got jipped!  Let me say I once was a server for many years.  This place was not that busy and definetly not so busy that it takes 30 minutes to get a glass of wine.

Food was ok.  I didn't think the bruschetta was anything special like all my friends made it seem.  I liked the salmon pesto one, but thats about it.

I know this review sounds mean and since I have heard such great things I am willing to give this place another try.  I will order a panini and hopefully get quicker service.  If things are better I will be happy to revise my review- if not I will put Postino's in my OVERRATED category"}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite places ever! The fig, Brie, prosciutto sandwich is delicious. And you can't go wrong with their bruschetta and wine. If I could I would seriously move within walking distance of postino's."}
{"text":"I love this joint...
Postino has become one of my favorite places to grab a bite.  The bruchetta is probably the best I've had in this area next to Armitage, and the size is amazing for the buck.  Out of 10 or so you can choose 4 (fav's are the pepper and goat cheese, the fig and the seasonal), coming out on huge pieces of foccacia cut into fours so you get to keep taking delicious nibbles of each.  Their wine selection is pretty good too, I've fallen in love with the Acadia white that I cant seem to find anywhere else.  

Though well priced for the most part, you do have to watch your tab - you can leave with a 30 buck tab up to a 150 tab for two people. 

Only negitives I'd say would be the seating, particularly the outside, where they absolutely CRAM you in to the point you might be uncomfortable if you dont like snuggling with your neighbor.  Its great for dates, great place to impress out of towners, and just a great gem of Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday with my wife and some friends. All the photos of the food made me crazy hungry so we could not resist.

Place looks like it could have been an old post office in another lifetime. Inside has been redecorated and there is a really nice patio for you outdoors folks. No need to check your mail here. Just order what looks good and they deliver it right to your table.

Started with the Butcher's Block Starter plate and an ice cold Italian Beer. It was beautiful and tasty at the same time. Decided to go with the famous Bruschetta next. What did we not try is the question. There are so many choices.

Brie & Apple with Fig Spread, Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone, Warm Artichoke Spread, the yummy Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios and a few others that were not so great.

We all enjoyed anything with Figs on it. The plates were very colorful and the quality of the food was very high and fresh. Sounds like a good portion of their products come from right here in the valley. Nice!

Recommend coming here during the day and not at night. The lighting is very dim and we had to use a flashlight app on my phone to see the food and menu. Maybe I'm justing getting too old for the late night thing.

Seen other reviews saying that the best areas to sit are on the patio or right between the inside and outdoor seating area. Not sure how that works when it is a crisp 118 degrees outside. I bet the cheese starts melting rather fast.

Definitely a fun and enjoyable time. The Bruschetta is out of this world and a new favorite of mine. Looking forward to trying out some of the other locations. SALUTE!

4.25 STARS"}
{"text":"Yum. Can't beat the Monday/Tuesday special. Their bruschetta is mind-blowing! Parking is rough, but the complimentary Valet are always friendly. Definitely worth the crowd!"}
{"text":"Another one of those Camelback places where they basically force you to valet park or head a few blocks away and take your chances in the residential neighborhoods, which is of course what I chose. Valet parking ain't for me anywhere. Try building a parking lot Phoenix before you cram your little fancy wine bars, etc into the area. If you don't like the snobby crowd than steer clear of Postino. Luckily, I arrived before 5pm and squeezed out one glass of $5 wine. If your late, prepare for the $12 wine glass fee ripoff rate. Seems to be a place where all they serve is Brushetta at crazy prices again. It's 14 bucks for 4 pieces of toast with various stuff on them. Personally, brushetta will always just be olive oil, tomatoes and basil on grilled toast. Never tried the food because they have no Happy Hour food deals. Wine bar brings out the gay crowd too, not that there is anything wrong with that, but I will stick to sports bars in the future.
    Oh there are no TV sets at all. Had to mention that. NO TV's. NO sports."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Postino for a dinner date during a recent weekend trip to Phoenix. It wasn't quite what we expected--we'd assumed it was the kind of Italian place where you could get a glass of wine and a plate of pasta--but we had a great time.

Our reservation was for eight o'clock on a Saturday night, and the place was busy but comfortable. It felt intimate and not too crowded. The lighting was low, and the space was warm and charming. A great go-to date spot. Service was great. Our waitress was friendly and helpful, and we were well taken care of.

Postino is more a wine bar than a full sit-down restaurant, with reasonably priced bottles and a menu that consists of large format antipasti and paninis. We ordered a bottle of Canto Sur, a red blend of mostly cabernet and carmenere. You can get wines by the glass here, but the bottle prices are only three times the glass prices, putting most of the bottles in the high twenties/low thirties range. We were happy with the wine. We also ordered a few antipasti and tried to order paninis for our dinner when our waitress stopped us--she said what we thought were antipastis would fill us up plenty, and she was absolutely right.

Granted, we were planning to order a pretty big spread of appetizers. We shared the butcher's block, the pub board, and a selection of four bruschetta. Did not realize that each of these boards would be gigantic. Everything was delicious. The butcher's block came with plenty of meat--prosciutto, coppa, salami, and peppered salami--along with goat cheese and white bean hummus. There was crostini, of course, and a huge assortment of great accompaniments--olives, dried cranberries, almonds, asparagus, cherry tomatoes, smoked yellow tomatoes, and three kinds of pickle.The pub board brought another huge spread, this one of MJ's soft pretzels, Scrheiner's chorizo, cornichons, aged cheddar, and giant Spanish corn nuts. It was fun to mix and match everything on these boards, and it was all fantastic. The bruschetta seems to be the main draw of Postino, but I didn't understand why until our selection arrived. We opted to order four of them for $14, and were expecting bruschetta sized like bruschetta. These were more like full-on flatbreads, with the four bruschetta adding up to about a pizza in volume. We had the tomato jam and fresh sheep's milk cheese, the salami with pesto, the prosciutto with figs and mascarpone, and the burrata, bacon, arugula, and tomato. Not a dud in the bunch--loved all the meat, and the tangy cheese with the sweet tomato jam was perfect on its own.

We took great pleasure in our feast of antipasti and wine. We ate with our hands and enjoyed the variety. I'd love to go back to Postino next time I'm in Phoenix. I'd be a regular if I lived in town."}
{"text":"All Phoenicians know Postino and its makers are local celebrities and geniuses. Everything they touch turns to gold. There's nothing they don't do exceptionally well. 

This is the perfect brunch spot, the perfect date spot, the perfect lunch spot... you  name it. Definitely the place you take a visitor from out of town. I am not much of a wine drinker but I have been pleased with everything I have ever tried here.

I have never been here when it's NOT busy so expect a wait. But it's well worth it."}
{"text":"Nice place to have some beer especially before 5 since draft mini pitchers are $5 which gives you 2 pints to 2 1/2 pints all depends on the poor of the bartender. But it's nice just make sure to have some mosquito repellent or itch cream cause we got eaten by mosquitos while sitting outside when it is such a beautiful day!"}
{"text":"Is anyone a big Bruschetta fan like me?? They have some of the most creative and tasty varieties...total palate pleaser! You have to order a bunch to share with friends. And I love the midday $5 wine specials! Oh, why not encourage a little day-drinking??!!! Hahaha! 

Fantastically social and quaint atmosphere. You guys know I love the indoor/outdoor thing! :-) Its an old post office w/ what I believe are original wood floors. I love how they creak when you walk around. I especially like going at night when the candlelight is flickering throughout & groups of friends gather on sofas.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place, but I have to admit, it's really not a 'date' place. Well, let me clrify, it's not a good 'first date' place. 
The converted post office has terrible acoustics and it gets REALLY loud in there. Unless you know someone really well, you might feel a little awkward yelling at them, or saying 'What?!' after everything they say.
And, while the brushettas are AMAZINGLY delicious - i swear by the prosciutto, it is to die for - it is definitely not pretty to eat; capers flying across the table and gnawing through the crunchy bread like a rabid dog. 
but, i love going there with good friends and my boyfriend. the servers aren't snobs and they will help you pick a bottle even if you just tell them, 'uh, i like red, yeah, red wine is awesome' without rolling their eyes. the crowd can look very scottsdale, but the attitude is not, so don't get discouraged when you walk in a see business men in suits and lots of tan legs and blonde hair.
the menu is just appetizers, but i guess you can order pizzas from La Grande Orange (please don't call it 'LGO,' that's lame) which is right across the parking lot and owned by the DeMarcos as well. I've never had it but it comes highly recommended.
oh! and they waive corking fees on monday nights, but other than that, i don't think they many specials- too bad."}

Great food, super cool ambiance and can you say, \"wine on tap\"? Doens't get much better than that."}
{"text":"Postinos is an excellent place to grab a glass of wine and a light meal. There is an excellent patio and lounge area. I like that its good for intimate setting but they can also accommodate larger groups. They have a great selection of $5 wines which they offer on happy hour till 5pm everyday. Mondays and Tuesdays have $20 bottle of wine and bruschetta. We've tried all their bruschettas and we love each one! Theyre surprisingly filling--all fresh ingredients!"}

{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite places because they have great wine and yummy bruschetta! I've brought family, new friends and pretty much everyone here. We always get the bruschetta here! It's the perfect sharing plate. The live music is a plus when they have it and it's just a chill environment."}

Love this place! Here's some tips; everyday before 5pm the glasses of wine are $5.. You may have a tough time finding parking so make it easy on yourself and bring cash to valet. Make sure to stop by the LGO grocery store after you eat at Postino. 

Now, onto the food at Postino. Pretty much the best thing you can order is the Bruschetta board because its SOOOO AWESOME! 

As many other Yelpers with great taste have mentioned, a couple of the best bruchettas (although it's tough not to just order 2 boards and get them all- except the artichoke, that one should be avoided). 

Highly Recommended (I don't have the exact names down, but here's the main); the salami one, the one with fig, apples and brie (****BEST*****), the roasted red pepper and mozz/basil/tomato. 

The first time you go, you may just have to order 2 boards if your party is big enough, because they are all so good, except for the artichoke one- that one is NOT good. 

The wait staff does a great job, and I love everything about Postino! After writing this review I need go, like this weekend... Like now, wait, \"Can we go to Postino for lunch?\""}
{"text":"Loved the bruschetta! I got a bruschetta board where you get to pick 4 types of bruschetta to try out. They were all unique and delicious. It was a fun eating experience. My 18 month old got the pb&j bruschetta from the kids menu, it was adorable. The kids meal also came with fruit and chips. Inside seating was full so we had to sit outside, we were worried since it was 115 outside at the time. But the patio seating was very shaded and they have misters going so it was actually very pleasant."}
{"text":"Love Postino!! Bruschetta boards are my favorite -- can't go wrong with Apple and Brie, the burratta, or fig. For $15 you can pick four flavors. Don't forget to ask about the seasonal. I love the cucumber lemonade and they have a great wine and beer selection as well."}
{"text":"Postino is my favorite restaurant to go to in the Phoenix area. The board and bruscetta board deal on Mondays and Tuesdays is amazing.  The wines are always great and the boards never disappoint!"}
{"text":"This is such a great location! Fun fact: it is the first postino and it used to be a post office! Hence the name! 

Anyways, I like coming to this one a lot more compared to the one on central or the one in Tempe because I almost always get a table without a wait. 

As usual, food as service are great. 
The soup of the day was home made chicken noodle with pesto and lemon! Mmmmm so good."}
{"text":"Went back in the evening for some more of the delicious bruschetta!  This time I went with another friend and we shared that plus the artichoke dip and a sandwich.  We over ordered, but I wanted to try something new this time. He wanted the \"Nine Iron\" which has chicken, bacon, mozzarella, lettuce, tomato, and dijionnaise on ciabatta.  It was rather tasty, however, the ratio of fillings felt a little off.  I love tomato, so it wasn't a big deal to me, but the sandwich was full of it with one thin little leaf of lettuce and clumps of chicken that weren't evenly distributed between the ciabatta.  I ended up opening the sandwich and rearranging the ingredients myself in order to help it along.  Fresh produce, good flavors and amazing bruschetta!  Honestly, I don't think you can really go wrong ordering it.

The service we received this time around wasn't up to par, but decent enough.  We didn't get our water refilled and the waiter never came back again so that we could order more drinks.  It was a shame.  The food still salvaged the visit though.  I just hope it doesn't happen too frequently since I plan to come here more often with some more friends.

This time we sat on the patio since it was a little quieter in order to chat and despite the chillier weather (I say that loosely, since I'm from Chicago and shouldn't really complain...) I found the outdoor torch like heaters (no, I don't know the technical term for them and apologize for that) to be perfect along with my jacket. Next time around, I think I'll try the soup and salad!"}
{"text":"I spent a great deal of time looking for places myself and my girlfriends would enjoy for our winter escape to Phoenix from Minnesota.   

I found out about Postino and had to try it.  SO glad I did!  Enjoyed the eclectic atmosphere and the great adjectives my server used to describe the wine.  

I had the pick two  - prociutto/brie panini with a side of roasted pepper/gorganzola soup.   All to die for!   The ladies at the next table ordered the mix of baguette with different toppings.. looked amazing.  

I was there for happy hour and sat on the patio.  I love the atmosphere, very comfortable and non-pretentious.   Very good value.  My bill after eating and having two glasses of wine at happy hour was $21.  

My girlfriends arrive tomorrow.  Postino is a definite stop.   Love it!"}
{"text":"My FAVORITE restaurant in Phoenix! You have to go with their bruschetta boards because it's such a good value and absolutely delicious. My personal fav would be the prosciutto with fig and mascarpone. The board comes with four different bruschetta choices all for only $15, and the bruschetta is big so you'll get full!

Highly suggest coming on Tuesday for their wine deal where you get a whole bottle of wine and bruschetta board for just $20. 

Lastly, top it off off with their salted caramel sundae,ahhhhh-mazing!!  Chocolate covered corn nuts, pretzel and caramel topping vanilla ice cream, how can you go wrong?

Can't say enough good things about this restaurant, I go all the time! Oh wait one more thing, it's pet friendly on the outdoor patio :)"}
{"text":"I've experienced Postino two different ways in the past two weeks: a late night visit for tea and sparkling wine and a few days later to grab pick up for my boss and myself. 

The first visit was a nice intro, I like the location, tucked in on Campbell, and the interior design is cozy (fab chandelier!). The retail wine area at the entrance is awkward to me, because it's cramped and I frankly think you should all be buying wine at my shop so perhaps I'm a touch biased. Anyway, it is a great way for you to take home whatever you enjoyed with your dinner. Damn magnanimity. 

I wasn't in the mood for drunk biking that night so I skipped the adult beverages for a pot of tea. I get that this is a wine cafe so really no one going here is going to review a cup of tea, except for me. Tea selection was sad. Tea has the same cult following that wine does, so three options seemed half-hearted. And my pot of hot water was only half filled, which, for $2.50 is lame.  Okay I'm done bashing PW. 

The second time I drove in for a take out order of the bruschetta board. My order was ready, the place was packed and I was able to get in and out in less than 3 mins! We ordered the date and pistachio on ricotta, the fig and prosciutto, the mozz/tomato/basil and the smoked salmon pesto. Great value to order ratio, each slice was huge and pre-chopped into littler bites. The smoked salmon was definitely my favorite, with the runner up being the pistachio/date combo. The MTB was a little dry for me and I don't eat prosciutto so that was for my boss.

I love that they have neighborhood night deals and that you can friend them on facebook and get a special word of the day to get $5 glasses of wine no matter what time of night!"}
{"text":"I've been a longtime Yelp lurker over many years, and have read thousands of reviews that have lead me to awesome finds and away from the not-so-greats.  

Postino gets the privilege of being my first review! I have been in the Phoenix area for a total of 7 days since January and I have ended up at various Postino locations 4 times in those days. That says a lot from somebody who normally would always try a new place instead of frequenting the same spot over and over. Here's why:

Fun vibe - casually bougie without the pretense (it's possible!). 
Awesome servers - attentive and personable without being annoying or overbearing.
Amazing bruschetta - perfectly toasted with great combinations of toppings. I prefer the savory over sweet. 
Excellent wine and beer selections - they've got your standards plus the locals plus some unique options that'll keep you busy.
Price is right - I'll gladly share my student loans + interest with Postino, even after 5pm as I did last night with a group of friends.

I will say the cheap Asian in me isn't a fan of the valet parking (it's not always there, though). They are lucky I'm too lazy to walk in the heat of summer. My mother would be so disappointed if she knew I paid for valet.  

As a new transplant just down the road, I have a feeling I'll be back many times.  For those of us busy during the day, I am so happy they have weekend happy hour and date night specials. Just need to find the date first, but I won't digress... ;p

Really though, other restaurants should take note."}
{"text":"Hands down the best wine bar in Phoenix.  Great atmosphere, music, deals and wine.  This is the number one place on my list for those who have a sophisticated pallet.  It is busy there for a reason and definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"Love Postino ! Great location fabulous atmosphere fabulous food service is a little lacking but they can improve upon that would definitely come back! cheers!!"}
{"text":"This is our girls lunch go to place. Wine fantastic and not overly priced,  bruschetta is amazing. We love it. For lunch they have a 1/2 sandwich and salad of your choice. We go with that frequently. Have never had anything that wasn't outstanding!

Only downside is parking. I take issue with mandatory valet parking. Unless you get REALLY lucky and find a space that isn't RESERVED for valet. grrrr"}
{"text":"Had a super time at Postino, great selection of wines!  Good food and nice environment."}
{"text":"Solid 3 stars. Limited menu. Would like to go back and try the specials during the week & Happy Hour..."}
{"text":"my my my...

spectakski.  Not going to read through all of these reviews, and not wanting to be too redundant, I'll just say the fig/ prozuut  and tomato jam/ sheep's cheese were insane! I may just order a board of the two on my next visit.  Wasn't too jazzed about the salmon or buratta/bacon (they were good, but paled in comparison.

They sell the bread too!  I was doubting myself the whole way home as to why I would buy a $7 loaf o' bread, then I ate it again and realized I have short term memory loss ;)

CHEERS"}
{"text":"Love the prosciutto Brushetta!! And the Chocolate Bouchon!! Highly recommend!! Love this place"}
{"text":"This place is always hopping, and yet magically we are always able to get a table. I love the happy hour $5 wine, and the bruschetta boards are delicious. Parking is valet, but it's complimentary (bring some cash for a tip). Their wine selection is fun, and their servers are helpful. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"First of all I'm starting off by giving it three stars because I think it is crazy that the parking lot is as small as it is and that it is valet parking!! Our waiter had absolutely no sense of humor whatsoever and had to make the comment that he was leaving shortly as if he was glad not to have us as customers.  Seriously, we were 3 50 year old women!! Since it was 4 o'clock in the afternoon we decided that we would just have some wine and bruschetta.  The wine was a Moscato and it actually was very good but I wish the waitress would know enough to put it on ice. My cousin who is a pretty aggressive person, asked for a bucket with ice. It has been quite a few years since I've been here and the bruschetta was definitely not as good as I remembered it.  There were a couple of standouts and then there were some that were just meh. Are tab was ninety dollars, and for that amount I would have expected a lot more. I think this place is a great hangout for people who live in the area or for those who want to be seen in a trendy restaurant. With so many new restaurants opening up I don't think I will be visiting this one for a long time."}
{"text":"Went with friends to enjoy the bruschetta and wine special.  It was delicious! Service was good.  Plan to come back to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"One of the best places to have a great meal in the valley.
I ordered a two picks combo menu of the house salad and nine iron(?) sandwich0 which was a PERFECT choice. I can't wait to go back there again to try other menus."}
{"text":"Definitely a cool place for food & drinks. I got there at 11:30 am on Friday for a business lunch to find it pretty empty and quiet, and by 12:30 the place was packed and loud. Great indoor/outdoor spot with a variety of seating options (high top, bar, couches, regular tables, etc). The menu isn't giant but there are a lot of good things on it. The mixed salad is out of this world awesome - the crispy fennel, gorgonzola, and sweet nuts really is something else. The focaccia bread on the sandwiches is bomb. I had the only vegetarian sandwich option and it was pretty basic. I do wish they had a second vegetarian option that was a little more exciting than hummus/cukes/tomatoes."}
{"text":"When I had mentioned to my girlfriend I had never been to Postino's she said, REALLY???  Well then you are in for a treat.  She wasn't kidding!  Who said a wine bar won't get crowded in late June during 109 degree temperature???  And this was at their new location on Central (just north of Camelback). The four of us shared the Bruschetta SELECTION OF 4, so we all got to pick and share...  We enjoyed the Brie & Apple w/Fig Spread, Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato & Basil, Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios, and Warm Artichoke Spread.  Their portions are very generous and each bruschetta is cut in 4 so you don't have to struggle with it yourself.  Anyone who knows me well, knows I ALWAYS slice my sandwiches in 4...easier to eat :-)  Wine by the glass 11am-5pm 7 days a week...yay!!!"}
{"text":"I came here on Thursday before my company and I were going to head to LGO for dinner. I have been wanting to try this place for awhile now since I have been hearing and reading great things through yelp. I mean how great can panini's and bruschetta actually be? More on that later. 
The actual building itself was pretty cool. A nice chill vibe that wasn't overbearing with pretentiousness. Always a breath of fresh air. What kills this place is the crowd. I showed up about 2 PM. and the crowd was casual and just having a good time. As the time got later the typical Arcadia yuppie / trendy crowd began coming in. Totally killing the atmosphere. I don't know why so many people in Scottsdale and Phoenix are like this, I don't get it. It's not attractive, you look like douche bags. I swear it seems as though there is a clan of people on yelp all yelping together to write great reviews, because it's what they like, so gay. 
OK, now for this food review, it's strictly for the bruschetta's. Honestly I don't know why people praise somethings. I tasted four of them. Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato and Basil. Tomato Jam and fresh Sheep's Milk Cheese. Burrata, Bacon, Arugula, and Tomatoes. And Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese. Let me get one thing clear, they all tasted good, and yes some were more impressive than others, but come on it's a slice of bread with a topping, not really a culinary masterpiece. Although I will give props to the Tomato jam, that was delicious! 
As an all around value of Postino, you really can't go wrong. The prices match what these items should be priced at, and solid drink deals. I would definitely go back if fellow friends suggest going there, but I don't think I would go out of my way to come back here.
  But with all this being said, they have 2 locations and are opening up a third one.  So props to the owners, they have marketed a concept and people are loving it so they're doing something right in many people's opinions."}
{"text":"I decided to start celebrating my birthday a night early so we came to Postino's to take advantage of their Tuesday night special. The parking lot was packed so we opted to valet which was only $3. We got here at 7:30 and although they quoted us about a 25 minute wait, we only waited about 15 minutes. 

The outside patio is pretty cute with the lights and bushes and they have heaters to keep you warm on a chilly night. 

You can choose ANY bottle on their menu and get a board of bruschetta for $20. We went with a bottle of a California Cab (delicious, I almost drank the whole bottle myself), a board of bruschetta, and the nine iron panini. Mike is a pretty picky eater, but I thought I was going to have to fight him for one of the pieces of prosciutto with figs & mascarpone he liked it so much. I love getting him to try new things and even more so when he actually likes them. The smoked salmon with pesto and warm artichoke pieces were also delish. The nine iron was also very tasty. The bacon and mozzarella were definitely the stars of this dish. The mozzarella just melted in your mouth. 

The staff here was so friendly. Our water glasses were never empty and someone was always checking in on us. I was also walked to the bathroom when I asked where it was.

Thanks for making our first visit so great!"}
{"text":"So wow. This place was amazing. Food, service, decor, Postino's has everything. I went here with my husband after rock climbing the camel back mountain.  At first this place kind of threw us off. It has a free valet which made us think our dirty hiking gear apparel would get us snubbed, and everything would be super expensive. I'm sure you have gathered based on the five star rating this was not the case. The gold diggers of Scottsdale were in attendance decked out in Lululemon, to class down the dress code. 

 To the food: We got two plates of bruschetta, and after basically licking the plate clean we got their meat and cheese butcher block plate. All the bruschetta was amazing--super flavorful and used very fresh ingredients.  We also got some wine and a mimosa, fantastic as well. One of our bruschettas was missing an end, the waitress told us that more would be out soon to make up for the missing piece. Soon afterwards, another server brought it with a little extra added, making for no complaints on our end.

I loved the ambiance. Its really cool and classy with lots of character. You can dress up or wear hiking gear. It also has garage doors to hang outside on those warm-weathered days (basically everyday in Scottsdale!). Complete with heater and misters for the summer.  Amazing all around, so chick this place out."}
{"text":"This has to be my favorite Postino's. The servers are all awesome, and the wait doesn't ever seem too terrible. I always come here for Board and Bottle in the evening, the ambiance is so cute, with the lights and the shrubs that separate the restaurant from the parking lot. Joseph served us this last week and we had a great time. However, the interaction with all of the other employees has been great. The only awkward part is when I get seated next to my friends like we are on a date, but we always make it a fun time!"}
{"text":"Good: Food was amazing. Atmosphere is awesome. All the different plates introduce you to a new way of experiencing  flavor combinations. 

Bad: A little pricy, but thats what you can expect from a  cool hip place. Don't go there to get full unless you want to break the bank. Mandatory parking sucks, because my truck is usually dirty, inside and out. I'm taking a star off myself for that. 

Conclusion: The bad isn't really bad, I'm just cheap. Someday when I'm rich and famous, I'll look at the check, laugh, and throw hundred dollar bills at the table and be like \"Shut up and take my money!\""}
{"text":"Always busy, but i'm a fan of their Monday and Tuesday board/bottle deal.. plus their bruscetta is probably the best i've had here in town."}
{"text":"Seriously one of the best restaurants I've gone to on my trip to Phoenix! We can during happy hour and our wait ended up being around 45 minutes, but well worth it! Two happy hour times, and on Mondays/Tuesday's (when we went) the late happy hour starts at about 8PM.

Parking is hard to come by during peak times; luckily someone pulled out not too long after we got there. Parking spot right in front of the entrance. 

When we were eventually seated - we ordered their happy hour special - bruschetta board. It's a $15 board of four types of bruschetta -- you're choice of a variety of flavors and combinations. With it being happy hour - you get the full board plus $5 for an entire bottle of wine!! By the time we left we got 2 boards and 2 bottles of wine. Since we didn't even finish the first one, you can easily take home your open and unopened bottles! They even package it in a cute paper bag.

Our bruschetta board (the flavors we choose) were: First board - Brie and apples with a fig spread, prosciutto with fig and marscapone, smoked salmon with pesto, ricotta with dates and pistachios. This flavors were to die for! There's definitely something about a cheese and fruits combination. My favorites - Brie and apples and the ricotta with dates and pistachios. Second board -- Brie and apples again, fresh mozzarella with tomato and basil, burrata, bacon, arugula, and tomatoes, and their seasonal flavor which was a type of specialty ham and a lemon herb ricotta. By the way, their bread is gluten free!

The bruschetta board is a definite must, and if you're also looking for something fancy - try the butchers block. We also enjoyed this assortment of artisan meats and cheeses served with smoked almond hummus, olives, asparagus, nuts, and crostinis.

My meal was accompanied by a refreshing cucumber honey lemonade. I cannot fathom enough how much I enjoyed this restaurant and wine bar! It's perfect for a date night or just a girls night out. Outside seating just as beautiful like inside. A must try!"}
{"text":"Ahh Postino Wine Bar... Or is it Postinos? Or Postino Wine Cafe? Whatever! 

I would definitely consider myself a Postino expert. Postino was a go to for countless dates of mine. I have been to all of the locations and my experience at this location has unfortunately changed. 

When I first stated going to this Postino I loved it! Me and my roommate would visit every Sunday religiously. We always got great service! Food was fantastic and timely. But it seems as if the the 40th street location is either under new management or just has new rude employees. I no longer go to this location because of a couple negative encounters with servers. I had no idea it was there business how many women I take on dates there. You would think the business would be appreciated. I was shocked when a server made a snide comment about my dating habits right in front of a lady friend. I would have been pretty pissed if that was an actual date. Very unprofessional staff at this location!

I recommend going to the newer Central & Camelback location if you are planning on visiting Postino. 

Pros:
- cheap tasty bruschetta
- reasonable wine prices
- decent beers on tap
- crazy fast but borderline annoying water refills
- short wait times

Cons
- rude servers
- shallow menu
- bad for taking dates"}
{"text":"Food was ok bread was stale on my sandwich. But service was not good at all! God for bid you ask them to split a check. I was told she cannot do it. Only if we told her when we sit down to start. Well my friends came 30min before me and my wife.  Been in restaurants for 20 years and you do what ever it take to make your customers happy.  So bottom line is we will not be going back for stale bread and half ass service."}
{"text":"Be warned gluten.... Went for happy hour expecting to have GF food. Postinos said they could do gluten-free before we were seated.
Come to find out they could only do olives truly gf once they found out it was a true allergy. 
We were told by several different people that many items were gluten free; such as the sandwiches, but upon further questions about the meats, cheeses, etcetera being GF, they took back their reassurances. Close call to being poisoned!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible. The bruschetta is the absolute best. They have so many unique combinations it's tough to select which one you want. Their Panini's are also fantastic. And the ambience is perfect."}
{"text":"So yummy! I loved the atmosphere. I got the panini Prosciutto with Brie and it was to die for! Followed by great wine, made it a great night!"}
{"text":"Best Bruschetta in the valley! The food, service and atmosphere is as good as it gets. Great happy hour and Bruschetta Board bottle of wine special after 8 pm on Mondays and Tuesdays. If you haven't been here... you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Good food and wine, especially on a weekday before 5 pm ($5 wine). 

First, if you're going to call yourself a wine cafe, have a good selection of wine to choose from. I think The Cheesecake Factory has a wine list with more variety. With that being said, I did find a couple of good wines to quaff on a 97 degree day, and the service from the bartender was great.

Second, if you're going to attempt to be a quasi-Italian restaurant, play good music. The music wasn't totally offensive, but it certainly didn't match the ambiance.

Now for the food. This place clearly prides itself on their bruschetta. Here are the 4 that I chose:

Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese 
Smoked Salmon with Pesto
Ricotta, Dates and Pistachios
Traditional with Tomato, Basil and Mozzarella

The bread they use is excellent. Perfect for bruschetta. My favorite was the salmon, and the roasted pepper one was quite delicious. I even enjoyed the dates and pistachio bruschetta, but probably wouldn't order it again.

Traditional brushcetta is an appetizer for which I measure any Italian restaurant. The fresh bruschetta here was way too salty, could hardly taste the fresh tomato and basil, which appeared to be fresh and of good quality. Why would you over-salt fresh brushcetta? Major fail, and one of the reasons this place is getting 3 stars instead of 4. 

I may come here again though, I just know not to order the fresh bruschetta."}
{"text":"This is my first time at the Arcadia location and the service was soooo slow. Bruschetta is always on point and the only time I ever come to Postinos is for the $20 board and bottle night on Monday and Tuesday. The upside of this location is that there's a parking lot and the wait was only about 20 min, versus the Tempe and Scottsdale locations which had about 1-1.5 hr wait times. I split the board with my friend and we got the Brie and Apple with fig, prosciutto with figs and marscapone, smoked salmon with pesto, and the burrata, bacon, arugula, with tomato. Out of all of them the pesto salmon is always one of my go tos but the burrata, bacon, arugula with tomato was definitely my favorite! I would probably not order the prosciutto with figs and marscapone but my friend liked it! I think I tend to just prefer the stronger flavors. Overall I always have to recommend Postinos for board and bottle night but it took us about 40 minutes for us to get our check and pay!"}
{"text":"I was in town and my friend wanted to take me to the place across the street from Postino but they weren't opened for lunch.  Fine with me because Postino turned out great!  The valet boy and one of the other men waiting for a table gave us good reviews so we said, why not?

It's been a long while since my friend and I saw each other so we were talking a lot in-between trying to figure out what to order.  The waitress had to come back 3 times before we settled on something, but she was cool with it.  Known for their bruschetta and sandwiches, that's exactly what we ordered.  The bruschetta came with 4 different options so we chose Mozzarella with Tomato and Basil (good), Chopped Tomato with Pesto (very fresh and tasty), Salami with Pesto (slightly salty but very good), and the Prosciutto with Figs and Mascarpone (my favorite).

Thinking we weren't going to be full on just some bread, we also ordered the ham & cheese panini (nicely toasted and yummy).  It comes with a salad and the waitress split this w/o us mentioning it.  We ended up only eating half the sandwich and half the bruschetta.  The bruschetta were big (about the size of your palm -- not mine, because I have small hands) and thick as well.  The toppings were generous and all very fresh.

I'd definitely come back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"So this is going to be my new favorite spot for Monday and Tuesday night. You cant beat  their giant sized bruschetta and bottle of fine wine. My girlfriend and I had a great time for our first night out in Phoenix. I am very excited to be a weekly customer for a very long time!"}
{"text":"Good food in a nice location. This place is always packed. Docked a star due to service being so so. Servers aren't so friendly - maybe because they're so busy? - takes away from a full pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Service is always fantastic. Bruschetta is unreal, brunch is unreal. No complaints"}
{"text":"I love this place. The atmosphere, the food, the drink, the music...it's perfect for date night when you want a little romance, or for that after work kickback spot. It's my go to when I want to feel completely relaxed because I know they're going to take care of me."}
{"text":"\"Eat me\"

Yep, that's what everything (the food) said to me as it came out. That about sums up my experience.. but read on for more specifics.

Service: TOP notch service. Our waiter was patient and super attentive. He knew the menu and even said, that's why I work here because EVERYTHING is good!

Food: We started with the spinach artichoke/white bean hummus combo and the grilled cheese.. yes.. folks grilled cheese. This was by far the best grilled cheese I've had..ever and that says a lot. It was on a nice flaky break with the perfect amount of gooey-ness. It was served with a ketchup, fancy mustard, and pesto. Fabuloso!

For the entree - I had the tomato florentine - I felt like it was missing a spice, but it was still good. I had the chicken and mozzarella panini and the mixed greens salad. Albeit I was stuffed, it was amazing and tasted even better the next day.

The other perk is they have a focused menu. They aren't trying to be everything to everyone. Another bonus!

The open doors/windows, patio seating and coziness of the restaurant was a perk.

The only thing I wish there was more of was light. It was very hard to read the menu using a small candle. It wasn't enough for me to take this down a star though."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Fantastic wine selection and a few beers for the bros. 

I've had their bruschetta (10/10) and grilled cheese bites (8/10) and never been disappointed. The fig + goat cheese + pistachio bruschetta is the way to go. It was the first one I ever tried and will forever be my favorite. 

They have a fantastic deal on Monday nights after 8 I believe for $20 you get a bottle of wine and a bruschetta board. 

My only complaint would be that it gets so loud at night because it is a compact space that you can barely hear the person across from you, but I can't bring myself to take off a star for that."}
{"text":"Postino is my go-to girl talk, wine & munchie hangout! Their bruschetta board is off the charts ~you pick 4 options off of their delicious list~ {Warning: It's so hard to choose!! They're all amazing.} I've been known to get an entire board to myself for dinner! Whoops, carb overload but worth every calorie!! A few of my favorite classics are: Warm Artichoke, Red Pepper + Goat Cheese & Brie w/Green Apple +Fig Jam. Monday & Tuesday evenings after 8PM you can enjoy a bottle of house wine + a bruschetta board for $20!!!! Having a case of the Mondays? This is your spot!!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and comfy outdoor patio seating. The bruschetta options were so delicious. The wine list provides a large selection of wine. The wait to be seated was a bit long but worth it. I will be back."}
{"text":"This is literally my favorite spot to hang out with friends, family, boyfriend, anyone who will go with me. The $20 bruschetta and bottle of wine Monday and Tuesday's are a dream. My one and only gripe is that I would love more than on Cabernet option, I love my red wine! The bruschetta is honestly one of my favorite foods ever. The atmosphere is so chill you will feel right at home. Maybe sure to get the Brie and apple bruschetta, it's like dessert!"}
{"text":"In Short: Simply delicious, great ingredients and atmosphere. Awesome combination of imagination and temperance.

To say I loved this place would be an understatement.  I read the reviews before going and I had high expectations, and wasn't the least disappointed.  Location and atmosphere is great, there's outside seating if you'd fancy that.  Great selection of wine list and the beer selection is surprisingly robust.  Try the Lion stout if you are into a chocolate-caramel-creamy stouts.  We tried a couple of glasses of wine, before we descended into the menu.

The real star is the brushcetta, the combinations are pretty tasty.  I loved the smoked salmon, fig/mascapone/prachuto, salami, brie/honey/apple, and smoked peppers/goat cheese.  They also have seasonal selections so don't forget to enquire.  There's a lot of stuff to check out, the panini selection is amazing as well.  Great place to hangout with friends or for a date."}
{"text":"I love their wine, cheese and bruschetta.  I hate their lineups."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our happy hour tonight with family, all of us visiting. Bruschetta was awesome, loved the choices. Only thing I wasn't aware of was that the smoked salmon was actually lox. Wines were really good (we went with reds) and the paninis and salads. Great recommendation from a friend to go here!"}
{"text":"I've been to Postino on dates, for birthday celebrations, gatherings with friends and even a company Christmas party (read just a group of people with an excuse to day drink during the week).  In all cases, it works.

Quick tip, sit at the bar if you're on a date... if it goes badly, the bartenders are hot and will rescue you.  

What more do you need, really?"}
{"text":"I'd heard so much about Postino that I wasn't sure it would live up to the hype. Happily, it did! The atmosphere, the food, and the wine all measure up at Postino, the place that started the uber-urban renaissance at 40th and Campbell.

Postino is upscale, but not pretentious. The bruschetta really is out of this world, but the salads are incredible, too. Went there for lunch on a Friday and loved the diversity of the crowd. I also liked it that the noise level was reasonable, even when the place was packed."}
{"text":"I've been going to Postino's for 8 years now. It is one of my top three favorite places to eat and grab drinks. The wine selection is great. If you don't drink try the cucumber honey lemonade. We love the bruschettas, cheese board and butcher's block.  The salted caramel Sunday is a great ending. Yum!!"}
{"text":"I usually have an amazing experience--I had my first negative one (thus the fallen star) with an overly cocky waiter that under-delivered expectation. The food is always great, the environment, most enjoyable, whether brunch, lunch or after hours enjoyment...the bruschetta board is the best in the valley (my fave is the prosciutto/fig). The wine selection is lacking in diversity. Drink white or rosé and you will be safe! Overall, love this place--and it is in biking distance from home!"}
{"text":"Go to Postinos on Monday and Tuesdays.  $20 for a board of bruschetta and a bottle of wine.  You can even cork your wine and take home what you're not able to drink.  The special starts at 8pm and gets packed but it is so worth the wait.  This is one of my favorite restaurants.  The entire staff is absolutely wonderful and friendly.  They make every visit extremely enjoyable."}
{"text":"I had one of their sandwiches with a mini  picture of beer for lunch the other day.  The building  and atmosphere are great, however the sandwich (paninni) was mostly bread.  The have a geat wine list, and in the cooler months, the patio looks inviting."}
{"text":"I had a tuna sandwich, very good I definitely would go back!
Also the chips not bad. Tea was good"}
{"text":"Love. Love. Love this place. Yummy cheese, nut & fruit platter is my fave. Super yummy and very filling. But also shared the Nine iron and it was great. Happy hour is the best time to go to try it out first to see if you'll like it. But really, you don't need a test drive with this place. It's a \"sure thing\" that you'll love it if you have the taste for casual dining with class. ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Beautiful people, tasty Brushetta, good wine all go well with the good weather.  No complaints, but this place could you an early acoustic jazz happy hour a little more regularly.  

Great place in the sun!"}
{"text":"Location: 
Parking sucks. Don't even bother pulling into their lot because it's valet for $3. You can find street parking or park across the street at the other business lots.

Hostess: 
Super nice. Greeted us with a smile. Added our names and told us how long the wait would be without asking. 

Atmosphere: 
This place really wants to be swanky with rows of wine bottles, a bar and a lounge type area. I felt like it was too dark. I was reading my menu by candlelight and I hated it. I wanted a flashlight or something. My eyes started to hurt! 

Service:
Our server was great and gave us suggestions, was very friendly and brought everything in a timely manner. She checked on us every so often which I appreciated.  Water was refilled by someone else without asking. 

Food: 
We only had the bruchetta and wine. The hubby picked two and I picked two for the sampler:
prosciutto with figs and mascarpone
tomato jam and fresh sheeps milk cheese 
smoked salmon with pesto
burrata, bacon, arugula and tomatoes

1 thing you have to know about me is that I do not like sweet tasting food. For me, sweet is for dessert. Knowing that, you can probably guess I wasn't a fan of the 1st two which were the ones my hubby picked. But I ate them anyways. I liked the one with figs better than the tomato jam. The hubby really liked them both. I liked both the savory ones and am determined to make them at home. 

Clientele: People are way too dressed up to come here. Take that as you wish."}
{"text":"Postino's has the best brushetta around. Fresh ingredients and a marvelous wine list to go with it. It is always busy but if you go a little early for lunch it is easier to get in.  The parking can be rough but plan ahead and it is worth it.
This is one place with food and atmosphere to rival one of my favorite places in Florence Italy.  Don't rush, be patient and above all be open minded.  You may discover a dish you would have never considered and love it."}
{"text":"Postino's is one of my main go to places for fun or business.  Love the food and staff.  It just can't get any better."}
{"text":"Had lunch of soup and sandwich here and it was delicious!  My co-workers had bruschetta board and charcuterie/olive board.  Both looked like something I'd like to try next visit.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this quaint little wine bar. Ambiance and decor were great, however it was dark so difficult to read the menu. The Waitress helped me pick out a good glass of red wine, although she liked more rose wines. The bruschetta was AMAZING!!! We tried a variety of the bruschetta: apple & bri, artichoke and prosciutto. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great patio, happy hour prices, wine list, beer, and food. I love meeting my friends here after work. Please open one in the East Valley!"}
{"text":"Having grown up in this neighborhood, it was quite a shock to come back and see that Katz Deli (a longtime institution on Central Ave.) had been completely transformed into Postino's newest creation.  Walking in, there's absolutely no indication that Katz was ever here, even though the shell of the building remains.  That said, mad props to Postino for preserving this landmark.

Too be fair, I'm not a wine expert nor a frequent wine drinker.  If you are, you're more than covered at this neighborhood hangout.  The food, while a limited selection, is excellent.  I've had a couple of the paninis and the bruschetta and I've never been disappointed.  My favorites are the Turkey Panini and the Smoked Salmon and Pesto Bruschetta.  Light and flavorful and a nice complement to the Syrah I had.  

The atmosphere is very urban and industrial and is absolutely jam packed at night.  A little noisy at times for my taste as sometimes I've had to yell at my friends for them to hear me, but I pretty much expected that with the crowd this place draws.

All in all, a nice addition to the neighborhood.  Postino's reputation in the Arcadia neighborhood brought me in, and the good food and relaxed atmosphere has made me a believer.  If you're a nightlife fan then come here at dinnertime or after a movie.  If you're a foodie (like me) I recommend coming here for lunch (or Sunday Brunch) when its more relaxed and not as crowded.  If you're a wine buff, then you're good here at all hours.  RIP to Katz, but a nice new chapter for this historic location"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Postino's! This visit did not disappoint. I mean, how can you be disappointed when you get a bottle of wine and bruschetta board for $20?! 

My friend took me here to continue with birthday festivities and it was indeed a treat. We were lucky enough to have Stefan (sorry if I'm spelling it wrong) as our server. He was spectacular and on-point with everything. Then when my friend told him it was still part of my birthday celebration, he brought out a chocolate cake with ice cream and a candle -- and sang to me. (At my request, at the TOP of his lungs so the whole restaurant knew it was my birthday. Lol.) THANK YOU, STEFAN!!! :) Oh, and to top it off, I got a kiss on the cheek... super sweet. Totally made my night. 

If you haven't gone to Postino's yet, what are you waiting for?! Great food, amazing wine, outstanding service and superb ambiance."}
{"text":"Can't wait to go back.  I love the Monday deal, it is genius.  I was there with my twin mom group (about 12 moms of twins), we had a blast.  I love the Brie, Apple and Fig, Prosciutto, Fig and mascarpone, Tomato jam bruschettas.  I had the Teira Zinfandel, which was perfect."}
{"text":"Postino is a great restaurant, all locations have superb service and food/drinks. 

Postino Arcadia is right down the street from where I live, I frequent here and have never had a bad experience.

One thing to keep in mind though is during happy hour, the wait can be a little long, but that is a good thing though, people enjoy going to Postino."}
{"text":"The good: nice place, nice service. nice experience. 
As all have mentioned before, interesting and delicious wine selections and bruschetta to die for [I am a fan of the proscuitto/fig/marscarpone and the smoked salmon]. Knowledgeable and friendly staff. 

The bad: okay, the not-so-good...hideous parking [but there's a $3 valet] and really loud. Interesting vibe and a mixed crowd. Would bet its great when the weather cools down and patio seating is more appealing that the current August sauna. 

All in all, I'd go back, eat. drink. eat some more."}
{"text":"Love the wine selection, incredible bruschetta, but questionable service. Went here with a party of 10 and the service was terrible--probably because we were a big enough party to add automatic gratuity, so the servers (we had several!) didn't seem too concerned with us. But again, the prices, wine selection, and bruschetta make it worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Awesome.  Sooooo Good!!!!  Go here, you will not be disappointed!

A funny story from here...we asked the one server (a guy) to take my date and my picture together.  When he got the phone, he hit something that went to the gallery...and he said, \"There are some pictures on here I am not supposed to see...I didn't look at them...\"  We just laughed...."}
{"text":"Monday and Tuesday Bruschetta and Wine deals are where it's at!! Bruschetta is always on point!!"}
{"text":"Noone does bruschetta like postino.  Figs, goat cheese, brie, salmon, capers... just some of the ingredients you might find on their bruschetta.  And, you can mix and match.

The 5 dollar glasses of wine for happy hour are great.  

The ambience in all of the restaurants owned by this group are amazing.  Its similar to Windsor, but with different food.  It's the kind of place you have a great time hanging out on because the clean/modern/hip atmosphere rubs off on you!

Highly recommended"}
{"text":"After hearing raves about Postino... I finally got a chance to go check it out. I'm not too much of a drinker, but the $5 Wines By The Glass Happy Hour is great, especially since they've extended it to 5 PM! 

It was a leisurely early dinner, getting to Postino about 4:15, and the place was already starting to fill up! (By the time we got our food, around 4:45, it was completely packed!!!) I wanted to try the bruschetta, but my dining companion (my lovely sister) didn't want to split it (due to allergies, more on that later), and I couldn't take home leftovers, so I decided on the Select Two, going with the Autostrada Panini and Italian Picnic Salad without walnuts. I also got a glass of the Ca Del Sarto Pinot Grigio (I only drink whites). My sister had been to Postino multiple times and knew what she wanted to order, knowing it should be allergen (aka nut) free (also the Select Two, the Prosciutto with Brie Panini and Mediterranean Salad). She informed our waitress though of her condition and thankfully our waitress was very responsive. We sat and talked for about a half hour before our food came (watching the mimosas float by our table sped up the time), and I dug right in. However I was alerted to the shaky voice of my sister that she had found a nut in her salad. We called over our waitress and she was super apologetic about it, and quickly set out to resolve the issue. My sister thankfully didn't eat the nut (which turned out to be a walnut)!!! She got a new salad and sandwich and checked everything over, and everything came out a-ok. Our waitress was really great about the whole thing! My food was quite yummy! The sandwich was full of delectable salty meats, but I wished it was a tid bit warmer. The salad was top notch though! I've always avoided beets in my food endeavors, I don't know why, even though I had never tried them, but the Italian Picnic salad has opened my eyes to the glory that is the roasted beet! The different flavors and textures all blended together so nicely, especially with the crispy bacon! I wish I could have pinpointed what was in the dressing so I could recreate it at home! Ah, I guess I'll just have to go again!"}
{"text":"How do you add Yelp value to a business that has already been reviewed 579 times? What else can I say that has not been said before? Probably nothing, but I don't write Yelp reviews for you, I write them for me. And I love it.

So, lets face it, you're not scrolling through 578 reviews to find mine, and really, i'm not terribly offended by it. Let me do you (and me) a favor and break it down very simply and give you the hard.cold.facts:

The best day to go: Monday night

Why?: $20 for any bottle of wine and a bruschetta board (4 different types) starting 8pm

Strategy: go there 10-20mins before and scout out for a table. Expect an extremely long wait if you get there after 8pm

What to order (in order of tasty): [Bruschetta] Tomato jam and goat cheese, fig and prosciutto, Apple and brie, pesto and salami, pistachio and date, caprese (lacks balsamic vinegar and olive oil). [Other] Olives.

Don't bother getting: white bean hummus is pretty insipid and the artichoke dip doesn't add much to your meal, nor is on discount during their Monday specials.

Best group number: 2-4 is pretty perfect. Anything more will be hard to accommodate as the space is pretty small.

Overall impression: ridiculously good deal on Monday to share with 4-5 people, paying only $8-10 to get sufficiently tipsy and full. Location is classy, service is pretty decent but be aware that the parking situation sucks as the lot in front of it will tow you for parking there."}
{"text":"This is my kind of place.  I used to really enjoy going to Sakowitz years ago and having lavosh and cheese in the midst of my shopping.  I can do this at Postino.  There is a sense of the quiet and the casual where a man (or woman) can sit back, have most pleasant snacks, and let the world go by.  I have found places like this on the coast and am happy to find one like it in Phoenix.  I wouldn't go here for a \"full blown\" meal but it wouldn't be the place it is if I were going to.

In the hustle and bustle of today's world, Postino can provide you a welcome retreat.  It is needed."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite eateries in town.  Their specialty is the bruchetta board with a choice of 4 that's enough to feed 2 people.  Consistently the food is amazing.  With a glass of my favorite muscato, I am a happy girl.  A rounded out meal must include their yum-mazing creme brulee.  The simple dessert is perfectly done, each time.  The service is great and the staff seems to work as a great team.  The Monday night Bruchetta and Wine special is really a great deal, but that also means it is very, very crowded.  I usually aim for lunch hours."}
{"text":"Love this place, great food and wine list. Great atmosphere and vibe too!"}
{"text":"As the great Adam Richman says, \"Oh my goodness..oh..my..goodness\"
Hands down the BEST restaurant Ive eaten at in Pheonix thus far!
Had no idea what to expect coming to this restaurant while attending a conference over the past week, but a friend (who is now a local---tear) suggested this restaurant because of thier great happy hour. (Every Monday and Tuesday night after 8pm, $20 for a bottle of wine and bruschetta) We missed the happy hour but now that Ive had thier homemade bruschetta...who cares! I would come back again and again even without the discounted food. 
This restaurant is quaint and cute. Sort of small and tucked away behind a random street (obviously Im not a local Phoenix-er) But they have this cute little outdoors area with a fireplace and bar, and when you are in a hot little town in the middle of the dessert, its nice to be outdoors and enjoy the warmth at night, something we dont get to enjoy too often in SF. Im sure many of the other plates at this restaurant are delicious as well, but their specialty by far has to be their bruschetta! Almost any type of concoction and combo you can think of to go on flaky/crispy baquettes, this restaurant has come up with. None of the bruschetta's that I tried were dissapointing.
Let me start by saying, this place is a \"share with everyone\" type of restaurant, which, I have no problems with because then I get to pig out and taste everyones's plates. haha!
So, I literally tasted almost every type of bruschetta that was on the menu.
Let me start with the Brie and Apples with Fig spread- this almost tasted like a dessert because the tangyness of the apples. The Tomato jam with fresh sheeps milk cheese could also be had for dessert. This actually may have been my most favorite out of all the bruschettas! The cheese was sooo creamy, you could eat it with a spoon. That mixed together with the sweetness of the tomato jam------heaven.....
Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone
The Warm Artichoke Spread was mighty tasty and fresh and this coming from a girl who grew up in the \"artichoke capital of the world\" 
Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomatoes- Adding burrata to anything cant be anything but delicious! And knowing that, I, a corndog/bacon LOVER think that this combo will rock anyone's world. Um, hello.....bacon!
Salami with Pesto- the salami was tasty and spicy and together with the homemade pesto was the perfect combo for a warm night. 
I will come back to this restaurant next time I am in town for spring training, hell Ill prob eat here every night Im in town!"}
{"text":"There is NOTHING bad to say about this place - excellent food, great service, all wine $5/ glass in the afternoon. My friends and I always make it a point to dine here (sometimes twice) when we are in the area. Embiance is great, too - roll up doors make it indoor/outdoor seating. Eat here, you won't regret it; in fact you'll thank me!"}
{"text":"Great place to meet for breakfast or lunch. Great variety and very personal service. I especially like the variety and unusual options for snacks, sandwiches and more. Can't beat the prices for beer. Parking can be tough but it's worth the trouble. Can't wait to get back to try something new!"}
{"text":"This is a \"go to\" spot for us. Always. I have never, ever had one complaint about an experience or the food and I have had the pleasure of coming here for 5+ years regularly (weekly?). Great for lunch, happy hour, or dinner. Great for clients, friends or dates. Fabulous ambiance inside (always have fabulous music) or on the patio (Central location is my fave). Love the simple modern decor peppered with mid-century touches.  I've used them for catering and it's been a delight and clients LOVE Postino! Nothing on the menu is the wrong choice, absolutely nothing. Incredible ingredients, impeccably chosen. Favorite Bruschetta choices (you choose 4) are: Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone, Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios, Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese, Brie & Apples with Fig Spread. Yum! Best starters: Pub Board, NYC Grilled Cheese (I die for that mustard), and The Butcher's Block. Favorite salad is the Mixed Greens, better than it sounds! I've been known to come in and just have wine and order the bowl of olives for dinner, they are that good. This is one of my happy places, if you haven't been, you must!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! I sat out on the patio, ordered the bruschetta like usual, and had a glass of pinot noir during their $5 until 5 special."}
{"text":"The bruschetta was good as always, but the artichoke and bean dips were blah and the bread was hard enough to tear up my mouth. We asked for softer French bread they say sure and brought us 3 slices! When asked for more they brought us a bowl of the hard stuff, it was quite frustrating since the service overall was bad for us. We had a server who left right after taking our initial drink order and no new server took us on. We had to flag someone new every time we needed or wanted something since no one came to check on us and that was including our food order.  I plan to stick to the one in central from now on. I've always had excellent service there."}
{"text":"Arizona Golf 
I have used AZ Golf Xpress for several years now to help with tee times on buddy golf trips to Arizona, California and Nevada. I cannot express how pleased I have been with them. Even when changes have occurred unexpectedly they have reacted with professionalism and flexibility.  Their rates for golf in Arizona are hard to beat. Although I have not had the need to use them for accommodations I am sure that is as outstanding with that service as their tee time services."}
{"text":"Love the Postino Arcadia location. If you are in Phoenix and like wine, this is a hidden gem. Located right off of Campbell and  40th. There is a small parking lot and most nights it is Valet. Try the Bruschetta Board or the Proscuitto and Fig sandwich, on Chibatta of course, you will not be disappointed. It's $5 glasses of wine any day (including weekends) until 5pm... did I mention this deal was EVERYDAY?

I also love the ambiance at the Arcadia location, it's what the Central location is just missing a little of. The music is normally alternative and hip, on any given night you will see several patrons using their smartphones to run SoundHound or Shazaam apps to find out what music they are playing.

Since I moved away from Phoenix and down to Tucson I really miss this place, but whenever I am up I make a point to get to Postino. As the bumper sticker says \"Drinking Wine at Lunch is Not a Crime.\" The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars and not 5 is due to parking."}
{"text":"I'll get to the bruschetta, but what you need to know first and foremost is about the paninis. I completely and whole heartedly invest my panini stock into Postino's. I am always left satisfied and with a smile. My top favorite panini i the Roast Beef, which is basically wood roasted beef with aged port salut cheese, onions, and the crispiest pickles ever. My second favorite is the Chicken & Mozzarella, which has grilled chicken with mozzarella, arugula, and spicy sun dried tomato mayo. I'm not a fan of the tomato mayo so I got it with just regular mayo. But hands down you gotta tr the Roast Beef.

If you put in an order of bruschetta, you get to pick 4 categories. My top 4 are White Bean with Chopped Tomato (i thought i was going to hate it, but it actually turned out to be my most favorite now), Warm Artichoke, Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese, and Tomato & Basil.

This place can get kind of loud, but nothing too wild to make me annoyed. The service was friendly, although I will say that I wish they had checked up on us more than just once. Coming by our table asking how everything is while I'm in the middle of my first bite doesn't really count."}
{"text":"What's there not to love about this place? Well, the parking sucks but that's why they entice you with valet. Other than that, on any given Monday or Tuesday, you won't find a better place filled with friendly staff, a collection of mesmerizing characters diversing over delish carbs that would destroy your waistline but then who's counting when you can lock eyes with the hottie across your bottle of wine? At $20 for a bruschetta board and bottle of wine, you really can't go wrong in kicking off your week on a happy note. During the rest of the week, it's good food with the ambience of a quaint spot reserved for good friends over long conversations. Noise level might be challenging for first dates, but I think it's fail proof if all you have is radio silence :)"}
{"text":"I really love this place and it seems like everytime I go it's packed so the word is out on this great wine cafe, the bottom line is get the bruschetta and enjoy your favorite wine with friends in this nice environment for socializing and enjoying your favorite vino."}
{"text":"BEST bruschetta in town!! Great Happy Hour wines by the glass!! Love the vanilla ice cream with warm salted Carmel and corn nuts!! 
Always a great vibe!!"}
{"text":"One word--3 syllables--FAB-U-LOUS

All the best parts of Scottsdale without the annoying snobs!

Party of 4 went yesterday and we had a varied sampling from the menu. Had the olives and pub board as appetizers along with a very nice Spanish red wine that was suggested by the server. The Pub Board was fantastic with Portuguese chorizo, cheese, and a very yummy homemade pretzel. The olives were a really great sampling of many different types and they all complimented our wine well too. 

Hubby had the Autostrada with the potato cheese soup, I had the 9 Iron with soup, friends split the Proscuitto with Brie with chips. All were positively perfect!

For dessert, we ordered a bottle of a white Spanish wine Fuente Milano and it had a nice grapefruity after taste that was very cleansing on the palate before we had the Chocolate Bouchon, the Creme Brulee, and the salted carmel sundae. OMG...all were so yummy and the wine went perfectly!

The nicest part about Postino is that it isn't on a main Scottsdale Rd. drag....it's actually nestled on a side street off of 39th St. and Campbell. You'd never know it was there if you weren't looking for it but apparently plenty of people know about it because it was hopping at noon yesterday.

If you haven't tried it....go. You won't regret it. It was hip, fun, and the food was realistically priced and absolutely DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"I pass this Postino location often but never tried it out. After last night's dust storm, I spent my of today house and pool cleaning. Once I was done, I just wanted to treat myself to a glass or two of wine out and about. I thought I'd give this place a try and happy I did. Service was superb - atmosphere had the same setting as the other fine Postino locations. I enjoyed a glass of Malbec and Tempranillo -- Fabulous! It's the little things in Life. Cheers*** :)"}
{"text":"Oh dear server, will you marry one of my friends?  He was way too charming, very helpful, and patient for someone who was *forced* to serve 8 high maintenance girls from So Cal.  

As far as the food goes, I'd rate this as a 5 for more of a cocktails/hor d'eurves  , and not so much a full dinner.  While there were large portions, it still has the vibe of a cocktail hour that happens before weddings, with more appetizer food.  

3 things you need to know:

-Split the bruchetta and maybe order an appetizer for u two.  $12-13
-My favorite was the smoked salmon bruschetta.  2nd favorite was the apple brie.
-Order the vanilla ice cream topped with salted caramel and...get this..chocolate covered cornuts.  Seriously..,heaven for us women who love the sweet/salty combination. $5.00"}
{"text":"My first dinner in Phoenix turned out to be a very good one thanks to Postino Arcadia. 

It's classy yet casual, good for dinner (if you're more of a snack person) and relaxed despite the more dressy ambience. 

Each bruschetta used what tasted like locally sourced seasonal vegetables. I especially loved the Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomatoes bruschetta (of course, you can never go wrong with BURRATA!). 

The waiter also made an excellent recommendation for beer (dark beer lover speaking). I forget the name but ask for the darkest beer and you won't be disappointed. 

Overall, a refreshing first time dining experience in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"It's safe to say that I have developed a serious love affair with Postino. While both locations are exceptional, the Arcadia version in the old post office has charm that is unmatched. The patio makes you forget that you are in the middle of the desert, the waitstaff is friendly, knowledgeable and fun, and the food...wow. The bruschetta goes unmatched in the Valley and pretty much any other place I've visited. It's so good that I don't bother to order it anywhere else. Nothing compares. The chicken and mozzarella panini has quickly become my favorite sandwich in town. I sub the pesto in for the mayo, and I can't think of anything I'd rather have for lunch. The downfall is the parking situation, but with a little patience or a few dollars for the valet, you'll be seated and enjoying a delicious meal in no time. Whether it's soup inside on a rainy day or a life-changing sandwich on the patio in the springtime, Postino never disappoints."}
{"text":"Postino's is one of my all time favorite restaurants!! They have the yummiest bruschetta, salads, sandwiches, etc.  If you are not a bruschetta person you need to try theirs! My favorites:  ricotta and pistachios, white bean and tomato, Brie apples and fig, bacon buratta...well they are all so good!! 

Go on a Monday or Tuesday after 8pm for Happy Hour and you can choose any bottle of house wine and 4 bruschetta for $20!! The best place for happy hour!! If you are going to go though make sure you are there by 7:30 or 8 at the latest or you won't get a table until after 9 because everyone knows about Postino's Happy Hour and it is legendary!! 

On a side note the raspberry chicken salad is probably the yummiest salad I have ever eaten!!"}
{"text":"Postino = Love. That's all. 

Well, it's far from being \"all,\" considering I could sing it's praises all day, but I'll try to be concise here! 

Service- friendly, laid back and approachable; even when it's busy (which is often- go Postino!) you never get the impression that they're too stressed to answer a question or help you. Always smiling. 

Tremendous value- $5 glasses of wine until 5pm, and one $12.75 board of bruschetta is easily a meal for two - and DELICIOUS. I've yet to order anything else because I simply can't imagine a visit without it!! 

Ambience- reason enough to come back as often as socially acceptable. The industrial rustic interior is full of character and all in all just a wonderful place to be!"}
{"text":"We decided to visit this place while in the area based on all of the strong reviews from our fellow Yelpers.  We went on a Sunday afternoon (right around 12pm) and had no issues with parking.  We scored a spot in front of the restaurant just as someone else was leaving.

The place was fairly busy and our party of two was immediately seated at a low table in the front (right by the acoustic musician).  Postino was well decorated and has a ton of seating options.  We wanted to fall in love with this place but just ended up liking it slightly. 

We ordered the butchers block and the bruschetta plus cucumber lemonade and iced tea.

While everything was okay, I wasn't knocked out of my socks.  My favorite part ended up being the butchers block rather than the bruschetta.  I think the issue that they have is that it is not crispy enough.  The bread was under-toasted and it made for a very chewy experience.  We ordered the Salmon pesto (the smoke flavor is weak and the pesto is strong so it misses there), Burratta, bacon, arugula and tomato (while our waitress claimed this to be her favorite, we were underwhelmed here too.  The bulk of the flavor came from the bacon and the arugula), tomato, basil and mozzarella (my favorite combo done wrong!  There was NO flavor to this and they should have at least provided an olive oil or balsamic drizzle to give it some pop.  The tomatoes weren't fully ripe either and were at the pink stage so they hadn't developed their true tenderness) and Prosciutto, fig and marscapone (by far our favorite since the flavor profile gave us a little bit of sweat, savory and salty).

All-in-all the place wasn't bad.  Based on the reviews though I just expected a wee bit more from my experience here.  I liked that they have live entertainment on the weekend although it makes it hard to hear when you are seated to close.

I saw some folks sitting outside although I am not sure of how they survived in 110 degree weather.  On cooler nights though, I can see that being a nice place to hang.

Oh, I also didn't appreciate having to battle flies for my food.  They kept the door open which meant every critter wanted to beat the eat and join the tables. 

Not sure about returning as I've had this food concept before except with better execution."}
{"text":"I'm having to bump this place, whose food I love, down to three stars after my last visit.  

I took my best friend, visiting from out of town, here, because I love the food some much.  I wound up feeling like an idiot for talking it up so much.

We got seated quickly, and were given water.  The waiter asked us if we'd like drinks while waiting for my partner, and I ordered an iced tea. That was the second to last time we saw him.  

10 minutes later, still waiting for my partner, and for my iced tea.

Finally, she showed up, and he came back to take our order. Still no iced tea -- he told me it was on the way.  We ordered.

My soup came out first (I had wanted it WITH my grilled cheese), and finally, 30 minutes after having sat down, I got my iced tea.

The food, as always, was amazing. The veg friendly broccoli cheddar soup was soup-er tasty (haha...sorry, it's early), and as usual, the bruschetta and paninis were good too.

The problem arouse when we wanted to leave. My bestie wanted a box for her other half of her sandwich, and our server was no where to be found. Upon further look, he was seated at a table at the back of the restaurant. Now, when I used to work in the service industry, even if you were going on break, you'd either finish your tables first, or hand them to another server and let your tables know. He did neither.

We flagged down not one, not two, but THREE different people trying to get a box and our bill.  The table next to us, who sat after us, got both their dessert AND their bill before we could even get ours. All three people we asked said they'd bring box and bill right out; no dice.  FINALLY, we got the bill. It took another 5 or 6 minutes to get the cards back to sign.

My friend, while she loved the food, was surprised I'd recommended a place with such poor service.  I explained it had never been that way before.  Regardless, it's going to be a little while before I go back; I don't usually have 90+ minutes to waste."}
{"text":"Came here twice and loving it. Great place to take friends out for drinks And chill. Or on a hip date.awesome  food and price. Favorite is the smoke salmon brushetta."}
{"text":"Such a happening place with so little service.  Lots of neighborhood restaurants pour your bottle of wine for the table and refresh glasses. Similar establishments, with great ambience, also ask if you would would like another bottle. This Postino's service does not and their bottles aren't cheap. 

Granted, plenty of servers milling around.  Bored support clean off tables but forget to wipe off chairs and at least one appears literally stoned.

I guess the real question is why the server recorks the bottle with a temporary cork after the first and only service pour. Doesn't the Red wish to breath?

There were a few service highlights: tastes of the wines freely offered and a quick response for heat for any desert rats (hey! It's 60 degrees, brr.)

Butcher block is always a highlight and I won't give up on this fun place just yet. It simply needs some good floor management."}
{"text":"If I lived close to here, this would be my neighborhood spot. Heck, I would buy a house in this neighborhood just so Postino could be my spot.

I visited twice during a 1 week trip to Scottsdale. Sunday brunch was excellent... great coffee, beautiful dog friendly patio, very friendly staff. We ordered a variety of bruschetta, and they kindly allowed me to swap ricotta for goat cheese on one. We also ordered an egg scramble, which was tasty and healthy. 

I had such a great time that I stopped for a quick lunch the next day. Even the simple Arnold Palmer drink there was excellent, and the tuna Niçoise salad was to die for. 

They'll see me again... I'm moving in."}
{"text":"The Monday and Tuesday deal of $20 bottle of wine and bruschetta is amazing. The selection of bruschetta is great and my bf and I have tried (and liked) most of them!!  I will say the only reason I'm giving this place four stars is because the wait staff is really rude. No effort to smile or be kind to customers."}
{"text":"The bruschetta was amazing. The pretzel plate was also good. I enjoyed the alboriño wine."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY AMAZEBALLZ.  This is the place my \"girlz\" and I go when we want to get out and have great food. LOVE LOVE LOVE their brushetta and the chicken raspberry salad. OMG!"}
{"text":"Bruschetta...Wine
The options to choose for your bruschetta are terrific!  And they are the best in town!  The wine selections are terrific!  Great service and very reasonable prices.  What is not to like.

{"text":"I truly love Postino Arcadia! I visit this spot often to enjoy their gorgeous patio. The food is consistently good and you can choose from a delicious variety. My favorite bruschetta pieces are the prosciutto, fig and jam, the ricotta with dates and pistachio and the goat cheese and peppers. Delicious! If the mood is striking in the direction of a salad, go for the chicken walnut salad. It doesn't disappoint! Happy hour is daily from 11-5pm with $5 glasses of wine. Tuesday nights you can get a board of bruschetta and a bottle of wine for $20. This is a great deal! Cheers!"}
{"text":"I may be alone in this, but I think the above ratings, more than anything else, are about the way a restaurant makes you feel. Postino makes me feel like I've enjoyed an evening out, like I've gotten full on yummy food made from quality ingredients, and *almost* like I don't miss New York (my home for the past 6 years). The atmosphere is lively and the service has always been friendly and attentive. The pub board and bruschetta (esp prosciutto & fig) are delicious and cut into portions perfect for sharing. Go with friends, enjoy the wine list, don't over-order on the food, and Postino will make you feel good, too."}
{"text":"Okay; this place is pretty dang tasty and their most popular dishes are the Bruschetta! How can little pieces of bread with an assortment of toppings can be so amazing? 

To name a few:
Ricotta with dates & pistachios: The cheese is not over powering and the date gives it the sweetness whereas the pistachios give it a nice crunch. 

Prosciutto with figs & mascarpone: Luckily it was fig season because you can never go wrong with prosciutto and figs! 

Salmon and pesto: It's something that everyone usually gets but honestly this was kind of a disappointment. The salmon was a bit thin and I didn't like it with the pesto. 

Brie & Apples with fig spread: Brie is literally the tastiest cheese. buttery, sweet and crunchy from the apple (another favorite) 

The bruschetta does change occasionally but they keep some of the popular ones on the menu. Great place to hang out with your friends and drink wine from their extensive wine bar."}
{"text":"The turkey panini was delicious and the service was good.  It also helped that Walt Richardson was performing. All and all a great treat."}
{"text":"Yep, I loved it! Friends from school have raved about it and it is all that they said it would be!! Perfect bruschetta, yummy salad shared with a friend, and a cozy place to sit! The apple, honey, and Brie bruschetta brought a tear to my eye, I know that is weird.,......but omg, yum!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Postino's - the atmosphere, the food, the wine. I give it 5 stars because the atmosphere and service is amazing - friendly, refreshing, fun. The bruschetta is awesome, of course!"}
{"text":"I definitely see why this place has such great reviews... not only is their service impeccable but their food is always amazing. if you just want a great sandwich and a fresh salad or a glass of wine and a meat/cheese platter... this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Patio dreams are made here. Summer is upon us here in Phoenix and postino does not disappoint when it comes to patio game. 

Misters, shade, cozy tables and tons of added greenery to create a private space to have a snack. This specific trip we stopped just to have their bruschetta board. We got an assortment of different flavors and also got the veggie board too. Both were exactly what we needed. The veggies were fresh. The hummus - I don't know what they did to it but it was divine!  

I typically only do water but today I tried the cucumber lemonade and wow talk about refreshing on a hot day. Warning it is not free refills and you will want more so just be ready for that come bill time. 

A great relaxing opportunity thanks Postino!"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant in a wonderful setting. Perfect neighborhood hangout that is by far our favorite Postino location.

The grilled cheese and bruschetta are always good choices to go with the reasonably-priced drinks.

Service was attentive and courteous."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, all with a whole bunch of friends and we are loud so I forgive the waiter for forgetting to bring extra dressing or my soup. I WUV this place. I really REALLLLLLY love this place. Their tomato bisque soup is divine. I can't wait to go again and then to LGO for dessert! WOOT WOOT!"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere and the food. Not a fan of beer or wine as my only options. And I hate forced valet parking. If it weren't for the forced valet parking I would visit more often."}
{"text":"Wine, bruschetta, friends, and Yelp was how I spent my Labor Day here at Postino's! I had the cabernet and tried four different types of bruschetta, which were all amazing (not a huge fan of the artichoke spread), but still loved them! $5 wine before 5 p.m. so make sure to head in early! 

It had a very relaxed, chill atmosphere and comfortable seating options where you could choose table, high tops, booths, or even couches. Music was a bit loud, but still enjoyed the vibe. 

Jet really made the experience here excellent. He took his time to give us the history of the restaurants and the management behind them. He gave us great recommendations of other restaurants under the same ownership that happen to be next on my list to try!"}
{"text":"Great place for a quiet evening with friends.  good wine and unpricy selections.

we were hungry and gotten the half soup and sandwich combos which were all good and nicely prepared.  the portions are not too tiny too.

I like the ambience here very much and it reminds me of how kazmeriz in downtown scottsdale used to be, before it got famous.  so dun swamp this place with your wannabe friends :)  bring nice people okay :)"}
{"text":"I love this place! I've been to this location several times and have yet to be disappointed. They have $5 glasses of wine until 5pm everyday (sangria on sundays) . The food is delicious!! Service is great and they always have good music playing!"}
{"text":"Cannot find better bruschetta in the Valley

I heart carbs.  You can get four choices (out of twelve), cut into fourths.  The apple and brie not sound great, but it's flavors work in harmony and is delicious  Don't feel like bruschetta? Try the Butcher's Block, a Cheese Board, or The Bounty for you crudités loving fiends.  They also have paninis, soups, salads, and dessert.  To be noted, they also offer gluten-free bread for an upcharge.  Wine, beer, mimosas, and bellinis are served so have a drink while you eat.  If you're not into booze, I hear their Honey Cucumber Lemonade is refreshing.

All in all, I love Postino's.  It has become a great Tuesday night hangout spot and the Sunday brunches are worth checking out as well."}
{"text":"I go here every so often on Sundays for sangria with my girls. It's a nice escape and a prime location for shopping. Bruschetta is a must, I also really enjoy their tuna sandwich. The reggae on Sunday happens to be great, and yes, the dude who plays with dreads down to the floor? Those are real."}
{"text":"I got the Autostrada on ciabatta and she got the Brie and prosciutto on ciabatta.  We each had a fresh squeezed peach Bellini.   Everything was very fresh and tasty.  The service was good.  Larger water glasses might make it so the server didn't have to visit the table every 5 minutes, but that is more their issue than mine.  It was a post office when I was a kid, and now it is a great restaurant.  Sitting outside for lunch on a beautiful day was a treat."}
{"text":"What a wonderful afternoon.  The service was fantastic, and very helpful with the wine selection.  I now have a new favorite wine...Zweigelt by Berger.  Yummy.  And the Bruchetta, how could I forget about that.  I had the smoked salmon and Pesto and the Artichoke spread, sooooo tasty.  I have been thinking about that salmon ever since.  I would absolutely go back to Postino, and so should you."}
{"text":"Postino will forever be my favorite wine bar outside of California , I am 100% convinced of this fact. Having lived in the PHX area permanently now for a few years, I can honestly say that Postino has set the standard on the bruschetta bar.. and it is high very hard to find one that compares! I have not found any other place that even comes close on the bruschetta variety and taste scale . For $14 you can get four different bruschettas that are generous and on the perfectly, freshly baked bread.. not soggy and not too crisp! I actually don't have a favorite one and I like that Postino has a seasonal bruschetta now that changes from the usual. It's always fun as a group to order all of the bruschettas amongst a few boards and sample them all! The cheese board is always good; the salads you can't go wrong with , either. Monday's and Tuesday's after 8pm, bring your date or your friends and $20 gets you bruschetta and a bottle of vino! Or how about brunch for $5 mimosas or sangria on the weekend ? I've also ordered catering from Postino and they always get it correct! Sometimes I just NEED that amazing bruschetta variety in my home for entertaining ! This is always my favorite place for a date night with my new hubby. I introduced him to wine, ( okay not really!!)  and thus, Postino Arcadia being in my old pre-marital hood, we cultivated some of our 3 years together right here in Arcadia at this very Postino.. and if wine isn't your thing, don't worry, they have a great selection of brews! After wine there are lovely, yummy desserts or for brunch , Postino offers cappuccinos and lattes. The patio is dog friendly and the ambience is all lit dimly with candlelight and hip beats for your sipping. Since this is about my 9000th review for Postino, I think it's safe to say, I rate it on the highest PHENOM level!"}
{"text":"Also on my sweltering trip to Phoenix I visited this place.  My good friend's brother is one of the bartenders (Sam) so we had to check it out. 
Sat at the bar for a late afternoon lunch.  Started off with a glass of champagne just because I was on vacation and I could :)   We also had some champagne mixers they were making specially that day that were really nice.
I had some trouble deciding what to eat since the menu all looks so tasty but i went with the bruchetta.  I mean, come on, you get to choose 4 toppings, how could I not!  I even had a hard time choosing only 4!  I had the apple with brie and fig spread (my favorite), roasted red pepper with goat cheese (very good), prosciutto with figs and marscapone (wow) and salami with pesto (great).  All of this for $12 and HUGE!  Four heaping pieces of bread cut into four pieces each.  My friend also got the roasted artichoke one which was just as delicious.  
Three glasses of champagne and more bruschetta than I could possibly eat I was extremely satisfied.  
I've been actually thinking lately...where can I get this delicious food in LA?"}
{"text":"Bruschetta: it's good. 

Wine Drinkers: Unite. 

Pompests: Make yourselves at home. 

Weather: Open air seating. Mmmm. 

Parking: Lick me somewhere inappropriate. 

This place is ok. It kinda reminds me of My Florist, only tolerable. But tolerable's not fair. It's actually quite good. If you're a snob. 

My friend Georgie pointed out to me recently that I only give back-handed compliments. Sometimes, one must smack around those we love, lest the measure of worth in their own hearts finds too giant a perch."}
{"text":"Went to Postino Arcadia. Enjoyed Postino Arcadia. I would say GO to Postino Arcadia! You cant go wrong with any combo of the bruchetta and the Nine Iron is one of my all time favorite sandwiches anywhere"}
{"text":"This has always been one of my favorite neighborhood spots and today I walked into the bar and I thought it was reserved since each spot had a  formal place setting and linen napkins. Felt like going home and changing my chuck Taylor's to dress shoes.  I also noticed that most of the entire staff I know is gone  besides one of my favorite people here Todd. I hope this is not a sign of things to come."}
{"text":"Do they need another review? No but this way my friends can just look at my reviews and know where to go. Always great, lunch or dinner. I really want to try sangria Sunday brunch, gotta find a good baby sitter. If you go get the bruschetta board, among your choices make sure to include roasted red peppers and goat cheese. I like the proscuito and fig too. Apple and brie make the cut too. The pub board is awesome too. Great place for a date if you get those anymore."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! They have amazing food.. Love the Bruschetta plate. It's very filling and great for 2! Make it an evening, enjoy some wine, very cool place to hang out!"}
{"text":"Cute little spot. Great wine! Amazing happy hour! Attentive servers. Very quick valet. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I recently moved my business to the area and finally checked out this Postino's. Great atmoshpere, decor and patio. I had a salad, wine and shared a happy hour app. Parking seemed limited but that is the area. Would definitely make this a regular meeting spot!"}
{"text":"I love this place! One of the best restaurants in Phoenix with a great atmosphere. The bruschetta is by far the best I have ever had - and I have had a lot of burschetta!"}
{"text":"We went to Postino Arcadia to celebrate a friend's birthday. This place isn't the ideal place for large groups, but they found us a real comfortable spot for around 12 people. The menu has a great selection of sandwiches, bruschetta platters and wine. Although the wine selection varies between different postino restaurants, they have amazing deals on specific days of the week. I would definitely recommend this restaurant for a relaxed evening dinner with friends and family."}
{"text":"I've only been here once but it was love at first bite (and sip).

A cute wine bar reportedly set in an old Post Office- hence POSTino, but is not apparent with the trendy decor and lively yet intimate atmosphere perfect for a date or group of friends. 

The Happy Hour on Tuesday really is a steal. I came on a double date, each couple ordering a bottle of wine and bruschetta (arguably pronounced brush-ket-ah) totaling a mere $20 a pair!

The wine selection is fairly eclectic. The BF and I rather arbitrarily picked the Carro Red Blend from Spain, a \"Postino Exclusive\". When it came to the taste test the waitress did not assume the man would decide and let me taste for satisfaction (yes- I felt empowered). Fantastico! Perfect mix of smooth with a kick that's not too bitey or intense. 

The bruschetta came in generous portions of 4x4, 4 slices of 4 different selections, the perfect amount of food to complement half a bottle of wine. Each was amazing but the gold medal goes to the White Bean and Chopped Tomato. The savory, sweet and tangy flavors will make your tastebuds dance for joy. 

TIP: avoid the crowd by arriving before 6:30 or after 8:30. Our 7:00 arrival left us waiting 40 min for a table but my 4 stars says it was well worth it!"}
{"text":"I sat at the bar. Ordered the sangria (very good), and the bruschetta. Live music on Sundays for lunch is amazing. The roasted peppers with goat cheese bruschetta, and the apples, brie, and fig spead AMAZING. It was a perfect brunch."}
{"text":"AWESOME place to just hang out with friends and have a drink.. Great environment.. Incredible service!  Cannot go wrong here!!"}
{"text":"Postino is my restaurant spirit animal. Their $20 board&bottle deal is AMAZING - the only hard part is choosing which bruschetta! My personal favorite is the apple and brie, but my boyfriend looooves the gluten-free ricotta with dates and pistachios. 

The atmosphere is amazing, and the service is friendly. Be sure to try the salted caramel sundae for desert, it's a can't miss!"}
{"text":"Fabulous Bruschetta boards, gotta get a monthly Postino's fix!  The Gilbert Postinos is great, too, but wait time can be LOOOOONG.."}
{"text":"Really good for happy hour, look up which days of the week and hours they have specials happening, because there are a lot. The bruschetta is really big, while generally an appetizer it can be too big for one person to eat as a meal (and has so many different and diverse choices!)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places of Phoenix!

Although I often clown on Scottsdale and their wannabe NYC / SF spots, Postino's is definitely a place I will return to on my next visit to the desert.

Set in an old, renovated Post Office, the dark decor and hundreds of candles set the mood. We were fortunate enough to score the large couch set into the  corner of the cafe when another party didn't show. Our server was fantastic, and the manager was extremely helpful with our wine selection.

Des and I had a bottle of their house Cab, Pennyfarthing, which was so good we bought a bottle to go! We also had a sampler of their famous bruschetta, which was exquisite! The boast a variety of bruschettas, and we tried 4 of them; apple/date/brie, tomato/mozzarella/basil, salami/pesto, and classic.

Unbelievable!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to this Postino location probably 10 times now and I am definitely a fan! I've been in for lunch, which is a bit of a different vibe than after dark. I think the service is better at lunch, probably because they are less busy. Either way, the wine selection and food are great. I agree with other reviewers that the $20, Monday & Tuesday nights, after 8pm deal is awesome! You get 4 bruschetta & and a bottle of wine for only $20! The vibe of this place at night is neat. It's dark, & dimly lite with tea light candles. There are a few comfortable sofas, high top tables, regular tables, and a great patio outside. It has a very intimate feel and would be a great place for a date. It does get very busy & crowded in the evening so keep that in mind. There is usually a wait on Mondays & Tuesdays after 8pm. Service gets a little slow during their busy times. My favorite bruschetta is Brie & Apples with Fig Spread. It is very sweet! If you're desiring a salad the Raspberry Chicken salad is great. Very flavorful! I also really like the Turkey Panini, very tasty! The only bad thing I can say about this place is the parking is awful! More often than not, you'll end up having to valet your car because there is very little parking."}
{"text":"I have liked the food I've had here, a panini sandwich, bruschetta, and some desserts. 

But I'm a pretty casual kind of girl, and as a result I get the feeling that I'm not hip enough for Postino. Last time I was there I got a pretty frosty attitude from the server, but  when they realized I knew the manager they had a miraculous change of attitude. 

Anyway, I haven't been back since, mainly because I don't want to have to ask for management, just to see a friendly face, the second I step through the door."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience here.  They have a great happy hour and I will drive for miles to order Postino's bruchetta.  I'm a fan for life!"}
{"text":"Postino is a local favorite, and for good reason! Their food is always top-notch and the atmosphere is casual and fun. If you come in for the bruschetta board and wine night, prepare to wait, but know that it will be worth it! (It's a great deal, and everyone that's tried it comes back for more..) Brunch there is my favorite, and on a Saturday, it's not too crowded. $5 glasses of wine, pitchers of beer, mimosas and bellinis make it a reasonable meal, and the food is incredible! If it's your first visit, absolutely try the bruschetta (it's a LOT of food to order 4). My fave is a tie between the prosciutto + fig and the bacon + tomato. They're so delicious, you can't go wrong!! The paninis are well-made, hot and (like everything at Postino...) fresh! I love the turkey one with a small salad instead of chips.

If the food doesn't make you smile, the polite and prompt service will! We already can't wait to go back and dine with them again soon."}
{"text":"We're probably the only people in town who haven't been to either Postino's. I don't know why it took us so long, but it won't be long before we go back, that's for sure. If you like wine, or even if you're not sure you like wine, you have to try this place. Huge variety and knowledgeable staff. Plus the food is delicious and the atmosphere relaxing and inviting.

The afternoon we stopped in for lunch we ordered the half Panini and soup combo. Both the vegetarian and the Tuscan tuna sandwiches were really, really good. The bruschetta's that others nearby ordered all looked incredible - gotta come back for that!

If you enjoy Spanish wine, the Lechuza is very nice."}
{"text":"I totally 100% agree w Serianna T.

I have felt the same way about the seating, and parking and mediocre foods... Postino and LGO are complete cluster F***s for anyone who plans on driving there. I also feel like the general atmosphere is trying so hard to be relaxed and casual that it is stressful for the guests."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere.  I suggest the \"take two\" lunch option.  I had the chicken salad with raspberry vinaigrette and roastbeef panini.  Both were great.  Service was friendly!"}
{"text":"Good bruschetta and sandwiches. $5 wines by the glass til 5 pm. Great for people watching. Friendly and knowledgeable staff. Cool wines by the glass and bottle. Unique wines to take home too."}
{"text":"I've been to Postino a few times, but as we all know it is a violation of Yelp TOS to review an establishment until you've been drunk there. What? It's not? Well, I would consider it in poor taste.

I got drunk at Postino last night and had a wonderful time. The $20 Bruschetta Board and Bottle of Wine promotion they have Mondays and Tuesdays is a ridiculous steal. I didn't want to be the alcey to ask if that deal was limited to one-per-table as I was fully planning on consuming my own bottle of wine and possibly my own board of bruschetta. Luckily the guys across the bar had the same plan, so I didn't have to. FYI: It is illegal for restaurants to serve you your own bottle of wine. Don't ask how I know. I just know. However, you can split 3 or 4 with one other person and nobody says anything. Don't ask how I know this either. I just know. 

All of the different bruschetta options are fantastic. The Prosciutto one tasted like Cinnamon Toast to me. That may have been the booze talking. Considering I kept referring to it as \"Cinnamon Toast Crunch\", I'm going to go ahead and say it was. The roasted red pepper & goat cheese and the apple & brie were equally delicious. Sorry, I don't have a breakfast cereal comparison for them. 

To top it off, the service is fan-freaking-tastic. Everyone is extremely helpful and seems genuinely HAPPY  that you are there spending money. Clearly, from a business standpoint, this should be a given, but more often than not it isn't. Once I was there with a girl whose recently adopted Greyhound was somehow prompted to dart across the patio like a bat out of hell, knocking over chairs and wine glasses along the way. Not only was the staff RIDICULOUSLY nice about it, a few of the valet guys actually CHASED AFTER this greyhound and I'm pretty sure one of them got into his car to find it. The staff literally organized an impromptu search party for a dog that could run upwards of 60 MPH. That is some damn good service. And, we found the dog."}
{"text":"I have been going to Postino for years and they have the most consistent food and service you will find anywhere in the Valley.  I often get cravings for their Mediterranean salad and bruschetta.  Oh, don't forget the olives, too!"}
{"text":"You're an idiot if you rate this place any less than 5 stars.  The bruchetta, ambiance, and great beer makes this place ideal to pull up to on a weekend afternoon around 3:30 and have the perfect late lunch with an afternoon buzz.  No matter what time of day you come, there are always hungry people talking happily while stuffing tasty noshes in their mouths.  Finish the day off by going over to La Grand Orange for  a quick shop around, maybe a pizza, and a bottle of wine for later that night once the buzz has worn off."}
{"text":"crap. Most everything they do is typical Phoenix borefest shit. They are a wannabe establishment brining in folks who I would rather not spend my time next to. Look at my Postino Central review, same shit different spot. Blah. If there is somewhere else to go, go! This place is full pretentious  douchebags. It's hard to get away from in PHX but I think this is the HQ. Food is mediocre. Service is barely mediocre, servers are snots like the rest of the crowd and I can't ever hear what anyone is saying cause its so fucking loud and obnoxious in there. I have been to much better places in phoenix compared to this freakin joint."}
{"text":"Bomb af but snobby waiters they literally act like they can't wait to turn your table lol"}
{"text":"I love this place.  I love the location.  I love the food and the wine specials.  I especially love the brochette.  Yep, its pretty great there...."}
{"text":"OMG. These are not the boring bruschetta that you are used to. Fresh, quality meats and cheeses on fresh ciabatta bread. Between the 3 of us we split 8 different ones. Along with a great bottle of wine, 2 glasses of dessert wine, a creme brûlée and coffee, we were all satisfied, and all for under $100 total! I've had $500 dinners that weren't as satisfying. The manager overheard us mentioning that my brother and his wife met here on their first date and we were treated to Prosecco on the house. Great experience, AWESOME food and excellent wines, left me happy without spending a fortune. Alyvia, you would love this place!"}
{"text":"I was left with a good impression after my first time there. We went on a Tuesday and it was still pack at night. Very small parking, but there was compliment valet parking. 
The valet parking guy was also very friendly. The low-lighting environment seem to be a great get-together place for group of friend or even a date. 

I'm not much of a wine drinker, but we order Moscato and I like it! I also love the bruschettas there, especially the salmon one. They also have a variety of sandwiches that you can order from that will make you quite full after a few bite. 

I would definitely come back to this place. ^_^"}
{"text":"REVIEW IS FOR DESSERT, DECOR AND SERVICE ONLY

My friend, Peter, that I manage a restaurant with in San Diego, suggested that I stop here. He used to work at the joint and said that it is amazing. 

When my friend and I arrived at the door the hostess said that it would be an hour and fifteen minutes for a table, on a TUESDAY! WOW! That says a lot about this place. Instead of waiting we just grabbed a side table in the lounge and had the most Amazeballz Salted Caramel Sundae!

Our server was prompt with waters and our order. I went to the bar to meet Josh, the bartender. I told him that I was friends with Peter and he said that he was expecting me to come in. He said that this was a slow night! HA! Josh seemed like a really nice guy and a fun person to have serve you. 

I love the open concept, eclectic mix of music, hip scene and beautiful crowd.  

I'm telling you what, if I ever moved to Phoenix I'd love to work at this place! As an experienced industry person, I could tell that this place has it's shit together. :-)"}
{"text":"Went in tonight to eat dinner at the bar. I had a couple of beers - the beer selection is limited, but respectable. Great considering it's a wine bar! Service was just okay. The bartender was helpful enough, but I had to sort of flag him down when I needed something - he never really checked in with me. Not a dea-lbreaker, but nothing outstanding.

 I ordered the bruchetta (one each of the apple and brie, prosciutto and fig, burrata and bacon, and warm artichoke). The bruschetta was incredible. I'd go back just to eat it all again. Maybe tomorrow.

Parking was open and available when I got there, but it looked like it was exclusively valet starting at about 5pm."}
{"text":"Just as amazing as the last time I came. I keep forgetting about the $20 bruschetta and wine days on Monday and Tuesday. We had the bruschetta board again this time and ordered the artichoke spread, almond hummus, apple and Brie, and the spicy and sweet goat cheese one. Alll amazing! Also had a Bellini to go with it. The Bellini is pretty good, just gets too sweet at the end of it. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"l love the bruschetta - sometime I will just get an order to go and eat it for dinner! 

The restaurant itself is really cute and trendy - I love the decor! 

I would have given 5 stars but sometime it gets a little noisy in there and a little hard to hear but other than that it is a fantastic place! 

This is probably not a good place for kids! If you want to bring your kids to go LGO!"}
{"text":"Ooh la la!  I came here for a quick bite before getting on a plane.  The atmosphere is really cool - nice outdoor seating area, high tables, low tables, and a couple of booths tucked away.  The service was also very pleasant, with the waitress both attentive and friendly.

As for the food, I went for the bruschetta.  It's about $13 for four pieces, and I thought that it would be four small toast rounds.  Boy was I wrong - it's a meal in itself.  Each bruschetta is about the size of a hand and cut into four manageable strips.  I tried the tomato/mozzarella/basil (my usual standby), brie/apple/fig and ricotta/dates/pistachio.  Although I was afraid of the more \"adventurous\" ones, I wound up liking the ricotta and brie bruschetta even more than the tomato/mozzarella one, which totally held its own.  The quality of the food was great and the combinations were somewhat inventive but also worked really well together.  

If I'm ever back in Phoenix I'll make sure to visit this location (or its other outpost where a buddy of mine saw the McCains)."}
{"text":"This is going to be short and sweet.... The bruschetta is one of the best around. I luv the idea of 4 different flavors on one plate. A couple of my favorites are the proscuitto and fig and the goat cheese and tomato jam. So so so...so good. The paninis are just as scrumptious. I am partial to salty and sweet flavors mixed so I go with the proscuitto and fig jam one and it always hits the spot. But, with all that said... my favorite thing at Postinos...the one thing I can not leave without eating even if I have just stuffed myself into an uncomfortable food coma... is the salted caramel sundae. OMG... ice cream with think, rich, buttery, and a hint of saltyness caramel...the little bites of chocolate covered pretzels. Holy cow... it might be on the list of possibilitys for my last meal."}
{"text":"Whats not to LOVE! A valley staple, and a must try anytime you are in the area"}
{"text":"Postino is an essential spot to check out if you are, or ever plan to be in the Vally. 

Bruschetta. Panini. Meat. Cheese. Bread. Wine. Beer. Can you dig it? Do you have a pulse? 

Try to make it during the time they have the special for a bottle of wine and bruschetta board for $20. If you are reading this review right now you probably have the ability to find out when that is, so do it, because I can't remember. 

The Bruschetta board comes with 4 types of bruschetta, you have to order this. I have tried all of them and each is great in its own way but, you must have the Brie & Apples - to die for. 

Get the Nine Iron panini. 

The cheese board is my favorite appetizer. 

Any or all of that with a Hop Knot and you might just forget you are on planet Earth."}
{"text":"Postino is one of my FAVORITE restaurants I have ever been to.  I always make sure to be very hungry when I go.  I can't say enough good things about it so I will try to be as concise as possible.

My friends and I usually go on Friday and Saturday nights and it is understandably busy.  We all usually grab a delicious glass of wine and don't mind the short wait at all.  I cannot say enough nice things about the staff here.  They are always very polite, friendly, and conscious of getting us seated as soon as possible.

We always order one or two planks of bruschetta to start out.  I have had them all and love them equally.  To follow that I usually order the prosciutto and brie panini.  All the ingredients taste so fresh and the bread is equally delicious (I have to admit I am picky about bread, coming from San Francisco sourdough land) I have to admit that all the food and wine fill me up so I have never tried their desserts but I am sure they are amazing as well.

The food is amazing.  The service could not be better.  The ambiance is nice and casual. The price is more than reasonable.  I have no criticisms for this restaurant and encourage everyone to go!"}
{"text":"Great glass of Zin.  Wonderful ambiance and decor."}
{"text":"LOVE the Tuscan Tuna panini! Great creme brulee as well! The atmosphere is great, super convenient location and free valet! I look forward to making this place a frequent lunch stop."}
{"text":"Third time is definitely a charm. 

First time: I had a gift certificate, tried the panini and an awesome selection of red wine I can't remember. After hearing so many great things about Postino, I was quite disappointed that night. My panini was just.   Yup. just. 

Second time: I came here with a friend and it was his first time. Since it was our 3rd stop for happy hour that night, it was a bit hazy. 

Third time: I decided to try this place again with my brother and my sorority sister who needed a ride to the airport. We did the bruschetta, and bottle of wine for $20, and it more than made up for my first experience here. The Grayson was such a good cabernet selection. My brother even bought another bottle to take home for our dad's birthday. It's also $9 off any bottle you buy to take home. We ordered our board of 4 bruschetta, and although they made a mistake on two, they made it up to us by bringing out the original two we ordered, so we tried 6 different bruschettas. They were all different, ranging from sweet to savory, but none of them were bad. 

The service here is really awesome, and it's consistently good. I can't wait to come back to try the other bruschetta flavors!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Postino. I come here often with my girlfriends for lunch or bring my our of town friends for a nice hangout, $5 glass of wine at lunch and brochette to die for. Really, the best lunch in town. 

Service is always on top of it and friendly. Really outstanding. 

My one note was my last experience - I came in Saturday and had a very unpleasant experience with the valet manager -  Logan. He was being so rude and short with us we almost left ! All we asked was - since when they block all the spot when you turn in to Postino Arcadia as it used to be available to self part. 
If this was my first time coming to Postino - I probably would have... It was still great once we went it. As always is :-)"}
{"text":"Love, love this place.  Great wine selection and very tasty food (Bruschetta!)."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. The food is always fantastic! Try the bruschetta board for sure, and usually the seasonal option is great. We went there last night and the service is simply amazing. My water was full the entire time I was there and the food came out very quickly. We arrived around 6pm and they were decently busy, but we didn't wait for a table which is nice. We have been to the Monday/Tuesday 8pm special before and that gets extremely busy. Make sure you arrive a little before 8 and you will probably wait a bit for a table but it's worth it! A board of bruschetta and a bottle of wine for $20... can't beat that anywhere! Maybe one of the best aspects of this restaurant is that they do not upcharge bottles of wine 90% like many others do. The bottle is 3x the glass price, pretty great if you ask me!"}
{"text":"Postinos is nothing less than F-A-N-T-A-S-T-I-C. I've only been here twice and as a matter of fact, this is as good as it gets!

My first time was a few months back. We ordered a bottle of wine, the bruschetta and some paninis. Everything was great. The service is a little slow but the food/ambience definitely makes up for it. The next time, I took a few friends along for the $20 wine+bruschetta Tuesday and we had a blast. We also noticed that the place is packed on the deal days so get there earlier than 8pm if you don't wanna wait in line.
This place is awesome, can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I know my 2 girlfriends that absolutely LOVE this place will balk at my 4 stars instead of 5. But honestly, I think this place is slightly overrated. Don't get me wrong, I like this place, and I oblige them every time they want to go, but I think 4 stars is just right for the rating. 

We went there this weekend, and the typical scenario went down. Parking was cramped (lucked out to get a \"valet\" spot which I parked into myself as it was right out front by the entrance - no I'm not waiting for you Mr. Valet Dude to get into my car and pull it forward into the spot right in front of my face, thank you very much), and there was a short wait (maybe 10-15 minutes). We sat outside, which wasn't ideal since it was cold and drizzly, but we had patio heaters on both sides of our table so it was OK. 

Sadly we didn't make their $5 wine special, which ends at 5pm, so we were paying full price for the glasses of wine - ranging from $8 to about $12-13. I don't know about you, but I really am not a fan of paying $10 for a glass of wine when I can pay that for an entire bottle. But alas, I had 2 different wines through the course of the night, both on recommendation from the servers, and both decent. 

We ordered the infamous bruschetta, with the 4 choices being: smoked salmon (YUM!), warm artichoke (tasty), roasted red pepper (still good), and white bean with tomato (OK, but nothing to write home about). 

For dinner, I had the half & half combo (where you get to choose 2 different items), and I chose the mixed green salad (REALLY delicious, with an awesome combination of greens, pears, grapes, gorgonzola cheese, pecans, & poppyseed dressing) and half of a turkey/pesto pannini. The pannini was QUITE boring. Didn't have much flavor at all. I think it was lacking on the pesto. 

And honestly, this is what I come to expect at Postino. Some things are just unbelievable and you want to lick your plate clean, and other things are simply boring and tasteless (like the white bean/tomato bruschetta and the turkey/pesto pannini). 

And hence my rating of 4 stars rather than 5. If the parking was easier, the wines were always $5 a glass, and the food was consistent, I would give it 5 stars. Fair enough?  :)"}
{"text":"Love me some Postino. The only problem is, so does everyone else and the wait can at times be excruciating. This restaurant serves up some of the tastiest bruschetta in town, which appeals to the masses. Seriously, it's hard for me to eat bruschetta anywhere else because of how amazing it is at Postino.

They've also got some other good items on the menu like paninis, salads, and a variety of appetizers - I'd recommend the cheese board and/or the olives to start.

Mondays & Tuesdays you'll need to get here early because they dish out the deal of $20 for a bottle of wine and a bruschetta board. The wait will easily be an hour if you get here late in the evening, not to mention the parking situation here is less than ideal.

A great place for some casual conversation, a bottle of wine, and delicious food...but it's good to catch them at lunch or off peak hours when the whole neighborhood isn't in line to grab a table."}
{"text":"I joined a friend for lunch here last week and we were able to sit outside and enjoy our perfect weather.

We both had the Pick 2 special.  I had the salad and soup.  Soup (chicken &n rice) was perfect temperature and had great flavor.  Salad was fresh and I was able to pick from their long list of salad choices. 
I LOVE THAT. Many places will match your soup up with a plain side salad, not here!
 
My friend had a scrumptious looking vegetable panini on ciabatta bread  with a side salad.  

The other great thing about Postino's is their early Happy Hour.  Any, I repeat any, glass of wine is $5 until 5:00pm.  They have an extensive wine list with some great choices. 

The ambiance here, well if you haven't been you are sorely missing out.  I love the old brick style building surrounded by lush flora.  The decor is modern yet comfy.  Don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"I love, love, love this place.   The Bruscetta is fantastic.  It is such a great place to go and just relax, grab a bite, wine and chill.  This is one of my favorite restaurants in town.  Try the red pepper bruscetta and the fig & proscuitto it is amazing!"}
{"text":"I celebrated a friends birthday today at Postino.  It is a really busy place!  We decided that we would order a little of this and a little of that.  So we started with the NYC Grilled Cheese Sandwich.  I like it, it came with three dipping options, pesto, ketchup, and some sort of mustard.  We had several different bruschetta: tomato jam, arugula and bacon, apple and brie and mozzarella and basil.  All really good.  Italian food is not really my thing, but this was pretty good."}
{"text":"I would have given Postino's (as we lovingly call it) 5 stars if it weren't for the ridiculously long wait, BUT! 
It was a Friday night.
I can't complain about lingering in La Grande Orange while waiting for our table.

I was in a party of 3, probably took us an hour to get a table as we chose not to sit at the bar, ended up with cozy seating outside on the patio, where the tables seem perfectly spaced from each other, and the twinkly lights seemed almost magical. We ordered glasses of wine, then settled on a bottle of Tempranillo (wow!) to accompany our respective bruschetta boards. ADORED the mascarpone-fig-proscuitto (first experience with that combo) and spicy white bean hummus.
I liked the fresh mozzarella-tomato-basil just okay, thought the hearty chewiness of the bread was a bit much for the delicate toppings.

Try to walk if you can- parking is a nightmare. 

LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"The Brie and Apple with Fig spread Bruschetta is amazing! 

Since I don't live in AZ, I orginally heard of this place by Meghan McCain who I follow on twitter and listed this on her blog as one of her favorite Phoenix hang outs for those that are not native to the area.  Although she listed Postino Wine Cafe, I was brought to this location and I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived.  The staff was knowledgeable on their wine selection and provided great service.  The cork on my bottle of Pinot Noir had \"Wine Crystals\" or Wine Diamonds\", nothing I had seen before.  The server was very informative on explaining what it was, turns out I did my own research and the information provided was very accurate.  http://winesworld.com/index.php/wine-crystals/68/  

Also, If you are a fan of music, on the Friday night that I was there, they played music by The Whitest Boy Alive, The XX, Phoenix, Hercules & Love Affair and Band of Horses to name a few.  I was tapping my toe as some of these are on my own personal playlist so it instantly gained a few stars for the music alone.   Next, I'm coming back for Sangria Sundays and reggae.  Overall a very unique experience, great ambiance and delicious food.
 
Cheers!"}
{"text":"Best deal in town for a Monday or Tuesday night dinner. Expect a wait for a table, but it's definitely worth it. All of the bruschetta planks we ordered were delicious and though they were out of the wine we ordered, the replacement was just as tasty. This was our 2nd time eating here and we will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"The $20 bruschetta board and bottle of wine deal is too good to pass up even though I think the bruschetta here isn't that great. The bread is too chewy and I felt like I was fighting with it just to get a bite. Our waiter was fantastic. We got there a little before 8 and asked if it's too early to get the $20 deal and he said \"I'll make it happen\". He was genuinely nice and gave us several different wines to taste. I'd rather go to Kazimierz but I will definitely come back here on a Monday or Tuesday to take advantage of the wine and bruschetta deal."}
{"text":"I think my previous review was for another restaurant entirely.... whoopsie, my bad. 

HOWEVER!
This weekend I went to Postino's for lunch, for the first time ever.  EVER.  I know!  

I thought it was lovely.  I loved the proscuitto sandwich I had, I thought that the menu was concise and a perfectly priced.

I will return."}
{"text":"Tuesday Night Wine and Bruschetta Special Rawks! I love Postino's just for that.  $20 gets you a bottle of wine and a tray of bruschetta.  This is an AWESOME deal.  My girlfriends and I love it.  We can sit and talk and indulge in great wine and food.

Tips:  If you have a large group, make a reservation.  Plan to get there early, it gets packed.  The Tuesday Night special starts at 8pm."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! On Monday and Tuesday nights after 8 p.m. they have bruschetta and any bottle of wine for $20.  Expect to wait though it gets crowded.  The bruschetta is great, some many flavor combinations (I would never have thought to put them together).  A relaxing atmosphere with outdoor seating.  Parking can be a pain but they do have valet."}
{"text":"I absolutely ADORE Postino's! 

The quaintness of the surrounding neighborhood, the fact that it is housed in a old post office, the modern, organic ambiance....what can I say (oh, I already did...) I LOVE this place!

The bruschetta flights are fabulous! So diverse and tantilizing to the taste buds when paired with a complimentary glass of wine. My two favorite salads are the Raspberry Chicken and the Mixed Green...both delicious in their own right. 

I love that between 11am-4pm ANY day of the week, they offer $5 glasses of wine.  Whether you are dining with a girlfriend, your significant other or a few friends, this is a perfect place to meet. (Just note that this place is packed almost 24/7) 

Although the parking is a nightmare, the simple ambiance of this establishment, paired with the phenomenal food/drink, keeps me coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Came here with some girlfriends for an afternoon bite/happy hour. I'm from Minnesota. Happy hour seven days a week is unheard of. What a deal. Especially with $5 glasses of wine! Any single one on the menu. 

The bruschetta is amazing--recommend the apples and goat cheese. De-lish!

Service could be toned down somewhat; very helpful but maybe a little TOO helpful."}
{"text":"One of my fav places that I would recommend to anyone! The atmosphere is intimate and trendy. They have a good wine selection and delicious food. I would recommend the bruschetta which comes in 12 different flavors. The Brie & Apple and the Prosciutto & Figs are the best in my book. The staff is also friendly and helpful. They provided me with some great suggestions on wine after asking a few questions. Overall, it's just a great place to go for any occasion."}
{"text":"Such a wonderful establishment! Great atmosphere, great food. Ever since laying my eyes on their bruschetta flights, I knew I had to come here. Service wise threw me through a loop because its a \"group effort.\" I think every waiter and waitress came to our table at some point. They were quite attentive, but it was quite a head scratchier first arriving. 

 I ordered a flight, as well as one a la carte. The wooden board the bruschetta comes on is so beautiful. The bruschetta was better than what I could have imagined. The bread slices are big but not unmanageable. The ingredients are fresh and full of life. The brie and apples smelled like herbal essence shampoo! The salmon capers combo one was so meaty and robust. The prosciutto cheese one was also damn good. I wish I could have ordered them all! I didnt try their french press, but the smell it produced was aroma therapy. I wanted to take a sip because of how good it smelled. 

I will visit this place again, and will definitely be ordering more off of the menu."}
{"text":"So many people have had amazing experiences here. Whether its the service you get , the food quality, the ambiance or the amazing deals... its all been said. But hell, I will say it all again..

~Fud/Drink~
I have had bruschetta many times, at many places. They do bruschetta the RIGHT WAY. They give you so many different options to choose from, and each one tastes as good as the next. I am a salmon fan, so their salmon bruschetta was exquisite in my eyes. They have so many amazing wines to offer you as well, so many its almost impossible to not find the right fit for your meal. I have yet to try other main entrees on the menu, but do not worry I will. Just remember, you can taste the quality. They take good care of their product and make sure the kitchen pumps out quality dishes.

~Atmosphere/Service~
The Servers really know their stuff. They understand why you're their and they seem to really rock to the vibe of the place. Hipsters love it, I love it, and the servers are awesome at what they do. The suggestions they provide prove to really help make the night a better one. The atmosphere is great, a real hipster vibe for sure. I enjoy a relaxed calm spot personally, especially after a long day at work, and  they nail it. Its just quiet enough to sit down and relax with someone special, yet loud enough that no one can hear your conversation.

~Extras/Rating~

Regarding the $20 Bruschetta/Wine deal: GET-THERE-EARLY. Or else you might find yourself waiting for an hour to get served. I do not fault them for having to put you on a long wait-list, especially because its such an amazing deal and so popular just suck it up and get there earlier or 30 minutes earlier than what you would normally want. Their $20 Bruschetta/Wine pairing is the best happy hour item I have ever seen. No lie. That alone puts them in the upper echelon for date night go-to's and perfect chill happy hour locations in the valley here. 

 No one can lay claim to such a unique and perfect option, despite the fact that numerous other bars have attempted. They may try, but the quality of food and vast selection of wines, paired with the ambiance they provide, blows all competitors out of the water. The only thing I hate about this place, is that I didn't think of it first.. :) 5 stars because they deserve it, enough said."}
{"text":"Best bruschetta ever!!

Came here with some girlfriends one night and it was just perfect!! We all shared a bottle of wine or two. The restaurant is so cute and decorated well with wine bottles all around. Very cozy feeling.

The food is the best part! You can get a couple different kinds of bruschetta. Everyone told me to get that and I am so glad I did. It was excellent!!

Very trendy. Very good food. And a good spot to meet up with friends. Loved it!"}
{"text":"This place has to be one of the most overrated restaurants... ever.

So this review is for dinner and maybe that is why I was so utterly disappointed.

Food:
Brushcetta- We sampled the artichoke, pesto with salmon, roasted red peppers with goat cheese, and the fig spread with green apple.  I mean all of them were decent nothing was amazing.  In fact, i think I could easily put together a couple of them myself and have them taste just as good if not better.

Nine Iron-  Once again, it was OK.  Nothing special at all.  Just exactly as was described on the menu.

Italian Picnic Salad-  Once again, nothing special at all.  Could have made it myself.

Service:
So on vacation we tend to eat out.  This was our 4th dinner out in a row and the first 3 had impeccable service.  This place did not.  I felt like it was a lot of waiting and waiting more.   We ordered something they did not bring and when we asked for that something we waited and waited....  Servers were nice enough though but they didn't seem that busy on a Sunday night so I would have expected service to be better.

Ambiance:
Servers-Well, the servers I would classify as Arizona hipsterish.  Like not real hipsters.  They should go to SF to see those.  But definitely trying to be hipsters

People there- 30- somethings at birthday dinners mixed with 20-somethings on date.  And yes, we did witness a couple making out.  Once again this was 7pm on a Sunday. Spare me please.

The Place- First, we asked to sit inside because it was slightly cold.  Well they sit us inside but right next to the open half of the restaurant so it basically was sitting outside but without the heater.  Other than that it was cute inside.

Maybe this place was more like 2 1/2 -3 but I was so disappointed with the food and ambiance that I have to round down to 2.  This place is probably great during happy hour but when you're paying full price, it's just so not worth it."}
{"text":"Best place for lunch!  Five dollar glasses off their wonderful wine menu, plus the brushetta is off the charts, and the chicken salad is the best I've ever had!  Would eat there everyday if I lived closer."}
{"text":"Ya ya, if your into who's who and the whole I am here to be seen and not heard scene then sure you frequent this whole complex. The wine list is good, not great,  the food is good and yes it is cool the setting and all that shit. I like atmosphere but this place has to many super cool, dressed in black tops, designer jeans, and mules, for me personally. I want wine aficionados not people who order house wine and want to look cool in the cars they work for and the apartment that is not furnished. When this place first opened i loved it but it is now a bit falsetto for my taste."}
{"text":"Love love love Postinos. It is such a great atmosphere and I'm a huge fan of the rasp chicken salad. 

Will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Great food and ambiance. Postino Central will always be my favorite location."}
{"text":"This bar was amazing for their daytime wine specials. 
Coupled with their tasty food [specifically the bruschetta]; it made for the perfect afternoon.  
I didn't realize the portions were so huge but my friend and I each ordered four different kinds of bruschetta plus the salmon carpaccio for a starter. 
I tried the Tuscan white bean, the prosciutto with figs, the roasted red pepper with goat cheese - phenomenal -- and their seasonal/daily selection, golden beets with goat cheese and mint,  which was just okay.  
I wish this place existed in New York; I mean, I'm sure something similar does exist, but probably would NOT be similar in price!"}
{"text":"Excellent bruschetta, we ordered a 2nd set! The place was packed, but we got a table pretty quickly.  The staff was extremely helpful and knew their wine and offered great recommendations.  We were all traveling for business, I can't wait to be back in the area to go again!"}
{"text":"Oh Postino's Winecafe, where have you been all my life?!?! 

Honestly, I don't drink wine, and trust me my family is so disappointed in me because of this. And because I don't drink wine, I was hesitant to go to Postino's. I mean Winecafe can scare off us non-wine drinkers.

The Truth!?!? Postino's has A-mazing food. And I will brave the wait, because there usually is one, to eat their tasty tasty Bruschetta and their mouth wateringly wonderful panini's. Although if you add Brie or prosciutto to anything and I am totally there!

Okay so back to the moral f the story, Just because you don't drink wine, still go eat at Postino's...really,  you will love it!"}
{"text":"This is a very crowded place, but the food is amazing, so once in a while I try to hit them when not crowded.  Surprisingly, this was the case for Sunday brunch. The food was good and the service as well."}
{"text":"What better way to reward yourself and Pals after a healthy hike...$5  & Bruschetta! Always a great destination if you're looking for a great wine selection, awesome nibbles for a group and friendly service!! 
I always recommend the Bruschetta if you have never tried it there! It's what they do Best!! Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Postino Arcadia was better than expected on a recent  visit.  On the way back home from the airport my friend and I decided to stop for a nosh and wine.  When we got there late afternoon, we were welcomed immediately and cheerfully and seated promptly.  As soon as were seated, one of the wait staff brought us water and took our order for a bottle of Caparza.   It was a lovely Italian, a fill bodied Sangiovese Tuscan but not as murky as a Chianti.  It was delicious from the first sip to the last drop.  If you like Italian reds, this is a really good one.                                                                                           We next ordered our food and my friend ordered the bruschetta, I wanted a panini and settled on the autostrada.  One of Postino's delights is to choose your favorites when ordering the bruschetta s there are some wonderful choiced. He ended up with the salmon, caprese, artichoke and the green apple toasts. Each one offers a unique blend of flavors and no one does it better than Postino.  The Autostrada panini has all the right meats and cheeses but I am not a fan of the arugula and tomato.  I took those off and added them to my side salad and took a bite.  Each bite took me back to a stop I made on the way from Naples to Salerno where I had a similar panini with such wonderful flavors.                                                                                                                  The food and wine would earn this wonderful restaurant five stars but the Postino service by committee is not my favorite.  It creates uneven service and no one seems totally responsible for your table.  Other than that, Postino continues to be a wonderful gem in the Arcadia neighborhood and highly recommended.  This was a great improvement from my last visit."}
{"text":"Go on a Tuesday you will get bruschetta and wine for $20!! The bruschetta is stupid good!! Huge wine selection and if you dont drink wine they have a full bar. Best neighborhood spot in Arcadia. 

Oh and it's super sexy too! Perfect for those who are looking for the perfect date spot.

Just go you will love it...trust me!"}
{"text":"Great place.  I've been going here for years and it only gets better!  Is there any way I can get them to open one in Seattle?"}
{"text":"If I could live off of Postino's Bruchetta Board I would. Actually now that I think about it that isn't a bad idea. The only downside of loving something so much is that I hardly venture out and trying something else on the menu. I think my favorite is the red peppers - I don't know how they get so much good flavor in a tiny little piece. 

The only other thing I have had their is what I call the \"magic sandwhich.\" Also known as the chicken and mozzarella panin but I sub the mayo for a pesto sauce. Yum Yum Yum!

Plus they have an amazing selection of drinks and a great happy hour (if only it went a little longer in the afternoon it would be perfection)."}
{"text":"I love this place, whether it's to meet friends for happy hour or to grab a quick dinner and some wine. The bruscetta is to die for and I have now seen many restaurants trying to replicate. The wine list is reasonable with great values!

I find the crowd to be pleasant and generally professionals. However, if you are generally offended by well-dressed adults, then perhaps you might want to stay away.  This is a great place!"}
{"text":"This is the best place ever. LOVE the bruschetta boards and the super friendly service. Also, insider tip (well it's printed on the menu) but their bottled wine is discounted when you order while dining in. Their rose on the menu is just divine :) looking forward to MANY happy hours, brunches and dinner."}
{"text":"Cute little place in a very trendy area. The service and food here was awesome. The congestion with parking can be a bit of a pain, however, I did see that there was valet offered over there. I went for brunch on a weekend and there was an awesome one man band playing. I like to go visit here by myself to read a book and soak up the ambiance. I definitely recommend their soup and salad!"}
{"text":"Located at the SW corner of 40th St. and Campbell.  This entire corner is now owned by an enterprising young couple who ingeniously converted the old post office to a wine bar featuring fresh aperitifs and lite gourmet pizza!  They did such a fab job on the remodel they were written up in Architects Digest some 8 years ago (or more) when they opened.  It's become something of a low key meeting hub with \"great date\" written all over the place.  Any given night of the week you will find this place a' buzz!  So plan on a wait, unless it's early in the evening or very early in the week - like Monday.  Open for lunch and open late; again with some candied confections that could make a girl on a diet cry.  Look cute, because this is where the beautiful people hang out in Phoenix, sans attitude.  Moderately priced."}
{"text":"Somehow, I have neglected to review Postino Arcadia... so let me correct that mistake.  And now that there are 300+ positive reviews on here -- this is just to pile on the love.

Love the atmosphere
Love the food (the bruschetta! my mouth is watering now...)
Love the friendly service
Love the location
Love live music (though it can disrupt conversations)
 
The only \"don't Love\"?  Parking.  
But that is a small price to have a nice spot to enjoy food with friends."}
{"text":"My parents just arrived in town yesterday for a few days to meet my fiance's parents and celebrate our engagement with us.  They are staying at the Biltmore and wanted to try something close to the hotel.  There was only one truly amazing place that I could think of....POSTINO'S!!!  This place always delivers amazing food and service.  We had some wine(which was delicious), the always spectacular bruscetta(we had 2 bruscetta boards and all were fantastic) and I had the Autostrada panini....wow, that was one of the best sandwiches I have ever had!  It had a bit of a kick to it and was very tasty.  If you haven't visited this place yet, you are definitely missing out!"}
{"text":"The bruschetta is awesome!!!! It is so good that this is now my 86 year old grandmother's favorite place to go! In fact, my grandmother, mother, and I (3 generations) go to Postino's weekly!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic winebar, can't go wrong here.   I'm not going to repeat everyone else's reviews so I'll just contribute a few suggestions here.  First, for white wine lovers, go for the Emeri.  Sparkling Sauvignon Blanc. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing!   And I haven't found anywhere else that carries this brand. Forego the glass, just get the whole bottle if you have someone to share it with.  This is a good place for a dates or hanging out with a few friends (more intimate, smaller group), not as great for a big group.  My recco is not to do dinner there (though their grilled cheese and soup is delish and the apple & brie bruschetta rocks too) but go for the wine and leave room for dessert.  They are all delicious.  The portion sizes are just right for sharing.  Creme brulee is my favorite and the salted caramel sundae is also divine (chocolate covered corn nuts? who knew these were so tasty!).    If you aren't in a wine mood  - though why would you be at a wine bar then - the Mr. Qcumber Soda is a unique little refreshing beverage.    Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The main advice I would give anyone interested in dining at Postino Arcadia would be: \"Prepare to Fight.\"  Prepare to fight for a parking space and prepare to fight for the bruschetta which is to die for.  My favorites would have to be the Smoked Salmon and Pesto, Apple and Brie, Prosciutto and Fig and Warm Artichoke.  Plus, you cannot beat a bottle of vino and 4 types of bruschetta for $20 every Monday and Tuesday after 8pm!

I am also a huge fan of their Pretzel Pub Board and NYC Grilled Cheese that is companied by a Sierra Nevada Mustard, Pesto and Ketchup dipping sauces, washed down with a cold Stella Artois Lager Belgium.  These menu items have sparked inspiration for me to make similar dishes in my own kitchen more than a time or two.  So grab some good company, a bottle of vino paired with bruschetta and prepare for a relaxing-enjoyable night out.

Don't forget the Affogato (vanilla bean ice cream topped with espresso) to give ya a jolt for your car ride home."}
{"text":"The variety of the always changing wine list is a great reason to visit Postino's.  There is something available for everyone.  But my favorite reason to visit is the bruschetta board - every ingredient is fresh and each of the different options are delicious."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and good food.  I had the roast beef panini and it was average, but the other stuff we ordered from the menu (e.g. bruschetta) was fantastic!  The service was outstanding.  Very relaxed place."}
{"text":"Went back just to see if it was as good as it was the last time.  It was.  This place is worth a stop.  We took friends and they loved it.  The bruschetta and antipasta board are great.  Wines by the glass also very good.  Go, go, go."}
{"text":"Great food, atmosphere and wine. The red blend is the best wine I've ever had! Great soups and sandwiches and the bruschetta is awesome. Great staff too!"}
{"text":"It's about 8:30pm Memorial Monday... Just finished a long day at Sedona with hikes and many activities.  Here I am @ Postinos on my way back home to cali =)



It has been 2 years since the last time I ate here.  It's always the last stop for food on the way back to California.  $20 for 4 choices of Nom Nom bruschetta & a bottle of wine is such a great deal!  You can choose not to have the bottle opened and to go it home! =)   Bruschetta assortment is just unbelievably great!  Definitely put me in a food coma on the 7 hour drive home.

 I rarely give 5 stars, but Postinos deserved it because the employees are soooo amiable consistenly checking up on our table. With such a long day in Sedona I had 8-10cups of water and there wasn't a moment I had to \"ask\" for water like other establishments.  Employees must of had very keen eye-vision because it was quite dark in the room and they kept my water cup filled at all times.

  I did have a little sip of Moscato from my friend's bottle and it's bubbly good!

  Postinos... seee ya on my next road trip... or you can open up a location in southern california =)"}
{"text":"This review is way overdue. And since I am not a regular Yelp reviewer, I am making an exception to this one....

I am in love with the quality and range of bruschetta they had at Postino. Figs, honey, almonds, pistachio, goat cheese, prisciutto and sooo much more!    Bite after bite felt like heaven on earth. Their creativity with the menu blew me away. Hip  ambiance. check. Originality. check. Scrumptiousness.  triple check.  

 I need to find a place like this in the Bay Area!"}
{"text":"OMG I love this place!  This is a favorite when I am hosting out of towners - it has been a hit every time!  I love love love love love the Bruschetta.  Usually we have made this a dinner spot, but a few weeks ago I went for Saturday lunch with my mom and her friend.  It was the perfect spot - they had the back walls opened up to outside and the atmosphere was fabulous for a social midday meal.  Other favorites on the menu are: prosciutto and brie panini and the mediterranean salad, add turkey.  Additionally, the wine selection is wonderful!"}
{"text":"Perfect stress free atmosphere. I tried this cabernet-malbec perfect combination. Enjoyed the proscetta  board and the company. This is a a must go to place."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere and great wine choices. Loved that there's is not a crazy large menu they keep it simple and good. Maybe on the higher end price wise for what you get but cool atmosphere and we will come here again. Our server was definitely interesting I think he'd been eating some Denver brownies right before or during his shift :)  valet parking was quick and efficient. We will be back"}
{"text":"Love this spot. Great for a glass of wine and chilling or dinner!  It's a must but on the hot nights expect a wait."}
{"text":"It is a very nice place but they kinda have you waiting for a little long after you're sat down."}
{"text":"Bruschetta and a bottle of wine on Tuesday for $20. For Realz!!!!

This deal can't be beat. This place is cool. It's in a trendy part of Acadia. Your always in for some juicy upper middle class gossip here, the crowd is 80% yuppie hipster. 

It is hard to differentiate between the staff and the customers, but that is kind of Postino's thing.
I haven't had the best service here always, I don't fit in. I'm one of those old school hip hop guys so when I come in here, I feel I kind of stick out but it seriously is a good wine bar, and good wine bars are hard to come by. 

I do enjoy people watching thou, and this place is definitely good for that, it's good for dates, you are sure to see allot of first daters and couples without kids here that have been together for ever just staring at their food not talking...awkward!!!!

The ambiance is always good the lighting is just right. You can smell the love in the air... then again maybe that is the bruschetta...I love the Bruschetta...only place with better Bruschetta might be North...also in Arcadia...BRUSCHETTA WARS!!!

Sometimes they have live music here. Always a plus...love live music, I wished more places did this. 

Anyhow besides the snooty staff, this place is pretty cool. 

I'd give it five stars if I looked like I walked out of a JCrew catalog or if  had the latest thrift store Macklemore look going on, maybe I could relate better to the staff...but I grew out of that trendy shit in like 2004. I look like I came from the gym when I come here...and I just assume the staff assumes I have no money and give me attitude. 

I just don't care. But still a good time."}
{"text":"I loved this little gem we found! Was here on a conference and needed to get out of the hotel for a change of scenery. Thank god we found this! Amazing food and service! You must try the bruschetta!"}
{"text":"Finally made it in here for their weekend brunch. Its the Postino standard deliciousness! I had the country toast... Italian ham, Gruyere and eggs with a Dijon mayo, served on sourdough. I love the way the cheese melts and gets all crispy on the bread.  Then topped with the magic combo of ham and eggs... The tomato salad on the side has a basil vinaigrette that was really yummy. I skipped mimosas this go round, but it should be noted that they're a mere $5, as are bellinis at brunch time. 
Service was fast, friendly and they kept the water glasses full. Also, at 11am on a Sunday, we waited only about 5 minutes for a table.  :)"}
{"text":"So I have to admit I really was not excited about going to this place. I am not a big bread eater unless its bread on a sandwich and one of the specialties here is their bruschetta, strike 1. I have tried bruschetta and have never been a big fan. I have heard there is no parking and that you had to get the valet to park your car, strike 2. Ok so I do love my wine and so I gave in and agreed to try it. The place was packed on a Thursday afternoon and we were seated at a high-top table by the door, strike 3. Turns out the the brushetta was outstanding. We ordered a combo of four selections, Brie & Apples with Fig Spread, Albacore Tuna with Gaeta Olives, Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios & Smoked Salmon with Pesto, all were excellent and all for 12 bucks. I also ordered, against my will, instead of wine the Cucumber Honey Lemonade. It really sounded disgusting and ended up to be amazing. For desert we ordered the Vanilla bean ice cream with chocolate covered corn nuts, a pretzel stick and salted caramel. They must make the caramel fresh as the unmistakable smell filled the restaurant a couple minutes after ordering it. Oh and that table by the door turned out to be a great spot for people watching and the valet was friendly and quick. I can admit when I am wrong, I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"What else needs to be said besides Half price wine and bruschetta planks?  I can't remember what day this happens on (Tuesday or Thursday) but it was incredible.  And the bruschetta is easily enough to fill up two people so don't worry about ordering extra food.  Great place for a date and some drinks."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere. Wine selection is ample. Love the appetizers. NYC grilled cheese is awesome. The staff rocks!

{"text":"Set up: girl that is almost always hungry or ready for her next meal + late flight into Phoenix the night before (thereby missing dinner) = ravenous girl @ Postino

Summer Delight (SD) and I were seated at a pretty perfect table, in the corner, next to the window. Which definitely came in handy in terms of hiding our slight shame when the onslaught of food and booze arrived at our tiny little table for 2!

In true fattiness, we ordered enough food to feed a family of 5! And of course with their happy hour offerings for wine and beer it was too awesome to pass up on! 

1. Selection of 4 Bruschetta's: pretty good variety of options, ingredients were fresh, generously portioned and flavor combinations worked. My only problem was the bread to goods ratio. Even though I am a thorough carbivore, it was a bit too much bread for my pref and I tend to like less dense bread for my bruschetta. Nonetheless a great deal for $14!

2. Autostrada Panini - I am not one to pass up on any meat, on meat, on meat, on meat action (yes, 4 types of salty cured pig parts...especially in regards to the Soppressata, LOL!)! And the spicy pepper relish was a nice added zing to bring together all that goodness. LOL!!

3. Bella Postino (warm artichoke dip and white bean hummus with assorted MJ breads) - Probably...no...definitely could have done without this given the amount of food we already ordered but still a good staple to order if you're here with more than 2 people! Haha!

And then on to the best part! They have a great happy hour where their wine by the glass and PITCHERS of beer are just $5!! Loved that there were so many options! You seldom see that here in San Francisco. So it was quite glorious! There was definitely some remorse that I stuffed myself so much I didn't have more capacity to fully take advantage of it! 

SD also introduced me to a locally produced beer, I believe it was the HopShock? Pretty freaking delicious!

Good food/booze and wonderful company certainly made this a very memorable meal! If I ever find myself in AZ again I will definitely revisit this place. Especially now that I have learned from my mistake of not properly allocating my stomach capacity for happy houring here! ^____^

{"text":"I may not be the hugest fan of La Grande Orange, but there's one spot in that little Arcadia hub that is always worth going to-Postino. 

Postino has got to be one of the busiest places in town on Monday and Tuesday nights because of their killer $20-for-a-bottle-of-wine-and-bruschetta deal from 8-11 p.m. They're busy every other night, too, simply because they're one of the hippest places around-a hot staff, a huge wine selection, a pretty patio, wonderful food and pretty ambiance. There's also a location in central Phoenix, which offers up all of the same.

When I went there for dinner, I had one of my favortie paninis, the Nine Iron ($9.50), which came with a small side salad and was topped with tomato, mustard and mozzarella. It's very filling and tastes super-fresh, and the regular one comes with chicken and bacon, too.

My pal got the Italian Picnic salad ($8.50) and Tomato Jam and Sheep's Milk bruschetta ($12.75). This was the first time I tried that type of bruschetta (my favorites are the White Bean with Chopped Tomato and Warm Artichoke Spread), and I thought it was amazing-really sweet, and it could even work for dessert."}
{"text":"Amazing decor - you will like being here. It feels open and cozy at the same time. Wine?! Yes please! You'll find a eclectic selection here. Quality. Try their bruschetta, a perfect vino pairing. This staff is very friendly and knowledgable."}
{"text":"I love Postinos as much  as anyone else, always have amazing food and of course a great selection of wine. However this place has become such a headache. It is almost impossible to get a seat any more on Mon or Tues night because of their $20 bottle of wine and bruchetta board. The special starts at 8pm, we got there over 45 min early one night and the wait was an hour and a half. I wish they would either extend the hours, get extra table or do something so they can accommodate all of their clients. They will accept reservations if you have a party of 8 or more. So last Mon. we called ahead and made reservations for our large group, we arrived 20 min early to ensure that they would have enough time to get our table ready and they told us that they just gave our tables away to 2 smaller groups. Hello?!?! We were EARLY to our reservations. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Peace. Love. Drinks. Music.

What a mission statement!  And how wildly Postino succeeds!  I LOVE this place. lovelovelove.

Arrived in the afternoon prior to flying home to take advantage of the generous 11-7 happy hour with 5 dollar glasses of wine and pitchers of beer.  Was greeted by a lovely gentleman who asked if we wanted a \"proper table,\" but since we did not, he escorted us to a loungey area and seated us at two super comfy chairs with a nice table in between.

The place itself is a former historic post office; the space itself is funky and fun, with lots of natural light coming in and wonderful music!  We jammed to Bloc Party, Passion Pit, and so many other great songs.  As we sampled their libations, here were some highlights:
-Bellini: so fresh and tasty and only 5 bucks!
-Pinot Noir: can go so wrong, but was so right, especially for 5 bucks!
-Pitcher of beer: a yummy, citrusy wheat beer; about 2 and a half glasses to these pitchers, but again, only 5 bucks!
-Pub Board: yummy, warm, salted pretzel bites, excellent cheese, chorizo, and corn nuts. Great with beer.
-Bruschetta: OMG so good!  One order gets you four large bruschettas (cut in half for sharing). We loved the goat cheese with roasted red peppers, brie and apple with fig spread (swoon!), white bean with tomatoes, and salami with pesto. Oh so yummy.

The service was amazing, the vibe was oh so cool, and the food and drinks were priced well and yummy.  To me, this place is like what many LA places try to be, but they actually succeed without being pretentious or overpriced. Seriously, do I need to move to Phoenix?"}
{"text":"I can't say that I would fight for a parking space at many places, but Postino makes the list. Will I ever steal a parking spot? Not at all, but I will look long and hard for one here. The wait is worth it yelp friends. Postino does a great job luring customers in and keeping them. With their incredible happy hour, I wish I could sneak away to dine on a glass of wine before 4:00 PM on a weekday and for those who can, I salute you. 

Every time I wine and dine at Postino, I leave full, happy and satisfied. The original Postino location will also be my favorite based on it's location, ambiance, character, service and quality products. The wine is obviously top knotch here at Postino. Bottles line the walls and the staff knows their selections inside and out. They offer bottle specials all the time and you can enjoy a bottle at a reasonable price practically every day of the week. 

Their food competes with the quality of their wine. I long for their bruschetta. You chose four different flavors and for a reasonable price under $15. My favorite bruschettas are the prosciutto and fig, and tomato paste with cheese. The tomato mozzarella is also a classic. But, it really just depends on your taste buds because any bruschetta you choose will be excellent. Many times, I got for the half sandwich/salad combo. I like to order the Market which isn't on the menu. It comes with pesto, tomato and mozzerela. I make sure to add chicken. The Mediterranean is my go-to salad but I vary between all of their salads. You really just can't go wrong with anything on the menu here. And it tastes even better with wine. Doesn't everything?"}
{"text":"After hearing about this place for months, I just HAD to go try it out. It was a Thursday night and surprisingly really busy. After walking in and not seeing anyone seating, we sat ourselves. The ONE hostess on duty then scolded us for doing so. Then after being confused, within 15 minutes three diff servers approached our table. One with water, one for a drink order and one to take our order. None of them smiled or seemed to care to wait on us, probably bc we weren't drinking wine. If it wasn't for the remarkable bruschetta and proscuttio sandwich, I would have left. The food is incredible and I would go back for takeout but the service really sucked."}
{"text":"Favorite place in the Valley for bruschetta!  Also love the 11 am to 5 pm $5 glasses of wine.  :)"}
{"text":"As per usual no disappointment for lunch and great wine selections for five bucks per glass.  We arrive just before 11 to get our favorite spot and order our usual Bruschetta (4 tough choices) to share.  Having tried all ten choices at one time or the other we chose 1,2, 4 and 8.  You will have to visit to see what we selected but please don't occupy our spot."}
{"text":"Love this place! I still kinda like the one on Central slightly better, but this has a cool inside/outside vibe and being next to LGO is awwesome!"}
{"text":"By now, I'm guessing that everyone has been to Postino Winecafe. If for some cosmic reason you haven't made it, you really should.

Sometimes you just aren't ready to go straight home from work. That's when it's time to tap your local neighborhood eatery, pull up a chair and unwind.

Postino Winecafé is one of those hangouts. Its first location opened in 2001 by the same folks subsequently responsible for La Grande Orange and LGO Pizzeria. Even if either location isn't in your 'hood, you'll quickly feel welcomed by an attractive and friendly staff.

At the Arcadia location I visited, parking is at a premium, so it's a good idea to come early or late. Checking the car into the valet (only $3) will save potential aggravation. Parking is complimentary at the Central location.

As I sat taking in the crowd and the space, I couldn't help but ponder: Should I order beer or wine? With a worldwide and world class selection, there is plenty to choose from.

I was feeling like a Belgium beer, so I went for the Chimay Grand Reserve ($8). At quadruple the flavor and double the alcohol content compared to domestics, this beer has a certain yeasty earthiness that's surprisingly not heavy or thick.

A small bowl of olives came to the table so I could start chowing down with my drink selection. They're smart by teasing with a small bowl because after one olive you'll want to order a full bowl ($5) with a blend of Luques, Picholines, Gaetas, Red Cerignolas, Arbequinas and Castelvetranos.

Snacking and sharing is key to the menu, but if you want to compose dinner out of salads and sandwiches, that's just as easy.

The Pub Board ($10) severs up a soft, hot and steamy pretzels made from local bakery MJ Bread. Alongside are a selection of Schreiner's chorizo, cornichon pickles, aged cheddar and giant Spanish corn nuts for a major snack attack.

Panini, a grilled Italian sandwich, has many varieties. On this visit the Nine Iron ($9.50) was just all right. Filled with hickory-smoked bacon and layered with grilled chicken and fresh burrata mozzarella, it sounds like a hole-in-one, but the soggy lettuce left me in the sand trap.

The salad that came along was dressed well but it was composed of too many pieces of white and bitter romain cores. After mentioning this to the server it this was quickly addressed with apologies. It's OK to share your expectations with any establishment, whether good or bad.

Bruschetta ($12.75), four to an order grilled bread covered with a choice of preparations, scored major kudos. It was love at first bite! My choices were Prosciutto with Figs and Mascarpone, Tomato Jam and Fresh Sheep's Milk Cheese, Albacore Tuna with Gaeta Olives and Salami with Pesto. Salty, creamy, sweet and chewy -- this was a full-on taste party!

The Salted Caramel Sundae ($5) was the grand finale. Vanilla ice cream with chocolate-covered corn nuts and a pretzel stick with a salted caramel shot was all I ever wanted.

This is food that I love to eat -- clean, simple and fresh. When paired with my favorite beer or wine, I could easily stop by on my way home from work every night."}
{"text":"On a recent trip after not being here for quite sometime I was surprised that is wasn't a bit more crowded. We had no problems finding a seat at the bar. 

They have a great deal everyday of any glass of wine is $5. We had a few glasses of wine and had The Butcher's Block for an appetizer. Very good mix of goodies for sure. It always had a nice ambiance and great prices. 

Since it's starting to cool off I know I'll be back a bit more."}

Atmosphere - 3/5
Casual, great place for meeting friends. can be a little too busy for my liking.

Average I can't really complain.

Overall - I don't go out of my way to go here, but I certainly recommend it."}
{"text":"Now....before all you Postino lovers chew me out, the reason I give three stars is quite simple...I am in no hurry to go back. Now this doesn't mean the service was bad, the food was mediocre, the wine selection limited, the decor unpleasant. It wasn't any of those descriptives. It simply wasn't above above average.

I went there on a weekday night, late, and had a dinner date. We were seated next to the wine selection since we ended up at the tail-end of the busy dinner time of Postinos. The place is really beautiful-well designed, warm, full of sophisticated, cultivated people tinkling upscale laughter. There aren't much options for the lactose intolerant vegetarian, so I went with the bruschetta sampler. And while it was tasty, I wasn't quite blown away. The combinations were good...but is it really good date food to chew on crispy crunchy bread loaded with crap that falls off all over the place?

The wine selection is overwhelming, but was pleased with the server who helped us out on a bold, juicy cab in a reasonable (read: cheap) bottle.

I really liked the look of the bar and if I went back here probably would hit that up with wine and maybe some dessert after dinner somewhere else.

This place is beautiful. The patio especially looks elegant and reclusive enough for your next affair. But the ambiance is just off. I can't quite put my finger on it, but it seems to lack a kind of personality or quirk. Kind of like when you visit a perfectionist's home and it feels rather cool or crisp, but then you love your messy, quirky friends home b/c you can relax and not use a coaster. 

It is a perfect date place...but in a rather generic way. This place, in fact, SCREAMS date place. I imagine it was booked for upcoming valentine's day back on Feb. 15, 2006....which to me, just isn't any fun."}
{"text":"Ok I have waited long enough to review Postinos...I have been here more than any other restaurant since I moved to AZ so I had to share my view on this place! I go to the Arcadia location most often so my review is based off of that..

This is me any one of my best gals Sunday spot...we go maybe twice a month and enjoy the Reggae, $5 Glasses of wine and of course the BRUSCHETTA!!...All of my fellow Yelpers have pretty much summed it up, all of their bruschetta is AMAZING!!! my favs are the brie with apples and the prosciutto with figs...I can eat that all day long...their sandwiches and salads are yummy as well...my next goal is to make it here for brunch :-)

Overall
very casual and laid back vibe
parking is a bit tricky 
great for dates, lunch, brunch, bdays, holidays...and the list goes on..."}
{"text":"I can see why people are just packing it in here. A great place for visitors and locals.

Wonderful atmosphere. Quality wines and great gnoshing dishes. There is a friendly, knowledgeable staff to advise folks about there options. Top notch bruschetta with a great combination of fresh ingredients. Brie and apple, dates with pistachios being my favorites.

Make reservations because the beautiful crowd is huge. 

Best deal ever, happy hour - $5 wine by glass is the best deal before 5pm"}
{"text":"Good food, good atmosphere.. BUT found a hair in my sandwich and an eyelash in my bruschetta. The manager was accommodating about these items and took them off the check. I would recommend Postinos to someone, but advise them to check for hairs in their food."}
{"text":"Postino's is simply a great place; great ambiance, great wine, great food, and great staff.  I like how they are knowlwedgable about wine in general and often switch the wine menu to mix things up and keep it fresh.  If you find that your favorite wine has been replaced, the staff will suggest a comparable wine that will make you forget your previous favorite.  Can't beat the specials and Happy Hour.  Salute to Postinos!"}
{"text":"When I visit an other place for dinner, this is the benchmark. I love the food and service is always top notch. You have to pay to park, but its worth it. Work your way through the menu, its a great way to spend the summer."}
{"text":"Had my birthday lunch here! It was so good and the prosecco was amazing (and only $5). I love Postinos and thier bruschetta boards. I got a sandwich- the nine iron. It was good my only complaint is that the sauce must've been on the bread for a bit. It was very soggy on the bottom. Also, our server was nice and laid back- almost too laid back. My friend had to go back to work and it took him 20 mins to come and get her card so she could leave."}
{"text":"Came here last night after reading much ado about the place via Yelp and I must say we were very impressed! 

We had the oh so amazing cheese platter and the outstandingly fresh and tasty bruschetta, I highly suggest the tomato and basil.

So why no 5 stars??

Tab was 136, amazing food but not that amazing."}
{"text":"This restaurant got all the right stuff. Great service, a great wine list, quality food, and a relaxed atmosphere with a European feel to it. 
The chef must have a great knowledge of foods and flavors that compliment one another because I cannot recall trying a dish that I did not like. Bruschettas are great because you get to try four different flavors in one order. Last time we went I had their chicken and mozzarella panini which was delicious. I highly recommend you try this place."}
{"text":"LOVE the ambiance. The wine is great and definitely try the pub grub."}
{"text":"Bummer that I have to give this location three stars. My girlfriends and I came here last night, and it was my first time checking out this particular location. I went to Central last week, loved it, and thought I'd be in love with this spot too. Nope.

Definite five stars for the food - the best bruschetta I've ever had and a bottle of wine for $20? You can never beat that.

Three stars for the service. They were slammed, and I understand that. However, the waitress wasn't friendly. My girlfriend was trying to place her order and the waitress blatantly ignored her to talk to a guy at another table. We didn't even have silverware or napkins at our table and she didn't bring any when we asked her.

One star for valet. Central location offers complimentary valet and Arcadia charges three dollars. That's fine, but I didn't have cash on me and asked the guy to return my car so I can park it myself. He STILL charged me and said something along the lines of, \"The owner makes us charge everyone - liability reasons.\" Uh, what? My car wasn't even in your lot for more than 30 seconds! Anyway, tacky.

Central location has my vote and my five stars."}
{"text":"I travel to PHX for business and this is my place to unwind and have some great food.  Came here twice and loved it.  I actually finished a whole bottle of wine with a co-worker once and that wine was DELISH.  

The only downfall to this place is that it's a little pricey (as in LA or SF pricey) -- a small sandwich was $10.  It was a little shocking since I was expecting PHX to be slightly cheaper than those areas.

Other than that, a great date place or a place to chill with co-workers."}
{"text":"Monday night is reverse happy hour! Starts at 8pm. You get a bottle of wine and choice of 4 bruschetta for $20! The burrata, bacon, arugula and tomatoes  and the warm artichoke spread are to die for! Outstanding! This is definitely a place to go! One thing that was a little annoying was how loud it is in the restaurant, but the great food outweighed the noise."}
{"text":"I don't think I'm ever disappointed with the food. It's really good. One time I came, the soup of the moment was a corn chowder (maybe chicken corn chowder?), and it was the most delicious soup I had ever had! I'm sad they haven't had it any other time I've been. I miss it. 

I would definitely recommend splitting a bruschetta plate. You could split it as an appetizer with 2-4 people. You get 4 giant bruschetta (you choose 4 different ones from a large variety) and then each one is cute into 4 strips because they are so big. I guess... It could be 2 people's meals (or one hungry person) or an appetizer for 3-4.

Service... was okay. They are really busy, always."}
{"text":"Love this place, great wine selection and can't go with out the Bruschetta! Great Happy Hour Specials. Does fill up quick with limited seating so get there early! Great service as well!"}
{"text":"Love, Love, Love Postino.  I have never been disappointed when I go there.  It is a very relaxed atmosphere, great selection of $5 a glass wine, even my favorite moscato.  The food is always the freshist and delicious."}
{"text":"This place puts out some darn tasty grub at an affordable price, with a hip crowd and daily drink specials.

I've only been for lunch (2 or 3 times), but each meal has exceeded my expectations.  I would definitely recommend the bruschetta, where you get to pick 4 out of at least 9 different toppings, which all come on toasted bread.  If I recall, the tomato jam and sheep's milk was my favorite, but I also enjoyed the apple, fig and brie, as well as the roasted red pepper and goat cheese.  My wife had the tuna sandwich and salad, and even with just a half sandwich, I still had to help her finish it...bummer.

Be prepared to valet your car, as both locations have limited parking, but you definitely feel like a celebrity dining at Postinos!"}
{"text":"It's way too loud in here. I prefer the Central Ave. location."}
{"text":"Love postinos. Great atmosphere and simple menu. First time here but won't be my last. Got the bruschetta board. Mix and match to suite your taste. Defiantly 5 stars."}
{"text":"Lunch, hh, dinner, you are bound to have a good time with friends and a great meal!  Especially love when they have live music!  They have a great wine selection and relatively reasonably priced!  The paninis, salad and soup are great but most people go for the bruschetta!  Get a board of bruschetta and some wine and you are set.  Some of my favorites are the Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato & Basil; Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone; Warm Artichoke Spread; Tomato Jam & Fresh Sheeps Milk Cheese; Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomato; and the seasonal is usually great!  Gluten free bread is available!"}
{"text":"Tuesdays are the best obvs thanks to their special. Not really a dinner place but great place to hang out and have a variety of wine selections."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots for any time , any day of the week ! Everything here is yummy and delicious ! The staff is always awesome ! If I could give this place more stars - I would ! :)"}
{"text":"The OG Postino! Easily my favorite location - lots of space, many unique table options... Love their wine menu. Special pricing on wines M & T. Their bruschetta potions are incredible. My favorite panini is chicken & mozzarella. Everything is available in GF for an additional charge."}
{"text":"Nice place. Good food tastes fresh and light. No spirits as this place serves only beer and wine. PARKING IS HORRIBLE. Get valet!"}
{"text":"Based on yelp reviews, I decided to drop in for a quick weekday solo lunch. I ordered the quinoa salad, which was light and tasty (also a great value at $5 for the half salad). I also ordered the tomato jam and artichoke spread flatbreads to try. The flatbreads are more of a bruschetta (served on toasted baguette) rather than a traditional flatbread. I was actually pleasantly surprised and ate those up like nobody's business. I do wish the tomato jam had a tad of spice to it, because it did get too sweet in a weird way. Regardless, I can't wait to come back and try more flatbreads. Come early because by 11:45am the parking lot was full (though there is mandatory valet)."}
{"text":"Loooooove this place! Especially on Mon and Tues when you can get a bottle of wine and bruschetta for $20. Their different types of bruschetta are what make this place amazing. The prosciutto w/ fig; red pepper and goat cheese; and brie w/ apple are my favorites. 
Ambiance is great too. You can walk in dressed up or dressed down and not feel out of place. Lighting is low. Mood is chill. Service is great too."}
{"text":"Five stars all around:

The service is amazing. The food is perfectly presented and full of distinct flavors. The atmosphere is upbeat and relaxed AT THE SAME TIME! I don't know how they did it, but they figured out the recipe for a perfect wine bar..."}
{"text":"By far one of my most favorite restaurants in the entire Phoenix metro area. 

I've been coming to Postino for years now, it never let's me down. The clever and eclectic decor, staff and menu always lives up to hype.

You cannot beat their bruschetta and wine menu!! There is something for everyone and its a great place for groups, special occasions, dates and girls night!

You really can't go wrong with any of the upward projects restaurants, which is the reason why this is a go-to for me for when friends and family come to visit and every birthday :)"}
{"text":"Love coming here for $20 Tuesday deal; you just can't beat it.  I have to say, the salmon Bruschetta is my favorite of all of them.  The bottle deal can't be beat and the selections are nice. Very broad.  They change it every couple months as well, so always trying new wines.  Highly recommend getting a reservation because it's always packed on Tuesdays.  The service is great, though sometimes, if they are having a bad day, they tend to complain about how busy they are.  While I empathize, I'm here to relax and get away from my work troubles. Just be patient with them and they will treat you right."}
{"text":"Still one of my favorites.  The bruschetta is delicious and the fact that you can order different kinds appeasing my non-commital inability to make a decision self.  Tuesday nights are almost impossible to get a seat at now that they have a special running where you can get a bruschetta board and a bottle of wine for like $20.00 bucks or something ridiculous.  Have small bills with you as the parking situation almost requires that you go through the valet.  The restaurant is great for a light nibble or a heavier dinner if you get a pressed sandwich or salad.  (The chicken salad in particular is one of my favorites)  You'll see a lot of couples here on first dates (which can be a lot of fun to people watch)  I've seen some really awkward dates, and some really great ones were you're convinced you're seeing magic happen right in front of your very eyes."}
{"text":"This winebar is sexier than a fall desert night.  Or I should say WITH.  And given the clientele, service, and menu, it still feels down to earth.  I think Postino knows he's hot, so I'm not sure how he pulls it off.

The bruschetta menu is an interesting concept - 4 big slabs of fresh baked artisan bread, each heaped with your choice of toppings (like fig/prosciutto/marscarpone or tomato jam/sheep's milk cheese). The $24 bottle of Carmenere was complex and perfect with the food, surely a much pricier bottle masquerading as reasonable to make me happy.  Appetizers like white bean hummus and an artichoke dip you'd never catch dead at Chili's were also excellent."}
{"text":"My favorite place in the Valley! Whether you are there to drink wine or eat dinner this is the place to go. The servers are friendly, the food is delicious and the wine divine. They change their wine menu just enough to keep it interesting but not enough to be overwhelming. The bruschetta board is amazing - order it. Their sandwiches, soups and desserts are delicious. I do not have enough good things to say about this place!

Only two negatives - parking can be difficult and overcrowding can be an issue inside. So if you go on the weekends make sure to go early or be ready to stand and drink wine while you wait :)"}
{"text":"My first visit to Postino and it won't be my last. Seated on the outdoor patio, with the heaters on, in the evening along with wonderful service, was perfection. The wine selection was great, and a cute touch coming out in mini carafes. A great menu and the bruschetta fantastic!"}
{"text":"I have enjoyed Postino's for a long time.  The Monday and Tuesday night madness are for those who have the patience to have a great deal.  This location is great due to the patio and indoor seating.  I've always enjoyed the prosciutto with brie sandwich.  Try to bring cash when possible for valet.. Parking can get pretty crazy.  
Service is always Outstanding!  Worth the drive and wait!"}
{"text":"Well they don't need anymore reviews...but it's a great place! Lively atmosphere, tasty bruchetta ant The Bounty is a must try...a vegan delight but can be appreciated even by a carnivore. Worth trying out."}
{"text":"This place is one of Arcadia's treasures.  The wine selection is amazing here but it would be nothing without the educated, considerate, polite and helpful employees.  i have never had a bad night at this establishment.  My favorite night to go is on Tuesday's because they have the best deal in town-a board of Bruschetta (4) and a bottle of wine from their special menu for $20.  Plus if you don't finish the bottle-you can bag it and take it home!
My favorite Bruschetta are the roasted peppers w goat Cheese, the Apple and Fig and the Prosciutto and Mascarpone one...Mmmmmmm Delish!
If you haven't been in yet and you love to lounge, drink wine and listed to good music-GO HERE."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've been to quite a few wine bars these past few years around Phoenix and Los Angeles. This restaurant is by far the best one. It's my go to place to hang out and have some wine and bruschetta. I especially love the artichoke spread and smoke salmon Bruschetta. 

They have the best deal in town. $20 for a bottle of wine and bruschetta on Monday and Tuesday starting at 8pm. $5 dollar glass of wine deals all the other days.

I've also had their breakfast sandwich and salads. I hope they open one closer to North Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Bruschetta heaven! Postino Arcadia is a romantically decorated and very cute Italian wine bar in that I was dying to try during my short trip to Phoenix.

FOOD: 7/10
SERVICE: 7/10
ATMOSPHERE: 10/10

FOOD: 
+ Smoked Salmon with Pesto ($15 for 4 flavors): Yum! This was really great cause I'm a huge fan of smoked salmon and pesto. It wasn't particularly fresh or populated with salmon though. 

+ Almond Hummus & Tomato Bruschetta ($15 for 4 flavors): This was delicious as well! I highly recommend this if you like hummus.

+ Salami with Pesto Bruschetta ($15 for 4 flavors): This was okay! If it was up to me, I would've gotten another order of the Smoked Salmon with Pesto. There was only one piece of salami, and it was very mediocre.

+ Warm Artichoke Spread ($15 for 4 flavors): SO CHEESY. I can't particularly handle cheese, so I didn't like this at all. I do not recommend this if you don't love cheese.

+ Turkey Panini: Good enough! Nothing spectacular but it was tasty.

+ Brussel Sprouts Salad: Not what I was expecting AT ALL. It was mostly regular salad leaves with some brussel sprout leaves at the bottom. I was definitely expecting whole brussel sprouts or at least more of it. Not impressed with this.

SERVICE:
Decent service. They were attentive and refilled my water a lot but weren't very friendly.

ATMOSPHERE:
So cute! Very romantic. We sat on the outside patio where there was mist to keep us cool from the 107 degree Phoenix heat. Lots of lights and lush greenery. Good date spot.

Overall, would recommend it purely for the ambiance and bruschetta options. Not the freshest or best food I've had but pretty good for Phoenix restaurants."}
{"text":"Superb customer service during our dinner at Postino Arcadia. There was not one person who was not smiling, friendly, helpful or customer focused. The host was busy when I came in so another server immediately jumped into help and seated our party. She then went and got us waters immediately while we waited for our server to come. We started with meal with the olives and then both had salads. I had the Hannah's Field Salad - Kale, quinoa, Fuji apple, apricot, toasted almonds, pecorino stagionato, and pickled red onion with apple cider-mustard vinaigrette. It was quite tasty, a little dry so maybe a splash more of vinaigrette, and the quinoa was cooked perfectly.  A nice blend of flavors and textures throughout. The place has a very nice wine, beer, beverage and cocktail list and you can even take a bottle of wine to go. The place looks like a converted gas station and they have outdoor seating and various seating areas inside.  Note:  Valet parking is $3 upon leaving."}
{"text":"I have been going to Postino since it opened. I remember the Matt Diamond era, Susan era and now the Brent Karlicheck era. I really like the evolution as to what it has become.
Now granted, I am personal friends with Brent (and Matt) so I want to disclose this upfront, but I am elated with the new direction of the wine program as I think it is superior to most in its consumer friendly format.
Grab a plate of bruschetta and $5 glass of ABC (anything but Cabernet) at the bar. Ask Brent or the chilled staff to help you pick something great.

Like the mythical Arcas, you can bear the budget bacchanalian orgy right in the heart of Arcadia"}
{"text":"I have been here several times for brunch and I know I'm surly one of very few who have not hit the happy hour here, but I will.  Close to home, great food.  Service has always been wonderful."}
{"text":"My favorite place on a Monday or Tuesday night!  $20 for a huge plate of bruschettas and a bottle of wine....need I say more?  The atmosphere is just right.  Low key and classy feel.  I almost want to say Starbucks for wine, but I think it's pushing it.  I don't mind attending this fine dine and wine place any other night, but if you're free on Monday or Tuesday...why not?"}
{"text":"I used to come here a lot more before I moved to Gilbert and I miss it. Monday nights ordering pizza from LaGrande Orange was always fantastic, the bartenders are chatty and full of advice, and the place just hums. It's very laid back and it's a great place for a conversation with your girls/boys or a nice start to a date night. Can't wait til it opens in Gilbert!"}
{"text":"What a delightful little place! The atmosphere is laid back (my husband was in shorts and flip flops and didn't feel out of place), the lighting was dim and our group had a table at the couches, so it gave it almost a loungey feel. Plus the night we were there, the doors were open which allowed an open, airy feel. The wine list isn't huge, which is surprising for a wine bar...I didn't sample any of the wines (I'm waiting to go back for lunch one day for the $5 glasses), but the beer list was good. You can't go wrong with a place that serves Stella Artois, one of my favorite beers.  We had the bruschetta and it was filling enough for dinner. We had a double order of the brie, green apple and fig spread (absolutely delicious); tomato, mozzarella and basil (my least favorite of the third we tried...not enough mozzarella for me); and the roasted peppers and goat cheese (I didn't try it because my husband hogged it, so obviously it was a winner with him).  Our bill was $40 which included the bruschetta, 4 drinks, tax and tip. Not bad at all!

Yes the parking lot is super small, so most likely you'll have to valet for $3. It didn't bother me since I was expecting it, and when our car had to be brought around, it was fast."}
{"text":"Postino has 3 locations around the Valley!  I've been to 2 of them now and the one thing you can say about Postino, they are an amazing place to dine/drink and they are very consistent with service, quality and ambiance.  

We typically go the Postino on Central, however we dined here a couple of weeks ago with some friends and found them to be fantastic! I really like the patio area!! It was too cold for us on this trip however this is a \"must come back\" kinda of place just to enjoy a great meal on their patio!!

Food~ if your dining for lunch go straight to the salads and/or bruschettas!!  Their portions are actually larger than you think and after you pick and choose some of the different ones to eat, you'll thank me for passing on the apps!!  

However if you re dinning for dinner or have a larger group or a huge appetite, then go ahead and order some apps.  I suggest trying their Bella Postino~ warm artichoke dip and white bean hummus with assorted breads or their Butcher's Block~ with different artisan meats and cheeses served with Tuscan beans, olives, nuts and crostini.  Both are DELISH!  

Bruschetta's~ here are some of our faves;  Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone, the Smoked Salmon with Pesto is my go to!! The Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomato is also a go to!  We also like to try their seasonal burchettas as well!  

Paninis~ go for the prosciutto with brie or their Nine Iron with smoked bacon layered with grilled chicken, fresh burrata mozzarella, lettuce, beefsteak tomato and special sauce = nom.nom.nom!! 

Service~  our service was a little slower than what we are used to at their Central location however our server was very friendly, knew the menu well and tried her best to keep up.

All in all it was a FANTASTIC experience!! My friends and I are looking forward to coming back on a Monday or Tuesday when they have their $20 special, a bottle of wine and burchetta ~ put me down for 2 please! I hope to see you there."}
{"text":"I had lunch here on 11-4 with my mom and her friend I loved my chicken mozzarella sandwich and brushetta. It was cheap plus they have complimentary valley parking. Loved the service and casual atmosphere. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"1,200 people can't be wrong... incredibly fresh ingredients, simple preparation but powerful flavors and experience. Really enjoyed the brunch \"Farm Scramble\".

A++"}
{"text":"My sister had been talking about how great this place is, but it's a little out of the way for me so I didn't get a chance to check it out until recently. WOW! It totally lives up to the hype! I'm from the east coast and miss \"mom & pop\" type restaurants that are charming and unique. This place totally made me feel at home. 

Not only was the food incredible (we got 4 types of bruschettas and the meat/cheese board), but the presentation was great too! It was just enough food for a late dinner and wasn't outrageously priced. 

It was a good crowd of people too... \"normal\"! I didn't see any NoSco Cougars, Downtown Hippies or Old Town D-bags. A welcomed change!

The ambiance is perfect! Dim lighting, eclectic decor, awesome patio and even cute little touches like the pieces of paper they have to put your gum in - LOVE IT! 

I'm hooked for sure!"}
{"text":"The owners of Postino, LGO, Chelsea's and Radio Milano have the right recipe!  

I highly recommend this place for:
wine selection
great date night
delicious bruschetta 
the laid back music
$20 bottle of wine and bruschetta Mon & Tues
$5 wines
day drinking"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere, amazing bruschetta.  Sunday brunch is the best - I love the live music!  They treat customers well too, especially if you join the mailing list."}
{"text":"i haaaaaaaaaaate to jump on the love-bandwagon, but.... the bruschetta made me do it! it is sooooooo goooooood! i'm glad i convinced my bf to try it out, although he was pretty hesitant after reading the choices. we had the fresh mozzarella/basil/tomato, smoked salmon, prosciutto/fig/mascarpone, and apple/brie/fig bruschetta.  in the end, we couldn't decide which one was our favorite, since they were all pretty delish... except we agreed we were a bit disappointed with the mozzarella - it was good, but nothing spectacular. the smoked salmon was a tad salty for me, but it was my bf's fave.  my taste leaned more towards the prosciutto and apple.

entrees: 1/2 turkey panini + 1/2 panzanella salad - which was tasty, but a tad greasy, and i ended up wondering why i ordered the panzanella.  autostrata panini + side salad - again, tasty, but a tad salty, HOWEVER the side salad was AWESOME, and so much better than my salad!  i was actually a little disappointed with myself, bc i could have instead saved 50cents, had a full turkey panini (saving 1/2 for lunch tomorrow...), AND had a delish salad to boot. *insert dramatic sigh here*.  

how good is this side salad? let's just say, my bf usually avoids salads like the plague, but he decided that when we come back, he's having the whole turkey panini + the side salad. and i traded the rest of my turkey panini for the last few bites of his salad. THAT good, people. i gave up meat for a salad.

as for the atmosphere... yeah, it's loud and dim and trendy (perhaps not the best place for a first date), BUT the waitstaff is really nice, and they were lightning-quick to refill our teeny water glasses with mostly-ice water. but they were so nice about it, that we just smiled as we chewed our ice like thirsty camels. the decor is truly fabulous, and the crowd isn't TOO snobby. the weather is nice enough that walking down the street to park isn't a huge pain. would i go back? definitely. but i'd probably only order the bruschetta. and that side salad..."}
{"text":"Met up with a few friends here yesterday afternoon. The decor is awesome! Artsy, minimal, lots of windows and candles. I like the seating: sectional modern couches around rustic tables. I split the bruschetta sampler with my friend [tomato jam, roasted pepper, prosciutto, and salami]. Delicious! It was unlike any appetizer I've had. Very flavourful and different. The tomato jam was especially impressive. 

Staff is good, my water never went empty, and the atmosphere is very cool. Five stars when I try the wine."}
{"text":"Food and service is amazing as always! The staff is always courteous and the bounty board is fantastic."}
{"text":"They had me at $5 glasses of wine and beer pitchers everyday until 5pm! I heard about Postino from a few friends and of course, Yelp, so we made it there for New Years Day brunch before catching our flight. 

We sat outside because the weather was amazing. The outdoor patio is a great place for wonderful vibes, a nice view and good service. 

This location is in a neighborhood and definitely would be a frequent stop for me if I lived nearby. Tons of people coming in to buy wine to go because you can and it's $9 off bottles!

We ordered the Farmer's Scramble and the Roast Beef Panini (on ciabatta). 

Both were outstanding! The Scramble was so moist, cheesy and earthy. And the greens on the side were so simple and tasty. 

I ordered a glass of the French Rosé and it paired perfectly with the Scramble and the weather. 

Service was a tad slower than I hoped and that's why they didn't get a 5 star review. But overall, they seemed to have the flow down."}
{"text":"I'd pass on this place. The music is way too loud. We asked the waitress to turn it down, but it remained loud. You can't hear people less than 2 feet away. We were served, but never checked on. I ordered a salad which had NO dressing at all, so I flagged down another waiter and asked him for salad dressing, but everyone in my party (7 total) was already done eating by the time I started eating. The salad was gross. They put the inedible type of letters and sandwich sliced turkey in it! Yuck. The bruschetta was actually good. Not coming back. 

Update: The owner reached out to me and apologized for my bad experience; he has made an effort to make things right, so thank you!"}
{"text":"OK.  We've all been here a million times in the evening for bruschetta and wine.

I was in the area and decided to give them a try for lunch.

The nine iron panini was fantastic.  I ordered it on ciabatta bread and the chicken, bacon, burrata, lettuce and tomato ingredients made this a winner.

It was strange being here during the day, and not drinking wine, but I'll definitely be back soon for another panini for lunch."}
{"text":"Postino is delicious, reasonably priced and fun.  The only bummer is they don't have a full bar."}
{"text":"I have been to this location on 3 separate occasions. Food is consistently delicious!! Parking is consistently crappy. You have to be one of the lucky 5 people to get a non-valet spot. If you don't, good luck finding street parking that isn't resident-only. Sometimes your only choice is valet. I guess I'm cheap, but it makes me angry that I have to tip a guy to walk 10 feet to get my car. Oh well.
2 of the 3 times I have been the service was great. This last time, was not so great. I was in a large party (~10 people) and they sat us right away, which was awesome. The place was not very busy as we were there for a very early dinner on a Sunday (4pm). Our waiter took our drink orders at 4:15, they were delivered and then disappeared until 5 (which is, you guessed it, then end of Happy Hour). He came back at 5:01 on the dot. Kinda sucks. As we were all hungry and eager to order, but it was not until sometime later that he re-appeared for the food order. \

He did the whole, \"I'm too awesome to write down any of your orders\" bit. Even though we were each getting an order of Bruchetta (which gives the option to choose 4). Luckily, he got our orders correct, but if he hadn't? I am not going to tip you more because you didn't write it down!  Even if you get it right 95% of the time, it's really crappy for that 5% that you mess up! Anyway, our food came and it was delish! 

When our bill came, I realized why he didn't show his face more than the few times over the 3 hours that we were sitting there....they pre-added in his tip. 20%! He was made whether he gave us good service or not. 

I will be going back because, like I said, I usually have great service and ALWAYS have great food....but this one encounter did put a sour taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Best wine and bruschetta deal on Monday and Tuesday nights. Can't beat a bottle of wine and 4 bruschetta for $20!  Can get a little crowded for this so come early."}
{"text":"went back again as do like the brushchetta..this time much better...the brushchetta was cut properly and the ingredients were proper. The menu has been updated a bit and the offerings
were better overall. (some breakfast items for example)  It is a bit loud and the music offerings
are kind of odd...good service though and considerations for requests like NO dairy products
for those who cannot consume them..."}
{"text":"Went here last night for date night. Couldn't have asked for a better atmosphere or better service that just added to a great experience. 

We had been to Postinos before, but never to this location. We sat outside and the lighting of the place was perfect for a romantic night. The service was incredible. I believe our server was Mark. We were in between two types of bruschetta for our last pick and he ended up bringing the other one we didn't order just so we could try it - on the house. It only would have been an extra $4 for us to try, but it was the gesture that really impressed us. 

We will definitely be back again for the food, but we loved the service at this location!!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with friends. I had a kale salad with chicken. Hardly any kale and the chicken was ripped up pieces of lunch meat!  For a small sized salad that is priced at $14 it's seriously lacking. For that price point it's legitimate to expect grilled chicken breast, especially since the salad is so small.  Also, they need to turn the music down a bit so patrons can visit with each other."}
{"text":"$5 happy hour? Craaaaazzzzzy. We had some amazing wine, and a pitcher (2 pints) of beer. Seriously, this place is great for casual, relaxing drinking. Also, the servers were really nice and welcoming. I really enjoyed this restaurant. Especially the complimentary valet."}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favorite places. The people who work there are always awesome and \"on it\". The food is great and I just love the atmosphere; whether it's during the day or at night with the candlelight. I also love the music they play. I always feel calm and happy here. I'd highly recommend."}
{"text":"The place has a great ambience. Free valet- awesome. The bruschetta is amazing. So are the salads. The only thing I wasn't happy with was the bread on their paninis. I orders the focaccia which was a little to hard or over toasted for my palate.   I'm in love with the place .. too bad I was just passing through town :(."}
{"text":"This place was an awesome place that you can get a charcuterie board, soup, sandwich all at a nice price. Really liked the options here, you can keep it light and get a good meal here.

The charcuterie board options were amazing. Very fresh meats and flavorful cheese. They give you a decent amount for the money and there is more than enough to share.

I really wish they had one of these type places back home, I would go often if that were the case."}
{"text":"Everyone talks about the bruschetta and for good reason (so the 5th star is really for the bruschetta).  Good portion sizes and very delicious.  My friend and I ordered the tomato/basil/fresh mozzarella, salami and pesto, tomato jam and fresh sheep's milk cheese, and prosciutto with figs & mascarpone.  All very delicious!

We also ordered a vegetarian panini and a turkey one with romain salad.  We were so full after the bruschetta.  I managed to finish half of my sandwich and the salad.  The panini's are fine, not amazing, but yummy.  I think next time I'm in town I'll have the bruschetta and a salad. 

What's nice is they let my well-behaved dog join us on the patio."}
{"text":"Love love love this place!  If I could go every Sunday drink wine, eat a bruchetta board and listen to music I would.  Mixed diverse crowd and great service! win win!"}
{"text":"Postino has one of the best happy hours I've ever been to! 

I wish I lived in the area so I could go back. The vibe is just mellow and coooool (with my hand flat, slowly motioning from right to left). We had a long wait for a flight and thought we would stop by for their 11-7 happy hour. They had a nice selection of $5 wines and pitchers of premium beers. For $5 you really can't go wrong, but despite the low price the quality of everything I had was fantastic. 

You must also try their bruschetta. We tried a selection of them and they were all amazing. My favorite was the goat cheese with roasted peppers. The service was great throughout, especially since we took up a prime table for about 4 hours. Our goal was to taste everything and we almost did it before our flight! 

Just another reason why Phoenix is a pretty cool city. Just as San Diego should stay classy, Phoenix should stay coooool!"}
{"text":"The food here is great. I have tried nearly ever type of bruschetta and haven't been disappointed- favorites include the tomato jam, salmon, and prosciutto fig. Also the chicken and mozzarella panini is one of my favorite sandwiches ever. The reason why I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the service- sometimes it's good and sometimes it's just meh... Regardless, we keep going back for the delicious food."}
{"text":"Bruschetta, paninis, butchers block... and obviously wine!! I have been to every Postino location and this one remains my favorite! Great food, atmosphere, staff... and of course again the wine! The only thing about this location is the parting situation. You have to valet, or park a mile away and walk."}
{"text":"Some of the girls and I decided to venture out of the hotel bar and try out some local flavor.  We found this \"wine bar\" not far from our hotel and thought what a great way to wind down the evening.  We arrived a little after 9pm and the wait was 20 minutes. (I now know that they have specials on Tuesday nights!)  Anyway, the place was a mad house!  And it seemed to me more like a restaurant that sold wine by the glass rather than a traditional wine bar where you could taste and sample different wines.  I tried a temparnillo and the other girls had a verdejo and a chenin blanc.  All were fair, but nothing spectacular.  I just enjoy a little education about the wine, region, winemaker, etc. when I'm trying something new.  Postino did however, have a very cool contemporary design and a great atmosphere.  It seemed like the hip place to hang for the mid 20's to 30's set!  I'll definitely give it another try, next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Not good ,, too small... n its overrated! who waits 1hr for a glass of wine., i would rather get a bottle n drink at home."}
{"text":"This was my first time to this place, not really knowing anything about it - only joining my friend for her birthday. Not alot of parking, but that is pretty much the only thing I could possibly complain about. Nice intimate atmostphere to just have good solid fun with good people. Customer service was good (server took my beer/glass - without asking me if I wanted another). The bathroom is very clean and can probably be described as very zen-like. Food wise - the bruschetta impressed me alot, actually the whole place did so I will definately be back. Mostly to participate in the 11-4 5$ wine!!"}
{"text":"I'm on a huge Postino kick lately and had another awesome dinner there last night with five girlfriends.  Since my last review of this place was in 2008, I figured it was time for an update, but honestly, not too much has changed since then - I'm a very loyal customer and have been for years!

My favorite menu items are still the same too:
The artichoke dip (which actually comes with hummus too but I always special request double artichoke instead because I love it so much), the mixed green salad with added turkey, chicken, or prosciutto, and the bruschetta board... My top two bruschetta faves are Brie & Apple with Fig Spread and Prosciutto, Fig & Mascarpone. Mmmmm!

I'm not currently drinking (I'm prego again), but of course this is the perfect place to go for a glass of wine or four as well!  

Service is always fabulous and the atmosphere rocks too.  So in my eyes, this place deserves five stars... even almost five years from my original review!

Of course, it is worth noting that it's not only a favorite of mine, there are plenty of others that love it too... so, sometimes you may have to wait a bit.  If you've got a large party (eight or more), I highly recommend making a reservation ahead of time."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!!  One of my favorites in the Phoenix metro area.  I mainly go here for the Bruschetta on Mon and Tues nights after 8pm for their $20 wine bottle and bruschetta board (feeds 2).  Favorite Bruschetta:  1 - Salmon, 2- Apple and Brie with Fig Jam, 3- Prosciutto, fig, and marscapone, 4- White Bean.  Honestly, I could eat there every single day."}
{"text":"Postino is my favorite restaurant in all of Phoenix. We love their Monday and Tuesday night special... A board of bruschetta and bottle of wine for $20!!! I really enjoy their Tempranillo, Malbec, and Sangiovese, and my favorite bruschetta flavors are the brie and apple with fig spread, prosciutto and fig with mascarpone, salami and pesto, ricotta and dates, and my absolute favorite is the goats milk cheese and tomato jam. They also usually have really delicious hearty soup and I love their salads and paninis. They have $5 glasses of wine before 5pm every day and their peach bellinis are perfect for Sunday brunch. My husband likes their mini pitchers of beer. We would eat here every day if we could. The only negative is the shortage of parking spaces, forcing you to valet. I've also been to their Gilbert and Central Phoenix locations, which are bigger and really nice as well."}
{"text":"very good food and nice atmosphere,  but unfortunately very VERY poor service, i will not be returning . Classified as a \"high class restaurant \" and servers are walking around with no smiles and average clothes , i couldnt even tell the server apart from a regular customer until she filled up my water with no expression on her face and no personality . i would much rather be next door at the Orange Cafe , they know how to run a business ."}
{"text":"We went back three Sundays in a row just so I could try more of that wonderful bruschetta. That's not overboard is it? Yanno when you eat something so good you want it again and again until you can get it out of your head? That was me with this bruschetta. The white sangria was the perfect addition. All enjoyed on their magical patio that's not too hot even at 100+ degrees. *sigh* ... ok, someone tell me four weeks in a row is not stalker levels? Can you stalk a restaurant?"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and even better food. Order bruschetta (obviously) and make sure you get at least one prosciutto and fig in your flight! The Italian Picnic salad is amazing- goat cheese... bacon... I mean what more could you want?! The only downside is you're almost forced to use valet parking. Pretty annoying but hey, what can you do? Carry a couple bucks on you for the valet."}
{"text":"If you have not been to Postino's....WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?!!? This is one of those hidden gems...I enjoy everything about this place.

The food- excellent
The Wine-  cant go wrong
Service- Always have been very please
Price- Fair
Wait time- Yes...Ive had the pleasure of waiting a few times, but its worth the wait.

Be back soon..."}
{"text":"I have been to Postino's before and I love their bruscetta, I believe we had the artichoke, apple, sweet pepper and I cannot remember the other. It was delicious. I went there this time for 'liner' (lunch/dinner) and I decided to get the goat cheese panini, I believe is what it was... I was not really impressed. The Salad was amazing, although the panini not so much. 

On a side note, I say it isn't good for kids because it's a wine bar, not a restaurant really. However, they do have highchairs available for those that need/want them. It's probably more safe that if you're going to have a glass of wine, leave the kids at home. That's my opinion, but I've found it's more enjoyable without the wee ones. (I have one, so don't think I'm antichildren)

Also, I say it's trendy because it is. I guess depends what spot you are heading to. I always feel like I'm not cutsie enough when I go in, but you know what? I'm paying and relaxing and that's all that matter... I say go casual if you're brave like me, and don't mind a head turn from one or two noticing your shoes don't match your ____."}
{"text":"I doubt there is much else I can say about this place that hasn't been said. It is an easy place to love; the bruschetta, the salads, the wine, the service...it seems that they really have perfected it. Anytime this place comes up in a conversation on whether or not to go, my answer will always be Yes, Yes, YES!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Love all the food and the staff is great.  We drive from Gilbert to have lunch at Postino's Arcadia.  We understand a new location here in Gilbert will be opening soon.  Can hardly wait. I do recommend this place to everyone I meet."}
{"text":"I love this place!  It's on my short list of places to make sure to take visitors.  I always get the bruschetta and there are so many different options to choose from it never gets old.  One of favorites in the valley."}
{"text":"I have only been here one time but it was a great experience. THe bruschetta is delicious and the wine was great. I really like the bruschetta and wine for $20 deal. You get more than what you pay for. The servers are very knowledgeable and the atmoshpere is calming."}
{"text":"I just moved to Dallas, TX from Phoenix, and my husband and I have been constantly seeking something that is HALF as good as a Postinos. Not only is the wine selection great, but the bruschetta is life changing. I always ask for the servers favorite vegetarian options.

Try the creme brulee (and thank me later!)"}
{"text":"What a nice place. Visited for lunch on a Saturday to be greeted by friendly parking valets. Had a very tasty panini and entree salad with a few glasses of wine. Everything was wonderful and service was friendly, fast, and efficient. The building is also quaint and in a trendy location that provides a solid vibe.

Only complaints, minor ones: First, management has still not redone the wine list to reflect the absence of a selection which we know they haven't had for some time, as we visited the Gilbert location weeks ago; secondly, the on-tap beer selections are a tad embarrassingly underwhelming for a nice place like this. Yet, on the whole, a definite keeper."}
{"text":"OK! Where do I start......, first things first let's start with the amazing Bruschetta........

OMG! OMG! It was by far the best Bruschetta I have ever tasted..... If you don't try anything in your life... 

This is a must!!! I know, I know it's toasted bread but it's not the bread it's the toppings on the bread......
 
I had the Brie and apples with fig spread: the Brie and fig melted in your mouth and then here comes the crunch from the apple... POW!!

Fresh Moz w/tomatoes you can't go wrong! 
Smoked salmon with pesto.... Yummy 
White bean with chopped tomatoes....round two please..

At first I looked at the price...$14 for Bruschetta but you get to choose up to 4 different varieties so that was great. Worth every penny!!!!!

The wine was delicious!! Before 5pm all wines on the wine list are $5 so keep them coming! (I had the Victor wine it's a red zinfandel with vanilla under tones) 

I also order the mixed greens salad... Don't let the name fool you.  It's was soooooo good! 

It had shaved pears, candied pecans, red grapes, Gorgonzola, leeks and mixed fresh greens...,this combo of flavor sent me on a tail spin... ( I know I'm a drama queen) 

My husband had the turkey panini it was delicious but nothing to scream about.  

Desserts was the crème de la crème of desserts....salted caramel sundae..... Vanilla bean ice cream with chocolate cover corn nuts and two pretzels on the side with a side of salted caramel to drizzle on top!!!! Yummy!!!! 

This place has a warm and inviting atmosphere. The host was very accommodating. 

Get there early!!!
This place is always crowded and I see why!"}
{"text":"I just love Postino Arcadia, not only for the great food, but the atmosphere. I recently spent a few hours here catching up with a girlfriend. We sat at the bar and shared a brushettsa board (seriously, so good), each a cup of yummy soup and some Diet Cokes. Not a big wino, but this is THE spot if I was. You can't go wrong with a brushetta board and a bottle of wine, which is $20 Mon and Tues after 8. The staff was so friendly and the vibe was relaxed. I just love coming here to unwind from the work week. For chilly nights, bring a jacket as it's a somewhat open restaurant. And yeah, parking really blows. They do have valet, which is nice, but I would rather park my own car (and I never have cash, ugh). Neverthless, it won't keep me from coming back. Love me some Postino's. You will too."}
{"text":"This seems like a really fun place!  I was there on a Tuesday nite, and the it was completely slammed.  To the point that you couldn't even hear the person sitting 2 people away.  That was kinda frustrating, but it's obviously a popular place!  

The bruschetta was huge and amazing, as was the cheese plate. There was a great selection of wine (and beer I think)  however they don't have a full bar.  (no liquor).

Parking was all valet out front because every single space in their tiny parking lot was filled.  The neighborhood around is all resident only parking, but I managed to find a spot at the end of 39th street where the end few spaces were not just for residents.    

I deff want to try this place again, just hopefully on a not so crowded evening to really get a feel for it."}
{"text":"I honestly can say it doesn't get much better then Postino's.  I absolutely love this place.  Huge wine selection, the best sangria, wonderful staff and the Bruschetta is to die for.  

If you haven't been to Postino's you are missing out."}
{"text":"An ALL time Phoenix favorite of mine for lunch, that I have neglected to Review, but was reminded by this most recent visit.

Taking something so simple (Brushetta, A Cheese Plate, Soups) and turning them into \"works of art\" is an art in itself. Have eaten mostly everything on the menu at one time or another and am NEVER disappointed. They even changed my mind about liking brie - well of course their \"Triple Cream Brie\" had a lot to do with that - heavenly!

Their Brushetta, in addition to being beautiful to look at is absolutely FABULOUS Haven't had one I didn't like, in spite of the fact I am NOT all that fond of Smoked Salmon or Tuna, but loved their preparation!

Did I mention the \"Grilled Cheese?\" 

Don't ask - JUST ORDER IT! 

$6? Are they nuts? 

No, it is worth it!

Kind of what I think each time I order it!

Lots of fun to have many for a great selection with several people sharing. Probably ALL but the soups should be shared and even the soups can be, if you are with someone you really care about!

Go, don't wait! Wonderful for lunch, nice for a casual dinner and the wait staff is generally terrific!"}
{"text":"I'm a HUGE-O fan of this place!!  YUUUMMMM-AHHH for DAYS!!!  Lemme just say the last time I was there... I had wine like it was goin' outta style! And the food.  What a treat!  Four stars for that.  One less for not being open 24-hours."}
{"text":"This place absolutely lives up to the hype! We have been going to postino for years now and are never disappointed. The food is great and the atmosphere is even better. Try any of the bruschetta and you will be happy!"}
{"text":"Postino Arcadia is one of my top choices for Sunday brunch.  Don't get me wrong - you can definitely go and have a rocking time for evening cocktails and snacks, but I think they shine the brightest for Sunday brunch.  If I'm in this area in the evening, we'll usually grab pizza from LGO instead.  First of all, the portions are great - some fancier places serve small brunch portions which can leave you a little hungry, but you won't have that issue at Postino.  Do yourself a favor and start with the farmhouse scone.  I'm not a huge scone fan, but this one is perfection.  My go-to meals are the grilled focaccia or the smoked salmon.  Order one (or both) - neither will disappoint!  For drinks, you can get french press coffee or treat yourself and have a mimosa or bellini ($5 each).  The atmosphere is very friendly (sit outside if you can) and the service is great.  I highly recommend this place (unless you arrive before me and take my table)!  Also, there is free valet during busier hours!"}
{"text":"Love Postino. They have a fantastic brunch on the weekend. Even if you are not a wine drinker you will find something you will love."}
{"text":"Postino has really evolved their restaurant for the better over the past 5 or so years since I began going there.

Their wine list has always been, current, going with the latest trends in grapes ... from Cabs in the early 00s, to Pinots in 03-04, and now featuring Malbec and Tempranillos.  

While this is slightly frustrating as a wine (whine?) snob, i have to give it up to Postino for making available the varietals that people like me want to drink when they're spending $11 a glass at a wine bar.

I'll always pretty much have a soft spot for this place, as it was the site of some magical shit between me and my gf (Iknow, I'm romantic) on our first ever date.  So, if you ever need an idea for a first date, or a 50th date, this is your spot.

My favorite thing on their menu is the Bruschetta board (and please say the freaking word right), and all of their choices of toppings.  Mmmm, Brie and Granny Smith apples, Mmmm, prosciutto, Mmmm, white tuscan beans ... etc

This place gets super packed to the point of claustrophobia, so thats my only minor annoyance ... oh and the smoking area that is nearly in Peoria."}
{"text":"Review #83 and nothing surprising to report here. 

Parking is still rough, but if you know what you're getting into then you park a little bit down the street and hoof it up to the corner.

Bruschetta is still amazing. If you have a group of 3+ get two orders and a big mix of them so everyone can try something new. 

I come for wine lunches because the 5 dollar glasses are great. The beer list was also surprisingly good the last time I visited (Late Nov 2008). Including some great imports and domestic craft beers.

I usually stick with a salad or a sandwich for lunch and I've never been disappointed. Nothing specific to suggest, go with something that you generally like and I'm sure you won't be either.

Wait staff has always been pleasant and available when we needed them to be. I always make an effort to ask how their day is going, be friendly and engaging on the initial introduction. This usually helps ensure that they look forward to serving our group, rather than cringe at coming back.

You cannot go wrong with a lunch date here and I'd venture to say that dinner is just as good. Don't miss this gem tucked away in the east/central Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Absolutely nothing better than the bruscetta, boards and wine...other than the atmosphere.  straight out of old portland for those who love a real hangout place.  hot day or cold, this place just warms you up and keeps it cool."}
{"text":"Well DUH!

I could eat their bruschetta for days and days. I think the plate is well-priced and perfect for sharing. And the bread is so soft....yummy! Oh yeah, they have wine.

Plus it was where me  my boyfriend went on our first date (and my first time there), so obvs. it holds some sentimental value."}
{"text":"Love this place- there's a vibe here that's just fun and vibrant.  And I am addicted to their bruschetta and their antipasto plate.  
How good is this place?  Some days, I get physical cravings for their bruschetta and I just have to have some- or when I am having a bad day- you guessed it- having some of their bruschettas makes me feel better.
I've had bruschetta at other restaurants but none compared to the ones from Postino.  I think when they spread that topping on those yummy bread, they are thinking good cheer and loving thoughts- how else can you explain the addictive qualities of toppings placed on top of pieces of bread?
Love this place and I' would go back again and again."}
{"text":"$5 WINE and BRUSCHETTA FROM THE GODS. WHAT MORE CAN YOU ASK FOR?

It was my first time in Phoenix this weekend and I wanted to shoot myself because I was disappointed by so many places that people raved about on yelp/tripadvisor (i.e. Carolina's, Desert Botanical Garden, The Vig - to name a few)

I stopped by Postino's on my last day there and if it wasn't for this place, I would probably never visit again.

FYI - stop by La Grande Grocery next door and try the A-Z cookie. It's BOMB."}
{"text":"I like the original here next to La Grande Orange, but the one on Central is closer, nevertheless on this visit, there were plenty of open seating, and it was nice and cool.  I ordered a mocha, as I felt it was one of those mocha Sundays after a beer Saturday.  The mocha was the best I have ever had.  I also ordered for our table the Mozzarella and Tomatoes which was really tasty and was the perfect size appetizer.  I ordered my fave, The Autostrada, which was perfect, and the bread was crispy but not over done.  We had a bit of mishap with when it came to the check, as someone had made a mistake, however another member quickly resolved the issue without question.  That is why I return again and again to this place, also the vocal entertainment that was there also provided a great Sunday lunch experience."}
{"text":"went on June 8th with some girlfriends
we sat at end of bar due to 25 min wait for table.
Waiter had a condescending way of saying \"you are going to eat here\"?  
Then later everyone got food except me, he said I did not order and I know I ordered first. The girls were confused about what to order so I also helped them choose and he said he thought I was sharing with them. He asked if I wanted to order, first I said no and then decided I would.
Here is what ticked me off ..he said\" I thought I would step back until you realized the stupid thing you said\" I couldn't believe he would say that and from then on his service was absent.
food was good but his behavior as a professional server was disappointing ...."}
{"text":"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE Postino's!  Ask me any night of the week where I'd like to dine, and this place would be on my top three list.  The rotating wine menu, the bruschetta, the fantastic house salad, the delectable desserts, the bruschetta, the fantastically crafted sandwiches - did I mention the bruschetta?  Definitely try the prosciutto with figs and mascarpone!  The service here is very good as well, and their hours are fairly accommodating for late evening diners.  On Monday nights there is also the added bonus of being able to order pizza from the pizzeria across the parking lot, and there are a few nights you can find a DJ there mixing it up if that's your thing.  My only (small) issues with this place?  Parking absolutely stinks, and the acoustics leave a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Last night I made my second trip to Postino and was in the company of a very lovely young woman. Lucky me :) I had been to this location one other time, but I wasn't there very long and I forgot what I ate. SO, i was really looking forward to this trip. Plus, Amber W was kind enough to give me a gift card for Christmas. Thanks Amber! 

The parking here is sort of on the ridiculous side because the lot is so small. You have to valet your vehicle. I think it was $3. It was busy when we arrived and were quoted about 25 minutes. So we went over to the waiting area to start with some wine. We didn't even have a chance to order because our table was ready already. We were seated outside and I feared for my date's life because it was a little chilly and I don't think the dress she was wearing was really made for winter nights. Thankfully there was a heater planted right behind her. 

Our server took our drink orders promptly. I had the Tierra de Luna Malbec. Very good. She had a Reisling, which was very sweet and fruity. Started with the bruschetta and holy schnikes! I could have eaten this all night. We opted for the Smoked Salmon with capers and Pesto, the Tomato, Basil, & Mozzarella, the Ricotta with pistachios and dates, and the Brie with apples and fig spread. All of them were amazing! I am not a salmon fan, but this smoked salmon was delicious! It was also my first attempt at Brie. This too was good. 

For the meal, my lady friend or special lady, (Big Lebowski random quote) had the Raspberry Chicken salad. It was chunky chicken salad on a bed of greens with a raspberry vinaigrette. I was told it was good. I went for the half panini and soup combo. I had the Vegetarian with the Tomato and Gorgonzola soup. Originally the wrong panini came out. The server got it replaced and put the wrong one in a to go box to take home. Thought that was nice for the mix up. The soup was excellent. It is a very close second to The Roosevelt's tomato soup. The Vegetarian panini was good, but could have used a little more veggies on it. 

Unfortunately there was no room for dessert, but they all sounded amazing. Overall, a great experience with great food and drink. Service was great and the atmosphere was perfect. 

Again, thanks Amber W for the gift!!!"}
{"text":"City girls find Postino. Last night my cousin brought me to this place and I fell in love with it. The ambiance is warm and inviting. The staff was courteous, very pleasant, and incredibly attentive; they came around often to check up on us. Stevie (bartender) was great! Ahhh Bruschettas.. What can I say? Plainly delicious, amazing selection, our four choices were all sinfully mouth-watering. The star of the night, the Wine was just delightful. This is our new Tuesdays spot! This city girl just had New York City moment in Arizona."}
{"text":"I flew in from a chilly gray day in San Antonio to a gorgeous day in Phoenix. Had lunch on the patio here.. just wanted something light and this was perfect. Assorted Bruschetta, caprese salad and chilled Riesling. Everything was perfect, the food, the service, the atmosphere, the weather. I can't believe I had lived here for 8 years and had never been!"}
{"text":"everything about this restaurant is great.  scottsdale vibe without all the attitude.  good wine and great food at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Postino's is absolutely amazing.. service is okay and the bruchetta (sp?)... omg that stuff is amazing... I seriously dream about it sometimes. Wine sometimes tastes like the bottle has been open too long so now I just get a bottle of my own to take home. Overall, one of our favorite places to go! Great decor and environment."}
{"text":"Love the name, makes me think if Il Postino, or Positano when looking quickly, both great Italian things.

Followed the rave reviews to here, from Yelp and word of mouth. Expectations may have been off, as we came here for a nice dinner, but this place probably should be treated more as a trendy appetizer or drink spot. Great atmosphere and service, and at one point could picture having a large group together on the large seating area in the back. Not really sure what I'm missing though, the bruschetta was good-not-great, and if you don't feel like a salad or panini for an entree, your options seem limited. For a trendy drinking hole, there could've been a few more than 4 beers on tap. As tasty as Deschutes River Ale is, there are usually more options in most other bars that offer any craft beer. Didn't take a serious look at the wine list this time around. Trying many different kinds of bruschetta in one order was a nice way to taste many things, and appreciate that they were trying interesting ingredients such as the tomato spread, but again, nothing I'll be remembering or craving. Would like to try the butchers block if there's another visit. Didn't try the dessert, as La Grande Orange is right next door, and our loyalties are there for sweets. The outdoor patio looked inviting, and would like to kick it there when its not so Phoenix-y in the middle of summer. Would like to give it another shot some other time, but probably wouldn't wait in line to do so."}
{"text":"This place has the BEST bruschetta in the world! The wines change too which is nice in case you want to try something different the next time you go. This is an inside outside place and great for meeting up with friends or big groups. This is a casual place and the sandwiches and soups and salads are also very good. A lot of time I have gotten the pub board and their dessert of course with chocolate covered corn nuts is amazing as well!"}
{"text":"This remains my favorite place in phoenix! I drive from new river just to go to this location. Best people, service, food, and atmosphere. There is nothing like it."}
{"text":"Very trendy busy hot spot and for good reason. Yummy large chesse board with fruit nuts and bread, chicken noodle soup with real chicken and veggies :)"}
{"text":"Have read a lot of reviews but have never been here prior to tonight. Not sure about the reviews regarding poor service. It's not McDonald's folks...this place is not meant to get you in and out in 45 minutes. If you want your food quick...call it in and get it to take-out. Take your time and enjoy the amazing food, affordable wine, and great space.

I was there with my wife and sister, and we ordered 8 different bruschettas, a sandwich, and a salad. They were all hits...no misses. Our service was quick, friendly, helpful and attentive. Giving us advice like recommending that we buy the bottle instead of three glasses of the same wine cause we get a free glass! Woohoo! :)

Will definitely be going back, and very happy that I finally went!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Location is easy to get to and valet is Perfect! It's free and I didn't mind paying a few bucks for the convenience! The food is great! Came here for a brunch with some girlfriends on a Saturday morning! They were willing to give us a nice comfy couch area for our group of 6-7. We all got mimosas and our server offered to just grab us a bottle since it would be the same price ($5/each). Yum! I had looked up reviews before going and was all about ordering the bruschetta but my friends were feeling the brunch items. Everything looked so tasty! I ordered the prosciutto and Brie panini and chips. Oh my gosh soooo very flavorful!!! It was in the sweet side due to the fig but so many flavor profiles in each bite! I can't wait to come again. I hear they have deals on Monday and Tuesday nights for wine and bruschetta!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere. Really great for date night. Best bruschetta ever! Fig and apples bruschetta is really good and the one with dates is also good. Everything there has great distinct flavor from the next thing. Sandwiches are pretty decent size and really tasty too. Great wine selection. Only thing is that the bruschetta and the sandwiches are so crispy that sometimes the roof of my mouth gets cut, but it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"Danielle and I decided to check this place out after it was highly recommended from one of the guys at the Montelucia pool.  It's a good thing we did since it was pretty awesome!  Cute lil place...very romantic if you were on a date.  The menu is very simple ranging from paninis and salads.  Since Danielle and I wanted the same two paninis from the menu, we decided to get both and split it.  We ordered the mozzarella/basil/pesto panini and the chicken/mozzarella/spicy mayo.  We loved both and the side salad that accompanied the meal was delicious.  I also highly recommend the mimosa with the fresh squeezed orange juice!  It's AMAZING!"}
{"text":"So great to sit on the shaded balcony after hiking Mt Camelback and relax. The tuna panini was incredible. Had to take a pic of the menu so I could try and replicate at home. Great experience all around."}

Wow.... is all I can say. The happy hour(s), $5 wine, is a great deal. The food is superb. I think it's a hoot that it's in the old 'Synthony' location, what was once the coolest pro audio and keyboard shop ever. The ambiance is awesome - cool, urban. cultured. The service and knowledge of the servers is above par. It's usually packed. Definitely one of my favorite places for wine in town! I wish I'd been going for a long time, and didn't just get clued in recently. I'm glad I don't live closer... I'd be there all the time!"}
{"text":"the environment is pretty trendy and all but it feels much more like a bar than a restaurant. the quality of the food isn't that great, more for people on a healthy diet or something.... the sandwiches my friend and I had were too plain..."}
{"text":"Over the last couple of years I have made several visits to Postino, but never for lunch! My visits have always been at night for a glass of wine and a bruchestta, which is clearly what Postino is known for! This time I enjoyed their delicious Bruschetta over lunch with Gabi M. and Lindsey F. I am amazed at how busy this place always is, but not surprised. The service was friendly and timely and that seems to be the standard any time of day.

We started with an order of the bruschetta and we each ordered entree sized salads, which was plenty of food for the 3 of us. The bruschetta is the perfect starter because of the variety and size. I am not sure if they always do this, but they cut each piece into 3 pieces, making it super easy to share and get a taste of each one! We enjoyed the Burrata and Arugula, the Prosciutto Fig & Mascarpone, the Tomato Jam & Sheep's Milk and the Brie & Apple with Fig Spread bruschetta. All of them were heavenly.

I went with the Italian Picnic salad and it was divine! )field greens tossed with roasted beets, goat cheese, bacon and walnuts topped with crisped root vegetables in herb vinaigrette). Lindsey F. ordered the Mediterranean and Gabi M. had the mixed greens. Everything was lovely!

Postino seems to be a Phoenix classic and it definitely going on my list of Phoenix faves. 

I look forward to returning to enjoy their patio over a glass of wine from their fabulous selection and a cheese board."}
{"text":"Great wine/drinks.  Fab food!!  Loved the salads, paninis. Bruschetta!  Ambiance so pleasant.  We'll return."}
{"text":"This is the first time I have been to this place and it was amazing. We had the cheese board and some bruschetta, it was fantastic! The portion sizes were unbelievable, this place feeds you! The staff was nice and friendly and for as busy as it was, the waitress really did her best to check on us and make sure we were ok. Between the glasses of wine and the food me and my friend were so full and happy! We can't wait to come back and try the other items on the menu. This place is a must visit."}
{"text":"My fiance loves this place.  I therefore love it as well, since the majority of my reason for choosing an establishment is to make my fiance happy. anyway, the place is trendy and fun and I would recommend it as a great place for a first date."}
{"text":"I am loving the vibe of Postino! All of the locations have a real chill type setting with chill music in the background. I have now been to this location twice, first time was with a friend during their \"5 before 5\" wine deal, and while that visit was pretty good, one of the servers was obviously uneducated as to all the wines they serve there because I specifically asked if they had Moscato and he said no, but the second time I made a stop here, they most certainly did, and by far the BEST Moscato I have ever tasted if I might add! Also on the first visit, my friend and I had way too many different servers to tell who was our actual server and who we should be tipping, so that was quite odd. 

My second visit here was way more enjoyable I would say, it was on a Monday evening and I was with a bigger party, and on Monday's they have a deal where you can get a bottle and a full bruschetta board for only $20! That is a great deal! Now because of such an awesome deal one should expect the place to be packed like sardines, and in this case it was no different. We all arrived at different times but it was generally around 9:30PM, unfortunately there were no tables available for 6 people even when the first people of my party arrived. So we did have to hover around the bar for a bit. One of my coworkers and I decided to share a bottle and board deal, so we ordered at the bar. About 20-25 minutes later we were finally seated and the rest of my party showed up. Here we are finally seated with our wine and bruschetta boards. My coworker did not want any bruschetta so me having limited food choices, I went with the Almond Hummus and Tomato bruschetta, and I was not disappointed one bit!! I would highly recommend that to my fellow vegan/vegetarians and even someone who just wants to try something different! This time we had only ONE server, so no confusion as to who to tip, and he was very friendly and helpful with any questions we had. All in all, I will definitely make another trip here, whenever I come back to visit Arizona!"}
{"text":"I love me some Postino from time to time! You can never go wrong with anything you order because everything is delicious! My partner and I came for a late dinner and I loved the ambiance. 

I always love the ambiance during the day, but at night - it is so intimate, romantic and dark! Our server was really great and it is always a delight to visit!"}
{"text":"We have friends that are big fans of this restaurant, but my impression was that Postino was Ok. The bruschetta was pretty good, and the salad and wine were just ok. I thought that it had nice ambiance."}
{"text":"When I was here last week, one of the other folks at the table asked me if there were lots of places like this in Ann Arbor, where I live.  Sadly, I had to answer no.  There's nothing quite like this in Ann Arbor, which is too bad. There are some great places here, and even a couple of nice places to sip wine, but the feel of Postino is totally different.

The warm weather enables the front of the cafe to be pretty much totally open (nice garage doors), and though that's not something that would work too well in Michigan in the winter, I have a feeling the the wine selection and food quality offered by Postino would go over famously here in Ann Arbor and elsewhere.  I'm not into big chains, but maybe they'd consider a satellite location?

The bruschetta is a dream -- perfect to share with a group. I especially enjoyed the roasted pepper with goat cheese; brie, apple and fig spread; and the wonderfully salty roasted artichoke heart versions.

And of course, I enjoyed the wine.  In warm weather, I'm a white wine kind of gal, so I sipped a nice glass of Pinot Grigio. I was totally charmed by both the food and the company. Oh, and extra charm points for playing some Otis Redding. The service was just fine -- attentive without being intrusive. If they can't open a Michigan location, then I guess I'll just have to come back the next time I'm around Phoenix."}
{"text":"They have really good deals on Monday and Tuesday. The brushetta is a must try! I love the pear and brie."}
{"text":"The bruschetta is to die for, and brunch is fantastic. Don't forget the delicious mimosas!"}
{"text":"If you want to feel a little posh- then Postino is the place for you and your girlfriends.  I had girls night out there and we had a great time!  We are not heavy wine drinkers but my girlfriends love the dessert wine and the  bruschettas!!! We kept ordering it!!!  I personally like the riesling there.  My girlfriends and I will definitely come back for more bruschetta and I will come back for the riesling and the atmosphere.  This location is a perfect place for a date because it's low lighting giving off that warmth- maybe it's the wine as well...but who cares- you'll have a blast if you have several glass ;)

This location is missing a star because our server that night was very rude.

Oh and if you have cute girlfriends, maybe someone there will buy a bottle for your table ;)"}
{"text":"Get the tomato jam bruschetta it's the best. Followed by salami pesto and the roasted peppers. Such a great spot"}
{"text":"Service was pretty bad. Staff was rude and inattentive. Menu is a small, but good menu. Food , beer, wine etc was excellent."}
{"text":"Great environment, good wine selection, the butchers block is very tasty, and my all time fav here, the prosciutto bruschetta with figs & mascarpone. One of the best prosciutto bruschetta's i've ever had."}
{"text":"I, too enjoy Postinos however I had a recent experience that made me just a tad annoyed with Postinos.

For my recent birthday dinner, I chose Postinos because of all the wonderful things people have written before me.  I love the atmosphere most, and the food is a close second.  Upon calling for a reservation, I was told that a manager would call me back to confirm the reservation.  I thought this was strange, but went along with it.  The manager called me shortly, but told me that she needed my credit card number in order to hold the table.  I have never been asked to do this before, and felt strange about it but did it anyway.

Dinner was great-our waitress was attentive and it was a great experience.  However, about two hours in, the hostess came over and was quite rude to us about how reservations have a two hour cap on them.  I was a bit confused by this, as we were a party of ten and I was never told this very strange stipulation when the manager was taking down my credit card number.  It didn't sit well with me because the hostess was pretty rude to us, and it has left a bad taste in my mouth.  Just something to keep in mind when making reservations there."}
{"text":"If you are ever in PHX, go here.  An old friend of mine owns this place.  Food is awesome and the staff rules!  (Tom T. ;))  The wine selection will melt your soul and the atmosphere is killer.  Have fun."}
{"text":"A colleague and I went there for lunch. We had salads and loved it. It was perfectly dressed and very flavorful. The service was prompt. They have a nice patio seating which is wonderful on a beautiful sunny day. Would definitely go back there."}
{"text":"I went to the new Postino in Gilbert this weekend and was so impressed I stopped in the Arcadia location since I was in the neighborhood.

Blown away once again...

I was actually reluctant bringing my 2 and 4 year old to a hipster wine bar but when we arrived, we were greeted warmly and they were very nice and welcoming to my kids. So I was immediately put at ease.

They have an awesome kids menu with food kids will eat but upscale - PB and J bruschetta or grilled cheese, both accompanied with grapes, apple slices and chips AND a cute little bendy toy - nailed it! There was a 3rd option but it escapes me at the moment. 

I ordered the same thing I had on sunday - white wine blend and bruschetta, soooo good! I crave it.

I have to say, the customer service is superb. I actually was able to have a relaxing lunch with a wiggly 2 and 4 year old. Fantastic!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just left the Arcadia location and by far had the worst service we've ever experienced. When our server finally came over we ordered a butcher's block to start, a bruschetta board, and a panini. She said she was going to course it out for us which is exactly what we wanted! Our appetizer took longer than usual but it was still great. Our server had not checked on us once. The last time we saw her was when she had taken our order and at this point we had already been there for an hour. A table that was sat maybe 20-25 minutes after us had already gotten their food and we still hadn't received ours. We called someone over to see what was going on and to just grab our check because it was honestly ridiculous that we still didn't have anything. He said he would check and grab it for us. When he came back he just put down our check and left. Since he didn't update us at all, we decided to just pay and leave. Finally, our server came over and picked up our check but she was confused when it only had our appetizer on it. I told her we were frustrated because we've been waiting 40 minutes for our food. I'm not sure if she just forgot to put it in after doing the entree or what. I get that things happen, because I'm a server as well. It was crazy that no one had even said anything or a manager didn't even come over to apologize. After she ran my card she came back with our food boxed up and apologized. But at that point we didn't even want to eat there anymore because it took so long. I'll be sticking to the Tempe location since I never have issues there. Just sad that this was my boyfriends first time at the restaurant in general and it was such a bad experience!"}
{"text":"Fig Jam and Brie Sandwich on Prussiutto , it doesn't get better!"}
{"text":"I always love eating at Postino! The bruschetta boards are great, but don't forget about this place for brunch! Enjoy $5 bubbles and great breakfast food. The walnut toast is wonderful. Thanks Postino for great food and a fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I love, love, love this place. The hand-selected wines are unique and very special. The bruschettas are amazing, and the service is amazing. The staff is very knowledgeable about the wines and food ... I never ask a question they can't answer! The atmosphere is chill and classy, without being stuffy. My first time was for a bridal shower ... the staff managed it fantastically, always quick in bringing more food and drink and never, ever seeming overwhelmed. Whether you're a party of 2 or 20 try Postino ... you're gonna like it."}
{"text":"Once an old post office, this cozy little wine cafe brings a rare beauty to bruschetta.  New visitors to this establishment, I have only two suggestions:
Skip the paninis, and opt straight for the bruschetta.
Do not hesitate to order the \"proscuitto with mascarpone and figs\"
What I love about the menu is that one can order up to 4 selections of the bruschetta for $12.75.  This is a very filling choice, but with groups of four you can extend up to 8.
I cannot do these delectable eats any justice if I don't give them a name.
Recommendations below are my tops, my do or dies:

fresh mozzarella with tomato and basil
smoked salmon
prosciutto with figs and mascarpone
brie and apples with fig spread

the flavors are bold and fresh, even the flavor combinations seem daring on some.

soups and salads are available here, as well as paninis.I am not a fan of paninis, but the prosciutto with brie was very well done.

Best night to come:
Tuesday after 8p  ($20 tuesday, where you can enjoy a bottle of wine and bruschetta for only $20)

Happy Hour:
Not exactly, but wines by the glass are $5, seven days a week, from 11-5

Dessert menu:
Tammy Coe Cakes is next door, so you can sample a selection of her decadent cookies and cakes. Postino also has my favorite, the creme brulee.

The Wine Program:
it changes seasonally, which makes coming here again and again a happy surprise.  French, Australian, Chilean, South African, diversity is well represented here in everything from tempranillo to nero d'avola."}
{"text":"What a great place with awesome service! Good was fresh, bruschetta was amazing! Perfect place!!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I took her mother to dinner at Postino last night and the service was stellar!  The closing server (Amanda?) went above and beyond and really made our experience wonderful!  Thank you for the wonderful hospitality!"}
{"text":"You've got to go there for Saturday lunch. All glasses of wine are only $5. Their bruschetta is phenomenal. I recommend getting the pub board and asking for soft pretzels instead of the bread. The pretzels are freshly made and out of this world."}
{"text":"Would consider it my favorite wine bar in Arizona so far. The board (4 different types of bruschetta) were pheonomal. The rose wine was a perfect choice recommends by the server. Ordered the turkey pesto panini and extremely pleased. Salad was delicious with the order... And the olive plate was good.  Parking is about 3 bucks. Bathrooms were very clean. Many different options of wine and alot of them tasted amazing. Good service, food is out very fast and servers are very much on top of the game. For dessert we got the Creme Brulee which was great. Will for sure be back here again."}
{"text":"I have 231 reviews so far and none for one of my all time favorite AZ restaurants? I have to rectify that now. If you love wine and bruschetta than this will be your own version of Heaven. Blasphemy? Then you've never been to Postino! Seriously, they have the best bruschetta you're likely to ever have in your entire life. My top four: 

1) Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone
2) Brie & Apples with Fig Spread
3) Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese
4) Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomatoes

Also worthy of mention are the amazing sandwiches. I highly recommend the Autostrada (Sopresatta, Italian ham, cappicola, mortadella, provolone, arugula and tomatoes with spicy pepper relish) and the Nine Iron (Hickory smoked bacon layered with grilled chicken, fresh burrata mozzarella, lettuce, beefsteak tomato and dijonnaise). Fucking awesome.

As you'll read in most of the other reviews, Postino has a great Monday and Tuesday night special, a bottle of wine and a bruschetta board for only $20. But be warned, it'll be jam packed. Keep in mind they have two other locations as well. For you east valley residents there is a new Gilbert loction. If you are in downtown Phoenix or west valley, then the Central Avenue location a couple blocks north of Camelback will be more convenient.

With its outstanding food, decor, and ambiance, I'm going to give you a Paul V. guarantee that you will love Postino."}
{"text":"Everything was Amazing, I'm in LOVE Hard! 

Shared a Cheese Course and a Bruschetta Plank. 
My choice was the Brie & Apples with Fig Spread and Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone (see pics) 

Absolutely Heavenly! The Cheese, the Bread, OMG, words don't do it justice , just go!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. 

Came here with JTW on July 4th for an afternoon snack. (Yes I know I am writing this review late) I had heard so much about it from friends that visited Phoenix and just from reading reviews of it on Yelp! When I saw that every day they had HH from 11AM until 5pm for $5 glasses of wine and $5 pitchers, I knew this was going to be at the top of my list for Phoenix and it did not disappoint. JTW and I split a BRUSCHETTA board as an afternoon snack and there was plenty for the both of us. We also got a couple of glasses of delicious wine each, which our waiter was extremely helpful with. He helped us narrow down our choices and even gave us samples of them before we finalized our decision. It was really hot and humid the day we were there so we sat indoors, but once the weather cools off, I definitely want to sit outside on their patio. They have few tall bar stool/tables, some tables in the center of the room, and couches to lounge on in one corner of the room. 

Definitely a cute date spot or a girls night out type of place. 

HH: 11AM til 5PM every day. $5 glasses of wine and $5 pitchers of beer
Monday and Tuesdays: 8PM to close. $20 for a bottle of wine and bruschetta board. (DEFINITELY coming back for that one)"}
{"text":"This place is a very chill wine bar. Came here after flying in for work and wanted something that would be light, have a good wine selection, and a nice outdoor patio/bar area. Daily Dose fulfills each of those items. 

You MUST get the bruchetta plate. My favorite was the smoked salmon, pesto, and capers and the prosciutto and fig. 4 slices of bruschetta for a single person was too much, but you shouldn't hesitate in bringing along friends. 

I also tried the raspberry chicken salad. Sadly, I was looking for more greens than the chicken pieces. It was still super delicious.

I ended with an affogato. You can never go wrong with this choice and Postino didn't disappoint me!"}
{"text":"Its a nice place. Go on week days for discount on drinks. They have got really good collection of wine . i love the decor and outdoor seating with candles on every table."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm..... still enjoying my Reisling Buzz, this place was great.

Went here with a group of seven, had a lot of fun.  This place would be a great date place, nice atmosphere.    Bruschetta was amazing, the one with fig, ricotta, and pistacios was my favorite.  The sampler was a great way to try a bunch.  Tuna sandwich was also excellent along with the salad.  

I'm in Arizona for another couple weeks, I hope to make it back!"}
{"text":"oh postino, i dream about your bruschetta. 

this little wine bar is one of the best (if not the best) in the valley-and i love that's it's only a mile from where i live! although they're open late, i really think of postino as more of a lunch/happy hour spot.  this is a salad/sandwich/bruschetta place, and to me that just doesn't say dinner.  

regardless! it's awesome and they have great wine deals-from 11-5pm all wine by the glass and pitchers of beer are $5, bottles are $9 off if you get it to go, and on monday and tuesdays you can get a bottle of wine and bruschetta for $20! 

anyways, on to the amazing bruschetta. you get your choice of four different toppings (2 pieces per topping-great for sharing!) and they are all so so good! my favorites are the ricotta with dates and pistachios, prosciutto with figs and mascarpone, and the smoked salmon with pesto.  but you can't go wrong with any of them, they're all that good and there's something for everyone's tastes.  

parking is sort of a hassle-so just save yourself the trouble and valet. also, it can get pretty loud during lunch time, so be aware of that if you're trying to have a quiet time. 

either way, if you haven't been-go! you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Perfect place to go hang out with a date or a group of friends. Been to both Arcadia and Postinos on Central. Brushetta is amazing and wine selection will not disappoint. Staff has been friendly at both locations as well.  Arcadia parking is a nightmare and Postinos on Central is bad but not horrible. Pricey unless you go during happy hour."}
{"text":"This place is described as casual Italian, but the menu has no pasta or pizza choices. If all you want is bruschetta or panini then this pace is for you. The restaurant has a very nice patio and our server, Samantha, was very attentive. This place needs more choices on its menu."}
{"text":"Postinos  is great on so many levels!  They offer $5 glasses of wine from 11am to 4pm daily, AMAZING! Their  bruschetta is delicious and huge, you get a choice of three toppings. My personal favorite is the pistachio ricotta cheese, SO Good! The open space the restaurant is in also makes for great people watching.  When your dining at Postinos with friends or a loved one, life doesn't get much better than this!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been there twice within the past 2 years, the second time to see if they could redeem themselves after our horrible first visit.
Service ~ fair: our host never established eye contact and it felt as though we were being seated at a buffet. Our server - although very nice, was inept. Appetizers took 30 min to arrive, then she asked if it would be okay the serve our main courses at the same time. We said no and continued. We finished our appetizers and about 20 min. later the server made to back to our table. Our main course meals were horrible both overcooked overcooked, reheated or whatever, not edible. We spoke with the manager, returned the food, paid and left. The bill would have been $100.+ for very substandard food but the manager did credit us for the bad food. Our server never offered to refill our drinks (beer and mixed drink) pure profit for the biz. We left once again disappointed with service and food.
The thing is my wife wants to give it a (perhaps final) try again today (about 3 months from the last visit. I will report back"}
{"text":"I was a bit skeptical of Postino because I had heard so many great things about it and didn't really understand how bruschetta could be that great, but now I'm a believer. It's the whole package of the location, the vibe, the constant crowd, and of course - the amazing food! I ordered a board of bruschetta, planning to split it with my friend, but then remembered she is unable to have gluten! It was so delicious that I finished the whole board by myself! I just couldn't say no to the brie, apple & fig, or red peppers & goat cheese, or prosciutto, fig & marscapone, or the burrata, bacon, arugula, & tomatoes. My fave of these four was the brie, apple & fig. Deeee-lish!"}
{"text":"I actually went to Postino and drank beer. I know, what was I thinking right? But they had a pumpkin ale on tap and I'd been drinking a lot of wine lately so we went for it. 

The one thing I have to say about Postino is that the bruschetta is a must have. Most places give you a little piece or two for each of your selections, Postino gives you a whole large slice of bread for each choice that's sliced into four good size pieces. It was way more than we expected and both my date and I felt a little full going into the main course just from that.

Speaking of the main course, I had a panini type sandwhich with chicken, tomato and mozzarella that I really enjoyed. 

The atmosphere and service is perfect for a date. Quite enough to talk, you get enough attention but not so much that it interrupts your night and the lighting, outdoor seating and ambiance is just right.

Oh and that beer? Loved it too."}
{"text":"I've been to postino central but it was my first time trying postino arcadia, i like the decor better at arcadia than at central.  The food tasted great, . very yummy and great place to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"I was torn between this place and LGO but was at LGO for breakfast.  Pretty happy I picked Postino for lunch.  Sandwich selection was unique (Prosciutto with Brie) and the general ambiance during lunch was real nice."}
{"text":"AMAZING! they have a salad and sandwich combo for only $10!  and you can choose from any of their salads and sandwiches! I usually go with the chicken salad and the vegetarian sandwich.  I am absolutely in love and addicted to this place.  Only thing is that parking is limited and you have to usually use valet"}
{"text":"I've only been here once since I'm from out of town and I was craving brunch so I went on Yelp and found this place. I am so glad I did! The place was very nice, super trendy. Great customer service, and great food. I ordered the B.E.L.T. and it was to die for. My breakfast Panini was huge so I had to take a half to go. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I just left literally 90 seconds ago. I came to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday with 4 other women. We ordered every cheese board they offer as well as a bottle of wine (the only reason we didn't order dessert is because they wouldn't offer it)
I feel it's important to post this review immediately because I want the restaurant to understand why we will never return- upon leaving, we heard/saw the manager saying \"oh good, that table is finally f***ing leaving\".  Really? We had sat at this table for 2 hours however, eating, drinking, and tipping well. At first we were offended, but upon reflecting, we're outraged and will not recommend anyone waste their time there, especially while surrounded by lots of other great date night choices. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Im speechless. Simply, speechless. This place is AMAZING. I had pretty high expectations of this place and I was still blown away by the level of excellence this place carries. My amore and I decided to give this place a whirl on a Friday night, and we enjoyed every second of our experience. Upon arrival, we were told that there was an hour and a half wait, so we ventured into the bar area to have a glass of Prosecco, which was DELICIOUS by the way. About thirty minutes later, we were seated and looking over the menu. The wait was cut in half! I would have waited 6 hours for their bruschetta, though. We sampled four of their bruschetta selections, and not one piece was left behind. Their portions are large, and definately made for sharing. We topped off our scrumptious experience with an espresso and a salted caramel sundae. Im pretty sure my tastebuds are still dancing around.....As far as the service goes, it needs help. Our server was horrible. He refilled our water glasses ONCE and relied on other staff members to bring us our check. At the beginning of our visit, we were greeted by the owner, and he personally brought us a wine list, took our drink order, AND opened our vino, table side. That is so refreshing to see when the owner of a place puts his own elbow grease into maintaining his business. This place has an amazing, simple menu. Its an ideal place to take a date!!"}
{"text":"The wine list is diverse and \"user-friendly.\"  To date, I have had many good experiences here.  I love the lounge area and to sit outside and people watch.  The bar is also a great place to plop down and enjoy wine and a great dish.  I really love the bruschetta and recently had the NYC grilled cheese with pesto.  

Great place for a first date."}
{"text":"What else is there to say?  This place is amazing.  

Great wine.  Yummy food.  Excellent staff.  Beautiful neighborhood.  Funky/chic interior.  I love the garage door indoor/outdoor seating. 

I could waste my entire paycheck here.  Better yet; I can move in and just sleep on the comfy lounge furniture."}
{"text":"Prosciutto and fig with mascarpone bruschetta...to die for."}
{"text":"I came here a couple times when I had a client in the area and I wish I had a chance to go more! We tried to go once during their happy hour one night and it was packed with a super long wait so we ended up not being able to stay. You could tell it was definitely the place to be. The bruschetta board was awesome and their salads are great too. The service was great, and they really want you to have the right wine that suits your tastes. You can even taste a little of the wine before you make a decision to choose one. I've been collecting wine corks for art projects and they gave me a whole wine bag full of them that I could take home with me. That was pretty awesome. I am definitely coming back to this place the next time I'm in Phoenix and definitely recommending it to my friends who visit Phoenix too!"}
{"text":"What a great place for focaccia bread. Yummy. Love the pesto sauce. I don't always like paying $12-14 for a glass of delectable red wine but sometimes it seems so worth it to blow a few twenties among friends. Its a great place to relax. Great ambience"}
{"text":"After a long day of rock-climbing, we were looking for a place to sip some wine and order a few hors d'oeuvres. According to Yelp, Postino's seemed like a suitable choice.

It didn't take long before we were raving about our choice. Postino's nailed everything. The setting was casual yet sophisticated with outdoor seating heated via lamp. The wine (or mimosa for me) were delicious. The main sell is their bruschetta. For $14, you can choose four different set of toppings out of a list of eight or so. Each one is spectacular from the prosciutto & mascarpone to the salmon and pesto. The butcher block is an equally tantalizing option--quite possibly the best goat cheese around. Finally, if you aren't convinced yet, the happy hour specials are more than a mere $1 wells. Stop by, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"One word: Bruschetta. 

Obviously it's what they're known for, I always get the Apple & Brie, Tomato Mozzarella & Basil and then I change up the rest! They offer a seasonal which is always really delish! I like that the bread is rock hard, and everything is always fresh! This is one of my favorite meals, yes I said meals! I can eat an entire platter by myself! My mom LOVES the spicy jam and goat cheese! 

They also have really great drinks, and I personally like their honey cucumber lemonade!"}
{"text":"Ok I think this winecafe is highly overrated!!
When you have a tiny menu you should do what you have amazingly!! But my sandwich lacked prosciutto. I didn't find the chips to be amazing either. Overall I felt pretty let down. And I can think of at least 2 places that bruschetta is done better in the valley."}
{"text":"Excellent food and friendly service.  Excellent value and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Postino is just plain awesome. We came in to great live music and a very busy restaurant and we were seated after a bit of waiting. The service is great even before you are eating. The waitresses and waiters are always very attentive and make sure that you are comfortable and satisfied. Because of the wait, our waitress brought us four varieties of bruschetta paid for by the restaurant! After we ordered we got our hot and delicious panini that were flavorful and perfectly portioned. The service continued to be great just like it should be with a private-owned business. If it were possible, I'd give 6 stars!!!! SO awesome!:)"}
{"text":"You just can't go wrong with this place!! 20$ bottle of wine and board of bruschetta Monday &Tuesday."}
{"text":"Amazing food from the starters to the sandwiches , and from the wine to the coffee ! Came back here twice in one day because it was so phenomenal ! Excellent staff , beautiful decor!"}
{"text":"Had a good experience. We stopped in for a late lunch. We got 4 bruschetta's for the two of us and it was plenty to hold us over. Very trendy atmosphere and good service!"}
{"text":"This is the original Postino, named because the building actually used to be an old post office.  I've actually been to all 3 locations now many times, and they're all great, and all have a huge wait Friday and Saturday night so be prepared for that.  The food is fantastic, the pub board, bruschetta, and paninis are all great.  Drinks are good as well, I'm just not a huge wine drinker.  If you want it to not be completely packed come in on a week night or in the afternoon."}
{"text":"Love this place!! great ambiance, $5 glasses of wine til five. Bruchettas are amazing, salads as well. The service staff ( Miles & Josh) are awesome! Very friendly and helpful. A ++"}
{"text":"DEEEEEELISH!

Went to Postino with co-workers for lunch today. It's the perfect place for a Friday lunch, especially when the weather is nice. We sat inside but they had the \"wall\" open so it's was kinda indoor/outdoor which added to the nice atmosphere of the place.

They had $5 drinks so we all indulged (it was Friday after all). I had a mimosa that was made with freshly squeezed orange juice. Very tasty.
For lunch I ordered a half prosciutto and brie sandwich and half mixed greens salad. Both were delicious.
The sandwich came on ciabatta bread that was nice and fresh. It included several slices of prosciutto, a nice thick slice of brie, arugula and fig spread. At it was served toasted. The fig gave a nice sweet compliment to the salty prosciutto and the brie gave it a nice warm gooeyness.
The salad was mixed greens with grapes, pear, and candied walnuts with a light vinaigrette dressing. I love fruity salads and this one did not disappoint. Everything was very fresh and the dressing was flavorful.

They also offer a good variety of bruschetta so it would make a great place for happy hour if you just wanted a drink and a little bite to snack on.

One minus - parking sucks. We did the valet, which is free but you know you gotta tip so it's not really free."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, with two totally different experiences. 

One time it was for a happy hour, it was pretty chill, like 6pm on a Wednesday. There were 4 or 6 of us, it was relaxing and we were able to eat some yummy bruchetta and chat and drink some wine in a cute little stylish place.

Then I thought it would be fun to have my little birthday soire there. So I scheduled a party of 15-20 for a Thursday around 8pm. They reserved me the little area just to the right of the entrance. It happened to be really, really busy that night, but, they managed to keep drinks in everyones hands. So although a little chaotic, it was a fun night.

Warning: good luck parking."}
{"text":"Delicioso!  The bruschetta is a good starter - the bread toasted perfectly and not too thick.  We had the white tuscan bean with pancetta, roasted pepper with goat cheese, Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone, and Warm Artichoke Spread (you pick 4 to an order).  The prosciutto and artichoke were our definite faves.  The roast beef sandwich was good, but my Chicken & Mozzarella (on focaccia) and Raspberry Chicken Salad was SO good."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere, the staff, and the food.  My go-to for a girls' night out or a laid-back date."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. The atmosphere is relaxed. The patio is wonderful on a beautiful day and shaded so not uncomfortable on a 90 degree day like today. $5 wine until 5pm and the selection is magnificent. The bruschetta is just as good as everyone says it is. I had apple & brie, ricotta dates and pistachio, goat cheese and red pepper and artichoke spread on gluten free bread.($16)Totally worth it. It's off the beaten path if you're not a local and totally worth visiting."}
{"text":"The bruschetta and pub boards are to die for, and we look forward to the $20 wine & bruschetta deals on Mondays and Tuesdays every week! Get here a bit early on those days though, as everyone likes this great deal."}
{"text":"I took my husband to Postinos today after a really enjoyable trip a couple of weeks ago. The happy hour is super and seven days aweek. $5 wine and thats any wine they serve not just the house wine. The food is amazing too. The brushetta plate and the butchers block are a great addition to the wine. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"If you enjoy wine-bars and you don't fall in love with Postino, you're crazy!

The first time I walked into Postino, I felt like I'd stepped into a different world. Having lived in NYC for a while, I became a bit spoiled and was pleasantly surprised to find Postino comparable to places I loved out there! 

Nighttime is the best time to go as it's dim, loud and full of energy. Postino is one of my favorite places to go for a light dinner and drinks with good friends year-round; however, on a fall or spring night, when they have all the doors and windows open onto the patio, it's perfection.

As many have mentioned, the bruschetta is great. It's a good option for an appetizer or sharing for a main dish, especially if you'd rather focus on filling up with wine than food. ;) The grilled cheese appetizer is tasty, but a pretty small portion. If you're looking for a small compliment to wine, they've got a \"cheese course\" and a meat and cheese \"plate\". The cheese course comes with 3 different cheeses that they switch up frequently. It's a pretty decently sized dish, but the last time I ordered it, the \"fruit\" they mentioned on the menu was basically just dried apricots, cranberries and nuts. It wasn't bad, but with the crunchy bread it came with, there were too many dry things on one plate for my liking! If you like olives, I'd recommend splurging on the $5 olive bowl. It's a generous portion of mixed olives that will not disappoint. 

My all-time favorite item at Postino is the \"Prosciutto with Brie\" Panini, on Ciabatta bread, with salad. The sandwich is soft prosciutto layered with brie, arugula and figs, drizzled with a little balsamic and olive oil and served on a super crunchy ciabatta roll. If this was the only item on the menu, I'd still make the 15 mile drive to order it. The sandwich is big enough to share, but I love it enough to eat the whole thing and suffer the consequences later. :) All of the paninis come with potato chips or salad. Rarely would I choose salad as a side, but I actually look forward to this salad almost as much as the sandwich. It's romaine lettuce, pine nuts, crumbled feta and a very light oil dressing (from what I can gather). 

The two negatives, which is what drops it from 5 stars to 4 are the following: The service is often lacking. There are some really nice, attentive servers and there are some rather pretentious servers (which isn't unheard of at a wine-bar). It's really hit or miss, but I take it with a grain of salt and don't let it deter me from going. After all, a pretentious server can become great material for dinner-time laughs. 

The second negative is the parking situation. This is an issue with any of the many LA Grande Orange establishments located on that corner. Pretty much any time you go there, you will have trouble finding parking. They do offer valet, but call me cheap, I'd rather not HAVE to pay for valet. 

To make a long story short (I know, too late), go to Postino if you're looking for an experience you're unlikely to find anywhere else in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Lunch was excellent but the music was too loud!  We requested three times the volume be reduced but it was not.  I will never suggest the Postino for a group that wants to visit."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times, and the only reason i come back is because of the food. they are always busy, which, hey, that's good for them. not a big deal. not a big deal that is, until my last visit. I had raved about it to a friend and we decided to go for lunch on a Saturday with the knowledge that it would be packed and we would have a wait before sitting down, and we were okay with that since we kept busy by walking through La Grande Orange. 

Finally, we sit down, in a \"quieter\" part of the restaurant, near a small table on upholstered chairs. Sidenote: I'm a germophobe so it drove me crazy how much those chairs needed to be cleaned. But anyways... We order our food from a different server than our first one because she never came back after drinks. We got our food in a timely fashion, ate hungrily and it was totally worth the wait. As we walked in, we saw two ladies order dessert and both my friend and i decided it was necessary we try their salted caramel sundae. So when we finished our salads and panini's, we waited. and waited. and waited. no one checked up on us. which is okay, i guess. but that place isn't that big, even for three or four servers tops, so being busy isn't an excuse for me (I work in a restaurant, so i'm very sympathetic to servers, but some things just don't make sense to me). finally, our second server comes back..... with the check. and she left again before we could explain we wanted dessert and separate checks. it took at least ten minutes to flag her down again and she seemed a bit salty after that. In hindsight, I shouldn't have tipped as well as i did. It was more for pity than for being appreciative of her service.

So despite the disappointing service, the food is still superb. and that sundae? Never had a better one, even at the Sugar Bowl."}
{"text":"Eclectic, artsy, wine and cheese.

Not much to say, if you can find a spot to park...

You need to try.

Bruschetta is world famous!
The home brew iced tea is wonderful!

Live music this Sunday, perfect Arizona weather, good company.

Just a great eating experience!"}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place.  Great location, right down the street from a friends house so we never have to deal with parking issues.  Everyone who works there is really sweet and one of the older bartenders is great to talk with.  I used to stop by so often the bartender would take a few glasses of wine off the bill.  Whenever people come in from out of town I have to take them here.  They have the best bruschetta!  I have tried to recreate some of them at home and while they have been good, they are no match for Postino.  It is a great place for a relaxing lunch, romantic dinner, or night out with the girls!"}
{"text":"I really love everything about this spot.  If I lived in Scottsdale, I would be here everyday for happy hour.

The atmosphere is wonderful, like a generous patio at someone's home. It feels tucked away, although you are really off a pretty busy street.  There is also plenty of room inside when the heat is too much.  The service is attentive and the food is fresh and vibrant.  

This is also a great place to just get drinks...."}
{"text":"good ambience and good food. the bruschetta veggie plate we ordered was really good. will visit this place again"}
{"text":"Yummy food and wine at Postino. I recently ate brunch at Postino Arcadia as part of a group event. This Postino location is nestled in a neighborhood. Depending on the day and time of visit, self parking can be limited but they also have valet. Our group was seated in the couch area. I arrived later than my group but was quickly brought water and asked about a drink order. Our server was attentive and promptly took our group's food order and checked in on how our food was. I am a fan of their bruschetta but on other occasions and at other locations have had their sandwiches and salads. Brunch at Postino is fun!"}
{"text":"I've now been to three different Postino locations and I love them all. I have had bruschetta at each and try to make sure I always include the monthly special. The last trip was with my mom so we did the gluten free bruschetta and even it was great. Also, each location is really nicely decorated and fun."}
{"text":"Oh Postino...how I love you.
There's really nothing that needs to be said other than GO THERE!
I've been nearly a dozen times now and I've literally never been let down.  

I like to sit at the bar when I can, Sander is such a great bartender and always gets us everything we need before we have to ask.  We even mentioned we were waiting for a spot at the bar (it was a busy friday night) and he was nice enough to come get us when 2 people left.

We usually get the bruscetta, especially when they're on special (mon and tues), but if you want to branch out, try the pub board, or the butcher block.  Both are perfect for finger food while enjoying your wine and your company.

This is always where I go for special occasions or when I have out of town guests.  This place is definitely 5 stars."}
{"text":"You could sit down and watch all three Lord of the Rings movies in the time it takes to make it to the valet stand, but your patience will pay off.  Postino has a great selection of wine and the epic bruschetta menu is fitting of the parking experience-- long, complicated, and worth the wait.  I deducted a star because I find that the selection of other food lacks variety.  For example, they offer many salads that are terribly similar.  Yes, I know there are only so many variations on a salad but these just all blend together and become forgettable.  If you're going for wine and cheese and bruschetta, you won't be disappointed.  My precious!"}
{"text":"Postino is great on Monday and Tuesday nights.  It's half price bottles of wine and bruschetta night.  It's definitely a girls night though.  Keep that in mind if you're going to go on Monday or Tuesday."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the intimate atmosphere, dim lighting, and yummy bruschetta. It was a perfect spot for my birthday dinner last year, cool & romantic."}
{"text":"The tuna sandwich and the bruschetta were fantastic. The cucumber lemonade was unreal."}
{"text":"Be here on Monday and Tuesday nights, the best special in Phoenix from this well known wine bar. $20 will get you one of many good bottles of wine, along with your choice of 4 of the tasty house bruschetta's. The apple, fig and Brie bruschetta is awesome! The service is attentive and fun, and it's a very enjoyable environment. It gets crowded, the special starts at 8 pm"}
{"text":"Amazing Food and Atmosphere! Great for Couples. Sharing food is welcome and trendy here."}
{"text":"This place surpassed all expectations! The food was delicious, music was banging, and the atmosphere is perfect to relax and enjoy life with friends. The tiny downside is the limited parking, but do offer valet or you can try your luck for a bit to find parking around the area. It's worth it!"}
{"text":"I have eaten..

EVERY.
SINGLE.
BRUSCHETTA.
FLAVOR.

I plan to be buried with them. They are that good.

When i'm rich and famous one day, I will dine on nothing but Postino's bruschetta until I balloon and can no longer fit through my door and need to escape through the bay window to satiate my bruschetta needs.

That tasty."}
{"text":"This restaurant is worth the wait in case you stumble upon a busy night. The atmosphere is cozy and the food is delicious. I highly recommend the bruschetta."}
{"text":"I could eat here almost every day.  During the day it is chill and relaxing.  At night its trendy and busy.  The service can be spotty, but the food and wine are worth it.  You can't go wrong with the bruscetta.  All of the choices are amazing.  Its a great place to go with friends."}
{"text":"BAAAAAAAAAAAAZING!!!!  Want something to do on a Monday-Tuesday evening, come here for $20 bucks and you'll snag a bottle of Vino and some delish bruschetta.  The atmosphere is open and Euro feeling with the open wine market and back of restaurant bar.  Seating can be an issue so be flexible when trying to find standing or sitting room.  The food is good and the service is spot on.  Definitely my choice for chillaxin on an off night with friends or even a date."}
{"text":"Postino is one of my favorite places around. It is such a cute little place in an old post office that opens up so there is an inside area and also a patio area but the inside area is breezy and still sort of outdoors. Their bruschetta is soooo good! My favorites are the apple & brie and also the roasted peppers with goat cheese. Their sandwiches, salads and soups are all really good as well. I never leave here feeling grossly full or guilty about what I ate, everything is fresh and the portions are good. There is tons of different wine and they are very informative and thorough if you ask about the wine selections! Well priced, great place to meet up with friends or go on a date. I've never had a bad experience here--service, food, wine, all good.Cute location too. I would suggest doing the Valet parking because spaces to park are extremely limited. There is a small parking lot across the street but it fills up fast. Also, if you sign up to be on their email list, you get a coupon for a free plank of bruschetta!!"}
{"text":"Postino is my go to everything! Girl time, Postino! Hang out, Postino! Quick bite to eat, Postino!! I love the wine list, and the food! They pair so well with everything. It's so hard to pick what wine you want or food, believe me I always take about 10-15 minutes to decide what I want. Why does it take so long you ask?? WELL because everything is so great that you can't just pick one thing. I highly recommended paring their board with your wine, when you can pick 4 different things you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Pros: great happy hour, FANTASTIC bruschetta selection (they all are amazing), their salted caramel sundae = to die for, and their wine selection is great. 

Cons: wait times can be long (mainly during peak hours and happy hour) and some of their entrees are little underwhelming (however, not expensive)."}
{"text":"I'd been to Postinos a couple times, but once I took my parents there, it's the only place they ever want to go! As big wine folks, they know that after the hour and a half drive from Tucson, they just want to relax and have a glass of wine and some bruschetta.

While there isn't a HUGE menu to select from, the bruschetta, soups, salads and paninis are perfectly portioned, amazingly tasty and refreshing, no matter what time of year. Their unique selection of bruschetta includes apple and brie with fig spread, proscuitto with figs and mascarpone and salami with pesto (plus a few others). And their wine list makes up for it. They have an extensive selection that they change out regularly, and you can buy a bottle on your way out to enjoy at home.  My favorite that I discovered at Postinos is the Hey Mambo.

Tucked away in a charming neighborhood in Phoenix, Postinos is a great place to enjoy some wine and bruschetta. They usually do have the garage door open, so you get the fresh outdoors no matter where you sit. When the weather is perfect out, the outdoor seating is great too.

Although 90% of the time you have to valet park due to limited parking, it is only $3 and very convenient. It is probably one of the only places I don't mind valet parking at in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Having lived at the Central Postinos last year, which was my home away from home, I ventured East hoping for the same experience. Well, while it was okay, I will not say it met my expectations and I will tell you why. Big plus\" Live music. Another big plus: Expanded beer selection including domestic beers in bottles. The food just was not up to par with Central. The Cranberry Walnut Chicken Salad, our old fave, lacked Gorgonzola and had WAY too much celery. too little chicken and too may herbs. The apples in it were the size of a gold ball (OK, I am exaggerating, but not much). It lacked finesse. I know the weekend chef may have been new, not skilled, whatever but come on, this is a nice place. We had a Panini which also lagged far behind the Central location. Lacked flavor and the pepper spread was not as spicy. The salad we ordered had almost no dressing on it, which I know is an easy fix, but COME ON this is not a young place...upscale crowd and décor. Great wait staff. They were not the problem. The beer was not the problem. But they should take their kitchen staff over to Postino Central for some training."}
{"text":"All Postinos are usually too crowded and too hipster for me. If you enjoy lots of talk, bustling, and crowds during dinner you will be entirely pleased. The food and drink is pricey but great! Parking is tight but valet is onsite."}
{"text":"This place gets 5 stars for a couple of reasons. 
1. The prosciutto and brie, apples and fig spread, warm artichoke spread, and the baratta and bacon brisket are amazing. those are the ones i will always order. 
2. For 20 bucks you can get this Delicious food AND a bottle of some of the best pinot noir (which usually costs 11 bucks a glass!!!) 
3. Its the perfect place for a date, and a cheap one at that, on mondays and tuesdays. or a girls night out. 


the only complaint is the wait on mondays and tuesdays. the hostess told us it was an 80 minute wait. it only ended up being 40....wtf. haha"}
{"text":"1 star is taken away due to the parking situation .  The food and atmosphere are good.  I've been here for brunch on the weekend when the doors are open and they have live music.  It's a good time.  It's a great place to grab a glass of wine and some bruchetta and hang out with a group of people."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place. Always wonderful service, not to mention the atmosphere and location. I've had mostly just drinks, here, but the last time I went, I had the Italian Picnic salad. I NEVER order salads at restaurants, but I think I'll have to order this again next time I'm there. It was to die for. I was very pleasantly surprised. Overall, always a great experience!"}
{"text":"Went on a Tuesday night for their wine and bruschetta special. There outdoorsy and dim lighting atmosphere makes the place very calm and relaxing place to dine. Love their bruschetta! I recommend for anyone who haven't been here."}
{"text":"First time here. Having a great brunch. Extremely attentive and knowledgeable staff. $5 mimosas. How can you go wrong?"}
{"text":"went here to celebrate an interview my wife went to.

Had wine. Thats about it. Love going to sit and relax and have a glass of wine (or beer). 

They try and keep their atmospheres similar between the one on central and here.

This one feels more condesnsed than the one on central. Obviously i prefer centrals location and atmosphere better.

Food is the same at both places."}
{"text":"This is the perfect setting for a girls day on a Sunday afternoon.  Share a bottle of wine while listening to Walt Richardson perform.  Couldn't get any better than this. Also, can be very romantic with the right man.  Gentlemen take your lady's here, they will be very impressed. The food, beverage and ambiance is amazing."}
{"text":"Never been disappointed by their food. Acoustics are bad, so it's hard to hear, but SOOOOOO yummy!"}
{"text":"Great early bird specials on wine and mini-pitchers of beer before 5pm, only $5.  The food is very good and taylored to a wine menu.  A very nice place for a date with your wife or significant other."}
{"text":"This place is great!  One of my all time favorites! The decor is so nice, romantic, and relaxing.  I love how the restaurant is open to the outside making it a great place to sit wherever you may be seated! The patio is great with small tables and flowers.  This place is good for a date, happy hour, or just hanging with friends.

My favorite food to eat here is the bruschetta.  I highly recommend the bruschetta! 

My favorites are: 
Prosciutto with Figs and Mascarpone
Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese
Burrata, Bacon, and Arugula with tomatoes
Goat cheese and jam  

Some specials they offer are wine by the glass or a pitcher of beer is $5 before 5pm everyday and Mondays and Tuesdays have specials with bruschetta and a bottle of wine for $20, but it will be busy.   You will LOVE this place!!!"}
{"text":"I will make this short simple and to the point since there are 400 other reviews! Mondays and Tuesdays after 8:00pm this place is the best deal in town - $20.00 for a bottle of wine and some of the best (and generous portions I might add) bruschetta I've had! Heck even if it's not monday or tuesday this place is amazing!
Great location, Great service,Great wine, and Great food = A fabulous time!"}
{"text":"Their food (great bruscetta) and libations are fine. The crowd is more Scottsdale-ish than at the other location. Also, the crowd is denser and the wait longer. Expect to waste your money in valet; not so at the other location. 

The only problem with both Postino's is their music: it's loud and it's bad! It's an irritation as well aesthetic sodomy. For the sake of almighty Allah, can't you people get in touch with your heritage and the supernal realm by playing classical music? Not only does this music complement the aura of the wine bar, but it's elevated and pulchritudinous to boot!"}
{"text":"by far one of my favorite restaurants.  I'm totally in love with the biretta.  The best thing is to find a friend and share a salad and  brochette flight at lunch!   I took my husband once and he didn't think it was enough food to fill him up (he went home and ate more).... but for me I'm always happy and stuffed when i leave."}
{"text":"Another friends birthday tonight. And all I can say about this place is wow. Personally I love wine bars, the ambiance can be so indulgent. Postino's did not disappoint. With a cool cast and crew of waiters and cooks; the atmosphere was like a kool dry place. I do wish there was more seating; but what can you do about that? Bring a smile & your love here and the night will feel forever young!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food. Wine bar is worthy of the best wine snobs. Had the \"Pick Two\" option with half sandwich and half salad. Great portion sizes as they were just right bites. Would definitely go back to try some of the other options. Read the signs for parking as you don't have to valet your car."}
{"text":"Josh the general manager is just amazing at customer service! So sweet and accommodating. Postino is the best!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this restaurant. The ambiance was great and the food was well done. They don't have very many things on the menu, but what they do have is delicious and prepared very well. I had the bruschetta and you get to choose four different options on four slices of bread. I really felt like I got sample Italian food. It was great!"}
{"text":"If you like a LOUD DANCE MUSIC atmosphere this is the place for you!!  Food was ok.... but really I could not get over the LOUD background music that was in your face.  I have no idea who they are catering too... I am a 50 something foodie... will NEVER be back again.  I did ask for the manager to see about at least turning the obnoxious music down... looked at me condescendingly to say I'll turn it down.... geez... thanks... NOT!! Young thing that really has not idea about the real world... Love to know how the peeps in the off season that actually live here feel about this place!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing food, wine and staff! It gets very busy but for a good reason! Their specials are always such a steal too! Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"If you love bruschetta and wine, then you must come down to Postino's to dine!!

Postino's is one of those staple restaurant-wine bars in the Arcadia area that you come to enjoy casual yet delicious food, and an amazingly chic-cool atmosphere.  All the bruschetta's are delicious (my fave is the prosciutto fig), and their wine options are phenomenal.  The most fun is to come at 8pm on a Monday or Tuesday night when they have their board and bottle special ($20...a total steal!), but be prepared to wait as it can get pretty packed for that event.  

They also serve brunch on the weekends, and to be able to sit out on the patio on a beautiful winters day (thank you AZ sunshine!) for a morning meal is always an amazing bonus.

If you're in the mood to get your carbs on with some bubbles or wine, definitely come and check out Postino's!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places around. So much so that it's been labeled my official \"date\" restaurant. I've been here a trillion times (okay, maybe not that much), but have always had good experiences here - even when I accidently lit a napkin on fire at the table. 

I have very little patience for waiting anywhere, but I will wait a half an hour to be seated here, which is pretty often on busy weekends with a party more than two. The wine list is hand-selected and always amazing. The bruschetta is TDF (which, is one of the things I miss most about being #glutenfree), I recommend the ricotta and pistachios and the apple one. Their sandwiches are amazing (although I don't actually like their focaccia bread, I always went with the cibata). The waiters generally remember who you are, and some of them even remembered the wine I get so much so that when they rotated it out of the menu they were genuinely concerned and addressed it as soon as I arrived! 

On Sundays and (I think) a weekday night, they have live music. SUCH a great ambiance! If you love olives as much as I do, you have to try the olive sampler platter. It's brilliant. Even their soups are delicious. If I ever move, I will miss this place for sure. Oh, and try the creme brule. It's a must!"}
{"text":"I think it's pretty evident from all the rave reviews that this place is really good so I'll keep it brief.  I'd heard about this place forever and the bottle of win and bruschetta deal but I hadn't actually been until Monday night with a friend from work.  I was really excited once I saw all the differenct varieties of bruschetta we could choose from.  We ended up getting the Apple/Brie, Burratta/Bacon/Arugula, Salmon/Pesto and the Peppers/Goat Cheese.  All of them were delicious and I can't wait to go back again and try the rest!"}
{"text":"I went to brunch with friends and the food and service was great.  I have been there several times over the years and always enjoy myself."}
{"text":"Monday and Tuesday night, this is the place to be. Plan on a short wait for a table though! For $20 you get a bottle of wine and a bruschetta board, making this the PERFECT date spot! The setting is industrial, yet dark and intimate. The service is hurried, but efficient. And the food, oh the food is delicious! Coming from the same family of restaurants as Windsor, and Federal Pizza Kitchen, the success and popularity, as well as the quality of Postino comes as no surprise!"}
{"text":"If peanut butter and jelly are a match made in heaven, then bruschetta is meant for wine tasting.  It's hard to beat the price to quality ratio for the bruschetta here.  My favorite is the prosciutto with fig and mascarpone.  It has the right balance of sweetness and saltiness.  The smoked salmon with pesto is a close second.  On the other hand, wine selection is a little lacking."}
{"text":"I had a girls night out last Saturday.  Bruschetta was so yummy!  We tried four different kinds.  They were all very good.  I can't wait to go again!!!"}
{"text":"There is nothing that I don't love about this place.  My first visit was a late afternoon lunch after a hike and we sat on the patio.  Trust me when I tell you that you MUST get the bruschetta.  I can't wait to go back.  The parking doesn't bother me a bit because it's all part of the experience-don't let it deter you.  If you want a big lot and a restaurant with crappy food, no ambiance, and terrible service, go to Chili's."}
{"text":"Just as good as Postino Central, and more spacious.  Food and wine are excellent as always.  I would recommend a Tempranillo if you want a red wine that is more fruity but not as strong as Carbenet.  Be aware that gratuity is 20% for a large group and parking is limited around the restaurant (although they do have valet for $3)."}
{"text":"How do you not love Postinos?  The $20 wine and bruschetta deal is fantastic. The bruschetta is always sinfully delicious and I have had EVERY type they offer.  My favs are the white bean, the apple/brie, and the fig. $5 glasses of wine from 11-5 pm.  Say whaaat?   Yup.  However, today I branched out and *didn't* get bruschetta. Say it isn't so.... I got the Tuscan Tuna panini.  I don't know how you make tuna taste sinful, but they did.  This is fresh, high quality tuna on either a ciabatta or foccacia. I opted for the ciabatta.  Delish!!  Seriously though... what the heck do they DO to that tuna?  I never get this jazzed about tuna. ;)
You get a choice of chips or salad and I opted for the salad. Simple, light, with a touch of goat cheese. I actually had to take half my sandwich home because it was so big. Yay for branching out!  Did I mention I loved the tuna?"}
{"text":"The fig, prosciutto, marscapone bruschetta is life! I had the Brussels sprouts salad as an entree, and it was just OK."}
{"text":"Went to Postinos with a business friend. We meet up every couple of months, always at Postinos, though we switch from the Arcadia location and the central location. Food and wine are always great. However, the music is questionable. My last time at Central was for lunch; they were playing rap. Really? Rap at lunch??? But I have to give them points because once we questioned the choice in music, they changed the selection. My after work business meeting at Arcadia wasn't about the choice of music but the volume.  The place was packed ( which says a lot for the place) but the music was SO loud you couldn't hear yourself think.  People trying to have conversations were having to yell over the music. 

Note to Postino's - your food is great, you are busy all the time, Why do you have to drown out people's conversations with overly loud music?"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in PHX, I make a trip almost every time I'm in town.  The food selection is limited but good, there's an admirable wine selection but the atmosphere is unlike anything else in PHX.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"The happy hour here is good -$5 pitchers of good beer. They are mini-pitchers about 24oz but still they have really good beer on tap. The food is also really good. It's not your average fair. Totally original concept of small open face sandwiches. If you go; go at happy hour. The parking can be a bitch and the wait can be one too."}
{"text":"I love how nice and helpful the waitstaff is. I also appreciate that they didn't make fun of me for sending my husband to the wrong Postino's to meet me; simply refilled my water and brought me a delicious pinot noir for my wait. 

We learned that we can order only two slices of bruschetta rather than four, so we can have a small appetizer while we sat and chatted a little. I do wish the salmon would come with something other than pesto.. maybe herbed cream cheese? It just tasted like it was missing something.  My husband got the peppers with goat cheese, which he loved. 

I love brie, so I was determined to try the prosciutto with brie panini. I was so impressed. I have officially found my new favorite sandwich. I took half of it home and heated it up the next day and it was still delicious.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite restaurant in the valley. I typically go to the Gilbert location as I feel it's the largest but had brunch at this location on Sunday. The bruschetta is an absolute must whether you are there for dinner or weekend brunch. They have $5 mimosas and bellinis which are equally delicious, and a large wine selection. I have never had anything bad from the menu here!"}
{"text":"Arcadia area is very cool and Postino fits right in"}
{"text":"My lady and I hit this for the first time and is right down the street.  I had the Spoke And Wheel burger and have to say may have been the best burger I have ever had.  She had the Rib Eye and loved it.

Atmosphere is nice and might be a good hang out for sports with all the TVs but I suspect is a little to nice for that.  Has a huge patio area that is dog friendly and we look forward to trying it when it's cooler."}
{"text":"Oh, what a glorious establishment!  I don't think there is any room to say anything new after over 50 reviews.  I think my fellow Phoenicians pretty much have it taken care of.  However, I will second that the wine is great as is the bruschetta.  I'm not sure you can write a review of Postino and not mention the bruschetta.  I'm ready to go back for lunch and try something else off of the menu and also take advantage of the $5 wine.  Yum!"}
{"text":"A new favorite is born!  My wife and I came here recently for a weekday lunch while in the area and were steered here due to all the positive reviews.
It was moderately busy even on a weekday, so I can't imagine how it would be Friday-Sunday, especially for dinner-packed I'm sure.  The only downside was parking, it seems valet is the only really viable option.

Great decor and atmosphere here.  We walked through inside, but opted to sit outside as the weather was perfect. We ordered the bruschetta and all the selections were great.  My favorite was the smoked salmon while my wife preferred one with peppers.  We also split a raspberry salad of some kind that was also excellent.  
My wife had a Malbec that was near the bottom of the list that she really liked, while I was super happy they had Four Peaks Hop Knot on draft.
Also great drink prices daily, I think till five o'clock?  This will definitely be a return often type place when anywhere in the area!"}
{"text":"The very best.  Plain and simple, can't beat postinos! I wish they had them in my new state, but for now I just have to visit when I visit home (it's always my first stop after landing)."}
{"text":"What a great place to go.  Their bruschetta board is great.  Also made it for happy hour which is on wine and beer and it's fantastic.  The ambience is casual but classy.  Love the outdoor space.  Would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Brie and Apple with Fig bruschetta....I dont need to say anything else!!!!  (except $5 glasses of wine til 5 all week and $5 mimosas til 5 on the weekends)  Best place to spend a Sunday afternoon"}
{"text":"So dang good. Stopped in for bruschetta and a glass of wine and I didn't want it to end. It was a Friday mid-day and I had no problem getting a seat. Friendly service and just an all around exceptional experience. Can't wait to make another trip to Phoenix, just so I can come back here!"}
{"text":"Five stars. Seriously just go. The service was top notch and the atmosphere was so wonderful - awesome design inside and their playlist was all music I have on my iPhone right now: The Shins, James Bay, ect. The food was truly beautiful and tasted just as good as it looked. I was sad I felt full before I finished all my bruschetta. My family LOVED that all the bruschetta slices were already cut into fourths so we could easily share. We will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Food is GREAT....wonderful salads, coffees, incredible desserts YUM"}
{"text":"Love it!  It was pretty far away from my home in Glendale, but I think it was worth the trip.  We had girls night here a couple weeks ago.  We had a cute waiter, who helped us with our wine choices.  We ordered 4 different types of bruschetta and they were divine!  Will defiantly come back even though it was a little pricey It still wasn't that bad considering the quality."}
{"text":"Fantastic as always.  My family and I were visiting from out of town, we used to live here and come here very regularly, so it was definitely on our list on our way to the airport. 

We chose four different kinds of bruschetta, the tomato jam and sheep's milk cheese, the warm artichoke dip, the green apple and fig, and the roasted red pepper and goat cheese, there's just nothing else like this in the world.

They also have great deals on wine and a half pitcher of beer. As long as it's from opening until 5 PM, most things are just five dollars. It's a fantastic deal especially for a Sunday afternoon

For our entrées, my daughter and I chose the prosciutto and fig jam panini- I had the raspberry salad as my side and my daughter had the roasted red pepper and Gouda soup. You can't even read that without your mouth watering!

The weather was gorgeous, the doors were all open. It was a gorgeous sunny Sunday in Phoenix. This will go down as a wonderful memory, and we will certainly be back the next time we're in town."}
{"text":"Postino is the go to favorite for the Arcadia crowd. If you have good friends bring them and enjoy the ambiance. On a beautiful sunny day the doors of the old post office are open ,creating a breezy inviting atmosphere. 
Begin your meal with the plate; an assortment of goodies all piled onto a cheese board. Next enjoy the brie and prosciutto sandwich with fig spread. Pair it with a $5 glass of Prosecco or a big bold Cab and you have yourself a relaxing and enjoyable day with buddies. You can't beat it! 
After lunch you can even walk next door to LGO and shop for goodies! Gifts, Children's books, Candles, deserts by Tammie Coe, and wine!"}
{"text":"There is nothing better than a lazy Sunday at Postino. Actually, there is nothing better than a lazy any day at Postino. The food is great, the wine is great and the service is (usually) great. Along with the bruschetta, which is yum, I always order the Italian Picnic salad. The beets and bacon are delish paired with a creamy, Italian dressing. The only downside is the parking. Very limited and usually you have to valet. If you are in the neighborhood I recommend walking or biking. All in all this place will not disappoint."}
{"text":"I don't know how anyone could give ANY Postino less than 5 stars. 

How on God's Green Earth could you hate a place that has . . . 

1) Phenomenal Happy Hour 

SO many options for a glass of wine or a pitcher of beer for $5. 

2) Monday and Tuesday nights, $20 for a bottle of wine and one of their infamous bruschetta board? 

Call it a date. 

3) Quaint atmosphere. 

While it can certainly get loud in here (I know my MIL was not fan of this when we went to the Gilbert location), there's something about jamming out to everything from Pearl Jam to the Foo Fighters to some Hipster Nonsense to recharge you after a long week while swilling some Rose or Pinot Noir. 

We dropped into Postino Arcadia earlier this year with a large-ish group to celebrate the sale of Amy K.'s family's company. 

Mimosas and bruschetta and great company? 

Yeah, I'm in. 

There haven't been many bruschetta options that I haven't enjoyed, but sure you order the Apple and Brie and the Salmon Pesto on your boards for a guaranteed culinary rager in your mouth. 

Think of it as your savory (SP) followed by dessert (AB). 

Stop in and relax with a bottle and board."}
{"text":"Dear Postino,

I try to stay away but I just can't.  Last night was my third time indulging in your delectable bruschetta in the last 9 days.  Your bread, such perfection, crunchy on the outside (but not so much that it pokes my delicate palate), yeasty soft goodness on the inside, a sublime bed for those gourmand  toppings.  So what if you've slightly squeezed the portions of late?  Hey, everyone's feeling the recession.  When your figs are as luscious as they are, your salmon this smoky and savory, your prosciutto NOT bought from TJ's like what's in my frigo,  your brie this buttery-- a little goes a long way.  I know I drank you dry of your sparkling Rose this week, so I'll wait at least a few days for my fix until your next wine shipment arrives.  

Until then, 
Love, 
Mandy

{"text":"A cousin I'd met in Madrid 12 years ago came to town last month, so I decided I'd take this opportunity to finally try Postino after all of these years and take her there.  It was on a Tuesday, and I was fortunate enough to stumble onto the online menu beforehand and find that Postino offers $20 bottle of wine AND bruschetta on Tuesdays after 8pm.  I was a little wary that it seemed very noisy inside, but there was no way I'd have my cousin steam outside in the patio after she had just recounted how perfect the weather was in San Francisco, a stop she'd made before arriving in PHX.  

We had a blast!  For $20, the two of us enjoyed a nice bottle of Heron chardonnay and a platter of six HUGE bruschetta halves (ricotta with dates and pistachios; smoked salmon with capers and herbs; roasted red peppers and goat cheese; and prosciutto with figs and mascarpone). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/u-SJ5QUwrNquL9VnXwl8cg?userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA#oGjoq-y0BpTf_Ug6K6vmgQ  My non-sweet-toothed cousin's fave was the peppers and goat cheese.  It was good, but I always have red peppers and goat cheese, and since I have a ROARING sweet-tooth, my #1 fave was the ricotta, dates, and pistachios.  Tied for 2nd place were the mascarpone and salmon.  I'm not much of a prosciutto fan, as I find it a tad too salty, but the sweet mascarpone cut through some of the saltiness.  The salmon and capers were so tasty!  

Nice atmosphere- lots of positive energy.  Our server was efficient, friendly, and never overbearing.  Cute restroom.  My only complaint is that it is so dark indoors!  I know I've said this before, but I'll say it again- I like to feast my eyes on the food's presentation!  Please, add more light!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/u-SJ5QUwrNquL9VnXwl8cg?select=zsIkd6EUxXYbejAx8Srdeg#zsIkd6EUxXYbejAx8Srdeg

Cousin has made me promise her I'd take her back to Postino (or perhaps someplace similar?) on her next visit.  If that isn't glowing praise for Postino, I don't know what is :)"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of LGO for years and yet had never been to Postino's.  On this trip to Phoenix, my friend J thought it was a must to experience Postino! We arrived around 8pm and thought it best to use the valet.  We were so happy that we were able to get a table.  Postino's is absolutely darling.  Our server recommended an earthy red wine that J took advantage of and loved.  I had the sparkling Sauvignon Blanc (delightful!) and our friend R had Framboise.  This is a wine and beer place, so those hoping for other spirits are out of luck.  For those that love wine... this is an excellent place to spend some quality time.  Fabulous wine selection!  
As for the food... we were happy with everything we ordered except one thing, which I will save for the end of my review.  Postino regulars recommend the bruschetta and everyone seems to have a different favorite.  This is a fun food to order because you are able to choose 4 of the selections.  Fun decision to make with so many great selections!  My top two faves were 1. bacon, arugula and tomatoes (loved this combo!) and 2. warm artichoke spread (excellent!).  R + J loved the prosciutto w/figs and mascarpone.  So highlight of our night was the fun and delicious bruschetta!
We also shared olives (meh) and the prosciutto panini.  I enjoyed the panini but my dining partners were crazy about it.  
The best and worst of the night were our desserts.  We couldn't decide which one to order, so we got two.  One rocked our world and the other was ho-hum.  The Creme Brulee was the BEST Creme Brulee I have tasted.  Beyond words delish!  The Chocolate Bouchon was not noteworthy.  As my friend Beti would say, \"It wasn't worth the calories.\"  
I may have mentioned the word \"fun\" a few times in this review but that is such a perfect description of Postino.  If I lived in Phoenix, you would positively catch me here on a Monday or Tuesday night for their amazing $20 house bottle of wine and bruschetta special.  Oh and the Creme Brulee!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants of all time.  Great ambiance, awesome drinks, just take my word for it you will not be disappointed !"}
{"text":"I always go on Mondays and Tuesdays after 8 for their bottle of wine and bruschetta for $20. Its to die for and a good deal! My favorite bruschetta is the roasted peppers with goat cheese. My mouth is watering just thinking about it! YUM"}
{"text":"It's little gems like this that make me love Phoenix. (Phoenix can sometimes be a bee-ach from hell but if you're patient, she rewards you.) The only drawback to this place is parking. And since I can't get here on the light rail I have to drive. And if I have to drive, I have to park. But when I can't park, it's a hassle. 

However, once you achieve parking success, Postinos is awesome. I love that it's in an old post office. I love how the garage doors open, like a giant Arizona room. I like the drinks, I like the laid back lounge atmosphere, I like the service. It's a little pricey, but hey, this isn't McDonalds. I remember that I really liked their bruschetta. I've gone to Postinos to welcome friends back to Phoenix and sometimes to say goodbye. It's a great place for both."}
{"text":"What more do you need to say about this place other than perfect 5 stars. They are consistent, fun and awesome. I love all of their food but my favorite thing is the butchers block cheese board. My boyfriend and I will grab a few glasses and share that and it fills us up. We also get the salted caramel sundae - YUM. My favorite wine is the Fernlands sauvion blanc but they always have a great selection and it changes up pretty often."}
{"text":"This place was Delicious. Try the Apple bruschetta and the salmon bruschetta. I went on an extremely busy night where they had a $20 board and bottle specials. The wait was over an hour and you were pretty much obligated to use their valet unless you wanted to walk very far so factor that into your budget. The food was really good but the portions are relatively small if you are sharing. Overall I will come back to this place just not on the night they have the specials."}
{"text":"In the words of Herr Bruno....\"Fantastiche!\"

We love to go hear and grab some groovily topped bruchettos and a glass o vino.  Great ambience.  Good people watching.  Super servers.

Parking is iffy  Valet sometimes a must.   We usually get there early and have no wait."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's tucked away in a quaint neighborhood which is perfect! Sometimes there is live music other times not, however the ambience always seems very casual and classy. The happy hour prices are very fair and I love the bruschetta boards."}
{"text":"This. Place. Is. AWESOME!!!! I went over there with my lady yesterday and we sat and drank, and ate, and drank some more for about 4 hours. It was an amazing afternoon. The sun was shining, music was playin, and Postino's was happenin. 

We started things off with some Mimosas (it was still only 11:30) along with the bruschetta. This bruschetta plate was the best thing ever. You had four large pieces of bruschetta, topped with whatever you wanted, and then sliced into four. So we had 16 delicious pieces of warm bread with amazing stuff on top to go with our first round of Mimosa's. 

Noon time came, and it was time to switch to beer. What's this you say? 5 dollar pitchers of beer???? ALL DAY?!?!?! Sign me up! And this ain't no Bud Light sports bar pitcher, this is Hoegarden baby, and Odell's IPA. This is good freakin beer! So the wife got a cup of the soup, and we drank beer, and life was pretty freakin great. 

The sun was shining down on us pretty hard at this point, so we moved onto the couch area to beat the heat. There we sat for another couple of hours, putting away pitcher after delicious pitcher of beer, when the hunger bug snuck up on us again. No matter, PUB BOARD to the rescue! Pretzels and mustard and nuts and cheese and chorizo, and MORE BEER! 

All this food, mimosas, pitchers of beer, more food, and more pitchers of beer, and our entire afternoon cost me $55. That's not bad. 

Oh my oh my. This place is really fun, really cool, and the 3 super cute waitresses don't hurt anything either. Best valentines day ever, and thank you Postino's for facilitating our drunken afternoon! I will be back soon, and back often!"}
{"text":"I was very impressed with the owner Brad getting back to me on a concern I had in the restaurant a week ago. He totally solved the problem. I live between Scottsdale and California. I love that restaurant. A little crowded and I know little noisy but the service is great. And the staff is very friendly. A great place to go and relax with a glass of wine during happy hour where they have a five dollar menu. Highly recommend them."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Postino. It's so comfortable and a real class act. Of course the wines are delish, the crowd is hip, and the food is yum. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is solely because there's practically no reason for me to go here, which may be my own damn fault for being a relative homebody given my employment (concierge). I wouldn't go here for an after-shift glass of wine, just because I know it will be swamped. And especially if I'm alone I will avoid this place. And if I'm looking for romance, well, the packed thing nixes that idea and they don't take reservations. I would suggest this place, however, for cougars and other single types."}
{"text":"This place is so cool! The ambience is perfect! It is in an old post office. Their food is phenomenal. Easily, one of my favorite restaurants! They have delicious bruschetta and a wonderful wine selection."}
{"text":"Great wine and bruschetta deals. Service is hit or miss but you won't mind with the great atmosphere and company! I recommend the mimosas and bellinis and the awesome brunch menu."}
{"text":"Their wine and bruschetta deal is great.  The few times I've gone, the wine was always good, and so was the food.  This location is really nice, and the service has been consistently great.  It does get crowded, but for good reason. I honestly only took away a star because most of the people you'll be surrounded by are douchebag yuppies and it can get really annoying.  It's not the restaurant's fault, just... be prepared.  Their panini are really good, but it pisses me off when restaurants offer potato chips or some bland salad as their side.   Offer a real side, don't just dump half a bag of Miss Vickie's, or whatever, next to my sandwich and call it a day.  Otherwise, have the decency to go balls-deep, abandon the kettle crisps, be honest, and just load the plate up with Cheetos or Doritos Cool Ranch.  (This is less about Postino's and more about my hatred of potato chips as a bullshit side.)"}
{"text":"pretty f'ing good. 

a little intimidated at first because while i am a fan of wine, it is normally the $8/bottle beringer that you can find at the gas station. quality, i know. but the waitress was more than helpful with picking out something I liked and like every other person has said - the bruschetta was amazing. especially the apple and goat cheese combination that i was a little wary of at first."}
{"text":"We went to Postino's last night and had an excellent dinner.

The cedar plank bruschetta is a wonderful accompaniment with their wine selections and can be customized to taste. With at least 8 selections to choose from both my husband and I found bruschetta that we enjoyed.

 For dinner I had the mixed green salad and he chose the tuna panini. My salad was much better than it's very ordinary title. With grapes, Gorgonzola, tiny fried onion strings and a wonderful vinaigrette I left feeling satisfied but not overfilled. My husband's tuna panini was also excellent with a perfect amount of flavor.

The best part about the restaurant for me, was the ambiance.  We went late in the evening.  The soft flickering candle light and open dining room created an atmosphere that would be wonderful to dine with either friends, or a date. It would be a perfect place to spend a few leisurely hours sipping wine and talking.

We are excited to go Sunday from 12-3 for $5 Sangria and live reggae!"}
{"text":"Always a great place to go for a light meal, snack, or just a glass of wine."}
{"text":"Sunday afternoon as Postino is a special time. With perfect weather and wonderful sangria, Postino offers a hip place to have a drink and feel like you are out doors with their roll up doors open. The entertainment is always a plus!  The service is spectacular and friendly too!"}
{"text":"I liked the bruschetta.  It was fun sitting outside and enjoying the atmosphere.  Very trendy.  It was nice enjoying a meal while catching up with my girlfriend here."}
{"text":"Can't believe I am saying this...but I wish we had a place like this in Sac! I visited Postino's last week during my visit to Phoenix. Didn't know exactly what to expect but I walked away knowing i would miss it.  My friend and I ordered the sparkling Rose wine along with an order of their Brushchetta.  Oh delicious!

The way their bruschetta menu works, is you choose 4 toppings for $12.75. It is served on full, thick slices of delightfully soft, perfectly crusted Italian bread.  My favorite was the Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone (favorite).  Although I also ordered the mozzarella and basil....I didn't care for it as it sat next to the first variety. :) Yummo!

The best part is...on Monday and Tuesdays, there's a special! Our total would have been about 45 bucks (bottle of wine roughly $25 and Brushchetta $12.75), we walked away paying a little over $20!  Can't wait to come back to Phoenix for this little haven. :)

If you are a local patron, stop by.  You won't regret it. :)"}
{"text":"why is it that you can live somewhere for 3 years and then find the BEST place EVER right before you're moving...so was my fate with this AWESOME place in arizona...

postino's is awesome...the wine selection is good, the atmosphere is charming and delightful, and the food is amazing, delicious, and so very reasonably priced!!! the bruschetta is PHENOMENAL and the sampler plate lets you pick and choose which ones you want...(GET THEM ALL!!!!)...

seriously, one of the best places in PHX to get drinks, food, and quality times with good friends!"}
{"text":"My original postinos!! I have been coming here since 2010 and have been to almost every location. I love the atmosphere, the 5$ happy hour... Seriously what gets better than a pitcher or glass of wine for 5$??? The bruschetta is my go to comfort food and love the service. Postinos has it down when it comes to affordable date night, but with a classy ambiance."}
{"text":"Postino is my favorite cafe in Phoenix!!!!! The customer service is outstanding. In my first vist I was greeted by almost all the employees, asked if I wanted water or anything to drink while I was waiting for a table. In my second visit that was 2 months later I received the same service :)  I love the live music on Sundays and the food is excellant. The bruchetta board is the best and filling. Just enough food for 2. Having Sierra Navada on the beer list is a great plus as well."}
{"text":"The $5 wine by the glass every afternoon is such a total win I still can't get over it. Went there before a flight last week to kill time and it was an awesome vibe--pretty full at 1pm on a Wednesday. Friendly bartenders--and did I mention wine is $5 a glass every afternoon? (Beer is also $5 per pitcher.) Try the sparkling sauvignon blanc. 

Made me want to buy a house in walking distance and move in."}
{"text":"Only missing a star because of parking. The food (esp. the bruschetta) is excellent!"}
{"text":"I love this place and finally was able to sucker my picky husband into going. He loves bruschetta, but I'm pretty sure this topped the cake for him.
They have had a win with me from the very first time and easily won my husband over. 
Service is always good. Food is always great. Hipster vibe is pretty legit. :)"}
{"text":"Parking here is a pain but there is a small hidden parking lot if you are ok with walking a little bit. Or you can do complimentary valet, but I never do that because you are still expected to tip.  

The restaurant is very trendy. They have both indoor and outdoor seating. They have a great selection of wine. My wife had their four combo of bruschetta. She totally loved it. I had the autostrada panini. It was really good. I like the bread it was on. Would totally go back again."}
{"text":"A trendy spot to hit up. I am not a big fan of wine, but gave in to coming here with my friend that loves wine. I hear there is a $20 bruschetta and bottle of wine on Mondays and Tuesday. Well last night (Monday) we got the $13 bruschetta (with 4 pieces you choose) and a $30 bottle of Grayson, a cab, all for $20. I mean what a deal.

Dark atmosphere, good food, good variety of wine. Definitely a great local business to support. Parking is probably the biggest problem you'll encounter.

Oh and they have a \"People Love Us On Yelp Sticker\"!"}
{"text":"The original! The spar is great but the people are definitly the Arcadia type .  I prefer the central location but it's ago to spot especially on a Monday night! The best wine try the one of a kind downtown red. Ricccch"}
{"text":"Good, decent wine selection.    I do wish the menu was a bit broader. Not complicated, but, broader.   This would be a good antipasta/appetizer sort of place.

Great place to sit back and talk with friends"}
{"text":"Thank you Erin for introducing me to this amazing place! 

After a long hard week of teaching 25 all-day kindergartners, Erin and I would escape to the land of wine and bruschetta at Postino and dish about the latest glue stick crisis. Splitting the fig and prosciutto bruschetta and drowning my migraine in wine, I'd emerge as a new revived person. 

I love everything about this former garage turned restaurant. Great patio during the spring and fall and wonderful ambiance inside. I would usually make a meal out of the bruschetta plate alone, but all of the food is tasty. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Enjoyed Lunch there today. I had there Pub Board which was a perfect starter. All the things on there from the soft pretzel sticks to the corn nuts were awesome. 

The Paninis were probably the best Ive had. The ingredients were fresh and tasted great. 

I will be back!"}
{"text":"I've wanted to try this place forever since I'm a big bruschetta fan and I've heard theirs is amazing.  Finally decided to check it out on a Saturday around 3pm. Parking is valet like pretty much all of Arcadia but valet is complimentary during lunch, Nice! 

We were seated within a few minutes of arriving.  Checked out the wine list and was pleasantly surprised to find that all wines by the glass were $5 until 5 pm. The selection was good and I really enjoyed the 2 I tried. Service was friendly and attentive throughout without being annoying. 

We ordered a board of bruschetta of course. We chose the Burrata, Bacon, Arugula, & Tomato, Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios, Smoked Salmon with Pesto, and Prosciutto with Figs & Marscarpone. I liked the sweet/savory combo of the Prosciutto one best and my BF said the Burrata, Bacon, Arugula, & Tomato was everything he wanted and more. All were delicious tho! Can't wait to try the others on my next visit!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance! Perfect for a girls get together or a romantic date....The Monday and Tuesday night special is a MUST!  The $20 special includes a bottle of wine (your choice) and 2 bruschetta boards! It's amazingly delicious!!! What a great deal, great food, and great surroundings!!"}
{"text":"I miss Postino! I moved from Phoenix about 8 months ago and every time a happy hour is needed, I think if only I could have Postino tonight... 

Phoenix, enjoy this place- go often- eat lots of Bruchetta and raise a glass of wine to celebrate ANYTHING.

Take it from me, a girl who missed her favorite place...there isn't another place quite like it. The atmosphere, the servers, the comfortable patio and wonderful selection of wines to choose from make Postino Arcadia a 5 star location!"}
{"text":"After my Radio Milano experience, my friends and I decided to get a wine nightcap at Postino.

I was already tired, but still wanted to hang out.  This was my 2nd time at Postino (first time was for drinks and dinner)  We just wanted wine this time...we ordered 2 bottles.  (I sound like a lush)  The bar closed at 11pm, which I thought was odd...on a Saturday night I thought it should be later.  But the server said that enjoy all we want and we can order all we want until then.  They will so not kick us out.

I just love the atmosphere of this place.  I don't feel that I am in a pretentious crowd and the service is so on its mark.  There is a chance that I will be there for New Years...and if so...update!!!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I have been here a few times since my last review. Love this place! Service is always excellent and food is always fantastic. Beer and wine selection very good! All Boards are as good as it get anywhere in Phoenix (that includes all their other locations too, which I've been to all of them), hands down! 

Go for just a snack, go for a meal and just sit back and relax!"}
{"text":"Girly girls like this place, I have a lot of friends that squeal their exclamations of praise. But honestly, other than it being a cool concept/design, I don't love it. The $20 deal is good value (bottle of wine & bruschetta). Full price is not. The bruschetta ingredients are cold, served on cold, un-toasted bread. I have heard they just have a George Foreman grill back there. So, I find stocking up on the antipasto bar items at Sunflower market & grabbing a bottle of wine more enjoyable at home."}
{"text":"First time here a week ago. The atmosphere is fantastic ! We came during dinner (around 630PM) and the place was packed but everyone was friendly and so was the service.

We ordered 4 different bruschettas. I was originally intending on ordering a panini, but one of my sorority sisters suggested otherwise. A few other sisters vouched for their bruschetta, so the bf and I didn't think we'd go wrong there. All of the different kinds we tried were delicious! So much that we ordered another 4 with our 2 favorites. Can't go wrong... just pick one! Or 4... since they come served that way.

I wasn't feeling wine that night for some strange reason, but their cucumber lemonade was sooooooooo refreshing. Yes, that many O's.

New favorite stop-by-when-we're-in-town place."}
{"text":"Hubby and I have gone to Postino for years...first at the Arcadia location and now Central.  We enjoy Central's patio more, so we head there.  With either location, we've always asked ourselves, \"why didn't we think about opening a restaurant that just puts tasty things on bread and charge well for it?\"

let's face it...what Postino does is not rocket science.  Great composed salads, wonderful panini and bruschetta. but, there's no hard cooking.  What there is though is creativity, style and great service. 

on our last visit, we headed to Postino Central on a Wednesday night, thinking that since it was the day before St. Patrick's, no one would be out.  well, we were wrong. first, we were turned away by the valet -- \"sorry, we're full.\"  The parking lot?  the restaurant?  Where should we go?  any tips?  so, i got on the phone and called the restaurant -- \"Your valet just turned us away, are you looking for customers tonight?\"  He was cordial and stated he would go chat with the valet about finding a better way to turn down folks who needed to park their cars.  

hostess was very friendly and accommodating...giving us every option for seating.  but, given the spectacular night that it was, we wanted to wait for an outdoor table.  so, we ordered some beers with the very friendly waitress that happened by, and sat in the outdoor \"waiting area\" watching the sunset.  about 1/2 hour later, we got a prime table -- in fact the same table we eat at each time we are there. 

same waitress came by.  hubby ordered a second beer (i was still nursing the \"shorty\" (only $2.50!) I'd ordered before.  We selected the bella postino platter with white bean hummus and warm artichoke dip, as well as a bruschetta board of four luscious creations.

\"bus boy\" brought water and small dish of olives (okay, really small -- there were two of us and he brought 3 olives -- not 2, not 4, but 3 --yes, we arm-wrestled for the last one.)

waitress was friendly, thorough, spunky and a perfect addition to this hip, vibrant, happening place.  admittedly, we in our 40s were either parental age of the young 20 somethings gracing the place, or children of the 60+ \"second go round\" set.

bruschetta -- golly!  we had pesto with salami (great quality), burrata with arugula, bacon and tomato (there was no bacon and PLEASE do not refrigerate your tomatoes), prosciutto with fig and mascarpone (oh so incredibly good) and the \"dessert\" one -- ricotta with dates and pistachios.  after polishing off the dips and the platter of breads (there are 4 pieces to each \"slice\" of bruschetta, we were stuffed.  

was intrigued by the salted caramel dessert, but there was just no room.  perhaps next time we skip the dip and save room."}
{"text":"Yum!!
What a cool place!! The wine list is great and introduced me to a new favorite wine: sparkling sauvignon blanc!!  A perfect combination of my two favorite wines!
The extensive Bruschetta menu was novel & very good.  Also surprisingly filling.
I would also highly recommend the cheese board! Nothing was left unfinished on ours!"}
{"text":"I love Postino's!  Especially the $5 afternoon wines.  The food is always excellent. Yesterday I had my first negative experience though.  We had a large group and were told we could not push 2 tables together because of \"fire code\".  They were more than happy to allow 7 people to sit at a table for 4, but wouldn't let us push 2 tables together for the 10 of us. I hardly buy the fire code excuse...
I will still go here as much as I always have, but have to admit, I was annoyed!"}
{"text":"Everything I ate was soooo good!!! We got the artichoke, red pepper, prosciutto and fig, and bacon/arugula bruschetta. Amazing...although, the next time, I'd switch the artichoke for the apple with fig jam one! We also got the green mix salad which I thought may be just a tegular greens salad with pear but no. The fried leeks on top and dressing...yum!!  All so good."}
{"text":"Yum! I've only ever had the bruschetta so my review is based solely on those menu items. Everyone has a different \"favorite,\" so you have to try them all to find yours. I really do think you can be full and satisfied by ordering just the bruschetta. Another tip is that you can order half boards. So you can say, \"half salami & pesto, and half brie and apples\" if you want to sample as much as you can in one visit.

Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato & Basil - yummy, a classic.
Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone - definitely my second favorite!!!!!
Salami with Pesto - delicious!!!!
Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomatoes - delicious.
Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios - MY #1 ABSOLUTE FAVORITE
White Bean with Chopped Tomato - yum!
Warm Artichoke Spread - unimpressed. didn't live up to my expectations. I ordered this once and didn't bother to order it again on subsequent visits.
Brie & Apples with Fig Spread - I'm allergic to apples (weird, I know) so I cannot comment on this one. But my friends loved this. 
Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese - never tried this.
Smoked Salmon with Pesto - never tried this.
Tomato Jam & Fresh Sheeps Milk Cheese - never tried this."}
{"text":"Spent much of 2010 going back and forth to Phoenix on business trips. My team and I would do our best to make a trip to Postino on each trip. Fantastic bruschetta, amazing little chocolate dessert of yumminess, and glorious vino. Not to mention that the wait staff is super friendly and they \"share\" tables in a way that seems to work well! 

Even though the $20 deal for a bottle of wine and bruschetta was amazing, the wait was pretty long (upwards of an hour) in the 100 degree heat on Monday/Tuesday evenings. We learned after one time to avoid the crowd after 8pm on Monday/Tuesday and stick to Sundays or Wednesdays at Postino.

I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I have never had a more welcoming experience ever than I had this evening. This has been our spot for as long as I can remember. We are moving away, and when the manager John found out, he went went above and beyond to make us feel like valued guests and friends. I cannot express enough just how kind the staff here is. Thank you friends, for everything and always being our favorite date night spot. You're amazing!"}
{"text":"Postino never lets me down! Proscuitto & Fig Bruschetta is my fave. 

On Mondays and Tuesdays they have a deal for $20 you get a block of bruschetta (includes 4) and a bottle of wine. Can't beat it!"}
{"text":"The bruschettas were delicious, I remember loving the following bruschettas: hummus with artichoke, cheese with marmalade, apple with cheese, red peppers. The music and the service were great. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Frequent customer. Love this place. Great neighborhood spot with good food, beer, and wine selection.  Customer service is great and a fun and inviting ambiance.  Try the bruchetta and the picnic salad."}
{"text":"Oh postino... I have to limit my time here, otherwise it would be daily. I'm a vegetarian so I always get the artichoke bruschetta and the bruschetta with pesto- lucky me if corn is the seasonal. Champagne...rose....bellinis. (Insert more good things here)"}
{"text":"Great place to take a girl for a nice dinner date. I prefer this location to the one on central. Positive vibes and great service in a relaxed, ambient atmosphere. They definitely get the environment right. One of my favorite spots to go have a small bite and a couple of drinks. The price point is high for what you eat and drink but the atmosphere makes it worth it, which is probably why a lot of wealthy people eat here."}
{"text":"We love Postino Arcadia and when we lived in Phoenix, we ate there all the time. The bruschetta is amazing. My absolute favorite is the fig, prosciutto, and marscapone but they're all delicious. We were there on July 4th and it wasn't crowded but the ambiance was still great. Service was so so (our waiter forgot my husband's beer multiple times and like I said, it wasn't crowded) but we've found the service to be really good every other time we've been there. I think it was just fluky. 

If you're only in Phoenix for a few days, I think Postino deserves to be on the short list of local restaurants to try."}
{"text":"Postinos is one of my favorite places to go with my friends. We're even considered regulars by the hostess and valet! We go every Monday for the $20 board and bottle of wine special they have after 8 pm. One draw back is sometimes the wait can be 1-2 hours long (On these nights we go to LGO instead).

Postinos is also a great source for entertainment. People think it's a great first or second date spot. They are wrong. The one down town is significantly quieter and a way better date spot. But, there are always at least five new couples there. If you're a low talker or extremely shy you should probably try somewhere else. But don't worry, I'll be there every Monday night with my bottle of wine."}
{"text":"Amazing bruschetta--I recommend the one with figs--and fairly priced. Good beer selection and tasty bellinis. Their meat and cheese appetizer is pricy, but so good. Cheese and cornuts! Amazing! 

Very accommodating on the night of my birthday, including a free dessert. I love the atmosphere and attention to detail. Even their name is stamped on their TP. That's pretty cool.

I've only ever been for dinner and would definitely like to try their brunch."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, excellent wine, great atmosphere. Whats not to love here? Excellent for romantic dates, or just a social gathering of friends."}
{"text":"Perfect date spot!  But also perfect for a friendly gathering for wine and bruschetta.  My friends and I ordered a couple of bottles of prosecco  and 7 or 8 different kinds of bruschetta.  Perfect for 5 people and we had a great time talking and laughing underneath the heat lamps outside.  I loved this place and I will definitely come back every time I visit Arizona. 

Dear Postino, open a location in San Francisco.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Five stars for $5 wine by the glass and beer pitchers from open toll 5pm!! The good their is well prepared as well. Definitely try the bruschetta!"}
{"text":"Great place and fun environment . Be advised wait times can be 30 mins given during busiest hours . Tuesday board of Bruschetta and bottle of wine for 20$ totally worth it. Valet parking recommended , no major parking lot and can full quickly. Most of the time is loud inside ."}
{"text":"I still love this place, however their desserts need some work. I've tried the Salted Caramel Sundae and on my most recent visit, I tried the Chocolate Bouchon. Nothing to write home about. Save your money and go to Grateful Spoon Gelato (which is in the same parking lot as Postinos). I'll still give the other two desserts at Postinos a try, but so far I'm unimpressed. 

Still gets 5 stars because everything else at Postinos is simply amazing and delicious."}
{"text":"Postinos Arcadia is a fun, stylish and consistent location. We were greeted immediately when walking in from the Manager Jaime, she was kind and quickly showed us our seats. The entire wait staff was prompt and efficient. We went with the Butchers Block and the Bruschetta Board. Both were amazing! We have been coming to Postinos for years now and have tried a few locations. This one seems to be our favorite. I would like to say a special thanks to Jaime who not only was the first one to greet us immediately walking in but was also the last one to show us out. She was certainly on top of her game and it was reflected by her staff. By far our best experience yet."}
{"text":"Not as great as the hype. Bruscetta was okay. We got the white bean and tomato, smoked salmon, brie and apple, and artichoke spread. The artichoke was great and the others were okay but nothing special. Also had soup of the day, which was flavorful, mozzarella cheese and tomato salad, which had a great basil olive oil.
The service was not good. Our waitress was aloof and barely waited for us to speak before she was walking away. Our appetizers came out with the main dish and took longer than what seemed necessary given the number of customers and what we ordered.
Ambience is good...light and airy. Good for small groups and dates but not kids as its a wine bar..."}
{"text":"I usually don't write two reviews for the same restaurant at different locations, but I've been to this one and in Tempe.  Both experiences were outstanding in their own unique way.  The other location being so close to ASU, you expect it to be a bit more...youthful and vivacious.   I can understand and respect that completely.  This Arcadia spot is more my speed: quieter, laid back, and the outdoor seating among the botanical-rich patio transcends me from my busy life.  Both locations deserve 5stars in my opinion.  
Now I must try every location for a comparison...Central Ave or Kierland next?  I'm sure I can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"I really, really like this place. Several people have mentioned this place to my husband and yesterday we finally gave it a try.....what took so long?! 

Yesterday we stopped by for lunch. We started with the white bean hummus and warm artichoke appetizer served with flatbread. Umm, so good! For my meal I ordered the veggie sandwich on toasted focaccia bread with a side Meditterean salad. Ummmm, so good! My husband went with the chicken sandwich instead, it was sweet and spicy at the same time. For dessert we split the chocolate bouchon. Ummmmmmmmmmm, so incredibly good. Why did I let my husband have the last bite? Next time I will order my own, it is simply too good to share.

This will be the new place I take friends & family when they come to visit."}
{"text":"This place is A.M.A.Z.I.N.G. If you haven't been to Postino's, you are missing out! They have awesome happy hour specials - $5 for the equivalent of 2 glasses of wine (if that's your poison) or a mini pitcher of beer which comes out to about 2 1/2 glasses of beer. That little for booze?! Sign me up!!! Mondays (I think it's Monday...) all bottles of wine are half off! They feature a lot of local wines and hard to find wines. This is the place where I first fell in love with Moscato. I can't say enough about their Moscato except that it is delicious!

Their bruschettas are very tasty and hands down the best I've ever had. They get creative with their toppings and there's something to please palettes of all kinds. If I had to narrow down my top 4 favorites, I would choose: the apple, brie, and honey; fig, marscapone, and pistachio; the mozzarella, basil, and tomato; and finally the prosciutto and fig.

Downside - parking can be tough since this place is usually hopping. But they offer valet at a staggering price of $3. That's right - 3 bucks. Not too bad to have someone park your car 20 feet away. Also, the service can lag at times depending on how busy they are. But obviously those 2 things did very little to sway my 5 star review."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! The food is amazing. So full of flavor and each meal is prepared with careful attention to detail with the freshest ingredients. Always trying new wine with great recommendations from the staff. All that combined with a fair price & terrific customer service will always keep me coming back!"}
{"text":"This was my favorite restaurant. But not anymore. Today is my Birthday & thanks to them my day is ruined & I walked out crying & I still am.
I called them on the 29th & asked if I could make a reservation. They said they don't take reservations & since it was a party of 3 it would be ok & won't be too full either as it's  a Tuesday .
We went to Postinos on College Avenue Tempe. They said our wait was 1 hour. We got there at 8.30.
Then I called Postinos in Arcadia & told them we were at College Avenue & the wait was 1 hour & it was my Birthday & we didn't want to wait here outside in the heat & I asked if they were full as well & if there was a wait there as well. The guy who answered said there was no wait & they were not full & that the restaurant at College Avenue is always full. I told him we were heading  there & if we could put our name on the list. He said they don't take names over the phone.
We took 17 mins to get there & with parking I would say 20 minutes. 
When we went in the lady there tells us the wait will be 40 minutes. I had my old Mother also with us. She is 82 years. There was no place to even sit & wait. My Husband went in again to ask if we could sit somewhere & they tell us we can sit at the bar. The bar stools are so high & my Mother couldn't sit there, but we thought we will try as anything was better than standing in that warm air outside. When my husband came out & went back in with us, the lady says Oh! Someone just sat there so there's no space. She then says she will ask the Manager to talk to us.
Then we asked if we could sit at the table outside, at least while we wait. We waited there for 25 minutes & couldn't take the heat anymore. Someone was nice enough to give us 3 glasses of water. The Manager never came out to talk to us.
I was so disappointed & fed up. Tears just rolled down my cheeks as it was my Birthday & this is what I got. 
I couldn't take it anymore, I told my Husband let's just leave. I just wanted to go home.
I went in & cancelled my wait & I told the lady please thank whoever answered the phone & said there was no wait. Thanks to him my Birthday Celebration was a total disaster. I asked her what happened to the Manager who was supposed to talk to us. Then she says she thought I said I didn't want to talk to the Manager.
Everything was an excuse made for their benefit.
She says she didn't answer the phone & there was nothing she could do about whoever told me anything. I told her it was not her fault & that I was only telling her what happened, as she was the only one there.
I even showed her my call log to prove I had called them. I then requested to speak to the Manager & explained to him what happened. He really didn't seem to care. He said from the time I got from College Avenue  to Campbell Avenue, they could get busy & there could be a wait. He said maybe when I called there was no wait but it got full in 20 mins. 
It seemed unbelievable to me that in 20 minutes a whole restaurant just filled up so much inside & out & also caused a wait of 45 minutes. Just cannot happen.
He was not apologetic or didn't even try to check if he could get us a table or offer any options at all. He was very off handed & just couldn't be bothered. He didn't even check how long more we had to wait or ask us if we would want to wait a few more minutes. Nothing at all. He just seemed happy that it was 1 group less & he could wash his hands off. He Just said it is what it is.
I walked out then & heard the Manager & the lady who seats Customers having a good laugh. It might be a laughing matter to them, but I want them to know that they ruined my Birthday. I planned so much & wanted to go there as that's always my special occasion restaurant. We went there for our wedding Anniversary for brunch & last year my Husband had a surprise party for my Birthday also at Postinos. I wanted it to be my Celebration there this year too.
Instead I am now going to bed hungry as I just lost my appetite & I am so very sad. I came home & cried so much. It was past 9.30 & too late to get dinner from any place & I was not in the mood to sit & order. We went to a drive through & got some food for my Husband & My Mother.
So thanks to The lovely people at Postinos my Day, I planned so much for was ruined.
I will never go back, as it will be bad memories."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time for my girlfriends bday the other night. The table we sat at was a low coffee table with couches all around it. I had a chicken panini I can't name at the moment, but it was delicious! Between the ambiance and the food, I have to say I'll be back soon. A+"}
{"text":"When I first saw the menu, I wasn't sure if this place was going to live up to the hype.  It appears that they pretty much just have a handful of appetizers and a few different panini's and bruchetta.  

Wow, was I mistaken!  This place definately lives up to the hype.  The artichoke dip and hummus were like the best I've ever had.  The wait staff was very friendly, helpful and prompt with everything.  This would be a great place to kick back with some friends, have a few drinks and enjoy some amazing food."}
{"text":"This place has an amazing selection of wines and he bruschetta is delicious! We ended up ordering a bottle of wine and two bruschetta platters for 3 people.  The white bean one was delicious! Definitely one of my favorites! The apple and Brie was on the sweeter side, the mozzarella and tomato was also good, on the simple side.  The bacon and tomato was a superb flavor and the prosciutto and fig was also good.  I think the one with pesto was also wonderful and may have been my second favorite! The bread was soft, wish it was a little crispier but it makes for easy eats cause it's not hard to bite into! They also cut each bruschetta into quarters so it's easy to share all the different ones! Great for a wine night and bites where you just want to hang out and chat! The atmosphere is also good.. Very dark and candlelit inside and there are misters on the outside to keep it semi cool!"}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't been said about Postino, the original location is definitely a must go, the atmosphere is just as good as it was when I first went over 5 years ago and the food has just gotten better, more refined. As all would say, get a bruschetta board and bottle of wine and call it a day, you and your date will have the perfect night.  must picks are the prosciutto and apple."}
{"text":"This review goes to the beautiful hostess,with the long hair glasses and make up on point tonight! She threw down with the table before us that tried to add on one more person once they got called! Even if the table was obnoxious next to us she made it worth it! The food was decent but the hostess with the mostest deserves these five stars and whatever the world throws her way! Sending you the most positive vibrations sister"}
{"text":"Great Place! Great Atmosphere and specials!  $20 for a bottle of wine and 4 different  Bruschetta's of your choice!  Monday and Tuesday this is a place to check out!  Not sure other nights but im sure they are goo d!  Good stuff, great food, very decent wine selection!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite wine bars in the area  - great ambiance, wine selection and bruschetta. $5 glasses of wine before 5:00 pm! My favorite bruschetta picks are the Brie & Apples with Fig Spread, the Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone and the Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese - but they are all good! 

Almost always busy - expect a wait on the weekends and weeknights if they have any specials going on.  Parking is also very limited but there is usually a valet available."}
{"text":"Fantastic wine list by the glass, bruchetta, antipasto, and cheese plate is amazing!  They also have soup, salads, and other appetizer like stuff.  Great swanky wine bar type place.  Everything is delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Great! came here with my girlfriend and my mom and left very satisfied! We ordered some of there apparently famous bruschetta, some panini and a bottle of their Zweigel wine from Austria and it was all fantastic! I highly recommend going there and at least getting some wine and bruschetta if nothing else, it is well worth you time!

Keep singing,

-Jerron"}
{"text":"I went here while in the area visiting a friend who is a big fan of the Monday & Tuesday after 8pm deal of a bottle of house wine + bruschetta for $20, and it was just as good as she had talked it up to be.

We arrived before 8pm to get a table (around 7:40), as it gets packed at 8pm for this deal on Monday & Tuesday. The waitress was great about asking for our wine + bruschetta order before 8pm so that she could put the order in right at 8 when the deal started. The bruschetta, by the way, is pretty massive and awesome. You get to choose 4, and each one is the size of a small brick.

We sat outside and the weather was pretty nice. Plenty of outdoor heaters just like everywhere else here--but living on Ohio I have no idea why they run when it's over 55 degrees :)

I would definitely go back and try some of the other menu items."}
{"text":"Love the $5 glasses of wine 11-4 daily.  Great place for a late snack type lunch or late evening small bite and more wine.  Olives are great!  Parking works during the off hours, otherwise it can be frustrating."}
{"text":"I have only been here twice, but really enjoyed myself both times. They have a great wine list and the bruschetta sampler is amazing.

They cafe itself is fantastic. Very open with a ton of natural light and is very spacious. Great place to meet up with an old friend or take a date. Great for conversation and the crowd is normally a little more upscale."}
{"text":"For those of you who know me, or can tell by my reviews, I love love love me some wine! And Postino's is about one of the best places in town to get some. It is difficult for me to venture out away from my usual wine drinking whole.... but I need to through this place back into the rotation more often. 

The girls and I had a nice late dinner and wine the other night, to catch up over the Thanksgiving holiday. We had two great bottles of wine, the Malbac and the Teprinillo, a cup of amazing spicy corn chowder, artichoke dip, and the brichetta (apple and brea, smoked salmon and pesto, fig and prosciutto, roasted red pepper and goat cheese). Their brischetta makes my mouth water just thinking about it! Our waitress was awesome! Very nice, and took very good care of us, even though there was a miss-hap with out food, we didn't care, we had wine and it was fun! 

We also just found out about a special they have going on Monday and Tuesday's starting at 8pm..... $20 for your choice of brischetta and a bottle of their house wine. (PS: by house wine they mean any bottle that is on the menu!!!)"}
{"text":"I love Postino!  I have visited more than half a dozen times.  The waistaff are always friendly yet professional, and the atmosphere can't be beat for a group of friends.  It is not an ideal first date spot because it is \"open\" seating and usually very full.  However, I meet girlfriends here for wine and bruschetta all the time.  

Make sure to have the soup of the day, a great glass of wine (or a bottle!), and DO NOT MISS the bruschetta.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We had several different kinds of bruschetta and it was all incredible. Great spot for drinks and a lovely patio. One of my favorites!"}
{"text":"The food is awesome here. I recommend getting the Butcher's Block as a starter. I absolutely love the bruschetta! You get to choose 4 different kinds for the price of $14. On Mondays & Tuesdays after 8pm, you can get a house bottle of wine and bruschetta for only $20! 

It's difficult to find parking around this place. They provide complimentary parking, which we use every time we are here. 

There is a relaxing vibe all around. You can choose to dine outside to enjoy the beautiful weather, or even sit inside at the bar. There's a huge selection of wine and beer. 7 days a week they offer $5 wine by the glass or pitchers of beer 11am - 5pm."}
{"text":"Love this place in our neighborhood! food are very healthy and delicious. We normally order bruchetta with figs and prosciutto."}
{"text":"OK. I realize that I look like a huge softy with the stars but I really do love postinos. My world revolves around their bruschetta. I mean, ricotta with dates and pistachios (!) Most amazing thing ever. The apple, brie, and fig spread is pretty spectacular as well, not that I've found one I don't like. The wine, sangria, and prices are all good. The only thing that tends to be lacking is the service, but only in speed. I'd say they need a few extra hands but that would just add more bodies to an already packed house ( I have never seen this place slow) so I'm perfectly content sitting back and waiting. Give yourself some time if you plan to visit, just sit back and relax, when your server does get there they will be friendly, the wine will be good, and the bruschetta will be delicious."}
{"text":"Delicious bruschetta! Loved the setting. This is a great place for a nice ladies lunch :)"}
{"text":"Like everyone and their mama, we come here for the bruschetta board and honey cucumber lemonade. We love all their different options but our favorite is the tomato jam w/ sheeps milk and the burrata bacon w/arugula and tomato. The tomato jam doesn't sound exciting or unique, but it really is! It's a must! My husband and I got turned on to the tomato jam by our server who recommended it, assuring us that we will not be disappointed. She was right, the first bite was so dangerous because we were hooked immediately! The taste is so addicting and the flavor is amazing! The burrata bacon is also amazing, you can't go wrong with bacon and it is everything you will hope for from a bacon bruschetta and more. 
We love their happy hour $5 for a pitcher of hoegaarden! However, lately we have been skipping this amazing offer for their honey cucumber lemonade. It is perfect in sweetness, taste, and it is so refreshing!! It makes water incompetent for refreshment and it makes Gatorade look stupid."}
{"text":"I finally went to Postino. It was only a matter of time. 

It wasn't very busy for a Friday night, but I've tried to go here during the day a few times and gave up out of frustration due to the parking situation. It wasn't a problem last night. 

The place is beautiful. I really like the decor and the layout. It's comfy and fancy without being too pretentious. It helped that it wasn't at all crowded and that the weather was perfect. 

The service was friendly and VERY accomidating for both of our special needs ordering. I was impressed. 

I went into this without reading any reviews or knowing much about the place other than that it exists and people like it. I have to be honest here - I wasn't that impressed with the food. It's a simple cafe menu, so perhaps I'm being too critical, but I just didn't love it. It was decent, but not my taste. 

The food is good... I'm just not going to go out of my way to eat here. The wine was good though. Maybe they have a larger list somewhere, but the wine list I saw was pretty short - particularly for a wine cafe. Still... what we had was delicious. 

My only other gripe was that it was a pretty spendy experience - even with a discount. I much prefer Kasimierz - which is probably an unfair thing to compare it to - but I do. Maybe My Florist would be more appropriate of a comparison, but I haven't been there in years. I think this place is great and has mass appeal... My not being totally on board with it probably says more about my taste than this place.

I would definitely eat and drink here again, and I would recommend it to friends and strangers."}
{"text":"I love coming here for lunch. It's fun to get the bruschetta and a cheese board to share. The panini's are my favorite around. I usually order half a panini and a salad or soup, depending on what the soup of the day is. The Italian Picnic salad is really good. You really can't go wrong with anything you order. Everything is fresh and delicious. The atmosphere is cool and you can chill out, have some wine and enjoy the food. It's a great place to meet friends and hang out for awhile."}
{"text":"The bruschetta never disappoints and neither does the wine. I love the $20 board and bottle deal the most!! Great spot to hang out with the girlfriends to chat and relax."}
{"text":"Cute little trendy-looking place! I was in town visiting family and my cousins brought me here. I don't know anything about wine... I just drink what people tell me to drink. :) But I had a pinot grigio and it was very good.

My favorites were the Prosciutto with Figs and Mascarpone, Brie with Apples and Fig Spread, and Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese Bruschettas. I also shared the antipasto plate, but I wasn't too impressed with that. My friend had a raspberry chicken salad and that looked really good, but I didn't have room to try any.

I can't remember exactly what I had, but the desserts were very good.

It's hard to carry on a conversation here, though. It was pretty crowded and loud. The service was a little slow, but it looked like they were really busy and one of our servers looked a little too stressed out...

Also, the toilet in the ladies bathroom was clogged, so we couldn't flush. Ew."}
{"text":"I love Postinos.  Especially Monday and Tuesday nights when they have their $20 deal for a bottle of wine and bruschetta.  The tomato jam bruschetta is my favorite.  It's like eating dessert.  The only negative is the parking.  You have to valet your car.  However they do have a secret parking lot up the road that is just a short walk.  It's a little north of Cambpell on the west side of 40th street."}
{"text":"If you like bread, wine and sharing plates this is the place for you.
Cery nice decor, indoor and outdoor seating, dog friendly on the outdoor patio. 
Tried multiple bruschetta boards and seriously could eat that all day everyday. 
They are generous on their portions and they pre slice so all you have to do is enjoy with your eyes first then nom nom.
I especially enjoyed the salmon, artichoke (warm!), apple/brie and the prosciutto.
Must try them all!"}
{"text":"The absolute best! I've been here MANY times and I've never had a bad experience. They always get our orders right, the staff is friendly and attentive and, most importantly, the food is always divine! You really can't go wrong with anything that you order. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Really good.  Great ambiance.  Good wine list and great bruschetta."}
{"text":"I went to Postino Arcadia for the first time and all I have to say is WOW. This place is amazing. From the staff to the food, everything exceeded my expectations. Our waiter, Joseph Downey, was wonderful. He was very knowledgeable and helpful with the wine selection and was attentive  throughout the entire night. My husband and I will definitely be back soon!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE

yumyumyum

just try everything, especially the cheese platter and the bruschetta platter. seriously, you will be pleased.

Their champaigne and sparkling wine selection is pretty fine too. This place is SO cute! and SO delicious. The waiter is pretty knowledgeable about all the foods and makes really great recommendations as well!

LOVE LOVE

can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I love the bruchetta board so much I never order anything else. Also I recommend the english cider. My top favorite bruchetta toppings: bacon and burrata, tomato jam, salmon and pesto, and ricotta and dates. Seriously. BEST. ever."}
{"text":"Hands down the best wine bar in the Valley!  Food is phenomenal, ambiance & playlist is always great & the wine list is stellar & also constantly evolving.  We've ordered their bruschetta platter for parties & they're always a hit!  If you haven't been & enjoy wine you definitely need to go.  There are other locations but Arcadia is what I would consider the 'flagship' location."}
{"text":"I always enjoy Postinos.   Love the food."}
{"text":"4-stars for the food and wine. The ambiance is nice, but as with most Upward Projects ventures, I feel like they're trying too hard. Let the food speak for itself. All the trendy decor is just a magnet for hipster douches. Nothing ruins my bruschetta and merlot like some horn-rimmed square talking loudly about his latest inde rock band 'find' or his 'sweet pieces of vinyl' at the proximal table. Dude...SHUT UP!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood joint can't beat the bruschetta and a cold brew to relax and unwind."}
{"text":"Postino's has a great atmosphere, I would prefer sitting outside its pretty much just candle light inside a little are to read the menus.  Hands down the best thing on the menu is the bruschetta.  This is a good place to start your night with some apps and wine.  Although I was expecting a larger wine list then they provided.  The building is a cool place in itself its an old post office converted to a restaurant so you still have the glass bay doors on the building."}
{"text":"Favorite wine bar by far! More for the food of course. Bruchetta....is the best you will ever find. It's more of a french bread with toppings. Not super crunchy...a tad chewy. The prosciutto, cheese and fig is my favorite. This is a wonderful date spot and is perfectly lit for a romantic evening. Maybe a tad loud and the wait may be long, but worth it!!! Check this place out. There is one being built on Gilbert Rd in Old Town Gilbert so no more long drives to my favorite spot!!!"}
{"text":"We are new to the area and a lot of people kept telling us to check out Postino.  We finally were able to on a Thursday around 7:30.  The place was cool, I liked the vibe, BUT do not go here if loud music bothers you because they are definitely cranking it.  The fig/prosciutto bruschetta and the tomato jam with sheeps cheese were our favorite!"}
{"text":"Food is great for a small snack.  I wouldn't go there if you want a full dinner.  Awesome deck to hang out."}
{"text":"I effing love this place, that is all there is to it.  I have taken a parade of first dates in here, so much so that when I was single my friend swore they were going to think I was a lady of the night.  But I love it so, I'm so comfortable here, the place is so warm and inviting, and who doesn't look hot gilded in candle light?  I have been here prob more than 80 times, and it never gets old.  I return at least once or twice a week, and not just for a date night, wine with friends, lunches with mom, happy hour are all equally fun here.  
My favorite things: $20 night, although Mon and Tue after 8 are busier than a weekend up in here, be prepared to wait and get drunk; brushetta in all it's glory - always fresh, always perfect; the ever changing wine list, always fun to try them all and order for others; the soups in winter; the prosciutto and brie sandwhich, I die.  One more confession, I actually picked my current condo because of it's proximity to Postino.  Less than a mile.  Sold.  xx"}
{"text":"Great ambience in particular if the doors are open to the outside.  Bruschetta and charcuterie boards are both great and the wine is pretty reasonable.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Came here today for lunch with my husband and we really enjoyed the food and ambiance. We loved the great outdoor seating, and the staff was very helpful. We ordered the cafe latte which was delicious! For food we had the chicken & mozzarella panini with side salad and the turkey panini with chips and everything was fantastic! Definitely a new fav spot for us."}
{"text":"So, you're saying that I can get ANY bottle off of the list AND my choice of bruschetta for only $20. What's that? I can start my bottle now and easily move with my meal and my server once my table is ready? And you say that I can do this on Monday and AGAIN on Tuesday, starting at 8pm? Every week? Can this be true?  Thank you, Postino, for having the best wine and food deal in the valley, and creating a great atmosphere in which to enjoy wine with friends. 

I love wine. So do lots of other people that show up at 8pm sharp, rain or shine, to take advantage of the awesome Monday/Tuesday special. So be prepared to wait for a seat. If you are sharp like a hawk or stealthy like a fox, you might catch one of those coveted bar seats, but otherwise you'll stand at small tables, casually drinking your wine and doing some people watching until the host finds you and guides you to your table. You will love your wine selection. Your bruschetta will be made with the the freshest ingredients on crusty MJ bread, in the perfect proportions. Do try my favorites: Prosciutto, mascarpone, & fig; Red peppers & goat cheese; Ricotta with pistachio & dates; and Pesto with smoked salmon. Happiness served on a wood-cutting board. I paired my bruschetta with a spicy corn chowder, and it was just the best meal for a rainy night. 

The servers are very cool and know what they are talking about. They will not steer you wrong with a wine selection. If you order a bottle that is not to your liking, no problem! They serve all wine by the glass, so you can easily send it back and try another! They want you to enjoy your experience and selection, and thus have built in the flexibility for people to take risks and try new wines. Have fun with it! 

My suggestion is to find a friend or two, valet the car, put your name in for a table, get started on a bottle, make laughter and conversation, and finally take your seats, enjoy your food, and order more wine. You will be fully satisfied and will have had a great night. Do recommend it to your other friends, and definitely make plans to return again soon."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with Postino - good food and wine but I highly recommend going on Monday or Tuesday. The atmosphere is incredible and it's a great group place. I always like the board - with warm artichoke, salmon, salami, and a random one... I also love the chicken salad and tuna panini. My mom lives in STL and literally craves the tuna here. The service is always pretty good too. Only con is the parking..."}
{"text":"was in phoenix for the weekend and this was a place we bookmarked as a place to try. we got there at about 11:30 on a saturday and the place was maybe 25% full. we were greeted with a smile and the server was no different. quick drink offers and they also helped us out on the menu. it's great that they let u choose up to four different bruschettas because choosing one would be too hard to decided.

 BRUSCHETTA: 
- brie and apples with fig spread
- smoked salmon with pesto
- mozzarella with tomato and basil
- burrata, bacon, arugula, and tomato

PANINI:
- autostrada

hands down the highlights are the brie and apples bruschetta and smoked salmon. the apple brus was crispy from the apples, sweet and the body of the flavor was excellent. the smoked salmon was blended perfectly well with the texture and flavor of the pesto. the best part was the bread. in the bay area, the best bread i've come across is acme bread. this bread is VERY close and if i didn't know any better i would have mistaken the two. the exterior of the bread holds together well and is very thin. the interior of the bread is just strong enough to hold in one hand with all the ingredients on top but soft and fluffy on the bite, making it easy to take a clean bite from the bread. our second stop after that was to get more bread and pastries from mj bread who is their supplier of course. 

the servers were around but they didn't hang around u so much that u thought they were invading ur space. they would frequently walk by just to see if ur doing ok. i'm guessing we got very lucky because i overheard the servers talking about how it's usually crowded by the time we walked in. lucky us. =D 

if u get a chance u should definitely eat here. great service, price, food, and the environment is well designed for inside and outside seating. we ate at 6 other places and this was the best and most memorable one. if i'm ever in town again, u can bet i'll be here."}
{"text":"Postino!!! Been coming here for years. $5 glasses of wine before 5pm makes it my first stop every time I finish work early. Bruschetta boards, creme brûlée, and any specials they're having make it a great place to go any time though. I love the musician who is there on the weekend for brunch and I appreciate that I can always venture out and try to some new and less common wines. The servers are almost all great but I seem to keep getting stuck w the same cranky inattentive waitress the last few times I've been there which is disappointing.

This place is always busy and during their busier hours it becomes mandatory to valet but otherwise very little to complain about. I love all the postino locations but Arcadia is certainly my favorite. Best atmosphere for sure."}
{"text":"Food is innovative and delicious; best Bruschetta around.
Building is Urban Chic with Garage Doors, brick walls and concrete floors.
Service is only negative: slow and blasé.
Check out Sangria Sundays."}
{"text":"Postino is possibly my favorite place in the Valley.  The wine list is divine, the apps are delightful, the setting is relaxed but not too casual. The happy hour can't be beat, but it gets packed fast.  The bruschetta is nearing infamy at this point. I've never had a bad experience, and even hosted my sister's bridal shower here once. Love, love, love this place.  The downtown location is newer and super cute, and the food is just as great as the one on Campbell."}
{"text":"I really love coming to Postino.  They have great food, a great selection of wine and a trendy atmosphere.  The restaurant itself is pretty open and airy, but when it gets packed in there, it gets PACKED.

Postino definitely isn't lacking for customers- that's for sure.  My favorite things on the menu are as follows:

The olive appetizer (I LOVE olives), the cheese course, the bruschetta (you get to pick a few ingredients to put on it and it's amazing), the vegetarian panini and the warm chocolate tarte. I've never had a bad food or wine experience at Postino, and I could tell that the staff is highly trained on all menu items and the wine they offer- which is a refreshing change. 

Our server also recommended a really good dessert wine to go with the tarte, and it was fantastic. I wish I could remember the name of it, but I can't."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! Amazing wine list that changes frequently, great food, fun atmosphere - what more could you ask for??? The bruschetta are to die for!!! Prosciutto, marscapone cheese and figs are Camille H's favorite. I could eat an entire plate of the salmon pesto bruschetta. The artichoke was amazing as was the roasted pepper and goat cheese. My mouth is watering, just thinking about it!!! Camille H and I have been here a few times and always do bruschettta and share the picnic salad - goat cheese, beets, bacon.....so so wonderful. 

This place is loud - not necessarily a good place for a  first date if you want to get to know each other, unless yelling is your thing. Although, if you are both very hot, and love to see and be seen, this is a great spot for that!

I would NOT recommend bringing a child here. It's too loud and the food has too many \"adult\" ingredients.

OH and I learned (the $3 way) that you always say to the Valet that you are going to Le Grand Orange, and not Postino because then you don't have to pay for the valet service."}
{"text":"Yum yum in the tum! Love the bruschetta! Was recently told about board and bottle nights. Awesome deal ! Can be busy and loud but busy for a reason!"}
{"text":"Postino is great little wine bar. The food is great and so is the wine.
Everything is made fresh and the wine selection is seasonal. Some of my favorite wine(s) I have discovered hear. And you can't go wrong with the bruschetta.
The reason I am not rating it higher is the parking. For whatever reason they have valet parking now, maybe because the place has become so trendy. But it is a pain in the arse to get to now and getting a little pretentious.
It is still a great little place, though, to meet for wine and great food."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere at night. Bruschetta overall very delectable. Favorite is the one with prosciutto. Killer $20 for wine and bruschetta deal after 8pm Monday and Tuesday. 

They make reservations for larger groups."}
{"text":"I love this place for their bruschetta! Come on Monday or Tuesday night for happy hour! $20 for a bottle of wine and a board of their bruschetta! I believe the special starts at 8. We made the mistake of coming too early and spent $100 on dinner rather than the $50-$60 you save with the happy hour! Service has never been the best when we have gone but worth it for the bruschetta."}
{"text":"The soup, salad, panini, and especially the bruschetta were all fabulous! Delicious and beautifully presented. We also really enjoyed the live music and the peach tea. I wish I lived closer - this would easily become a favorite lunch spot for me (although maybe only for special occasions as it's a bit pricey)!

HIGHLY recommend. :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic. I love the bruschettas. Mimosas could be stronger. Brunch BELT isn't my favorite. Wine is amazing here. Atmosphere is superb as its beautiful around this area. Perfect patio weather. Service has been good each time I've come in."}
{"text":"Great food.  Service was a little slow, but overall I was pleased with this location."}
{"text":"Wine and a bruschetta is all you need to make you feel better after surviving a long day at work! Great atmosphere, great wine selection, great food, best bruschetta that I have ever had in my life. It's nice to have the valet for parking and it's complimentary. The service is always great and I have never had any issues at this place."}
{"text":"I love Postino they have the best bruschetta ever. I don't have a lot to say But the service was great the food was even better and the setting was wonderful. It made for a great night of conversation, wine and food."}
{"text":"Bonjour amigos!

This here Italian place is THE best Italian place I've tried in Phoenix! In fact, it's the ONLY place I've tried! The staff is friendly. We sat at the bar with a stranger and had a memorably delightful time. The food isn't the most filling, but it is DELICIOUS. Everytime I think of Postinos Arcade, I'll always remember the fun conversation we had with that stranger, and the good food.

PROTIP: We went there on a Saturday and if you want to park you need to valet, which is a whole $3. Do you know what I could do with $3? I could buy bubblegum, get 64% off a DVD at the Walmart $5 bin, and I can even buy a used book! Outrageous!

The only problems was there is no post office to drop off your mail, nor is there an arcade. I think that's false advertising.

Aree Va Dare Chee!"}
{"text":"Simply the best bruschetta in the world! arugula and prosciutto fig & marscapone is my favorite but all of them are worth trying at least once in your life. Can't wait to return to Phoenix one day and come back for more."}
{"text":"Every single time I go to this place, I walk out of that beautifully transformed post office and just think, \"wow, that was perfect.\" 

I have continued to bring friends and family there and Postino always exceeds the \"talking up,\" I do beforehand. With a knowledgeable staff, great food and comfortable ambiance, Postinos hits it out of the park for being one of my all-time favorite restaurants. 

Great Job!"}
{"text":"The most customer oriented management team ever, no matter what the price range.
Everything coming out of the kitchen looked to die for and ours was delicious too. Great outdoor brunch."}
{"text":"Another spot to get fail safe good food, the use of fresh ingredients and creative ways of using them make for a great time every time. I just wish less people would know about it so it wouldn't get so crowded at times, I guess a blessing in disguise."}
{"text":"Went to Postino last night. Had a great time, well with the exception of the crappy service. We had at least three waiters/waitresses. We had 2 glasses of wine, one of which was Brent's pick. Pretty awesome. Also had some Bruschetta. You just have to try it! Lots of unique offerings. Also had the salted carmel ice cream dessert. Yum! 

Would have given it 2 more stars had the service not sucked! Really recommend their waiters and waitresses spend more time at the tables, check up more often at the tables, and do a bit of up selling. Not once were we asked if we wanted anything extra. Hello? :)"}
{"text":"Amazing wine selection AND $5 glasses during (a super long) happy hour. A great variety of bruschetta! My faves are the salmon w/pesto and the roasted red pepper w/goat cheese :) can't go wrong with any of the paninis either! The atmosphere is perfect for dates and lunch with the girls!"}
{"text":"Delicious going away dinner with my bf at postinos outdoor dining area. Besides the misters going crazy, our food was delicious! We ordered bruschetta - fig mascarpone with pistachios, prosciutto, salami, and pesto. All were delish! We also ordered the butchers block that came with asparagus, hummus, two cheeses, prosciutto, salami, almonds, candied cherries and more. I would go back for more!"}
{"text":"Postino's is just a bike ride away - and the perfect spot for a relaxing coffee, wine, or beer. What can I say that everyone doesn't already know - This place is the BEST!"}
{"text":"I have been to this Arcadia location a handful of times. Each time I got the same thing because on Monday, and, I believe Tuesday nights, they feature what is probably the best deal in the world. For $20 you get a BOTTLE of wine, your choice, from a long list, and a large plank of four different sets of specialty bruschetta. The ambiance is upwardly-lounge-casual; perfect for both a date night or meeting friends after work."}
{"text":"Love this place! The only thing that can be improve is for them to accept reservations for parties less than 6. There is a $3 valet which makes it easier. It has a wonderful ambiance and it felt comfortable, fun, and trendy. I ordered the Bellini and it was delicious. I personally dont think they have a wide selection of drinks. The bruschetta is amazing though. I absolutely loved it. The portions are great and make you full. I loved the olives they brought out too. The music was not too loud so you would have to scream to be heard. Overall, wonderful experience! I am definitely going back. This time I want to try their brunch on Sundays."}
{"text":"Don't ask me about anything on the menu except the bruschetta, I've never been able to get past it.  Many different inventive delicious toppings on perfectly toasted slices of rustic bread, served on a narrow wooden platter.  Each and every bite is to die for, and they have a good glass wine.

The only thing I don't like is the loud techno music.  Everyone yells to be heard above it.  Which means I have to, too."}
{"text":"I like this place! Pretty good food (I only had appetizers) and you can't go wrong with the wine! The staff know their stuff, which is great! They are also very accommodating and friendly!

I think we all know the parking sucks, haha. But the only other meh thing for me is that it's very loud inside, I don't have good hearing haha."}
{"text":"This is a lovely little wine bar with some nice food options as well. Definitely try the bruschetta - - you can pick what flavors you like and I promise you will like whatever you pick! Lots of wine to pick from and good happy hour options. Service is always helpful and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"The mailman delivers!  What a cool place that at one time was an old post office. Great and I mean great bruschetta. A staff that really knows their wine and points you in the right direction.  A really cool and hip crowd, with the exception of me of course!  An unbelievable playlist. Definitely a place where you can hang for hours."}
{"text":"Only in town 1 night and looked for a quiet spot for a glass of wine.  The wine was great -- Reisling called 'Perfect' and it was actually pretty perfect!  And the bruschetta -- so creative!  Of about 10 toppings, you get to pick 4.  Perfect late night snack!  

Music was pretty loud, so the quiet part of the evening wasn't so much, but the wine and apps definitely made up for it.  The vibe is chill - - I'd go back next time I'm in town -- absolutely."}
{"text":"Love the bruschetta!  My favs are the brie and apples with fig spread, prosciutto and fig with mascarpone, smoked salmon with pesto, and ricotta with dates and pistachios!  

I've had the salads and sandwiches.  They are good, but you can get those most places, so I usually get the bruschetta! 

Staff is great.  I don't drink and usually stick to water.  Their water glasses are small, and they frequently have to refill it, but I usually end up with a glass full of ice and a sip of water lol."}
{"text":"I was recommended this place by a local foodie who is very picky. He swears by the place so I trusted him.

The location is nice, and pretty cool inside. The menu is impressive and has a lot of cool ideas. The food that I ate however was not any good.

I paid so much to get so little and what little I got was not impressive at all. I was actually embarrassed as I brought a few friends from out of town there and they also thought the food was gross. I felt like they would never trust my judgement again."}
{"text":"I had the best bruschetta here. 

The drinks were good and refreshing.

The sandwiches and salad were fresh and delicious. The place looks like a bar but comfy and big. Service was quick and patient. 

Again, bruschetta not to miss"}
{"text":"The atmosphere there is great, the food is pretty simple but tastey. I go there for their wine. It really is a great selection and the staff is pretty knowledgeable. I had the tuna sandwich for the first time the other day, cause I normally get the brushetta(sp?) and it was really good. It wasn't mayonnaise-ey. I would also recommend the nine iron."}
{"text":"I traveled far and wide, convinced many friends and get myself to this cute little wine bar. The outside patio is gorgeous, especially in the spring and fall. The inside is just as beautiful with a warm and comfortable modern feeling.

The menu is so uncomplicated with delicious bruschetta and cheese plates. I require not much else other than these when drinking copious amounts of wine nectar. However, I remember a special I believe on Mondays with half price bottles and pizza from across the street. It was unbelievable. 

The staff was so nice and gracious when minor mistakes were made. It is definitely worth the trip when I was staying across the valley and would go again and again."}
{"text":"One thing I noticed on a recent re-visit: This place is loud--both from ambient noise and the background/foreground music. And the hard surfaces and absence of carpet tend to accentuate the high frequencies. It can get kinda tedious trying to talk over it. Don't let that keep you away.

Just another way in which it pays tribute to its roots as Synthony Music all those years ago."}
{"text":"Went to \"Fair Exchange Auto\" once again and purchased another Toyota Camry! It's a black 2008, low mileage and amazing condition! This Auto Dealer \"Macky\" pointed out this vehicle first. It had just arrived 30 minutes earlier before I did. I am very pleased to say this is my wife's and I third vehicle from this location. If any of my Marines are swinging through Arizona in search for an excellent vehicle, let me know!!"}
{"text":"Same great happy hour and food as the central location.  I did not note a difference in the food between both locations.  
Arcadia has a nice outdoor patio, I prefer the tables that sit halfway outside and halfway inside.  See if you can get one when you visit.  Enjoy anything with fig on it. :)"}
{"text":"This restaurant occupies an old post office on a quaint corner in a residential neighborhood. The menu is simple, mostly bruscettas and salads. I prefer going before 6pm when wine is $5. a glass. During the nice weather the door opens out to the patio and you can even bring your dog. The waitstaff are all friendly and there is no bad table. Don't walk, run!"}
{"text":"I. LOVE. THIS. PLACE.

The bruschetta is amazing! The wait staff is uber-knowledgable about the wine and beer and it is a fun, hip, laid-back environment.

Even with 10 people for a bachelorette party, we didn't feel rushed, forgotten or neglected, and the waitresses were super nice! I'll definitely be back to Postino Arcadia!"}
{"text":"I came here with a couple friends and ordered their unique bruschetta!! They have so much to choose from and there all so strong in flavor. Highly recommended! Great place to visit!"}
{"text":"Food is super tasty! Can't go wrong with the turkey panini with pesto or bruschetta with prosciutto, figs & Mascarpone cheese. Mouth watering just thinking about it. Sundays during 11-3 they offer cool laid back tunes by Walt Richardson and $5 refreshing white sangria. A great way to relax at the end of the weekend."}
{"text":"Cactus Moon is a nice little stop over by Cabela's on 202 and Dobson. I only go there to play poker with the Dream Dealers on Tuesdays. My regular order is  the pound of wings for $5 and then usually a Three Olive Vodka special. Lots of combos there, and all are tasty. There are TVs all around the place so now that baseball season is in swing you have no problems in seeing a game if its on. The service is friendly and the food comes up quick."}
{"text":"Such a great place to have lunch, all the bruschetta's we had were delicious! My favorite was the sweet and spicy pepper jam with goat cheese and the apple Brie and fig jam. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Postinos is a true treasure in the city's somewhat lackluster scene for good, unique eating experiences. The lack of reservation and self-parking ability (try valet!) fails to put a damper on the the restaurants selective wine list, fresh food, and escapist ambiance. Be sure to go on Monday night for a  perfectly orchestrated collaboration with neighboring LGO owned pizzeria - You can't go wrong with the corn and goat cheese pizza..."}
{"text":"Exceptional restaurant, great atmosphere! Can get busy on weekend evenings but otherwise a relaxed modern feel with plenty of room to invite friends for dinner. We love the Apple+Fig bruschetta paired with your favorite red wine and we are greatly looking forward to our next visit!

{"text":"Nice surprise.....

On a way to Four Seasons from the airport we Yelped lunch restaurants and was intrigued by the reviews and menu so decided to stop by.  

It is in a more industrial area not a great part of town and for a little while thought we were lost by GPS leading us to wrong direction. only to come up to a place with tiny parking lot, jammed w/valet parking only- so good sign:)

Place is very cool looking, loud (would suggest some noise cancelling options like area rugs or ceiling /wall padding), very granola like feel (reminded me of Portland and Seattle a bit), wooden tables, beautiful central vase w/amazing fresh flowers, plain bar. The best \"personal touch\" is the stamped toilet paper- def clever idea. The bathrooms are unisex and frankly when that busy should be catered to more- papers on the floor, overflowing trash, etc.

Food- started w/the butcher's block- cured meats and cheeses- very good but not very much hard cheese at all. Bruscheta tried two- the burrata, bacon tomato is fantastic, the smoked salmon average. Prosciutto panini is OK- not warm/pressed enough and bread too think so that is mostly what you taste.

Waitress wasn't that friendly (unfortunately) and did not know the wine list that well so could not describe the actual wines by the glass. Also did not offer wine list per bottle which we would have ordered as better selection.

Overall nice place to come experiment if you are a foodie."}
{"text":"I loved Postino's. Loved, as in past tense. Living in the area for the last several years, Postino's was my go-to place for everything from Saturday night celebrations to making a Monday just a little special. The wine is great, the menu is perfect, the ambiance is downright delightful. It's the staff that makes me cringe. On a recent visit, the snobby hostess told us the wait was 2 hours... But no one was there ... And there were empty tables ... Something did not seem right and when I asked her about it again, she rudely just stared at me. 2 hours later, we got seated and ignored. It took another hour (!) for our bruschetta to arrive to our table. We left feeling hungry  and  neglected. The worst part is that I started to ask around and I have three (3) other friends with almost the exact same experience. After so many happy years at Postino's, I won't go back to the Arcadia location. On the bright side, the Central location boasts the same menu minus the horrid staff."}
{"text":"I was raving about this place to my co-worker so.we decided to stop bye for lunch. We got the cucumber honey lemonad soo refreshing. Best lemonade that ic ever had. For our appetizer we got the bruschetta. Salami&pesto was not my favorite from the ones I tryed befor. Spicy tomato jam on goat cheese, omg this one is to die for bye far my favorite. Prosciutto with figs & mascarpone this one was also very tasty The sweetness of the fight just topped it off. Fresh Mozzarella with tomato basil witch is a classic yumii. For my on tray I got the half soup and saled. The saled was amazing head had a really nice presentation. It was the raspberry chicken saled it had organic chicken saled with pecans apples gorgonzola and mayo with fresh mixed greens with raspberry vinaigrette.the food quality for the price is awsome. Very reasonable for this area. Their services though was not up to par. Our server was kinda rude and it took forever to get out food. At lest 45min witch seams a bit long. Was very disappointed in that. Last time I came here every one was so nice and friendly. Mabye it was just an off day."}
{"text":"Awesome topping combo's on the Bruschetta board and panini's are killer!"}
{"text":"This place gets a Phoenix 5. Probably lower if it were in a better city.

Postino is probably the best wine bar in the Valley, next to Kazimierz in Scottsdale. I like Kazimierz for its olive selection. Postino wins on happy hour wine selection (5$ any glass) and bruschetta.

I'd recommend this place to anyone who wants to drink a strong selection of varietals. Other wine bars seem to fall short on interesting, new and lesser known varietals."}
{"text":"Its hard to put into words what makes Postino so enjoyable.  The bruschetta/sandwhiches/salads are great, the wine is great, the staff is great, and the building is great.

But Postino is even better than the sum of its parts.  The view out of the big open garage doors is relaxing and chill, the staff has a cool Urban Outfitters-type vibe, and.... my favorite...

$5 wine before 5pm (or $5 pitchers)!!!  Three out of every four Sundays my wife and I are there around 4, sharing a bittersweet moment reminiscing about the weekend that passed and discussing the work week to come.

Yesterday she said \"I wish we could find a Postino on every vacation we take.\"    I think that sums it up - I always feel like I'm relaxed on a little vacation when I'm at Postino."}
{"text":"We arrived around 8:35 pm and were given a \"30\" minute wait time and in actuality it was a 56 minute wait time. I downloaded the app that was suggested in the first text message to check where you stood in line. After waiting close to 50 minutes I decided we should walk back up to the entrance in hopes we would be called soon. After seating us - I received a text message about 8 minutes later saying that our table was ready. When in fact there was no one waiting/sitting around for a table- which makes me wonder had I just walked up sooner would I have been seated sooner. The food was fine, wine suggestion was fine. Overall, annoyed with the wait time. We waited longer than we took to be seated, eat and pay."}
{"text":"Great bruschetta, great wine without all the fuss!  Sandwiches are HUGE and let's not forget dessert....the chocolate bouchon was amazing!  No wait and great service as well!"}
{"text":"Another 5 starts for this wonderful restaurant!!  Not only do I love the food that's served here - I mean, best Bruschetta in town!!!  The customer service continues to WOW me everytime I visit!  I hosted my little sisters Bridal Shower here in the sofa lounge area of the restaurant and everyone just loved it.  There were 14 newbies to Postino Arcadia and they'll all be coming back to visit again!!  Thanks for helping me create such a memorable day for my baby sister!  She couldn't have been happier and that means the world to me :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!

I finally made it to Postino after hearing great things from many people.  We came on a Tue night to meet up with another couple we hadn't seen in awhile.  Mon and Tue they have the special where you get a bottle of wine and bruschetta for $20.  This is a great deal.  The place was crowded so if you go make sure you go early and get your name in.  The nice thing is that you can start drinking your bottle while you wait.  We were waiting for around 45 min before we got a table but we were having fun nonetheless.  The bruschetta was amazing and there were many different types to choose from.  We also tried the grilled cheese which was delightful.  We will definitely be back again and I am excited to try more things on the menu."}
{"text":"I went here again tonight, I think I need Postino rehab.

I was with about twenty women from my sorority alumni group; we just met up for some drinks and snacks after work.  Postino knew we were coming and set aside a great little arrangement of couches, tables and chairs for us all.  I had two glasses of wine, Grayson Cabernet (which was really good) and a Reisling (I can't remember which one, but I liked it).  My friend and I also split the selection of four bruschettas.  We had the brie and apple (my favorite), the caprese, goat cheese and roasted red peppers and salami and pesto.  They were all amazingly good!  

Simply put though, I love this place because it is consistently good. The service is always great, it is reasonably priced, the food and wine are delicious and the ambiance is wonderful.  Right now is the perfect time of year for them to roll up their garage doors and let the fresh air in off their patio.  And the dimly lit bar is the perfect place to get a little tipsy on a Tuesday.  ;)

I will continue to go back time after time because I am never let down.

PS:  After reading their menu front to back, even though I have it memorized, I noticed that on Mondays and Tuesdays for $20, you can get a bottle of house wine and a plate of bruschetta.  This is definitely enough for two people to make a meal out of or for three to four to share as an appetizer.  What a great deal!

My only complaint remains their monopoly on parking and the pretty much mandatory valet.  Just let me park my own God damn car!  If you don't mind walking a bit, though, you can skip this part."}
{"text":"Postino 1 of our favorite restaurants for many years, but quality & service has slipped lately. Used to have best bruchetta in town, but no longer. bread not toasted enough, toppings haphazard. Brunch-Not enough help early on, especially when they are busy.Food not picked up fast enough, comes out luke warm. Hopefully they will get their act back."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic wine and bruschetta!!! I wish there was one in Denver!! This a must go!"}
{"text":"Ive been to the postino's off central once before, and recently discovered this one a couple weeks ago. Really friendly service, and they sold me some beer at a stupid cheap price for me to take home!! 

Ima Fan."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places.  I really love trying new places, in fact I routinely avoid places I've been before in lieu of trying somewhere new.  Postino is one of my exceptions. I will come here anytime and be toally content. 

Consistantly high quality, great service and even better atmosphere.  I am obviously not alone in this thinking because Postino can have a hefty wait time, especially for the bruchetta and wine special on Monday nights.  Its WORTH THE WAIT though.  The goat cheese and tomato jam bruchetta is the BEST!  I always try to get a double order of that one instead of picking four different kinds.  I do believe 'sharing is caring' but I have my limits and not when it comes to Postino brushettas.  

The wine list is extensive and there are always helpful recommendations for any palatte or budget for that matter.  I have sat at the bar and sampled various wines before choosing and the bartenders have all been very knowledgeable and friendly.  

Postino is a perfect place for a date, girls night out, or family dinner.  It is hard to find a singular place that is so appropriate for any occasion. 

Parking really isn't a terrible problem. There is a 'free' valet to help you out, which I truly appreciate instead of having to fend for myself in that crowded cramped lot."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great wine selection. You must have the bruschetta if you've never been."}
{"text":"If you love delicious, unqiue bruscetta, all olives, and rich, smooth wine, this place is for you! Not to mention the atmosphere is perfect for a romantic date, girlfriend gossip session, or even an (adult) family gathering. I've been many, many times, and have always gotten top notch service even when they're a full house,which is basically every weekend...so get there early."}
{"text":"There are a lot of wine bars popping up across the Valley in the last few years and they are pale imitations of this.  Postino's is great.  Love the atmosphere and the Bruschetta boards are amazing.  Lots of choices and each board is a large serving, big enough to share.  Perfect place for happy hour with the $5 glasses of wine.  I can't wait for them to open their Gilbert location."}
{"text":"The ambiance, the happy hour, the wine selection, food and service is what makes this place top notch! Always have loved this place before I moved out of Arizona, and when I come into town, this place makes me feel back at home!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely fabulous!  It has a quaint, relaxed atmosphere and friendly staff, and their bruschetta is absolutely amazing!  The portion sizes are generous, to say the least.  My friend and I split a turkey sandwich, and it was definitely more than enough to feed the both of us (with some left over!).  I would highly recommend this little gem to anyone who appreciates good food and great value."}
{"text":"If you want bruschetta, you cannot go wrong here!  You get to pick four. Request to have them cut in fours, much easier to eat!

FAVES
Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone
Brie & Apples with Fig Spread 
Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato & Basil 
Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios 
Salami with Pesto

The green picholine olives ARE SO GOOD!

Raspberry Chicken Salad is good.  It's a little sweet, but I always ask for the dressing on the side and just use a very small amount. We usually share this as well. 

The Brie and Prosciutto panini 

The pieces of paper  with 'your gum here' So cute!

Mon/Tue after 8pm $20 bottle of wine AND bruschetta! Awesome!


Cons-Loud. Really loud. Acoustics in this place are terrible when it's busy, and it usually is.  It's a little better when the doors are open.  I guess they can't really do anything about it since it used to be a post office.  Hence the name 'Postino'  
Desserts are mediocre

Crazy busy parking lot

If you don't want to valet, you will have to park down the street on campbell near the residential streets."}
{"text":"Came here after my flight landed around 10PM and made it just in time for last call! 

Ordered the bruschetta board - salami with pesto, burrata bacon, fresh mozzarella, and of course the smoked salmon with pesto PLUS a glass of rose to wash it all down lol. Everything tasted great! My fave is between the salmon & bacon one, MmMmMm.

The ambiance was nice - my girlfriend and I sat outside enjoying the cool weather with the heat lamps keeping us warm.

I would recommend swinging by for some good food!"}
{"text":"I love their $20 deal for bruschetta and a bottle of wine! this place is always soooo good! love postinos arcadia!"}
{"text":"I love Postino's! Great food and wine. The only downside is that it is on the smaller side and cannot always accomodate large groups."}
{"text":"No doubt I love Postino's. Esp before 5pm. Great wine selections. The plus at this location? The staff is very accommodating. Customers can be a pain in the butt, including thyself. Oh, and live music. Very cool."}
{"text":"My heart aches when I have to miss a Tuesday...I love every single staff member here as if they were my family. Tyler at the bar ...man you hook it up with hands down the best service in the industry!  Can't thank you enough for the friendly service, the amazing bruchetta..and even better wine! Again,  I love you postino! Thank you for making my date night surreal every Tuesday."}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix for a weekend getaway and thought I hid a foodie dead end after a few meals. I was not wow'd by much even at places that had good reviews, and disappointed I couldn't find a decent meal. And then I came to Postino! It was bustling on a Sunday morning with nearly all the tables in the restaurant filled. Luckily we were able to snag a table out on the patio. The air was filled with live music and the atmosphere was relaxed and exciting at the same time. 

Everyone on Yelp mentioned the bruschetta. Definitely get the bruschetta!!! You can choose 4 different types for $13.50. The bread was perfectly soft and all the toppings were excellent. If I had my way, I could eat this all the time. The two of us also shared an Vegetarian panini which was very good but too filling to finish alongside the bruschette. Mimosas are only $5 too. 

Postino's is worth it!"}
{"text":"I've always been a big fan of Postino but don't make it down there very often. A couple of weeks ago I met some friends to hike Camelback. After a struggling hike, we went to Postino to enjoy some food and drinks. What a perfect day! 

We sat outside on the patio and were cooled by misters. Our attentive servers brought us water right away. I started with fresh squeezed lemonade then had a mimosa. My friend and a bellini and the guys had some IPA (I think it was $5 a pitcher??) 

I can't go to Postino without having some of their infamous bruschetta... we ordered the artichoke, tomato jam, prosciutto/fig, and date/pistachio. Every bite was delicious! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"If you don't know...now you know. This place rocks all the time, but Monday and Tuesday are MECCA. $20 for a board and bottle. Now, this is not basic:

Board: spectacular bruschetta. At least 10 combos of amazing bruschetta options including ingredients like salmon, goat cheese, dates, bacon, arugula, fresh tomato... The goddamn WORKS. You choose 4 bruschetta combos for your board.

Bottle: a wide variety of their otherwise pricey(ish) wine bottles. 

AMAZING!! you will wait on Mondays and Tuesdays, but it is always totally worth it! $20 for a quality board and amazing bottle? YES.

Furthermore, other nights of the week also rock as this place has amazing brews and beer/wine. Cheers, Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place, and my expectations were moderately high since this wine bar is considered Yelp's 100 best places to eat.

I came solo and had a leisurely lunch where I wanted to order both a selection of bruschetta and half-sandwich and salad combo, but upon the waiter's recommendation I just sampled one of the bruschetta - the warm artichoke spread, which was incredible, though I gotta admit it didn't come out that warm.  It tasted like it had been sitting in the kitchen for a while before waitstaff had gotten around to picking it up and delivering it to me. Ultimately it came out kind of cold, but it was still incredibly good, so I can't complain too much (except I can because I'm Korean like that and prefer it when my food is hot off the fire hot and my drinks are icy cold).

I also had a glass of white wine which was completely forgettable, Hannah's field salad, and 1/2 Tuscan Tuna Sandwich.  I don't typically go for tuna sandwiches, but it sounded perfect, and the pickles and the mustard added just the right hint of piquancy.  The salad was nice too, though a little sweet for my tastes; all in all, it paired nicely with the tuna sandwich.  I love the kale and quinoa combo.  

This is a fun place to come with friends, so that you can share all of the different types of bruschetta.  If I came back and didn't order anything but a few different bruschetta, I wouldn't feel like I missed out. :)"}
{"text":"I am so happy I moved within a block of this place. Went to Postinos for the first time a few days ago and it was the coolest place. I love their $20 a bottle happy hour! The service was awesome and the atmosphere was even better. I will definitely be coming here to get my wine."}
{"text":"Good cute wine bar with a very relaxing environment. Fast service and the happy hour wine prices are awesome. Not enough words to express how tasty their food is! Will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday. we arrived friday in the afternoon, just in time to take advantage of the $5 glass of wines from 11am-5pm. I  enjoyed my cab: slightly smoky and full flavored. Mr H enjoyed his pinot noir.  we split the bruschetta,  it was tasty and the varieties of the bruschetta were unique and fresh. 
  
The parking is crazy here!  valet is 3 bucks. I am a fan, however the ambiance felt a little generic in my opinion (too trendy).   Overall the wine was great and bruschetta was memorable."}
{"text":"Little to be said that hasn't already been doled out in detail. 

Love the bruschetta planks and the vibe, but, I soon tire out of sipping my glass of Merlot standing and fighting for that tight high top table only to wait longer to get that food coma inducing prosciutto&fig bruschetta.

Four stars because, I say this, and promptly go back as often as I can. Things good food makes one do!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!
Recently visited Phoenix and met with friends at Postino for Sunday brunch.  A beautiful location and essentially the menu is like porn to a foodie.  Make sure you get the Bruschetta  combination and the cheese plate.  $5 wines were a hit as well.  I went with the 2 and 2 combination that had half a sandwich and half salad (or soup).  Prosciutto with brie and fig was beyond words served with the Italian salad (mixed greens, golden beets, walnuts, balsamic dressing).  I plan on going back when I am in town."}
{"text":"Popped in for the $5 wine and tasty bruschetta.  As always was amazing.  The wine was a Chardonnay from Washington called Mirth and it was very good.  Being from Washington I was surprised I had never tried it before but I'm glad I know about it now.  I went with 4 kinds of bruschetta first the smoked salmon and pesto one of my fav's then keeping with the pesto theme I had the salami and pesto, then the traditional tomato mozzarella and basil, and last a new one for me tuna and olives which was amazing.  I love this place if you have never been your missing out and if you have been you know it's always a great meal."}
{"text":"Went yesterday for the first time. It gets one star because the food was yummy. Got the choose two- Nine Iron sandwich with Mediterranean salad. Very good. Lost a star because parking is horrible despite the free but really not free valet parking. Lost a star because I do not like eating up. Meaning the table was so low you have a lot of distance to the mouth and more opportunity to spill. Lost a star because I don't like eating in my living room. Why are restaurants now making their dining room a living room? If you want to do the sofa and chair thing do it outside. Not fond of high tops either. Lost a star because they opened the garage door. We chose to sit inside for a reason. They opened it and all of a sudden it was 60 degrees."}
{"text":"Was told from friends that live in Arizona that Postino needed to be a stop. They have the best bruschetta you can get paired with some fabulous wine. I would suggest getting the meat & cheese plater with the bruschetta completed with a glass of red wine."}
{"text":"Any opinion I could possibly have developed on Postino would just be a reiteration of something that's already been said several times already below, so I'll just add my vote in favor of this place.

Delivers the hype *drops mic.*"}
{"text":"Postino, oh Postino. You never disappoint. No matter what time I show up, Postino has my back. 

I've been to this location twice: once for a group lunch on the patio and once with a friend for brunch. Both times were excellent. 

Deal: They usually have a drink deal of some sort: a small pitcher of beer or a glass of wine for $5 during lunch time, or a glass of bubbly- champagne, prosecco or sparkling rosé for $5 during brunch. My favourite of course, is the bottle of wine and bruschetta for $20. I've only gone to the Tempe location for this deal, however I'm sure it would be awesome here as well given my other experiences at this location. 

Service: I've never had a bad experience here. They were attentive, but not overbearing. 

Food: I want to give whoever created this menu a big hug. They basically use all my favorite ingredients in all their dishes like pesto, delicious bread, savory meats, artichokes... the list could go on forever. For lunch, I've had their 1/2 sandwich and salad combo. If I'm grabbing lunch with my boyfriend, we can usually split a whole sandwich- they're pretty hefty. 

Brunch yesterday was also delicious. I had the country toast with Italian ham, dijonaise (is that Dijon with mayonnaise?), and gruyere. It had these amazingly fresh tomatoes tossed in pesto. That was by far my favorite part. I wonder if I can just order a bowl of that next time. 

There will be a next time; the question however, is what time of the day it will be."}
{"text":"Warm and romantic ambience for any occasion, Postino offers a plethora of bruschetta and Panini to feed your carb need.  The servers are extremely knowledgeable and this spot has a wide selection of carefully selected wines for the true wine aficionado."}
{"text":"One of the best spots in Phoenix. Great atmosphere, great music, great food and reasonable prices. No need to be a wine snob to appreciate this place. Bruschetta is a must as is valet usually."}
{"text":"Delicious as far as the food goes, but I much prefer the ambiance of the location in Arcadia."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem in Phoenix! The food was delicious. Absolutely loved the butcher block appetizer (name?). It featured killer goat cheese and hard cheese, nuts, olives, hummus, bread and the assorted meats. Rare to have that much variety. 

Loved my salad- one with corn and bacon? Fabulous. Also my fiancé really enjoyed the sausage broth soup which was so flavorful. Great experience & so reasonable! bar area for seating was very comfortable and beautiful outdoor seating with a fire pit is also featured. We had a bottle of cava- can't go wrong here!!"}
{"text":"Tuesday nights can't go wrong. But don't try to find a parking spot. Great place for a date!"}
{"text":"absolutely love this place. It is a fru-fru hang out joint that isn't pretentious. 

The cucumber lemonade has become my favorite non-alcoholic drink and their bruschetta is always the best!"}
{"text":"Salami and Pesto Bruschetta is awesome. I like going during the week like Wednesday because its a little less hectic. Love it but Postino's gets mad crowded.  If you go for Sunday Brunch send someone ahead to get the table it will prevent angry hungry friends."}
{"text":"WOW!!!! I wish i could add 5 more stars on to this Yelp. Today at work we ordered from Postino's, for lunch and we had a missing sandwich. We called to tell them this and not only did one of the employee's bring us a refund, but he also brought us the sandwich and a gift card!! postino's you rock!! customer service like no other. thank you, thank you from The Root Salon!!"}
{"text":"The bruschetta here is seriously wonderful. I try to avoid gluten so I tried the gluten free bread tonight and it was fabulous! I would definitely recommend the prosciutto and fig as well as the warm artichoke - they are so good. It's a fun wine selection and a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Postino Arcadia is absolutely one of my favorite restaurants in the valley. The wine list is diverse and if you having trouble choosing, just ask your server. The bruschetta is amazing and an absolute must have. 

When you go, valet....it's definitely $3 well spent. That way, you can get into Postino's faster to grab a seat. 

You really can't go wrong with the Prosciutto and Brie Sandwich, along with the Mixed Green Salad - I'd love to say that I try something different each time, but I can't waver from that. It's truly fantastic. 

This is a great place for a date night, and if you haven't been there......go. Now. Just expect to wait for awhile, they're always busy. But trust me ,it's well worth it!

Oh, and a tip? They have a special Monday and Tuesday nights after 8:00pm....a board of bruschetta and a bottle of wine. WIN :-)"}
{"text":"I love Postino.  How can you not?  I love the $5 glasses of wine before 5:00.  I love the staff.  Tell them what you like and they make the most perfect recommendations.  And nothing beats the bruschetta- I get cravings for that stuff.  The whole staff rocks at this location.  Very different (and better) vibe than Central."}
{"text":"bruschetta = YUM!!! the mixed plate of bruschetta is the best you'll get in town. it is just a palette full of so much flavor. just this plate alone can fill you up for lunch, but if not....their raspberry chicken salad will. it is the best salad i've had in my life! seriously....it's to DIE for. mmm...

i've only frequented during lunch hour, but this place is just classy dining in a really casual atmosphere. the architecture and design of the space is sparse and industrial, yet it's not cold. the parking is shared with la grande so it can be pretty daunting to find a spot, but just save yourself the hassle and valet."}
{"text":"I try to like you Postinos, I really do but you make it so hard.  Came on a Tuesday for their 8 PM $20 Bottle of wine and bruschetta special and left disappointed and annoyed.

The parking lot disaster strikes again!  LGO now put up signs saying 25 min parking for LGO customers only and has a lot monkey stationed to chase away people trying to park in those spaces.  I was told by the lot monkey that I could valet ($3 charge) or I could park 3 blocks away if I didn't want to pay the fee.  Keep in mind this is a Tuesday and I have to pay to park my car because the restaurant blocks off all the spaces.

Once seated my friend and I tried to catch up for a moment when the server came over to take our drink orders.  Since we had just sat down we asked for some time to take a look at the menu.  Our server came back a few minutes later and asked if we were ready to order.  No suggestions on a wine, no questions if we had questions, just \"you ready to order?\"

We ordered a bottle and bruschetta and our waiter disappeared.  For the rest of the night.  I watched him refill wine glasses at other tables, ours was brought by another server.  Other tables had their plates cleared when they were finished, ours sat in front of us until another server took them away.  Our server obviously didn't want our business because about an hour after we sat down he came back to the table and asked if we were interested in any dessert.  We said no and he immediately dropped the check on the table and left.  No offer of another round of drinks, just here is your check.

The wine we had was amazing and was a steal at the price plus the bruschetta.  The bruschetta themselves were half assed.  3 of the 4 weren't even sliced all the way through but over all they were decent.

Yet again Postinos shows they want my money but not my patronage.  I don't understand how I am the only one who keeps having horrible experiences here?"}
{"text":"I really, really adore this place. I love it like whoa. The bruschetta is akin to heaven on a thick slice of bread. No but seriously - it's amazing, and it will ruin you for any other restaurant's interpretation of bruschetta. Period. I did have to ding one star simply for the fact that this place is impossible to get into during any time of any day, and they will not take reservations for groups under 8-10 people. The service here is great, beer/wine selection is wonderful, and it's a great atmosphere. LOVE that they offer valet, or else parking would be an absolute nightmare."}
{"text":"Busy, cool little place here. Cozy decor and atmosphere with a European feel, great place to share a bottle of wine and sample some of the many bruschettas.  Food is great here but menu is short and  would appreciate some options with a bit more substance.  Prices are good and Hoegaarden on tap is superb.  No reservations here so arrive early."}
{"text":"On a Monday/Tuesday night, if you time it right, Postino's is a neighborhood staple in Arcadia. The $20 for a bottle and board of bruschetta is a *steal*. As one of employee said, \"How could you not order this?\" while we waited for our table.  

My friend and I arrived early to request a table for four. Perched on a tall side table we enjoyed a full view of the restaurant. Sipping not so daintily we quickly passed the 45 minute wait.  

Once seated Bethany was a wonder. Our bill was seamlessly transferred and waters arrived. The neat thing about traveling in a pack of four is that, Yes, You Can drink three bottles of wine. What could possibly be better than that? It removes the need to think hard about the bruschetta menu. (There are 12 options so we had one of each brought out.)

We surprised the fella in the group. He doubted that three bruschetta boards would be sufficient to feed his hungry belly. If you haven't been before, a bruschetta is palm sized and sliced into four pieces. Trust me, there's plenty. 

But if you're still hungry this is a wine bar and they have food. The panini selection is wonderful, I beg to argue the Nine Iron is the best.  (Bacon layered with grilled chicken, burrata mozzarella, lettuce, beefsteak tomato and dijonnaise!) Another approach, perhaps on another visit, is to order the Butchers Block (big assortment of meat and cheese) for $14 and/or the Cheese Board for $13.

If for some reason wine is not up your alley, Postino's offers pitchers of beer. If you need to drink a cocktail...suck it up kid. That's not happening here. The Mon/Tue special begins at 8pm. I'd recommend scoring a table before the start time, even if that means buying some appetizers beforehand. 

Make sure to ask for Bethany! She's the sweetest thing!"}
{"text":"We stopped here last night and glad we did.  The choice of four bruschetta was awesome loved them all white bean, artichoke, burrata and mozzarella. My glass of Manifesto Zin was really good as well.  A nicely appointed restaurant that I would frequent more given the chance."}
{"text":"Fantastic place!!! Helpful hint beer pitchers & wine are $5 everyday 11-5!!! The food is really amazing and fresh! VALET IS RUDE and semi lost the keys and gave a sour look that we \"only\" tipped them $4 bucks after all that. So I would not suggest valet. Although I don't believe they are associated with the restaurant I think they are outsourced. The tomato jam is great! The iron skillet sandwich and all the bruschetta and mixed green salads are great. I didn't get a chance to try the Cream Brulé because I was overly stuffed but, that's next. They also had a cute brunch menu and since I do love a good brunch I will check them out."}
{"text":"I am such a fan of this place. Husband  (who is more fried food and french fries sort of guy ) took me as a surprise for a date night. WHOLY AWESOMENESS.  Great GREAT brushetta (Even the husband liked it) and a great wine menu. I think I ordered everything that was remotely vegetarian. DELICIOUS. Seriously. I hear there is one in my neck of the woods (Ahwatukee).. can't wait to visit."}
{"text":"Love this place! The bruschetta is the best in town by far. On Mondays and Tuesday's you get a board of bruschetta and a bottle of wine for $20! This place is great is fun day and night. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Maybe it's the wide-open garage doors, the friendly service, the abundant wine selection, the clean, modern room, or it's the convivial crowd... Postino has all of those, true. But come on, people - IT'S ALL ABOUT THE BRUSCHETTA! Holy cow - what delicious topping combinations! Ricotta w/dates & pistachios. Prosciutto w/figs & mascarpone. I could go on... 

Great time here - my two small complaints were (1) the sauvignon blanc by the glass is one of those \"SB w/semillon\" concoctions - not our fave by a long shot, and (2) i like my bread a bit crispier for bruschetta, but understand it's a house style.

When next in Phoenix, we'll be back."}
{"text":"Great location in Arcadia and symbolic of Arcadia itself! Looking forward to my next visit as the last one was much fun :)"}
{"text":"Service here is snooty.  We came on a busy night but the hostess was a bit rude and told us there were no tables despite being able to see many open tables.  If I was Johnny Depp I bet there was a table for me.  There are other places that actually want your money.  Skip this one."}
{"text":"Ok, so it was kind of funny. I have a friend in visiting from out of town and her parents are here also visiting family. So on Wednesday night I decided to take her to Postino, because I went to the one on Central and loved the food (hated the service, but the food was great). So I took her to this location. Much better! The place was way less busy (i guess that's because it wasn't one of their special nights) and we were seated right away. We even found parking over by LGO. Whoa. So, anyway, We shared a bruschetta board with the brie and apple, the goat cheese and bell pepper, burrata and bacon, and prosciutto and mascarpone and we each got a glass of wine. (I got the Haart riesling.... *drool* that has got to be one of the best rieslings I have had). So the bruschetta was good, I thought the goat cheese one was not all I had hoped for, but the apple and brie was wonderful and so was the burrata and bacon... I think burrata is my new favorite cheese.... that stuff is good! Anyway, it  was a nice night and everything was fine. So fast forward to the next day. I went with my friend and her parents to the botanical gardens and then we were going to get lunch, so I list a bunch of places we can go and they decide they want to go to LGO (Now I've never been there but really want to try their pizza, it looks amazing). So we get there and realize A) there is no table service and B) there is no pizza. Lame. So my friend says.... we could go back to postino..... haha! So we ended up going again! two days in a row. 

So the second time we all got paninis and salads (and wine.... yum and 5$). I got the half and half with the turkey panini and the italian picnic salad. The turkey sandwich was pretty good, it had tomato, greens, pesto, and provolone on it. It tasted good, but nothing too special. The italian picnic salad was also just ok. I couldn't taste the vinaigrette that's supposed to be on it at all... maybe they forgot to put it on... or maybe it is ridiculously light. The other ingredients were good, it had beets, greens, goat cheese, walnuts, and some crispy things in it. My friend got the prosciutto sandwich, which I tried and it was delicious. Her dad got the nine iron which looked really good. Anyway, this was not as good an experience as the night before, but it evens out to four stars. Yay postino!"}
{"text":"Love the food. Great food and great location. Some parking issues...but the valet made that problem go away."}
{"text":"Stopped in last night with some coworkers for their bottle & board deal which takes place Mon/tues.  Took about a half hour to get our party seated but well worth it. $20 gets you a bottle of house wine (from a pretty extensive list) and a bruschetta board...you are able to choose any 4 off of their amazing list! We had a great time. Fun ambiance, cool art, and nice staff."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with a girlfriend last week and I have one thing to say:

Errmahgerd, the bruschetta.

I can be pretty picky when it comes to quality of food while I'm dining out. If I'm paying for it... I want it to be good. Anytime I visit Postino it never disappoints! Great atmosphere and delicious wine. Plus friendly service and fresh food. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Amazing bruschetta!! This place keeps their menu simple and done right: wine, bruschetta, and a few choice salads and sides. Monday and Tuesday they offer any bottle of wine and a board of bruschetta (any four choices) for $20. It's an outstanding deal and very worth it. Highly recommended bruschetta options include: the fig, mascarpone, and prosciutto; the bacon and buratta; the smoked salmon and pesto; and the roasted red pepper and goat cheese. 

Additionally, while their Monday and Tuesday deal (and the bruschetta generally) is what they are known for, their brunch is also top notch. I absolutely love the BELT breakfast sandwich and the farm scramble. Outstanding. 

I prefer the downtown Phoenix location myself, but both offer lovely indoor and outdoor seating, trendy vibes, good group space, and attentive knowledgeable service. I no longer live in the area but always make a point of coming when I'm in town.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I have to say, I DO like their food and the service is always pretty good. The atmosphere is great. HOWEVER, making reservations there is a different story. 

They only take reservations for 10 or more. I had 7...

My grandparents are in town, and can't really \"wait at the bar\" until a table is ready. They are old and tired. Hence, I tried to make reservations here, called 24 hours in advance... they told mebthey couldnt do it, but  to come in anyway and 'wait at the bar' for a table. I told them I was going to be with some older people, and asked if there was anyway we could just call in 20 minutes beforehand and put our name on the list, so my grandparents wouldnt have to stand at the bar. They said they didnt do that. Seeing as it THE EXACT SAME THING as coming in to put my name on the list and wait twenty minutes there, I dont see the problem. I asked them politely if they could make an exception considering the situation... they said absolutely not. Where I come from, restaurants will try everything they are capable of to accommodate their guests. This IS NOT what Postino's or the LGO owners do at any of their restaurants. After talking to Postino's, I tried Chelsea's and LGO and got the same answer.

I also tried Chelsea's, which takes reservations for less then 10 but got the same story, they were booked and we could wait. Also asked them about calling in when we were on our way b/c I was with two older people who could not stand long... they said no way.

I own two restaurants, I can tell you-- this is not appropriate customer service. Its also not very moralistic. If a frequent customer explains a situation, seeking a little help, and its not ridiculous, the restaurant shoud be happy to do it. 

Seems as if the LGO owners have taken a cue from Houston's... which is the type of place that gives Scottsdale a bad reputation. The type of service that scares out-of-towners away from Arizona because we are too \"snooty.\""}
{"text":"There aren't many places in the valley that make me feel I am somewhere unique and 'non-chain' but this is one of them. Yes sometimes the service can be a little off but when this place has it's game on ... it's ON! The wine list is always interesting giving you choices that surprise and please, the food is well priced and the brew-shetta (Geordie accent please) is ridiculously good.
I should give this 4 stars as the service can be hit and miss but I gave it 5 for those great nights with friends when the music is loud but not too loud, the wine is flowing and a good time is being had by all!"}
{"text":"Postino - $5 pitcher's of Odell IPA.   What more needs be said?

A great reuse of a 1950's post office with a perfect menu while enjoying a glass of wine or the aforementioned pitcher of beer.  My wife and I lingered her over two lunches on a recent vacation and even stopped by for a quick drink on the way to the airport; couldn't get enough of this place's charm.

The bonus is its location - across from La Grande Orange Bakery which is also super cool and Radio Milano across the street.  Anyone living in this neighborhood better realize how lucky they are."}
{"text":"ok, really guys. Stop reading this review. If a f*cking place has over 400 hundred reviews AND is able to hold a standing of over 4 stars...its a good place! Don't have to read any further! You know what, since you are still reading this, i am just going to end my review now!"}
{"text":"Yum!  So good, great service and food came quickly despite being really busy during lunch.  We loved it!  Salads are great and you can't miss the bruschetta!"}
{"text":"Sometimes you have to wait  a little bit, and you have to valet (but its right in front!) since you wont find parking, it is all so worth it. Very cute, everyone is so friendly and makes sure you are taken care of. They have a great wine list which they change frequently and the best part about postino is.. the bruschetta!! Have to get the apple, fig and brie cheese, I am serious!!"}
{"text":"Maybe I'm too old, too jaded, too experienced, or too cheap, but Postino doesn't float my boat or make me feel like I've spent my money and my time well. 
 The only friend I have that LOOOOOOVVVVEEEEESSS (you get the point)  this retaurant is currently filing for bankruptcy.  Hmmmm.


I brought a gentleman friend here, we sat on the patio, and ordered bruschetta and drinks.
The wine was corky and very acidic, and two of the bruschetta were not pleasurable.

Then the mosquitoes arrived.  Hoards.  A military platoon of mosquitoes on a mission to EAT US ALIVE.

I talked to the server about the problem and she might as well have been a stuffed dress dummy for all the help she was--she didn't even offer to move us inside.

Wayyyyy too much moola handed over for less than stellar service and very 3 star food.

Second visit was a daytime weekend for wine and nibbles.

I tried several wines, only one was good.  I don't think they store it properly. 
 Becketts Table is the place to go for a good glass of wine.

Again, a very high bill for a low satisfaction quotent."}
{"text":"Great experience! Friendly valet and staff and a wonderful happy hour. $5 glasses of wine were the best part! The bruschetta platter can't be beat! A great place for happy hour or a light lunch with friends."}
{"text":"This location is the original Postino and they are definitely doing something right. The food is excellent and they are almost always busy. 

If you're unsure of what to order, you can't go wrong with a bruschetta board. You get to pick four different types for one board. Get are great for sharing and you can't beat the price. Their raspberry chicken salad is incredible. It has a lot of flavor and isn't drove in mayonnaise. There are a number of sandwiches and salads that you can mix and match during lunchtime. 

If you're looking for a beer or glass of wine, you can get one for only $5 before 5 p.m.  It's a great spot to meet friends and they have a nice outdoor patio that is great most of the year. Just remember it can get a bit noisy."}
{"text":"I don't eat here, but I get take out every couple of months. I love the pizzeria salad, or whatever it's called. 
I ALWAYS bring home a slice of the red velvet cake, too. It turns my poop red, so I know it's the real deal.
This place is always busy, so you can't be an impatient Nancypants when you go. 
While you are waiting, you can do some shopping and find some cool specialty foods."}
{"text":"Heck yes! This place is amaze-balls USA population wine :)

I love going to this joint! Monday and Tuesday night specials with a board of bruschetta and bottle of wine... who could ask for more?!"}
{"text":"What a great place for Sunday brunch. It was packed and the wait was about 30 minutes but worth it. I like the feel of the restaurant, it was chic and laid back. We were seated at a table by the open double doors leading outside to the patio. They're popular for their bruschettas so I opted for a trial. I got an order of four: salami and pesto, smoke salmon, prosciutto, and dates and pistachios. The best was salami and pesto. I could eat that all day, in fact I make it occasionally at home after having it here. Need to find an place in my area that has these."}
{"text":"Great location and the bruschetta is amazing. If you can go for happy hour the wine and bruschetta combo for $20 is as good as it can get.  May I recommend the Malbec. The only downside to this location is the the music is louder inside so an intimate conversation would be difficult unless your on the patio. However I will continue to come back over and over again!"}
{"text":"I went here with my girlfriends on a weekday at lunch time, and we were seated right away. The wine recommendations were excellent, and the food was great. I ordered the tomato and mozzarella as an entree, and it was delicious. My friends ordered a variety of food from salads to sandwiches, and we were all impressed. Great experience!"}
{"text":"I love postinos and I come here often but today I am not impressed. The food was delicious as always but our server was great but the way the host talked to us was not acceptable! I asked for a table for 5, they took us to a table for 4 and just moved a chair over but did not bring a 5th chair. After 5min or so of waiting for it I asked if they were going to bring another chair and some guy responds, with attitude, \"yea we are working on it, I have other things I need to do first!\" And I said \"okay thank you!\" After another 5min they pushed a table against ours, which we were please with. But as he was doing it he looked at me and said \"is there enough chairs here now?!\" And proceeded to roll his eyes! Im sorry but I think that is just flat out rude!! Luckily our server was extremely nice and made the experience a little better."}
{"text":"Came to this location back in March and was very disappointed with the service. First off it was extremely cold in the restaurant for some reason and when we asked if the air could be turned off or get moved the server just kind of laughed it off and didn't take us seriously. That already left a bad taste in my mouth. Second they server was not very accommodating... My dad asked if he could sub a soup for a salad and she flat out said no. Would not even check or anything. We were willing to pay a bit more for a sub but no she didn't care. Finally when we actually got our food the bread for the sandwiches and bruschetta were so stale and old. I don't usually write bad reviews but this time I was beyond unsatisfied and this was after talking up this restaurant to my dad visiting from out of town. Will probably just stick to the Tempe or Central locations from now on."}
{"text":"Gotta love Postino`s!! Everytime I come here, great service!! Love the brushetta and cheese plate, plenty for two,even three people!! And yes, love the wine selections!"}
{"text":"I like Postino. I don't find it amazing. I like that it's cheap, and the food tastes good. I don't think their menu is very unique, but their wine list is nice. I usual order one of their 'exclusive' wines and I'm always happy. 
I wish it wasn't always so insanely busy here. I know that it's a good thing, and shows that they're doing something right. But, honestly, waiting for 45 min on a Wednesday night to sit at an awkward ikea coffee table and eat bruschetta doesn't always sound so appealing to me. 
The service is usually pretty pathetic. Although there is one woman that works here that is awesome. She's always friendly and attentive and somehow always remembers my boyfriend and I. Every other server I have had here is awkward and unfriendly. 
So, to wrap things up: this place is pretty good, but there is room for improvement."}
{"text":"Great finger food! Reasonable prices for the quality. Nice ambiance! My wife was happy and she is a tough food critic (8 out 10 restaurants FAIL)!"}
{"text":"Best place to take out-of-towners. I wish I still lived a half mile from this place but alas, I moved away. My roomie and I would bike here regularly. They have great 1/2 off wine bottle specials on Sundays. Postino is responsible for many Monday morning headaches :)"}
{"text":"I lived within walking distance of Postino for 5 years - and it is still one of my favorite Arcadia neighborhood spots.  The wine list is always changing and is really well picked.  Their bruschetta boards are fantastic - I especially recommend the pistachio/date or the Prosciutto/fig.  Their salted caramel desert sunday is totally worth leaving room for!  This is a great place for a get together with friends or an intimate date night.  The service is always great and everyone who works there really knows their wine - so you can get advice from your server on which wines will meet your tastes each month when the new list comes out.  Brent's Picks are always a safe way to choose your wine also!  Love Love Love Postino!"}
{"text":"Can you really ever go wrong with really good wine and really really fun bruschetta? The answer is no.... local spot but expanded and still keeps everything delicious. Another place where the customer service is always so good and friendly."}
{"text":"I thought I just reviewed his place let me do it again we stopped in for wine in a Balenie and extensive appetizer menu was almost daunting we finally decided to build our own bruschetta and very delivered product was unbelievable I'll be back"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place to meet up with my friends.  We enjoy the atmosphere, the food is delish and the wine is always great.  Love they happy hour prices too!"}
{"text":"I loved this place! We are big fans of Walt Richardson and his music first of all, and he was playing today. But, add in delicious tapas (really fresh-loved all of our choices, especially goat cheese and fig) for a wonderful experience. I tasted my friend's $5 Sunday white Sangria and had to have one of my own. There were blackberries, strawberries, raspberries, lemon, etc. in it, and it was super good!! The atmosphere was trendy. Next time we'd like to try to reserve the couch for seating in front of the entertainment. Very cool."}
{"text":"Now that I actually do live in the hood, it's time to revise. What's up neighbor?! That's how I feel now when I stop by for a glass of vino. Maybe they don't know me that well, but they do seem to recognize my dog. She's actually why this place gets an extra star - super dog friendly patio. Bowl of water and constant affection from the staff every time my hound comes along. She's spoiled here and it make me happy.

Food is still fabulous and the wine...Oh the wine. How I crave that Garnacha when I'm anywhere else. There really is no time that's not good to be here, but I love lounging outside on week nights when it's not quite as busy. I always meet fun people here that are also soaking up the good vibes. I officially can never move away from Arcadia."}
{"text":"I had went there for dinner with a friend one night.  Being the art student I am, I soaked up the surroundings instantly.  The place was artsy with a vast amount of windows.  The overall atmosphere of the place was brilliant.  Any where that allows you to eat on modern and comfy couches by candlelight is definitely a fantastic place!

My friend and I shared the brushetta sampler [Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato & Basil, Tuscan Tuna with Gaeta Olives, Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone, and Salami with Pesto].  The bruschetta was delicious.  It was baked to perfection!

For two light-eaters like my friend and me, that filled us up quick!  But what's a cozy dinner without dessert?  We shared a classic vanilla crème brulee and it was so creamy and wonderful.  

I definitely recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Lovely place in Central Phoenix, very well decorated with walls of bottles of wine. I love their bruschetta special. You get to chose 4 different types. The prosciutto and figs stole my heart! Very good selection of wine, I loved their Verdicchio from Italy, nice and crispy white. Recommended for dinner and late snack time!!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh.  $20 for a full bottle of wine (the Malbec choice is spectacular), plus four bruschetta?  That's a steal of a deal.  Come here on Monday or Tuesday evening for the special!  We came with some friends (who are frequent Postino-ers) and had a great time.  The restaurant is classy enough for a date but chill enough for going out for post-work drinks.  My favorite bruschetta were the Brie&Apples w/ Fig, the Smoked Salmon w/ Pesto, the Roasted Pepper w/ Goat Cheese, the Tomato Jam & Fresh Sheep's Milk Cheese, and the Seasonal (currently some sort of delicious pear mint flavor).  I just realized that I listed almost every single bruschetta we tried.  It's that good.  Even better, each piece is cut into 4 slices, so you can easily share with friends.

Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I will admit I have only been on Monday and Tuesday nights and some may be mad that I'm sharing this secret spot but its always been a good experience. Monday and Tuesday nights they have a bottle of wine and Bruschetta special for $20 bucks. I would guess about 20-30 wines to pick from that regularily range between 20-40 bucks (of course still 10 bucks in a grocery store) and four servings of bruscetta with about  8 or 9 different choices. They have live music on weekends and I've heard its packed on sunday afternoons as well. They offer valet parking and free parking on the streets and nearby parking lot. Service is great keep in mind you may be waiting on monday tuesday nights 30-45 minutes for a table if you come in before 9."}
{"text":"I've been to Postino Arcadia so many times, I'm not sure what has taken me so long to review it.  I love, love, love this place!  Especially between 12pm and 5pm when all all glasses of wine are just $5 each (even on the weekends)!  They don't have it on the menu, but they do have moscato d'asti for all those who like sweet and fizzy wines! :)  The bellinis are delish, with lots of yummy peach puree waiting for you like a treat at the bottom of the glass.  The bruschetta is ALWAYS on point!  My favorites are the smoked salmon with pesto and the tomato jam with sheepsmilk cheese.  DELISH!  For dessert, they have a salted caramel sundae with fresh, homemade salted caramel!  If you're a fan of salted caramel, you will absolutely LOVE this!  I haven't yet made it out on Sunday to try the sangria and listen to the reggae, but I plan on doing so soon!  Also, one might expect this place to be a trendy, hipster kind of place, with a snooty clientele, but it's not like that at all.  Very low key and laid back."}
{"text":"Postino Winecafe remains very close to my heart. In a foodie way, too.

My boyfriend and I came here on a hot humid Thursday night. The lightings were great to bring a date or to catch up with a friend and there were fairly good amount of room noise to keep your conversation on the privacy level. The service was just lovely. Oh, the little \"Gum\" note-card was utterly cute. You can either spit your gum on the note-card or exchange phone numbers. :)

The first time I visited Postino, I wanted to come back for more of their bruschettas. My boyfriend and I shared the various bruschetta platter: 
1. Brie & Apples with Fig Spread - He quickly picked this because the first time he had it became his favorite and was confident that I would absolutely love it, and I did -- I loved the sweet taste of the fig with the crunchiness of the apples. yummm! The composition of the brie, apples and fig gives this bruschetta a sweet taste.
2. Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato & Basil - Since we had 3 more bruschetta options to pick, we went for something light and simple. Everything was fresh! The combination of the mozzarella, tomato and basil was simple yet blended wonderfully together. 
3. Smoked Salmon with Pesto - This was probably my least favorite out of the four, but it was okay. Although the capers were mouth bursting with favors -- which was delish, but it didn't do much justice for the slight fishy taste of the smoked salmon.
4. Ricotta with Dates and Pistachios - By the end of the night, he declared that this became our favorite bruschetta, evar! I think they toasted the dates a bit or something of that sort, but it was perfect. The pistachios weren't dry and the ricotta wasn't an overload. All three components made it tasted like sweet heaven in your mouth. When I think of bruschetta, I immediately think savory, but there's nothing wrong with a dessert bruschetta, right? I think not. The texture of this was just perfect. No complaints here!

He and I tend to order enough to feed 4 hungry men when we dine out. So we also called for the Panini -- the Vegetarian Panini on ciabatta to be exact. We had the side salad with crumb goat cheese. Meh, I didn't care much for this panini, maybe because I was already full off of the tasty bruschettas!


There's a $3 charge for Valet. But it's all worth it!
I am definitely coming back for their bruschettas once I fly out there."}
{"text":"There were 5 of us and the restaurant was pretty full except outside or a huge booth. We sat outside and quickly realized our Alaskan friend and our Boston friend were melting! Hostess moves us to the booth and then we saw the end of the bar with 5 seats open up and move again. Totally realizing we're being difficult, we apologized a bunch and the staff was cool about it. We had the special which is AMAZING! On mon tues they have a bruscetta board and any bottle of house wine for 20 bucks! 20 BUCKS! The board alone is 15. This is a fantastic deal! They also have gluten free bread which was great for Boston. We also got the Bounty which had a ton of fresh veggies (cauliflower, brussels, carrots, radishes) that were grilled and an almond hummus and some spicy almonds. Really great. Alaska got a mixed green salad with pears, grapes and crunchy leaks and a poppy seed dressing. She loved it! Two girls opted to get another glass ($9 each)but didnt realize that we could take the rest of the bottle home and the bruschetta! The bartender really went above and beyond to do this. We asked her after she brought the for the 2 glasses and she'd originally said no but made it happen eventually. My only complaint was the gf bruschetta was soft and my bread tasted a little stale and it was super loud. There really is no reason to have music up that high. Its a wine bar, where people like to hear eachother talk not a club. Its always ridiculously loud. We totally had a nice time and that bartender (thinner blond girl) was pretty cool!"}
{"text":"The bruschetta is the best ever; you must go on a monday or tuesday night when they do a \"bottle and a board for $20\"!! You get 4 different types of bruschetta and a bottle of wine for $20!! It's SUCH a great deal. There is always a great selection of wines, esp BTG, and some beers as well. 

At times service can be a bit slow and inattentive; sometimes it takes a bit to get water refills and occasionally drinks take a bit of time. However, this place is rockin' and there's a wait for tables for a REASON. It's a great neighborhood place and somewhere I ALWAYS made sure to go when I was in town visiting during a 2+ year period of living out of state. LOVE THIS PLACE."}
{"text":"I come here every time I am in Pheonix! The atmosphere is great and the so is the food and wine. My all time fave is the bruschetta. I would defiantly recommend the goat cheese bruschetta."}
{"text":"Has got to be one of my favorite restaurants. Monday and Tuesday when you are there at or after 8-close, It is $20 bucks for a bottle of wine and your choice of four different slices of their bruschetta. 

The Chicken and Mozzarella Panini is one of my favorites.

You can easily have a dinner for two, including an app, two entree's and a bottle of wine for well under $60.

Be aware that there WILL be about an hour wait for this quaint little restaurant. However, in the same center is a place called La Grande Orange that you can grab a decent bottle of wine at while waiting for your table. As well when you do that they validate your valet parking ($3) not including a tip. 

Valet is a must usually around this spot since the parking is quite horrible. But when you expect it, you should not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love everything! Mon + Tues night specials are very much worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Nice location with delicious food, though the service was a little slow. The staff was friendly and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good but I hate going to places like this because there is a huge echo and you can barely hear the people you're with. I've had their catering though- a much better experience."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant, with a friendly staff. Extensive selection of wine, and reasonably priced beer. I'm a big fan of the happy hour specials.

The bruschetta is delicious. My personal favorite is red bell peppers with goat cheese. I really like that you can pick for different toppings for a single serving - it's a great way to sample all the different types of bruschetta. The bellinis are also really good if you're not in a beer or wine mood.

I really need to go back and try more of the menu. Can't wait!"}
{"text":"Postino's $20 wine and bruschetta board special cannot be beat!

As far as the bruschetta goes I think the brie, apples, and fig is my favorite. I am a sucker for any dish that successfully combines sweet & savory!

Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato & Basil is delicious as well as the ricotta with dates & pistachios. 

I also LOVE their NY grilled cheese and the mustard, ketchup and pesto sauces they provide you with for dipping. So yummy!

Parking at this location is somewhat of a PITA but that's typical Arcadia. The restaurant itself always has a great vibe and good service. I would likely give another star if their brunch options were just a bit more robust. The farm scramble is very tasty, but not having omlettes, pancakes, OR waffles on the menu is a serious FAIL."}
{"text":"Oh Postino, how I miss thee. I moved to Washington but every time I go back to Arizona, I always make time to stop at Postino! This place just makes my heart happy. The atmosphere makes me feel like one of the cool kids & even though the wait times during prime times can be bad, it's worth the wait. Trust me.

Some of my favorite bruschetta's are: smoked salmon w/ pesto and capers, prosciutto with figs and mascarpone, ricotta with dates and pistachio and the salami and pesto. If you're feeling frisky, try the nine iron panini and raspberry chicken salad. 

Service has always been great & although I've tried 3 of the 4 Postino's in the valley, I'd say even though Arcadia is smaller in size, it's the best one.

I have dreams and that dream would be for a Postino to open up in Seattle ;)"}
{"text":"This is the perfect spot to go to with a few friends. Great wine and great food. 

The bruschettas they have are so so good, as well as the sandwiches.

They have a large selection of wine and each glass is only $5.00 each until 5pm -- The staff I have interacted with have all been really nice and helpful.

Some of the people that go there are wannabe foodies and snobs though, use caution. lol"}
{"text":"My husband and I stumbled into (and out of ) this gem. 
The food was amazing and who can resist $5 wine and pitchers. Woot!
Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Ok! I have been here 100 + times and never given Postino a review! All I have to say is Postino's should be on everyone's bucket list of places to try once in your life. Everything on the menu is really good. My favorite of course is the Bruschetta board with all of them except Salmon. Nothing wrong with Salmon , I just don't care for Salmon period, but I'm sure its exquisite.  My husband I split a board with a Mediterranean Salad and Wine . All pairs well with wine or beer . Perfect place to hang out when its nice out which is almost year round."}
{"text":"Once again another wonderful experience at Postino.  The staff was attentive without being intrusive and the bruschetta was delicious.  Be sure to get the Apple, Brie and Fig if you are getting the bruschetta and save it for last.  Also outstanding was the Smoked Salmon with Pesto.
My girlfriend also had a cup of the soup of the moment which was Tomato Basil.  She said it was fantastic.
And of course when discussing an evening at Postino you have to talk about the wine.  The selection is amazing and the staff is knowledgeable about the selection without being pretentious like I've seen in similar places.  If you are intimidated by the selection or just don't know what you would like they will be able to assist you with finding the perfect match for your meal and your tastes."}
{"text":"I take out-of-town-ers here for sure.  Always a hit.  I look forward to the growth of these types of establishments in phoenix.  IE: Renovation / reuse of historical phoenix architecture, combined with tasty, unique menu concepts.  It feels good to enjoy a nice meal in surroundings other than a strip mall.

And they have 5 dollar glasses of wine even on the weekend, 11 - 4 pm.  

Who can can argue with that."}
{"text":"I will start off by saying the actual wine and food is decent, but the experience was absolutely horrific.  The food an wine saved this from being a 1 star in my book.

Strike 1: We got there, and it was a pretty packed.  I was a little astonished to pay $3 for valet.  I am not opposed to valet, but I like my options of free parking and valet.  Usually, you get your parking validated when you dine in the restaurant.  

Strike 2: We had a party of 7, and majority of our party was there.  We have been waiting for 1.5 hours, and the hostess told us that it would look bad to seat us.  We were waiting more than anyone in line!

Strike 3: I asked for no cheese on my salad, and I got a buttload of cheese!

Strike 4: It felt like it was 90 degrees in there.  With the kind of money their business makes, they can keep the A/C at 80 at least!

Strike 5: The tomatoes on the bruschetta tasted kind of frozen or 2-3 days old.

I know there are a lot of great reviews, but I had a pretty bad experience."}
{"text":"Time to share some opinions here that the majority might not agree with...

Sandra Bullock is a horrible actress

High School was NOT the best time of my life

Postino Winecafe does not live up to the hype

...while I write this, I of course realize that most people sadly somehow enjoy Sandra Bullock films, think High School was a blast, and...at least according to the reviews on Yelp, adore Postino Winecafe. 

The food is decent enough...bruschetta was flavorful (although on our last visit the bread was a little hard) and the Pub Board appetizer is amazing. The main gripe we have with this place is the service. Do you have to spend a lot of money on alcohol or look like a hipster here to get good service or what? We went for a light meal...nothing more. I don't see a sign on the door that says 'must buy wine', so why did our waiter treat us like a couple of vagrants while he was overly friendly to tables around us who were spending more money? I get it...higher bill, higher tip...this is no excuse for bad service though. A paying customer is a paying customer. The disparity in service couldn't have been more painfully obvious, and that's a shame. Maybe we went on an off night...or maybe Postino is getting cocky...who knows?

We had a decent meal, but left feeling like outsiders instead of valued guests. Maybe next time if I wear a 'deep V-neck' and Katrina wears some 'jeggings', we'll appear wealthier and get better service. Eh.

3.25/5."}
{"text":"My favorite place!!  Bruschetta is amazing and I love the Italian Picnic salad.  Service is always great."}
{"text":"I just moved to Scottsdale about 2 months ago, and this is by far the best place my friends could have brought us to. The ambiance and music were super cool, the food was beyond amazing. We got the butchers block, and the bruschetta sampler of 4 and we paired it with a nice bottle of wine. Over all a great experience, wish I could give it a 10!"}
{"text":"Mandatory valet parking. Stuffy atmosphere. Mediocre bruschetta (especially for the price). The wine our waitress suggested was the only redeeming part of our experience. If you're in the area, try Ingo's instead."}
{"text":"Postino is an amazing place to chill and relax with good company, good food, and amazing wine. 

We had a nice Friday afternoon lunch outside with a glass a wine, and it was a perfect atmosphere. The Arcadia location makes you feel like you're in a small town rather than a city like Phoenix. 

The cheese board - amazing!"}
{"text":"Always great service, lovely ambience, great wine selection, and appies that can't be beat. The bruschetta is delicious, the meat platter is divine, and the cheese plate delights my palate. Our party of 10 had a very enjoyable evening here with extremely attentive service. I can't ever say 'no' to Postino's. Ever!"}
{"text":"one of my favorite places around!  if you're from around phoenix, you are bound to run into someone you know.  trendy, but you won't feel out of place in jeans like a lot of old town scottsdale places.  like the last reviewer, i highly recommend the bruschetta - it is reason enough to visit postino, even if you hate wine.  
but i really hope that's not the case.
i would have given 5 stars - but it's just so crowded most of the time.
and parking is a disaster."}
{"text":"This place was just okay. . definitely not somewhere I'd see myself frequenting. I feel like I missed some of the charm as my rating is lower than the average.   When you arrive you have no option for parking except to valet. I had a glass of wine.  $10 for a glass of house reisling seemed a little steep for me.  They described a delicious soup option then came back to tell me they were out after I ordered it."}
{"text":"I know I've been to this location before but I guess I have never reviewed it. I went here a couple of weeks ago with a friend from college who was visiting. Fortunately we went in the early afternoon and we were able to take advantage of the amazing happy hour. Of course they are known for their great wine selection but since we are both beer drinkers we split a pitcher and board of bruschetta and were happy as could be."}
{"text":"The food was good.  The service was non-existent.  I'll try another location some time, because I did enjoy the food, but I will never go back to the Arcadia location.  They obviously did not want my business -- or a decent tip."}
{"text":"Love it here!  The bruschetta is amazing! The only thing is the lack of parking and the long waits but I guess more people feel like me. It's worth the wait. Just be sure to have cash on you because they do have valet."}
{"text":"my friend and i used to come here after hiking camelback.  you can't beat an excellent sandwich and sald w a crisp pitcher of beer or sangria.  we love the patio and the atmosphere along w the live musician they have on a sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum.....yum. Love this place! Excellent food, good wine, awesome atmosphere. Perfect for a drink, perfect for a date, perfect for catch up time with a friend. Perfect.

If you don't order the bruschetta, shoot yourself. K don't do that. ALL of them are delicious. DEF pass on the Tuscan bean though (mush), and the Mozz Tom Basil is pretty plain. MY TIP! Order the Chopped Tom and Pesto and ADD mozzerella. BOOM! Soooo good we order double of that everytime. Original...yes and perfection...yes. I could give details on more of the choices, but really ALL of them are wonderful, so order up. And don't worry about their \"Choose 4\" you can do whatever combination you want, pretty much a la carte.

Panini's are awesome for lunch too. LOVE the Chick & Mozz, and if you're up for something a little more rich try the Prosciutto with Brie.

Only a couple small issues. 1. wish they would upate their seasonal more often or rotate some new ones in once in awhile. 2. would like a little more of a selection on their by the glass wine options. 3. add some more Spanish wines por favor!

The set it up is awesome. Clean and open, nice patio seating, cool corner booth table for larger parties. Great music! Contemporary little accents all around. Sometimes a little wait, but no big deal. We're there a couple times a month!"}
{"text":"You know when a movie comes out and EVERYONE is talking about how great it is and when you finally see it you are extremely disappointed and wonder what all the fuss was about? That is what I half expected about Postinos.  Instead, this place EXCEEDED the already high expectations others had set in place for it. 

I came here on a Friday evening a couple of weeks ago after a wine tasting at LGO. It was 6:30-7:00pm and we only waited a couple of minutes for a table. 

It was just me and a girlfriend and since we have the same taste in wine, we decided to order a bottle to share.  We had the RIckshaw Pinot Noir which was delightful.  For food we had the Cheeseboard and the mozzarella and tomato jr.  AMAZING.  I love cheese (as do most wine lovers) and their cheeseboard was delicious.  It features a great variety of cheeses from mild to strong in flavor.  

In my eyes the best combo of foods and flavors is the ever simplistic tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil.  Postinos does it perfecto. Everything is fresh as fresh as can be, my mouth is watering just thinking about it!

I had major food envy when I saw the table next to us get served an impressive plate of Bruschetta.  I will definitely be trying that the next time I come. 

Here is how much I loved this place: I just found out my schedule is changing and I'll be getting off work at 3 instead of 5.  Literally the first thought that popped in my head was \"I can make it to Postino's for their amazing happy hour!\" 

I literally can not wait to go back to this place."}
{"text":"I've seen fellow Yelpers mention how much they love Postino's, and I finally got there! Friends and I met here for wine and light bites before heading to the Zoo Lights. Parking is a pain (I'll park my own car, thankyouverymuch) but after that it was all good. It was a chilly Phoenix night, but the open wall seems to somehow work well -- the outside seating melds nicely into the inside. If the forecast calls for cool temps, I recommend that you bring a light jacket.

All of the staff I encountered were great. The first chick recommended a fabulous red which I enjoyed immensely. When my friends arrived, we had the Pub Board and a couple of Bruschetta boards -- fantastic!!  We had fig and apple, warm artichoke spread, smoked salmon and capers, roasted peppers and goat cheese...just delicious. The pretzels and spicy mustard were the best I've ever had, anywhere. 

The atmosphere and ambiance are close to perfect. I'll definitely bring friends here!"}
{"text":"I came here for a leisurely Friday lunch. The ambience, the food, the wine and the outdoor patio were all amazing! 

I had the Ranga Ranga Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand which was nicely chilled, crisp, light and a refreshing choice for sipping outside on the patio on a beautiful sunny day.   

We chose the cheese board which was not the best I've ever had (although in all fairness I am a cheese snob!!) but definately good and I enjoyed the presentation and the different selection of breads served with it. We also ordered the bruschetta. It was hard narrowing it down to just four as I wanted to try them all. We settled on the following:

Roasted red peppers & goat cheese - My least favorite of the 4. It was good but I would have preferred more goat cheese and less peppers
Fresh mozzarella w/ tomato & basil - Chewy bread, fresh tomatoes, ample basil, yum! 
Smoked salmon w/ pesto & capers - Salmon was fresh, lots of capers, another yum!
Tomato jam & fresh sheeps milk - my absolute favorite! I had to remind myself to share. 

An overall great experience.  I can't wait to return so I can try the rest of the bruschettas!"}
{"text":"Food is incredible, good pricing. No reservations unless you have 8 people but its impossible to get a table for 7 in the evening. Also, the valet only parking is dumb."}
{"text":"Two words:

Prosciutto With Brie on Focaccia Bread.  

Okay, that was a lot more than 2 words, but I don't care.  

It was downright amazing; like my tastebuds were being dry humped by the best sandwich ever invented in the History of the World (Part II)."}
{"text":"Perfect spot for a date or a girls night out! Different wines to choose from and the bartender is great at helping you find something you'll like. Definitely need to order the bruschetta, you get to pick 4 and all of them are amazing so you can't go wrong. The prosciutto and brie panini is absolutely delicious with the fig spread and my favorite salad is the Hannah's field. The service is amazing and everyone is friendly."}
{"text":"I have only gone to Postino during the Monday/Tuesday $20 nights where you get a bottle of wine and choice of 3 bruschettas for the cheap price of $20.  I always order a bottle of moscato d'asti and a trio of Brie & Apples with fig, Prosciutto with figs & mascarpone and Fresh Mozzarella with tomato and basil.  I usually go with a few of my girlfriends and this makes a great meal with fantastic wine and some good gossip. :)  Come early as seats fill up extremely quickly and the wait can get very long.  This deal starts after 8pm."}
{"text":"This is always on my list of spots to visit when I'm in Arizona.  Their bruschettas are amazing and their cheese plates are thoughtfully coordinated and tasty.

Also, they have great deals on Wednesdays if you become a fan of them on Facebook.

The waitstaff is helpful and knowledgeable - they know exactly how often to check in, and how to talk to you about things you might want to try without venturing into \"PUSHY\" territory.

Expect a wait anytime after 5, and all weekend long.  It's never a problem for me, though.  Just imagining that board filled with perfectly topped bruschettas, waiting for me to devour makes the 20-40 minutes infinitely more reasonable..."}
{"text":"The bruschetta is awesome!  I have taken a dozen people there and recommend the apples and brie, fig and marscapone, and proscuitto with dates and pistachios.....sometimes I get it without the proscuitto.  Perfect trendy place to take out of town guests!"}
{"text":"I finally made it to Postino! Nobody ever wanted to go with me and I was finally able to talk my friend into going to the one next to my hair dresser. Arcadia!  

Like I said, I went with a friend for lunch and it was so freaking delicious!

I ordered the Prosciutto with Brie Panini, which includes...

Prosciutto with triple cream brie, fig jam and arugula. I think they spread honey or something else on the bread. 

I would like to say my friend was really hesitant to go because she just didn't like Postino based on past experiences. 

However, she had gone to the location on central, not Arcadia. This info will be important later. Back to my yummy panini. 

I have never been crazy about prosciutto but Brie...one of my fav cheeses. Add sweet fruityness to it and I'm sold! 

Based on the options on the menu this sounded like the best choice for me and I am so glad I know myself so well.

The generous amount of meat combined with the perfect amount of cheese on great bread all brought together with this amazing sweet spread and some healthy greenage. 

I mean it was probably one of the greatest things I have eaten in a long time. 

This was so true that 3 days later I told my husband we are going for lunch as I must eat this sandwich again! This time we went to the central location. 

So not the same. :(

The meat portion was half and the brie was just off and my sandwich was just not spectacular. Hence why I think my friend was against Postino for so long. She had only ever been to central. 

So I highly recommend Postino but I can only recommend the Arcadia location and it's the only one I will go to. Even though it's far for me, it's worth the drive past the central location onto Arcadia. 

Not joking....Amazing! Eat it!"}
{"text":"The food here is incredible!!! If it's your first time you need to order the bruschetta. All of them are good. I also enjoyed their wine selection. This is my favorite restaurant to go to when I'm in Phoenix/Scottsdale"}
{"text":"It's a Postino, which means it is quality.  

I usually go to Postino on Mondays or Tuesdays for the $20 bottle of wine and board of bruschetta deal.  The problem?  So does everyone else!  

At this location, there is often a long wait.  It is not bad in the cooler months, but in the Summer it can be unbearable.  

I've noticed that a good attitude gets you everywhere here.  If you're sour, expect a longer wait.  I don't know that there is a formula to that, but it seems to have rung true on every occasion.  :)

My favorite wine here is their Tempranillo, though honestly I cannot remember the name or the year for the life of me.  

My favorite bruschetta is the ricotta and fig.  It has pistachios, which I am slightly \"sensitive\" to, but I like the saltiness they add.  If I wasn't splitting the bruschetta with anyone, I would order a WHOLE BOARD of ricotta and fig.  Yum.

I also like their paninis and their pub board.  The pub board is about $12 (if I recall correctly) and it has cornichons, pretzel bread, corn nuts and cheese.  The corn nuts are so yummy!  And the cornichons!  And the cheese!  The bread?  Meh.

This location is considerably louder than Postino Central.  I have noticed this on EVERY visit.  Are the patrons different perhaps?  Not sure.  But having a conversation here requires near-shouting or leaning in VERRRRY close (which is not a negative IMHO).

4 stars because the parking situation here is a nightmare."}
{"text":"Looking for a place that fuels your desire for wine & bruschetta...small plates and great ambiance? Then this is the place for you. 

If you are looking to chow down on heavy protein based meal...then I suggest you split a board of bruschetta and then head to dinner right after (at least that is what I did). 

I had an interesting experience here..and luckily they redeemed themselves at the end, which I genuinely appreciated. 

Being from out of town and hearing the best things about Postino, I bookmarked it immediately as I love small tapas type of venues. 

Postino has a nice selection of wines, beers, paninis, meats & cheese , and they are best known for their bruschetta boards (they come in 4). 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LOCATION - Small parking lot, but the complimentary valet really made up for it. The gentleman doing the valet were prompt and really nice. Don't forget to bring a couple bucks if you are planning to valet to tip these young gentlemen. 

SERVICE - They redeemed themselves in the end. The hostess quickly sat us which I appreciated. They work as a team here, therefore though you have one main server, you also have other servers bringing out your food, refilling your water, etc. Our waters were poured on point, as soon as it got down. 

The only flaw I noticed, and I won't name names out of the respect of the gentleman that served us because he was really nice... was that I wished he checked up on us more frequently in the beginning. After we got our drinks we ordered which came fast, he did not came back to our table for quite a while. When he finally did, he took a couple's order next to us, took our order, then also took the order of another table near us (whom sat at least 10 minutes after us). I also watched him clean off a table, answer some questions from other tables, before finally entering our order in. No big deal... until the food from everyone came out..couples ordered multiple items while we only ordered one bruschetta board. I figured I should just be patient, did not even bother him when he walked through us a few times, but when I saw a couple get their food when we had ordered 20 minutes prior..that's when I had to flag our server down. I asked him if our food was coming out anytime soon, since it felt like a while and many others had their food prior to us. He said that it definitely should have been out by now and went to check on it. About 6-7 minutes later, he came back out with the food, apologized and said that the order was put in but the kitchen did not have the order. No idea what happened, but what I am guessing is that the kitchen saw our soup order and then threw out our ticket thinking it was done. Nevertheless, the manager did come up to us later and apologized and comped us the bruschetta, which again, I appreciated. However, my excitement and patience had already died down so unfortunately I did not enjoy the meal as much as I wanted to. I only wished our server was more aware of the situation without me having to announce it. I do believe each sever had a large amount of tables, so that may have contributed to the less attentiveness to each table. 

FOOD - Got the \"soup of the moment\" which was absolutely delicious. It was a potato, artichoke and turkey cream soup. Ordered the bowl ($6) which was perfect for sharing. 

Also ordered the bruschetta board (comes with 4 of your choice of the following): 

Brie & Apples with Fig Spread
Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato & Basil
Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone
Warm Artichoke Spread
Smoked Salmon with Pesto
Tomato Jam & Fresh Sheeps Milk Cheese
Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomato
Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios
White Bean with Chopped Tomato
Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese
Salami with Pesto
Seasonal

I tried the following, and each bruschetta was cut cleanly into 4's which was great for picking up, and for sharing. 

Brie & Apples with Fig Special- apples were thinly cut and the brie was nicely put on. Probably my favorite one. The flavors of the fig and apple went well together.

Burrato, Bacon Arugula and Tomato- Really tasty, and savory. A little salty, but it's the bacon 

Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios - not sure if the spreading of the cheese was just rushed since our board came out less than 7 minutes when they realized our order was lost, but the amount of ricotta on this bruschetta was not tasteable...very thin, so much so that I could see the bread underneath. I enjoyed the pistachios. This is a really simple bruschetta. 

Roasted Red Peppers with Goat Cheese - Nice roasted flavors on the peppers and goat cheese was nicely spread. 

Also ordered the Bellini, which was Prosecco + fresh squeezed nectar. Very tasty and a bit stronger than I imagined! This is served all day, everyday for just $5. Go for it! 

I am giving them a 4 stars, instead of 5"}
{"text":"Been wanting to eat here for a long time since I frequently go to LGO,  Chelsea Kitchen and Ingo Tasty Foods.

Ate here on a Sunday after church,  not to busy as compared to dinner time.

Valet service for the car which parking is very limited. 

Not a drinker of wine or beer so automatically limited our choices of the place which very much revolves around the wine selection. 

Had the Autostrada Panini with the salad and the food was just not that great tasting. There was barely any meat in the sandwich. The Panini was ok but the combination of dressing and meat was not to my taste. 

I could see how this place could have a great concept with the wine bar, but for food they need to put more effort and expand the menu."}
{"text":"I hate to admit it (because I usually avoid ultra trendy places like an ex boyfriend) but I love Postino.  It used to be an old post office, thus the name.  It is now a wine bar that serves \"light fare.\"  There are not too many places with this kind of atmosphere in the Valley -- very California.  One of the walls is a giant garage door that they roll up so the whole place is open.  Little couches and coffee tables are mixed in with tables and high tops for a variety of seating choices.  The bathrooms are lovely, clean, and lit by candles.  The salads are my favorite in Phoenix and the bruschetta is out of this world.   Come early, get your table and enjoy!"}
{"text":"We just had dinner at your Arcadia restaurant last night and I had a panini and bruschetta. It was delicious but the chips were horrible. We used to look forward to your potato chips that came with the sandwich. They were thick, well seasoned, almost like freshly cut potatoes.  The new chips you added are worse than ruffles. At least get Tim's or something close. Posinos is a special, artisan  restaurant and can do much better. All of your food is well made. The chips take up half the plate and represent 1/4 the meal. The devil is in the details. These new, hard, unflavored chips are a disservice to customers and the meal. They detract and are a waste of space, they may be cheaper but we noticed and were disappointed. Bring the old chips back."}
{"text":"Best place to go on dates! The atmosphere is very relaxing and trendy. The food is great and if you go on the nights they have specials you get delicious bruschetta and a bottle of wine for only $20. My husband and I are regulars here!"}
{"text":"I have worked in restaurants for many years. We have been to Postinos and their other concepts many of times over the years. Had a few issues with the food coming out wrong but our busser Jordan was very helpful in addressing the issues. He was prompt to recognize we needed assistance and corrected the issue before our server was able to return.  Jordan is a huge asset to your team."}
{"text":"amazing food, you literally can not go wrong with any of the bruschetta toppings. I even tried their seasonal one for kicks and it was delicious too..

you will love it, but you will hate the wait.. still worth it.. especially the board and bottle deal."}
