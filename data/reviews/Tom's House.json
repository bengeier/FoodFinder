{"text":"Great service, amazing traditions Chu chow food!  Great value for their dishes  Highly recommended to come to this house"}
{"text":"Having an ancestry from Teo Chew ??, Chinese, I really enjoyed Tom's House mainly because their food is really traditional Teo Chew styled. This business wasn't opened very long ago, and the waitress explained that they didn't have menus yet and their food menu was on a board.   One of my favourites was the oyster pancake. It was GINORMOUS and had a delicious chewy texture to it; something you don't see very common anymore as most places just use the egg. This is the non-traditional way and it makes the oyster pancake unchewy. The chewy texture is a mixture of yam flour and duck egg and is very uncommon in Toronto restaurants.  The vegetables dish was a little oily, but the vegetables were nice and hot; something I love about Chinese dishes \"WOK STYLED, like steaming hot WOK STYLE!\"  Lastly, we ordered one of their noodles, I didn't enjoy the noodles as much as the other two dishes, but I mean it was still average. The \"toppings\" you can put in them are really special and some were Teo Chew styled. We got the fish gluten as one of them (I would recommend it, it's something you commonly cannot eat at other restaurants)!  The chef was super nice when we met him after dinner! Also, they have chocolates and Chinese New Year candy at the cash register (I secretly wonder how long Chinese supermarkets store the Chinese New Year candies for, I swear they have it year-round, but nevertheless, I still gobble them up in a jiffy)!"}
{"text":"Adventure is sure everywhere; and today, I have an adventurous meal here.  Brine platter; platter with marinated pork offal.  Offal awful... nah..... it's tasty!  They are tender and savory.   Fish gluten; deep fried fish paste.  It's soft and tasty.  Pork meat pie; it's ground pork in slice.  Flat rice soupe; chui chow noodle.  They are kind of like flat noodle but lack that silky smooth texture.  Beef chop suey; beef offal.  My adventurous meal ended with a Gongfu Cha; it is a very strong oolong tea in a very tiny cup. The menu here is small and simple.  Choose between dried noodles or noodles in soup with 3 toppings or try their flat rice soupe with either pork or beef chop suey or steamed rice rolls with congee.  There are a few side dishes; brine platter, stir fried vegetables, salt duck or chicken and fish or pork meatball soup.  Excellent service!  Will return to try their fish ball and salt duck."}
{"text":"The store is small.  The menu is very simple.  It contains some noodles, and a few appetizers.  There is a menu blackboard hung on wall that promotes 5 or 6 entr√©es of the evening.  We ordered a flat rice noodle, a brine platter, and a fish entree for dinner.  The portion of all was good.  The flat rice noodle was fresh and smooth, living up to the reputation of a traditional Chiu Chow flat rice soup noodle.  The brine was very tasty, yet it was too oily for my taste.  The fish entree was meh.    I would return for the noodle.  The brine?  It is a toss up, depending on my mood."}
{"text":"I feel bad for giving Tom's House such a low rating because it was empty when we arrived...and stayed empty when we left. Having a restaurant in Markham that specializes in ChiuChow cuisine (vs. the sea of standard chinese food in Markham), I was quite excited to try this place out. But the quality of the food is not good.  The first dish that came out was their Braised (Lo Shui) Duck. The colour of the duck looked very different from the picture (it was much darker in colour in real life), and it became apparent that this duck was probably left soaking in the sauce for much too long. The duck itself also had that mushy texture (an indication that it is not very fresh). The flavour however, was decent.  We also ordered the lamb stew and rice, and their oyster pancake. The flavours were there, in fact it tasted quite homemade (perhaps no MSG was added? Which is great!). But I do feel that I've had better at other restaurants.   Lastly, the price point was a little too high to make up for the lack of quality. The oyster pancake was $15 (and didn't have much oysters in there), and a small bowl of rice was $3ish (For a bowl of white RICE?! most places are just $2!). I don't think I'll be coming back to Tom's."}
{"text":"Tom's House serves classical Teo Chew ?? Cuisine which is quite unique in the area. The menu though small but quite solid.  We tried the Brine Platter which has an intense flavour and I love how they made all the toppings in house: Meat Patties, Fish Balls...  Their \"Sticky Noodle Slice\" is really \"Kueh Chap\" which I have yet to see it offers in the GTA area. A dish of flat, broad rice sheets in a soup made from dark soy sauce served with pig offal, braised duck meat, various kinds of beancurd, preserved salted vegetables and braised hard-boiled eggs.  Tom's House offering is not for everyone. But if you want to really want and curious enough to try out authentic Chiu Chow items just like home? This maybe the place to go."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money. Should have known since I never see people eating here. We ordered the brine platter and it was wayyyyy too salty. The deep fried pork neck did not look like the picture on the menu and it was just awful the way they made it. The only thing acceptable was the stir fry veg. :/"}
