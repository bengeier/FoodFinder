{"text":"So this place used to be known as the best pizza in Las Vegas growing up. We always ordered from Verazzanos. It was always delicious. I am not sure what happened or maybe it was just a bad food night for them, but I ordered pizza, onion rings and the garlic parmesan french fries .The pizza was ok, the fries had no garlic and maybe 10 grains of parmesan on them, and they were soggy...Now for the worst part.. the onion rings .. I was so looking forward to these. I opened the container and they were dark brown in color and clearly over cooked, I decided to try the less burnt ones and the oil on them tasted like it was so old... Yuck, spit them out. I was really hoping after not having this place for so long that the food would be just as it used to be ... Oh ya and now it's called Rizanos"}
{"text":"Great Pizza. I am from NY and enjoy my pizza. This is the closest to NY Pizza I have found in Vegas. I like the fact you can walk in anytime and have 2 slices and a drink for around 6 bucks. Try it I'm sure you will agree."}
{"text":"I just stopped in here to grab a slice of pizza and i was shacked at 1.25 for toppings on a slice of pizza. Not a huge fan. Grabbed some garlic knots for the road and they turned out good and for a fair price. Wont be going back not with all the better options in the area."}
{"text":"Wow remind me New York very good pizza very fresh and tasty my favorite place to go and eat pizza they have fresh pizza all fresh organic very good taste very good cheese very good I usually take my kids only to a healthy good place and this is one of them definitely going back"}
{"text":"Food is great, been coming here since i discovered this place in middle school back in maybe 2002? it became a spot in high school for Durango students, only downside is they dont have dr pepper like they used too"}
{"text":"This pizza is, in my opinion, the best in Las Vegas. Whatever your favorite topping is, go for it. And don't forget the garlic knots. :)"}
{"text":"I'm loving the pasta with Alfredo and bacon. Huge chunks of bacon. I've gotten really hooked on it lately. The kids say the pizza is good and they don't mind eating it once a week so I can have my bacon pasta. :)  Delivery is usually pretty quick. Food arrives hot. Drivers have been polite."}
{"text":"Verrazano's is one of the best places for fresh pizza and wings at super good prices.  I've been eating there since I was a kid in elementary school.  They have been in business since 1980.  Its wonderful to see a small business still alive and kicking after so many years.  The food is still great and the prices are very reasonable.   I've found that its better to dine in, the food comes out hot, fresh and always YUMMY.  I gave the place 4 stars instead of 5 because they have changed their ranch.  One of the things I craved the most!!!  It used to be a homemade style with a kick of garlic, it was perfect.  My absolute favorite but I just tried it yesterday and it tasted like ranch from the grocery store.  It wasn't bad but it sure wasn't that same old delicious ranch that they used to have.  I believe the Verrazano's on Windmill and Eastern still serve the homemade style.  Good eats, great prices, its a winner!"}
{"text":"This place very much so lacks communication skills, me and my family ordered a pizza with pepperoni  wings and garlic knots. Of coarse they charge for a pepperoni  and we paid for it. When we got home and ready to enjoy what little reviews we seen showing how great they were, we open up the pizza to only be disappointed and see we were given just a plain cheese pizza, not only did we not get what we had paid for, we were not happy when we called and received rude service of a communication  error based on there behalf, we spoke with a woman about our pizza and she stated they will make a new pizza for next time no charge and larger size ok we accepted for next time and ate a pizza that was not pleasant taste. Couple weeks later we decided to order that pizza that was offered to only find out they had no record  of the conversation. I would not recommend eating here if you want a mistaken order"}
{"text":"Their Italian Wedding Soup is excellent!!  We ordered the pasta dinners, which comes with a side salad and garlic bread.  The portions were very hearty and the dinners and bread came out of the kitchen pipin' hot.  I'll surely go back again to try their pizza."}
{"text":"We ordered the number 7 that's two orders chicken wings with fries and drink I had the barbecue and my girlfriend had the hot wings Rick served it up really nice clean establishment recommend this place to anybody that is looking for good New York style pizza come in and joy slice"}
{"text":"I have ordered pizzas from this restaurant twice now. Both times I have waited almost two hours for them to deliver a lukewarm pizza with a warm Dr Pepper. I don't think I'll give it another chance."}
{"text":"I ordered their food to go on grub hub. I was very pleased with the pasta chicken Alfredo I got but their calzone is terrible! Don't bother ordering their calzones, mine came with a whole bunch of my toppings covered in ricotta cheese baked inside bread. Where is the mozzarella?!? On grub hub it said their calzones were three cheeses ricotta, Parmesan, and mozzarella. Usually when I order calzones at any other place there is mozzarella inside. It was a disappointment I couldn't even enjoy it, no flavor. If you want their calzone feel free to put a bunch of pizza toppings and bread inside a tub of ricotta cheese. YUCK!!! I want to feed this to my dog but then I'd go to jail for pet abuse. I bet a homeless person starving on the street wouldn't touch this calzone."}
{"text":"Had a slightly better experience here than at their other location further up Rainbow. What I tasted wasn't worth seeking out, and the service is a little dismal. Dated corner space in a busy plaza needs a facelift and better service to get in more business.  Lunch specials available even after the 3PM cut off time, reasonable prices. Signage says they also sell street dogs Fri-Sat-Sun, which may be something trying.  Pizza crust is crisp on the bottom with a good chew, but cheese tastes plain and cheap. I usually just grab a slice special but it's only out of convenience, the quality here isn't very high. The dinner salad side is fresh and well-sized though."}
{"text":"I have been buying pizza from Rizanos for over 15 years at this location best pizza in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"When to Rizanos for pizza and fingers pizza crust was way over cook almost burn chicken fingers taste old. I want be going back. They change the name and they said the food is the same. No where near the same taste. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Big fan of the lunch specials here. Was eating here before YELP existed. The pizza is good, but not the best, but better than most. I prefer to go with the hero's or sometimes the pasta lunch special. 1/2 order of rigatoni and meatballs is good and the 1/2 chicken parmesan hero with fries and a drink hit the spot. The roll is oven baked so the cheese can melt and there are two pretty nice cutlets doused with a subtle marinara sauce. Decent steak fries and only $8.99.  The 1/2 sandwich which is monster sized is normally $8 on it's own. Good deals.        The only semi-issue is that one of the workers there always smokes her ciggy's right in front of the place. She should take her smoke around back. Luckily, the cook in the back made my food, but that chick is doing this pizza place a disservice by puffing away right in front of the place. I assume she washes her hands, but can't be sure, so this is my pet peeve."}
{"text":"Pizza was so wonderful (meat eaters) I had to get two more because our team was that hungry ! Patty is so friendly a d Pablo the cook makes the pizza with a smile! The entire crew made us feel welcome! We will order pasta and pizza from them once a week if we could! Thank !"}
{"text":"Really like Verrazano's. Their cheese pizza is outstanding."}
{"text":"Ordered twice from here now, first time had soggy wings. This time I ordered a chicken parm sandwich and the chicken is burnt to a crisp. Who would cook that chicken and think it's ok to serve to a customer?"}
{"text":"I like their pizza. People in my family have been coming here for many years. I became more of a fan when I discovered that they use mozzarella cheese on their Philly Cheese Steak sandwiches, since that's the only cheese I want on that.  At other places I tell them to hold the cheese. The fries are good, not too skinny and always hot. This is supposed to be a place for New York style pizza. I don't know anything about that since I'm not from NY. There is usually football to watch when you're there. I had a salad here recently, and because I liked the blue cheese dressing they have, I had to return to get it again. Not all blue cheese dressing is created equal."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Been eating their pizza since the beginning of Verrazannos! I still haven't asked them why they changed their name but who cares! It's still the same great pizza! I love when I call they always got me ready to go! Lol. I guess they keep a record of your orders...  Such a great hand tossed pizza! And their Caesar salad is bomb dot com.  Chicken wings are always good too!  Great service, great food, great place!"}
{"text":"This place used to be called Verrazano Pizza. It's pretty good for NY stylev in Vegas, but not outstanding. Kind of dry and lacking sauce. Great for the area it's in."}
{"text":"We have asked for extra cheese several times and even paid for 3 times the cheese since they never seem to put enough on. Maybe one time I got it. I have had it with this poorly run business!! And to charge $9  for 5 chicken fingers is a joke!! I told the manager last night to let the owner know we will never go back!!! RIP OFF"}
{"text":"I am a fan. A big fan. When I'm in a dash and grab mode, a slice and a diet coke while reading City Life hits the spot. Used to love them so much when I first moved from NY & lived in Red Rock, I'd pick up a pie for dinner occasionally.   Pizza is thin crusted with a bit of a char (I always ask for \"well done\" as that * snap * is like Yo Yo Ma to my ears) with a great sauce to cheese ratio. Not too greasy, foldable and in a word: fabulous.   The staff is friendly and I truly savor my slice. The only thing that would make this more Nona Bensonhurst for me would be a walk up window. But alas, you don't have to be a homesick NYer to eat like one.   Can't speak to the rest of the menu, it's all about the slice and the snap."}
{"text":"The owner is extremely rude, the delivery can NEVER get the address right, the food arrives cold and when you call to complain after waiting 1 1/2hours for a simple delivery they treated us like crap and blocked us for future orders when it was THEIR FAULT!!!  We spent a lot of money there and will NEVER waste our money there again. Call Russo's Pizza Kitchen 702-489-4444 where the owner appreciates his customers and makes great food and delivers food hot and fresh."}
{"text":"This is a great little pizza place. The owner is a nice lady and the place is clean. The pizza is HOT & DELICIOUS!!!!! We will be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"A great restaurant. A good menu with all the Italian and pizza flavors you can expect. Chicken wings are great, and the pizza fresh and tasty. Staff is super friendly and they have a relaxed, family atmosphere. This is one of my favorite local spots."}
{"text":"Love their thin crispy crust and delicious sauce!! I get the 5.99 lunch special: 1 cheese slice small salad and a drink!!"}
{"text":"I was told this was the best pizza in town.  Unfortunately I didn't think so. The person that took the order said it would take 45 min.. it took a bit longer.. And it was cold...everything was cold. Oh they also forgot the ranch they charged me for.. we paid over $65 for 2 pies, an order of garlic knots and French fries. . Definitely not worth the money. :("}
{"text":"I am a Round Table fan, but Verrazono's Pizza has grown on me in the years that I have lived here.  Careful if you order it with cheese or with meat, it can make it very greasy so ask for extra napkins. I now order the vegetarian so there is hardly any grease.  The restaurant is not in the best of spots. There can be some shady people around, but that seems to give the dining experience more character. The place hasn't been remodeled( I would assume in years)- old carpet and sad little chairs and minimal decor, but again, it kind of makes it part of the experience. As far as service, the 20 times I have been in the 3 years- it's just been basic. Not overly friendly, but never rude. Just to the point and then off to make your order.  Dining room is pretty tiny so get it to go so you can spread out your meal and sit in a comfy chair.  They offer delivery and lunch specials if that is what you need.  No Round Table, but it will do. :)"}
{"text":"You know me, I don't give out 5 stars, and 4 has got to be great (especially for pizza).This was my second visit to this pizza parlor, and I have to say, the pie at this place rocks!!!  I've had their meat lovers pizza twice, and this compelled me to write about this perfect execution of pizza. From the sauce, to the cheese, to the toppings (pepperoni, ham, bacon, and meatball) this was a perfectly executed pizza. The cook was spot on. Usually, I have to heat up an oven at my house to get the pizza hot and edible. They cook theirs so perfect that when you get it home, you'll forget about all that. Get some olive oil ready because this pizzeria is gonna make you act like an Italian. Just try that crust in some olive oil as see if you don't want to finish it off. Shocked that it's on groupon, because pizza like this is a diamond in the rough. Thank you for the great pie."}
{"text":"We just had this delivered to our hotel via UberEATS. Nothing fancy but exactly what we were wanting! Just good, simple Italian food. No-frills or thrills however the lasagna was spot on and the Italian mac and cheese was the bomb dot com."}
{"text":"Wow great pizza great food. But they have list there way on customer service do yourself a favor and go to the origanal location were there cool. The lady that runs the flamingo location needs to wake up. Customer service is king I will drive 3 more miles for service."}
{"text":"The five stars is for the pizza, which is amazing. Everything else, about the places is a three or four star.   The pizza is delicious and worth the price. They say it's New York style pizza, but whatever, it's good. I haven't ventured out much beyond that, because I go there for the pizza. I have had their garlic knots, and wings, both of which were good, but not remarkable.  The ambience for dine-in isn't much better than an average fast food restaurant, though there is a certain homey feel to it, probably because it is a local favorite and has been here for more than 28 years and you feel that when dining in. I usually take it home though. I have been eating here since I was little.   It sits in an unremarkable corner in a shopping center without blaring signage. It's one of those restaurants that still exists, because of quality product."}
{"text":"This is a tiny little pizza shop a couple doors down from Bon Jour Bakery. They've got some pretty good NY style pizza. I got two slices of pepperoni for about $2.25 each. The crust was nice and crispy, the slices weren't overly sauced, and had a good amount of cheese. Not a bad place to get a quick, cheap lunch."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times since living here for 7+ years. Now I know why... Service is pathetic. Obvious return business is not their priority. Ordered a baked rigatoni with sausage and an appetizer basket for carry out. Mind you the rigatoni supposedly comes with a 3 cheese blend. Got home no sign of any type of cheese except the grated parmasean cheese I used from the counter. I decided to save this dinner and return it. I came back the next day showed the lady the problem. And all they can do was make another one. Not return my money and make another one for my inconvinence but just wait 20 min and it will be out. Not even an apology. Today will be the last time I step into this place. No return business here. How they were in business since 1978 is a mystery to me. Metro pizza far better pizza and quality of food. Pricier than Verrazano but its worth it for the food and service."}
{"text":"I will always remember the name Verrazanos but the new name doesn't change the quality of the food. Been ordering from here for years and they've never once disappointed. My husband and I love going in to pick it up since the staff is always so kind. Everyone loves great pizza! Also try their chicken fingers..... gaaaah!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places I've been visiting since I was young. My family are native new yorkers and according to them this place is the real deal. I just know the pizza's are always excellent! Chicken fingers and salads are some of the sides I often order in addition to the pizza and those are pretty good as well. One thing I would recommend is picking your order up, though. It takes forever for delivery."}
{"text":"This is our go-to for delivery. Not just pizza (awesome!) but lasagna, salad, baked ziti...reasonable prices and consistent quality. The delivery drivers are always friendly!"}
{"text":"Never order hot wings there again if you order hot they are stingy with the hot sauce they damn near looked plane ,if you order the ranch it's water down it's clean place when you walk in but I will never order hot wings there again"}
{"text":"Great place !! Driving by from California !! Stop at CVS !! Saw pizza place  ! It was really Good !!"}
{"text":"This used to be Verazzanos pizza now it's called Rizanos.   I have been coming here for decades, this location and the old location at Rainbow and Westcliff since the '80's.  They recently changed names and it was just awful.  The crust of the pizza was not very good and the cheese as well.  I hate to give bad ratings but this was really bad.  I will never come here again."}
{"text":"MAKE SURE YOU specify. They don't appear to have common sense. I ordered a pinapple and cheese pizza and they delivered, my pizza but with NO SAUCE!!! And when i called they said because i didn't specify I wanted Sauce, when there was no option to buy other than \"special requests\" box... Like for 22$ of course i want sauce wtf?? Def not ordering from here again.  still can't believe I payed that much for a single pizza, that was just really bread, cheese, and little pineapple..."}
{"text":"So I ordered a 18\" pizza and chicken parm.   The pizza was very good, better than all the popular corporate owned pizza places. The pizza was a lot bigger than I excepted so I believe the price is right on point.   Only thing I wasn't impressed about was the chicken parm. They are using good bread but the chicken taste like it straight from a microwave.   The delivery was fast and very friendly! The whole ordering process was simple. I will be ordering more pizza from them!"}
{"text":"Great pizza - a bit pricey, but worth it.  We had the white pizza with cheese, and were blown away. Often times white pizzas are bland to say the least, but this pizza had a great mix of spices and quality cheeses that made it something special. We also got a house salad and garlic fries. If we only got the pizza this would have been a 5 star review, but the garlic fries were very basic, fries with minced garlic on top...nothing special. The service was great (you order at the counter) and the decor was pretty typical for a NY style pizzeria in Las Vegas. We will definitely hit this place up again and again."}
{"text":"Came in to try out the pizza and pasta I've heard so much about over the years. And yes, it's as rumored...the cheese pizza is very good, has plenty of taste, oregano is provided in a shaker, and the Italian Mac n Cheese is superb. Cheesy and comes with two pieces of garlic bread on the side. I'm stuffed. The atmosphere is relaxing, and staff are great to talk to. The owner himself was working and cooking the day I came in. Amazing. Thank you guys I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Great food! Fair price. The best garlic knots I've ever had! Very fresh salad as well! Can't beat it! And a Sweet nice delivery lady!"}
{"text":"I lucked out when I moved back to Vegas recently and remembered that I now lived close to Verrazano Pizza. I remembered having it a few years ago and had not been back since. I ordered delivery one of my first nights back in town. They have some good pizza here. I've now ordered twice from them and will keep ordering from them from now on. I need to try some more menu items as well. The first time I got delivery and it was great, the pizza came hot and it was on time. The second time I picked it up on my way home from work. The pizza was good but a little on the greasy side. No big deal though. The staff has been friendly so far. No major complaints here."}
{"text":"I love this place, and have been coming here since i was a kid. The owner is a bit rude but the food is the bomb delicious. He has a dry attitude. They recently changed from pepsi to coke products, so that was a bummer. The pizza, chicken fingers, pasta are all good. I havent ever ordered anything here, that i did not like. This place has been here for over 30 years, and the price is well worth it. Hard to come by a flat out good italian pizza joint."}
{"text":"Needs real meatballs on the pizza but other than that this is a solid pie! get it well done"}
{"text":"Pizza was hot and crisp crust nothing worse than soggy crust. Also got chicken wings plane was typical wings."}
{"text":"Not bad at all.  They had a buy 1 large and get a free small pizza promotion going which was great.  I still like Metro and NY pizza better but this was fine."}
{"text":"I love this place the best pizza in the whole wide world reminds me of New York but even better cuz it's fresher so if you're in the neighborhood can have two slices of cheese pizza $0.25 topping for 599"}
{"text":"I stop here for pizza take out quite frequently as is pretty darn good and close to mi casa!  I always order the \"New York\" style pizza which never lets me down, sausage, pepperoni and onions. Simple and delicious!  They have been in business as long as I have been alive so that says something!  They even sell pizza by the slice which you don't find often anymore. They have great lunch specials.  I only order pizza's as I was once in the mood for wings...bad move. The wings were dry, tasteless and were not as I ordered \"garlic parmesan\" someone forgot the coating so there we were at home with dry, tasteless, cardboard like wings which ended up in the trash, my pug refused the offer for the appetizer.   Great Pizza!"}
{"text":"RUDE. I've been here quite a few times and usually get them for delivery. However today was the last straw. Usually I go in for slices and Johns always professional however the heavy set Guy is typically cold feeling and dismissive. Fine, I can deal wth that. However today I went in with my husband and he's not a big fan of pizza so I ordered two slices and a drink. He orders a slce with riccota. John looks to I can only assume is the owner and he says flat out we don't do that (rudely) and my husband asks why not since the sign says \"slice toppings 25c\" he replies we don't do that that's a specialty topping. He never said how much this premium topping would be or anything...seriously you couldn't put ricotta on a slice.... and to top it off they gave some woman a free refill on soda but there worried about losing 20c on cheese....Congrats on losing a customer"}
{"text":"This is my go to pizza place at least 5-6 times month. We always get the #25, a bunch of food and we are always left very satisfied, I grew up going to this joint and I will for as long as I live here in Vegas. Great service too! Quick deliveries!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Verrazano's in quite some time but after a few trusted Yelpers kept mentioning their pizza on YT, I had it in my mind to come back for a slice when the craving hit.  I stopped in today for a single slice of cheese. The pizza was solid and I really liked the crust. Not too thin, not too thick. Perfect texture and chewyness factor was on point. For $2.25 I'll be back for a basic slice from time to time. They also offer quite a few lunch specials at reasonable prices. Why I always forget about this place when searching for pizza in the area is beyond me."}
