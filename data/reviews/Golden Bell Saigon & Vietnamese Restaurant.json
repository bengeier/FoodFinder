{"text":"Went here with a co-worker for lunch the other day, I must commend to incredibly quick service.  We ordered and literally one minute later, we had our food (satay beef noodle soup).  I'm not sure if that was a fluke or if they are consistently that quick on lunch hours but it was awesome and I'd highly recommend it as an alternative to a fast food location for a bite to eat.  The noodle soup was flavorful and delicious.  Some of the booths off the side can be pretty cramped / isolated but otherwise the restaurant on the whole is fairly clean."}
{"text":"If you are a fan of rotten meat and flies bothering you during your meal, then this is the place for you. Never mind the overflowing toilets they had recently with sewer issues - we came back to give it another chance, but should have taken all the previous warning signs seriously.  There was a piece of rotten meat in my vermicelli noodles dish, which I obviously addressed with staff. Also, the flies go in and out of the washroom, kitchen, and dining room, so you do the math.  When addressing these issues, the person at the register asked rather non-interested what the problem was. After explaining the problems to him, he did not apologize and discussed something with someone in the kitchen. We ended up getting a 10% discount on our food - thank you for having me still pay for rotten meat in a fly-infested place. We will for sure never come back."}
{"text":"It's an ok place to eat with good pricing but the food can be hit and miss.  Don't ask for variations of food they have on the menu because you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed. Everytime I'm in Calgary I need the fried spring rolls, the pork banh mi, and an iced filtered coffee. I just love it. And the food comes out so fast!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Vietnamese restaurants for beef satay Pho.  It's amazing and the flavour is there.  We've dined in and had take out on more than a few occasions and we keep coming back for more.  We've also had their spring rolls and shrimp salad rolls - which are also excellent!  Service is always friendly."}
{"text":"Went here last Sunday   Ended up here because four other places that I drove to were all closed.  The place was full which is a good sign. Prices are slightly more than the typical local viet place. Expected Better quality based on the price but was very disappointed.  We ordered a pho, chicken on rice vermicelli dish and a seafood stirfry dish.  Nothing was fresh, the sprouts were brownish and droopy and the seafood was rubbery.  Very poor quality."}
{"text":"This was my first Vietnamese restaurant experience about 8 years ago, as I was dragged in by a good friend of mine after swearing off any Asian food several years before.  Needless to say, it's now a regular stop on the eating out circuit. Food is fresh and very quickly delivered to your table, even during the lunch rush. I've met clients and friends there pretty much at all times of the day and it's always been a great experience.   Staff is attentive and quick, while the food is tasty (I'm all about rice vermicelli now) and quickly delivered.  Price wise, I would say average. A dish would be between $10 - $15. If you're on the hunt for that perfect Vietnamese place, put this one of your list and check it out."}
{"text":"Extremely friendly staff and a very wide array of choices. If you specify your dietary needs (meatless, non spicy, etc) they will give you suggestions or try and accommodate you. The food always fills me up and I always have left overs and price wise its very decent."}
{"text":"Consistently delicious. Always fast, friendly service. Our family's go to restaurant when we're in the south. Highly recommended! Also, great vegetarian options."}
{"text":"In my general point of view, it is hard to determine where is a good Vietnamese cuisine to dine in for pho or vermicelli in Calgary? Which one is ethnic or tradition? What kind of soup base is it contain with MSG, freshness of the quality, and the price vs. portion?    Anyways weekday night at Golden Bell. I been there couple times for pho, but I heard the reviews from other yelpers said that Banh Mi Bi sub are very good, so my good friend James will be the guinea pig for trying out the Banh Mi Bi Sandwich. And he said it was delicious: the portion was good very balance between meat and vegetables. And I ordered the Chicken Pho, the soup base was contain some garlic and the soup temperature was perfect on cold rainy days, and the portion for $9.75 was decent what they give you. And the Vietnamese style spring roll: crispy with average portion of pork and other vegetables in it nothing particular.    Overall, I will be return on cold rainy day order pho, and maybe next time ordered Banh Mi Bi sandwiches."}
{"text":"Hands-down the best satay beef noodle soup I've ever had. The broth was amazingly flavorful and spicy. I can't wait to go back and try more things on the menu."}
{"text":"Great value. Friendly staff and delicious broth. Pho star rating.  Portions good. Sate with the pho dac biet is my go to."}
{"text":"This Vietnamese restaurant is right across the street from Chinook Centre, which is extremely convenient. Vietnamese food is always a favourite of mine. But for their noodle soups, they are extremely salty, in comparison to other Vietnamese restaurants.   As for the service, they do not write down your order. Our server came back 4 times to confirm what our order was, yet he still messed it up. He gave us an additional dish and argued with us a bit before he took it back; the death glares he gave us afterwards (i.e., while we were eating) was totally unprofessional. If he was having to come back more than once to confirm our order, it is obvious that he should take advantage of a pen and paper.   If you are looking for a yummy VIetnamese place and don't mind an extra 10-15 minute drive, try Pho Huong Viet (17 ave SW and 37th street - near shoppers drug mart/tim hortons). They have a way bigger portion size, taste way better, and cost less!!"}
{"text":"Some friends and I were in Calgary for the day and we were looking for a good Vietnamese place to eat. Thanks to Yelp we ended up at Golden Bell Saigon. Maybe I was hungry but I was happy to see that their menu was quite large and that I could choose from everything Vietnamese (pho, rice/noodle dishes, subs) and food from other Asian cuisines. Then again, I wouldn't actually get Chinese food from a Vietnamese place.  It seems like our problems with the wait staff is not unique as at least one other on here has also commented. When the server took our orders, she didn't write anything down. When she repeated it she had trouble with the numbers we had just ordered. They brought out three out of four of our orders and had to ask what the fourth order was. Clearly the server forgot and it was only now they were making the fourth order. My friend was sitting there waiting while the rest of us were eating. The table setting also only had two sets of utensils. We asked for additional napkins and chopsticks which never came... I finally just got up and grabbed the stuff from the utensil trays myself.  The service part is a shame because the food is decent."}
{"text":"Right across from Chinook Centre is a wonderful place that beckons me every time I'm in the mood for a nice, hot bowl of Pho Dac Biet or hearty Bo Kho (beef stew). Golden Bell is one of my favourite places for this Vietnamese comfort food, especially as the weather starts to get chilly and I hunger for something soothing. I grab a seat in the huge dining area and look over the vast menu. Hot tea is like a welcoming hug from my adopted family for the next hour.  One of my favourite starters is banh cuon, soft and tender rice noodle sheets with layers of seasoned minced pork and wood ear mushroom rolled together and served with a fresh salad of sprouts and Thai basil. Dipped in the nuoc cham, the subtle fish sauce essence and hint of sweetness complement nicely with the lightness of the noodle and filling.  Pho is hard to pull off. You can have plenty of great toppings and additions, but they mean nothing if the broth doesn't taste good. Golden Bell's pho broth is a meaty, aromatic delicious broth that is a pleasure to enjoy. It truly unites the elements of the cavernous bowl of goodies inside. In my case, I love the thinly sliced beef that cooks as the broth is poured over top. Add to that some chewy tripe and tendon and I'm sold.  The beef stew bowl is a hearty assortment of meaty beef chunks with coarsely cut carrots, chewy rice noodles and potato. The whole thing is a nice change from the house special pho if you're ever in the mood for a little something different. The broth is a soupy version of North American Stew, but so so flavourful and satisfying.  I should also mention the banh mi (submarine sandwich). They do a couple kinds of banh mi (chicken and beef satay) and though I usually prefer the traditional style with the assorted cold cuts and pate, this version is hot, juicy and so unbelievably tasty. You can even order it as a half and half so you can try the best of both worlds.  There are a lot of Vietnamese places in this city. Some that do banh mi well, some that are killing it with their pho, but I have to say that Golden Bell has a solid hold on everything. From their fresh starters to their generous bowls of bun with whatever grilled item you fancy, the folks here are making some seriously good food."}
{"text":"Love their peanut soups! My favourite is the charbroiled chicken peanut noodle soup!   I was very hesitant to try Vietnamese food but my friend insisted and reassured me that she would find something that I liked. She recommended the peanut noodle soup and so I tried it. I am a frequent eater of this restaurant and the owner knows who I am he hee hee"}
{"text":"The soups are good but just so bland and unexciting, even after talking to the cashier/owner who recommended their spicy version of regular Pho.  No, no, no.  It was so bland, so unjarring, as to put me to sleep in the bowl.  Why did I return? As the place was packed during lunch times, I thought I'd try it a second time in case I got the wrong chef the first time. Not to be.  Ah, but I won't return to what is sub-par Vietnamese non-cuisine. These dishes seem mostly tailored to caucasians who for the most part don't know good from mediocre."}
{"text":"My recent visit at Golden Bell involved a shaky experience with a waitress. We ordered our food off the menu. When it arrived, the food was different from what we wanted. When we decided to bring the issue up, the waitress exchanged our orders to what we wanted. But she felt it was necessary to inform us that it was OUR error in giving her the wrong menu numbers, which isn't the case since we've been ordering the same things for a long time. Needless to say the irrelevant argument escalated that what we ordered was incorrect, which we felt was her fault because the order she supposedly heard us say was 1 digit different from what we wanted, ie. #52 was understood as #42   A simple solution: WRITE THE ORDERS DOWN. I personally am not all the more impressed if waiters these days memorize my orders. It makes no difference in me determining their serving skill and gauging their tip. In fact writing it down allows them to read back everything that was indicated to them at the ordering process, allowing time for corrections. Also, even if you think you are right, it is a servers job to practice the philosophy of \"the customer is always right\". We weren't being rude or confrontational or condescending when we advised the server the food brought was incorrect, so maybe swallowing a bit of pride to avoid confrontation is a good thing.   Anyways, such experiences result in a major drag down in ratings, but what kept it at a satisfying 3 is how the manager responded. In sensing the heated argument, the manager politely intervened and instead of taking sides, politely apologized and allowed another server to help us.   Even if these types of scenarios occur in rarity, it should be shared to emphasize the importance of maintaining a pleasing customer experience. I've always gone to Golden Bell for years and it has always been consistent in providing a cheap, quick, and satisfying meal. The food is always consistent and so is the cleanliness of the place.   Yeah now that I think about it, maybe I'll give the place another try....."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times for lunch, and I've never been super-impressed.  I find the food to be flavourness, and the mango bubble tea is made from powder and tastes chalk-y."}
{"text":"This place is just right across from Chinook Mall with the yellow sign, if you don't pay attention, you can easily miss it out.  I've been  a regular to this place for many years, some great dishes are satay beef noodle soup (excellent for cold wheather), satay beef or chicken sub (yum), roasted chicken with red fried rice, seafood noodle soup, and many more. It does get crowded at lunch hour however very good services and reasonable pricing! It's a must try for Vietnamese authentic food!"}
{"text":"\"Meh. I've experienced better.\" perfectly sums up my experience with this place. I was getting my truck worked on at a business close by so we decided to grab a bite to eat somewhere close. We like Vietnamese food so we thought we would try this place out. I had a vermicelli bowl with spring rolls and we also ordered some salad rolls.  The food was pretty bland and nothing really stood out as exceptional or noteworthy. It really lacked spices and or herbs. The service was good and quick so no issues there.   We love our Vietnamese food but I don't see us coming back here as we have had some exceptional Vietnamese at many other places."}
{"text":"Best ive found so far. Really nice staff and great food. Ive eaten there twice in a day sometimes."}
{"text":"I love  this place! Fresh, affordable, tasty, and FAST! I used to be a hater of Vietnamese food, but this place converted me, the food is THAT good. Customer service is friendly and efficient. There are so many Vietnamese places around, but this is hands down the best restaurant. I almost hate to spoil this hidden treasure, but it's too good not to share."}
{"text":"The Golden Bell is one of my favorite restaurants.  The prices are extremely reasonable, the service is so quick that I sometimes wonder if they know my order before I do, and the food is delicious.  Their curried beef dish (#100) is my absolute favorite.  There's really not much more to say.  If you like Vietnamese, give the Golden Bell a try!"}
{"text":"Good vietnamese sub. Spicy without being overwhelming.  Fresh bread lightly toasted.   Beef was juicy and tender. Reasonably priced at under $8"}
{"text":"Good place, had the Super Soup Bowl and could not finish"}
{"text":"Food Quality: 3/5 Price: 4/5 Kitchen Speed: 5/5 Dining Area: 3/5 Value: 5/5  With so many Vietnamese restaurants in the area, you really have to step up to compete.  One thing we noticed right away is that the staff don't smile are aren't that friendly compared to other Viet places in the area.  All the things you'd expect are on the menu. Bun, Pho, Subs, and all other manners of fried rice and noodles.  The prices are bang on and two people can easily eat for $20.  The portion sizes are good as well.  Taste, being such a personal thing, is where Golden Bell fell down for me.  Not that the food tasted bad but it seemed a bit on the bland side.  I'd rank this place higher than Bagolac, but below Saigon Y2K just down the street.  On a side note, the red/orange color that they painted seemingly everything in the dining area with is unappetizing."}
{"text":"Stopped here on an evening ride with Adam T. Really fast service, some stuff is kinda strange, like they gammhave all the water  was pre-poured?! I ordered some salad rolls and some pork vermicelli, food was good but a little short of flavor, good but needs a bit more spice on the meat. Lots of seating and ok when in the area (though I will most likely just go to Ogam chicken next door)"}
{"text":"It was D's birthday and we were down by Chinook mall,  I asked D what he was feelin' for food and he was feelin' some pho so we decided to hit up Golden Bell, a place he suggested.  It was my first visit and they have their own little reserved parking area in a strip.  Golden Bell is located across from the Chinook mall on MacLeod trail.  It was about 3PM and it wasn't busy at this hour.  We were immediately seated at a nice big booth, handed menus and ordered some water and a pot of jasmine tea.  Normally when I go for pho, I order satay beef - D said it wasn't too spicy, but had a nice flavor so we both went with #51 satay beef pho with the meat on the side and ordered some shrimp salad rolls to start.  Pho anywhere doesn't take long so we weren't surprised when our salad rolls came out pretty quick with our nice hot bowls of pho following shortly after.  The salad rolls came in three and were nothing out of the ordinary...a salad roll is a salad roll.  It was nice that each roll was cut in half though!  As mentioned, we ordered the meat on the side just so it would be nice and rare.  The bowl of pho itself had big pieces of cilantro, crispy green onions, al dente noodles and tender beef.   As usual, when anyone orders pho, it comes with a side plate of lime slices, bean sprouts, basil, and chilis.  I always top my bowl off with a ton of bean sprouts for the crispy texture, squeeze a little bit of lime for that citrus flavor, and peel up a basil leaf.  The broth in the soup was nice and light, but I had wished that it was more flavorful, it was kind of plain and I didn't find it spicy at all.  The service at Golden Bell was pretty good.  They frequently stopped by to make sure we were still doing okay and topped up waters.  After we ate, D and I sat there chatting for a while, we didn't feel that they wanted to rush us out or anything.   I think Golden Bell is a good place, but I've had better pho...so it's A-OK!  If you're in around the Chinook area and it's frightful out, I'd say stop by for a nice hot bowl of pho, it's a great way to warm up."}
{"text":"If you like bland watery broth with frozen mixed vegetables then this is the pho for you. Based on the stellar reviews by fellow yelpers I thought for sure this place would knock my socks off. Total disappointment and will not be back"}
{"text":"It's been a general rule I've discovered that if you want to find a successful independent restaurant, you drive to a large shopping center and walk around it.  I mean walk \"around\" it, like outside.  They're never inside, but across the street is prime real estate, often snatched up by Boston Pizzas, Earls, and Red Lobsters--the latter I found this day in Calgary.  I was outside the Chinook Center--named for the region of the city the mall is in, which in turn was named not for subset of Native Americans, the dog from New England, or the famous helicopter, but rather the stiff wind falling from Western mountains like the gaseous discharge from an elderly man with an ineffectual gastrointestinal tract.  And as predicted, the mall proudly boasts several major restaurant chains including the aforementioned Boston Pizza.  After a complete orbit of the mall in a sweltering heat which made the wandering hobos actually shiny, I was about ready to give up and walk to a place called State & Main, surely a chain, until I finally found my destination, nestled a block from that outcast Red Lobster.   Golden Bell Saigon By the way, did you know there is a scientific study revolving around flatulence...it's called flatology.   No kidding.   This was perfect; one of my favorite local restaurants is Vietnamese and I jumped at the chance to compare them.  Right from the get-go, I was hit with the impression that I had entered a posh eatery...in actual Vietnam.  Tiles were broken, wallpaper was peeling, and the only entertainment came via a pair of tube TVs in the distant corner.  That's right, actually CRT televisions.  This is not a restaurant, it's a movie set for the next Bourne movie.  I'm not complaining, this place was great.  I once entered into a worthless argument with a friend where he mentioned his adoration for restaurants with zero décor.  I don't praise zero décor but I do admire worn décor, like the scars of a veteran after a lifetime of service.  Zero décor is lazy.  Weathered décor shows character.  The staff unfortunately also shared that grizzled nature, long drained of any desire to smile or treat customers with a modicum of appreciation.  I actually felt like I was imposing.  I will take a moment to shout out at the deceptive strength of the elderly lady that waited on me; with plier-like pincer grip on a tray, full bowl of pho stable at the far end, GI Joe action figures had nothing on this woman.  Following my pattern, I opened with spring salad rolls and concluded with a bowl of mixed meat in hot broth.  Between those, I also ordered a grilled chicken brochette.   The amount of food delivered cannot be understated.  Although I will criticize the shrimp salad rolls in exactly 47 words, I have to admire the fact that I received three of those rolls for $5.95.  The chicken was only $3.95.  Three courses with a tip and I barely broke a twenty.  Not bad.  However, even though I said chicken was good, once again I have to criticize the dipping sauce accompanying the shrimp salad rolls.  I actually heard a complaint recently that my local Vietnamese restaurant U&Me has dipping sauce too close to peanut butter and is not reflective of authentic practices.  Don't care, it's better.  That's it, just better.  The pho at the Golden Bell was fantastic, but it had to be.  Not putting any pressure, I'm just stating that if a Vietnamese restaurant can't deliver a perfect Pho, it's doomed.   By the time I left, the Golden Bell was surely ringing, packed end to end with people.  Clearly I had not stumbled upon some forlorn restaurant fading under the shadow of the nearby Red Lobster but rather a word-of-mouth gem known to many but never spoken openly.  If I was nearby, I could see frequenting it, an easy choice over the established competition around.  Despite the rough edges and uneven service, Golden Bell Saigon was a pleasant discovery and worthy of recommendation. As a final note, the bill came accompanied by a fortune cookie.  I can't really spend another 500 words in this review conveying how out of place it was to receive something invented by the Japanese, adopted by the Chinese, produced almost entirely by the Americans in a Vietnamese restaurant in Canada.  Having said that, my fortune said, \"Watch for a new relationship to develop within the month.\"  Although a complete coincidence, I did admire that fact that this one ended up being accurate...

{"text":"Where to begin? I feel it is difficult to write an objective review of a restaurant that opened a lot of metaphoric doors for me. I cannot remember the date of my first visit (it was in the winter, possibly 2003), nor count the number of visits since (though a good guess would probably be at least 100 times for lunch, dinner, sudden bursts of craving, take-aways, snack attacks, etc), but this restaurant has been a huge influence on me. My Asian dining had been relegated to Treasures of China and other sub-par Chinese buffets before; after Golden Bell, it would be the good stuff all the way!  My first visit was with my then-girlfriend (now wife) and a couple of her friends. They recommended we visit this place for lunch, it was a great place to eat with good food, so off we went. I had never had Vietnamese food before, but I do remember vividly my first few bites of the charbroiled pork vermicelli with spring rolls: I LIKE THIS. In fact, I liked it so much, I regret to say I have rarely strayed from this tried-and-true dish in all the years since. I have attempted many of the dishes (the squid, their flavorful Pho soup, nearly all the appetizers, most of the fruit shakes), but the special #2 (#62 on the menu, with a small bowl of incredible won ton soup and a pop) is the one for me. The shrimp salad rolls are always fresh and leave the mint leaves to the imagination, and GB is probably the best Viet place for having crisp lettuce to go with your piping hot spring rolls.  The staff have always been great, and we are on a casual-comment basis with the kindly owner, an upstanding guy we were contemplating inviting to our wedding years before the events, despite not knowing his actual name.  Many of the staff have come and gone in the years since we've been there, but they all share an enthusiasm for the food, and are rapid in bringing the food, with 100% accuracy in my experience. I have never had a bad meal here (maybe a couple of merely okay ones), but I doubt I would change my mind about this place as a stand-by when I want Vietnamese.  If you are trying Vietnamese for the first time, Golden Bell is a fantastic place to start!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch quite often with my friends since we are close to this location. Easy excess, many parking spots. Nice comfortable environment with decent space inside, which will never make you feel too noisy when it's packed. The food here is very delicious and original Vietnamese style. I wouldn't say this is the best pho I tried so far since I tried many nice pho restaurants in Vancouver and Toronto. But its one of the top 5 pho places on my list in Alberta. Their freshly made, natural flavoured broth and the Meat quality are good. Server is quiet but friendly, owner is friendly too and she recommended this Bun Bo Hue noodle soup to me this time. When I ate 1/3 of the noodle I realized I have to rate them here because I'm amazed by tasty Bun Bo Hue! Not too spicy not too salty with a slightly sweetness, very delicious!! If you are looking for a cheaper pho noodle soup with bigger amount but a lot MSG inside which seems flavoured but feels so dry and thirst after the meal, this is not the place for you. Their noodle just has one standard size, and I do think it will be nicer if they offer smaller or larger sizes for customers to choose. Because my friend sometimes only can finish half of the noodle. If you are looking for a good pho with no MSG inside, feeling comfortable and soothing after the meal, this is definitely a good pho place to come and try."}
{"text":"Okay, can we talk about the Peanut Satay soup? I always get the veggie one and it is out of this world. For real.  It's cheap, the staff is friendly and the food comes super fast, always. Go there!"}
