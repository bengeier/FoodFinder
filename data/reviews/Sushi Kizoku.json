{"text":"When wanting sushi at 10:45 at night and being able to get that, I was going to give 5 stars just for that. So thank you for not refusing my Uber eats order, and a bigger thank you for making it so good. Ordered a party tray; as that makes for av quick order, and not a single miss. Lots of good salmon, a good amount of nice tuna, and a nice mix of the rest.  Now I believe I have go to sushi place for delivery."}
{"text":"This place has a lot of potential. The food itself is absolutely amazing. The service however is horrible. They are very busy with take out orders and forget about the customers that are actually dining in the restaurant. We  waited a very very long time to be served (even just water) and there was only one other table of 2 occupied. The lights are very bright as well and should be dimmed."}
{"text":"Best sushi we've had in Toronto. The owner who served us, Chase, is a wonderfully charming man - he greeted us warmly the moment we walked in and proceeded to let us sample a sauce he was working on, and later invited us to share a sake on the house. He is passionate and creative and genuinely friendly. Loved the garlic scapes as garnish. Highly recommended. Very much worth the price."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic place. The owner is the kindest, gentlest person you will ever meet, who provides exceptional service.   The sushi is fresh, delicious Nd beautifully presented.   This is quickly becoming my favourite sushi place in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Location, pretty good. Just past the Rushton but on the south side. The building that it is in is set back from road so the patio was actually enjoyable even though on St.Clair.  The inside decor is cool, think Edison bulbs and sleek wood. Accessible patio and restaurant but loo is downstairs. Patio fit our strollers and looks like restaurant could too. The basement loo isn't like most, it's beautifully finished and nicely lit.  the customer service was out of this world. Chase ( one of, or the owner) was friendly and chatty but not too much. Creating a welcoming atmosphere. Enough about the decor etc!  On to the Sushi!!! Fresh and beautiful presentation!   price was great $10 for green dragon, $5 for Cali roll, $6 for wakame salad. Menu is dynamic, some signature rolls and great vegetarian rolls! Bonus: Pint of IPA $3.90!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing.  Service was a little slow, but totally worth the wait.  Food was beautifully prepared and delicious."}
{"text":"Found this place thru Uber eats and saw that they had some interesting maki options. They're rolls are huge definitely very filling. Price is good as well."}
{"text":"Worst piece of crap sushi I've ever had.   Ordered on uber eats and it was 2 hrs for delivery. Sushi was completely gross! Tasteless. Tiny portion. Odd matching of ingredients."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Well this location has had quite a few sushi restaurants over the years. All of which we have tried. Sushi Kizoku is by far the best! Absolutely amazing sushi. Fresh salmon sashimi, dynamite roll is delicious and crunchy. Service is exactly like what you would expect in a traditional Japanese sushi restaurant. We can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has served me the BEST sushi pizza I have ever eaten! It was so decadent. Went with a friend and also ordered shrimp tempura and we each got our own roll, green and black dragon rolls. The food is just so incredible! However, the service needs improvement. We received the wrong tempura order one time and it took a little too long for our food to come out despite the restaurant being almost dead. My friend and I saw a table of 4 sit down next to us, they were handed menus but were not addressed for 15 minutes and they left (guess they were just really hungry). Overall, food is *incredible*, but I'd recommend take out for this place considering the service."}
{"text":"We decided to try something new as we were walking in to Asada next door. The food was tasty and fresh but nothing spectacular; the service was fine; the pricing was fair if slightly higher than average. Overall it was a vanilla experience....not bad but not great."}
{"text":"Love this spot. Always fun trying something new on the menu and Chase is attentive to his customers needs. The staff go out of their way to ensure that the quality of service and food is top-notch. Would highly recommend - reasonable prices and some of the best sushi in town!"}
{"text":"What a treat! Thought we were walking into your average midtown sushi place and WOW!!! We had he beaches roll and the wyakama roll and some other stuff as well and was truly impressed. If you've ever been to blowfish you would like it better! Very creative, delicious and made with great care. What a gem!"}
{"text":"Simply incredible sushi and wonderful service. We stumbled upon this place for dinner last night on the patio and shared the \"Family Affair\" with three other friends. We started off the meal with delicious miso soup and salad. The soup was perfectly seasoned and the salad had a yummy dressing. The edamame was nice and warm and perfectly salted (not too salty, not too plain). Then came the incredible sushi boat! All we could say was WOW. The fish was super fresh and well prepared, and an election selection with lots of variety of sashimi, nigiri, maki. Our absolute favourite thing on the boat was a dish that wasn't on the menu - it was some kind of spicy handroll with a mountain of spicy sashimi on top, along with roe and something crunchy. Would highly recommend that you go to order this off menu dish!   The owner served us and was absolutely charming with great attention to detail and clearly took great pride in ensuring we were fully satisfied.  (For example, one of my friends accidentally broke her chopstick and without asking for a replacement he came over and gave her a new one and kindly showed her how to prevent future breakage) He told us that the place has only been open for one month and that he trained for five years with sushi chefs in Osaka. Also, they were super accommodating about my friend who wanted to bring her dog on the patio. Overall, this was easily one of the most memorable dining experiences I've had in Toronto and I look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Delicious , delicious , DELICIOUS! Expensive...expensive...expensive. I would go back here for the food, not the service. The Resturant wasn't busy so there's no excuse for the slow service however you can tell the fish was soooo fresh and the chef loves his job. Great find."}
{"text":"Yes, this is some good sushi!  Super friendly service, reasonable prices, and best of all... great sushi!"}
{"text":"Really great new sushi place on st Clair. Really fresh fish and sushi rolls tasted amazing! For 2 miso soup, seaweed salad, sashimi appy, 3 roll + tax/tip it was $57, which I was happy to pay for the quality. Great service also!"}
{"text":"An amazing restaurant .  We stumbled upon this place for take out one night and we're so impressed with the staff and owners that we have made it our no1 option for sushi.  Unlike many places the owners are actually Japanese and they took great lengths to ensure our experience was great.  We ordered a few of their signature rolls and they put together an amazing order for us.  The Unagi was amazing and there was obviously a lot of effort  that went into the various rolls.    We highly recommend this place for both take out and dine in.  Great place!"}
