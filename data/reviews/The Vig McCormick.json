{"text":"Love the atmosphere, love the location, love the great vibe. Wish the food would get better. I've given it 3 chances. It will continue to be my go to for social, but I'll go somewhere else for entrees."}
{"text":"Pay attention to your check when you get it. The waitress charged my credit card for  some else's food. Also it took an extremely long time to get our order and we were there for lunch and the restaurant was not that busy. There are a lot of better sports bars to frequent. Not again!"}
{"text":"Ate lunch with a friend here today at the bar. Tracy (or Tracey, I didn't ask if she has the E or not) was a great bartender, very informative and attentive. I got the tots (app menu) and my friend had the mac n cheese. He added bacon and broccoli (I had never heard of broccoli in mac n cheese but he let me have a couple bites at end and it was surprisingly really nice.) for $4 which seems pricey but its a nice, hearty portion served in this ginormous bowl so....Idk prolly worth it. My tots were killer! They aren't hashbrown-y tater tots like mom baked for you, they're soft mashed potatoes rolled around cheese and then fried so similar to croquettes but super fluffy and delicious and just a lil spicy. The jalape√±o mayonnaise/sour cream sauce is nice too. You get 8 to an order and they're about the size (maybe a lil bigger? Idk) of those giant marshmallows. Trac(e)y also made a killer Moscow mule. She's worth the visit and the food's pretty great too."}
{"text":"Everything seems just fine here. Our girl was cute and helpful. Bottles of wine are half price on Sunday. Mac and cheese was good but had some stringy unidentified parts and the nacho chips - they say they cook them here - were over cooked but edible."}
{"text":"I have been to the big multiple times in Phoenix, and I have always loved it. Usually I won't say anything about a hostess, because it doesn't usually bother me, but this time did. When we arrived, I assume it was close to their hostess being off the clock because she made it seem like we were a huge inconvenience. She was a mixed ethnicity (tanner skin) with long hair, and the only hostess on. She had a huge attitude the entire time we exchanged with her and when we got to the table she sort of tossed the menus down. It only took her 2 seconds to turn around act as though we were paying customers and hop on her phone. It just seemed like a bad first impression. Luckily our set was amazing and the food was great!!!!"}
{"text":"I don't understand how you can be called a member of the Vig family when you have no Monday night burger special like all the other Vigs and don't offer any of the cool little things that make the Vig collie bocce ball or bags. Can we just call this location \"Vigish\" since it's really not like the others? Food and service are good and I was excited to see a Vig in my area but I just don't like being duped into thinking I am at the Vig when I'm not thus the poor rating and me not recommending it to other industry people or people in general.."}
{"text":"I tried The Vig last night for the first time, my girlfriend and I ordered take out and were quoted 15-20 minutes on the phone. We showed up roughly 20 minutes later and sat at the bar, where we paid for our meal. We then proceeded to wait 10 minutes... 20... 30... and finally we asked the barback again if the order was ready. He was vague, disinterested, and seemed bored, saying again that it would be \"about 5 more minutes.\" I was so surprised that a restaurant I've heard so many good things about had such poor service! But less than a minute later the actual bartender came over to us and apologized profusely for the long wait, explaining our order had been caught behind a large tables. He apologized again and offered us a $25 gift card for our long wait. He brought our order out a few moments later, apologizing again for our wait time. That is a fantastic example of great service to remedy a less than ideal situation! He was kind, professional, and genuine, all things I greatly appreciate in the restaurant industry. Shout out to the tall, blonde bartender, definitely turned a bad experience into a good one!  On a last note - the food was FANTASTIC! I ordered the Black Bean Burger and it was probably one of the best vegetarian burgers I have ever had. I highly, highly recommend this place if you are a vegetarian like myself, as they had a great selection of non-meat items and a great vibe for happy hour or date night!"}
{"text":"I heard they opened up a new location and a friend referred me to this place. Upon arrival,  the restaurant was clean and the decor nice. I ordered my go to tacos from every restaurant possible.  They offered four per order.  The price was outrageous for the tiny one bite tacos. Nothing special about the taste either. Never again. The only saving grace was the nice cordial waiter.Other than that. I will not repeat."}
{"text":"Awesome brunch! Great prices and quality! $3 Mimosas and GREAT bartender...thanks Tracy!!"}
{"text":"I seem to have a soft spot for mac & cheese and theirs was good. The service seemed a bit spotty but we would consider going back. They seemed to have lots of patios and even in the cold they kept thr doors open. I was a little chilly but that doesn't happen in Phoenix a lot."}
{"text":"Ok we loved the vig! 10/10 for the libations, A+ for the food, 5 stars out of 5 for the hot managers! YAS! Come thru hot managers!!! Also, it was our Jackie Judz 21st bday and they presented her with a hard root beer float, which was much appreciated!!!!! God bless"}
{"text":"Great evening of dinner and drinks. We had the best waiter we've had in years.  Richard you are AMAZING.  Thank you for the great service. You made our night."}
{"text":"My boys and I ate lunch here today.  The fish tacos were great!  The servers were very attentive.  Loved the look of it too.  You need to come here!!!"}
{"text":"We decided to come here at the last minute & sat out on the patio where it was quiet enough that we could have a conversation--a huge plus! The food was excellent-- I had the grilled fish taco salad which is kind of a de-constructed taco & it was great. The fish was grilled to perfection. My husband had the crispy chicken sandwich & it was also excellent. Service was great too. Really enjoyable evening."}
{"text":"I honestly can't form words to write a review. So, it'll be easy. Service has been awesome, the place is fun, and the food is freaking delish.  The tater tots - get them!!! They're house made and perfect.  The Hot Chick - Pretty awesome!  The Vig Dip (sans mayo) - Amazing!!  The Black Bean Burger - Best I've ever had, seriously.  The Carne Asada on Potato Pancake - There really are NO words. I inhaled it and licked my plate. I want more now, so I'll see you soon :)  The french fries and onion rings are great, too! Also, the jalepeno dip you get with the tater tots is out of this world! The manager brought us more and I put that ish all over my carne asada. My husband loved it too.   So that's that. I'm drooling now :)"}
{"text":"Great service-Great food!  Thank you for coming to the neighborhood-always a convenient fun place to meet friends!"}
{"text":"Great patio; pretty good Happy hour but the Fish tacos were pretty bad.  Good kids meals about $5 each but DOES NOT include a drink - $3 for a kids milk and $2.50 for the soda made it a little expensive for kids meals considering the portions."}
{"text":"Today was my birthday so I came in with my family . We had a great time and will return for sure . Great blood Mary bar and the manager even helped me make them . Really nice addition to the neighborhood"}
{"text":"My wife and I had lunch.  we ordered the special, Philly cheesesteaks. The bread was so stale and had been left on the grill so long that the sandwiches were dry and inedible we had to request additional ranch dressing . After reminding the waiter twice we finally received our ranch dressing and some mayo.  The roast beef was so tough and stringy we finally asked for boxes and took our sandwiches home where we fed them to our dog who love them. However, the onion rings were superb."}
{"text":"I am SO SO SO happy this placed finally opened!!! I wasn't so sure about the Vig here, since I'll be honest and say I'm not a huge fan of the Arcadia one. But they have really exceeded my best expectations!  So much, that this has become my new fav Sunday spot! I casually went in a few Sundays back because I wanted to watch a World Cup game somewhere. I sat at the bar and was so impressed, I have found myself going back every Sunday since & will still continue, now that the games are over!    I'll start with the service - I was actually surprised to see some negative reviews below on service, bc that's the main reason I keep returning.  But maybe I keep lucking out bc the same two female bartenders have worked each Sunday I've been.  I know I'm going to mutilate the spelling of their names on here, but Im going to go for it in hopes that others patrons that had bad experiences can look out for these 2 gems! Their names are Elyse & Malease (haha, simple to remember since they rhyme...just not so easy to spell lol). Anyway, they have given me superior service! I have a number of food allergies and Malease was not only pleasant & patient w/me, but offered some great suggestions.  No matter how busy they are, they always keep an eye on our drinks & we never have to wait on refills.  They are also attentive with our meals, making sure everything comes out properly, we have all utensils & condiments, and simply just making sure we are completely satisfied. Malease even noted possible allergens in condiments for me!!! Unless you have allergies, you never really realize how valuable that is to someone.  And whenever things slowed a bit, they weren't your typical bartenders who ignore you and played on their phones, these ladies came over and were both so personal, sweet, and hilarious!  I think they do a really great job at reading people...when I wanted to focus on the games, they saw that and wouldn't interrupt. But if they saw my eyes wander or get bored, they were there to make me smile.  So kudos to this tag team!  They've made a regular outta me!  Ok, now the food - being that we have come for the past few Sundays, my bf and I have prob tasted at least half of the menu so far and I can't name one thing I haven't liked as of yet! Some of our favs so far are the corned beef & French toast for brunch and the fish tacos, salads, & the hot chick for lunch. If you have allergies, like me, let the staff know and they were more than happy to accommodate, which is rare.  And as for booze, you can't go wrong w/bottomless Mimosas and they use Tito's (a fav) for their bloody bar! Delicious.   So I absolutely recommend this place to everyone!  It's got it all...good food, great service, and perfect atmosphere!  And for those who had a bad experience, I saw give it another go...I'm sure they had some kinks in the beginning, which is totally normal. They def seem to have their rhythm down now...well, at least at the bar. I've never sat at a table, so I can't voice any suggestions towards that."}
{"text":"Wow!!! Just attended an amazing Cartel beer & food pairing dinner. Chef Justin Woodward blew it out of the park! The dinner featured 4 beers from local craft brewery Cartel/The Shop that complemented the 4 course meal incredibly well. The most transformative experience was the Biere de Garde - on its own somewhat sour but paired with the sweet pork tenderloin the perfect counterpoint. Loved it all & can only sing the praises of Chef Justin & Cartel Brewery/The Shop!"}
{"text":"Visiting from California.  Wine good, food was good. I would go back again to try something new on the menu. That said,  they really, really need to turn down the music  not a restaurant if you want to have a nice conversation without yelling to be heard"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Loved the candle lit ambiance. The bartenders are cute and friendly."}
{"text":"Really solid food. My date and I arrived and waited for about 30 minutes. It was busy on a Friday night, so we didn't mind the wait. For appetizer we shares the nachos and cheesy tater tots but were really good. I think the apps were better than our entrees. For dinner I has the vigazz burger with fried egg and she had the black bean burger. Both were ok. I ordered my burger medium rare but it came out done. The black bean burger was dry. I didn't complain cause we were kinda full from our apps so we took our food home and get our dog the dry azz burger. Worked out anyways."}
{"text":"I love this place! I have been here twice and have enjoyed the patio both times! Everyone seems great and very knowledgeable about the menu!!"}
{"text":"Just had a quick bite for lunch. Grilled fish tacos were very good. Nice for something light. Service very fast. We ordered and got served and ate all in about 40 minutes total. Only downfall the wifi connection was very poor to none."}
{"text":"We have always loved the original Vig (40th St), so we very happy when this one opened. I don't think it lives up to the others (we always really like the one downtown in the Fillmore area), but we are happy to have it as an option in the area.  It is always packed, so be forewarned if you are going for happy hour- get there early or prepare to stand and wait!  Food is good (not great) and service is hit or miss. It's usually friendly, but often times very slow. Maybe because it's so busy and they are understaffed...   I do love the ambiance of every Vig and this one is no exception. It's a little drafty in the bar area when the weather is cool, but most of the year it's an awesome indoor/outdoor space."}
{"text":"It was our first time here.  We were surprised how good the fish tacos were.  We tried both the white fish and the sword fish tacos and they were tasted fresh.  We also tried the prime dip.  It was great.  Service was great as well.  Thank you."}
{"text":"Everytime I've been here I've had a wonderful experience. Originally, I visited this sophisticated restaurant on a first date with my current boyfriend. I have experience working in hospitality and the waiter was incredibly accommodating. He was quick, attentive, a conversationalist, and entertaining. He also knew the menu very well. When our tasty burgers arrived we near started to salivate. Portions are great and so much flavor! Since, that experience I've been back two or three times and it has lived up to the first experience. Thank you Vig staff"}
{"text":"Compared to their other locations, the Vig at McCormick Ranch hasn't proved that it's up to the standard of the other Vig locations. I've been twice for brunch and received poor service both times. During my first visit, we arrived at the hostess stand and waited to be seated for 10 minutes, while waiters and the girl who appeared to be the hostess made eye contact and just walked by. I walked past the hostess stand, trying to find someone who would seat us, out to the patio, and was ignored, even when I tried to speak to waiters. We left and went to the Arcadia location. We went this weekend, as a second chance and received horrible service. Our waiter made no eye contact, and after taking our order, left to stand at his computer for 25+ minutes. The restaurant wasn't even half-full, yet it took 30+ minutes for us to get our food. Needless to say, we won't be returning to this location because of the poor service we have routinely received."}
{"text":"Service is horrific!!! This has been the case for all 6 visits. Tonight took the cake for more reasons than time to write. This location puts The Vig franchise to shame. The manager et this location is equally horrible! No thanks, I'd rather choose fast food or a night at home... #horrible #fixyourproblems"}
{"text":"excellent setting open to a large patio area.  Caring, efficient wait staff. More Gen X and Millennial age oriented, than for mature adults, with very loud pounding music oriented to the younger age groups.  My wife and I could barely carry-on a conversation due to the overwhelming music.  Beware of the short rib tacos, as the meat sauce is incredible sweet - ok for the first few bites, then becomes overbearing and no longer appetizing. Created an unpleasant feeling throughout the evening."}
{"text":"Visited yesterday so I understand they are still finding their stride. I called earlier that day and was told they don't take reservations nor do they have a call-ahead list. We drove over anyway. Because it is such a eclectic layout, it's a bit confusing between kids playing bocce ball, open couches with reserved signs and hostesses insisting there was a 90-minute wait for a table. We don't generally wait that long for a table so we went elsewhere. Three stars for ambience. Zero stars because we weren't able to dine."}
{"text":"Stopped In for a late afternoon lunch while doing some work and had a great time. Sat outside and the patio rocks hers. Great use of sun shades keeps late sun from ruining time. Server Kristen was amazing. She was friendly and her knowledge of menu made ordering easy. Had Pumpkin Porter and Pizza and both were great. Thanks Kristen for a great lunch!"}
{"text":"Great place to go alone and hang out at the bar. Or go with friends and enjoy the vibe and ambiance. Waitstaff is good and the bartenders are friendly. Whatever you do, get the tacos. Specially the ones with pork. Now!!"}
{"text":"Our new favorite spot. Great happy hour deals, fun atmosphere and not to snooty to bring our 6 month old with."}
{"text":"I love this place and their affordable wines! I will be returning here with my girlfriends for sure.  Great atmosphere, great service, great food and drinks. Would have been a five star but at times I felt a little impatient."}
{"text":"Place was busy but found a seat at the bar and there was full menu service.  Had the chips & guac and fish tacos which were absolutely delicious!  Excellent attention from our bartender.  Reasonable prices.  Looked like an amazing dessert menu but unfortunately too full to order any this time."}
{"text":"Don't underestimate this place. It's a trendy bar, but the food is great. Delicious, wholesome, and well prepared. We've had salmon, various salads, fish tacos... All excellent."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. I hear it's shoulder to shoulder a lot of the time but going there on a Thursday at 9 seemed like a pretty comfortable time."}
{"text":"We are regulars here because we can walk in 3 min. The staff is fantastic. Special shout out to Garrett and Emily, always happy when they serve us. U feel like family when u eat here. Food is really good, menu somewhat limited but is unique enough to give even a fussy eater like myself many choices. Weekend make ur own bloody rocks. Music is good, vibe is cool. The staff always goes out of their way to take good care of our kids. Family friendly but also great if ur single. Nice size patio, fireplace, misters. Great layout and design. Even when it's packed u don't feel crowded."}
{"text":"Was very disappointing experience my mom ordered a meal that had something very strange we showed it to the waitress and even the waitress didn't know what it was and was puzzled they sent it to the kitchen and chef and he said it was normal in this dish and it's eggs. Did not look like eggs at all. we both stopped eating and asked for the check. They charged us full price. And we were very disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a really unique place.  Great atmosphere and outdoor area.  Food and service were amazing."}
{"text":"Amazing place, I have been to some of the other Vigs and they are not bad, but usually a bit of a wait to get food.  Friday night here was amazing, our server Kory was one of the best servers ever!  Highly recommend this is the best vig out of them all, food, venue, and employees."}
{"text":"Only go there if you want poor customer service. Called for an 6:30 reservation. We were told they do not take reservations for less than 8 people. But, if we got there by 6:30 there would be no problem. We got there at 6:20 and was told there was only outside sitting. It was 118 degrees outside. There was a table for 7 inside, but we couldn't have that table and there would be a 30 minute wait for inside sitting. We left and went to Wally's.  We had a great meal with outstanding service. Go to Wally's and skip The Vig until they train their people to understand that the customer pays their salaries."}
{"text":"The wings and margarita were awesome. I had a hot margarita! Just here for drinks and apps! Great choice!"}
{"text":"Great spot with solid atmosphere. Enjoyed a nice dinner with good service.  Outdoor patio was perfect after winding down a busy day."}
{"text":"Exactly we had anticipated,  this will be a great place to have in your foodie book. Good job Vig McCormick Ranch"}
{"text":"What a disappointment. The chips and salsa. The chips were rancid. Wow, just buy chips if you can't use good oil. We asked the wait staff if they could get us better chips since ours were rancid. The second basket were just less rancid. Really a simple thing to make well. I belched rancid all night. gross."}
{"text":"Great and horrible.  That pretty much sums up my experience at the vig.  We showed up on a Friday night and the hostess said there is a 30 to 40 minute wait.  Since it was a Friday, I expected a wait.  As I looked to my left, there were two empty booths and when I walked in to get a drink, I probably saw three to four empty tables.  I then walked to the hostess and ask can we still there, or anything that is available, she said no, they are reserved.  Anyways, I sat outside and we waited.  We were seated about 25 minutes and noticed the booths were still empty!    The apps were on point and great!  We ordered the Nachos and cheesy tater tots, both were delicious and flavorful.  I was impressed with both.  The entrees, not so much.  I ordered the Vigazz burger with fried egg, medium rare and my girl ordered the black bean burger.  The burger was more on the well side and the egg was done, wasn't even running in the center.  Black burger was plain terrible.  So that pretty much sums up our meal, we took the good and the bad.  Probably would go again just for the nachos though."}
{"text":"Love this place and how convenient it is to my workplace. My friends and I sat in the outdoor patio that was perfectly shaded...it made me forget how warm it was that day. My friends and I met up for happy hour and ordered the fish tacos, the vig bruschetta, and edamame. I had a glass of red wine for the happy hour, but my friends had some cocktails that they enjoyed. You can't beat their happy hour, plus the great service!"}
{"text":"Mahi Mahi tacos and salmon dinner are amazing! The chips and guacamole with salsa appetizer is pretty darn good too!"}
{"text":"Even on a mid day evening this place was packed so we opted for outside seating as inside would have required yelling to be able to hold a conversation.  We sat and had drinks for almost an hour to two prior to ordering and even throughout this time and the night out server was very attentive. I've desperately desired a mojito for months now and was delighted to find they had mint to do so. We had a mango and original both were excellent and were a mere $8.50 whereas many of their drinks were $10 or more.   I ordered the fish tacos off the app menu, came in a four pack and were good but nothing special. However the sauce that came with it was a nice touch.  Hubby had the chicken pad Thai, it was wonderful! Full of flavor, hefty portioning, a bit of spice but not burn your mouth so, and surprisingly it came with tofu that was cooked just right as to mimic mushrooms. Only downside was a lack of chicken ... Tsk tsk   Another downside is the lack of options, the menu is pretty limited and it's a bit pricey but overall it was good."}
{"text":"We are SOOO excited that there is finally a cool, non-cookie cutter, non-chain (need I say more!) restaurant in our neighborhood! I used to live downtown and went to the Vig all of the time. Their food is creative and delicious, and the atmosphere is fun! I went to the McCormick location for the first time last night and got my favorite dish: the deconstructed fish tacos...they hit the spot as always! Their wine selection is great, and my friend had a mixed drink that was very tasty! We sat at the bar, as there was a pretty long wait on a Friday night. Both bartenders we interacted wtih went out of their way to be friendly and attentive. My husband and I are headed back this morning for Saturday brunch :)   FYI - the angry review below is likely representative of the sour grapes crew who didn't want a hip restaurant moving into McCormick Ranch. My friends and I are SO excited and are willing to spin those big arrow signs on the side of Hayden to make sure the Vig is a success at this location!!"}
{"text":"Had a nice lunch at the Vig. For gluten free diet you have great alternatives, specifically the gluten free buns! I had a chicken sandwich and my hubby had tried the nachos...   The presentation was great, however the nachos were kind of cold and looked way too greasy. He had to send it back, unfortunately. My sandwich had lots of great flavor and the gluten free bun tasted great, not grainy and hard as I have experienced in other restaurants.  There are a ton of different options on the menu, so it's worth trying. We liked the ambiance and the wait staff was friendly."}
{"text":"We went to lunch here at 1 pm on a Tuesday and it was packed. We sat at the bar and had a great meal. The food was delicious and the French fries were nicely seasoned. I like how they play with flavors and make it all work. The place is decorated nicely. It is loud but you can still have a conversation. Staff was very attentive.  Very small place though. So no matter what off time you go - you will wait or dine at the bar."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. We ate on the patio. There were four of us, including two young children. It was completely comfortable. We didn't feel out of place with our kids. The food was good but not great. I had steak and sprouts. My wife had short rib mac 'n cheese. A little too much sauce on the short rib, and the steak was a little fatty. I'd still be inclined to order the same thing again to give it another try. The flavors were excellent. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Ok, I knew that The Vig in McCormick Ranch was going to deliver and it didn't disappoint in any way at all.  I'm just stoked that it finally opened here in the Ranch and that I was finally in town to be able to go, spending a Sunday afternoon there and the place was packed in typical Vig fashion.  We started with our staple of every trip to the Vig: the nachos, eventually moving into the tater tots (of which are now addicting), some wings, and I had the prime Vig dip.    I also like the fact that the new Vig is a brand new building, very clean, and the parking is by far better at the new location than at the other locations being that it's in a shopping center with plenty of spaces available.  I'll have to admit: I'd been driving by once every three weeks or so to see the progress, as I really couldn't wait for the Vig to open so close to my place.  Looking forward to going for happy hour one of these evenings!  So my recommendation: just go and experience the new Vig in McCormick Ranch.  You won't be disappointed in any way."}
{"text":"I would avoid The Vig at McCormick Ranch if you want a friendly atmosphere for your friends and small pet.   Beware, they are NOT pet friendly, even with their large patios and near the McCormick Ranch walking trails and parks.   Don't think that you will take a leisurely walk from your home with your loved ones and pet, through the parks and be greeted at The Vig with open arms, you won't be!  We took our 86 year old neighbor there for her finally lunch in the neighborhood because she was leaving her home of 35 years in the neighborhood.  After the movers were gone, we decided to rest and relax on the patio (because it was the first pretty day of cool weather and it was raining).  Our neighbor brought her 10lb minature poodle who lays down at her feet on the patio and ordered our meal.  We were instructed that the dog couldn't be under the cover of the patio and we had to sit further out getting wet from the rain.    The manager came out and said he would allow us to have the dog on the patio this time only, but not in the future.   Pets aren't allowed.     My wife and I eat out about 3-4 times per week.   We have decided that The Vig is not aligned with how people should be treated and doesn't want to embrace the community that they have built the bar in.   When they tell an 86 year old women who is sad for leaving her home of 35 years that her companion and friend can't even be on the patio, something is REALLY wrong with this business and its management.     The time before we went to the The Vig, we walked in hungry and had to put our name it at the hostess desk.   She said it would be 10-15 minutes to get seated.   We looked around and tables were open in the Bar and main restaurant, but she refused to sit us because the \"Counter\" on her iPad that took the reservation had not told her to seat us.  This is Customer Service!!!   I know that it doesn't bother The Vig, but we will never visit this restaurant again."}
{"text":"This a cumulative review as I have been a Vig Loyalist for years. I was elated when I learned the news of a  McCormick Ranch location.  The food, the vibe, the adult beverages all top notch as with the other Vig locations.  Personal favorites include (but not limited to) for Brunch:  Hangover Helper (Chilaquiles) amazing with or without a hangover, McCormick Enchildas, and the Monte Cristo.  Five stars also for Bottomless Mimosa's and Bloody Mary Bar.  For lunch a few favorites include the fish tacos, Hot Chick Sandwich, and the Prime Vig Dip.  I wish I could make this a 6 star review regarding the service.  One my last few visits we were lucky enough to taken care of by Seth.  Each time greeted with a genuine smile, attentive service, good suggestions, fun interaction, and just a great overall experience.  Now thanks to Seth we are also proud card carrying members of the Vig Friends with Benefits club.  Oh yes - we will be  back again, and again, and again and of course we will be requesting to be seated in Seth's section."}
{"text":"Awesome. Good food. Good presentation.  Great vibe. Low prices. Live music for Sunday brunch. Super friendly vibe. What more do you want?"}
{"text":"So this was not my first time at The Vig restaurants, normally I go to the vig uptown and it LOVE that one. But this new location was a disappointment. It wasn't as big and open like the one in uptown and the service was not the best. Our server (who I did not get the name) had such an attitude when he approached our table and never smiled once. He would walk away before we were finished with our questions and rolled his eyes. He would disappear for 20+ minutes and eventually we asked another server for help. The other server was great and kept checking in on us more than our actual server! Food was good as always!"}
{"text":"I love the Vig, but it's listed as a dog friendly restaurant on Yelp, when it's legally not.  If you tell them it's a service dog, they won't question you.  But to have it listed on here as dog friendly is misleading.  Should be removed from this category."}
{"text":"My first time here and I'm excited that The Vig has finally come to (sort of) North Scottsdale. The ambience is great except...the bar stools are stationary and neither move, swivel or have backs on them.  They are very very very uncomfortable and need to be replaced immediately. Also, I understand and get that bars and restaurant need and like to have TV's in the bar ( during events I like them as well) but their TV's are quite large and take away from the ambiance that they could have. The TV doesn't ALWAYS need to be on. All in all I  will come back because the food in good and the ambiance is nice and its in the hood."}
{"text":"The Prime Vig Dip & Black Bean Burger were delish!  I cannot say that I have had a better french dip.  The staff is great!  I wasn't sure if the huge door was the entrance so I went in the back entrance.  I did let the hostess know it was a little confusing but she was amazing through the whole conversation.  She seated us at a table of our choice.  The waitress was amazing the entire time.  It was a great experience and I will return."}
{"text":"Awesome place to hangout with friends and family! Great food and fun environment.. We ordered chicken wings, chicken sandwich, fish taco- they are AMAZING! Server is really helpful. We were watching World Cup there, the manager I think his name is Geroge was really professional and nice to accommodate with what we need. Will go back soon!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour! Yes Please! :)  I came here with my girlfriends on a Monday around 5PM. The staff is so friendly and attentive! Their happy hours run Mon-Fri from 3-6PM.   They have great drink specials! I had their Heart of the Sun which was a sweet (mango pur√©e) and spicy (jalape√±o) cocktail.   Collectively we ordered:  Steamed edamame: Very generous helping of ~60 edamame, lightly salted and perfectly cooked.  Hot vings: These were super tasty with the right amount of crisp and it comes with about 10 pieces. You can also get the sauce on the side which is what I prefer.   Vig big bruchetta: This alone is enough to constitute a meal. Very fresh topped ingredients, avocado, corn, red onion and beans. Scrumptious!   Grilled fish tacos: Yum! It comes with 4 small soft tacos. Super delicious!  Can't wait to come back for happy hour!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for an early lunch the other day. Wow what a find. The prime rib sandwich was absolutely outstanding. Very interesting atmospheres also. Service was exceptional!! Be interested to return after work sometime."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the gluten free bun on the burger. Be a little wary- a server told me last time the fries were not okay and this time told me they were. Also the secret sauce on the burger was pretty much just mayo so I'd skip it.   They recently changed their menu on august 1st and took away the prime rib sandwich. This was probably their best dish so that's unfortunate.   It sounds like they have plans to change their menu seasonally so we're hoping they bring it back.   My boyfriend got the teriyaki chicken sandwich and said it was good."}
{"text":"A few of us stopped by the other night to grab some food and watch the games. The outside seating looks a little run down but that is the only problem here if that's what you even wanna call it. They kept us warm outside and Emily was our waitress. She was amazing great personality and went above and beyond for us. I'm a sauce guy asked for a few things on the side but she brought me a few others because she thought I might like them and did I ever! My buddies got ice balls in their scotch and after seeing the prices at this place they are definitely coming back too! I was more then pleased with my service and the food, great drink prices huge TV outside why wouldn't people love this place!!!"}
{"text":"The owner was nice enough to introduce himself! I really loved it! The food was amazing and wow, very different options. I tried new foods and they were amazing! The hostess was very polite and the restaurant was very clean! I had many people come check on me besides my waiter! Loved it!"}
{"text":"Finally a Vig in my neighborhood. We have enjoyed the Vig Uptown for years, now their great food is on McCormick Ranch. We loved their eye for detail with the design of this new building. They offer a large outside patio plus casual elegance inside. The food is consistently good, from well prepared burgers, to elegant entrees. The bar was always busy with both the cocktail crowd to diners eating at the bar. The noise level in the bar side can be LOUD!, especially with all the hard surfaces. It could use some sound deading, and, not great for intimate conversations. The food is the star. Burgers prepared fresh and as ordered. Note to the kitchen, On last visit their regular fries were way too salty with their spice blend. Their salads and sandwiches are excellent. They offer a full bar with a large wine selection. And, remember half-priced wines on Sundays. There is plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Well I don't yelp much or at all. Came with friends and family for Food and Fun!, Had a very great experience and our Waiter CHRISTIAN was very Knowledgeable and Handsome.  He convinced me countless times on what I should have instead of what I thought maybe have been good. Upsells and honest, not too much of that in the service industry these days. I enjoyed the maple salmon with a cocktail. Most of the table got the short rib tacos, was  kind of jealous... otherwise good vibes, atmosphere and service!      Will Be back soon!"}
{"text":"Great cocktail (Crash Pad).  Good atmosphere...nice decor/good music/clean.  Love the patio but it is not somewhere you can lounge for a long time...half hour max in their wooden and metal chairs. Service was friendly and fast but not as helpful as I would have liked after telling her it was our first time.  Worst chips and guacamole I have ever had in my life. The chips were like salt licks and the guac had too much lime. Needless to say we didn't stay to eat anything else."}
{"text":"I have driven past a few of the locations always wanted to try the Vig. They look cool. Not so cool! Ordered a drink twice never got it. Order a burger secret sauce on the side. When there is a secret sauce I want to decide if it's any good. Secret sauce comes on the burger not so good. To management credit they took the burger off my bill. But it was very average anyways. Not better than many fast food burgers. Cool for a drink but why bother with the food with all the other good places in town."}
{"text":"We were invited for a preview brunch last Saturday. They did a really nice job with the space, even though it was smaller than the other locations. Our server was fantastic; super friendly and attentive. I got the chilaquiles, which was delicious. I also got a Bloody Mary, which I asked for spicy, and they delivered! Overall I was really impressed and I'm very happy to have a Vig in my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Decent happy hour menu. I had the wings and Takes Two to Mango (mango margarita) drink. The wings were okay, a little bland. The service was pretty good considering we had 20+ people in our party and probably 10 different checks! Their patio is large and very comfortable with the misters on. Their pretzel buns are fabulous, from what I heard from others in my party!"}
{"text":"I really like this Vig. Friendly atmosphere, good service, and very good food. Somewhat limited menu, but I`ve been there 4 times now and everything I`ve had has been very good. Nice place to hang out and have a few beers after eating."}
{"text":"We just had lunch at The Vig, and split the prime rib sandwich with a side salad. It was delicious and they gave us VERY GENEROUS portions of prime rib. I do have to give a couple of complaints. The sandwich was a little on the cold side, but the hot au jus made up for it! We ordered bleu cheese with the garden salad, but it tasted like ranch. The service was great, but for a $14 dollar sandwich, the side salad should have been included. Other than these small issues, we will be back."}
{"text":"I keep trying this place because it has a great patio and nice feel.  However I have to finally admit it's sub par in all other ways.  Sweet but incredibly slow service, wrong bill 2 out of 3 visits, and average to below, bland, often cold food.  So many places to spend your money."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the Vig! Service is great, atmosphere is awesome, and the food is even better! My favorite lunch fare is the prickly pear shrimp salad - but I have enjoyed everything I try."}
{"text":"Try the cheese stuff tater tots! I had that and the prime vig dip... Awesome! Staff was informed, friendly and attentive! Good times"}
{"text":"One of the very best in McCormick Ranch. Elite Service and a. phenomenal broad-spectrum menu. My entire staff is super impressed with the excellent treatment we get every time we step in. They always remember us no matter who I bring in this cool, chill eatery. I've been there over 50 times and never had a single issue ever. they're very reliable and treat employees well. It's easy to see happy employees! You can easily tell the morale is super high..Many Thanks guys, for always remembering Dave and staff at Alpha! We will see you soon!"}
{"text":"First time here.  Sat at the bar.  Charlie was extremely friendly and helpful.  I had a Greek salad and it was the best one I've ever had.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"It was very good! Went there on a Saturday night and got the french dip. It's a modern gastropub type of place, but the food was great."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner the other night around 6:45 on a Friday night, and even though we called ahead and were told the wait was around 20 minutes, they fit us into a booth immediately. There is outside seating - but you'll have to wait longer. We got to our table and ordered our meals quickly - so many delicious options! Our waitress was super nice and accommodating of my food allergies. They were able to make my meal gluten and dairy free. The first time out, it came out smothered in cheese, but they took it back and brought me a new one within 10 minutes. Plus? They were considerate enough to comp my meal. Most restaurants don't do that nowadays! We had a great experience - blackened bunless BLT and a pretzel bun slider for him, plus chips and guac. We would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"a fun much needed venue in McCormick Ranch.  HOWEVER,  there last night on a Saturday night and I joked to my girlfriend \"Is it Chuckee Cheese Night\"?  It's a bar and patrons need to leave their kids at home especially toddlers in Spiderman masks,  and the ones yelling and squirming.  Won't go back outside of a quick happy hour,  or management should seat families with kids outside."}
{"text":"Stopped for happy hour on a Friday.  This restaurant is small and it was loud, but that did not bother me, as many good happy hours stops are loud with people having cocktails and trying to unwind from the week. We had the guacamole, which was good.  The cheesy  tater tots were not my fav., too mushy and greasy for me.  But the turkey sandwich was so yummy!!  We had great service, very attentive and friendly. Made you feel welcome. We will be back"}
{"text":"Overall a pretty bustling scene on a Friday night at this new restaurant in a sleepy shopping center. Most tables were full at 9pm and we had a short 10 minute wait. The menu isn't really that big, but that isn't as much a concern as the food quality. The prickly pear shrimp salad was overpriced at $14 and involved five shrimp and no prickly pear taste at all, while my turkey sandwich was hurt by the usual - below average turkey quality. The fries, which don't come with the sandwich (even though the waiter says what do you want as a side) were thin and crispy and probably the highlight of the sandwich. This might be more of a scene place. The kicker was when the waiter disappeared about our food came and forgot to supply us with silverware. We flagged down a dude who turned out to be a customer dressed in black, but this guy came through anyway with a full setup and we were able to proceed to eat the salad ten minutes later. Beer prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and arguably as good of food! Reasonably priced too especially for the area of town. I had the Pad Thai and the Mini sliders as an appetizer and they were both delicious! I will eat here again and recommend it."}
{"text":"WE THE LOVE THE VIG MCCORMICK.  We live in McCormick Ranch and this is our neighborhood eatery.  They are excellent when it comes to hiring because all the servers, bartenders, hosts/hostesses, food runners, cooks are amazing.  While the Vig has great ambiance it is the staff who make it special.  They truly are what set the Vig apart from other eateries in the area. My wife has bad allergies and the staff go out of their way to make sure she is taken care of.  It is like going to a good friends for dinner.  While it is hard to single out one person I want to mention Macklin.  He really is amazing.  He makes a point of greeting us even if he is running in a 100 directions.  Even when a mistake has been made to an order, Macklin is often the one catches it.  We trust him and enjoy his engaging personality.  He truly is a guy who goes above and beyond what is expected of him."}
{"text":"Awesome food, great service across the board. The patio is big and very inviting even in the hot summer months. Opened three weeks ago, and I've been six times already."}
{"text":"Ok ... Have to say this is becoming my most favorite weekend brunch place if all time. The food and service and atmosphere is amazing! I feel like I am coming home when I walk through the doors. The turkey sandwich and hot chick is a dream. But I always go back to the delicious chicken enchiladas for Sunday brunch. Love their mimosas and bloody Mary's. Seriously, if you have tried this place, you are missing out. Amazing!"}
{"text":"Worst service, cold food, worst experience. I came here with 2 people and all of our food was very cold. The appetizer-edamame-was extremely over cooked. We got a the tacos, breakfast sandwich, and burger and all were cold to the touch."}
{"text":"Really cool environment and a great place to grab some lunch after hitting the gym across the street! Also, best Mac N' Cheese I've EVER had! Add protein and veggies on that thing! Golden!"}
{"text":"Four of us went to The Vig on a Saturday in October at midnight to close out the night, and Jonathan took excellent care of us.  His exuberance, professionalism, and great service made for an awesome hour!  Come to The Vig if you're looking for some fun shots and great deals to close out a night - ask for Jonathan."}
{"text":"First time today. The experience was great. Food is fresh,  drinks are excellent. Bloody May bar for $4 with Titos! Grey Hound with freshly squeezed grapefruit. Attention to detail.  Sandra, Lauren and George,  you made a great first impression. Great addition to McCormick Ranch! I will be back,  for sure."}
{"text":"I loved this spot! I went here for the first time for my coworkers going away party, EVERYTHING I tried was soooo good. The sliders with the pretzel bun were my absolute favorite! The tacos were great as well! I'm looking forward to visiting again!"}
{"text":"What can I say? Awesome experience with great atmosphere, attentive staff, and delicious food.  We were promptly seated tonight and greeted right away. Our waitress was super sweet and well versed on the menu and made excellent suggestions. We even had the pleasure to meet the manager who was pleasant and courteous. He exceeded our expectations and personally checked on us to make sure everything was great which was much appreciated. You don't get service like this anywhere else!  The restaurant has an amazing ambiance with stone walls, comfy booths, and just an overall cool vibe. Everything was clean and immaculate from the tables to the restrooms. Did I mention how delicious the food is? Wings (vings) were spicy and yummy, entrees were hot and fast, and OMG dessert was to die for... Best I've had! Thank you to The Vig McCormick Ranch for a great experience!!!"}
{"text":"How does this place stay busy? Because it is one of only a handful of restaurants in the Gainey/ McCormick hood. Blah food, blah service and overpriced drinks... because they know there is nothing else around except more of the same. Trust me, skip this place and take your $ somewhere else. Yuck!"}
{"text":"Just like the Vig in Arcadia - this place is cool.   Just sat at the bar because we couldn't possibly get a table.  The service, drinks and food was pretty good, although the carnitas on the nachos was pretty dry.   I would definitely go back.   Good vibe!"}
{"text":"Decent. I love the other Vig locations, but was not nearly as impressed with the ambience, nor the staff here, as I have been at Fillmore and Arcadia. The bartender was very nice, but could have been more attentive (I had to ask three times for water, and then repeatedly ask when I needed a refill). The signature cocktail I got was also weaker than when I've gotten it at other locations. I love the vig menu, and it's course, so I'll likely be back, but when I have the time, I will definitely drive out of my way to Fillmore or Arcadia"}
{"text":"Great place!  I loved my delicious enormous chop salad with salmon. Seth was very sweet and attentive. Wonderful experience and I will be back."}
{"text":"Great spot, awesome gastropub with tasty food and a chill environment. I've been to the filmore Vig and had a good time, but I had a better time at this one. There's a real laid back charm to this Vig location, it's easy to be there and easy to just relax. I love how they have trivial pursuit cards on the tables so you can nerd out with trivia while you wait.   The Ribeye is awesome, nice and tasty with the perfect amount of fat and marbling, excellent cut of meat. Good sides, good food, good beers on hand, I'm a pleased eater.   I'll definitely come back when I'm in the area, highly recommend it to anyone nearby or visiting."}
{"text":"These days it's not very often you find someone who is willing to help out in a pinch. I called and spoke with the manager Steve. We were in a pinch because the meeting I was organizing, we had so many RSVP's we no longer were going to fit at the location I had set. I called and Steve the manager was so gracious to help us out in a pinch. We had our meeting at the restaurant. Then a happy hour following:) The vibe here is always awesome and the food is constantly good. Thank you for showing there is still a sense of community out there. Will never forget it."}
{"text":"It's an awesome patio spot to hang out.  Small inside so service is a bit slow but our dinner was great!  Sweet potato fries are awesome!  Loud place so if you're looking for a nice quiet place keep driving.  I would def go back to try the fish tacos."}
{"text":"Went here for a co-workers going-away party. Called ahead to reserve tables, no problem. We sat outside and the weather was great! The food didn't disappoint and the service was good as well. Not the original Vig but would go back!"}
{"text":"Ist time at the new location, been to the others. Food was exceptional. Decor is outstanding. Comfortable, but kind of small. Neighborhood should love the place. Our only bad comment would have been the service. Sat at the bar, bartender seemed more interested in talking to others than making sure we were taken care of. No big deal, probably just the newness of the place and being chatting with new patrons... We were one, not that chatty to us."}
{"text":"I was dubious about meeting friends here outdoors for brunch in JULY (we were a large group) but it was actually fairly comfortable outside.  We arrived at 10 a.m. and by noon, it was starting to get toasty but was surprisingly comfortable outside with the shade and misters.    The Bloody Mary brunch special is suh-weet!  Tito's vodka and I get to put all my own fixins?  Yes, please.  The only thing missing from the bloody bar were olives.  Must have green olives, preferably stuffed with jalapenos.    Food was delicious and I love that I could get a burger at 10:00 a.m. (not all of us are breakfast-food people).  Great service.  If I'm in the area, I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Happy to have a Vig nearby. Great patio, service and food.  We like coming and relaxing, no rush.  Give it a try."}
{"text":"Uh wtf? went on a Sunday like 6.30 and walk in and like teenager greeter hostess just standing there starting at our party. doesn't say anything. so im like hello there are 3 of us. she sjust barks out no tables inside only outside. It was 111 degrees outside no misters LOL  im like no thx how long since she didn't indicate and sez I dunno like 15-20 mins. and kind sighs.  Look you have ZERO business being in the hospitality industry. I blame you, I blame management. wtf. awful.  Bye."}
{"text":"Casual American food and drinks here. It's lively and a bit loud, but friendly staff. The food is a real winner here. The selection choices on the menu are abbreviated for Summer, but the food is full of flavor and it's fresh.  My choices were the chicken sandwich and pie in a jar with candied BACON. Nice contrast of sweet and savory/salty; though more a cake than a pie."}
{"text":"Good drinks, good appetizers and nice dining and patio area. Get the wings (sweet/spicy) or nachos !"}
{"text":"The sliders are killer ! It's a must do ! And only $6 for happy hour!  Everyone that works here are nice and friendly . Been here a few times and always greeted by everyone ."}
{"text":"My husband and I had  Sunday brunch.   I had the  breakfast enchiladas and he had the turkey sandwich with sweet potato French fries.   Everything was delicious; the fries were the best I've ever tastes."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best brunches I've had! The breakfast sandwich was amazing. My aunt had the hangover helper which she was living for! The patio was perfect to enjoy a beautiful Sunday."}
{"text":"This place is great for Gluten free eaters they have gluten free hamburger buns for the burgers and omission for gluten free beer. There patio is small but nice. It is a great casual environment. The service was pretty good. It is a smaller place so on Friday happy hour expect to wait for a table."}
{"text":"Me an about 20 friends just celebrated a birthday party an all I have to say is WOW!!! This place is amazing! Our server was Haley an she was amazing! She handled our 20top with ease! She was very patient, made great recommendations, an was just flat out good at her job! The food was awesome to! We had ceviche, the \"vings\" and I had the flat iron steak! Everything was prepared beautifully! I'm so happy we made the decision to go here! We will definetly be telling our friends about this jem!"}
{"text":"This is a popular place and I can see why. We had good service. I had posole and a side of cole slaw: both excellent. My wife loved her prime rib sandwich and a friend had a good chicken sandwich and another friend enjoyed her entree salad. The desserts were good and the wine list satisfactory. The only item we ordered that I thought questionable was the cheesy tater tots. Price was a little high for what we got. We will probably return."}
{"text":"After discovering I'd made Mothers Day reservations for 6 at the wrong location and made a late call to the VIG McCormick, The Manager \"Mark\" went out of his way to find room for us even though they were fully booked AND gave us the choice of patio seating. He saved our day and my a**! Our server Seth just made the experience that much better. Very personable, accommodating and just went out of his way to make sure we had a great experience. Great food too. Thanks Mark, Seth and the VIG McCormick. Highly recommended!  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch to meet a client and loved it! Elegant, nice, clean and manager stopped by to ask if everything was great. I certainly would come back! Bar looked awesome! Next time it will have to be happy hour!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a steak and sprouts - medium. Now I am not picky but my steak as absoulty RAW!! Tracy our waitress was so sweet and she took it back to be fixed. Got it back still totally RAW. WTF?    My god he didn't even cook it and just did a  replate and covered with demi glaze. Showed Tracy again she was shocked and embarrassed ,same with manager. They comp'd me meal but Now My husband is stuffed and I am starving. Heading to the grocery store to by food.. It Sucks.  I had read the nextdoor post and avoided the place for a while  and for some reason we thought today we would try it despite the opinions. NOPE.  This place is just a neighbor bar with a bad cook. If you can't cook a steak right on a non busy day you need to get out of the kitchen. I can do it with my eyes closed."}
{"text":"The food was fabulous!  We had the hummus appetizer, the grilled fish tacos and the short rib tacos, all so good.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it's a little too loud in the restaurant but I love the decor which probably makes it loud.  Oh well, you gotta try it out!  We are not on this side of town much but when we are we will be back!"}
{"text":"I was first introduced to the Vig Arcadia and wasn't nearly as impressed as I was with the Vig McCormick Ranch. Their food is on point as well as their service. They have extremely nice staff and fantastic bartenders! Marty and Jonathan are the best!! Marty is great at recommending food and Jonathan is great at pairing food with cocktails. The two together make an awesome duo. We've had them the last 10+ times we have been here and each time they have never been short of excellent.   An added perk of this place is the plugs underneath the bartop. It allows many to work and drink. What could be better?"}
{"text":"Of all the Vigs, I like this one best :-)  The others are solid 4s so I guess that'd make this one a 5.  Daily flatbreads are great.  Hot Habby is a great habanero margarita.  Chris behind the bar is quite amiable.  We came hear for dinner with friends and had a great time.  I visited more recently during happy hour, nice food specials."}
{"text":"We were out on this side of town yesterday and needed somewhere to stop for dinner and drinks. The drinks were awesome, great choices. I was happy with the food, nothing bad just wasn't \"wowed\".   My husband wasn't satisfied with the food choices, said they were very limited. I thought it was OK but if we were on that side of town we would probably try something else!"}
{"text":"Just found this place while eating at Qwick Chinese (another excellent place to eat). The VIG is current, upscale without the upscale prices, great atmosphere, and the food is out of this world. My boyfriend had the Mahi tacos and they were so fresh and flavorful. He was quite happy. I had the blackbean burger and all I can say is OMG! It was DEE-LISH! You never know if a veggie or bean burger will be dried out or not, well this one was perfect - simply PERFECT! And flavor was popping out of my mouth! Kudos to the chef! Presentation was amazing! Very nice! I didn't get to take pictures - I'm bummed. I write a food blog, and usually have my camera everywhere I go eat. Next time for sure!  We live at Indian School and Hayden - sorry we are JUST finding this place! I could eat there very night! Good wine too.   We'll be back...again and again!"}
{"text":"Very good restaurant however quite a limited menu.  The food was very good but i found myself unable to find something i really wanted, i ended up going with the Sliders appetizer, which was very good.  Good atmosphere, good service but again, limited menu."}
{"text":"The Vig's lamb belly salad is one of my favorite salads anywhere. Really, the food is pretty good in general here, but that salad... Amazing.  Imagine my surprise when this Wednesday I showed up and they had a new menu sans lamb belly salad. Odd.  I mentioned it to the bartender, and she said the chef took it off the menu because they kept running out of lamb belly.  Now, I suppose I don't have the best business acumen, but isn't it better, from a margin perspective, to always run out of something, than to consistently have leftovers? Isn't that an indication that the lamb belly salad is really popular? Isn't that how you achieve maximal utilization?  I mean, I don't know what it takes to run a restaurant, but I do know this - without the lamb belly salad, the Vig is dead to me."}
{"text":"Braised short ribs and ahi tuna salad are great. We enjoyed 50% off all bottles of wine on Sunday! Skip the tater tots and save room for dessert."}
{"text":"This location of The Vig is our favorite. Not only is it close to home, it's the place we go \"where everyone knows our name.\" It's a great neighborhood spot with good food and great service. We end up there on weekends when we're looking for a start to our evening plans or during the week when cooking isn't on the agenda! We ALWAYS wait for a seat in Emily's section, if she's working because she's amazing! She always remember our \"usual\" order and makes us feel like welcome guests. I highly recommend the Glazed Salmon and their Hot Vings!"}
{"text":"Dry, over-charred, boring chicken sandwich, I think the desert was from Cosco.. too many other great restaurants in the area to eat here... ok for late night."}
{"text":"The service is good but the food is amazing. The mac and cheese is shockingly good but the edamame is a *must have*. Only warning is the place is extra loud."}
{"text":"I met some friends here on Saturday night, May 19th at 5pm.  I wasn't sure if my party had arrived yet, so I went to the bar to order a drink.  There was only one bartender, and I have to say I was disappointed that I was a ghost to him.  He was engrossed in a conversation with someone sitting at the bar, (perhaps a friend)? I'm okay with that, what I am not okay with is that he didn't acknowledge me.  He wasn't taking an order, he was shooting the breeze, (FOR A LONG TIME). It was almost insulting.  I not only felt ignored, but also intimidated.  (This was a big, scruffy looking guy). I didn't want to yell out and get his attention, (but I know he saw me).  He never did come over to me, finally, after maybe 10 minutes of me sitting there looking like an idiot, a nice blonde lady came out from the back and asked me what I wanted.  (WOW, that was nice).  I did finally meet my party on the patio.  We ordered food, which was very good.  I had the \"Vig burger\", which was really tasty, and we ordered the \"flat bread\" appetizer, which was great.  Once we were seated on the patio, the service was wonderful.  A nice gentleman came out to ask how everything was after we finished eating, etc.  (That was nice, I am assuming he was the manager).  The bartender that ignored me was later on the patio with a motorcycle helmet.  Perhaps the manager can address him on ignoring people at the bar.  (The first rule in the service industry is to acknowledge a customer, even if you can't get to them right away).  This is a signature rule, if he had just acknowledged me, it would have been okay), it will also help you get tips.  This guy grossly ignored me.  This makes me not want to come back!  Other than that, the food was good.  My meal was good, however, I won't come back here on the weekend, unless the manager wants to allow happy hour prices and address his bartenders on proper bar etiquette if they are serving customers.  Paying $4 for a domestic light beer is too much.  I understand it's McCormick Ranch, however, there are several bars in the area that will not charge that much for beer.  (Even on the weekend).  I wouldn't mind so much if the bartenders get properly trained.  I may come back in that case on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Another great Vig location!  We stopped in yesterday to grab a snack and a drink before heading out to dinner.  The bartender was great - introduced herself and totally made us feel welcome.  The coug cup was dangerously good - they go down way too easily!  Great neighborhood location which appears to draw a lot of regulars. Nice patio and inside booth seating as well."}
{"text":"We came for the first time on a Saturday hoping for Happy Hour then realizing we read the website incorrectly that they had none. So at first the prices seemed high then we started ordering and the food came and realized the food was very tasty and not at all overpriced.  10 wings for $11.50 regular price is not bad at all. Very well cooked, with the Thai sweet chili glaze and copious amounts of  slightly thinner than normal ranch dressing that was still very flavorful. A spicy and sweet treat we'd order again.  We wanted to taste several items so we ordered a half size of pozole ($6) and a grilled wedge.  Supposedly for six dollars or half a serving was amazing. Flavorful broth, tender pork, and a crunchy cabbage. For $13 for a very large bowl it seems like a good value for all of the flavor!   My better half had a prime rib sandwich with roasted brussels sprouts. The beef was very tender although the brussels sprouts seemed a little weak in flavor compared to many of the other preparations in the area.   As soon as a chance we will return for actual happy hour offerings."}
{"text":"love love love this place. I always come here with may friends and if you got a big appetite then I totally recommend this spot! The ambiance is really cool. I love the fact that you can sit outside and it's super cozy with the heat lamps and all. I love going there for breakfast, lunch or dinner. For breakfast I love the breakfast sandwich. What's not to love? It's really tasty. I also am obsessed with the pad thai. Hands down my most favorite out of every restaurant I've been to. It's massive so even if you got the biggest stomach of them all, I would bet you couldn't finish the dish. Really dark spot, they have corn hole as well. The t'vs are always playing the game. Basically come here if you haven't. I love every dish on the menu."}
{"text":"Awesome food, amazing atmosphere. We had a great time talking with the bartender and some other very friendly people at the bar. The chorizo burger was perfectly seasoned and cooked. The short rib tacos...AWESOME! We will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu very soon!"}
{"text":"I'm a bar eater meaning I love sitting at the bar enjoying good conversation with my friends and the bartenders - and this place you can do just that, a great place for conversation and good food, I had the sweet chili wings and they were really good probably the best in town that I have had."}
{"text":"Best. Marty was always responsive. Food was delicious. Ambience Perf. Spoke to manager to let her know exceptional service."}
{"text":"Given that I have a crush on the Vig at all their locations, I am going to be in the camp that obviously adores them. It's nice to finally have one open in my backyard since I frequented the Arcadia location often. I can't vouch for the bar area given the reviews I read, because I prefer to eat sunshine and I can say, the patio seating is amazing. Even in July, it was comfortable but then I am a desert dweller. Always filled with mesmerizing characters and smiles are a giveaway. My new fave item is the Monte Cristo. Will not be disappointed :)"}
{"text":"I have been going to The Vig lately for Happy Hour and its always a good time.  The crowd is fun and everyone appears to be having a nice time. The Happy Hour menu is extensive and the specials are inexpensive around $6.00. I recommend the fish tacos....delicious!"}
{"text":"I am updating my review. After a terrible experience, the owner was very kind and reached out to me, so I was glad to come back and give the Vig another shot!   I arrived with my party around 5pm in front of the host stand, the host was on the phone so we were not greeted right away, a second hostess came up  and greeted us and took us to a table.   The service was wonderful! Our server Garrett was super nice and gave us some drink recommendations. My friend and I got the stolee blueberry Moscow mule and it was delicious! Her husband and my boyfriend got some beers. Drinks came out right away and our waters were constantly refilled which was great! I always have a water test at places to see how good service is. They were spot on last night. The only thing I would say is, sometimes we would get a lime in our mules and the other times we didn't get one. We each ordered 4 of those drinks, maybe the bartender was just busy and forgot the garnish?  I ordered the double down hummus dip and the boys got the wings. My friend ordered wrong and got The Trifecta which are sliders but she's a vegetarian and can't eat that. I told her I would switch dishes with her. When the food came out Garrett remembered what I ordered and asked if everything was alright, we explained to him about the mishap. He was so nice and without hesitation offered to take it back and to get the dish my friend wanted. I told him it was alright and man those sliders were great! The pretzel bun and the sauce were so delicious on the beef patty.   When the check came we were all set and the manager took initiative to come and grab it for Garrett so we didn't have to wait, which we appreciated because after 4 mules I was ready to go home for a nap!  I am happy I came back for another chance at the Vig because the food, service, and ambience is great and I hope it stays this way! Definitely would recommend this place to friends family."}
{"text":"Came in on Friday night to get the delicious famous Mac and cheese.  Mine didn't really have a whole lot of sauce on it so I requested more.  After that it was prefect.  Also had a bottle of the house red wine.  It paired very nicely."}
{"text":"I love the menu here - it's different and creative.  When the weather is good, sitting on the patio is a great choice.    When the weather is hot, the restaurant is so cold that you should bring a sweater.  I dined a number of times here this past summer and it's painfully cold, especially on the non-bar side of the restaurant.  So be forewarned.  Would I come back?  Yes, you bet I would.  Good food and good service."}
{"text":"I had tried the Vig in downtown ages ago, the McCormick is just down the street so we decided to walk here and it was awesome.  For an April day it was wildly warm and the misters were cranking thank the lord.    We ordered the Chilliritos for an appetizer...why? WhY WHY...very very very very good.   To drink I was going for something more refreshing and went with the AZ Peach Shandy.  And then came the food, across the table we had the Shrimp Pad Thai, Blackened Fish Tacos, and the Chorizo burger with an egg.  All were delicious, personally my Pad Thai was delicious and my girlfriend's Tacos as well.  Just a fun spot to walk to.  Sort of feel like it is the anchor of the area because it's really not a night life area and is deep in the interior of the strip mall."}
{"text":"Great place with a great vibe. Perfect for lunch or happy hour on the patio. Ordered apps and they were good. Service was good and really like the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Nope. That's all I can rate this place. Nope. We arrived here the other night about 720p. The first thing... a drunken lady standing square in the middle of the entrance to The Vig and a wrapped bottle of unopened wine about to roll off the bench near the entrance. Okay. Odd. The hostess looked at my friend and I strangely for looking at this swaying lady who was not more than 8 feet from her!! No one here at The Vig wanted to help this lady? Grab that wine off the bench, maybe? That looked very, 'low rent'. SO.. in and around her we walked  into The Vig. The hostess barely greeted us, and I will admit we weren't in our normal 'dining out' attire, as we had just left a spinning class from across the way, so I guess I get that we looked maybe a little seedy in our running attire? This hostess never smiled and continued to seat us on the patio without saying a word. That's where we sat.. and waited.. and waited.. ANNNNNDDD.... waited for almost 20 minutes before we finally got the bus boy, who was now to filling our waters a second time, and we asked him for a waiter. The waiter FINALLY arrived and just said, \"You guys know what you want..or you still checking it out?\" There was no apology for the wait or no drink order taken. Nope. Nada. He could have cared less. Was The Vig busy this night? No. NOW.. HAD we not been SO hungry/hangry from our hard workouts, I would have called it right then and there... and left. I have this thing about working hard for my money that I am about to spend on a meal out and I just kind of want a little bit of decent service to go with it. Clearly The Vig McCormick was just gonna fail BIG on that tonight. Not wanting this waiter to leave us again, we ordered diet sodas, lemons for the waters we had filled 3 or 4x now, (those never did arrive), and our entrees. My friends mac and cheese was less than awesome. The cheese was just pasty, for a lack of better descriptives and tasteless. It was an ample bowl and she wanted it to be great! After all.. WE had just burned tons of calories and wanted to eat! She didn't finish even half. I ordered the fish tacos, which I have had several times at The Vig. They were okay. Nothing monumental and nothing horrible. If anything, they could have been warmer. One was ice cold on the fish and I just didn't trust eating it. I did not finish mine either. It's not as though our waiter asked us if all was okay. He didn't. Our diet sodas went empty and we finally just asked the bus girl, (or she could have been another waitress), for the bill, as our waiter just wasn't showing up. We got a container for that less than mac and cheese and he saw we had a promo from the cycling place we had just been to.. NOW suddenly he wanted to chat! How transparent. So I decided at that point.. I won't be showing up here anymore either. The end. What a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"The food is really good and so are the cocktails. Everything is reasonably priced. I had the chorizo mac n cheese (which for some reason is way better at this location than the Arcadia one) Both were delicious. I'm going to have to give a 3 star though because within an hour of leaving lunch today my sister and I both got sick from the food."}
{"text":"Went here on Valentine's Day, we had a reservation set for 7:30pm and were sat immediately. Our waiter was very friendly, food was great and came out quickly. Definitely would recommend, and we'll be returning."}
{"text":"Typical bar food.....not the best, do NOT order the tater tot baked cheese appetizers....very gross and flavorless.....will not be going to this place again..... Waitress was nice though... Kelsey???"}
{"text":"Oh. My. God. Honestly, the most incredible, life changing dining experience of my life. I never knew taste combined with impeccable service could feel so.... let's face it... epic. I dined with my wife on our anniversary... let's just say my choice made me a lucky man ;-) Our server Jean truly embodied what it means to be a quality server. I came out of the night with a new friend. She had an original approach and catered to our every need without being aggressive. She engaged us in conversation without being intrusive. She was honest, down to earth and fun to be around. We will definitely be back!!! Thank you Jean and the Vig for an unforgettable night."}
{"text":"I highly recommend the glazed maple salmon entree, a fantastically flavored and well portioned slab of fish on a bed of greens and yummy butter sauce.  Of course be sure to eat the butterscotch bread pudding for dessert."}
{"text":"We stopped in during their construction phase and were sequestered enough that you couldn't even tell. The food and the service were both fantastic. We had the classic burger, the wedge salad and the mac & cheese with shrimp. We also had the chicken wings traditional style as an appetizer. Everything was very good and priced appropriately. Nice patio seating too. I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"The place is really nice. It started out fine till I received my entree. I told the bartender my ono was over cooked and dry. He said we have to cook it that way. I was taken by surprise by that comment. So instead of having the chef cook it properly he asked if I wanted something else. I ordered the pad Thai. Paid extra for shrimp. That was cooked properly and tasty but way too much tofu. My husbands fried chicken Sammy was over cooked and dry but the toppings were good. Will try again and give another try cause it's close to my new home"}
{"text":"I so badly WANT to like this place because I frequented the one in Uptown., and now that I've moved McCormick Ranch is a much shorter drive. BUT There's no comparison when it comes to environment and ambiance. I love dining outdoors, but this patio area doesn't really do it for me. The inside is kinda funky too, not open and a lot of \"hallways\" for tables. The best place to sit is probably at the bar or in that area.  Both times I went there was SLOW service. The first time was their opening weekend, so I didn't think too much of it, but the last time I was there was for Sunday Brunch, later on the afternoon, so it was not super crowded by any means, and the service was just unbearably slow. We kept wondering if she had forgotten about us.   The POSITIVE is that the food is delicious, lots of unique menu items, Bloody Mary bar is supper cool!"}
{"text":"I really want to like The Vig business. They always find a way to irritate me when I visit. Came on a slow Wednesday evening about Happy Hour time, the place was pretty slow. I had my small (well behaved) dog with me (on a very short leash).  I walk to a table on the patio in the sunshine while my friend let the hostess know that we were sitting outside. She promptly rushed out at me as if I were trying to steall the patio decor, and told me that dogs were not allowed.  I apologized and turned to leave when the manager came out and directed us to a small table at the very edge of the property. Thanks for letting us stay......... I guess.  We settled in and ordered a bottle of wine (our waitress was no help and knew little about their wine selection). Ordered the humus plate with was also \"Just ok\"  All in all.... I am still not happy with the brand after being to all the locations.   And the humus made me throw up the next morning.......   Thanks for the closure Vig."}
{"text":"The menu here is similar to the other Vig locations and the food is well up to par. However, the service here is spectacular. What could have been a horrible meal was turned into a great experience. A simple mistake with my food was fixed and then some. The staff here will make sure you are well taken care of!"}
{"text":"Glad to see the extension to the Vig is open. Went there for dinner. I ordered the \"ginger seared ono\". Fresh mushrooms & veggies, the Ono was a little tough, but enjoyable. Lean & green steak salad was good."}
{"text":"Service was wonderful around 3:30pm; happy hour meals were great.  Recommend the trifecta, guacamole, and fish tacos. Wonderful atmosphere in the patio."}
{"text":"Came here on Tuesday with a friend and I loved it! I only got a photo of our appetizers because I dug right into my steak the moment it came.   For those of you who are like me, on a low salt diet - the charcuterie board is not a safe choice. However I ordered it because I split it with my friend and I was considerably low on my salt/fluid index that day. I didn't eat the edamame just because I figured if I'm going to splurge on salt I should only splurge on one item. The steak and the fries I was able To ask for no salt and the staff was very accommodating to that! I got the demi on the side so I only used my fork to get a small flavor without all the salt. Their demi is wonderful!   I can't have caffeine so I was beyond excited when they went to look at their root beer just for me and told me it was caffeine free! They had an amazing brand which I believe is called Stewart's.   Unfortunately there was one or two negatives. One, my friends steak dish was undercooked. The inside looked more purple than it did pink. She didn't send it back though, she is shy that way. The only other negative is that if you park in the back, you have no idea where to go to get into the restaurant. (Their outdoor patio is beautiful though!!) we went in through an open door that we weren't sure if it was for staff only. From the way we came in there wasn't a hostess stand either so we felt a little awkward at first - like we came in the wrong way but we were just following MapQuest!   All in all it was an amazing meal for me and the staff was very accommodating to my health needs. I'd love to come back and sit outside on their patio, looked amazing!"}
{"text":"Wow. This place is very close to my house and I had no idea it was there. Marty (our bartender/server) was awesome. Amazing food. Amazing atmosphere. Amazing drinks. This will definitely be my new spot."}
{"text":"Met a buddy at the Vig McCormick Ranch for lunch.  Plenty of parking and easy to find just off McCormick Parkway and Hayden near LA Fitness.  The Vig has two outdoor patios with misters so despite the warm weather we opted to have lunch on the back patio under some nice shady umbrellas.  Great open atmosphere.  The service was quick and our waiter was attentive and very polite.  I had the blackened fish tacos and my friend had the Prime Vig Dip.  The fish tacos were tasty with a nice Cabo style sauce, salsa, chopped cabbage on soft corn tortillas.  The Prime Rib Dip was listed as medium rare on the menu but was served medium to well done.  Fairly common problem with lunch entries of this type.  My friend was o.k. with it but way to overcooked for my taste.  Served on a pretzel bun with sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"Love the food and the service...just as great as their locations on 40th & Indian School and 16th & Bethany Home. However, the acoustics aren't the greatest, and even when the place isn't full, it can get ridiculously noisy, even on the patio."}
{"text":"By far my favorite place to eat and get drinks with my beautiful girlfriend. I've been to all locations dozens of times and am so excited for the new McCormick location near my house. Will always recommend this place first to anybody who doesn't know where to eat and have a fun time. Hats off to you"}
{"text":"MAKE THE VIG GREAT AGAIN! I live 5 minutes from this location.  I will most likely never return unless it is assured that the staff can produce the good food, service and atmosphere that the Vig is supposed to be known for.  It has greatly declined over the past year. Food is only fair if the kitchen is not busy.  Sitting at the bar assures I will get drinks timely- but again- the food is not good.  Many excuses are made by staff on behalf of the kitchen.   Although business shows up during March- Spring training etc.  slow season is upon us.  The volume of customers won't be there making up for lack of repeat business.   Most important for the management to know is this- there are approximately 3,600 residents of McCormick Ranch that use Nextdoor. (There are over 7,000 residents ) This is a neighborhood on-line communication tool.  Yesterday someone sent a message about never returning to your location. There are an additional 28 replies that concur that they also will never be back.  This is such a shame. It truly comes down to a poorly run kitchen and poor management.     This review is intended to get the attention of the Management / Owners...  I will be happy to share what people are writing."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I live very close by and wanted to go some where when he got off work to grab some food. We  went on a Saturday night around 10:00 pm .. They had bar seating and limited menu options. That's fine, but what shocked us was the which music playing. This classy new resturant basically goes to crap after 10:00 obviously. They had non stop rap music playing... I must of heard the N word more in two hours then in my life time. Seriously very disturbing!!!!!! I don't know if if they just screw off at night or change managers or what?"}
{"text":"I went with 2 friends for happy hour and received  the worst service I ever have had.  Waited 20 minutes for someone to take our order and finally we were able to find someone to flag down. When we were waiting for service , a couple across from us were seated and a waitress came in 5 minutes.   Their food arrived in 15 minutes and we still were waiting for ours.  We requested a manager when we saw this and she said sorry and we will take care of you.  Another manage came to our table and said the same. We only ordered food and by taking care of us meant only $1.80 taken off from each bill. .  The tip to the waiter was $2.40. He was nice and came to our rescue.  They ended up losing customers so I really want to give the Vig 0 stars."}
{"text":"I tried this place a second time after having brunch on Sunday that was pretty much inedible. Ordered the special which was fire cracker shrimp tacos with a cole slaw side. Why would a restaurant work so hard to do the worst job possible. I can't believe they have ever tried to make shrimp tacos before. How do they stay in business?"}
{"text":"The Vig is a great addition to the McCormick Ranch neighborhood.  The bar and patio are great and the energy level beats oat nearby locations.  We have been to the new location twice.  The first time was great and the Prime Rib dip is highly recommended.  The second visit was less memorable.  The chicken in both dishes we ordered (Pad Thai and the Chicken Avocado sandwich) were the driest I have ever tasted.  The chicken in both dishes tastes pre-cooked.  Hoping that they will make adjustments in the future - for now, I would steer clear of the dishes.   All in all, a great place that may need to time to work through menu kinks."}
{"text":"The Vig is usually a really good place. I was so disappointed today with my lunch. $13 for Chipotle wings that I didn't even like. Hopefully they'll take them off the menu."}
{"text":"It was our 1st time and definitely not our last. Came in for dinner and thoroughly enjoyed everything we had. Started our meal with the bacon wrapped dates appetizer, unique combination and extremely tasty. My wife had the spicy salmon meal which was perfectly prepared. I had the Big Bowl of Posole, which truly was big and generous enough to be a filling meal. The soup was full of flavor and had the right amount of heat to make it not to spicy. Our wait staff person was friendly, competent and not the least bit overbearing. We shall return!"}
{"text":"Sunday build-your-own bloody mary bar with lots of great options, and good brunch items. Love the decor."}
{"text":"The Vig in McCormick Ranch captures the essence of the Southwest all in one plate. I especially appreciated the interior design and open layout of the restaurant. The Mexican American inspired dishes that I had the chance to sample were all delicious. I recommend the Encanto Enchiladas, laced in a zesty tomatillo sauce and crema accompanied by over easy eggs. I also adored their Guinness braised corned beef hash with chipotle hollandaise and potato pancakes.   Quality food, a comfortable atmosphere and an alert staff are all reasons why I'll be coming back to dine here."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks, great atmosphere, friendly service and almost always a bit of a crowd.  A terrific addition to the neighborhood and an excellent example of a VIg restaurant.  We've been here a few times with large parties, and the service, food, drinks and atmosphere are terrific.  The place is super cute (really interesting architecture/layout, typical of a Vig), and the patios are really nice.  It's a bit on the loud side, and tends to be busy, so if you're trying to run in and out, it's not your best bet.  But, for a fun night out, it's perfect!  This location is really close to our house, so we pick up veggie burgers, fish tacos, mac n cheese, and various other pescetarian-friendly options on a regular basis.  They really know how to pack em, and they've never messed up an order (I always ask for small modifications, and they always nail it).  The one time it was excessively delayed, they comped half of it and gave a genuine apology - really classy move."}
{"text":"Very good food! Service was so-so. Hostesses were great but our server seemed to not care. He did give us a good military discount, which made the meal end on a good note! Love this restaurant!"}
{"text":"We came in on a Wednesday afternoon for a quick glass of wine and maybe an appetizer, but we had such a great time we stayed quite a bit longer. Tracy was so wonderful and welcoming from the beginning. She quickly greeted us and made sure that we were we'll taken care of the entire time. Her energy was addicting. We will definitely be back to see Tracy!"}
{"text":"After driving by this location for months and meaning to get in and try it out I finally made the time to stop in with my boss for a late lunch.  Neither of us drink so I can't speak to how good the bar is but the appetizer we chose was the guacamole and salsa which were both amazingly flavorful.  Both were empty by the time the food arrived.  I had the fish tacos and my boss had the spicy maple glazed salmon.  He devoured the salmon and I loved the tacos. I would definitely recommend both.  For dessert we tried what our server (who was also a bartender) suggested which was the banana cream pie in a mason jar and I could not stop eating it.  Delicious and very satisfying. If you're in the mood for a delicious lunch or dinner The Vig is definitely one to frequent.  I will be back to try their other menu offerings."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Sat on the patio and enjoyed a mimosa and bloody mary. The bloody was decent but he mimosa was perfect, plenty of bubbles.   I had the black bean burger without dairy products (vegan). AMAZING! Sweet potato fries were bomb as well.   Attentive enough staff. Friendly and helpful when asking questions."}
{"text":"Just ordered the enchiladas w an egg  The bar tender said NO brunch is over I asked can't u at least ask she said NO!!!  Btw the guy next to me is eating enchiladas w a fried egg;("}
{"text":"Another great installation from the Vig people!  This one feels a bit more cozy and intimate than the original in Arcadia, less hipster than the Fillmore, and just a bit less neighborhood than the Uptown spot ... but its still the Vig!  My guy and I went in around 7pm on a Sunday recently.  There was no wait and probably more than half the place was empty.  We were seated promptly in one of the BIG booths inside the bar area, which was perfect for us.  Those booths could easily hold 6 people, so we were swimming in arm room.  ;)  The sever mentioned right away that Sundays were half off wine by the bottle, so that settled WHAT we'd be drinking, but started a discussion on WHICH we'd be drinking.  They have a good wine list with quite a few options, and we settled on a Zinfandel that was really nice (especially for under $20 a bottle).  For food, we decided to start with the hummus duo appetizer.  It came out really quickly and the breads, veggies and both flavors of hummus were on point. We then moved on to entrees.  I got a salad that had grilled shrimp, fingerling potatoes, kale, celery leaves, radishes and a vinaigrette (gluten-free and vegan)... It was delicious!  My guy had the short rib tacos (3 to a plate) and was also impressed.  They had a nice kick with the spice level, so maybe not a recommendation for those sensitive to heat.  After the appetizer, he could only eat 2 of the tacos, so one was packaged in a to go box.  It also happened to be his birthday and when I mentioned it to the server, he was cool enough to buy the b-day boy a dessert on the house!  He ended up with their take on a Mississippi mud pie, which came in a Mason jar, complete with a candle.  I managed to steal a bite when he wasn't looking and can confirm that dessert is all sorts of chocolately goodness!  All in all, good experience.  Place was clean, service was prompt and friendly, prices were fair. They have tvs in the bar and ample patio space, and something on the menu for pretty much anyone!"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout while on a trip to Scottsdale to help my son move home for summer from ASU.  We were at the Woldmark around the corner, it was 10pm, we were sunburned and set to drive home at 5am the next morning.  So, enter The Vig to save the day.  My husband got the shrimp Pad Thai-it was so delicious the \"I'm not that hungry so just skip me\" (I know him better) hubs only shared one tiny bite and scarfed thevrest-veggies were packed in separate container for freshness (cilantro, peanuts, lime wedges, sprouts, etc).  The pad Thai was still steaming hot, fresh, packed with flavor, perfect portion size.  I didn't get a shrimp which means they were too delicious to share.  My son got the short rib sandwich. Devoured it! No bites for mom. Onion rings were delicious (so I'm told).    I had the bacon/blue burger. Bun and meats were really great but I'd have liked more bleh cheese (it had melted into bun) and some sort of aioli. The braised in wine or balsamic onions were flavorful but not enough to make up for the lack of bleu cheese flavor I was craving.dint get me wrong, it was still great, but I probably would ask for bleu cheese on side for takeout so you could put it on hot burger right before eating.  Side was hard choice-all were tempting.  But I got Mac & cheese which was good.  Phone ordering was a breeze! Never had been there before, found via yelp.  Friendly, accurate, helpful!  Drove the 3 minutes to back of strip mall (not visible from street) and what a cool place.  I found where all the locals hang out! Scottsdale, the area I was in, seemed to close up too early, it was so lovely to hear the music, laughter, chatter of folks enjoying the evening on the front patio.  Next time I'll plan on eating-in.  I planned on having a cold beer while waiting for the food.  It was already ready, but the friendly bartender poured me a delicious and super cold Stella Artois while he rang me up and efficiently processed my payment.  The decor of bar was unexpectedly comfy and inviting, cool, dark, funky, clean, upscale for a suburban sports bar vibe.  Music was great, TVs had sports on, friendly regulars were finishing up and really enjoying themselves.  Tits great to know of this place who is likely one of the only non-fast food restaurants with a late night menus designed to please everyone's craving-from the more expected hamburgers, chicken sandwiches, appetizers, to the various Asian-inspired dishes, etc., all seem to be based on fresh, flavorful comfort food type dishes at a fair price and elevated level of quality.  We ate at a few really yummy places while there so I wasn't expecting to be impressed by anything else, just fed.  It was certainly a nice surprise to be wowed by yet another really great local Phoenix area restaurant."}
{"text":"The best pozole in town.  We agree!!  We had a late lunch here on Friday.  We ordered   grilled fish taco: very good 4.5 stars guacamole, salsa, and chips: 3.5 stars pozole: 5 stars artichoke kale and jalapeno dip: 5 stars really good.   peach shandy: 5 stars.   They use real cheese for the artichoke dip, which seems rare nowadays.  Most everything we ordered was super good.  We had a great time.  Vibe here is fun.  Service is very good.  Update: pozole reheated for breakfast on the stove tastes just as good."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! The food and drinks never disappoint. The mac n cheese app or fondue are amazing! I've also had the fish tacos, a few of the sandwiches and salads. The atmosphere is fun and casual and it's usually very packed. I always bring my friends and out of town guests here bc I enjoy this place so much. It's a must try."}
{"text":"The Vig is one of my all time favorite restaurants here in Phoenix. Their food selection is wonderful and you cannot go wrong with any choice. I love their burgers and wings and their mac and cheese is to die for."}
{"text":"Three of us were in today around 1pm. Sitting at the bar, we ordered food and beers.  The bar manager stopped in and decided to help, she was great. The small bartender with the dark hair...not good. She definitely has the \"oh shiny\" syndrome. The guy working, awesome, and clearly picking up her huge amount of slack.   We would have stayed longer and  had a much larger tab if he could have been our full time bartender. Shame the one bartender ruined it for us, it was a nicely designed place with a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a great lunch on the patio. Service fabulous and a wonderful atmosphere to enjoy lunch or dinner with a small or large group. We had the turkey sandwich and the black bean burger. Both were made to perfection. If you want to change it up, try the grilled cauliflower instead of fries."}
{"text":"I'd give it a Big Fat Zero if I could! Tried to get in 4 times to sit at the bar. Tried different times and days but Nooooo! The snotty hostesses-which by now after 4 tries believe they take a course in this behavior- were indifferent, and were more interested in talking about their own lives them tending to those waiting!   So each time I dutifully waited to get two seats for me and my friend whiles others would come in after me and cut in -disregarding the fact that I'd been waiting - so I quietly would ask the host if they could politely say something but each time they just told at me there was nothing they could do! Are you kidding me? I'm waiting 10, 15, 20 minutes and rather than confront or police the situation myself I thought the hosts would help but it seems they relished the fact that I was in this predicament !  So NEVER again! Besides the menu, crowd, staff and location aren't all that . Not worth the time or effort !! Too many great places one can go around town!!!"}
{"text":"5 stars for service alone! i was first in our group to arrive so i sat at the bar. the bartender introduced himself by name and kept tabs on MY name. novel idea!   so for our going away party for a fellow co-worker, we had over 20 people show up. 20!!! and the server offered to actually make separate checks. it was incredible how she kept it all under control, kept the cocktails, food, and water coming at a quick click. nary a complaint. i tipped well. she deserved it.   beer selection is good as is the cocktail selection. excellent happy hour deals. 4 fish tacos for 6.5 bucks...and they're good!   great atmosphere, best service in a long time!"}
{"text":"The Vig's newest location is located in the McCormick ranch part of town, thus the name. I went after the lunch crowd and at the start of Happy Hour, so it was kinda quiet. The crowd there is a little older, perhaps more laid back than the hipsters at the other Vig locations.  Nevertheless, the have a good craft beer selection and a decent Happy Hour menu to satisfy. I went with the fish tacos with were outstanding. Good place to chill."}
{"text":"Came here for a last brunch with friends as my husband and I were leaving the state for new jobs.  The food was Good and the drinks were Good. My friends Monte Cristo was not deep fried as he would have liked. Battered and deep fried!  The service was only average, the waiter kept forgetting secondary re orders. The ambiance is Great weather permitting."}
{"text":"GREAT atmosphere, really awesome energy.  Food sucks.  Salmon medium was a joke and was recommended by waiter,  I only choked down a 1/2 a fork, passed on the rest it was that bad.  Portion size was 1/4 of what you would expect , but didn't matter as I ate a 1/2 forkful and waiter didn't care.  I hope they get it right."}
{"text":"Had a great early dinner. Steak salad was delicious. Bartender made an excellent lemon drop martini and server, Chris, was so friendly and personable.  I will be back!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"A year ago the Vig would have easily gotten 5.0 in my book.  I am primarily writing this for to owners to let them know that my rating has slowly sank to a 3.5.   Both the menu items and the quality has gone down.  We miss the old fish tacos, old short rib tacos, the deconstructed fish tacos... Replaced with the bruschetta which I can not recommend?  The same would go with the drink menu ... Now I just stick with a rum and coke.  As a side note, service and atmosphere have always been phenomenal, which brings this review back up to four stars.  I've never had bad service, including our server tonight, Richard, who would be six stars!"}
{"text":"I live in Troon, stopped by after work with a friend for the first time. I liked the environment the service was good but both of us did not like the food. I had fish tacos she had a turkey sandwich.  There is really nothing to say about the flavor or freshness. I actually went to the grocery store afterwards because I was still craving something tasty. The food for both of us was on the bland side.  if you are there just for drinks it is great but there is need to step up the menu and come up with something to talk about."}
{"text":"It strikes you as a nice lounge-slide up to the bar and unwind after work or grab a table for some face to face convo.  But I stopped in for a lunch after a flight to PHX, and needed something to tide me over until a massive dinner.   I ordered the Tuna Nicoise Salad, which uses fresh Ahi tuna, seared tataki style, with a mixture of greens. I was not expecting tuna that good and a blend of veggies and crunchies that make this a memorable salad.   Also, I ordered an iced tea, or \"sweet tea\" in American. Normally a restaurant will serve you an unsweetened iced tea and then have you add sugar that can't dissolve in the cold liquid. I asked for a liquid sweetener and the waiter obliged happily with a shit glass of simple syrup.  Simply great!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to this Vig along with the one on 40th st. We love both! We've never had a bad experience at all and we do a lot of brunches here with our friends. The Posole is the best thing I've ever had and its a must try! I'd recommend any Vig location as they all seem to be spot on!"}
{"text":"Great place for food and drink as long as there are no kids running around. It's not that I don't like kids, but when I see them racing all over the place and parents just allowing it, not my idea of a good time. Food and Service are up to standard with the other locations!!"}
{"text":"Probably the best service I have had in a while. Went to the bar to have a couple drinks with the wife, and Johnathon was absolutely amazing, attentive,  kind, and enjoyable. and the drinks were absolutely delicious! We will definitely be going back again, if not for just the service."}
{"text":"The server was great. The drinks delicious. Salsa was yummy. My salad was terrible.  When I was being walked to my table my heel caught a slick spot and I fell flat on my backside. HARD. It really hurt. One of the servers helped me up and the hostess told me to buy some product from Aldo for my shoes because their floors are super slippery. Gee. Thanks, figured that out.  I was pretty annoyed that a manager did not stop by to make sure I was ok. I mean isn't that the proper thing to do? I guess I'm lucky I walked out with just a bruised bottom and bruised ego. I wasn't looking for a comp'd meal, just some concern.  ***Update***  The owner contacted me, a real class act. I have been back and was very happy with the overall experience."}
{"text":"I gotta say I was expecting more from reading the previous reviews. We got the nachos which were quite large and had a very generous portion of guacamole but were just kinda boring. The Mac and cheese was a big let down. A small step up from velveeta :( The service started out fine but once we didn't order anything from the bar our server disappeared only to deliver our meal and then our check, nothing more. Bummer, I live right by here but I probably won't become a frequent visiter."}
{"text":"Had my first experience at The Vig McCormick, one of 3 locations in the metroplex.  I came away with mixed feelings. The food was not bad (tuna bowl). As gastropubs go, this is definitely not a cut above the rest. Service is spotty and the temperature inside was rather warm.  They do have a bunch of outdoor seating but somewhat limited inside. Also at 5 pm in the evening to not have misters outside is asking a bit much in this area's 100+ temps.  I think I will give it another shot to see if it was just an off day or par for the course."}
{"text":"Having a FANTASTIC Friday night! Great location, creative cocktails, excellent service. Thank you Vig, for being closer, greater and so much more fun!!!!"}
{"text":"Went after a spring training game on a Saturday and were seated outside. Atmosphere was fun, weather was great, they were able to accommodate or group (5 ppl).The hummus and chips/guac/salsa appetizers were really good. The lamb (add on to hummus) was dry, but everything else was good. The chardonnay was chilled just right and the greyhound I ordered was fresh."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in here after seeing a movie.    We had the ribs off the happy hour menu and the nachos off the regular.   Thelma was our server.  Very friendly, professional and efficient.  Decided on a manhattan as my drink.   The ribs and nachos were out in a flash.   WOW!  The nacho order was huge!   Guacamole on top with a swirl of something white, which I was told was sour cream, plenty of cheese, chicken, jalapenos, tomatoes included.  The ribs were fall-off-the bone great.  It was accompanied by what I believe to be ranch dressing.   The nachos were flavorful with its chicken, cheese, and every third or so bite, the jalapenos with the chopped tomatoes thrown in.  My manhattan was perfect.   I'm glad they put in the dark cherries versus the maraschinos.     I don't know.   Maraschino cherries just don't seem to go with a manhattan.  We ate all of the ribs and probably about a fourth of the nachos.   I thought the chips would be soggy the next day.   Maybe a little, but still somewhat crisp.     I usually go to The Vig on 16 St.   I LOVE their mac and cheese with grilled chicken.   YUMMMM!!  Plenty of cheese.  Yepp.   I'll be back."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with coworkers on a Tuesday. This place continues to be just okay for me, but I was a bit perturbed by my waitress when it came to ordering drinks.   I peaked at the taps on my way to the restroom so I knew what to order when she came by. They had Green Flash Soul Style on tap so I was set. I ordered it and she explained to me that it was \"Sour Style.\" I asked, \"Is that a thing? It's not Soul style? Because it looked just like the Soul style logo.\" She echoed that it was, in fact, \"Sour Style.\" I asked, \"So, it's a sour beer?\" And she confirmed that as true so I ordered something different. I later double-checked the bar because maybe it was something new and the logo was just similar. It wasn't. It was the Soul Style IPA as I had thought.   I'm just disappointed that my server didn't check to make sure she wasn't mistaken. Having worked in the industry, I would've been a little more knowledgeable of the beers on tap and if the customer thought something different, I would've taken a second look. I realize Tuesday lunch is probably your C-squad, but still unacceptable.  Also, one of my tacos was really sad. The food prep was rushed so only three of the four were properly dressed and the fish on that fourth one was a third or less the size of the others. It was like that stupidly small Chick-fil-A chicken nugget that you're pissed about counting as a chicken nugget in your 8-pack. Maybe there is only supposed to be three and they just added a half-assed fourth because of an extra small piece of fish? I don't know. Regardless, presentation is important and that was a whiff.  As usual, I hoped for better."}
{"text":"Nice place to hang out and grab some food and drink.  I like to sit at the bar.  My favorite is the hot chick chicken sandwich.  I love their skinny crispy fries."}
{"text":"Thursday happy hour review to follow--  Stopped in for happy hour with some coworkers while traveling for business. We ordered the chips and guacamole, the wings, the sliders, and an order of mac and cheese. The food was average, decently priced, the service was slow considering that the business wasn't very busy.  They really need to step up their game, the tourists are leaving and the dry, hot season is coming!"}
{"text":"This place is simply outstanding. The food is terrific and the servers are amazing. We have returned several times and on all occasions, the food and service is 5 stars. . I would highly recommend this Vig location!!"}
{"text":"The Vig has done it again. The new McCormick Ranch location brings the same good vibe, appealing decor, tasty food, a nice selection of drinks, and friendly service to the neighborhood, as it has done in a few other Greater Phoenix locations."}
{"text":"I usually enjoy The Vig, however, the first time I ate at the McCormick location, I was severely disappointed. My previous experiences at the other branches have all been pleasant, good food, fast and kind service. However when I first arrived at the McCormick location, I felt like my presence was an annoyance to the hostess, who barely greeted us and led us to our seats without so much as a eye glance. This was also the case of our server, who clearly felt like she had better things to be doing. I was hoping the food would make up for the lack of interest from the staff, however once I received our food (our normal order at the other locations, The Prime Rib Dip, maple glazed salmon and the Crispy Calamari), we found the food to be under seasoned, lackluster and overall less tasty as compared to the Arcadia location. I would've complained about the food, especially the calamari, which was limp and soggy despite me asking for it to be EXTRA crispy, but our server did not come to ask us how things were until she was ready with our check. I am bummed about my experience, as it has been generally positive at the other location."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this restaurant and I live in the area. The patio and restaurant are attractive, the staff is friendly and the service was great. However, I ordered the hamburg and it came overcooked and dry, The onion rings were horrible, there was so much grease I could not eat them. My friend had the cobb salad and liked that. In my opinion this place is very so-so."}
{"text":"Mixed review. The atmosphere and setting is just perfect for brunch.  The service: negligent and pretentious. Our server took 13 min to take our order and then never checked back until he asked me if I needed a box. Thing is my sandwich was incorrect, so I was waiting to let him know.  I still ate some of it but then decided to leave rather than wait for another 25 min.   Food was okay, not better than the cool brunch spots down the road in old town Scottsdale.  I wouldn't come back,  but if you end up here, bring a friend you don't mind talking to cause you'll be waiting."}
{"text":"The family and I stopped by The VIG for a mid afternoon drink and snack before the ASU graduation ceremony. Service was just ok and the food came in several different servings rather than all at once, which was odd due to the restaurant being almost entirely empty.   I would return, if presented with this option over a different unknown entity, but there are better options in the Scottsdale area for this price range."}
{"text":"Everything is always great here. From the service to the food to the fun employees to the decor.  It's just awesome."}
{"text":"I was very bummed about my visit today. This review is going to be strictly on the horrible service we received. This was my first time at this location. I took my grandma here for lunch on Saturday. We sat on the patio since it was so nice out.   We seated our self and was greeted by our server Alex. He was very quite and not very personable. Asked us what we wanted to drink. We were fine with water and I asked to put in a order of the hot vings. And thank god I did! Another person brought out the appetizer and they were delicious. But the server never came back out for 30minutes. We didn't even place our order for food yet and we were completely out of water. If it wasn't for the appetizer we would of walked out. All the tables outside were talking  about where the heck the server went and we all needed something. We ended up waving down random employees trying to get some service. A server came out to the table next to us and offered free alcohol drinks for the service but then ran inside without acknowledging any other table outside that were having the same issues. The table next to us even walked out, they either didn't pay or payed the hostess because they never got their bill.   After the 30minutes the server Alex finally came outside and said are you ready to order. Are you kidding! Didn't even apologize or care at all. We ordered food and it was good as always but I'm still shocked at the service today. As expected the server never checked back asking how the food was or if we needed anything. He only came back at the end to give us our bill. Any refills of water we received was from other employees beside or actual server.   I will probably not come back to this location because of this service today. It's a bummer because I really do enjoy their food and was embarrassed I took my grandma here raving about it and it was a huge let down!"}
{"text":"We visited on a slow Monday afternoon around 3, one of only three groups of customers in the whole restaurant. We had a few questions about the cocktails, and the waitress claimed to have not tried them and can't answer our questions because the menu was too new. As we were waiting on our cocktails, we hear the bartenders talking loudly about how they do not know how to make the drinks from their cocktail menu. As we were eating our guac and chips, I got a bite of something hard that was not guacamole- but instead the top of the avocado (see picture). Service was slow and unfriendly, and while the food was good, I will likely not be back to this location. It's disappointing compared to the great service I've received at the downtown location."}
{"text":"Last two times I have been here the food has been sub par.  The salsa was watery and had no flavor. My fried chicken sandwich was literally black/burnt.  Which means the oil needs to be changed out.  Friends hamburger was supposed to be med well and it was burnt.  Chicken fingers also over cooked.  Manager didn't agree but I have worked in several restaurants and it is apparent that the oil needed to be changed.  The waiter was very sympathetic and agreed.. it really is disappointing when management doesn't see the issues."}
{"text":"My brother and his family recently moved to town and have been looking for great places to eat out. We suggested The Vig because there is always great tasting food in a fun atmosphere. My wife and I have been to The Vig at other locations but this was our first experience at the Scottsdale location. It lived up to all the expectations we had! What a great place to entertain. I got us started with the nachos as an appetizer and my sister in law said it was the best nachos she has ever had. The chorizo burger was on point, very juicy and cooled to perfection. We took a 6 week old and a 2 year old and they were very accommodating to the family, despite the bar like atmosphere. Would recommend to anyone as a \"go to\" favorite!"}
{"text":"BACKGROUND   The Vig has 4 locations in Phoenix: Arcadia Fillmore McCormick Uptown  This was my first visit to the McCormick location, to have casual drinks and snacks with some friends.   AMBIANCE   The Vig McCormick has a super sophisticated vibe with a gorgeous main bar, as well as a comfortable, flowing seating area. (see pic)  SERVICE EXPERIENCE   The staff were all extremely attentive, without being intrusive. There was never a time where any of us were out of a drink or were searching for a server, but we didn't feel hounded either. The perfect wait staff that can anticipate without interrupting is unfortunately rare these days.  THE MENU   The food was amazing. The Vig has a very original and creative menu. My favorite is the vanilla braised short rib tacos.   The Menu:  Appetizers Artichoke Kale Jalape√±o Dip Steamed Edamame Guacamole & Chips Flatbreads Nachos Hot Wings  Salads Sandwiches  Burgers  Mains: Vanilla Braised Short Rib Tacos Fish Tacos Mac n Cheese Grilled Salmon Pad Thai  Desserts  CONCLUSION   4/5 RECOMMEND   OF NOTE  *There is plenty of parking out front.   *Hours: Sat/Sun 10am - 2am Mon - Thur 11am - 2am  *For more information: thevig.us"}
{"text":"We went to The Vig on recommendation from our real estate agent. She had been gushing about the place, so we decided to check it out tonight around 6:30pm.   Despite it already seeming pretty busy we were seated right away on the patio. It was a very windy evening but the architecture blocked out heavy gusts.  Our server, Amanda, was very prompt and helpful. We started with the Trifecta (sliders and fries) which came with a very tasty mustard/cheese type dip. For dinner we had the pad thai with chicken and big bowl of pizole. They are not kidding when they say big bowl! We also had a basic  moscow mule and coug cup for drinks, both of which were made very well. It was a pretty dark restaurant but the lighting did not detract from our experience.  Given the great service, good food, and nice atmosphere, we will certainly go back.  Also, there was an adorable kitty cat that seems to have taken up residence at the restaurant. We certainly support this!"}
{"text":"The service was excellent and the food was even better! We had the veggie burger and it was one of the best we have had. Great spot to relax or have a party the outside patio is beautiful and the Tv's are a great add on."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch with a client and got seated in a booth right away! Lunch special was a fabulous BLT with sugared bacon, garden fresh tomatoes, no mayo and some delicious bread and greens! Best BLT both my guest and I have ever had and served with some great sides-sweet potato fries or home made coleslaw. This was not your Grandma's BLT-modern twist with the greens and no mayo! Great service and an all around fun lunch! Love the wine cellar feel of the place with the natural stone, bank of wine storage at one end of the bar behind glass and big, comfortable booths with natural wood tables. An \"10\" for experience and food!"}
{"text":"Chose The Vig for a birthday dinner for 9.  Christian was our server.  He started out ok but then forgot us.  We had to find him for service.  We asked for a birthday dessert that never came so we got our check and went elsewhere for it.  And the busser spilled a bunch of fries at my feet and never cleaned them up.  It was a very disappointing \"birthday\" dinner."}
{"text":"This was a great experience.  I sat at the bar and the bartender Sandy was awesome.  She made great suggestions and came to check on me often.  The manager Stuart was very nice and asked abt my visit and was very accommodating.  I will most definitely come back!  I recommend the guac, it is the best here!!"}
{"text":"I love the vig. Everything was perfect except that after my party had paid for their lunch the server did not fill the waters or drinks again. It would have been nice. Staff was always nice and helpful. I am definitely going back!  GF options for +$2.00!"}
{"text":"I have never been here but for years, this restaurant mistakingly calls my number around 3-4 times per month, sometimes multiple times per day, and then immediately hanging up when I answer the phone. I have tried calling back, speaking to management, and to figure out what is going on. They consistently deny that this is happening. Either they are too stupid to dial the correct number, or their phone system is used by a robocall system. Whatever the reason, they need to sort this out."}
{"text":"Loving the available quick service. Fish tacos ... uh, yum! Trifecta ... boom  The lengthy comments that yelp wants, annoying"}
{"text":"We come here a decent amount. Love the food and the late night menu always great! Kudos to the kitchen staff! The few times we have sat at the bar have also always been amazing great experiences. The bartenders are very personable and clearly know how to make a great drink and make a great drink even better. However there have been a few times we have sat in the servers section later in the night and I am kind of disappointed. The first time we came we asked for our wing sauce on the side, the sauce didn't come on the side, we let our server know but that It was ok maybe he was having an off night. As a server myself I get It. But every time since we have gone always ask for the sauce of the side still never right. The service has been slow and impersonal. Wish I. Could tell you our servers name but he never told us. And if It weren't for the great food from the kitchen and the awesome bartenders we probably wouldn't be back"}
{"text":"I asked how big the side of Mac and cheese was specifically because I was afraid of this. There might be... MIGHT BE... two bites in this \"side\" of Mac and cheese. What a joke."}
{"text":"Wonderful place.  Good menu.  Ambiance is very inviting.  Our server Alex was attentive and friendly.  The food was wonderful.  The steak salad was awesome.  Pad Thai was great.  But the macaroni and cheese was to die for.   This is a fabulous comfortable neighborhood place to which I will return."}
{"text":"Our new fav! We just started going here about once a week for the past few months and have tried weekend evenings and midweek happy hour. Every time we try something new. Great dishes are the rib tacos and Vig burger and sides are large. The onion rings are to die for. Calamari isn't over breaded and the steak salad is excellent. We haven't tried everything yet but the nachos look like a meal for four. The service has been top notch every single time and the atmosphere isn't loud so you can have a nice conversation.   The large patio has heaters so you don't even know your outside, and a cozy fireplace with TVs to watch the game. Parking is easy but part of the front patio view is the parking lot which is a downer. They are remodeling so maybe that will change.   Glad to have this place so close as it's a no brainer, easy to get in and out, and a reliable place to take out of town guests for a great meal that's NOT in Old Town."}
{"text":"Several of us were staying down the street for a business function and we decided to try this place for dinner. I'm glad we did! The ambiance was nice but not pretentious and the staff was friendly and helpful. The menu is a bit limited but there is still something for everyone. I ordered the Poke Bowl and it was really good. Prices are also very reasonable. Glad we tried this place."}
{"text":"Went here late at night, about 11pm. We had the sliders with sweet potato fries and the burger from the happy hour menu. The sliders were a little dry, but the burger was very juicy. The sweet potato fries were AMAZING, and also came with curry sauce and ketchup which was great. Banana bread pudding dessert was HUGE, so definitely something to share. Service was great."}
{"text":"The food wasn't bad, but there was a bunch of hair in our mac n cheese and French fries. One of the hairs was about a foot long. Gnarly. We didn't ask for a refund or anything, I just wanted to write this in hopes someone talks to the kitchen staff. We found at least four hairs."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was fun but a little loud inside. Food was incredible and service was good, our server had several other tables but seemed to have a lot of support, good staff"}
{"text":"Thank you to \"The Vig\" owner for personally contacting me regarding my complaint of the service fee on \"to go\" orders. They have taken the service fee off for good- WOOT!!   Incredible customer service, I'm a loyal customer from here on out."}
{"text":"The VIG!!! I love you!!! I love everything about you! I love your door. I love the dim lighting. But most of all, I love your carnitas nachos. I more than love them. I think about them all the time. They are the best nachos in the Western Hemisphere. Go here. Get the nachos if nothing else. I also loved my entree but I'd rather eAt two orders of nachos. Just moved to AZ and this is my favorite spot so far and I'm a total FOODIE."}
{"text":"This is a nice neighborhood restaurant. Food is average but not much flavor or texture. Atmosphere and service is great.  Priced well."}
{"text":"We go to the vig all the time in Arcadia. We were up here walking the trail and were in desperate need of some liquids. We asked for three lemonades (for me, my husband, and stepson.) The hostess came right out and gave them to us-- on the house. Amazing service and incredibly generous!!!!"}
{"text":"The Vig Chorizo Burger is awesome! On my current pay grade, I usually can't afford to eat lunch at a place like this, but I happened to have an opportunity to eat here with some coworkers (for an off-site team meeting) and our boss generously paid the bill. I'll have to start saving up so I can go back!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch with 3 other people. Server was great. The chips and guacamole were very good. The \"hot chick\" sandwich was average and a little small for $12. One person got the Mac and Cheese, it was large and they said it was good. Overall it was good, but with a lot of other options nearby, I probably won't rush back."}
{"text":"After I submitted my review the management team contacted me, letting me know that they had taken my comments seriously and implemented a change in how they staff the lunch hour. The generously sent a gift card, and with that, my co-workers and I went back two different times at lunch and noticed the difference in service.  I really appreciate the desire to correct the customer service issue, and that they took it seriously enough to ensure I would come back. I can only say good things about this location and the management. We now come in almost on a weekly basis for lunch."}
{"text":"I was in town shooting a comercial . I have to say the service was 10/10 thanks to Thelma she knew exactly what to recommend and was checking on the table every 10-15 minutes . I ordered the posole which is highly recommended and the crispy chicken sandwich . I highly recommend this place . The service Thelma provided will definitely make me want to come back ."}
{"text":"My boy and. I called around 9:30 to make sure kitchen was still willing to make food for us( we hate being storming in last min demanding food).   Nice ambience, and server was super friendly, though maybe kitchen was a lil angry at us because they served a sort of dry steak and their prime rib priztle bun was completely burnt on top .   The fries were good, prime rib is interesting but I could only taste then burnt bitterness so I can't say much :( Still cool looking place , we didn't say anything as coming in late already anyways on Tuesday night so I took off the entire top and bottom off, probably won't be back for food.    Server was attentive , friendly so I'd give 5 star if only on service ."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have tried and tried and tried to like this place.  It is walking distance from his apartment and we thought, this is great we can take a quick walk and have a local place to grab drinks and food; however, it has been a huge disappointment.  The crowd is typical uptight Scottsdale folk, no casual vibe here but what's really terrible is the service.    Last night, the hostess had her back turned to us before she even dropped the menu on the table.  After five minutes our drink order was finally taken and THIRTY minutes later or food order was taken...and then it came out wrong.   This was a typical night at the Vig.   Uptight stuffy vibe with service that is dreadful."}
{"text":"The star rating is 100% the food because the service SUCKED.  My friend & I met after work for HH at 5PM & got a nice spot on the patio, it was PACKED! We ordered a few glasses of wine, edamame (HH menu), Buffalo wings (HH menu), and then we each ended up getting a Hot Chick Sandwich w/ sweet potato fries. Food was excellent as always. Strongly recommend the sandwich, delicious.   Service was another story. My friend & I had a lot of catching up to do so we were there for a few hours (like 3) but I swear we only saw our waitress 3-4 times total. We actually had to wave her down a few times to order an entr√©e and get another glass of wine. I was disappointed.  Also, I have gotten the Pad Thai before, and although its good it was very soupy. All the liquid/sauce in it sat at the bottom. Just felt different and weird to me."}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. Best bloody Mary's around, especially on Sunday. Super personable bartenders (we usually sit at the bar). Service great, and food is fantastic! Definitely a place we love to frequent!"}
{"text":"Just ordered a burger to go. Told it would be ready in 15-20 minutes. Got there in 15 minutes and waited another 10. Bar tender was rude. The burger was the worst I've ever had. The bun was stale, the meat was over cooked, the tomato looked old and was mealy, and there was no dressing on the burger. I could barely swallow it it was so dry. There was absolutely NO flavor to it at all. It was weird. This is the second time I got food that had no flavor. It's also the last time. Just awful. I don't know what the attraction is, other than maybe the atmosphere because the food is so, nothing."}
{"text":"I've given this place multiple chances, but every time I've come away disappointed.  The place has decent food and good drinks but the service there is so consistently bad that the food and drinks can't make up for it.    After being sat and having you first drink order taken, go ahead and get comfortable because it's probably going to be a while before you see your server again.  Every time I have gone there it always seems like I have to flag somebody down to get another round or food order in.  When you actually do get your food and/or drinks it's pretty decent.  I particularly like their prime dip and their Mac and Cheese.  Their edamame is great as well.  Half the time though, getting your food or drink and getting it how you want it is a whole battle in itself.  I've had them completely miss items I've ordered or when I ask for something with no mustard etc. it doesn't come that way.   I really want to like this place, I really do.  It's across the street from where I live and the overall concept is good; it's just poor execution on the staffs part.  I also work down the street at a hotel and often get asked for recommendations in the area.  I just can't recommend this place anymore. It's kinda frustrating because I just want to walk in there and yell \"Take my money!\" All I ask is decent service in return."}
{"text":"If you want Nachos-The Vig, is the Place. Yum.  We come here when we are in the mood for cold beer and Nachos. The bar has booths and you can sit outside.  McCormick Ranch.  Been here for Happy hour too, never disappointed!"}
{"text":"I like the vig, I wish I could give it a 3.5 but it's not a solid 4 for me. On a recent visit my friends and I were waiting almost 20 minutes to be acknowledged by a waiter. When he did finally come over, he had zero personality and seemed really stressed out. We ordered drinks with him and already knew our food order too since we were waiting so long anyway. All of a sudden a female waitress comes over and tells me they didn't have the slider appetizer anymore because they ran out of pretzel buns. So having to order something else, I just went with the regular burger which is closest to the sliders I wanted and she said they would put it on a pretzel bun for me. All of the food was good, drinks were great as well but what really ticked me off was that they charged me for the pretzel bun. It is only 1$ but seriously???? I already had to order a more expensive entree because it was not possible to give me the sliders and then after I am inconvenienced to order something different, you charge me a fee for a bun? It just was bad and cheap customer service. Also the female waitress seemed to just continue taking care of us and we never saw that guy anymore so no acknowledgement of the transfer was strange too.  Overall it's good food and good drinks and I would definitely go back, I just hope the service is better next time."}
{"text":"The Vig is one of our go-to restaurants on the weekend. They have a number of gluten free options, including a gluten free bun. I like to order the steakhouse beef dip on a gf bun. Unfortunately, their French fries aren't gf since they're fried in the same fryer as other gluten-filled items.  So if you're gf, I recommend substituting them with Brussels sprouts."}
{"text":"This rating is based 100% on the poor service!  The hostess was extremely rude as well as the bar tenders. There were empty tables yet we were told the wait was 45min. We thought we would grab a drink at the bar but after waiting 15 min and not even being acknowledged we left."}
{"text":"**UPDATING WE DID RETURN TO THIS LOCATION WITH HESITATION BUT WE WERE SHORT ON TIME AND IT WAS CLOSER WE DID NOT SIT IN A BAR BOOTH BUT ON PATIO WHERE THE HEATERS WERE... service was much better there were several bus boys who were great, the FOOD WAS PERFECT THIS TIME AND DELICIOUS WE HAD A GREAT NIGHT SO I AM UPDATING MY REVIEW***   (Previous)Very disappointed with this vig, i am giving three stars just because its the vig and my experience at the vig arcadia was great, the food was great, hot and fresh despite it being very busy, the food here came to us luke warm like it had been sitting for at least 20 min and the service we received was not too good, sat waiting for the server to return after we received the food to tell her it wasn't hot but noone seemed to notice us,it just ruined the whole meal and experience, we were starving as well,having been out all day and just wanted to enjoy a good meal at the vig but unfortunately that didnt happen, we will stick with the arcadia vig."}
{"text":"This is the most unlikely place to get a really good bowl of posole.  Much less really awesome Mexican entries. I usually have to hit dives in phoenix to find food this authentic plus no necitas hablar Espanol! The posole is seasoned very well. It has a little spice to it but not so much that you would have to pass it you cant handle heat.  The hangover helper also is a dish that is very tasty and a little spicy. It is almost like a tamale pie with eggs on top. A great dish for the morning after a night of drinking. The spice helps you sweat out late night alcohol. Visited two different times and both times the dishes were the same awesome meals.  Cant speak of the other dishes cause I only go for the Mexican stuff"}
{"text":"Always wanted to try this place and I'm so glad I did! The service has been great and, of course, bottomless Mimosas are wonderful! The food was very good. I had the breakfast enchiladas and they were some of the best I've had! My husband had the huevos rancheros, which were just as good. His only two minor complaints ware there are no toothpicks at the bloody mary bar to put his goodies on, so all his accouterments fell to the bottom of the glass. Also, the menus on their website need to be updated. He was looking forward to a corned beef hash listed on the online menu, but it was removed some time ago. Overall great experience and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Boootwo thumbs way down! 2nd time we get food that's frozen in the middle. Manager gave us $10.00 off our bill! Wow! We live in the neighborhood and will not recommend this place to any of our friends."}
{"text":"Best customer service ever! Anthony (the manager) went above and beyond for my friends and I. He's not only one of the best managers/bartender I've ever met, but he's super out going and really makes you enjoy your dinning experience. Ricky (our server) had amazing hospitality and super friendly. Both definitely need a raise or something because your lucky to have such great staff. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"After reading my yelp review, I was sent a $50 gift card in the mail by the owner of the Vig. My boy friend and I were very grateful for this and decided to give the Vig another chance. We went on Friday night. We sat inside which was way more enjoyable. The atmosphere itself was extremely different. This time Emily was our server. She was quick, friendly, and attentive. She made recommendations to the menu and offered to split our food in the kitchen for us instead of us having to do it table side. We ordered the chorizo Mac and cheese and the Ribeye. Both of which were delicious! And I have to say, the potatoes that came with the ribeye were the best potatoes I've ever had. They were cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly, and I just wish there were more of them! Thank you again for giving us a second opportunity to dine at the Vig! We will be back next week!"}
{"text":"Trendy restaurant with great selection of contemporary American food. Cocktails are creative and well made. Bar is really cool, and service is very helpful. Bit of an older crowd since it's in Mccormick ranch."}
{"text":"Nice large patio here, but perhaps it is because it's Snowbird Season.....well, it's all old people.  Seriously, we went for Happy HOur and we were the youngest people there and I'm no spring chicken.    The location is in a strip mall so the patio overlooks credit unions, Chinese restaurants and such.  I'll stick with the other two."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous! No sound for Monday Night Football. I ask the dude why and he said place was a restaurant not Sports Bar. REALLY? It has horrible decor for a restaurant and looks like a Sports Bar. And \"Vig\" is a gambling term so it's makes no sense!"}
{"text":"Nice place, packed on the soft opening. The vigazz burger was tasty, but I thought the wings were the highlight - my friend loved his fish tacos   Our server Kelsey was very nice and accommodating, especially considering it was so busy.  My only qualm was the misters were angled down on tables and very powerful, soaking our table, and two members in our party- We asked to move inside, but they ended up turning off the misters-I felt really bad because it affected other people, but I could tell some were relieved as the ladies hair was getting frizzy"}
{"text":"A review from vacation. While I was out in Arizona and waiting for my nail appointment at the salon next door, I stopped in to this restaurant. They have a great outdoor space with a canopy over head, and an open path to the inside bar. There weren't many customers at the time I showed up, and my server Cain was always nearby.  I started off my meal with the spinach dip. The chips were house fried and the pita bread was perfect for dipping. My meal was a French dip sandwich and I was surprised at how tender the meat was.   I wanted a fruity mocktail, so I left my decisions up to the bartender. I was given a fruity iced tea from the menu , and I had at least three of them. Delicious.   I look forward to taking my Arizona friends out to the Vig next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"This well deserved 3 stars only goes out to the bartender who made my night during this visit. I believe his name was Jonathon(too many drinks to remember) lol. This guy was absolutely amazing and kind and If I was a local I would come visit him every weekend. Other than the bartender I can't say the same for the food. It was just alright and nothing special. This restaurant has a cool atmosphere but the food is definitely bland and if I was in town again I would only come for some drinks at the bar."}
{"text":"Perfect \"chill\" date night spot. Inexpensive happy hour and quality food for a reasonable price!! We will be back. Very yummy. My favorite part was that they have Trivia Pursuit on each table to enjoy. It was fun and a great conversation starter!! I highly recommend the Vig to any couple looking for a relaxed date night, any family looking for yummy food, and really anyone who loves good food at great prices. Thank you, \"The Vig\" for making tonight so great. Your service was outstanding. Everything was on point. THANK YOU!!!"}
{"text":"The food! Amazing. The service! Great. We had the fish tacos and they were wonderful. The beer selection was good as well. The Brussels sprouts are a must try!"}
{"text":"My husband & I walked to the Vig for TGIF. We sat at the bar and had good service however the food was a disappointment. We order the calamari and Greek salad. Calamari was like eating a bowl of rubber bands & salad was wilted. The quality of food was over all poor."}
{"text":"The food was excellent but let me tell you the little chef that looked like Jason Staham was to die for and the food was great."}
{"text":"Are you looking for great service, a very comfortable environment, a menu that is filled with great choices and flavors Bobby Flay would be jealous of,,and of course a variety of beverages to satisfy your taste..come to the Vig at MC,,you don't have to shout to talk at your table, sort rib tacos, fish tacos , steak salad and the burgers,,great flavor! Another great evening and thank you Andrew for your fantastic service !"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place therefore we go at least once a month. Great food great atmosphere and great wine list. Sundays they have 1/2 price bottles and they have a great happy hour. This place is always busy for a reason. When it's not too hot out they have a nice large patio to enjoy dinner and drinks. Food is fabulous, I love the humus trio, nachos and pad tai to name a few."}
{"text":"The Vig McCormick Ranch is my favorite of all their locations.The patio is fun and the interiors are cozy and romantic perfect for an intimate conversation or a loud night out with friends.  We got Appetizers: Stillman chop salad (kale,seasonal veggies,cherry tomatoes,Parmesan,champagne vinaigrette).You can also add salmon or chicken.  Cheesy tater tots (stuffed with cheddar cheese) served with a jalapeno dip. Flat bread (mushrooms,onions,tomatoes,chives and lots of cheese).You have to ask the server what kind of toppings they have that day.  Mains: Black bean burger (vegetarian burger with with cheddar,tomatoes,aioli,red onions,roasted peppers,arugula).You can choose from a variety of sides like onion rings,fries,green salad,slaw etc.We got the sweet potato fries. Deconstructed Fish tacos (sword fish,pineapple,corn,black beans,guacamole,picco de Gallo,sour cream) with corn tortilla. Pad Thai (egg noodles,tofu,egg,peanuts,sprout,spicy tamarind sauce,lime) you can add chicken or shrimp.  Drinks: Irish Exit (jameson,ginger beer lime,plum bitters). Bunch of Beers.  The food was on point especially the black bean burger, best I have ever had.The selection of cocktails is pretty interesting.Staff is friendly and service is flawless.Overall a fun place to hang.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I finally tried out this The Vig location ( I used to frequent the one in Arcadia every now and then). and I really liked it!  I don't know if it's the location (McCormick Ranch/north Scottsdale) or the fact I came here for dinner (versus Happy Hour or Sunday Funday when I would normally go to The Vig), but this one kind of has a less down to earth vibe bout it. It's fine, but the crowd is definitely reflected in the neighborhood it's located.   We happened to come on a Tuesday, which means TACO TUESDAY. The Vig has a pretty good deal on this day. Five (different) tacos & your choice of a margarita or Dos Equis (I went w/the later) for $15. The tacos were yummy. Honestly, I couldn't distinguish between all five, but like I said they were all great. The short rib & fish were my two favorites. Two of the other people I came with ordered the pad thai, which I tasted and thought was fantastic! It's more a of creamy pad thai compared to other places, but I really liked it.   Service was friendly. We came in with a couple of $10 off coupons with a $30 purchase that weren't supposed to be honored for \"specials\" (as well as HH), and we weren't sure if the \"Taco Tuesday\" was considered a \"special,\" but our waitress has no issue accepting them.   I like The Vig a lot & I'd come back to this location."}
{"text":"Was there today. Good service. Good, yet eclectic menu. Not a lot of choices for me, but for many it's different and interesting. Had a great turkey sandwich on pretzel bread. It's already too hot to keep all the doors open, so it was uncomfortably warm inside. I didn't complain, so my bad for complaining now. Great brunch spot and bar scene which I believe it's known for. A definitely reliable lunch, brunch spot and watering hole."}
{"text":"My mom and I went to the Vig on Saturday for lunch. We sat at the bar and had a fabulous time!  The service was excellent and the food superb! We both had the sliders - which were so good!!  I didn't have one, but they have a bloody mary bar. They also make an awesome sangria from scratch!  Tracy and Jonathan took great care of us! I think it's our new Saturday \"go to\" place!!  We love finding a great place to be regulars at!"}
{"text":"Fell in love with this location last night! Go see Jonathan at the bar and have him make you a grapefruit Moscow mule! Luckily we were there for 3 hours, so I also got to try their whiskey mule (2nd favorite), Raspberry Rhubarb mule (3rd) and Blueberry Mule. All were refreshing, but if definitely go Grapefruit if I had to pick one. We also shared the calamari which is lightly fried with an incredible Cajun dip. Am craving it now just thinking about it!!"}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. This place came recommended to me.  We had the sliders, which had far too much bread and not enough flavor and the fish tacos which were fishy and clearly not fresh. We didn't like the seating arrangement either. So sorry Vig, never again."}
{"text":"I've heard so much about The Vig for awhile now, finally having had a chance to try and it was well worth it. We were in the area of this location and stopped by for lunch. We were greeted right away and seated by the hostess. The restaurant had a modern layout with a trendy ambiance. We sat on the outdoor patio which had window/doors that opened into an open atrium where there were tables too (very nice). Water was poured and our waitress introduced herself right away.  We started off with a couple of beers and the Gauc & Chips. The Gauc was excellent fresh and spicy though the chips were a little lacking though they were fine. We ordered 2 entrees and told our waitress wanted to share the dishes. The Grilled Fish Tacos (blacken whitefish, spicy slaw, pico de gallo, tomatillo-avocado salsa) and the Chicken Pad Thai (chicken or shrimp, spicy tamarind sauce, rice noodles, egg, tofu, bean sprouts, peanuts, lime). I was pleasantly surprised that when we told our waitress we were going to share, the kitchen split the 2 dishes into 2, which was great. I thought the food, service, and ambiance was great, absolutely no complaints. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"A great restaurant with some wonderful style.  I really enjoyed the modern styling and indoor/outdoor flow.  I know it's something that is tough to do in AZ due to the heat in summer, but it was a real treat to find a place that felt so open.  It reminds me of a place you'd find on Melrose Ave. in L.A., or someplace you'd find near the ocean.  There was a warm and friendly buzz about the place and everyone seemed to be enjoying the spaces. I'm a big fan of the style for sure.  The food was good. We were a group of four and had the sliders and wings for happy hour.  The little sliders were tasty but slightly dry. It's tough to make those little buns moist but they had great flavor. The wings were good, without any seeming new twists to the wings I thought they were messy but good. I only had a couple figuring that I'd get it all over myself if I kept eating them.   I had the Pad Thai, which was quite spicy.  I love spicy so it was great for me, but would definitely not recommend it for everyone. The waiter was great and did advise us to make certain we wanted spicy.  The sauce was a little too watery for my preferences, but it was quite tasty.  I am a real Pad Thai fan so I use it as a litmus test for food regularly. I don't think it was quite a Pad Thai but it was tasty.  Many times when you order Pad Thai you do get some chicken and shrimp, but in this case you had to pay extra if you wanted both. It was no big deal and I ordered both. What I tend to like about the dish is that it normally gives you a burst of different flavors depending on what's on your fork. This one was a bit more bold and the flavor was a bit too strong. It's such a dish of variety and everyone has their likes. I just think it was a bit overpowering and lacked delicacy. I think it was more.. Pad Thai-like/inspired.. sorta!  The other dish I tried was the Lean & Green Steak Salad. This dish was very nice. I thought the flat iron steak was perfectly marinated and tender. The greens were fresh and overall it was a real winner.  Once I tasted this I instantly wished that I had listened and ordered it myself.  The steak had a great taste and the salad dressing was a really nice and bold vinaigrette.  I'll definitely be ordering that next time. It's not a large salad but had some really beautiful pieces of steak on top that were cooked perfectly. Kudos on the Flat Iron steak for sure.  We had drinks and dinner outside on the patio. The overall experience was really quite nice.  I did have to keep asking for a refill of water since nobody came around filling glasses.  Everyone was nice enough and we had a great time talking with friends. We never felt rushed to leave which was quite nice. Trying to be fair I enjoyed the look and feel of the restaurant a LOT.  I will definitely be giving this another try. The friends I was with had been there before and I was happy to join them and will be again. The overall experience was very pleasant and with some better service and a different dish.. I may be giving this an exuberant four stars .. maybe more. Definitely worth a try with friends and good conversation."}
{"text":"Got a very nice email from the owner that shows they really care about customer satisfaction. Nice that they are monitoring yelp reviews and 'making it right!' I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever.  Went with a friend to get food to go, a salad for me and nachos for him.  His order comes out first.  Five minutes go by and no salad so I asked the bartender to check.  He tells me the kitchen is slammed and my order is being boxed up.  Almost ten minutes go by and still no salad.  At this point my friends nachos are soggy.  The manager brings out my salad with no apology, no offer to come back for Happy Hour to try again, nothing.  Will never go back.  Have been several times before and the service is never what I'd call fast but this is pretty lame.  Too many other good restaurants to go to.  Plus with the tip my wedge salad was $15.  Yes they charge $12 for a wedge of lettuce."}
{"text":"Great happy hour food and drinks. Love the wings! Me and my wife just love this place."}
{"text":"I have to say I was extremely disappointed this time at the Vig. I love the food and lately have been getting it to go because I have had some issues with service when dining in. We walked in about 6 PM there were a few empty tables but we were told the wait would be about 15 minutes, finally when they sat us I could see those tables were still empty. I believe the manager (he said) a guy with a very swollen bandaged hand complaining about why he was having to work came and helped us get drinks saying that our server was busy,  after waiting a while he came back and said he would take our order. Our server eventually came by said hi and walked away not even noticing our drinks were empty, we asked somebody else for drinks and eventually after our food came we finally got somebody to refill our ice tea. The true disappointment was that shrimp pad Thai my favorite there. It had two pieces of shrimp some noodles and the rest was tofu, way too much tofu, it was like they ran out of shrimp and noodles and just served an order of tofu with a little shrimp and noodles on the side. I was very disappointed as I had been craving my favorite dish for about a week. It was so bad that it's gonna be a while before I even want to order it there again. Come on Vig we really need you in this neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of dining at The Vig while on vacation in Scottsdale. The food was excellent and the staff as well as the patrons were friendly and inviting. Staff was great and made great recommendations. When they found out I was from Atlanta a couple of the staff came over and chatted and made me feel right at home.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Long wait for a table, seated on the patio. It was a cold night and the heaters couldn't keep up. We got our drink order after about 20 minutes, then never saw our waitress again to give our dinner order. The margaritas were good and would have ordered another. The guacamole was also yummy. Too bad we couldn't have placed a dinner order. Walked out after 45 minutes after being seated."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the Greek salad, and I come here quite lot for business lunches and happy hours (both dine-in and carryout).  They have a nice patio which is great for eating when the weather is right.  When going to lunch with a group, there is something on the menu that will please everyone."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great atmosphere (every vig location is unique in its design), interesting drinks. I like it. Drinks took forever to come to our table, however. Also, don't necessarily trust the wait staff's recommendations on drinks. I think one of my chromosomes flipped with a super sweet drink they suggested. Don't worry, I watched a ton of sports and popped that sucker back into 'Y' status though. Try the mac and cheese!"}
{"text":"I've been to the other Vig locations, so happy this one is in Scottsdale! The food is truly delicious, had the guacamole, mac and cheese, and hummus! It was all superb!   Great cocktails, ambience is great for business meeting or a romantic date (much more professional/romantic than the other Vig restaurants). Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"First time to this location, always love going to the Arcadia spot. Sat at the bar around noon. We like the cozy warm atmosphere and there are tvs at the bar to watch sports. We were greated promptly by Tracy, lovely bartender. Had the Bennett and bubbles that I have wanted to try, it was awesome, not too sweet, refreshing and perfect to pair with my beet and goat cheese salad. Great salad, the mandarin oranges complimented the bitter arugula perfectly. My boyfriend had the chicken sandwich with Mac and cheese. He enjoyed both and I tried the mac, it was yummie, pasta cooked just right and thick sauce. The manager was very nice, we chatted about the drinks and their new location in North Scottsdale. We will definitely be back to see Tracy for Saturday brunch. She is wonderful, genuine, fantastic service. She anticipated our possible needs and has a warm smile. Thank you!"}
{"text":"There are quite a few Vig restaurants in the valley and I think they are all cool.  Cozy atmosphere but also great for groups.  The bar is great and they have awesome happy hour choices.  They have insanely decadent Mac and cheese..YUMMA!  I love their salmon, salads, sliders..all good!  The patios are great as well.  Killer little neighborhood joint!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite lunch places! Not just because the food is really, really great, the bartenders are amazing!!! I like to go to lunch with my friends, but sometimes I like to go alone, and I can always count on feeling comfortable sitting at the bar. This is always because of Sandy and Tracy, the bartenders that work during the day (sorry, I don't know the other ones, I'm sure they're great as well). It doesn't matter what I order, it's always yummy! Some of my favorite appetizers are the Edamame, the artichoke, kale and roasted jalapeno dip and the calamari. If you like salads, the asian chop or the lean and green steak salad are both equally awesome. Then there are the other dishes, such as the mac and cheese, the fish tacos, and of course the big bowl of posole......Did I mention the awesome bartenders Sandy and Tracy???? Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Alex was the best server ever!  The food was great and we loved the bottomless mimosas. I had the pozole and it was as close to my homemade Pozole as you can get. Logan the manager came around and talked to us as well. Good food and drinks, live music and the NBA playoffs, IT'S FANTASTIC!!"}
{"text":"Great place for a work lunch.. close to Pima Center ..  On today's lunch visit we shared the chips & guac plate from the appetizer menu.. plenty of chips, salsa & fresh guacamole to satisfy four people.  All of our entrees looked delicious and we were all happy with our selections.. I had the Best Turkey (that's what it's called) sandwich on a pretzel roll, the sandwich comes with roasted turkey breast and a cranberry chutney on a pretzel roll.. what a great flavor combo.. (there were other things on the sandwich too but those three items definitely made the sandwich) served with a side of fries..   Great service.. great location .. I'll be back for happy hour and dessert..  Don't mind the construction.. they're only getting bigger!!"}
{"text":"Even though this is my first review of The Vig McCormick, I have been there for lunch, dinner, and happy hour on four different occasions over the past three years.  This particular visit was for happy hour on a cold, rainy weekday.  The experience couldn't have been better.  For starters, there are modest deals on draft beers and excellent deals on the happy hour eats.  We had the edamame plus guacamole and salsa with chips.  Our waitress, Kelsee, was nothing short of amazing.  She was personable, efficient, competent, and incredibly helpful.  The edamame was a large serving - probably about the same size as the frozen bags you find in the stores to prepare at home.  We had them with salt only, but Kelsee also brought us a side of the garlic soy sauce on the side so we could dip them.  They were delicious.  The guacamole was the best I have ever had in a restaurant (mine at home is just slightly better).  It was seasoned perfectly, and the texture was beyond compare.  The salsa was wonderful, and the chips were fresh, large and crisp.  On your first trip in, be sure to log in to their Wi-Fi (even though it is open - so don't log in to anything requiring you to enter a password).  After logging in and providing your email address, you will almost immediately receive an email with a \"coupon\" for $5 off that first bill.  Great deal.  The prices on the happy hour food are really excellent.  Edamame was $4, Guac and chips $6, and we added the salsa for another $2.  Can't beat that with a stick."}
{"text":"Just like all the other Vigs this place has a great vibe and awesome spot for dinner and a drink."}
{"text":"Wings, garlic edamame, and any burger. Make those happen and you'll be happy. Large patio and good sized bar. Service was great as well."}
{"text":"I would definitely recommend this place to anyone! The food and service was delicious! It is a little noisy when sitting outside but the patio seating is perfect!"}
{"text":"First time I ordered from the Vig, I got the pad Thai that tasted like an extra eggy carbonara and made me sick to my stomach all night.   Tonight I decided to order again, and got a basic burger with fries. Did they even cook this burger?! I had to throw the whole thing away. Terrible.   Both I got on postmates."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on Tuesday before class, the hostess was very nice and accommodating when I asked for a large booth so I could work. They have free WIFI, yay! Someone brought me water immediately, and within a minute I was greeted by my server who took my drink order, and she came right back and asked if I was ready to order, which I was. I just got the traditional wings and sweet potato fries, both of which were tasty. When my soda ran out, she brought me a new one before I could ask. I enjoyed my afternoon here, was able to chill and get some work done, both the service and food were on point. Recommend!"}
{"text":"A local favorite that I visit often with family and friends. Sometimes I get a hankering for their pozole soup and swing by for take out, but just about everything on the menu is great here."}
{"text":"Started off the night here at The Vig in celebration of a birthday, so it called for a girls night out. This place was the perfect spot, the interior and environment wasn't too loud and had a loungey feel to it. They have huge portions that are easily shareable, good price point and great service.  Our group of 9 gals managed to squeeze into a tiny booth, but made do and understandably could not have a chair placed in the main walkway due to fire hazard reasons. Items we shared:  - Artichoke, Kale & Roasted Jalapeno Dip served with Pita and Chips: absolutely amazing, creamy, rich, not too greasy. Seriously addicting! - Nachos del Norte (Chicken): typical nachos with chicken, beans, cheese, guac, jalapenos, sour cream, salsa, olives and green onions - Hot Vings (Thai Sweet Chili): these are sticky, sweet and savory! chicken was cooked well, I loved the crispy coating! - Mac N Cheese (with Broccoli): rich, but not uncomfortably so. definitely a well cooked comfort food, the broccoli made it a less guilty treat! (At least I'd like to think so ...)  Others ordered (about 5) entrees due to dietary restrictions or due to appetite level. The portions of the apps and entrees were so large we actually had to take left overs home. Everything looked great and tasted good. The table also had about 5 alcoholic beverages. The total bill for 14 items came out to be around $130. Talk about an amazing price and it wasn't even Happy Hour!  The service was great, despite our large party. Waters were refilled, we were checked on and they even gave the birthday gal a complimentary drink. It was fantastic! The customers dining here were also very pleasant which made the entire atmosphere so much more. There is a wide range of ages here, so no worries on that! You can bet I will be back for their famous happy hour and I can't wait!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, great burger, server Alex was attentive....what more could you ask for!"}
{"text":"Everything was perfect. I had The Prime Vig Dip with sweet potato fries and it was delicious! All the other food that came out at the table looked amazing. The chefs that plate the food do great work. Tracy, our server, did an impeccable job! She was attentive and funny. Thank you to the whole team at The Vig for a great experience. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Dark and sad OK we get that this place is under a remodel construction but that doesn't excuse the watered down drinks, generic menu and incredibly dark cave like interior. Bring a flashlight (I am not kidding). Look at the photo I just took! It is 7:00 pm dinner rush and this place looks like a Goth bar. Sad. I would give it one star but I feel sorry for them"}
{"text":"Another great location for the Vig. Same great food & ambiance in a casual neighborhood setting."}
{"text":"Everything was awesome. Food, service, and table were all awesome. I asked for an awesome table and once I was brought to it I noticed a more awesome table. I requested the more awesome table and they were more than happy to let my family and me sit there. This Vig is awesome. The service and food was awesome too. Kelsee was more than awesome and oh so sweet! We loved our first experience at this awesome location!"}
{"text":"Great place! Loved the atmosphere outside. A bit loud for my taste inside, but the food and drinks were great. I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"This place has a great Happy Hour, as well as a regular menu. I loved my fruity cocktail the Coug Cup, my family loved the Old Fashioned and Red House Wine, all on Happy Hour.  The nachos and traditional wings were a hit with the three of us!  I ordered the Pad Thai, which was the best I've had outside of an Asian restaurant.  If we had room, we would have tried dessert, so that's for next time.  Our server was amazing and went out of her way to please us."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food. I only get two items. Wings and Mac n cheese. Well three with drinks. Good every time. No actually is GREAT every time. Fun to lounge at or get ready for a night out."}
{"text":"What in the world happened to The Vig?  I will never return to this restaurant as the food was downright awful.  I enjoyed the atmosphere The Vig offers on the patio and our server was very nice.  I went with my boyfriend for a night out and relaxing on the patio over some wine and a good meal. I chose the Ginger Seared Ono dish. OH NO!!!  I can not believe the kitchen would send this dish out to me.  It was the tinest and thinnest fish filet I have ever been served. I could not even cut it as was all dried up and leathery. My boyfriend's fish taco's were sub par to say the least. The tiny pieces of fish in each taco were a joke.  The Manager was pleasant but did not offer to take the Ono off the bill or even offer a drink as I waited for a basic salad. Can't mess that up right! The overall experience was not good and will not be returning back to The Vig."}
{"text":"Tasty cocktails, talented and friendly bartenders."}
{"text":"The service is so terrible I'll never give them a second chance. Came in with a friend and we were starving. We stood at the bar and finally got drinks and menus.  On az Monday night there were 6 guests total and at least five employes behind the bar. I waited 30 minutes as they chatted with each other, walked past me without eye contact and I gave up and just went to a table to finish my drink while my friend went outside. The bartender then asked me if I wanted another drink and I told him I came there to eat but nobody took my order so I give up. He said okay then, no apologies and walked away. He went back to the group if employees and they had a great time chatting. Direct result of poor management, if they even have a manager. Waste of time when there are so many new restaurants nearby with good service and food."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night after flying into PHX and arriving at my hotel in North Scottsdale. The outdoor area looked nice, but the wait for a little over twenty minutes so I opted for the bar. I was immediately given a menu by the bartender, who took a few moments to tell me his name and shake my hand. I ordered a 12 oz glass of red wine and the fish tacos. Oh my gosh the tacos were so good! The char on the fish was flavorful, yet not totally burnt tasting. There was an abundance of pico de gallo and salsa verde, and the serving size felt just right. I found this restaurant under Google Map's \"where the locals go filter\" (sorry Yelp, haha), and this was confirmed by all of the folks to my left and right at the bar chatting away on a first name basis with the bartender. I will likely return to the Vig, if not to see if the other entrees hold up to the fish tacos, then to ask about the origin of the name."}
{"text":"My mom and I went here for dinner a few days ago and really liked our food! I got their black bean burger and she got their sliders. We also split their strawberry shortcake desert, and it was divine! We'll be returning for dinner again very soon :)"}
{"text":"My most recent visit happened this past weekend and I was extremely disappointed to say the least. My sister flew into town and as indecisive as they may be, I decided \"let's go to the Vig in Scottsdale, I love that place!\" since I used to live in the area and frequented it more often when I did. We were headed up in that direction for a movie so the Vig was a viable option, or so I thought. Out of all their locations and visits combined I have never been treated so poorly! First off, the hostess was unfriendly. She didn't even make eye contact let alone ask how our night was, you know, COMMON pleasantries. She simply asked \"how many?\" and quickly sat us down (it wasn't full in the dining or bar area, btw). My mom and I went to the restroom while my dad and sister sat down. When we came back they already had their drinks, that's fine. I ordered a glass of wine which a man in a button-down shirt served. Maybe he was the manager, but good for him that he actually had a smile on his face and was the only nice person out of the whole staff I had interaction with. There was limited face time with our actual waitress. She finally comes back and gets our appetizer order then she disappears for a loooong ass time! I'm talking at least 15-20 minutes without stopping by to check-in, ask for refills or HELLO! Take our dinner order?? Mind you, there is an elderly white couple sitting next to us where she tended to several times in between her chatting with her coworkers at the terminal in plain view that's ahead of us. At this point I'm irritated as all hell and asked my family if they wanted to leave. A different guy comes and brings our appetizer and as he sits it down I ask him to have our waitress come over. Where is she at this moment? By the terminal, STILL talking to a coworker. I see her look over and start to walk away when we make eye contact. She gestures with her hands that she's bringing plates but the look on my face tells her to come over instead. I asked her if she was going to take our main order (our menus are still on the table) and she responds \"I assumed you wanted your appetizer first\". No shit, but you're supposed to come back to get our dinner order, hence the whole damn reason why we came to the restaurant! She apologizes and says she's taking care of a party. 1. That's not my problem 2. You could have let us know the half dozen times you walked by to see how the old people were doing 3. there is no excuse! It's definitely possible to take both appetizer and dinner order at once and have the food come out in a timely manner like any normal restaurant would. Multi-tasking is part of your job description! I tell her to forget it, we're leaving. She said she could have the manager come over and take care of some things but I refused. I told her I'm not paying for 2 full drinks and an untouched plate of nachos so we walked out to go someplace else. I'm not trying to pull the race card but even when I did live in Scottsdale I can swear I've been treated differently during my dining experiences when I'm with a group of all white friends or a group  who are all mixed races. Customer service is not their forte and it's upsetting that my family and I had a horrible experience here. The other Vig locations are much, much better!"}
{"text":"Pretty unimpressive. Showed up on a Sunday night and there were people there but it wasn't packed. Waiting for our drink order, waiting to place our order and waiting for our food all took way too long.  The food itself was not great, blackened broccoli was not blackened at all and was sort of partially cooked and mushy. I wouldn't visit again."}
{"text":"We saw on Yelp that they had an ad to come try their restaurant. We decided to try the place.  We went in and the hostess was less than friendly. We saw several open tables inside and no one in waiting area. She said outside dining only unless you want to wait for 25-30 minutes. No smile in her voice and she said we couldn't go to bar, so we left.  Owner was in touch right away. He cared about our experience and that gives them a 5. Things will always happen but it's how you choose to react that matters most. Thank you."}
{"text":"I came into town from texas and had brunch with my dad and girlfriend here. Everyone loved the food and enjoyed the bloody mary bar. I wil definitely make this the place to eat when I come  in town again"}
{"text":"Pork Belly and Watermelon! NIRVANA! Pork is always good with fruit. I just never dreamed of watermelon. They just expanded my culinary universe. Looking forward to trying more of the menu in the future."}
{"text":"Came for dinner with a group of four and sat on the patio. I really enjoyed the overall vibe of the place, it's cool but not pretentious cool. We sat on the patio which was also nice. They had heaters since it got a bit chilly and I assume they have misters for the summer.   To start our table shared the nachos and they were awesome!! I've had lots of wimpy nacho plates at various restaurants but these were absolutely worth it.   They have a decent beer selection, but they also have cold brew coffee which was super smooth if that's your thing. They had some specialty cocktails which also sounded good, I'll have to come back and try a few.   I got the fish tacos, and my friends had the chicken sandwich, the burger, Mac n cheese, and sweet potato fries. The tacos were awesome considering this isn't a Mexican restaurant and the chicken sandwich was also delicious. The burger and Mac and cheese were also solid.   The service was fine, nothing to write home about but pretty standard and timely. Our server was friendly but didn't seem to know much about the menu. No big deal though.   Definitely a cool hang out spot!!! I'll be back."}
{"text":"The atmosphere at the McCormick Ranch Vig is calm and intimate. There's a bar area that is the central focus of the place. If you want to get to know someone or spend a nice evening with your partner this is a great place to relax, east, and drink. They have a few TVs set up too if you're interested in watching sports. The music level was on the louder side but I was still able to carry a conversation with my boyfriend without yelling.   I had the grilled fish tacos (excellent), and the guacamole since we came by after 10 pm. The late night menu is great, plus they had the added bonus of trivial pursuit cards at the tables."}
{"text":"Went for a business meeting for brunch last Sunday.  The service was great.  The food was dreadful.  How can you ruin two eggs and potatoes?  We all ordered different items and I noticed no one ate much at all.  The drinks were great and the service provided by a female server (red hair -didn't get her name) was the only redeeming feature of this dining experience.  Very disappointing and embarrassing.   The Vig is usually pretty good but with all the other options in the area this was not a good choice."}
{"text":"This post concerns service. Went here Friday 9/9/16 for lunch about 1130a. Not too busy as you'd guess so I can't comment about service when they're busy. Our waiter and others were attentive and accommodating. I inquired about the size of the outdoor tv and because the gentleman didn't know, he went back and got a tape measure and let us know! Pretty awesome. Water filled consistently and timely, as we chose to eat outside on this day. I ordered burger and fries, it was tasty. I'd come again for happy hour for sure. The menu isn't extensive so not too many different dishes I'd try, but what they have, they do well & that's all u can ask for. If it's on the menu, u oughtta kno how to make it good and they do! I enjoyed my time here. Will enjoy outside even more once the fall temps come around. Nice establishment, really like the ambiance they got going. I didn't catch anyone's name, but they treated us well. From our group of 6, thank you!"}
{"text":"I'm on the fence on this one.  Could have been more stars, but I didn't really enjoy my entree.  I don't know if it was my fault, I ordered the Mac n Cheese plain, and it didn't have much flavor.  My husbands food however was very good.  He ordered the Pad Thai, and I had him switch me, unfortunately he wanted to switch back.  I really liked the ambiance however, and the service was good, so I may have to give it another try."}
{"text":"The Vig flat out rules!   Really beautifully designed space for a modern restaurant that's tucked in the corner parking lot of a strip mall!   We choose the Vig for dinner strictly based on the fact that we could walk there from our resort, and the night was beautiful!  We had a small wait for a table outside on the patio, but boy was it worth it!    The food was incredible!  Might be the best, Veggie Burger I have had in years!  I had to make a few substitutions to make it Vegan, but the waitress had no problems with making my request happen!  Seriously this is a Veggie Burger, big, bold tasting, and left me feeling energized and ready to rock the rest of my night!    The staff was super nice, the setting is beautiful, and the price was right!  Great spot! If I lived in Scottsdale, this would be a regular stop for me!"}
{"text":"YUM! Menu caters to all sorts of guests, mostly New American kind of trendy food, but also some stuff like fish tacos and pad thai. I got the vegetarian burger, its a pretty standard black bean patty for all my vegs out there wondering and i got it without cheese. I got a side of sweet potato fries and it was all good. I would come again, they have several locations too. I was impressed that a place with multiple locations hasn't become all \"chain-y\" and lacking the original feel."}
{"text":"We came here the other night. Ordered appetizers and salad to share.  Place was packed. Jen was awesome.  Steve is a great, always checking to make sure that everything is tasty.   I love this place !!!!  Dawn  Scottsdale"}
{"text":"Great food but our server was a bit grumpy. Who knows, maybe she had a bad day but she wasn't very pleasant. But as the food was good I still give them 4 stars."}
{"text":"Good spot for late night eats! We all shared the artichoke, kale, and jalapeno dip which was awesome, and then I got the Best Turkey Sandwich which totally killed me with deliciousness. Someone else in the group got the nachos, and they were nice and loaded up with toppings and shredded chicken.  Drinks were tasty and quick, and the atmosphere was cool. I prefer the interior of this location to the Arcadia Vig."}
{"text":"Pros: Amazing food! I got the turkey sandwhich  with cranberry dressing and a side of mac a d cheese.   Cons: shockingly rude server. Too exhausting to go into details but we were taken back by how mean/rude our waitress was.  Would give 5 star if it wasn't for the poor service."}
{"text":"I love the Vig Uptown and was hoping to have the same loving feeling @ McC Ranch.  We went for Happy Hour and the place was hopping with Spring visitors.  Great vibe.  The HH drink specials are relatively steep in comparison to like restaurants in the area.  The HH food is plenty- but everything was very salty.  I guess they wanted me to drink more?"}
{"text":"Not impressed. No a/c cause they leave all doors open. Over crowded and it is filled with middle aged singles all looking for younger friends. Sketchy. Too bad cause food looked good."}
{"text":"Great food, and great service. I love there teriyaki chicken sandwich, love the blend of flavors."}
{"text":"Just met up with friends for the tail end of their drinks and apps but the edamame was delicious and the atmosphere on the patio was fun.  They were quite crowded but the servers seemed to keep on top of things.  I think I'll try to check them out again soon."}
{"text":"Cool location is in the McCormick Ranch area. I have been to most of their other locations. This one is on par with the rest of their restaurants. Nice large patio in a cool dark modern Decor. Good daily specials and happy hour Monday through Friday 3 to 6 p.m."}
{"text":"The excitement to see a new Vig location THIS close to my house was nearly unbearable for the months of anticipation we had to bear before its opening. An interesting locale amidst a somewhat golf-centric, white-haired community, but I don't care how old you are if you like to party. This location is perhaps my least favorite of all 4 venues, but it is within biking distance and therefore still satisfactory by Vig standards.  The food is delicious and consistent with their other locations. The service at this particular shop is phenomenal. The bartenders are super cool as are the table servers. Service - good or bad - rarely makes or breaks my dining experience, but really good service stands out. The only major drawbacks are: 1) No corn hole/bacci ball....seriously? I didn't know it was possible to build a Vig without a signature bacci court, and I feel personally slighted by this oversight. 2) Acoustics in the bar area are terrible when the house is full. During happy hour on a busy night, it is 100% impossible to have a conversation that doesn't end in a hoarse throat. We've made the mistake (twice) of attempting a drink at 5pm on a Friday - just don't. It's crazy, packed, difficult to order and not worth the screaming match.  I still love you, Vig. And I will still come here lots and lots. Especially for half price bottles of wine on Sunday night!"}
{"text":"The steak salad was incredible - which is saying a lot for a a salad. My husband & brother both got pad Thai & both said it was the best they'd ever had. The French fries were crispy & delicious. Swanky yet laid back vibe. The only complaint was how ridiculously cold it was inside (during summer). Bring a sweater!"}
{"text":"Just like the other Vig locations in terms of food and decor. Service is really good. Brunch is yummy - I recommend the french toast. I like all of the sandwiches I've tried and the hummus as an appetizer is really nice. There's cocktail specials on the weekend if you want to get boozy during brunch."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks. Environment is casual and comfortable with a great staff."}
{"text":"A Sunday lunch with a heavenly Monte Cristo sandwich and a Blue Moon.  Does it get better than this?  The sandwich is on the brunch menu along with many other delectable sounding meals like Tres Leches french toast and Eggs Benedict. My dining partners also had Manny's Enchiladas and a Greek Salad but really the Monte Cristo is where it's at.  Our server was Cain and everything was delivered and cleared in a decent amount of time. He told us the banana cream pie was the best dessert. Although I am not the biggest fan of banana cream pies, they put theirs in a mason jar so my curiosity was peaked. It was divine! We had been out in the heat before we arrived so we drank quite a bit of water and they filled our water glasses many times. Four of us ate for just over $60.00 with a drink and a dessert- not bad."}
