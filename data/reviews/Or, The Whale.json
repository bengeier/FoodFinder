{"text":"Tonight I had the absolute pleasure of sharing a meal with my family to celebrate my brother's birthday (today) and my birthday (tomorrow). My brother has severe nut allergies and I am vegan and gluten free. We're not the most convenient people to cook for because of our dietary restrictions. While my mother made the reservation, she let the restaurant know of their upcoming culinary challenge. As someone who has grown accustomed to ordering the vegetable side and a salad, I was not anticipating a specialized course from this farm to table chophouse and seafood restaurant. However, the chef actually emailed my mother prior to our visit. Before even coming to the restaurant, I felt welcomed. Chef Erik Bates came out to greet me as my specialized entree was being presented. He prepared a beautiful dish - curried chickpeas, roasted onions/fennel/fingerling potatoes, topped with pea shoots and cashews. He made his own curry blend. All of it rested on perfectly cooked red quinoa. Besides being an aesthetic masterpiece, it was so fragrant. I tasted the dish and had tears well up in my eyes. I'm not used to eating something so thought out at a restaurant that does not specialize in vegan cuisine. Every meat eater at the table (minus my nut allergic brother) tasted my meal. Each had seconds or thirds. I highfived the chef. Every single member of our party was unbelievably satisfied with their meals. Please try this place - you won't regret it. Hats off to the chefs for a wonderful culinary experience. They have something extremely special going on."}
{"text":"Had an amazing weekend in Pittsburgh. Or, the whale made it memorable. Ambiance of the restaurant and bar area make for a comfortable evening. The cauliflower soup was delicious. Home made drop biscuits, crab mac and cheese,  shrimp and crab cocktail. 1st time oyster trier! Turns out, delicious! The French fries go through a 3 day prep making them crispy on the out side tender on the in... so much more. The chef Brooks, personally came to our table to greet us and answer questions. Eric, Somalia, introduced just the right wines to accompany our meals. Too full for dessert. Went back for brunch the next day and was just as pleased with the meal, ( the bacon !!!!) My only critique would be to have cream on the table for coffee in the morning. We will definitely be return customers!"}
{"text":"Cocktails were great. Service was phenomenal and my cheeseboard was to die for!!!! A little pricey but it was a special occasion so worth it in the end. Olive was a friendly and personable server. Creme brûlée was delicious!!!"}
{"text":"First, the setting is great. You walk in and feel like you're at a New England eatery by the coast. 

Second, the bar upstairs, including the bartenders and selection of beers, liquor, and wine, are also great. 

We then moved downstairs for our 7:45 dinner reservation for four people. Having heard nothing but good things, expectations were high. 

We sat for approximately twenty minutes without anyone coming over to even ask us if we wanted anything to drink. Eventually we made eye contact with the sommelier, who also turned out to be the manager. He was kind enough to take our drink orders, especially as the waitresses (there were two by the way walking by us all night) ignored us seemingly on purpose. 

About ten minutes later, after still no drinks, the manager came back to take our food orders, and serve us our drinks. 

Another hour goes by, and we finally get out appetizers. I had the octopus, which had a good sauce, and was a solid 7/10. Two people split the Mac and cheese with crabmeat, which they both agreed was mediocre at best. 

Another 40 minutes go by (still no wait staff and just the manager coming by every once in a while) and then we finally receive our main courses. 
-1. Two of us got the bouillabaisse which was a special tonight. It was enjoyable, and for $30 was fairly priced for the quality. 
-2. The two other people split the Duck burger. One of them enjoyed it fine enough, and the other wasn't impressed at all. They both agreed though that for $45, the quality of the bun, quantity of meat, and flavor of the fries, should all have been top notch. We've all had better at any number of the burger restaurants around Pittsburgh, for half the price and infinitely better service. 

Suffice it to say, the food was a solid 5/10, and the atmosphere was a 7/10. The service however is probably some of the absolute worst I've ever had in Pittsburgh, and I've lived here for 28 years. 

I wish I could recommend this place, as I had high hopes, but unfortunately, I can't say I'd ever go back based on this experience."}
{"text":"We love the food here and have been twice since it opened. First time was really great except the bread on the escargot took away from the dish in my opinion. Second time there tonight to celebrate a special occasion was disappointing. We waited over 45 mins for our entrees to arrive for a table of 2. Table of 4 next to us ordered at the same time as us and had eaten, paid, and left before we received our food. The worst part is the manager clearly was aware of the problem but instead of asking us how our night went, he never came to our table but checked in with all of the tables around us. Disappointing service. The ribeye steak also didn't live up to the $65 price tag--not even close."}
{"text":"Atmosphere and decor are on point. The bar menu and mixologists are some of the best in the city. The pre-dinner biscuits are heaven.  The cod chowder is unexpected and beyond delightful as were the oysters and crab and shrimp appetizer. Only drawback is the pricing.  I dined with a crowd used to dropping $150 pp for dinner, but the prices are outrageous for a city like Pittsburgh which has a very affordable cost of living. Drinks - $15 each.  Bowl of soup -$15. Duck burger (admittedly had foie gras) -$45!  And was underwhelming. And the most insane part? Sauces are $5 each and butter is $3. What? I have never heard of a restaurant charging for butter regardless of how glorious it may be.  I recommend going to the bar for a drink and a seafood app."}
{"text":"New restaurant in downtown Pittsburgh didn't disappoint us. The servers were knowledgeable and very prompt and helped us through the menu. Started out with Caesar salad. Main course was half chicken for myself and head of cauliflower for my companion. Both were excellent. We had creme brulee with coffee for dessert. We plan on coming back and trying the brunch."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. Ryan was an excellent server. Thank you Ryan for a great experience!"}
{"text":"The only thing really wonderful about Or The Whale was the Sommelier Erik, and the wine we had. Both Erik and the wine were extraordinary. We had heard good things and expected to like the place. Unfortunately every thing besides Erik and the wine were either disappointing, mediocre, or awful. The best things to order seem to be the oysters or the cod chowder but the radishes were swimming in salty liver mousse and the the linguine with cockles were so salty as to be inedible!!! And while my husband said the scallop entree was good, at $30 he certainly expected more than 3 scallops on the plate. With so many other places to get great oysters in Pittsburgh these days there is no reason to come back. Save yourself the trip and go to Union Standard or Muddy Waters or Poulet Blue."}
{"text":"I don't know who gave this place 4 stars but they're delusional.   Pittsburgh has several of the best new restaurants in the country. This is not one of them.  
The place is seafood themed but they had only two fish selections on the menu.  We settled for something else and every item we ordered was sub-par and overpriced.  If you want to compete in the high-end Pittsburgh restaurant market, you have to do better that this."}
{"text":"Dinner in the bar followed by brunch in the main restaurant the next day. The wait-staff truly made this venue shine. They were utterly dedicated to making the experience delightful for us and our school-aged kids, and knew the menu well. 

The kitchen was solid both times, delivering nicely on the menu's promise."}
{"text":"Farm-to-table done so well!

The atmosphere & decor are beyond lovely; from the story book menus and sea blue coffee mugs, to the gorgeous presentation of the dishes, everything was so thoughtfully done.

We had a mimosa and a Bloody Mary; the mimosa was very good and the Bloody Mary was exceptional.

They had a thorough menu that looked great for breakfast, brunch or lunch. As a vegetarian, I felt like I had a lot of unique and yummy options. I had the granola with greek yogurt and steel cut oatmeal, both were excellent. The blackberries in my oatmeal were melt in your mouth. 

One of my FAVORITE things was the lack of any straws except for a metal straw in the Bloody Mary! They said they also have paper straws. I have seen \"farm-to-table,\" \"vegan,\" etc places that put regular straws in all the drinks - WHY :( thank you or The Whale for your conscientiousness!!

Would definitely be back!!!

Lisa"}
{"text":"I really liked this place, I got the octopus appetizer and it was wonderfully prepared and tasted great, I got 2 entrees, the short rib and the bavette(because I couldn't make up my mind)both were out of this world, tons of flavor cooked and where cooked to perfection. If I had one complaint is the price point of the meal was a bit high for Pittsburgh and is one of the most expensive places to eat in Pittsburgh, but you will have a great meal, you can't miss with this place"}
{"text":"Went for lunch/brunch during the work week. Made a reservation but didn't need it b/c it was not crowded. However, we were seated upstairs next to the wall when the downstairs was empty so there was no ambience.  Plus they sat another table right next to us so we could hear each other's conversations.  Had the chowder & caesar salad, chowder was very good but the caesar salad was was overdressed so it ended up wilty.  Also I thought I fully read the menu to make sure there were no anchovies on it but didn't know that \"fried boquerone\" = anchovies.   $32 later for a cup of soup :(  No thanks."}
{"text":"We recently had a 21st birthday party for our daughter and 13 of her friends. The restaurant was so accommodating with our large group. They even had menus printed with \"Jordi's 21st Birthday Menu\"  The food was excellent and the service was outstanding. Rose, the person who helped me coordinate the party was so nice to work with. Kudos to the staff for helping us pull off this surprise party and making it a wonderful experience.  We highly recommend the Gingerbread Bubble Waffles, Grilled Cheese/Tomato Soup and the delicious Chicken Sandwich!"}
{"text":"Had the Savory Bubble waffle. It was at least as good as I was expecting and probably more. Good portion of food. The bacon had an excellent smoke flavor and corn meal waffle was different, in a good way. The whole thing was delicious. She had the Herb Baked Egg. It too was delicious (for the first few minutes she was Mmm-ing with every bite). It tasted very good but would probably be too rich for me, I'm sure I wouldn't be able to finish that. Price was more than I'd normally pay for brunch but it was a nice splurge and well worth the price for something you're not going to find at most brunch places."}
{"text":"Their food is AMAZING. But there's one big catch. These guys get really confused by take out orders. It doesn't make sense because they are a restaurant in a hotel. But for the average office worker in downtown, this place is basically hostile to lunch time takeout. They are really missing out on a big market by being like that."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed it! I can see that folks had some varying experiences but I think they seem to really be trying to work out the kinks. We had Chesapeake Bay oysters to start which were fresh and delicious. Then a creamy, flavorful Caesar salad. And lastly, special of sea bass with clams and fennel sausage that was amazing - think they should add to the menu permanently!!  The cocktail (Allegheny) was a little fruitier than I would've liked but I like my drinks boozy. All in all, a lovely experience! Including service as well!"}
{"text":"I came here for brunch with some friends yesterday morning. This space inside of the Distrik Hotel (sp?) is small, but it is two floors. If you made a reservation for a group, your whole party has to be there before you be seated (FYI). Once we were seated, our drink orders were taken. They had the standard brunch drinks (mimosas, bellinis, bloody Mary's, beer, etc). The food menu was short, but they had a variety of different options for every taste bud. I decided on the smoked salmon dish. From reading the description, I didn't really know what to expect,  but I tried it anyways. I wish I would have gotten a picture of it because it was very interesting (and tasty!!). There was a bed of greens on the left, and surrounding the greens was smoked salmon and cucumbers rolled up to look like roses. In the middle of the plate was three slices of grilled bread (so hearty and so good) and there was also a soft boiled egg and some kind of sauce with capers in it. I ate the whole thing, it was so good! My other friends got the eggs benedict with the crab cakes, and the American breakfast. Everyone was so good! The service was superb. They even had an employee dressed like a captain walking around, I thought it was a cute touch. 

The only issue I had, was that we had a reservation for 10:30 a.m. and they were already out of yogurt for the granola dish. I read other Yelp reviews and they said or, The Whale was out of ingredients for the day on other days too. 

Other than that, I can't wait to come back for dinner one day!"}
{"text":"Had an average brunch here, although I suspect that their dinner offerings are much stronger.  I do want to say that the restaurant itself is beautiful.  The entrance is upstairs and overlooks the downstairs dining area, with a stunning mural of a whale (Moby Dick?) against the back wall.  Tables and booths are located here, with an open kitchen to the right.  Really cool spot.  We only got a few items off of the menu, one being the Eggs Benny, and nothing really stood out.  The English muffin that came with the Eggs Benny wasn't toasted and didn't have much taste to it.  The ham was overly salty and thin, and I honestly had better at Eat 'n' Park.  I probably won't be back for brunch, but if you're someone who enjoys trying new places it's probably worth checking out at least once. 

One odd thing that happened here was that my card was charged twice.  When I called up and advised Or, The Whale of the mistake, they said that because they are a \"high end\" restaurant, credit card companies charge it twice, the first time being a hold that gets lifted after a week, and the second time for the meal.  I still don't think I understand the reasoning behind this, as I can't remember this ever happening to me before."}
{"text":"A unique restaurant located in Downtown Pittsburgh, where good seafood is hard to come by. Their fish and shellfish are sustainably and locally farmed/caught. It has a beautiful ambience and excellent service- their hosts/waitresses are amicable and knowledgeable. Their menu is diverse- seafood and steak restaurant with a bit of twist.  We visited them for the first time for our anniversary dinner and they were so very friendly/excited for our occasion!
I had their fish special, rainbow trout, and my husband had the seafood stew.  Both entrees were cooked flavorfully. However, their a la carte vegetable sides were somewhat undercooked although rich in flavor.  We had 1/2 dz oysters - they were also locally caught. They were fresh and delicious but I hope they will bring in west coast oysters to diversify their oyster options. This is considered a high-end restaurant and would come out to about $50-70/head.  However, the portions were huge and we did leave satisfied with lots of leftovers. 
I am excited to go back there again- lots of interesting items on the menu to be had!"}
{"text":"You rarely can go wrong when ordering an \"American breakfast\"-two eggs any way you like them, a choice of meat, toast and potatoes. With this entrée you got both bacon and sausage score!  The scrambled eggs were good, the potatoes solid plus the sausage was fantastic and had a nice spicy kick to it.  The grilled bread was tasty and they had a homemade jam you can ask for.  I did not leave hungry! The menu had a lot of good choices. A few in our party started with the monkey bread and it was a warm, sugary delight. It was all a bit pricy but what can you expect at a hotel restaurant.  Our waitress was great and loved the décor."}
{"text":"Went to brunch with a friend this past Sunday. Food was excellent- he ordered the crab cake eggs benedict and I got the savory waffle (highly recommend- perfect combination of savory and sweet, would order again). Both were delicious, I would bathe in the hollandaise sauce. Do not miss the monkey bread!!!! Service was excellent, we spent a lot of time talking after our meal since it was before the brunch rush and the servers were very attentive filling our waters. Highly recommending to any friends looking for a fancy brunch or visiting the Pittsburgh area! The location is pretty central to the city but the parking could get a little tricky if you don't want to valet or park in a garage."}
{"text":"This is a beautiful restaurant that consists of two floors, open in the middle for great views of the downstairs. I really love the open quality. We used valet parking ($8) and had our coats checked by the hostess. We were seated downstairs at a table for 2 in the middle of the restaurant. Tables are spaced out well enough that you aren't on top of the other patrons and the noise level isn't out of control.  
Our waiter and all other staff were attentive and knowledgeable. We started with the shrimp and crab cocktail and the focaccia bread that was brought to the table. Both were delicious and we could have eaten lots more of both. I had the cod chowder which was really decadent and delicious, great savory flavor. My friend had the Caesar salad which also looked good and fresh.  Our chosen entrees were the pork chop and the bavette steak. The pork chop was met with rave reviews, the steak had great flavor and was cooked as asked but was extremely chewy. For dessert we tried the cheesecake, the bee sting cake and the salted peanut tart. All were excellent but the stand out was the bee sting cake. Baked in a crock and drizzled with some type of sauce this would be something I would every time I ate there."}
{"text":"Impeccable service. Came here for brunch and had a warm (almost Southern!) Welcome from both the hostess and my waitress.

Ordered the Shakshuka (one of the only non-dairy breakfast items on the menu).

The flavour of the sauce was absolutely incredible and the eggs were cooked perfectly. The flatbreads were nicely spiced.

Only two critiques: 1. The sauce was very very thin, it would have been 5 star if the sauce was a bit more hearty and tomatoey. 2. The flatbreads soaked up NONE of the sauce! They were so dense and thin, so you end up folding the bread and basically scooping up the sauce like a spoon. 

Small details - otherwise, a great spot for brunch."}
{"text":"Food was spectacular. Sat at the bar and watched Olive making craft cocktails. What a treat. Always good watching someone who takes pride in what they do."}
{"text":"Our server was pleasant but our meal took FOREVER to come out. We got there at 1945 and did not get our dinner until 2100, AFTER I said something. My chicken was lukewarm and the mussels in the clam bake were gritty with a fishy smell to it.  Portions were small and unimpressive. Interestingly, they took care of the next table's bill while all the manager could tell us is \"I'm sorry we just opened two weeks ago\"... I wonder if it's because my table was Asian descent while the other is all blondes... NEVER COMING BACK HERE. DO NOT RECOMMEND."}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed at the quality and consistency of both food and service, especially for the steep price of over $400 for our table of 4.  Our table had 2 strip steaks, a duck burger and rack of lamb.  The temperatures were unacceptable on 3 of the 4 meals.  The duck burger was raw and not edible.  The rack of lamb was to be medium, one of which was cooked to the correct temperature, but the other was extremely rare.  One of the strip steaks was over-cooked, the last was cooked perfectly.  I have a much broader tolerance for temperature variation when food is prepared on a woodfired grill where temperatures vary greatly and precision is not possible, but they missed the mark by more than a few degrees.  Raw food can never get a free pass no matter how it is cooked (or not cooked).  The bread was outstanding. Excellent flavor and moistness throughout.  The escargot and the shrimp and crab appetizers were also well prepared and perfectly cooked.  The crab was especially exceptional.  Lastly, we were a bit surprised to learn when receiving our check that our iced tea was charged per glass. We're talking regular, nothing special, plain old iced tea.  I'm ok being nickle and dimed if I am getting wowed in the process, the only wow here was $21 for iced tea, really? So all in all, I would give them one last try to see if I caught them on a bad day, but one more meal like the one we just had and they will be off the list for good."}
{"text":"I met some friends for brunch on a cold Sunday morning. None of us had been here and were presently surprised by the friendliness of all the staff from the moment we walked in the door. I loved the open atmosphere of the space and the open view into the kitchen. I had the opportunity to sample the herb baked eggs and the eggs Chesapeake. Both were fabulous. I also enjoyed the peach Bellini. I'm looking forward to trying something else on my next visit."}
{"text":"Swept up into OTW on a Thursday afternoon for brunch.

MONKEY BREAD ($6): After seeing everyone else rave about the monkey bread and that it was MUST GET, we were excited to try it. Unfortunately, it was really dry and we told the server which he did address (thank you so much guy with the red tattoo on his arm!!).
SWEET BUBBLE WAFFLE ($12): This was some crazy fiesta on my plate of fruits and whipped cream and syrup. I do wish that they had the maple syrup on the side though, the waffle could've gotten soggy so I had to eat a bit faster than normal (I'm a slow eater, lol). I would like to try the savory bubble or chef's breakfast next time!

One thing I didn't like was the lighting. It was really dark inside although it was around 1PM. I thought that there would be some more natural lighting but the restaurant is down some stairs, with the front doors being quite a bit far, not allowing a lot of light (hence my dark photo)."}
{"text":"We met up with friends here before a Pens game.  The place is very nice and it's on the lower level of a cool historic building.  The food is quite good and you can tell it's prepared well with fresh ingredients.  The 4 of us shared a $200 steak.  Yea .... you read that correctly.  Don't get me wrong, it was phenomenal  ..... but for $200 I was kind of hoping it came with a lap dance.  That would not have amused my wife in the least bit .... but it would have gotten that coveted 5th star!"}
{"text":"Whoa, what a breakfast. Portland has nothing (that I've tried) that compares to the herb baked eggs here. I was pretty hungry and cold, so there might be a little bias there. I'm sad I'm leaving Pittsburgh today and didn't eat here sooner. Also, outstanding service!"}
{"text":"I had Shakshuka and it was really good but they have best drinks...will go there again"}
{"text":"Came here for a networking happy hour and I was surprised with how much I enjoyed it. From the outside, the building looks like a typical hotel that has it's own bar, but inside the bar is much more modern than expected. There are 2 bars, one upstairs and another downstairs. We were at the upstairs bar, where they had comfortable couches and chairs to relax and talk with people. Small tables in front of the couches had games like chess and Jenga, which was great for entertainment. The service was very attentive and circulated the area filling our water glasses and asking if we needed another drink throughout the night. The happy hour specials are also cheap, I was able to get a beer for $3. We were all very relaxed and comfortable in this bar, almost like we were hanging out in someone's house rather than a public place."}
{"text":"For starters...if you have any desire for great service and fast drinks sit at the bar. Olive will keep you well watered and fed quickly. I ate here once for dinner and once for lunch. The lunch menu is a bit sparse but the selection is divine. I chose the Octopus (lunch) which was amazing and the linguini with cockles (dinner) which was excellent. At dinner they serve a homemade biscuit with bacon butter that will leave you wondering if you made a mistake by ordering an entrè...I promise you it's not a mistake. The food ,service, and location  here are fantastic."}
{"text":"A friend of mine wanted to meet for a drink and some dinner so we decided to check out this new place.  The tables were totally booked so we took a seat at the bar (check out the cool wall paper, by the way).  The service was attentive considering a full restaurant with many drink orders flying in.  

I began my meal with the cod chowder.  Priced at $15, I was a bit incredulous, but I have to say this was the very best and most unique chowder I have ever had the pleasure of eating.  The piece of cod was thick and succulent placed center bowl with a beautiful garnish of red radish, julienne strips of leeks, and seated over a selection of gorgeous young potatoes.  The broth?! Oh my gosh, the broth!  It was so rich and layered with gorgeous seafood and butter flavor perched over the onion/celery back notes.  Truly delightful and I will return just for the chowder.  No lie.

My entrée was the scallops.  I don't feel they were as successful as the chowder because the corn puree was just too sweet.  It overpowered the delicate taste of the scallops and the tender herb salad.  I liked them but was hoping for more scallop flavor. 

We skipped the dessert this time but would like to try it next time.  I love that we have a new fine dining option downtown.  Wishing this team all the best as they continue to refine their menu in the coming months."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Whale for our anniversary. When we made the reservation they had inquired as to whether our reservation involved a special occasion . Pretty cool, because the entire waitstaff congratulated us after we arrived.. Nice touch. Also they provided a complimentary glass of champagne. Very classy. These touches did make for a very special beginning to our dinner.
As a general matter our dinner was a positive experience. Ambiance was good. The food was well prepared, but there was nothing exceptional about it. I probably would have awarded another star except for the following:
1. Our waitress was totally unprepared. She did not know the specials nor the various preparations. Also her service skills definitely need improvement. She was friendly but disappeared for long stretches. We spent almost 3 hours there after being seated, much of it waiting for our waiters return. For the prices at this restaurant they definitely need to use a higher level of waiter/waitress.
2. This restaurant uncharges you for EVERY THING. I was charged $3 for butter to go with my $50 lobster. My wife was charged $3 of chimmichurri sauce.  Fortunately I did not order French fries-- I am pretty sure I would have charged me for the ketchup. Come on man, this restaurant will really turn off patrons if it continues it's ticky tacky up charge practices.
3. This place holds itself out as a seafood place but only had 2 seafood entrees. Frankly, the menu items ( especially appetizers) were not very extensive.
4. Seems they should update the restaurant seats. My seat reminded me of long grade school days sitting on a hard wooden ( not very comfortable chair).
This restaurant is relatively new so I assume they are still working out the kinks. May try again later to see if they improve the experience"}
{"text":"HORRIFIC experience. 
-- We Arrived on time for our 8:30 dinner reservation, and were asked to wait at the bar until our table was ready... first no big deal...
-- 30 mins later, I asked the host when our table was going to be ready.  He mentioned that the table would not be ready for about 20 mins...
-- I angrily started to walk back to my party at the bar, and decided to turn around and ask if they would give us and appetizer while we waited.  The states they were not allowed to do that, but would send the manager over.
-- the manager came introduced himself.  I explained that we could choose an app.  We chose the mussels.... SOLD OUT!  He then suggests that we choose 2- the escargot and the trout rillette.  We see a bread basket go by and ask if we could have bread as well.
-- 15 mins later no bread, and the rillette arrives. Imagine an elongated tortilla chip and a tiny jar trout spread.....FOR 4 OF US TO SHARE!  The escargot arrived at the same time our table was ready. We were finally seated at 9:30 for our 8:30 reservation
-- upon arriving at our table no water and no sign of  a server.  15 mins into sitting there.  The manager came to the table-- \"I know you are already disappointed so I just want to let you know everything that we are out of\" he then continues to list that they are out of the mussels, monk fish, short rib, carrots, and broccoli.
-- this was the breaking point-- we chose to walk out at 10pm from our 8:30 dinner reservation.

The very worst part of the entire experience was that not 1 person apologized through the entire time we were there.  Customer service fixes a lot and this staff lack it!"}
{"text":"I have driven past this place so many times and I always said I wanted to try it, so finally tonight, I did. I was extremely pleased! 

The first thing you notice about this place is the decor. It has the Nantucket, on the sea feel. From the ropes and netting to the wallpaper, the decor matched the theme and food. The lighting is dim but not too dim so that you can't see. 

I sat at the bar and my service was great! The girls at the bar were very attentive and greeted me the moment I sat down. I got my food quickly. I didn't have a drink, however, but it looked like they had an array of liquor and made pretty unique drinks. 

I ordered the wedge- which came in a very large bowl. It sort of felt unnecessary but it didn't matter once I started to dig in. The thick cut bacon was a delicious match to the cheese and the buttermilk ranch they use. It tasted homemade and they also made it special by adding dill. I also loved the pickled onions, that really made this salad over the top for me. This could've been a meal itself, honestly. It was lovely. 

For my main dish I had the half of chicken and the crab Mac and cheese. It was really delicious. The mustard chicken jus and lemon paired together so nicely with the chicken, as well as the endives and even the raviolo. It was very lemony but not overpowering and I love that. The skin on the chicken was crispy and the chicken itself was moist. I loved the endive, especially the crunch and char on it. The crab Mac was crunchy and creamy and everything a Mac should be. It had big chunks of crab and a good crab taste. So so good. 

What I ordered was A LOT of food. I didn't realize the portions were going to be so big. I definitely have another meal or two left. 

Although prices are a bit steep here, the food is quality and definitely worth it. I would eat here compared to other high end restaurants down town."}
{"text":"I never heard of or, The Whale until my girlfriend invited Chris and I to go out for dinner Friday night with a group of other couples. After doing some research, I realized that it hasn't been open all that long... so I couldn't count on my trusty Yelp reviews! The menu looked unique and delicious- I was super excited to be one of the first to check it out!

We had dinner reservations for 8 of us on a Friday night. The location of or, The Whale is in the new Distrikt hotel downtown. The atmosphere inside is very unique and is based off of Moby Dick. Every single detail in this restaurant is thought out from the nautical themed ceilings down to the chapter book menu. There was a raw bar and smaller tables upstairs but we were seated downstairs which was great for a large group! It wasn't as crowded as I thought it would be for just recently opening but it was a very relaxing atmosphere which was perfect after a long work week. 

For my drink, I ordered the house gin and tonic. It was served with rosemary as a garnish and was super refreshing! Others around the table enjoyed an array of cocktails that they also enjoyed. For our meal, Chris and I decided to share one of the smaller seafood towers. It had shrimp, mussels, clams and oysters. We also ordered a side of the hot sauce to put on the mussels which was good! The shrimp on the tower was the biggest shrimp I've ever seen and was so good! The seafood tower was a nice light meal for 2 people but was way over priced for what you receive. My only complaint about or, The Whale is their prices but it is a fun and unique place to check out in downtown Pittsburgh for a night out."}
{"text":"I have no words to describe this place! The food is next level delicious. I've been in a  thorough search for the best eggs Benedict in town (I'm new in Pittsburgh) and I got the eggs Chesapeake here and they immediately became my new favorite all time brunch meal.
My friends and I shared the dark chocolate mousse and the crème brulee and they were PERFECT.
Apart from the amazing food and the beautiful navy decoration, the service was incredible! I asked for tea and Our lovely server, Cindy, brought us a full tray of the different teas they have. She also gave us a full description of every plate/drink we ordered. She was very attentive, helpful and sweet and made our brunch an even better experience.
This is our new FAVORITE BRUNCH PLACE. And the great deal is that they have it 7 days a week!!

Thank you Or, the Whale for helping me complete my brunch research."}
{"text":"Very good food and service. The grilled octopus was awesome, just wish it had been a larger portion but grilled flavor was fantastic and very tender. Staff was friendly and the atmosphere was neat."}
{"text":"Great experience from the waiter, to the food and the whole ambiance of the restaurant. Really enjoyed my brunch this morning ordered the sharshuka which was amazing I don't eat eggs  so the waiter and kitchen was super accommodating and made mine to fit my dietary restrictions. Also had a side order of the root veggies wow thoes where incredible. My family all had the Chesapeake bay benedict which was also was an amazing dish great flavors and they also enjoyed the nice small salad it helped lighten up the dish great food, great service !!!!!"}
{"text":"Incredible new restaurant down town! Has a very cool vibe to it, the atmosphere is relaxed and the staff were very educated and excited to make our experience memorable. The menus have a lot of options and everything we ordered was fantastic. Loved the herbed bread in the beginning! The cod chowder was incredible! Great seafood and meat joint - def would recommend"}
{"text":"The chef's food was absolutely excellent. The environment was very cool and the staff was very friendly. The scallops were delicious!"}
{"text":"So many good things!! The atmosphere is amazing! Kudos to the decorators for creating such an inviting place!! The biscuits and butter served first are delicious - a great start to the meal. The wedge salad was delightful, but I could have done without the extra large wooden bowl that it came in - was somewhat awkward to maneuver. My spouse ordered the $45 duck burger and said that, while it was good, it was not $45 good. He was bummed that he did not order a steak. My scallops were AMAZING!! Perfectly cooked and the corn purée underneath was the perfect complement. We were too stuffed to try dessert.  

The bad thing for us, was our table. We were seated upstairs in the far corner. Within minutes of us getting settled another table was seated right next to us. As is the unfortunate trend in many fine dining establishments, this table was WAY too close for comfort. To make it worse, the other side of our table was smack up against the server POS station. We spent our evening trying not to hear everything the couple next to us said and trying to avoid the \"rear view\" of the servers as they put their orders in. Not what you would call \"romantic\" at all.  

The other \"bad\" for me was when the couple next to us left and the hostess came to clean the table. She cleared the plates, lifted the placemats, wiped the table and then put the DIRTY placemats back on the table - never wiped them off. As you can imagine, we found this a bit off-putting. 

Being that oTW just opened on Wednesday, I know there are some kinks that still need to be worked out, and I will not let that stop me from returning!! The food was delicious and the atmosphere very welcoming. We are anxious to try a steak on our next visit!"}
{"text":"We're staying in Pittsburgh for the short film festival, and stopped in for brunch at the recommendation of the concierge of the Distrikt Hotel next door. The space was lovely with lots of nice, ambient touches. I'm a book nerd, so I particularly enjoyed all of the literary + nautical touches. But all of that is just window dressing and doesn't matter at all if the food doesn't deliver. Luckily ... it did. 

We had the savory waffles -- with hollandaise and maple syrup, bacon, sausage, egg, and potatoes. It was a mountain of breakfast deliciousness, the perfect balance of savory and sweet. My kiddo -- who is three and enjoyed getting to spy on the cooking, looking into the open kitchen from the top level -- got the oatmeal, which was so tasty. Topped with caramelized bananas and fresh blackberries, it was amongst the most impressive oatmeal dishes I've ever seen. 

The service was awesome -- our waitress Stephanie made some great recommendations of where we might take our toddler to play nearby -- and even stopped us on our way out the door with a last minute idea. 

Thank you for the great experience!"}
{"text":"This was an amazing experience. The service was excellent, very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. The mussels in particular were spectacular, and the complimentary biscuits melted in my mouth. It was my friends birthday, and they gifted us with probably the best cheesecake I've ever had. It was an excellent meal for a special occasion. Well worth the price!"}
{"text":"So, I'm rooting for this place.  Great vibe, great service.   However it is downtown pricey making it an option for those special occasions.   Bread was good, escargot tasty but could benefit from some seasoning, the Mac and cheese was luxurious, the clam bake good and the mussels filling. Anyway, great place for special occasion or want to impress a date who adores seafood."}
{"text":"The Sunday Brunch Bunch visited OTW this past Sunday and I think would all agree: the setting - awesome; service - delightful; food - solid! The prices were actually less than I expected and I got away with a $25 bill. My buddy Jack walked out after spending $42 so there's that. I'd skip the drinks if you can get by on water - haha. $5 for an unsweetened iced tea?! Melville would be mortified, but I digress. Amongst our group we ordered Herb Baked Eggs, a Savory Bubble Waffle, two versions of Eggs Bennedict, a Croque Monsieur and an American Breakfast. No one left disappointed or hungry. My herbed baked eggs were probably the lesser of the dishes, but I didn't mind. A bit too much \"herb\" and a bit oily, but not a terrible concept. Brunch competition in this town is TOUGH, so I'm not sure I'd go back again and again, but it was a lovely visit."}
{"text":"The Jury is Out

To be fair we dined here before the official Grand Opening - so will give it another try.

The wait staff was not very knowledgeable about the menu, and not very attentive to the table. The kitchen was in full view, and seemed very disorganized. Several at our table had ordered the Duck Duck Goose only to be told 10 minutes later that they were out.

I had the scallops - they were good, but not outstanding. Several at our table had the En Papillote, which lacked any seasoning. We were expecting much more especially for the price. I don't mind paying more if the food is outstanding, but unfortunately it was lacking. 

Loved the atmosphere and decor. Will give it one more try before writing off."}
{"text":"We had a great time at The Whale! Everyone on staff was fantastic and extra kudos to Cindy, our waitress as well as the hostess. Cindy was so patient and polite. She was very knowledgeable and made great suggestions. The hostess was also very patient and helped us get a table that met our needs including a wheelchair, high chair and our big stroller. 

The food was so good. Get the Monkey Bread!!

We'll be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Outstanding birthday dinner here on a snowy and cold Sunday night.  We started in the bar section and I got one of their signature drinks with bourbon.  it was nice, albeit a bit strong.  I followed it up with a cosmo which I don't think anyone has ordered in like 15 years, but they did a great job.  My third drink was a flirtini and I had to explain how to make it and they were spot on.  Props for making a drink on the fly to the bartending staff.  I ended the evening with a decaf coffee which I was not impressed with.  Not sure what was wrong with it, but it just didn't taste right. 
For starters, we had the Hollywood oysters.  I hadn't ever heard of this type before, but the waitress's explanation of briney with a cucumber finish was precise.  I then had the cod chowder.  The broth is mixed in at the table and was outstanding.  Fingerling potatoes and a lovely piece of cod finished it off.  Zach got the wedge salad which was excellent but came in this ridiculously large wooden bowl.  I get it, it was cute, but way too big.  I then had the cockles and linguine.  I would be lying if I didn't just get this because they talk about cockles in Game of Thrones and I had never eaten them.  They are very similar to clams, but have a slightly different flavor.  This came with a light cream sauce and sea beans which are very salty and I was instructed to mix them in.  It was delicious if you like salty things, which I do.  Zach got the fish stew and wow, spicy!  Good, but spicy.  We finished off the meal with the apple tart and ice cream.  The crust was so buttery and outstanding. 

I definitely want to come back for another dinner to try one of the towers and for brunch which sounds delicious.  Fabulous fish addition to Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"The savory waffle is the best thing I think I've ever had.  The waffle is sweet and savory, and their homemade sausage is the perfect compliment.  New cuss words need to be invented to fully describe how good this dish is.  If you come here and don't get this, you need to sit by the garbage and reevaluate your life choices."}
{"text":"Our new favorite Pittsburgh brunch spot!  Great decor, friendly and attentive staff all around. We started with the monkey bread, a real treat for the table. The savory bubble waffle offered a filling combination of flavors and textures that was unexpected and different than anything our well-brunched family has had elsewhere. The American breakfast offers perfectly cooked bacon and sausage, eggs to order, grilled break and well-seasoned fingerling potatoes with just the right amount of crisp. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We picked this place to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday and we're glad we did. :) The environment was cozy and the staff was super friendly. We started with half dozen oysters; definitely some of the better ones we've had in town. For entrees, he order the clam bake and I got the scallops. The clam bake had some uniquely delicious flavors, but some of the clams were not as fresh, unfortunately. The dayboat scallops, on the other hand, were absolutely deciduous - definitely the highlight of the meal! While we waited for our desserts, the staff surprised us with a birthday cake! That's how we ended up eating three desserts for the night. :P Overall it was a great experience, and we'd definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"We went here for brunch and it was a good experience. The food was fresh and flavorful and the restaurant is very nice- it's a brand new space. We had the savory bubble waffle and eggs Chesapeake and both were nice size portions and were delicious. 

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the service. It was very slow. We were seated for about 20 minutes before we even placed our order and waited 15-20 minutes at the end for the server to process our payments. Our total time for brunch was about 2 hours, which is longer than usual in ny opinion."}
{"text":"It was nice but I would probably not go out of my way to take anyone there for brunch. I would say just try it out if you are in the area but don't go out if your way. I just didn't get completely wowed with my meal and my friend with me left in an utter rage and would probably give one star if she used yelp. She got the eggs benny and her eggs were extremely runny and her salad had no dressing on it at all. She described it as dry leaves on her plate. My meal was okay but it was cold, purposely but I didn't know I was being served a non heated meal. It was hard boiled eggs, cold, mildly fatty ham, flavorless cheese, dried apricots, some pickled mix of stuff I didn't know what it was and a few small wedges of very chewy bread. I would not order the chefs breakfast again. I also would never order the eggs benny (what my friend ordered). The positives were that that restaurant is well themed and very nice to look at. Another negative was that the bartender took the sugar for my friends coffee away and gave it to the couple next to us without asking and never offered to return it even tho my friend got another coffee. The blood Mary was tasty but when the drink is as much as your breakfast I wouldn't order more than one! It was $10 - which I suppose is fine but the food should have been better."}
{"text":"Amazing ambiance! My house G&T that Michelle recommended was so refreshing with a grapefruit garnish. Will definitely be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Came here for a fancy date night on a Monday evening. The restaurant had mostly empty tables when we arrived, so we were seated quickly and the server came to greet us to take our drink orders and see if we had questions regarding the menu. They have quite the book menu, so our waitress went through each \"chapter\" with us. We put in orders for the drinks (a Tuxedo and I've forgotten the name of the drink I got, but it reminded me of a mojito) and started looking through the menu. 

The interior was quite beautiful, and we had a nice time looking at the decorations and art on the walls waiting for our drinks. After about 20 minutes, the drinks arrived and were delicious and really beautiful! Unfortunately, on an empty stomach, I didn't want to have too much alcohol too quickly. it took awhile to find the waitress to get our orders in - about 20 minutes after we got our drinks, so a total of 40 minutes after being seated on what appeared to be not too busy of an evening. Longer than what we hoped, but we were in no rush. 

We got the smoked trout rillettes to start, which arrived pretty quickly. It had a nice side salad, two crostini, and seasoned cucumber as well. The spread was rich and delicious - a great pairing with the rest of the starter. They also brought over two buttermilk chive biscuits with butter which were soooo delicious! 

(After eating all of that, I was able to dig into my drink more as well :))

For the main course, my boyfriend got the NY Strip Steak with Beef jus and sides of mashed potatoes and cauliflower, and I got the half roast chicken with a side of crab Mac and cheese (I am a sucker for Mac & cheese).

Steak - Medium rare, great flavor and great paid with the jus. 
Cauliflower - grilled well and a super big serving! Looked like half a head of cauliflower on a plate! 
Mashed potatoes - Very creamy and well seasoned. Super tasty.

Chicken - cooked well and also came with braised endive and a raviolo (was like a ravioli with a soft boiled egg yolk inside). I didn't care much for the dish unfortunately, as the mustard sauce was very strong and was all I could taste on the plate. However, once I dig into the chicken more, it was pretty good.
Crab Mac & Cheese - rich and tasty! 

No room for dessert, but we left with 2 boxes of food and a promise to come back again!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing vibe and RYAN our waiter was awesome! Gave us great food and wine recs!"}
{"text":"We visited Or, The Whale for weekend brunch. The place is absolutely beautiful, with a two level dining room, amazing Moby Dick mural, and many small decorative whaling/literary touches. The staff was also extremely welcoming and professional--both the host and our waitress went out of their way to be pleasant and helpful during our visit. The menu was diverse and interesting and the ingredients of all of the dishes were clearly fresh and carefully sourced. 

Unfortunately, the food didn't go down quite as whale as it could have. We found all of the food pretty underseasoned. I don't think the brunch steak had any salt on it at all, although it was perfectly cooked, so it was very bland. Most of our dishes were on the room temperature side and they didn't all arrive at the same time, so by the time I started eating my dish, the savory bubble waffle, it was barely warm. Aside from the temperature issues, it was generally a pretty good dish. I liked the slight sweetness of the corn waffle and the bubble texture of the waffle was great. The mix of hollandaise and maple syrup was a little weird over the top. 

The bacon was really excellent, a bit chewy and slightly sweet, with all the fat rendered nicely. The monkey bread, which sounds great, was pretty much a disaster. The sweet glaze was grainy and just kinda slopped into the middle of the roll and the center of the bread was completely raw dough. 

Generally, it was a totally fine meal, but there was nothing really spectacular about the food. If I were staying in the hotel, I'd go again, but we probably won't be back."}
{"text":"6 of us went to dinner and each of us had an amazing meal!  From the cocktails to the appetizers then the entres, desserts, and after dinner drinks.  Zach our server made it even more enjoyable.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great food. Interesting concepts. Great atmosphere. Fab drinks. Awesome staff.

Over my stay in Pittsburgh I experienced brunch, lunch and dinner at the restaurant. Everything was beautifully prepared and did not disappoint. Amazing portions. Great options. 

Brunch the Chefs Breakfast was great AND you must get the Monkey bread. Lunch loved the salads. Dinner had drinks at Evangeline which has a great vibe and then amazing steak but don't miss the crab mac and cheese. 

Local and sustainable which is great. Such a helpful staff! Cocktails and wine list - wow! Huge fan of gin drinks and the specials did not disappoint! 

Oh did I mention the oysters?! Wow. 

I recommend it and  the hotel."}
{"text":"I have a ton of food allergies and tend to get uncomfortable when eating out, especially at more upscale places like this one. In fact, it's usually safer for me to order off the kids menu at most places. Or, The Whale made me feel welcome and perfectly comfortable with what I ordered. I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I thought this was a seafood restaurant. I was wrong. 

The steak was one of the best that I can remember. 

The appetizers were fantastic. The halloumi cheese was really wonderful. 

I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"The space itself is really neat, it's two levels and the decor is really cool. We had a great view of the kitchen from above. Our waiter was very attentive and extremely knowledgeable of the menu. They have a great cocktail list and also a lot of beer and wine choices. The menu is cool, it's broken up into chapters. We started with the bread and olives, the latter were fantastic. Another person I was with had the oysters and said they were very good. My entree was the wood plank salmon, the veggies that came with it were excellent but my only hiccup with this place was that the salmon was undercooked, not sure if that was intentional. We ended with the fruit tart, also great. Would definitely recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"Last Friday looking for a new place to get something to eat and a drink. Found that the Hotel in the old Salvation Army Building was open. On the second floor was a spacious cocktail bar, raw seafood and cheese bar. Had sufficient seating areas. It's called Evangeline, opens at 4:00.
Staff friendly and knowledgeable. Limited beers on tap, but good selection of custom cocktails. The small tiered platter from the raw bar was $80, and had enough to keep three of us happy. Pricey but worth it.
Nice to go there on an expense account."}
{"text":"Amazing food!! I will say it's on the pricey side for dinner, but it was so good! My first drink was the house G+T and it was gorgeous with some cities flavors; it was so fresh. We got the shrimp and crab cocktail to start. The flavors were really good on the shrimp and crab. I wish there was enough horseradish in the cocktail sauce to taste. It didn't have any spice to it at all, but that's just my preference! I got the Caesar salad, which was good. Then my entree was the duck burger and it was amazing. I actually miss it. I asked the server to pair a red to the duck, and bring it out with the meal. She worked with the sommelier, brought out a syrah, and it paired perfectly. This meal was awesome and service was great, too!"}
{"text":"Or, The Whale was absolutely adorable and definitely one of the best breakfast joints I've been to. Very fashionable scenery, tables, and place settings. The waitress was very kind, attentive, and knowledgeable, even though it was only her second week.

I had the savory bubble waffle, which was quite filling and delicious. The Bloody Mary was great too. The rest of my family had the crabs egg benedict, sweet bubble waffle, banana muffin, and oatmeal. They were all quite tasty. Nothing was completely out-of-this-world though, so I was first inclined to give only 4 stars, but honestly the fashion and ambiance of this place pushes it to 5 stars."}
{"text":"They've really thought out the detail at this restaurant. The staff's attire, menus, decor, everything really plays into the whole theme. The food is very good and the menu is large for a farm/sea fresh place. I don't eat meat or seafood, so usually I get a salad at these restaurants but Or offered a vegetable dish that was awesome. I was with meat and sea food eaters, all loved their food. My dad is usually very critical and said the oysters were the best he has had in awhile (chefs choice). The staff is extremely friendly. A bonus was the restaurant has eliminated plastic straws which are harmful to the ocean."}
{"text":"Fabulous food, decor, and excellent service (Stephanie made great recommendations for brunch....was a wealth of knowledge, catered to our requests and answered my 99 questions). 
I would highly recommend the Savory Bubble Waffles and the Crab Cakes. 
We had the opportunity to chat briefly with the Director of Operations (Jessica) and the General Manager (Alex)...both extremely friendly, I have already passed the word to my team members. I can see a team \"field trip\" to \"Or, The Whale\" in our future."}
{"text":"When it rains it pours they say and it surely seemed like a hurricane the day my friend and I dined here for lunch. We had reservations since it was restaurant week because we didn't want to chance dropping in. We were seated/greeted right away. 

We both had picked out our lunches prior to arriving and we both went with the or, the whale burger. She wanted hers done \"medium rare\" and I prefer mine \"medium well\". The first course was a choice of soup or salad. I went with the vegetable chowder and she went with the Caesar salad. These items should have been brought to our table timely, but they didn't arrive until 30 minutes later. Somehow they ran out of soup at 11:30 am. This was pretty frustrating because these things shouldn't take long to bring to a table. However, I will say the soup was the highlight to this meal because it continued to go down hill from here. 

The first bite I took out of the burger was pretty much raw with some blood left on my plate. My friend ended up with my burger and I ended up with hers. Our waitress took the burger back to have it cooked more. My friend ended up eating hers anyway, but mentioned it was flavorless. 

The third course was a chocolate chip cookie which I was really looking forward too since their pastry chef makes them fresh daily. However, the cookie was pretty small and solid. I was hoping it would be soft and warm. They were nice enough to take half off our checks, but I'm not sure if I would return given the lack of organization."}
{"text":"I was thinking to myself: Chef Dennis Marron might have a few things in common with Herman Melville, the American novelist who wrote \"Moby-Dick; or The Whale\".  *One thing would be the degree of detail both men employ in their craft. Melville was known for his intensely passionate and detailed prose about whales. Chef Dennis and his team think through EVERY detail of the WHOLE dining experience, beyond the food. The color scheme in everything--walls, seats, pillows even the dishware feels calming and peaceful as a day on the boat. The roped hoisting lines on the ceiling and the open kitchen that resembles a ship galley--pretty cool. And you just can't overlook the purposely tattered book menus and \"torn/worn\" book pages that accompany the plated dishes. How about the serving staff --- all tatt'ed and bearded and gorgeous in those merchant uniforms? (heart eyed emoji here) Even the friggin' striped paper drinking straws--adorable and biodegradable!  *Second commonality, both men experimented with \"form.\"  Melville brought his central story of his revenge on the white whale to a screeching halt so that he could instead profusely lecture on the anatomy of whales. Chef Dennis wrote his own modern story by boldly telling a city known for its deep loyalty to Heinz ketchup that, um, he will make you fall madly for his OWN housemade ketchup. (Just order his frittes and you'll see.) No matter what you order here, you'll note that like any great Chef, Marron took what he already knew would work in a seafood/steakhouse restaurant and boldly challenged it--moving beyond it. I've had breakfast, lunch, and dinner here in the last 2 months. The details he brought to the food at OTW are just as swoon-worthy as his restaurant experience. I've had incredible scallops. Shitake gnocchi. A buttermilk wedge salad. Eggs Chesapeake. And the Shakshuka. (dear God, so good!) And there's so much more on this menu I can't wait to taste. *Lastly, for me, I think Marron and Melville both share an authenticity that shines through their art. Both deeply passionate. Both deeply knowledgable and interested in their subject. Both enthusiastic, imaginative and brave. I really liked what he did when he introduced The Commoner. But I LOVE  or, The Whale."}
{"text":"Just stopped in.  Got beer and cod chowder.  Cod chowder had delicious well cooked cod with chowder poured over.  Turned out great."}
{"text":"Went for brunch.  It was good but not great.  If you drive there, you'll have a hell of a time finding a parking spot, which isn't necessarily the restaurant's fault.  We started with a fish based chowder, which was probably the best thing we had.  It was very filling and plentiful.  For our main dish we had a waffle with a poached egg that came with potatoes, bacon, and sausage.  We also had their Egg's Chesapeake, which includes a crab cake.  Both were above average.  For the prices you pay, however, you would expect more.  I would look elsewhere before I come back."}
{"text":"My three-year-old son wanted to take the train into the city so my wife and I decided to grab a meal. We decided on Or, the Whale Because it was close to her work though we realized that it was an upscale place. It was a little hard to find but the ambience was fantastic. We got the cod chowder for an appetizer. My wife got the seafood stew and I went for the scallop with butternut purée.  So there is no formal kids menu yet, they told us that it was in the works. They gave us a Fantastic number of options that were given in a four piece sectional plates. My daughter chose the grilled cheese and my son had the pasta with vegetables with Yogurt and cookie. Everything was fantastic. The service was excellent. The cocktails were tasty. This is definitely one of my favorite places in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Had reservations. Never got sat after dropping $100 at the bar. I'll never be back. Pathetic host was too busy combing his greasy pony tail to care about customers."}
{"text":"I didn't expect to have such good quality food in a hotel restaurant but I'm glad to be proven wrong. This seafood place has a unique and modern twist on traditional seafood."}
{"text":"Long wait for service and food. However the food is well worth the wait. Friendly staff who do try.  Farm to table type of dining.  Cheese served and stretched table side.  Good options on menu. Would go back.  Wish they had outdoor seating."}
{"text":"I WANTED to love it.  But honestly did not.  Pittsburgh is a rough market.  And with all the competing new places...I don't know when/if I'll be back.  

I went with a date to Pittsburgh Restaurant Week.  I was really wary of this.  I've never done Restaurant Week.  I was worried that maybe they'd have something \"off menu\" to showcase the restaurant then if I came back some other time I wouldn't be able to find it.  I confirmed that the selections were available and perused the menu just to see if something REALLY jumped out at me.  

It didn't.  That sounds negative, but I don't mean it to; the restaurant week menu looked good.  I didn't see anything that said...\"Try me I am way more amazing\".  

The waiter seemed knowledgeable, and was helpful and attentive.  The ambience was...pretty, but not particularly memorable once you get past the statement-mural of moby dick launching over the bow of the Pequod (I assume that's the Pequod...*insert 30 minute google search for diagrams of Nantucket whaling vessels*...it's probably the Pequod), the only truly decoratively arresting feature would be a series of thick parallel ropes festooning the length of the ceiling.  I did like that the restaurant was two levels, and the stairway was eye-catching.  

I don't recall the drink menu.  Does that mean it's not memorable?  I suppose by definition it WOULD mean that, but my short term memory is a bit suspect more and more lately.  So maybe the drinks are good.

Anyway...good seafood.  I enjoyed the experience.  But it was nothing that a dozen other restaurants can't match."}
{"text":"You absolutely must have the fries at some point, I have no idea what kind of crazy voodoo shit they do to them but they are the best I've ever had! Make sure to ask for Nami the bartender and let her craft some crazy concoctions for you!"}
{"text":"We came to this restaurant as part of a holiday work function, so my experience is probably a little bit affected by that.  The service started very efficiently, but it did get slower as the meal went on (again, there were like 20 of us, so that's certain to have contributed to the wait).  Staff was very friendly though.  In terms of the food, I was really impressed.  The very small salad in a very huge bowl was a little odd, but the portions on the rest of the food were very satisfying.  We started with seafood towers, charcuterie/cheese board, and some crab dip and grilled octopus....I only tried a little bit here and there, but everyone was raving about it.  I had the seafood stew...spicy, but excellent.  Reminded me of a cioppino, but with more aggressive heat, which I personally like with seafood.  Several people had the short ribs, which were massive and, as I snuck a bite, deliciuos as well.  

Atmosphere is so interesting and perfect for a date night.  The price is hefty, but the quality of the ingredients is enough to justify it in my mind.  Our experience left a good enough impression on us that we're eager to go back and try it on our own (though probably as a special occasion restaurant).  A very nice edition to the Pittsburgh dining scene."}
{"text":"The restaurant is located in a hotel, but easy to find and the location is downtown Pittsburgh. Parking was difficult because it is downtown, but we were able to find a street spot. The inside was beautiful and the decor was nice. Our waitress was extremely friendly and attentive. I loved being able to see the kitchen and cooks while eating because it adds to the feel of the place. The food was delicious, but I did wish they had some more traditional items. Additionally, my boyfriend's eggs Benedict were a bit watery. But he enjoyed the sauce and the taste overall. I was very pleased with my brunch and will be returning for dinner! I highly recommend the monkey bread!"}
{"text":"Came for brunch, Food was really good, we had baked herb eggs.
Everything was fresh and delicious, the restaurant and bar were super nice, will definitely come back for dinner. 
The service from our waiter Tom was excellent and very accommodating. The only reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because the hostess was lazy and non accommodating. We asked if we could have the wi-fi passcode and she said they don't have wi-fi...... really????!!! A hotel in the 21st century without wi-fi??!!! I doubt it. Luckily Tom was more than happy to give it to us.
This hostess needs to learn the main part of her job is being a good host- thus, word hostess!
Other than that , highly recommend 





I did come back for dinner and it certainly didn't disappoint! I had the cod chowder, which was so delicious that I dream about it! Delicious piece of cod with a wonderful chowder poured over the fish and potatoes table side,  just wonderful. I also had the mussels appetizer that was sheer perfection.
I also will be changing my 4 stars to 5 because the hostess Markia ( not sure if correct spelling) was beyond accommodating! 
Fantastic restaurant!!!!"}
{"text":"Looked up new restaurants in the city to take my girlfriend out to before she left town.  The atmosphere was exactly what we were looking for!  Classy but comfortable.  They had a terrific somm on staff, she helped us pair our wine with dinner perfectly. All of our cocktails and food were amazing! Try the octopus--best we've had!  The service matched the quality of the food.  Michelle, our server,  made us feel like an old friend!  The only downfall, tables were too close for intimacy.  Will return!"}
{"text":"We went here for brunch not long after it opened. The host was very nice and accommodating. Our server took great care of us. The Moby Dick theme was charming. The menu is broken down in to \"chapters\" like a novel. I had the chef's breakfast, which arrived on a charcuterie board. Hard boiled eggs, speck, mostarda, dried apricots, grilled bread, and cheddar. Everything was delicious and the portion was just right. Or, the whale is located in the brand new Distrikt hotel. They have valet service but we were able to find street parking a short walk from the restaurant. I'm excited to visit this new addition to downtown Pittsburgh again very soon."}
{"text":"Came with a party of 10 for two birthdays. Food came out cold, overcooked and salty...1.5 hours after we ordered. Overpriced food with an undertrained staff. Terrible experience. My first 1-star review. Only shining star was the decor. I'd recommend anything else for seafood."}
{"text":"So I'll start this with the positive, that kitchen staff had their shit together. They seemed to be on it! Congrats guys! 

But.... 6 reasons it's a no.....

6. I parked in the garage next door. Walked in the side door and was pretty sure I was in the wrong place. No signs for the restaurant.

5. The night started with a drink at the  bar where the hipster bartender complained about Pittsburgh and was excited about his \"assignment ending\". Hopefully that means he's leaving town because WE, speaking for all  of PGH, love this town.

4. We had reservations. Oddly enough when we walked up to the hostess she didn't speak. She didn't say hello. She didn't ask if we had reservations. She looked at a book, nodded and took us downstairs. Maybe we were the only ones? Still confused about that one.....

3. The entire restaurant was empty except one table. We were seated right next to that table. Just the 2 parties in a big ol' space at the same table sharing the same bench....did I mention they had a child and it was her first birthday? How awesome for two old ladies who wanted to drink and cuss. Thanks hostess.... That was fun.......

2. I'm pretty sure the guy who brought us bread, took it, and served to another table and 39 seconds later served us our bread was high. Charming, but totally stoned.

1.  Finally, I thought I was double billed which was nearly $400...when I checked my statement I found that the waiter must not have liked the tip I gave him bc he increased it $10. 

Also, managers, if you are reading this, please listen and don't complain that Yelp Elite pretentiousness has anything to do with it. Your staff needs training in the worst way.  

PS $30 for a drink...the machine that made the drink was broken so I was supposed to get a discount....and...I didn't. Still waiting for those pending charges to come off my bank account!"}
{"text":"Fantastic bar space on first floor.  Good energy and bar overlooks open, modern looking restaurant space below.  Bartenders take care in preparing cocktails.  Appetizer escargot was very well done and the radish was so tasty.  Also tried brunch recently and crab soup and baked eggs were fresh with great flavors.  Finally, the monkey bread is a heavy, rich, pile of goodness!"}
{"text":"Service was awful, the waitress kept interrupting our dinner conversation to ask if we were finished with different dishes, plates, etc. and she cleared the table before everyone was finished. You cannot expect customers to pay these prices and not train your staff. We could have had the same meal at Eddie V's for the price, and the staff there is professional and trained. Food was not bad but the prices are outrageous for the experience. We paid between $50-$100 per person and we were getting pushed out of the restaurant by the server."}
{"text":"I'm actually shocked by the general reviews of this place. I came in with a co-worker during their soft opening phase and we sat at the bar. I forced him to come with me because they posted their lunch special to instagram and it was a Shrimp and Lobster roll that looked amazing. 

The bartender was extremely helpful and attentive and kind. Our lobster rolls came out and while the picture made them look larger than they were, THEY WERE AMAZING. It was more than just shrimp and lobster and I felt they put alot of effort into creating the flavors of it. 

I am actually really excited to go back for dinner and for regular brunch now that they are officially open daily."}
{"text":"Fresh food prepared with care by attentive staff.  Reminds me of California farmers markets with a flair of PA scrapple diner."}
{"text":"Brunch Club found its way downtown and landed on the tail of, Or, The Whale, a restaurant located in the District Hotel on the Blvd. of the Allies.  There was a lot on the corner of Grant, adjacent to the hotel, that had $5 parking.  My one friend parked on the street for free.  Keep in mind, there was not a big sporting event this day so it was a bit easier (and cheaper) to find parking.

The physical space sits at the bottom of the steps when you walk through the front door.  There is a mezzanine so you can look down at the kitchen and everyone dining before you are shown to your table.  Once seated you're surrounded by a nice nautical design - huge thick ropes streaming above to replicate the sail of a boat with great lighting hanging from the ceiling.  The back wall is painted with a scene from Moby Dick, with the whale being the centerpiece.  Staff members are dressed in blue and white striped shirts.  

The menu comes in a booklet with a nice leather cover.  Each page is a different chapter in the book, appetizers, of course, being chapter one.  You get the picture.  

I ordered an Iced Tea and the Eggs Benny, which, mind you, were served on a homemade English Muffin.  The portion was huge and I couldn't finish it.  Sitting across from me, my friend had the Croquet Madam which was even larger with a side of the extremely sugary monkey bread.  One tiny bite of the bread was enough for me - it was almost enough to fuel my trip back to my house.  Each of my friend's portions were quite large and everyone agreed that the portions were more than enough for brunch.  Our server was quick and attentive. 

My only nit-picky criticism is that my iced tea, which was never even refilled, cost $5.  My one friend, who had a Bloody Mary, a cup of coffee, the monkey bread and an entree paid $42 for his meal.  My total bill was $21.40, and I think that is just a little high, but the cost of the iced tea was exorbitant."}
{"text":"Eric was our waiter.   He set the tone for the evening.  My husband and I frequent Pittsburgh, but have never had a meal like this.   We started with a seafood tower. The shrimp was huge, and generally that means huge iodine flavor, but these were fresh and wonderful.   The oysters were perfectly briney and fresh - paired perfectly with the dry prosecco recommended by Eric.   Not a fan of prosecco for it's sweetness, I was somewhat dubious, but it was dry and full bodied at the same time.   Awesome.   Escargot was the very best We've ever had.  I had the monkfish - cooked perfectly with these deep fried parsnip chips and some heavenly light potato purée.  Hubby had a rib eye with herbed butter.  Let me say, the restaurant offers some sauces for the steaks.  It would be sinful to put a sauce on these steaks.   We've been to Berns Steakhouse in Tampa, and Carne Vino in Vegas multiple times.   The quality of the meat is equivalent, but the preparation was better here.   The spices were solid and wonderful.    The ONLY thing we didn't enjoy were the smoked mussels on the seafood tower.   NO BIG DEAL.   There were only a couple.  The bar is so diverse, and the staff so friendly.   This is the best meal we've had in Pittsburgh - and we've been to all of the downtown group (tako, butcher in the rye, floor 2, etc...).   Do yourself a favor and GO NOW!"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant designed in the theme of the original book Moby Dick by Herman Melville. Service was really attentive and the wedge salad was above and beyond expectations. Shrimp and Crab Cocktail can be shared and I was pleased with the Steak Frites. Valet car service available along with adjacent DISTRIKT HOTEL P I T T S B U R G H! Take a peek at the hotel lobby and you will be impressed by the renovations of Salvation Army Building built in 1924."}
{"text":"I recently went to or, The Whale for a friend's birthday. I was excited but slightly nervous because of the prices. I thought it was seemingly slightly overpriced for the options. Our reservation was at 6 but I arrived early and had some cocktails. The drinks were excellent. My favorite was called the \"broken arrow.\" It was a warming kind of bourbon cocktail that even had  Maggie's rum in it (I hate rum) but it was delicious and not overly sweet!

For dinner, I ordered a half dozen of oysters and monkfish that came with parsnips and brown butter. The oysters were pretty disappointing. They just didn't have much of a flavor profile. The monkfish was cooked perfectly! It sounds like an odd \"go-to\" option but I do order monkfish almost every time it is on a menu and this may be the best I have had. I do still have some criticisms. The parsnip was on the plate three ways, pureed, roasted and fried. All three were delicious but the  combination of that and the brown butter was a little too sweet for my taste.   

I liked my meal, I liked the ambiance, I liked the decor and the drinks. I do however think it all comes at a pretty high price that I'm not sure is worth it. I am never going to be that person that says \"this is Pittsburgh, not New York\" in reference to the pricing. Because, we deserve nice things too. I just eat a lot of really great food and I do think that there are restaurants where I have a beautiful meal, get my bill and am in complete shock at how small it is...where I think about how I would have paid double the price for the quality. Overall I really enjoyed the restaurant and would go back again.  I don't think I will rush back though...maybe for a cocktail!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing u have to try this off the menu The Savory- cornmeal waffle, bacon, fried egg , sausage, crisp potatoes with hollandaise, and Paul family farms maple syrup sooooo yummy.. But yes this place you do a quick get away in the heart of Pittsburgh PA. Come down here get a room and enjoy yourself ! The cocktails and apps are amazing and they have 2 bars in addition to a hidden gem the roof top terrace with great views of the city so garb your boo thing and check this place out my YELPERS!!!"}
{"text":"Sadly my experience tonight at Or, The Whale was subpar at best from start to finish. 

My party arrived on time for our reservation only to be told they could not seat us because they had no menus? 7-10 minutes later the hostess & manager arrived back to the hostess stand with menus so we could finally be seated.......How weird. 

Drink & appetizer orders were placed which came out as expected. 

After perusing the menu each member of my party (5 people in total) placed their entree orders which all happened to be different menu items. 

4 out of 5 meals were bland, over cooked, luke warm and not nearly worth the $30/plate we paid. 

I had ordered the flounder with garlic risotto. There was absolutely no flavor- so little flavor I had to ask for salt. I barely took three bites. 

I hoped to explain my dissatisfaction with my meal to my waitress however she was hardly present. The dishes were cleared by a bus boy before I had the chance. 

For a restaurant that almost exclusively serves seafood & steaks, the quality of these items were straight up bad. I was terribly disappointed not only in the food itself but also the service I received. $250 later and I would not at all recommend this restaurant. 1.5 stars if possible."}
{"text":"This place is A-ok indeed. Parking wasn't the easiest but not the worst either. I had a roasted chicken salad and fresh OJ- all were pretty solid. The service definitely left something to be desired, but they're still new and working kinks out I'm sure. The decor is classy too."}
{"text":"My wife and I dined here on 2/15 to celebrate our anniversary. I'm not reviewing the meal or dining experience itself because it was all overshadowed by my experience calling the restaurant to dispute a charge on my debit card. According to PNC, the restaurant charged us the original amount (before tip) that night. The next day they charged us a 2nd time with the tip added. Called the restaurant to dispute the 1st charge. The host answered. I said I was double charged for a meal the other night and would like to speak to a manager. He said very casually \"Oh that happens all the time. That's just something that happens with how our system processes charges.\" \"It just does that with certain banks for some reason.\" He said that it happens \"every 30 transactions or so. It should come off in 3 or 4 days.\" He clearly thought that was the end of the discussion. He then asked \"Did you still want to talk to a manager?\" I did. I didn't get the manager's name. He explained that the problem only happens occasionally. I said \"Both you and the host immediately knew what I was talking about and both treated it incredibly casually. So it sounds like this happens somewhat frequently.\" He said it only happens every \"60, 70 or 80 transactions\" and that the charge would come off in a couple days. I said that didn't work for me. That I can't afford to just have that money hanging in limbo for an unknown number of days. He blamed it on the small payment processing company they use. He at no point said he would do anything to remedy the situation. So I asked for the name of the small processing company. He sounded annoyed and said \"Cayan\" (I later Googled them. One of the biggest in the industry. Valued at over $1 billion. A real Mom & Pop outfit.) I said \"Ok, so you're not going to do anything. That's cool. I guess I'll call Cayan.\" He said \"I never said I wasn't going to do anything.\" To which I replied \"You never said you *were* going to do anything either.\" He said PNC bank has a merchant number he can call and immediately remove the charge when this happens. I pointed out that it was Sunday and the next day was a bank holiday. He said he'd call immediately and if that didn't work he'd call on Monday and Tuesday and call me back when it was taken care of. Tuesday at Noon I called PNC and it had not been removed. They said both charges were still pending and the restaurant would have to call and cancel it. Called the restaurant again. Got a manager named Bill. He told me this happens all the time, everywhere. He said he's \"been in the industry for 30 years and this happens everywhere, it's not just us.\" I said I have been eating in restaurants for 30 years and I've never heard of this happening. He said there's nothing to be done, the charge won't go through, it'll be taken off in 2 or 3 days. I said \"The manager I spoke to 2 days ago said he could call PNC and remove it immediately.\" He did not address this point but instead said \"This happens all the time and nobody has ever complained.\" I said perhaps the average customer at this particular restaurant isn't bothered by a couple hundred dollars, but that's a lot of money for my family. He said that they run the initial charge to ensure the person has sufficient funds before running it again with the tip added. I said that was absurd. I expressed concern that this unauthorized several-days hold on the money could lead to an overdraft. He then told me \"Sir, I can't help it if you don't make good decisions and mishandle your finances.\" Yes. Bill, the manager of Or, The Whale implied that this was my fault. My fault for not being comfortable being charged 200% for my meal without warning. For being too poor for his restaurant. For complaining about the phantom charge that he claims happens at every restaurant, everywhere, every day. He said \"I've been in this industry for 30 years and you're the first person who has ever called in angry and irate about this.\" I pointed out that none of the 3 people I spoke  to expressed any concern or took any responsibility for the ordeal. He said \"Like I said before, I am concerned.\" (He hadn't said it before.) \"And like I said before, I am sorry this happened.\" (He hadn't said that before either.) I asked \"Do you think I am getting any sense of concern or apology from your tone or from anything you've said?\" To which he perplexingly responded \"Sir, I'm not going to get personal with you.\" Wha? He said there was nothing to be done. The charge will come off in a day or 2. It didn't. In fact, the amount of the initial charge somehow changed. It is now the 22nd. One of the charges went through, the other is still pending. I called the restaurant again tonight and asked to speak to a manager and explained why I was calling. No manager was available. Meanwhile, my money is unavailable to me for a over a week because of this place and they made it very clear that they simply do not care."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this new restaurant but was extremely disappointed. First of all it is a hotel restaurant and feels cheap inside with the decor and plastic place mats. Although it may look cheap it is not. The wine and food are both overpriced. The food was mediocre at best. I would never recommend. Such a disappointment."}
{"text":"We stayed at the adjoining hotel while vending at the annual winter beerfest.  We stumbled upon the hotel by accident and couldn't have been happier with the stay and the majority of that comment is from this restaurant.  Our first impression of this amazing place was the super sweet, super amazing Nami.  This young lady knows more about beer than the majority of people that were at the beerfest, to say she's a connoisseur is selling her short.  She was kind, polite and professional while being super friendly and awesome the entire stay.  The food was absolutely amazing!  Everything was not only presented extremely well but was all hand crafted, artisan deliciousness.  Our group was a mix of vegetarian, pescitarian and meat eaters.  We all found amazing choices and everyone raved about every dish.  The french fries have to be the best fries I've ever tasted in my life!  The fish and chips were to die for, they even served it with an amazing malt vinegar that paired so well with the homemade tartar sauce it was explosive!  My friend also commented that the burgers were to die for,  Overall between the gorgeous ambiance, the amazingly awesome staff and the outrageously delicious food, this place is a true gem of Pittsburgh!  We'll be back, very soon."}
{"text":"It pains me to have to write a bad review of this place. This has been at the top of my list for a while now and I was so excited to try it out. I was extra excited when I saw they had a restaurant week special and immediately made a reservation. Sadly, it was disappointing.

After waiting 30 minutes for our appetizer to arrive our waitress came over to notify us that the soup my friend ordered wasn't ready yet and it would be a few minutes longer. She proceeded to ask if there was anything else she could get us in the meantime and we asked if they offer any bread for the tables. She told us she would check but never returned to let us know. Our appetizers did finally come and my friend said the soup was delicious. My caesar salad was a little disappointing but I'm also very picky about my caesar salad.

For the entree we both went with the burger. They mistakenly put my friends well done burger on my plate with my salad and put my medium burger on her plate with her fries. After spending nearly an hour already I decided to just eat it because I didn't have the time to wait for a new burger to be prepared. My friend did end up sending her burger back to be cooked more. When it was returned the guy didn't even apologize for the inconvenience which I thought was weird. People like their meats prepared very differently and if you don't get it right it will completely sway the persons opinion of the dish. I personally think anything above medium makes a burger relatively tasteless and you might as well give me a leftover burger from the day before because it tastes about the same.  

While my experience was not that great, I was very happy when they gave us half off our meal for the inconvenience. I thought it was a very nice gesture after what had happened. While I'm not really in a rush to hurry back I would still like to try their eggs benedict for brunch one of these days."}
{"text":"Very Good. We had the scallops the side salad and the deserts are for only for those who take desert seriously, amazingly good and substantial.  Now for the not so good, the kitchen was ridiculously slow.  We went on a Sunday night before 8 with 10 people in the whole place and it took 20 minutes between course. It was an hour before our entree came out.  They apologized with a desert but then that took another 10 minutes for that. Also the octopus appetizer is just confused. The addition of
olives just overwhelms all the other flavors and ruins the dish.  Hopefully the kitchen gets its act together.  Also note it is $$$ - $$$$"}
{"text":"I went back here again for brunch with a group of around 10 people and again the food was fantastic, and the prices are more reasonable for many of the brunch items.  I had a bloody mary and the steak and eggs. The service started off a little slow but we had a large group and they brought out some complimentary monkey bread while we waited for our food. The bloody mary had a bit of scotch in it and was a nice smokey flavor.  I ordered my steak for my steak and eggs medium rare but unfortunately it came out well done, although my friend's steak came out perfectly medium rare as she also ordered it.  Another friend also ordered a steak rare and one piece of it came out rare, but the other pieces were medium well.  However, the staff were gracious and apologetic and fixed these issues very quickly, comped our checks and gave us gift certificates for next time, so I really appreciated that.  They explained that they are still getting to know their fire grill.  The chef and the manager both came out to speak to us a few times to make sure we were having a good experience."}
{"text":"Though still in its \"soft opening\" stage, this place has quite the possibility of being one of Pittsburgh's best!

Moby Dick themed, the allure is charming and nostalgic. 
I had went for brunch. Service was fantastic, shout out to Sam for making us feel so welcome! 
The food was definitely unusual but absolutely delicious. I had a cornbread waffle with all the fixings. (I would share a picture but I'm actually embarrassed I asked for everything on the side). 
My boyfriend ordered the All American and it was so filling. 
We both enjoyed our potent mimosas, and left super happy! 
Be sure to check this one out!!"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfasts I've ever had (and I am a breakfast snob). Big kudos to the chef.  I just ordered the Anerican Breakfast, wasnt expecting too much, but wow (amazing sausage and potatoes, bread and more). Good food, service, and atmosphere. Nice job Whale.. its a little bit tough to find on GPS (for an out of towner)... but worth the effort."}
{"text":"Just. Wow. I have been waiting for this place to open for what seems like years. Last night I FINALLY got to go to dinner!

**keep in mind that this is a seafood restaurant and can be pricy. I've seen some reviews on other media complaining about the price point. 

Parking: we parked at First Ave garage since the night rate is a flat $6 and it was less than 5 min to walk to the restaurant. 

Decor: absolutely stunning. The Moby Dick nautical theme was beautiful. The mural of the whale on the wall, strung up bulbs, ropes from ships on the ceiling and the pictures on the walls were so awesome. And the menus are old books that have been stamped with the restaurant logo! The menu sections are divided into chapter names. So clever and it appealed to me since I'm an avid reader and book lover. 

Food: oh. My. God delicious! We started with the grilled octopus ($18). It was expertly wood fire grilled with the perfect char. The pieces were generous and not overcooked. The chimichurri was the stuff dreams are made of.

Next we had the Guppy Tower ($80). This thing was massive and perfect to share with someone else. There were 12 raw oysters, 12 raw clams (which I've never had before), 6 GIANT prawns, some steamed mussels and pieces of snow crab. The house made hot sauce was really tasty. The clams tasted like briny saltwater and weren't my favorite but weren't awful. 

We got a side of the crab mac n cheese which was a real winner. Nice big chunks of crab, the cheese sauce wasn't overly cheesy or watery. You could taste every part of the dish.

Dessert was the ricotta lavender cake. I've never had lavender in food before and it was definitely perfumy and potent but not overpowering. The lemon ricotta on the side was amazing.

Overall I loved this place. I wouldn't get a tower again since it was so expensive (we only did because I had some gift cards haha). Can't wait to go back for brunch one day!"}
{"text":"I don't think I can say enough good things about Or, The Whale. I've been there for brunch multiple times and always get either the Eggs Benny or the Eggs Chesapeake which is a variation on the Eggs Benny, instead of using english muffins they use crab cakes. It's phenomenal. 

Last week, was my first time that I was there for dinner, we decided on Or, The Whale as our PGH Restaurant Week destination (wish we could have done more but the week got away from us), anyways we went on Thursday and both my boyfriend and I got the three course restaurant week menu, I did the risotto and he did the chicken, both were excellent. I would recommend Or, The Whale to anyone and everyone."}
{"text":"The worst service. It took 40 minutes to get Bloody Maries. Food was tasty, but service was horrific."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night with a colleague and there was no walk-in availability so we sat at the bar.  Wait staff got to us right away and we ordered the following: (App) Escargot, which was good, came out pipping hot and bread was a bit denser than expected but once dipped in the butter/herb sauce was great; (Entrees) Clam Bake for one and the Rutabaga Soup with a side of the crab mac & cheese.  We had a great time, atmosphere is beyond amazing.  Will return again.

Did not order dessert but we definitely should have.  If you want fresh seafood with unique and fun gastronomic pairings, make a reservation today."}
{"text":"Exceptional service and quality food. We tried the Muscles and the portion was huge,  the cod soup, well as the scallops. All excellent on taste and presentations. We will be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I just went here, and we have very mixed feelings about it. Both of us were really excited to try this place after reading so many positive articles and reviews. We were impressed when first walked in, immediately noticing the amazing mural on the back wall of the restaurant featuring Moby Dick (hence the name of the place). We checked our coats, gave them the name of our reservation, and the hostess sat us. Once seated we noticed that tables were quite long, causing people sitting across from each other to have to talk louder than normal, making the overall volume of the restaurant pretty loud, which was unexpected. We ordered some cocktails, both of which were good, but at $14 a piece, definitely weren't some of the best drinks that we have had in the city. We ordered two appetizers, the mussels and the octopus. The mussels were good, but we really wish we would have tried them before we ate the octopus, because it was by far the best octopus we have ever had. It was incredibly tender and covered in a delightfully salty chimichurri. The biggest downside was I was expecting more than one 4\" tentacle for the price. Again, the mussels were quite good, very large, and a good portion but taste wise couldn't hold up to the octopus. Then we waited for our entrees. And we waited. And we waited. Several times our waitress came up and apologized for the delay and that it shouldn't be much longer. Well, at the 1.5 hour mark we asked if she could find out how much longer it would be. Within a few min they brought them out. My wife ordered a short rib pasta and I ordered the scallops. Hers was a decent portion size, and had a great overall flavor although it was very salty. My scallops were great, but the portion size was minimal. It consisted of 3 fifty cent piece size scallops with maybe 6 home made potato chips. Once we got our check we let our waitress know that we in no way thought the delay was her fault, but if she could let her manager know that the wait was very disappointing. A moment later she came back to our table and said that the manger would be stopping by our table before she ran the check. Another 15 min passed before the manger was finally able to stop by. He was very nice and apologetic, and took a round of drinks off of bill. Neither him, nor our waitress, were able to tell us why our food took so long, just that they were sorry.

Overall most of the food was good, but beyond the octopus, I feel we could get better elsewhere and with it currently being one of the most expensive restaurants in Pittsburgh we just expected more. If I was just reviewing the food I probably would have given it 4 stars, good but not great. It definitely lost a star for the ridiculous amount of time it took to get our food."}
{"text":"The food was delicious (steak and frites) but the service was phenomenal!!! As soon as we walked into the restaurant we were welcomed with big smiles and seated quickly. The manager Harry went above and beyond to ensure that we had a great experience. Hands down the best restaurant I have been to in Pittsburgh. Harry keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"When looking for a place for brunch in the city we found Or, The Whale and thought it looked great. When we got there we loved the atmosphere of the restaurant and the service was great. However, when we got our food my entire dish was cold and my eggs were not cooked at all, while my fiancées food was hot. When I told our waiter he quickly took my plate and got it replaced in a timely manner. Overall the taste of the food was decent, but the kitchen needs to work on timing so all the plates at one table are all warm."}
{"text":"The night started off great when we sat at the bar. However it slowly went downhill after this point. When we were seated downstairs we did not have anyone wait on us for at least 30 minutes. Then we still did not have a waiter the sommelier served us (Eric was great he took over our table completely) 

My friend and I ordered the crab mac n cheese and it had no flavor. We also split the duck duck goose burger which was very dry and extremely tiny for the price. The bread fell apart so you had to eat with a fork and knife. 

I had very high expectations but am very disappointed the only good part of our night was the bartender and Eric"}
{"text":"Opened a few weeks ago and seems like they're still working out the kinks. Haven't gotten the chance to dine here yet, but stopped in for a few drinks the other day. Cocktails were top notch!"}
{"text":"Wood fire grilled locally sourced food cooked to perfection. What else could you want? Killer wine list and cocktails add depth to the dining experience. Great ambiance and decor make the whole package a five star experience."}
{"text":"Great experience! Jeremy the manager and Cheryl the server made our ordinary night one to remember! The food was skillfully prepared and Jeremy was wonderful about making recommendations for a wine pairing that was in line with our budget. We found the staff to be down to earth and very accommodating."}
{"text":"The ambiance is great. Very thought out and makes you feel like you've almost been teleported into a little new England bayside restaurant. I have to admit that I'm drawn to the farm to table concept. The people who work here are very friendly and efficient. The dishes incorporate as much of the New England feel as you can while being in Pittsburgh. I absolutely enjoyed my side salad. The dressing was bright, acidic and citrusy. I ordered the Eggs Chesapeake and while the idea is great, the poached eggs were a little over and the crab didn't feel fresh (understandable for being in Pittsburgh). The hollandaise was think and very citrusy with a bit of a kick. I enjoyed it but the lemon was pretty strong. I also had the mussels for an appetizer. Again, the sauce was great but the mussels themselves just didn't feel fresh. Overall, great little place and I'll probably be back!"}
{"text":"I was excited to check this place out but it didnt live up to expectations. We asked the server for recommendations and she recited the whole menu. Then we asked again to help us choose between too and she was not helpful. Portions are too small (we were 2 small women and we were hungry after the entree). There are definitely much better places for this price range in Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast today and it was amazing. The decor is beautiful, the service was impeccable, and the food is amazing. 

We sat near the bar, but overlooking the bottom of the restaurant. Perfect view to see everything that's going on (and the kitchen!).

The menu isn't super long, but all the options looked amazing. We got the monkey bread as an appetizer. Amazing. Perfectly sweet, and a good portion to split between two people. Also, only $6! I got the American Breakfast ($14, 2 eggs scrambled, fingerling potatoes, sausage, bacon, and grilled bread), and my friend got the Eggs Chesapeake ($18, eggs benedict with a crab cake and green salad on the side). Both of us thoroughly enjoyed out meals. Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day, and I can honestly say, this is the best breakfast I've had at a restaurant in Pittsburgh. Everything tastes fresh, and I didn't leave feeling heavy or hungry. The scrambled eggs were creamy yet cooked through. The sausage was so great and made in house; I'm usually not the biggest fan of sausage but I ate almost all of it! The grilled bread is such a great touch to the meal. And the potatoes were perfectly cooked and seasoned. It was truly a great meal.

The staff honestly made it better. Everyone was attentive to my friend and I, checking on us, making sure we had everything we needed. This was such a great experience - I can't wait to come back for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrendous! We were in town for my daughters graduation and had a 8pm reservation. After waiting 40 mins we left after being repeatedly told -just a few more minutes.......We watched them set up a table for four and it took them literally 15 mins to set up to find out that it was not for us! We had asked to speak to a manager and there was no one in sight! We enjoyed a fabulous dinner at Meat and Potatoes instead. Just a 10 min walk from this terrible place and guess what we only had to wait 5 mins for our table! And this place is packed!!!"}
{"text":"I've had the Jubilee short rib (incredible), Heritage pork chop (ridiculously good) and the otherwise indescribable Duck Duck Goose Burger. This is all high-end, high-skill chef stuff and I don't think my man Chef Brooks can do any wrong. Enjoy this gem of a restaurant while you can. Next on the list is the 100+ day dry aged ribeye (seriously? Butchered and Dry-aged in-house no less!!). I've had other sampling's from the menu too, and the next time I'm disappointed will be the first. 

Everyone needs to try the duck duck goose burger one time. Seared foie gras on top of duck confit on a ground duck patty. My question for Chef Brooks after my meal was \"are you f***ing kidding me with that!?\"

All the stars for Or the Whale. It's awesome."}
{"text":"My husband and i visited for brunch. The atmosphere was cute, hip, and seemed to be intimate. We made reservations through open table, which you had to give a credit card and if you cancel within a certain amount of time are subject to a $40 charge.. kind of ridiculous. Nevertheless, we made it and the monkey bread was definitely the best! Highly recommend! I got the American Breakfast, which was a ton of food but everything was great. You can see the kitchen if you sit on the lower level, and the atmosphere is nautical and laid back. I ordered a Diet Coke which came in a cute little bottle... for $4.00. I probably would just get water next time. Be prepared to pay for street parking or garage parking."}
{"text":"This restaurant was phenomenal! It was my first visit; a birthday dinner for my BF. The availability of times and ease of use to book the reservation online was great. I knew it was farm to table by reading some reviews prior to our visit. We selected several appetizers: the featured appetizer was a mozzarella ball over mushrooms, apple slices with focaccia bread; escargot; grilled octopus and grilled quail. All were delicious and filling. We selected a
Caesar salad to share (plenty big for 2 people I might add) as well as the Lobster/Crab Rollatini-so delicious! The noodles are made in house and they make most items from scratch. The wine selections were great as was our desserts-pound cake with beet ice cream (refreshing and light); a chocolate cake with stout caramel and glazed bananas and a small piece of cheesecake to go! Our waitress was attentive, friendly, informative and honest when we asked her opinion on the food. She even gave us a brief history of the building, which was nice. The ambience is eclectic and comfortable. Parking was okay; we parked a few blocks away since the Valet wasn't at the station when we pulled up. No biggie as it was a nice night to walk a few blocks. We'd definitely go back to this restaurant. Check it out if you haven't been."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for this place to open for months, but I was very let down by my first experience. I know that they are in their soft opening phase, which is why I won't harp on the poor service, but food on the other hand was a let down.

My group had dinner at 7:30, but two of the dishes we attempted to order, they were out of for the evening. We started with the mussels, but unfortunately they lacked flavor and did not come with nearly enough sauce.Next I had the pickled shrimp bisque, which ended up being the highlight of my meal. This soup was full of flavor and had a nice spicy kick to it. For my main course I had the En Papillote, which was a flounder. The fish was cooked to perfection, but again lacked flavor - even salt would have bumped this dish up a notch in my book. Lastly, we finished with the creme brulee - which is well worth it.

I will not be headed back in the near future, but I am hopeful that this restaurant turns it around because I feel that the potential is there."}
{"text":"I know that people often have phrases that are extremely meaningful to them, but do we really need to name a restaurant after an obscure subtitle from Moby Dick?  Is that where we're at now?  I get it, the owners wanted to evoke thoughts of the sea even before customers arrive at their restaurant.  Yeah, righto!  Please stop with the esoteric names and menu notations when your excellent décor, food and service is enough to warrant a visit to your restaurant.  I do mean EXCELLENT service!  Our waiter was fabulous and couldn't have provided better service if he fed us our meals table side.

The menu is short and sweet, maybe a little too short, but they do almost everything extremely well. (I say almost everything because I tried to order the Best Chicken Sandwich You'll Have Today and they were out of various components needed to make the sandwich.  What?)  Since I couldn't order the chicken sandwich, I ordered the Eggs Chesapeake with 2 crab cakes, poached eggs, old bay hollandaise, housemade English muffins and farm greens($18). Yummy!  One of my lunch partners ordered the same as me along with a side of bacon($8) and my other lunch partner ordered the Steak + Eggs with two fried eggs, wood fired bavette, hearth roasted vegetables and fingerlings, chile hollandaise and chimichurri sauce.($25)

Now let me just say that those prices are just a little steep for lunch in Dahntahn Pittsburgh, but as far as restaurants associated with and placed in hotels, the prices were about par.  Additionally, that side of bacon was in a whole nother class by itself.  Damn, that bacon was good!

In spite of the lack of ingredients for the chicken sandwich, Or, the Whale is a nice spot to try for the food, ambiance and service."}
{"text":"Not my favorite brunch in Pittsburgh. The savory waffle came with potatoes and bacon piled on top of the cornmeal waffle drenched in sauce. So much sauce it made the farm fresh bacon sloppy and chewy the entire dish inedible. Also the shakshuka was bland and served with extremely crunchy burned triangles of pitas. The dish should have been served with actual soft pita bread on the side so you could use it to eat the food! The 6 meals my friends and I had were sub par and we were very disappointed in what we had. The best part of the meal was the MONKEY BREAD! That was the bomb!"}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday dinner and left with a good first impression. I was nervous because the commoner is overpriced for the quality/taste of the food, but Or, the whale was fantastic. The cocktail I ordered , La Bouttanierre?, was deeeee-licious. It was vodka and lemon based, but not too sweet. My friend ordered some version of an old fashioned with whiskey and rum, which was also a great choice. We had the octopus appetizer and I'm beginning to forget that my awful octopus experience (rubbery and flavorless) at Tako ever happened. I would absolutely recommend the octopus appetizer, but there were so many other options that I have to go back to try. My main course was the short rib. It had great flavor and I loved the little sour cherry things that came with it. It just had a little too much sear on the outside, but the inside was tender and moist. We also warily shared a side of crab Mac n cheese despite a bad Mac dish at the commoner, but it was great! The crab chunks were generous, the crab and cheese flavor were excellent. The best part was a chocolate hazelnut slice of birthday cake at the end of the dinner.  it was an added bonus to the already attentive and hospitable service. We will definitely return. Four stars is because of the prices. I get it, but oy.... It's Pittsburgh. Let's keep it livable"}
{"text":"Was seated at a table for lunch with a very light lunch crowd. The hostess brings a couple other diners and asked me to move my jacket off of the chair because she just HAD to seat them right beside us even though they were plenty of tables around that were open. Ordered the Chicken Chop Salad, assuming the nice greens would chopped into bite sized pieces...the greens were hardly chopped at all, leaving me with a butter knife to cut the greens."}
{"text":"Had a blast with this real cutey. Amazing service from Cindy \"Einstein,\" the waitress. Excellent service and fun and engaging conversations with her to make up for my dud of a date. Would definitely come back; hopefully complete with my arm candy to compliment the amazing cocktails!!"}
{"text":"Went there for brunch. They were very understaffed with only one waitress for the entire top floor and one hostess. No bus people so the hostess was clearing and setting tables. Even though we had a reservation and there were a number of open tables it took 15 mins to get seated. Then 15 more minutes before someone took our order. Then 25 minutes for brunch food to come. Evidently the kitchen was very understaffed. The worst part (beyond waiting an hour from your reservation till your food came) was that the food was cold and not very good. Ordered Eggs Benny. The two poached eggs were literally cold and also overcooked. Hard to explain and never had that before. I guess the pre-poached the eggs and left them in tepid water for a while. Not what I would expect from a chef driven restaurant, at all. Even the bacon and sauce was lukewarm at best, so nothing was actually being made fresh or kept hot. My wife's eggs were similarly overcooked. We both agreed that we would not be back. We also heard from the staff that they are understaffed for dinner but didn't see that ourselves."}
{"text":"Brunch at Or, The Whale left me speechless. Such amazing service from waitstaff who clearly loved their clients and the meals they were serving. The coffee is absolutely spectacular and the main dishes were all fresh tastes and absolutely perfect. I'm not much of a food raver but this place was wonderful. Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"We made a reservation for brunch and I'm happy we did so we did not have to wait at all. The interior is very clean and bright, but subtle. We were seated upstairs, near the bar. 
First, I had the Tall Soarr Mimosa, it was very delish but, pretty strong. I then switched to a normal mimi! The coffee was super hot and smooth. 
We wanted to order the monkey bread for an appetizer and he said they were all out :( so sad! I was so excited... I had the grilled cheese and tomato soup, it was soooo amazing! Buttery and crispy and the soup was non acidic and hot! My husband had the fish and chips, the fries were so crispy and well flavored, ah mazzzing again! Boom! 
Our friends had the savory waffle and wedge salad, they were very satisfied. 
I would love to come back again!"}
{"text":"Had an excellent birthday meal at Or, the Whale. We came on a Wednesday evening. There is valet parking for $8, which was nice. The restaurant has a very nautical theme. It was interesting that you had to walk down to the restaurant. 

Their menu is all locally sourced and aims to be farm to table. Somethings were not on the menu due to them not being in season anymore. We started off with their homemade biscuits and butter. The biscuit was delicious and I could taste the fresh chives. 

Our food came very quickly. I had the scallops. My friend had the mussels and we split the crab mac and cheese. There were 3 scallops, but each were huge! The squash puree and grilled green onions went perfectly with the scallops. My friend was shocked as her mussels was an appetizer, but the portion size was enormous. There were easily 50 mussels. I had a few and they were very fresh. The crab mac and cheese was also delicious, creamy, and rich in gruyere. 

For dessert, we shared the chocolate pot de creme. The chocolate creme was very dense. The granola was an interesting addition. Overall, we had an excellent meal. The prices were moderate to high, but the food was worth it. A much needed quality seafood restaurant in Pittsburgh. Looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"I was visiting Pittsburgh for the first time and had really high hopes for this place! First, we had a reservation and checked in with the hostess- then she walked us down to our table. She gives us a nice welcome speech about where the bathroom is and the weather. We get to the table and she realizes it is not ready and we have to turn around and go back up the stairs and wait- which is fine, but weird and slightly disorganized. We are waiting for 10 minutes when we see another couple get seated at the table that was being prepared for us. The hostess comes back and asks what my name is because she forgot and didn't think to check her list. We walk to our table and get the same welcome speech we received 15 minutes ago as if it never happened. We ordered the escargot that was fine and the guppy tower to split. There were no utensils given to us for seafood (the mini forks and mini spoons) so we poured the sauce and vinegar onto our oysters. It was impossible to get the meat out of the clams- the clams that even had meat! Some basically were just full of salt water. We ordered the banana cake for dessert and two espressos. We got our cake, which was ok...but did not get our espressos (which showed up as Americanos in tea cups) until 10 minutes after we got our cake. For a $180 meal between two people...I expected much better!"}
{"text":"This place exceeded my expectations in every way. The service is great. I wine list is unique. They put such a neat twist on all their food. The shrimp and crab cocktail is my favorite appetizer. They serve it with a charred tomato cocktail sauce that is one of the best sauces I have ever tasted. They also serve it with their fries. You can't go wrong with anything you order here. Everything is excellent."}
{"text":"Beautiful space, lovely service, great menu. What more could you ask for? We met friends for brunch and had a great table without having a reservation. Our server was very attentive and kept our coffees & waters full. The food selection was excellent, something for everyone really. I had a bloody mary, which was tasty and not over-garnished!"}
{"text":"Food was good but over priced-this is Pittsburgh not NYC. The sommelier was impressive and made a great recommendation. Our appetizers were great but our entrees were unimpressive. My husband had monkfish which was completely overpowered by parsnips (and he is a fan of parsnips). I had the cockles and pasta which I was not a fan of. It lacked acidity. We also ordered cocktails and were served an overload of sugar. I only gave this place three stars because the sommelier was top notch."}
{"text":"Too oyster/shellfish heavy for me.  Expected more fish variety.  Also a bit pricey for such small portions.  Cool looking place and staff was very friendly though"}
{"text":"We made brunch reservations here for a Sunday afternoon at 1pm.  We took the parkway getting here and got off at the Grant street exit and it's right there on the corner.  I drove around and found a parking garage right next to the hotel that this restaurant is in for $6.  You go to the front of the hotel and walk in.  Once you walk in their hostess for the restaurant is to your right.  We were greeted and took a walk downstairs to our table.

     We got our seats in the middle of the floor which wasn't too bad.  The area is a little different.  You almost feel like your in the middle of a big hotel lobby but it wasn't bad.  

     We had already looked through their brunch menu but I still wasn't sure what I wanted still.  I was really hungry and we were going to go for drinks after so I wanted to make sure I was full.  I looked through pictures on Yelp and finally decided on the Savory Waffle.  The waitress describe it to me and with my wife's encouragement I went with it.

     We both ordered waters and my wife got a coffee which was just ok.  Carrie got the eggs benny and it looked good.  The problem was that the eggs were underdone.  They looked ok at first but once she ate it she could tell they were a little under.  We should have had them redo the eggs when we noticed but we didn't. So that was disappointing but my savory waffles were awesome!  I was thinking it might be sweet but I didn't want something sweet.  I just wanted a lot of food.  It wasn't sweet because the waffle was made out of cornmeal and there was just a light maple sauce.  The waffle, sausage, eggs, bacon all came together so beautifully.  I loved it and it hit the spot.  

     So overall a decent brunch but it would have been really good if my wife's eggs were cooked better.  Also the service was really good I thought too.  Our waitress did a good job taking care of us."}
{"text":"Very good!! Delicious crab Mac n cheese, and creme brûlée . Valet is nice and the waitress is very informative."}
{"text":"In from Baltimore to catch a Steelers game and staying at the hotel this restaurant is attached to. First off- apparently you need a reservation for brunch. Even though half the restaurant is empty. We sat at the bar where they serve the full menu. Great service but food is just meh. I can't put my finger on it but there is a spice in the food that is making my stomach churn."}
{"text":"Food and ambience and the waiters and waitresses bartenders play everything was fabulous can't wait to come back love everything complete big D Dale Ron Stewart and George Trent what's your last name Michelle Johnston were fabulous people waiting on us throughout the night can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"Two stars equals \"meh, I've had better.\"  That is how I would characterize my experience at this restaurant.   

Most positive reviews on Yelp so far focus on brunch. I cannot speak for that, and the pictures do look good, and the price seems reasonable. Maybe worth checking that out. But I had dinner and was not impressed.  Also, I agree with everyone that the space is beautiful. I think there's a lot of potential for this if they can work on a few things.

What I would encourage them to focus on:

One: wait staff training. Our waitress clearly did not know the menu well enough. For a seafood restaurant, when I asked her what the Oyster selection was, she said \"they're from Virginia\".  Could not say anything else about them when I asked. Had the same problem describing some of the other menu items.

Two: plating. I thought the big wooden salad bowls were a terrible idea. It looks silly on the table and given what's inside them it's overkill. I also had some kind of seafood stew in a giant metal pot that was difficult to eat out of and again, completely unnecessary.

Three: menu items. Again, I think at this price point some of the food was less than outstanding and lacked flavor. Everyone at my table had the same response. Again, this is something that can get refined if they're willing to work on the menu some more. But there are too many good seafood options and steak options in town for them to be anything less than stellar at that price point.

I'm rooting for them to sort these issues out and make this one of the great restaurant to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Awesome experience! Just missed Sunday brunch so we sat upstairs with our 2 year old daughter. The bar staff were extremely friendly !!! Great fish and chips !!!!! We will be back !!!"}
{"text":"I read some reviews, and I was a little hesitant to come here. Well - I am I glad that we did! First, we made reservations and were seated as soon as we arrived. Our waitress was pleasant, but it was difficult to hear her over the music and bustle of the kitchen. I ordered the wedge salad and scallops and my husband hand the cod chowder and New York strip with garlic smashed potatoes.  We received the bread at our table. It was biscuits with butter (both of which were flavored but I don't recall with what).  They were mostly unremarkable, but fine.  The presentation of the starters was a bit over the top. The chowder was presented with the cod and potatoes on a dish and the servers poured the \"broth\" over these items at the table. Also, the wedge salad arrived in an oversized dish. I understand the \"feel\" that they are going for here, and appreciate it, however I think it could be achieved with a smaller salad bowl and a different approach to the soup.  Both were delicious, although there was a little too much dressing on the salad.  The presentation of the main course was spot on. The steak was perfect and so were the scallops. I will say that I was unsure what I would get based on other reviews, but they must have taken other reviews seriously and improved the quality. The steak was cooked just as requested and taste amazing. I'm not a fan of butternut squash, but the purée with the scallops was delicious. We did wait a little longer than expected between courses but the sommelier filled this time with her recommendations and anecdotes. Although our waitress was MIA, the sommelier more than made up for it. Also, the support wait staff was great. We also order a dessert that was the special. It was fine, but mostly unremarkable. The pleasant surprise was in the size of the coffee that was provided with dessert. Overall, the food was fantastic, but the presentation and staff could be better. I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Wow, This place is just Awesome!  Where to begin?  Service was top-notch.  Even though we visited the restaurant with no specific purpose, our server Ryan went above and beyond to take care of us.  His recommendations... just perfect!  The whole fish we had was charred in open flames and was cooked to perfection.  

We came here with our little one too and they have an amazing presentation for kid meals.  

They do have a nice wine list, but you would want to have some crafted drinks!  The main bartender made two of her custom-crafted drinks.   Reason why I don't have any pics is because they're that delicious.  

Lastly, for an even truly unique experience ask for Harry.  He heads operations in the restaurant and the way he treated us, making sure that everything was perfect, was worthy of recognition.  

We already made our next reservations.  We'll take more pics next time"}
{"text":"You don't have read Moby Dick to enjoy this book themed restaurant...though you will appreciate the chapter menu! While a little pricey, the food is well executed and well worth the price of admission. Skim the Loomings and Chowder chapters to select an appetizer; their rich and flavorful cod chowder stood out thanks to the potatoes, bacon and leeks. If you're going with the theme, definitely make a selection from the Nantucket chapter. Here, we've enjoyed the linguini & cockles and the woodfired monkfish. Subsequent chapters include seafood towers for sharing and other proteins like steaks 'n chops. Some time I'd like to splurge and share the whopping 45-oz. Porterhouse! There's nothing like quality meat cooked on an open, woodfired grill. But, the heritage pork chop was a solid offering. One of my favorite sides is the grilled broccoli. Its oh-so-simple in preparation yet it explodes with flavor -- don't forget to use the seared lemon! Lastly, it's a very unique and inviting space. And service was impeccable. So just go...it's perfect for your next special occasion. Or better yet, check it out during Pittsburgh Restaurant Week."}
{"text":"I've come to or, the whale twice, and both instances were for brunch so this 5 star review only reflects the amazing breakfast foods I've eaten there. But both times, I left feeling like I was looking forward to the next time I get to go back. 

The hotel building that the restaurant is in is very unassuming. You'd never guess such a beautiful lobby and restaurant are hidden inside. But as soon as you walk through the doors of or, the whale, the atmosphere immediately surrounds you from the lights, to the open kitchen, to the giant mural, to the tables and chairs ... the attention to detail and style is so enjoyable. Every staff member we interacted with was helpful and kind. 

If I can recommend anything, it's the monkey bread. We split it as an appetizer to our brunch and it was the best part of my day. So delicious! We also tried the eggs Benedict, the eggs Chesapeake, the chicken salad on a croissant, and the savory bubble waffle. It was all very good. The homemade English muffins for the egg dishes made the meal so tasty! 

What a great addition for brunch to the city!"}
{"text":"This place was solidly-ok. My boyfriend and I came here for our holiday dinner we do every year and felt it was a solid B. The service though was A+ so that should definitely be given credit. We started with the escargot and that was good, well cooked, not rubbery. Then we ordered the ribeye steak, crab Mac and cheese, salad, and beets to split as our main. The dry aged steak was excellent but the beets had probably a quarter cup of pesto for 8 little beet pieces so it was over powering and all you could taste in the crab Mac and cheese was old bay. The salad was well done and had a nice peppery flavor but nothing to write home about. Also don't charge $2 for chimichurri if someone is ordering a $70+steak. All in all this was one of the most expensive restaurants we've been to in Pittsburgh (more so than appetizer, wine, and dinner for two at ace hotel, acorn, cure, morcilla, etc. ) and the food didn't live up to the price. It's a solid ok but not great. Which is a bummer because I LOVE merchant oyster co. So I think I will just spend my money there."}
{"text":"Went on a Sat eve at 6. Greeted nicely and sat immediately with our reservation that I made that day for 2. 
Atmosphere is awesome and noise level is pleasant where we sat. 
Service was very good. We had Mixed drinks that were basic and not on the menu. 
We ordered the mussel appetizer and it was well worth it. We enjoyed the staring biscuits too. 
We had the pork chop and the trout for our main course, cauliflower and the crab Mac and cheese. All were awesome but I do think there could be a bite or two more of crab in there. We concluded with a shared chocolatey coffee dessert. 
All on point and served beautifully. 
Services was well attentioned and not annoying. I would recommend everything we ate. 
We spent $150 on 2 drinks, 1 appetizer, two main dishes, 2 sides and 1 dessert. 
Go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"First impression: really fancy and high class atmosphere. The staff/waiters must go through some serious etiquette and small talk training before rolling them out to work. The waiter my girlfriend and I had was a bit chatty but he meant well. We were given bread to eat before our meal to keep us occupied while we waited for food. I ordered the roasted half chicken which came with a ravioli. I only ordered this dish because it was one of the cheaper dishes. This isn't a place I would frequent due to the prices set in the menu. It was a very delicious piece of half chicken with charred vegetables. It was flavorful but took quite a long time to get the dish out. I understand getting a fresh dish to the customer but I feel like they could improve getting the half chicken to the table a bit faster. The guy at the table beside me seemed to be waiting quite a while as well. I probably won't be back for dinner unless I want to celebrate winning the lottery. I might come back to try out the brunch if I'm somehow convinced."}
