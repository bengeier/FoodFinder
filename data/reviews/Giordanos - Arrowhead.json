{"text":"Absolutely terrible service. Our server was the most clueless guy. He told us that he didn't recommend the lasagna and the extra thin crust pizza. So I ordered anyways.  Pizza was ok.  The lasagna tasted like the forest floor. This place is terrible."}
{"text":"What a great place. Excellent servic.  Ask for Shaun he was great. Calamari and the chicken sausage deep dish were amazing. Rarely does my family agree on a pizza place but they are unanimous on this one. Should have tried it sooner."}
{"text":"We went the first couple weeks they were open. Pizza was lukewarm and cheese wasn't as gooey as I was hoping. Service was okay but nothing impressive."}
{"text":"Had this when I was in Chicago and was so unbelievably excited when I saw they had one in Arizona  (I just moved from Portland.) Best pizza."}
{"text":"My family and I had dinner/pizza(3 of them) last night and the experience was much better than our first attempt. The pizza was amazing although lacking in meat. I would definitely recommend them to pizza lover but, suggest you be patient as this new location work out the bugs."}
{"text":"The best pizza I've had!  Went there on a Monday night at 5pm and the parking lot was already full so parked behind PF Chang's.  The restaurant was busy but we were seated immediately and drinks arrived.  Our orders were deep dish pizza, thin crust pizza and chopped salad. I would give 5 stars for quality of food (wonderful cheese!) but the wait time was unacceptable (over 1.5 hours). The servers were attentive but the kitchen must be improved!     BTW, if you haven't tried the chopped salad - it's amazing!   We had ordered previously for delivery and, although the prep time was nearly 2 hours, the pizza was delivered hot to Sun City by a very nice man.  Gotta be patient but it was worth it."}
{"text":"the restaurant is new and with a name like giordano's, they're going to be busy... give it a shot. they're still figuring things out. Pick up was great and the food was fresh out of the oven. Well worth the wait! So excited for them to really grow into their new found fame in the west valley! I'll be very excited to sit down for a meal inside sometime soon!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time food is poor quality. Got a order of the number 1 bruschetta it was not eatable at all,low  quality dog food. The customer service both phone and at the restaurant are rude and lazy. Never going Back ever."}
{"text":"First of all I am from Chicago and Giordano's is my favorite pizza in Chicago!  Let me tell you that I was very excited when Giordano's opened up in AZ and was really looking forward to having a great pizza!  Unfortunately my experience was far from perfect. We arrive around 2 pm on Saturday and was immediately seated!  Okay so far so good...but that's about as good as it got. We had two people in our party and every table for two are placed in this narrow hallway where people are going back and forth to the bathroom and servers are going back and forth to the drop off dirty dishes. If you have two people in your party it's better to eat at the bar or bring more people in your party. Our server was welcoming and explained that there would be a 45 min wait for deep dish, which I expected. We ordered a house salad and large Special. The house salad with lemon vinegarette dressing was nothing to write home about, very tasteless!  Now for the pizza; when came out it looked and smelled great!  I let the server do the first cheese pull and we dove in. First bite good but no burst of sausage; second bite still no sausage: third bite no sausage...this continues on until I reached the crust where EUREKA a tiny bit of sausage is found!  My wife's piece is the same way!  So I think, okay maybe it's all on another piece; but again only a tiny morsel of sausage was found. This is NOT how a good Giordano's pizza is made. Needless to say that Giordano's is NOT my favorite pizza in AZ; Lou Malnati's beats them hands down!"}
{"text":"Eat pizza at Giordano's if you want to pay up front and then wait for hours only to never see your order. Fraud? Robbery? False advertising? You decide. What a disaster. #thisisnotchicagopizza"}
{"text":"Whatever you do.....DO NOT....I REPEAT.....DO NOT ever go to Giordano's. Worst experience we have EVER had in a restaurant. We got there at 5:20 and walked out at almost 8pm with empty stomachs, and mind you we had a 6 and a 3 year old with us. The manager was not apologetic whatsoever and failed to fulfill any of her promises. Mind you I picked this restaurant to eat out at for my 32nd and my sons 3rd birthday with my husband, mother in law, and sister in law. Here's the story:   We walked in, sat down, ordered drinks and appetizers. All that went fine. Then we ordered a large thin crust pizza to share. Almost an hour later, our server comes to the table and tells us that the pizza oven has broken, destroying our pizza in the process. We have to order other individual meals, which we are told will come out \"Lightning\" fast. So we order. Then another man comes to our table with a pizza. But not our pizza. Turns out our server put in the wrong pizza to begin with. We actually might have gotten the pizza we ordered had the order been correct.  So anyway, our new meals are going to come lightning quick right? Wrong. We wait another 45 minutes, rarely if ever seeing a server or manager as the restaurant is emptying out and servers are being sent home. So finally we flag down our server and ask what's up. He goes and checks on our meals. He comes back and tells us that the orders aren't on the screen. He or the manager never got the meals in!  So, over two and a half hours after walking in, we walked out. We had simply had enough.   Our family separated to their individual homes and most ended up eating in their living rooms having a McDonald's picnic, but not before our children had both cried their eyes out from being over hungry and tired. Why? Because we were leaving Giordano's after their bedtime and they still hadn't eaten, showered, or watched 15 minutes of their movie before bed. Maybe that's why we were having a early dinner out?!  And what did we get for all of this? A few gift cards from a large stack the manager was carrying around and passing out and our meals comped (mind you we never got those meals). Oh and Yeah, like we're going back to use those gift cards! Thanks for ruining my 3 year olds and MY birthday dinner!   #Giordanos #GiordanosEpicFail #HorribleRestaurantExpierence #WorstManagerEver #McDonaldsTheRealMVP."}
{"text":"Chicago born and raised, and Giordanos was the pizza standard. This pizza is just as good as I remember and it's been a few years since I've had it! Hands down best pizza ever if you love deep dish, lots of cheese, and flaky pastry crust! My party of 5 arrived at 5pm and was seated immediately. It's typical to wait about an hour for the pizza because it's deep dish. Service was great and the manager introduced herself to us. She was very friendly and clearly so passionate about pizza! Will definitely keep coming back for my favorite pizza now in AZ!!"}
{"text":"Hi I'm from the Chicago area about 40 miles from the city and l lived there my entire life until recently relocating to Arizona. When I was home there were lots of really good pizza places around but Giordanos was always our 1st. choice and when we found out there was one coming here we were ecstatic, first off I really don't think the people here know what good pizza is, my wife and I went to the Giordano here on the first day they opened, it took a while but when we got our pizza it taste just like the pizza we got at home and it was well worth the wait,  I understand the parking lot is small and not sufficient enough but you have to keep in mind it's location and if you are really a true Giordano pizza lover and you know anything about pizza as all Chicagoans do you won't let small things like parking and wait time keep you from experiencing good pizza.  Another word of advice( order takeout and just walk in, pick it up, go home, enjoy.) that's what we do sometimes when we don't want to dine in."}
{"text":"Horrible. How do you claim to be a premier pizza joint, and you don't have pizza?!?!?! Seriously, you don't have pizza?!?! Wtf. Your oven is broken... how the hell does that happen on a Thursday night during the dinner rush? I am so beyond disappointed. I will never waste another attempt at wasting my time with this place. What a poorly managed joke."}
{"text":"Ordered a small deep-dish,classic w/pepperoni delivered. Driver arrived within 5 min of time given by store associate. Shared w/ a friend who lived in Chicago for 10 yrs. I thought it was excellent, and my friend said it was \"real close\" to Chicago pizza. Will order again."}
{"text":"Went to Giordiano's yesterday!!  What a great experience!!  First of all we were seated by the girl at the desk, then we were greeted by Markus our waiter...He couldn't have been friendlier and constantly smiling.  Very attentive always checking if we needed something. He too explained the pizza would take about 30 minutes, but it was worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I are from Rockford Ill and this place brought us back home. We drove an hour and it was well worth it. Spot on fantastic Chicago style pizza. We got the regular thin crust and brought a small stuffed  home. Loved both.. excellent service. We will be back......"}
{"text":"Service was great and the pizza was good. Also, there's usually is a long wait but you can pre-order with the hostess while waiting so you don't have to wait the additional 45 min to get your pizza after your seated."}
{"text":"Great service! The pizza is tasty and very filling. We ordered the appetizer sampler and was not very filling for the price. Too expensive for very little food. For dessert, we ordered the tiramisu and the cannolis. The tiramisu had a very strong espresso taste and somewhat bland. The cannolis lacked flavor and not pleasant to eat. Other than the dessert, which could be an easy fix; the service was great."}
{"text":"The pizza was as good as my Chicago friends advertised. Super cheesy and the crust was on point. Service was good too. It was clean and the atmosphere was friendly and inviting. I will be eating there again."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Chicago style pizza, so I was excited to see Giordano's open its first location in AZ.  After one visit, I would have to say they should have taken a week or two to train the staff.  Our food was OK, but I think that our waitperson got just about every item in our order wrong.  I had to chase him down to the kitchen one time to correct him about my wife's beer order (he thought that all Goose Island beer was \"312\" - learn the menu, young man!). The worst thing he did was take my empty water glass without offering to refill it or bring me another.  Two separate times different wait staff brought entrees to our table that we had not ordered, and then walked away looking really confused when we told them it wasn't our food."}
{"text":"We placed a $100 carry out order online to be picked up at 5:15 p.m.  We never got a confirmation email so we called directly at 4:30 and they stated they found our order and it would be ready at 5:15.  I arrive at 5:05 and was told that they could not find my order.  Upon looking more, they found it and told me that it wasn't supposed to be ready until 5:15.  I acknowledged that I was early and would be happy to wait.  Nothing was said to me about status of my order until 5:45 when I was told my pizza was ready.  I expressed my frustration at waiting without any word on status.  I told them that all they had to do was to tell me that they messed up and it would be awhile instead of letting me sit there.  The person then told me he would get his manager.  It took 5 minutes for the manager to arrive who apologized but blamed it on the online order system.  I don't believe this was my problem.  I again voiced my frustration and he just said he was sorry.  I was surprised that there was no offer of compensation for their mix up.  Poor management of a great restaurant - will think twice before spending that kind of money there again."}
{"text":"We love Giordano's pizza!  However we've gone 0-2 the last couple times being here.  We were sat and told 35 mns on the pizza, it's been and hour and a half and we had to ask what's the status?  We had a hockey game to make it to and we're now going to miss the first period waiting for a pizza.  Someone needs to get this one at the same level as the ones in Chicago!"}
{"text":"Good Chicken Wings.  Pizza was blah - my wife and I can't decide if this was frozen pizza heated up and or not.  It was served on a piece of cardboard.  Why?  We ordered the classic with sausage, mushrooms, onions, green peppers.   Waited 40 mins for a luke warm pizza - how?  That sucker should have been piping hot.  Tons of veggies- had to hunt for the sausage.    Super let down.  Don't know why they are famous in Chicago but I predict their AZ presence will be short lived.    Took a long time to get server to acknowledge is - it was a nice server from another section who stepped up cause she saw us waiting & got us drinks & took our order.  Then, when our extremely \"awkward\" server returned from his break he had words with this other server and then came and explained to us that \"he is our server\" & \"she was confused\". What a lame ass.  Super awkward for the paying customer.    Anyhow - too many better options out there to waste your time at Giordanos."}
{"text":"Always very pleased with the quality of the food, pizza is always made right and served hot! Service is fast and proficient always had my glass full. Definitely will continue to come here in the future!"}
{"text":"Did not disappoint!  Great service and \"as promised great pizza.\"  Have never lived in Chicago, and not to take anything away from local places, but it was wonderful.  Parking sucks.  But, worth the hassle!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this place could not live up to the hype created. The cheese bread was fine but nothing to write home about. You should not go here when you are very hungry because the pizza takes about 45 min to an hour to prepare. Sadly, there was a mistake in the kitchen with our pizza and we waited for 1 1/2 hour for our pizza to be prepared properly. This would have been forgivable if the pizza lived up to my expectations. It did not. It was not even edible. The only saving grace at this place was the staff. Everyone was pleasant and that means a lot. Although, I'm doubtful the friendly service was enough for me to try again. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Indeed we wanted to try something new and was told by several other people this place was amazing.  The restaurant is very nice and the atmosphere is amazing.   Now long story short, our waitress wasn't very pleasant and not very knowledgeable.  She did not give us the Chicago vibe we as a family were looking for and each trip she made to our table was subpar.  We got more info and knowledge from the waiter at the next table.  Secondly, in my opinion when your staff is doing side work it should be out of the public eye especially if you allow them to bring in their own bluetooth speaker and you as a company allow them to play explicit rap music.  Me being a black man and love hip hop do find it very unprofessional for me to walk by this man and hear lyrics that suggest a man just needs to hold his junk and make money and that is the PG version.  What if it was anybody else and they had there kids with them, what if I was of a different era would this be accepted.  So the management needs to make things happen and stop this nonsense.   I may visit again but without my kids and try and tolerate this behavior and unprofessionalism!"}
{"text":"The pizza was allright. Honestly Lou malnati or even oregnoes deep dish is a better choice for deep dish pizza in Arizona. Not to say you shouldn't try it because it still is good. Just the other two options I gave are probably marginally better. My main complaint is the staff. We were there I believe at 840 and waited an hour to be seated. We did the pre order where we ordered before sitting so we wouldn't have to wait as long so the combined wait time was about 40 minutes to be seated and another twenty for the deep dish pizza. The place was slowing down and it was ten pm. Our food was done and our waiter kept coming back to our table saying have a good night... basically trying to kick us out. I understand if the place was busy but they had no wait or anything. The guy just repeatedly kept coming more agitated each time. It was just a bad show of customer service and was enough to sway me to other deep dish options."}
{"text":"We visited Giordano's for the first time yesterday and had a great experience! Being from the Chicago area and having had their deep dish pizza on Michigan Avenue, this was just like being home. The service was excellent, pizza was cheesy and hefty and the atmosphere was perfect of a modern pizzeria. We will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"From Chicago and had never had Giordano's After a being seated and waiting 1 hour and 55 minutes for the pizza to be served it was the worst deep dish ever. Like having tomato and cheese soup. Much of the pizza middle had no crust and the sausage was almost none existent.  The appetizer sampler was decent but little food for the price.  Only redeeming factor was the server Ashley. Don't waste your time or money. Uno and Due are the best in Chicago."}
{"text":"Incredibly upset with this place. Ordered my food three hours ago. Still hasn't arrived. Called the place multiple times and told it was on the way. Not one apology for it being late. Never again"}
{"text":"I hate critiquing recently opened restaurants, but my experience at Giordano's was something else.  Don't get me wrong the pizza was great, which it had to have been considering it took about two and a half hours for it to get to our table.  We came to Giordano's expecting a wait, which I did not mind, considering I stood in line for Lou Malnati's grand opening for a few hours.  When we first got there we checked in and were told it would be about an hour wait, which was fine.  We finally get our text saying our table was ready, so the hostess proceeds to walk us to where our table should have been but come to find out, there is not a single table available, she told us that they accidentally sent that text.  Which at this point, I was still fine and understood that like any new restaurant there will be small issues like this one.  So we wait a bit more, and finally they call us back saying that our table is ready, again, we begin to walk to where our table should have been and nothing.  NO TABLE AVAILABLE! So we are told to wait a bit longer, until they finally call us and actually sit us down.  While we waited for our table, we ordered our pizza, and were told it would take about an hour and a half for it to be made due to them being busy.  So we wait, slowly approaching the hour and a half mark, rarely acknowledged by our waitress and never updated on the status of the pizza. While we waited, tables that were sat after us get their pizza and even finish and leave.  Finally, after two and a half hours we get our pizza.  Which was good, but the experience itself made me not enjoy as much as I normally would have.  Will I go again? Who knows, if so, and things improve this review will be updated."}
{"text":"I had Giordano's in Chicago when I was there for Valentines Day of this year, I was so in LOVE I ordered one to bring home.. on the plane.. frozen.. stuck it in my freezer and had it 1.5 months later.. it was just as good as being there... In between the Original Chicago brought pizza I ordered one to go from here in Peoria.. called it in, it was total chaos when got there, the to go counter was in the middle of a nightmare... but I got my pizza and left.. only to get home and be disappointed that it was missing what I brought home from Chicago, the flavor was off, and the crust was burnt.. but I am not a quitter... I will give it another try, hoping for the same experience as in Chicago..."}
{"text":"I had lunch off their \"lunch menu\" and ordered the 6\" deep dish pepperoni pizza. The full pies take 45 minutes to bake and that's understood, but the lunch menu pies have pre-baked crust that was hard and all they did was put some cheese, pepperoni and lots of sauce on top. It wasn't hot nor was it cold, just warm. Very disappointed. Wait the 45 minutes for the fresh pies!"}
{"text":"Visited with the whole family for the first time tonight and we are slightly disappointed. We frequently go to Old Chicago and Don's pizza where the pizza is great! Other reviewers had mentioned long wait times and lackluster service but that is not our complaint.  The major complaint is the food. The Spaghetti lacked flavor and the kids pizza was flavorless as well with a hard dey crust. After mentioning the food to the manager she brought a meat flavored marinara that was better and helped with the flavor and offered fresh garlic to enhance taste. We initily thought that the waiter hated her job and didn't want to be there, but she later redeemed herself. we'll have to say that our expectations were much higher hearing about the reputation from Chicago, but honestly the existing chain restaurants are outperforming at this point. so have to give this one a 3. and only because the manager really cared about how happy we were about the food."}
{"text":"As good as it gets. Food, Service, attention to detail were all amazing. The deep dish was as good as our friends said it would be, but the pasta and salad were just as good. The only thing better than the food was the service. Quick, attentive and patient with first timers who had questions. The manager even came by to make sure we were happy. YES WE WERE VERY"}
{"text":"I thought I would give it a try. Boy was I disappointed. Not even in the same league as Lou Malnati's. Crust is horrible. Pizza took 1.5 hours to arrive at our table. Don't waste your time here. Go to Lou's. They have real Chicago pizza."}
{"text":"I've waited for 17 years to have great pizza in Arizona. I need to search no more. Its just as good as the Chicago locations"}
{"text":"I have eaten this pizza all the time in Chicago and love it. So I would love to give it 5 Stars but since I NEVER even got my pizza I can't. I know they just opened so we ordered take out at 4:30. Scheduled pick up for 6:15-6:30...well still no pizza at 7:15 so we asked for a refund. All we got was an apology. Really that's it? The people working at the take out were too busy taking phone calls and telling people they would 'check on their pizza' instead of helping all the customers waiting. Very disappointed. Chick fi la here we come."}
{"text":"Went here on a Wednesday night before 5, before they were busy.   Got seated and a waitress came over about 5 minutes later.  Said she would be right back.  After waiting 5-10 more minutes, all the while watching 4 or 5 servers standing at end of bar chatting, she finally came back.  We ordered food, beer and I asked for water.   She brought our beers and I asked for water again.   Watched as she joined the group at the end of the bar for a bit and finally came back about 5 minutes later.  I asked for water again.  Third time a charm I guess.  Got our food and it was ok.  Not really hot but good.  Definitely not good enough to overcome bad service.   Oh well.  Tried it but will not be back."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great take home deep dish Chicago style pizza look no further. We got our pie home and it was hot and ready. Excellent flavor and pizza!! Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This is the best Chicago pizza anywhere around. The stuffed pizza is so perfect, I would not change a thing! Definitely worth the drive! We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious.. I like the herbs and seasoning they put all over the pizza. Amazing spot for the family to come together for a get together."}
{"text":"Ok so first impression:  cute place, nice decor and seems like a real place in Chi-town.  We put our name on the list and we're told 30-40 minutes...not bad for week 2!  We waited and waited....everyone sat but us.  I was okay until a party of 7 was quoted 1.5 hours and sat in 10 minutes.  Oh heck now...I have been waiting longer than my 40 minutes and now I'm irritated.  I asked the hostess and manager who was standing at the front how this was fair, manager was polite and said she was sorry and sat us immediately.  She said the hostesses are learning and it's a work in progress.  I understand learning, but who logically thinks this is right.  4 large parties sat in front of us, so if u come get a group and you will sit fast.  It was nice to preorder the deep dish since it takes so long...so this!!!  So we finally sat.  Our server, Ashley (with the cool hair cut) was amazing!! Off the bat I knew things were on the up.  Started with cheese bread and loaded potatoes things.  Both were delish!!  Then we had a famous deep dish pizza and Italian beef sandwich.  This place is good!!  I have never had the real thing in Chicago, but this place is good!  Nice flaky crust and delicious toppings!   We will be back for sure!  Go try it!!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time the other day. The place was packed. Staff is very friendly, welcoming, efficient. We had to wait about 15 mins for a table so they let us place our deep dish order while we waited (deep dish takes 45-50 mins), great customer service. We ordered some boneless buffalo wings to start-very tasty. The pizza looks amazing. We were pretty surprised at how flavorless it was. It was like they forgot to season it. Also, the inside was lukewarm. We will probably try this place again, but won't get the deep dish again. Fun atmosphere and very family friendly."}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago and I grew up on Giordanos. If you desperate for some deep dish this place will do but its not nearly as good as the one in Chicago. My wife and I were super excited to try this place but it was just ok, we were both a bit disappointed and we probably would not return."}
{"text":"Not only is the food amazing, but the service is excellent! We were able to preorder our main pizza while we waited and ordered our appetizers once we sat down. Everything came out right on time; they have quick service dialed in at a busy place!!!  The cooks over cooked my kids pizzas and the manager remade them without us even having to ask, AND she left the \"crunchy\" pizzas to munch on while they waited for fresh. We visit the area often and we will definitely return to this restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time tonight and I think the food we ordered is really good. We got delivery which is a nice option. We got a large think crust pepperoni, green olive, and onion pizza. Very tasty but slightly salty. We also ordered some fried cheese triangles with marinara sauce. It was delivered hot and tasty. We will definitely try them again, and order some pasta dishes."}
{"text":"This place would have all stars if their beer wasn't so expensive. Most places have like 5.95 tall craft beers not 8 dollars . If you go in for lunch your food is cheaper then a beer ! Also if they had a happy hour like every other restaurant in town I think they would have more business . Over all staff is very nice. We always get the same bartender and she is great !"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I had the 6\" deep dish pizzas. They were extremely filling! I couldn't even finish mine! They were also very delicious! I could eat the crust/breading by itself!! The service was amazing, staff was extremely friendly (to the customers and to each other). It's always an awkward feeling eating at a restaurant where you can tell the staff don't like each other. It wasn't like that here. Definitely coming here again!"}
{"text":"Received a $50 gift card for a comp meal that was bad  Had the stuffed deep dish.  OUTSTANDING  Be prepared to wait 45 mins for it though"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery online at 2:40 pm was told to expect delivery  in hour and a half, I was a lil disappointed but still ordered. I called at 4:30 pm to see where my pizza was, and they placed me on hold for 15 mins.  I gave up being on hold called back waited on hold another ten minutes and was told to expect my order in 15 minutes.  5:30 pm my pizza finally showed up an hour and twenty minutes late.  The worst part is that the pizza showed up cold and soggy.  I prob will never be back."}
{"text":"Deep dish is delish but you must be patient to wait for that perfection cuz it takes time to come out of the oven.  We love the dish but have turned to their hand tossed with a layer of giardiniera between their tomato sauce and cheese!  Gotta ask for it but it truly Chicago style and awesome!  Giordano's is a place where you take time out to enjoy the restaurant experience of a good meal, friends/family time without the need for rushing."}
{"text":"So my husband and I came here in a weeknight and were seated promptly. We ordered the mozzarella sticks as a appetizer. ( waiter told us the pizza would take about 40 min) and we also ordered the meatball sandwich to share. The sandwich was  excellent fresh hot and melty, the mozzarella sticks were just average very little cheese mostly breading. Now the pizza came out in about 40 min as we were expecting and it was just HORRIBLE!!!!! The dough wasn't completely done in the middle it was a soggy mess. We packed the rest to go and left. Our waiter was great prompt with our drinks and our bill. The pizza it self just didn't cut it . Oregano's is MUCH better!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm coming back for the chopped salad -truly a work of art and so delicious.  The service was very attentive and our party of 4 ordered two pizzas - a deep-dish and a thin crust.  Our Chicago guests said the deep-dish was better than the new lou malnati's.    Wonder where they get the cheese? It's incredibly fresh and rich - makes this pizza worth the price.  We have ordered for delivery since that restaurant visit and the pizza is piping hot, just as good as in the restaurant and a friendly driver.  I like the online order option with delivery time estimates."}
{"text":"What to say about this place didn't really get a try the pizza too much after waiting 40 minutes for the food they made it wrong the couple bites that I had I was not impressed at all Italian beef that's horrible I think I could have got better sandwich at Arby's the Greek salad was very small mediocre dressing had no flavor the tomato soup tastes like something out of a can overall very disappointed only thing it made it worthwhile was the manager comp in the mail and sending us home with a spinach pizza tried that one was not very good but thanks to the manager I will give it another chance maybe in a few months after they've been open for a while"}
{"text":"Place is subpar my cousins hyped this place up. First time having a Chicago pizza and things are fresh and filling. The sauce is good and toppings are fresh. I went home full but really thirsty guess things were just really salty. Overall food isn't bad and it's filling. Service messed up on my cousins order though. She wanted a personal cheese pizza and they brought out pepperoni with it. Waiter was nice enough to bring the manager to sort things out. They brought her some appetizers to Er while she waits but the thing is that she had to wait for the pizza while we finished eating. So she had to take it togo. Somehow the manager just assumed my cousin was a vegetarian which is a weird assumption. What can I say they maybe taught her assumptions in orientation. Overall I've had better pizza elsewhere I can say. If I visit Arizona again idk if I will try this place out might pass. Nice atmosphere. The place does get busy though."}
{"text":"Italian beef 3 star   pizza 2 star    cannoli a big fat 0   management lets pick it up.   staff pretty much ill trained."}
{"text":"I didn't get the chance to try the one in Chicago, so we ordered a deep dish for delivery. The deep dish takes about 45 min to cook so keep that in mind. They deliver up to 5 miles and the fee is $4.    We tried the special, which has sausages, mushrooms and onions. The pizza was alright, the marinara sauce could have been better but they definitely didn't skimp on the cheese. Compared to Lou Malnati's, I'd pick Lou's!"}
{"text":"The food was great but the service we got when we walked in was awful. The place was empty to begin with we didn't get greeted like everybody else did. Then they gave us a bus boy to seat us... no problem with that but when we asked for a booth he didn't even bother looking so we basically sat ourselves. But everybody else that walked in after us was greeted with smiles and hi and hellos and were seated by the host. Not trying to pull the racist card but that's what it seemed like."}
{"text":"I've had worse but for the price, it should be outstanding. We only buy Lou's but thought we'd try here since its a little closer. We will happily drive a little farther for Lou's as the two are not comparable. Had the Special deep dish and chicken parm. Pizza was bland with very few pieces of sausage. Chicken parm tasted like something out of safeway freezer."}
{"text":"A long wait for the pie.  But definitely worth the wait.  Sure to have lots of left overs.  Even better when reheated.  Service was good I think the deep dish takes a while to serve up."}
{"text":"First impression was parking...There is nowhere near enough for this location.  And sadly, I don't think they can do anything about that because of the area around it.  Too many restaurants in a small area.  There's just no room for more parking.  They might need to add a shuttle.  My husband went in to get a table while I looked for parking.  He was seated long before I scored a spot.  Service was pretty good.  No complaints there.  Appetizer...We ordered the calamari.  Not a fan of all the other breaded and fried stuff in with it, but overall the calamari itself was decent.  I do wish there were more lighter options for appetizers given that the pizza was definitely going to be heavy.    The pizza....It was good, not great.  The crust was dry and flavorless.  I was hoping for a buttery crust.  This was definitely not at all buttery.  As for the fillings, I did feel like there should have been more meet given what we were paying.    Overall...Just OK.  Might be back to try something else, but probably not anytime soon.  With spring training about to start, I'm guessing it's just going to be very busy in the area and its not worth that headache.  We also took the majority of our pizza home (intentionally over-ordered to have leftovers for weekend.) Disappointed that the pizza stuck (badly) to the box and it was either lose half the bottom crust or eat the box.  Need to find a better way to package the leftovers so they don't stick."}
{"text":"Called in and was put on hold for more than 5 minutes.  Once I placed my order I was told pickup would be between 6:30 and 6:50....it's 4:30! 2 hours for a couple of thin crust pizzas?  Why a twenty minute range for pickup?  I cancelled order so never got to taste the food.  Good news is that the reviews are bad, so it'll slow down enough for me to give it a try very soon.  FYI - your rating on Yelp is the same as Peter Piper Pizza.  Hilarious!"}
{"text":"Had a late lunch today at Giordano's on N. 83rd ave Peoria Az.  We were very impressed with the staff, there was a minor issue with our order and our waiter Chris R came out to check on us frequently and let us know what was going on. He did a great job and when our order came the manager was awesome and told us due to the wait they would remove the charge for the pizza and also give us another discount.  They went above and beyond.  The food was great and service awesome. Highly recommend this location and will be back!  Thanks guys for taking such good care of us."}
{"text":"The service here is pretty bad, we were seated and waited about 15-20 minutes before we had to flag someone down to find our waiter. Then a waitress just took our table because apparently our table was unassigned? We had ordered the pizza while waiting for our table and it came out tasting like it had been sitting in the back for awhile. We also had two toddlers getting cranky in the booth with us. My husband had to take our daughter outside as we waited another 20 minutes for the bill and a box. Our second toddler started crying and then the waitress came. Overall it was a pain in butt for food that wasn't even good."}
{"text":"We went here today for lunch. The food was average. We had a Bruschetta appetizer and a medium deep dish Pizza, and while the Bruschetta was very flavorful, their Pizza lacked any flavor at all in their sauce. I broke it down and tried each item separate. The cheese was good, the sausage was good, the black olives were good, the pepperoni was 'eh', but the sauce was very bland. It took 45 minutes for our pizza, but luckily we had our Bruschetta to help pass the time. I did have to get up, walk to the back of the restaurant, and ask for silverware and refills on our drinks, so the service was not so good either. I think we will go somewhere else next time. When I reached out to Giordanos, it took 2 weeks for them to get back to me. My Wife and I chose not to return, because of the way we were treated. Fletcher and his team should visit Oregano's or Babbo's to learn how to run a restaurant, because I doubt if they have a clue."}
{"text":"I'm going against the grain and giving this place \"meh.\" I'll excuse the 15 minute wait to have a server acknowledge our table, because they just opened. And that right after ordering (before we were seated) we changed from a pepperoni to meatball pie after seeing the meatballs - and still getting pepperoni after all.   The sangria was very good - with the exception of the sticker still left on the orange atop my glass. Had the deep dish and the crust was pretty dry. Sauce had a bit of a sausage taste to it, which I hate.   Lighting was a bit weird too. Middle of the restaurant was dim (which was okay for dinner) but the surrounding booths had seriously bright halogen lights that felt like spotlights...like we were on display. Dimmers, please!   Might try something else there only because they deliver. But for Chicago pizza, I'll drive the 20 miles.   #teammalnati"}
{"text":"The food was delicious but I had to take it home since we ordered calamari and salad and pizza to go and i had to have spaghetti. I'd recommend this place to everyone. Ebony was an awesome waitress. She was very nice and checked up on us if we needed anything."}
{"text":"I am so completely and utterly disappointed tonight. My son joins the army tomorrow and we wanted to celebrate with a nice dinner. We always go to Giordanos and we usually have excellent service. I felt like I was in the twilight zone tonight. It's 6:30 pm on a Sunday and they were not busy at all. We waited a good five minutes to be seated. Employees were walking by and nobody greeted us or said they would be right with us or anything. One girls badge said trainer and she didn't even acknowledge us. Finally we were sat at a table and given menus. After sitting there for 15 minutes we walked out. Nobody greeted us. We already knew what we wanted so our menus were sitting on the table, obviously we were ready to order. Nobody ever introduced themselves or anything. After 15 minutes of sitting there, we just got up and walked out. I have never had service like this at Giordanos. Your trainer needs training. The staff seemed like they were having fun joking and laughing. I'm not sure if I will be back. There are several restaurants in the arrowhead area with excellent customer service. Maybe that explains why they weren't busy at 6:30 on a Sunday night."}
{"text":"Yo yo yo all my yelp friends I went to Giordano's tonight and for me personally it taste like frozen pizza . I was not a fan . On a positive note the hostess and servers are all top notch .  As always if you go enjoy and let me know what you think ."}
{"text":"Excellent deep dish pizza. Love the sauce and the abundance of cheese! The sampler is okay. Pretty small portion. The mozzarella triangles were the best part of the sampler. Service was great--our waitress even served us our first slice. I like Giordanos much more than Loumalnati's. I will be back. The bathrooms were clean and well stocked."}
{"text":"Best Chicago Deep Dish Pizza in Arizona, hands down!   Baked to perfection! No wait, plenty of parking, friendly wait staff, and hot, gooey, delicious pizza...what more could you ask for."}
{"text":"I was in the area running errands so decided to stop for lunch. The lunch specials are a great deal (I believe I paid $8.95 for the personal pizza and salad combo) and the food came out extremely fast...almost too fast because you can tell they pre-make the pizza. The food was tasty but the pizza definitely could have been  hotter and fresher. Understand the need to pre-make since it's so thick but at least fake it a little better. Service was top notch. Don't like that they charged for a side of ranch. I would return but request the pizza be cooked extra."}
{"text":"I was so happy to find out they had opened my favorite pizza joint in AZ but unfortunately, the pizza was not the same.  Very lacking on the toppings.  If I had wanted a cheese pizza I would have ordered it.  Not the same pizza I had in Chicago.  The sauce and crust were spot on, just seriously lacking the toppings.  We also tried the lasagna, which was excellent.  The GM (I think Vicky) was awesome as well as the rest of the staff.  The wait was not horribly bad it takes time to cook that huge pizza but it came out very quickly.  I think I will return for one more chance in a few months as Phoenix is a lot closer than Chicago to Tucson.  Please get that pizza like the one I remember in Chicago."}
{"text":"Best Deep Dish pizza in Chicago lands in Peoria! Worth the wait as these do take time to bake. Large TVs but they don't play sound just FYI. A must if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Fettuccine didn't have a lot of flavor. The pizza and wings weren't that great for the price."}
{"text":"Good food worst service slow took hour to get food longer to correct and longer to pay !!!! Don't bother or order pick up only when ready Maybe I won't be"}
{"text":"At this point, don't bother. They don't take reservations, they don't start a pizza until you arrive and put your name on a list for a table, but even then they don't have the over capacity to support this practice. We waited an hour to find out that we were still 45 minutes from a table and and 90 minutes from seeing a pizza. Two stars because they have excellent pizza in Chicago, zero stars because you can't eat it here without a three-hour commitment."}
{"text":"WORST customer service. We got their deep dish pizza which was delicious but the customer service ruined it! We expected to wait as we knew it took a while to cook but we waited and waited and waited more with little to no service and drinks. Our server was more interested in the groups of employees at the take our register, bar and hosted stand than any of his tables. I asked for a water and 20 minutes later no water and he still has not returned. When he did return there was still no water so I asked again and then 10 minutes later another guy returned with a glass of water. And then good luck getting it refilled. The entire time several employees were sitting at a high top table next to us and not once did one of them try to help. The manager walked by our table no less than 15 times and also never tried to help with empty glasses on the edge of the table. Needless to say, we are not impressed!"}
{"text":"talk about chicago in az what a perfect place to get some friends and family together and enjoy an amazing pizza pie. Everyone loves cheese and they are on point with that and the quality is amazing yes you have to wait a little for them to make the pan pizza but in the end its just amazing!"}
{"text":"We ordered takeout tonight and absolutely loved it.  We had a couple of deep dish pizzas, a gluten free pizza, a salad, some wings, and the cheese curds.  Everything was delicious!  Also, the service picking up the food was excellent.  Everyone was very friendly and the food was ready on time."}
{"text":"I've missed great pizza since moving to Peoria.   My all time favorite is Giordano's on Rush St, Chicago.  I thought I had to accept mediocre pizza here in Peoria, but along came Giordano's.  If you want REAL Chicago Style pizza this is it.    Best in the Valley."}
{"text":"Yep, like most of the previous yelpers - I did grow up in Chicago and have had my fair share of deep dish pizza. Giordanos is not my first choice when it comes to deep dish but, a friend really wanted to try it so we were game.  This is the first valley location and of course I was very skeptical they could make a true Chicago deep dish here in Phoenix. Anyway, we had a large group and were seated outside on the patio. Drinks came slowly most of the night but, we were here for pizza so not a deal breaker. I know deep dish takes time 45 minutes or so and since we ordered several pies I knew it would take longer. After an hour passed, the pizza made it to our tables and looked great. We ordered mushroom and sausage on one and pepperoni on another. Even got a thin crust for the kids. Overall, the pizza was cheesy goodness. I would say very good but, the canned mushrooms were a bit rubbery and were a bummer. Sausage was great, pepperoni too. Even the thin pizza was tasty. Service was steady and friendly but, a bit slow at times - especially drinks - may be that's the bartenders fault but, all we ordered was beer, wine or soda - nothing should take 15 minutes to get there when the place is half empty. Yes, I would eat here again. It's a fair try at a Chicago classic but, there are better even in the valley. Personally, I like to get my deep dish fix when I visit chi-town in the summer."}
{"text":"Their deep dish was better than Lou Malnati's. Their crust was pretty dense and almost biscuit-like. We enjoyed the Artichoke and Feta thin crust pizza a lot, it had great flavors. We also tried the mozzarella triangles, cheesy garlic bread, and bruschetta and all were very tasty. The cannolis had a weird texture and were not as sweet as some of the other cannolis that I have tried. Probably won't go out of our way to go back."}
{"text":"Food is delicious, I've heard nothing but great things, first time going there service was great but today I went and had Veronica taking care of me, she was in normal clothes so I assumed she was some type of manager but I literally never have had worse service in my life. Forgot to put in our order so she gave us the salad for free, but then never returned to our table again. She took so long I had to leave money on the table and walk out. Another server refilled our waters and asked if anyone had helped us we sat so long and it was my first meal after not eating all day long. Upsetting because I liked the food and the service ruined it for me."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, I can say its different because it's Chicago style.  I liked it when I initially went there for the reason the crust on the bottom was still crispy even after being baked.  The second time I went the crust on the bottom was soggy. I would say a big thing for me is consistency, it was night and day each time I went. It's a good pie if it stays consistent."}
{"text":"I've been to several Giordano's over the last decade or so in Chicago, Minnesota, Indianapolis and now Peoria.    The experience here was both in line with other locations and what you would expect at a new location with new staff.  The service was probably closer to 2-3 stars, but I think they'll improve as their experience grows.  The pizza was fantastic and just as good as any other Giordano's location I've visited.  The host did a very good job of managing the crowd and setting reasonable expectations.  They also did not forget to remind us to pre-order the pizza so it would be done soon after we were seated.  No complaints."}
{"text":"This was my first time at the Arizona location and it didn't disappoint. I felt like I was back home in Chicago.   We mid afternoon so we got sat right away. We were greeted immediately which is always a plus for me. We got the drinks and pizza going since the pizza takes 45 min to cook. Then we ordered the calamari and mozzarella triangles and they were sooo good. The portions were great too.   The server kept keeping an eye on our drinks which makes me happy. I can't stand when my drink is empty so I'm glad our server was on top of it.   The pizza came and wow was it good. I was nervous since it's not in Chicago but it didn't disappoint at all. Our family is large so we got three pizzas (deep dish of course) and it was so good. We got mushroom and pepperoni on one, sausage mushroom on another and then a gluten free one. They were sooo good. I was so full otherwise I would've had more   I'll be back! Such a great experience. Great food and great service. Thanks giordanos!"}
{"text":"I have been to Giordano's - Arrowhead three times now.  The first two visits had horrible service.  However, I was contacted by the manger of this location and she heard my complaints.  I am happy to say that my last visit was much improved. We stopped in for lunch today around 12:00 and were seated promptly, and less than 5 minutes our server came to take our order  We ordered the thin crust pizza and it took about 25 minutes to arrive.  The server did an excellent job checking back with us frequently.  Thank you Vicki  for taking the time to address our concerns, and as demonstrated, working with your staff to improve customer service.  I highly recommend that if you had tried Giordano's and were frustrated with the slow service, that you try it again.  It appears that management had taken great measure to improve this aspect."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar for so long and never got a drink much less a bite to eat.  Can't say how the food or drinks were but can say when you're ignored for almost 20 minutes at the bar on a Saturday afternoon and there's not one other single person at the bar, I'm giving you are 1 star because there's no 0 star.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"Went on a weekday. Was not busy. Had to wait about 5 minutes to get greeted at the front door. Wouldn't ya know this would be a recurring theme. We were sat down and then had to wait 5-10 minutes for a waiter to come over. Well they never came over someone helping the waiter came over. We immediately placed our order knowing that the Pizza would take a long time. Pizza arrived and was fantastic. It made up for any bad service. Needless to say have your hopes up for the pizza, but not for the service. Will go back, try the bar, always someone behind there to help you..."}
{"text":"I hate writing reviews of places, but if you come with any more than three people then prepare to wait forever for simple things like drinks and so on. I waited over 30mins for a beer to come to my table. Three different waiters came and asked and three different waiters were informed and nothing came of it. Food is good, wait staff is not. Bring your patience!"}
{"text":"So compare to Giordanos in Chicago they miss the bar! Ordered the Sausage pizza but very little Sausage on the pizza.. The crust was OK, not as good as what I remembered from the original in Chicago."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I have been to them in Chicago and this one is just as good in my opinion. The only downside is the wait time for their traditional deep dish pizzas but as long as you plan accordingly, it's not a problem"}
{"text":"Without bashing the entire franchise, Giordano's is a great pizza stop on the south side of chicago. Growing up 10 minutes away from the original location means you spend a lot of time there. Since moving to arizona less than a year ago, I was excited to see Giordano's had made its way west. After trying their pizza 3 times, it proves me right that any pizza here is incomparable to chicago and it's somewhat embarrassing to the original locations. Nothing tastes the same and it's always a long wait just to be disappointed in the product. Apparently, if I want good pizza i'm going to have to go back home for that."}
{"text":"Ordered take out last night around 9:30pm , the girl told me over the phone it would be 30min ,when we got there , paid for the food but the food is not ready so we waited waited waited , in the beginning there was one girl in the bar area, all other employees are cleaning in the kitchen , after a while the girl also went inside the kitchen doing her side job , so there  was as nobody outside  when we wanted to ask what's going on with our food , finally the guy done cleaning and brought food to us , that was almost 10:30pm.  The food was very delicious, but the service wasn't good."}
{"text":"Great pasta and meatballs.  Sadly no sweet Italian Sausage."}
{"text":"After the fabulous Yelp event, I came back with my family over Winter Break. Sadly, we did not get the same service that we enjoyed. Our server was very distracted and rarely came to check on us.  We ordered a stuffed pizza, the Special. It was okay, but got cold too quickly.  We also had a pepperoni pizza, thin crust. It was cold when it came out.  The best pizza was THE SPECIAL - THIN CRUST Sausage, mushrooms, green peppers & onions. It was crispy and maintained its flavor and texture even as it cooled.  The favorite part of our meal was the calamari plus. We were a little disappointed because we asked our server for more fried lemons, but they only had a couple of pieces. That is always the highlight of our meal here."}
{"text":"This is by far the best deep dish in Chicago; NOW in the Phoenix area too!!! When I saw this my first reaction was naw it's someone else using the name. Then low and behold the angels came down and started singing and shire as hell it is THE Giordanos pizza!!!!!!!!!!! Living in New Mexico and only getting to go to Chicago once a year on business, this made me almost cry with delight. This will be a stop every time I come out here."}
{"text":"Not impressed, had a thin, because I was told it would take an hour for a thick. Comparable to fuzzys, if you remember it by Albertsons off bell and 83rd. Medium was $22.75, wait was 1/2 hr, way over priced, I'm told deep dish is better will half to give that a chance, we were there late Sunday, think I'll order to go, place is awful slow!"}
{"text":"Best Chicago Style pizza in town the deep dish is to die for here. Must say though 3 hour wait for a pizza is insane but the wait is worth it.   The wings are a little weak but everything else is good."}
{"text":"Wow! 5 of us and all 5 left raving. Among us, we ordered the sampler, house salad, Caesar salad, BBQ bacon chicken deep dish, fettuccini Alfredo with chicken, the Italian beef sandwich and all 3 desserts. We had not one negative thing to say.   The service was great too. 2 different managers checked in on our table and both were genuinely friendly. Our waiter, Joe, was very attentive and never let drinks get dry.  He also consistently checked in.   The pricing is great too.  My boys, 19 and 21, were talking on ride home about going back themselves. They liked how it was something they could afford and great food.   It was an overall great experience and we look forward to coming again."}
{"text":"Had a mother, son date  Was nice to sit and chat  Able to eat our salad and not have the rest of our food come so fast!  Pizza A+++++ Calamari A+++++ Great addition to Peoria"}
{"text":"Update. Ok so I messed up my online order. I'm old and online means hard. I only finished step four on the order. To send your order you have to finish step five and send order. I may be old but I can still learn.  Now about the food. I heard so much about this place even after hours of failed attempt to order online, I decided to go there and eat. I went on Friday night, not too smart right? Waited 30 min and sat.  I ordered the large meat meat that I failed to get online (cause I'm stupid). I also ordered beer and Italian salad (fam style).  The pizza was amazing. What you read is true, fresh delicious, amazing. I will order that again. One piece is a meal. There is like 8 slices on a large. You are packing that home.  I did not like the salad, just not to my taste. I won't order that again. Also small for a family salad size. Would feed 4 easy. So maybe I'm too picky.  I gave the place four stars cause the salad was not fantastic. If I was rating the pizza alone 5 star.  no yes   Nothing about the food here.  I have heard how good this place is. So I ordered online the meat meat large deep dish. These take an hour to cook.  I drive 40 min to pick up my pizza, the staff is too busy to assist me right away, too busy talking to other waiters. The place was only 25% full at12:55 on 2-17. Waited 5 min for help. She looks up my order and they don't have an order in the system.  When I ordered online it gave a pick up time and payment amount to pay cash at the store.  She offered to make a pizza but that's an hour wait and 40 back home. So I declined.  If you order online, better call them and verify the order.  May be the best pizza on earth but I'll never know since they can't deliver on there online order."}
{"text":"Place is dirty. Food an utensils on the floor. No one picking it up, crayons on floor where someone can slide and fall. Other things going on too, this is our first and last visit here."}
{"text":"For God sake if you don't want to wait for the best pizza in the area PLEASE PLEASE go to Streets and lighten the load here. Came Saturday 5pm and sat right down. Pizza is just like home. If your from NY or a native of AZ you won't understand. Let the Chicagoan's do their thing here. The Pizza is awesome!"}
{"text":"I am writing this review 4 days after eating a deep dish pizza and my stomach is still upset. I did not realize until after eating 3 slices that the top layer of dough was not even cooked. It was a gooey mess that gave me intense abdominal pain for 3 days. The sad part is that the pizza took well over an hour to get to my table after ordering it and it was not even cooked all the way through.  The restaurant was not even busy and it was 3 in the afternoon.  So needless to say I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Waited an hour and 10 mins for a very expensive pizza to be delivered cold .... very disappointed go Lou's Born and raised in Chgo :( very disappointing"}
{"text":"There's nothing to say. It's Chicago Style pizza in Phoenix. I have died and gone to pizza heaven!"}
{"text":"We showed up here to have dinner only to be told that they couldn't seat out party of 7 due to a yelp event taking place (If I could rate yelp I would). Now my family needs to find somewhere else to eat. This information should have been posted somewhere and not waiting until you showed just to tell you that they cannot seat you."}
{"text":"Let me just say I was waiting months for this restaurant to open. As transports from the Chicago area, we were looking for a taste of pizza back home. There was a long wait, which was expected. They stuck to their 60 minute wait time and seated us on time. We pre-ordered our deep dish pizza for the table because they take a long time to cook. Once seated, we ordered our salad and appetizers. After being seated for 45 minutes with just our drinks, we received our pizza. The kitchen was backed up on the appetizers and salad. We asked the waiter when those would be coming out. The waiter was extremely apologetic and the manager came over without us asking. They comped our entire meal, alcohol included. The food was amazing, even though it came out of order. They just opened, and the manager said they are still trying to work out some kinks. We will definitely be back. Great service besides the kitchen delays. And the food was amazing!"}
{"text":"Crappy service. Rude wait staff. Better pizza in the frozen food section in the grocery store. Truly sad it looked so promising."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I recently moved to AZ from Chicago and were pleasantly surprised that there was a Giordano's here! In my opinion, this location is better than some of the locations in Chicago. We usually order either a pepperoni deep dish or a thin crust Chicago Classic (my personal favorite) which is Pepperoni, green bell peppers, onion, and mushroom. Delivery is usually on time and hot, but nothing beats dining in and getting the pizza straight out of the oven. We will definitely be regulars here."}
{"text":"I have been to the Chicago location and they haven't missed a beat.  AWESOME!! Thanks Josh!!!"}
{"text":"I visited this place in Chicago and it was amazing. I was so excited to bring my girlfriend here on New Year's Eve but it was the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant. The deep dish had a warning that it would take 45 minutes. Fine! So we order A deep dish anything crust. The thin crust took an hour and a half to come out and there was barely anyone in the restaurant. Once we got the pizza it was terrible. Nothing like what I had in Chicago. I picked a piece of the deep dish up and everything fell right on to the plate. Really hope they fix things or this will be a huge loss"}
{"text":"Wish they had a location in the East Valley, it was quite the drive out to Arrowhead from Scottsdale! ...but ultimately worth the trip to try this place out at least once. Looks brand new, with nice comfy booths and casual yet intimate atmosphere. Didn't obnoxiously scream \"Chicago!\" like some places do... it was subtle, they let the food do the talking.  For an appetizer we tried the loaded fritters which were stuffed with cheddar, green onions, and bacon and were very delicious. However, the portion was kinda small and the price was pretty big - only reason they don't get a 5th star, because $10 for that app is not very good value, despite being pretty tasty.  $6 would be much more reasonable, or make the serving twice the size. Ultimately, as you will read in the rest of the review, that is the one negative for me with everything else being pretty darn top-notch.  Christine tried the soup of the day - minestrone, and noted it was one of the best she ever had. I tasted it and it was quite flavourful without being overwhelmingly seasoned.   For our main entree, we went straight to their legendary signature dish - the stuffed deep dish pizza, and man did it live up to it's reputation! This is the real deal - authentic legit Chicago-style deep dish, double-crusted and stuffed with cheese, the way its supposed to be done. Note that it takes 45 mins to cook one of these; but worth the wait, it was absolutely delicious. The crust was biscuit crispy and almost flaky like a pie but not quite. The sauce was not too sweet or acidic & was really nice, and the mozzarella was just creamy enough to be gooey & stretchy but still hold together in the slice. The toppings were good too: tomatoes were fresh and didn't turn to soup or slide off the pie, and the onions were not overpowering but still had a that nice hint of taste. However, the ham and sausage we ordered were decent though they didn't stand out in particular - they could have had a little more punch to them.   These pies are hefty! We shared a small, and could only finish half between the two of us. On a nice side note: the leftovers reheated very nicely in our convection oven on a preheated pizza stone, so I got to experience that delicious pie all over again :)    For dessert we had the tiramisu, which was also top-notch. The fingers were soaked but the bottom of the plate was still dry as you cut into it, I love that.  Deserving of 5 stars was our server, who was outstanding! She made recommendations and was honest about the menu and her preferences, which we really appreciated. She also hooked us up with a few craft beer samples, and I'm pretty sure we got a piece of dessert much bigger than what they normally served. We told her it was our first time, and I felt like she hooked us up and made sure we had a terrific experience.  Overall, food quality (especially the stuffed deep dish) and service were 5 stars, but the review gets 4 because of the price - dinner for two plus tip cost me $75! Which just means we cannot go there anywhere near as often as we would like. If it was more like $40 for what we ordered, we'd probably go once a month. Either way, I definitely recommend Giordano's if you are looking for legit Chicago-style deep dish pizza - probably the best in the valley (and I heard it's way better than Lou Malnato's on Central....). Located at 83rd ave and Bell Rd, at the Arrowhead mall."}
{"text":"Terrible, terrible, terrible. Let me say first that we didn't get the deep dish, I didn't realize that is what they were famous for. Also the staff were nice, not overly helpful but never rude. My daughter got their wings, super fatty (probably Tyson). There was a long blonde hair in it, she has dark brown hair. When we told our waiter he said OK then took the plate, no apology. They did bring her out new ones but like I said before they were to fatty to enjoy. They did not even offer to take them off our bill. Our thin crust pizza taste like it literally came from a box. I can't even remember the last time I have had thin pizza this BAD!! The ice cream cookie had generic tasting ice cream and I believe it was covered in the store bought Hershey's syrup. I have never written a bad review about a restaurant, only good ones. Nothing has ever been that disappointing that I felt the need to write one until now."}
{"text":"I was so excited to get Chicago style deep dish. I was not let down! The pizza was great!!! They had green olives! We have looked all over town for a pizza place, any pizza with green olives. To then get them on a fantastic deep dish pizza was such a treat! Anthony, the waiter was very nice and the perfect amount of attentive. All this at a very reasonable price. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I think the crust could be a touch better. A little butter on the crust world make it perfect. We will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Great pizza ordered the Chicago deep dish chicken sausage, mushroom, and spinach. It was very good"}
{"text":"The best pizza in AZ. Order the stuffed crust. We have been there twice this past week."}
{"text":"Me and a friend, both formally from Chicago stopped in to get a taste of back home. We were not let down at all! Our appetizer, deep dish pizza and Goose Island beer made for a perfect dining experience. The incredible staff though made it a perfect night out. From the cheerful woman who sat us to our incredible waiter Anthony who went out of his way to make us feel at home! Anthony was always there before we had to look for him. We couldn't have asked for better service or food. We will definitely be back when the taste of Chicago calls us out again."}
{"text":"After driving 45 mins to come to this restaurant, my friends and I couldn't wait to try the food. Little did we know that it would be accompanied by the worst possible service. My friend and I wanted to order a family sized chicken parmesan but our waiter thought otherwise. He talked us into ordering the individual size portion since it \"the size of the menu.\" So of course we would order that portion since it seems fitting. NOPE. The entree comes out and we both began to laugh since this had to be a joke. I asked the waiter politely if we could swap for the family size and he said no I would have to order another individual entree so I did. Another 40 mins or so and my food comes out. This time missing the garlic bread. I asked if I could get garlic bread with mine and the waiter said it's not offered with it. I was just confused why would our first order of chicken Parmesan be accompanied by garlic bread and my other friend at the table who ordered another pasta dish got garlic bread as well. Not only was the service lacking, the food as well. Please spare yourself the time and effort of putting on pants to attend this establishment. You'll only receive mediocre food at best and a waiter that's better at serving snarky remarks than food."}
{"text":"This might sound really cheesy but... I think this place is pretty grate... Ok but for real. Sat up at the bar, had great service, and great food and drink. We got the calamari to start. It was decent. Lacking a little seasoning so I did add a good amount of salt and pepper. Then we shared the Chicago Classic - Deep Dish Pepperoni, mushrooms, green peppers & onions. Please, no substitutions or modifications. For all that cheese, sauce and dough, were were definitely still able to taste the \"toppings\" as they were plenty and quality. I will say again. I personally thought the sauce and dough were lacking seasoning. But all around I did like our experience here. I will be back to try some other menu items and to enjoy more of their fun and open dinning area and large out door patio while its till nice outside."}
{"text":"I have been in the restaurant industry for over 15 yrs and tend to be very forgiving and understanding but I honestly had the worst experience from non-existant service to a 45 min wait for food 20 mins before our server even greated us."}
{"text":"Was so excited that Giordano's came to Phoenix and finally had a chance to go tonight. My wife and I were extremely satisfied. The pizza is to die for!! I think it was better than when we went to Giordano's in Chicago!! This is our new favorite pizza place! The manager stopped to check on us several times and was very nice! Service was good, I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately it seemed like the kitchen broke down.  After 1.5 hours of waiting for our order we needed to flag down our server.  Eventually the manager addresses us and in a polite, round-a-bout way we were told we would not be getting our pizza.  She was polite and understandably flustered.  Ultimately we received two $25 gift certificates and sandwiches to go.  Sure we were disappointed, however; I commend management for doing what they could.  The two Star rating is specifically for our experience.  Two Hours with two young children... it was a mess.  Be that as it may, I would recommend the establishment.  I'm willing to assume this was just an anomaly."}
{"text":"Great pizza and food. Atmosphere is awesome. True chicago style pizza resembles a lot like giordanos east in Chicago. Must go"}
{"text":"We had an amazing dinner tonight.  Our pizza was not what we ordered, however, the manager went above and beyond to make it right.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here recently with my husband. Sat outside to enjoy our beautiful winter weather. Ordered a thin crust pizza.  A salad. And my husband ordered chicken parm. The best part of dinner was the small salad and meat sauce that accompanied the spaghetti and chicken parm. Chicken parm was over cooked. Pizza was supposed to be extra thin and crispy but was extra thin and soggy. If you go order the deep dish as that is supposed to be their specialty or just stick to the salad with pasta and chicken and peas. So good."}
{"text":"This place is the absolute best! The pizza is great, the wings may be the best I've ever had - but do not ignore the sandwiches! The Italian Beef is my favorite! Do not pass this place up."}
{"text":"Dont waste your time.  Pizza is mostly cheese and bread. Crust is hard. No flavor. No toppings inside.   Not your monies worth.  As it cools down all you have is hard bread and cheese.   Bad customer service. To many bodies not enough work.  Hostesses and bar tenders have no clue what to do.  Workers stand around and complain.   Most phone calls coming in were complaints. And to go orders were wrong. Customers were not happy ti wait another hour to get another pizza. We will not return."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here. And I must say it was seriously the king of all deep dish pizza places. Valry was our server and she was absolutely amazing. We had her undivided attention and she was able to help me understand the menu."}
{"text":"This was a great dinner. We were seated in under 20 mins on a Friday night. The deep dish pizzas take a little longer to cook, but you are warned ahead of time. It was a great place with a friendly and attentive staff. We had deep dish with pepperoni and sausage. It was really great! Defi nitely will return"}
{"text":"Everything here is amazing!  I don't know what's in the marinara, but it is a difference maker!  Better pizza, better garlic bread, better service.  This place is just better!"}
{"text":"As a native Chicagoan I grew up going to Giordano's  as well as the other top Chicago style pizza joints.  I know good Chicago pizza - this is NOT it!  The pizza was undercooked and frankly gross.  My husband, myself and my daughter could not eat it.  We even thew out our leftovers the moment we got home.  They are doing Chicago style pizza a disservice.  The chopped salad was delicious.  The mozzarella triangles were great.  The wait for a table was minimal.  The wait for the pizza was 45 mins as expected.  The restaurant was nice.  The staff was nice.  The high chair was even clean (harder to find then you think).  But if a pizza place can't put out amazing pizza, nothing else matters."}
{"text":"I'm truly surprised by the low reviews, maybe Phoenix wasn't quite ready for Chicago deep dish. I thought it was incredible, much better than Lou Malnati's. It takes 45 min to cook so check out the menu in advance and order right when you get there. The pizza itself is very thick and cheesy, very rich but super delicious. Service was acceptable it was very busy when we went, ambience was very nice it's a good location near arrowhead"}
{"text":"Completely & totally underwhelmed. Picked up a Caesar salad, personal deep dish cheese & garlic bread. The Caesar salad was alright, lettuce was nice but croutons were so stale. I did appreciate that they served the dressing on the side to prevent soggy lettuce, not many places do that. The pizza sauce was incredibly sweet & not very enjoyable, crust was very soggy. The \"garlic\" bread was pretty much just pricy buttered toast, no hint of garlic whatsoever. I'm really bummed to have to leave such a negative review but with how hyped up this place is (& for what I paid for my meal) I expected SO much more."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I am a Chicago born and raised for the past 45 years. There are 3 things growing up in the Chicagoland area that are part of LIFE.  1 being hot dogs 2 being Pizza and 3 being Italian beef.   This was my first time at a Giordano's in Peoria . I'll start off by the service. My waitress was fantastic polite kind understanding and fast. Joey your awesome keep up the great work. It truly shows you love what you do .  Now for as far as my meal.. I got a medium two ingredients deep dish . Yes I had to wait 45 minutes for my pizza. If you're familiar with deep dish pizza it generally takes a half an hour to an hour to make that pizza. If you want a 10-minute Pizza go down the street to Domino's or Pizza Hut. I truly recommend this place to anybody reading this. Anyways the pizza I ordered was just as good if not better than any Giordano's I went to in the Chicagoland area. Thank you Peoria Giordano's for a great experience. I was very skeptical. God bless"}
{"text":"Go hungry!!! The stuffed pizzas are ginormous! My boyfriend and I ordered a large , and took half if it home. Be prepared to wait to get in and wait for the stuffed pizza, it takes about 45 min to make. I didn't care too much for their sangria, didn't taste like much and wine list was pretty pricey. Friendly staff, clean restaurant...a must try"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying if you go at peek times be prepared for a long wait for a table and extra time to cook your pizza. But it's so worth it!  This was our first time eating here. We have tried numerous Chicago deep dish restaurants throughout the Phoenix area. While they were decent to good they weren't not worth a return trip.   To start we ordered the Loaded Potato Fritters. They were delicious! We also ordered a basic pepperoni and sausage Chicago deep dish. We wanted to keep it simple to taste what we knew. After about 30-45 minutes (the average time to cook a Chicago deep dish) we got out pizza. It look amazing! The crust was a beautiful and perfectly cooked golden brown. Not over cooked, not under cooked, not to thick and not to thin. It didn't get soggy even the extra pieces we took home were still crunchy. The slices of pepperoni and chunks of sausage were in every bite and oh so good! And the cheese! So much cheese! We we definitely be back!   On a quick side note, they also deliver within a certain radius of course. They also have frozen pizzas to walk in, buy take home and cook."}
{"text":"Service is not quite like the quality back in Chicago but the pizza is as close as it's going to get to back \"home\". I will say since it first opened they have come to realize how many people from Chicago enjoy this pizza and have been better staffed and had less wait times for pick up and delivery."}
{"text":"Pizza was great! We had the deep dish special. No wait on a Sunday night.. we also split an entree sized Cesar salad which kept the hunger edge off during our wait.   Cocktail menu is limited. I wish there were more choices and possibly signature cocktails. My margarita was a bit light on the tequila. Husband's Moscow mule was tasty but also a light pour. No mule mug."}
{"text":"It's about the same as it is in chgo. Nothing special but it's closer to home so I tried it. Employees seem to have gotten their act together and were friendly. It's obvious this is no Lou Malnati's before you even walk in the door. Not even open a month and more than 1/2 empty at lunch. Probably the best part was hearing the guys at the bar far more impressed with the bathroom hand dryer system than the pizza."}
{"text":"Good pizza. Not great. Not sure what all the hype is about. We waited quite a while for our medium pepperoni pizza and it wasn't a busy night. When it finally arrived it was thick and gooey and I was expecting something spectacular. Wow was I disappointed. It's not bad by any means. It's just not great. The sauce on top is a gimic, to what end I'm not sure. The sauce is average at best. I've had much better pepperoni. Please tell me one of the other Chicago transplant pizzerias is worth the money. Until then, we'll stick with that awesome place out of NY."}
{"text":"Wow! We ordered a thin crust and deep dish. Both were so good. Deep dish is totally worth the wait.   We arrived about and hour and half before closing on a Sunday night. Great time to go- no wait to be seated and it cut down on the time to bake our pizza."}
{"text":"My first review was not favorable, however, after the manager invited us to give it a 2nd try, our experience was greatly improved. And the pizza was awesome. I highly recommend it. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I just got carry out. Awesome pizza. Cooked perfectly, friendly staff, great family atmosphere, very clean. No wonder it's so busy.  I'll be back often."}
{"text":"Update: The manager sent us a gift card to try out Giodano's again. Completely different experience tonight. The food and service were much better. The waiter wrote down our orders and they were mostly right. One pizza was missing jalapenos on half and the other pizza had mushrooms which were not requested. Either way, they tasted great. The cheese was melted and the crust was not soggy. The wait was not as bad as last time either (they were not as busy). The waiter checked on us regularly and refilled drinks when needed. After tonight's experience, I would be open to coming back.   Hint for leftovers: Use a small amount of oil in a non-stick skillet and fry them for 2-3 minutes prior to putting them in the oven, it keeps the crust from getting hard and chewy!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been wanting to try this place since we saw that it opened.  We went for lunch one day last week.  We got the thin crust pizza, wings and a personal stuffed crust pizza.  My husband ordered the lunch special of the pizza and salad.  We were there during lunch and the place was not busy at all, we got seated right away.  Our server was great, a little too attentive.  I hate when they stop by your table every 5 seconds asking how things are or if you need anything. The wings had a lot of meat on them, but very little flavor.  The pizza was just ok. The think crust was not thin enough for me as I was expecting the really thing crust like what you get at Oregano's.  We spent almost $40 and it was not worth it at all.  The pizza really didn't have any flavor and either did the wings.  We probably won't be coming here again and will continue to go to our favorite place."}
{"text":"I must admit I was skeptical of this location because of the Yelp reviews but I figured give it a shot. I love Giordano's and I have been to several locations in Chicagoland and even one in the Orlando area. All have been fantastic and Giordano's is one of my favorite places to eat anywhere on earth. I love their deep dish and sandwiches and have been a customer since 2002. So every year I go with friends to Arizona for Spring Training and I saw they opened a restaurant there and it's right next to the Mariners/Padres facility. Perfect!  However the quality of the pizza is off, it's alright, but it's not the same. I can't quite put my finger on it. Maybe the cheese is different? The volume of cheese and toppings is off for sure.  My friend made a great comment when we were sitting around trying to figure it out. He said,\"You know it's fake when you eat two slices and you're not even close to being full.\"  And he's right. So anyway the place is still fairly new, maybe we will try it again next year when we are back and they'll have perfected their craft by then. Just be warned that it's not up to snuff, at least right now (3/2017) to what you might have had before in Chicago."}
{"text":"Mmmm this place is great and the wait staff is on point, checking back often and making sure you have everything you need. The only thing lacking is they need to get a pokestop so nerds like me will come more often for lunch."}
{"text":"If you LOVE Lou Malnatis like I do, you will be very disappointed by this pizza. We ordered a medium cheese deep dish just because this location is close to the house wanted to try it out. The pizza sauce tastes like the sauce out of a jar, super disappointed by this pizza! Wish they changed the sauce then could be a lot better! Won't be coming back, worth the drive to go to Lou's!"}
{"text":"Has a great H/H M-F.  They have a very friendly staff and the decor is special plus a welcoming outside eating patio.  The large NY deep dish pizza has 2 lbs of cheese on it.  They could improve with a greater selection of specialty pizzas with less cheese and more robust toppings."}
{"text":"Is this a joke? Am I being punked?! This tastes NOTHING like Chicago deep dish. It literally tastes like Di Giorno's frozen pizza. Maybe that's why it takes so long to cook, they have to go fetch it from the grocery store. The garlic parmesan fries took forever to come out as an appetizer and when it did, they were limp and soggy, sad and uninspired. Parking is ridiculous as well. Service was ok, a little overbearing for my taste. What a waste of a palate. Scratch this one off my list!"}
{"text":"Decided to eat here again because I was craving the cheesy deliciousness and received a coupon in the mail for $10 off a $30 order.   Placed a to-go order. The pizza was ready by the time I got there and was a great price with the coupon. The pizza is AMAZING! I can't stop eating it. Because of the thickness of the pizza, you can eat two slices and be full. Recommend sharing a large with 3 other people or saving it for leftovers. I think it tastes even better the next day after being warmed up in the microwave."}
{"text":"Vicki, the manager, invited me back in for an opportunity to make things right. It took a couple of weeks for me to get out to Peoria but glad that I did. We ordered a large deep dish Meat & More Meat. This was shared between 4 adults and a petite Asian and there were still 2.5 large slices to take with us. We ordered some traditional buffalo wings and calamari to share while we wait for the pie to bake. I like my wings a bit more crispy but they were still good; not too tangy. The calamari wasn't as crispy as the last time we were there but still not bad.  We had all three of their desserts: Tiramisu, triple chocolate cake with ice cream and cannolis. Most of the table liked the Tiramisu. My favorite was the triple chocolate cake with ice cream. The cannolis were the least favorite of the bunch.  Our waitress was very attentive even before we asked for Vicki.   I really appreciate a business that takes pride in their product and customer service. But what I appreciate even more is when a business owns up to their mistakes and goes above and beyond to make things right! I would definitely stop in to try some of their other offerings."}
{"text":"Got the thin crust pizza and it was very bland and soggy in the middle. The cheese tasted processed. Maybe the deep dish is better but based on the flavor of the pizza we got, I doubt it. My husband sat at the bar for 20min waiting for the pizza that was sitting on a rack the whole time. Too many decent pizza spots in town to go back and try again. Sorry giordano's."}
{"text":"After our last experience we were given a gift card to return. We came back hopping things would be much better. But I'm Sad to say it was not much better. Our Waitress was not very good very slow and was in a bad mood. I did ask her if she have a rough or crazy night. (Trying to break the ice and try to put her in a better mood) She said \" Yes this place is really messed up the over hired and our now cutting back everyone's hours so now I have to find another job because they don't know how to hire.\" Even after that once again we had to ask other staff for refills on our drinks There was a table set up behind the Hostess both and we could see here sitting there a lot and not attending to the customers. My wife's salad  was very good but our Deep dish Pizza was not very good. The crust was very well done and was very dry. We only ate 1 slice each. When we were done I had to ask someone to get our waitress because we needed our check and a box for the salad. Another staff brings over the boxes and our check. I told her about the pizza issue and she said \"yeha it is a little dark I'm sorry they been like that all night. That's why I don't get the deep dish pizza the hand stretched its a lot better.\" We were really disappointed we love pizza and were hoping things would have been much better this time. We may come back to try the sandwiches and the other pizza but not really sure. The other staff that helped us were very good."}
{"text":"As a native Chicago area pizza connoisseur, I was happy to see a Giordanos pop up by the Padres spring training facility.  Not sure what's up with the other reviews, our deep dish was ready in about 40 min and tasted just like I remembered.  Give them a try, my guess is the rough reviews were in relation to getting up and running.  We will be back next year for sure."}
{"text":"Great Chicago pizza expensive but worth it once in a while. Delivery is only$4 extra. Not a bad deal for not having to go fetch it. Have had excellent service and excellent pizza every time we've had it."}
{"text":"Our pizza took longer than expected but it was busy so we didn't mind hanging out and having a couple drinks. The staff was so amazing and kept checking on us. I think it was one of of the managers that came to our table and said our pizza would be taken off our bill because of the wait. Everyone was great. Thank you for the great service and the food is amazing !!! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Not the best Giordano's I've had, but we also carried out, so it's unfair to judge. Great location and quick take out."}
{"text":"Appetizers: we ordered the bruschetta and a salad. The bruschetta bread was drenched in liquid which means it sat somewhere for a while. Same with the salad, over saturated with dressing.   Pizza: I ordered a small pepperoni with buffalo chicken. It had so much sauce on it that every bite sauce would ooze out the sides. The center of the pizza had so much cheese that it was not edible. The pizza was $17.95 and I wouldn't have paid $5 for it.   Service: they never came to clean up after the appetizers so we had plates and forks everywhere. Just sloppy service overall.   Skip this place. We will never be back"}
{"text":"Be prepared to be disappointed. As a Chicago pizza lover, these guys need to get their sh*t together. This was my third and LAST time going here. First time I went in it was a 9 PM on a Saturday night. They close at 11 and I was told I couldn't get a pizza. They said priority of the pizza making was for dine in. I then left.. The second time I went tried this place out was about 3 weeks later. I went online to order (I placed the order at 430 PM and it stated the next available pick up time was not until a little after seven. It ended up being ready closer to 8. Pizza was cold and very soggy. Although, the beef sandwich was pretty good. The last time (and FINAL time) was Saturday, March 4th. I understand the long wait times (well over 2 hours) on dine in, pick up and delivery being 3 months old.   My bad review comes because when I ordered my $46.49 large Chicago pizza and garlic bread, it was literally thrown in a larger box, no plastic screen or divider between the bottom pizza and the box, no foil on top either. I might as well have had a spoon, because it was a gigantic soggy mess of grease and cheese. I did use a fork though, because the pizza was cemented to the bottom of the box. They called me to inform the pizza was going to be 30 minutes delayed (on top of an 1 hr 35 min delivery time) because they were short on delivery drivers. When I said I would come pick it up, the kid went on to explain that it would be the same wait... meaning they are morons and cant handle weekend business. Trust me when I say Giordano's is not even the best Chicago pizza out here. I will give my business to Rosati's and Lou's. It really sucks when these places become chains. Oh, and had to throw the garlic bread out for obvious reasons. I do not write food reviews. I went out of my way to write this negative review because I could not keep quiet any longer. If you had a pleasant experience here, you are either lucky, or do not know anything about Chicago style pizza."}
{"text":"While I do appreciate a follow up message from my yelp review, I still have no desire to return and give this place a second try. I just really don't care for your food or pizza. Nothing is going to change your preparation or style of pizza. I still stand by my comment about the great server we had. He cant control the quality of the food. Going out to eat is a treat and quite pricy nowadays, so when I eat out I only want to go to places that I feel have the quality that makes me want to return, sorry the pizza quality here doesn't do it for me or my family."}
{"text":"I'm writing this on an empty stomach 1.5 hours after putting in my order.  It's Super Bowl Sunday, I drove all the way across town for some of my favorite pizza.  It's a 35 minute bake time.  After regular updates on the status of our pizza, we were told 1.5 hours later that it was never coming out, that the oven was broken, and that we wouldn't be able to eat.  We were offered the chance to order sandwiches with no assurance that they could come out within a half hour.  Bottom line: this is the most epic fail I've ever seen at any restaurant, and I'm going to show up hungry and late to my Super Bowl party.    Giving us updates that clearly weren't accurate and a story that doesn't make sense didn't help.  The family at the table next to us were told that their pizza was accidentally given to a different party.  So who knows what the truth is.    This is not an isolated problem.    My favorite pizza from Chicago came to Phoenix and I couldn't wait to come.    The first visit was fine.  But I did notice that people seated after us were given a two hour wait time for pizza.  I figured it was a one time thing or even a result of not having their act together yet.    This location is destroying a great brand.  If you are willing to risk waiting an hour and a half to find out you're not eating pizza, go for it."}
{"text":"Giordano's is a well known Chicago Restaurant that's famous for their Chicago Style Stuffed Deep Dish Pizza. They also offer Hand Stretched Thin Crust Pizza and Crispy Extra Thin Pizza. On the menu are appetizers, salads, sandwiches, pasta and more.  On Yelp I read about the long wait times so I planned to try them when they opened. At that time parking was easy and we got sat pretty much right away. We were soon greeted by our waiter who informed us that the pizzas take 45-60 minutes to prepare.   We shared an entree sized Harvest Salad. The salad contained fresh mixed greens, dried mix fruit, candied walnuts and lots of blue cheese. This salad runs on the bitter side from all the radicchio in it.  During our wait for the pizzas at least three servers besides our waiter checked on us and offered more beverages, ice for my tea and other things. I found it refreshing that the staff worked as a team and showed great hospitality.  Just like our waiter promised we received our pizzas in about 50 minutes after ordering.  I received my individual stuffed plain pizza. The pizza wasn't sliced all the way through and I found it difficult to cut a slice as the crust was xtra dense, hard and thick. Kinda like a rock. The crust was filled with a very large molten disk of blended cheese that was topped with a oregano laced tomato sauce. The very top of the crust was bitter and burnt tasting. Although I found the cheese tasty and the sauce ok in the end it was the crust that I found inedible. I don't know if the crust I received is typical of Giordano's or not.   My husband somehow ate his pizza crust and all. He said that he was glad that he wasn't hungry afterwards and yes he said the crust was awful but he ate it anyway. He did say that the sausage was much better than the lean sausage the \"Other\" Chicago place uses.  I really liked the atmosphere and I really enjoyed the well trained servers I encountered.  I would never go back for the pizza I received."}
{"text":"I've missed Chicago style deep dish pizza since moving from there to Arizona, and Giordano's didn't disappoint. The pizza tasted exactly like I remembered it! It is great to have this taste of home right here in Peoria. My girlfriend and I enjoyed every bite, and we can't wait to go back again soon."}
{"text":"This was a great pizza. Very different from other pizzas I've had this was like a lasagna pizza is stuffed full of cheese and everything I ordered it was delicious and even reheated nicely I didn't realize it took two hours to cook the pizza but it was well worth it and I will be getting more great vacation great pizza"}
{"text":"Called at noon on Super Bowl Sunday to place an order for delivery at 345-4 pm because I knew it would be crazy. I got a call at 415 telling me their oven broke 15 minutes before. You would think my pizza would be done before that but my guess is they just forgot.  This is my second sub par experience with this place.  I was trying to give them a second chance but this was an epic fail. Thanks to Ballpark pizza for delivering 3 pizza's in under 40 minutes on Super Bowl Sunday without any lead time much less 4 hours.  The manager said they would send out gift card but my guess is they will forget that too... This place is nostalgic for people from Chicago.  If you are from here just go to Oreganos it's just as good if not better and their service is 10 times better with 1/2 the wait"}
{"text":"Well their pizza sucks just as bad in Arizona then they do in Illinois. However their Italian Beef sandwich is awesome! Not much a fan of the decoration theme, and the service wasn't that great either. Never been a Giordano's pizza fan, but they do serve other food to make it up."}
{"text":"Great Chicago style pizza.  Great location and staff is very friendly. I will say that Lou Malnatis is my favorite of all but this location is closer to home so I'm happy regardless."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT pizza, flavorful wings and delicious potato fritters. We had take-out, so I can't comment much on the service, but they were quite friendly at pick-up. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This could have been  5 star review. The server started out really good and was very friendly. Everything went down hill when a larger party showed up. We were completely forgotten about at that point.   Our food came out cold, I'm assuming this is because our server was focused on the large group and did not have time to bring our food when it came out.   The whole time we were there, our drinks were never refilled, and our server never checked on us. We had planned on ordering desert, but instead of asking if we were interested in desert, our server just brought our check.   We will probably give it another shot but we really don't want to get the same server."}
{"text":"This is possibly the worst pizza I've ever had.  Apparently splitting pizzas is not possible and to show that the waiter mansplained to me by showing me his tablet that it was \"impossible\" like I'm some fucking idiot. \"See, I can't do that, it's not an option for me to click on\"  I was served pizza better in a kindergarten cafeteria.  There is no flavor, it's like eating a cardboard box.  And even a box would probably taste better than this trash."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, not worth the wait. Food is mediocre and priced high for what you get. Wait staff is slow and couldn't get our order right. My glass went empty numerous times. Manager was walking around greeting people, but skipped us on her go around. Maybe she could tell we were irritated. I won't be back."}
{"text":"The wait is ridiculous even for being busy. There was an hour before our pizza even went into oven. No pizza is really that worth it. I've had better."}
{"text":"I've been to the one in Chicago an was excited to see one on my side of town but it definitely fails In comparison. The deep dish pizza wa bland. The timing of the food was horrible. The appetizer was quick followed by a salad. Then 30 minutes matter came the pizza then a good 40 minutes after that the lasagna. I think because it took so long the waiter avoided our table. At that point I just wanted to cancel the order and leave. He brought the pasta out and noticed we were annoyed n then thought we would actually eat it. He looked surprised when he asked him to box it up. The restaurant was not extremely busy. I will definitely not return."}
{"text":"First time at this location! YUM! Vicki was absolutely wonderful and our server was as well. Pizza does take some time but I appreciated knowing as soon as I sat down. You can't rush perfection!  We will be returning soon and cannot wait to see this restaurant grow! Thank you Vicki and the rest of the staff for making our 1st experience perfect."}
{"text":"Hostess told us the high tops in the bar were open seating. So we went in and sat down at a filthy table--but figured they just hadn't had a chance to clean it yet. 10 minutes later some server walks up and says you guys just sit down? We say yes and he says well these tables are not open seating and we need to clean it up. We tell him the hostess said it was open and he says well there not. 10 minutes with no acknowledgement and then a rude welcome. See ya."}
{"text":"We get delivery and the food is always hot and fresh. A little pricey but worth every penny. Add the meatballs to any pizza. Yummy"}
{"text":"Just sat in your restaurant for 25 minutes waiting for our order to be taken. The waiter kept walking by us, so we got up and left. This was my first experience at your restaurant.  Driving to Lou Malnati's right now instead."}
{"text":"It kills me to do this.  I'm an avid Gio fan.  I've been to many locations in Chicago and the one in Minneapolis and they're awesome!  I took a party of 7 here to celebrate my mother's birthday.  What a disaster.  Get someone out here from Chicago and FAST!!!  The pizzas took FOREVER (not the normal 40+ mins).  We waited and waited for the food and when it came, the crust was so soggy and the filling not very hot on 2 of them.  We also got 2 orders of the tomato bruschetta.  Have you ever had chilled tomatoes before?  They're disgusting!!  A tomato should NEVER see the inside of a cooler or refrigerator.  The tomatoes were ice cold and flavorless.  What happened?  I was so stoked for this place to finally open in Phoenix and we got ZONKED!    Please import management from Chicagoland and save this place, PLEASE!!!!"}
{"text":"If Giordano's is looking to compete with Lou Malnati's, they are going to have to improve their dough recipe. The crust tasted like a flaky hard biscuit which is not pleasant on pizza. Lou Malnati's dough has a wonderful yeasty dough flavor while Giordano's doesn't taste like much at all, same as their garlic parmesan french fries. C'mon give us garlic, we can handle it!  To someone who just shoves food in their face and doesn't overly think about it, Giordano's is fine, but if you consider yourself a pizza buff you will probably be let down after the fourth bite.   Overall Giordano's is not horribly disgusting but it isn't impressive either. They could also stand to hire extra staff to be refilling drinks.   If you're looking for a truly spectacular pizza, do yourself a favor and go to Grimaldi's."}
{"text":"So, I was contacted by Giordano's to try then again, and I did. I was told typically they give a $50 gift card to come in and dine. I decided to do pick up this time, and the staff in the pick up area were super friendly. We talked and laughed while waiting for the manager, Vicki, and she gave us our order (over $50) completely free. The food was just as delicious as the first time, and the whole experience was 100 times better than the first. Thanks Vicki for reaching out! I will be back again."}
{"text":"Being from Chicago for 50+ Years I was beyond excited to see Giordanos opening in my neighborhood.   After 2 visits, I remain disappointed!   The deep dish crust is just not the same, it is dry, hard to cut, harder to chew and no flavor.  I never thought there could be such a thing as too much cheese on a pizza, but is was not Cooked thoroughly.   The thin crust fared a little better, but it is not the Giordanos I am accustomed to.   They need to follow Lou Malnatis example and have people from Chicago on site to oversee operations.   I hope they improve in the future because although Lou's is further, they are spot on.  Giordanos needs to improve their parking situation, it is horrendous.  No complaints about the service, it was top notch."}
{"text":"OMG! Still hands down THE BEST Chicago style pizza on earth! I would seriously fly to Chicago just to get Giordano's. I was so happy they happened to have one in AZ!!! I just wish I had known this when I still lived there!!! Can't wait to go back! I'm going to bring pizzas (yes, plural) back on the plane with me!"}
{"text":"Good luck parking here and don't park at restaurants next door...you'll be towed. Interesting that with a full parking lot the place was half empty once I got in. Long wait for average pizza..staff need training. Basically all that reminded me of The Giordano's I used to eat at on Van Buren was the sign out front. Thumbs Down...won't be back. I prefer Spinatos"}
{"text":"It's been about a week since having a bite of Giordano's and I'm still thinking about it. That biscuity crust and that deep dish full of amazing sauce are what really speak out with every bite!   To even things out we ordered a large meat combo pizza AND a large spinach pizza to get our veggies in of course. It took a little over an hour or so to get our pizzas out, especially since the kitchen was bustling and behind on all the orders understandably. There was even apparently an almost two hour wait to even get a table but luckily our friend was able to put our name in a little earlier so our wait was only 15 minutes. The luck of timing was impeccable! We were meant to eat this pizza that night.   The last time I enjoyed this pizza was two summers ago in Chicago after a concert. I forgot how amazing it can be! I won't argue which is better Lou Malnati's or Giordano's but all I can say is that I feel just so fortunate to have Giordano's here in Arizona now AND on the west side of town so close to where I live!  Our waiter was super animated and almost seemed imported straight from Chi-town. We loved him! The atmosphere is really nice - Modern yet the brick walls really warm the place up. You can always catch sports games here too with displays everywhere. Can't wait to return again! If you haven't had authentic Chicago pizza yet, I can't tell you what it's supposed to be like because that would be an injustice to it, you'll just have to go and try it yourself!"}
{"text":"One of the best for deep dish! We have dined and and done carry out. Carry out is super simple and you can even do it through yelp. If there is a wait to be seasoned make sure you order your pizza while waiting (if you're going to do deep dish) in order to save time. This is my go to if I'm craving deep dish pizza!"}
{"text":"Please listen to the feedback of the Yelp community Giordano's Peoria. The excessive wait times -we waited over two hours (and this seems to be one of the shorter wait times from the reviews) for our deep dish pizza - need to be addressed. Given the location of this restaurant these wait times are literally driving business to Oreganos down the street and Bucca di Beppo in the nearby plaza. At the very least, get free Wi-Fi and install power plugs at every table so we can use our devices to write Yelp reviews and pass the time before the food arrives.   The food is mediocre. We had \"the special\" pizza and it was bland for all of the veggies and meats and thick sauce on top. We also signed up for the e-club to enjoy a free appetizer (bruschetta) - which was decent. The tomatoes were fresh but the \"toast\" was soggy. Given the enormous wait times - a manager comped the table near us with a gift card - they should have been giving everyone free apps and drinks. We literally took note of all of the filled tables around the restaurant and none of them had food on them - that's never a good sign at a restaurant. Ever.   The hostesses were kind and asked where people parked to avoid patrons being towed by the neighboring restaurant and the servers were super sweet too trying to do their best with the slow kitchen. The kitchen staff I'm sure are good peeps too but this restaurant needs some serious operational support to improve."}
{"text":"Arrived at 4:00 on a Friday, seated right away, but ended up sitting there for 3 hours. Ordered appetizers and waited and waited, noticed people around us got their food before us and they had come in after us. Ordered two small thin crust pizzas and one thick, knowing it takes longer to cook asked for the thin ones right away, one came out, waitress didn't swing by for another 45 minutes,asked where the other thin crust was and she had ordered thick, so they comped it and made the thin one in 20 minutes, very expensive and not good, flavorless sauce, didn't even eat the awful crust, parking is a joke but honestly fired pie is way  better"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic, however the online ordering is not as good.  Placed order and was given a 15 minute \"ready window,\" which seemed a bit broad anyway.  When I arrived, I was initially ignored, and when I was noticed, I was then told it would be another 25 minutes - which ended up being 40 minutes.  This is unacceptable and will be remembered if we choose to visit again.  No pizza should take more than an hour to bake - come on!  One of the managers did eventually talk to me and said she had reversed the charge and that the pizza was \"on them.\"  it will take a couple of days to reverse, but the effort was appreciated.  I still am not sure how a pizza - any pizza - takes this long to prepare."}
{"text":"If you have had it in Chicago it tastes the same here in Arizona.  The toasted Italian sandwich is yummy with the garlic parm fries.  We also ordered 2 medium pizzas which were super tasty as well.  Plan to come ahead because there will be a wait. My only beef is my sandwich came out way after the pizzas and check your silverware more than one piece had food stuck on it."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. When this location first opened we we're super excited and very impressed having been to the Chicago location previously. We drive 40 minutes from downtown Phoenix to get here, so we are usually HYPED about coming in. Little by little this place has gotten worse and worse. Today Giordanno's hit rock bottom for us. Terrible service, terrible, bland, luke warm food, and a terrible atmosphere. I have had better service from a drive thru. I would be more just excited to go to an Olive Garden - at least they have music playing in the back ground. I have had better, more flavorful pizza from Little Cesar's. Disappointed with this sub-par experience. Another chain restaurant that will probably fall into obscurity. Luckily you're in the West valley, where everyone's taste buds are used to frozen dinosaur chicken nuggets and Taco Bell. This would never pass in any other part of the city. Maybe Mesa. But it's Mesa."}
{"text":"Place was crowded hard to even get a parking space.  This was the good part.  We order a small special deep dish which waiter said 45 minutes to make.  After 52 minutes asked waiter and he says only been 44 minutes.  The pizza was suppose to have sausage (which we never found) mushrooms, peppers & onions.  It tasted ok but no whistles 6 slices $20.00.  We get our bill and they want us to give waiter 15% or higher and they are giving you the numbers but why would you give a waiter a precent of AZ sales tax he did nothing for that.  Not impressed not going back."}
{"text":"Very good food & service on our visit.  It's a little pricey, but for quality Chicago deep dish pizza, I don't mind blowing some coin!  I would recommend giving this place a try!"}
{"text":"This place is a constant disappointment,from the time we step in the door.  They think that by throwing a gift card at you to return will solve their problems. Unbelievable!"}
{"text":"The wait was worth it. I have heard Chicagoans brag about Giordano's deep dish and was curious to see if it lived up to it's reputation. My husband and I like to think of ourselves as deep dish snobs, so we were looking forward to this meal.  Kudos to our waiter Chris for being personable, knowledgeable about the menu and attentive to our table. With a packed restaurant we felt like his only table and it was refreshing to have that level of service. We ordered the sampler appetizer which consisted of fried mozzarella,  garlic cheese bread, boneless wings and potato cakes. The bread had fresh basil, the wings cooked perfectly and the accompanying marinara was wonderful with fresh basil zing.  We put in our order for the large deep dish pizza first. Our pizza had sausage, green peppers, onions and mushrooms. I believe it's the name is 'deep dish special' but I'm not positive. The average cooking time is 45 min so I recommend ordering the deep dish first. The pizza was the best deep dish I've ever tasted. The cheese was long and stringy, the crust was crisp and the sauce perfectly ratioed the cheese and toppings. To top it off the sauce tastes homemade and that is the secret to Giordino's. Be patient because wait times can be long but you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"First time here, party was 4 adults and 3 kids. Service was great! Antonio B. Was our waiter and it was so refreshing to have a server who was sincerely wonderful to talk to, he was on top of it the whole time, our drinks never got low, he came to check on us often and was more than happy to meet my request for a birthday cake slice and ice cream to be delivered at the end. The food was absolutely amazing! We did their speciality pizza, mozzarella sticks, garlic cheese bread, pasta dishes, Greek salad and Cesar salad. Everything was wonderful! The soft drinks were the perfect mix! We will be back for sure and hope to get Antonio as our waiter again! Antonio it's people like you who make a business! People don't come for just the food, they come for the service!"}
{"text":"First time here and was not a pleasant experience. The table was dirty and there wasn't any plates or utensils present. The pizza was not hot when it was served, which was a disappointment and it was decent overall. The waiter and manager was very apologetic about the situation and handled it professionally. Moreover, the waiter was nice and went above and beyond the rest of the night. Hopefully, the second visit will be better, overall a solid overall visit."}
{"text":"Really filthy silverware asked for new set  just as bad  asked for ketchup Disgusting!!! See photo. Italian beef so-so. Fries were good. But fries don't make a restaurant. Where ever this chain started they need to go back.  Hate to see the kitchen if what they bring out is this bad.                      So they ask me to contact them at some email,so they can make it up to me. PASS!!!!   I'll stick with this review as it is real and true.   SORRY KEEP YOUR GIFT CARD!"}
{"text":"Will not be back. After 45 minutes we were informed our order had not been put in. We were assured we'd receive it in 20 minutes. After 30 minutes we left without our dinner. It never arrived."}
{"text":"Placed an order for delivery on 12/23 at 4:15 .... it's Monday 9:03 pm and still haven't received it. Won't go through the hassle of telling you nobody knew anything about the whereabouts of my pizza...just know it doesn't take 45 minutes for your pizza to cook it seems it takes around 100 hours...still hoping dinner comes tomorrow..."}
{"text":"This is a tough one to review. We went on a Wednesday afternoon at 3:30pm to avoid the crowds, and yet the parking lot was completely full. Imagine my surprise to see the restaurant was less than half full. Where are the other half of the customers supposed to park?  Like most Chicago deep dish, expect a 40 minute wait AFTER you've placed your order. These thick pizzas need a lot of time to cook.  We ordered a small deep dish with pepperoni and mushroom and two sodas.  Now, I've reviewed a lot of pizza places in my time, but this will be the first time I have ever said this: There was too much cheese and not enough sauce.  The crust was the best part of the pizza. It reminds me of an apple pie crust, but thicker and not as sugary. Very dry and very light and flaky. If I could put Mulnatni's cheese and sauce on Giordano's crust, that would be a heckuva pie!  I do like that the deep dish crust is THIN. I hate when a deep dish pizza has too much bread. This is like a regular crust pizza, in a pan, with the toppings and cheese and then the sauce on top.  The sauce and the cheese were practically tasteless. Not bad, but not tasty. There was way too much cheese. Yeah, I said it. Do NOT order extra cheese unless you want to become lactose intolerant! Sometimes less is more. You can't make up for flavor by just throwing more cheese on it.   People 'ooh' and 'ahh' at the cheese pull. While it looks impressive, it doesn't taste impressive.  The pepperoni were good and the mushrooms were fresh, but there wasn't enough of them added to the pile of cheese they were buried in.  Prices were similar to Mulnati's, but I have to say I prefer Mulnati's sauce and cheese (flavor and quantity.)  That being said, I didn't hate the place but it didn't live up to the hype, whereas Mulnati's did.  Now that Gino's East will opening up soon, I'll have to see where it sits between these two famous Chicago pizzerias next.  The staff were friendly and helpful.  The restrooms have these weird Dyson faucets that have hand dryers built into the faucet. Yes, you read that right! The hand dryers are built into the faucets. This is neat, but completely impractical. While drying your hands, the blowers are so loud my ears are STILL RINGING! And if you move your hands too close to each other, the faucet turns back on and makes them wet again, requiring the drying process start all over. And the hand dryer blows so hard, it splashes the water puddling in the sink back on to you. What a waste of money they invested for that nonsense. But I wasn't here to review the restroom."}
{"text":"I'll give it a little while before trying the restaurant, but will be ordering take out again soon  Ordered a half Special half Chicago classic which they said would take 45 mins, and an email confirmation stated the time for pick up which was accurate.    2nd time ordering take out ...got a cheese, and a veggie deep dish.    Once again: Cant complain, pizza was great.  3.5 Stars"}
{"text":"Just visited for the first time with the family yesterday and we all loved it. Suggest ordering an app to hold you over. The pizza took about 45m to cook but was well worth every minute. Our waiter was terrific and the manager Vicky checked on us a couple of times while we were dining. She also shared the best way to reheat the leftover deep dish. We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"New place.  Seated near the bar in a booth so there was always someone passing by to give me updates on the food and keep my drink filled.  Because it's such a deep dish pizza, you're not going to get it in five minutes.  Give yourself some time to hang out while it cooks (I ordered wings, which were good, to hold me over until the pizza was ready).  I could eat two pieces  and took the rest home because there's so much.  I actually laughed when I picked up the box because it was so heavy.  (It warms up delicious too!)."}
{"text":"If I had two more hands I would give it \"Four Thumbs Down\"  They should change their name because this is an Embarrassment to a Chicago Classic.  I have been living in Chicago and dining at Giordanos since I was a child.  35+ years later I moved out to Arizona after retiring and to my surprise seen that they had a Giordanos pizza. Needless to say that I had to stop by there withe the family since they had never heard of the place.  THE PIZZA WAS GUMMY ON THE BOTTOM AND LACKED FLAVOR. Ok I said every one makes mistake I had them re-fire it GUMMY THE SECOND TIME TOO. Almost like raw dough.   I gave them a second try  About a month later I ordered ahead arrived there to have another gummy un cooked pizza. To top it off It didn't taste good AGAIN. I took a frozen heart togo and made it in the oven it was good and the next day the left overs were amazing somehow.   Last week I went back to Chicago and dined at Giordanos with my family to give them a true experience and we Absolutely loved it.   I really wish that the owners of the original Giordanos would take a visit to Peoria and see how they are Ruining an amazing creation. I beg that the people highest up on the chain sneak in and try they pizza because it disgusting and making everyone who stood behind Giordanos for year seem like Idiots for praising it so much.    The Customer service was awesome the bartender was awesome the restaurant was clean and looked awesome."}
{"text":"It was good, but way too pricey for what you get.  I love supporting the mom and pop places and the prices are more reasonable."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Weezer - Say It Ain't So)  Oh yeah Alright Somebody's restaurant Is stuffing my pizza Somebody's stuff crust Is giving me chills Guess I'll just write my Yelp  Oh yeah, alright Foods good, inside  Slip in my belly Wrestle with cheesy So much is filling In this pizza pie And Bo Bites is ready to go  Gi-or-da-nos.... Your food is a mouth-fillery Gi-or-da-nos.... My Yelp is a song singer   Giordanos seems to have the love of native Chicagoans around the valley.  They are known for the stuffed pizza and pastas.  To be honest, it's pizza on top of a pizza with a stuff mozzarella crust; which was first introduced to me by Pizza Hut unfortunately.  I came here on a birthday party and I've heard such great things about this place.  My buddy, whom is a Chicagoan, gave me a breakdown and story of Giordanos and the history of pizza from Chicago.  Interesting I would say and I can appreciate the story and love of the hometown food.  Like mothers' home cooked meals!  Anyways, I get it, but what's hard as an outsider is discovering what makes this dish worth raving about; as I have stated it's pizza upon a pizza, pizza pie to say.  We ordered their Meat And More Meat topping and yes, indeed it was a lot of meat, crust, and cheese.  As a person, who can tolerate extreme diets; this can be put in that category.  Meaning do I really need to eat this much!? If it's your jam then by all means.  If stuffing your face makes you happy hey go for it!  The pizza has a hard crust, while the meat added a slight saltiness.  The marinara had chunks of tomato which help soften the crust.  Needless to say, I had two slices and I was full as funk!    In the end, I get it.  I'm not here to knock anybody's love of the Chicago food scene and appreciate it more than me.  However for me it's like eating a meat pie. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place started on the wrong foot because the cook dropped out pizza that took roughly 40min to make. However the manager made sure that we were well taken care of and more than made up for that mistake. We got another pizza made and it was AMAZING. I suggest the deep dish pizza. I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"We have always wanted to try this place since they moved in and today was the day. SBL and mini me thought we could go there for lunch before we watched a matinee of Oceans 8.   Side note: O8 wasn't all we hoped for. Underwhelming and a bit slow. Loved the girl power and watching all of them work together, but to me it just didn't compare to the Clooney or the Pitt, meh.  This joint was super cool inside and we had a very nice server. For starters the guys ordered the sampler platter which came with boneless chicken blops, cheesy garlic bread and bruschetta. Mini me inhaled the chicken, SBL liked the cheesy bread, but some of the cheese wasn't all the way melted and it was grainy so it made you occasionally shiver from the tartness. I'm not sure why he kept eating it:/ I did like the bruschetta very much though.  I got a side Cesar salad and two bites in I stopped eating it because it tasted so funky. I told the server it was whak and the manager came right over. She was very nice about it, took it off our bill and wanted to make it up to me. I told her it was just a salad and we told for the next person so they don't have the same experience. She was a very genuine and you could tell she was concerned, go girl.  For the main meal we ordered an individual deep dish with sausage, a thin crust personal pizza with sausage and the lasagna with meat sauce. The mini deep dish wasn't anything to brag about and SBL said it was just ok. Mini me was quiet so we knew he was happy with his thin crust. My lasagna was decent. It was bloppy and the noodles were over cooked; again it was just ok.  I felt like today was a learning experience, but an expensive one. Lunch was around $70 with tip yikes!  Yes, we ordered an appetizer so we were expecting to pay a bit more, but we were obviously hoping for better taste and more love on our plates.   Probably not gonna go back there again, that don't impress me much...now that Shania Twain song is in my head, and you're welcome;)   Oh Giordanos, Insert mediocre sigh here."}
{"text":"I have to start off by saying I've never been to Chicago so I can't compare it to anything super authentic. However, I loved it. Other than the wait, the food was fresh, tasty, flavorful, and the service was stellar!    We had a deep dish with pepperoni, sausage, and mushroom. Wouldn't have minded a bit more sausage but what was on there was tasty. To be honest. Next time we may just do a cheese pizza. The sauce was perfect. Not too sweet like at many pizza joints!    It's kinda nice to actually have a place like this on the west side!"}
{"text":"Amazing deep dish pizza!! This was our first time here and we absolutely loved it! We ordered the deep dish pepperoni,  sausage,  and mushroom and it was perfection! The sauce and crust are so tasty and they are really generous with the cheese.  The Manager,  Vicki, stopped by to see how everything was and she was so friendly and really cares about the customers.  Our server,  Jason, was incredible and we never wanted for a thing! We'll be back with our whole family for sure.  Yummmm!"}
{"text":"I have visited the location since my first review and I am happy to report that valet service is available...the wait staff has much improved and the food quality is very good.  I was very sad that a great Chicago tradition of great food and and service was not prevalent at the new Arizona location. But with time things have changed and I am very happy it is in our neighborhood. My previous comment below from my first visit was spot on.   I know the Giordano's brand and what they stand for being from Chicago. I have a feeling this restaurant once established will be in the valley to stay. Please pick the right time to dine in early and late to elevate a long wait and you will enjoy your visit.  Great job Giordano's team."}
{"text":"Second time we've been there. And honestly still needs a ton of work on service. The first time was awful we left after sitting at the table for over 20 mins before anyone would even look at us. That was months ago. It took me this long to give it another chance. Tonight was better, but still not great. Waited forever when we were finished eating. The energy and effort there is just really sub par. The pizza was good not great. Not sure if we will come back. There are way too many pizza places to choose from."}
{"text":"The best I can say is meh. I am trying to be nice as they had issues with their oven that day and were forced to close from 1pm to 5pm. We got seated pretty promptly and it went downhill from there.   Our waiter took quite a while to finally acknowledge our presence. We ordered the bruschetta, a deep dish pizza, iced tea (no lemon), & water (no lemon). The waiter repeated all of this back to us. He brought back our drinks WITH lemons and no ice. Then proceeded to argue with us as to how we ordered our drinks. Then he compounded the problem by going to the corner station, removing the lemons, adding ice, and serving them to us again. I realize some of you are thinking this guy is nitpicking, but imagine he effect if someone was allergic.  We decided to add the garlic/parmesan fries. Our appetizers came out quickly and if the I was judging strictly on the fries, I would have been rating them at 5 stars. The Bruschetta was good, but the bread it was on could not in any way be called garlic toast. The very fresh diced tomatoes and fresh mozzarella were excellent, but the not quite toast became very soggy.  We ordered the pesto chicken, mushrooms, & black olives on our deep dish. The pizza arrived in about 30 minutes which we thought was pretty good. The good part: crust had a nice texture/taste, and they did not scrimp on the cheese which was top-notch. The bad: the sauce was very generic and bland. What we got of the 'toppings' was great, but was extremely skimpy.  There was lots of extra tomatoes on the bruschetta which we added to the fries and the pizza. It complimented both very well.   The atmosphere could only be catagorized as a cacophony. Something resembling sound dampening would have been a nice addition.  We did have a ton of leftover pizza, but I am not really looking forward that much to the leftovers.  Overall, my rating would have been closer to 2.5 stars. It really didn't rate $50 with tip."}
{"text":"We went here on a Friday night expecting it to be busy but surprisingly we were seated right away! We found out soon after why it wasn't busy at all.  We were seated right in the hall where the servers rushed through to bring food to people. That usually wouldn't annoy me but one of the servers must have forgot to wear deodorant tonight which was the opposite of appetizing. Come to find out, he just happened to be our server!  Not only did our waiter not practice good hygiene, he also provided some of the worst customer service I have ever experienced. When he brought us our food and drinks he just dropped it off on his way to the next table in a constant rush. He never checked on us once. He never even introduced himself, and we didn't even know he was our waiter until the very end.  As far as the food, too many toppings on the pizza. It seemed like it was frozen and defrosted on our plate. A watery soggy mess of vegetables and cardboard like crust. The salad was ok.  To top it all off, we realized they had snuck pepperoni in our veggie pizza. I have been a vegetarian for a long time and usually it doesn't bug me when this happens, but our waiter seemed angry that I even brought it up! Unfortunately since we weren't willing to wait another hour for them to remake our pizza we left disappointed with half of a side salad in our stomachs. Booo.  Save yourself the headache and stay away!"}
{"text":"I'll start this by saying I'm not a fan of deep dish pizza. I like my pizza thin and foldable so I have put off coming here because why....... Anyhow ended up here last night wanting to please the lady.  The place is nice.  It's a whole different store than it used to be. (It used to be a Corner Bakery) I like what they've done to the place.  It's nice and the the seating is great. Huge booth!!! Ordered the Classic deep dish and a chopped salad to share.  Since it's a 45 min wait for the pie, had a couple draft beers and enjoyed my company  The pie arrived and it was exactly what I thought it was going to be.  A huge deep pit of red sauce surrounded by dough  After being served a piece, my thoughts changed slightly.  After taking my first bite, my thoughts changed completely.   This pizza is really good. Great mix of cheese and meats and onions and peppers.  Just a right amount of red sauce on the top  If you're on the fence about a deep dish pizza, give this place a shot. It might change your mind"}
{"text":"I am very happy to see Giordanos finall6 come to the valley and looking forward to a location in Scottsdale in the next 2 yrs... I  loved the Pizza, my friends that I took for their 1st experience loved it... it was busy but didn't mind the wait. .. we had app platter which was great. ... pizza awesome. .. I  do recommend if you have a 20 min wait for example place an order when you get there ofv you know what you want to cut on wait time after you are seated....  Good service. Very friendly. ... obviously being a new place expect growing pains. ... they do deliver. . I  do hooe they will get another pizza oven to help with the flow"}
{"text":"Wow!!!!!  Giordano's is my favorite Chicago area pizza.  I was a little worried getting it in Arizona would not be as good.  Well, it is BETTER here!!!!  We had the calamari appetizer which was great and a stuffed pizza with spinach and sausage which was fresh and delicious! The manager (I think) Vicki stopped by our table a few times and asked us how everything was.  She was really friendly and pleasant.  Our waitress was also great.  The decor and ambience was fun too! 5 stars for sure!! Enjoy!!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Giordano's pizza. The cheese and sauce on all of their pizzas are amazing. So many flavors that blend together perfectly. The restaurant has a great feel and is always full of gappy customers. I was really happy with the drink menu and service when I was there recently. I had a great time waiting for my food that it seemed like no time had passed."}
{"text":"We just got back from the restaurant and I had to write a review.  This was my first time trying stuffed deep dish pizza and for me was a disappointment.  We were told it would be 35-45 minutes to prepare which was fine as we wanted to try something new.  We order a stuffed pizza and sampler appetizer.  The sampler appetizer was delicious.  The pizza sad to say was an hour and half from the time ordered to the table.  That is just ridiculous.  The staff also were stressed out and they switched servers on us in the middle of our visit. We asked the new server why and she said it was shift change.  We later asked the original server and she did not want to go and said something about they do not want the labor.  The place was packed standing room only, did not want the labor?  Bad management. As for the pizza I love deep dish pizza but the stuffed deep dish pizza was really just a large hunk of cheese with minimal pizza sauce and minimal pepperoni, very disappointing, but maybe not just my style.  So anyway long wait, no parking, pizza lost?, staff confused/stressed, awesome appetizer, pizza really just a large chunk of cheese and I will not be returning anytime soon.  I will wait a year and give them a try again."}
{"text":"Amazingly Delicious!!!! Visiting from Chicago and felt like some chicago style pizza.  As ALWAYS Giordanos delivers.   Great job keeping your national franchises up to par."}
{"text":"I would say that this is my 2nd favorite Chicago pizza in the area. Having been back to Chicago and sampled Giordanos, Gino's East and Lou Malnatis, this is decent pizza. I am more of a fan of New York style pizza but I am definitely a fan of pizza toppings. Only downside to this and most deep dish pizza places is that it takes forever to make so make sure you have some time to spend waiting."}
{"text":"Terrible. Get to the location and get a seat instantly, awesome! However it was cramped and wasn't able to pull out a hair to sit without bumping into the person behind me in the next table. We sat at the table for 10 minutes waiting for the server to come and talk with us. A guy finally comes in rush asking for what we need. My husband orders a Pepsi and I get iced tea. We also order French fries. Then the waiter walks away. Who was my waiter? What's his name? I couldn't tell you because he didn't really have the customer service skill, in my opinion. He said he'd be back shortly with the drinks and take our order. It took another 10 minutes to get the drinks, even though we were sitting right next to the station. He dropped them off and left. He even got that wrong. He gave us 2 Pepsi's and I couldn't ask for tea because he wasn't around. Finally a girl came from the kitchen and gave us our fries. At that point I asked for the correct drink. Anyways after 35 minutes of waiting, needless to say we never order an entree.  Place seemed severely under staffed, maybe if they had more people it be better. But who knows I won't be back   Pros: The Pepsi was good, so said my husband   Cons: Everything else."}
{"text":"My husband (from Chicago) and I went to Giordano's on Monday 12/26/16 at 3:00pm. The restaurant was full but there was no wait. We were excited and looking forward to eating great pizza. Our server started off our dining experience by telling us how tired he was. He said he worked two jobs and this was his second job. He did not tell us anything about the restaurant or make any menu recommendations or tell us how long it would take if we ordered a deep dish pizza. Knowing it would probably take a little longer we decided to order a thin crust pizza. We ordered a medium with sausage, mushroom, bell pepper and onion.The pizza was just ok and it did not live up to the hype or the price. The best part was the cheese. The other toppings were sparse. The crust was tough and it tasted  like it had been pre-baked ahead of time and held.  Our server gave us our check, completed the payment transaction and could not utter a thank you! We spent $34 with tip for a medium pizza, water and ice tea. There is better pizza in town. We won't be back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza. The pizza takes time to cook. Don't expect to come right in and eat. Oh man, is it worth the wait."}
{"text":"Good Chicago Deep Dish Pizza. Glad to see all the top Chicago Pizza Restaurants coming to Phoenix. We had great service with the typical 30 to 45 min wait for a deep dish pizza. If you like extra cheese on your pizza this is the place. A little too much cheese for me but the pepperoni and sausage pizza was still good -  would recommend getting extra sauce as it was lacking a little. They have a large patio also to enjoy the great Phoenix weather. Would recommend if you are in the Arrowhead area."}
{"text":"Went to Giordanos on a Sunday afternoon. We went early, because I heard that it can get pretty busy.   My first thought was that the inside looked really nice, but it also looked very small.   Aside from the size of the restaurant, everything else was great for us. We ordered a deep dish pie and was told it'd take about an hour to come out. We completely understood though. We are aware that deep dish pizza takes longer to cook. We anticipated the wait time.   You could definitely tell that the staff was new and possibly not too experienced. We had two other waiters try to drop someone else's food at our table.   After about 40 minutes of waiting, our pizza arrived. We were quite pleased at the wait time for the pizza.  The pizza was just as I remembered it from when I would visit Chicago. Absolutely delicious!  Our waitress was great.   I can see where improvements could be made, but I absolutely think they will be worked out with time.  We will definitely be back when we are on this side of town!"}
{"text":"Was given a gift card to come back and try this place again so we tried the Italian Beef sandwiches.   They were really good.  Still a little disappointed, the fries were lukewarm, which was one of the same issues as before was the food temp.  However they were still good and the fact that they tried to bring us back says more about them than most places and we will be back."}
{"text":"Went there last Friday 12/23/16 to celebrate my Mom's birthday. She used to live in Chicago and loved Giordano's there. The place was busy and we placed an order with the hostess for a large deep dish while we waited. We were seated 1 and a half hours later. Waited at the table for another hour. No pizza. Waited and waited, no pizza. We eventually left heartbroken. I understand the place is busy and deep dishes take time, but come on, over 2 hours and you can't make a pizza? Give me a break!  Maybe I'll go back during the week when they aren't so busy."}
{"text":"Took the family to the latest pizza establishment to come to town.  I have to rate Giordano's three stars largely due to the quality of the pizza.  Everything else about the experience was only 1 - 2 stars.    We stopped by on a Wednesday afternoon at 1:30pm to avoid the rush and largely that was a good decision.  As mentioned in other comments the service and wait has room for improvement.    In order to have the ultimate experience we ordered the Meat and More Meat stuffed pizza.  The menu said expect a 35 - 45 minute wait so no surprises.  After 60 minutes our pizza arrived and it was delicious.   I enjoyed a cold slice the next day and it didn't disappoint.     Our server was slow to arrive, kept falling behind on refreshing our drinks and was slow to bring our bill.  The table next to us wasn't doing much better - who knows maybe they are still there?  1:45 from beginning to end.  I expect 2 hours if you arrive at around noon.  I feel sorry for folks who have to wait in line before being seated.    Go for the pizza but don't expect much else.    I'm not from Chicago and don't have friends from Chicago so more than likely won't be going back anytime soon but I might be tempted to try one of their sandwiches."}
{"text":"We went to Giordanos for dinner the other night and really enjoyed it. We got there pretty early so there was no wait and we were seated promptly. I had signed up for their email club so I received a coupon for a free appetizer. We opted for the Bruschetta and it was amazing. Four pieces came topped with big chunks of mozzarella cheese and then covered high with chopped tomatoes, bits of basil, and drizzled with balsamic vinegar. There were so many tomatoes that we ended up saving them to put on our pizza. It is definitely something I would order again. I opted for the Spinach, Artichoke, and Feta thin crust pizza. It came piping hot and tasted soooo good. The leftover bruschetta topping paired well with the outer edges (where the toppings were a little more sparse).  Hubby ordered the individual sized Italian Beef deep dish pizza. It came with his choice of a side item and he opted for the garlic Parmesan french fries. His pizza was really good and had a perfect balance between the sweet peppers and the hot peppers. It came with a side of au jus to dip in. His french fries were perfectly crispy and did not skimp on the garlic and Parmesan. They were served with a side of ranch dressing. We were so full that we ended up taking quite a bit home with us but could not resist ordering some cannolis to take home. They were decadent as they were made with real ricotta cheese which is extremely rare these days. Service was good and we both agreed that we are really glad they opened up on our side of town. Can't wait to visit again to try their salads and pasta!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time on October 23. I had the meatball sandwich and she had the chicken parm dinner. Food and service were very good. Will be back!"}
{"text":"When giordanos arrived in arizona,  I can't even explain the excitement I had that my favorite chicago pizza place was finally driving distance for me now that I live in arizona! I have been to giordanos many times in Chicago and it's always been a long wait but amazing pizza.  So even though this new location in Peoria is an hour from where I live,  I knew it was completely worth the wait.  But I'm really really sad to say that I had unpleasant experiences. My first time was not good but I still had hope so I came again and it was not good again.   First off, the parking situation is not good.  There is very limited parking and it takes a long time to find a spot where you won't get towed.  Second of all, the first time I went about one month ago on a Friday evening at 5pm it was a 2 hour wait. The second visit was better in that there was no wait to be seated but it's because I went at 4pm on a Friday instead.   Third of all, during my most recent visit today, we were told it was going to be a 35-45 min wait for pizza which ended up actually taking 1.5 hours. My first visit a month ago we were told the pizza would take 1.5 hours to make but it ended up taking almost 2.5 hours to make.   Fourth of all, the service was the worst, most intolerable part. At my first visit, the server ended up dropping one of my 2 leftover pieces of pizza as he was boxing it up and then asked \"did you still want it?\" Which is absolutely DISGUSTING so of course I said no and the server did not even apologize for dropping the pizza nor did he compensate me for the loss.  One piece of pizza might not seem like alot,  but at a place like this where one piece is really filling and the pizzas are a decent price,  one piece lost out of 2 leftover pieces is a big deal.  Then,  at my second visit,  we were brought the wrong pizza by one server who insisted that the pizza should've went to our table and then our server came over after we told her it was wrong and said \"oh I saw her bringing it over to you guys and I knew it was wrong but I could tell you guys were going to say something so I just let you guys do it.\" How strange to say this to us! He should've definitely let the other server know instead of us as well.  We also only asked our server for one thing after finally getting our pizza, which was ranch, and our server completely forgot to bring it out after saying he was going to and I didn't even get a chance to remind him because the next time he came back,  we were finished eating so all he asked was if we needed a box.  He never came to check on us to see how the food was at all during the meal. So I never even got a chance to inform him of not only the missing ranch,  but also the curly black stand of hair I also found in my slice of pizza. Also, after we finished eating and boxed up our leftovers, the server took an additional 20-30 minutes to finally bring us the bill and then took an additional 20 mins to pick up the check in order to charge us.   Plus sides: the pizza is always delicious, the garlic fries and cesear salad is delicious, bathrooms are nice, and I like the ambiance  Negatives: service is very poor and the servers really need to know the importance of checking in often with customers and apologizing to customers in order to make things right; parking is very limited; wait times to sit are very long at dinner;  wait times to get your pizza take a very long time and they are always way underestimated in their time waits as well.   I absolutely love giordanos pizza so I really hope this location will be able to make adjustments to improve, especially in their service. I understand that the location is still fairly new so they are busy which means long wait times,  but being that giordanos is SUCH a popular pizza place in Chicago,  I thought this location would've been prepared to have a large restaurant, a large planned out parking lot, and numerous large ovens to accommodate many guests so that was a little disappointing to find out I was wrong.  That, and this poor of service is just inexcusable."}
{"text":"Let me first start this review by saying I'm a Chicago native. Born in the city and raised in the 'burbs. I've eaten, at least, 100 pizzas at the various Giordano's restaurants in the Chicago area; all of them a stuffed deep dish pizza. Giordano's used to be my all-time favorite pizza, up until about 12 years ago, or so, when they changed. This was just before their bankruptcy.  When they came to the Phoenix area, I was excited, hoping they had rebounded back to their previous glory. Peoria is an hour's drive from me, but we went there the month they opened, as I had to try them. The pizza was not great, but there was hope, as they had just opened and all restaurants have a shaky start when they first open.   So, we gave them the better part of a year and tried them again a couple nights ago. Sadly, the pizza was even worse than it was before. The crust was dry and bland, unlike how it used to be. The amount of sauce looked as though someone brushed it on, you could see the top layer of crust. The amount of ingredients (sausage) were also low. If you like a lot of cheese sandwiched between two layers of bland crust, brushed with a light coating of sauce, you might like this.  I want to like their pizza, as I miss the old Giordano's taste. Unfortunately, I fear they're gone forever, replaced by this pathetic version of what was once the best pizza ever."}
{"text":"Just left due to sitting at our table for 15 minutes with no server who came by. Disappointing, I guess they have enough repeat business and gaining new customers is not a priority! Heading to Mod Pizza down the street!"}
{"text":"Okay I have to say I am not a deep dish pizza lover. I'm from Brooklyn and I prefer my pizzas to be thin but I have to say as far as Chicago style it was good not fantastic not great but good.  But I have to say the absolute best thing about this place is the service our girl Amanda is fantastic I highly recommend her if you come here and you like the deep dish style pizza ask for her but it appears all of the wait staff here is great."}
{"text":"Food is not bad. The deep dish pizza was not hot  and a little warm on the inside. I do like that it is very cheesy. I wish the pizza would have been hotter. The plates at the table were not clean so I had the waitress replace them. The next plates she gave were wet but we used them anyway. I prefer clean and dry plates. Calimari was pretty good. Bruschetta was too thick and tomatoes fall all over the place. Hot wings were good. I didn't want to complain too much and just ate the food. I might go back. I just hope things will be better."}
{"text":"Exceptional calamari!  My husband was very excited to visit his favorite pizza place now in Phoenix. Arrived at 4:30 and had to wait 30 to 45 minutes to be seated which it was reasonable. As soon as we were seated we knew what we wanted to order, we were told 1:30 hours would be the wait time for a deep pizza. Ordered an appetizer and then we asked for refill of our drinks and took too long. 45 minutes without refill. Server would keep apologizing but not even looking at the empty glass. No supervisor on the floor. And when food finally arrived 3 hours latter  it was not even how we ordered it, we had to take it or wait again if we send it back. That is unacceptable even with the delicious food they serve.  We understand it is week of opening and also a holiday so we will be back in few weeks hoping they can improve their system."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I can't have pizza without buffalo wing sauce. To me they have to go together or else I don't enjoy the pizza. Well the only buffalo sauce they have tasted really mild so unfortunately  that kind of threw it off for me. Don't get me wrong the pizza and wings are good but just not great in my opinion. Also the crust was crunchy which i was not expecting. The service was excellent though and you can't skip out on their triangle cheese sticks so good!"}
{"text":"Wow.  I can't even make this up.  I'm not one to blame an individual and in this case can't tell if it's human error or computer error.  I attempted to place an order online at 8:23pm. My first item I couldn't change the kids menu thin crust pizza topping from pepperoni to Italian sausage so I located the phone number and called in a carry-out. Time is now, 8:35pm. That transaction went incredibly smooth and I can appreciate Dominique's phone etiquette. At the end my order was replicated and I was told 9:05pm-9:20pm will be pick up.  Sweet!  Was greeted by a gentleman at the conveniently located Carry Out register. We checked out and was informed it should be, \"right out\" as it was 9:12pm I knew we had at least 8 minutes more we had to wait. I wasn't worried.  ... 19 minutes later we asked the same gentleman how much longer. He replied with an uncertain, \"uh, I'm going to go check on it\" as he snatched the receipt hanging and heads to the kitchen. It has been an hour since I called in my order. The gentleman returns wth another lady, the receipt and as she calls out my name, I know it isn't good. She never introduces herself so I couldn't tell you her name, as far as I knew, she was a customer from a table that volunteered to do the dirty work.  Now as a customer please don't apologize to me, tell me what I need to know and don't bother trying to explain some ways of your business communication because honestly it does me no good.. She starts with our food didn't get sent back to the kitchen. I said, \"what?\" Not angrily, just confused. She apologized and continued on about how our food wasn't sent to the kitchen by some communication error. Ugh! This is sucky. Broken down simply; our pizza part of the order did not get sent to where it needed to go. That was 2 out of the 7 people that didn't get to try out Giordano's for the first time.  She kept apologizing and repeated about the order not being sent. It wasn't forwarding at all. I just wanted to go. She said that she would comp our food and offered additional frozen pizza we could take and enjoy at home. I said fine, at least the kids will have their food and the pizza takes about an hour to bake; so we would enjoy that at a later date.  Coming home and getting everything out of the bags, yes bags and they were huge; for no reason whatsoever. Oversized bags held one frozen pizza in one bag, our cannoli order with 3 Sierra Mist in another and two spaghetti with one order of chicken tenders. Welp, looks like one child will have to eat something else because they forgot the other order of tenders. Luckily they sent me home with my side of marinara I was going to enjoy my Italian Beef deep dish with. Thanks  The oldest didn't like the way the chicken tenders looked so she let her little sister eat them.  On to the food we did receive. The meatball tasted heated up from the microwave. The pasta was cooked well. The tenders, although as aforementioned, didn't look too appealing they were juicy.  So here I am, writing this review while I eat my tacos damn near two hours later. All that time wasted running back home to feed the family and going back out to feed the ones from somewhere else.  All in all, I look forward to enjoying that Italian beef Deep dish one day. Just won't rave about this place and will definitely deter people from calling for carry out."}
{"text":"So we came here for my nephew's 25 surprise birthday party. There were a LOT of us, probably 35 or more including a half dozen under age 10. Big family plus friends. We pretty much took over the whole back patio and were waited on by the super awesome Ebony and Mango (yes, their real names, and they were amazing). These poor ladies not only had almost 2 score people on the patio, with at least 8 separate checks, but had tables inside as well. Yes, they had help from food runners, bussers, and a very competent manager, but they did the brunt of the work. They did it extremely well.  The whole scene was chaos, with people arriving at different times and trying to find seats while saying hello to everyone. The entire time, Ebony and Mango were on top of drinks, appetizers, pre-orders, split up family checks, you name it. Refills, add-ons, \"oh, can I get a whatever\"! On. The. Ball.  The food was really, really good! Go for the garlic cheese bread. I got the Italian beef sandwich and was blown away. I tried several different versions of their pizza and was never disappointed. I even stole a bite of my niece's spaghetti when she wasn't looking and was impressed. I wish I had room for dessert! Look, I've had lots of Italian food in my life. Good Italian food isn't that hard to find if you are diligent and know where to look. I've worked in 4 different Italian places over the last 30 years. What I haven't found is a place that could accommodate 35-40 people all coming in at different times, at least 8 maybe 10 separate checks, and provide such an excellent experience. Kudos to your extraordinary team! Special thanks to Ebony and Mango! You were the best! I sincerely hope everyone tipped you like crazy because you deserved it!  Get the garlic cheese bread!"}
{"text":"Not impressed.  Deep dish bottom crust was uncooked.  Waited along time before being waited on.  Price for small deep dish $35.00. Could have purchased a really good pizza from Dominos at a third of the cost Will we return.  NO"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Giordano's and it was greatly anticipated.  Originally from the Midwest and as a lover of Chicago pizza, I was ecstatic to hear of them opening in Arizona.  We went on a Saturday around 4 and were immediately seated in a large cozy booth. Ordering was quick and painless and we were well aware the pizza generally takes around 45 minutes to cook so we weren't surprised with wait time.  We ordered a couple of craft beers regardless of the selection being a little slim.  The more we waited, the more people started piling in so I recommend going earlier than later.   The pizza arrived and I was ready to dive in!  There was a lot more cheese in the pizza than anticipated which made it extremely filling.  The crust was just ok, I wasn't blown away but it was nice and crispy. All in all, I don't know if I would return as I didn't find it anything spectacular but it was tasty."}
{"text":"Took a little while to write this review because I didn't get to try the food since the restaurant decided to close earlier then their recording said.   I came into town for the Christmas holiday and went to the restaurant on December 24, at 4:30 pm. We went into the restaurant with a party of 7 and we're told that they were closing at 6pm so there was no way we would get served. We explained that we called and the recording said they would be open until 9pm and the hostess said that since they were new they decided to close early. Nice way to start off a new location in a new town.   Biggest disappointment was that I really was looking forward to their stuffed pie. What I thought was really bad though is when you call the restaurant and they are open, no one answered the phone to save me the drive to let me know they were closing early.   Hopefully they get better with their customer relations because I got one wasted my time and that of my guests going there and that won't happen again.   I would have loved to write a review of their pizza but can't. We did go for Chicago Style pizza, since that's what everyone wanted, and where we ended up was great."}
{"text":"Pizza is great but do not come here unless you are okay with waiting an hour after you order."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place since I'm from Chicago, and will NEVER step foot in there again!  Waited 1 hour and 6 minutes only to find out they gave our pizza to the group behind us!"}
{"text":"NOT GOOD. Service was awful, food was awful, disgrace to call this place Chicago style pizza. Manager had no idea what was going on, servers had zero experience or just didn't care. Almost every table around us was having the same issues. Maybe because they are new, but i've been in hospitality 15 years and this was just sad."}
{"text":"Deep dish deeeelicous. I picked mine up. Order early depending on day and time. Pizza takes awhile to cook. Since this was my first order, I just got plain cheese deep dish. Wanted to get real taste of pie. Got a small, which is a nice size for two people $15.00. If restaurant stays open I will be a regular.  PS Way better than Lou Maldonado's just my opinion, I will never get a deep dish from them again."}
{"text":"Good Italian beef considering this is a pizza place and Im from Chicago.  The pizza is pretty good too. Still nothing compares to pizza and beefs from Chicago. Its in the water!! :)"}
{"text":"Loved it! We have been to Giordanos in Chicago several times and it has become one of my favorite pizza restaurants! This place didn't fail my expectations. Service was excellent and they went out of their way to accommodate us. Food was great as expected! We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"I didn't want to do this but, the service was that terrible. When we walked in the door there was a slew of people and not a hostess to be found (all of these people including us were just waiting to be acknowledged). When we finally sat down our server seemed nice enough and we ordered our pizza and drinks. The entire wait staff looked like chickens with their heads cut off. We knew the pizza took about 45 minutes. Ours took about an hour to come. When the pizza did arrive - we were not given plates or silverware and the person who dropped it off ran away so quickly that we couldn't even ask. Also, this plate and silverware shortage was happening to all the tables around us. I finally asked someone cleaning a table who told me they had to finish cleaning the table before they could get it.... they could barely handle the tables they had in there I don't think stopping to get us utensils and plates would have been out of the question. I finally got up and stole them off of another table because I was so sick of waiting. My toddler starting having a meltdown so it was time to leave after one piece . I still hadn't seen my waitress since receiving the pizza. I asked another server if they could process my payment and grab me a box. My sever finally dropped off the check simply with a \"here\". No thank you, no box. I asked the other server for the box again. The pizza was good but not worth the service . I'll head to Lou's next time"}
{"text":"I mean, who doesn't love Chicago style pizza? Not the best I have ever had, but shoot, if I can get a small taste of Chicago without having to travel there myself, I am in!"}
{"text":"Came here for the deep dish of course. Showed up at the right time within 5 minutes of waiting the wait times were up to an hour. Just a heads up the deep dish pizza takes about 45 minutes so plan you time around it, we fully expected the time and it was good. The service was good with the hostess & manager (I believe) and our server started off good but fell off the pace a little bit half way through when it was ridiculously busy.   The pizza... it was good, the mozzarella and pepperoni had great flavor. The sauce was ok which is my basis for the 3 stars. The pizza was good and nothing wrong with it, it just didn't have anything that to me set it apart flavor wise."}
{"text":"Haven't been to a Giordano's in 20 years. I go back to Chicago every year, but there is a Lou's close to where I stay, so that is the pizza I usually get. Tried Giordano's and they didn't disappoint. Took 6 other people with me that never tried deep dish pizza and they all loved it. Read some reviews before going, so I knew that I would have to wait for a table (No biggie). Was told 1-1/2- 2 hours when we arrived, but we were seated in 40 minutes. Can't beat that for a Saturday night at 6 p.m. My advise..Keep bringing Chicago style restaurants to the valley. I've lived here over 10 years and haven't been impressed with what Phoenix has to offer on the west side.Especially SW"}
{"text":"Garlic Parmesan fries sound good unless they are served cold.  Took over 30 mins to get a couple of sandwiches.  The only reason I gave them 2 stars was because Jeremiah our server really was attentive and tried his best and the manager came right out and addresses these and other concerns."}
{"text":"While I never expected the same authentic experience as Chicago, I was woefully disappointed with the quality and service at Giordanos - Arrowhead location. Our appetizer of mozzarella triangles took 20 minutes to get out. This was understandable as we came at on a Friday night. Next, we waited another 30-40 minutes for our entrees (6\" deep dish cheese, 16\" crispy thin crust meat, fettuccine alfredo, and a meatball sub). Somehow our pizzas came out 15 before the pasta and sandwich. While long wait times are expected with deep dish pizza--it is unacceptable for pasta to come out 5 minutes after the pizza and the sandwich 10 minutes after that. Additionally, the \"extra crispy\" thin crust pizza was brought out with a completely raw bottom. After all of this our waiter brought out a small box for over half of our pizza and didn't even offer to assemble/box for us--a courtesy given to other patrons. Regardless of date nights or holiday busy seasons, this abysmal service was ridiculous. I will not be dining here again and I would advise others not to either."}
{"text":"Went in to dine with my family on Saturday at around 1pm. Immediately greeted and sat by what appeared to be the manager. The restaurant was about 1/3 filled and it appeared there was plenty of staff. The atmosphere felt similar to a diner, not a pizzeria.   Service was awful from the start. Manager had to grab our drink orders. They brought out the wrong appetizers. And had several different servers throughout the experience. Rarely checked on, drinks always empty, and our main server was nowhere to be found for the majority of our 1.5 hour dining experience.   I went into this restaurant with high hopes, as some of the reviews had this deep dish pizza being one of the best out there. I was thoroughly disappointed. It took 1 hour and 15 minutes to get our pizza. And after eating mediocre appetizers, I was less than satisfied with the pizza. Lou Malnati's by far trumps this place with the product they deliver to the table along with their service.   I'd steer clear of this place and eat at Oregano's or Lou's."}
{"text":"**Edit: a lot of you are saying you like Lou Malnatis better, quit being ignorant. Lou Malnati serves deep dish, they don't serve stuffed pizza. Giordanos serves stuffed pizza, no deep dish. It's like comparing apples and oranges.   If you are looking for deep dish, expecting deep dish, this place is not for you. Stuffed pizza is an entirely different animal.   I got take out from this location. I'm a big fan of Chicago stuffed pizza- and this place has exactly what I like.  The crust here is perfect, light crisp airy and buttery. No commas. The cheese had a particular characteristic of 'meltyness' and congealed much less than others that I have tried. Sauce is a little darker than a lot of other pizza sauces and has a solid umami vibe going on. The pizza reheats really, really well.   I got a large order of the spaghetti bolognese (I'm fat) and it was probably the best take out pasta I've ever had. They hit the al-dente mark just right. If you are borderline, I'd try it. What's pizza without a little pasta? My dog also likes the pizza and pasta, and is also fat.  I'll totally be back- just wish you had a location in North Scottsdale !"}
{"text":"Called for pick up after reading other reviews and crossed my fingers. I'll be! This is ONE good pizza! And I sure hope they drop into Scottsdale as mom's over on this side of the city and she's not a big fan. Thank you, you never know when you  do the take thing."}
{"text":"I wanted to try another well Chicago transplanted pizzeria.  Surprisingly, this place was not busy on a Sunday at 7 PM; which was good for us.  The restaurant offers indoor and outdoor seating, pretty good size place and appeared to be clean.  We ordered The Special deep dish and had Pepperoni added.  Once we got the pizza, it was definitely hot and the cheese was nice & stringy and the \"toppings\" were good.  For me the crust was nothing special.  I was hoping for a more buttery crust.  I wouldn't mind coming again, if someone suggested it.  The waitress was friendly and checked back regularly."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that this is our first visit to Gio's and we did not read the reviews until after we arrived.  We started our experience with being greeted and seated very promptly.  We met our server Jade and she was outstanding as well.  We decided to start with the wings and my wife had the house salad.  They both arrived shortly there after and let me tell you the Ranch dressing was out of this world!  My wife loved the salad and the blue cheese dressing and her salad as well.  Then I went for my first wing?  Yep, you guessed it the chicken was spoiled.  That really sucks because the sauce was great as well!  Next my son got the personal deep dish cheese pizza and the wife got the lasagna, me I got the entree size Italiano salad.    So let's go from worst to first.  The salad was the worst.  Way to much Vinegar in the dressing kind of ruined the salad.  The lasagne  was a good attempt but just fell short of the mark being that is one of the dishes Gio's is known for, 1 ball, 2 strikes,  now for the best.  My son and wife both lived the pizza!  So at the end of the night Gio's gets 2 stars.  Not sure we will come back or not.  However we tried.  So the day after my review of Gio's I received a message from one of the managers apologizing for the bad experience we had and asked my family and I to return and give them another chance.  The same day I received a phone call from Vicki the general manager of Gio's expressing the same message and asking my wife son and I to join her for dinner.  I agreed and we scheduled our visit for Friday evening.    We had basically the same dinner with a few minor changes, let me tell you our experience was the exact opposite of our previous experience.  The food was great!!!  The service was great!! The overall experience was outstanding!  We will definitely return.  Also I would like to correct a previous mistake.  Our server was Jay.  We had the privilege of having her help us again and between her and Vicki it was a great visit.    We will be back!!"}
{"text":"The pizza is awesome. The service is not...made an online order as I am aware it takes like an hour to make a stuffed pizza. I paid online then they asked me to pay when I arrived. So I did. And guess what? You guessed it double charged my card. Cool! So then I tell them the lady kinda fixed it gave me a void slip but money still showing processing. So that cool, no it isn't. Online they give you a time to be her. I showed up 5mins foyer they told me to be here. Waited another 15 mins for my pizza to be done. Place is empty not sure why this was such a debacle. So ya it's good but the service is junk and the people have this attitude like I should be pleased they even let me in the door.  So if you wanna wait like 2 1/2 hours for a pizza and pay for it twice this is the place for you."}
{"text":"This was my first time having stuffed pizza, and I freaking loved it! Hope this place sticks around longer than the previous restaurant that was there."}
{"text":"Update: was contacted by a manager who then handed me off to the general manager via email.  She apologized and sent us a $50 gift card to give them another shot.  We used the gift card this evening when the joint was significantly less busy - no wait to sit down.  Much better experience!!  We ordered two pizzas - a deep dish and an extra thin crust, and both were excellent! Cooked just right and both were delish.  It took 45 minutes from order to deep dish on the table.  Food was excellent, timing was satisfactory, and our waiter was top notch.  Thanks for the gift card, the lesson we learned is to stay away during peak times and the food and service gets exponentially better.     Ordered a thin crust pizza and a salad for carryout.  Time to pickup was a range of 15 minutes, we ended up waiting an additional 15 minutes beyond that range.  Nowhere to park so one of us kept driving around while the other waited inside for our meal.  Complete cluster with the carryout people there...girls didn't have a clue who was there, who had paid, who was still waiting.  Disaster.  Finally got our food and went home.  Got home to find the pizza was room temp (less than 5 min drive home) and my salad had no dressing with it.  Sigh.  Not worth going back for dressing, it is pouring outside and I'm tired of the place.  Nuked the pizza and it was...okay.  Nothing special, certainly not worth $25 or something for a medium thin crust.  Overall, ridiculous all around.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Waited what seem like forever, really about 30 minutes. Then we told they would comp an appetizer for our wait. They comped our sodas which I guess whatever. Order a deep dish meats & more meats and it was pretty good. But here is the kicker I ordered a Italian salad to go and they brought it out to me in a dish, had to tell the guy again it was to go and it was nothing but lettuce in a big bowl. I paid $6 for a half a head of lettuce. It wasn't worth but about $2. Don't order the salads there cheap. Restaurant is very small and cramped and there isn't a waiting area."}
{"text":"Well I have eaten at there restaurant in Chicago and it really compares to what we had there.  Great service and pizza.  Thank you"}
{"text":"The pizza here is definately worth the hype! We finally got a chance to go this weekend and were blown away by the quality and taste. Better than any of the pizzas we have tried since moving to AZ and filled so SO MUCH cheese. Even the crust was delicious. Nothing fancy, but just the perfect plain pizza crust that tasted like the crunchy bottom of a perfectly cooked homemade biscuit. Excellent all around. Even with the small wait, definately worth it. And our server Mike was incredibly nice and hospitable. Engaged in light conversation while we waited and didn't make us feel rushed at the end of the night when we were still finishing our slices 10 minutes before close. Would definately recommend to everyone and will be coming back for sure. :)"}
{"text":"My community ordered probably 12 of their pizzas for an event, and I got 2 pieces of the deep dish to try.  I am from Chicago, but Giordano's must not have been near where I lived innercity as I never ate it there.  But that was taken care of the other day when I ate their pizza at an event--and oh! did I ever fall in love! The pizza was just great!  So great that I am phoning in an order for a small party this Friday to bring to it.  I hope everyone loves their deep dish as much as I did...and it is made just like I had it before."}
{"text":"It seems that, as of late, practically every Chicago-based chain is moving their once-exclusive brands to the Phoenix area. With Lou Malnati's opening to much fanfare last summer, it comes as no surprise that Giordano's and Gino's East are also trying to claim their stake in our city. Hell, at this rate, why not just construct a replica of Wrigley Field and the Sears/Willis tower and rename our city \"Chicago Lite,\" since we seem incapable of creating a \"native flavor\" to call our own. It's kind of sad, really.  Anyway, after trying Malnati's a couple of times last summer and being mostly underwhelmed at their offerings, I was curious to see if one of their primary competitors, Giordano's, would be more to our liking. And after being open nine days, my girlfriend and I decided to give them a go-around and see how well their deep dish compares to what we're accustomed to.  It seems that a lot of initial reviews complain about poor service, which is probably the result of the location experiencing growing pains. Personally, we found no issues whatsoever with service. There was a 45 minute wait to be seated during peak hours on a Thursday evening. We pre-ordered our pizza while waiting outside, which took an additional hour once being seated. If you've ever had deep dish pizza before, you should understand that this is pretty much standard procedure and nothing to kick up a fuss over.  The layout of the restaurant, strangely enough, is very similar to Lou Malnati's - right down to the vintage-looking marquee sign. Only this one says \"EAT PIZZA\" instead of \"SAY CHEESE.\" Clearly, these types of places struggle in the area of creativity. The restaurant itself is rather small. We were seated in a back hallway right next to the kitchen entrance that seemed shutoff from the rest of the restaurant. It was extremely cold and was most likely not intended to be an eating area when the place was initially constructed. It was, for lack of a better term, very weird.  Of course, I was not surprised to find the usual garlic cheesebread as a starter. However, unlike Malnati's, which serves up a long slice of frenchbread that's actually decent, Giordano's bread wasn't quite as impressive. Sliced up into small/thin pieces, the parmesan was a bit overpowering. It tasted no better than something I could obtain from any chain. Not really a good sign.  For pizza, we ordered a large deep dish with pepperoni. Served on a plate rather than a deep-dish pan, the presentation is closer to what we're familiar with. The pizza is \"stuffed,\" meaning that your toppings are baked into the middle of the pie, which is then layered with tomato sauce on top - almost like icing on a cake. After a couple of slices, which is usually all a normal person can handle in one sitting, it wasn't difficult to draw up a pretty solid opinion.  We both felt that Giordano's crust slightly exceeds Malnati's in terms of both texture and taste. It's flaky and semi-flavorful, in contrast to Malnati's crust, which is crunchy, flavorless, and typically drenched in butter on request to help compensate. The downside, however, is that we didn't feel that their actual ingredients were on par with Malnati's. The sauce and cheese just seemed pretty standard, while the pepperoni didn't really seem to pack much of a punch - almost like it wasn't even there. It's almost as if Giordano's was the polar opposite of what we experienced at Malnati's. Rather than high quality toppings with lackluster crust, we were presented with fairly decent crust and weak toppings. On the plus side, the pizza felt less \"heavy\" on the stomach and felt like something that we could probably eat more regularly than Lou's, without wreaking havoc on our digestive tracts.  Overall, I do feel that Giordano's pizza is a tad better than Malnati's, which I largely attribute to having a better crust. But in the end, we still didn't feel that it was anything mind-blowing or knee-buckling. If you know where to look in terms of local businesses, there are still better options available if you're in the mood for a deep dish pie.  Most Chicago natives will probably be very happy to see yet another one of their city's staples open up in Phoenix. But in a city that is absolutely blanketed with incredible locally-owned pizzerias, I don't really see Giordano's as being anything special."}
{"text":"I heard that the reviews were not good when they first opened. I have been to giordanos many times in Chicago and NW Indiana as it was always my favorite Chicago style pizza. They did not disappoint me in the least. People need to understand this pizza takes time to cook. I personally ordered mine online and came and picked it up. There was no delay, quick and simple! Amazing pizza finally in AZ."}
{"text":"Great food and great service from Dominic last night. The only disappointment was the size of the cheesy garlic bread, but it wasn't a big deal. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that they open up a location closer to me, but for now anytime I'm on that side of town, Giordano's is where I'll be found."}
{"text":"The 5 stars is for the PIZZA, it's absolutely the best ever! This place is busy which shows you how great the pizza is. Unfortunately the service is very S L O W... The staff seemed confused many tables were given wrong food items, and very slow service regarding drinks, and time to pay. Pizza does take longer because its deep dish,which they explain to you upon ordering,  BUT well worth the wait. Hopefully they can get some good new management and speed up the service, we hope to be back VERY soon..."}
{"text":"The staff was amazing! The only reason why I am giving it 3 stars is because of the staff. The plates we were given where dirty. The appetizers all seemed premade and just fried-nothing fresh but the garlic bread, which was very good. We got the deep dish special and it was so soggy and bland. I understood the wait time but I was sad to eat the pizza after waiting for it."}
{"text":"Anthony G was a great server!   Our first time here in AZ. My husband loved this place when living in Chicago over 15 years ago. We planned on coming when the grand opening was happening but unfortunately we didn't make it. Anyway for our first visit it was a great.   We had the Classic pizza and the sampler appetizer while waiting. Anthony recommended the 312 beer which I never had.... great choice with pizza by the way.   Thanks and we will be back!"}
{"text":"I will start by saying that I have eaten at Giordano's in Illinois, and was always happy with the food and the service. We have been to the Peoria location twice now and the food is good. But the staff... they are unorganized, unhelpful and unpleasant. My food came out 15 minutes before my husbands and I was done eating when he got his dish. We didn't even order pizza! The two seater tables in he walkway that they have there are ridiculous! Servers rushing by you with hot food and people traveling to the bathroom..not how I want to spend my meal. We gave it two chances, pretty sure there won't be a third."}
{"text":"Dude this place is bomb.com.  I am from Chicago and get so excited when one of our places comes down here-I just wish we would get some more in the Southwest Valley near Goodyear and Buckeye.  I have been to this location several times for eat in and I even bought a few frozen ones for carry out as well.  Everything is always excellent.  Appetizers, drinks, and pizzas as well as service have been superb.  I was sad when I saw that the Corner Bakery was shutting down, but when I saw what was taking over and being built in its place I was super stoked!!!"}
{"text":"Best authentic deep dish in town! So thankful for such a great place on the west side of town! Hooray! We have only ordered take out or delivery so not sure how sit down service is but the food is awesome!"}
{"text":"Had a very delicious deep dish, served by Amanda. Very good service, just be willing to wait. It's worth it."}
{"text":"This was our first time to Giordanos restaurant here in the valley, (grew up in Chicago); the place was clean and the staff is friendly.  We ordered the cheesy bread as a starter.   The marinara sauce was hot and flavorful but the bread was luke warm.  We ordered the meat and more meat deep dish pizza; 55 minutes later the pizza arrived. We both cut into the slice and notice that the dough was slightly under cooked, I asked to speak with one of the manager's (Christine). She explained the process in detail and was very insightful with the whole process involved in making great pizza dough.  As a foodie, I truly appreciated that Christine took the time to sit with us, she is the reason I would come back again and bring friends next time."}
{"text":"I too have eaten at the Chicago location on many occasions. So I was very excited to realize when I was in Phoenix on business that there was Gio's here. I read the reviews and quite frankly wasn't very concerned. So first things first. There was plenty of parking for a restaurant of this size. It is hard to hold the establishment responsible for being popular and the square footage of the building, which is medium sized. The hostess sat me in the bar area (my request) and was kind enough to lend me cell phone charger as my battery was at 1% (even though she was charging hers at that time). I ordered an individual deep dish anticipating the typical wait that this pizza usually requires. My pizza was at my table in no time. And it was amazing. Also, the Manager came by and spoke with me for a bit and could not have been more pleasant. So in closing, yes as there are with EVERY restaurant thee may have been some glitches, but do not let someone's opinion prevent you from checking this spot out. I may even go back before I leave town."}
{"text":"Loved this place when I lived in Chicago and was excited when they opened up in Arrowhead. Called in for pickup and was told it would be 90 minutes. Got there a little after the 90 minutes and they hadn't even started to make the pizza. The place was a disorganized disaster of a restaurant. There were a dozen other people there for pickups and most of them told me they had been waiting 45 minutes or more past their appointed time. This was on a Tuesday - not even a weekend. I thought the parking lot being jammed full was a good sign. Alas, it was just full of people waiting to get a pizza that never came. Look elsewhere"}
{"text":"I have to update my review of Giordano's...after my previous 2 star review I was contacted by the management that took my complaint very serious. Vicky the GM personality contacted  me with my issue. That was very nice of the management to address my complaint.  After hearing from management I decided to give Giordano's another chance. Came here at about 8pm on a Sunday and it was still packed. Found a few open seats at the bar and decided to have dinner there at the bar top. The bartender was very nice and personable and we ordered a medium meat/more meat pizza. Wow how much better the pizza was with bacon! It was simply an amazing pizza...the slices are so big I was lucky to eat two, but good for us we had left overs.   I knew that I would give Giordano's another chance but I was very pleased to see how serious the restaurant thought of my complaint. Well I have to admit that I don't have any complaints with Giordano's with their pizza and service. We had an excellent dinner and look forward to coming back in the near future."}
{"text":"They have the best deep dish pizza on the west side. We always go with a big family and get pizza, spaghetti for the kids, salad and an appetizer. If you love cheese, this is the place to go! The cheese is so amazing and flavorful. The crust is so good and flaky. We always go with pepperoni with the hot peppers deep dish pizza. The wait is not a big deal if you get an appetizer. You hardly notice and it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"We were able to get right in because we went straight to the bar. We tried the potato fritters and these were amazing! The wings were good size but the typical wing sauce, they were quite tasty. We also tried the Chicago Classic deep dish. Takes about 45 minutes to hour to get your pizza, the sauce was so good, the crust not so much. I had read the crust was chewy and delicious. The crust was dry almost cracker like, disappointing. We will try it again and see if this was just because they just opened.  The folks behind the bar were very friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Poor communication of events that will affect restaurant traffic, terribly limited parking."}
{"text":"If you want pizza or pasta this is the place great food fair prices and a staff that cares for you the whole time your there and remember those you come back regularly. Super friendly staff great service and a bartender that remembers you and what you drink. So stop by and have yourself a deep dish pizza you want be disappointed otherwise your depriving yourself the best"}
{"text":"We received fantastic service. I'm a Hoosier and would regularly go into Chi-town to eat deep dish pizza. Giordanos is my personal favorite. I was a bit skeptical a first though I was not disappointed once the pizza arrived. The sauce is just right and not too sweet. I will be back soon for sure and wish this valley location the best."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised at how well the service team works with one another. We had a primary server but multiple other team members delivered drinks and food. Our server was still attentive to but it is refreshing to know that your food and drinks will arrive when they are prepared and not sitting around for the primary server to deliver them.  Food was excellent, the thin crust pizza has a perfect crust that snaps along with highly seasoned toppings.  My fennel salad was the perfect balance of tart vinaigrette and crisp peppery lettuces. I loved the minestrone, filling but delicate"}
{"text":"First off, the people that complain about the amount of time it takes to cook these deep dishes, ummm, how about you STFU and go to Dominos. It's a deep dish, it HAS to take at least 45 minutes or it ain't a proper Chicago deep dish. Pshhhh.  Back to the goodstuff, SO exciting that these Chicago pizzerias are finally coming out west. Unfortunately for me, on this trip, I'm in the midst of a fitness challenge and could not eat the pizza, but rather a salad with grilled chicken. That said, 4 stars until I can come back and give my thoughts on the \"star\" of this place.   My family ordered the medium deep dish with all sausage, half pepperoni, half mushroom. It looked legit! They said it tasted just like the ones in Chicago (they're Chicagoan, so you know they know what's up). Only critique was that it was a little too salty, but not sure if it was the cheese or the sausage... They also ordered the bruschetta, which I only ate some of the tomatoes and it was really flavorful.   I really appreciated that they were able to cater to my special dietary needs. I customized a salad and it was perfect; mixed greens, cucumber, baby tomatoes, grilled chicken, all fresh and tasty, topped with balsamic vinegar and olive oil.   Service was good. Overall, staff was friendly and accommodating. Looking forward to coming back and trying the main \"star\"!"}
{"text":"My fiancé lived in Chicago for awhile so naturally when this place open we had to go. The pizza is mediocre and has no real taste. If you're looking for a real delicious Chicago style pizza head over to Gino's East or Lou Malnatis"}
{"text":"We LOVE this place in Chicago!!  Glad we don't have to travel that far to eat here anymore! We went 4:30 on a Saturday & got right in! The deep dish is worth the wait! Yum!! Loved the cute atmosphere but be prepared to hunt for a parking place. That's the only downfall!!"}
{"text":"Wow if you won the night deep dish pizza you will not be disappointed absolute place to go"}
{"text":"We were very excited to try this place! Unfortunately, we were stuck here for upwards of 3 hours and the staff seemed to really be struggling. After being seated we waited 20 mins before our drink orders were taken. Once we were finally able to order our food our waiter insisted on simply memorizing everyone's orders (6 people at the table). Several minutes later, another waitress came out to confirm our orders as she was having difficulty deciphering what they were (they were illegibly scribbled on a piece of paper). We then waited an hour for our pizzas to come out only to find that one of the pizzas had a random ingredient added to it that had not been requested. These deep dish pizzas take 45 mins to cook so we weren't about to send it back and have another made. All of our pizzas were room temperature.   The manager was kind enough to come out, apologize to us, and offer a discount. We never complained about the service so I'm guessing she simply noticed that we had been sitting there for an obscene amount of time and felt bad.  When it came time to split our checks, our waiter took nearly 25 mins printing, re-printing, and swapping around receipts at the cash register. At this point we were all exhausted and just wanted to get out of there!  Overall, all of the staff were very friendly and apologetic. I would not visit this place again. In my opinion, it was too expensive, the food itself was mediocre, and I just don't want to ever risk being trapped there for 3 hours again."}
{"text":"Lived near Chicago for a few years and always made Giordano's a priority when in town... so happy to see this Chicago staple in the Valley! Had a great night experiencing the famous stuffed deep dish they signature here in the desert! You literally cannot go wrong with their pizza- choose your favorite toppings, and I'm fairly certain you will leave full and satisfied- key note that this pizza is not for calorie-counters or those that want a thin crust. It's a hearty, filling pie. They offer thin crust selections, but don't bother- the signature is wayyyy more satisfying, and it's worth it! Also highly recommend the calamari ($10.25 as app- will serve 2-3 people) and loaded potato fritters- just do it!!!! They are likely the most delicious dish we had ($9.25)!"}
{"text":"Really great food and service. The wait time wasn't bad and the food wait time is what was to be expected for a pie that is 4 inches thick.   For the bad reviews based clearly on the wait time, go to Little Caesars. This Pie, yes, PIE...it is amazing and worth the time it takes to cook. One slice is more than enough! There was six of us, we ordered two of the garlic fries and a small salad (that was not small, but rather large). The first order of fries lacked garlic so the server brought us out two more but left the other fries!! They were all good. Manager came over to apologize about the fries, she was very nice and honestly, we were happy with the excellent professionalism provided.   Then it happened.....our pizza arrived....holy grail of pizza that can be referred to as kick ass pie :) We ordered the largest sized pie they sell. Mind you, there is six of us and we STILL had leftovers and all of us were stuffed. This pie has this amazing flaky crust with the best ingredients and of course....CHEESE! I asked for a side of marinara, it was excellent. The ingredients that go into this art of food is above par, the love put into this craft of food is indescribable. This is the true real deal. Wait the time, be patient and have some drinks.... I drank too much and almost lost my ass getting out of the booth as there is a step down as you exit the booth (if you get a booth)...I am blaming the booth and step, not the booze, lol."}
{"text":"Happy New Year it's 2018 and my hubby and I were looking to get PHO but our fave place was closed so we settled for this deep dish concoction with full of love.  WARNING: The pizza takes awhile to cook especially the deep dish, takes approximately 45-50 mins because the pizza needs to cook thoroughly from the inside out.  However, the food was delish, had the bruschetta and the cannolis (it was alright). But pizza is on point and so much.  Waiter was awesome and checked on us frequently, the manager was kind enough to explain why it takes so long for the pizza to cook. All in All!! Excellent!!"}
{"text":"Just wish the pizza was a little bit better. It wasn't bad but not worth what you pay. Great service, however we were one of the only people there since we got there right when they opened"}
{"text":"You are still \"The One\"! I grew up in Chicago the pizza capital of the world! I have long awaited your arrival, I was NOT disappointed at all!! We ordered sangria, bruschetta,  a large stuffed deep dish with 1/2 sausage 1/2 spinach, Tiramisu for dessert! You deserve 5*****+! I had forgotten how lite and fresh your pizza was and the buttery the crust, too die for! This was our first time stopping here! From the person who opened the door for us, (in and out) the server and I believe the owner brought out our pizza! Everyone was pleasant, attentive and all were smiling! I have been in AZ for 4 years I have been missing real pizza since I got here! We ordered 1-2 times a week when I lived in IL. We don't live close enough for 1-2 times a week but we will return often! I will recommend Giordano's to all friends and family in the area! I hope you will think about opening up north near Prescott, Prescott Valley, we need you up here! The best we can hope for wouldn't even make the top 5 in Chicago. You would be able to pull from as far as flagstaff to black canyon... of course everything in between!! The \"other restaurant\" opened and was so understaffed, overworked, and overcrowded and so many mistakes happened that they were losing money and giving away free food! Giordano's would do very well up here, not in just the \"tourist season\" but all year round! Can't say enough!"}
{"text":"Great place if you want to pay $13 for what tastes and looks like a frozen pizza. Ordered the house salad with lemon vinaigrette which was way too sour and cheesy garlic bread which was decent considering we were starving. Then our pizza came, a simple thin crust pepperoni pizza, which looked and tasted like a frozen pizza. It was served on cardboard... would not recommend and will never be returning."}
{"text":"Worst pizza I have had in Arizona. The crust was like card board. Was waiting for the waiter to ask us how the pizza was so I could give him a demonstration of smacking my spoon on the crust as it had zero effect on the rock hard card board crust but was never asked how the food or service was. I have had pizza from almost every restaurant in the area and this was by far the worst pizza I have had I would much rather bought a little Caesars pizza. Given the Chicago reference and past of the company I expected at least, decent pizza and received bar none the worst pizza I have eaten in a long time. It was so bad, I took the time to download this app and express my feelings publicly. Do not waste your lonely at this place there is many other local places that serve better pizza ten fold, it was my first time here and I had high hopes due to the name and it honestly was embarrassing I wasted the money I did at this restaurant it makes sense why it only had 4-6 tables out of many at prime time on a Tuesday night in a populated area."}
{"text":"BY FAR THE WORST DINING EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE! We've been to Giordano's a bunch of times in Chicago, at locations that were much larger AND busier and never had such poor service. Server said it was 45 minutes for the pizza, no problem. It was an hour and 45 minutes. And I had to flag someone down every single time we needed drink refills. Ordered a Greek salad, it came out without the feta. Had to ask for plates. Not once was the waiter apologetic for the wait. He walked by our table about 10 times without bothering to ask if we needed anything. One time he walked by and two of us at the table said \"excuse me\" and he seriously was going to ignore us until we raised our voice practically yelling. We had to eventually ask for a pitcher of water at our table because of the lack of attention. I complained to the manager who comped the salad and appetizers and was apologetic...he had just come on shift. I had to ask for a box for my leftover pizza THREE times...seriosuly??!! The pizza was good, but I won't be back. I'll take my business to Oreganos. I am only giving it one star because I have to. Too bad...Arizona could have had a really great franchise with an exceptional product and is giving the brand a bad name."}
{"text":"Being from Chicago, it's a given to come here to get your fix of a Chicago style deep dish pizza. The pizza was great except the green peppers were too chucky and large. I would expect the onions and peppers be consistent in size and more enjoyable since it was a $40 pizza. Besides that, it was delicious once i removed all the huge chucks of peppers."}
{"text":"I've had Giordano's at least 50x in Chicago and this place is just OK compare. Not the same taste or atmosphere as back home. Still better than most wannabe pizza in the Valley."}
{"text":"Just ate here at Giordano's and Morgan was our server, she was most Awesome! They were super busy being Mother's day and she still kept to being very attentive eay to go! Great service!;) Happy Mother's day!"}
{"text":"Service was good and food was delicious. Wait time was expected with our deep dish. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We first had Giordanos Famous Stuffed Pizza in Chicago back in 1979. This was our go-to pizza place. So perfect. So delicious. Now that it's out here - I can honestly say it is just as perfect and just as delicious as the original back in Chicago. The restaurant has a great atmosphere.  FOR THOSE THAT  ARE NEW TO STUFFED PIZZA- because of the thickness it takes about an hour for it to bake. But be patient-it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"We were excited Giordano's was located so close to our house and were looking forward to trying it.  When we got there, the excitement quickly wore off.  We put our name in and we're quoted 30 minutes for a table.   We weren't actually seated for an hour and ten minutes.  While waiting for our table, knowing that the pan pizzas take 30-45 minutes, we put in an advance order for the pizza.  When we were seated, our server told us that the pizzas are actually taking 75-90 minutes. We informed her of our advance order and asked her to check how much time was left for our pizza, as we had a movie to get to.   She came back 15 minutes later and indicated that the kitchen confirmed the pizza would take twenty more minutes.  Forty minutes later, the pizza still hadn't arrived.   My kids' cheese pizzas weren't even out yet.  It was now two hours and twenty minutes since we'd arrived and all we'd had were our drinks and my wife's side salad.   I told our server that her twenty minutes longer estimate was now forty minutes and we'd need the check.   She apologized and said \"I'll ask my manager to take your pizzas off the tab.\"  Uh, I'd hope so, since we never saw them.   She returned and said the the non-alcoholic drinks and side salad were comped.   We left after being there 150 minutes and went to our movie.  We will eventually give Giordano's another try, but will probably wait for them to break in and get their act together."}
{"text":"The deep dish pepperoni is awesome. We also enjoyed the chicken wings. Didn't care for the fettuccini Alfredo but I'm already not a fan of Alfredo sauce. Our server was really great and fun."}
{"text":"went to Giordan's tonight for a bit with the in-laws.   we were seated in about 10 minutes after arrival.  we sat at our table for about 10 minutes with no staff stopping about 20 of them passed us up and welcoming us to the restaurant.  Finally, Jeremy stopped and asked if we had been helped yet and he was apologetic for no one taking care of the table.   He took our drink orders and pizza order.   the pizza was good but the hand tossed crust was ok, not great.  we will try the extra crispy thin next time.  the serving plates after we had to ask for them, out of 4 of them 2 were dirty.  I just got up and found my own on another table that was set and 2 more of those were dirty.  finally found enough for our table.   But Jeremy as great and pleasant.  thank you Jeremy"}
{"text":"My husband brought me here for a fundraising event and we had an amazing time. The pizza here was just as incredible as it is in Chicago. Many of the servers refilled our drinks and they were very accommodating. The location is close to where we live so that's an added bonus. We brought home a pizza for our girls and it only lasted 15 minutes! Will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Writing this review is hurting me more than it is hurting you, Gio.   It is no secret that I LOVE Chicago and I LOVE Chicago style (deep dish) pizza. So when Lou's opened, I was ecstatic...then I heard Giordano's is opening and that made me feel...some type of way!!! I could not wait to try it.   Fast forward to Sunday Jan. 15, a group of us decided to try this place out. Mind you, I have eaten at Giordano's in Chi-town. We sit down and the waitress comes to our booth and informs us that pizza will take about an hour an hour 15-20 mins...OF COURSE THAT IS FINE! HELLOOOO, DEEP DISH!!! She took our pizza order and then came back for our drink order. Some of us asked for soda and water..she only brought water for those who asked. Why does someone even need to ask for water? Then we order a number of appetizers and here goes:  The garlic fries: NO. Don't get these. They aren't anything special that you haven't had anywhere else. Buffalo Wings: We got 1/2 buffalo sauce and 1/2 bbq. The non bbq I tried was really good! Get these, these are good.  Calamari & Friends: Eh. I wasn't impressed.  House Salad: Good cheese and dressing, otherwise it was pretty plain and boring.   Then we waited for our pizza...and waited...and waited...and waited....and waited some more. then some more. We didn't wait an hour and 20 mins....we waited nearly 2 hours for our pizza.   Now the pizza...I have one word to describe it: G-R-O-S-S!!!!!! I mean I got a personal one and i ate 1/4th of it. I asked for fresh garlic on my pizza, my wish was their command because they gave me plenty of it ON TOP of my pizza. My crust wasn't well done it was burnt. There were no meatballs in sight...I went digging too and came up with nothing. Everyone else's pizza looked really good when you pulled out the first slice but then it was watery like it had been frozen. No one said a good thing about the pizza's at dinner.   There were some other issues we had with the service, but not with mentioning. Also, Parking sucks.   I get that this may be because if the \"hype\" but there is really no excuse to not be prepared to accommodate people in less than 2.5 hours. The wait is long because no one is giving up their table...because they haven't received their food yet! Come on! Needless to say, I am REALLY REALLY SAD and DISAPPOINTED!"}
{"text":"A home run. Located in the old Krispy creme location. This place is friendly and a helpful staff you are allowed to place your order outside by a ordertaker with a tables the Waite was 35 minutes outside. But our pizza was cooking while we were waiting. By the time we got to our table it only took a additional 10 minutes very efficient. We ordered a deep dish 12 in wow great crust plentiful cheese and sausage also the sauce was just right not too much just right. Our server was very helpful and told us about the history of the crust.   The price was solo reasonable a great value. More seating is needed. Also instead of people waiting outside by the door I would take advantage of the outdoor patio serving appetizers and drinks just a fyi."}
{"text":"Giordano's is the superb Chicago deep dish true pizza fans have been waiting for!  Nestled near the 101 and Bell Road, there's so much traffic coming through they appear to be perpetually busy. With pro-Chicago bars like The Moon nearby, we know there's going to be tons of transplants even more excited about this than I am. And I can see why.   The crust is *divine*. A slight crunch on the top, but still fluffy on the inside, it's dual-layered with the toppings in between. The cheese is both rich and unique--in fact, this company owns their own farm to make their own to their liking! No wonder it's delicious. The sauce is on the sweeter, spicier side, which is just how I like it. No doubt this is how I'd make my pie if I were doing it on my own.  2 slices (from a Medium) in, and like this meal, I was stuffed! I had one pepperoni and one mushroom, as you can get half-and-half here, and I didn't mind either topping. I think next time I'll try something unique, like chicken sausage.   Yes, there are some hiccups here. The wait times are rather...extensive, but that's what happens when you've got a great franchise opening up its first location in our state. Keep in mind you can order your pizza ahead of time, so that it arrives roughly 15 minutes after you're seated. That convenience makes up for any issues I have.   Overall, this is some of the best pizza in the valley, and anyone who disagrees is wrong! Dine in or order online to carry out, it's all good. =)"}
{"text":"I chose to eat at their Peoria location even though I am on the complete opposite end of town in Phoenix.  I was planning to be in the area and didn't want to drive home during rush hour. I met a friend there and since it was HH we decided to start off with a pitcher of beer.  I swear this was the largest pitcher I have ever ordered and it was a good thing I had someone who would have a glass with me.  But there was no way we could finish the last of it.  There was probably another 16 oz glass left. We started off with an appetizer.  Best bruschetta I ever have had.  There had to be at least 2 inches of diced tomatoes on the top just perfectly seasoned.  It would be a great appetizer for 4 people or just enough for 2 without ordering anything else. We ordered a small pizza which would really feed 3 or 4 people.  It was a deep dish with fresh mushrooms and pepperoni. There were 6 extra large slices in this pie.  We each ended up taking home 2 pieces each.  Now I have 2 more delicious meals. I would really recommend just one or 2 extra toppings so that you get the taste of pizza rather than the toppings. The only reason I did not give it 5 starts was the atmosphere.  I remember the location in Chicago and the atmosphere inside which felt completely different here. Since I am on the East Side of Phoenix I will try the PV location next and see if it is closer to what I remember from the Chicago location But, all in all, I am ready to try the other location and the sooner the better."}
{"text":"They don't have the service or food quality down yet. Waited over an hour and I think Peter Piper Pizza taste a lot better than what we got."}
{"text":"We waited 2 hours for delivery, then called to find out why the pizza had not yet arrived. After 25 minutes on the phone, during which I was passed among 3 different employees, someone was finally able to tell us our pizza had not even been made yet and that it would be \"at least an hour more.\" 3+ hours for pizza delivery = nope."}
{"text":"I love Chicago deep dish. However I ordered the calamari, the hand tossed thin crust and the tiramisu and cannoli- the service was exceptional. The manager came by and chatted with us for awhile and the atmosphere is relaxed and fun! Enjoyable."}
{"text":"My husband is from Chicago and this is his favorite pizza place. We called in advance to order and the pizza was ready to eat when we arrived and the table set up. We loved the pizza and the service, we will be back!"}
{"text":"I will have to say the Deep Dish Pizza here is absolutely delicious. I ordered it with cheese pepperoni black olives and artichokes. Our service was great, we were well taken care of. The prices were reasonable. I liked their ice coffee. Bathroom was well lit , clean and well stocked. The sink was cool and different. It's a Dyson faucet so it blows air right after you wash your hands. kinda surprises you. Overall great experience, I will definitely be returning. I Love Pizza!"}
{"text":"We went on their second day open! There were 9 in our group. Two were long-time Chi-town natives. The manager was great about allowing our group to all sit at one table. There was tremendous excitement among those in line, and the door greeter was very personable. We were expecting total pandemonium once seated, but overall, we were very well taken care of! We ordered many appetizers(the baked potato bites were bomb!!), and 6 or 7 large pizzas. It was every bit as good as I remember having in Chicago, years ago. We all left, VERY full!"}
{"text":"Was really excited to try Giordanos for the first time. My food experience didn't live up to my expectations. The deep dish style takes around 45 mins from time of ordering to be made. Which is a bit longer than other places I've been to. Ordered some bruschetta while I waited. Which I was pleased with. I was eager to try my pepperoni sausage pizza when it arrived, but I was dissatisfied with the crust. The sides were descent, but the bottom crust easily came apart from my pizza and revealed a soggy triangle. I'm unsure if their crust is just frozen and then defrosted with the sauce, cheese and ingredients added. I didn't eat too many bits of the bottom because of the taste. I really expected better after all I've heard about Giordanos but sadly this location and their pizza don't live up to their hype."}
{"text":"Went here on Valentine's Day expecting a long wait especially getting there around 8PM, they sat us done instantly. Our waitress Aloni was very attentive, and let us know all our options since it was our first time. Once we got the food it was amazing!!! Perfect portion of sauce, meat and cheese. Best pizza I've ever had! Awesome experience, and we will be back! Definitely check this place out and hopefully you'll get Aloni as your waitress!!"}
{"text":"Our 1st time to go to Giordano's since the restaurant opened about a month ago. We arrived  at 4:30PM on late Sunday afternoon. As was expected there was a wait time of 30-40 minutes.  We are from Chicago and have eaten at Giordano's several times and was excited to visit there new location in Arizona. Our pleasant surprise was we were seated within 10 minutes for a party of 2! Our server greeted us with a smile and apologized for the long wait. We ordered right away Giordano's fabulous deep dish pizza with sausage, mushroom, and green pepper and Greek salad with a pitcher of Sangria. Our server, Veronica was exceptional! She prepared us that in preparation of the pizza pie the wait time was about 45 minutes. No problem, as we knew anything worth waiting for is going to be worth it. Needless to say, the pitcher of Sangria arrived and Greek salad right away. That pitcher had to be 64oz easily, very modestly priced at $16.50. Much better buy than paying for individual glasses. And then just as we were to receive the pizza, the general manager walked up to our table as said, \"You have be 21 to drink this\". My wife appreciated the humorous comment as we are in our early 60's. The General Manager, looked so familiar to us. And then it hit me... I know you! She then mentioned that we looked familiar as well. The General Manager spoke with us for a few minutes and quite honestly made us feel right at home there. The pizza well now that's another story! It was as expected, out of this world awesome!!! Thanks Veronica and GM. Giordano's has made me feel like I owned the place! Great job!!!!"}
{"text":"Just like the stuffed pizza back home in Chicago!  So glad they opened one up nearby."}
{"text":"Just took home a pizza. Haven't tried the famous Chicago deep dish. Be aware,though,it may be different than what you think of deep dish. Almost like a stuffed pizza. I like they had frozen ones to take home. We tried the regular pizza,and both of us loved it!! A lot of cheese and sausage,and very tasty. Don't know what they do,but hope they keep doing it. One of our fave pizza places now."}
{"text":"Ordered online at 5:45pm to have our food delivered...still had not received it by 9:45pm. Went back another day  to pick up a to go order.. waited an additional hour and a half in restaurant.. food was alright, will try again in a few months when they get their system down."}
{"text":"U have to know where the remote is lucky the cubs weren't playing or that would have costed 2-3 stars. Chi-Town, Giordano's"}
{"text":"Great pizza, a little far away for our neighborhood but they still deliver. When  the pizza  arrives it is still hot  and definitely worth the wait. Thick crust that is absolutely delicious. We've been ordering the pepperoni pizza once a week for the last couple of months. We highly recommend that you give it a try!!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had so far while living in Phoenix. I had the deep dish but they make thin crust as well.   Clean restaurant with a friendly staff that is knowledgeable about the menu.   Lots of variety on the menu and a great beer selection including local brands."}
{"text":"This place was not only disappointing but over priced. First when we walked in the restaurant was less than half full and we waited 5 minutes for them to clean off a booth for us to be seated. There were several other places to sit, that was annoying since neither hostess acknowledged us. No greeting, no welcome in, nothing other than \"4?\" (Which i think was what they meant table for 4?), not really a good way to welcome people in. We waited another 10 minutes to be greeted by our server and asked for drinks, again for a less than half full restaurant and a full staff. The server was nice enough to let us know if we got a deep dish it would be 45 min. So we opted for thin crust. We ordered a family salad and some mozzarella sticks. The salad and mozzarella came out, and then the pizza.. it had to have been pre-made because they served it to us on a pan with cardboard underneath. The smart thing would have been to at least taking the cardboard out from underneath so we wouldn't know it was pre-made. The pizza was less than impressive, tasted like the cardboard it was on. We had to ask for the bill and the server brought it out. The bill came out and it was 60$ for a salad, a pizza and mozzarella sticks. As we were walking out the door, there was no \"thanks for coming in,\" \"have a great day,\" \"thank you.\" The staff look less than enthused to be there and it reflected in the experience of our first time at this new restaurant. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"We arrived knowing they were still new & that could mean a long wait due to crowds. We arrived around 8:30 pm & sat at the bar to wait for our table. The bar was already out of Stella & Miller Light on tap...boo. To our surprise, we hadn't finished our first beer before being seated. Cool! After we were seated not one person came to the table for 25 mins (but several walked by) - we let 2 servers know & waited nearly another 10 mins until our neighboring table told their server, Chris T., we had not yet been helped. Chris stopped over immediately, apologized, and just took our table. We ordered an appetizer, it came out pretty quick then the manager stopped to tell us it was on them due to our delayed service. Nice! We ordered our deep dish pizza and were told it would take about 45 mins. We eventually got our pizza (a significant wait taking the whole time into account) but it was very good, maybe a 8.5 or 9/10. We also ordered the cannoli, it was eh. Ultimately Chris did a great job picking up the slack. Also to our surprise they covered the cost of our pizza. Totally unexpected - we really didn't complain! We made sure to tip Chris based off what the cost should've been. The 4 stars is for Chris' hard work, the pizza,  the space is nicely decorated & they did the right thing knowing we had an extended wait for really no reason."}
{"text":"Been to 3 of them in Chicago and was anxious to try it in Phx.....  Arrived and was on waitlist with 35-40 minute wait - not a surprise. Waited about 10 minutes for the rest of our party before we had to ask if we could order the pizza. Again, we knew it would take about 40 minutes for pizza to cook. Was a little surprised the host didn't mention this to us...so thankfully we knew.  Ordered a deep dish pizza and got seated about 10 minutes later. Timing is perfect so far.  Sat down, ordered drinks and an app - the weird calamari thing. Yep...should've read it. Calamari was good...fried lemon rings? Yuck. Fried green beans had no snap. Bleck!  Other stuff was yucky, too. This was a bummer and totally our fault for not reading it. Oh, and had to get up and get our silverware...couldn't flag down a server if we had been on fire.  Waiting for pizza....yawn...about 1 hour after we sat down and after we had pre-ordered.   Another waiter came around and was offering some guests food dishes free of charge because they knew pizzas were taking forever. We were one of these tables - so that was nice touch.   Refill drinks were slow....very slow.   Finally pizza came....and it wasn't even hot. It was an edible temperature. When our waiter finally came back around, we mentioned the pizza was not hot -  so obviously it had been sitting for a bit before it got to us.  He told manager who came over to talk to us. She offered to reheat or give us a discount. We had already each eaten a piece...so a discount was fine. It was still tasty.  Turns out, they comp'd the entire meal...was not expecting that. We really would have been ok with a discount...the pizza was still good...but certainly not like it was in Chicago.  Hopefully.....hopefully...this was a total fluke and not the norm....otherwise, may have to go to Lou Malnati's on Camelback Ave.  :-0"}
{"text":"Chicago style pizza comes to Peoria, AZ.  Just opened 1 year ago.  Ordered the special mushrooms, onions, green peppers, & sausage"}
{"text":"Giordano's is a great Italian/Chicago style restaurant that I highly recommend! The negative reviews on this place's wait times and busyness should not count against it. This restaurant just opened no more than 5 months ago, it is located on the busy P83 strip with tons of people and near the Arrowhead Mall, and is only a moderate sized restaurant.       When my husband and I first arrived we heard the wait was almost 2 hours but for a party of 5+ - for just me and my husband we were sat right away. Large families/parties need to realize that places that have just opened up are going to be super busy and have long wait times - its common sense. We sat at a small side table and were not too shocked at how busy and compacted everyone was. We expected it and were happy to see all the buzz around the place. Our waiter got our drinks immediately and walked us through the menu. He warned us about a large party that had just arrived and that we needed to put any pizza order in soon other wise it would be over an hour wait for a Chicago style pizza.       My husband and I wanted to go a different route and ordered a pasta and sandwich instead. The wait time on the pizza was not a negative strike to us - we knew hand making a pizza from scratch takes time and we were more interested in the other dishes anyways. My husband ordered the Italian Beef Sandwich and I ordered the Marinara Spaghetti while we shared the Giordano's Sampler. The food was FANTASTIC and i'll be posting pictures of it too. It was rich and flavorful with a real taste of care and love. The only negative part of the meal was that everything came out all together and quite quickly. I believe my husband and I waited just over 10 minutes to get our appetizers, salads, and entrees. Our table almost couldn't fit it all. I ended up having to not finish my salad because I did not want my entree to get cold.       Other than that my husband and I had a great meal and really enjoyed the atmosphere. We also appreciated our waiter and his thoughts in items on the menu that were best for us and our time frame. I will definitely be back to have more from this delicious establishment - but with a party no larger than 3 I think for the next few months."}
{"text":"I had never had Chicago Style Deep Dish pizza before, so my friends and I decided to give it a try with Giordano's for my birthday.  And boy did we made a mistake.  8/8 of us believes this place was a hot mess.   The night we decided to experience this place for the first time was horrific in every level.  It took us a while to find a parking spot, parking sucks.  Once we were able to get in more waiting till we were seated.    Once we were seated more waiting till our drinks were ordered and came.  When my Dr Pepper came it was very watered down... but it's okay no big deal, probably more healthier this way.  We ordered a few appetisers and a few Chicago Style Deep Dish pizzas, we were fatties.   I must admit there wings both buffalo and BBQ was amazing, the best wings I had ever had. It was plump and juicy and full of flavour!!  I think my hunger amplified the experience from all that waiting but that's okay.  The garlic fries was gross, and the calamari was gross.  After eating the calamari I had to excuse myself to use the loo.  Gotta empty myself to make room for the pizza.  Gotta cleanse myself before experiencing the pizza.  The bathroom was super clean, and I enjoyed it.   The main event the pizza!  The moment I been waiting for, and we waited for 2 hours!  The Deep Dish Pizza....  it was gross at best.  It was over cooked and it felt more like tomato soup with some cheese, meats, and veggies  mixed in a cardboard bread bowl.  I only ate half a slice before I gave up, and I had to fight one of my friends to take the rest home.  We ordered 3 large Chicago Style Deep Dishes too.  We wasted a lot.  I believe most of it ended in the trash the next day.    Overall this place gets two stars! One star  for the Wings and the other star  for the Loo."}
{"text":"This is not my first time eating Giordanos pizza. I love this pizza and crave it all the time. Every time I visit Chicago I always make sure to stop at a Giordanos and eat there. Well they finally opened up a location on 83rd and Bell. We first started off with the calamari. It was good but there was 2 calamari balls. What I mean is when they deep-fried them they a lot of them stuck together. Still tasted good but was frustrating to eat them properly. We also ordered a pepperoni pizza deep dish. Let's just say it's nothing like the one in Chicago. Everything about the pizza was wrong. When the server brought us the pizza and cut us slices the cheese melted completely off the pizza and It wasn't even in the shape of a slice after it was put on a plate. Looked like a round circle of cheese with crust on the end. Cheese tasted different , there were was not enough pepperoni for you to even call it a pepperoni pizza. Also the crust underneath the pizza was missing.... in the center of the pizza. The center only had cheese and then as you move towards the outer crust it builds up. So at the beginning of eating this pizza I was just eating pure cheese.I'm not complaining about any wait time which was one hour. Giordanos always takes about 40 minutes to an hour. This whole complaint is 100% the pizza. I was very excited about them opening up in Phoenix but after this experience I can say that I will NOT be attending this location again...  I don't recommend this location of Giordanos. If you want the good stuff go to Chicago"}
{"text":"Went there with my husband and  2 daughters  and grand kids. We are all from Chicago except the grand kid's. My husband had the spaghetti and meatballs he said it was delicious good size portion,everyone said there food was good different pasta dishes. Now for me I ordered a small special deep dish pizza because I wanted leftovers and told a friend I'd bring her some anyways I liked the flavor of the sauce and the crust and there was a good amount of cheese the only thing I had a problem with was there wasn't enough sausage in it and not enough veggies(onions & green peppers) they were cut small so they probably cooked down to were you couldn't find them and I hardly tasted them I think if they cut the veggies bigger for the deep dish pizza it would help.$20.00 for a small pizza I expected more inside."}
{"text":"Very friendly and accommodating staff. Server checked in at the right moments and came across as genuine in making sure we were ok. The mozzarella triangles were awesome. They are not stingy with cheese here. I ordered a personal deep dish with sausage and mushroom and it was good. The crust was harder than I would have preferred but it was good. My fiancé's mom and sister in law ordered a gluten free pizza with mushroom on one half and green olives on the other. It was pretty good. Everyone was satisfied.   Restaurant was clean, they have good lunch specials, and deliver."}
{"text":"I have never had Chicago style stuffed crust pizza before it was excellent! So cheesy so delicious I cannot recommend this place high enough. And then the tiramisu at the end phenomenal. Great service great food you will enjoy it"}
{"text":"Last night was me and my partner's first time in the Peoria establishment we are originally from Chicago and we're excited when we came across this restaurant the waiter took his time seating us as we set we requested a different table because the seats were wet the place of the seating was noisy but they refused to reset us so we set where they placed us unhappily now our waitress I believe her name was mango was a very nice young lady very communicative to us and apologetic for the disappointment we had and the long time spent for the cooks to prepare food Unfortunately they took so long we lost interest of eating we were annoyed by the noise and annoyed by the Cravings of starvation so we had mango box up our food to go we gave her a very nice tip but decided we would never return back to this establishment it really was not worth our time we sat there for over an hour waiting being irritated and annoyed and sitting in wet filt when we got home to taste the pizza we had a meat lover pizza with veggies now honestly it didn't taste anything like Chicago's Giordano all I taste was unseasoned ground beef marinara sauce and loaded salty cheese we had the appetizer sampler and was unsatisfied with everything in it my bill was almost fifty bucks and for that reason we would never return back to this establishment I gave one star only because you had to leave a star good luck on your experience not being satisfied we will never return again"}
{"text":"Very good service, cool restaurant and sitting outside in the misters to cool off was great. The pizza, of course, was a wonderful reminder of home (though I still prefer Lou Malnati). I also had the chopped salad which was very tasty. And on a side note, the faucets/hand dryers in the bathroom were kinda cool."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place for a while so when family visited from out of state tonight we thought it would be perfect! First off we were seated way too close the large group behind us that were less than nice with space. We were greeted by our sever who admitted bluntly to not being 21 therefore could not make any recommendations on the beer selection on tap. Our server also told us straight off that all pizzas took 30-45 minutes to make as an FYI while making our selections. I asked to be moved due to space issues which the server accommodated for us right away even though I acknowledged the restaurant was on a wait already. After being moved to another section our appetizers came out fairly quickly but overall service was super slow and our drinks were empty for most of the service. My meal was never ordered and a manager never came to our table. When asked about the missing meal by a busser another server just said \"I don't have them\" and walked away. I had to find our server to ask for dessert to go as he never came back and our meal was still over $100 with one pizza and 3 appetizers. Overall the food was ok. Pretty disappointing."}
{"text":"Wait is usually pretty long but it's worth it. Their deep dish pizza is great.  Friendly staff.  I do think Lou Malnati's is a little better but they are both good.  Be prepared though, deep dish pizza does take a while to cook."}
{"text":"Ate at Giordanos in Chicago and it was good but I honestly think I liked this one better. Ordered a deep dish pepperoni and some cannoli and the pizza was excellent, though the cannoli was kinda blah. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"When I visited Chicago several years ago I was introduced to this pizza a few years ago while still living in LA I paid and had one ship to me I'm so excited now that I'm back in Arizona to find that dear Donna's is now local I love ordering through this place..."}
{"text":"Wednesday, early evening, I was excited to visit the new Giordano's in Peoria since it was Chicago style pizza...I'm thinking a west side version of Lou Malnati's.  Nope, not that at all.  We drove several times around the small parking lot until a space freed up. We were seated in a reasonable amount of time in a hallway between the kitchen and the restaurant seating.  And that was it.  We waited 15-20 minutes without the slightest acknowledgement.  Employees were going up and down the aisle but they wouldn't even slow down for us to get their attention and there were LOTS of employees, mostly just standing around in the corners of the restaurant.  I understand that they've been open only a couple of weeks but come on.  This place needs management.  We walked out...that didn't get any attention either. I gave them two stars giving them the benefit of the doubt that I would like the pizza had I been able to taste it."}
{"text":"What a horrible experience! Our server quoted us 40-60 mins for a small deep dish pizza for two people and it took close to two hours. They allowed too many take out orders... believe me I watched everything that came out of the kitchen. So it looks like the best way to go is order take out. The deep dish pizza was good... better than the competition, but that awful time estimation left a bad taste in my mouth. We asked to speak to a manager and he didn't comp anything... not even our drinks. Very poor experience. I only recommend visiting dine in within a couple months, unless you don't mind waiting ridiculously long."}
{"text":"I love this place. I used to go in Chicago all time time being from the Midwest and was real excited when I saw this one visiting my aunt and Uncle (currently I live in California). Mango is so nice and such a great server. We've had her a couple times and she's awesome!! If I can make one suggestion tho: for the lunch specials when you have left over pizza's cuz not enough people came in that day, you should totally give it out to the homeless people! Or a homeless shelter! The trash can isn't as hungry as the people livin' on the streets!"}
{"text":"The cheese pull was amazing. Freak delicious pizza. Even had awesome coupons so be sure to join the email club. Free app for joining & free dessert for bday. I cashed in both at my visit :)"}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday, right when they opened at 11.  The first thing that was annoying was a lack of parking.  There were about 4 other tables taken in the restaurant, but only 4-5 parking spaces available.  We were seated immediately.  Things went downhill from there.  First, the table was dirty.  We asked someone to wash it and they did.  We ordered a sampler, a pasta dish, a regular crust pizza, and a deep dish pizza.  When the sampler arrived, we realized one of the plates on the table was dirty.  We requested a new one.  The next two plates they brought were also dirty.  Finally the 3rd plate was clean.  The sampler was fine - though the potato bites (can't remember the exact name) were quite greasy.  The garlic bread was very good as were the mozzarella triangles.  The remainder of the food came out at 3 different times.  First, the pasta dish arrived.  About 15 minutes later, the regular crust pizza arrived.  Finally, 15 minutes later the deep dish pizza arrived.  I could see them arriving within 5 minutes of each other because of the length of time a deep dish takes, but 30 minutes between the first and the last was quite excessive.  The person eating the pasta dish was done before the final pizza arrived.  The pasta was very good.  The thin crust pizza was ok - a bit too much cheese, and only about 5-6 pieces of pepperoni (when I pay over $2 for a topping, I'd expect it to have more than 6 pieces).  Last, the deep dish was not really good.  The sauce and crust were amazing, the amount of cheese was a bit excessive, but there were hardly any toppings.  To top it all off, our server went missing and we had to ask another server for a refill on our drinks.  Only after we were done eating did he stop by with the check.  For the price we paid, I would have expected excellent service, excellent food, and really nothing to be dirty."}
{"text":"I have been to the Giordanos in Chicago and fell in love with the pizza, so my anticipation was high. We went at 3 pm to avoid the line and long wait. It still took about an hour to get our pizza. When it arrived the pizza crust was burned and I was very disappointed. I will say that our waiter Camden was attentive to my concern and I do understand that the restaurant  is new and has kinks to work out. Manager Vicky came over to chat with us and agreed that our pizza was over cooked and comped our pizza. So cudos to the staff for making things right. Hopefully they will get their act together soon."}
{"text":"As a Chicago transplant I know the pizza's great, and am very excited to have one of my favorite pizza places near home. However, my experience today has left a bad taste in my mouth. We ordered the pizza online to avoid the long wait. Pizza was ordered at 430 pm. We arrived to pick up our pizza at 610pm, our pick up time, only to WAIT in line for 1 HOUR to pick up our online order. This line was an unorganized mess as people frequently cut in to place their ordered. Then without an offer of apology for the wait....the girl at the counter insisted that my prepaid order was declined. I showed her the debit on my account on my phone, as the money had already been removed from my checking account. I ended up having to pay for the pizza with another card just to get my pizza. So I paid twice for my pizza that was COLD when I got into the car!!  When I asked to girl why it was a 60 minute wait to pick up an online order she still offered no apology but instead said because she is busy with other pick ups, answering calls and taking orders!!! Only then did the girl at the counter offer me a soda to compensate for the inconvenience of waiting so long and the card problems, Hardly adequate compensation. Too pissed off to stand in the crowded line, and hold up the countless pissed people behind me and wait for someone who knows something....As soon as I got to the car with my COLD  pizza, I called to speak to a manager. It took three attempts to get a manager because rather than putting me on hold to wait for the manager they hung up on me twice. The manager has offered to refund both my charges. Will see if that happens. It better! I'm not even sure that's enough compensation at this point in time to make a return trip. I loved Giordano's in Chicago but it might be Lou Malnati's for me from now on.  PS- the parking lot is tiny and parking was another nightmare"}
{"text":"It was crowded on Saturday night with a 30-45 minute wait, so we sat and ordered at the bar. This Chicago chain restaurant is casual and loud and doubles as a sports bar (beer & pizza).  I ordered a deep dish veggie pizza and my spouse ordered a meatball sub. Both took over an hour to get out to us. In addition to the regular orders, they fill take out orders as well. So don't go if you are starved and want service right away or wait to go during the week. The food is filling and tasty. I'm not a fan of deep dish but this was very good. Prices are 15.00 or more per person. Our server was attentive and professional."}
{"text":"My wife and I were driving by Saturday evening 12/17 and noticed a very busy new Italian place so we stopped.  We were told that it was a private \"friends and family\" night and so we prepared to depart saying we'd come another time.  That's when we met Vicky!  She insisted we stay and sat us at the bar (almost forcefully!).  She said our meal was complimentary and that all drink proceeds were going to charity.  She also asked us to please offer our feedback.  My wife and I ordered a salad and the lasagna!  I am so glad we stopped in and that we got to meet Vicky and the rest of the staff.  The food was delicious & the staff was very friendly!  I would like to compliment Vicky for insisting we stay!  I have no idea what her role there at the restaurant is.  A manager of some sort I'm sure.  She was so gracious and kind for allowing us to stay at the \"family and friends\" event that we felt like family, and can certainly be counted on as friends!  We look forward to dining there again in the near future and trying their famous stuffed pizza!  Thank you!  Hector Saenz Peoria AZ"}
{"text":"I came here on a Thursday night with a friend.  Tired of the usual places, we decided to try a thick crust pizza.  The staff was very friendly, and we enjoyed the ambiance in the bar area.  I ordered a Hawaiian style pizza, waited 45 minutes, and finally got to enjoy the hot pizza.  The first bite was delicious!! I quickly ate two slices , but slowed down after that.   The cheese is perfect, and the crust is perfectly crunchy but also delicate.  I really enjoyed the experience and the food, will look forward to coming back!!"}
{"text":"I love this pizza!!  I have had it in Chicago, Las Vegas and now Glendale!!  Yes, it takes awhile to cook but it's huge, that should be expected!  This location is really big. It was way too loud and cold inside, but once we got our pizza I'm pretty sure no one cared!"}
{"text":"So, when this place first opened, the work homie, Joel, picked up a pizza and bought it into the office for us to try.  I had a slice, and instantly fell in love.  It was the best deep dish/stuffed pizza I had ever tried.  I had been back a few times since then (Yelp event, and lunch takeout), and was craving some of their stuffed pizza today!  M-F from 11am-3pm, they have great lunch deals!  I placed my order online, paid for it, drove down, and picked it up.  Here is how it was..........  Pepperoni Pizza Lunch Special-  For a little over $8.00 (incredibly reasonable for a super filling lunch), you get a 6 inch stuffed pizza and a side of your choice.  I went with a pepperoni pizza and an order of fries for my side. I was handed my rectangular box of goodies and I took it outside to dig in.  I opened my box and there was a beautiful looking small, but thick and dense, pizza, and a mound of piping hot fries.  The pizza was delicious.  Even though its \"only 6 inches\" (That's what she said...OOOHHH!), this pizza is mighty filling.  I cut it into 4 slices and enjoyed every minute of it.  Great tasting sauce piled on top of pepperoni and their great cheese, on top of their flaky, buttery crust...oh yeah, I'm in love!  It was delicious just like the previous few times I had gone.  The fries were great, too!  They were freshly fried to order, and crunchy, yet soft on the inside.  They could have used a tad more salt, but that's nitpicking.  Damn good fries!    Overall, this place rocks!  Every time I have been here, I have had a great experience.  Food is always delicious, and during their lunch hour, it's incredibly budget friendly.  They also have a lunch punch card which earns you a free lunch after you buy 5.  Not too shabby at all.  I will continue to come back here!  This place is great!"}
{"text":"Good food and great example of a chicago deep dish. However be prepared to wait for it... never recieved a pizza in less than 35min after ordering. Also, service is a little slow. Get your refills while you can!. Beyond that, great place to go! You'll head home stuffed!"}
{"text":"Food was horrible , went for lunch with co workers and I would never spend another dollar there , I take that back maybe a beer, and that's it! My stomach hurt for the remainder of the day. !!!!!! HORRIBLE !!"}
{"text":"Great place. I'm a Chicago native and really missed having this place around. the mozzarella triangles are to die for"}
{"text":"Nice dark interior, the special stuffed pizza was nice, from the edge in seemed to be sausage, mushrooms, bell peppers, then onions. Tried the Italian beef, good on the smaller side, tons of fries, had mine with sweet peppers and the spicy peppers come like giardiner style with carrots."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by this place for lunch. We ordered the sampler and it was very good. However the loaded frittata was awesome. I could eat more of those than I should. We both ordered salads and I had the Italiano. It was delicious and my wife loved her chopped salad as well. A few things to note here. No doubt the food was good and the deep dish pizza looks amazing. We will be back for sure for that. But the service was outstanding, my ice tea was never empty and added ice without even asking (no ice in ice tea = disappointment for me). Our waitress was all over it. Always attentive but not too much. Lots of little details in the service like explaining wait times on deep dish, asking if we needed extra dressing for our salads etc. The manager stopped by to ask if everything was to out liking, you could see servers taking care of other tables that were not there. Overall outstanding service. The decor was very nice for a pizza place. I did visit the bathroom as well and it was nice and clean but the sink was so cool. Never seen a faucet that dispenses water then you move your hands out to the edges and it dries them. Loved it. Check this place out. Good food, great service and nice atmosphere. We will be back."}
{"text":"The thin crust pizza we had was great. Lots of toppings. The specialty deep dish was just OK. Not really worth the wait. Its probably just a taste issue, I may not get the draw of pan pizza. Service was OK. They made mistakes on the order but were quick to make it right.  I was really looking forward to trying this place. Heard about it in Chicago for years. Unfortunately I wont be in a rush to go back."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Its been 5 years since I've been to Chicago.  For 22 years it was the first stop i made when i was there! It was everything i remember.  Plus great staff and customer service.  We ordered to go on opening day. Yes it was busy, but you all were on it! Thank you for a great pizza and even better service! We will dine in soon!"}
{"text":"This place ain't got a ounce of chicago in it talk about bad service I been ordering giordanos my whole life starting in Chicago and was waiting forever for them to open in az I've always ordered Italian beef and gardenera peppers on my pizza always never had a issue in Chicago and manage to get it in az until now I just called to order and the lady refused to give me what I want what I ordered from the same location five days ago so I asked to speak to a manager who can help me I wait and they put me on the phone with a supposedly manager at a call center really ???? And what did that manager say to me even after I offered to pay extra sorry it was a one time deal for you we don't do that we don't order enough beef lmao are you serious giordanos shame on you for having hands down the worst customer service you lost a customer for life I would have payed extra for a damn Italian beef sandwich you could have put it on my pizza if anybody wants that good combo go to Lou malnatis in az they will do it for you I guess they ordered enough beef for there customers"}
{"text":"Giordano's truly is a Chicago staple food, one of the essential parts of any Chicagoan's diet.  As a former Chicagoan, Giordano's was not my favorite pizza place, but with many locations near me over the years, it was an easy go-to.  This is Giordano's first Arizona location and I have now been there a small handful of times, so I feel like I can accurately review their foray into the desert!  My first two trips were disappointing, to say the least.  Undercooked pizza... or incorrect toppings... or just something off about the taste.  But the last two visits have made up for those early issues and Giordano's IS BACK on their game!  Consistency is key and I feel like they have really hit their stride after a rough opening and introduction to AZ.  Technically their pizza is \"stuffed\" and not \"deep dish\", but the terms are often used interchangeably, even by Chicagoans.  It's that extra layer of dough on the top that makes this a stuffed pizza.  If you learn anything from my reviews of other pizza restaurants as a self-proclaimed \"pizza connoisseur\", there are three things that an excellent pizza needs... fresh quality crust, Wisconsin cheese, and a well-balanced tomato sauce!  Toppings are never going to make a pizza, but definitely can break it.  Giordano's has those needed ingredients and their toppings are good to boot.    I can't see myself driving out to the West Valley only to pick up a pizza, but I am a fan and will hit up Giordano's when I'm in the area and it's convenient!  ****FOUR STARS****"}
{"text":"We tried this place while on vacation to Chicago and loved it, so we were excited to see one open near us. The deep dish pizza is just as good as I remember it being- the sauce was flavorful and the the crust had a biscuit type flavor. They brought us the wrong pizza and kept messing up our order, however our waitress was very accommodating and gave us our whole meal for free including drinks and a new pizza. Since it's a new restaurant they are a little scattered but we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"First time there. Service was great. Happy people work there. Food was delicious. Portions were large. Go for the deep dish pizza. Its famous for a reason."}
{"text":"After waiting almost a decade to share my favorite pizza with my parents I now know I should have kept waiting.   I expected a bit of a line but I was rushed through checking and They were onto the next customer before my family could ask about pre ordering.  Luckily a while later we heard some one else pre ordering so we did it too being told to pre order our deep dishes only.   45 minutes after ordering we were seated , just a few minutes late.     We ordered appetizers since they quoted an hour and a half for deep dishes.  And ordered a child's pizza and my father who loves pizza ordered his favorite pizza pepperoni asking the waiter which pizza he could order to be out no later than our deep dishes. He got a thin crust.   Our deep dishes didn't come out until we had been seated for over an hour, it took almost another hour for the KIDS menu pizza and the thin crust. We were there over 3 hours.  OH and to top it off when the final pizza arrived it had no pepperoni on it.  Instead covered in olives which he hates.     I regret going there and feel embarrassed at telling them years how much I love this place. The servers were scrambling the whole place was behind while a non stop of carry outs and delivery were being paraded out the door.  Save yourself the trouble of relying on their service. Just get a delivery if you must eat their food or better yet get a frozen one mailed from Chicago as this place doesn't deserve your money until they can meet the expectations they set.   \"We swear 10 more minutes max and it's out\" waited another 20.   This place doesn't deserve to wear the name."}
{"text":"I don't care what anyone else says they have the best deep dish pizza out there I only go here for the deep dish pizza so I wouldn't be able to tell you about anything else"}
{"text":"My 12 year old brother and I agree: best pizza we've ever had. The crust is buttery, the sauce is flavorful and not too acidic, the ingredients are fresh and perfectly cooked. We ordered a medium Chicago deep dish and it was more than enough. All of the staff was friendly and the place was well kept.   If you're going to order a deep dish, it takes about 45 minutes to cook, so bring a card game."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza on July 4th. Called the order in and was advised was ordering through a third party company. Order was received and even got a call when my order was done. Pizza was very good, got their famous deep dish and the crust was perfect and pizza was tasty. We recommend this place."}
{"text":"The pizza crust is dry and bland. Texture is like cardboard. So bummed. The chopped salad was really good and service was nice but I don't have anything positive to say about the pizza."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. I WANT MY MONEY BACK. horrible. We ordered delivery and when the food got here an HOUR AND 15 MIN LATER the pizza was soggy, wet, and disgusting. The meat on the pizza didn't seem thoroughly cooked and we couldn't even eat it. We also ordered a sampler platter and when I opened the box it looked at though only half of it was there. Literally the smallest sampler platter I have ever seen. Upon trying to eat the cheesy bread it was so salty I thought I poured a can of salt on my tongue. I had to spit it out and the rest of the food went in the trash. I WANT MY MONEY BACK. SO MAD."}
{"text":"These people really try hard, and impressed us with the care and kindness they exhibited trying to retain our business when they screwed up our order. Not your typical franchise or chain. Definitely worthy for your family/friends - even if the rare mistake. Recommended :-)"}
{"text":"We thought it was good. We do like Lou Malnatis better but its so nice to have great Chicago pizza on our side of town. The tables were really small over all a little cramped in there but will definitely go back and try more things"}
{"text":"Visited AZ over the weekend from San Diego and a family member told us about this spot. Best Chicago style deep dish pizza in town. She was RIGHT!!!!  My first ever deep dish and we were not disappointed at all!!! I can't understand why it only had three and a half stars as far as the rating ! This is definitely a five star joint!!! Why you ask..? Cause from customer service to atmosphere to the food...EVERYTHING was on point!!! We ordered the following:  Chicago style deep dish - AMAZING Cheesebread - PERFECT Ceasar salad - ORAL ORGASM!!!  The pizza even tasted better days later as we ordered a large and had left overs. That ceasar dressing they have...MY OH MY...one of THE BEST ceasar dressings I have ever had!! Just FYI...they offer frozen deep dish pizzas for sale to take home and bake in the comfort of your home."}
{"text":"You have to get the deep dish pizza! It is worth the extra wait! They have a pretty good happy hour Monday through Friday 3-6. The cheesy bread and mozzarella triangles are amazing. I don't even like marinara sauce but wow I could eat theirs by the jar!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately this Giordano's location is nowhere near as good as the Chicago location. Neither the pizza or pasta had much flavor. The cannolis were disgusting. We don't plan to return."}
{"text":"Honestly without question or compare the worlds best pizza.  There it is! I called it. Put it in a history book. It's been said. Chicago Classic is the way to go."}
{"text":"Loved the food, I would definitely come back for the stuffed pizza. it was nice to have a taste of Chicago while in town for Spring Training. They were able to accommodate our large party, but the wait once we were seated was unreasonably long...food took forever to come out, refills were non-existent. I'm hoping it was because it was Friday evening and we were a large party, but this kinda ruined our experience. I'd still be willing to come back when we're in town,  (my hubby is from Chicago and this is the a good taste of home for him), hope their service improves next time!"}
{"text":"It's like when you start dating and you try not to compare your potential new lover to a past lover but if I have to wait an hour and forty-five minutes to get my hands on some meat, cheese, and bread, I'm gonna start comparing!  The eight of us set out for dinner here at Giordano's last night, a month after they opened, for what should have been a good meal.  We knew what we were getting into after reading some reviews.  We expect the wait but holy moley, what a wait!  With Lou Malnati's already in business and Gino's East opening up soon, where did Giordano's come in for us?  First, let's talk food:  Garlic Parmesan Fries (Served with our signature ranch dipping sauce.  $3.25):  Don't get these.  You'll only be in for disappointment.  The garlic isn't fresh, the cheese was sparse, but their \"signature ranch dipping sauce\" was good. I just don't get how they can put fresh garlic on pizza and not their fries.  Calamari & More (Fried mix of tender calamari, green beans, lemon rings, banana peppers and shaved fennel served with our house-made marinara sauce.  $10.25):  These were decent.  I liked the random fried other-bits as it made things fun.  Chicken Wings (Regular or boneless-Classic Buffalo Style or Barbecue.  $9.95):  These wings were solid.  We got them bone-in with half BBQ and half buffalo.  It had a crisp solid skin with just the right amount of vinegar.  Giordano's House Salad (Spring greens, romaine, arugula, radicchio, baby tomatoes and shaved fennel tossed in our lemon vinaigrette with shaved asiago cheese.):  Pass and snooooore.  *Nearly a two-hour interval later*  The Special (Sausage, mushrooms, green peppers and onions):  When the parade of pizzas came out, it was pretty darn exciting.  A ton of pictures were taken from various angles and then it came time to dive into these bad boys.  I shared a small \"The Special\" and didn't try the others.  The Special was pretty bland.  The bottom crust was kind of soggy and the sausage and vegetables gave no flavor.  The sauce was sweet but that was about it.  After checking out all the pizzas with slices being eaten, we realized that all the pizzas were sitting in pools of water.  Some thought that maybe it was the sauce giving off the watery consistency and most were speculating that things were being cooked frozen.  Who knows.  But after such a long wait and slowly getting full off drinks and appetizers, I was disappointed with the pizza. What's worst is that everybody who took the leftover pizza home complained about the pizza melting and merging in with the cardboard. So you get to chomp on cardboard along with pizza when you reheat it.   I think Lou's might need a tear drop tattoo under their eye because they killed their competition.  I wouldn't mind giving Giordano's another try if the wait time was cut to a more sensible amount. It's not a hype problem for the wait time; it's an operation problem. Table turnover rate is ridiculous."}
{"text":"I had a mess up here, where I ordered online, but it never came through to the store. The manager was very kind and delivered me the most perfect service, and all of the waiting and trouble was worth it. This was honestly the best pizza I have ever had. The most cheese I have seen on a pizza ever! And plus, the crust isn't super hard like Lou Malnati's in central Phoenix. It is perfect! The best pizza I have ever had, and I've had pizza every Friday for dinner since I was 3 1/2 years old as a family tradition. (I'm 20 now)"}
{"text":"I love that there are so many Chicago deep dish pizza places around the PHX area.  It's one of my favorite parts of visiting the city.  I love Lou's, but Giordanos was considerably closer to where we were staying, so we checked it out.  The pizza was good, but not quite mind blowing.  I'd lean toward Gino's or Lou's, but was still excited to have deep dish.  Really disappointed by the tap list, though.  I wanted a beer, but the selections were really basic and limited.  More on the domestic side than the Microbrew side."}
{"text":"listen this is what i dont get about yelp the food here is amazing the pizza is amazing they brought old school pizza back from Chicago just for us here in az and people are complaining about wait what do you people want go complain somewhere else. Such cry babys on yelp this is to review the food not the wait do you know how much time and preparation it takes for a gorgeous deep dish that this place makes but no people wanna talk about the wait guess what you cant always get what you want but with patience its worth the wait. It is absolutely worth the wait and if its not to you then come on hours that its not busy common sense which none of the complainers have this place is awesome with good food that me and my wife love so if you dont like waste your time somewhere else dont come here if the wait is to long get some oily pizza hut not this amazing piece of heaven on a plate if you have nothing good to say then dont say it peace love ya old school chicago deep dish thank you for coming to az!"}
{"text":"Okay, this is it. This pizza is to die for. I am so tired of hearing all these claims about real Chicago and real New York pizza and 99.99% of the time it stinks. My wife and I went for lunch and our waiter advised us a fresh SPECIAL would take a little while. We waited a reasonable amount of time and when the pizza arrived FANTASTIC. I was impressed. I'm a little fussy since I grew up in NYC so finding good pizza is like gold."}
{"text":"Thin crust took 30-35 minutes and deep dish is supposed to take 40-45. Skimpy toppings on gluten free margarita pizza and don't waste your money on the cannolis"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the evening. The Mgr and the waiters were very nice and attentive, they went out of their way to find us roomier seating since we had a larger group.   We arrived at 5pm on a Thursday, we were seated fairly quickly, there was a bit of a wait for the food (1hr 20 min) but thats expected as they're new and the pizza itself takes 45min to cook...get appetizers and cocktails you'll be fine.  Cons: Canoli filling bland, tiramisu was frozen, they dont have copper mugs for mules.  Pros: pizza is good, ambience is good, fritters and calamari are awesome. Staff is attentive.  The wait is the biggest thing for many ppl, so anticipate it and make the best of it. The staff makes up for any cons. Im sure the in n outs are just getting worked out. I do recommend it."}
{"text":"This is as close as a true CHICAGO deep dish pizza should be if your not eating it off of Michigan Avenue! The chain has the correct water balance and imported Wisconsin mozzarella cheese to perfection!! Thanks guys from a Chicago transplant family now living in Arizona."}
{"text":"This pizza was amazing!!!  I ordered to go at 3:30 and my order was ready at 6:30. It was Saturday night and New Years Eve. I was told via email confirmation that my order would be ready at 5:50-6:20.  Everybody needs to remember this is a new location and have kinks to work out. Their manager made up for things-- she comped my meal and gave me a $25 gift card for future visit!!! I will be a frequent customer!!! Their issue is their call center--- they are holding onto orders when we place them and sending them over in large groups. If they can fix this problem the whole place will run smoother.  The employees are doing their best.   The pizza- 10 out of 10. Their sauce is great. Very cheesy!!! Crust is pretty good-- good dough and crunchy!!!  Garlic cheese bread- 9 out of 10. Very cheesy with a different type of cheese not sure what it is but still good. Their marinara makes it a great pairing."}
{"text":"Being from Chicago, anytime a Chicago-based restaurant comes to town, I take it upon myself as a challenge to check it out so I can give it my thumbs up or down to my friends. I've has Giordanos twice in the past, once for their fettuccine Alfredo, and once for their deep dish pizza, and the pizza definitely lived up to expectations and I'm glad it's close by.  This evening I ordered a take out of their lasagna and picked it up but was not quite on the size of the order that was told to me to be family size. After talking with the waitress Ebony, I hope I spelled her name right,  who introduced me to Christine, the manager on at that time, and she was very courteous, understanding and professional, just how A manager is supposed to be. She took great care of me and getting my order the way I liked it and went above and beyond the call of duty to complete it. I was not expecting what she did, but I am beyond appreciative of her actions. The old hometown restaurant family style appeal and experience is what she delivered to me tonight and I am forever grateful and a customer for life."}
{"text":"It seems like Chi-town folks will argue between Lou's and Giordano's. I am a NY pizza gal by trade so can't tell the difference. I do love the stuffed pizza too though. I just don't think of the stuffed pizza as Pizza though. To me it is more like a sweet cake/pie. The dough is so not like pizza dough but more like a cake/dessert dough. Very oh so good!  The staff here are pretty amazing. Jason was my server and he was great. There are enough extra people here to make your visit a spoil fest. i can not tell you how many people stopped my table to say hi and see how I was doing.  I really liked the corp trainer. She rocks! We chatted for a long time before I got her name. This is a nice place to go. There was no wait when i went at 4pm and after Christmas they start their lunch time opening.   As far as the food goes, the greek salad was very good. The Feta is amazing.  The pizza is good. The Tiramisu was good but not the best I have ever had. Not sure what type of ladyfingers they use but they seemed bland or over-soaked maybe? Still yummy. Good coffee.  I knocked off a star but with serious though and debate in my head. Finally I decided to mention it as a learning point for them.  I found plastic wrap in my salad. I get accidents happen. I am okay with things happening and they were very apologetic about it. However, I worry I could have swallowed it though.   All in all a great place to go. I would and will go back. A note to the establishment, just please check your food prep more carefully okay?"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza shop is Chicago somehow made its way to Phoenix Metro and I had no idea.  It took a fellow Yelper telling me about the most recent Yelp Elite Event there this week.  I definitely get out and about the foodie scene around Phoenix and mingle with some foodniks here or there.  This was a complete shock to learn that Giordono's has been open since Dec 2016.  I'm over the shock.  I'll be honest, disappointed that they chose to go so far west.  BUMMER!  I hope that taking that chance is paying off well for them.  Just getting there on a Saturday afternoon from Central  Phoenix took me 32 minutes.  Most of it was highway miles.  The restaurant is in a nice new building just off of the 101/Bell exit in the Peoria Stadium complex.  Just south of the Target shopping plaza.  So, to the question you may be asking me... Was it worth my drive?  Well... HECK yeah.  I enjoyed the glass of Chianti on their menu.  I googled it and it is a very inexpensive wine that I may order for myself.  It paired well with the pizza and marinara sause!  We sampled the calamari and more and the garlic Parmesan fries.  I was quite satisfied with those appetizers while we waited for our pepperoni deep dish pizza.  The pizza was delicious.  I only wished the crust was more buttery.  Was it as good as I remember from my last trip to Chicago... not quite.  But was it delicious?  Yes. definitely a winner.  Good enough to pull me outta arcadia for a trip that far?  Probably not... I liked GE's deep dish just as well.  Return Factor: 30%"}
{"text":"Ordered a medium cheese pizza, chicken wings and bruschetta.   Pizza is deep dish , sauce is good with lots of cheese. Crust has no taste. Will try thin crust next time. Wings were ok. Bruschetta was excellent."}
{"text":"Customers should NOT have to continuously ask to have their drinks refilled, Dominic M. Worst service we have ever had. A server needs to be attentive to his/her table, apologetic if need be, make sure their table is taken care of as best as possible. Walking by and ignoring your customers shows how insecure you are as a server, smart ass remarks when asked how much longer for the food is completely unnecessary.  Luckily the pizza tasted like it does in Chicago.  Everything else was a real disappointment."}
{"text":"The food was delicious as expected. The service was sub-par from everyone we encountered. The hostess honestly seemed like it was possibly her first day? Seemed very confused, asked me my name 3 times, and just seemed like she didn't want to be there. She told me there was a 40 min wait, but i received a text 2 min later saying my table is ready, but she rudely informed me that was a mistake. So I went to the bar to wait, in which it took the bartender 15min to even acknowledge I was there, let alone serve me. When we got our table there was no silverware, and i had to get up and ask for some from a different waiter after our food came. Our waitress kept looking around as if all her other tables were more important... we asked for waters and it took so long our drinks actually arrived first. She also cut me off mid order to talk about the sauce on chicken wings that was on another table across the restaurant. If the food wasn't as good, i will probably not go back. Most likely will only do take out from now on. I guess it's a good thing they all work here in AZ, in not sure any of them would cut it at the Giordano's in Chicago."}
