{"text":"We arrived at Bells last night around 8:45pm prior to them closing. We had a group of 8 and they welcomed us in, and stayed open so we could enjoy dinner. The food was delicious and the customer service was outstanding!  We are putting this place on 'our rotation' when we eat out!  We had a variety of sides with our meals and they were all sooooo good! For dinner We loved the Chicken and Waffles, pulled pork and pulled chicken sandwiches!  You must try the buffalo cauliflower and okra...sounds random... But delicious!!  Last thing.... It's so refreshing to go to a restaurant and witness young people working who are polite and helpful!! Can't wait to go back and try something else on their menu!!"}
{"text":"Best bbq in town so far! Loved the choices of sides and all 4 we got awsome better red beans than lolas Better pork and brisket than pot liquor!  GO THERE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!"}
{"text":"Updated review  So I just got done talking to the owner. And he fixed the problem. It really shows how much the owner cares about the customer experience when they respond to your review less than 10 mins after you submit it. I want to say that I will definitely keep going back and this experience sold me on them being my favorite bbq joint in the valley I found. Thanks again.

{"text":"Yum yum yum! Hands down this is the best BBQ in Vegas.  - Pulled pork, pulled chicken, brisket = flavorful and moist - sides - deviled egg potato salad, mac n cheese, country greens, brussel sprouts and the 4 cheese corn = wonderful wonderful wonderful  The price is much better than other bbq places and so much taster, we won't have BBQ anywhere else. Food came out quick and the server was really friendly."}
{"text":"We decided to stop in after a friend recommended it, and it did not disappoint. Casual, relaxed atmosphere friendly staff and delicious food.  I had the brisket and my husband had the chicken both were very good.  We'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I went in to eat tonight with my family and I asked someone who looked to be the chef if they use MSG (monosodium glutamate) in their dry rub and he said that they do. For anyone who is allergic I thought I'd let you know. There is no need to use that. No thanks."}
{"text":"This place is meat insanity. The best brisket in town, the ribs should be on BBQ Pitmasters!"}
{"text":"We almost never eat out anymore, but we were feeling like some take-out BBQ and Bell's was nearby, so we gave it a go. We ordered ahead of time and our order was just being packed when I arrived 15 minutes later -- that was quick! Everything was remarkably good, but we wish someone warned us that a full rack is easily 2 full meals (for us anyway). We enjoyed the other half of our 1.5 racks the next night for another dinner (and the following day for lunch).  My husband really liked the house sauce and I can definitely recommend the spicy. We had a variety of sides: beans, okra \"fries\", hoppin' john, cole slaw, and greens, all of them a-ok. I guess it's traditional, but there was really no need for the Texas toast, we ended up throwing them out from both dinners (we would rather spend the carbs and fullness on the other yummy stuff). We are really happy Bell's is so close to us and will definitely be back -- maybe we'll actually eat in next time!"}
{"text":"No. Just no. I have tried this place over and over and it's just bad. The ribs are fatty and cheap. This kills it for me. Yes Bells has some barbecue skills but you can't make great barbecue using inferior meat.  The sides are ok. Some better than others some not so good. Macaroni and cheese, red beans and rice I'm looking at you."}
{"text":"I don't usually take the time to leave reviews but this place was amazing! Not only was the food amazing but honestly the staff was what I loved the most. Super friendly staff!! Very attentive!!! They would come over and ask how the food was and even asked if they could refill our drinks for us!! WOW!! Just an overall great place!!"}
{"text":"We just came here for the first time and this is our favorite bbq restaurant west of the Mississippi. The food was excellent. The service was great. We had the pulled pork sandwiches. They were so good on Texas toast. The sides were great. The baked beans are full of pulled pork. The 4 cheese corn lives up to the hype. It was nummy. The Brussels sprouts were interesting. The mac and cheese was very cheesy. The yams were delicious. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone they wants great bbq with yummy sides."}
{"text":"The toast they put the sandwiches on is delicious! They have good food and good prices as well as a wide selection of beers, will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"I went by myself, so I can only speak to what I had.  First off, the family that runs this place is so helpful and accommodating that you feel like a guest rather than a customer.  I ordered the St. Louis ribs.  They were meaty and smoked perfectly. I cannot speak to the sauce as I do not eat sugar, but they did have sriracha available which paired perfectly.  My sides were the fried Brussel sprouts with bacon and the Southern style greens... both delicious!  They brine their own pickles... which rocked!  I don't know whether to try the pork belly or baby backs next time.... maybe I should get both!"}
{"text":"Food is always on point. Standouts are the catfish, ribs and brisket.   My only complaintsis small- they bring the food out one meal at a time so you're sitting there with your food getting cold while everyone else waits for there's."}
{"text":"Brisket is Great!! Even the grilled cheese is Good:) The Corn Coblet is a must to try!"}
{"text":"Amazing! I love BBQ and this place did very well in my options. The beef brisket was soooo good and the sides were great as well."}
{"text":"Best BBQ I've tried in the city.  I ordered the beef ribs with okra fries and 3 cheese mac.  Presentation of food was great and everything was delish! My fiancé ordered the pulled chicken with BBQ beans and corn on the cob.  He's a very picky eater, but he loved everything he ordered and said its the best BBQ he's ever had.  I'm big on customer service and I was very impressed by the employees there. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I just enjoyed a delicious BBQ chicken meal while my children had pasta and grilled cheese. (Kids eat free Tuesday evenings).   The food was yummy and  the portions were very generous.   They had so many sides to choose from. The potato salad was great.   I recommend Bell's BBQ based on the food and the great service we hAd."}
{"text":"Delicious and flavorful! Large portions and the cheese corn was amazing! Great dinner enjoyed by all!!"}
{"text":"Great food, generous portions. I had the shrimp po'boy and was not disappointed with the amount of shrimp. Hubby had St. Louis ribs which were darkish.  Greens are amazing. Thanks Bell!"}
{"text":"The staff was friendly and we were served quickly which was awesome since we were here on a lunch break.  Brisket was tender, flavorful and lean which I loved. Red beans and rice were spicy and yummy. Atmosphere was great too, I def recommend this place!"}
{"text":"For a newly opened place Bells bbq is getting into the groove it seems like. Walking in your hit by the smell of the smoker going. Had both the pork and chicken and both were succulent and tasty. The sides of mac and cheese and mashed potatoes i tried were good as well. Wish i didnt get it togo as i think that might have  spoiled some of the fresh from the oven goodness. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The pork sandwich was more fat then anything else. Half of it was inedible. The macaroni and cheese was soupy and watered down. Got a side salad with old dried out cucumbers and balsamic dressing with no flavor. Once again an inedible item. Not to mention they were out of some of the sides i really wanted.  Unfortunately i didn't have the same experience as other yelpers and wont be coming back here."}
{"text":"Threw us out because we have a certified service dog. Really really sad!!  Will never come back or recommend. Staff was terribly rude and owner yelled at us and made a scene. Bad business for small business!! This is the FIRST time we have ever had this experience. How awful and really unprofessional this owner was towards us. She said she was having a bad day. She didn't make ours any better. Always have to be cautious of folks that don't love animals!!"}
{"text":"The food is great! I got take out and it was fast tasty and affordable . Loved the greens , half  chicken and BBQ sauce!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Large portions, delicious meat, and a huge array of side dishes to choose from. Get the crispy Brussels sprouts, they are salty and so, so good. The atmosphere is chill, and the staff is really friendly and helpful. Overall I totally recommend Bell's BBQ, but make sure you come hungry!"}
{"text":"Along with the brisket, the veggie choices are favorites. Their fried okra is prepared differently and congress out light and crispy and great!"}
{"text":"My family of 4 came into eat tonight. Everything was delicious. Pulled pork, ribs, chopped brisket. So good. The Brussel sprouts were AMAZING. And the service by Ashley and Blyle was as good as the food. Super cute place, great food and service. We will be back."}
{"text":"Welcome new edition to the Anthem area, great BBQ, great deserts, kid friendly. Nice people"}
{"text":"RATING: B + SERVICE: C - AMBIANCE: A  OVERVIEW: Walking into this place it was DEAD so there was no reason I should not have been given the attention and time I deserved! This fact was made up by the awesome food that was brought out to my table. Ordered one of my go to meals when eating BBQ, pulled pork sandwich! The presentation on this bad boy blew me away! Definitely not your typical sandwiches here! No no no the meat you order is packed in between a Texas toast and topped with some fried onions! Also loved the different variances in BBQ sauces that they have to offer. Definitely will be returning, food is totally there hopefully service will soon be up there as well."}
{"text":"Just as reference, I use to own Fat Tuesdays Kitchen in Delavan, Wi we closed but I still have reviews here on yelp and feel like I can comment on good or bad flavors.  Beef brisket had ABSOLUTELY NO BARK whatsoever, and it was sliced, part of the reason you slice is to get that great smoky bark flavor in every bite, mine had none.  Beef was dry and no smoke flavor at all. Tasted like roast beef with no seasonings.  Referring to ribs, I have to assume they were suppose to be smoked but again ABSOLUTELY NO SMOKE RING, and if they came off the charcoal grill,  that flavor was also missing.  Tough.  Now for positives, ABSOLUTELY ONE OF THE BEST POTATO SALADS I HAVE EVER TASTED!  Black eye peas were good, and the Pork Belly was a little tough, but it did have some smoky flavor.   Don't know if I would order again, but if I did I will stick to sides.  Just keeping it REAL!"}
{"text":"Nice place.BBQ a little on the dry side. Quick service, reasonable prices. Good selection of sides. Day we visited ribs were still cooking & potatoes was not ready. Willing to give a second chance."}
{"text":"I love this BBQ place. Great location for me and always great service. Brussels Sprouts are always on point.  Piggy sauce is a guilty pleasure all on its own. Meat is always tender and they have a great variety of different BBQ sauce"}
{"text":"One of the best barbecue places I've been to. Great location. Good value. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Went to Bell's for the 1st time. Service was great and everyone was friendly. BBQ was tasty and the presentation was on point. All I have to say is check out the sweet jars, that is if you have room left in the tank!!"}
{"text":"Just bought St Louis ribs, pork belly and brisket a few minutes ago.  The cashier, Ashley M, based on the receipt, a young lady with red hair was having a bad day I guess because she was rude and did not even try to smile.  You work in food service you should have tried to fake a smile.  We live close by but will go back this restaurant ever again.  My son corrected me.  Her hair was red.  But the food was good."}
{"text":"Took the family to this new place as we drive by everyday... The food was absolutely \"FANTASTIC\", i had the chicken & waffles which is a newer item on the menu and it was great, the desserts were fantastic as well! I will come here every Sunday after church with the family.  EXCELLENT PLACE TO EAT!"}
{"text":"The service here is top notch. The bbq was great.  I had the Pork Belly (on the advise of the employee) and my wife had the Half Chicken. Both tasted very good. The place was packed when we came in, but we were able to find a spot.  We had the Caramelized Banana Pudding for desert. Wow is all I can say about the desert.  The only thing we didn't love about this place are the sides.  We look forward to coming back and trying other items off of their menu."}
{"text":"Nice surprise. Great southern bbq ambiance. Simple, real and comfortable. Service was as warm and sincere as it gets. Ordered brisket, porky bellies, tatertots, Mac and cheese their special corn and a blue moon. All good food.   Brisket had a smokey, not overdone flavor. It welcomed the final touch of your pick of the cool sauces. Watch it, some are spicy.  Lots of sauce selections.  Pick bellies we well marbled. I don't like that. But, they were prepared well. I was just adventuring into a new food and found it was not my thing.   Think: the easy, spiritual, down home feeling that you get from good blues music...that's the feeling of this place. A good dinner is made up of the look and feel of where you're sitting, the flavors and then the feel from it all out together by the people. They nailed it here. It's now on my shortlist for go-to food.   I don't know for sure but if feels family-owned, family and friend operated. The sincerity of it all just doesn't come from franchised places. This was all about the warmth.   Nice!  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I LOVE THEIR SAUCE that they served on the side, and this dry rub is delicious! I placed my order over the phone three minutes to closing time, and Twila (hope I spelled that correctly) was nice enough to accommodate me, even though I know better than to order near closing time. She was so helpful and informative and I let her order her suggestions for me, telling her I was open-minded. The half-chicken was perfection with juicy meat and I could not eat it all. One huge beef rib was so tasty, I just wish there were more meat on this particular one, as I like beef better than chicken or pork, but that is the way it is with beef ribs. I had the zucchini medley like a salad-type zingy tasty treat, charred collard greens? which were delicious and I dipped them in bbq sauce. There was Frank's bbq sauce-type fried spicy cauliflower and a thick piece of bread. My favorites were the key-lime pie and the cheesecake desserts. They were each served in real glass mason jars. I thought to myself that this cannot be a cost-effective way for a restaurant to serve its tasty treats, but my homemade candle-making will appreciate it! Overall, I LOVED the sauce and the rubbed rib flavor, and the EXCELLENT SERVICE will keep me a loyal customer. We need more restaurants like this! Congrats!"}
{"text":"The last stop for us.  This is the thing with Bells for us.  The sides are great, the desserts are great, but the meat is ok, and always covered in onions or something.  The chefs and staff is great, and come here if you like sides. They own the market in that, but it's called Bells BBQ, not bells Sides and onion."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service! Their sides are all delicious and provide such a diversity of choice! The chicken and brisket are always cooked to perfection and if you order them thru Uber Eats they pack everything very well, including sauces. Don't forget to try their sweet jars too, Smores is TDF!!"}
{"text":"Great food!! Great customer service!!  Had the beef ribs and they were awesome.   large and meaty.  The sides are to die for I had the cheese crusted corn on the cob and Mac n cheese.  OMG!!!  My spouse had the brisket and  Mac n cheese n Brussel sprouts. It also was wonderful!!  Highly recommend !!"}
{"text":"Starting this out by saying that the meat was delicious. I got the pulled pork and it was moist and melted in my mouth.   I got three sides:    *Smashed Potatoes w/Smoke Roasted Garlic      Tasted two days old as if they were in the fridge and then they warmed them up in the microwave and put them in the box. Also, garlic? There was none.    *Crispy Brussel Sprouts       Drenched in so much oil; from the frying, that I could have squeezed it out into a pan and fried something else in it.    *Mac and Cheese       Eh. Super bland. Nothing to write home about.   But the meat, was delicious. Yum. Three stars for the great meat and amazing barbecue sauce.  Also, I lived in St. Louis for the last three years so barbecue was a staple in my house. Bummed on the sides but the actual barbecued meat and barbecue sauce rivals the St. Louis/ Kansas City barbecue.   Will try the ribs next time."}
{"text":"Everything I had was awesome! Pulled pork, brisket, pulled chicken, ribs, all my sides and my waitress! Her name was Twyla!"}
{"text":"Decided to try some BBQ other than Lucille's. What a score with this place. Food was excellent. I had the pulled pork, BBQ beans (the best ever with a little spices kick) and I also had the Hot Tots. These aren't so hot but they are gooooood.  My meal was less than $14. Staff was friendly and always available. I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Yum!  Everything we've had here is delicious and we ordered one of their party packs for our son's bday party.  We got a TON of food (really generous portions) for $99, thanks Bell's BBQ!"}
{"text":"We had such a great experience here! Been to several BBQ restaurants in Memphis, Texas and Kentucky with not expecting much of this restaurant. This restaurant now exceeds those famously known restaurants we dined at! Customer service is top notch! We will definitely come back here! Their Smoked Chicken and brisket is bomb!! Yummy!"}
{"text":"5 stars. Good bye famous Dave's. Will miss you. I referred so many people I should eat free. Haha. Bomb a$$ food."}
{"text":"Had the rib meat sandwich and I'm hooked, the sandwich alone was a meal, add the potato salad and I was a happy camper.  The service was great, my cup was never empty, even though it's a self serve beverage fountain I never had to get up to refill.  Try the buffalo cauliflower, you won't be disappointed. Can't wait to go back and try everything else."}
{"text":"Sad to do this but Belle's has taken a drastic turn for the worse.  The last 3 times I've been there, the ribs have been seized on the bone and today was no exception.  It's just not good.  On top of that the mac & cheese had no cracker crumbs on top ( which is what makes it so good ), and the \"pickles\" were cut to at least 3/4\" thick ... not sure who they're catering to with that .  I'm not sure what has happened ... maybe putting too many irons in the fire - I see that they're now doing breakfast ... who is going there for breakfast?  Maybe trying to do too much?  I loved this place when it first opened but I can't see myself going back here - at least for a long time until they sort out the issues.  For the price, it needs to be much better."}
{"text":"Very impressed! We ordered take out and food was delicious which isn't always the case when it has to travel. We ordered several different items from the menu and all were very good! Their desserts were delicious as well! This will definitely be my first choice for take out in the future and I will be visiting to eat in soon!"}
{"text":"Definitely with the money!!!!  Best barbecue ever!!!  Pulled pork sandwich is to die for and the Brussels sprouts are delicious.  Even my daughter is eating it and she doesn't like anything!!!!!!  The dessert is good too, key lime pie in a jar!!!  Best idea ever!!!!!   Service is good and staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"I've ordered here using Bite Squad for about 6 months or so and have never been disappointed!! Flavorful meat falling-off-the-bone ribs, catfish is moist and meaty covered with cornmeal (NOT batter or breadcrumbs thankfully)!!! Smashed potatoes delicious and the greens are perfectly seasoned and cooked right,  oxtails with blackeyed peas oh lawd!!!  The deserts in the small mason jars are so good!! I have quite a few that I need to return lollll I order about twice a month and going to today!"}
{"text":"This place is Awesome... Balil was very nice and explained the menu very well.. I would definitely recommend this place to family and friends."}
{"text":"So they were out of ribs and brisket and the prices were bit high for the plates. Then there was the 30 minute wait where I watched another family of 3 who ordered after us were served before us. The food was ok but nothing spectacular and the chicken was dry. Guess we caught them at a bad time because even the servers looked confused as to what they were doing."}
{"text":"This All-American BBQ restaurant is a great place to have lunch! You can chose from a variety of meats and sides. The brisket here is right on point, it's super moist and delicious, I highly recommend it. I tried the chicken here, they give a good portion of meat, but I thought it was kind of dry and there wasn't anything special about it. For sides, you can pick anything from mashed potatoes, to four cheese corn, to mac n cheese, to buffalo cauliflower, to deviled egg potato salad and so much more. Their bbq sauce is pretty great. I'm not a fan of bbq sauce, but I have to say, it tasted well with everything. This place also has a wide variety of unique beers. The prices of the dishes here are reasonably cheap for bbq. Great food, great interior design, and great service:)"}
{"text":"Really good BBQ but it's not automatically served w/a warmed up BBQ sauce:(. It would have been four stars if it the meat was served automatically with a warmed up sauce that permeates the meat they & thru w/ taste.  Dry rub meat. You'll have to put a cold sauce (sweet or spicy) on the meat on your own. The toast was hard and the blackeyed peas rice mixture was not soft, a bit undercooked. The potato salad , banana pudding desert, and everything else was delicious.:)"}
{"text":"This no doubt is the best bbq place i've ever been to. I am not a big fan of bbq so this is saying a lot. They're chicken tenders and mac and cheese are beyond anything i've ever had before (better than chick fil a for sure)  My family and I come here at least once a week and the service is excellent and I can bug the staff for anything as much as I want and they are always sweet and serve with a smile because they are happy to be there. Dont settle for bbq anywhere else, Go eat here for sure!!"}
{"text":"Omg!  The only thing yummier than the food here is James our cashier and food server.  Excellent food, wonderful service, nicest people!!!  Can't say enough great things.  This will surely be one of my favorite casual places to frequent.  Highly recommended!!!!!"}
{"text":"I had the pulled chicken, brisket, with buffalo cauliflower and BBQ beans as my sides. The BBQ sauces are all of the vinegary variety, more Carolina than I prefer. The chicken was a bit dry, which would be fixed if there was a BBQ sauce I cared for. The beans had a lot of meat in them and the sauce was good in the beans. The brisket didn't seem smoked at all, but it was still moist. Definitely was looking for a more smoky flavor for all of it."}
{"text":"Was really looking forward to trying a new BBQ place and it was near my work. Great customer service for sure. The cheesy corn is terrific, they even have a really great side salad but I really didn't enjoy too much their tri tip or the BBQ sauce that came with it. I know they have other sauce options, I certainly like to try them again."}
{"text":"First of all, the service was good and the staff were very friendly. The place was clean and very spacious. This rating is based mainly on the food. I wasn't impressed with the meats. I got the pulled pork, brisket and pork belly. They were too dry (except for the pork belly since it had a lot of fat). When I reheated the leftovers the next day for a very short while, they were so dry that I tossed them out. It's unfortunate that barbeque places here can't serve juicy meat with crispy edges. That was never a problem when I lived in California where I got delicious barbecue. I don't know what the problem is here. As far as sides, the mac & cheese was really good. The red rice & beans were just OK."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today. Great service and friendly staff. Ribs are fall off the bone. Not my favorite, I prefer the bite and pull rib but I'm giving a five star rating because of the flavor was yum. Also the sides (crispy Brussels sprouts were delicious and the banana pudding was perfect."}
{"text":"CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS EXCELLENT!! Smiles upon walking in and more than thorough explanation of how to order. Thank you guys...Chicken was perfectly crisp with the inside moist. Mac n cheese and the 5 fries were the right choice for sides. Presentation of the food was clean and appetizing."}
{"text":"Ordered ribs , Brussel spouts, fried okra , fries, baked beans ,potato salad, Cole slaw. The items that were fried were too salty ,if not for that ,it would've been good. Potato salad was tasty  The service was slow ,they messed up on my order so I had to wait  15 min longer while my friends ate . The pumpkin dessert in a little jar was really good .The ribs were a little dry ,tough too . Maybe I'll wait a few months and give it another try."}
{"text":"Delicious Bbq! Great place to grab and go or sit in! We had pulled pork sandwiches, brisket sandwiches and even tried a shrimp po boy.. All were seasoned just right and really yummy. Staff were super helpful and friendly. Homemade pickles were awesome- just wish there were more than three in my box . Need to get a whole jar for the fam I guess. Haven't tried the desserts yet- stuffed from the meal, but the menu is so tempting!! We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ in the Henderson area.  We ordered the pulled pork and ribs.  My husband loved the ribs and my pulled pork was very good.  In my opinion, the sides are just as important as the meats.  We had the pickled coleslaw which was different and just fair, the Mac n cheese  and okra fires which were very good, and the beans which were fair.  The ribs were cooked perfectly and meat just fell off the bone.  We ordered the s'more which comes in a small glass jar.  Although good, don't expect typical s'more flavor.  It's more of a gourmet s'more.  Very nice family owned restaurant, but they still have some kinks to work out.  I got the wrong plate, we had a missing side, and were overcharged for an extra drink, however they fixed the issues(we didn't bring up the overcharge).    They are only open for dinner right now, but are planning on expanding their hours in the next few weeks.  Definitely worth a trip to support a local family and get your BBQ fix."}
{"text":"The ribs were really good I like the baby back's more then the beef ribs they were more tender I thought the barbecue sauce was excellent the corn on the cob was a little disappointing he was like maybe not ready to be picked and cooked and eaten it was very thin didn't get much out of it, but everything else was good dessert was good and I have to give it four stars."}
{"text":"Worst BBQ experience ever. I'm not that picky when it comes to smoked meats, I love them all. Usually spicy BBQ sauce can cover any subpar BBQ.   Cons: Service was not friendly, did not greet us, took order and looked miserable. Asked if we wanted to add a tip, when person taking order didn't do anything to earn it. Screwed up garlic mashed with potato salad, ignored me standing at front counter until another employee pointed me out. Price was way over inflated for what we received. Save your money and go to Dickie's for better BBQ or make the drive to Rollin' Smoke or John Mull's for the best BBQ in Las Vegas. Food: Everything was bland, temperatures and textures were wrong. Brisket was spongey, didn't feel like I was eating meat. Sandwiches were extremely stingy with meat, sides: mashed potatoes, egg salad, mac & cheese, coleslaw were all bland. Not sure how that managed to mess up everything they served. Pros: restaurant is extremely clean, in a good location, presentation of food was nice."}
{"text":"Place is clean and well decorated. We had the brisket and shrimp po boy. Big portions. Po boy was great. Sides were good. Brisket was DRY. Little to no marbling. Even sauce couldn't save it."}
{"text":"So I don't have much of an interest in ordering up outside BBQ, as I'm confident in my own S..T.  That said, I was in a pinch tonight as I worked and had a small army coming over for Game 1 of the World Series. Decided to risk it and give this little joint a try! Called in my order and headed down for pick up, which they said would be ready in 20. Showed up, met the peeps and was immediately impressed with the place, old school Southern BBQ joint! Payed up (Great Value) went home, set up and was Blown Away!!! Ordered pretty much everything on the menu and to the item...was Blown Away!!  Not so impressed with my own S..T anymore! These Guys Rock!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"What a gem and thank you Yelp for pointing out a great new restaurant.  I swear these were the best ribs I have had in years and the sides are incredible too.   Others had the pulled pork and we will be back for take out and more lunches and dinners for sure.  Prices were reasonable and staff fantastic.  It is impressive that this is the dream of a world traveled chef and when you see those fantastic deserts you will be tempted to go straight to the deserts.  Help us keep this business in the Anthem neighborhood by supporting them and call in your orders for take out too.  We personally took several menus to hand out to our neighbors.  On comment as some though the prices a little high.   This is not a fast food joint and try buying this meat at the grocery store, marinating it, and preparing as they do for the price.   You get what you are paying for and since we eat out most of the week being seniors, I assure you we think the value is great."}
{"text":"These guys are amazing. I love the food and I Enjoy their BBQ. It's melt in your mouth good and I absolutely am willing to wait in line an hour just to get something some pulled pork and Mac n cheese. Yummy"}
{"text":"We were driving through the area and decided to stop in for some spur of the moment BBQ- and we were not disappointed. My husband and I shared the brisket with a side of pork belly, mac n' cheese, fried pickles and a caramelized banana pudding sweet jar.  The portion size was generous, so I'm glad we shared, and the mustard BBQ sauce was delicious (other sauces were okay, but nothing special).  There were only a few other patrons, so the staff went out of their way to make us feel comfortable- bringing us refills, etc. Overall, I wouldn't hesitate to go back when in that neck of the woods."}
{"text":"Ordered pork baby back ribs.. potato salad, cole slaw, Cameron's chicken.. French fries,and hot tots for my family., They loved every bite! My husband is very picky about ribs and complains that most places around here aren't that good. So now we have a place to go..The pickles and Texas toast were good too."}
{"text":"Our first time there and everything was outstanding. Found the place listed with Groupon deals and got a 30% discount. Groupon had some wierd hours posted so called Bell's, left message, and Stephanie (owner) called us back with the correct hours of operation. Very good BBQ, house sauce was interesting, not typical BBQ sauce, had some unique spice hints that were perfect. Had a very nice chat with Stephanie who would not reveal the secret receipe."}
{"text":"No complaints here, good BBQ. Had the pulled pork, good portions, not dry good n moist, cheesey grits were tasty. Need to save room for desert nextime they look awesome."}
{"text":"Today was my first, and last visit to Bell's BBQ.  My first clue should have been that they didn't have HOT LINKS on the menu.  What kind of BBQ place doesn't have hot links?   I ordered brisket.  I was absolutely flabbergasted when the man carving the meat CUT THE BARK OFF the brisket and threw it in the trash!  They claim to \"hickory smoke\" the meat for 14 hours.  There was absolutely NO SMOKE RING on the meat.  How could this be?  Last, the brisket was 100% lean - not a speck of fat anywhere.  Since fat means flavor, dry and boring is the BEST thing I can say about it.  There was little to no smoke flavor.   While bbq is never cheap, their prices were a little high.  They don't have any 2 or 3 meat combo meals.  If one wanted to try more than a single meat, the option was to purchase a full order of another protein on the side.  It was nearly $60 for myself and my 83 year old Uncle.  We both had two meats, he had a dessert, no drinks. The guys working there were super friendly, even guiding me to their door, over the phone.  (A bit hidden in the shopping center). The girl at the front counter wasn't rude or anything, just not as friendly as the guys.  She wasn't helpful at all, even though I explained that this was my first time.   Sorry Bell's.  you won't be seeing me again."}
{"text":"Here today and the rude girl with glasses taking my order did Nothing but rush me and I was going to order more food to take home for my kids,,  their loss. I will stop someplace else."}
{"text":"My wife and I loved this BBQ place! I had the spare ribs with smoked collard greens and fried okra fries. They were great! This place is also great for my wife and I since we live in Henderson, but I would recommend the drive for anyone.  Seems to be a family owned place and you can feel it when you walk in along with the great service!"}
{"text":"As a SoCalian who loves Roscoes and after living in Missouri for 10 years, I missed this type of comfort food. I found the soul food sides of greens and Mac n cheese a nice change to anything on a Eastern. I had the chicken and waffles and it was a large serving, enough for 2 meals. The service was good as well as the food. Everyone in our house loved this place because it reminded them of the soul type food we enjoyed in Missouri."}
{"text":"Have tries many bbq places in las Vegas and haven't found one that was to my liking until i tried this one! The food is amazing there are a lot of different and unique side choices. I tried pork belly for the first time here and i was mind blown. The skin was crispy but, the inside was juicy and fatty. The house pickles are amazing and so is the desserts. They serve all of their food on a baking sheet which i thought was super cool and unique. The desserts are served in mason jars that you can keep. I recommend this place to anyone who is looking for delicious bbq !!!"}
{"text":"This is only going towards the food.   It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't amazing. Meat was tender but not fall off the bone.  The smokiness was lacking.  The sauce tastes mediocre the house sauce at least.  Beans and rice were okay.  Coleslaw was well balanced."}
{"text":"We drove a bit to get here!   Outside was not to inviting!   Pricing was good! Selection was great.  The young girl at register.. was a little clueless. Need someone who knows BBQ.  Food came and we enjoyed it!   The sides were really good.  1. Green fried tomatoes  2. Fries (4-5 different cuts) 3. 4 cheese corn  4. Potato salad (my fav)  5. Beans (beefy)  Sauce is good!   I got the brisket sandwich. Love the toast but the sandwich was a little dry. Not sure what they could do to give it a little more flavor.  I added coleslaw and cheese of course BBQ sauce..still needs something."}
{"text":"So when I ate here when it first opened, it was really good. Tonight, I'm not sure what happened. The mac n cheese was meh. Pretty flavorless like some of the other posts say. The pulled chicken was dry & so was the pork belly and the fried okra seemed like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for a long time. The staff is nice and so is the decor but the food was very underwhelming, especially for the price."}
{"text":"I went there a few days ago and I was hoping for the best.  I moved here from Philly 18 months ago and was really missing some good old fashioned BBQ and soul food.   This was not the place.  I ordered the chopped chicken and it was good that I asked about how it was served.   I like a lot of sauce and she assured me that she would supply extra.  The potatoes in the potato salad were under cooked and the greens were kind of bland.  I will continue my search as I am here to stay."}
{"text":"NEW PLACE in HENDERSON!!! And it's OOOOH SOOOOOO GOOOOOD!    Bell's BBQ on Eastern, near Sunridge Heights intersection.    We tried Bell's and were quite impressed. We both had the Pulled Pork, reallllly good~ nicely prepared, fully cooked juicy & tender. Could have been hotter, temperature wise for my tastes, however my husband didn't seem to mind. We both ate all of it so it obviously was fine.    Typical BBQ SELECTIONS, ribs, pork belly, brisket & Chicken & they also have a kids menu ~ and nice dessert options if you have any room left to indulge in banana pudding, creme brûlée, Jordon's Cheesecake and more just can't  remember them all.     Lots of sides to choose from, smashed potatoes (YUMMO!) , corn on the cob (nice! not over cooked with a smidgen of butter, 2 different types of cold slaw, pickled & Caesar style (hubs had the pickled & quite enjoyed it) southern prepared greens (again my Hubs ate these & thought they were Gr8!) The sides we didn't try, smashed yams, Okra fries, 3 cheese Mac n' Cheese I am sure I have left something out but as you can see Lots to choose from~    Nice interior with booths & tables to accommodate 70 guests, nice strings of lights draped from the ceiling all add to a pleasant dining environment. All the servers genuinely friendly greeting us upon entering AND exiting       Currently just open for dinner, have take out ordering, catering will offer lunch after they complete their soft opening. Everything went like clockwork for our visit, so if your in the mood 4 BBQ, stop by Bell's & prepare to carb load!!"}
{"text":"I was very happy with the food I got through UberEATS. I orders beef ribs, mac and cheese and fried okra. Wow, I have had homemade southern stroke food before and this comes close. Very delicious and I will definitely eat it again. The delivery was super fast. I believe in 15 mins! That's awesome!"}
{"text":"Walked into this cute little Texas style place after reading great reviews. We were not disappointed. Ordered 12 rack of baby back ribs, roasted Brussels sprouts, and Cole slaw. There was more than enough for husband and I to share, and still had 2 ribs left over. Extremely meaty ribs, not dripping with sauce, just the way we like it. Extra sauce is on table to add if you wanted.  Ribs were very tender and succulent, and sides were tasty. Cole slaw had just right amount of dressing, and sprouts were crispy. The ribs are served on Top of garlic toast, and ribs were covered in crunchy onion rings. Only thing missing was. TV to watch sports on, but the manager, Eric, assured us that was being installed shortly.  Service was pleasant and quick.  Glad to have Bells BBQ in neighborhood   Went back 2 weeks later, 1 1/2 hours before they closed at 7 on a Sunday, and was disappointed. Food and service not as good. They were putting up lots of to go orders, and our food took very long to come out, and was not as good as first experience. Will try them in a few weeks before final verdict."}
{"text":"Came into the restaurant right around 5 pm and was greeted by the friendly workers. Being the first time I tried the pulled pork which was delicious. It's a little on the pricey side, but for the size of the portions it was worth it. Even though I live on the southwest side of town. I'll be recommending this place for great BBQ."}
{"text":"When I walked in, the restaurant smelled amazing! I thought for sure I had found my new favorite BBQ place. Sadly, I was mistaken.   I ordered the Brisket, Mac & cheese and fries. I liked the fries because they came with a few different kinds. I've never seen a place give you curly, sweet potato, waffle and regular fries together! As far as the brisket and Mac & cheese...they were decent. Nothing special. To be honest, they both seemed a little dry.   The location is nice, in a little shopping center near the corner of Eastern and Sunridge Heights. They have plenty of indoor seating and picnic tables outside.   Brisket with two sides $14.95"}
{"text":"Came here a few weeks ago and I was not very impressed. The pulled pork was good and the baked beans were awesome. The chicken is very dry, the Mac n cheese watery and just not worth all the money they charge and that I spent. I don't believe this place is my cup of tea, but I'm just one person. The customer service here however was awesome!"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try.  I called in an order for brisket meal comes with 2 sides and 6 baby back rib meal with 2 sides.  I read everyone's post about the banana pudding , so I ordered that also to go.  Got there and my order was ready.   I specifically asked for EXTRA SAUCE on the side and the worker told me yes it's in there.    Are you getting where I'm going with this story?  No sauce at all in my to go bag.  Food was good, but I like to know what the ribs would taste like if there wAs sauce.    I normally give 5 stars but I am disappointed about the specific question I asked.     I also gave him a tip for my to go order that I thought was more than the average person would tip for a to go order."}
{"text":"Tried Bell's on Thursday and came back on Friday!  Spread the word and ordered for family on Friday who loved it just as much as I did!  Everything we tried was fantastic!  Sandwiches, meals, sides, etc - was all great!  You must must must try the sweet jars for dessert!    Do not miss this place!!!"}
{"text":"I'm from Texas... so I don't expect to get anything like back home. As long as I can get a decent fix.. I'm good.  I was craving some sausage links but they don't have any. Not even on the menu. . But they do have an awesome menu... lots of stuff to choose from which is why I will be back!  Pulled Chicken Sandwich- The chicken is served folded in Texas Toast style of bread... the bread/toast was good... and the serving size of the whole thing was really big. They definitely didn't skimp on the chicken. Unfortunately the chicken was sooooooo dry. I used a couple of their sauces to liven it up a little.  Brisket- Very dry. But luckily they have great sauces which again helped to liven it up.  Pork Belly- My partner absolutely loved it.... and that's a big deal! Flavor was all there, no dryness!  4 Cheese Crusted Corn Coblet  (side)- This is an absolute must! Very rich and yummy... not messy, comes on a stick, easy to eat.  Okra Fries (side)- Delicious! We were a little skeptical as their appearance is kinda blehhh. Paired with their homemade ranch was a home run. You don't even need the ranch.  3 Cheese Mac (side)- Disappointed. It was more like a very bland cheese pasta off the kids menu in an Italian restaurant. The kids scarfed it down. I guess I was expecting some awesome mac n cheese you would usually get at any BBQ Joint. I wouldn't get it again.  Sweet Jars!!- We ordered the \"Aunt Linda's Red Velvet\". Wow! We were fighting over bites. So moist, the perfect ending. Served in a cute mason jar. This will cure any sweet tooth cravings. Even if you don't want BBQ or anything to eat... stop by and get you or someone else a Sweet Jar! We are going back this weekend to try some other ones.  Sauces- Their BBQ sauce is an absolute win! It reminded me of one of my favorite sauces from back home. They have a great variety of other sauces too which were all good."}
{"text":"Go hungry, they give you a lot of food. The food was good and the service was too. Wish they had draft beer, but they do have beer! So that's good."}
{"text":"Had very high hopes for this restaurant & was really excited to try it. There were so many items on the menu I wanted to try but the items I did choose I ended up being sadly disappointing at this restaurant. Based on my experience I don't know how it's gotten so many 5 star reviews. Maybe it was an off night for some of the food items. Ordered the pulled pork plate but I swore I was given pulled chicken. It comes with 2 sides & I opted for the Brussels Sprouts (which I love) but sadly they had been sitting around & were dry, burnt, very salty & bitter. Second side I opted for Mac N Cheese & you could tell it had been sitting around for awhile. It had no flavor. Meat was just OK - nothing special. I did order the Caramelized Banana Pudding which was delicious though. Another dining partner ordered the catfish & said that as extremely salty as well. Some of my other dinning partners ordered different items than I did & they said their meals were great & that they would go back again. I honestly don't know if I would go back. I've had better food @ Lucille's for a little less money. Wishing I had a better experience as the venue is close to home."}
{"text":"Loved this place! I had the BBQ chicken, which was perfect! Mashed potatoes were one of the best I've had that I didn't make myself! Mac n cheese was cheesy & delicious, same with the corn! My friend had the brisket sandwich & couldn't stop until it was gone haha! The main dishes were so good I had to try a dessert - cute little cheesecake in a jar & it was amazing!! Can't wait to try more! & the service was top notch! Very clean & I love the way the restaurant is set up & decorated!"}
{"text":"Had the pork BBQ sandwich. The meat was so good tasted truly slow cooked, like something homemade. This sandwich was on a monster sized delicious Texas toast bread. Ill be back for more of this BBQ.   Also the staff was super nice, always good for business."}
{"text":"Solid. Baby backs were the stand out, though we tried brisket, pulled pork and chicken strips. The fried Brussels sprouts are not to be missed. Going to try the St Louis ribs next time!"}
{"text":"I'm not a bbq guy.  I typically dont go for ribs or the like.  But this place has changed my mind.  Extremely good ribs and a spicy bbq sauce that is out of this world.  I dont like bbq sauce... Usually.  But this place has the kind of sauce that you ask for extra so you can save it for future meals."}
{"text":"This place is a good option for BBQ in Henderson, I prefer Big B's Texas BBQ for  baby-back ribs , but this place has pretty good chicken tenders and pulled pork."}
{"text":"We both got the 5 pc St. Louis ribs. They were so big I could only eat 3! The sides were great also, the baked beans had a lot of brisket mixed in it. We are definitely going back."}
{"text":"Glad to have a BBQ joint in the neighborhood.  Pros:  nice selection of brews (Picking up a togo order? Sip on a cold one and enjoy the time.) and good BBQ.  Cons:  sides sit a bit too long (crunchy brussel sprouts are soft, not crunchy).  And the togo order was packaged with the Texas toast under the entrees, leaving it soggy.  Another pro:  dessert!  Comes packaged in a glass bell jar (return it for a $1) - the banana pudding was good!  Nicely done BBQ and really enjoyed your sauce.  Welcome to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"If brisket is your first menu item, and the most expensive, I will drive 30 miles out of my way to give you a try. The brisket wasn't their best item on the menu, but I'd keep Bell's in mind if I were on this side of town again.  Menu features the choice of a meat plate (8oz with two sides, house-made pickles, and Texas toast) or a sandwich, and you can add on additional meats (~4oz?), as they don't have multi-meat combo plates. Sides of mac and greens were just okay.  PORK BELLY: The highlight. Was surprised to see it on the menu, but it ended up being the best thing. Tender, falling apart, juicy, and full of flavor. Wish I'd just ordered this! BRISKET: Close, but no cigar. Nicely seasoned with visible smoke ring, but the meat itself was dry and hard in spots. I suspect this is because it wasn't all that fresh, being that they're new and not quite so busy yet. I'd give this another try on a future visit. PULLED PORK: No. This was the oddest meat in the meal, cut into odd pieces and drowning in sauce, portion also seemed smaller than the others. Meat was very tender but sauce was overly sweet, did not care for this at all. RIBS: Got the St. Louis style, add-on. They're large and meaty, but BF found them a bit too fatty for his liking. I'd get them again, but kind of wish they came sauced, as the cups provided for takeout make it an odd fit for dipping the bone without making a mess. Pleasantly surprised with these!  DESSERTS. I'm not big on desserts, but I couldn't resist the cute jar presentation! Opted for the cashier's favorite, the S'mores. The graham cracker crust bits were on the clumpy side, but the rich, chocolately mousse tasted just like hot chocolate and the browned marshmallow fluff on top was nicely subtle.  Service was welcoming and friendly, interior is clean and modern with country décor touches- love the strands of lights above the dining room! Rounding up for potential, will come back as they get settled in and work out the kinks."}
{"text":"First off I am not a BBQ afficianado, however I love my barbeque. If you love authentic bbq Go to big b's BBQ or pot liquor. We decided to try this place out and were dissapointed.....In my lifetime of eating BBQ I never asked, I wish it was served atop Texas toast or DAMN!! if this was topped with fried onions it would really satisfy me.....The garnishments were uncalled for and irrelevelent.....Regardless of the un needed garnishments, the meat is bland and barely smokey......The smashed potatoes dry and while garlicky, lacked seasoning, heavy cream, salt and butter"}
{"text":"A new BBQ joint opened up nearby so I had to try it.    We stopped in for lunch to feed our appetite.  It's located off of Eastern at Sunridge Heights.  Very easy to find.  The dining area is open and clean.  We were greeted immediately as we were browsing the menu.    I decided to try their chopped brisket sandwich, cheese grits and caesar slaw.  I liked how they cut the Texas toast into a pita like envelope.  The meat is then stuffed into the bread.  Clever! It was good but not memorable.  I had a taste of my husband pulled pork sandwich and had the same thought.  I wish the meat had more of a smokey flavor like other BBQ places.  The cheese grits, however, were so delicious! I loved every bite and could just eat the grits as my meal.   The caesar slaw was also just ok in my book.  I probably wouldn't order those again.    From all of the Yelp pictures we had to try the caramelized banana pudding.  It's served in a cute little mason jar.  The balance of cake to pudding to topping was a bit off but it was still tasty.    I wouldn't say Bell's is my favorite but I might try them again."}
{"text":"It's about time there's a legit mom & pop barbeque joint here. It's called Bell's BBQ, and it's right here in Henderson.  --What's On the Menu-- Brisket, Pork Belly!! Pulled Pork,BBQ Chicken, St. Louis style ribs are a couple of the featured menu items. The menu is well rounded with combo meals with your choice TWO sides, Texas toast and pickles made in-house.   The variety of sides you can choose from include 3 cheese mac,braised southern greens, Okra \"fries\"), Smashed Yams w/brown butter & vanilla bean. The corn coblet is described as either plain or Parmesan-Asiago herb crusted! Bet you know what I'm getting next time! There are more listed on menu plus Chef John Bell mentioned they will be adding more in the next few weeks!  WOW!  There's also sandwiches. Someone order this and take a photo and post on Yelp please!! I saw a pulled pork sandwich being brought out to a table. The presentation of it is Yelp worthy! And for under  $10 with your choice of side is pretty sweet deal! The BBQ rubbed pan roasted catfish w/bbq tartar sauce sounds divine too!    --Super Family Friendly!-- The kids menu has mini corn dogs(toddlers love these!), grilled cheese, and smaller sized portion of the larger meals. For under seven bucks it also includes choice of side and a soda. (wonders how old you have to be to qualify as a kid to order ...hmmm)   --What's On My Plate-- I got the Pulled Pork meal and chose smashed yams and okra fries on this visit. Also ordered an add-on of brisket. The pulled pork came on top of the Texas Toast.  Both bbq meats are smokin hot! Perfect mix of meat & fat on pulled pork.. so juicy!  Flavorful & melt in your mouth. Yass!!! And the smashed yams with vanilla bean was insanely good! So were the okra fries..it's sliced and dipped in a corn meal batter I believe. Delicious!!! You'll be happy choosing those sides as I was. The side portions are pretty generous servings. The meats are very good quality,good portion size too and the price is right!    I also got St. Louis ribs for take-out for Mr. B. Dont miss out on these meaty and tender ribs!!!   Oh wait!! There's dessert!! In jars!  S'Mores, Caramelized Banana Pudding, Cheesecake with berries and Chantilly creme? A touch of gourmet twist on these Southern treats. Yasss! Save room for it! I got the S'Mores one. With brownies, marshmallow creme, chocolate mousse, PANNA COTTA, topped with chocolate ganache and krispies. Good stuff. No need to travel elsewhere for dessert.   --Ambiance/Location--  Fast casual style restaurant.  Order and pay upfront at the counter, seat yourself, and servers will bring food out to you. There's also take out too! My orders came out in timely manner.  Everyone on staff was friendly and helpful. Chef John was nice enough to answer my dumb questions. Really nice family friendly place.  Spacious, clean and mix of seating in dining area in way of booths with high back chairs and also dining tables that seats 4, but can easily combine tables for larger groups. You have upbeat country music playing in the background.  Location- Anthem/Green Valley part of Henderson. Bell's is visible facing Eastern Ave, just past Horizon Ridge, in the strip mall next to Pho Mailan. Or locals like me know the shortcut access entrance area off Sundridge (where Lee's Liquors is) and drive around the back.  Soft opening as of this visit with limited hours for now. Open for dinner at 4pm.  So check before you come. Back of take out menu and server told me extended hours coming soon!  --SUMMARY--  Go! NOW! Before this place gets super busy! Because it will! (actually it is busy) No more need to go out and drive another 15 miles away. The Henderson hood has Bell's BBQ!  Yass!"}
{"text":"The hubs and I wanted to try a new place with some friends who had been there previously. We got the pulled pork sandwich and the half rack of ribs the meat was absolutely delicious and seasoned perfectly!! It had a really great smoky flavor. The coleslaw was just right - not to soggy! My husband said the egg salad was just like grandmas! We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere for starters. The outdoor patio seating is such a plus! Food is not only excellent but they had a wide variety of a menu, and the staff is always more than happy to explain any questions.   Definitely try a dessert when you're in, it will be the cherry on top of your sundae for your experience here!"}
{"text":"Yay for small business owners :)  Cute atmosphere, awesome employees.  Food is tasty too.  The BBQ sauce isn't my favorite but it's still worth checking out."}
{"text":"Bell's has some pretty good BBQ I'd have to say. It seemed a little spendy at first but you get good portions of food unlike some of the other local options. Their sides are outstanding, you must try the Crispy Brussel Sprouts. They also deliver up to Madeira Canyon which is a big plus in my book. This location has had a hard time being successful, I'd really like to see Bell's do well."}
{"text":"I had the baby back ribs with a side of Mac n Cheese and red beans and rice. Just like any other BBQ joint, you order at the counter and they bring the food out to you.   Pros - The restaurant is clean and comfortable, with southern music playing softly in the background. My sides were super good. I loved the red beans and rice, they were hot and spicy. The Mac was steamy and good.  The Cons - This place is awfully pricey for what you get. I got twelve ribs with sides and two grilled cheese sandwiches for my kids and spent 51 dollars. The ribs were OK, but they are pre made and come out to you dryer than dog biscuits and Luke warm at best.    Overall - Good place but I probably will not come back for a while..  Especially when it costs 50 dollars to feed my family."}
{"text":"Went to have dinner with my wife. I ordered the BBQ chicken.The chicken was not fully cooked and the waitress said no problem,we will put the chicken back in the oven.The waitress brought the chicken out again and half of the chicken was still raw. I have been there a few times in the past but definitely will not go back. There service is very slow & the food is not properly cooked."}
{"text":"Good BBQ but not great. Small portions. Great presentation. I'm used to southern bbq I guess. Help was friendly."}
{"text":"Happened to drive by this place yesterday so my fiancé and I decided to try it and I'm very glad we did because now we know who will be catering our wedding. I had the brisket (exceptional) and she had a pulled pork sandwich (also exceptional). The pickle sticks were fried perfectly and the smashed potatoes were delicious also. My fiancé really loved the coleslaw as well. I couldn't pick a favorite of their sauces either because they were all so great. We'll definitely be back because I saw plenty of other things I need to try, including the sweet jars!"}
{"text":"Great food, decent prices, ill be going back. Sides were great, main course was great. We ordered a large order to feed 5 and it turned out to be more than we could handle, great portion sizes."}
{"text":"Very disappointed!! I used UberEATS ended up throwing whole meal away. Waste of $30. The ribs were blab, the 3 cheese Mac and cheese bland, onion strings okay, and bread was okay though underneath ribs which sucked. Also ordered the cheesecake tasted old and not edible. Will not be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Saw this place on IG and really wanted some beef ribs. Brought the family for dinner and was not disappointed, the staff was very friendly and the food was great. I tried the cheese corn WOW it's soo good, the ribs did not disappoint either. We also tried the catfish (yummy) but were too stuffed for any dessert so another trip is a must."}
{"text":"1st let's say: no flavor no flavor no flavor. Ordered take out; got yesterday's left overs. Beef Brisket- very dry boring, no spice no flavor no juice and cold. Sauce too sweet - no spice , not enough tang to offset. Mac and cheese- noodle with dry hint of cheese powder. Again no flavor even when added salt and pepper, dry and cold. (Stouffer,s better and I hate frozen food).  Fried pickle boring and no flavor. Red beans and rice husband said just okay. Okra boring. Toast had a sprinkle of spice - Where did that come from! Here is a hint for owners: go back and to learning to make fresh food and hot. Fix your recipes or your cooks - otherwise your doomed!"}
{"text":"This place seated and fed a huge party that arrived after us. We waited over 30 minutes for our dinner with a starving and cranky  nine year old. They offered a free mini dessert for their \"small mix up\"."}
{"text":"Great food friendly staff! If you love BBQ this is a MUST VISIT! We got the sampler party pack and it was off the hook!"}
{"text":"Worth every penny! I ordered the Chicken and Waffles - so good! Make sure to get their BBQ Cauliflower and cheese grits! Friendly staff and overall great experience!"}
{"text":"Hands down!! This is the best BBQ in the Wild Wild West!!!! I stumbled upon this place while I was getting ready to go to the Pho shop next door. I'm sooooo glad I did. The service was excellent and the food is amazing. The Smoked St. Louis ribs and brisket are super good! The BBQ  sauce was excellent too! If you're ever in Henderson do ourself a favor and get real BBQ with real BBQ authentic sauce!"}
{"text":"I have tried most of the sides but tonight decided to have the crispy Brussel sprouts. Omg!  They were fabulous.  So much flavor.   The ribs were also great as usual ."}
{"text":"Not good. Ordered take out. They called 10 mins later and said they were out of ribs. Understandable for a BBQ place. We both got the pulled pork and it was super fatty...the majority of the meat was large hunks of fat and gristle. The sides were okay: beans, smashed potatoes, mac and cheese, greens, and pickles. The kids meals were fine (mini corn dogs and grilled cheese). I can't say any part of the meal was really good. We'll probably give it another try after they've been open for a while. We'll go earlier and we'll definitely order the banana pudding because that looked amazing. Maybe next time, Bell."}
{"text":"Been to Bell's BBQ twice now, both were good experiences. The meats, I have had the pulled pork, sliced brisket and pork belly. The pulled pork is good, not the greatest that I have eaten but still very tasty. The brisket is great, both times that I have been here I get it and it has yet to disappoint. Pork belly was phenomenal, I could have chowed down 10 pounds of it!! The staff is friendly and courteous, the food comes out quickly as well."}
{"text":"Well, it wasn't all that good. Perhaps boiled ribs and I had St. Louis-style ribs. probably boiled, oven baked, no spices, and I asked for my sauce on the side so I could get that smoky charcoal flavor,  but not the case. Greens were good, but mac and cheese failed in flavor for alledgely 3-cheeses. Texas toast was saturated with butter, but the flavor was on the edge of rancid grease/butter. I will try them again and perhaps other dishes, as they do have a great menu!"}
{"text":"We decided on this place as we were looking for something new and local to Henderson that wasn't a chain.  We read the reviews here and decided to give it a try.  The first thing you notice is that it really doesn't smell like a BBQ place...no smoke smell outside or in.  It was about 4 pm on Sunday and they were already out of Beef ribs....ugh!  I ended up ordering a full slab of St. Louis style with the coleslaw and the crispy Brussel sprouts.  The portions are generous to say the least, the Brussel sprouts were great speaking as NOT a fan of them and the ribs were meaty.  I would eat there again for sure."}
{"text":"Since moving to Henderson, this is by far the best BBQ place we've found. The food is amazing and I highly recommend the Buffalo Fried Cauliflower and Cornbread Waffle.  The desserts come in a glass mason jar that you can return for entry into a raffle. Caramelized Banana Pudding and Creme Brûlée? Come on!! Staff is personable and efficient. What's not to love?  Get on down there. We'll certainly be back soon."}
{"text":"Great food.  Loved the service the guys are awesome. Enough in the serving to share with my wife."}
{"text":"This place is very clean, great customer service and not to mention the phenomenal food. We have been here over 20 times this year and I'll tell ya what...the food is CONSISTENT!!! The mashed yams are to die for! The Mac&Cheese is so cheesy and perfect! Our favorite meal is the Cameron's Fried Chicken Breast! Give this place a try and you WILL NOT REGRET IT!!!"}
{"text":"Employee's customer service is top notch, they make you feel so welcomed every time. The decor is great. Now let's get to the amazing food. I've had several items so far and nothing seems to disappoint. The bbq sauce has the right amount of spice and the right amount of sweetness. The brisket sandwich is between Texas toast and is so tender and delicious. The amount of sides to choose from is incredible. The three cheese corn is my personal favorite. The prices are very nice as well with the amount of food you receive. The sweet jars for dessert are so tasty and I love that you can return your jars for a raffle. When you go into there, you can see the experience the chef has under his belt, definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"I was disappointed in the food. The two different ribs tasted exactly the same to me. Coleslaw was rather tasteless. The BBQ sauce was so thin, I think they watered it down. The dill pickles were good. Cashier not overly friendly. It was 5pm and only one family ahead of us. By the time we left the line was out the door and she seemed pretty rattled. The price, too expensive ($42.00) for two meals. I might expect this in a normal restaurant with a waitress. This place you order like at McDonald's and then the meal is brought to you."}
{"text":"Stop reading reviews and just get in here.    I grew up in Kansas City and am a bit of a snob when it comes to BBQ.   This place did not disappoint.  Cool take on on classics, reasonable prices, and killer service.     The Chicken and waffles were awesome."}
{"text":"This is very good restaurant. Others have referred to this as a mom-and-pop place.  While it is family owned, I think \"mom-and-pop\" is a misnomer and implies a casual approach to food preparation.  This, on the other hand, is great food by a talented chef.  The menu is \"deep,\" with lots of choices.  The flavors of everything I've had were bold, not the usual bland tastes we're finding at more and more restaurants.   Everything appears to be made in-house and was very fresh.  And, until they get a better sense of how much they need when, I'm willing to put up with their being out of some items in exchange for this freshness. The details:  I've had take-out once and eaten in twice. Baby back ribs had lots of fall-off-the-bone meat.  Very flavorful and were not covered in sauce.  I consider this a sign of good meat and good preparation.  Other similar restaurants seem to be covering up their product with lots of sauce.  A vinegar-based sauce was provided in a separate container.  Catfish \"add-on,\" that is, a small portion, is delicious.  Plenty for lunch.  Ask for the tartar sauce - it has some extra kick in it. Cole slaw and fried onions were very good.  As with everything else, portions are very large - enough for two when ordered as an \"add-on.\"  The \"red devil\" potato salad was delicious - the potatoes had good texture and the dressing unusual but sure to become a favorite.  Baked beans had great depth of flavor due to addition of peppers and plenty of brisket.  The pickles were a great surprise.  I've never had freshly brined ones - very crisp and a great counterbalance to the ribs and fish. Dessert for me was a classic crème brulee...but served in a cute little glass jar.  They have other choices. Another good feature:  the carryout containers are high quality -- no styroform.  They were thus leak and drip proof.  It looked like they had a good selection of beers.  There was also Woodbridge wine.  Other beverages were available from a soda fountain setup.  Although customers order from the front counter and then the food is brought to the table by servers, this doesn't have a sterile, takeout kind of vibe.  The lighting is nice and people seem to linger at their tables enjoying another beer."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a whim- had time to kill while the car was being detailed. Super friendly service upon entering, throughout our meal and until we left. Food is great, multiple variations of awesome BBQ sauce, even a gluten free option. The sides were amazing, and the portions are huge. It's pretty hard to find decent BBQ, most places are just crappy chains. Not to mention the entire establishment was insanely clean, bathrooms included. Believe me, that does not go unappreciated. Was happy to find one that broke the mold here in Vegas. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Vegas!  I asked the hubby to bring some pulled pork home for me... But he surprised me with chicken and waffles.  I'm kinda in a chicken and waffles love affair lately and these are the best I've tasted by a long shot!  The BBQ sauce was very good but the flavors of the meat were so tasty I hardly used much of it!  I loved the baked beans--they are a variety of beans & not just the same 'ol jazzed up jar of Bush's like some other places I've been. The desserts were really impressive. They are served in a glass mason jar (even if you get it to-go) and were as tasty as they are beautiful. I might have to take my jar back for a refill!"}
{"text":"I am from Texas and I know good BBQ.  Brisket here was fab and you get a decent sized portion.  the bbq beans are great...different beans are used and they have good flavor without having too much bbq sauce in them.  They remind me of \"cowboy beans\".  Of course, I like the Texas toast it was served open face with.  Just like in TX.  I love that they have beef ribs.  Have to try them yet but glad I know where I can get them.  I also can't wait to try the grits and cheese.  Yum!  The staff is friendly and helpful and aim to please.  The owner came by and I did tell him the greens were not spicy enough for me and that I liked the vinegar from a bottle of tobacco peppers on my greens and he said he would look into getting some.   As far as price, well, a good BBQ place buys good meat and they have to cook it just right so they have to have someone who knows what they are doing. Someone that feels that these prices are high, has not eaten in many good barbeque places.  Typically, it ain't cheap!   I am not totally sold but I will say that I will be returning.  I have to try the catfish and fried green tomatoes and the fried okra.  One of these days I have to save room for desert."}
{"text":"Talk about nice small BBQ spot in Henderson. I have always heard about Bell's BBQ and literally pass by it every Thursday night before my cycle class. I finally decided this week get my recovery meal right next door after cycle class.   The menu is fairly straight forward comes to most BBQ joints from brisket, pulled pork, ribs, and can go on and on. I was in the mood for nice pulled pork sandwich for my first time. It was really good!! I like the fact they used more Texas toast style bread then traditional bun. It definitely is lot more filling bread. It looks massive the way whole sandwich stands tall with pulled pork pouring over the top and the topping of fried onions brought it all together. The crunch of the fried onion along with the moist. juicy, hot, and right amount of BBQ soaked in pulled pork. Solid. Nothing worst then over BBQ in pulled pork sandwich the bread way soaked after one bite not much of sandwich. No doubt pulled pork sandwich one of the best ones had comes to BBQ. The sandwiches comes with one side so went with the 3 cheese or mac and cheese. It was pretty tasty. One thing that stood out the type of pasta used in the mac and cheese. Spiral shape pasta instead of traditional elbow macaroni. I like the way cheese gets all in-between and cheesy goodness just soaks it all in. It creamy cheesy cheesy not heavy but there still nice stringy cheese with every bite. I got another side of Crispy Fried Onion. Probably not good idea when I realize it was to late it was on top of my pulled pork sandwich. It really good more so if dip it in the ranch sauce comes with it on the side.   The service was fabulous. The gentlemen took my order was friendly, told him was my first time, and explained everything on point. Positive vibes. Once got my food made sure check up see if everything was ok and if needed anything. Five star service for sure!!!   So many other goodies on the menu definitely need make it more of regular recovery meal spot Thursday nights."}
{"text":"Brand new mom and pops BBQ spot in Henderson.  Before trying the food, I adjusted my expectations accordingly in light of the fact it's a new place and they're probably working out the kinks.    However, that wasn't the case at all.  Great atmosphere - the staff was friendly and attentive.  Also, at this price range, the food was incredible - I had the St. Louis ribs and the pork belly.  I'm certain the other items on the menu are also great, which is why I'll be back soon. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"As far as BBQ goes, this is just ok. The guy at the register was clueless. The brisket was overcooked, the pulled pork was dry and the ribs were pretty good, albeit a bit salty. As a guy who's spent 30 years behind a grill and a smoker, I was left wanting. The BBQ beans were very tasty though. The Mac N Cheese was outstanding! Coleslaw was the worst I have ever had. Very inconsistent. A couple of good sides, but one goes to a BBQ restaurant for the meats. This place is surely better than Lucille's (awful!!) and a damn site worse than Rollin' Smoke, Big B's or The Roadkill Grill. Those are the best three in town, in that order. You should probably go to one of them instead."}
{"text":"So glad to have found our new BBQ hangout. This place serves legit comfort food that reminds you of the South. I don't even know where to start as they were all good. My favorite was the grilled corn! It was so sweet and crisp but then you get the surprise of the melted cheese that gives you just the right amount of saltiness. The deep-fried okra was very good too. And the brisket - so soft and tender I didn't even need a knife to cut it! Top that with their house BBQ sauce and you're set. Make sure to leave room for dessert coz those sweet jars are not to be missed. Red Velvet was so moist and not utterly sweet. Wait and then there's also Banana pudding that will remind you of the ones from Magnolia Bakery in New York.  The ambience is low key and very relaxing.  It has a very nice and welcoming vibe when you enter. The staff is very friendly and attentive. It's a local business that's not a franchise so that's a great addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Brought my friends and Coaches to Bell's for dinner, everyone loved the food. Ribs, pork belly and brisket were so good we hardly talked...and we are a loud group. The sides were off the charts when it comes to flavor and quality. Every single person in the group has marked Bell's Barbecue as a place to come when in Las Vegas area. The coaches that are driving back home (7.5 hours) are stopping at Bell's on the way out of town to take some barbecue home."}
{"text":"Went in with high expectations, very disappointed. Brisket was dry like it was in a warmer for house. Pulled pork was pretty good. Baby back ribs, not so good."}
{"text":"What an awesome place for authentic bbq!  Owner is so friendly and the food was outstanding!  Love the \"huge\" beef rib!!! OMG- corn??? The best!   Love their desserts, called sweet jars!  Red velvet was my favorite This is our new favorite for bbq!"}
{"text":"Simply put, great food, great service.  It will take a number of visits before working our way through the variety of menu selections, but so far they've been very consistent in terms of quality and they've more than earned our regular patronage."}
{"text":"Don't miss the Buffalo cauliflower! YUM!!  Smashed yams n bbq ribs.  Mustard BBQ on the side.  A little sweet, a little spicy!! My niece had the chicken n waffles, enough to feed 2-3!  My sister had the pulled rib sandwich.   Everything we had was really great!  No room left to try dessert, next time for sure!!  Right now if you buy $100 gift card you get $20 free"}
{"text":"We have ordered dinner for pick up and also ordered for delivery thru Uber Eats. Both times the food was delicious. It is a little more expensive than other BBQ choices but the flavor is amazing. The baby back loin ribs and brisket is a favorite."}
{"text":"I am so happy since Bell's BBQ opened near me, i have been searching for quality BBQ since moving to Las Vegas 28 years ago. This is hands down the best in Las Vegas. Their Beef Ribs are cooked perfectly, tender meat with a good bark on the outside. Baby backs are also excellent. The fried chicken isn't bone in but the strips they serve a fantastic. Great selection of sides, and even though they are sometimes out of one or the other it is just a testament to its being prepared on site and fresh. Delicious food, comfortable space, and attentive service. I'm a happy customer."}
{"text":"I have waited a long time for a great BBQ place to go to, with quality food & St Louis ribs done to perfection! With Tons of sides, lots of choices.  A Great Chief ,adding new things on the menu  Weekly. Very nice remodel  on his restaraunt, & take out is easy & Packaged well. Also a sm Kids menu, & custom desserts. I have become a professional BBQ diner & its 5 Starr . Pease try it, it's a nice family run place!    Deanna Langer local eater!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and music. Quick and friendly service. Brussels sprouts are amazing! On the bitter side, so if you're not a fan of the bitters they might not be for you, but I Loved them, as I am a fan of bitters. On the opposite spectrum, the mashed yams were a sweet balance, and very delicious. The brisket was good, a little on the dry side, but nice flavor. The barbecue sauce was great.  On the other hand, the cornbread waffle needs some improvement. It tasted more like batter, and not even like a waffle, let alone, a cornbread waffle.  The concept is great, if it were Real corn bread batter, cooked in a waffle. But it is not. And the sweet tea was good. But could have been a little sweeter.  Overall, great place, would have even been a five star if it weren't for the few key elements that were lacking, which make a Great barbecue spot."}
{"text":"Great BBQ, can't wait to go back. Had the pork belly and crispy brussel sprouts. It was awesome. The homemade sauce was really good too."}
{"text":"Food was just ok don't see the big deal nothing to write home about ... service is ok"}
{"text":"I really love this place!  The Barbecue is the real deal!  But, that's not my favorite thing about this place. Every time I've been here the staff is welcoming and friendly! They always ask how you like your meal and can they bring you anything!  The brisket is tender and delicious either sliced or chopped and the chicken dishes seem like homemade. There are so many sides that it is hard to decide which one to order and they are also very unique like okra fries, which completely appeals to my southern roots! It's very reasonably priced and you leave feeling satisfied that you had a great meal. There are a lot of great places to eat in his locale, but, this is by far my favorite, see ya tonight!"}
{"text":"My Vegas-metro BBQ tastings continues. Bell's is close by, and has been on the list to try.  Friendly staff. Food delivered quickly to the table. Place is clean.  Brisket was nice in that was not dried out, but, no real smoke flavor or seasoning on the meat. BBQ beans were really nice (sweet but not overly). Slaw was ok, nothing special (pretty much what you get at any other place). Pickles were good. Nice sized portions."}
{"text":"Come for the BBQ, stay for the dessert jars.  We hit up Bell's BBQ while we were in Vegas earlier this month (July 2016).  Tip:  A Yelp check-in gets you a free side!  The BBQ is awesome...moist and tender.  I split a brisket plate with 3 sides (one free) with my daughter, so we would have room for the 3 dessert jars we ordered.  Priorities...always save room for dessert.  Our dessert jars were:  Red Velvet, S'mores and Crème Brulee.  All were wonderful.  The Red Velvet was my fav.  I would come back just for the dessert jars right now if it didn't take me 10 hours to drive there.  Definitely worth a return visit next time we're in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"As a North Carolina native, I was excited to hear the owners are from NC too! Though it isn't traditional NC style, the BBQ pork was the best we've had in a long time! The sides are plentiful and reasonably priced. We tried the cheese corn, Macncheese, Brussels sprouts, baked beans, mashed yams, and added cole slaw to the sandwhich - all amazing! We will be back - maybe to live here lol. Friendly service and great food - win!"}
{"text":"The staff are pleasant and attentive.  The food is so juicy, meaty and savory.  It is a great value for moderate price.  I think this has become our favorite place for BBQ."}
{"text":"Bell's BBQ for the 1st time and man was I happy I did! Over on the end of eastern. I ordered the recommended chopped brisket sandwich. Huge sandwich  and delicious. Didn't realize it came topped with onion rings, so others might get a better value than me(I also didn't get the free pickles that come with it). I did however very much enjoy everything else. The 4 cheese Mac with the ritz crumbles is on point. The sandwich hearty & tasty. All that meat wedges in between 2 big pieces of garlic toast. Another great option besides Sin City Smokers closer to home."}
{"text":"Just got done eating here and was impressed overall. Food was good and plentiful. Staff was super nice and helpful. Gotta commend one of the staff for bringing me my cell phone I had forgotten as I was ealking out the door. Real stand up guy and ditto for his establishment"}
{"text":"This place is incredible. Just order the shrimp and grits and you will be a lifer at this place. The only place in town that I know you can get these and they are a perfect 10 every time I order tem. And the homemade deserts are to die for. Go check out Movies & Candy next door after you eat here for a perfect night!"}
{"text":"Bell's is a nice addition to the Henderson area. Have wanted another BBQ joint that was quicker and more reasonably priced then Lucille's and they delivered. We ordered to go and were greeted at the register (yes order and pay first even to dine in) and much like most new restaurants they use an iPad for ordering and paying, so this is where you would be asked to tip (purely an option not complaint worthy as some previous reviewers have complained, and you can still leave a tip on the table if you prefer, wow!)  The Food- My wife has the pulled pork and enjoyed it, she is not a seasoning person, so the pork was lightly smoked and seasoned, and was perfect for her. Me, it needed more seasoning.  My son had pulled pork sandwich, which was a good portion of meat and worth the $9 price.  I asked the cashier what I should go for since I didn't want ribs, and was recommended the brisket. Some of the better brisket I have had, good smoke flavor, nice char, not gristly, and not dry!   The sides were all good, although none of them really stood out.  The dessert - This was the highlight of Bells, we had the smores and caramelized banana pudding which are served in these awesome little Mason jars. Both were fantastic, wife the chocolate fanatic loved the smores, and I the not too much of a chocolate fan was left wanting more banana pudding.  Bell's is worthy of another visit for the BBQ, but might see me weekly for the Jars of deliciousness!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best places for bbq I have been for a while. Now I am giving this 5 stars for multiple reasons though there were a few recommendations.  I will start out with the things I didn't so much love nor dislike but did think need improvement, minor yet notable.  First, was my husband ordered a side of pork. The young man at the register asked if he would like that chopped and my husband said, \" yes\". His only recommendation on all the meat was to chop it a little more like more traditional bbq so its easier for consumers to eat.  Second, were the okra fries. I absolutely love okra so to see okra on the menu I was ecstatic. These left me a tad disappointed. The end was still intact, the breading was falling off, they lacked any flavor, and had to be my least favorite thing I ate while dining.   Now for all the AMAZING THINGS!!!! I am vegetarian and my husband is full on carnivore so the menu here was perfect for both of us giving multiple options. I ordered the Mac and cheese which was heavily!!!! I have to say it probably was the best Mac and cheese I ever had anywhere so major props! I also ordered the sweet potatoes which were divine and not to sweet like other places. The grilled cheese was made with real cheddar on Texas toast and not greasy. My husband ordered a pork bbq sandwich which was huge, the meat was tender and moist. I have to say I am very happy that Bells has come into this location because we will definitely be frequent customers. The staff was wonderful and food was delicious!!"}
{"text":"Dissapointed. Ribs were served almost cold, as was the yam side. And the coleslaw was lukewarm!   Besides that, I had to watch CNN fake news on the monitors. Why do we have to watch any political nonsense?  Why not sports?  Bad experience."}
{"text":"So impressed with this place!! We ordered the pork belly, baby back ribs, brisket and pulled chicken! So much meat and so delicious!! The pork belly was my favorite, crisp on the outside and melt in mouth on the inside! Twila took great care of us!! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Sooo good! Best BBQ in town! Loved the food and the service was great. The portion sizes are big! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This. Is. Barbecue! Everything was delicious, but the pork belly left the lasting impression. Juicy and tender on the inside, crispy on the outside. It's literally what I have been seeing on food shows for years, but have never been able to find. The reason that pork belly has become so much more popular, and the reason it should stay that way."}
{"text":"Went with a group of friends for a total party of 12 on Sunday evening for dinner.  Was completely blown away by the food.  Everything was fantastic.  To top it off, they opted to wait on us due to the size of the group.  The pulled pork was perfect, moist and full of flavor.  The brisket was really tasty and begged for their homemade BBQ sauce as the perfect compliment.  A side of pork belly was an overindulgence, but it was fantastic and almost started a fight as people were trying to steal pieces!  Any BBQ fan knows the staple sides, but Bell's takes it up a notch and goes gourmet on them.  We didn't try quite everything, but each one we had was phenomenal.  Mashed yams could easily be desert.  Potato salad with the just right amount of egg.  Crispy brussel sprouts were a huge favorite.  Beans were rich and flavorful cooked with the brisket.  Buffalo cauliflower was a surprising treat, and the okra fries were delicious.    No one ordered a dessert jar, but I'm sure we will the next time.    Do yourself a favor and check out Bell's.  Without question the best BBQ in the area.  Don't believe the hype about the cost - the price point is fantastic for the massive amount of food you get.    In fact, I'm going to get takeout for dinner tonight."}
{"text":"Took a second bite of my food I just ordered and in the mix was a blonde strand of medium length hair. (I'm a brunette) Imagine pulling out a strand of hair mixed with BBQ sauce out of your mouth. Gross!! I'm so disgusted by it that I threw my food out. Hair nets are made for a reason. I definitely will not be going back."}
{"text":"I got take out for the family because one of my friends said they loved the food.  We ordered the BBQ chicken, BBQ brisket and the BBQ pork.  All were very tasty! My three picky eater children devoured their food!  The barbecue sauce that they use is a little bit runny but very flavorful and they don't overwhelm the meat which is a testament to how good the flavor of the smoked meat is.  They give you additional sauce on the side which I used to dip my sandwich in - giving it just the right amount of BBQ flavor.  We will definitely order from here again.... yum!"}
{"text":"Gave Bell's BBQ a try yesterday.  Their menu is extensive and goes beyond bbq.  Shrimp and grits, chicken and waffles, chicken fried shrimp are a few of the options that stood out to me.  We stuck with bbq this visit and ordered a full rack of baby backs, added on brisket, hot links and salt and pepper catfish.  We chose 3 cheese mac, deviled egg potato salad, mashed yams and corn bread for our sides.  Sweet tea to drink and banana pudding for dessert.  Total for all this was under $60.  Highlights were catfish (with bbq tarter sauce!) and hot links.  Fave side was the corn bread.  It's grilled and almost cake like.  Least fave side was the deviled egg potato salad.  They have over 20 sides so there is plenty of other options for next time.  There was an issue with their card system when trying to pay.  Took quite awhile and ended up just having to ring me up on another register.  Seemed like we should have done that from the beginning but I would have been waiting for my order anyway so really didn't matter.  The cashier was very nice during the whole ordeal.    There is a $5 of $25 yelp check in coupon.  I used it the first time but I think when she had to ring it up again on the other register it was forgotten.  Per owner comment below it is only for dine in.  That is fine but then she shouldn't have marked it redeemed and given me the discount the first time she rang up the order."}
{"text":"I've lived in Las Vegas my entire life and I've never found a BBQ place I've enjoyed until I went here. The food is phenomenal and the customer service was great! I will be returning as often as I can! I've been telling everyone about it! Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Ever since I moved here to Vegas almost two years ago, I have been trying to find that outstanding BBQ place that I could call my favorite.  I have tried John Mulls meats, Famous Daves, Rollin Smoke, Lucilles, and a few other places I have forgotten. All of those places have let me down in one way or another (sauce overpowering, too expensive, too bland, etc).  Bells is the Belle of the Ball. I had the Pork Belly plate with a Brisket add-on, with Smashed Potatoes and the 3-cheese Mac and Cheese for my sides, and Sweet Tea to drink.  The Pork Belly was so tender and juicy. It was the second best belly I have. Only second best because the best was a little less fatty and had more of a smoked bacony flavor.  The Brisket was also fantastic. Tender and fall apart on your fork.  The Smashed Potatoes are flavored with Smoked Garlic but it's just a hint. Not over powering at all. And they are real potatoes. Like my mom used to make. Definitely not powdered or flake.  The 3 Cheese Mac and Cheese is great. You really can't go wrong on a 3 cheese mac.  The sweet tea was good, definitely not overly sweet.  Will DEFINITELY be returning here"}
{"text":"Not real BBQ. No smoke flavor in brisket and sides were bland.  Kitchen didn't look clean and drink area was cluttered. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in town! I could be good just on the sides and dessert alone. Pulled chicken sandwich is great. Must have sides: Fried green tomatoes with bacon aioli, 3 Cheese mac(they put ritz crackers in it), vanilla bourbon yams and collard greens. Dessert Jars are incredible! My favorites:Fluffer Nutter, caramelized banana and S'mores."}
{"text":"Just ok and not authentic BBQ. Mac and cheese is dry, I don't believe they have a smoker so I think they are using dry heat. They store the food in crescores. Service is awful, sauce is passable but not great. They are alway out of food. Not sure if I would go back, maybe give it another try but I felt let down on this one. Much better BBQ other places."}
{"text":"This place tasted great and has the sweetest staff. They are on point! Will be back for more in the near future."}
{"text":"Nice place with good food and good service. Easy to find. BBQ is excellent with good sauce and good sized portions.     Recommend for good lunch spot."}
{"text":"Bell's BBQ is now open.   I am a big fan of BBQ and it is about time we have a very decent barbecue restaurant on Eastern Ave in Henderson.   My wife and I drove by and ate there just 2 hours after they opened their doors.  Chef John has 30 years of restaurant experience and he and his wife Stephanie were friendly and welcoming.    First the positives (and there are many).   The brisket is outstanding.   Tender and juicy and filled with flavor.   Many times it is difficult for a restaurant to get brisket to not  dry out but not at Bell's.   It was perfect.  We also tried some ribs (naked,  without sauce) and LOVED the rub used.   The ribs were meaty and did not need sauce but Bell's had 2 homemade sauces available.   For sides we tried the Mac n Cheese,  the southern greens and baked beans.   Of these,  you need  to especially try the greens.   I usually don't like greens but Chef John somehow made these taste pretty awesome.   The Mac N Cheese as well as the beans were tasty but compared to the rest of dinner,  were just average compared to other BBQ joints I have been to.     The biggest positive was the desserts.   You MUST try the Smores which were served in a glass jar.   Three kinds of chocolate,  marshmallow,  graham cracker  crust with a few cocoa crispies as a topping.   Yummy.   I would (and will) go back just for this dessert.   The negatives are few and pretty minor.   The hand printed menu board was difficult to read,  there was no TV and the location was a bit hard to find.   However,  go there once and you will remember because you will be going back time and time again."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our visit to Bell's BBQ. The food was delicious and the service was great. They checked on us often and the prices were pretty good."}
{"text":"Wow! What a surprise. This Resturant is amazing. The staff (Twilah) was very nice and accommodating. The food was definitely the best bbq in vegas. We got the half chicken which was so moist we couldn't believe it. Everything was top quality from the mashed yams, braised greens and ocra fries were all delicious. Don't even get me started on the red velvet."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Delicious food (we had the brisket and pulled pork) and lots of yummy sides ( Mac n cheese, crispy Brussels sprouts, buffalo cauliflower, beans, and fries 5 ways) to choose from! Ashley was super friendly and helpful (as was everyone)! Great BBQ place! My husband and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing amazing food! The dessert was definitely homemade. Can't wait to come back again and the staff was really helpful about answering questions on the menu"}
{"text":"I have been here three times. The first time around the ribs and brisket were just okay to me. The only reason I kept coming here is for their Pork belly. Not allot of places sell it, when ever I see it anywhere i go I always order it and here it did not disappoint! It's cooked perfectly. I never eat in I always take it to go and it never makes it home. Haha  Another thing that they never advertise but they really should is their Chicken wings. They have some of the best wings I've ever had. Better than Buffalo Wild wings or where ever!  I've only had a few of their sauces but the ones I've had so far have been great! Mustard BBQ, Traditional Buffalo, this sweet and spicy sauce.   That pretty much somes up this review Their Pork Belly and Wings are why I come here."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here on Wednesday, January 10, 2018. As soon as we walked in, we were greeted immediately and were asked if this was our first time eating there. The menu items were explained in detail to us. My husband ordered the pulled-pork sandwich with a side of okra fries. I ordered the pulled-brisket sandwich with a side of roasted brussel  sprouts and an extra side of red beans and rice. Sandwiches come with one side and homemade pickles. Everything was delicious! They have a  small selection of beers (local and others) to drink with the BBQ. Their portions were decent size. The sandwiches were both on Texas toast bread which was toasted. What I loved about the sandwich was that the meat did not fall out; somehow they made it miraculously stay in between the two slices of bread, which was wonderful. The red beans and rice were good, I just didn't think it was spicy enough. The fried okra fries is a new twist(to me) on fried okra. They were very good. Crispy, light and not mushy. They have a bottle of BBQ on the tables along with wipes and extra napkins. Nice touch. We ordered of their sweet jar desserts to go; a Key-lime pie. The Key-lime pie was made of a chocolate crust versus a traditional graham cracker crust. My husband prefers the traditional crust; but said it was was really good.  By the way, we used $5 off when you check in with YELP. No problem.   The atmosphere was pleasant. Staff checked on us occasionally to see how we were doing and cleared our plates when were finished. Great service from start to finish! They have two televisions in there in case you don't feel like conversing with others.   I would recommend eating here. This is our new favorite BBQ place when we have a hankering for BBQ southern style."}
{"text":"Grabbed take out from here over the weekend and really loved it. I had the shrimp po boy with kale salad which was super yummy and the s' more pudding which actually came in a glass jar even though it was take out. My only criticism was the po boy used too much bread so I ended up dumping out the insides and eating them with a fork. Hubby got the Mac and cheese and banana pudding and he loved both!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ sauce I've ever had - not too sweet, not too thick, just the right tang.   Loved the Pork Belly on Texas Toast, with brussels sprouts, green beans simmered with bacon and onion.  Pork Belly great texture and perfect amount of smokiness. Absolutely a must-try.   So happy I found this new restaurant close to home!"}
{"text":"This place is always awesome. Walk in or delivery is the same great food. Remember 2 orders feed 3 people or works great for left overs.  Thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"Okay now this place was so freaken good. As far as price; you get what you pay for. High quality food, huge portions, and creative dishes. We ordered through grub hub and the food was so good! It was fresh and nicely packed in nice containers.   Mac n cheese- SO good! Some of the best Mac n cheese I've had.  Side salad- really really good and quality, clean, fresh ingredients  Ribs- good  Crispy Brussels- so good  Fried shrimp- huge portion and so good  Waffles- they were okay(no one loves them in our group )  Red velvet cake- delicious   Banana dessert- AMAZING"}
{"text":"Delicious! Not one thing disappointed! Staff very attentive and they made us feel very welcome! Bbq was on point and the okra fries were to die for! Smash Potatoes was a huge hit with my daughter! And Devyn's Pickles - they should be selling jars of these! Desert was the icing on the cake!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by to try this out. We intended to have some pho next door. The atmosphere and service were great. The brisket sandwich was a thick slice of bread with half of it cut in the middle then stuffed with brisket. The bread was heavily coated with butter then lightly toasted. The brisket was a bit dry but the bbq sauce saved it. The side of Mac n cheese was unimpressive. My wife's bbq chicken looked great but did not reach the point of falling off the bone like good bbq chicken should. The plastic knife and fork was challenging to cut through the bird. It may be worth another shot but for today, we should of stuck with the pho."}
{"text":"Everytime I drive past here the smell is screaming STOP YOU FOOL.  They assisted me as soon as I walked in and helped me navigate through their monster menu. I ordered a fairly large amount of food because there were several items that I wanted to try. I got Ribs, Catfish, chicken and waffles, about 4 different sides and of course the caramelized banana pudding sweet jar.   EVERYTHING.... and I do mean absolutely EVERYTHING was fantastic. The only other thing I can compare this too locally is John Murs spot ( which unfortunately is on the complete opposite side of town).  I told them I was new to Bell's and had never experienced their greatness. So they insisted that I walk away with one of each sauce. Thank you for that by the way. Options are good, but options with BBQ sauce is a must. Sweet, spicy, and the regular stuff. All of it had a little tang to it but I enjoyed it. I did the st Louis ribs this go around. Next time I have to try the baby backs.  Tip: ask about the cornbread. ( Jalapeno / Bacon) you'll thank me later."}
{"text":"Very good barbecue.  Came here tonight with family who live in Henderson, who come here often.  I had the pulled pork sandwich, and my wife had pulled pork without the bread (great Texas toast, but she can't have gluten).  Their gluten free barbecue sauce is fantastic by the way. At the end of the meal we had three sweet jars... All were very good! Very good fries, and the ribs looked awesome ( will snag one from my nephew who brought two home)! I don't find use of pricing comments nor do I give them... I look for and enjoy great food, and Bell's is definitely great food.  I look forward to coming back to try other offerings."}
{"text":"We've been wanting to try this place since it opened and finally did today.  We went in for lunch.  First off we were greeted by a very friendly young man named \"Balil\" I actually called after l left to make sure spelling was right :). He was very sweet and helpful with choices on the menu.  Food was very yummy.  I had the pulled bbq sandwich and my sister had the bbq brisket sandwich which she loved.  My husband had the baby back ribs and love them as well.  They were yummy and tender.  All the sides were great!  Balil was the one that checked us out at the register but even came by the table to check on us and asked if he could refill our drinks.  It's people like him that make it a pleasure to come back."}
{"text":"We were in the area and two places each had four stars.  We picked Bells.  I ordered pulled pork with smashed potatoes and okra fries.  My husband ordered the brisket sandwich with onion straws.  He loves his onion straws.  He said the bread was really good too but holy cow it's a huge slice of bread!  My pulled pork was pretty dry, smashed potatoes were bland and my okra was so do.  I was intrigued by the okra fries but they are difficult to bite so you have to shove the whole thing in your mouth.  I like it cut up better.  They have three sauces, spicy, old fashioned and house.  I preferred the house, it tasted like a vinegar base.  My husband liked his brisket but said it's a little too dry but he enjoyed the sauce."}
{"text":"They have really good food. Everything was seasoned and tasty. The plates look awesome with the open bread sandwiches and rustic metal tray plates. I have to go back to taste and sample. The fish was well seasoned and crispy. We had lots of ribs beef and pork. Good amount for the price. A variety of sauces I only liked two, but that's a personal preference. I waited to do this review, so I don't have the details of the the flavors. Get double sides you won't have enough. They don't have mixed plated like a rib chicken plate or combo that I saw. They have a kids day with a balloon maker and discount meal."}
{"text":"I'm always looking for good BBQ Beef Ribs and Bell's definitely has them! They tend to run out so it is good to call ahead to make sure they have some.   The Beef rims were not too smokey and for me that is a good thing. Sometimes I taste more of the smoke than the flavor of the meat and what it has been seasoned with or marinated in. The beef ribs were juicy and on point!  I do look forward to coming back and trying more of what is on the menu cause a lot of the items looked and smelled delicious!"}
{"text":"The big foodie surprise on this trip to Las Vegas.  I had the brisket with a side of ribs...I kid you not, a side of ribs!  First, unless you are a BIG eater, the side was not needed as the portion on the brisket meal was plenty.  The brisket was delicious; moist, tender with a good flavor.  Same for the ribs.  I had their fried okra as a side and it was prepared like french fries, a first for me...  However, the okra was fresh and tasted great. There was some kind of house sauce with the okra that also tasted pretty darn good.   The only issue I had was that I ate so much that I had no room for desert....  I'll try this again on my next trip!!!"}
{"text":"The fried cauliflower bites were my favorite thing hands down would go there just for those. The catfish was good as well but the macaroni and cheese was just a little too runny."}
{"text":"I could eat BBQ any day, and I had heard good things about Bell's and decided to give it a try.   The first time I went was at 8:30 on a Thursday. They were open until 9, but the doors were already closed. No big issue - it may have been a slow night and they closed early?  Next time they were open, and we got the Brussel Sprouts, Macaroni and Cheese, Coleslaw and ribs. The Brussel Sprouts were fantastic! Crunchy and delicious! My son loved and Mac and Cheese, especially with the Ritz Cracker crust. The coleslaw was fine, nothing wild, but it is just coleslaw ;-) The meat, the star of the show, was lackluster. There was so much fat and very little meat. I know BBQ, especially ribs, can be fatty, but this way way too much. I took my first bite and it was all fat. I just can't give this place 4+ stars when the BBQ itself is not as good tasting as some of the sides.   Two friends of mine went the other week and said the same thing - sides and dessert were good, but the meat was lacking in the flavor department.   Maybe we'll go back one day as I heard they have several gluten free options, but unfortunately, I am in no rush."}
{"text":"Me and my friends decided to try something new when we came across Bells BBQ. Lets just say this place does not disappoint. We were greeted as soon as we walked in the door, Blisle was very helpful while navigating the menu. Overall the food was great and you definitely get what you pay for. Lisle came around and asked us how everything was and offered to get us refills on the drinks which i though was great customer service since you get your own drink from the soda machine in the corner. Awesome customer service and great food! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It's ok, if u never eat BBQ then it's 4 stars but if your have had Oklahoma joes in KC, anywhere in Austin TX or Nashville BBQ then it's a clear 2.5/3 Star situation"}
{"text":"I'm going full 5 stars just because they have 18 side dishes and chicken fried shrimp. And you gotta try the desserts and tell me how they are."}
{"text":"My roommate and I was going to eat next door at the Vietnamese place, but my roommate heard great things about this place and we decided to go here. I'm glad we did! She ordered the brisket sandwhich and I ordered the beef ribs. I love beef ribs and these were tender and tasty! I usually have to fight getting the meat off the bone but not these ones! I got 2 sides and an extra side for checking in with yelp. I am critical with Mac and cheese and I must say the 3 cheese Mac and cheese surpass my test. Nice consistency with the cheese and has has a smoothness to it,which I like. The crispy brussel sprouts were the bomb! I wish I can make these at home. The 3rd side was the mash yams , which was nothing special but still good.  They have different types of bbq sauce and I usually go with the spicy bbq sauce,but the mustard bbq sauce was amazing. First time trying mustard bbq sauce on ribs and it added another level of taste to my palate!!! Great service, especially from twayla. She made sure everything tasted great and are drinks filled! I believe their bbq is a North Carolina flare. Oh they also have legit texas toast to die for. Ill be back!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!! The service is exquisite! The food is so delicious. I had the pulled chicken with 2 sides (mashed potatoes and red beans & rice). My husband had beef brisket with 2 sides (coleslaw and baked beans). This place is a must if you like BBQ. We are definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Food was cold, and didn't taste very good. I had the baby back ribs. Below average at best. I'm sticking to rollin smoke BBQ"}
{"text":"Bell's is one of the few bbq joints I can sit down without shame and do some serious finger licking eating. Our first experience here was exciting, with so many great food options that we almost ordered the entire menu for one meal. We did decided on brisket, chicken fried shrimp, chicken tenders, and St. Louis Ribs, ending our meals with dessert jars - red velvet and fluffernutter.  All I can say is damn. Damn, damn, damn!   The brisket was so tender and the ribs had that bite I love. The chicken strips were some of the best I've had outside of Chicken Shack! The chicken fried shrimp was delicious. Even the sides were great! We had fries x 5, cheese grits, and corn. I'd totally order all that again.  Ending with the dessert jars was the best choice in life. Both desserts blew us away! We took one jar home because I wanted to save some to eat before bedtime. It was amazing. Between red velvet and fluffernutter, if I had to choose one, I'd run away with both jars.  The photos speak for themselves. You must eat here."}
{"text":"I stopped in because this is near my daughter's swim school. Boy, am i glad. Hands down juiciest, most tender brisket I have had here! I also ordered ribs, grits, bbq beans, potato salad and fries. I love bbq and i am so glad Bell's is here! Can't wait to go back to try the buffalo cauliflower. It looked good but i already placed my order."}
{"text":"Ribs were very meaty (much much meatier than Tony Roma's). Baked beans and okra fries rocked. Just maybe need more sauce options ala Famous Daves. Staff was exceptional. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great looking place, nice menu but the food is not good. The pork belly was not good because of the funky tasting sauce, the brisket was also smothered with a sauce that was overpowering. The cheesy grits were bland and the sweet potatoes were terrible. The only thing I liked was the crispy Brussels sprouts which I had never seen before. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Balil has hands down the best customer service skills ever! Everyone is always really nice at bells! I've done the postmates/uber eats delivery thing and that worked out great, but I finally made it over to the location and they're even better in person! We've now been there several times and every time food is great! Shrimp grits and bbq cauliflower is my fave! Desserts are also the best ever! Thank you bells for great food and great customer service!"}
{"text":"Visiting Vegas area on business and stopped in at Bell's BBQ. Had the smoked brisket with collard greens and crispy brussels sprouts. I felt the barbecue was well done, but collard greens were lacking a little in flavor. No concerns with the brussels. Portions were great for the price and I left very full and satisfied. It's like a little taste of South Carolina barbecue in the city of sin. Would certainly come again."}
{"text":"This is at least the 4th restaurant in this location and this one WILL stick. Let me first state I am no BBQ aficionado but I do enjoy great food.  Bells has a very diverse BBQ menu and 3 different BBQ sauces that are all amazing. Very big variety of sides which out of the 5 my wife and I had were all fantastic. The pulled chicken and brisket were both cooked to perfection. Not sure if it was a special but the Buffalo cauliflower nuggets were spectacular.  Price point I feel was spot on. Portions are large enough for 2 sittings. Large variety of craft beers and desserts that sounded amazing. I intend on going back just for dessert tomorrow. Just ran out of room for it.  If you enjoy BBQ give Bells a shot. They won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Went there tonight for the first time and we loved it! The guy behind the counter whom also brought our food out was very helpful and friendly and the food was very good! I had the brisket sandwich and the meat was so tender. Definitely a must try. We will for sure be back."}
{"text":"I love the BBQ here. We had a party 2 months ago and had them catered . I come here often for lunch and dinner too. Great food, pricing is reasonable and great service"}
{"text":"We had ordered take out from here once before but decided to dine in the other day. The service was amazing and the employees were over the top friendly. The food was great and our two kids ate free because it was Tuesday! Great experience!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! Food and service was awesome! Got to meet the owner and hear their story. Great story! Goes along with their awesome food!"}
{"text":"It was OK.... Had much better and had worse.  Service was kinda slow but they did come around many times while eating to make sure we were doing ok."}
{"text":"A great traditional southern bbq joint. It's short on atmosphere and long on great food. Pork belly, ribs, greens, chicken. It's all great. The meats aren't cooked in any sauce so getting things with dry rub/no sugar is easy."}
{"text":"The pulled pork sandwich is put in a Texas type toast which is wonderful. The bread is very tasty and the   deserts are also great.  I will be back to eat at Bells it is wonderful to have a 5a bbq place near me. Go there the food is wonderful you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place has really good reviews so we were excited to try it. The employees were friendly and helpful. I told them it was my first time there and they explained things well. I ordered the brisket, pulled pork sandwich and chicken strips to go. The pulled pork was quite good. Tender and not fatty. Barbecue sauce is flavorful. Chicken strips were good too. Red beans and rice were really good. Unfortunately the brisket was awful. I'm hoping maybe it was just a bad day because I've seen good reviews on the brisket. I ordered it lean. It came very fatty and not tender at all. It was chewy and I couldn't even cut it with a knife. Very strange since brisket is usually fall apart tender at other places. There was literally not one piece that was edible. It's pretty pricey too which is fine if it's good food. So we were very disappointed in that. I will probably try it again because some things were really good, just not the brisket.  So we tried Bells again and I updated to 4 stars. We had the pulled pork again which is quite good and tried the 1/2 chicken. The chicken was moist and flavorful. Still won't be trying the brisket again but my husband loves the red beans and rice so I'm sure we'll be back."}
{"text":"Ok I tried this place again and looks like if you don't enjoy a heavy fatty piece of brisket, just ask for it lean!   Service was speedy and the sides tasted great. Really enjoyed the 4 cheese corn niblet. I could have eaten like 10 of those!   Plus don't forget about the yelp check in for $5 off purchase of over 25 buck!"}
{"text":"THE spot for BBQ in Henderson if you ask me. The meats (pulled pork is my go-to) and sauces available are truly mouth-watering, and I love that the meat is served on top of the Texas toast, turning it into a palate cleanser that also complements the rich flavors of your main dish. Their selection is sides is also to-die-for. Try the corn on the cob with cheese for added mmm!  Portions are sizable and the staff is super friendly. Make sure to sign up for their rewards program if you're a fan!"}
{"text":"Tried this place today based on my coworkers suggestion and also because it was her birthday. We had a party of six and when the waitress came to the table she didn't introduce herself and said they only had three menus ? WTH? Mind you we were the only ones in the restaurant.  The food was ok. I had the brisket which was very dry, the cheese corn, crispy Brussels sprouts and Mac and cheese, let's just say the corn and Brussel sprouts were the best out of my entire meal. I really wanted to try the beef ribs but they were out ( which I wasn't informed of by the waitress until I ordered them) the rest of my coworkers  said the food was ok as well , they had a variety of the greens, pulled chicken sandwich, pork belly sandwich. Overall I might give them a second chance and try the beef ribs if they have them on the menu"}
{"text":"Finally made it to this restaurant and boy are we glad we did!! We ordered takeout.  When I called to place my order the man on the phone was soooo nice and patient.  He said it would be ready in 15-20 minutes and it was ready when we got there.  As soon as you pull up the aromas are so enticing it makes you anxious to want to eat! We ordered 6 bone baby back ribs with smashed potatoes and mac and cheese. Another order but this one with mac and cheese and crispy brussel sprouts (Yum!). Also a side of pork belly, buffalo fried cauliflower (so good!) and a sweet cheesecake jar.  Everything was packed beautifully and everything we ordered was DELICIOUS  all the way down to their signature BBQ sauce. The portions are HUGE including the ribs. They have a great menu with a large/great selection of sides all of which I cannot wait to try. Really a great asset to our community and I wish them continued success."}
{"text":"We LOVE Bell's BBQ! If I could give more stars, I would. The customer service is top notch, after visiting about 2 months after our first visit, the owner remembered my husband and I, even where we sat in the restaurant! You order at the counter, then seat yourself but there is always a server offering refills and taking away dishes. They have a lot of different menu options, we have tried several main course meats as well as several side dishes. We were lucky enough to have their pork belly the first visit, the second visit we were too close to closing and they had run out. The pork belly is by far the best I've ever had, and the home made pickles, as well as pickle chips are some of the stars, in my opinion. The sauces are delicious, especially the mustard! Portions are huge, appropriately priced, and overall delicious. YOU MUST GET THE FLUFFER NUTTER SWEET JAR FOR DESSERT. (That's the only one we have tried but I'm sure the others are just as good) My husband and I split the dessert and were fighting over who got to take the last bite. We even had some the next day, and the mousse turned into a fudge-like consistency and it was the most decadent dessert I've ever had. Overall phenomenal service and food. This is on the top of our list to bring family and friends to when they come to visit!"}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time eating at this place. The food is worth going back for. What I thought was really worth commenting about was the ownership of the place. While we were waiting in line a woman with a \" Emotional Support Animal \" (a dog) was in front of us. When she went to order the owner very politely let her know he did not allow dogs inside the restaurant. She then told him it it was an ESA and she had the right to have the dog with her during her meal. The owner again very patiently explained that they had an incident where 2 \" ESA \" dogs had gotten in a fight inside the restaurant and a customer was bit.  The owner said that the woman was more than welcome to enjoy her meal with her dog in the outdoor seating area and they would bring her food out to her when ready.  She then insisted that they had to eat inside as her dog was allergic and or would try and eat the decorative plants in the outside area and again they must be allowed to sit inside.    The owner again explained that it was his policy and that she would not be allowed to sit inside with her \" ESA \" dog. She then threatened to call the Justice Department if she could not eat inside and again the owner said no, but was more than welcome to sit outside. At this point she stormed out.     The long and short of this is, the owner was more than accomodating to the lady and her animal, he was never rude, and gave her an option to still enjoy a great meal even after she was completely rude to him.   I will be eating here plenty more....lol!!  And BTW the crispy Brussel sprouts are amazing!!"}
{"text":"Great food!! This bbq southern food place is satisfying, inviting, friendly and delicious! it's casual dining, reasonably priced,  the portions are to satisfy ! beverages and beer are available as well. the beef brisket was the best I've tasted in vegas! Ashley and staff was happy to please ! if i had to say one thing , it's a little slow getting your food (worth it) but would of given 5 stars if food was out a little faster."}
{"text":"Very good BBQ. I had the Brisket Sandwich with Mac and Cheese, and a side of Garlic Mashed. Both sides were very good. I'll also say that Bricket  isnt my top choice, but I saw someone eating it and I changed my order. Im very glad I did, it tasted great. Cooked perfectly, nice smoke ring, and it was a good sized sandwich. It comes on a double sized texas toast bun, something ive never seen before, but its twice the size of a normal bun. It was filled with meat, not all bread. Very cool. I also ordered the Banana pudding. I got home and i was wondering why it weighed so much. It comes in a glass jar!!!! Its a decent size portion, and it taste great. Couldnt be more happier. My buddy also ordered the pulled chicken sandwich and he loved it. He had the Onion strings and loved them. All in all a great BBQ, and im heading back very soon for the 10 Bone St Loius ribs. Cant wait. The only issue is there not open for lunch. They said they would be soon, but nothing yet."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I usually order the brisket with a side of Brussel sprouts and fried pickles. Truly I think almost everything here is really good!"}
{"text":"It's the best BBQ I've had so far in Vegas, besides Rolling Smoke which is also good. The pork belly... fatty goodness! Their St Louis ribs.. to die for! Perfectly cooked, fall off the bone without being mush. Their CHEESE ENCRUSTED CORN... IM OBSESSED. Definitely a great meal. Little on the pricey side, but worth it. The Smores dessert was also a great order."}
{"text":"This is a great place for BBQ & some great southern food! Fried green tomatoes are awesome! Great customer service! A must try!"}
{"text":"Yum! I love a good BBQ! Tried this place for the first time tonight and it was very good. I ordered the brisket and it was very tender with great flavor. The brisket was really good, but the standout tonight was definitely the bbq sauce. The original has a really good flavor, but the spicy one was delicious with a kick. Excellent taste and spicy level was perfect.   I also really liked the Caesar slaw. Genius! The boyfriend ordered a side of the pork and said it was good. A happy boyfriend makes my life easier. The mashed potatoes were a little boring for my taste... but a little spicy bbq sauce fixed them right up.   The service was very friendly and helpful. Kudos to smiling staff - it really makes a place standout. I can't wait to try more options from the side menu and maybe check out a dessert jar. I also ordered a glass of wine to drink while I waited the takeout. Total bill was about $50, which is pretty good for quality BBQ"}
{"text":"St. Louis ribs were dry, boiled and no flavor, catfish was greasy and overly salty. Sides were good, BBQ beans, yams, Brussels sprouts, Caesar slaw all were plentiful. Service was okay."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and after considering quality of food, prices, portions, service general feel of what a BBQ place should be like I give his place 5 stars. It may be the best BBQ in town. I love this place."}
{"text":"The wife and I ate at Bell's today.   The service was excellent .  The food was not totally to our liking .  The red beans and rice had a barbecue flavor....   The yams were great.   Did not like the texture of the Brisket."}
{"text":"Everything was amazing!  The pulled pork, pulled chicken, fried okra, Mac n cheese, fried pickles and above all the red beans and rice. My son ate everything on his plate which is impressive. We will definitely be back and can't wait to try the deviled egg potato salad."}
{"text":"We hosted a surprise party at Bell's last night and it was fabulous! Stephanie, one of the owners, helped me plan everything long distance and she is just incredible. We were looking for a casual restaurant with great food, and Bell's was the perfect choice. We had 30 guests, and a guitarist and there was plenty of room for everyone to spread out and be comfortable. From the St Louis ribs, brisket and chicken, to the Mac and cheese, Brussel sprouts and crispy onions, to the amazing Sweet Tea and Sweet Jars for dessert - it was mouthwateringly delicious. And a shout out to Megan who was our dedicated server. She really did an excellent job. If you aren't able to have a party, or go to a party at Bell's make sure you get there to have lunch or dinner. I live in NY and have had lots of BBQ, and there is none better. And the prices are reasonable too. I guarantee you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My wife hates most BBQ chicken because it's really dry. However, Bell's 1/2 chicken is incredibly moist and my wife likes to eat healthy so she orders a double order of salad. Me, I like their brisket, and ribs, and sausage - nice sides - with quite a variety of starches. Some neat desserts in mason jars too.  Usually go about once a week when in Vegas / Henderson."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great atmosphere, definitely the place to go for BBQ, try their Sweet Jars!"}
{"text":"James and the entire staff were extremely attentive and friendly. This was our first time here and we will definitely be back. The fried pickles and the Mac n Cheese were amazing!"}
{"text":"WOW - Bells has ruined all other BBQ places for me forever.  I travel for a living and always look for the best BBQ. My search has ended. Their food is like a party in your mouth.   I had the St Louis ribs, fried pickles, four cheese corn, pork belly and banana pudding.  Everything I had was fresh and extremely flavorful.  They have a knack for combining flavors that will blow your mind.    As if the food was not enough, their staff is amazing.   We were served by Ava and could not have been happier.  Her vivacious personally is addictive and her knowledge of the menu was outstanding.    Be sure to try the four cheese corn on the cob - you will not be disappointed.   Trust me - go here."}
{"text":"I'm really excited to have a good BBQ place near the house. It was clean and prices were not bad. Most importantly, the food was good. The sauces that accompany them is tasty. I particularly like the BBQ chicken. My husband got the beef brisket. It was good as well. There are several items on the menu that I would like to try next time- including the po boy, the dessert jars, and the okra fries.  Next time I will not order a side of shrimp for 6.00 because it was 3 tiny little pieces, the size that you get when there's 80-100 per pound. Teeny.  Otherwise very happy."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food. It's a little on the pricy side, but you get what you pay for. The portions are hardy and filling. I always get it delivered when I'm crazing amazing bbq."}
{"text":"Excellent food! We tried the dry rub ribs, pork bellies,  Mac and Cheese, BBQ beans, yams, Cheesecake, and s'mores. Finally, great BBQ in Henderson!"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that I'm only not giving them 5 stars because the service was just a bit slow and the space isn't larger ..... and nobody beats my Grandma's BBQ!!!  Called ahead to reserve a space for 9 bigs and 2 littles @ 7:30pm.  We should have placed the food order in advance too; lesson learned.  -  Ordered from the catering menu which included a little of everything for $189. Ribs, Hot Links, Brisket, Pulled Pork & Chicken. A whole chicken cut up & 6 sides of our choice: Braised Southern Greens, (2 x) 3 Cheese Mac, Fries, Mashed Yams and Cheesy Grits.  There was more than enough food - (I happily took home plenty of leftovers; which they packed up and boxed it all, for ease of transporting.) Total was $240 with soft drinks, a glass of wine & separate gluten free dinner and a side of mini buns.   The food here is southern and good!! No desserts had on this visit, but the previously devoured Smore's, Creme Brûlée and Caramelized Banana treats were all yummy."}
{"text":"This has honestly just become a new fav for me. It's hard to catch it from Eastern because it's in a retail / office complex and not a standalone building.   The menu has all kinds of options from ribs to pulled pork/chicken, and a bunch of sides to choose from. We had the St Louis Ribs and pulled chicken. Wow! it was good.   They also have a great kids menu, especially if they aren't in to BBQ. Our kids had corn dogs and Mac n cheese.   While there food was amazing, I was most shocked with their customer service. The employees came by several time to make sure we had everything we needed, refilled our drinks several times, and even cleaned our table off when we were done. In addition, the owner and head chef came out to welcome us and thank us for coming in...wow!!!  We will definitely be back. This place just exceeded my expectations!"}
{"text":"UPDATE: since writing the below review, Bells has great new employees and still great food. This is a normal lunch dinner date for the hub & me and we love you guys!! Thanks :)    Couldn't help myself from updating this review. We love Stephanie and the manager with glasses. They are awesome as well as the back staff. The guy with dreads and the guy who sometimes works the register are awesome."}
{"text":"It was a good experience and the staff was very friendly! I had their ribs, Mac n cheese, and BBQ beans. Their ribs were very good BUT the BQQ sauce wasn't the best, I think they should have more of a variety to the sauces. The mac n cheese was delicious! and the beans were a fail bc it tasted like chili rather than BBQ beans. I would probably go back but would change some things on my order ."}
{"text":"Very close to home, we came in right before closing and ordered.  My pulled pork sandwich was amazing.  Love the onion strings.  Has cobbler dessert  was very good.  They treat you right and fill you up.  Must try."}
{"text":"We are blessed to have many BBQ options available in Henderson.   Many are good.  Bell's is right up there at the top of the heap!  So what makes Bell's better than the others?  Yes, that have all the regular BBQ basics...ribs, chicken, pork, etc.  in addition, they offer items the others don't. House specialties, if you will...  Shrimp and Grits - Outstanding!  Beef Ribs - Best I have ever had anywhere!  Sweet Jars - Small desserts...just the right size. I would tell you my favorite, but I have eaten them all and haven't found one that isn't my favorite.   House-made pickles.  5 choices of house-made BBQ Sauce including a gluten free option if that is important to you.   No matter what you desire, they have you covered.   Worth the drive if you eat there or take home or have it delivered.  Yes we are blessed in Henderson.   Thank you Bell's!"}
{"text":"We stopped here because we were in the area. It was amazing! We got the pulled chicken and pulled pork meals with smashed potatoes coleslaw mac and cheese and brussel sprout. Everything was delicious and more than we expected! The honey mustard bbq sauce was the best. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Skip this place, it needs help. What little meat came on my 12 dollar sandwich was full of fat. The Mac and cheese is a joke, more like cheese soup. The floor was sticky and the staff was less than friendly. I had high hopes for an authentic BBQ place but this is not it."}
{"text":"After seeing a few IG pics(thanks Shirley B) I knew I needed to try Bell's BBQ. A very clean dining room with an open kitchen you get to see what going on with the food.  I opted for the pulled pork sandwich and some brisket on the side, with an actual side of mac n cheese. The pulled pork was stuffed between a thick slice of Texas toast perfectly grilled on each side. Brisket was still juicy and was melt in your mouth texture. Mac n cheese was also good, served with some crackers baked into it. I got to try some of my wife's St Louis ribs. I am a fan of Baby backs and she forgot to ask for them, they were a little tough for me but still had excellent flavor. I have bben back since and will definitely come back for some more of the BBQ in no time."}
{"text":"Me & my boyfriend tried this place a couple weeks ago and its SOOOOO GOOD!! I definitely recommend this place to anyone who is craving some good BBQ food at a reasonable price! Also the service is great, everyone is so nice and helpful especially our first time in. 5 STARS!!"}
{"text":"We came here for some post hike nourishment, and this is what we got:  Good: 3 cheese corn, Brussels Sprouts  Okay: Pulled Brisket Sandwich, Gritz, Mac and cheese  Not so good: Fried Green Tomatoes, Beef Ribs  *Beef Ribs, Fridays and Saturdays only, 3 ribs, $16.95...originally going with St. Louis Ribs, it was highly suggested by one of the workers...bad move, ONE of the three ribs were edible, the other two were more bone than meat, and were dried out, and I've had beef ribs that were meatier and fell off the bone. Bell's ribs were disappointing. The Banana Sweet Jar we got a taste of was very good though.  Most of the sides and sweets are where it's at...sadly, not for the BBQ....ALOHA!!!  Shaka Meter:  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  3"}
{"text":"Ordered the Brisket with mashed yams and Brussels Sprouts! Delicious food  and it Definitely hit the spot on my cravings. My fiancé ordered Brisket with the BBQ BEANS. He has no complaints about his meal."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I was impressed by the portions, the many different sides they offer, and how delicious everything was! I love the fact that it's family owned and how friendly all the workers were. There were also many different BBQ sauces."}
{"text":"Love the sandwiches here sooooooo much!!! They just do everything we have tried so well but the corn that is crusted in 4 cheeses just can't describe have to try!!!!!! Try and have some desert if ya have room."}
{"text":"This place is about a 3.5 star restaurant.  Better than average but not necessarily warranting a 4 or 5 star rating.  Ordered the brisket and funny enough we found it to be too lean and a little bit dry.  I know others have complained that it was too fatty - we actually like a bit of fat in our meats.  Ordered a pork belly and st Louis rib add on.  Very solid food.  Nothing great but not bad either.  For me, the side dishes were the best part.  We got the baked beans and the mashed yams.  I'll probably just go back and order 1 of each of the sides!!"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff. I will definitely be back on my next trip to Las Cegas."}
{"text":"Great place has good food and mac was astonishing. Was nice service and great value for quality was great"}
{"text":"Amazing amazing desserts. They even come in little glass mason jars they let you keep. Yumm! I love the s'mores one :)"}
{"text":"we decided to give bell's a go and ordered take out - heres what we got:  * beef ribs * brisket * red beans n rice * bbq beans * potato salad * mac n cheese * cheese encrusted corn * fried pickles * buffalo cauliflower bites * creme brule * smores  the counter service wasnt the greatest and staff couldve been a little friendly, at least? the girl who packed our food didnt do a thorough check to make sure everything was there so our mac n cheese was missing when we got home :/ luckily, we called n got them to deliver it to us!!  overall food flavor a solid 3.5 - bbq was good, but not the best ;)"}
{"text":"We decided to stay home and have our dinner delivered. Not only was it here within 20 minutes, but it was hot, great presentation, everything wrapped correctly, nothing spilled=BBQ sauce!  The brisket was tender and no fat, hubby had pulled pork ribs sandwich on Texas toast and it was huge!  I loved the the smashed yams with vanilla and brown sugar. We shared the banana pudding dessert in a jar and it was incredible. Thank you for such a great dinner and we got to stay home!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ok, so I've never been a fan of BBQ but decided to give it a try. I cannot believe the sandwich menu, pulled pork, brisket, and poboys! So I get a Shrimp Poboy with the 3 Cheese Mac. And I'm still in awe. It come out on a huge piece of Texas toast toasted to perfection. The house BBQ sauce was the last touch. It was such an amazing meal! Will definitely be returning!!"}
{"text":"First time here today. Great pulled pork sandwich and cheesy grits. Food very good and prices reasonable and quick friendly service. I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"First visit. Everyone was SO nice and helpful!  Loved the baby backs!!!!!  I know some don't like \"fall off the bone\", but I do. They were perfection for me. Original sauce is to dye for.  Got brisket for hubby (I don't care for brisket), he loved. Sweet potatoes we good, just different, I'd get again."}
{"text":"Overall the food was just mediocre. The Mac and cheese was very bland, and the sandwich bread was really greasy.  I did like how the sandwich looked when they brought it out, but it was very hard to eat like a normal sandwich. I ended up treating it more like a bread bowl.  As for the service, they needed a red bull or something. Between the girl and guy upfront, it took them 5 minutes to bag our food once it was finished. There was no other orders, it was just them dragging their butts.   I may try it again since it's close to my house, but it definitely won't be on my go-to dinner spot list."}
{"text":"I would have expected a higher rating from this place since I've been to 2 other BBQ places and this one is far better in my opinion. They have a great check-in special. You get a free side by checking in. I ordered the Pulled Pork sandwich which came with 1 side and got my free one. I had the cheese grits and Brussel sprouts and the sides were exceptional. The sandwich was huge and was presented as a stuffed Texas toast sandwich. It was closed on the bottom and so it was easier to eat. There was PLENTY of meat like a dinner portion would have.  The staff was pleasant and stopped by to check in on us. My wife said the collard greens were much better than other places. The prices reflected the value and portion sizes.  All in all I'm really happy with this place."}
{"text":"Had the pull pork and pulled chicken. Both of them are exceptional. The sauce has just enough spice not too sweet. Great service great price. You cannot go wrong"}
{"text":"Bell's BBQ is the best we've had in The Valley! Fried okra is my fave side  Brisket is so tender!"}
{"text":"Food was great sides are fresh and the sweet jars are to die for! Thanks balil great server asked to refill my drink."}
{"text":"Ate her for the first time this past weekend and couldn't be more disappointed.  For the 4 of us it was $90.00!  They added on the tip when we ordered our food so we felt obligated to do 15% and all the girl did was bring out our food.  We didn't see her again.  This is not a sit down, order and be served restaurant, this is a walk up, order, get your own drinks and have your food brought out to you restaurant.  My husband had a full slab of what was supposed to be baby back ribs that were tough and fatty, I had the 1/2 BBQ chicken that was dry and chopped up oddly so I kept chewing on bones, my older son also ordered 1/2 slab of baby back ribs (again, very tough and fatty) and our youngest son had the mini corn dogs which were over cooked. Even though everything else was bad, we decided to try one of their sweet jar desserts.  We got the banana pudding and that took about 15 minutes to get and it was not even remotely good.  The best thing about the meal was the iced tea, I mixed half regular with half sweet tea.  I've had lots of different BBQ and this is one place I would never go back to and will not recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"We've been looking for a BBQ place in Vegas for a while. Seems like nobody can get it right. That was until we discovered Bell's BBQ. Excellent food, giant servings, and friendly staff.  Make sure you save room for the jar deserts."}
{"text":"Ordered take out for dinner one night... came home and WOAH huge portions! I can see why this place is so highly recommend on yelp so we decided to try for ourselves.  I personally don't eat red meat so I had the chicken breast tenders with the devil egg salad and assorted fries. The chicken tenders were long strips of tender breast meat with just the right amount of batter, so it wasn't too oily. It was placed on top a huge piece of Texas toast and onion strings. Mmmmmmm  Each plate comes with two sides of choice. They have so many different sides I couldn't pick just two, so I'd have to go back and try more.   And don't forget for all you Yelpers out there... $5 off your order when you check in!"}
{"text":"Better than Lucilles.  Friendly staff and nice calm quiet atmosphere.  Food is served with pride and mastery!"}
{"text":"So yummy. Brisket melts in your mouth. Mac and cheese was hot and creamy. Defiantly will be back. Rivals another BBQ place that's kinda far north from me."}
{"text":"Let's just say I've consumed A LOT of bbq, and this place is....okay. I couldn't decide between 3 stars and 4 stars, but decided to go with 3 because I'm on the fence and couldn't get passed their fried okra.  So, to put the visit in a nutshell and cap the food: their meats are good. My brisket wasn't as hot as I'd have preferred in when served, but it happens. Their sauces are delicious, so I was happy.  What I was VERY disappointed in was their fried okra. The okra was mushy. Fried okra is not supposed to be super mushy. Sorry. Not good. I think part of it is the way they cut it like french fries rather than in rounds like most places do (including how my grandma used to make fried okra.)  Bell's leaves a little bit to be desired, but if you're in the area and have a hankering for some bbq, I wouldn't count this place out by any means.   Would I come back here? Probably.  Would I recommend this place to others? Absolutely, with the caveat of \"do not order their fried okra.\" Lol."}
{"text":"Was disappointed by what Bells puts out as bbq. ordered brisket with a beef rib on the side. the order i picked up was more like 1oz of jerky on a bone and some of the driest brisket ive ever had.  i was shocked to see two bones in my beef rib order thinking id scored some extra meat. what i got though was an overcooked dose of mass amounts of paperlike membrane. the small amount of meat i did get was overcooked, dry, and almost jerky like in texture. brisket was just as overcooked it seemed. they tried to help by covering it with sauce (using a sauce different from the one i ordered and got on the side :-\ ) but it didn't help.  sides were mediocre. mac and cheese was good onion straws were solid but nothing to go back for. nothing really was. ill stick to mulls and lucielles"}
{"text":"Unfortunately we did not enjoy our meal here as much as our fellow Yelpers.  They were out of St. Louis ribs and brisket when we stopped by for dinner.  I opted instead for the pulled chicken (note thst it is both white and dark meat) with corn on the cobb and yams.  We both found the sauce to have an odd flavor that I cannot put my finger on, but it was way too much like molasses.  The corn on the cobb was old, and the yams were bland, but okay.  Interestingly, the house made pickles were my favorite thing on the plate.    John got the baby back ribs with cole slaw and mac n' cheese.  He said the ribs were just ok (and for the price he's had way better), we both thought the slaw was good, and the mac was bland and dry.  All and all, I might come back to try the St. Louis ribs and Brisket, but it won't be my first choice for BBQ."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Nevada!!! I ordered a party platter and was definitely awesome! By the way fried shrimp and chicken wings are phenomenal(pro tip)"}
{"text":"bell's is a nice option for bbq if you live in the area and don't feel like trekking somewhere farther out. had the brisket, pretty good but had to dump quite a bit of sauce over it, but that's more personal taste.  mac and cheese was OK, nothing too special, but the cheese grits were very good, would recommend if you're a grits fan.  hubby ordered the pork belly, pretty yummy except there is fat in this cut of meat so be warned, but if you like pork belly it's a good one to order.  the texas toast was no bueno...thumbs down.  it sat under the pulled pork, after one bite i scooped the meat out of the way and just ate it without the bread.  it was burnt and dry, not at all what texas toast should be.  overall its a decent bbq place close to home. i forgot to mention the service....excellent and super friendly staff.  always came by our table and checked on us and the gentleman who took our order was patient and helpful as this was our first visit. :)"}
{"text":"It was pretty delicious and the staff was so nice.  The brussel sprouts were fantastic.  My husband loved the beef ribs and my chopped brisket was flavorful. The smashed potatoes were only good not great, and the reason for four stars, not five."}
{"text":"I don't judge a BBQ place for its meats, anyone can smoke meat. I judge a BBQ joint for its sauces and sides. There are some other nearby places but this one is by far the best I've had in Vegas. It reminded me a lot of classic Western NC BBQ. I ordered a pork a la carte, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, and mac and cheese. Having had those ill probably be back for the okra, baked beans, corn coblet, and coleslaw. Maybe even a pickle stick. Possibly one of those sweet jars.   So yeah this was all delicious. I picked it up and brought it home, roughly a 10 minute drive. Everything was still warm but I'm sure the drive made the cauliflower and Brussels sprouts a little less crispy. It was still delicious and I ate them all!   This left much less room for the pork and mac & cheese, but I still had to try them. The pork was a bit dry but I got a nice serving of House BBQ sauce.  It's a standard sauce, a bit on the sweet side. My dog definitely enjoyed the scraps I gave her. The mac & cheese is definitely homemade and worth getting.   I'll be back. It's a small space but there was an outdoor table or three if you wanted to do that."}
{"text":"My friends and I had a solid meal here! The customer service is amazing. The employees are genuinely friendly. The menu selection is huge! The food was a solid \"good\" but not quite \"great.\" My pork belly was the exception...it was to die for! The brisket seemed a little dry and I wouldn't order it again. The potato salad and BBQ beans were, again, good but not special. The different sauces were good! We had a blast and I will definitely come again and try some different items."}
{"text":"Some of the best catfish in town!! And they have it two ways! thank you Bell's for finally making catfish I can almost compare to my grandpa's!!! SO GOOD!! And huge portion with many awesome sides to choose from! Your Rad!!"}
{"text":"Loved It! We were greeted immediately and taken care of by the friendly staff. Catfish was hot, moist, and crispy. Mac & Cheese is pretty good. I prefer my brisket to be flavorful so I request it to be on the fatty side. Barbecue sauce was tasty. The Smores Dessert is Delicious!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service -- and GREAT fried green tomatoes. A taste of the south here in the Las Vegas valley!"}
{"text":"Just tried this little gem yesterday from a friend reference, WOW!! Grilled Brussel Sprouts, buffalo cauliflower, shrimp & grits, pulled pork.....oh my!! This is a MUST if you appreciate authentic Southern eats. Everything we are amongst the 7 of us was amazing. This little hide away is also family owned, my favorite kind of place! Go & enjoy!"}
{"text":"Awesome BBQ!! The brisket was amazing, the Mac n cheese was perfect and the hot tots and pickles were really good too. My favorite was the BBQ sauce and the mustard that they have. My kids and my husband loved it!! I'd love to try one of the desserts we were just way too full lol. Also, the restaurant was clean and the staff was really nice. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Great bbq. I had the bbq rib sandwich and the three cheese macaroni and cheese. The both were great!  The meat was tender and the sandwich was huge. The customer service was awesome!  I will definitely come back the next time I'm back in Vegas. I recommend you try this place, you'll love it!"}
{"text":"My BBQ rib sandwich was delicious! My daughter had the chicken and waffles that we're all so amazing! The portions are huge the restaurant is clean and the staff is friendly! The side of Mac n cheese is delicious!"}
{"text":"My husband loves the dessert jars!  I crave the cauliflower!  Great environment!  Great food! Great staff!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff , just not the kind of BBQ I was expecting :( the chicken was really dry & the mac & cheese had no flavor & barely any cheese , kind of felt like I was just eating a plain noodle :("}
{"text":"Excellence service n food. It was my first time n the service was great! The ribs were the best ever! Mac & cheese was good the sweet mash could use some cinnamon in my opinion,  but we're good also! Kicked Famous Dave's  and Lucille's in the butt in taste n price! Looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"The St Louis ribs are good. Moist tender and falls off the bone  The red beans and rice is really good  The pickles they give you on the side are the bomb! This is not a sit down and order type restraunt but my order was brought out quickly and with a smile"}
{"text":"Definitely great to have a great BBQ place not to far from the house, especially one that is really good. I had the Brisket meal with BBQ Beans and Three Cheese mac, my wife and I had the same. It was very good the Brisket was very moist, it literally melts in your mouth. Both side were very good. On top of that we had there jar of cheesecake for dessert, by far one of the best desserts I have ever had."}
{"text":"Ordered a brisket platter with fries and \"smashed potatoes\"  Sides were excellent.  I enjoyed the variety of fries given.  Curly, regular, waffle, yam, crinkle, etc all in the same order!  The smashed potatoes with roasted garlic was also excellent, however, a little deceiving... Its really just smooth creamy mashed potatoes (no chunks).  The brisket which was served on texas toast and topped with fried onions was good.  A touch on the dry side though.  I was also hoping for a little bark on the brisket, and a little more composure of the meat... ie I don't really care for the meat falling apart on its own.  I'd rather have a little more chew to it.  The BBQ sauces offered were ok, but to me a little sweet (all of them).  The mustard-based BBQ sauce was probably my favorite.  Also tried a red velvet cake sweet jar.  They are really not kidding when they say SWEET jar.  It is really sweet!  Little too much for me, but my kid liked it.  Not bad prices, everything was fresh.  Great place for a quick BBQ bite!"}
{"text":"We stopped here on the way home one night and ordered the brisket, baby back ribs and the catfish. Everything was delicious! Super tender meat, crispy fish, yummy sides (definitely recommend the green tomatoes) and the spicy BBQ sauce is spot on. And on the recommendation of the staff we got the banana pudding which is as cute as it is tasty. All around a great new local place - we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast on Saturday and Sunday only. No wait and is local family owned."}
{"text":"We are locals here (part of the year here, part elsewhere).  We eat out every single day. We recognize that the restaurant business is a difficult and tricky business to achieve success in. We eat in divey out of the way places and in high end restaurants (think Hank's in GVR).  It is with this in mind we write reviews.  Bells is hidden away in a small business center.  It is worth discovering!  We gave it a try for the first time and were dazzled by the quality, quantity, value and deliciousness of their BBQ.     I personally LOVE good BBQ and am usually disappointed with most BBQ joints.  Bell's is the exception!  A small family run business with an excellent menu that will satisfy even those who are not BBQ aficionados.  Wonderful starters, plates that are full and tasty that you can add additional items to.   I've always thought it a flaw in the BBQ arena of offering plates of one thing, but not having some add-ons so patrons can try other stuff.  As an example, I love ordering the pork plate, but I'd also like some ribs or chicken.   Bell's has solved that problem with their wonderful menu.      The meats were smoked and delicious. The plates were full and the sides (I'm partial to the mac and the beans) are big.  The seating is comfortable casual and the chatter, service and attention is excellent.  The pricing is really good for what you get - knowing that good BBQ is not a \"cheap eats\" but when one receives quality and quantity for the money they pay, they walk away happy.    We commend Bell's to you and urge you to satisfy the BBQ craving in their small restaurant. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We are constantly looking for a good BBQ restaurant - my husband is from Austin and loves his BBQ!   We have finally found it at Bell's!  Amazing food - I want to try all of  the side dishes.  The pulled pork is probably the best I have ever had!   Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Awesome awesome awesome customer service! Love the sweet jar selection, can't wait to try one next time.  4 stars earned for cleanliness, ease of the menu, and sharp staff on duty. The brisket was a bit dry, but the sauces are AWESOME!! Mac n cheese was phenomenal!!"}
{"text":"Finally, we have a real BBQ joint near Anthem. We had the baby backs on Tuesday and leftovers today (Thursday). The ribs were knock down awesome. Just enough smoke flavor to place them amongst the best I have ever had (sorry Famous Dave). The sauce(s) were very tasty. Wasn't too excited about the beans and rice and the mac and cheese but they weren't too bad at all. Service was friendly, quick and our order was accurately filled. We plan to go back soon and often."}
{"text":"This place has some tasty BBQ sandwiches.  In the last month I have had the Pulled Pork, Chicken, and Brisket sandwiches and they are tasty and filling.  The house BBQ sauce is excellent!  If you get a sandwich and drink it will end up costing around $13-$14 which is on the high end of BBQ lunches but the saving grace is that they do have the punch card deal where the fifth sandwich is free.  It turns lunch into a quest!"}
{"text":"Really awesome food.  Love the big selection of side dishes! Staff was friendly and attentive.  Great for kids casual atmosphere"}
{"text":"This place is yummy! We ordered the Ribs Party Pack which said enough for 10 people, That was an understatement! We had left overs.. and there were 14 of us! Ribs were tender,chicken very flavorful even without sauce . Pulled pork and brisket very flavorful. Cole slaw tasty and fresh! And potato salad was spicy yet yummy. I highly recommend this for your family and friends."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery last night. Delivery arrived with 30 minutes. Food was warm and delicious. We ordered: Brisket, St Louis Ribs, Baby Back Ribs, greens, rice & beans, mac & cheese, brussel sprouts, fried okra, banana pudding, and creme brulee. ... everything was amazing. We will be ordering again!"}
{"text":"I have been to Bells Barbeque several times and the food has been excellent every time.  This time I ordered the Chicken and Waffles, a dish I rarely order as I don't fried food very often.  Thre Chicken and Waffles were outstanding and I would definitely order it again and recommend it.  I got this to go and the Chicken and Waffles was all cut into bite size pieces. It came with 2 sides, and I had the Caesar slaw and green potato salad (the green is pesto sauce."}
{"text":"Delicious baby back ribs. I tried the spicy bbq sauce which was to die for. Mac n cheese side was crazy creamy and full of flavor. Deviled egg salad tasted freshly made. Pulled pork sandwich was one of the best sandwiches we've had in a while, the meat was so flavorful and the bread was buttery and toasted to perfection. Our server was uber friendly and helpful. We took home three desert jars the carmelized banana, cheesecake & the key lime which was my favorite. Our server also told us if we brought the jar back we would be put in a raffle!!! Extra points! We will be back to try the whole menu."}
{"text":"We placed an order for pickup thru grub hub, I don't know where to start on this one as I'm pretty conflicted overall. The first thing is when I pulled up to pick up the order, there was no \"smoke smell\", It was around 5, so the smokers should still be fired up.  Décor was nice, staff was friendly, even threw in an extra beef rib because they were \"small\" all together we ordered: 3 Bone Beef Ribs with Okra Fries, 4 Cheese Crusted Corn Coblet Add 1 St. Louis Bone Add 2 Baby Back Loin Bones Add 3 Salt and Pepper Crusted Catfish Fillets Cameron's Southern Fried Chicken Breast Strips with Mashed Yams and 3 Cheese Mac Buffalo Fried Cauliflower  The mac and cheese was bland, no flavor, just pasta in sauce, topped with cheese and cracker  The Mashed yams tasted exactly like that, yams that were cooked and mashed, that's it, nothing added to them, we had to add some butter and brown sugar.  All of the Ribs, were tender, just about fall off the bone, but had little to no seasoning, and lacked any \"smoke\" flavor at all  The chicken tenders also had little/no seasoning  The sauces were alright, and I loved the salt n pepper catfish, didn't care for the crusted cheese corn or the buffalo cauliflower  If i did eat here again id only order the salt n pepper catfish"}
{"text":"My family used Bell's BBQ to cater my mother's 90th birthday party for 60 people. Food was ready for pick up on time and received rave reviews from all the guests and locals that attend the event. Will definitely go back to Bell's when I am in NV again. Thank you for helping making the day a success. (Bill E.)"}
{"text":"I have been three times now, every time has been great. The staff goes above and beyond to be welcoming and make sure you experience is worthwhile. The menu has something for everyone."}
{"text":"Brisket was amazing! Got it with a side of Mac and cheese and fried green tomatoes. Big enough potion to have leftovers. Maybe next time I will save room for a sweet jar, those sure looked yummy!"}
{"text":"I came here November 12, 2017, but hadn't had a chance to post my review. I had their catfish, fried and salt n pepper crusted, okra fries, and cheese grits. My bf had their BBQ ribs, 3 cheese mac, and red beans and rice. I also had Aunt Linda's Red Velvet sweet jar for dessert. The food was all really good! The red velvet sweet jar was toe curling good! I ordered online and was very happy with the way the food was packaged. They provided silverware, condiments, and plenty of napkins. The food was ready when promised. We were pleased with the food and service and have been talking about going again soon."}
{"text":"I ordered the st. Louis ribs tons of fat disgusting I also ordered the baby back ribs they had no taste horrible the mash potatoes are disgusting do they add  Elmer's glue and to them. I ordered sides of slice brisket loaded with oil and grease I spent $200 what a disappointment also the coleslaw so dry everything went in the garbage never again you're better off going to McDonald's"}
{"text":"This place was great. We have ate BBQ straight from the south. And this place being in Vegas is not bad, pretty close to straight southern BBQ. Over all conten and satisfied. FYI , the portions are big so brace yourself for a feast!!!!enjoy!!"}
{"text":"I'm not a BBQ aficionado by any means but I do enjoy it a few times a year and so far compared to other places in town that I have tried this is top on my list.   We ordered the Brisket, Half Chicken, Pulled Chicken, Mac & Cheese, Mashed Potatoes, Greens, BBQ Beans and the Banana Desert Jar.   Out of all the things we tried I have to say the Half Chicken, Mac & Cheese, Mashed Potatoes and the Banana Desert Jar were the shining stars for me. We did find that the greens didn't have enough fat used in it for our taste buds as it was very 1 note for us. Also the pulled chicken was very dry! We didn't understand why the girl at the register recommended it to us as we thought the Half Chicken was much much better in flavor and juiciness. The Mac & Cheese was amazing! So was the desert jar, it was PERFECTION.  This place gets a point for cute factor and friendliness and our next visit we plan to check out the ribs and pulled pork and that cheesy corn! Will be back!"}
{"text":"So I ordered baby back ribs with cheesy grits and \"smashed\" potatoes. My husband got brisket with potato salad and \"Hot Tots\" which describes them as hot links with ketchup. I prefer my ribs dry because if it's done right you don't need sauces to make it moist, flavorful, and tender. First the \"smashed\" potatoes were garlic mashed potatoes and not \"smashed\". Chef needs to know difference. Grits were extremely dense, but good. Brisket and ribs no real flavor until I added salt or when BBQ sauce added. It's all about the meat when it comes to BBQ, not just sauce. Tender enough for me with ribs, but boring flavor. Brisket tender enough, but very boring in flavor.  Back to \"hot Tots\". Describes them as hot links, but they were tator Tots with a little bit of sausage. Not described properly. Been there several times for breakfast and always great. The cornbread offered is.             awesome. Offer all the time. You should offer breakfast all the time because that seems to be the successful menu. Actually threw away almost half our meal after spending a lot of money  because nothing was worth saving. Everything was pretty boring. I did not originally give this place 3 star, but it was changed from 2to3 after posted"}
{"text":"We have been here several times and we like the food. The pricing is a little bit on the high end for what you get especially since you have to line up like cattle at the counter to order. This is especially annoying when the people in front of you have to discuss every item on the menu with the cashier.  The décor is fine for a casual place. Treat me like I am visiting a restaurant and take my order at the table and I will be there more often and hand my money over much more cheerful, otherwise charge me like a place where I order at the counter."}
{"text":"I love that so many BBQ options are popping up in this area and I'm on a mission to try them all. Overall, this spot is A-OK and I would return.  The restaurant is clean and open with about a dozen tables. A few of the tables are large enough for a group. There are a few picnic tables outside too. The location is easy to find on Eastern and there is plenty of parking in front of the building.  The menu here is one of the largest menus I've seen at a BBQ restaurant. They offer all of the meats you'd expect from a BBQ joint, around 20 side options, and other items like catfish. They definitely weren't lacking in options.   The service was a five during our visit. As soon as we arrived the woman at the register asked if we were first timers and gave us an overview of the menu. After we ordered at the counter she brought our food to the table and then took care of everything from there. We were offered drink refills and to go boxes when the time came. They definitely have service in order.  I'll start with the sides because these were my favorite foods. The Pickle Sticks were my favorite side. The sticks were thin, lightly breaded, and delicious. The sauce on the side wasn't even necessary. The 4 Cheese Crusted Corn Coblet was unique and delicious. The Deviled Egg Potato Salad had great flavor and texture. The Red Beans and Rice were good, but could have used more Cajun spice.   My husband had the Pulled BBQ Rib Sandwich. It was much larger than it looked in photos on Yelp! Overall, the sandwich was good, but the meat was not the most tender meat. My two meats were St. Louis Style Ribs and Chopped Brisket. The meats were okay, but neither were as tender or as seasoned as I expected.  For dessert we shared the Black Bottom Key Lime Pie jar dessert. Choosing a dessert was hard because they have so many great options. The key lime was tart and the chocolate crust was yummy.   I'll return because this BBQ spot has a lot of potential. I really enjoyed some of the food items and the service was great. Hopefully next time I'll find a meat that is a favorite!"}
{"text":"Just tried Bell's for the first time and I must say it was delicious.  Had the baby back ribs and brisket.  Both had great smoky flavor - not overpowering - and very tender.  Everyone was very friendly.  One of the best things I noticed was the cleanliness of the restaurant.  All the BBQ squeeze bottles on the table were very clean.  A lot of times you go into a BBQ place and the condiments are sticky and dirty from previous diners.  It appears they wipe everything down on the table after you leave - the way it should be done. It was a long drive since I live clear on the other side of town but worth the trip and I will be back."}
{"text":"First off, I've driven by this place for years. Found myself craving some bbq and decided to give it a try. I was more than pleased. The service here was awesome. Felt like family. Ordered the brisket with Mac n cheese and coleslaw with an order of fried chicken strips on the side. The brisket was so tender and cooked perfectly. And can we talk about the bbq sauce? Holy cow is that stuff good!! I got the house sauce, which comes with your meal and an extra side of the old fashioned bbq sauce. Can't wait to come back and try more of what this place has to offer. Great job guys!"}
{"text":"Both my fiancé and I had sandwiches there and was very disappointed. Maybe our expectations were too high but I didn't even finish my food (which if you know me its unheard of!)"}
{"text":"This was a very disappointing food experience. The food was bland, under seasoned, and lacked any real uniqueness. The macaroni was dry and tasted of cornstarch, the cheese grits didn't have enough liquid so it became a solid block with no flavor, the brisket was dry (hence the need for so much bbq sauce), the fried okra was too salty, and the St. Louis ribs were cooked in a flavorless rub. The best parts of the meal were the mashed yams, bbq sauce itself, Devyns pickles, pulled pork, and the fluffer nutter dessert. That's very unfortunate because I was excited for a new bbq atmosphere besides the food chain of famous Dave's, but I know I won't be back."}
{"text":"They have gluten free food! Gluten free chicken strips. Gluten free onion straws. Gluten free so many things."}
{"text":"I have to say that Bell's has the best beef and baby back ribs in Henderson! Their sides are truly delicious as well! I think the atmosphere it's fun and exciting the staff or truly professional and courteous. I like the idea of outside seating and the light fixtures dangling from above as you're walking in. Great price point as well!"}
{"text":"This place is a great local family run business,If in town try it.  The BBQ is good, I've been to Central Texas so I just can't say it's great!.  Their sides are on the other hand Great!  The brisket was moist and tender, no smoke ring and not the back you get from an offset smoker.  They have about 4 sauces they were really good. Glad I ate here and you will be happy you did too."}
{"text":"I used Grub Hub to place my order and it was ready when I arrived 25 minutes later. My dad and I planned on sharing a half rack of ribs, two sides and an additional side of Brisket. But once I got there, I realized we needed dessert. So I picked up one banana and one S'more pudding.   The Brisket was chopped and served dry - definitely better with sauce. I preferred the Ribs. They weren't quite as fall off the bone tender as I've found other places, but the rub gave it some decent flavor.   The sides we chose slaw and friesX5 (mixed selection of regular, curly and crinkle cut). The slaw is mayo based with a little sweetness, which was nice.   Between the two puddings I thought the S'mores was better because it was a lot more rich.   It was nice to try another BBQ place in Vegas with friendly service. But I can't say that I would seek this place out after having found a few other places in town that I prefer."}
{"text":"So we order from Bell's on a regular basis.  My husband can't get enough.  Favorite items St. Louis Ribs, pulled chicken and pulled pork.  Every side is unique and amazing.  I love the hot tots.  Now desserts in a jar? What? Wow just wow, the banana pudding is a must try.  To sum up we absolutely love Bells BBQ.  Did I mention they deliver.  It makes my life easier after a long day.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Finally a good bbq place close to my house! The ribs and sides were delicious and the way they presented food was great. Looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"This was really good food.  I think they do a nice job on the meats and the service is great.  Nothing to complain about at all.  GREAT!"}
{"text":"Bells came highly recommended by the Las Vegas Review Journal so I thought I would give it a try. The BBQ I had was very  good...but not great......At least they don't slop the sauce over everything. In the 20 years I have lived here....there is no \" killer\" BBQ in this town...period... The sides  I had ..were less impressive....red beans n rice...mac n cheese... Very good beer list....crappy wine list.... You order yourself...Servers bring you your food....They are young, inexperienced  but very energetic and helpful.  Zero atmosphere......  Noisy...In my mind this is strictly a take out place. I would not consider  going back unless I was ordering takeout...."}
{"text":"Not fancy but great Barbeque !! Service was also great!!! Got to support the family owned restaurant!"}
{"text":"Solid 4 for this place. Really wanted BBQ to take to the park and have a picnic with the kids after work on Memorial Day. Our first choice wasn't open (boo), so we decided to try Bell's. Not a bad choice.   Smelled insanely delicious inside. Smokey, earthy, sweet. But this place was packed!! I had the feeling they weren't prepared for the onslaught of people that had the same idea I did.   Their tiny dining room was jammed with hungry folks who were only getting hungrier from the intoxicating smells. But the peeps behind the counter were cool, calm, collected, and very professional. They apologized when food took long (which they advised guests of prior to ordering at the counter), and we're kind and patient. Hard to do when you're as weeded as they looked, but they pulled it off.   The food: again, a solid 4.  -My favorite was the pulled chicken. Tender. Not dry. Just enough chew. Smokey, although not really pulled as much as chunked. Atop Texas toast with seasoned salt. Yum.  -The smashed yams were fantastic.  -The St. Louis. ribs were good. A tad bit over cooked. Not very succulent and juicy like I like em, but great flavor.  -The chopped brisket was very peppery, again great smoke flavor, and not too fatty.  -Coleslaw was average. Not enough dressing in my opinion, but we ate it all.  -Crispy onion straws were good, but we're probably better fresh out of the fryer like most fried foods.  -The sauces were superb. Original. Spicy. BBQ ranch. Honey mustard. We are a saucey clan, and we liked them all.  -And the PICKLES!!! A+++!!!   Will return. Hopefully on a not as busy day, and will eat in. Can't wait to try the mason jar desserts."}
{"text":"I ordered food to go.  Usually it's not as good once it gets home.  This isn't the case with my Bell's!  I had the carved brisket side of potato and mac n cheese.  Thoroughly enjoyed it all.  The spicy bbq sauce is great.  The service was polite and executed my order perfectly.  Asking all the right questions to make sure nothing was missed. The place is sparkling clean, decorated nicely with comfortable clean couches to wait and have a cold beer while your order is being packed.  All in all I am completely satisfied.  One regret I didn't order a sweet jar.  Trust me, I won't make that mistake twice."}
{"text":"BBQ was just ok. Their sauces were just not my cup of tea. Give it a try. You might like it, I didn't."}
{"text":"Our favorite bbq place in Henderson by far! So many amazing main course options as well as sides. I love the pork belly! Sometimes the wait for food can be a bit long, but really can't complain when they are busy and can still provide great customer service and delicious food!"}
{"text":"Wow!!! Drove 30 min across town to try this place and let me tell you it was absolutely worth it!! Really wanted catfish so after a little digging I found this place so I decided to order for pick-up. When I arrived I wished I had just stayed there. It was a very welcoming atmosphere. But I couldn't wait to get home to try the food! It is delicious!!! Everything about it is absolutely amazing! The dipping sauce, the home made pickles, of course the catfish and even the sides!! Will for sure be returning for more!"}
{"text":"Got the brisket, mac'n'cheese, bbq beans and brussels sprouts. The brisket was really delicious, well done and not dry. The brussels were on point and very tasty, the other sides were okay. I would definetely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have been in here a few times. My last time Feb 19th, I got the sliced brisket. Five stars on that for sure! I read the review Sheryl S left......I think it is a fake review......never trust a Yelp review that has only two reviews and they are 5 years apart!..... I will continue to come to this BBQ place until they give me a reason not too.  The tater tot thingys were real good too as was the spicy BBQ sauce.......Keep it up Bell's!"}
{"text":"Now this is true southern cooking. The portions are overwhelming just at first sight. You really don't know if there is enough time to even eat this much tasty food. The chicken here is absolutely the best. It is right out of the   deep south. Fries Okra is a top notch side that is worth ordering by itself. If you are even close to Anthem, make a stop!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is fairly large, but surprisingly empty early on the Friday evening we visited though the waitstaff and cooks seemed busy.  We decided to share a full rack of ribs that included a choice of 2 sides with us choosing JB's coleslaw and smashed potatoes, but I added a third, Buffalo fried cauliflower.  The ribs arrived pre-sliced with a small quantity of BBQ sauce applied to each.  Had I known, I would have requested them served intact without sauce.  The ribs were hardly fall off the bone tender and the smoke/rub was only faint.  The sauce was not to our liking and we found the sides to be just okay so there is no compelling reason for us to return."}
{"text":"We had party pack with family and friends- ribs, chicken, pulled pork, brisket and amazing sides of Mac and cheese, the incredible  BEANS! and coleslaw. Everything was so delicious, servings were very ample, we will be back again and again!!!!!  So happy to have this great BBQ in Henderson!"}
{"text":"Recently ate at Bell's BBQ.  Was super excited to try it since it is in the neighborhood.  The people were friendly and helpful.  At dinner they had run out of brisket, and it wasn't very late.  The staff was friendly.  They recommended the corn as a side, and the young lady behind the desk said it was delicious.  It tasted like it had either been frozen or boiled in water so long it was mushy.  The chicken and the pulled pork were ok but nothing you would want to come back and have a second time.  To be fair though, my husband has a smoker in the backyard and smokes his own brisket, pork and chicken.  We thought we would try some so we wouldn't have to cook it ourselves, but Bell's won't be replacing home bbq."}
{"text":"Good neighborhood BBQ place, close to home. The pulled pork is good, but the sauce is what makes it. Nice sides (slaw and potatoes)  but not exceptional."}
{"text":"YUM!!!  Don't let this location deceive you.  This is some of the most delicious BBQ I've ever had. . .and you must try to cheesy corn."}
{"text":"Being a born and bred Midwestern boy and living 10 years in Missouri prior to Vegas, I count myself as at a minimum educated on good bbq.   We stopped in for dinner after a long day of housework and after I was regaining my appetite after an illness.   Let's say,  in the top 5 mom &  pop BBQ joints I've been to. Generous portions and great flavor.   Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Good portions for good price. the food is sub par nothing crazy amazing but still worth a try. what i really liked was the dessert, we had the banana pudding, wow really good! and i love that they put them in small glass mason jars."}
{"text":"Finger-licking-good.  This is my second time to Bell's Bbq. The first time we dined in, and the second was takeout.   I'm not a gnaw the meat off the bone type of girl, so I opted for the pulled chicken both time. Flaky, tender, and extra spicy with their choice of regular or hot bbq sauce. Aside from the meat, I am a major sides girl. They have so many to choose from and are always adding new ones. So far the cheese corn, baked beans (with pieces of brisket), deviled egg potato salad, garlic mash, and cheese grits have been my default favs. They offer two with your meat order, but you can add on as many as you want for a reasonable $1.75. Also, house made pickles and Texas toast (think Raising Canes) come with your meal.  This place is great for kids. Im all about not paying an arm and a leg for my two kids to eat out. I get them both a side order of the 3 cheese Mac and they are stuffed. Super cheap, super yum.   The restaurant itself is clean and cute.  Nothing over the top, but I kind of like that. A Mom and Pop kind of place. The staff is super helpful, and they are on top of coming over to fill your cup at the self serve drink station. A+ service.  Next time, I'm going for that banana pudding sweet jar."}
{"text":"Worst service - waited 20 mins for a to go order... Epic Fail - over priced - and mediocre quality at best... I'm sure Belles will be out of biz soon"}
{"text":"It was ok would come back if in area, ran out of Brisket...how does a BBQ place not know they are running short especially close to dinner time. Had the Catfish and St. Louis ribs definitely can tell its not BBQd on an open grill but an indoor one...if ever in Mason or Llano Texas go to Coopers BBQ for what BBQ should taste like, but in a pinch this is the place to go so far that we have tried here in the Vegas area."}
{"text":"We ordered here delivery, through the yelp app. it took over an hour to come with a 10$ extra fee. When they showed up,  he told me to just call my order in to them next time to save time and money.  The chicken fingers were AMAZING and husband loved the ribs, i thought my brisket was dry and chewey. But they sent lots of yummy sauces to dip everything in. You know i LOVE dipping sauces! Their ranch is super delish. I wouldn't compare this place to famous daves or memphis or anything,  but it's ok. The creme brulee was meh."}
{"text":"My family's go to spot for great BBQ. Friendly staff and great food. Get the brisket sandwich."}
{"text":"In the 25 years I've lived in southern Nevada, I have never found BBQ that reminded me of my favorite place in CA. I finally found great BBQ at Bells. Meaty, fall off the bone ribs. Can't wait to go back and try everything on the menu"}
{"text":"Great BBQ in Vegas. Been living here for a month tried a few other places that just wasn't good. This place is fantastic great size portions for the main course and the side items. Got a couple different type saices and I'll say all were delicious. Will definitely be making this a regular stop."}
{"text":"Amazing place!!!  My god the food is incredible.  I've never had bbq like this before.  My wife and I had 4 different meats (try the pork belly), 4 different sides, and 2 deserts.  Bells has an amazing atmosphere and the staff is beyond friendly.  With the great attitude of the staff and bbq to die for, check this place out.  A must for locals and even tourists who come in."}
{"text":"Delicious St. Louis ribs, perfectly prepared  Large portions, fairly priced. BBQ beans were very good and the Brussels Sprouts were excellent. Unfortunately didn't have room for dessert. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite bbq places to go to.  Top favorite meat would have the be their brisket which is awesome and they have a buffalo cauliflower side thats just amazing.  Very nice service and very quick!  Also love that they have a punch card for future discounts."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! The brisket tender, and with so much flavor. Restaurant is clean, and waitstaff professional.  Reminds of of a bbq spot in Austin texas."}
{"text":"I always order the brisket when I come here and 100% of the time it's always good. The house bbq sauce stands out really well and I always enjoy coming here. The service here is phenomenal, friendly workers who brought the food out very quick and also a really clean and good looking place. Can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal. Great customer service and the food was full of so much flavor. My only regret is not trying a sweet jar. I will eat here every time I'm in Nevada!!"}
{"text":"3 1/2 stars. Solid bbq. Had the chicken w beans and kale sides. All good. Found the bbq sauce to be decent. Meat well prepared and tender. I may be being more harsh since I just spent several days in Kansas City and had bbq 5 times at some of the best places in the country. If you love BBQ it's worth a try. You'll probably like it. Service was good too. Friendly staff. Like the interior too. Wanted to like the bbq sauce and beans more. Doesn't mean they weren't good. Perhaps I prefer KC bbq."}
{"text":"I wont go rushing back. It was just ok for me. We had the half chicken with the smashed yams and corn on the cob. The chicken wasn't at all what I thought it was going to be or taste like. For the price it should have been some of the best damn chicken I've ever had and sadly it didn't even come close. The sides were pretty good. The yams were my favorite I think. I got some fried green tomatoes. Those were pretty good. Got a side of deviled egg potato salad...ugh..disgusting. never again. And I love potato salad. We also ordered pulled pork and brisket. It was decent. It's all highly overpriced if u ask me. And you can't even get family meals all the food I got cost me almost 60 bucks. Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"First time in restaurant. Ordered pulled pork meal. Had fried buffalo cauliflower and mashed yams as sides. Everything was excellent and the staff was great."}
{"text":"Omg so good! We got a few different meats as we wanted to try everything and boy we were not disappointed. Pulled pork/chicken very good, ribs and pork belly also great. Brisket to die for, so tender and yummy. Great sides and even better deserts (s'mores was amazing). Clean restaurant and very friendly staff."}
{"text":"The BBQ scene in Henderson alone is doing quite well with so many places to try.  I came back here a second time to just make sure that the food was good and I would give it a solid 3.5 star.  1. Pork Baby Back Ribs - These are the very best and every rib we had was very tender and moist. Smoked and just right every time!  2. Sliced Brisket - I had asked several times if it was really moist and tender and they said yes.  It was tasty just not the most moist ever brisket.  If you douse it with enough sauce, in the end your won't notice.    3. Chicken - The bbq chicken was pretty good. They give you the thigh, wing and a quarter of chicken. It was overall good, however, I don't think you should ever give up the breast part as it is too dry overall.  4.  The sides - We had the red bean and rice, the southern greens and the fries. All were your standard fare, pretty decent overall.  5.  The service - Nice service, you order and then they bring to your table. They are friendly and helpful!  6.  They serve the food in a nice metal tray with Texas Toast on the bottom, the meat on top and the sides.  Price wise, I find it on the slight higher end, although I enjoyed it overall.  GK says that this is a pretty good place for barbecue and i will be back to try a few other choices."}
{"text":"This place is a go to for my family. St. Louis ribs are bomb. Fried shrimp plate is great.  Hot links have a little kick to them. All and all a solid place.   Most of the sides are awesome. Cornbread is some of the best I've had. Four cheese corn on the cob is fantastic. My wife loves the krunch salad. The Mac and cheese is also legit.   They have sweet jars for desert that will amaze you. It's a big mouth mason jar filled with goodness."}
{"text":"Went back today and was very disappointed. Was not that hunger as it was only 2 pm and I had just come from a business meeting near by. So I decided to go light with a sandwich and a side of my favorite okra that they make in house. Now let me describe the nearly meatless bread sandwich. Most people would call it Texas toast. Each side of this bread sandwich is about the thickness of 2 regular slices of white bread. So think of this as a standing on edge large piece of bread that has been cut in the middle to hold the meat. However the amount of meat that was placed inside was meager to say the least. Maybe I should call this a jam sandwich....2 pieces of bread jammed together. Bottom line...not worth the $9.95. Plus I don't understand why they had so many employees behind the counter as the place was almost empty. One thing is for sure I will not be returning or recommending this place."}
{"text":"Hit this place up for good eats,great food service fast with smile.great experience for first time for being in henderson"}
{"text":"Very small with limited seating inside and no waitstaff, this place is better for take out.  They are priced a little high for a place that serves your meal on tin foil.  The baby back ribs might be the most fatty babies I've ever had and I try every BBQ joint I come across.  The brisket and pulled pork are probably the best options on the menu.  The 2 BBQ sauces are pretty good.  While they do have some kids meals, they don't serve milk FYI.  Not likely going back"}
{"text":"I ordered the 6 Bone Baby Back Ribs with Smashed Garlicky potatoes and and bbq Beans. The Smashed Potatoes recipe really needs an overhaul. They look like they were made with water or nonfat milk. Add some cream, butter chives and maybe try some dang salt as they had NONE. The beans were just ok. The sauce they were in was too watery. The Ribs had a few small quirts of sauce which was OK because they have some on the table if you want it. I found the Texas Toast and Onions on top to be to much. Like they were trying to fancy up the fact that the food is super bland. The rub they use is off. I can't figure it out but there was some spice in it that was really off putting almost had a chimerical taste to it. The BBQ Sauce was like something you would get from a grocery store. As for the meat it seemed inferior. The ribs were a bit chewy and not even close to falling off the bone. Not very tasty at all. It doesn't surprise me that Bell's is in a strip mall because it really taste like something you would get in a food court. BLAND!   So next time I feel like spending over $20 for BBQ, it won't be Bell's."}
{"text":"We ordered a full rack of ribs,macaroni and cheese and smashed potatoes for dinner.  They were not the tender ribs that fall off the bone like I  was hoping for. On the contrary, the ribs were a bit on the tough side but the bbq sauce, which we got on the side had a bold flavor but nothing particularly special about it. The side dishes were very bland. The potatoes could have used more butter for richness and flavor.   The mac and cheese was dry.  Let's hope the dessert in a jar is more promising."}
{"text":"This is our second time going to Bells.  It was so good the first time we had to make sure we weren't just really hungry.  I am no BBQ connoisseur but I must say this place is really good!  Everything we had tons of flavor.  The second time we went we were actually on a \"whole30\" diet.  So we called ahead and asked if they could accommodate.  They prepare the half chicken with a rub and then smoke it.  They then flash fry it for a really crispy skin.  I know this sounds amazing but I could not have it this way because of the diet.  So they gladly put it the oven to finish it off!!  They went above and beyond to make sure our experience was awesome.  So many things to try next time when we are not dieting.  Make sure you try deserts!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ we have ever had. Been all over America. Food was so good wife n I felt like in a dream.  Try the sides of Brussel Sprouts and the side of Deviled Potato Salad. Wow!"}
{"text":"We had planned on going here since we accidentally drove past it one late night. It was great BBQ and one of the best we have had in recent memory. It is a simple place in a strip mall but nicely appointed and comfortable. They offer a number of entrée plates along with sandwich plates and more sides than we had ever seen in a BBQ restaurant before. I had the brisket plate with mac n cheese and their southern greens, the wife had the pulled pork sandwich (wow) with the Brussels sprouts. There was nothing left on either plate. Even then we had to try one of the sweet jars their signature dessert. We had the cheesecake which again was excellent. They let us try a new thing they will soon have on the menu, buffalo cauliflower...yum! The only caveat and it is minor, was they need to step up the flavor of the ranch dressing served with the buffalo cauliflower dish. Sort of bland. We left there stuffed and contented and plan to return again soon."}
{"text":"Finally had Bell's BBQ, probably on the most fitting day of the year and it seemed like the busiest. I celebrated my July 4th with some delicious BBQ and dessert. I really liked their brisket here. The baby back ribs were meaty and tender. My only complaint are the sides. I ordered the corn and it was served plain. I wanted to try the cheese corn like everyone else's photos. Maybe it was just a fluke that day. I didn't care for the cheese grits either. The red velvet sweet jar for dessert was the real treat.  The cream cheese was on point and the cake to cream ratio was great. I liked the crunch of he candied pecans.  Overall, a good BBQ spot for the area.  I hope to try some better sides next time.   *****Yelp 2016 100 Challenge***** 38/100"}
{"text":"Great customer service! Greeted with a smile and a welcome rather than someone just asking \"what do you want\"  the girls looked like they actually enjoy being at their job. I also loved the scenery of the restaurant and the cleanliness!!  I will definitely be back soon"}
{"text":"So this is a 2nd review of Bell's as they have redeemed themselves I had a great first dine in a so-so pick up and now most recently my 3rd Bell's experience I used Bite Squad delivery and this last one was stellar despite  using a delivery service I have never used before it arrived Hot and looking pristine portion size was good and every bite was savory and delicious! The Brisket was perfection and the mashed Yams my new fave! there not just for Thanksgiving anymore...the beans are also full of flavor and do not disappoint, lots of house made pickles thrown in the gift that keeps on giving I find that a meal at Bell's proves to be enough food for the next day as well! And finally the BBQ sauce is exceptional I am hard to please with sauce but they have nailed it with this one and they ever skimp on this either.  **Shout out to Bite Squad for stellar performance as well fast accurate and a friendly well mannered delivery driver thumbs up to you, we will be back."}
{"text":"We've eaten here around 6 times since they opened. At first they deserved a five star review. The service was great, place was clean with good music and staff super helpful, most of all they had excellent food. Everything we had was great, ribs, brisket, pulled pork, mac n cheese, sweet potatoes are amazing and the kids even like the food. Then over the course of our last few visits the food has gotten really inconsistent. Sometimes the ribs were dry or the pork portion was on the small side or something was too fatty. We've written them off considering the choices that are available in Vegas and how pricey it is. Sad because the location is perfect for us."}
{"text":"Decided to go here after picking up my daughter from high school. We were met with a warm welcome and the place is very clean. Ordered the St. Louis ribs, the chicken and my youngest had chicken fingers. The sides we ordered were deviled egg potato salad, greens, Mac n cheese and garlic smashed potatos. All ended up to be great choices. The food was wonderful and the service was equal. I'm happy to have BBQ place in the neighborhood that isn't a chain."}
{"text":"We were in the mood for BBQ & Bell's hit the spot and then some!! The baby back ribs were amazing but the star of the show was the pork belly!! I'm gonna be back real soon!!"}
{"text":"We ordered over the phone and when we picked up the food it was all there. Extra sauce and napkins. Way ahead of the game so far. We got home food was still warm as we live close. We opened all the boxes and the food looked great. St. Louis Ribs, Brisket, Mac & Cheese, Fries x5, coleslaw, Bbq Beans. All really good. The meat was moist and not dry at all.  Service was good and the food was good. Maybe next we'll eat there. Definitely a return visit!"}
{"text":"well the interior was clean and neat, not really a true bbq ambiance but this place claims to be chef inspired, and its close to Anthem so that may account for the fancy decore. I ordered a variety of meats and sides. the meats mostly tasted okay but were obviously reheated. I could not see a smoker but could smell the smoke. When I asked what type they used, the gal replied hesitantly, Apple I think. Smelled stronger than apple. The pork Belly was fresh and crispy, the sides were just okay although the fried cauliflower was good.The sauces were good. The Smores jarred dessert was cold - I guess I expected it to be hot but was tasty. The place was not busy at all- Two Tables in the middle of lunch hour..so? but in a great location."}
{"text":"Since I was born in Memphis and have eaten BBQ all over the country since I was a child, and make it myself, I think I know a little about this subject. I also have a restaurant management degree. First I found all the food to be just average. The pulled pork had good flavor but putting it on top of garlic bread spoiled it for me. The two don't gel well on top of each other. And I don't like garlic flavor in my BBQ. Plus I like my garlic bread separate. When I entered I took a seat and waited twenty minutes before the waitress told me I needed to order at the counter even though she looked and passed by me several times. When I ordered it took a while for someone to take my order. Then I was told the food would be delayed.? They were only about 2/3 full. But one look at the apparent chaos in the kitchen gave me a clue.! My food did come quicker than expected but overall my experience was about 2 1/2 stars.!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch here with a friend. We walked in and found the menu confusing and their was no full service with Menus handed to you. We finally ordered and sat down. As soon as the food came and it was quick too the restaurant redeemed it self the chefs are definitely focused on the BBQ and the rest of the foodie the menu, great meats and side are really special too. The owners weren't in yet and me being and exec Corp chef and pastry chef for 45 years  I would have loved to speak with the chefs. But now have an excuse to return Chef victor Parise Cec cce  my blog is yochef1.wordpress.com"}
{"text":"Randomly was in the mood for catfish, ribs & Mac n cheese. So I decided to order for delivery! omg...it was so good. Love the house BBQ sauce! I'm a sucker for Mac n cheese & I definitely fell in love, next time I'm ordering a pint for just myself. Hahahah.   I think this is probably the best catfish I've had so far! Well besides Mario's on MLK. I wasn't really a fan of the devils egg potato salad, it could use some more flavor! Over all, my food was so delicious & no complaints about the main entrees. I'll definitely eat here again and again."}
{"text":"Every time i come here its excellent services the food when it gets to my table is always fresh. The Staff always have smiles on, and the will accommodate for you on your order. Ive been here multiple times but have only took pictures on 2 visits there. 5 stars for this place. Take a visit there"}
{"text":"Had the half chicken and brisket.... best i have had in a long time.... sides just as good as the bbq and plenty to choose from very nice young men anf ladies eager to help how ever they can sweet tea by the gallon"}
{"text":"Today is the day of quick simple reviews. The food is great, and the prices are very reasonable. There are so many creative sides. If you are in the Henderson/Anthem area, come here for a meaty BBQ Delight"}
{"text":"Amazing barbecue place. The place itself is well-decorated, the employees are all nice, and the food is amazing. They have great barbecue sauces too. I recommend the pulled pork sandwich with a side of beans. Also, very close and convenient."}
{"text":"Great new BBQ spot close to home! Cozy atmosphere and good food! Tried the Brisket, Grits and red beans and rice.... And banana pudding for dessert! Pretty tasty! Will be back to try the shrimp and grits and fried catfish!"}
{"text":"Honey has been craving BBQ, I remember seeing that photo of the cheesy corn. I put them both together and we took a ride to Bells.  Small, casual, and welcoming. Staff was friendly and  helpful. Great selection of food, so much I wanted to try. It was lunchtime so we split a St Louis Rib Dinner with Cheesy Corn, Garlic Mash, and Mac and Cheese, then we added a side of Brisket \"just in case\". Prices seemed a bit high. We didn't wait long for the food to come out. Everything was good, unfortunately the ribs and brisket were not great. A little dry,  we don't think it was smoked. I've eaten a lot of ribs and these were average like the ribs you ate at Uncle Joes Birthday Party BBQ you attended last week. Mashed, Mac, and corn and Texas Toast were all good. We both agreed the Old Fashioned \"sweet\" BBQ sauce was our favorite of the sauce choices. Now on to the dessert...I'd give it 5 stars if I could. I'd go back just for that. We tried the S'mores Jar. So delicious, not too thick, not too chocolaty. Love the cocoa krispies on top. Marshmallow was perfectly torched. I had to restrain myself from licking the jar. I really want to try the other ones. As a matter of fact, I want one now. I wonder if I can get one to go!?"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! The customer service is out of this world!!! The food was exactly what this Kansas girl needed. I had the pulled pork and my 2 sides were cheesy grits and greens..... Amazing!!! They even have their own pickles that are made in house which have their own unique awesome flavor  I'm now indulging in their creme brulee in a cute little jar... Mmmm!!! I will defiantly be coming back soon!!!"}
{"text":"Of course we had another amazing meal at Bell's. The food really is the best barbecue in Vegas. The meats are great and the assortment of sides is vast and delicious, Also love the bacon cornbread waffles and the chicken and waffles are crave-able, the jarred desserts are an amazing way to finish the meal, you should always save some room! The service is also great, the gentlemen at the register is always so helpful and we have always had Twyla as our server, both are awesome and seem as if they genuinely enjoy being there and care what the diner thinks! Always have a great experience and everyone leaves full and happy. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"My nephew passed his driver's license test, do you need any other excuse to go get some barbecue? I met up with my family during my lunch break on a Wednesday afternoon and almost didn't make it back to work because I was ready for a nap. The sides weren't my favorite, but most importantly, the meats were delicious and everything was good enough overall to keep us coming back.  I ordered the brisket meal ($14.95) with the $3.95 pork belly add on and BBQ beans and okra \"fries\" for my side. There was a healthy portion of brisket that was a touch under seasoned as I had to go the BBQ sauce for an assist. The pork belly was excellent: crispy, fatty, and salty, another nice sized serving, well worth the extra dollars. I wasn't a big fan of either side, no problem with execution, I wasn't into the grittiness of the cornmeal on the okra and the sauce for the beans could have used a little more flavor. But no worries, they have plenty of selection for sides and I'll just get something different next time.  My wife and daughter split the baby backs ($24.95) with the 3 cheese mac and cole slaw. The leftovers were lunch for me the next day and they were quite tasty. Also ordered were a pulled chicken sandwich ($9.50) and pulled pork sandwich ($9.25) both with assorted fries. They were both finished, again no problems with the meat, except for the ends of the Texas toast. For the sandwiches, in the bread vs. meat battle, the bread wins in a landslide. I also noticed the french fries sogginess and that oil was soaking through the box container. The fries probably weren't made to order or just sold too soon and had been sitting around.  I would have loved to try a sweet jar, but I was just too full. A definite reason to come back though. A $72 lunch for a party of 5 may seem a little steep, but considering how much food we ate and how much we still took home, we got some bang for our buck. There were no issues with the service and everyone was friendly. The barbecue wasn't the best ever, but all in all we had a good first impression so we'll keep Bell's as a barbecue option for us."}
{"text":"After the different reviews we decided to just try it. We had the brisket Mac and cheese and coleslaw. Brisket was tender but definitely not as strong of a smokey flavor as you might expect. Coleslaw was meh. Kind of watery and not super flavorful. Mac and cheese was tasty. Really gooey. There are three sauces. I think there could have been more difference between them but all in all they were good. Although not the best BBQ I have ever had. It's nice to finally have another BBQ option in Henderson other than Lucille's."}
{"text":"After 2 years, we decided to give this local place another try.  First of all, service was terrific and friendly.  Food is better but I stand behind my original comment that the food is oversalted.  My son wouldn't eat more than a few bites of his chicken fingers so we brought it home.  I was going to eat the leftovers for lunch but couldn't get past the salt lick.  Too bad, as the tenders looked very appetizing.  The brussel sprouts could have been addictive if not for a bit too much salt - and I love salt!  Brisket was  very tasty and tender, fried okra perfect, fried green tomatoes terrific.  My husband had to have an extra order of the buffalo cauliflower because he loved it so much.  Portions are very generous.  St. Louis ribs were ok.  Cute idea with french fries to have several different types in one order - regular, waffle, curly, crinkle cut.  Nice local place but lay off the salt please!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and service. Many great menu choices. Have a gluten-free menu! Liked the lights inside- good atmosphere. We'll be back again."}
{"text":"I'm a big supporter of small, locally, family owned businesses and this place fits all my needs. Very yummy food and a kids menu available. Lots of side dish options. It took awhile to get our food but were told with apologies that they just had a large take out order that backed them up. Food is 5 stars. Price is a bit high to be able to go often and feed a family of 4. It was also pretty smoky inside which made it a bit uncomfortable. But the food was super good."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS. I had the St. Louis Ribs, tried the pork belly, and I have to say the BEST thing I had was the order of Crispy Brussel Sprouts. They were delectable and I crave them once a day now. Aunt Linda's Red Velvet was freaking amazing. Overall, very delicious. The ribs and brussel sprouts were the highlight for me."}
{"text":"We enjoy the food here. My son is a vegetarian and loves the sides. The baked beans are the best. We have it delivered and watch the games."}
{"text":"Finally a real BBQ restaurant on my side of town. Delicious brisket was tender and lean. My wife enjoyed her St Louis ribs, too. Sides were creative and tasty, as were the sauces. Service was super fast and the staff stopped by often. The decor is still a bit on the \"strip mall bbq\" side, but I expect it will evolve over time. Nicely done, Bell's!"}
{"text":"This was our second time here and again not a disappointment overall. We had the Smoked Pork Belly and it just melted in our mouths! So ono!! The sides were amazing! Had the Roasted Brussel Sprouts,  Fried Pickles and Okra and the 4-Cheese Crusted Corn. Our terrific server was Tommy and he really made our experience there memorable. He really knows his menu and all of his recommendations were spot on! Mahalo Tommy! We will definitely be going back. Oh, and leave room for dessert, had the Banana Pudding Sweet Jar...yeah, it has bananas in it. Banana Jam layered with Banana Pudding topped with Brûlée Banana Slices, whipped cream and Vanilla Wafer Crumbles. Fantastic!"}
{"text":"My boss took us here for lunch on a whim, as we had a meeting to get to so we had to choose something in the area. It was between Bell's and a Pho restaurant. Let me say this... We both wish we had went to the pho restaurant. The service was okay, the cashier was REALLY pushy about their creamed kale, I guess it was a limited time item. The prices were way too high for the quality of food. I ordered the brisket, yams, and cheese grits. My boss had the pork belly, cheese grits, and Brussels sprouts. The food looked good enough, but digging in was not as pleasurable as we wanted it to be. My brisket was dry and cold, and smothered in their sauce. If they really do smoke their meat, you could never tell because of the sauce drowning. The yams tastes disgusting, like they were made with tap water from the wash sink, and they were also cold. The cheese grits were alright but didn't rock my universe. There are much better places to eat in the area, and we won't ever be going there again."}
{"text":"Awesome Food, great service. Was not disappointed. Their hot BBQ sauce is excellent.  Make sure to save room for dessert!"}
{"text":"Today was our first time to eat here. Won't be our last; it was great! Nice and varied menu, excellent food, very good people. The sandwiches are genius...stay together and delicious in both the bbq filling and the toasted Texas toast. Really good place."}
{"text":"Great BBQ place in Henderson.  Well worth the drive if you are in Vegas.  The pulled pork and fried Brussels sprouts are outstanding!  Great service and amazing food!!"}
{"text":"Found this awesome place as I was driving around the area one day, and decided to take my coworkers with me to try it out during lunch. Probably as close as you can get to good southern food. Pulled Chicken is great, and the corn and Brussels sprouts were amazing... Price is reasonable and parking is easy.. The cashier was very knowledgeable and very friendly.. They did take a while to cook the food though, so maybe calling in an order or expect to wait a little. Definitely coming back !"}
{"text":"Good food & great staff. My favorite is the pork belly with the fried onions, okra and Brussels sprouts"}
{"text":"Best BBQ I have had since Kansas and Texas. OMG So good you have to try for your self the best in Vegas hands down sorry Rollen Smoke ."}
{"text":"I went here today for the first time. Got a full rack of baby back ribs, brisket and a creme brulee jar dessert. The ribs in my opinion looked and tasted a few days old. Just re-heated is what I feel was done. Over prepared. Brisket was good. Sides were good. I do not recommend the ribs. I felt I lost my money on the ribs. I lived in Texas and Memphis so I feel I have some say in bbq."}
{"text":"Easily our favorite bbq place in Vegas. Everything we've tried has been amazing. Don't think there is one bad thing on the menu. Brussels sprouts are one of my faves while the husband picks the tots. BBQ sauce is flavorful and compliments any meat. Love that the desserts are served in little jars. The s'mores is our personal fave!"}
{"text":"I am in love with this place. Balil helped us and suggested the pulled chicken... IT WAS DELICIOUS!!! THANK YOU GUYS. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. I don't like much BBQ, because I can't stand when everything is covered in sauce (to where you cannot taste the flavor of the food underneath), so I was pleasantly surprised when I came to Bell's!  The atmosphere is definitely one of Southern hospitality - they will help you with just about anything you need, at any time. The staff are welcoming, knowledgeable, and polite.  The food here is spot-on. I have had (and recommend): BBQ Brisket (Cooked perfectly! No rubber here!) Shrimp Po'Boy (The shrimp are HUGE and are battered perfectly - and not greasy!) Shrimp Dinner (See comments about the shrimp - seriously - just get them!)  Sides: Yams! (Super delicious and creamy!) 4 cheese corn (don't fight it - just try one!) Okra fries (I HATE okra, so this should tell you something) Macaroni and Cheese Brussels Sprouts  It says something about an establishment when NO ONE speaks during dinner. The several times I have gone, the dining room was full, and everyone was QUIET.  I recommend this place to anyone who thinks of themselves as a BBQ connoisseur. I know I will be back!"}
{"text":"Be warned...this place is addicting! Everything I tried was delicious and cooked to perfection"}
{"text":"Quick and friendly service. Come and try their yummy bbq rib sandwich, it will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Just had the Baby-Back Ribs with salad and a corn coblet! Excellent!!  My favorite BBQ Restaurant in the valley."}
{"text":"The food at Bell's barbecue is always mouth watering good. I took my friend here for breakfast. She loved the chicken and waffles. It was the seasoning of the chicken  that makes it so tasty. My husband's favorite is the pulled pork sandwiches.  I love their biscuits and gravy. True southern style. This place is great for dine in or take out."}
{"text":"This is a cute little place and the service was awesome. The food was great. My favorite was the pumpkin tres leeches dessert. The fries are cool they are all mixed together with a variety. I will come back."}
{"text":"We ordered this for deliver through ubereats last week. Delicious! We had the beef ribs and brisket with a couple of different sides. That sweet potato mash was hands down one of the best things I ever tasted! Cant wait to dine in."}
{"text":"I'm rounding up, more like 3.5 stars because prices are a bit high. We rolled in around 1130am for lunch, and after perusing the menu for a bit we were notified that the brisket and 1/2 chickens were not ready. They don't offer a 3 meat sampler plate, but you can order a base plate and then 4 oz add ons on the side. So this concept is a bit different from other BBQ places.   I ordered the daily special, a BBQ rib sandwich, a side St. Louis Rib, and the BBQ beans as my side. My friend went with the catfish sandwich, which he enjoyed. They have regular BBQ sauce and a spicy one, which I didn't try. The regular sauce was sweet and tangy but not overpowering. My BBQ rib sandwich was delicious, topped with coleslaw on texas toast, and I managed to get 1/2 way thru before filling up. The BBQ beans are not for me, with the onion and pepper combined with brisket.   Where I felt it wasn't a great deal was the 1 St. Louis Rib add on for $2.95. This rib was not full of meat, but a bit thin so I felt like a bit overpriced. The flavor was good, the meat tender, but not really smoky....and I didn't see a smoke ring. I don't know where they keep their smoker. Next time I'll drive around back to see if its there.  Overall, good food at an ok price point for the area. Service was great, very friendly. The brother/sister team came through and talked to us as well as our server. I will be back to try that brisket!"}
{"text":"We just attended a catered dinner with Belle's BBQ food. Their servers were awesome and the food was great! We will visit their restaurant soon. It was Uncle Jerry's fave and he is never wrong!"}
{"text":"First timers looking for some yummy southern grub. There are some definite must haves: cheesy grits  fried brussel sprouts ( BEST THING ON THE MENU)  mixed fries    This is the very first time I've eaten southern food in Vegas and not been disappointed. Being a true southerner I totally understand I am a steep judge, however I must say this was tasty! You order up front and they sit and bring everything to you. The staff was super nice and the beer and tea cold. The meats were good but it seemed like all the food was missing salt ( and BLACK PEPPER- a southern staple!) The deviled egg potato salad and rice and beans were very disappointing. The rice and beans was more like decried beans with some rice on top- not the southern rice and beans that is spicy with sausage bits I'm used to. The deviled egg potato salad was super mushy and potatoes over cooked- also there was red pepper? Inside and no gherkins. We will definitely be back to try the chicken and waffles! Keep up the awesome work!!"}
{"text":"Decided to  try bells BBQ tonight  for the first time  and I have to  say  the last. The meat  was dry and the sides  were cold. They were out of  items  and in my opinion  is way over  priced"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Literally everything is better than good. The brisket is so tender you don't even need teeth to eat it. We just happen to stumble across this place, sooooo glad we did we have a new favorite spot."}
{"text":"Late post. I came here last month when my mother in law came into town. She's from NC and I am from AL. So we bother have different views on BBQ. Well this place was a hit with us. First when we walked in, I felt like I was back in the South with the hospitality from the staff. We explained we just moved here and this was our first time in. They explained the menu and told us how they make the meats. The sandwiches were very delicious! A++ will return soon."}
{"text":"Great barbque in Henderson!!!  Tasty and tender brisket. Sides are awesome, family business.  Definitely will return to try other options.  Delish!!!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. Would have just given 4 stars based just on food, but I'm giving 5 because of the service. I ordered baby back ribs and they came out cold. I had ordered to go so maybe they were expecting me to go home and heat it up later. However, I went to place next door to sit down and eat with the rest of my friends (I didn't feel like eating pho at the time). So when I took it back, they were nice about it and made me a fresh new batch. They even let me keep the old one to eat for later since they were going to just throw it away. Most places would have just taken it back and just tossed it in the trash."}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ!! I got the pulled chicken sandwich with a side of 3 cheese Mac and cheese. Amazing juicy chicken, honestly the best I've ever had! Only wish I have is if I could have more pickles! Their homemade pickles are so good!! All in all a great experience and I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best barbecue in Las Vegas!  The baby back ribs are amazing - the BBQ sauce is the best.  The okra fries shouldn't be missed - great baked beans.  The mac and cheese was a miss for us, but everything else was wonderful.  Great job Bell's BBQ!"}
{"text":"Honestly, i prefer sweet bbq. I am by no means saying the food is bad. It's good but my experience woukd be better if the sauce was sweeter.  I think its pretty expensive too. I got pulled brisket with two sides, a drink and a dessert and it was almost 25 dollars.   I would probably come back but there are other options that are cheaper and has the type of sauce i like."}
{"text":"The thing we look for the most is customer service and this place has it! Then it was on to how is the BBQ. Everyone says they have great! BBQ.... Well this place has that too! It's exciting to have a great family owned establishment down the street with great food. Congrats to the owners and to the Employees for doing a great job. Let's keep great businesses like this flowing in our Area.."}
{"text":"I have been going are since they opened. If this place was located in a different area, it would be one of the most popular BBQ places in Las Vegas. I currently live 30 mins away from this place now, but should be going back in the next couple of days. Most BBQ places have good meats and others good sides. This place have great meats, sides, and the deserts are off the hook.   The one tip I will give you is if you are ordering your food to go, call and order it. They will take a long time to get it to you if you order when you get there."}
{"text":"I went there last weekend with my family. My wife and kids got a half chicken with sweet mash potato. I got pulled chicken with fries. We got our food in a timely manner. The staff was great and polite.  We had to try their desert I got the banana pudding and my wife and kids got the s'mores.  It was great experience for my entire family.  I would recommend it to people."}
{"text":"Great food and great service I just left taking my husband out for dinner with my kids all of us ate very well and were full with left overs. My husband loves ribs and he gives it 5 stars with 2 thumbs up they even put the football game on for us. I plan events and I would refer anyone of my clients to use their service."}
{"text":"Cozy place with a good vibe and great service!  Flew in from LA to see my hair stylist (whose space is around the building) and had some time to kill for lunch.  The pulled pork sandwich is to die for.  Although the Texas Toast \"bun\" is a bit much, the amount and quality of the pork was amazing.  Love that they have multiple BBQ sauces (I prefer the spicy, vinegar-based one), and awesome mac & cheese.  Oh, and homemade pickles!  Pretty sure I will make time to stop in every time I come in for a haircut."}
{"text":"Wow! What a great place. The brisket was amazing and the spicy BBQ sauce was really great. But what really stood out was all of their very unique sides! The buffalo cauliflower bites where just to die for. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Got to try their pork belly crispy outside melt in your mouth like marshmallows inside they are the best. St. Louis ribs were cooked perfect the meat is juicy and easy off the bones. Side dish were good we got the best yams and crispy cheese corn on the cob it was unique and tasty"}
{"text":"I finally made it to Bells for lunch, I wish I hadn't waited so long!  I had the brisket sandwich with red beans and rice as my side order.  The presentation was great, 2 pieces of Texas toast still attached at the bottom & open at the top like a pita.  The meat was loaded at the top and the sandwich stood on the connected bottom open end up.  I choice the house sauce and liked it so much that I added it to each bite of the sandwich.  The red beans and rice side was very tasty but a bit on the dry side for my taste but still very good. The staff is very friendly and I'm looking forward to trying more items on their menu, I recommend you try this family operated restaurant."}
{"text":"With so many mixed reviews I was waiting for the kinks to get worked out before trying out Bell's. Unfortunately the food was a big let down. First off, it was over $16 for the brisket meal which came with two sides and one piece of texas toast. Just way over priced for one person. I really wanted to try the banana pudding in the jar but that would have brought it over $20 just for a bbq plate.   The brisket was served on the toast which I didn't get. If I wanted it on bread I would have ordered a sandwich. The first few pieces of brisket were extremely dry and tough which made it hard to chew. The 3 cheese mac n cheese lacked any \"3 cheese\" flavor, it was just a bland sauce. I did like the BBQ beans however, great flavor with pieces of brisket.   I also liked how it was decorated inside, but if the food dissappoints, Im forced to give 2 stars as I have had much better BBQ. I am definately willing to give Bell's another try as I really want to try the banana pudding jar. Maybe I will order the pulled pork or ribs next time and have a better experience."}
{"text":"Great bbq service impeccable right from the start and the deserts a must great selection of sides and fair priced"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time a few days ago it is close to my house and was recommended by a friend that it is very good here.  Parking is plentiful here and as far as upon arrival it looks like a clean place. It is small, cozy & bright.  The people that work here are friendly and helpful. They do come by and check up on you and make sure that everything is good. So I ordered a brisket plate with a corn coblet, collard greens and an ice tea.  The iced tea taste good and seem to be freshly brewed. Corn cob tasted okay but lacked a little bit of flavor. The collard greens has bacon pieces inside and taste a little bit salty but was okay. They put the brisket on top of a thick cut of toast and topped it with some fried onions. The toast was thick and crusty , the brisket was moist and tasted pretty good, and the fried onions was a nice touch on top. The two barbecue sauce  bottles is on the table one is spicy and one is not which tasted yummy when dipped with the brisket. I will most likely come back again and try their other dishes!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, amazing BBQ smell as you open the door.  The slow roasted brisket will challange any BBQ from Texas.  It's that tender and great smoke flavor   Well worth the trip to eat here"}
