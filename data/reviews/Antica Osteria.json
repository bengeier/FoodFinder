{"text":"Dined here last night for the first time. Was absolutely delicious. Husband had a bone in rib-eye cooked to perfection (Med Rare)  Pasta in the cheese wheel looked amazing. The only issue I had was the price of the water. $6.00 per bottle. Had I known the water coming to the table was going to cost, I would have opted for tap.  other than that, fantastic!"}
{"text":"I always get great service here and excellent seafood & pasta. It is a known quantity and I always enjoy it. Although some menu change up would be nice."}
{"text":"Prices are way overpriced compared to other Italian restaurants in the area. The food quality isn't the greatest either. we ordered a pasta and did not enjoy it at all, it had absolutely no flavour whatsoever. we won't be back here!"}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant this week for friends anniversary. Always hopefully that every new place we try in Brampton will be somewhere worth frequenting as the options are limited.   Fairly busy for a Tuesday night. Service was excellent, server knew the menu and specials and was able to comment on and make recommendations.   Appetizers arrived quickly and were well received by all eight people in our party. Italian sausage option I had was excellent.   Entrees also arrived in a reasonable amount of time. Arrived hot and as ordered, all together. Grouper special with side of pasta was great and a good sized portion. Spouses pasta was only average. Most guests in our party very much enjoyed their meals. Typical Italian restaurant style desserts which were all very good.   Bill for two with four drinks was $120 + tip. Decent value for the overall quality and service.   Will definitely return and probably soon."}
{"text":"Great place to take your family!  Staff is very accommodating and provided high chairs for my two young kids (2 yrs & 1 yr)  I have been going here for the past 2 years and every experience gets better and better!"}
{"text":"Very nice experience. The ambiance of the restaurant is a nice touch of Italy, along with the friendliness of the staff. The stuffed tortellini in cream sauce with truffle oil was to die for. So rich and full of flavour. Surprisingly this was only a special of the, but it would definitely be able to survive on the main menu.  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"We went for dinner to this restaurant....The appetizers were better than the main course the wine was great . ....it was a nice cosy place but  found it to be a lttle expensive. The creme brulee was the highlight of the evening.....will go back for  dessert for sure"}
{"text":"An amazing dinner with amazing service!    We started with a wonderful bottle of wine, a couple apps from the specials board and fresh bread with a vegetable cream cheese that was complimentary. The meatballs were light, tender and juicy but it was the sauce that had us swooning!  Our entrees were the Linguine con frutti di mare, which was full of seafood cooked to perfection and the homemade lasagna, which was a daily special.  My only complaint is that I got full! The servings were generous!   We indulged in dessert, something we rarely do because so many places have the exact same brownie with ice cream or cheesecake but the Vanilla Panna Cotta with amareno cherries sounded different. It was.  I came home and immediately started looking up those cherries!    Even the coffee was excellent!"}
{"text":"came here for girls night out with 3 of my girls and their son.  We all showed up slightly late due to the snow but within 15 mins of our reservations. what i didnt like was the attitude we got from the host when only 2/4 were there right on time; but we still requested to be seated so we were not waiting by the door.  I had the penne a la vodka and asked to have chicken and mushrooms added to the dish and while i can appreciate that not everything is customization the server actually said 'that is an insult to the chef' so i asked if any pasta on the menu had both chicken and mushroom and she said no, to which then proceed to say \"looks like we have no choice but to make an exception for you.  Now either myself or my friends were drinking this night, we had requested for the wine glasses to be removed from the table - to which - we continuously got asked if we had changed our mind and wanted some wine.. it almost made me feel like they were on commission to sell the wine!  location - is a little out of the way, so definitely not place i would recommend or go too again."}
{"text":"I know people who consider this to be the most authentic southern Italian restaurant in Brampton. I can only describe it as delicious. The appetizers are terrific and I can never make up my mind as there are so many entree choices.  Have not had a bad meal here yet!"}
{"text":"Went there with a few family Members on a recommendation from a friend. Was not disappointed at all. The place is in a strip mall so I had my doubts. It is a small place, but that is not always a bad thing. Sometimes it is good to have a small quiet place to have dinner. The food was exceptional, and the portions were just right. Not small and overpriced like a lot of places. I had the Muscles for my appetizer. So good! For my main I had their pasta mixed in the parmigiano cheese wheel. All kinds of good! Would highly recommend it to people visiting for the first time. I will be making this restaurant a regular in my places to eat out from now on"}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to eat. The service is superior, and the food is incredible. We enjoy the specials. Tip try the Grand Padano Cheese wheel rigatoni with the big meat balls. Followed by a ripasso... heaven!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner there on Saturday night. We shared a calamari fritti as an app. The calamari Was cooked to perfection, which isn't always easy, but I found the coating a bit thin and soggy. As a main I had the gnocchi in Gorgonzola sauce. Fantastic and rib sticking. I won't have to eat till at least Tuesday. With the small rooms and hard surfaces it can get a bit loud if conversations at other tables get a bit boisterous. We will certainly keep this place on the short list for date night."}
{"text":"Antica is quite the popular place to dine if you enjoy Italian food and live in Brampton or Caledon.  Antica is 5 minutes away from my home literally and i pass it a minimum of 2 times per day and yest all this time I never ate here.  Finally had a chance to try it.  It was a Saturday night and the restaurant was very busy as it should be on a weekend.  Our table was ready for us upon arrival the staff seemed very nice. The service was very slow as it seemed they were short staffed but we were not in a rush and were excited to try the food.  The apps were super tasty and brought to us fairly quickly.  I ordered the seafood pasta and I have to say the pasta to seafood ratio was insane.  There was way more seafood then pasta. That's rare in any restaurant.  At first I thought that I would still be hungry seeing as it didn't look like there was a lot of pasta.  Upon completing my dish i realized I was wrong.  I was super full.  Seafood and pasta were cooked perfect and the sauce was very tasty had me cleaning the plate with my bread of course lol.  The prices were a little higher than average but the quality of the food makes up for the price difference.  Next time I want Italian food and want to dine locally Antica Osteria will be my first choice."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this restaurant a few times and the food is always amazing and authentic.  Very good place and worth checking out!  Customer service is always good with attentive staff.  Beautiful cosy setting for a special occasion or date night."}
{"text":"We were regulars here for a short time a while back and would entertain friends there. My usual was the seafood pasta and as I find tends to happen now and again, I had a plate with seafood that could have been cleaned better as there was grit. That turned me off enough to back off on my visits and I haven't been back. But prior to that I really enjoyed the restaurant and may make it a point to return."}
{"text":"Such a great restaurant, food is always super fresh. As an italian, I usually do not prefer going out for Italian food, but I can always count on Antica Osteria for an authentic (and delicious) meal!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and it was good both times. The portion is decent. The food is pretty authentic. Service is good, our server was very friendly. The restaurant wasn't too busy when we got there (a Sunday evening). We've notice a patio outside which will be great on warmer days. We shared a beef carpaccio as an appetizer which was just ok. They served it with spinach instead of arugula on top, which was not as good. My husband had the seafood linguine, which was delicious. I had the simple spaghetti with basil tomato sauce and it was quite good as well. After we finish our meal, the server offered us some dessert and told us that the Tiramisu was on him. So we ordered one, but they somehow still charged us for it. It was too awkward to ask about it so we paid for it anyway, since we initially wanted to order one regardless. If it was a mistake, it's fine, but if it was done on purpose, that's a pretty lame way to force your customer into getting a dessert. My husband also tried a few of their Italian beer which he enjoyed as usual. Will come back again."}
{"text":"STOOD IN LINE FOR 30 min past my reservation...Spoken too rudely by the owner when checking in for my reservation...was chuckled at and said yeah So is everyone else....we were out for our 5th year wedding anniversary....Great way to celebrate...we're now at Taco Bell...we waited 1 min for service (Fitting were atTaco Bell since it's Cinco De Mayo) We were also there to scout the place for our daughters christening after party....I CAN ASSURE I WILL NEVER COME BACK...POOR MANAGEMENT...I don't mind waiting a couple minutes after a reservation but 30 minutes and no table in sight...TERRIBLE...Food may or may not be good but service like that doesn't encourage me to come back to try....ITS TOO BAD.....HAPPY ANNIVERSARY HONEY"}
{"text":"Nice calamari to start, glass of Pinot Grigio and hubby had a glass of Talisker, service was professional: the ladies tended to our water needs and fresh bread was offered in a basket. Main courses: I had the veal Milanese, hubby had the gnocchi, wine was a lovely primitivo, and the ambiance was nice, except for a loud bunch of louts behind us. Too bad some people lack good manners and decorum. They were people in their 50's! And so are we! I had a snifter of cognac to finish and hubby had a latte."}
{"text":"Staff is very pleasant and accommodating.  The food was average. Nothing really stood out."}
{"text":"First visit to this restaurant last weekend.  Food was delicious and service was amazing.  All staff were very welcoming and attentive.  We ordered the sautéed calamari, mussels, pickerel fillet and wagyu beef...everything was excellent!  Also ordered the chocolate cake and tiramisu for dessert and was not disappointed.  Will be visiting again very soon.  Thank you for an exceptional evening."}
{"text":"Great meal today... Brushetta, Mussels, Seafood Luinguine, and half penne a la vodka and Shrimp pasta.  My husband was very impressed.  Portions were Great, service was spot on. There is a wait for the food... but with great food cooked fresh on order... enjoy your company and food will arrive when it is ready."}
{"text":"Our second time to this fine Italian restaurant and wow we thought we were in Rome.  The food was very authentic and very filling.  It was melt your mouth.  So nice to see the owner Domenic come over and talk with us.  Worth the drive from Milton"}
{"text":"Me and my fiance are regulars at Antica Osteria. We discovered it a couple of years ago and its become our go to place in Brampton. It is a little pricey, but the food quality is top notch.   Whenever we go we always order the beef carpaccio and the Arugala salad. The honey glazed pear slices are simply a delight. In terms of our mains, the pasta in a cheese wheel is a very cool experience. I am also a big fan of the mushroom risotto with a side of grilled chicken.  Unlike the other reviewers, I have always had great service. However do not expect things to be out immediately. This is not a fast food joint and good food does take time to prepare. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"A Hidden Gem In Brampton - a city of franchise restaurants, the Antic Osteria is pleasant retreat.  Food was really good. The decor and atmosphere was elegant yet casual. The service was friendly.  Perfect place for a date night. Highly recommended"}
