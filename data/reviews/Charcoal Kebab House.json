{"text":"It doesn't get more down to earth and fulfilling than this. If you love Uyghur, or otherwise Xinjiang food, this beats any place in Toronto, most places in Beijing as well. 
Yes the service is inconsistent, they've an amazing waitress on some days, and sometimes maybe another who deserve zero tips and a serious complaint, but all that aside, the food is what keeps people coming. 
This establishment keeps me (a over-indulgent foodie with no dietary restrictions) lusting over the label \"halal\". Indulge in lamb, and indulge in spices, their portions are large, the quality have always been exceptional at least for the 6+ times I've been there. So man up, eat halal"}
{"text":"The Charcoal Kebab House is located just East of Scarborough General Hospital and McCowan Road, tucked away in a tiny non descript plaza on the North side of the street, but it's worth a visit.  The noodles are very special made by the owners who are Uyghurs and where noodles were a staple long before the Italians made it their own.  Uyghurs come from an Autonomous Region of China that borders, India, East Turkistan, Mongolia and Tibet.   http://uyghuramerican.org/about-uyghurs.  The cooking is more Persian but different and unique in Toronto.  This restaurant would be a good fit in any of the cultural hot spots of Toronto such as Korea town, or Queen St. W, in Parkdale.
Their food is home cooking in the Uyghurs tradition with an emphasis on lamb and charcoal cooking.  The best dishes are the ones with the hand made fresh noodles made by Buhachan who is the co owner along with her husband Avi.   The flavours are a mixture of Middle Eastern with Asian influences.  We highly recommend the Uygher Somen and the Langman,  lots of noodles and cumin and hot peppers,  along with an abundance of fresh vegetables. .. The aromas are intoxicating when your plate arrives!

Look past the red roses on the table and ask the owners Avi or Buhachan (also known as Brigitte) what they recommend to eat.  They are expecting a liquor license shortly.
If you love lamb, this is the place, and if lamb is not your meat of preference, order chicken.   Other than charcoal shrimp which was overcooked  we recommend any dish with thehand made  noodles."}
{"text":"We were really disappointed for the food here, we tried 4 dishes none of them made me wanna come again. the lamb kabab was chewy and dry, so were the kidneys. the lamb noodle soup was okay but the noodle tasted just like packaged noodle that bought from store. the other handmade noodle had uneven thickness and some thicker pieces were still raw in the center...plus i had to use saltshake for everything!! normally i am the one complian the food was too salty, but today i found everything was tasteless... plus we waited 10minutes for water, 40 minutes for the first noodle soup...certainly not worth it"}
{"text":"I stopped by this place tonight for some take-out. I ordered the lamb dumplings and the Yangman noodles with green & red peppers, chillies, lamb, and onions.

The noodles tasted good, although misshapen. I really enjoyed them and they were spicy. I loved the green and red peppers: they were cooked really well and tender but still a little crunchy.

I didn't really like the lamb dumplings. As I do with any foods encased in another food (ie. lamb encased in dough) I cut one open and looked inside before eating. Lamb and onions were inside, but many of the lamb pieces were lamb fat as opposed to lamb meat. Lamb is a fatty meat but the fat pieces, relative to actual meat, seemed high. I'd estimate it was over 50% fat, and so it wasn't worth the $12/half-dozen dumpling price. I considered ordering the chicken or lamb skewer, and regret not doing that as I would have received more meat and paid less.

Overall the meal was okay, just less fat in the dumplings please. I think this small restaurant is growing and improving and they add a new style of food to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I was totally surprised when I first came to this place. A very different kind of Chinese Halal food. The environment was great, unique interior as well. 
We tried their famous hand-made noodle, the dumpling, chicken & lamb skewers and lamb soup. The noodles' texture are tender (that's exactly what it supposed to be), I like it, but the whole dish was way too heavily tomato-ed, too much like an Italian dish. 
The dumpling was delicious with lamb and onion fillings. The skin was soft and at the same time strong enough to hold everything without breaking apart when you pick up the dumpling. 
The lamb soup was really good with clear broth and lamb meat. Tasty not too salty. We like the chicken skewer more than the lamb skewer (even though I love lamb personally). 
It is a nice restaurant as a whole and the waitress was very nice. Great service. Large portion with the price tag they are asking for. Will come back for sure."}
{"text":"Food is great, but don't bother to make reservation. Made a reservation at 7, showed up 6:50 and they gave the table to walkin who showed up earlier. Bad service"}
{"text":"I rarely give out 5 stars but Charcoal Kebab House definitely deserves it. I've been to this place a few times and loved it so much that I didn't want to write a review so that I could keep it to myself. However, recently they have renovated and now have doubled the seating so I feel like I can share :P

For anyone that comes here yes, the service is slow and the food does take its time to come to your table but there is a very good reason why. Before the renovations you could clearly see into the kitchen and notice that noodles were handmade fresh to order. I have had pulled noodles all over the city and nothing compares.  All the other places I've been to pre-make their noodles and refrigerate them.  This made to order process is what puts these noodles on another level. 

When visiting try anything with noodles in it, and try the lamb and chicken kebabs. Honestly, everything on the menu is very good. Just remember to bring a big appetite. The menu has photos so If it looks good, order it. You will not be disappointed.

The hours are a little unique.  My guess is because they are creating the freshest noodles possible the speed is not ideal for the weekday lunch crowd. so they opted not to open during lunch on weekdays. Instead they are open after 4pm on weekdays and starting at 1pm on weekends.

Like the old saying goes you can't rush perfection."}
{"text":"Really like their lamb skewers!! I also like their hand made noodles. Although,  I wish it has more noodles."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, very authentic along with the artwork hanging on the wall. Lamb skewers were perfectly cooked (and much larger than I anticipated, very worth the price) and everything we tried was very flavourful, but watch out!! The food is very oily (but delicious!). We tried the dapanji, lamb skewers (with naan), Uyghur lamb polo (rice, lamb, and raisins), kidney skewers, lamb soup, and the langman noodles. Their hand-pulled noodles are very long and have great texture. I don't have any negative comments for anything I tried. It was all fantastic! I recommend their signature lamb skewers and the dapanji.

The only negative comments I have for this place are: the food is served rather slowly, and the seating & service was a bit awkward... Tea took a while, which was strange to me (I am a regular at Chinese restaurants and tea is usually served immediately). It is a very tiny place, but it was worth it. The complimentary salad is nice, too."}
{"text":"This is a truly deserved 5 start rating. Oh man, I am literally making my mouth water just by thinking of that dish (dapanji) made of tender chicken, flat and wide handmade noodle (west China style), as well as some random supplementary vegetables like potatoes, bell peppers, scallion, n onions etc. It is an Uyghur restaurant, and Uyghur is an ethnic group mainly dwelling in the west part of China and mid Asia. Most Uyghur are Muslim, so the food this restaurant serves is Halal. 

Besides their signature dish Dapanji, there are 2 more stuffs I would like to strongly encourage foodies to give a shot. One is the cumin-spiced lamb skewer. Another one is the \"Naan\" (made from flour). In general, none of the stuffs i have tried there so far disappointed me. I have tried a few Uyghur style restaurants nearby GTA, and I personally think this is THE ONE you have to go. :-)"}
{"text":"The food is excellent, service on the other hand is very slow, only one person to serve and work the cash and clean up in the entire restaurant. The kabob is to die for and the noodles are very fresh. Decent ambiance and newly renovated venue. I would recommend the Lagman and Lamb Kababs"}
{"text":"Tries 2 skewers:

Lamb  & Chicken - both fatty and not enough marination.

Very bland tasting, they supposed to be marinated before bbq on charcoal.. definitely lack the fresh off the grill taste!

They dont offer steam rice or lemon for the charcoal...to say interesting is an understatement.
Nice clean and great atmosphere...but just not to my liking."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Highly recommend the Lang man Noodles. Kebabs were good too - chicken was very tender."}
{"text":"Excellent food! I think it's even better than Silk Road, great great xinjiang food, I love them, totally worth driving over an hour for it!"}
{"text":"Really good, fresh and well seasoned meat!
Make sure you under order as the quantity is a lot. What a unique spot in Toronto. The only downside is the lamb was pretty fatty... Mention that to the chef and he'll be more careful (lamb is generally fatty)."}
{"text":"Very fulfilling food! Rather than middle eastern kebab, it's more Chinese style Kebab!! We wanted to try a lot dishes. So we ended up spending 80 buck after tax and tips for a group of four. It was great food! Big portion for sharing! Nice service! But very limited space and not taking reservations. If you want to go as a big group, you might want to call the restaurant for special arrangement rather than just walk-in."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of lamb so guess I went to the wrong place. There were only few items on the menu that I could have. I ended up trying spicy chicken with some chicken kebab and house salad. The food quality is just okay, nothing stands out. Service is very slow though."}
{"text":"I had no expectations going to Charcoal Kabob House. It exceeded my expectations by a lot. We ordered Langman noodles, lamb skewers and lamb kidneys. 

Heavy use of cumin in the skewers and kidneys, so it was slightly overwhelming but otherwise good. Lamb skewers were a bit fatty but lamb usually is. I ate the noodles more than the skewers but my friend said they were amazing.

Cute decor and service is a bit spotty but otherwise it was a nice find! 

PS they don't take credit card - cash or debit only."}
{"text":"Yum... an absolute hidden gem in Scarborough!!! Just as you pull into the plaza parking lot you can already smell the lamb skewers from this restaurant. 

The interior of the restaurant is quite unique, kinda small but having a very homey vibe to it, with some interesting quotes on the wall. The server was very friendly and seated us right away. The menu is all in Chinese but everything on the menu looked so bomb - I wanted to try all of them! 

You can either ask for water, or grab a drink of your choice from their fridge that they have near the front of the restaurant, and pay for it afterwards. 

We ordered the lamb skewers, lamb soup, the hand pulled noodles and the short noodles (sorry - forgot the names of these!!!) 

The lamb skewers were flavourful, but a bit dry. I've read reviews that the skewers were juicy but unfortunately, I did not have the same experience. Otherwise, the skewers were huge and it comes with handmade naan - my favourite, esp anything with carbs!!! 

The hand pulled noodles and short noodles were super chewy and yummy as well! The portions are enough to share between two people. I would definitely recommend getting one of these dishes along with the lamb skewers."}
{"text":"1st visit was not impressed. Ice cold noodles meat at tough as my shoe sole
 Ordered xtra kabobs waitress never put order in and this was for take out. Was also told 15 min wait that turned in to 40 min
 Wont return"}
{"text":"looking for longevity noodles? you'll find them here. the handmade LANGMAN NOODLES are never ending - to the point where a single strand will fill up half your bowl! (after much effort to get it into your bowl to begin with..) the noodles shone on its own with its toothsomeness, but it also comes with a decent amount of veggies

LAMB SOUP is on the greasier side, as a lot of the meat is quite fatty. if you're not careful, the spicy oil drizzled on top will catch you by surprise. all 4 of us were coughing within the first few sips. oops! luckily it's not a lingering nor mouth-numbing kind of spice. still necessary though, as I have a feeling the soup would've been way too lamb-y without the garnishing oil.

there's a LAMB KEBAB COMBO which comes with 4 large skewers of tender grilled lamb, naan, and a vinaigrette-heavy (though still refreshing) salad. the flavor of this kebab was super intense; spot on.

the UYGHUR LAMB POLO rice pilaf had some carrot and raisins mixed in, with a chunk of lamb on top. rice was toothsome too; not bad.

menu comes in English and Chinese versions. selection is quite limited, but judging from their website it seems like there might be a secret menu as well. wouldn't hurt to ask for additional options. the entire restaurants seats maybe 20, and it was decently busy on a Saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in Toronto!! 

If you haven't tried charcoal kabob (Uyghur cuisine) you have not lived yet. The lamb kabob is not your traditional kabob. It's tender and taste fresh and good. The lamb soup and the rice dish are also seems to be the crowd. This place gets packed fast best time is when they open. The owner is very hard working and amazing personality. The server is very soft spoken and sweet and attentive. Can't wait to go back again :)"}
{"text":"Where to start. Still on the soup stage, yet have not been asked if we want anything to drink. But before I get that far. Let's start. They squeezed 8 people on a table of 6. Gave menus in Chinese (or another Asian language) which I don't understand. Had to ask for English menus and was giving a dirty look. Finally got menus and took a while to take our order. So the since we were seated at a table of 6. We are still waiting for 2 extra sets of utensils and napkins. After soup. Which in my opinion was just okay. Although some of my family members enjoyed the soup. Finally after asking for the 4th time we finally got utensils.  Yay (hopefully you can feel the sarcasm there). 

So the food finally came out, one meal at a time. And something to think about is that each dish is for individuals and not for sharing. 

To this point we've asked for water and for the table and yet not received anything. 
Our final dish came. Yet no water. Low behold finally some water. 8 people 6 glasses. Wonderful. 

I think I'm done with this review."}
{"text":"This place didn't have the best service. Though our waiter was good, it seemed as though he was the only one working. Which caused heavy delays for our food. When we finally got our food, the aroma was great and it looked good. However, it was not satisfying, considering how long we waited to get it as well. The kebab's were nothing special, as we expected more considering it has kebab in its name.

Wouldn't recommend this to someone, there are other places that are better."}
{"text":"Excellent food. We got the lamb kabobs (very Smokey and tender!) and the spicy noodles. Great amount of spice! 

Some reviews say that the service is terrible so we were fairly warned. You just have to flag the girls down when you are ready to order and pay, that's all. Help yourself to to the drinks in the fridge and they will add it to your bill.

(You're right Avi K.  I should have reported it right away. I have removed it from my comment, thank you)."}
{"text":"Definitely the best Xinjiang Food in GTA. This is including the famous Silk Road in Etobicoke. Almost everything is the same taste as they are in Xinjiang, where I had spent more than 20 years since I was born. If you are from Xinjiang, visit this place and you know what I am talking about.

Best of all - VIP langman(well, this is more personal as it is simply my favorite Xinjiang dish - and it is hard to find something so authentic even in most part of China outside of Xinjiang), Roast Kidney (remember to bite both the fat and the meat together - if you remove the fat then you lose the best part of it), lamb soup (yes it is totally greasy but you just don't feel it when you eat), Dapanji is definitely delicious if they are not very busy...if they are busy let them cook it for a bit longer to make sure the chicken is fully flavored.

They have been adding new dishes onto the menu and my two visits have been totally satisfactory. My only wish is they can keep the quality when they expand! And they definitely will because they are simply so busy these days."}
{"text":"Very traditional taste. Very classic. Good restaurant for going out with friends, especially who love lambs. It is a restaurant you can go back. But sometimes the service is too slow."}
{"text":"Great food but very slow service. Sat 20 mins and they would not even ask unless ask. One person servicing al the people seated and standing is a problem. You ask them to take order and they will still not show up."}
{"text":"The food is great. Tried the lamb skewers and this huge bowl of stew. Really flavorful  but the service was terribly slow. Waited a very long time for food to arrive. Asked and waited for 20 min for water. And left before we got our whole order. Place has great potential and will definitely go back that's how good the food was. Hopefully service gets better ASAP"}
{"text":"Uyghur? How to pronounce? I am always happy to try new food. This is my first time trying Uyghur. From the pictures it's very similar to northern Chinese food. After trying, we thought it was \"ok\". 

We had some kebob skewers and a dapanji. We were very happy with the skewers (some lamb and chicken). The seasoning is excellent. I thought one of the skewer may have been slightly overcooked as the meat was slightly tough. Not a big deal for me. The chicken was alright. Lamb is better (and cheaper). Get the lamb. 

We had mixed feelings about the dapanji. For a 2 people portion, I thought there was enough meat for 4 people. So keep this in mind. The taste was alright, but my problem with the dapanji was it didn't have enough noodles. I personally enjoyed the noodles much more than the meat. The sauce is like the chili oil based sauce you find typical in Northern Chinese cooking.

Would I come again? Probably. But next time I'm just going to get lots of skewers with with carbs (maybe the polo?) 

P.S. No Alcohol. I always thought northern folks love to drink with their meals. My GF really wanted a drink. Just FYI if you are coming and I hope they get some alcohol in the shop soon."}
{"text":"Today we went there after many years, and I have to say I am really surprised how much they have improved. The lady at the desk was smiling, courteous and helped us find a spot, by re-arranging the desks so we didn't have to wait 30-40 mins to sit down. Food was delicious! My family liked it a lot, even my kids! Btw, we spent roughly 140 for seven people."}
{"text":"If it was just the food, this place would get a five star. The kebab is the best in town and the noodle dishes are amazing. The service, however, is chaotic and unorganized. They need a manager who is incharge of organizing the waiting staff and communicates with customers.

There was a line of 5-6 different groups waiting at the door. It took over 20 minutes and customers overflowing into the restaurant before a waitress acknowledged the presence of people waiting. By then everything has become chaotic. If they had a hostess who greeted customers at the door, it would help organize seating."}
{"text":"??????? ??????? ???3???????? ??????? ?????? ???????????

The rice with lamb is very good! Too much salt in the noddles, the kidney is raw and undercooked, lamb kebab is very very bad!"}
{"text":"Would give it a 1.5 star if I can. The kebabs and the pollo rice are tasty, but service is the worst. We were there for 1.5 hours, only ordered 3 kebabs, rice and 2 noodles. 2 kebabs finally came out after we asked the waitress to check on our order which was after 50 minutes of waiting. Chicken kebab and rice came out after another 20 minutes. Noodles came a bit after that but after 1.5 hours we decided to leave and cancelled the remaining dish because it wasn't worth the wait. They are under staffed and it's too bad."}
{"text":"Love this place! I think this is the second Uyghur restaurant in Toronto. The other one is Silk Road. I used to go to Silk Toad constantly. But I live in North York, so this location is a way better option. They made  good noodles, kebab, dapanji, and I also like their polo lamb rice. The only thing I have to point out is that you have to be patient to wait your order. They made everything very slow (the average waiting time is 15-20 mins). So don't go there if you are in a hurry. But I have to say that most of the dishes are worthy the wait."}
{"text":"Having recently become interested in the Uyghur culture and cuisine after having looked up several media sources on-line, I was very keen to come out this restaurant after hearing it mentioned as a dinner with friends. Given its location I knew I would have to set a side a good day to commute here if I wanted to reward my quest with a taste of the intriguing looking cuisine that was significant of to distinct Central Asian nation.
But my quest to go there was commenced sooner that I had planned when yesterday a dining companion keenly wanted to take a look when I mentioned it to him. And so we did just that.

We were both off to a funny start when we unexpectedly discovered that the restaurant caters to both Mandarin speaking and non-Mandarin speaking customers when we were given menus with Chinese scripts in them. We both had an amusing moment when trying to figure out what each dish was while also pretending to be academic linguists in the making by trying to decipher the Chinese description. Pretend-time was cut short when I decided to ask the waiter if English menus were available, he had a brief moment of embarrassment while going to get the respective menus.
Most of the items are laid out across on a one page fold-out menu each accompanied with a picture depicting the described dish. 
There are a few noodle dishes that looked similar to one another with the beds of noodles making the distinguishing the difference, a couple of soups and stews and the more familiar kebabs with the turkic style thicker naans. 

So the two of us decided on getting the lamb kebab combo which comes with naan and an iceberg lettuce salad and also a langman noodle plate.
The kebabs came out first and having not had lamb in a while taste of the bite size pieces were dainty for me and even more so when wrapped in a piece of the naan bread. I hope that the owners start serving an Uyghur style salad at some point, it would make all the difference compared to the ice-berg salads that are served at other more distinct places.
But I definitely loved the noodles and what made it really good was the spiced-up gravy from the lamb curry that it was cooked in. I kept alternating between the noodles and spoonfuls of the hearty liquid. The flavor in the gravy reminded me of similar flavors found in some of the curry based noodle dishes in my country so it was really enjoyable to be able to taste something familiar from the langman dish. And if naan bread was also available as a side order I would have asked for one to soak up some of that gravy, yes delicious.

Alot of the reviewers have mentioned the Dapanji so that what I'll have to try next time and maybe some of the other noodle dishes."}
{"text":"A delightful experience!!! Definitely it was worth driving there from mississauga.

A small but nice place. Tastefully decorated. Great service.

We had Lamb Kabob and Lamb Kidney. We haven't found this Kidney Kabob in other restaurants, pretty  unique I rather say... and pretty good. All the items were very well prepared and delicious. This is one of the best Kabob places we have been so far."}

{"text":"Found another gem in Scarborough! First time tried Uyghur foods... Absolutely loved their chicken and lamb skewers! So fresh and juicy.. no doubt, it was made with perfection! Also the staff was so friendly and helpful. Very cozy, dark & warm interior."}
{"text":"This was a recommendation from a friend and it came with a history lesson that the Uyghur people that represent this cuisine are descendents of the individuals from the silk road that gave Marco Polo his first tastes of pasta. 

I will tell you that it is located in a strip plaza and has a quaint little ambience.  The sounds and smells from the kitchen add to the experience. The menu is simple and is presented with pictures.  

While I waited for my meal i enjoyed some tea which had to steep for 15 minutes.  

l ordered the lamb and chicken skewers as they are a staple on the menu and came highly recommended. It was good and eating it with the naan is incredible. You can taste the cumin and other spices as they came through.  The chicken was so soft and tender it was my preferred choice. 

Uyghur Somen a dish that is made with a short noodle with veal and peppers, cilantro, string beans, tomatoes  and other fresh vegetables.  The broth was hearty, earthy and flavourful there was something familiar yet new about the taste. The spices were hot but you couldn't taste it on the front end, it blended nicely and complemented the overall flavour.  

You can tell if this was Marco' s first experience to pasta how it was the inspiration for what the world knows today. 

A really excellent experience, while the food isn't fast, that's one of the redeeming qualities as everything is fresh.  I will definitely be coming back."}

{"text":"Service - the waitress did not even say hi. We were seated, she gave us a menu, walked away and then came back in like 10 minutes after to take our order. WE HAD TO ASK HER FOR WATER. She did not check on us during the meal at all. 2 stars - she asked us if everything is ok when she gives us the bill and she said Thank you after we paid. Overall, bad service. NO service.

Food
Dapanji ($ 26.95 serving for 2 ppl) - 2 stars for the taste - TOTALLY NOT WORTH IT!!
This dish is made out of 50% potatoes, 20% flat noodles, 15% chicken BONES, 5% chicken meat, 10% sauce and green onion. There is NO chicken breast or thigh in this dish. All chicken pieces in this dish are the chicken back bone where there is almost NO meat. Well, the meat in the chicken are properly used to make their chicken kebab, that is why you don't get any in this dish. Total disappointment.

4 Charcoal lamb kebab combo with salad and nan ($ 18.45) - 2 stars for the nan.
Lamb kebab - low quality meat. The spice was ok, but the lamb was not juicy and tender. Dry and chewy. No lamb taste to it. The salad was just lettuce and dressing, that is it..NOTHING else in it. Not even a piece of carrot or tomato. Food was only warm, not hot. Apparently not freshly made. 

Price - WAY OVER PRICED. TOTALLY NOT WORTH IT.

The bottom line is We will NOT be back again."}
{"text":"It was used to be acceptable food, now it is just terrible.
The service was slow, not something new, we used to wait for about 45 mins. It is bad because there is no improvement.
Da Pan Ji was bad bad bad, less flavour than before. Lamb rice was undercooked, way too greasy. Kebab was great but way too small portion for the crazy price.
Worse service than before, they used to pack the leftover for us, now the guy feels strange and  reluctantly packed the food for us which almost drop the chicken to me. Seriously???
Never come back again! Totally not recommend!"}
{"text":"So wanted to love this place
Halal food is hard to come by
Pros the waitress was nice enough to acknowledge us when we arrived 
Cons

The guys said it takes time we dont microwave food here
Thanks buddy my microwave gives me better customer service than you."}
{"text":"This is for the owner of this establishment and all who want to come here.

Food 4/5

Service 2/5

Ambiance 3.5/5

Firstly food is overall good.  A few things need slight tuning and they would be great.  

Items to try:

House made noodles dish, dumplings, lamb soup


Service is friendly but very inattentive.  There is no one to check food is served on time, or at the same time.  Huge lag times.  There should be more then one server with a fully packed restaurant.

Ambiance was nice.  Desperately in need of double doors or a curtain to keep out the cold draft out when the entrance door is opened.

Overall I would recommend trying out this place for food but be patient when it comes to service."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants ever!!!!!!!!

I think the skewers are 10x better than the next best skewers I've ever had in my life.

they have these awesome BOYLAN soda drinks in their fridge... If you come you should try the black cherry one omg, but all of the other flavours are pretty good too!!! Wish I knew where to buy them in Toronto :'(

The lamb buns are SO GOOD there are actually chunks of lamb meat in it and the flavor is so amazing.

And plz if u wanna have some good da pan ji you can't say u found the best until you compare it to the one here !!! :) 

I am drooling just thinking about the food here!!!!

I saw a lot of ppl complained about the service but I come here regularly and they must have improved a lot since they opened bc we never really had much of a problem with service. So no reason for anything less than 5* now hehehehhe"}
{"text":"Food is great. Amazing . Tasty. It's what hakka Chinese food whats to be. Authentic north eastern chinese food. I'm so happy I don't have to fly to China to eat this food. One thing lacking is THE  customer service. Alot of people come in and out. Sure the place is small but one waiter isn't enough. It tires the worker and thus they become cranky and not willing to go that extra mile. Would I go back? Perhaps. The food is made for kings."}

2.5 star 

Noodles!! Hand Pulled Uyghur Noodles!

Pro Tip: Don't be fooled by the name of the restaurant! They just disappointing.. Skip!

We tried

Lamb ($1.98) - meh
Beef ($1.98) - meh
Shrimp ($2.50) - meh
Lamb Kidney ($3.50) - dried and bland

All the skewers just bland tasting, they supposed to be marinated before bbq on charcoal.. definitely lack the fresh off the grill taste!

Pro Tip: Order the 2 noodles off the menu

We shared 

Langman with Lamb ($8.99) 
- noodles cooked al dente with good bites
- Love the green beans that not overcooked give good contrast to the noodle
- spicy pepper and sauce are delicious!
- portion on the smaller size 

I really enjoy their house made hot sauce which has a really distinguish favours and wondering what's the ingredients. The waitress just said she is not sure because she didn't make it herself? 

Charcoal Kebob House has a really limited menu. Hopefully there will be more interesting items be added and they would improve on their grilled skewers since they just opened recently!

Maybe I might come back and try their Danpanji (Big Plate Chicken with Home made noodle) or Manta (Steamed Lamb Dumplings 6/$11.50) but definitely not in a rush... 

Pro Tip: There are a lot of other restaurants in the Scarborough area that offers similar items at a much lower price point and taste better... 

I really want to love Charcoal Kebob because of their nice family vibe but hopefully they would improve over time as they are really relatively new!"}
