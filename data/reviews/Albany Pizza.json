{"text":"This guy does it right every single time.... A great pizza, great service and fast delivery.  No other pizza place like it in Toronto.  My kids love it also.   Try the pizzas, you will not be disappointed...   John F"}
{"text":"Wow. I have been ordering from here for a long time and really like their pizza. However, tonight I placed an order around 7pm and was called back 30 minutes later to say that they would not be delivering to me because they were too busy. When I asked how long I would have to wait, or if I could get a credit on my account they simply yelled at me and hung up the phone. What a terrible experience. These people are disgusting, unorganized and hateful. I even tried to call back from multiple phones to try to just speak with someone about my order/experience and they did not answer. Sorry Albany, you have lost my business completely."}
{"text":"I've been looking for some good, New York style pizza. You know, thin crust, no skimping on the cheese and greasy. A lot of the other places in Toronto, when I look up New York pizza on Yelp, they don't have the thin crust or at least as thin as I like it.  This place, which granted I have not gone to every pizza joint in Toronto, has so far gotten as close to that experience as possible. It's not as greasy but it's got this really nice thin crust (toppings go right to the edge) and full of cheese and toppings. It's also good that I can put in an order and then go grocery shopping next door and in 10-15 minutes, my pizza is ready.  There's also a walk in special (with time restrictions) for a pepperoni pizza.  I highly recommend Albany Pizza!"}
{"text":"This has been my go-to local pizza place for a few years now. They have a nice crispy/chewy thin crust, with sauce and toppings all the to the edge. The walk-in special is great if you need to head to No-Frills for some groceries, and you can grab your pizza when you're done.  They've got some unique pizzas on the menu which are delicious but can get a little pricey, so I usually just stick to pepperoni unless I feel like splurging.   They have delivery of course, but I always pick it up and they are friendly and chatty every time. Great little local business."}
{"text":"You wouldn't normally have high hopes for a pizza place attached to a No Frills. Albany Pizza, however, is a hidden gem on Lansdowne Ave. The crust here is thin and crispy. The pizza is cheesy and has just the right amount of toppings as to not overwhelm all the flavours of the crust, cheese and sauce. The pizza is a bit on the pricey side but definitely worth it.  I find they always have at least a couple of veg slice options every time I go. Slices are $3.75 which makes a perfect snack after a trip to the grocery store."}
{"text":"I live in the Bloor Lansdowne area and I've been pining for a great pizza.  I do grocery shopping at the No Frills on Dundas, so I thought I'd get delivery from Albany one night.  The pizza was huge, and barely fit the box. The crust thin, with toppings and sauce cooked not just all the way to the edge, but over the edge.  Amazing.  Fresh fresh ingredients and delicious sauce.    It's some of the best pizza I've had, and I'll continue to go back.  Excellent service from a great owner who cares about his customers."}
{"text":"Going through a bunch of different options for take-out, and after a terrible experience with Pizzaiolo, decided to give them a go. A friend had this pizza at a party a while ago and it was pretty good. I ordered one of their veg. signature pizzas with all grilled veg and carmalized onions. IMO the crust was just the right amount, not too much cheese and the vegetabels were perfect. Best part too is it was even better the next day cold. This was very solid and a bit different than the usual ones out there so it stands apart IMO. Price was up there a bit ($20 for a 12 inch) but considering you get more toppings than dough and cheese, I thought it was worth it."}
{"text":"I walked in because I was picking up some stuff at the grocery store and felt like a pizza. Had a pepperoni slice. Now I have a pepperoni slice there every time I go. Dough is thin, kinda crunchy, and gives a good chew. Toppings go right the the edge of the crust. Sauce is tangy and a little salty. Generous pepperoni. Just the right amount of grease on top.  Just drop in and get a slice. There's tons of parking if you're driving.  I'll try something else there soon (thinking veal sandwich - couldn't be better than California though right?) but I still really like the pepperoni slice."}
{"text":"Only ordered once and thoroughly enjoyed. As described by other reviews. Tasty thin crust, yet substantial toppings. Will order again for sure."}
{"text":"I wish I could give them 4.5 stars as they have excellent pizza but the garlic bread was a little lackluster. The pizza was wonderful and they piled on the kalamata olives and pepperoni which made my day."}
{"text":"Very grateful I live near this pizza place. My favourite pizza in the city.   I use this blanket statement because I eat a lot of pizza and can't stop craving one from Albany.  I recommend ordering one of the Albany Pizza Specials instead of a slice because there are so many more topping options, interesting creations and flavours that need to be experienced. They may be a bit on the pricy side but are made with pride and are perfectly thin. Specifically, the Sicilian. I never would have thought of potato as a pizza topping and that it would taste so wonderful.   The calzones, sandwiches and pastas are also great but the pizza is what keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"Great local pizza, great crust and as good as it gets sauce. Calzones are great as well, get the side order of sauce for .75 cents, very tasty."}
{"text":"Gorgonzola cheese, caramelized onions and bacon for your toppings  DO IT. ORDER IT RIGHT NOW.  YOU WILL LOVE ME"}
{"text":"SOME OF THE BEST PIZZA IN TOWN !The delivery was fast and yet it was delicious and hot. Good selection on the menu , but don't order the chicken wings unless you like eating giant sized ones. The Meat Lovers pizza is the best , but add black olives , even better. I really recommend this place."}
{"text":"Pretty nice pizza place beside the no frills. Great to grab a slice before or after shopping here. The crust is very thin with the right amount of cheese. The slice could have used some. More sauce, but extra sauce is free so I'd just do that next time. I had a plain cheese slice.  Also the staff was super friendly."}
{"text":"Looked and tasted like crummy frozen pizza (not even good frozen pizza). Was really disappointed. I remember this place being good before, not anymore."}
{"text":"Just moved into the hood and looked this place up. Ordered the Albany veg pizza and it's delicious. Totally recommend. Delivery was super speedy and the price is fine (esp since the pizza is awesome)."}
{"text":"In addition to good quality pizza, Albany also delivers pastas, salads, Italian sandwiches and calzones.  Anybody who lives in the area has absolutely no reason to order from one of those pizza chains; the sauce here is better, the crust here is better and there are lots of nice toppings to choose from.  The service is reasonably quick, the staff are very nice and the food never disappoints."}
{"text":"Though I don't live in the area, I decided to check out  Albany Pizza due to the great reviews on Yelp. Finding it was tricky as it is not visible from the road; however, it is located right beside the No Frills and will be hard to miss once you enter the plaza.  The place is very no frills, but packs a great punch. The pizza is thin crust and as Patrick M. raved, \"it is the best of the non-chain pizzas in the immediate area.\" I would have to agree. There are a lot of options as the list of gourmet toppings is quite extensive. It would be a great grab and go kind of place, or dine-in if you have the time. The staff is very friendly and professional."}
{"text":"I normally only eat pizza when 1) it's free (work or party related) 2) i don't want to be a picky food snob in a gathering and the majority wants pizza, 3) pizza hut buffet! (For the fat child inside of me and for nostalgia reasons - don't judge)  But I think Albany might have changed my mind about this meager dough. Oh! it's way more than just dough and pizza and tomato sauce.... in fact, it doesn't even have that much cheese or tomato sauce, it is loaded with all the other toppings! The toppings go all the way to the edge (so mind you, neat pizza eaters). The crust is thin and very crispy. We got the Quattro Stagioni pizza and it was divine! The pepporoni pizza is also one of the best pepporoni pizza I've had.   Excuse me as I go do some exercise so I could have more Albany Pizza."}
{"text":"New favourite place! Thin crust and cheesy to perfection! Tried this place recently and won't ever go back to the big chains. This pizza is classic and simple hits the spot!"}
{"text":"My go to pizza delivery place! I love their thin crust pizza which is not overloaded with tomato sauce (which I personally prefer) and they are not stingy on toppings :) Pizza is always usually delivered fast & the drivers are always pleasant."}
{"text":"Definitely the best non-chain pizza place in tha 'hood.    I have had slices from this place before as I'm going in to the grocery store (it's never a good idea to shop hungry, or hangry :)).  Each time I've had a slice it's been excellent.   Last night my bf and I decided to order a 'za for take out.  We just got a simple cheese pizza with chili flakes. 13\" for $9.99. Not bad, right?  It's been awhile since we've had a slice, so we were kinda fuzzy on what to expect but knew that it was a good chewy, crunchy thin crust.  When we got home, we were not disappointed.  It all came back... cheese to the edge, a really fantastic chewy thin crust - NOT cardboard. The sauce is tangy and sweet and just enough salt.  The cheese amount was perfect. It wasn't goopy, just enough grease, but there was no grease dripping off of it. JUST the perfect amount of chili flakes too. Usually I have to add more but this guy got it right.  It was ready in 10 mins and we ate the WHOLE thing. Super good.    I definitely recommend you get delivery or pick up a slice next time you're going to NoFrills on Lansdown. This place is great.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Petite pizzeria cachée sur le parking du No Frills, qui ne paye pas de mine de l'extérieur mais qui à un choix de pizza intéressant.  En effet il y a un large choix de pizza et de tailles, pour tous les gouts. Le patron et son équipent sont gentils et serviable et cela donne envie d'y retourner! De plus les prix ne sont pas trop chers! Et elles sont vraiment bonnes!!!"}
{"text":"I've stopped in here a few times, as its the only form of food in this strip mall attached the the No Frills, and I've realized that sometimes its better to throw down some money for a meal before going grocery shopping hungry to avoid buying a bunch of impulsive food you wouldn't otherwise have bought.  So yeah, I'm usually here for a quick bite and have settled on a few different slices of pizza and a veal parmesan sandwich. The pizza slices are decent, and relatively cheap. The veal sandwich is admittedly not great quality veal. Really thin cut and while it tasted fresh, really wasn't all that impressive in the flavour department despite the standard sauce, plus additional cheese and hot peppers I had added.   Perhaps the secret is a full pie delivered for enjoyment, based on the other reviews. I'm just not sold on committing more to this place than a casual stop in."}
{"text":"The best of the non-chain pizzas in the immediate area!  With Albany here, there's no reason to suffer sub-par pies.  I'm inclined to say \"3.5 stars\", as I'm still just as likely to order from, say, Pizza Pizza (largely due to group familiarity... if it's just Heather and me, I think Albany is the way to go).    As others have mentioned, the (friendly and earnest!) guy at Albany doesn't mess around with his toppings:  sauce and cheese literally flow over the edge, the crust is thin and nicely bubbled/crisp on the bottom, and the toppings all seem to be fresh cut rather than purchased in bulk from a supplier (could be wrong; if I am, it's a damn fine supplier).  Curiously, he has an old review posted in his store that cites Albany amongst the best pizza in TO... but the headline over his entry is \"Better than Chuckie Cheese\", which he has covered with a stroke of black marker.  Seems silly, because it's still legible, and there's nothing wrong with being \"Better than Chuckie Cheese\" when the rest of the entry refers to your pizzeria as one of the best in the city and praises you unabashedly.  Anyway.  Albany is a-ok in my books -- I'll click \"4 star\" rather than \"3 star\" simply because the proprietor seems to genuinely pleased to be there.  Supporting good people and local shops is worth at least half a star!"}
{"text":"Odd location, next to no frills.  Looks like it would SUCK, ugly sign, boring inside. Pizza is good and affordable."}
{"text":"Got delivery. Was just ok and quite pricey. Better than Pizza Pizza but not as good as Fresca on College."}
{"text":"Albany Pizza recently left a flyer wedged in my condo door. Proving that advertising does in fact work, my friends and I ordered a Pizza shortly after finding it there. I've walked passed their location several times. It's a dumpy looking shop next to the No Frills on Lansdowne. Who would have thought they made such majestic take-out Pizza. We ordered three of their pizza's, from their 'pre-built' menu: Albany Pesto Pizza, Albany Delight, and the Alla Toscana. They were all pretty damn good. So good I retroactively regretted ever ordering from the Pizza Pizza near by. Never again! Delivery was a bit slow, around 40 minutes or so. Still, I think it was worth the wait. If you live in the area you need to eat here."}
{"text":"I've passed this place a million times on my way to grocery shop at No Frills. We finally decided to try it. It was great. We ordered the pre-built pesto pizza, sans hot peppers. It was just the way I like my pizza, thin crust with the toppings going all the way to the edge. There wasn't to much sauce making it soggy and the ingredients were very fresh. The only caveat is the price, almost $25 for a 16\" pizza, but then again it was delivered for free."}
{"text":"I love this place!  It is my go to pizza shop.  My husband and I have been coming here for the past 3 years and can't get enough!  We're pretty simple with our pizza, pepperoni or cheese.  It has a resemblance to New York style pizza, thinner crust, delicious and a slightly oily.  The owner does a great job!"}
{"text":"The pizza is great -- 4 or 5 stars on average. Delivery is usually great -- drivers usually arrive on time or early and know how to find me in the coach house.   So obviously I'm a loyal customer.   Then, tonight, I waited 90 minutes for a 45 minute delivery. I was *screamed at* by the dispatcher when I called to see what was up. Turns out the delivery dude didn't notice that the delivery was for the coach house, didn't bother to call me when no one answered the building's front door, and decided to sit around for 20 minutes banging on my neighbors' doors like they were delinquents. Said delivery dude then helped himself to a 20% tip. (Literally: he walked away with my change.) Points for chutzpah!  Never again, guys.   Sorry.  (Not sorry.)"}
{"text":"Delivery was on time. Paid for extra cheese and sauce- pizza doesn't seem to have extra cheese. It is hot and fills our pizza craving. Prob won't order from here again, mostly due to price and lack of cheese."}
{"text":"A neighbor recommended this pizza place so I decided to try them out.  Got a custom 14\" pizza for $22. Definitely worth it and the guys who work there are so nice!!  Toppings I chose:  Artichoke Pesto Smoked Salmon Red Onions Capers  Best pizza I've ever had. The crust was both chewy and crunchy and the flavor was awesome!! The toppings go almost to the edge!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place - well, I've never been to it but they deliver and their product is amazing!!!!! Perfectly thin cooked pizzas with fresh vegetables and super friendly staff on the other end of the line.   They have TONS of suggestions for pizzas with many of them vegetarian which is important to me. And you can also custom your own. Price is right - market value or less I would say.  My book club ordered it - one of the girls lives nearby and suggested it. My favourite part of this story is when we ordered we asked how much we should get for 7 girls and he said, are you cute girls? To which we of course answered yes and he said, well, cute girls don't eat that much so you'll be fine with an 18\" - we all laughed. I hope that comes off as endearing as it was to us...He might have been wrong though...we consumed it in astonishing quickness and probably might have eaten more if there was any! One of the girls ordered it for clients at work the next day. Since then I've ordered it to the office, home again and at a friend's place. Nothing but rave reviews from my friends.   My favourite (so far!): The Giardinetta: Spinach, roasted red peppers, feta cheese and marinated archichokes (I love artichokes on pizza!, ok, I love artichokes!)"}
{"text":"Not a gourmet pizza, but for the style of pizza that it is, it's great. Toppings are excellent quality, crust is nice and thin. The prices are also very good!"}
{"text":"In the past I had just gotten a walk-in pepperoni slice, which was good, and good enough that I've wanted to go back, and I finally did last night for New Year's Eve.   We called way ahead for when we wanted it and they had it ready almost on the dot piping hot, and even on a busy night. As well, I didn't realize how many fun pizza combinations they had on their menu. If you are vegetarian you will be pleasantly surprised as well, as they just don't have one or two veggie pizzas for you to choose from. I have definitely become a fan of their Sicilian though. Because one, I love potato on pizza. Two, I love feta on pizza. Three, it has a bunch of red and green stuff to make it look nice and pretty.  I think this pizza is great. If you are looking for non-neapolitan pizza in the city, it is a good bet. The crust isn't super thick and is still nice and bready. It's not all crunch, and has a good consistency. They also are not cheap on the toppings, and seem to actually care about the appearance of the food they are sending out. I'll definitely be back sooner rather than later."}
{"text":"I love their pizza and more important, so do my kids. When you call to order one they seem rushed and sometimes kind of rude but that is the fun. They are usually unbelievably fast delivering, like surprisingly fast, like, how the hell did they do that fast."}
{"text":"Got delivery from here. Had a regular pepperoni. Delivery was fast and pie arrived hot. I read soo many reviews and was soo excited for the crust, that I got a bit dissapointed as it wasn't as crispy as I expected. Cheese does come to the border and it was a tasty meal for sure.."}
{"text":"VIBE  A friend ordered from here for her birthday.   WE ATE  This pizza is GREAT. Love learning about new places in the city. It's the type of pizza you can fold up. It's greasy but not too greasy. I'm a sucker for pepperoni but they have veg options too. Thin crust with a bit of a crunch. Yum and yum!   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  If I lived in the west end, I'd be ordering from here.  Definitely an underdog in the Toronto pizza world."}
{"text":"Am I missing something about this place?  I came here because my neighbor recommended it and to be honest, I can't see what  people are raving about. I ordered a deluxe slice and it was just okay. My server was very friendly though.  I think I'm gonna have to pay this place another visit."}
{"text":"It's pretty good. I really like their plain pepperoni pizzas. It seems to me like the closest you can get to NYC style za in the neighbourhood. The wings are kind of gross. Slimy and not very flavourful. I once ordered extra cheese and the pepperoni was under the cheese so I would be sure to ask for meat at the top if you get extra cheese"}
{"text":"There are lots of great options for thin crust pizza in Toronto, but this is my go-to for takeout.  Sooooo good!"}
{"text":"Friends and I had two pizzas delivered. I was a little weary when my friend told us that the crust was really thin, as I'm not a huge fan of thin crust pizza, but he said to trust him.   Pizza came and it was delicious. It wasn't thin crust that sometimes seems like you're eating a slice of cardboard, it was nice crisp chewy crust with a good amount of toppings."}
{"text":"Slice review:  I bought a pepperoni and cheese slice tonight as I was in the area and heard good things. I've noticed my downstairs neighbor order from this place even though there is a perfectly good place at the end of our street (Nick and Tony's)  I notice right off the bat that there was some fresher pepperoni slices in the window which I should have opted out for but settled for one that had been sitting out for a while. Cashier heated it up and settled up the total for $3.10. The man brought the slice to me as I was sitting down. I noticed the cheese was right up to the edge of the crust which can be a good thing if you're into that. The cheese had a good amount of grease coming off of it but not noticeable if you weren't looking for it. The pepperoni and sauce had a nice tasty flavor to it which blended well with such a thin pizza. The slice is typical in size and can be somewhat filling.  Overall this place seems alright. It sounded like the owner knew who the locals were (who walked in as I was eating) and even handed a man his pie when it was ready. I'd like to try a whole pizza here some time, but I fear it's not the pizza that I would fall heads over heals for."}
{"text":"I have a pretty serious crush on this mom and pop pizza shop.   Thin yet chewy, toppings to the very end of the pie and above-cheese, crispy pepperoni. They have pasta, wings and salads, too, and for only $4 you can get one of the largest side caesar salads in all of TO. Hail Caesar.   I have only had delivery (35 minutes, debit at the door), so I really can't speak to the ambiance, but if this joint is half as pretty as their pies are tasty, it'd be worth checking out in person."}
