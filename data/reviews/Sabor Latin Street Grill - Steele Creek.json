{"text":"Came here from $1 tacos and they were ok. I've been to the NoDa location and they were much better. The onions were chopped too big here and they seemed very rushed, the guac was not good at all. All I tasted were the big chunks of onions and some tang I guess which was from the juice or powder they use to make it. It was not blended well. They were busy bc it was taco Tuesday but I went to the NoDa location which was 4x as busy on a Tuesday and the tacos came out amazing! They also ran out of a salsa I asked for and it was about 7pm....the staff were really nice and I would return bc it is close to where I live but the quality needs to improve."}
{"text":"Love, love this place! I've been there three times now at the new Steele Creek location, and I'm seriously impressed. These people don't skimp on anything! The tacos are excellent, heaped with everything you want and the ingredients are fresh and tasty. Switching to more Caribbean fare, the   empanadas are sizable, with tasty fried pastry and generously full of meat, chorizo, or your preferred ingredient; they are delicious and especially so with real hot sauce, and they have a range of great sauces from mild through perfect. At this point they have soft drinks only but are supposed to have craft beers and Latin cocktails available soon. I give it the highest marks for the fresh, quality ingredients, generous amounts, perfect seasoning, friendly service, and the ease of ordering online and building your order in advance. I want this place to do well - it is a great addition to the limited offerings in this area, and I will be a regular!"}
{"text":"Very tasty, flavorful shredded chicken tacos (authentic style). The salsas and guac are also very good and freshly made. Will have to go back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"My first time at any Sabor, and I did enjoy it.  My friend and I went on a whim and the employee was very helpful in helping me make a decision that wouldnt undo everything I did at the gym next door (lol).    I ordered what I think was called the Avocado and quinoa bowl.  I didn't quite know what to expect, but it was delicious.  I ended up saving some for home, and they were more than happy to provide take home boxes.  I didnt realize before I went that they had beer (on Sundays domestic beers are $1.50) so I will have to make another trip to take advantage of their specials. :)"}
{"text":"I've eaten at the Elizabeth location which has been good however we did a take out order for dinner tonight and my experience was quite the opposite. The chips in the nachos were inedible they were so stale as though it had been brought out of storage from a long time ago.  The chorizo taco was the same inedible quality. Veggie taco and the Ranchero tofu were acceptable however.  The last straw was that they entirely forgot to put a gordita order in the bag,  so I lost out on another entree. Overall it was so disappointing especially since we live very close and were excited upon its opening."}
{"text":"This food here was absolutely worth the trip!!
Love the nachos. The street corn was awesome too!! The tacos were AMAZING and the Churro sticks was delicious!! Ohhhh the plantains are A MUST!! Our table ordered different entrees and we shared so we got to try a lot and it all was delicious!!"}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant for the first time last week and it was really good I was very skeptical about trying a new place my boyfriend insisted but I really enjoyed what I ordered.  The ingredients were fresh and flavorful, I look forward to trying them again. I had a taco bowl, and he had the Sabor Especial he loved it."}
{"text":"Have been here many times and given this place multiple chances. Food is pretty good. Service needs to be greatly improved. I've had 2 to go orders completely wrong and had to go back to have them fix it- completely missed my lunch hour.  Love the salsa bar but worry if it meets health standards.  Seems like the owners opened this place up and thought it would take care of its self."}
{"text":"Just stopped by for Taco Tuesday and it was great! I ordered 2 chicken tacos, 1 beef taco, corn and a beverage..not only was the food great, but so was the manager and team! I will definitely stop by again for a quick GOOD bite"}
{"text":"Awesome food.  Great tacos, especially for a dollar on Tuesday.  The salsa bar has everything you want from mild to burn the house down!  Nachos and burritos are great as well!  Specials almost every day.  Bottom line, they have Taco Tuesday on lock!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Sabor.  Eat at the South Park location at last monthly.  This location lacks the same feel.  It isn't as clean.  There was a guy with a McDonald's cup sleeping with his head down at a booth table behind me.  The Al Pastor pork was slightly burnt.  

The front counter guy (Joel) was excellent.  He was on his second day of work at Sabor.  He was the bright spot at this location."}
{"text":"Savors food and prices are absolutely incredible. You cannot go to Sabor without getting the queso. You've got to at least get the cup if queso or it's not a true trip to Sabor! Their tacos are so good and their nachos are even better! Definitely recommend the chicken and the beef!"}
{"text":"Ordered two bowls the EXACT same way. Do these look the same to you? EVERY TIME we order food from this place it is made incorrectly. Every time."}
{"text":"Awesome!  So glad they opened one out here. Know that it is a street taco place. Not a full out me I restaurant. Unbelievable flavor...hence Sabor!"}
{"text":"Impressive! I visited this location twice and was delightfully surprised at the quality of the food. During the first visit, I ordered the Carne Asada fries and a Paloma. Both were amazing! The fries were topped with fresh steak, guacamole, queso, pico de gallo, sour cream &  delicious cotija cheese! I'm not usually a fan of guacamole not made in-home, but I loved it here! The Paloma had a lovely citrus fizz which is refreshing after practically inhaling the fries lol. 

On the second visit, I purchased the sweet plantains and the Mucho Sabor Margarita in honor of International Tequila Day. Again, I was not disappointed!   I could eat their sweet plantains every day of the week. 

During both visits, the staff was welcoming and informative, and the restaurant was inviting and clean. I will definitely be visiting again!"}
{"text":"My meal. Fish taco, al pastor taco (GET ONE THEY ARE THE BEST THIG ON THE MENU OMG) and an arepa. Don't be fooled by the overflowing cheese, that bad boy is stuffed with goodies!
Best Mexican in the area and the staff is super friendly! 
Loved the pineapple Salsa and roasted habenero. The chips were sprinkled with some spicy seasoning and were pretty good, they also give you a ton so don't fill up before the meal.
This place is a must for any taco Tuesday enthusiast ($1 tacos)!!!"}
{"text":"So many great options!!  Fish and shrimp and vegetarian options!  But you don't get free chips unless you order a large side, which is WAY too much queso for a large family even.  I actually didn't like any of their chips or salsas.  But the shredded chicken and fish tacos were incredible.  I'll go back for those."}
{"text":"Tasty, fast casual Latin street food.  The menu can be overwhelming at first but everything I've tried is good.  I recommend trying an Arepa.  Also, the nachos are an extremely good bang for your buck - one is really enough for two people.  The space is pretty small, and this can be problematic for Friday lunch or Taco Tuesday."}
{"text":"Super impressed! Food was fresh, fast, priced just right, n delicious! Definitely be back n recommend you check it out. I promise they won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Dominican nachos are delicious with lots of shredded marinated chicken with cheeses, salsa, onions and topped on fried Yuca.  This is good and filling.  Guava desert is fried and dusted with cinnamon sugar, perfect fried fresh empanada.  Lots of local canned beers and other selections.  Friendly staff and orders are taken at the counter.  They have daily specials on the wall, Tuesday is 1.00 tacos.  Limited dining area, most business was to-go, from this hidden spot in a plaza off Hwy 49."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch today after hearing many great reviews.  While seating was tight and limited at lunch we got a seat right as our food was ready.  It is a good sign that it was busy.  I had an arepa and my wife had a quinoa bowl.  The flavors for both were excellent.  We also got chips to try out the various salsas.  The green monster and pineapple/habanero were outstanding.  Lunch for two was about $20 and was plenty of food.  We ended up with half of the quinoa bowl to go.  Sabor lived up to the hype and we can't wait to go back and try more of the food.  It was a great lunch."}
{"text":"Fantastic neighborhood spot. I really cant say enough about Sabor. I love the small neighborhood feel and authentic latin flavors. Taco Tuesdays is great. 2 dollar tacos can't be beat. The Carne Asada Fries and the Supreme Nachos are my favorite."}
{"text":"I ordered the chorizo empanada, arepa and plantanos and everything was amazing! The empanada was a little oily but very flavorful.
    The only drawback was the poor girl who was working her first day and her trainer had totally abandoned her and none of the 5 people in the kitchen seemed able or willing to go outside and get her."}
{"text":"This was my second time ordering from Sabor, and I must say they are consistently good and tasty. I ordered the Dominican Nachos, and added guacamole for less than a dollar. The dish was a rather large portion, and I definitely feel that I got my money's worth (the total was about $11). There's also the option to substitute French fries for the yucca. 
The dish was full of flavor and the presentation was great. I ordered through a delivery service, and Sabor prepared the to-go order perfectly and with everything I could need to enjoy the meal (which is unfortunately not super common these days). Will definitely be ordering again."}
{"text":"Omgosh. How do you even begin to describe finally getting a taste of something you've craved for 10 years? The Venezuelan Arepas are amazing... the chips are fresh and warm with seasoning... queso was decent... and they give you like 6 options for salsa. Staff was super friendly. Great place! Will be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"So glad to see Sabor on this side of town! 

I was already a fan of the food after visiting the location in Elizabeth. Simply put - this place knows definitely knows how to do Mexican food right! I've tried many things here but my favorites hands down are the tacos and empanadas. The tacos are simple and filling and just done right! I've tried the chicken and the steak both very well-seasoned and juicy!  And the empanadas are HUGE and delicious. They are always served up fresh with the most delicious salsa rosada that I've ever had. I love them! I have to get one every single time I visit! And let's not forget the salsa bar! So many different options to choose from it's perfect with the warm seasoned chips! 

And did I mention they serve margaritas. Geesh. How could you not love this place! I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE the food but the service is absolutely horrible!!  There was myself and two other people there when they took my order.  I took 20 minutes to get one BYOB. I actually had to ask the guy \"is that my food??\" After it sat on the counter for 20 minutes!  His response \"Uummmm....yeah I guess it is.\"  DUH!!!!! I'm the only one in HERE now!!!! 
 There is one guy that works there, tall heavy set Spanish guy, he is the ONLY one that has any kind of sense of urgency and that gets the whole CUSTOMER SERVICE idea!! I don't know his name but make him the f****** manager and have HIM retrain the entire staff!!!!"}
{"text":"I just LOVE this place! Great food, amazing, portions, and fantastic prices! The staff their is so friendly, especially Stephanie! She is always doing her job with a smile and treating the customers like friends. Thanks Sabor for a great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Love taco Tuesday here! Always busy but always good! Queso is some of the best I've had, not crazy about the guacamole"}
{"text":"Great tacos and guacamole. Salsa bar is good with mild to hot and verde sauce. My wife enjoyed her burrito. The best queso in the Charlotte area. We go here for latin meals most of the time."}
{"text":"Great food they made sure my order was correct. The establishment was clean and you can't ask for a better experience"}
{"text":"I love Sabor.  It is my favorite restaurant in NoDa.  Unfortunately it seems that this location off of Tryon is either nowhere near as good, or they had a terrible night.  It wasn't very busy, but no tables were clean, it took forever for the food, and the \"amigos margaritas\" we're not drinkable.  We ordered our favorite items that we ordered every week at their other locations, but it was nowhere as good.  It didn't taste fresh, and the presentation was slightly off.

I hope they step up their game.  I'd love to be a frequent customer since I live on this side of town now."}
{"text":"Subtracting one star because....

I wish they would improve is having someone busting the tables more often.. most of the staffs are more behind the kitchen so that leave the dining area and the tables a grand mess. Customers have to wipe it down themselves! But rest of the stars review... 

Finally. 1) I made to this place. 2) Steele Creek area has a place that NOT part of the national restaurants chains. Because that seem like it all it is out here! 
This Sabor location is a small place that offers Latin street food.. very straight forward. No mixed drinks. Many cans and bottles beers. Both local and imports. The fish taco was delicious. I devoured it before I can take a pic. Their corn on the cob with cheese?, sprinkle with some chili was on the sweet side. Didn't expect that!! But love it! The empanada that I ordered was supposed to be beef but I got chicken instead.. was also good. Fried nicely, very nice crust to it.. and lastly the sweet plantains. Boy do I love.. the sweetness is heavenly. And it has a nice burnt crust around the outside.. very savory at the same time. I would like to try the other location too. Maybe they can give me a good mojitos??

After I posted the review. Personnel contacted me to say YES THERES MIXED DRINKS!!! Yes!!!! Yayyyy!! MUST Try!!"}
{"text":"Came in because a friend recommended it. Service was friendly and quick. It's not a sit-down for sure. It's a great quick place to eat. I had the steak/fries app. It was on point. Beef cut fresh every day. Def a place to come to again and again. In my opinion it is a big step above Moe's / Salsarita's"}
{"text":"I've heard so much about Sabor over the last year or so. People always say how good it is, but I hadn't had an opportunity to try it out. So last weekend when I was looking for a takeout spot I decided it was high time I go. I feel like you can never go wrong with nachos so that's what I went for, I especially love places that let you basically build your own. Therefore I got some Barbados nachos and a large side of Queso. Nachos can be a hard thing to travel home with, but these held nicely. There was a good amount of toppings and meat but not so much it overtook the chips and left them a soggy mess. I asked for jalapeños in the Queso and they took that in the extreme and they were hot peppers just very pickled. Wasn't a big enough deal for me not to thoroughly enjoy my food or to keep me from going back! I could see this fast becoming my go to place!"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant for taco Tuesday. I understand that the tacos are $1 so you can't expect anything fancy or mind blowing but....the beef tacos are probably one of the worse things I've ever tasted. It's literally flavorless mush. If you are going for taco tuesday....DO NOT ORDER BEEF TACOS. You'll thank me. Just order the chicken. Trust me!"}
{"text":"The food was really good but they were extremely understaffed. There were literally 2 people working and it took the guy 15 minutes to even take my order because he was so busy in the kitchen helping to make to-go orders. They also ran out of chicken Empanadas in the middle of the day. I was highly disappointed. The place has great potential"}
{"text":"So this place is all the rave currently in Berewick. A few positives they sell alcohol for those who like to dine in. I ordered an empanada thinking it was going to be average size like the ones I cook at home. The empanada was big, and under filled. Lots of pastry, not very beefy. The burrito was gigantic, not sure why I ordered a burrito, I didn't even eat the \"she'll\" just ate the meat and etc from out of it. If they keep up the great reputation this place I know will be around for a long time. When I went through in today the owner was even in there stocking the fridge, and he even took my order! I'm sure a lot of people in my area would be more than thrilled if they offered delivery. Something to think about in the future? Doesn't seem like people had an issue driving though as I did the same. It's always good to be part of the wave and try things new and exciting.  I look forward to sampling new other item off the menu that may appease my taste buds.."}
{"text":"Yum.  Yum, yum, yum.

I had never ventured to a Sabor before, so at a girlfriend's suggestion to try the new one that opened at the front of her neighborhood, I finally got to taste the delicious.  

Newly opened, fresh and bright in a strip mall, on Father's Day at an odd time, we had the place to ourselves.  The gentleman at the register was super helpful, as staring at all of the menu options is a bit overwhelming.

We split a large queso.  The dip is a bit thinner than I prefer, but it was well flavored and the chips that were served with it (warm chips - yum) held up well to the dipping.  It was also good poured over the chicken taco americanos that I ordered.  The chicken was well seasoned and juicy, served with fresh lettuce and cheese (hold the tomatoes for me), served on a lightly grilled tortilla.  The tofu/quinoa bowl that my girlfriend got was HUGE and she said was delicious.  I could not believe all of the tofu and avocado in the bowl, it looked amazing.  

I can't wait to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"I think I could eat anything and everything on their menu and never have a bad ting to say. Love their empanadas, protein bowl most of all. I'm so excited that we now have one close to home in the Steele Creek area. I hope this means more great restaurants will follow!"}
{"text":"I'm really not sure where I've been the past decade or so, I guess living under a rock. Sabor Latin Street Grill has 8 locations throughout Charlotte and I'm just now getting to one. I don't get around to Steele Creek often, but when I do I have a new delicious taco joint to go to!

Staff is warm and patient. Great, small crew who are cranking out amazing food. The cashier, manager, and I small-talked about the state of Charlotte while I waited on the food and it was clear to me that they were very connected with the local culture, big plus for me! The menu was very enticing but I had decided on tacos before I even arrived. They have 3 styles so I decided to try one of each style with a different protein on each:

Authenticos with Tilapia: Corn tortilla with cilantro, onion, lime, and the fish. This was the most expensive as it upped the price by $2. Oddly enough it was my least favorite. It's not that I hated it, just wasn't my thing, Tilapia didn't vibe with me! Corn tortilla was good and savory though.

Americanos Al Pastor: Flour Tortilla with lettuce, tomato, cheese, and pork. This was the best for me. I could sit down and eat a barrel of these. I'm certain it was pork but you could have fooled me and told me it was prime ribeye.. delicious moist pork that had a great texture and a bold marinade. The whole taco was so fresh!

Locos Barbacoa: Corn Tortilla with sausage, salsa, cabbage, cilantro, lime, and the barbacoa. Very good, tender barbacoa with a savory tomato-like sauce/marinade. A lot going on all at once but definitely a winner.

Another great part of Sabor is their yellow tortilla chips are made in house and they are fantastic. Well seasoned with such a wholesome, full flavor. Warm from the fryer when they serve it to you and they have a full salsa bar ranging from whimpy to chipotle habanero. Somewhere in between there is pineapple habanero and this was great in small amounts, still spicy but not crazy!

Although this is way out of my typical Charlotte footprint, I'm glad I dropped in. With 8 locations I'm going to bring the office to one and get fat on the pork... more please!!"}
{"text":"This place is ever bit of 3 stars. Very mediocre. I think the hype stems from hipsters who are cheap. It's not creative or traditional. Lacks direction and I found the environment uncomfortable. That being said. The food is about as good as a local Applebee's."}
{"text":"Last meal in Charlotte was also one of the best. I was getting ready to leave Charlotte and head back to VA and had a few errands to run first. I had skipped breakfast and it was around 11:30am so my friends brought me here for a delicious lunch. 

Fro the Taco menu I ordered Autenticos with steak and added black beans. They also come with onion, cilantro and lime wedges. Since each taco comes with 2 soft shells and a ton of meat and beans I made my 2 taco's into 4. This was a perfect portion and filled me up without becoming stuffed before hitting the road for 5 hours. 

The staff was incredibly friendly and the food was also very very fresh. I'm looking forward to coming back on my next visit to Charlotte."}
{"text":"Warning: Huge portions, if you think you will be getting the stingy portions like the chains, think again. 
That being said, they have the typical menu expected, the quality of the food is top notch, again the portions are HUGE. 
They have a full service bar and seething around it. 
Kind of like the burger place that was in this spot prior to them it could use some sprucing up and a good cleaning, the ketchup that was on the garbage can a year ago (when it was the burger joint) remains, kind gross. 
We tried to watch football but they only have an inside antenna and could not tune in to any channels. With a bit of attention to detail they could become the go to place weekly."}
{"text":"Had Sabor for the first time last night and it was delicious.  Many different options to choose from.  Staff was super friendly.   Food is healthy and there are many healthy options."}
{"text":"I came here twice in the same week n The staff was very friendly n knowledgeable when I asked for suggestions, I ordered 3 different tacos the Americano one was my favorite but the other two was also very good. The price is very reasonable too so I'll come back again for the great food great pricing and friendly staffs! By the way tho make sure u go to the back of the restaurant and grab urself a bunch of sauce to try on ur food bc that's where they hide all the all you can get sauces even for Togo."}
{"text":"The food was good but far from authentic. Americanized Latin food. Nonetheless, it wasn't bad. If you're craving real Latin American cuisine , this isn't the place. Twist on chipotle I suppose. Good atmosphere ."}
{"text":"Fresh food with a great menu.  I can't wait to try something new next time.  The portion sizes are great but order chips and salsa to start while your empanada is cooking!  Super friendly kitchen and many types of salsa to try, mild to HOT! Food orser was accurate and plentiful.  The food hit the spot with my family and the next time I need a fresh family meal that is authentic, we will be coming back."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! I have had lunch here twice now and they never disappoint. Their nachos are soooo good. They also serve beer and margaritas, although I'm not crazy about the margaritas the food is good enough for 5 stars."}
{"text":"I'm always hesitant to try out tofu at restaurants but it was a great pick for the protein. The Spanish rice is full of flavor and the guac has a nice lime kick. The staff is friendly and food takes five to ten minutes, well worth the wait. They have some good specials so be on the lookout on the left wall so you don't miss out."}
{"text":"We was downtown Charlotte, visiting the hospital and was trying to get some lunch, and this little whole in the wall was right down the street. I had the plantain and burrito wrap and hubby had beefy loaded fries, and you have to try the different varieties of there corn to die for. Was was great, excellent little place to grab a bite. Staff was very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"I have visited the other locations for Sabor and have enjoyed the food and atmosphere. The other day I visited the location in the Steele Creek area and found it to be pleasant comma though not as enjoyable as the other locations. Part of this is due to no sitting outside. It also did not seem to have as Lively of a staff as the other locations. The food was still very good, and the staff was adequate. A little extra attention would make this location just as good as the others. I would not hesitate to recommend someone visiting Sabor, knowing the food is consistent and delicious."}
{"text":"Super excited to have them open a location near home. I have heard many good things from others about this restaurant. The location in Steele Creek is small but in a shopping center that has tons of parking. I have been twice now for takeout. I think the manager has taken my order both times. He is very personable and makes sure he gets the order right. My food has always been ready to go in 10 minutes or less which is the perfect wait time. I have ordered a variety of tacos, all good. They have a salsa bar with a variety of salsas. Plenty of to go cups which is nice. The salsas have been low or out on both occasions. Disappointing but ironically on both occasions, another takeout customer had already asked for them to refill, so I have been able to get what I wanted. On one occasion, I saw the nachos and OMG, I am going back for those when I have time to eat in. The place has been busy on both stops, so I hope that is a good sign. Steele Creek needs good, local, quality restaurants."}
{"text":"Went to Taco Tuesday at this quaint little establishment. Had a wonderful time with friends. Taco Tuesday consist of all beef or chicken tacos for a dollar. Served with chopped onion, cilantro and limes. The shredded chicken tacos were very tasty nothing spectacular but good. The beef however, was very underwhelming. It tasted like say old Taco Bell beer. Given this I'll still return to try the rest of the menu. They also offer additional condiments at a side bar. Oh, and the guacamole is awesome."}
{"text":"$1 tacos on Taco Tuesday, do I really need to say more?! The tacos are absolutely delicious and the salsa bar is fantastic. We've found our new Tuesday spot!"}
{"text":"This is old news to a lot folks in the Steele Creek area, but this place is awesome! My husband and I finally went to Sabor for lunch yesterday. The man at the counter was super friendly and helpful, answering all of my questions. I think he was the manager.  I wasn't sure exactly what some of the food was, so he asked me what I liked and made suggestions.
My husband ordered two Americanos tacos with ground beef. They were large. Had a large order of queso with chips. The chips were seasoned and warm. Both were delicious.
I ordered a fish taco and an empanada with shredded chicken. They were out of empanadas, so the manager suggested and arepa instead. It was delicious!
The sweet tea is good, but VERY sweet. I'm Southern, so I could handle it. They also have a great selection of alcoholic beverages. Can't wait to go back on a Friday or Saturday night and have a margarita with my meal. All the food was fresh and I thought it was a decent amount of food for the money spent. I even took home leftovers.
I had read some bad reviews on Yelp and wanted to experience it for myself. So glad I did!"}
{"text":"We have come her multiple times and the food it really good and the staff are really kind, engaging and funny!  Highly recommend!  Their chips are super yummy!"}
{"text":"I think my expectations were too high. Sometimes Yelp reviews will do that to you. Everything we had was good. Some of it was great. I got empanadas and I prefer them from On the Border (Gasp!) The salsa bar needed serious refreshing but it didn't happen during my visit. It was an odd time of day though- like 3pm. The pineapple habenero salsa was banging. Some salsas were ok and some I didn't get to taste because they were empty. I will be back and look forward to trying the carne asada fries."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the customer service went above and beyond. After we had been done eating, an employee came by our table with two containers of tacos. Apparently they realized that chorizo had been left off our tacos. We didn't notice, but they did it anyway. It was a much appreciated touch to our already tasty experience."}
{"text":"Came by last Friday evening to pick up dinner for me and my family. Each entree had something wrong with it. Asked for no tomatoes on the Americano tacos- all 3 had tomatoes. Ordered a kids ground beef quesadilla- received only cheese. My burrito was fine but I also asked for street corn that I didn't receive. Called and they granted us a replacement order. Tonight I went to pick up the replacement order and Mae was awesome! She happily replaced our orders with no problem."}
{"text":"The food is good but it's a little pricey considering how many other places you can get similar food for less. I had the Dominican nachos. They use fried yuca instead of tortilla chips, which is a neat idea, but the ratio seemed off. There were like 4 pieces of yuca in the entire dish. Overall, it's decent but I don't know if we'll be hurrying back."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of Mexican food, but now after having ordered food from here, I think I can change that mindset. Not just that, I loveeeeee their food. It's simply delicious. Especially their tacos. I can live my entire life on their tacos probably! Portion sizes are big and worth the price paying for. Their vegetarian options are great too compared to other franchise Mexican restaurants. If you're vegetarian and need yummy Mexican, sabor is the place to go! Just wish their place is a little more bigger."}
{"text":"Friendly service, clean restaurant, food was delicious. Love their chips and variety of salsa."}
{"text":"It's hard to find authentic ethnic food in Charlotte. I take that back--it's hard to find authentic ethnic  food in Charlotte that's delicious. 

Sabor Latin Grille is the exception. We found this place by just taking a jog down South Tryon, and decided to pop in to give it a try and I'm glad that we did. The food here is delicious, well priced, and the owner is very friendly. 

We had a chicken Arepas, the elote, grilled chicken taco, chorizo empanada (it was huge), shredded chicken taco, side of Guac and cheese dip. Everything was delicious, but the cheese dip was the star of the show. It's better than anything that you can get from any of the local Mexican places around here (forget Don Pedro!).

There is a $1 taco special on Tuesday, but the line was to the door yesterday evening. Better believe that we will be back.... Many times."}
{"text":"We are proud to have another hot spot in the Steele Creek area. We've eaten at the Sabor in Elizabeth before. The food is good, but when we visited they had no \"Grown up\" drinks as of yet.
Celiacs beware.
We got our food to go and unfortunately my wife was contaminated. This is the second time we've eaten at Sabor and she was contaminated the first time as well. She ordered the Arepa, and also the French fries with carne asada. I don't see where in those two dishes wheat should be added, But she was pretty sick. On a positive note, the food was good. It just took a really long time to be made."}
{"text":"Great place, check it out if your tired of the same old food. Support your love cals so they can stick around"}
{"text":"Amazing. Thank you Sabor for finding a location closer to South Carolina. We loved everything we ordered which was the authentico tacos, carne asade fries and shredded chicken nachos. Everything tasted amazing and the portions for the nachos was wayyy too much but talk about visual simulation. lol

We can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"We've eaten here quite a few times but I decided recently to inquire about catering something that they don't normally do. Because it was for a manageable amount of folks and I gave them more than a week's notice they graciously accommodated me!!! The food, as always, was great!!! My guests LOVED everything as I knew they would :) They all requested \"to go\" plates lol I really appreciate Mae(Asst Mgr) & Justin(Gen. Mgr)!!! Thanks for helping my function be a success! Ya'll rock!!!"}
{"text":"First time at this location...the food is delicious. We had an Arepa, the supreme nachos (which are about the side of a small mountain), and a shrimp quesadilla- everything was wonderful.  The chips and quest are also great.  The food comes quickly and would be super easy to take out if you don't want to eat there."}
{"text":"Was very excited for Sabor as we travel to Hawthorne location normally.  Twice we ordered to go and twice food was cold, burrito has 2 pieces of shrimp (not kidding) and 2 pieces of chicken.  Asked and paid for extra queso and there was none both times.  Only giving it 2 stars because the guy at the counter is welcoming and friendly."}
{"text":"Food is just good its just really over priced. I could never justify paying $4 for 1 empanada lol. But the staff is nice. Restaurant is clean. And I believe they have daily specials which is cool"}
{"text":"Love this place. So glad they opened a location in the Steele Creek area. Great food and friendly service."}
{"text":"Sadly, there hasn't been a drastic improvement but there have been some. Here goes: 
1) TV menu screens in place 
2) Yelp check in offer 
3) outlets with USB's

Why update? 
Went in for taco Tuesday, March 14th between 2:50-3p to pick up my order that was called in 8 minutes beforehand. RETURNED to the office 6 minutes away via GPS and the tacos are tepid to ice cold. 

Beef taco tepid. 
Other beef taco =cold. 
Chicken tacos are all ice cold. 
Colleague said just microwave them. I decided then let me follow up with the owner that reached out. This isn't a Yelp issue this is matter that has to get corrected before it tarnishes the entire brand. 

That day I said I just won't go back but it is literally up the street and I'm going to make it a priority to text and call today."}
{"text":"I had a horrific meal there.  We ordered our food and went and sat with my partner close to the salsa bar..It was about 7pm.  The sales bar was so messy we were scared to get any.  Later that night both of us were sick as a dog.. please clean it. I think no one keeps it stocked with fresh.  I think the salsa got us sick...

Clean and keep it fresh..."}
{"text":"Some of the best authentic Mexican food you can eat.  Neat place to meet for lunch but extremely busy so go early"}
{"text":"Visited the restaurant on 5/2 for lunch.  I actually ordered on-line which turned out to be a really great idea.  When I arrived the restaurant was full and had a long line.  I am assuming because of the combination of lunch time and Taco Tuesday (tacos are $1.00).  My order was ready when I arrived so I did not have to wait.  I was very happy with my order.  I ordered the Epic Protein Bowl with shredded chicken and I added shredded cheese and guacamole. It was very tasty and very filling.  It was a large portion of food. I ate half for lunch and had the other half for dinner. The only thing I would do differently next time is to either get it without black beans or at least less.  There were plenty of black beans in the dish.  I do like black beans okay but less would have suited my taste better.  Not in any way saying they were bad just a personal opinion that I would have liked to have less.  On the next visit, I will make that request.  So as you see I will be visiting again especially for lunch because it is close by and the food is tasty.  The staff working there were very friendly despite how busy they were."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. You have to try the street corn. The nachos were so filling and everything was so fresh. The queso and chips were great as well I will definitely  be returning"}
{"text":"So disappointed. I had high hopes for this place. Since it was my first time there.  I wanted to try a couple of things...'street tacos', empanda, and the Burrito Especial, also had the cheese dip. For starters the tacos were not 'street' tacos. Im not sure about you but my tacos dont come with flour tortilla or mozzarella cheese on them. But thats not the worse part. The grilled steak on the tacos was horrible. No flavor and on top of that the meat was cold. The burrito also had grilled steak. I took 2 bites and threw it away. The beef empanda and the cheese dip was the only okay thing I had. I spent 30 bucks and I would never go back to that place again. Also the cashier and 'cook' notice I didnt eat the food and didnt even ask what was wrong. Bad service. Bad food."}
{"text":"Phenomenal tacos and elote! Highly recommended: Al pastor in the Auténtico taco, barbacoa in the Loco taco and the elote loco (corn on the cob)"}
{"text":"Great Arepas. I go at least once a month. Very fast service and the staff is very friendly. If you don't know what some of the food available is often they will have someone who can tell you about the food and can actually tell you a bit about where it's from and some history behind it. Lunch time and dinner time gets very hectic but still very much worth it."}
{"text":"Deeeelish!! I'm there faithfully for Taco Tuesdays! The Steak and Shredded Chicken Authentico tacos are the best! The meat is seasoned so well. Ask for a side of their pico, it really sets the taco off."}
{"text":"Grabbed some lunch and ordered the chicken Arepa. Yummy, chicken breast meat and cheese, onions in a tasty maize type bread like a gordita. Some good sauce in too but I recommend adding some pico de gallo. Get the combo with tortilla chips and fountain drink for about $3 more. I ordered small queso and pico which were both very fresh and delicious. The pico should be part of the complimentary salsa bar but it isn't so you need to order it. Hubby custom made a rice bowl with grilled chicken, black beans, jalapeños and Mexican rice. It was so good but I would've added sour cream to make even better. This place is fairly fast and very affordable. Plus, it is yummy and seems healthy so go get you some!"}
{"text":"Upon walking into this location I had no idea that taco tragedy was imminent. My boyfriend ordered two fish tacos and an empanada and I ordered the taco salad. I was so hung up on all the questions on what goes in the highly customizable taco salad that I totally forgot to order chips and guacamole. I will have to try them at a later visit. Though I didn't try the chips I would say this is a great location for them since they have a salsa bar! While we waited for our food I investigated the salsa bar and brought a couple samples back figuring I could chip away at my taco salad shell and it would basically be the same as chips.

Our food didn't take very long and when we went to grab it tragedy struck. The food is served on large round metal trays and my boyfriend leaned over to put my taco salad down and the taco salad kept going. All the way to stick a face down landing on the booth seat. Tragedy for such a young taco salad to die untasted.

Upon hearing of our misfortune the girl at the counter found the order and had the cooks remake it for free. It was ready in less time than it took me to split my boyfriend's empanada with him. I was so impressed not only that they refused to let us pay for a replacement but also the speed at which the replacement was provided.

The empanada was delicious, the steak in the taco salad well-seasoned though overall the taco salad could have used a little more flavor. However that could be intentional because I customized the taste by adding my selections from the salsa bar. Taco shell bits worked well as chip substitutes and we both left completely stuffed. 

We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So I've made a couple more visits and have discovered their pico de gallo...  OMG!  It's what pico de gallo should be!  Fresh, tasty diced tomatoes and onions with cilantro.  It might have some additional spices in there - I'm really not sure because we eat it so quickly that nobody has a chance to really inspect it - LOL!!  This stuff is so good that I've started having my fella swing by on his way home to grab a large Pico and some chips just to munch on as an afternoon snack  :-)  I live close by, I wonder if I could build some sort of funnel device straight into my kitchen?  LOL  Thanks Sabor - Steel Creek!!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best! We noticed in the Steele Creek area by us there's no chipotle but with Sabor there's absolutely no reason for chipotle. Sabor is absolutely amazing! I love the quinoa and brown rice option, vegetarian options and the empanadas are TO DIE FOR! It's enough for two meals for me when I get the build your own bowl. My som actually prefers it over chipotle and so do I. Tastes much more authentic!"}
{"text":"WOW!!! Really good food and awesome service. Great beer selection. Definitely a favorite from now on....."}
{"text":"A+ : corn, plantain, salsa bar, tacos
B: burrito
Would return. Cashier was super friendly and informative. Can't wait to try something new"}
{"text":"First trying out this Latin grill I loved it. I have some friends who became vegan an this place has Tofu ranchero burrito I was excited finally a place we can both eat. Their burritos are huge an we saw people ordering it was like fried corn I gotta back an try it. I had the shredded chicken burrito it was so good an it had cooked cabbage in it yum. All their ingredients are fresh. My friends said they'd go back an try another dish . It's a hole in the wall but those are the best places ."}
{"text":"The only thing I don't like about this location is they sometimes close before 9 pm. This makes me really sad."}
{"text":"Management is great, I'm always personally greeted. The food is authentic and delicious every time."}
{"text":"Everything my family of four got was incredible. Empanadas, tacos autenticos, carne asada fries. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Ordered Super Bowl snacks! Excellent queso, refried beans, salsa a warm chips.  The snacks were tasty and the staff was a pleasant.  I will return!"}
{"text":"Excellent! Making a good first  impression is key to a good overall experience. I'd been looking for a place with good tacos on my side of town and this will now  be my new taco-go to! The menu has a solid selection to choose from. I had the fish tacos on flour tortillas, great choice! The 3 Amigos Burrito is also delicious. ITS ATOMIC! I received a free side order of chips just for checking in on Yelp! The location offers a varied selection of sauces for chips and for addition to your entree.  Very good food. If \"Sabor\" translates into \"flavor\" then this restaurant is aptly named!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended to us for their delicious empandas, which were fabulous by the way. The tacos were delicious as well. The service was ok but the food was the best part."}
{"text":"Visited the restaurant on 2/1 at lunch time. The restaurant was 10% full with only 2-3 other customers in the building. I noticed that there was only one employee in the restaurant and wondered how he'd be able to handle the phone, register, customer's and cooking. I thought there was no way he could be by himself at lunch. I assumed help was on the way or somewhere in the back. It took 20 minutes to put my order in as the employee was taking orders over the phone, and cooking them immediately afterwards. When I ordered he was overwhelmed and wasn't polite. I asked for a margarita and a burrito and my brother ordered the same. 

The burrito took 20 more minutes to make it to us. The burrito had zero meat! I'm assuming in his rush he forgot to add it. While he was cooking I could see him dropping several things and was cursing out loud. 

The standard set by other locations is already pretty high. I was critical of the other Sabor on Hawthorne but they got their act together and have become a favorite spot of mine. 

The margarita showed up way toooo strong. No salt or sugar on the rim. I had to water it down several times. The total bill was $36.... this isn't a cheap lunch for 2. 

Was disappointed in the entire experience and being a Steele creek native it's easy to see why many restaurants fail there. 

Terrible."}
{"text":"Incredible gentleman greeted us. He made the experience enjoyable just by his personality. Wish I knew his name to give him credit... short grey/white hair if that helps! :)
The food was amazing! Beats out Chipotle and Qdoba any day. Also, there is a great salsa bar and free chips! On Fridays they offer $4 margaritas! Lovely experience."}
{"text":"I finally tried this place last week and could not believe what I had been missing.  This is a little jewel!  All of their menu looks very tasty but I chose the Carne Asada Fries and was not disapointed.  Their guac is very good and I often can tell a quality of a latin place based on their guac.  To be a little eatery they also serve both bottled beer/malt beverages and mixed drinks.  It was a Thursday and mojitos were on special.  

Definately return trip and I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"2 tests: Strong good drinks, fresh tasty food. Sabor passed both! What a great little place! My husband and I take a lot of trips to Mexico and the Caribbean so love the chill street food atmosphere. Only wish there were some outside seating so we could hang out all day. Will totally return"}
{"text":"Awesome Burritos!  We got the shrimp burritos and they were amazing.  The chicken empanadas are some of the best I've tasted....next time it won't be just one.  Chips & Salsa are great for sharing along with your food.  And those churros are JUST WOW, we ate them first before our dinner!  The service was outstanding as well.  We LOVE this place, glad we stopped by."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and I've been back two times. I'm still waiting to be blown away like the other reviewers. Maybe I'm getting the wrong stuff. I've gotten a taco salad with barbacoa beef and I wasn't impressed. Meat was stringy. Another time I got Gordita with pork and they ask what kind of beans and I ordered black. I thought they come on the side, but they put them inside. That was annoying. Once again, the Al Pastor pork was on the dry side.
But the churros, omg the churros were delicious I! I didn't know they were filled with anything until I bit into it. They were crispy and warm with cinnamon sugar and what I believe to be dolce de Leche. Food is cheap and good, not great.  Order half hour ahead of time, because they get packed!"}
{"text":"This place doesn't look like much but their food is excellent and the portions are generous. You can tell it is fresh and it is cooked on the spot."}
{"text":"I tried it recently for lunch and it was amazing.  The girl who answered the phone when I called in my order was a little short.  When I got there the man who took my money was very polite and the wait for the food wasn't too long.  I ordered nachos with grilled chicken and they were amazing!! The price was also very reasonable. It's a small dining area but the food is good and service good as well.  Try it"}
{"text":"I love love love Sabor's food! Every time I order, no matter the location, it's fresh and timely. This time I ordered their trademark chicken burrito. I'm picky about what's on my food, and they ever so patiently took my order and customized it until it was exactly what I wanted.

The only downside I've found about all of the locations is the lack of seating. During the lunch rush the line was out the door, and all of the seats were full. In addition, their biggest tables probably only hold four people. It's not really a place I'd take a group to sit down and hang out because of that."}
{"text":"I love Sabor. I've been here quite a few times now and I've never had anything bad. 

My favorite thing I've had so far is the Sabor Especial burrito. It's huge so you can definitely get two meals out of it. Their fried plantains are also amazing. Very sweet and delicious. I've also had their nachos, carne asada fries, and the quinoa avocado bowl. All of them are delicious. The nachos are served on a serving tray and are enough to feed at least three people. 

The food is cheap for the amount you get and the quality. They also have a salsa bar that is complementary which is pretty nice. The downside is that you have to pay for chips. 

If you're looking for some amazing, cheap Latin American food, this is your place!"}
{"text":"Authentico tacos are awesome! I had grilled steak on them. I also ordered the guacamole and queso. So the guac is bomb digity! The queso was very runny. It could have been because it was close to closing, not sure, but still delicious. Seasoned chips are delicious too!"}
{"text":"Nice people, delicious food.  I got chips and queso and the loaded nachos.  Love the pineapple salsa .  Beautiful presentation"}
{"text":"First time and tried the empanadas and arepas.  Yum!  Great flavor and value.  Will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times. I wanted to give the place a fair shot before I completely dismissed it. The food is inconsistent. The first time we ate there, the empanadas were cold. We were told they were still training new cooks. The other time I ate there was fine... However, we ate there again and we were served the wrong taco and the wrong burrito. Another time,  there was a giant bay leaf (inedible) inside my burrito. The final time I ate there, they did not include cheese in the burrito AND the rice was crunchy. 

They really need to get their act together and work on CONSISTENCY. Cook the food, keep it fresh, pay attention to what you're doing in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Excellent Latin street food. Is it authentic? I really don't care. Is it tasty and delicious? That I care about and it absolutely is.

I went with three tacos - one chicken, one carne asada and the third al pastor. They took a few minutes to be prepared and then it was time to dig in. Nice \"autenticos\" plating with chopped onions and chopped cilantro. Everything tasted super fresh. The beef was nice and rich tasting, the pork and chicken had a nice roasted flavor.

Be really careful with the salsa bar. It goes from very warm at the left to insane at the right. I am not kidding."}
{"text":"Good food great atmosphere. Food came out fast was very fresh. $15 for everything and drink. Coworkers and myself came for lunch"}
{"text":"YUM YUM to the Tum Tum and I don't think I will need tum ta tum tum tums. 

The 1st bite of that empanada I spoke out loud. It wasn't clear English but you would understand the language if you took that bite too. AUTHENTIC Latin food my yelp mates. 

You don't understand how difficult it is to find a variety of great food if you have never driven a vehicle over 13 feet tall with a 53' trailer tagging along. I just can't drive anywhere. So once again delivery saves the pallet and today it was once again from UberEats. Thank you for your service. 

The (beef) taco was soft and savory. The flavors mesh so well in the perfectly cooked (not hard, not dry) (shredded chicken w/ cheese) empanada, the churro was not too sweet and had a filling of caramel- just so good. City of Charlotte you are great."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Charlotte!  This place gets packed around lunch on and Taco Tuesdays.  Get the carne asada.  They also have great plaintains and always have some local beers on rotation.  If you get there and there's a line don't be scared away. Even when they're busy they can pump out tacos, queso, and guacamole quickly.   They also have a salsa bar ranging from mild to hot.  Always a great choice for tacos!"}
{"text":"Mouthwatering deliciousness!

This place is wonderful, especially on Tuesdays!! On Taco-Tuesdays all tacos are $1 - no joke. Get the chips (which are specially seasoned) and the guacamole!! So Great!! Service is quick and friendly too! 

Best tip about this place: They have a salsa bar for you to choose which you'd like or mix them yourself."}
{"text":"I think I dream about writing Yelp reviews, and then fail to write them. Yelp says I visited here and didn't write a review, but I swear I did! I've read a lot of good reviews about Sabor in other parts of the city, so when they opened in Steele Creek area I had to visit. They gave a wide selection of Mexican food. I had a couple of their Tacos which were very good. The chips and cheese dip also good. One of the best things is the Salsa bar which has a bunch of unique Salsa's you can try. They have a small selection of beer, and they have Margeritas!. I didn't try those as I was eating lunch here with my daughters, but its a nice touch. Overall, the food was pretty good, and I've been here 3 times already, so it must be a decent place! Fast casual Mexican, you aren't likely to beat this in the area."}
{"text":"I love the location on Hawthorne, so of course I couldn't wait for lunch once I found out there was a location close to me on S. Tryon. 

From the time I walked in, I was greeted by the cashier. He was super sweet and helpful when I became indecisive about what I wanted for lunch (I was good with Elote Locos and drink... but apparently protein is important). It took all of 7 minutes for me to receive my order and be out the door during lunch, which in my book is an epic win! 

They offer weekly specials, but can be missed if you're only looking straight ahead at the menu or may not have checked their website beforehand. Having a small reminder for customers to look to their left for specials is the only small suggestion, that I would have. 

Nonetheless, this place will see me a lot more often!"}
{"text":"I have been here once with my daughter and today for lunch. I haven't tried anything else but the quinoa advocado bowl which is so yummy. I always order the kids size and it is more than enough. I could not imagine what the adult size would be.The flavors are great and still feel good eating it. I am glad we have a new place in the area."}
{"text":"We stopped in on Saturday night, not knowing what to expect from the tiny spot in a strip center.  Chad introduced himself at the counter and in a very friendly manner explained what they were all about.  We chose the chicken arepa and a burrito.  Both were very fresh and flavorful.  The salsa bar had some interesting selections, like Pineapple Habenero...spicy!!  Canned beer and mixed drinks are reasonably priced.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"My first time here. The server was patient and friendly even though it took me a short while to figure out what items to try first. I got a steak quesadilla for my daughter, and two shrimp tacos plus an arepa for myself.

We took our order to go, and it smelled so good it was difficult not to open the bag and sneak a bite (which she did) on the way home. I was happy with the tacos- it wouldn't topple Paco's tacos to me, but I enjoyed every morsel. My daughter enjoyed her steak with extra meat.

What stood out to me? Definitely the arepa. After eating both tacos, I couldn't finish it until later but it was delicious. I gave my daughter a bite and she ran off with it. Next trip I'll get an arepa plus something else on the menu.

Great job Sabor."}
