{"text":"I love the outdoor seating here and the atmosphere is really relaxing. The duck taco is delicious, mostly sweet with some spice. The shrimp bun was very good as well. I never thought about a shrimp patty and may try it at home! Great choice all around. The food portions were just enough. Oh, and the hurricane punch (half of the proceeds go to victims of the recent hurricanes) was very delicious as well. Nate was my server and he is pretty awesome with lots of energy!"}
{"text":"Sea Level is one of my favorite new restaurants in Charlotte. I've been in a couple of times with my boyfriend and so far we've tried the shrimp po-boy, catfish reuben, lobster roll, and $1 Sea level oysters. Everything was delicious, but the catfish reuben was the real stand out dish. The sandwiches all come with french fries, which are really tasty. The lobster roll could use a little more butter drizzled on top, but that's my only critique of the food so far.   What I really love about Sea Level is that it seems to strike a great balance of semi-fine dining, while also being casual, if that's what your mood is. To that end, there's a big patio, and a good bit of bar seating, so even on a busy weekend evening, you may be able to be seated without a reservation at one of the aforementioned locations. Additionally, the service is fabulous. The servers are very professional - They know their stuff and they ensure patrons have a great dining experience. Finally, I love that there are cheaper options (i.e. $2 beer, $5 house wines, ~$12 sandwiches, and $1 oysters), and there are plenty of high quality, more expensive options as well. You really can achieve whatever dining experience you are looking for at Sea Level, whether is be a nice date, casual happy hour drinks and oysters, or somewhere in between!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I'm certainly going back! We got the paella with fresh shrimp, fish, mussels, lobster tail - so delicious. Also, the waiters and other staff are so polite which is refreshing."}
{"text":"I LOVE Sea Level!  Every experience I have had at this restaurant has been exceptional, and any time something has gone wrong the wait staff and management has gone out of their way to rectify the situation and make up for it.  Ask for Chris- he knows his shit!"}
{"text":"I am not a huge seafood fan since shellfish makes me queezy. However, my date loves it. So we went and I was not disappointed. The vibe is very nice and the restaurant itself is a good size. I had the corn fritters as an appetizer. They were extremely good with the spicy dipping sauce. I also had the chicken which came with greens in a demi glaze...fantastic! I also had the parmesan potato cakes. Another great hit. My date had a shrimp po boy and she liked it as well. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The best clam chowder hands down. Ariel was an amazing waitress. Costumer service top notch. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"We came to Charlotte for a concert and stopped here for some pre-concert food and drinks. The food was great and the service was awesome! GA and Joe made us feel at home and they kept us laughing too. The next time we come back to Charlotte, we will definitely make a point to stop here again."}
{"text":"A great meal and experience for the 8 of us.  Cocktails are wonderful... especially the Spanish G&T.  Oysters are really nice.  Second time we had the Shrimp and Grits and they are delicious, particularly the chorizo gravy. The Wreckfish lobster gnocci was perfect.  The addition of the pickled julianne vegetables made sure that the dish was not too rich.  The key lime ice cream sandwich was awesome and I've been thinking about it all day."}
{"text":"Good food, especially the fried oyster salad, Good decor, outstanding service. A lively vibe but noisy.   ]"}
{"text":"Have been to Sea Level several times and enjoyed it.  The food is great (especially the oysters) and the service is excellent.  On this occasion, we went during Queen's Feast and ordered off the Queen's Feast menu.  My husband had the oyster appetizer and I ordered the ceviche.  The oysters were unusually small and the ceviche was disappointing.  For entrees, he had the catfish served on a bed of creamed corn polenta that he said was good and I had the short rib with summer squash.  The tarragon sauce served with the vegetables was surprisingly delicious because I didn't think I'd like tarragon and the short rib was, as usual, tenderorni and excellent.  For the dessert, we both had the bourbon chocolate pound cake which was ok.  The reason for four stars is more about the Queen's Feast menu than the restaurant.  Yes, you get to sample some of the quality menu items at a reduced price ($35 each). But the servings are just \"samples\" or what my husband calls \"Froo-Froo\" (i.e. pretty on the plate but less than filling).  Ok for me, but I'm a small eater.  As always, the service was excellent, but next time, we'll order from the regular menu.  It might even cost a little more for him, less for me so it will average out.  But, he won't have to eat again when we get back home."}
{"text":"Always welcomed at Sea Level. If they are available, I start with the Sea Level raised Raw Oysters (I usually dine late and the popularity of the Oysters means early sellout). I've never tasted tempura shrimp as unique and delicious as theirs combined with a Napa valley wine, my evening is complete."}
{"text":"What's the point of a reservation? Not impressed with the service at all. In fact, the lack of service compelled me to sign up for Yelp to leave a review.  We checked in at 7:30pm for an 8pm reservation and still were not seated by 9pm, although they did try to seat our party of four at a table for two at 8:45pm. It would have been nice if they told us our reservation would not be honored when we checked in. And the response? \"The whole restaurant is an hour behind.\" Not an apology. Felt like I was in an episode of Seinfeld. Again, what's the point of a reservation?"}
{"text":"We had a great lunch.  I loved that I could pick a few small plates/ sides so I could try different things.  Everything was delicious, especially the New England clam chowder.  We sat outside where we enjoyed the nice weather and the great service."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Highly educated staff on the wines and spirits they offer. Seems like an after work hang out. We had a variety of entrées, all very good. Don't think I've ever had better calamari. The star of the show as we expected was the oysters, highly recommend them."}
{"text":"I dined here before going to a concert and found the service to be wonderful.  The staff was very attentive and made sure that our food was served at a pace to enjoy the experience and meet our performance timelines.   The food was tasty.  I tried the pan seared fresh catch and my guest had the catfish (which I thought was a bit bland but had a good batter).  We also had the corn fritters and loved them. The oysters were fresh and very good.  Overall, a very positive experience and I look forward to returning to try the lobster roll that I heard was delicious."}
{"text":"So this is our first time to this restaurant. Great atmosphere here, love the music.  Very clean and welcoming vibe for the place.  Crystal was our server, and she could not of been more accommodating. We were questioning what we want to have with our brunch, and she brought three different samples to help us select the best.  We decided to order the seafood tower to your level two. It was awesome. Oysters were so sweet and fresh and have that brine flavor to them. The fresh made cocktail sauce really was a highlight, and the shrimp were exceptionally flavorful. One of the things that surprise this was how delicious the clams and mussels work too. It really was a showstopper.    We then decided to have the crabcake Benedict.  OK, I'm not one to gush but I'm gushing over this. The fresh grab Jake, combined with the fresh made holidays which you never find in a restaurant, and with the succotash was a unique and extremely delicious dish.   Geoffrey was one of the servers that was extremely accommodating, and interacting with their table in a very sincere and heartfelt manner.  Great  training and attitude from the entire staff.   This was so great, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Had the restaurant week menu. I had the ceviche and my wife had the oysters for starters. Both were very good. For main course we had shrimp and grits and the catch of the day. Fish was well cooked with a crispy skin. The grits were excellent, creamy and not lumpy or runny. Chorizo gravy on top is a nice accompaniment. All in all an excellent meal, especially for restaurant week, which some restaurants skimp on."}
{"text":"We ate at Sea Level on a Saturday night around 6:00 pm, before a symphony concert. It was much too loud and made the meal very unpleasant. The food was mixed. I had clam chowder to start and salmon main course. Both were very good. My wife had fritters to start and soft-shell crabs, her favorite. The fritters were good but the crabs were too breaded and much too dry. She asked for a sauce to give them some moisture and they brought tarter sauce, inappropriate for this dish.  We will not return."}
{"text":"Incredible. Growing up in Wilmington, I'm used to amazing seafood, but this takes the cake. The grouper is hands down the best grouper I've ever had! I've also been a server for over a decade and the service was immaculate-Christopher was his name. Definitely recommend him-and go with what he suggests! He really knows his stuff. The oysters were on special til 7 (which was when our reservation was) but he gave us the special anyway! Also in lieu of dessert I wanted a martini and the bartender even came to the table to make sure I got what I wanted. I'm super impressed and will definitely be back. Best birthday dinner I've had in years. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch yesterday and had really high hopes.  I work in the Heart Tower so was excited to finally try it.  I ordered the fried oyster taco and a salad with shrimp on it.  The highlight was definitely the taco, which was crispy and fresh and very good.  Next time I'll probably just order two tacos.  The salad was nothing to write home about except for the croutons (they almost tasted like cornbread) and the apple cider vinaigrette.  Otherwise, paying like $7 for a salad and then an additional $6 to add about 4 smaller-sized shrimp did not seem worth it to me.  Would potentially try this for dinner, but probably only if I'm craving oysters.  I'm hoping at some point soon they'll just have fresh fish on their menu that you can order for a healthy lunchtime meal (it's so hard to find a good warm lean protein/veggies meal uptown when you're sick of salads all the time).  So, bottom line: order two fried oyster tacos for a real lunchtime treat."}
{"text":"Yummy food, great service and fantastic vibe. What a fun surprise! Ordered a bunch of fun plates and they were all a hit."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for dinner last night, and the entire experience was amazing.  Tyler, our server, offered outstanding recommendations from the oysters all the way to the dessert.  I love that this restaurant has such a focus on locally-sourced seafood.  Everything we ate was delicious.  We started with an oyster sampler, moved on to clam chowder (best I've ever had--tons of clams inside), I had the NC striped bass and my husband had the lobster roll, and we finished with a s'mores shooter.  Thanks for the great service, Tyler.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"No wait, we showed up for our reservation and were seated right away. It was tough to decide on my meal, trout and catfish are two of my favorites. The grits are cooked perfectly! I can't wait to go back..."}
{"text":"Amazing oysters, loved the duck taco, and our server Woods was awesome. Will be going back and taking more friends."}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times and it has mainly been for their oysters although I've had just about every one of their appetizers. All were above average except for the shrimp and grits. I wouldn't order that again.  Looks good but let's your mouth down. I'd go to Redeye Diner (who would've thought a diner would have great shrimp and grits) or Peculiar Rabbit for that. But let me get to the main reason for my review...their oysters!  BEST IVE EVER HAD!  ALWAYS fresh and a great selection that changes so you'll be able to keep going back and trying different ones. They always have the sea level oysters and those are pretty decent. If you're looking for raw oysters, this is the place. They are not cheap ($3-$4 each) but you are paying for quality and it's worth it."}
{"text":"Great food and service! Our server, Stephanie, was superb and was so pleasant and knowledgeable! She helped make a birthday celebration special!  Amazing selection of oysters and everything we ordered was delicious!"}
{"text":"First time here and had a great experience! I had made my reservation for the wrong date and the hostess could not have been nicer! She spoke to the manager and on a packed Saturday night got us a great table in minutes! Our waiter Nate was awesome as well! Food was fantastic! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Definitely a cool spot, great looking space. It's almost too trendy to the point of annoying, however. Sat at the bar, service was great. Had 6 oysters, which were a little pricey in my opinion- especially for the NC varieties. They were extremely fresh and delicious though. Cocktails were very good as well, but also pricey. It seems $14 cocktails are the norm these days, even if you're not in Manhattan. Had the shrimp bun and the oyster bun, both of which were outstanding. I will be back to try some more of the interesting looking menu for sure."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came to Sea Level for their restaurant week.  The food was indeed delicious.   Although we wish there were more portions, with both of us having kitchen/cooking backgrounds (for Restaurant week as well), we totally understood.  Oysters were really delicious, hopefully we can come back soon for happy hour."}
{"text":"Sea Level is a place to come back to again and again. We had not been here for months and found it just as great as the last time. From oysters to the pork belly bun sandwich we were so very happy. Felt like a special coming home!"}
{"text":"So a few of my coworkers came here last week for dinner and highly recommended it. I have to say after last night i would also recommend to people. I had a filet and others had the Trout and Salmon. All dinners were enjoyed.  We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"We stopped in around 6pm before a hornets game and was able to snag a seat at the bar. They have $1 house oysters from 4-7. We took advantage and got 12 sea level oysters. Although they were on the small side they were incredibly fresh with just enough salt to satisfy. Woods was our bartender and was incredibly personable and knowledgable. He made us their vodka infused oyster shooter and it had to be one of the best we've had. Hints of pickle juice and a subtle smokiness and heat in the back end. Highly recommend. Have woods make you a drink and take advantage of the happy hour oysters. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, fast and friendly service and excellent oysters. Had the Cesar salad with grilled shrimp and Bluepoint oysters (recommend by the server) . . . Excellent suggestion!  If you haven't tried this place in uptown Charlotte, you're missing out."}
{"text":"Sea level is a very popular post work/ hour establishment uptown. Rush hour traffic may make it difficult to park in the Hearst Tower if you are not already uptown. The favorites as our super waiter, Tyler, told myself and my guest were the lobster roll and catfish reuben which were delicious and definitely flavorful. The fries were too crispy for my liking so we replaced those with the corn fritters and were more than satisfied! The signature cocktails are the main event so I would recommend anyone to stop there for drinks. Overall, a great place to socialize with a great (but pricier) menu."}
{"text":"I had an absolute wonderful meal before going to see \"The King and I\"  I would definitely recommend giving this restaurant a try:)"}
{"text":"The food and service were excellent.  Oysters were outstanding.  Highly recommend for a wonderful evening!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love seafood so we have been eager to go.  We finally made it, we were pleasantly surprised with convenient free parking in Hearst Tower when validated by your server.  Ambience was above average, nice seating,we sat in a nice large booth.   We went on a Monday so it wasn't crowded, but noise level was still high.  Amanda was very helpful and knowledgeable about menu choices.  We ordered half a dozen variety of oysters  Which were small but very good. A Bloody Mary oyster shot was good too!   My wife ordered seafood paella which had swordfish and she loved it, I had the NC Snapper dish which had pasta, chorizo sausage, goat cheese and it was out of this world.   A fun cocktail and a local craft beer for me and we were extremely pleased, we will go back as soon as we can."}
{"text":"Our evening here was good but not great. Service was slow, two drinks weren't right and the food was very good, but not great. I ordered something I never ordered....felt like having a lobster roll. It was good, but nothing to brag about. Kind of lacked some flavor. Others at our table thought their food was, again, good, but not great. I like the decor."}
{"text":"The food deserves a 5 star. The reason for the 4 star review was the wait. I ordered the oyster taco (which is one of the best things I've ever eaten) as an appetizer. It took more than 20 minutes for it to come out. The kitchen was backed up. The staff was gracious and it was comped so I appreciate that. I will definitely still go back. As I said, the food is amazing."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I ate at the bar, not a mistake, very helpful bartenders with food and drinks.  The sides as wells as the fresh fish were phenomenal, can't wait to get back next time I'm  in Town."}
{"text":"Server was pleasant. Aside from the noise the atmosphere was nice. My friend had the catfish Reuben and I had the fried catfish. The food was just okay (bland)."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! Love the food and service! Everything I've gotten here has never disappointed!"}
{"text":"A great place in uptown for seafood. Warm friendly and casual dining atmosphere, great waitstaff and don't miss the oysters..."}
{"text":"The food and service was excellent.  This was my third visit and it happened to be restaurant week.  The oysters were delicious.  I also had shrimp and grits as well as the ound cake for dessert.  The place was super busy but that didnt impact our services.  Definitely a great spot uptown."}
{"text":"We visited Sea Level NC Saturday night for a friend's birthday celebration. Our first issue was our table wasn't available until 15 minutes after our reservation time. When we inquired about the reason for this, the host immediately \"got an attitude\" and was very rude. They proceeded to sit us in an area where several of our members were cold, when we asked to be moved, again we were greeted with an attitude.   We were waiting for a few others in our party to arrive, so we inquired about shots. Our server couldn't accurately advise which liquor was in the various shots she recommended. There were a few in our party that wanted to order shots of 1800 tequila. They were disappointed to find the bar didn't have it in stock.  Our final complaint was our waitress was very slow. We had to wait 10 minutes to receive water, had to wait 5-10 minutes for her to appear after each of our additional party members arrived (the restaurant was half empty so there was no excuse for this), and 15 minutes for her to bring the check at the end. The food was just \"okay\" in my opinion (but I've lived in Houston, Maryland, and Louisiana and am used to \"great\" seafood so the lack of great customer service and a fully stocked bar, in addition to mediocre food, are the reasons I won't return nor recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience at Sea Level!  The tequila and oyster pairings were fun and delicious...definitely would recommend.  Some of the best oysters I've ever had.  Service was also on point."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic. First it is owned and operated by the same folks who do the Crepe Cellar (which is in my opinion, the best spot in Charlotte) so I knew I couldn't go wrong.  The food and drink selection was great. Even if you don't like Oysters or Sea Food they have a great burger and other entree's. Our waiter was very nice, attentive and willing to answer any questions.  The place was spacious with great availability of seating that allowed for good conversation and comfort Some places in Charlotte, although great, have awkward seating where it is not very conducive to having a conversation unless you want the couple right next to you hear everything. (the tiny two tops at Soul Gastrolounge is an example).  Overall, definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Lovely interior and very friendly service. Especially liked their extensive oyster selection. Their main menu contained some unusual entrees that proved quite tasty. Definitely try their corn fritter and parmesan potato side with your meal."}
{"text":"YUMMMMMM!!!  Get the oysters.  they are delicious.  Fantastic outside seating.  Great attentive servers.  Good beer choices.  love this place!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner before a game on New Years Eve.  We started with oysters and then salmon, which was perfect.  Also had a shrimp po boy and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Chris did a great job with service.  We look forward to going again."}
{"text":"Called a day before we needed a reservation on a busy Saturday (during Queens Feast) and they were able to fit us in with no problem. Selected Sea Level as it was across the street from the theatre where we were seeing a show later that evening. Awesome oyster selection. Try the ghost pepper pommarita....delish. Also you can park in the Hearst tower and the restaurant will validate your ticket."}
{"text":"Amazing menu and you can change the fried calamari to sautéed! Amazing! Our waiter Stephen rocked we will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"I am not a sea food eater but what I tried there was really excellent (Trout, steamed buns) and the corn fritters are a MUST. I was really impressed with interior as it feels high-end withough feeling stuffy.   The staff is worthy of recommendation as well. Every was very friendly and they really know their stuff.  The true stand out for me was the bar. Cocktails were incredibly creative and executed very well. Kudos to the mixologist and team.  The most important thing about this place is the hole it fills in uptown. Apart from a chain and sushi places theres no real seafood place in uptown. This brings new energy and life to 5th street."}
{"text":"Came out to Sea Level for happy hour oysters with a group of fellow Yelpers. Apparently Sea Level has two happy hours and we hit the later one. $1 oysters.....that's winning.   I ordered the Smoked Old Fashion. Absolutely delish. The smoke flavor was very prominent and made that drink something special.   Got a half dozen oysters. They were the Sea Level house oysters but I noticed they had lots of different types from various places. They came out on the half shell on ice with sauces. Delicious. Well sized. Exactly what oysters should be. Since my hubby doesn't eat oysters, I convinced him to order the clam chowder. Really I just wanted to try the clam chowder. Now, as a chowda afficionado, this chowder was delish! Would absolutely order this again. I also tried some of the corn fritters. Super tasty.  Not a lot of seafood places in the area, so I am so glad I got to check this place out!"}
{"text":"Delicious oysters and a deal at $1 during happy hour. Red snapper was also very good. Nice wine and enjoyed the vibe inside. Service was a little slow for our large group, but I think it'd be better for a smaller one. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I got the oyster taco and the NC Shrimp Grits! Yummmmm!!! The place is trendy but warm... excellent service, my bartender Andrew was awesome!!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place. I work in the building and have been watching its progress for months. I've waited a bit as I'm reluctant to try places when they first open so they could work out the kinks. My husband and I gave it a shot tonight.   We Ordered our drinks and the corn fritters and a bowl of the clam chowder to start. The corn fritters were just ok. They were a bit dry  but the aioli was delicious with a nice kick. The clam chowder was good but $9 for a small bowl is outrageous. It didn't even come with bread or crackers or anything.   For dinner I got the tile fish which was just ok. It wasn't cooked right and lacked flavor. My husband ordered the lobster roll which was again just ok and I thought dry and lacking flavor. I wouldn't go back for any of the items we had.   Another peeve was the waitress asked us if we wanted dessert while we were still eating. We politely declined and said not yet. Five minutes later she brought our check. We would have gotten another drink and possibly dessert after we were done eating our dinner but felt rushed out at that point and just decided to leave.   I think this place has great potential if it listens to the reviews and works out the service kinks."}
{"text":"Everything you've heard is true! $1 FRESH, Local Oysters on the half shell from 4-7pm.. The seafood was so delicious, the service was impeccable and how convenient to be in the heart of uptown, just short walk from the light rail! Our experience was extra pleasant due to the 80 degree weather that afternoon. My husband & I indulged in a seafood feast that we can't stop talking about: Happy hour oysters, Squid Chow Chow, Fried Oyster Tacos & dessert. A couple of our orders took longer than usual to arrive at our table and the servers noticed without us having to complain. They were so efficient that they comp'd those items for us before we could even think to feel disappointed. That earns them 5 stars in my book! Fantastic Customer service AND Delicious food! Can't recommend Sea Level enough"}
{"text":"In Charlotte for night staying outside of the city (Research Park area) and drove downtown to see the city.  Easy to find parking and we walked around looking at the many restaurants available, choosing to try Sea Level.  It was a Monday night and the place was fairly busy which was nice.  Everyone liked their food, everyone ordered from the sandwich menu.  I had the blackened catfish reuben that was good.  My son had a local brewed IPA which was very good.  We also had dessert which was very good.  Menu overall is seafood, but there are a couple of other options for non-seafood eaters.  Wait staff was very good.  Kept the water glasses full the entire time we were there. Would go back again."}
{"text":"WOW!  We had the NC Paella, sea level oysters and NC grits and shrimp. It was delicious, more than food it was a taste experience! Service was fantastic! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place has the BEST oysters in town-doesn't get much fresher than Sea Level.  I'm taking my husband's word for it since I don't eat oysters, but the happy hour specials are well worth it ($1 oysters!).  Wells can also make an amazing cocktail, so stop in and have some oysters and a cocktail on a Saturday before your next stop.  Totally worth it."}
{"text":"A group of my colleagues and I happened to be at Hearst Tower today and decided to try out Sea Level, a new restaurant located in the Hearst Tower that had just opened earlier this month.  On a Wednesday night, there were no reservations required as I think the restaurant is still fairly new and it's still pretty slow.  We were accommodated quickly.  I want to note that the service here, while a little bit slow, was great.  Our server was very friendly and there were always people asking us (a little too much sometimes) if we were done with our dish so they could clear it out.  Water was always full.  The GM also came over to chat and to make sure everything was alright, which we appreciated.  Prices are reasonable for seafood.  The food was a little lackluster... perhaps there are still a few kinks to sort out as this is such a new restaurant:  - No bread basket - you have to order it separately and it comes with a nice onion spread.  - Sea Level and Blue Point oysters - one of them, which I assume is the Sea Level, was itty bitty teeny tiny (I'm very small and have very small hands - see picture for scale) - literally smallest oyster I've ever seen.  However, both oysters were fresh (I haven't gotten sick!) and had a nice salty brine flavor.  Comes with all the condiments.  - Squid chow chow - we had no idea what a chow chow was and should have asked.  It's basically fried calamari tossed in peppers and onions in a sweet/spicy sauce.  It was really, really greasy and I felt like I was eating more batter than I was squid.  I had to spit out one that was all batter and no squid.  The flavors were good, though.  - Mussels - these were my favorite of the evening.  The sliced grilled baguettes went well with the butter/white wine/lemon sauce and the mussels were aplenty and fairly fresh.  I would recommend getting these!   - Lobster roll - unfortunately, both my coworker and I found lots of shell pieces in the lobster salad, which we both bit into.  My piece of shell was quite large and she had many little pieces in hers.  The GM was nice enough to comp both rolls, which was a nice gesture.  It's understandable that they might have some pieces of shell in them since they apparently get these really fresh and make their lobster salads on the spot, but it's still not an excuse - I've never had a shell problem with any lobster roll I've had.  The cole slaw had a nice pickled flavor to it, but I didn't eat much of it.  Overall, an okay place to have a dinner with colleagues as there is a lot of space and it's conveniently located in Hearst Tower, but I think there's still a few hiccups to remediate since it's so new."}
{"text":"Food and service was good but the hosts was horrible, very rude. I recommend the mussels they were very good but not the NoDa oysters"}
{"text":"Loved It! Ordered fried fish & oyster tacos & the oyster stew. Nice place for a night out. I am glad we finally have a fresh seafood place in uptown! I liked their craft cocktails. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorite go to spots! Especially for fresh oysters and their shrimp steam bun!!??  Oh my!   The 1st time I went there, my fiancé and I loved the ambiance. It's great for a date night or occasion dinner. Everyone was super sweet and accommodating when we asked for a booth rather than a table.   Being that it was our 1st time at the establishment, our server/bartender asked what type of drink characteristics we like and then suggested their take on a whisky sour. I kid you not, the drink was SLAMMIIIIIING! It was perfectly sour with a huge cube of frozen wine. which was the \"ice,\" in the middle. Yes please, every time.  We gorged on oysters and ordered the shrimp steam bun, duck tacos and fish tacos. All delicious. DO NOT skip the shrimp steam bun burger situation. You will thank me later .  Oh and my love set up a surprise bday party/proposal dinner for me, at this same location, a few weeks later. Holy WINNING!! The Sea Level staff was great that night as well. The seafood towers were beautiful and plentiful and my entire crew loved their food. What more can you ask for? Thanks SEA LEVEL TEAM for helping my King make that a magical night for me!!"}
{"text":"This place was so terrible. Leaving now, our order was wrong, all of the food came out cold, we told Our server and nothing was done to rectify it- no discount, no new food, no apology. Service was awful and food was worse. Don't go here"}
{"text":"Love this place. We've been here multiple times. The $1 happy hours are alone worth it. The catfish Rueben is delish, comforting, and great in a rainy night.   We will continue to return here. Great and knowledgeable service as well."}
{"text":"Amberjack was average... A little dry and fishy all at once. Side ingredients were way over seasoned.  Massive salt.  Strange presentation for this dish. Served on grilled watermelon, which was listed as an ingredient, but turned out to be the primary ingredient (much larger than the fish itself).  Turns out hot watermelon is not all that appetizing.   Nice place, good service, but can't give a high rating without the food backing it up."}
{"text":"Freaking awesome!!! Love the drinks and the food! Was hesitant to leave a review because I love being able to get a seat at this place but so, so, so GOOD!!!!"}
{"text":"Came for their monthly Oyster pairing for our anniversary. We waited about 5 minutes before they were ready to seat the group. Due to wanting a little intimacy, we opted for the booth for two. But we can still hear and see everything. The owner Paul welcomed us after we were seated.

{"text":"Great food, great oysters, great service, and great prices! Would HIGHLY recommend! Love the lunch pick2 and pick3 menu options as well!"}
{"text":"Went here back in Sept for my husbands birthday.  It was FANTASTIC! Awaiting our next date night to go again. I really enjoyed this place."}
{"text":"Initially we were enticed by the $1 oyster happy hour. We came to find only one type of oyster was proved as such. However, we were not disappointed. Attentive service, fresh seafood, nice atmosphere and plenty of food."}
{"text":"Good wholesome and filling meal at a good price.  I was here for work during the beginning of the CIAA tournaments and I met up with some frat for drinks and dinner.  After walking around down Charlotte (my fault) looking for the restaurant I finally found it.  Very nice spot on 5th with a great feel to it.  There's a nice bar and the ambiance to the place.  I sat down with the guys and joined in. All of their appetizers looked delicious.  I ordered a crown and coke and for my dinner I had shrimp and grits with a nice gravy on it. It came out quick and hot. Delicious meal! I'd definitely order it again along with the meals my frat brothers ordered as well.  The only thing that was bad was the service. Our service was too nice. I wish I had her name But she did too good a job making sure we had drinks and food in a timely fashion. I mean the nerve of her. All I know is if I remember to come back to ask for her.  This is a nice restaurant and it's someplace I'd come back to. Until next time..."}
{"text":"Had lunch here a few times and it never disappoints. Also attended Happy Hour and drink options were plentiful. A little expensive for every day so save it for a special occasion. Great place to entertain. Atmosphere is very upscale and warm. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went during Queens Feast and was also able to take advantage of some Happy Hour oysters. Food was great and so was the service. Only complaint was the noise level of the restaurant. It was packed but could hardly hear the waiter or person next to me much less someone on the other side of the table. Overall it was great!"}
{"text":"Lovely Discovery! We were traveling back from Florida, and happened upon this really nice seafood restaurant. Awesome shrimp and grits! My husband had the sword fish. Good mixed drinks, also. Plus, it was a lovely night, and we were able to sit out on the Terrace."}
{"text":"The restaurant is really nice on the inside and they also have outdoor seating. They validate parking from the Hearst tower. The staff was really friendly and enthusiastic about serving our group of 8. I was being really indecisive and decided to sample a few items. I got the white wine mussels, a side of corn fritters and one oyster taco. Everything was delicious. The aioli sauce on the taco really brought together the flavors. I literally had enough mussels to share with the table. The wine sauce had a light but tasty flavor. The corn fritters weren't what I was expecting because they were more like hush puppies but they were delicious, nonetheless. I will definitely return. Others in my party ordered drinks and seemed to really enjoy them so I will try them next time."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and ambiance was great.  We dined here for Queen's Feast and the food was amazing.  Service was also great.  Will definitely go back soon!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit and it was an awesome experience. It's was my first born 25th dinner. We enjoyed the happy hour menu and drinks. Only complaint is the sea level oysters were tiny and they charged $1.00 each. The other oysters were nice size but price $2.50-$4.00 each. Overall nice place ... I would visit again."}
{"text":"Nothing special. Typical bar type trendy wannabe place in the \"city\" - shrimp cocktail was horrible - it was not crisp but mushy. Never will be back. Save your money"}
{"text":"Scott was fantastic, guiding us through the fresh oyster menu and other features.  Everything exceeded expectations.  From craft cocktails, Oyster shooters, Lobster Roll, and their Saturday preparation of Wreckfish.  Delightful experience, highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Finally!!! NC seafood that is not \"Calabash-style\"!  I truly enjoyed the raw Canadian oysters (the South Lake, PEI were my favs)!  The a beautifully prepared Barrel Fish on a mashed sweet potato bed with fresh veggies snuggled against it. The portions were more than enough to fill me up and it felt more like comfort food than gourmet seafood.  Yum, yum, yum!! Definitely recommend you coming by here! The service is outstanding and all the staff were very attentive.  Considering taking a dessert back to the hotel with me!! Which one!!!???"}
{"text":"We had an early dinner in uptown Charlotte at Sea Level NC. They are a great recent addition to the fabulous choices for eating in that area. Their decor is modern and understated stylish. Lots of exposed brick and wood. It appeared to be a place where food and drinks should be the star. And that was indeed what we found !    They have a incredible farm to fork raw oyster menu. It changes constantly depending on the season and what's available. We had a dozen of mixed oysters. All fresh and delectable. Washed them down with a  craft cocktail called Melting NY Sour. It was what my husband called a \"man's drink\".    The clam chowder was literally overflowing with fresh clams in a flavorful thick soup chowder. Next up were their mussels. Plump and tasty. Mussel rule #108  don't forget to use the bread for sopping up the mussel broth!   Shrimp and Grits were simply prepared low country style. Uber flavorful gravy with a perfect amount of kick and creamy grits. Very filling and satisfying. A glass of Chardonnay went perfect with this dish.   Hubby order a classic Lobster roll. Huge hunks of lobster on greens and a remoulade sauce on a lightly toasted bread was fantastic. They let the lobster just be lobster. Why mess with perfection. Rose' was his wine choice.   A perfect spot to have our last meal of 2016 . Service was friendly and professional. Never underestimate how important southern hospitality is to a restaurant experience. Sea Level NC can put anyone in their culinary happy place !"}
{"text":"My husband and I had been wanting to try this for awhile. It was worth the wait!  The atmosphere was lively. The servers and hostess staff were friendly and attentive. I had the lobster roll which was delicious and the Parmesan Tator tots!  They were the best. I even recommended them to a couple who sat down next to us as we were leaving."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Average seafood. Very expensive. If I'm spending $150 ish I expect to leave full and satisfied. Our server was GREAT, just not a good bang for the buck kind of place. My Snapper was $32 and a tiny tail piece. It was delicious but EXTREMELY small. There are better options folks."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food and service! Reservations for Birthday dinner made via Yelp. Quick and easy. Reminders sent. Server was awesome. Friendly and very informative. Food was fresh and very flavorful."}
{"text":"Amazing food. started with corn fritters which were great then got oysters sea level and that was delicious with a red vinigaret sauce it comes with. Also had the catfish ruben sanwich wich was juicy and even more amazing. My husband had a burger with an egg. Super juicy and very flavorful. Service was great Destiny was very knowledgable on the menu and was super nice. We will definetly go back. especially since its hard to find good food in NC."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now, twice for oysters and once during Queen's Feast/Restaurant Week. The selection of oysters is impressive and they have some really tasty ones in stock. I am not big on the $1 house oysters, but they are $1 after all. Food is alright, presentation is well-done but the dishes are not anything special. I will be back to try an entrée not during the rush of Restaurant Week! Service is hit or miss."}
{"text":"I came here for drinks on New Years Eve. I came here around 10pm, and the service was completely phenomenal. After a long busy day, you would think everyone would be tired and drained. The staff were definitely not! I was greeted at the bar immediately. The food was brought out at a decent time. Our bar tender checked on us frequently, but not too frequently.  Coming here was on accident. So I ordered a mixed drink and a pork bun. This place is great for drinks if you aren't into seafood. I would definitely return for more food"}
{"text":"Sea Level is an excellent addition to Charlotte's restaurant scene. Local shellfish (when in season), tasty lobster roll, a small but decent draft beer selection and great service. I'll be back"}
{"text":"Just read the reviews Nikki W.'s and Leslie H. wrote IMO.  Great oysters and other dishes.  A little pricey in general, but not bad at all considering location.  Service wasn't 100%, but we had a large crowd on a very busy evening."}
{"text":"I'd wanted to come here for a while. Finally got to visit this seafood place on a Saturday night. We started with some Sea Level oysters at happy hour price of $1 each. The oysters were in decent size and very fresh. For appetizers we ordered shrimp steamed bun which turned out to be more like sliders - great portion and well seasoned. The entrees however, were a little disappointing. We had Trigger and Cobia since these were not the typical fish you see in a home cooked dinner. The veggies in both dishes were wayyyyy too salty we had to drink the whole bottle of water to finish the food. The trigger was breaded and fried, very greasy and salty as well. The cobia was cooked well but a little fishy in my opinion. The check was $80 which was not too bad but could have being spent on better tasted food. Won't come back unless for happy hour."}
{"text":"Great locally sourced food! I had the shrimp and grits at the recommendation of the waitress and it was one of the best versions I've ever had. The corn fritters were definitely the best I've ever had - throw some powdered sugar on them and they'd be the perfect food. I was so full that I didn't have room in my stomach to try any of the desserts, which also looked amazing. Next time I'll go just for dessert!  I made it to the restaurant via a quick walk from my hotel, which was easy and fast.  The wait staff was so friendly and attentive. They had some free time because it was not swamped when I was there, so they came over and talked which was nice since I was eating alone.  Definitely a repeat spot! Can't wait until my next visit."}
{"text":"Not terrible.  The striped bass was decent.  But, the atmosphere is more like a sports bar (loud with duchy patrons) than a fine seafood establishment.   Most people seemed to enjoy the raw snots.  I would give them another try under the right circumstances."}
{"text":"I legit think this is one of the most underrated restaurants in Charlotte.  From the friendly staff to the casual, but upscale environment, I'm always impressed with their menu and specials.  Sure, they run out of things, but that is to be expected when things are f-r-e-s-h not frozen.  I see that you can make reservations via yelp, I wish that they would get on the OpenTable Bandwagon.  Strong cocktail menu to boot and wine list isn't too shabby, either."}
{"text":"Re·do - to do something again or differently.   Hey Sea Level. It's me. Let's try this again.   My second visit was absolutely amazing! The service was good and the drinks were good and the food was delicious.   I started with the fish taco app and it's so tasty. Super fresh and well seasoned. I could eat a a few of these!   To drink I tried the ghost pepper pomegranate pommarita. It was just the right amount of spicy blended with the pomegranate mix and it was spot on! I'd absolutely recommend!   For dinner I had the salmon with crispy potatoes and a house salad. My salmon was cooked perfectly! Nice and tender and the addition of the aioli was such a nice touch of flavor! The potatoes were crispy and well seasoned and the maple ginger dressing is homemade and awesome.   Our waiter Nathan was kind and informative and very attentive! He's so knowledgeable about the menu don't be afraid to ask him questions!  I'm completely putting the first visit out of my mind. This time I was won over and I'm looking forward to another visit!"}
{"text":"This was our first time eating at Sea Level and we really enjoyed the experience. The service was outstanding. Our waiter was very knowledgeable and attentive. He had great suggestions about everything from our oysters to entrees. The paella was outstanding! There were 4 of us and we also had the swordfish/lobster special (to die for!) , the catfish and grits (grits were creamy, catfish was fried perfectly) and the short ribs (tender and tasty). Forgot to mention their version of calamari...( squid chow chow) that we had for a starter. We all agreed it was the best we had ever eaten.....the sauce was sweet and spicy and perfect! We didn't really have room for dessert...but thankfully that didn't stop us.... flourless brownie and apple cobbler...outstanding!!  Oh....and you should know that the briny oysters from Sea Level (the place, not the restaurant) are the BEST. Pretty cool that this restaurant is named for and serves them!"}
{"text":"My wife and I are visiting friends in Charlotte and we went to Sea Level for dinner on a Saturday night. I am delighted to say that the restaurant was fantastic. We had reservations and our seats were waiting for us. Our server, Joe, was fantastic. He was polite and made us feel so special. The seafood we had was really delicious. We would definitely come back here again"}
{"text":"I've been twice already. The food is very good. I went the week they opened initially and though the service was wanting, I think it had to do with the fact they just opened so everyone was trying to get into the groove. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Saturday afternoon I rolled in on a date, had a great experience. Service was very generous. The staff was very helpful, great team of waiters and waitresses. Bianca was especially helpful and told us all about oysters (which they had a wide selection) and showed us a unique apple topping. Had almost all of the beers on tap and they were incredible. I recommend getting the flying dog oyster stout nitro and suckin down oysters during happy hour. I sat at the oyster shucking part of the bar which was a great white marble and cool to see. I also had the clam chowder which was incredible and my girl had a Bloody Mary, that came fully loaded that she enjoyed. Very low key and good vibes with chill music. Fantastic place would recommend to anyone. Very fair prices also.   Dress: I wore a casual grey chino with a flannel and felt very confident in that. It's an upscale place but you can get away with a flannel in there."}
{"text":"Really a 3.5 Star review but yelp doesn't allow this.   The wife and I like all things from the sea, so we needed to check out this new place. Let's see how we get to 3.5 stars. It wasn't  really busy when we got there around 6pm on a week night, but it was pretty hopping by the time that we left. We wanted to see the shucking action up front and opted to sit at the oyster bar area. Our server explained the menu and the concept for us and we ordered drinks, the wife ordered a basil cucumber drink and I got their seasonal birdsong beer which was supposedly honey pie double IPA. I say supposedly it was honey pie because it definitely tasted of jalepeno but was not a pale ale. Maybe some tap line issues, I don't know. Either way the beer was fine, but it seems that their claim to fame is their cocktail list. The wife's drink was her jam and she loved it. Next time I will likely skip the beer and get a mix drink. Overall 3.5 stars for drinks  For food, we started off with a dozen oysters, which come priced per unit with varying prices based on fanciness of the oyster. Their house oyster is $1.75 and the priciest one was $4 with most being in the $2.5-$3 range. I am not sure if they have any happy hour specials but none were mentioned or on the menu. The  10 oyster varieties were definitely a plus and they were shucked expertly. It was also nice that we could experience different flavors since the oysters were from a variety of states, MA, MD and VA, if I remember correctly. The mignonette could use a little spoon for better application, but overall oysters rate a solid 4 stars.   We decided to order 2 mains and share. We opted for the tilefish and the smoked trout risotto. The food came out promptly after our oyster and we dug in. The tilefish was cooked very well with a crispy skin, but the food was mostly downhill from there. The flavor of the risotto was good and we both enjoyed the smoked trout. The risotto itself was watery for lack of better term. Now, I'm no expert in risotto, but it was probably overcooked as well based on the rice consistency. The bok choy with the tilefish was alright, and it was only after the plates were taken away that we both noticed that the turnip purée was absent from the tilefish plate. So overall, for the mains, I would say the mains were 3 stars at best. I will say that the menu had plenty of other things that I would return to try. They just opened, so maybe they just need to get some kinks out.  The cinnamon custard was shared for dessert and the wife loved it, me I'm not really a dessert guy. I should have ordered a trio of oysters for my dessert. I will say that the service was good and attentive, and they seem to be well staffed. The restaurant is also well laid out and has a good vibe to it. So there you have it, a 3.5 star experience that I must downgrade to a 3 star rating due to yelp restrictions. We shall return, even if only for drinks and oysters."}
{"text":"Oyster happy hour was as great start to the medium. We literally ate every single bite! The trigger fish was perfectly balanced with the grit cakes and herb salad. (It was super refreshing!) lobster roll and fries were also perfect!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time last night before a concert at the Belk Theater. Perfect location for dinner to walk next door for a show.  Our server was very nice, but not overly engaging.  I think she was new and a little nervous. We had the salmon, bass, catfish and mussels appetizer. Everything was delicious. My only complaints are 1) the tables are way too close together.  I felt like the guy next to me was sitting on my jacket and like we were dining with them.  It was a long booth with tables and chairs on the other side. And 2) the hostess didn't point out the coat check when we came in.  It's not in a visible spot and I didn't notice it until we were walking out.  It was very awkward with how close the tables were to have my coat next to me and then to try to put it back on at my table. I felt like i was totally in everyone's way.  And the job of a hostess is to offer the coat check if there is one.  So a few kinks to work out but overall very nice dining experience."}
{"text":"Great service! Great oysters! Awesome vibe! Was not expecting the levels they took to make sure we had what we were looking for!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! I had the shrimp and grits! The flavor is excellent!! My wife ordered the seafood paella and it was rocking!! Their shrimp is cooked just right!! The eclair is the recommended dessert!"}
{"text":"Halfway there... Some very good food, well cooked fish and fresh oysters. But the kitchen was sloppy and did not follow our requests to leave sauce on the side in the case of the too sweet squid chow chow (fried calamari) or warm  the mediocre apple tart. Way oversalting the greens was also a fault in the kitchen. Service not bad, but the restaurant gets super loud when full as it is all hard surfaces."}
{"text":"The food was expensive and not really that good. The waiter took over 20 minutes to take our drink order after we were seated. The ceviche was mostly corn with 3 small pieces of fish. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch.  Service was good and quick.  I ordered the fish taco and pork belly steam bun with the corn fritters.  They were all delicious and I was in and out in less than an hour."}
{"text":"Came in for happy hour. The bartender was nice, but the oysters had too much shell pieces in it."}
{"text":"food = 3.5 stars ambience = 3.5 honoring reservations = 5 service = 0  Had to repeat everything to waiter multiple times. Server was never around. My appetizer came after a second and third request after the rest of the party had finished theirs Ordered wine, which was NEVER delivered No Manager visible not did anyone come visit us even after multiple complaints"}
{"text":"Heard a good bit about this restaurant before visiting and I can't say that the hype lived up to the realization of what I experienced. Not a very busy day and I didn't get my wine until the very end of my last bite. The food was regular. Nothing exquisite or over the top in any way. Haven't been back since that first time and probably won't be returning either."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch and was not disappointed.  I started with a glass of wine - y'all know I love wine lol. The waitress suggested the Carletto Pinot Grigio. It was reasonably priced at $8/glass - nice crisp flavor with fruity hints.  I ordered 4 oysters, which were priced individually, and also the pick 3, which was 2 small plates and a side. I chose 2 \"Sweet Jesus\" oysters from ME and 2 Blue Point oysters from MD. Both were fresh and tasty. No overly fishy or salty taste to them.  For the pick 3, I chose the oyster slider, the fish taco, and the corn fritters. The oyster slider was a fried oyster with a slaw mix and a jalapeño cream drizzle. It was the bomb.com. The fish taco was amaze balls too. The fish was seasoned really well, and they didn't skimp on it either lol. The corn fritters were equally delicious - nice mix of sweetness and heat from the dipping sauce. Overall, it was a really great meal.  I did however wish that the oysters came out first instead of all together. It did seem to take awhile for everything to come out - I started snacking on the stale crackers that they bring out with the hot sauce and moist towelettes lol."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant on their opening night and every month since! They have $1 sea level oysters from 4pm -7 pm daily and they are so good and they are the perfect medium sized, briney, and fresh oysters! They also carry pacific, PEI and gulf coast oysters. I recommend their mussels and their version of oysters Rockefeller as well. Their oyster Rockefeller are filled with brie and prosciutto!"}
{"text":"Kind and knowledgeable staff with delicious and well cooked seafood and strong and well thought out drinks. They were out of the duck tacos and a few other times when I went so don't go on a Monday..."}
{"text":"Fabulous oysters, fantastic servers, great atmosphere and I'd love to come back but honestly the home made tonic mixed with my Tito's was awful! Loved the guys working behind the bar and would encourages anyone who loves oysters to visit but bring your own tonic!"}
{"text":"You had me at Sea...  I had the chance to visit this new seafood spot many times since its opening, and I'm loving everything Sea Level has to offer.  Here's everything you need to know from the Sea to the Level...  Parking:  Due to the fact that Sea Level is located in the heart of uptown Charlotte, there is no lot exclusively for Sea Level's patrons.  No matter, there are plenty of paid parking garages throughout the area.  I recommend parking in the one directly attached to Sea Level.  Don't worry about paying for parking, Sea Level validates parking here, so remember to bring your parking ticket with you!  Just ask the hostess on your way out and you're good.    Ambiance:  Upon walking in, I was struck by the streamlined, sleek feel of Sea Level.  It felt like an iPhone store turned restaurant.  Not that it was full of a bunch of technology, gadgets, or gizmos, but because the server kiosks are all hidden, and all the shelving is kind of built into the walls.  The hardwood floors seem to add a nice homey feel as well.  Food:  Awesome.  I had a chance to order the mussels.  Although they came out somewhat lukewarm, not hot, I thought the broth was very flavorful and I would def order them again.  No trip to Sea Level would be complete without a few oysters, so 6 oysters from the raw bar it is - 3 Sea Level and 3 Sweet Jesus.  I wasn't a huge fan of the Sea Levels, however the Sweet Jesus oysters were very succulent. Other menu items I've sampled include the fish tacos which were awesome, and I would def recommend.  I've also had the fried oyster taco, which I did not enjoy as much.  I know they have the shrimp and grits listed as an app, but it also work well as an entree if your not to hungry - tasty but not spicy.    Sea Level is a welcomed addition to the limited Charlotte seafood scene.  PS:  Don't forget to take advantage of the weekday Happy Hour they have.  They always have  select oysters for $1/oyster!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night a few weeks ago. Made a reservation (which is a must) since it was packed and we still had to wait about 20-30 minutes for a table. The food is amazing though!! Ordered the oysters Noda (a favorite), two types of oysters, Maine mussels (another favorite), corn fritters, duck tacos and vegetable of the day. Oh and can't forget dessert- cinnamon pot du creme. Service was a bit slow and I think that our waitress forgot about us for a while. Noisy atmosphere. But... if you are looking for a lively place for dinner with great oysters and mussels this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Bartender was remarkably rude, correcting me on how to make a martini. And when I got it, it was not what I had ordered. If this were just the bar, I would give it one star. We then sat down for dinner, and that helped make up for it. Our server was energetic, welcoming, and knowledgeable. My husband and I had the paella for two. Much smaller portion than we were accustomed to, but it was okay because we started with a dozen oysters, which were quite tasty. The paella itself was minimal, and apparently had been cooking a bit too long, as the rice had brined and was dry and stuck to the bottom of the pan. Not everything it was hyped up to be, and we will likely not go back."}
{"text":"Holy Shucks...I am speechless as this was the best experience I have had in NC in years. Place was packed and we started at the bar where were could get a front row seat at the action. Our server no his new name is Master Upseller did and over the top job. He took his time explaining everything on the menu what to try first the taste how to pair and so one. We received our 2 dozen oysters and went to town. The Sauces that came with the oysters were spot on as they were fresh with that slight seawater and sand taste. Fresh I mean pick up out the ocean an open with the sand still in your toes fresh. We enjoyed that then tried the seafood paella with the Lobster tail which he recommended.  As we started eating another sever came over and asked how we enjoyed everything told us about the sliders and ceviche. Our original server came back asking how everything was and also suggested the slides and in great detail explained each of the flavors. With that said we order the sliders. While we waited for our order the floor manager stopped by and asked how things were going we smiled and said perfect. We had the seafood and pork belle sliders that had amazing full flavor on a sticky bun wow. Needless to say the place packed but everyone was working hard making it seem in perfect order with quality, cleanliness and accuracy. Even the team shucking oysters was chatting with us and telling us about the strawberry ceviche which we are going to get next time. Words can't describe how awesome this place. We are coming back next week and for Birthday I am celebrating here."}
{"text":"Wow- service was so bad we didn't even make it to ordering. The hostess was rude, never gave us menus. We had to ask our server to bring them to us and then he disappeared never to return. Well we shall never return also.  Will say the manager did offer his apologies on the way out, I could tell that level of service was unacceptable to him."}
{"text":"Dollar oyster happy hour is amazing.  I had the oysters and the seafood paella. The paella was excellent,  mostly seafood very little rice.  Great quality mussels that took up nearly the whole she'll. I thought the shrimp could have been larger and more tender but overall it was still a great dish."}
{"text":"Mmm. Oysters were so fresh and I loved the mignonette sauces that they serve with the raw oysters. We sat at the oyster bar while we waited for a booth and watched them shuck while we enjoyed a glass of wine.   We Our server, Scott, was attentive and made great recommendations. The clam chowder was loaded with clams! We also had salmon tartare and the lobster roll with the most crispy and cheesy homemade tater tots. Enjoyable experience and great service!"}
{"text":"We visited Sea Level before we went to see Trevor Noah. I didn't really have high expectations for the restaurant. It's right across the street from the theater and our friends wanted to check it out. I'm always down for new places so I decided to set up the reservations and make it happen. I'm not a huge fan of seafood, but the restaurant had a decent amount of \"land\" options. More importantly: they have corn fritters on the menu. That's how classy I am. I was down to go because of the corn fritters.   We arrived right on time for our reservations - they were on the early side so not many people were there yet. I really wish I remembered our waiters name because he was awesome. He checked in on us, joked with us, and genuinely cared about our experience. Part of why I liked the experience so much was because of him.  We ordered corn fritters, of course. They were so good. Not what I expected or was used to, but still legit. I also ordered a seasonal drink named, \"Thyme for a drink\". It was the perfect balance of sweet and fruity. I then ordered a burger and fries. I know, not original. But my boyfriend ordered fish and grits so he made up for my land order. More importantly, my friends husband ordered the paella. Holy cow. It looked amazing. Per his report: it tasted amazing. He even joked about getting another one for dessert.   Speaking of dessert, my boyfriend ordered the key lime ice cream sandwiches. He didn't finish them because the ice cream was extremely tart. I, on the other hand, ordered an apple-pie- bourbon-pecan concoction. I'm drooling about it now. My friend ordered the sundae and joked (but not really) about not sharing with us. We weren't even mad that she didn't because it was on the smaller side... and no one was going to even jokingly try to take it.  All in all, we had an extremely good time and were all pleasantly pleased with the restaurant. If you're seeing a snow, the location is very convenient... might as well make some reservations now!"}
{"text":"What a quint place in First Ward! The restaurant itself is located in the perfect area. We had a late lunch here and sat outside. The patio had great views!   We ordered a house white wine and a glass of beer and had two tacos!   Our favorite taco was the:  1. Fried Oyster Taco  2. Fish Taco  The ambiance was so perfect for our Saturday afternoon! Can't wait to come back to this place again!"}
{"text":"Fresh seafood has returned to uptown for lunch.  I've had the pleasure of visiting several times since they've opened and overall everything has been very good.  As an appetizer, I've tried the corn fritters and the pork belly bun and both are amazing and flavorful.  For lunch, I've tried the  salmon which is fresh and melts in your mouth, the striped bass is delish, and the catfish and grits are my favorite.  The only thing that I wasn't a fan of was the lobster roll, the lobster had a bitter taste and just didn't taste good at all.  The service and staff are always superb.  Great addition to uptown."}
{"text":"Nice place.. Good menu but the service and pricing don't match the quality level of the food..need to drop the prices a good 20% or step up their game on the bland food. Server was more interested in trying to flirt and impress one individual in our party than doing his job."}
{"text":"Decided to press the reset button and try Sea Level after a bad experience 2 weeks. It something I said I would do. But I will change things a bit.  Greeted by the hostess. Different this time but still sweet. I came in on a Saturday at 1:30pm and sat at the bar. It wasn't that busy which is great. I was worry because St Paddy Parade was in full force outside. Greeted by Blanca. She brought me water and the menu. My bartender/waitress Audrea was the one who serviced me thru out the time there and Blanca backup when needed. These ladies are what services are suppose to me. They were tentative. One glance at Audrea. And she understood that I need her. So here's what I ordered:  6 raw oyster, varied picked by Audrea Corn Fritters Fish taco Oyster Taco  Mini salad Shrimp cocktail 2 snow crab claws Po boy sandwich  5 blushing bubbles drinks (yes I'm a lush)   A friend of mine like raw oysters. I like steamed oysters but since they don't offer steamed.  the oysters goes to him.. seem like he enjoyed it. Slurped it up quick. And I sure enjoy watch the guy behind the bar shucking it. I'm in love with the corn fritters. Crispy in the outside and fairly soft in the inside. No sauce needed. I really enjoyed the fried oysters Taco.. the batter oysters was different in a Taco and I can say I had one and will come back for more. Definitely can't complain about the shrimp cocktail, just wish the plating will be slightly different. I ordered soo much food that eventually the shrimps was sitting in a pool of water after the ice melts. But hey it went down the same place. I never had the snow crab claws before so I must say it's a treat and no wonder it's $5. If I didn't order some much food. I would just order that all night with the blushing bubbles and the corn critters. My friend enjoyed the Po Boy but I'm guessing not so much the fish Taco because he didn't finish it.  Overall I'm glad I hit the reset button. This time around, service was sooo much better., the food was excellent. I enjoyed the quietness of the restaurant and the ambiance."}
{"text":"Finally a restaurant in Charlotte that serves fresh, tasty seafood- and lots of choices!  The service was attentive even though it was a very busy night.  We will definitely return"}
{"text":"Let me just say, the food was fantastic. The oysters were so fresh; even the NC ones that were $2...not very gamey, the corn fritters were great. Everything about the place and their menu is top notch and great eats. I'd give it 5 stars alone for that.  But the service we experienced last night was garbage. Absolute garbage. I'll do bullet points to save on the fluff: - As a party of 7, a couple of people in our group only managed to get one drink ordered (alcohol), and the rest of the time we had to flag the guy down to get more after patiently waiting since it was starting to get crowded. - When we did manage to get his attention after waiting for long enough, he directly told our table \"wait a minute\", in a rude and gruff voice and didn't even stop to explain it, cutting me off when I was trying to explain myself. - He was waiting on people at the bar in an area that's clearly run by the bartender. - He was more fixated and chatting up the table next to ours, which coincidentally happened to be all women. - Multiple times, when I was sitting out menus for my friends to join me, he'd deliberately come back and put them back in between the salt and pepper shaker. Not once. MULTIPLE times.  There was nothing inviting about him, we had to wait forever to order more drinks, and when we couldn't, and tried to politely get his attention, he'd brush us off without so much as a word out of our mouths. I don't ever make a scene in a restaurant or ask for a manager, but the service was literally so bad I almost went to the manager and had them deduct our automatic gratuity. I don't know if he was just in a bad mood, or if he thought that because his tip was going to be automatically included that he could just get away with doing a pretty poor job...but that kind of attitude needs to be left at the door, not at work where you're trying to make people feel welcome.  So kudos to Sea Level for the amazing cuisine and super fresh oysters, but if I were to go back, I'd turn around and walk out if I saw the same guy working."}
{"text":"I work in Hearst tower so I normally go for lunch l, but I've also been in for a fancy after work cocktail. The drink menu is impressive and the bartenders are great. At lunch I recommend the pick 3... fried oyster taco and corn fritters must be 2 of the 3!!"}
{"text":"Really awesome - the type of place Uptown needs.  Went last night, got seated immediately even missing part of our party. We had a cocktail while waiting (which was awesome) and ordered an appetizer and oysters. I didn't eat the oysters but was told they were awesome. The shrimp steam bun was really great too!  As for entrees at our table - lobster roll, catfish reuben, and risotto. My friend from Massachusetts had the lobster roll and gave it the seal of approval. The catfish reuben was amazing, and the risotto got a good review.  All in all I am so excited to have this place uptown and will be a frequent visitor! Price is really reasonable also."}
{"text":"Holy cow! If you love seafood run don't walk to this place! Seafood Tower with the Sea Level oysters that are being grown just for this restaurant was amazing. The oysters had a sweetness and a briny quality  and a freshness which was truly unique and absolutely delicious. How fortunate is Charlotte to have this place! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Great food and super service.  Nate was our expert waiter. I can be picky and high maintenance at times but Nate's intuitive pace, timing and knowledge of the food was impressive. He was able to explain the restaurant's concept and how the food is  sourced.   This is an oyster fans paradise. They even have a oyster shot for those that are interested. Outdoor seating and a dining area that is well appointed and intimate; great for conversation.  This was my 1st time here but will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I hate to write a negative review (and I so rarely write reviews!) but our dinner at Sea Level ended up being a horrible experience. My boyfriend and I went for restaurant week last night - please avoid this restaurant!   He started off with the smoked old fashioned cocktail - so smoky-tasting he couldn't even finish it. We both ordered off the restaurant week menu. He started with a half dozen oysters that were flavorless. I ordered the shrimp ceviche which was edible, but chewy, and a tiny portion! For his main course, he got the shrimp and grits. This also had very little flavor and was cold. The shrimp were few and far between and they looked like something you'd buy in the frozen section. My mahi mahi was a very small portion (my boyfriend joked, \"Is that going to be enough for you?\") and it was GRAY in color. I can't believe I ate it but our waiter was so MIA that I knew if I sent it back it'd be another 45 minutes before I could get anything else.   For dessert, he ordered some kind of s'mores thing which was cold when he received it. I'm pretty sure it was supposed to be hot. He joked that they could have at least put it in the microwave! I took a bite - gross. My bread pudding was okay but it was obvious that all the food was pre-made and had been sitting in a refrigerator for quite some time.  Overall, this was a beyond disappointing experience. It was extremely expensive for horrible food and terrible service. My boyfriend NEVER complains about food (truly, he would eat anything), but even he said after dinner that \"nothing about that meal was good.\" I would think that for a new restaurant, they'd be trying to entice people to come back after restaurant week. This is not a place I'll ever be frequenting again. Please do NOT eat here!"}
{"text":"The service and food was good, I ordered the NC Flounder and my wife ordered NC catfish. My   disappointment would  be the portion size, this was one very small piece on fish,tasty but small. Restaurant is located downtown close to all the happenings ."}
{"text":"I was craving some seafood and I also knew after consuming said sea food I wanted to get a  drink at one of my favorite bars in Charlotte, Connoly's. Well, Sea Level is right next door so this was a winning combo for a date night. We got there after 7 pm which meant no partaking of the 4/7 pm Monday through Saturday happy hour where oysters (I'm sure not all varieties) are $1. Still ok though. I was with my husband and we started with cocktails; I got a dirty Tito's martini that hit the spot and my husband got a krampus. I selected one each of the kumamoto and rappahannock oysters. They set me back 2.75 each which I don't mind paying for since they are quality oysters and soon waters will be getting to warm for oysters so getting them all in while I can! We shared the corn fritters which were disappointing as they were more hush puppy than corn but they were good, just not what I expect in a corn fritter. They were also round-ish like a hush puppy and not pancake-ish in shape like a fritter. Just a bit misleading. For dinner I got the lobster roll which was great and on a buttered, grilled roll. I paired that with a house salad. My guy picked off the sides menu and created a dinner of the fish taco, duck taco and pork belly steam bun. The fish taco and bun were his favorites.  I like this place and the staff was on point as well."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Oysters are clean and fresh, drinks are amazing, service is wonderful. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Yes, I'm in the South. Yes, I'm in BBQ heaven. But can I have something a little lighter and refreshing? Something that doesn't make me feel like I need to hit the gym to burn it all off?  Thank you, Sea Level NC for answering my wishes!  My coworker and I snagged a table on Monday night, finding the place with plenty of seating left, but the room still abuzz with people who just got off from work and want to enjoy a cocktail after a long day. The menu is simplistic, but offers a variety of seafood dishes, both small and large. In dire need of something besides meat, we got the Maine mussels in whine garlic sauce as an appetizer to share, and then for an entree I chose the tile fish filet with an assortment of vegetables and sriracha aioli.   Our waiter for the night was Andrew who was wonderfully charismatic and made us feel comfortable with ease. His consistent check-ups on us throughout the night as well as useful recommendations made for a lovely dinner. His service was phenomenal!  When the mussels hit our table, I could already smell the garlic butter sauce, making my mouth water instantly. The portion was GIGANTIC which meant my coworker and I weren't going to have to fight for any mussels because my goodness, were they good! Each mussel shell had plenty of meat inside that was tender and buttery. The sauce was delectable, especially when paired with the toasted bread. Great start!  Not too soon after, my entree of the tile fish arrived and was beautifully presented on a bed of crispy kale with bright, cubed pieces of sweet potatoes strewn throughout. The aioli sauce added a nice kick of heat while the fish was flaky. The exterior was a tad bit saltier than I would have liked and there were some pieces of the fish that were hard. At one point, I thought I had eaten a bone, but it was actually just a tiny sliver of skin that was over fried. The kale retained its crunchy bite and the sweet potatoes were soft. It was a deliciously light entree that left me feeling full without all the guilt.  In fact, I ended up ordering a shot of dessert which contained layers of marshmallow, graham crackers, and chocolate, very similar to a deconstructed s'more. The marshmallow was a bit too sweet and stuck to my teeth, but the dark chocolate underneath would have appeased any chocolate lover. It was creamy, it was rich, and it was the perfect way to end the night.   Sea Level NC embodies both a classy atmosphere and delectable food. There were so many dishes I wanted to try and if given the chance, I would come back in a heartbeat. Sea Level NC was amazing!"}
{"text":"Sea Level was fantastic working with my dinner group & offering a Queen's Feast style menu that had great menu options for any dietary concern w/in the group.  Bianca was a pleasure to work w/& made it incredibly easy.  The group as a whole enjoyed their 3 course meal.  One indicating it was the best clam chowder she'd ever had.   My corn fritters aka gourmet hush puppies were tasty.  They are served w/a citrusy spicy sauce. It may not seem like it packs a punch wait for the after burn.  Shrimp & grits was fabulous!  2 in the party had never had shrimp & grits before & were convinced to try it because the kitchen was accommodating & provided a sample before our order was placed.  My only suggestion would be to be a little less heavy handed w/the gravy.  It subdued the taste of the grits & was like overdressing a salad.  Luckily, it's quite scrumptious.  Lastly, for dessert, 2 people ordered the cake which was quite decadent & the rest of us ordered the Key Lime Ice Cream Sandwich which was a delightful burst of citrus to finish a truly delightful meal.  The service was superb.  They never made us feel as if we were an inconvenience like some do when it is part of a party esp 1 of all females.   I would recommend Sea Level for a small group of 12 or just a wonderful meal between friends.  I look forward to my next experience at Sea Level :)"}
{"text":"I'll start of my stating two things: 1) the waiter was awesome 2) the shrimp cocktail was the bomb Other than that it was just average. Drinks took a long time from order to receive, dessert was the same. The entrees were reasonably priced, however it tasted average. The dessert was good, but a $3 adder for a third scope of ice cream was a tad excessive. The atmosphere is good, as you'd expect from uptown, but they need to focus more on the plates. 3-1/2 stars. I was just hoping for more"}
{"text":"I wanted to followup on my review. The owner reached out and did everything he could to make things right. He was pleasant and I appreciate his efforts. I feel he was genuine in wanting us to have a better experience. I will give them another try at some point."}
{"text":"Music blasting loudly.  Waiter offered to turn it down twice - someone had raised it up sooo loud. What the hell is the point of raising the music so loud in the afternoon? Portions of fish excessively small, mine was roughly a 2 inch square.  Vegetables excessively salty.  Collard greens were dripping in excessive vinegar - could not swallow them.  Waiter mentioned how oysters are $1.00 on Saturdays.  I ordered a dozen cause it was SATURDAY.  The bill came back including $46 of the $150 bill was for 12 oysters - NOT HAPPY!  Waiter went to talk with manager and came back to me saying there was nothing they could do because the $1 oysters were only for the ones from their farm.  This was never mentioned. Very deceptive.  The entire situation was handled like a bunch of amateurs. I'll never go back."}
{"text":"A few girlfriends and I dined here for restaurant week. We had reservations so upon arrival we were greeted and seated almost immediately. The place is big, considering it's uptown and in the Hearst Tower. They offer to comp your parking as long as you park in the tower so bring your garage ticket with you. If you ever been to the Lobster Place in Chelsea Market in NYC that's what this place reminded me of. Lots of table room and space. We had different servers throughout our meal so that was a little bit confusing. Foods came out prompt and everyone seemed to have enjoyed their meal. Every course was filling and perfectly cooked and seasoned. Overall we thought this place was great and definitely worth coming back to, especially for the $1 oysters happy hour during the week."}
{"text":"Seal Level gets a high 5 for ambience and location.   I am a huge seafood fan and desperately wanted to get behind this restaurant.   We started with shrimp tempura and it was meh.   The tempura batter was strong, the shrimp inside was chunky and had the right texture - it was just bland as was the sauce that came with it.   This needed some salt, an acid based sauce to cut the heavy tempura batter, some seasoning something....   the shrimp and grits was spot on, definitely on point.   I had the fried oyster slider or bun which was excellent.   Of course I had to try some oysters, which is where this place shines.    These were excellent.   I also tried the shrimp cocktail and while the portion was impressive, the rest was again unremarkable.   Again, no seasoning, nothing remarkable about the cocktail sauce, needed some punch.   With the ambience, this place has potential to be an nice downtown bar - unfortunately both my vodka based cocktails were delivered tepid.   I had do some serious table side stirring and mixing to get it where it needed to be.   It's not that difficult to shake a cocktail or even invert it.   This place was also not that busy to excuse this twice made mistake.   It's got good bones, I'd definitely give it another try but some small tweaks would easily turn a 3 into a 5."}
{"text":"Our entire family loved the food here during our most recent visit.  As was recommended by a fellow Yelper, we tried a large variety of Sea Level's offerings.  Our favorite was the raw oysters.  They were the best in town.  We also had oyster shooters and they was yummy as well.  The lobster sandwich was another favorite. The Shrimp cocktail and corn fritters were big hits.  A small fight broke out at our table over the last corn fritter, problem solved..we just ordered more!  You can't go wrong at this restaurant if you love fresh seafood!"}
{"text":"Sea Level NC did not disappoint I had the shrimp and fish ceviche for the first course  I selected the catch of the day which was swordfish that came in fresh that morning from Charleston per or server Jonathan and for dessert I selected the layered chocolate cake. My favorite part of the meal was the second course. The swordfish was cooked to perfection, meaty, juicy. The mushroom polenta was so savory and the fresh herbs were a perfect compliment. The chocolate layer cakes was heavenly. See pics attached   Our server Jonathan was attentive very friendly and took great care of us. The manager came over just to see how our experience was. The restaurant is beautiful. You can tell that there was so much thought placed into the design and decor. I will definitely be back and I would recommend Sea Level NC to anyone who loves seafood!"}
{"text":"Updating my review.  Have gone back to Sea Level for lunch and it was delicious.  Selected from the pick three lunch menu and shared with two others.  Oyster slider, shrimp steam bun, corn fritter, grits and potato cake were tasty.  Apple endive salad was very good as well.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Became one of my favorites in Charlotte. Went for anniversary dinner Saturday night. Hard to find good seafood since I lived in Miami the majority of my life. Love the industrial, semi-casual decor/atmosphere. Nice they take reservations. Server was fantastic! Food was delicious and good portions. I'm tired of the newer restaurants with the mini portions they serve. These were just right. Not too big and not too small. Had stone crab appetizer which was one of the specials of the day and the ceviche. Both really good. Husband had snapper linguine which was prepared perfectly! I had clam chowder and ceasar salad.  Will defiantly  be revisiting!"}
{"text":"The food was okay. Just a bit too over thought. The shrimp po boy (which is a classic southern dish and I'm a classic southerner) was not the over flowing small golden brown shrimp on a soft roll. Instead it was these heavenly breaded large over cooked shrimp on this giant dense roll. I'm a purest so maybe some ppl like this but it's not the traditional sandwich. They also have a \"rueben\" on the menu that was recommended to me by the server. I said I don't care for thousand island/Russian dressing and she stated it didn't come with that...again a classic sandwich without the classic details (and seafood and cheese..no).  The positives are the atmosphere and the salads. My friend got the apple and endive with salmon and raved about it. I'll try this place again but I will come at night when I can try some of their cocktails. Cocktails without soda b/c their selection is from a local company and let's just say they skimp on the carbonation."}
{"text":"Three words - OYSTER HAPPY HOUR!  $1 oysters on the halfshell in uptown Charlotte?  YES, please!    We stopped in here after work on a Friday afternoon just before 5 p.m. We were quickly seated at the bar with drink orders taken.  We watched our 2 dozen oysters being shucked (very quickly, I might add) and served with no wait.    There was a wide selection of oysters available - we stuck to the $1 oysters that day, but look forward to coming in for a variety plate soon."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Ordered the Sea Level and NC wild oysters along with the corn fritters and was not disappointed. Cocktails are delicious as well. The Sea Level oysters were fairly small but everything else was great."}
{"text":"OK, so I'm super bummed I was so busy Snapchatting the food & talking I forgot to take still photos for my Yelp fam!! My bad! Don't let that deter you from visiting this restaurant!! Absolutely my new favorite place for seafood in Charlotte, HANDS DOWN! It was my best friend's birthday dinner & they brought his dessert with a candle in it after my unconsciously mentioning it was his birthday as were sat down. We had reservations for 8:30p on a Wednesday & it was not packed at all! We were seated immediately and our drink order was taken at the same time we ordered apps. As far as appetizers go.. all I have to say is CORN FRITTERS & TEMPURA SHRIMP!! Don't cheat yourself & miss out on those two options. I got champagne with a cranberry sugar cube in it.. forget the name of it but it has \"Bubble\" in the title! I drank 5 of them so don't judge my memory! My BF had the house white wine & loved it! Everything on the menu is locally sourced as it's a farm-to-fork concept restaurant! (my favorite type) So the wine was local and amazing. I had the Catfish Ruben with hand-cut fries & a side salad: AMAZE BALLS! It was like a catfish melt on garlic bread! *kisses fingers* The fries were gone before the sandwich was! My BF had the Lobster Roll & Grits which he loved, loved, loved! Everything was so fresh!! He almost ordered it again to bring home! This place is amazing. I can't wait to go again this weekend!! :)"}
{"text":"I visited Sea Level after concert at Belk Theatre on a busy Friday night. It was a late reservation (10:30) and the restaurant was fairly busy. Our waitress Mary was polite and helpful and fairly attentive. The striped sea bass, fried catfish & grits were both excellent! I will def return when I have a taste for fish and grits !"}
{"text":"Wow. This place was absolutely amazing. From the moment we walked in to the moment we left it was an outstanding experience. Our waiter, Nate, could not have been better. He was great at describing everything on the menu we had questions about. His knowledge of the menu and even the drinks (the drinks were as good as the food) was spectacular. Moving on to the food (that's why we came right?). I can't possibly describe how good it was. I had the corn fritters and my girlfriend had a half dozen oysters as an app. Both were great. For an entree I had the paella and it was hands down one of the best seafood meals I've ever had. I had doubts about about a seafood restaurant 200 miles from the coast and having lived in Charleston for 40 years, but they exceeded my expectations by a mile. I highly recommend this place. Ask for Nate if you can."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor on the outside of the restaurant. Have a great deal on oysters from sea level for $1 each from 4-6, highly recommend!! The fish tacos were okay, but the fish wasn't very flavorful. The smores shooter for dessert was absolutely incredible! Marshmallow on top with cookie crumbs, and brownie in between layers. Would come back just for oysters and dessert."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! The oysters and fish were fresh and delicious.  Service was excellent. They even have my favorite wine by the glass. We will definitely be back. They validate parking, making it easy."}
{"text":"Fun times!  Went for a group outing with about 15-20 of us.  We had two tables on a Friday night.  Started out with oyster shooters, pork belly tacos, and oysters.  Great beer selection too.  I got the grouper and wife got the veggie burger, both were awesome!  Cool place to eat and drink."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time to celebrate my mom's birthday. I really enjoyed the decor and atmosphere of the restaurant. I ordered the clam chowder and loved it! I am from New England so I was a little nervous to try it. I do wish the menu was a little bigger. I wanted to try the paella but they said they couldn't make it without chorizo which I don't eat. Overall the food was food and I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"What a great experience. The selection of oysters the freshness and the staff were all a delight. The atmosphere was amazing. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"A fantastic meal and great experience overall, we are already planning to return! The atmosphere was pleasant, a rare warm February day for outside dining. I had a shrimp cocktail with plenty of obviously fresh NC shrimp and house-maid cocktail sauce that all tasted great. The swordfish entree was likewise perfect and came with a wonderful lobster risotto. The tempura shrimp was absolutely perfect, and we are pretty snobby about shrimp. A colleague had the mussels and raved about them as well as her fish juice punch drink. I cannot recommend this place enough. And I would be remiss if I did not mention the fantastic service we received from Nate; thanks for the great dinner."}
{"text":"Went before a show at Belk Theater because it was so close to the theater. Would have sat outside, but there was an obnoxiously noisy food truck serving patrons at the patio bar at Connolly's next door. We didn't have reservations so we got a small table near the front door, but it wasn't bad. Our server was friendly.  Nice wine selection.  I had the trout and a side salad. The trout was delicious. My husband had salmon and he was disappointed by the small serving. His was much smaller than my generous portion of trout. The side salad was frustrating because there were huge leaves of lettuce on a plate. The croutons and lettuce kept falling off the plate.  It's loud inside and hard to hear the server and your dinner partner."}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere, nice dining outside, waiter was on point very friendly, attend to our need. Host greeted us, very friendly, liquor a huge selection, wine excellent and a variety of selection. I wish they had cocktail. I ask the waiter he said they don't have a blender, in the bar, was a little disappointed, I also wish they had a wider selection of sea food, not much. I  had the salmon with roast potatoes, collard greens. Hubby had the fish sandwich, and corn fritter. The food was ok, I  wish they had like a seafood platter, well. Will recommend but not for a seafood place to eat."}
{"text":"The wife and I went for Queen's Feast last week as an early birthday dinner for me as she was out of town on the actual day. First, it is a very cool establishment visually. There is a nice outdoor porch area and you enter right beside the bar. There are all kind of unique decorations, and the interior was smaller than I expected, but still plenty of seating.  As for the food, everything was DELICIOUS! I started off with a half dozen raw oysters. Like the interior of the restaurant, smaller than I expected, but their house-made cocktail sauce was fantastic. The fresh \"local\" catch was red snapper. I love seafood in general, but snapper in unique because it is not very fishy so to speak. It was served over a jalapeno gazpacho, shitaake rice, vegetables, and kimchi slaw. So good mixing the different flavors. I am not much of a restaurant dessert person, but when it's included with the dinner price, what the hay? I chose the cinnamon sugar eclair and my head immediately EXPLODED! So good again.  I also had a \"fancy beverage\" as my wife calls them. The Smoked Old Fashioned was delicious. One large cube of ice with Makers Mark, hickory smoke, and bitters. You could smell the hickory as the drink arrived and gave the drink fantastic flavor. I would definitely recommend Sea Level for Queen's Feast (and special occasions as the menu is a bit above our normal price range, but also well worth it)."}
{"text":"I have been anticipating on trying this restaurant ever since Charlotte Agenda featured a story on them. We went on the night of the St Pattys day bar crawl which might of been a mistake. It was extremely loud on the restaurant. The waitress we had was great though and gave some great suggestions. The corn fritters were ok, I'm sure to corn fritters with a creamy center not breaded and with a little more corn. The sauce lemon chipotle sauce that comes with the fritters was amazing though. I ordered the lobster roll with a side salad and the significant other order the catfish and grits. I think I enjoyed the side salad with maple-something vinaigrette the most, lobster roll was ok, lobster meet was a little tough. Catfish and grits were ok too, catfish was lightly fried and the grits were creamy. I will give this place another chance soon."}
{"text":"Finally!...I made it to Sea Level and very glad I did.  I appreciate their heavy support of NC farms and the practice not to serve only non-threatened species.  Food was fresh, flavorful & served by very friendly staff.  Though the ambient noise was quite loud for being a smaller restaurant, we didn't mind since it was a great, overall experience.  Being tucked away in a corner of the Hearst Tower doesn't provide the best people watching opportunity, so bring enjoyable company over great food and drinks!"}
{"text":"The oysters we had were not fresh whatsoever. I got the lobster roll which came with frozen lobster meat. My boyfriend got the fried catfish which was undercooked and did not taste fresh. Overall we had a terrible experience and we will not be back. We are big restaurant people and have tried most of the top restaurants in Charlotte. This restaurant looks really nice inside and has a great vibe, but the food was not up to par."}
{"text":"Im from out of town and really wanted some seafood. Everyone recommended Sea Level and I can now see why. I had the shrimp po boy with a smoked old fashioned and my co worker had the salmon. We were both very satisfied with our food!! The atmosphere is great, good food and drink selection. Definitely a good HH place. Can't wait to visit Charlotte again!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at this place & it was everything people bragged about. The food was DELICIOUS  & the oysters was nothing less than the entree! We had a waiter name NATE & HE was PROFESSIONAL, KNOWLEDGEABLE & PLEASANT. His customer service was top notch & we made sure his tip reflected it!! If u love oysters, come during happy hour 4-7 & the sea levels are $1. They also I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I hope this goes more as a review than a tip because it is  gonna be pretty short. I loved the place and the overall vibe of it...the food not so much. So the drinks were phenomenal, the muscles were very bland and the fried shrimp was greasy, and my fried oysters were ok. I tried something new and was happy about that. The Sheepshead Fish(which I never heard of) was delicious. It was medium in size and very filling. The awesome part of this restaurant was our Server, Nathan. He was so fun and knowledgeable and very honest about the menu. Will I go back?!!! Yes because again, the atmosphere is great and the drinks were perfect. Guess this wasn't short after all!!!"}
{"text":"I had the Vegan burger it was ok but fell apart inspired me to just go ahead and start making my own of course mines is 10x better. Still pretty good and priced good $11 for vegan burger with fries would recommend to other vegans"}
{"text":"Based off of the reviews,I had high expectations for Sea Level.We ordered the corn fritters for a starter.The corn fritters taste like a mixture of pancakes and funnel cake with pieces of corn.While that may sound like a great combination,I found the batter to be very thick as in I needed water to make it go down.I think it would have been better with syrup or something and labeled as a dessert.We both actually ordered the Shrimp & Grits.I am a big fan of Shrimp & Grits so my expectations are high,especially being a native of Charleston.I find this dish to be missing seasoning.Our service was very poor.The food took an extremely long time (no exaggeration) to be brought out (starter and entree).Receiving refills on our drinks and the check also took a while.The restaurant was not crowded.  Since this restaurant is rated high I am willing to try them again and hope for a different experience.I will update my review at that time."}
{"text":"I really liked the atmosphere and the customer service deserved 5 stars.  Everyone was very attentive from the hostess to our waitress to other staff members.  The reason for my 3 stars is the food.  The clam chowder was really good but the soft shell crab sandwich was just ok.  Maybe my expectations were too high, but the price was not worth the sandwich.  They also don't offer seafood dinners, which is what I was hoping for.  Everything was in the form of a sandwich."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with Sea Level, especially if Fin and Fino is booked for the weekend. There's a lot of reviews for SL so I'm just gonna keep mine short and sweet --  1) It's kinda dark in the restaurant, so be prepared to pull out a flashlight if you can't read your menu. However, the decor is nice and the servers welcoming! They're always going to check and make sure that your night is a good night.  2) The raw oysters are definitely cheaper here than at Fin and Fino, but there's a smaller selection. I always go for the Sea Level oysters as I like mine briny and salty rather than sweet.  3) Don't hesitate to ask for suggestions. The menu seems large but there's a lot of good stuff in it -- the lobster roll is quite tasty and the fish entrees are always perfectly cooked.  4) Save room for dessert -- and definitely share them. They're large and tasty and a good way to close out the night."}
{"text":"Seriously regret we didn't have time for an entire meal here. Service was spectacular and made the experience without anything else factored in. The cocktail menu was solid, and we tried a few different options, all very tasty. We only had time for apps, but those were quite good - the fritters were just right, full of flavor, and the tacos and oysters received rave reviews as well. Seriously regret we didn't get to do the entire dinner here, the menu looked fantastic and everything delivered above expectations. Look forward to getting back on a future trip out this way!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome. Great atmosphere and excellent service. Our waitress was very friendly and accommodating. The food was delicious, especially the clam chowder. Being from New England, it's hard to find any chowder like back home but this certainly gave any New England clam chowder a run for it's money. Overall great experience and we will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"I'm amazed to find such an authentic Southern seafood place in a metro area. Not quite as \"fusion\" as one might expect.  It was a nice experience, and enjoyed the atmosphere a great deal. I highly recommend this in you're in downtown looking for seafood."}
{"text":"Really enjoy Sea Level! The oyster happy keeps us coming back for more. It is beautiful inside, the food is beautiful and they are supporting local resources. Highly recommend going to Sea Level for your next meal out!"}
{"text":"Wonderful experience.  Great service, friendly staff. Tasty and well presented. Went for a Oyster rasting event and was pleasantly suprised."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner here last night while visiting Charlotte. Food was excellence and the service was fast and attentive. Paella was delish."}
{"text":"Sea Level makes sure that you have a positive experience, from the easy validated parking in Hearst Tower to the attentive service while dining. Even during the hustle and bustle of Queens Feast Restaurant Week we enjoyed a relaxing meal and interesting drinks.  Raw oysters for an appetizer was a great way to start before traditional shrimp and grits, but it was the chocolate pecan bread pudding that stole the show. A rectangular slice that was equally sweet and gooey, I definitely wanted a nap afterwards. My dining companion ordered the lemon tart for dessert and when the crust was too hard to even be cut through with a knife the server kindly brought us another order of the bread pudding, which had a bit of a different texture, as it was sliced from a new part of the pan, so the variety in experience was a welcome surprise!  Left Hand's milk stout on nitro pour is always a welcome option on a tap list and a good substitute for the Flying Dog oyster stout that was on the menu. Fun cocktails and true-to-Uptown experience. Nicely done. While it isn't the same kind of experience one might have at an on-the-water seafood place, Sea Level is a great option in Charlotte."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots to go with my husband for date night. Free parking when validated and stays open late. It's hard to find places that don't close at 9 or 9:30. I'm a oyster newbie and they are patient and describe them to me every time I come. In fairness we do splurge when coming here but you can reasonably get a nice meal if you don't do like us for a fair price. I like the casual unpretentious feel of the place. The staff are awesome."}
{"text":"I have now been for lunch three times and have been impressed. Fish tacos are great as is the chowder.   Service is friendly and prompt. They deliver a well prepared, modestly priced seafood lunch promptly. They understand their clientele at lunch and do a great job.   I haven't been for dinner but understand they have great oyster specials and a great beer selection."}
{"text":"I have been here several times (all for lunch), and this spot is fantastic! Food is amazing and fresh, great lunch specials. Staff has always been superb. I definitely need to stop by here some time for their happy hour!"}
{"text":"Favorite brunch and dinner, hands down! Amazing attentive service. Fantastic cocktails--the Bloody Mary with shrimp and pork belly is to die for. Brunch Punch is great too. Sea Level never disappoints."}
{"text":"Expertly crafted farm to table seafood prepared by people who really know what seafood should taste like. From the first call we made to see if they had a table to the final course of the night the service was exceptional. Our server could not have done a finer  job helping us navigate their menu. She offered honest and intelligent insight into every question we asked about their various dishes.  The oysters were fresh and delicious. The flounder awesome. The restaurant menu was quite well laid out with something for everybody even though strange creatures who go to a seafood restaurant and want a hamburger. LOL  I always love a seafood restaurant that doesn't have everything on the menu all the time. It's a great sign that they're buying really fresh fish all the time. There's a reason why special dishes are special dishes and it's not because they've bought something mediocre in bulk. This place got it and got it right from the oysters that started our meal to the Keylime ice cream that ended it with everything in between perfect!  If you haven't been here yet you need to get here now. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great service, interesting menu with lots of options, tasty food, solid oyster selection, and a good bar."}
{"text":"Enjoyed some oysters at the bar while we waited for our table. They have oysters from 10 different places from which to choose. Once we were seated, we started with tempura shrimp and corn fritters. The shrimp was incredible and a healthy portion for a starter. The corn fritters were fried perfectly and the dipping sauce was delicious. We ordered snapper that was cooked perfectly and a daily special. The salmon was also very good. A lively atmosphere and great food."}
{"text":"Went for brunch this morning after reading some reviews. It did not disappoint! I don't eat oysters but my husband said they were up there with the best he's ever had. Service and food were top notch. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! My mother and I went out for a late Mother's Day dinner and enjoyed the evening. There was also live music that night near the restaurant to add to the scene. I started off with fried oyster tacos (This was my first time trying oysters), and I ENJOYED them! For my main entree, I had the catfish Rueben. Both menu items were fresh and hot! I Would recommend to anyone going out with a small group or couple.   Only down side was the delayed service from the waiters, but then again, it was a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Sooooo good!  We sat at the oyster bar and started our evening with two dozen Sea Level oysters. And - it's the little things that matter - service of cocktail and mignonette was very nice.  The hubs got a local brew, and I enjoyed a perfectly made slightly dirty vodka martini (followed by another later...couldn't help myself!).  Our first time at this cool place was all about sampling, so we went for small plates and decided on duck tacos, steamed shrimp bun and mussels in garlic wine sauce.  Everything was excellent.  Complex recipes, just the right amount of spice, and a smokey fish saucey mussel broth that coaxed the deep flavors out of each mussel (intense!).  Next time, I will try something completely new from the excellent menu - but I will definitely make it a point to arrive between 4 and 7 to enjoy $1 oysters (which were smallish, but decent).  The couple next to us ordered the $125 tower, which was gorgeous!  A gigantic impressive 3-tiered display of chilled oysters, shrimp, lobster, mussels and tuna tartare with caviar.  A bit pricey for our wallets, but it looked fabulous.  Check out the bricks over the back doorway in the kitchen. Each signed brick represents a tower sold!  Service is friendly, team service.  Nicely paced, attentive and tidy.  Lots of people milling around, ready to serve up more goodness.  I'm loving Sea Level after my first visit, and hope it's around for a while!  Go, shuckers, go!  We love you!"}
{"text":"We came here on New Year's Eve. We had great service. I love that we could make a reservation with Yelp! My cocktail was a seasonal drink. It was nice but not memorable. My husband and I thought the Appetizers were amazing! I will probably order more of these next time. I had an oyster steam bun and he ate a duck taco. He also enjoyed an oyster shooter. Our entrees were just ok. I had a lobster roll and fries. I wish they would make the lobster roll Connecticut style (lobster meat sauteed with clarified butter; no mayo) instead of New England style (mayo). My husband's main entree was shrimp and grits. He said it was average. I would come back and try something else... definitely more appetizers but I wish they would really consider offering a Connecticut-style lobster roll (sorry for my plea as I know I'm being redundant). Also, their decor was modern and their bathrooms were clean."}
{"text":"The oysters are always good, but the service is so lacking recently. Everytime we have gone, our server tends to disappear for 15-20 minutes and by the time they do turn up any desire to order another drink or dessert is usually replaced with a desire to go somewhere else. I usually don't mind spending $150-200 for 2-3 dozen oysters and some wine, but when the service is lacking, the money spent doesn't seem worth it. The food besides the oysters is hit or miss mainly due to consistency, the lobster roll can be tender but can also be like eating a boot sole, I guess it depends on the time of week you go and who's actually preparing your food. Another thing that is inconsistent is, if we do order oysters and hot items, the servers don't really check with the table on what they want first. It would make sense to have oysters first so the hot food doesn't get cold, but on two separate occasions now our server took it into her own hands and placed the hot food first, so we got our hot items and then a tray of oysters maybe 3 minutes after. Finish the oysters then enjoy your cold hot items? I'm sure I'll be back but I really hope the service improves!"}
{"text":"I've eaten lunch twice at Sea Level, in the past month:  here were my two experiences with the food and service.  My first visit, the service was horrible and slow, with a server who acted as if it was a chore to refill drinks.  The restaurant was not busy, so it's hard to understand why this person was so unpleasant.   My second visit, which was yesterday, the service was outstanding, quick without rushing us and very pleasant.    Unfortunately the food experience has varied as well:  Catfish Rueben:  Very Good \"Natural Cola\": Not Good Corn Fritters:  Excellent Duck Taco:  Very Bad, so salty I couldn't eat it Shrimp Steam Bun:  Not Good, shrimp has an odd flavor and the dough-to-shrimp ration is off, meaning you get mainly steamed dough.  I also could not finish it due to the odd taste.  I am an adventurous eater with eclectic tastes, but the menu at this restaurant needs tweaking and the kitchen and waitstaff need consistent instruction.  Based on being served two items I found inedible, I can only give two stars."}
{"text":"I have been dying to check out this restaurant. The food didn't disappoint, but the service definitely did. My two girlfriends and I had reservations for 7pm. We did not get seated at our table until 8pm. It was very annoying and I just don't get the point of reservations if they don't seat you. The staff was very apologetic and gave us two free appetizers, which was nice of them!  The apps we had were corn fritters, oysters, calamari and ceviche. The corn fritters were fantastic and they had a taste of something I couldn't quite put my finger on but it was good. Loved the oysters just fantastic. Super fresh. I'm not normally a fan of ceviche but this was light and tangy and I really liked it. The calamari was good. The briney stuff it was in made for an interesting taste.  For the main we had Shrimp and Grits, Catfish and Short Ribs. All were delicious. The grits were perfection. I tried my friend's catfish and I expected it to be super fishy but it wasn't at all. The ribs were melt in your mouth! So good.  Even though the service was super slow the staff did right by it. I will definitely go back here again."}
{"text":"Had dinner with a friend and colleague here last night. Picked it due to Yelp reviews. We were not disappointed. The mussels to begin were large and plentiful. The broth they had on them was mouth watering before the first bite. Then came the salmon on black eyed peas for an entree. Dear lord almighty!  Something special for sure. I always like to compliment a good wait staff and this one is easy. Johnny on the spot, pleasant with just the right amount of chit chat. There is a lot to choose from in downtown Charlotte, choose Sea Level NC and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Being COMPLETELY new to North Carolina, I was a bit skeptical about going to the number one ranked place for happy hour as I think that the best places usually aren't ranked number one.... and I suppose that that's still probably true as I didn't get to go to every happy hour hot spot... but I can say that this place was AWESOME!  We had a group of 5 of us... mixed eaters/drinker styles... we sat outside, which is honestly a strange place to be because you can't really make out wether you're inside or outside.... but anyway, here we were \"outside\", and our lovely server \"Kierrah\" greeted us... she's a major reason we had such a phenomenal experience... I'm not sure how the other servers are, but she was so absolutely incredible with service that I might be disappointed if I returned and it wasn't her.  Anyways, they update their menu very frequently. And the first thing I noticed was that they had two cocktail options that were charitable. If you bought one of these $10 cocktails, the business would donate $5 to Hurricane Irma efforts. Superb. I love it.  There were, however, much more attractive cocktail options to me that were so unique and creative that I had to give them a try. I loved them and tried my friends' and loved theirs too. Major props.  My friends were super stoked about the $1 oyster happy hour special and everyone enjoyed the different food they ordered... wait just kidding, my boyfriend wasn't a fan of the shrimp poboy that he ordered (but he's French and super picky)... anyways, everyone else was happy! I believe a Reuben, tartare, and clam chowder were ordered.  Great place to stop for drinks and meet up with people!  The music was GREAT!!!! I nearly forgot! And that was one of the reasons I was okay with stopping here! You can always tell a lot by a places taste in music."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre but the ambience was nice. I left a 20% tip for the waiter and when I checked my bank account the next morning I saw that he added an extra $12 to his tip. I went in and spoke to the manager the same day and he made sure to refund my money and gave me gift cards.I appreciate him trying to rectify the situation but I still won't be returning."}
{"text":"Sea Level is great. It's nicely located in the heart of uptown close to attractions such as Belk Theatre and Spectrum Center. The interior of the restaurant is gorgeous. I came here for brunch and had the Maine Muscles. The white wine & garlic broth that the muslces were cooked in was tremendous. It was expensive so I wouldn't eat there all the time but I would probably consider Sea Level the best sea food restaurant in Charlotte."}
{"text":"The service was amazing, the food very high quality but the flavors were way off. Too much anise in the pork belly slider!! Will have to come back to try more items. This place looks great, really love the ambiance."}
{"text":"Service was terrific. From hostess stand to wait-staff, everyone was great. Food was fine. Nothing spectacular -- good value."}
{"text":"Sea Level has a great ambiance and menu. Our table ordered a few of the Oyster Steamed Buns (which were absolute perfection), the Snapper Ceviche (very good, but a bit too sweet for a true ceviche fan who loves that acidic taste), the Sea Level Oysters (love love how SL has their own sauce to accompany. This added a cool flavor), the Shrimp and Grits (very average, the chorizo gravy was very bland for a southern palette). Our waitress, Kiara (sp?) was so bubbly. She added a great touch to our experience. Overall, we will be back for sure! Thanks SL."}
{"text":"Outstanding!! Great food, very fresh!!!  Great Service!! Waiter (s) were very prompt and friendly... definitely will be back again!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. $1 oyster happy hours every day!  Sea Level oysters are amazing. The service is always with a smile. Very attentive. All of the food is tasty and worth the prices which also aren't bad. Not a fan of the lobster roll, seasonal I think but I wouldn't waste my time here with sandwiches anyway."}
{"text":"We were there last night with a group of 8. Arrived with no wait at 6:30PM table was ready. This is restaurant week in Charlotte at participating restaurants and Sea Level was one of them. Menu is preset at $35.00 each for this with appetizer, entree and desert. our service was outstanding. Everyone enjoyed their choice of food. Parking is free in The Hearst Tower parking garage, The restaurant is on the 3dr level. The restaurant will validate your parking receipt for free parking. This is one of the many must try if your are in uptown Charlotte."}
{"text":"I loved it. Actually if you pressed me for something negative to say I would have a hard time coming up with something. The duck taco was the best. Good wine list and solid seafood."}
{"text":"Wow, where do I begin? I went to Sea Level a few nights ago for dinner with a friend. We were promptly and cheerfully greeted upon entering. This restaurant has a beautiful modern atmosphere with a trendy twist. The shift manager made a point to stop by our table and ask us how our food and service was. This was such a nice touch. It was pretty busy that night and we really felt taken care of. I wish I could remember the name of the cocktail I ordered but it was delicious. The server made lots of wonderful recommendations and I was super thrilled with what I decided to get.  This was such a nice treat for me and my friend! I will be sure to recommend this place to all of my friends and family in the area. We will definitely be back !"}
{"text":"Came to Sea Level for the first time.   I really enjoyed the experience.   It was smaller than I expected but really good.     Food -   We started off with a half dozen oysters.   They have a good selection from different areas of the country.  For our mains I had the Paella which was really good.  Don't let the size fool you as you get a lot of food.   Also there is an abundance of seafood.   We also had the shrimp and grits.   Again good portion and the flavor was really good.     Service -   The service was very good.  The waiter was attentive and quickly took care of our needs.     Atmosphere -   Really cool looking place.  They have a outside seating area as well as a bar and main dining room.  It was a little smaller than I thought it would be.   It is very inviting.     Want to come back for happy hour oysters.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"OK let me start by saying i always try and stay away from seafood restaurants in cities that are not near the coast. I lived at the beach for years so my expectations of fresh good seafood is very high but we went with another couple and those chose the restaurant so i didnt have a choice.  We started off with a few apps, 2 orders of Oysters Noda, 2 orders of Duck Taco's and the 2 orders of the pork belly. The Oysters Noda came out and the toppings on the oysters were cooked but the oyster was almost raw. This app is a play off of Oysters Rockefeller which i love, we asked the waitress the oysters aren't cooked but the toppings are  and her response is thats they way we do it and my response was no its not cause the table next to us had the same exact app and i asked them if it was cooked all the way and they said yes so she took them back.  So when they brought them back they did not make new ones they just popped the ones we were given into the oven which over cooked all the toppings and was just not good at all.  I read the reviews on the duck tacos being salty and yesssss they are so you better like salt. The pork belly was awesome very good. The corn-fritters are amazinggggggg.  My wife got the smoked salmon risotto and the salmon was all mixed in not a whole piece and it was sooo smoky she could not finish it. I had the lobster roll and it was average at best. The shrimp po-boy was very good according to the guys i was with. The kicker was at the end were i ordered a specialty cocktail from their menu. This one cocktail i was looking at had laphroaig in the recipe and me being a scotch lover asked the waitress just to make sure thats what it was and she told me no its not scotch its their version of a soda water that has a effervescent taste to it.  I asked are you sure i have never heard of that and she said absolutely, well i ordered the drink and it was scotch.  Our waitress was not familiar with the menu and the items on the food and drink menu's and the service was very very slow and they were not busy at all.  I can not recommend this place on the items we had their other menu items might be more appetizing but the ones mentioned in my review i would not order."}
{"text":"We decided to check out Sea Level pre-Book of Mormon last weekend. We arrived on the early side (6:15ish) so no problem getting a seat at the bar. They do not take reservations, fyi. Around 7 or so the place got slammed and I mean SLAMMED. So plan accordingly.   The space is really nice inside, they did a great job converting it from what was once City Tavern and then LaVecchia's (hard to believe it's the same space!). There's also a patio for those nice weather days. I loved the vibe when we first arrived, but like I said it got crazy in there. The bartenders were friendly and quick to take our order.   We decided to do a couple rounds of appetizers - including the pork belly steamed bun and shrimp steamed bun, shrimp & grits, and the apple endive salad. Everything we tried was tasty - the only complaint is nothing came out hot. Luke warm at best. They need to add some food runners! We could see the kitchen window and food was piling up.   Considering they've been open just a month, I think they'll work out the kinks. I will happily visit again to try some of their entrees and hopefully the giant brownie I spied at another table!"}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday and I enjoyed their fish tacos. Really nice ambiance, prime location uptown in between tons of night time action... great place...good food"}
{"text":"Wow! Nicely surprised in a couple of ways!  1) location - awesome and convenient - right across from Belk Theater  2) décor/vibe - really pulls you in - felt like I had been transported from the busy city  After a great show at the Belk, it was a no brainer to come here for some light post theater eats.  Sam was a pro - he greeted us, asked if we had been before and offered to guide us through the menu. We decided to sit outside as the weather was perfect even though the music was bit loud and clubby.  After a couple of Jam Session drafts our food was brought out. What we tried:  Corn Fritters - a full size portion is eight - they are dense, crispy and have a little pop of fresh corn flavor - totally addictive.  Tempura Shrimp - very big portion of tempura battered shrimp drizzled with their spicy aioli - no tails or veins to mess with - just lots of tender pieces of shrimp.  Fish Taco - I'd have to say the best thing we ate - just well balanced flavors with a light char/grill marks on the fish pieces - I could have eaten 2-3 more!  What I didn't like - not much - this place is pretty dope - definitely want to go back for Oyster Happy Hour - my only advice would be to switch up some of the sauces. The spicy Aioli was served with two of the dishes - would have preferred at least one of them was vinegar or citrus based - a little acid to take away some of the heavy/ greasy feel you get from deep fried starters. Just my two cents. Otherwise big fan!!!"}
{"text":"Oysters were amazing!  Stay away from tempura shrimp appetizer.  Super fried and little shrimp.  Sauce was good though!  Nice atmosphere.  Good cocktails but pricey."}
{"text":"Great to see restaurant packed on a Tuesday night. Bar area was over stuffed at 6pm. Dinner was good - Not amazing but grilled Salmon never is  - left a little still hungry actually.  Food came out fast and servers were all very nice. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Amazing food and fantastic service.  Nothing we would change about this place.   Came on Saturday for lunch and sat outside on the patio which was beautiful.  Had shrimp cocktail, Bloody Mary (which was perfectly spicy), fish taco and shrimp bun. My husband had the po' boy but added fried oysters and said it was phenomenal.   Also, got the honey mule for a drink and it was fantastic.  The perfect balance after the spicy Bloody Mary and cocktail sauce!   We will be back!!"}
{"text":"We came here for seafood and had a good calamari chow chow and corn fritters to start. The chow chow was good but the corn fritters didn't have much corn taste at all. Our waitress was not the fastest and we waited a while for my husbands beer.  I got the shrimp and grits- 6 shrimp and a bit on the salty side. This could have been nice but the service was lacking."}
{"text":"I gave it two stars for decor and cocktail- I loved the look of the restaurant and we sat outside which was very nice.  I ordered the meow mule which was delicious and I enjoyed it very much. As far as the food.... BIG DISAPPOINTMENT! We had shrimp tempura which very soggy and were battered more like fried shrimp than tempura.  I had the salmon which had little flavor and the braised collards were chewy and tough. Expensive menu that was not worth it.  I would not go back except for a cocktail."}
{"text":"Great oyster place with friendly and efficient staff!  The oyster happy hour deals are worth an early visit.  Lobster roll, if a bit skimpy compared to the Maine version, is wonderful and thankfully without fillers.  A fine addition to uptown dining, especially with parking validation."}
{"text":"I love this place! Located in the Hearst Tower, it's a nice new addition to the Charlotte seafood scene. (Tip: Make sure to keep your parking deck ticket for validation)  Cons: Some of the dishes were fairly salty even for seafood.  Pros: The mussels were pretty good. I enjoyed soaking my slices of toasted baguette into the sauce. The tempura shrimp and tuna tartare were also good. My favorite thing would have to be the oysters! Although they were smaller than I'm used to, they were flavorful and not gritty like some places. They literally melted in my mouth!!! Lastly, great ambience!!!  Aside from the food, one thing that will make me a loyal patron is their service. My friend had arrived early for our date. She sat inside and ordered like 5-6 dishes. When I arrived with my aunt, I sat on the patio and got drinks not knowing my friend was already at the restaurant. Because the weather was so good I convinced her to join me on the patio. When I asked the staff if they could move all her food over to the outdoor patio, they did not even bat an eye! They did it with smiling faces and had no hesitation in accommodating us. That is superior customer service! My aunt has already recommended this place to her friends!"}
{"text":"Nailed the fish tacos!  I ordered the duck salad, without the duck.. nailed that, too!  Next up, Catfish.  I mentioned to the server that I was avoiding fried food, so she offered it grilled.  This place has a modern atmosphere and menu.  This will be my Charlotte go-to spot!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Solid start to the service with a miserable finish.   My wife and I went to Sea Level on Saturday night 2/4. When we walked in around 8, the restaurant was very busy, but no one was waiting to be seated. 2 spots opened up at the oyster bar and we went and sat down.   Our waiter (one of the bartenders) came over pretty quickly, took a drink and appetizer order and went off to take care of the rest of his tables. During his few visits back to our table, he was knowledgeable, gave great recommendations, and helped us with anything we needed.   It was after our initial order that service started to suffer. The time between ordering something (my wife and I decided to do small plates) and receiving your order increased throughout our meal. We initially had to wait about 5 minutes for a hot dish and 5 or so minutes for Oysters. After a few dishes, we ordered the squid chow chow, waited for about 25 minutes and finally the manager came over to tell us the kitchen was running behind and that she would comp the squid chow chow off of our bill...this never occurred.  We ordered some of the buns and a final two oysters for my wife. At this point, our waiter was well into the weeds and hadn't visited our table for at least 15 minutes. The new bottle of water had been forgotten, and the final two oysters my wife had wanted to order had never been called in.   Our waiter visited and at this point in the night and we asked for the check (we had to ask someone else to get our waiter's attention). We figured the missing oysters would be more trouble than they were worth (as long as they weren't on the bill). Our waiter went away again to get our check. Between him printing our check and delivering it to us, I watched him make 2 drinks, deliver them, and run some food. Total time before asking for the check and receiving it? 10 minutes. The squid chow chow the manager said she'd comp? Not comped and at this point we were just ready to go. We signed the bill and left.  The food at Sea Level was great. The Squid Chow Chow is a must try as well as the mussels in the garlic wine sauce.   The service could have been much better. We weren't comped something that was promised, we had an order disappear into the ether, and it became increasingly difficult to get served."}
{"text":"Anyone for seafood?  YES!!!  How about seafood at Sea Level?   NOOooOO!!  Why not?   Because: (1) oysters are just OK; (2) super greasy, bland food; (3) less than stellar service (we got charged for another table's more expensive meal); overall, we should have spent our $65 before tip for 2 elsewhere.   I was super excited to learn that there is a seafood / oyster house down the street from where we live because I LOVE SEAFOOD, especially fresh raw oysters.  If they have them, I'm ordering them!  I've been to Sea Level a few times and my advice would be to just stick with the $1 oyster happy hour and pass on everything else.    Good ambience.  I can't speak much for the indoor dining because I prefer outdoor patio dining if it's available.  I will say that for this being a newer restaurant, each of the patio tables I've sat at were wobbly, which would be a vestige of an older establishment so it's a little bewildering.  Otherwise, the patio is tucked back from the street and if you go after rush hour on a weekday, it serves as a calm escape from the bustle of Uptown.  Not good service.  Our server got my order wrong, she served us duck tacos instead of a duck salad.  They were quick to serve the salad and offered the tacos complimentarily, which was nice of them.  Our server only came back sporadically to check up on us, which is tolerable except when we asked for a sauce for our bland crispy shrimp, they never brought it.    Finally, we typically don't review of check before signing except to calculate the tip. I wondered why our meal could be $90 for 4 oysters, 2 salads and a crispy rock shrimp order...   When I looked at the ticket, I noticed that we were charged for someone else's meal.  We had to find our absent-minded waitress to correct it and even after that, she didn't seem very apologetic for actually overcharging our credit card for the wrong meal.  If I hadn't checked, it would never have been corrected!    Greasy, bland food.  We wanted seafood because we were looking for something on the lighter side but boy were we wrong!  We had:  ++  oysters.  We ordered the Sea Level cheap ones ($1.75/oyster) and the Delaware most expensive ones ($3.75/oyster) to do a comparison.  Although the Delaware ones were a little less briny, they weren't much different in taste.    OYSTER TIP:  You can get: AYCE equal quality oysters at Georges Brasserie during their Sunday brunch; equal quality for cheaper at Pearlz Oyster Bar with better service and better food; AMAZING oysters at Baku; better quality at Capital Grille or BLT Steakhouse.    ++  crispy shrimp. The sauce was really bland and the shrimps were heavily breaded and soggy.  You can get better at Baku, Fahrenheit, Cowfish, or Mr. Tokyo Sushi.  ++  Caesar salad.  It was a huge portion but the dressing was about the same quality as grocery-store Ranch dressing;  not even Newman's brand.  It was very bland and mostly mayonnaise without the extra flavor.  All steakhouses do Caesar better as does Pearlz Oyster Bar.    ++  duck salad.  The salad is a huge portion and the dressing is a sweet cranberry-based dressing with candied pecans but the duck is very, very greasy and bland.  The heaviness of the duck really defeated the purpose of the salad altogether.    ++  duck taco.  I can't really hold this against them because it was complimentary, after all but the steamed bun was very soggy and the grease that came off the taco from the duck made my stomach churn.  I don't mind grease,  I love bacon and pork belly done right but I've never typically found duck to be so greasy ever.  The flavor of the plum sauce is sweet and goes well with the duck but seriously, it was drowned out by the greasiness.   We walked away regretting the meal and thinking that we could have been more satisfied eating at a drive-thru chain for $15 or worse, heating up a frozen pizza for $9.  I don't mind paying $$ for a delicious meal but when the food is bad topped off with bad service, it makes me feel ripped off, which is exactly how we felt after our latest meal at Sea Level.  I won't be back but I do recommend just sticking to the $1 oysters at happy hour if you want your dining experience to be commensurate to the cost of your meal.    UPDATE:  increase from 2.5 stars to 3 stars.  Immediately after I posted my review, the owner reached out to me to offer his apologies and asked us to return.  Any owner who personally seeks out to ensure that a customer experience is positive definitely deserves kudos for seeking to advocate good customer service.  At the end of the day, all we really want is to ensure that we get what we bargained for.  An owner who assumes accountability means boosted consumer confidence in an establishment.  We will return and update the review accordingly when our schedules permit."}
{"text":"Outstanding meal. Started w a Bullit Old Fashioned. Made perfectly. Best Clam Chowder I've had. Fred Pink Snapper for the main. The whole meal was outstanding. Great recommendations from the bartender Andrew. I would definitely return. Well with the drive from the airport."}
{"text":"Way too noisy - unless you are looking for a bar-like atmosphere.  On the other hand, the food was awesome.  Not the place to go for a business or intimate dinner though."}
{"text":"I had dinner on 7/28 and it was delicious!  I'm from SC so seafood is my life.  The restaurant has a great feel and appeal and our waitress was awesome.  Very friendly and informative and what she didn't know she went to find out.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I visited sea level for a friends birthday with his wife and my wife.  We came on a Friday night with bad weather out side but a huge positive was you don't even have to go outside to get to this place if you park in Hearst tower.  They validate too so you can park there for free.  Our friends were seated when we arrived right at the front door so a freezing draft hit us every time it opened, not that big a deal though.  So on to the food.  We ordered oysters, salmon tartar, a few different tacos, corn fritters, two lobster rolls and paella for one.  So I was the person that ordered the paella and thought that it would be tough to make it good with only say 15-20 minutes to prepare it and boy was I right.  They did a couple things correct, the bottom of the rice had the perfect amount of crust, the rice was cooked well as was the fish but there was just no flavor.  The dish needed salt, saffron, red pepper flakes and pepper.  There was no fresh herbs, no seasoning, no nothing.  So for $30 I got a decently cooked pan of rice, some white fish and shrimp.  The lobster rolls were tasty, very small but tasty, for $22 you would expect more but I am sensing a theme with this place.  We enjoyed the apps we had, solid, not spectacular.  The tartar and tacos are the way to go here, the entrees are overpriced and underwhelming.  The service was good."}
{"text":"This place has been on my bucket list since it opened and it did not disappoint! The fiancé made a reservation for 7:30 on a Friday night, but we were surprised to find that we didn't even need it. There were a good number of tables available but the place had a good energy. We chose to sit outside since it was a nice evening.   Our server came over after we had just a few moments with the menu and we both ordered cocktails. I had the meow mule and my fiancé ordered the smoked old fashioned. I really like the mule cause it was light, not too sugary, and decently boozy.   Since this is one of the few true seafood places in Charlotte, we ordered the Snapper and the Trigger fish dishes, planning to switch halfway through the meal. The trigger had a nice crablike taste to it, which our waiter explained is because they eat  crustaceans. It came with a yummy sauce and rice. The snapper had crispy skin, was buttery, and came over a wonderful succotash.   Prices are a little higher than I'd like to pay for the average dinner out, but it's good quality and nice for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Stopped in one Friday after work, and was really pleased. The service was friendly and the food was great.   I had the shrimp steam buns with a side of fries. The shrimp reminded me more of a deviled crab, but was really good. The fries were your typical run of the mill hand cut fries, which is just what I wanted.   My boyfriend got the shrimp po'boy with slaw. It was pretty good, no frills but that's exactly what he wanted, a good old fashioned po'boy.   We also tried the sea level oysters which run $1.75 normally but were on special for $1 (it's a happy hour thing from 4-7). They were delicious, easily worth $1 each.   The feel of the place was kind of hard to gauge because it was 4:30 on a Friday -- not very busy. I'd like to go back later one night to see how it feels at peak business hours. Also curious to see if the service suffers any when busy because it was top notch when I went.   I definitely plan to go back and definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Some of the best oysters I've ever had! Love how they do their oyster menu and how knowledgeable everyone is! The rest of our meal was fantastic can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Sea Level more than I did, as it has all the ingredients to be one of Charlotte's best restaurants. But on a recent visit during Queen's Feast Restaurant Week, I was only moderately impressed. While the corn fritters and clam chowder we ordered for our appetizers were both outstanding, the main courses that followed were somewhat underwhelming. I ordered the Catfish Cioppino, which was bland and somewhat sparse, while my wife enjoyed a tasty plate of Beef Short Ribs. We ended the meal with a delicious pair of Lemon Tarts, served on a flaky graham cracker crust.  (Full disclosure: my last dish of Cioppino was at San Francisco's Tadich Grill, so the bar was a little high.)  Sea Level has a cool and trendy interior with a great ambiance -- boisterous, but not so noisy that you can't have a conversation. The wine and cocktail list is extensive, and there's a solid selection of local and regional craft brews in bottles and on tap. Service was friendly and efficient, which is about as much as you can expect during Restaurant Week.   We'll definitely be giving Sea Level another chance to impress, but during Queen's Feast, the package was just OK."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Sea Level last night for the first time. We got there and took a seat at the bar. We immediately noticed that tons of gnats were flying around us, which definitely turned us off. We ordered some drinks and they came quickly. I had the Meow Mule, which was delicious.   My husband ordered a few Sea Level oysters since he has never had raw oysters on the half shell. He loved them! He also ordered a burger with fries and thought they were delicious. I can attest that the fries were fresh and yummy.  I ordered the shrimp and grits and was definitely disappointed. The grits were dry and tasteless. There were tons of grits, but with them being so tasteless, it needed more gravy or sauce to make it palatable. The shrimp were small and decent, but they were a tad overcooked. The sauce was tasty, but like I said, there was not enough of it. I ate the shrimp and the sauce and left half the grits.   Overall, I'd definitely like to go back and try the lobster roll, but I will not be getting the shrimp and grits again."}
{"text":"First of all y'all, I'm not fluent in the language of seafood. However, whenever I see food, I eat it. The first time I tried raw oysters was two years ago at the The Olde Bar, in Philadelphia. Few weeks ago, I had my first oyster in Charlotte here at the Sea Level NC. I got 2 oysters from Sea Level, NC ($1each.) For the second time, I was very intimidated, I tried to copycat people seated around me, and I did good. I also had the Corn Fritters, I think I'm hooked.  What you need to know about Sea Level NC: - Happy hour #1 Monday - Saturday 4pm-7pm $1 oysters (from Sea Level, NC.) - Happy hour #2 Monday - Saturday 10pm to midnight $1 oysters (from Sea Level, NC.) - Daily fresh catch. - Saturday AND Sunday Brunch 11am-4pm. - FREE parking (2hr validation at lunchtime and 3hr at dinnertime.) - Accept reservations, walk-in and carry outs.  Four Yelps."}
{"text":"This is a nice place. Definitely a fancy place. The oysters and the waiters knowledge of the oysters surpassed any place I've ever.  The only thing i didn't like was the portion size of our entrees. We got the papaya and for three grown men it didn't fill ya up even though it was amazing.  We also ordered the mussels and they were cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"The food was really good and the restaurant was very nice and clean. Andrew was our server and he was wonderful!"}
{"text":"Decided to come here randomly on a Friday night. We walked in with no reservations and were directed to the beautiful bar area where there was plenty of room and comfortable bar stools. We were immediately greeted by the waiter, and proceeded to order drinks. I had the Meow Mule and my boyfriend got an oyster shooter. We both enjoyed our drinks. We ordered small plates for dinner, but had no complaints on anything. The duck taco was great, but the clam chowder was my favorite! My boyfriend ordered Caesar salad with salmon and LOVED it. The homemade croutons really put their salad on another level! He also had the sea level burger with fries and he was beyond impressed. Overall, it was a really great experience. They made sure our parking deck ticket was validated and everyone wished us a goodnight. Will definitely be returning here again."}
{"text":"Visiting from New York. Have to say this place was amazing! Food was great and staff were some of the nicest people we've met. We had a party of 11 for lunch and had a little bit of everything we could (soup, oysters, sandwiches, tacos, shrimp/grits, dessert) . Couldn't find a bad bite if you tried to. If we are ever in North Carolina, first meal will be had here."}
{"text":"Had the best time! Food ,service, drinks all impeccable. Visiting from Nashville and heard about this place and it was as good as we heard. We will be back. Cool vibe and atmosphere  as well"}
{"text":"So great! As a pescatarian, I was blown away. So many fish and veggie-friendly options and they were all fantastic. Made last minute reservations for a group of 5 and we covered quite a bit of the menu (oysters... twice, crab legs, chowder, and ceviche - not including our entrees or dessert). Everything was cooked so well and full of flavor. Nate was awesome. Would definitely come back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"5 stars for the owner contact via Yelp. 5 stars for the goal service and trying to ensure customers are met with satisfaction.  4 stars for not presenting info that the HEARST parking deck is free for lunch or dinner. I was worried it was only for dinner and drove by it twice.  4 stars for the french fry that was so hard it cut my molar gum area where the wisdom tooth is located and was extracted back in 1997. Yeah... how do I know it happened. I kept feeling a tingle and once I tried putting a tad of ketchup on another fry and that salt got into the OPEN wound..... whew doggie!   That's what I get for eating while driving.   Anywhoo, I'm ecstatic that you can get the Connecticut - true NE style - solely butter by asking the morning before they open. They set aside enough lobster that I thought it was generous and so did a colleague. I'll try the chowder and maybe a slider but honey~~~   I will get to brunch and have a LOBSTER ROLL with only butter SANS mayo over the weekend.  I'm glad they are open for the weekend nowadays with Brunch offerings.   Also, the little bookmark with upcoming events placed in my bag is super cute. They are hosting events 1st Mondays for the next four months.   Oh, a few rude customers  Sweet security/sheriff guy working the parking deck.  Preferred Parking has some good people working here as I misplaced my parking ticket and they got it all straighten out.  Inside the building the security staff was pleasant in escorting me to the garage entry so I wouldn't walk up the exit.  Recap: Don't miss the toasted Lobster roll as the bread is the right style and right about of toasting. The lobster is NOT langostino. This is real sweet meat lobster. It's $19/per lobster roll.  Comes with a side of handcut fries. Next time I'll seek out what the substitutions are NOT because the fries are lacking but because I want to try other things.   I called before picking up and it was ready immediately after I paid so I'm happy they were prompt."}
{"text":"Had been really looking forward to dining here. We arrived for brunch to celebrate the early-alcohol bill (better than before but still a bit backward at this day and age...) and the waiter wasn't aware of the time change, plus the actual alcohol selection was limited. I tried both the brunch cocktails and they were refreshing, but actually a little light on the booze.   The seafood paella was individually portioned which surprised me as I never see this dish available in small quantities. When it came out, it made sense, though. It was a tad bit undercooked in spots. The seafood was delish and the chorizo wasn't as bad an addition as I feared. They also were able to custom-add a poached egg or two on request. This almost made up for the undercooked bits.   The corn fritters appetizer wasn't anything special and I wished I had more options for a spread (savory and sweet butters would have been ideal). Probably wouldn't bother with that again, to conserve my calories and tummy space for more worthy options. Only one in three of the daily dessert shooters were good--the local peaches which actually tasted/felt like apples. The mocha mousse and lemon curd were ... unpleasant. Truly. Good crust base, though.  My understanding is those flavors change regularly so no telling if you'll have a similar or completely different experience. Gamble at your own risk. It was a fun and shareable crapshoot, at least, and we giggled quite a bit at how truly astringent the lemon curd was.   The server was friendly and made my companions feel just right, which I appreciated, but he was new to the restaurant and you could tell he just wasn't that familiar with the menu, the kitchen, and the policies. As the face of the place, this alone loses a full star for me.   Would I return? Yes. Would I order the seafood paella again? Yes. Will that be soon? No, I think I'll make the rounds and collect some other brunch touch points first."}
{"text":"Service was excellent! The menu is short because they focus on bringing food from farm and sea to table. So keep in mind that the menu will change frequently. Fresh food and fast service!"}
{"text":"Adding to THE LIST! I was looking for charbroiled oysters coming from a trip to New Orleans and saw this restaurant had an impressive oyster menu. So I decided to stop in for an early dinner.  Located in a bit of a hidden spot in Uptown, right off of Tryon, with an entrance on 5th Street. I was immediately seated and the restaurant was still a little light at the time. My server Joe was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and very professional, but still friendly. No charbroiled oysters, so I tried the Oysters Noda. For my meal I had the catfish Ruben and substituted the fries for the braises greens.   The Oysters Noda were good. The bacon was a bit overpowering, but still good. The catfish Ruben was PHENOMENAL! The seasoned, grilled catfish, cheese and mix of flavors in the \"slaw\" were excellent. I even really like the flavor of the greens.   I will be back to try the fritters, shrimp steamed bun, lobster roll and fried catfish with grits."}
{"text":"Nice dinner, good atmosphere . Matt , our waiter , was very efficient and friendly. Only disappointment was that we wanted the key lime ice cream sandwich....and they were out, at 8:00. Would definitely return for the food."}
{"text":"Nestled between Hearst Tower and Connollys on 5th Street. Must come for $1 oysters during happy hour. The rest of the food is okay. Decor is rustic and trendy. A little noisy when busy. Cocktails are between $11-$15 and are not discounted during happy hour."}
{"text":"We ordered a bunch of oysters, including the happy hour Sea Levels & and they were really fresh! The fried oyster tacos and pork belly buns were tasty as well. We will definitive be back for more. YUM!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great service. Went for lunch. Enjoyed the clam chowder and fish taco. Shared braised greens with a co-worker. They were awesome!!  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I went there with my wife for dinner.  The service (Thanks Stephanie!) and food were great.   We had some oysters to start along with the shrimp bun.  For dinner, we had the tuna and the salmon and a couple of salads (get the roasted duck salad!).  Everything was fantastic.   On a side note, I am one of those pain in the butt customers with tons of food allergies.  They went out of their way to make sure the food was safe and even brought me a sample of my wife's dish prepared in a way I could eat it (they noticed we were trying each other's food).    Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ate at Sea Level with a couple of my friends for my 25th birthday dinner bc my pregnant stomach was craving oysters. Immediately upon walking in I loved the laidback atmosphere. Our server, Nate, was very nice and gave great suggestions as far as recommending what oysters we should try, being that we're oyster novices. He recommended that I try the Oysters NoDa (sooooo good). I also tried the Braised Short Rib. Typically it comes with a kale mix I believe, but I'm not into superfoods honestly, so he was able to sub out the kale bed for collard greens. The collard greens aren't typically southern greens cooked in fatty meat, they're just REALLY vinegary. Aside from that, the rib was great. My friends ordered the paella and the swordfish. The portions were relatively large. I wasn't hungry when I left. Nate also offered a free birthday dessert, I got to choose between an ice cream sundae and the blood orange cheesecake. I chose to skip out this time tho. They do offer an oyster happy hour on weekdays from 4-7 I believe(?) and they validate parking at Hearst tower!!!!"}
{"text":"Had a great meal here.  They serve North Carolina seafood prepared well.  The decor is nice, servers friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Are you guys REALLY asking about GENDER NEUTRAL bathrooms??? Get a life.   this place is great, oysters in August. A little pricey, but truly great. We had Duck Tacos and Fried Oyster Tacos...we'll return for sure."}
{"text":"Sea Level's entrees are where it's at. The oysters are a bonus. The sides, you can do without. The menu is constantly changing so take the menu on their website with a grain of salt.  The swordfish ($33) was perfectly cooked served with brussel sprouts, carrots, pecans, a vinaigrette, and topped with fried onions. Surprisingly the flavors melded well and the meal left me satisfied but not overstuffed. My fellow diners ordered the grilled salmon ($25), which was decent. Though my fellow diner who ordered the paella ($30) absolutely killed it and left the cast iron it was served in absolutely spotless!  We also ordered 3 Sea Level oysters ($1.75)/each), flavorful but much smaller than the Delaware Bay, NJ oysters ($2.50) which were ginormous and silky smooth but didn't have much flavor. The sauce accompaniments were plentiful: horseradish, red vinegar, onion/oil/pepper, cocktail sauce, and lemon!  The salmon tartare ($12) had dill aioli and jalapenos, served with charred bread. Not my favorite flavors for a salmon tartare. The sides: tater tots ($5)(perfectly fried and filling!), roasted root vegetables, steamed pork belly ($5.50/each)(stay away!), and duck tacos ($5.50/each)(too saucy) were all forgettable compared to the mains.  Sea Level NC tries to be a cool fusion restaurant with Asian/Mexican flavors like \"pork belly steamed buns\" and \"duck tacos\" while serving up fresh seafood but it should really just focus on the seafood. Decent for a business meal but falls short of being on a regular's list.   Service was quite nice though instead of checking my reservation for 4, the maitre'd assumed I was a party of 2 since I had arrived early with only one fellow diner. I really appreciated that our server helped us fill our glasses because we were seated in a deep booth while the water was at the other end of the table. Sea Level is nestled between a parking garage and in the side of an office building, with a dark/awkward outdoor seating but once inside has rustic feel with the exposed ceiling, hightops, booths, and brick walls."}
{"text":"Within walking distance from the Spectrum center, we stopped here on a Friday in lent and were not disappointed.  The restaurant is very modern and upscale.  Their oyster list boasts their own oyster they work with local providers to offer.  My fish taco was very well dressed and filling.  The Hubbs got the catfish Reuben and liked it.  It's slightly on the pricier side but worth it."}
{"text":"I went to this place for lunch and had such a great service and delicious food that I decided to celebrate my birthday there. We had a great time, food variety and quality is awesome not just for a seafood lover but anyone else too. Wait staff were curtious and friendly and very efficient. We enjoyed it and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love sea level! Andrew and scott are great behind the bar. You can't beat the one dollar sea level oysters paired with their tasty cocktails and decent wine selection. Service, food, and atmosphere are great anytime"}
{"text":"Even though we were actually looking to visit Sea Level prior to a show at the Belk, we almost walked right by it - they could stand a little more signage on the outside (or perhaps we should pay a little more attention). They really don't look like there is anything there on the outside, and you have to go up the steps, around the corner, and to grandmother's house you go.  But once inside, it's a cool spot. One knock (other than getting inside, so I guess that's two): It's a bit dim. I mean most of us have phones. And I'm old, so I can't see anything. Maybe I need a cane or something. I also get that it totally adds to the vibe of the place and you don't want some monstrous lights. But combine the atmosphere with the lack of lighting and the menus, and it can be downright tough to figure out what you're going to order.   Once we did, everything went swimmingly. Staff is most helpful, and they brought things out right away, even though we weren't ordering a regular meal - just a bunch of small plates. It was that good, we just kept ordering. In fact, we probably ate more that way. Definitely worth it, and now that we know where they are, we'll likely be back."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite spot in Charlotte the corn fritters and lobster sandwich is to die for. The oysters from all the different regions are fresh and amazing. And last but not least you guys have got to try the key lime cookie dessert my boyfriend craves the dessert at least once a week."}
{"text":"Had a quick supper here with raw oysters (sea level NC oysters). Oysters were good. Service could be a bit slow due to peak hours."}
{"text":"Great place, excellent food, good service!!! Was there on a packed Saturday night. Oyster shooters were amazing and the pork belly buns as well."}
{"text":"First visit, sat at the oyster. Small selection of craft beers, good cocktail and wine list. Great selection of oysters and they were fresh and delicious! If you get there before 7pm, oysters are $1/each! Good appetizer menu, a couple of the items here do not specify that they are fried, so ask. Our waiter Andrew was excellent? We did not have an entree, but will next time we visit."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Great ambiance. Awesome service. First time here but I will definitely go again and again."}
{"text":"I would give the aesthetics and atmosphere (5) stars. But I was not impressed with the main dish selections. I thought there would have been better seafood main dish selections. There was Salmon (get that anywhere), Porgy with skin on, Trigger fish Cioppino (a fish and shellfish stew), Catfish and that was about it. And those dishes were $25 - $30 each. Not what I expected and especially for that price. I thought there would be Grouper, Redfish, Sea Trout, Tuna, Wahoo or more. I know those are seasonal fishes and they may not be available in NC at this moment. But I don't think Trigger fish Stew, Catfish and Porgy are going to keep this place in business at these prices. If I were to go again I would call ahead and see what's on the menu before I ventured their way."}
{"text":"Oyster Taco and the Catfish Po' Boy are a must both very good, nice attentive staff at the bar area"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and friendly service. However my girlfriend and I both got food poisoning from the \"house\" oyster. I'd steer clear."}
{"text":"Sea Level NC has a large, open floor plan with both indoor and outdoor seating. It is modern and clean. The wait staff is very friendly and caters well to specific requests. I haven't had any issues with lines or wait times, simply directed towards a vacant table upon arrival. The seafood is fresh and of great quality. Their dishes are portioned well at a medium to large size. I recommend ordering a plate of their Fat Baby oysters, they're silky and huge. This is the perfect place to fill up on delicious seafood!"}
{"text":"Not one, but TWO oyster happy hours. Insert slow clap here. That's right, $1 oysters (from Sea Level, NC) Monday through Saturday from 4-7pm AND 10pm to midnight. I love to come here after Hornets games for oysters and rosè. I make sporting events classy, y'all.   I primarily come here for oysters, but if I'm looking for more I usually get the corn fritters or the lobster roll. I'm a sucker for lobster rolls and this one is fresh and delicious. Again, shout out to Kseniya M for the corn fritters rec. I would've never thought to order those here and they are so good. The catfish reuben is pretty unique and tasty. You can also place orders online to pick up.   The patio is a nice spot to people watch. I personally enjoy sitting in front of the raw bar so I can watch them prep the oysters. I find it fascinating. How on earth are they able to crank through so many and not cut themselves?!  Free parking alert: Sea Level validates for the Hearst Tower deck, so make sure you bring your parking ticket in with you."}
{"text":"I have been several times recently and the Oyster selection is great, staff is knowledgeable and extremely attentive! Great spot for dinner or just to meet up with friends and enjoy there raw bar selection!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the food here. I had salmon, which was delicious. My wife had the catfish and grits, which was out of this world. Very nice ambience and friendly service make this place a great dinner spot."}
{"text":"Good food, great service, and open a little later than other places in the area, but overpriced IMHO."}
{"text":"First time visiting, wanted to try it for awhile now and finally had the opportunity to. Unfortunately, a little disappointed about my visit.   The service was not the best. Our food took about 30 mins to arrive and our waiter forgot to put in our appetizer, so our entrees arrived before the apps. The waiter felt bad so he took care of the appetizer for free. But our app arrived close to our entrees being finished. Our waiter seemed like more preoccupied watching the Kentucky Derby and the hockey game on TV, so half our time was spent waiting on our waiter and the other half was spent waiting on our food and eating.   Not an overall good experience. Not sure if I'll be back but I may consider it a couple months down the line."}
{"text":"I don't normally post reviews unless they are really bad or really good. Sea Level was outstanding in both food & service. Our waiter, Nate, was super friendly w/o being annoying. He made excellent recommendations and was so pleasant. We had the corn fritters, ceviche, oysters & clam chowder to start and they were all excellent. Salmon, swordfish and shrimp and grits were next and everyone enjoyed. To top it all off, the strawberry ice cream sandwich hit the spot. Kudos to the chefs, staff and the best waiter in town, Nate. Seafood at its finest."}
{"text":"Some of the most creative cocktails I've had in Charlotte and all of the food was great. The clam chowder is a must try."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and friendly waitstaff.  Service can a a little slow, but if you aren't in a rush great place to chill.  Tried lobster roll and it was delicious! Now it's not a big sandwich so make sure you plan on ordering something else.  The oysters were great.  Had 2 trays of the Sea level house oysters. Clean and very fresh.  The sizes varied wildly some very large others disappointingly small. They have $1 oysters at happy hour which I would suggest and late night which is a cool surprise."}
{"text":"Sea level was fantastic I am happy hour oysters were fantastic from South Carolina which was on a big surprise I typically get them from up north.the wait staff was fantastic and Andrew took care of us at the bar area we actually sat At the oyster bar area areso we could watch them as we were waiting for our meals the corn fritters were absolutely delightful"}
{"text":"Delicious dinner before the baseball game. Lobster roll was full of perfectly cooked lobster and had just the right amount of dressing."}
{"text":"Fried chicken sandwich is great! Grilled chicken sandwich is a close second. Service is good and they never seem to be over crowded which is really nice!"}
{"text":"It was a very busy night, we didn't have reservations and the staff accommodated us very quickly. The hostess crew was very pleasant.  Our server, Aries was beyond fantastic.  She picked my meal, the bass and it was fantastic!  I highly recommend this fantastic restaurant with superb farm to table fare. Congratulations to the crew and management on delivering  a truely great dining experience."}
{"text":"FINALLY!  We have been saying for a while now that Charlotte was missing a great seafood restaurant and raw bar. There are a couple of good places but nothing in the Queen city compares to sea level!  We went for my wifes birthday and was blown away from beginning to end. We started with oysters of course and loved the selection....we ordered cocktails also which was so hard to choose from the signature drinks and the daily drink specials. Everything was phenomenal and we're already planning our next visit. I could write another 3 paragraphs but I'll keep it short and just tell you that this place is a must when uptown."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our first meal at Sea Level.  Located in the former LaVecchia's spot in Hearst Tower, we were excited to see this place filled by another seafood restaurant.  We stopped by just after they opened for dinner on a Saturday, following a show at Blumenthal.  It wasn't crowded at this time, and we were seated immediately.    The restaurant has a nice vibe.  It's decor is chic contemporary, the tables are nicely spaced, and, when we visited, they played awesome rock music (think Arctic Monkeys, Cage the Elephant, etc.).    I started with a Cat's Meow beverage (my husband had club soda).  The Cat's Meow was slightly--but not overly--sweet, and I enjoyed it very much.  Bread is extra, but just $3 a basket.  You get a decent-sized French roll, sliced and toasted, served with an onion butter.  It was delicious, and we'd likely get it again.    For appetizers, we had the clam chowder (me) and apple endive salad (him).  The clam chowder was a bit pricy for the portion ($9 for a bowl), but it was very good.  If you're a fan of thicker chowders like I am, you'll like this dish.  My husband's salad was huge, and very good.  At $10, those with lighter appetites could eat this as an entree, especially with the option of adding a protein.   For our entrees, I had the smoked trout risotto, and my husband had the mahi with beets. The trout was definitely the better value, at $18 for a huge portion.  I'm a huge fan of smoked trout, and every bite had a piece of trout.  The dish was topped with a poached egg.  While I'm not a fan of poached eggs, I do love poached egg YOLKS, so I split the egg, and mixed the yolk into the risotto.  This was a very creative dish, and I loved it!  My husband's mahi with beets tasted delicious, but it was a small plate (think just a bit bigger than tapas style) for $25.  He's not sure he'd get this again, just due to the value per portion size.  Those with lighter appetites would likely love this, however.  Overall, we enjoyed our meal and will definitely return.  Sea Level is starting lunch the first week of March, so I'll have to check them out one day when I'm in the office."}
{"text":"Went to Sea Level last night for dinner (Friday night) with a couple of girlfriends.  And we actually ran into two other tables of people we knew.  We totally loved it!  The servers were super sweet (and cute too!) and perfectly attentive.  We ordered a couple of beers and apps to start.  I especially liked the corn fritters.  The shrimp tempura was a little too fried for my taste - but pretty good.  We ordered the oysters - cause you have to :) - which were delish - and then we did our main meal.  I had the Catfish Reuben and it was so good!  I got a side of carrots, which sounded sorta boring, but I was trying to be healthy :).  The carrots came out in a little pot and were deliciously grilled - surprisingly good!  I would have liked to have a bit more slaw on my plate with he sandwich, but otherwise was happy.  Everyone loved their meals - one girlfriend got the Lobster roll, which was insanely delish.  The soft shell crab sandwich was the slight disappointment as it was a bit too fried for my friend's taste.  We had the apple tart for dessert - and so should you - awesome!  Overall it was a great experience, fun way to start off the night and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"As we continue our gastronomic tour through Charlotte--with a number of positive surprises--we had lunch today at Sea Level, and once again were not disappointed.  This restaurant just brings it all together: a \"top 25 new restaurant\" designee in Charlotte Magazine,it has a great story of someone pursuing their dream. Even the website brings you \"in\", and the restaurant itself is inviting: sophisticated without being overwhelming, clean lines, a menu that reflects a philosophy, and food/service to match. There is even a nod to their fundraising activities for hurricane victims and various local causes they support.  The menu has some tempting offerings, however we started with the \"special\" oysters (they were out of their own sustainably sourced shellfish when we were there). However, not disappointed with the \"substitutes\" from Virginia, which were even better at $1 each (happy hour, on Saturday afternoon). We coupled that with the salmon tartare and crostini (our habit is to order what we are interested in. That doesn't mean we finish everything!!!! Sometimes tasting is sufficient. Well, maybe a bit more than a \"taste...)  For the main course, Sandra had the po boy with fried shrimp and oysters (on request, they were glad to offer both) and I had the catfish Reuben (who ever thought of catfish on a Reuben? Well, this IS North Carolina, not New York). Remember that comment about tasting? Limits were difficult to enforce with either. Guess that says something about how much we enjoyed them. Oh, and the \"side orders\" of french fries and grits with chorizo gravy were generous and delicious.  So, Charleston: you continue to surprise us with the number of well-executed downtown eating and entertainment/sports/theater options you offer to us visiting folks. You have made our visit fun and delicious. And most of all we heard again and again from visitors and locals alike: everyone seems to love this city!!! We certainly understand why, especially with restaurants like this and the others we have visited this week. They are more than enjoyable; they are ambassadors in the very best sense of the word."}
{"text":"Sea level was good. Best shrimp and grits we have had outside of our own home hands down. The catfish Ruben was also very good. The service was alright. I made a reservation because I read elsewhere that it was recommended (even for lunch) and it was not all that busy but it still took 10-15 minutes to get our drinks. We definitely will come back and try brunch or their $1.00 oysters from 10pm-12am or even dinner. The restaurant itself was very unique and we enjoyed the setting. I'm looking forward to giving them a second chance."}
{"text":"Sea Level has one of the best craft cocktails. I got there a few minutes before happy hour ended. Andrew the bartender took excellent care of me, I was able to get the happy hour special $1 per oyster, while we waited for table to be ready.   Service was excellent, food was DELICIOUS & drinks even better. I would have given them 5 stars except we had to wait 15-20 minutes for a table although we had dinner reservations."}
{"text":"I am just going with A-OK, but that doesn't mean I wouldn't be willing to try again!  We were invited to crash a double date last weekend and found ourselves at Sea Level.  Shockingly the restaurant was not super crowded at all, but after the meal I think I kinda know why?  The ambiance is very cool with their \"outdoor patio\" being industrial with a good vibe!  My husband had oysters of course and said that they were pretty delicious for a Charlotte restaurant!  I had two crab claws, both of which had crumbled shells so I ended up picking shells out of each bite of my crab meat!  Additionally, they weren't as large as I am used to, but perhaps that is because I typically have them in Charleston SC.  I ordered a salad for dinner which was delicious but still just a salad.  I would have to say that although the martini list was almost non existant, that the French pear was really good!!  All in all, we ended up spending $150 after tip for three cocktails, three beers, a salad and oysters...   OH YEAH, the 12 oysters were $40.00... seems steep to me, but maybe I just don't know the market!"}
{"text":"I decided to try Sea Level again after a few months and to order some different items and give them a chance.  I had a really great experience second time around and am happy to report I will be back again.  This last time left me wanting more!  I started with the fish taco, Sea Level oysters ($1: 4P-7P), and the ghost pepper pommarita.  The taco only came with one (I wish more) but was delicious!!  I definitely recommend getting a few of these as a meal. Very good.  The oysters were phenomenal and very large.  The were served with horseradish, cocktail, and a mignonette (which I never had in my life). I can't wait to have these again!! The pommarita was right up my alley:spicy and a touch of sweet, I enjoyed it more than I thought I would.   For dinner (as if I didn't eat enough already) I chose the Tile fish with corn gazpacho, tomatillos, and duck fat potatoes. YUM!!! The potatoes were extra crispy and the gazpacho added a hint of sweet to the dish.  I literally want this again right as I type.  The tile fish was mild and crispy.   To finish I had the blueberry cheesecake shooter.  It was rich and delightful.  Nathan was our server, he made the second chance experience outstanding.  He was really nice and patient.  I thank him for taking really good care of us.   It's all about what you choose on the menu, and the first time I just chose all wrong. Read reviews, look at pictures and ask for Nathan.  He recommended some things and was spot on with his descriptions.  I'm glad that I went back and will be back some more."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic! I had the bass ceviche which was incredible, and NC tile fish as my entree. My husband had flounder and we both cleaned our plates completely. Everything is so fresh and unique. Topping it all off was the impeccable service from our server Joe... best service we've ever had. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food was decent. Nothing spectacular. Oyster shooter and Spanish g&t was good. Decent wine selection. Our waiter ended up being very friendly. For the price - you can do much better in CLT.   BUT. The host and hostess were horrid.   First - I called on Friday and tried to make a reservation. I was told they don't 'do' reservations. Ok. That's odd. It's a nice restaurants - I expected reservations - but again was told they don't 'do' reservations.   What they meant was they were booked full.   That is 2 VERY different things.  So, we went on Saturday. Walked in and - yep - were asked for our reservation. But wait... I was told yesterday - you don't 'do' reservations. Blah blah blah, (uncaring and general blah) - was the response from the hostess.   We were directed to a 'first-come-first-serve' area - it worked - two stools at a communal table.   Neither host bothered to bring us a menu or utensils. Then, sitting in the 'you didn't have a reservation - even though you called' section, I watched a host play on his phone all night.   As we got up to leave - he surely wasn't bothered to open the door for my mother who was visiting.   Excellent service starts at the first interaction. Excellence was, for sure, lacking with the first and last 'touch'."}
{"text":"I am sorry to say... Our party of 6 left with much disappointment! All the hype.. and we did not feel that this restaurant had ANY WOW factors! Also, we noticed a lot of empty tables when we arrived and when we left. The food had 0 taste very very bland. Oysters only come raw, no steaming, which was a disappointment as well. I did like my cocktail but it also was 14.00!!! so I was hoping it would be good. I would not go back, I can get much better and less expensive food at many other restaurants in and around Charlotte. Sorry Sea Level!!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal oysters and service. Their twist on Oysters Rockefeller was spot. Recommendations on local oysters was appreciated because they were wonderful. Nice finish on the deserts. Customized service from Joe - will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"Catfish sandwich was unreal, wine selection was very nice and oysters were delicious."}
{"text":"We gave this spot a second try yesterday evening for dinner and tried some new items.  I have to say we were very impressed with the whole flounder...delicious & fresh!  We also tried the tempura shrimp appetizer and sword fish, which both were great options.  But we will most definitely be back for that flounder.  The service was awesome just as we remembered it!    I had high expectations for this place, but...it just didn't meet up to the hype as much as I thought.  The best part of the meal was the SERVICE honestly...our waiter was excellent!!!  She was very knowledgeable about the menu and had the best attitude.  As far as the food goes, we weren't too impressed.  We ordered the clam chowder, catfish Ruben, and catfish with grits.  The one thing we would come back for is the clam chowder.  The Ruben was ok, but the catfish wasn't really fresh. The best thing was my side...the braised greens were awesome!  And all of this was very over-priced for the quantity...we left hungry.  We would probably only come back for appetizers and drinks with friends."}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday dinner for my friend who loves fresh seafood and this place was perfect.   The boys ordered oysters from the happy hour menu $1 per oyster and both were impressed with the freshness but did say the guy shucking them got some shell in there as well.   Us girls decided to try out a few of the unique cocktails and were not disappointed. The cocktails were all delicious and a little twist on some classic drinks. We went around the holiday and the holiday punch with titos vodka and house made cranberry juice was my favorite.   For dinner there is a selection of both land and sea options, we all elected for the sea options, it is called sea level after all! I would consider myself a shrimp and grits expert and always order it if I see it on a menu, the shrimp and grits at sea level did not disappoint! I want to go back to order them again ASAP. My friend got the grilled salmon and I can only assume it was delicious because it was gone before I could ask for a bite!   Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Nice location in downtown Charlotte and $1 raw oysters during happy hour are hard to beat. Our fish entrees were fresh and very good too."}
{"text":"Welp... the Carolina Panthers didn't win today... but my husband and I did... we decided to try a best kept secret tucked away in Hearst Tower... SEA LEVEL! My food was ok, the only thing memorable was the collard greens! The collard greens have this amazing smoked vinegar on them... yep... smoked vinegar!!! But these 5 stars aren't for the food... NOPE! It was this apple buckle that they serve in a cast iron skillet, pipping hot with candied pecans and then bourbany (its a real word)... Lol...caramel sauce! Yoooooooo... this was AMAZEBALLS! You definitely want dessert if you come to sea level... if nothing else, come for the dessert! FYI... get it A LA MODE!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! The food is always great. The service is why I gave only 4 stars. Sometimes I haven't had the warmest greetings from the servers. I will still come back."}
{"text":"Service was great and the oyster selection is the best in Uptown, but I was disappointed in the limited selection of fish options available for dinner..."}
{"text":"Really love this place great ambiance. Will definitely be bringing clients here for Happy Hours."}
{"text":"The food is good here and the atmosphere is laid back which makes a great date night or chill spots with friends .   You are instantly transformed into a different atmosphere with classy upscale place to the point you almost forget you are in Charlotte.   We had appetizers and food. The tacos were somewhat small but the fried chicken sandwich was huge! It was really good and worth the shot.   I would give this place a try for yourself and I know they $1 oyster nights."}
{"text":"Everything is amazing! The sea level oysters are wonderful and only $1 each everyday from 4 to 7. The squid chow chow, and corn friters are to die for."}
{"text":"Last night was our first visit to sea level. We chose it during the Queen's feast because we had never been there. It was a great experience, our server was excellent and even made a substitution that they typically do not make on the menu for us. The Oyster's  on the salad were incredible. The mahi was prepared exactly how I like it and the dessert was a great finale. We will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"I brought  my mom here for her birthday (& Cinco design Mayo). Right off the bat, loved the atmosphere and relaxed vibe we got. Our wonderful server, Stephanie, offered margaritas & suggested the corn fritters for an appetizer- they taste like fluffy clouds of yum with a nice crunch. My mom went with the po boy sandwich and I went with the catfish Reuben, you read right, REUBEN. It was delicious, it's probably going to my favorite. Since I had mentioned to Stephanie it was my mom's birthday, she brought her a complimentary dessert shooter; flavors included pineapple upside-down cake, black cherry forest chocolate( or something like that lol) & the one my mom chose, carrot cake it was yummy too. Overall Sea Level is a great new addition to Uptown Charlotte's restaurants but it offers more than just great seafood dishes  & customer service but a wonderful event space too; I can definitely see birthday parties, networking receptions and wedding dinners happening here. Go visit & tell Stephanie 'hello' She is awesome!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at this restaurant for lunch and I have to say it was a great experience! The server definitely was great. He answered any questions I had and also made great suggestions on what to order. I ordered the pick 2 (fried oyster taco, fish taco, Parmesan tater tots). Everything was delicious and the tater tots are definitely homemade and fresh. Easy to get addicted to those! I will definitely be visiting this restaurant again!"}
{"text":"Good seafood restaurant with some creative menu options.  Oysters were good.  Duck salad was excellent.   Service was competent.  Prices were moderate to expensive depending on the choices you make.  The location is on the edge of downtown Charlote, but they have an attached parking garage and they validate.  Overall, a good option in a city not known for its culinary excellence."}
{"text":"Great bartenders! The oysters are so fresh and delicious. Charlotte needed a restaurant like this in Uptown!"}
{"text":"After doing a little shopping and sightseeing uptown I decided to try Sea Level. Thy first visit, my expectations was I was entering a seafood restaurant. I was disappointed with the menu options and decided to get a salad, thinking you can't go wrong with a Caesar salad. Welp, i was wrong. The lettuce and chicken looked and tasted old. My companion decided on fish and grits which was no better. Bland and soggy is how I would describe the fish and the grits dry and \"grainy\". I don't know if this is the norm but I doubt I'll return to find out. 2 stars, because the service and cocktails were decent."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  My son ordered the catfish sandwich and a plate of fish and rice came out instead.  My husband ordered the grouper and they brought mahi mahi and said they were out of grouper so they substituted.  I was floored that they didn't tel us or ask him to make another selection.  Everyone else had something marginal in the plate. The gazpacho on my fish was just a tomato paste. The greens on my other son's plate were too sweet to eat. Although we were there two hours, the service was so poor and slow that we didn't have time for coffee or dessert. The sound level was so loud that conversation was difficult."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar and ordered a sampling of oysters on a Thursday night. The service was great and the remodel very well done. I ordered the Striped Bass entrée and it was yummy; date order the Salmon and it was melt in your mouth outstanding. Their salmon, we were told, are farmed, yet eat a standard salmon-diet vs a feed. I would recommend Sea Level. Nice place to meet up for a drink as well!"}
{"text":"I had a great experience here! I walked in at 415 pm, and the Happy Hour was $1 sea level oysters between 4-7 and 10-12. The place was just becoming busy for happy hour and I'm glad I got there early.  My server was jovial and knowledgeable about the menu. The sea level oysters were delicious, slightly briny and small/medium in size. There was a selection of over 10 different oysters, a wide variety across the US and decently priced.   The host was friendly, the bartender was knowledgeable about the menu, and the oyster shucker gave me some great places to check out in town.  I'd say the clam chowder was pretty darn delicious and I'd recommend it.   There was a patio section outside which was pretty spacious and butted up to one of the main roads, or plenty of seating at the bar or in the dining space.  I'll be coming back here."}
{"text":"Delicious dinner while in town for business. We had two of the seafood specials. Both were perfectly prepared. One entree came with the wrong side. Before we even noticed a manager was bringing the correct side and offering a free dessert. Would definitely eat here again and recommend to others. Oysters were fresh and clean!  I don't think you can go wrong. Through my entire meal I could see Management in the kitchen overseeing the production. They definitely pay attention to detail!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic. Great quality fish, good service, good location, great patio, well made drinks, and an oyster happy hour that would've made me as happy as a clam.   I made the decision Friday night that I wanted seafood, and Sea Level is my closest place. Made a Yelp reservation for 2 at 7:30, and we parked in the labyrinth of the Hearst Tower deck (which they validate, regardless of event parking!!). Show up, and turns out we didn't need a reservation! The Lady and I were seated in the patio, but most of it touches Hearst Plaza which doesn't have the traffic or construction noises. Our server was kind and quick to offer suggestions, and we both started out with a drink. The Lady got the Meow Mule and I ordered the Smokey Old Fashioned, which was perfectly smoked in every sip.   To start, we got two Oyster Steamed Buns, which have a fried oyster for a good crunch. For our entrees, we knew we wanted fresh, so we splurged a little and got two of the fresh catch entrees; one Triggerfish, and one Snapper. As soon as these came out, we could tell how much work was put into the plates. The Triggerfish was sweet and tasted of crab (because, as our server explained, that's what it feeds off of) and the snapper had crispy skin and flaky flesh, just perfectly cooked. Each were served with it's own side dish, the Trigger wish a creole rice and slaw mixture, and the Snapper with a southern succotash that was stellar.   The menu changes daily, which means that they always provide the freshest catch. Prices are definitely a nice occasion with entrees hovering around the $30 range (and then you got drinks and apps and yada yada), but if you know that walking in, you're good. Unless you go for the oyster happy hour, then you can get out cheap :)"}
{"text":"Excellent food and ambience! We had a wonderful waitress (I believe her name was Andria). The only thing that prevents me from giving them 5 stars was the fact that the food was all just a tad salty; not difficult to eat salty but more than I would've preferred. I don't put salt on anything (I watch my sodium) so, if I want salt, I'll put it on myself. I'm not terribly picky but the saltiness was noticeable. Other than that, kudos!"}
{"text":"Great service, oysters were yummy. I had the mussels for my entree and it was great. We also ordered their version of fried calamari- it was just ok. A bit too sweet and I would pass on the tuna tartar as well- kinda pricy and nothing special. Daughter had shrimp po'boy and hubby had the lobster roll - all very tasty."}
{"text":"This was a great dining experience. There's over 300 reviews so I will keep mine short.   There is happy hour for oysters. Even if you miss out on happy hour, the starting prices are low. The food is regular sized portion but the quality is amazing. The price is well worth the quality a million times over. I also ordered a glass of wine and the temperature was perfect!   Service was incredible. My water was never empty and my plates were promptly corrected.   There is a deck right next door which makes it so convenient to leave and enter."}
{"text":"The service is impecable, every staff member we met truly cares about your experience"}
{"text":"We came after a Hornets game to get the late night oyster special.  The Oysters were fantastic even ended up ordering Oyster shooters. Bartender was very friendly one of the best we've had in charlotte!   Veggie burger was also very good."}
{"text":"Ive done takeout once before and didn't think much of it. We had lunch here the other day, and again it was just OK. We ordered the fish and oyster taco small plates, and both were delicious in flavor but felt very heavy after. They never have this one particular fish taco so they just remove it from the menu. My husband got the duck salad which he said was pretty good. I got the Caesar salad with blackened shrimp. The lettuce in my salad was browned and clearly not fresh. Don't serve vegetables that are clearly old! On top of that, the croutons are extremely sweet and didn't mesh with the salad and shrimp.   I probably wouldn't go back. I've had better tacos at Bakersfield, and overall better seafood elsewhere. It's also kind of hidden away...not the most ideal location."}
{"text":"Decided to go here for a little girls night & so glad my friend chose this place! It was a little hard to find at first but could be because I'm horrible at directions ... all the staff here are so attentive & sweet ! Nate however, the best server ever !!! Know everything on the menu & takes care of you ! Very outgoing guy! Will def he back ASAP! We need more Nate's in this world ! Oysters are outstanding"}
{"text":"Sea Level is my new \"go to\" bar/restaurant when in Charlotte.  It's a nice bar that has a down to earth vibe and an upscale feel.   I particularly like their oyster selection and their service is very good.    Give it a try."}
{"text":"Great food, great service!  Couldn't have asked for more - seriously.  NC oysters were a steal for their quality and price point."}
{"text":"Hotel valet suggested this place and it was great! Had the sweet/spicy margarita I forgot what it's called but the little bit of ghost pepper gives it a nice kick. The shrimp appetizer yum-o!! I had the blackened salmon and it was good not great it lacked some flavor but the beet slaw it was on was o e of a kind!!!  I hear it's relatively new and it should do great here."}
{"text":"$1 Oysters from 10pm-11pm. Such a vibe. This is a great spot for spontaneous cocktails and sharing plates with the ones you love."}
{"text":"My first visit to Sea Level rendered great appetizer, great dinner, and great dessert.  Let me tell you, the wine was even better.  What I loved was that our waitress was well versed in the wine selections (she was taught to appreciate wine at a prior gig; she is studying to become a lawyer).  They purchase fresh ingredients on a daily basis and build the day's menu based on those ingredients.  That said, you don't know what you might find upon entering the restaurant.  My visit was a little while ago;  I don't recall exactly what I had to eat, but I definitely recall that the experience was absolutely fabulous and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My father and I came here, both from out of town and let me tell you..... the baked oysters were to die for, dirty martinis were on point and someone even hand stuffed my olives with blue cheese for me. We had the Salmon linguine and it was enough for us to split. Joe was our server and he is top notch! He has some of the best customer service skills. He never let our drinks get low and was always there when a plate needed to be picked up. He made the experience very nice. We will be back again!"}
{"text":"Took my husband to Sea Level on a Saturday evening for Fathers Day.  We were excited to try them for the first time.    Cons: 1) I made reservations and asked for a booth but was seated at a table. And they weren't packed so they could have accommodated.   2) We were really disappointed in the food.   It was a bit bland.   Pros: 1) The drinks are strong.  2) The wait staff was nice."}
{"text":"I took my husband to Sea Level during restaurant week to celebrate his birthday! We had a wonderful experience! The restaurant has really cool and trendy decorations. This would be great both for a happy hour and a romantic dinner.   Everything I ordered was so delicious! First, I got the corn fritters, which were like hushpuppies with corn inside. I liked them because they weren't too sweet. My order came with about 10, which was plenty. I took some home and they reheated nicely. I had the short rib as my main dish, and it was so good. It was very tender and had great flavor. For dessert, I had the Bourbon-Chocolate Chip Pound Cake and it was heavenly. It was soft and chocolatey and had a great bourbon flavor that wasn't overwhelming."}
{"text":"I came to Sea Level for restaurant week. The food was fantastic! I enjoyed all three courses, and it was a lot of fun. You should definitely check this out for restaurant week (or any other time). The quality was very fresh and the flavors blended really well. I have ceviche for the first time, and it was quite delicious.  Service was a bit slow. I'm not sure if it was because of restaurant week, but I would make sure to give ample time for a meal when coming here. It took us 3 hours to finish.  I look forward to my next visit and coming back."}
{"text":"i came here to pick up food on 2 occassions. once was for lunch and the other for dinner. for lunch i had ordered the pork belly slider, clam chowder and fries. the pork belly slider was rock hard. i did not have the patience to break my teeth eating it as i expected a braised pork/tenderness. needless to say i threw the pork belly out. i ate the buns which had a sad smear of sauce but there wasnt much else to it. the fries were decent, cant mess those up can you? the clam chowder was extremely salty. so salty that i had to gulp some water every few sips of clam chowder. separately for dinner i had the lobster roll which sounded and perhaps looked better than what i got. it came with fries and then i separately ordered a fried oyster slider. the fried oyster was tasty, but something didnt feel/taste fresh about the fried oyster so my gut was to stop eating it. the lobster roll i had was also mediocre. i dont know if taking the food to go had anything to do with the food presentation. i had high hopes since their menu brought me back twice but disappointed twice"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and the seafood is always great and they have a good selection of wines by the glass."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place is four stars and not five. The mussels, oysters, corn fritters, greens, fresh fries salted to perfection, all the steam buns are amazing. The service is great every time. Location is perfect. A great place to sit outside when the weather is nice. I love this place!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here before going to the theater. It was a terrific dining experience! Our server and all of the wait staff were extremely nice and gave us top-notch personable service.   My husband and I couldn't choose between the shrimp po boy or lobster roll, so we ordered each and requested that each be cut in half so that we could share. Not only were they cut in half, but they split them and our sides on two plates for us! (Both were great...the lobster roll and corn fritters were my fave...the po boy and fries were my husband's faves.)  We ended our dinner with a white chocolate berry shooter dessert which was delicious and made from scratch in-house. Perfect touch to an already fab meal!"}
{"text":"Fabulous dining experience. Sea Level was amazing. We had oysters (tried multiple kinds) for apps and they were all fabulous. Very fresh. Cocktails and atmosphere were also on point."}
{"text":"Sea Level is my favorite seafood restaurant in Charlotte. The quality of food is fantastic.  We ordered the Maine Mussels (white wine and garlic butter) the sauce alone was amazing. We asked for extra bread after finishing the mussels to keep soaking. They had a $6 Stone Crab Claw special as well that we had--very good!   For entrees we did the NC Amberjack with herbed new potato mash, tarragon aioli and mixed veggies. We also did the Grilled Salmon with roasted potatoes, braised collards, smoked vinegar and herb aioli. Both were incredible--highly recommend!   For dessert we did the Cast Iron Apple Buckle and were fighting over who got the last bite!  All of the food was incredible. The price is exactly what they should be charging for delicious food with big portions! Atmosphere is classy casual and service was a 10 out of 10."}
{"text":"I had some oysters and seafood paella. I wish I had ordered many more oysters as they were delicious. I highly recommend the paella. The atmosphere is really cool and the service was quite good."}
{"text":"I can only speak for two of the things, but I like $1 oyster happy hours and glasses of chilled white wine so I'm satisfied. I like that the happy hour goes from 4 - 7 which gives me plenty of time to get my oyster fix (and apparently it goes from 10 - 12 as well...which just means more opportunities). The oysters were fine -- good and briny, but not as cleaned out as I liked, but hey, it's $1. It's a good after work hang out place when you want to wind down in Uptown.  The salmon tartare was also pretty good but I wish it came with more jalapenos or at least had them diced up so I could get a spicy kick in every bite. Not sure if I'll come back for an actual dinner, but I'll definitely keep doing the $1 oysters."}
{"text":"Service was fantastic!  They take this very seriously and everyone is very friendly.  The food was okay, but we went during Queen's Feast so I think they had a lot of stuff pre-made.  I would definitely come back another time to try something new!"}
{"text":"Can't rave about Sea Level NC enough...it's a trendy, cool (and new, from what I understand) restaurant in Uptown Charlotte that serves North Carolina caught seafood.   I was in town on business this week and came here with two colleagues.   As a \"cat enthusiast\" (aka Crazy Cat Lady), the \"Kitten Whiskers\" cocktail caught my eye and I had to try it. It did not disappoint. It consisted of chamomile, lemon juice, ginger beer and strawberry. Sooo goooood!  With regard to food, we started off with the corn fritters which were reminiscent of hush puppies- little fried balls of corn & cornbread. They were served with a spicy-ish aioli dip that was delish.  For my entrée, I had the grilled salmon. It came with roasted potatoes and braised collard greens. Talk about a food multiple orgasm! OMG. The salmon was a fresh, thick, juicy center cut and melted in my mouth. The roasted potatoes? Moist and buttery tasting! Not dry like a lot of the roasted potatoes many restaurants serve. And the braised greens? TO DIE FOR! I could not believe how perfectly cooked, seasoned & flavorful they were.  This was such a superb meal!  I know Charlotte has some great culinary finds but any future business trip I make here will NOT be complete without a trip to Sea Level!"}
{"text":"So good! Hushpuppies and oysters are my usual order. The ceasar salad is great too. They took my favorite drink off the menu (cats meow) but the rest of the cocktails are good too!"}
{"text":"The wife and I were in the mood for some good seafood so we tried sea level.  First we tried several types of oysters and they were all fresh and delicious.  Our mussel dish was also excellent but the surprise highlight of the meal was the short ribs.   One of the tastiest and most tender pieces of meat I have ever had!  As an added kicker, we had several unique and tasty cocktails.  The only thing that prevents me giving the 5th star was the decor and seating.  The seating is a bit cramped, except to hear the conversation next to you and the decor was rather non descript."}
{"text":"Willing to give this place a second shot, as we came here for dinner before the Mumford show (on a Thurs night) and I don't think they were prepared. Our poor waiter seemed completely overwhelmed. That said.. we each ordered multiple drinks, that took 20 minutes to arrive, and once they did arrive, they were wrong and had to be sent back. The waiter was apologetic.. but it put a damper on the overall experience. The corn fritter app was just okay, nothing to write home about. I will say that the shrimp and grits appetizer was excellent. The consensus from the table (food-wise) was good, but not great. Like I said, will probably give this place another shot, as I liked the decor/vibe/location."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and fantastic service party of 4 we tried a number of appetizers and a few dozen oysters everything was absolutely 5 stars I don't think there is anything in the menu that isn't great."}
{"text":"Sometimes you have those, \"Huh, I've never reviewed this place?\" moments and Sea Level NC was one of those for me.  Been there a few times, mostly for dinner but also for brunch and have walked away quite happy after each meal with the most recent visit being this week for a bday dinner with my oldest and his girlfriend.  Before some specifics on this most recent meal, my general commentary is that I really like Sea Level overall.  Food, service, cocktail choices, the way the menu has some standards but also is updated daily based on what's come in fresh, the 4-7 oyster happy hour where their Sea Level farmed variety are $1 each.  This time the table went for some apps... Oysters, tempura shrimp, clam chowder and crudo which may have been snapper but can't recall.  Do recall it was fresh and good.  Entrees varied from salmon, tile fish and shrimp and grits off the daily menu and a lobster roll from the everyday menu.  All was polished off amid compliments like, \"yum\", \"this is delicious\", etc.  Service was outstanding as it has been every time we've been.  They've got call ahead seating, take reservations via Yelp and you can order online for pickup.  Oh and park in the Hearst Tower garage and they'll validate before you leave the restaurant. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"First time there I enjoyed the whole experience and it was just me. Food was good and fresh well cooked and the cocktails kept be there a little longer than i wanted to be there. I had a show to attend and I almost missed the start. Oysters are a must and the corn hush puppy fritters - deelish. I wanted a little more variety but overall I enjoyed my first visit. Went back a few times with larger groups and was not as excited. Food was still good but service for a larger group was not impressive. Learned a little about oysters and NC!"}
