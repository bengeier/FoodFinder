{"text":"Really good food, really good prices.  Truck driver portions.  I was in the area to play disc golf at the course at nearby Sims park.  I'll probably stop in again next time I'm in the area.  Waitress was very friendly and attentive.  It was a pretty hot day and the A/C wasn't the greatest, but good food and service trumps that.  I recommend the breakfast skillet."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and each time I have not had a bad experience.  The staff is friendly and courteous.  The food is good and the price is reasonable."}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood spot. It seems every table represents a different walk of life, which just adds to the charm of warmly painted walls, friendly servers and a cup of coffee that never empties. Their tagline is something like \"come as a stranger, leave as a friend\" and that is how you will feel. The food is decent and very well priced; I had the Mediterranean omelette and it had the perfect amount of feta cheese. I'd give them my full support of five stars, but we waited a very long time for our food after ordering. Like 30 minutes."}
{"text":"I drove by Gus's for years.  I tried it out approximately four months ago and now I'm a fan.  Well managed, good staff and good, inexpensive food."}
{"text":"What can I say about Gus's Diner.   I moved into the area a few months ago, and after a day of wandering around, taking in the sights, and familiarizing myself with my new home, I noticed Gus's. As it was already 9pm, I decided to visit the next morning for breakfast. And again the next day. To the point where breakfast/brunch was all but a forgone conclusion.   Since that day, my roommates, friends, and visiting family members have all been introduced to my new home through this lovely diner.   The food is simply fantastic. In my first visit, I tried the Breakfast Skillet ( freshly-baked biscuits, two eggs, sausage or bacon, and hash browns all smothered in sausage gravy thats better than my grandmother's), which has since become my suggestion for anyone's first time.  I have since had nearly everything on the breakfast menu, and a wide assortment of choices from the lunch menu as well (added on around noon with breakfast still available all day).   Atmosphere-wise, it is the epitome of a classic American diner. While it does get extremely busy, I've never found myself wondering where my food or server is. The most important element for me, especially in a diner atmosphere, is the friendliness.  We were greeted the first day as though we were family, and have only been treated better since. Most of the wait staff at this point recognize us instantly, and we're always welcomed and asked about things going on in our lives. It is more than a place to eat, its a place that feels like your place. It is literally the place where \"everybody knows your name.\"  Excellent food, excellent service, and make sure you get in early to try the homemade grits, which are so good they tend to run out of them by 10:30 or so."}
{"text":"Really great. I'm making it my mission to try out several local businesses in Collinwood, and Gus's was on my list! Everyone was really nice. The service was quick, and the food tasted very good. Not the best eggs I've had, but I devoured almost everything on my plate.  The restaurant itself is really open and had such a nice vibe to it. Cheap and quick, that's what I like in a diner!   And the corned beef hash was of the canned variety..which is my personal preference ;)"}
{"text":"I'm in the restaurant business and if my employees ever treat someone like I was just treated at this place I'd fire them and the manager.  If you have a POLICY that states that you don't service people that are on their cell phone them it should be posted in plain site!  You should NOT be ignored until you ask to be serviced and THEN made aware of it!  On top of the dirty cup that the waitress poured my coffee in and didn't apologize or make mention when switching to other cup and left the half poured cup on table.  It was my first time there via a referral and I had NO clue of the rules, then to gather with the other waitresses and share that I wouldn't get off the phone is ridiculous.  There are nice and polite ways to share your rules, but more importantly POST them so that new people may have an opportunity to have the best experience.  I didn't get to eat so I can't tell you if the food was good out not, but the attitudes ALL of them were not pleasing and NO one bothered to be polite in introducing the LAW of GUS Diner!  I'll simply go to another restaurant where I can at least feel like a human with respect."}
{"text":"It would get 4 stars but the service consistently SUCKS and the food isn't consistent.   from my experiences here, I'd comment that the ingredients used and the prep of said food is above par. The execution of the cooking of the food is spotty at best. I think the kitchen staff needs some training from the owner quite frankly.   As for the waitresses......HORRIBLE. I try to put out good karma but I really find myself wanting to call it like it is here. WT girls who can't wait on 5-6 tables each and manage to refill drinks once is BAD.   Last time I was there may be my last....the first time I never tipped and second time I felt compelled to say something to ANY person at ANY restaurant regarding complaints. Not my style usually.   2 stars is being nice cause the food has potential..... would be 4 stars with some work though. Meh."}
{"text":"Came here for a Saving Cities Brainstorming Session. Overall, I had a good experience. The waitresses weren't phased (fazed?) by our group (12-14 people) and they were pretty efficient.  I had the farmer's omelet -- huge omelet chock full of veggies (corn, mushrooms, spinach, etc) with two slices of toast. It was around $5 for the omelet. It was good but not outstanding. It seems like a great neighborhood staple, but it's a little far for me.   Glad I was able to try it though!"}
{"text":"Service wasn't that great. When we walked in, someone told us to sit anywhere we wanted, and we waited 10 minutes for someone to acknowledge us and get drinks/menus. Couldn't even tell you who was our waitress because about 4 different people visited our table. Food was awful- cold omelette with cut up brown and serve sausage, hash browns dripping with grease and thin bacon that tasted like it's been sitting out for days. And the sausage gravy- barely had any sausage in it. Coffee cups had a thin layer of dried on grease on them too. Probably won't ever go back. I'm sure the regulars get great service and better food."}
{"text":"A greasy spoon at its best-- and not really very greasy! The food is simple, basic but done well.  Service is always prompt & friendly.  A friend and I meet here for weekday lunch frequently.  We are met with a warm atmosphere & treated with appreciation.  *Note: a decent selection of vegetarian food options."}
{"text":"We were here about 9 months ago for late breakfast.This is a local place and exactly a diner and casual dress attire.  The interior could use some updates.  I was pleasantly surprised by the meal I had which was typical breakfast: 2 eggs over easy, bacon and rye toast with home fries.  the home fries were good and tasty. The staff was friendly and the service was good.  My guy had scrambled eggs, rye toast, home fries and sausage links."}
{"text":"The food here is always fresh and delicious.  Service is usually on point, as well.  My husband and I had breakfast, this past Sunday.   The place was pretty crowded, but we were seated and our order taken right away.   I usually order the Gyro breakfast, which comes with homefries, toast (I like rye) and eggs (over medium for me) .  I also order a side of chopped tomatoes, onion and Tzatiki sauce.   My husband ordered the crazy omelet, which contains a little bit of everything....bacon, ham, pepper, onions, tomatoes, cheese etc. and also comes with a side of homefries and toast.   As usual the breakfast did not disappoint and the price was right....$17.  We left full, happy and satisfied:-)"}
{"text":"Look I'm in the neighborhood for a quick bite good service. This Greek skillet is so good"}
{"text":"The epitome of high-quality food at unbelievably low prices. I mean unbelievable; I still can't figure out how they manage to survive. The portions are plentiful; the food is incredibly delicious; and the staff is as welcoming as your favorite aunt and/or uncle.  I highly recommend trying various items on the menu, as I haven't found a bad dish yet. However, if you love burgers you need to try the 185th Burger. You won't regret it, and you'll likely mark Gus's down as a frequent visit."}
{"text":"Fast service. Nice lady servers. Really casual and reasonable establishment. Food was not that great. Blueberry pancakes were overloaded with berries . Sometimes  that could be a good thing but not this time. Cakes were gooey had no crispness  to them. Sausage links were nice and coffee flowed freely. Tables were clean and kitchen was busy. Maybe I will try something different next time.my husband said his food was ok. Eggs grits bacon and toast."}
{"text":"I love their breakfast.. If your going on a Sat or Sun make sure you call your food in; they are always super busy...  Great place to get a quick meal from.. Nothing lavish about the place but you will enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"We were visiting from out of town and staying nearby. We noticed Gus's the night we got in, and peered through the window to see if it would be worth trying for breakfast. Convinced by the classic brown coffee mugs and idiosyncratic interior design, we came back for brunch and weren't disappointed! Gus's is exactly what a diner should be.   12:30 on a Tuesday afternoon and the diner was busy serving a diverse crowd, but not so busy that the waitress didn't offer to refill my coffee every time it was half empty. Both the veggie skillet and veggie omelet had plenty of veggies, and there were two hot sauce options (Sriracha and Frank's Red Hot). The hash browns could have been a little crispier, but the fluffy texture and buttery flavor were quite good. If you're looking for a classic American diner, Gus's is the place!"}
{"text":"Great for breakfast. Inexpensive in price but the quality is good. My breakfast was $6.79 for a huge amount of food. The pancakes are delicious! Hash browns are freshly grated.   Atmosphere is busy and hurried. The decor is nothing special and lacks appeal but we go there for the food. The clientele are from many likes and we find it fun to see the variety.   We will definitely go back for breakfast again."}
{"text":"Egg white Greek Omlett was under cooked , hasbrowns were shredded not rounds and tough pancakes with watery syrup  Should have went to Adams instead"}
{"text":"Nice handmade meals...I went there for breakfast twice and left satisfied every time . When I paid it only was $20 when me and my mom ate our meals and this was fair because it was delicious. Recommend to anyone in need of a quick cheap satisfying breakfast !!"}
{"text":"Just your typical local diner. You can tell it is a good place to hang out because the servers/employees greeted so many regulars while I was there for lunch. So, atmosphere is great and the workers genuinely seemed happy to be there. Quality of food though? Eeehhhh..... Like I said, it's a local diner. Nothing fancy schmany."}
{"text":"your basic diner w/your basic diner menu but cannot complain about the overall quality of both the food & the service .. the inside was clean & the staff & kitchen was efficient .. we wlil be back .."}
{"text":"My family and I tried it for the first time recently after passing by it for years. The the food was just heart warming and plenty in portions. Will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"Good Food, Cheap Eats, friendly staff, I love everything here!"}
{"text":"Be sure to order your homefries extra crispy.  Favorites so far have been the monte cristo and everything omelette.  Pretty average but reliable spot to get some grub.  Wouldn't hesitate to grab a bite if you're hungry though.  I found it's a good idea to order fries/hash browns extra crispy.  I think the portions could be a bit larger.  Gyros are avg but tasty enough and a jumbo is nice if you like tons of cheap meat.  mmm...  There are definitely better spots out there if you're feeling at all fancy.  This is a real mom n pop place and much more utilitarian in this fashion if ya follow me."}
{"text":"Down home, laid-back place,  w/ friendly patrons and friendly staff. Blueberry pancakes was slightly doughy for me but had huge chunks of blueberries,  yum. Veggie omelet w/ extra cheese was goooooood!!! I recommend this place."}
