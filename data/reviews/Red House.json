{"text":"Western Chinese food trying to pass as Thai food. I ordered the green curry, pineapple fried rice and pad Thai. They were ALL bad.  Pineapple fried rice and pad Thai were the worst. Pineapple fried rice had cabbage and Bok Choi in it. Pad Thai was bright red and covered in sweet n sour sauce. Curry taste like water. They all had wrong ingredients and wrong flavours. One of the worst \"thai\" restaurants I've had."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai restaurant. Clean, friendly and quick service, delicious food and reasonable prices. Their lunch specials offer a good variety and quantity.  It tends to be busy, so making reservations even on a week night is a good idea.   Lots of flavour and a pleasant atmosphere make this a place that my husband and I frequent often!"}
{"text":"Love this place! It is awesome food. I have ordered here a few times and each time I have tried something different and loved it. Glad I found this place"}
{"text":"Great Chinese food with great prices! Not that over fancy Chinese food but just really good normal Chinese food. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I have NEVER written a review on ANYTHING, but I absolutely had to for this restaurant. I cooked Chinese food for years and preparing this food in such a bland way is hard to do, so bravo guys. I've ate here a few times and it's either ok or just plain not good, and I mean not good to the point where I will literally just toss it out rather than eat it. So take my review for what it is. I know the business and one review is not gonna make or break a restaurant, but they have definitely lost my family, friends and I as customers."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum yum!! If you haven't tried well then you're missing out on the best food. Love it1!"}
{"text":"Ordered through grubhub. Order was wrong. Instructions for delivery not carried out. Couldn't finish food, tasted bad. Cost too much, especially since the food had to be thrown away due to poor quality."}
{"text":"Loved it.  Good NY style Chinese.  The Ma La Lamb is legendary."}
{"text":"Have been coming here since they opened. This is happening Chinese restaurant. The food you get here is better than the food you would get from most Chinese restaurants in the valley - a good place for a Chinese food fix. The prices are quite reasonable. Their hot and sour is not so good though - too watery for me."}
{"text":"I am from the NYC area and miss good city Chinese food.  This is as close as you can get to actual NYC style Chinese food. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"If you are looking for poor food and rude staff, this is your place.  I ordered online, and for some reason, my phone number was different in the information received by the restaurant than was in my profile.  This caused a problem locating my order, although I pointed out to them that my name was on it.  Instead of simply trying to get me on my way with my order, the young man who was \"helping\" found it necessary to berate me for the incorrect phone number.  Very strange.  On to the food.  I've lived over twenty years in Asia, and still live in Japan for about ten months out of the year, so I have a pretty good idea about the food.  The pot stickers (gyoza in Japan) were dry on the inside, and the skin was soggy.  The fried rice was so dry I had to throw it away, and the \"spicy\" garlic chicken was not deserving of its name. I had high hopes judging from the positive reviews, but this place didn't do it for me."}
{"text":"Sad day. This used to be my favorite spot in town. I ordered my old favorite the \"gourmet special\" orange beef. Not what it was just a few months ago. It was soggy and very unpleasant. When I called to talk with a manager I was told that I needed to take back the food if I didn't like it. As I live across town I just have to eat the $20.  Sad, sad day."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!  If you enjoy your Chinese food soaking in oil, this is definitely the place to go.  Honestly, this is quite possibly the worst food I've ever tried to eat.  The hot and sour soup was comparable to drinking vegetable oil.  The orange chicken was gummy and had so much food coloring in the sauce it was ridiculous-SO unhealthy.  I've never known of Mongolian beef to have green peppers (green onion, yes, peppers, no) and so much oil that the description  should read \"beef and peppers floating on a bed of oil\".  My poor Mom even tried to soak off the beef on her napkin but it was still inedible.  The crab puffs were too sweet and there was nothing \"puffy\" about them. The wonton on the outside was more like a pie crust that was oily, dense and heavy. Net-net we basically threw $30 dollars away because literally EVERYTHING went into the trash. This place has some gall to compare itself to NY Chinese food. I'm disappointed in my fellow Yelpers for their decent reviews, I typically have good luck when I rely on the reviews."}
{"text":"Have been going here for years but as of this time will never order from here again. Obviously they have changed staff but the customer service was terrible, long wait times and messed up orders. Take your business elsewhere. So many other good chinese restaurants in the area. Don't waste your time and money at this one!"}
{"text":"So I was craving a quick Chinese lunch and ended up trying out a new spot.  Pretty good wonton soup and tasty fried rice, but the sweet and sour pork was a big mistake.   I should have check out yelp first.  Next time I'll try the orange chicken."}
{"text":"WOW! What a disappointment, not only was the food bad it was priced too high. We ordered take out tonight and had the Orange Chicken, Beef Broccoli, pork chow mein and the crab rangoons. The beef broccoli had this odd perfumed taste to it, almost hard to keep chewing. The Orange Chiken was OK, nothing special at all. The Pork chow mein was the best tasting, but in the whole quart was about 30 noodles. The Crab rangoons were chewy and kinda hard to chew, the sweet n sour sauce they gave to dip them in tasted like melted candy it was unedible. The white rice was not cooked all the way and was actually dry and hard. I have had some of the finest Chinese food in the world and some of the worst. This actually goes on my worst list and will never return."}
{"text":"Red House has been our go-to Chinese carry-out place for over 3 years.   The food is consistent and the staff is friendly.   For an \"I don't feel like cooking\" night, they are quick and inexpensive.  Love the Moo Shu Pork and Kung Pao Chicken, and that they offer brown rice as an option."}
{"text":"This resturant is a gem. Hidden in a plaza filled with burgers pizza and beer, this resturant stands out. The food is always hot and tasty. Me hoon goreng is one of my favorites ! Service can be slow but they are helpful and pleasent. Good place to try if you're looking for something different."}
{"text":"Best Thai anywhere.  My favorites include: red curry, roti bread, mango salad, Thai noodles, spring rolls.  They are always fresh and great tasting and prices are reasonable for the amount you are given.  I like that they have a little heating pot for their curry dishes. I hate cold food so when I dine in we can chat and enjoy a warm meal from beginning to end. The restaurant is small and simple, clean and warm. The staff is good, I usually do take out but dined in a few times. You get discounts for cash pickup. Honestly I moved to Etobicoke and still this is the only Thai place worth the drive. There is Redhouse then there is everywhere else which is mediocre."}
{"text":"So i am not familiar with what it means to have \" authentic ny chinese\" as this place advertised but i enjoyed the food here. Me and my friends were the only people seated in this very tiny restaurant on a friday night so very obviously this is a take out place.  In terms of food, i was not disappointed. The best dishes were 'amazing chicken' ( how can you not giggle while ordering this?) and mongolian chicken. The lo mein, garlic shrimp and dragon phoenix are average.  The service was courteous. Might be back for take but only when the next craving hits."}
{"text":"First review I ever wrote,  But felt I had too. I ordered a Pad Thai from here and it was horrible..  My friend ordered a ginger shrimp dish , smelt and looked pretty good. My pad Thai was a disaster,  Absolutely no flavor, not sure how it was so red in color with no flavor but oil and water.  No tamarind, no nothing that even tasted like pad thai..  There was no barely any veggies, and the cabbages looked and texture felt like it came from the dried up piece of cabbage you tear off and throw away.  Noodles were mush, just broke up into pieces when you life's them.  The chicken was cut like it has been hacked up and someone had chewed it..   I brought it home to share with my starving boyfriend who also tasted it and was disgusted..  Neither of us ate it.  We went to Wendy's instead..  I won't give them a second chance.  Who ever was in the kitchen did not care  and has no care for food, taste, look or customers.."}
{"text":"Originally from ny, I know ny Chinese. This isn't it. Egg drop soup and egg roll were good but entrees yuck. General"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in the valley !!! fresh and prompt service . prices are very reasonable!"}
{"text":"GREAT new decor. Love the food. Fresh ingredients, great taste of NY style Chinese food, love the owners. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time today to pick up lunch. I ordered the lunch special Kung Pao chicken with brown rice and wonton soup. The soup is bland and boring. Now onto the star of the show - the chicken. The first bite was much like the soup: bland. Too bad I'm actually hungry for lunch - I have to eat more so I don't starve. I get a few bites into this tasteless dish of overcooked carrots, celery, peanuts,  canned mushrooms and baby corn and cut into one of the pieces of chicken to find that it's not even real chicken breast like advertised! I'm so disgusted that I have to spit my bite out and rinse. This so called chicken breast is no better than the ground chicken and filler product that McDonald's serves. I even asked the person that took my phone order if it was chicken breast and she confirmed. No wonder the prices are so low. I will NEVER be back. I should have gone with my original thought to get Swaddee Thai. The chicken breast they serve is actually just sliced up chicken breast - no disguises."}
{"text":"I have tried a lot of New York style Chinese takeout in AZ, and what I've found is that the only place for real NY style Chinese is in NY. This place is OK I enjoyed the food and would eat here again, but nothing like NY."}
{"text":"The food is really nice. Average price for a meal. Nice place to sit in too, although it's small so sometimes difficult to get a seat when it's busy.  Staff are nice and attentive. Friendly  They have a lunch deal that they do before 3pm."}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious!  Their house special wonton soup is sooooo good.  Love the Coconut Shrimp!  Some of the best Chinese food I've experienced."}
{"text":"I'm a very anti Thai person but someone pulled me along to try it out and I thought... Well I got nothing to lose.  The place just blew my mind...  It's a small cozy restaurant with good service..good food..the curries came with a lil heat source ...to kp it warm ..thru out our meal.  Reasonably priced.. I think it's a 5 star restaurant .."}
{"text":"Best Authentic Dishes.Tthis is the best place to go in all of the GTA for malaysian. Martabek ( must be ordered ahead) is spot on, Malaysian curry is amazing. all the dishes take us back to our times in Indonesia and malaysia. The service is great, and very welcoming. It is a small place so some days you have to make reservations, because it is very popular."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the low-key look of this place, everything here is delicious! Thanks to Georgie M. for pointing out the Szechuan dumplings, they were fabulous. The best NY-style egg rolls in town, and very generous portions for the price, which is lower than all of the other popular Chinese places in Scottsdale. Give this place a try, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Freshly prepared, delicious food and friendly service. This has become a staple for good, inexpensive dine-in or take-out when you want something warm and relatively healthy. 10% discount when paying with cash.   Usual orders:  Spring Roll Thai Chicken wings Mango Salad Pineapple-fried rice Cashew Nut Red Curry Milkshakes  The Spot:  Very small, intimate place with seating that has you pretty close to your neighbours. Some may find this awkward, I choose to call it \"cozy\".   Service:  Usually a mix of the Thai ladies who own the place and a sprinkling of white girls from Pickering. I have always found each and every staff member here to be warm, friendly and accommodating (keep in mind the majority of the time I do take-out). When eating in, the dining-ware is pretty cool, and many of the curry/broth dishes are served in a mini-cauldron and kept bubbling with a small flame.   The Grub:  A caveat: the food is much better when eaten in the restaurant, in particular the Pad Thai, which suffers greatly after a few minutes cooling. I'll only go in detail about our usual dishes, but there are a variety of appetizers, salads, soups, curries, roti (much different than Caribbean style), and noodle & rice dishes. All dishes are prepared fresh by authentic Thai nationals.   Spring Roll: crispy, fresh, delicious.   Chicken Wings : AMAZING. Mild or Spicy, fried and tossed with a tamarind-based sauce, chiles and sautéed onions.  Mango Salad: fresh mango and an assortment of vegetables, not sure what the dressing is but very tasty.  Pineapple-fried rice: chicken, shrimp, cashews, pineapple, plenty of veggies (carrot, onions, bokchoy) and crispy fried onions on top.  Cashew nut: a sweet sauce with cashews, mushrooms, carrots, onions and tomatoes,  and your choice of meat (beef, chicken, seafood). I suggest beef with this one.   Red Curry: A mild coconut-curry broth with veggies and your choice of meat. Served with steamed rice.   Milkshakes: awesome and homemade, come in a variety of flavours (mango, strawberry, coconut, pineapple. I usually go coconut or pineapple."}
{"text":"The food is very good but the dining room is dumpy.  Don't take a date here if you plan to \"get some\".  I've tried five chinese restaurants in the area and this place has the best tasting food plus it's the least expensive.  Don't be deceived by the appearanace of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Tried red house for the first time tonight. It was excellent! Had the szechuan(sp?) Chicken combo, comes with fried rich and an egg roll. Also ordered the spring rolls and crab Rangoons. Very happy with dinner and will be back!"}
{"text":"Very good food and a good price, been a fan for more than a year. As other poster indicated, the place is rather small, so reserve a spot or just use the take-out which is fast."}
{"text":"Reminded me of New York. I loved it and the food was very good. Definitely going back in the future."}
{"text":"This is a small and busy restaurant so we called before heading there for dinner and requested a table for 2 at 5:45pm. We also asked if they allow BYO and the woman said yes with a corkage fee. We arrived at the restaurant with our bottles at 5:45pm to a packed room and no table waiting for us. The 2 women working in the restaurant said they don't do BYO, they made a mistake, so cancelled our reservation.  No apologies. An empty table reserved for 6:15pm was not offered to us.  We were told we could wait for a table to open up. Since we were dropped off at the restaurant we didn't have many options but had no intentions of staying at this restaurant after being treated so rudely. We immediately left and walked 5 minutes up the street to \"Thai One On\" and had a fabulous dinner with welcoming service.  We will never patronize the Red House again after this experience. Clearly customer service is not a priority for them but it is for us. Thankfully there are many other Thai options in Pickering and Red House will no longer be one of them."}
{"text":"3 stars is only for potstickers as Georgie raved about previously, however the sauce was disappointing. I enjoy thick skin dumplings which are more northern Chinese delicacies, ahhh brings back the nice memories of going off for the street side pan fried xiao long bao in Beijing and Shanghai...however street prices are usually less than $2 for 6.  The owners of Red House are indeed Mandarin natives but of the NY province as the menu says. I can't say I enjoyed the blandness of the fried rice but ill try to be back for some more stickers next time!"}
{"text":"Prices are good, food is good, and its quick....everything i love! we do take at least once a week..and there is always leftovers for the next days lunch...if you live close it will become one of your favorite in and out spots!"}
{"text":"Lots of selection, a few vegetarian and vegan options.  You choose the sauce and then what you want in it, i.e. chicken, vegetables, tofu, shrimp or beef.  Service was alright, although not everyone at our table got exactly what they ordered, we ordered a soup dish as an appetizer and it turned out to be a meal in itself, I could've made 6 servings out of the soup that they sent us.  Seating is limited, call for reservations before going so that you are sure that you are going to get a spot to sit.  They have an amazing deal for lunch if you work/live in the area, unfortunately I work in North York so it is kind of hard for me to make it here for lunch time.  Serving sizes for the main meals like most restaurants are massive, two people could eat from one order easily. (just order extra rice or noodles).  Oh an for all their dishes they will substitute rice for rice noodles."}
{"text":"My mother and I are from Brooklyn, and we have been coming here for many years now. We both enjoy the food, especially the spare ribs. This place is the closest in Arizona that we have come to a New York Chinese food restaurant. Highly recommended, we always send our friends here!"}
{"text":"Quick, tasty and cheap Chinese food.  They are very consistent and are always kind.  Just an all around solid Chinese spot."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Thai food I've had! I love their red curry and their roti is to die for! I also love their spicy chicken wings. Honestly, I don't think there's even one thing on the menu that you won't enjoy. Check this place out!!!!"}
{"text":"When we discovered this restaurant it has just opened. The food was great and it soon became a favorite. However we just ate there after a taking a break and we were really shocked at how bland and tasteless the food has become. It is a drastic difference and the prices had risen also. For the price we will choose to go to another of our favorites. Really bummed, this was so great. The service is also stand offish, when the food was great it was worth it but now we just  found it the final straw. Will not return , sadly."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I've had in a while! So delicious and so reasonably priced. My mom is gluten free and they were able to accommodate no problem. I live in NYC but would come back again and again!"}
{"text":"Red House is THE BEST CHINESE FOOD in Scottsdale and Arizona! None compare to Red House. We love them! They are consistantly good through the many years we've been taking food out at least once a week. They also deliver. You can add 'extras' to your orders to customize (like extra chicken, pork, beef or whatever for $1 or $2 if you'd like.    The vegetables in all the dishes we've ordered are FRESH, crunchy and so flavorful there's no wondering what it is. Wonderful egg drop soup, awesome homemade crunchy fried noodles that come with many dishes or you can buy a small bags for 50 cents.    The shredded pork dishes are especially delicious,  I think anyone will be very happy with whatever they order. All of the cooks (chefs)  are Chinese and the help at the counter are friendly also. It's very Authentic, as this is American-Chinese style food."}
{"text":"This is the closest to East Coast Chinese takeout that I can find in Scottsdale. Best food & better service.  Their General Tso's Chicken is off the hook."}
{"text":"I don't have much basis for the restaurant, or service inside as I've always set up for take-out. The orange chicken is flavorful and delicious. The egg rolls are crunchy, greasy, and excellent. It makes me feel like I'm eating take-out from New York. Excellent place, I've yet to have anything on the menu that's been a disappointment."}
{"text":"A violently red coloured Pad Thai. It tasted like they used sweet and sour sauce and are tryung to pass it off as Pad Thai. Tasted one bite and did not want anymore!   The mi goreng was ok but nothing special. I don't see how anyone can rate above 2 stars here."}
{"text":"Egg Drop soup is great.  Pick-up was ready in 15m.  Soup was piping hot, served the way it should be.  Garlic chicken was good, too."}
{"text":"Just a simple Chinese based restaurant.  I've been coming here since the month that it has opened and never had a bad experience.  The only thing I have seen change throughout time is the people on the counter.  Other than that, food and service has been consistent.  It is a NY based Chinese restaurant, but not the type that fancies itself.  From reading most reviews, people who see this place expect it to be a fusion of Panda Express and Pei Wei.  It's not.  People should stop thinking that Pei Wei and Panda Express is real asian food, and when something like this comes along, they claim to be an expert on how chinese food should taste like.  For those who aren't from the East Coast, let me learn you something.  NY Chinese food is considered Street Food.  It is supposed to be cheap and quick.  The taste isn't supposed to taste like it took hours to prepare, or even something that health nuts expect out of beef and chicken.  It's supposed to be dirty with a hint of flavor, thats how Street Food is.  Cheap and Quick.    Problem here is, these guys may be from NY, but just like all the other \"NY based\" restaurants, they have to uphold the norm in the city they are in.  Scottsdale isn't a cheap place, nor a cultured place for that matter.  So to actually market themselves as a NY Authentic Restaurant isn't going to work much around here.    Anyways, aside from that little personal rant ...  Service has always been good.  I usually phone them so by the time I get there, food is ready.  The people on the counter has always been helpful.  Sorry for people who get annoyed for their bad service, you can't be helped while the person is on the phone taking care of another customer.  I'm not going to rave about how great the food tastes.  If you are from the East Coast (NY / NJ / MA) then you can expect a similar taste to that style and cooking.  If you aren't from there, then you oughta give this place a chance.  Just like every new restaurant that opens, come in and give it a try with an OPEN mind.... and if you have money of course.  My gripe with the store is that they sold out.  Yes it may have similar tastes to the restaurants back home, but they sold out to try to fit the norm of Scottsdale.  Prices have risen for no apparent reason.  Fried Rice is close to $7 taxed!  That is an outrage.  I think they should take off the NY AUTHENTIC scheme and just go with a bland ARIZONA CHINESE RESTAURANT title, because that is what is has succumb to."}
{"text":"First time ordering anything and I went with the vegetable pad thai.  VIBRANT red noodles that tasted only of Chinese sweet and sour sauce. Served with lemon? Minimal peanuts? No thanks. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Stumbled on the Red House the other day.  This is the closest  place I've found to the New York / Chicago style Chinese food that I grew up with.    Very reasonably priced, good service and very good food.  It is hard to find a good egg rolls and they have them. I've had the Almond Chicken and Chicken Chowmein.  The girls had the orange chicken and honey chicken.    Nothing fancy, just a small restaurant in a strip mall with Big portions of good food.  A  great neighborhood hangout!  My new go to Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Love the orange chicken, without the onion. Taste weird the next day. Comes with house fried rice. I'm from Chicago and SO miss the authentic food. Red house has reunited a few of those taste buds and go there often for more."}
{"text":"I had the hot and sour soup, and the kung pao beef delivered to my hotel room. Both were very good! I will order from RedHouse again during my stay. I have pretty high standards for Asian food, and RedHouse did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"This place is really hit or miss. Sometimes its delicious, sometimes it wasnt worth the money. We always stick to the same items... chicken with mix veggies, lo mein, wontons. Today i found 4 grey hairs in our chicken. Not cool."}
{"text":"I know things happen but some things shouldn't. I've never been back to this place after I found a piece of metal scrub brush in my take out dish. food tasted ok but you know ..."}
{"text":"Decent Chinese food in Scottsdale.  A bit pricey for the portions, but better than most Chinese I've experienced out here.  I dig the availability of brown rice.  This place will do for takeout."}
{"text":"We just spent $25 here for two very below mediocre meals.  We came for an early dinner around 4PM and just wanted some reasonably priced but decent Chinese food. We ordered crab rangoon and placed two basic meal orders of kung pao chicken and sweet and sour chicken.  First and foremost, the only thing hot on my order of kung pao chicken was the rice which was flavorful but also very greasy. My chicken was not hot, in fact, just a few pieces (4-5) were lukewarm and when my husband took a taste of it he told me not to continue eating it. So I stop eating.  While the crab rangoon was hot and fresh, it was fried in a heavily breaded layer of wonton.   As was the egg roll. It was just weird looking and I just didn't want to eat something that looked like it had been fried a couple times. You know what I mean?  Anyways, not sure why people are raving about this place but if you are used to good Chinese food (San Francisco, Vancouver, Toronto, NYC, LA, Vegas) this isn't the place."}
{"text":"When I discovered Red House, I just knew they had to be from the East Coast. I asked them and, sure enough, they said they are from Flushing, Queens. I grew up in Queens and have sorely missed the REAL New York Chinese take-out spots that actually have different sizes to choose from when it comes to certain dishes, as well as the distinct flavor of these dishes.  The eggrolls are just like home! The staff is quick, just like in New York. And the brown sauce is excellent. I have had their shrimp with broccoli in garlic sauce and was very happy with it. I have had their wonton soup, which was excellent. I have had their chicken chow fun which was exactly like I remembered from back East.   Red House is a little slice of New York in Scottsdale. Very rare and very good."}
{"text":"I stopped by for take out.   Pork Fried Rice and Shrimp Egg Foo Young.   HANDS DOWN THE BEST PORK FRIED RICE I HAVE TASTED ANYWHERE.   Full of pork, sprinkled with bean sprouts, not greasy.  When I say amazing I mean amazing. Shrimp egg foo young was not greasy and super delicious. This place has come a long way since my bad review in 2012.   A good chef makes a difference.   WOW.   This is as good as it gets."}
{"text":"I previously rated the Red House 3 stars, but after tonight's dinner, I've decided that I now am a fan of this place.  Tonight we had the hot and sour soup (again), mongolian beef, and moo shu chicken.  All of it was soooo... good!  I previously wasn't wowed with the szechuan chicken, but everything else has been amazing.  I love the soup and the wonton strips that come with it.  All in all, I will be back and thoroughly enjoyed tonight's dinner!"}
{"text":"Not so much.  The first couple times I ate there it was good not great definitely NOT New York.  The last time I ate there it was horrible and I haven't been back.  I'm still in search of really good chinese food in Phoenx.  Alas I think its a fairy tale."}
{"text":"This is our go-to place for thai here in Pickering.  I usually get the pad tai and you get a nice large portion with several shrimp and lots of chicken.  Their lunch specials are really good as they come with a spring roll and drink.  Dinner isn't a lot more expensive but doesn't come with the extras.  My husband likes the green curry and pineapple fried rice.  This is a small place and it can be hard to get in in the evening, but you can always do take out which gets a discount if you pay cash."}
{"text":"I finally found my Chinese food place in north Scottsdale (and they deliver)! I stopped here after work. The food is really good and they are super fast! I'm addicted to crab Rangoon. Theirs is good but different than other places I've been to as the filling is slightly sweet. Mongolian beef was really good; a little spicier than other places I've been to but still really good. The trick is to keep myself from going there too much as it's super close to the office!!"}
{"text":"The only reason this place got two stars was because I was able to swallow the food. Beyond that, don't get your hopes up!   There was a total of 5 of us in the party. The space is not very big, since we took up most of the seating available. I would recommend getting take out.   I ordered Sesame Chicken and my friend ordered Orange chicken. I think the only difference our food was that I had sesame seeds on top. The food was bland and not very flavorful. I also had egg drop soup, which was like drinking hot water. The pork fried rice was probably the best part of my meal.   The wait staff was friendly and kind. Quick on service. It was fair priced."}
{"text":"Red House is a small restaurant walk in casual with big flavor.  A friend and I went for lunch to try the place out and we were not disappointed.  The food was delicious, the serving sizes were generous and the overall restaurant and experience was great."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best local Chinese take-out place I have found!  We have tried several local Chinese restaurants as we were on the hunt for some super yummy Asian eats...  Most were \"ok\", average at best, but nothing to write home about.   Red House isn't even super close to us so I was surprised when I found out that they would deliver it to us too!  The food is hot & tastes freshly prepared, not like it has been sitting on a warmer for a few hours.  The best part is it doesn't sit in ur tummy like a bag of rocks like most Chinese food tends to do. My favorite dish is the house Chow Mai Fun - SOOOO YUMMY!!!  They did mess up order once but they were very nice about it and honored their word for free egg rolls when we called again. :)  I have found my go-to local Chinese take-out place and I will look no further!!  5 stars is deserved for amazing food and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"How this place gets such good reviews is beyond me. Food is bland and tasteless. Service is average at best. The place wasn't even clean. Chinese food is better even in the Midwest than it is at this place. To each his own I guess."}
{"text":"The best Chinese food I've had in Scottsdale.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"True NY style Chinese food!  Best I've had since I moved here from NY 20 years ago. Ordering by phone is easy....staff very pleasant.  Delivery is very fast, delivery guys very pleasant as well. The food is delicious!  I've not had any meat items, but the shrimp dishes are really good, as is the lo mein, vegetables, and egg rolls."}
{"text":"We love this place. We always do delivery and they have a good system here. Food usually takes about 45 minutes to get to our house but that's no big deal.  Red House invested in a mobile credit card machine, which is awesome. You don't have to provide your card info over the phone. BIG PLUS! So you pay when the food is delivered.  Now the food: it's great! My fiancé and his friends really like their orange chicken. I love their special Chow Fun and Lo Mein. And one more item that cannot be forgotten, the Crab Rangoon. they are surprising good. We always get them too!  So, whenever we don't feel like going out or cooking, Red House is one of the top choices."}
{"text":"I have never eaten anything of such poor quality in my life. If you are going to order from here, DO NOT get orange chicken."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery. Reasonable price great food and fresh. This will be our new Chinese Friday night dinners"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Soup was lukewarm. Honey chicken so-so. I love Chinese food and I ordered from Red House many times, but something has changed. Never again."}
{"text":"Based on the Chinese food I have experienced in Arizona, this place is holding the top spot for now. Ordered the Black Pepper chicken and it was just like it said on the menu - strips of chicken breast lightly fried and coated with a tangy black pepper sauce. It also had plenty of onions and peppers and a free side of rice. Great dish. I also sampled the shrimp egg roll and it was crunchy and had lots of good ingredients inside. About 12 bucks total and the condiment area is a nice touch. Always hated asking for more soy and duck sauce from owners."}
{"text":"I moved here from NJ last July. I am used to having numerous either take out or sit down Chinese restaurants very close to my home near NYC. I have tried a few places here in Phoenix and was very disappointed. A friend lives in North Scottsdale and took me one day to Red House. Not only were the owners from NYC, but finally good NYC style Chinese food. I have been back 10 times from my home in central Phoenix, maybe 20-25 minutes away. I have had many different meals, combinations, noodle dishes, soups, egg rolls; not one mediocre or poor quality meal. The owners and employees are always courteous and friendly."}
{"text":"I have now had Red House 3 times and I think I can safely say that I have finally found a LEGIT chinese place in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area.  Everything I have had so far there is very good and very quality chinese.  I've had the szcheun shrimp, sesame chicken, and the triple delight.  All were amazing.  Their fried rice is so good.  It has this distinct flavor... I dont know what it is but its goooood.  It is a little more expensive than other quick-serve chinese places but its worth it!  Id rather pay more than eat this other garbage chinese places Ive been to in Scottsdale.  This will now be my go-to place for chinese takeout."}
{"text":"For fresh, flavorful Chinese food in a strip mall, Red House is a winner.  Much better than others in Scottsdale like Flo's or Ling and Louie and better prices.  We're originally from Seattle where good Chinese is plentiful and Red House is the best we've had in AZ."}
{"text":"Several years ago I would frequent Red House almost weekly for lunch.. Dine in or take out as it was close to my work location. At that time, it was good. It seemed fresh and hot to order.  I was sad to visit today to find the opposite. I walked in to dine and there were no lights on, the restaurant was dirty.. Ceiling leak stains, dust from the ceiling, etc. The service was not friendly and the food was far from fresh. The only items that were \"fresh\" were those that were hot from coming out of the deep fryer.   Needless to say, I will not be returning.."}
{"text":"I got a menu in the mail and I hung onto it cause it said they delivered. On a rainy day my husband and I were not in the mood to go out. We were excited when we remembered about Red House. Other than pizza nothing delivers around us. We were so disappointed. The food was horrible.  I got sweet and sour chicken, which is a classic. I ate one bite and threw it out. It had a weird banana flavor. Nothing fresh tasting about there food. My husband had the kung pao beef. Not much flavor and had some canned veggies in it.  Weeks later I am still angry that I pretty much flushed money down the toilet when I payed money for that food."}
{"text":"Great flavor. The spicy is actually spicy! Definitely two thumbs up. We had the Kung Pao Chicken and Mongolian Beef and they were both very good. The Hot and Sour soup was outstanding. Food was hot enough that it did not require reheating after the 20 minute drive home.  Restaurant was clean and staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Great place! wonton's while you wait. Best hot and sour soup I've ever had! Everything is really good. Nice clean place."}
{"text":"FINALLY, a place that makes New York style egg foo young. Most of the Chinese restaurants in the valley make a poor attempt but Red House includes the ingredients inside the patties.  They were perfect; the sauce was good. I enjoyed it thoroughly."}
{"text":"I came back to Red House today for lunch, this time I got the Pad Thai and my wife got the Green Curry. The Pad Thai was good, nothing crazy to write home about and not the best pad thai I've had in Durham or even Pickering but it wasn't a bad pad thai.  The Green Curry was FANTASTIC seriously one of the best dishes I've ever had I loved it. I had the red curry before and felt it lacked much flavor but the green curry was completely opposite I loved it! The broth didn't look like the picture another Yelper had posted so maybe the recipe has changed but I loved it I will definitely be back for the green curry.  I give a four star update only because for a Thai restaurant I expect fantastic pad thai and it was just OK."}
{"text":"So after Saturday night, I've been flummoxed on what to write on our previous go-to Chinese place.   This is a family run business, so I'm always very careful on what to write when things appear to be going down hill. Let 's just say my rating is under review, from 4 Stars to 3 Stars, to ???.    The food is simply not the same and Lordie yes, we've had better from here. In a word, it's bland and doesn't appear fresh. The pot stickers had no tasty. Both the Sesame Chicken and General Tso's, looked and tasted the same. And, the texture of both looked mushy (photo), like it was defrosted in a wok. My Hot n Sour soup was chicken broth-ish and again bland. Ugh.   Maybe the regular cook had the night off, so I don't want to write Red House off just yet. And yes, we'll be back for another try sometime soon, but... if this is the new normal, then..."}
{"text":"Great lunch specials. I had kung pao chicken, soup and brown rice for less than $6 today. The veggies in the kung pao were fresh, not frozen like some chinese restaurants. Also, their mushrooms were fantastic. They actually tasted like mushrooms as opposed to limp soggy mushrooms that spent all day soaking up whatever sugary sauce they were swimming in all day. All in all, a good, quick choice if you are in the neighborhood or want to order take out or delivery."}
{"text":"UPDATE: We are regulars now. There is not one thing on that we have tried that has been a dud. The House Wonton Soup is killer.  A little of this, a little of that, and big flavorful wontons. You get enough to share and my boys gobble this up. I'm also a big fan of the Gyoza.   My daughter loves the noodle dishes and my husband is a big Pork Fried Rice fan.   If you remember, order the donuts. They are lovely and not overly sweet."}
{"text":"Five stars from us because we just LOVED IT!!!! We ordered the orange chicken as many recommended it and boy did we enjoy every single bite of it, it was gone, none to take home as leftovers. We also got the egg fried rice, lo mein noodles and the triple delight, all so delish!   Waitress and entire staff were so friendly. Just a great place to go OR PICK UP to take home!  I really, highly recommend this little jewel.  We will FOR SURE be back!!!"}
{"text":"Extremely good New York style Chinese. The pan-fried dumplings are superb. The B.B.Q. Boneless Spareribs are really good. The Chicken Amazing is ... well, amazing! I have gone numerous times, and will go back. Five stars because it is good and the staff is very anxious to please, that puts them over the edge."}
{"text":"Red house has taken me by surprise, every time I eat there I can't find anything I don't like. Rest assured it's a good problem! Most recently indulged in wonton soup which is amazing, the broth alone is a treat. My go to dish is the garlic chicken and a side of egg fried rice. Never disappoints and they even cater to my request of making it spicy. Which is seems many oriental restaurants are a bit reserved for my palate. The food is great, reasonably priced, and the dining atmosphere is bright & inviting. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Yelp led us astray while looking for food passing through this area. 2 stars only because the service was nice, the food not as much. They were out of spring rolls. We had two other underwhelming appetizers and the chefs special short ribs and pineapple fried rice, all lacked flavor.  Inexpensive but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"We went here and ordered Pad Thai and Veg Spring Rolls. The service was decent.. The spring rolls were good, but the best way to describe the Pad Thai would be... bland. Definitely, bland. There was no real taste to it, I have to say given the other reviews I see here, I was definitely disappointed."}
{"text":"I feel like an updated review for Red House is necessary. My last review was a tad harsh, considering that the food was amazing, but the service was lackluster. I ordered a delivery lunch from Red House today, after looking at Georgie M.'s picture of the General Tso's chicken- which looked amazing!  Let me just start out by saying that it is very difficult to find decent Chinese in the Valley, let alone decent Chinese that delivers. I was happy to find out that Red House, a great local Chinese joint, delivers for a low delivery fee of $1.00 and a minimum delivery requirement of only $15.00. Most other places charge ridiculous fees and minimum orders that it makes it unreasonable to order delivery Chinese. Anyhow. Now that that's covered..   I ended up ordering quite a bit of food, but figured I'd be able to take some home for everyone else. My order consisted of two lunch specials: the Chicken Lo Mein (take home) and the General Tso's Chicken for me both with wonton soup, an order of the crab rangoons, and the chicken chow fun. The woman on the phone told me it would be about 45 minutes, and it was just that, which was no problem. If you want to pay by card for delivery, you also pay when the delivery person comes (with a handheld credit card processor). Something I like much more than reading my credit card information over the phone.   Something I always state in any review that involves delivery is the appearance and cleanliness of the delivery driver. Not only is this important, but it reflects the business as a whole. I was pleased to find out that my delivery driver was well groomed and presentable. All of the items in my order were present, and nothing was incorrect.   The General Tso's Chicken was a perfect balance of chicken and batter, with enough sauce to make the dish taste good, but not swimming in some syrupy concoction- honestly, the best General Tso's I've had in the Valley. The crab rangoons were also very noteworthy. A nice, plump amount of cream cheese and crab mixture wrapped in a nice crispy wonton wrapper. Definitely worth the $4.25 for 6 of them! I did not open the lo mein lunch special, as it was one of the dishes I was taking home, but it smelled wonderful and included a nice portion of noodles and rice (we selected the fried rice option). I tried a bite of the chow fun, which is my favorite of all Am-Chinese dishes, and it never fails to impress from Red House. A nice balance of chicken, veggies, and flat noodles, not overwhelmed by sauce or oil. A definite must-try. Yes, the lunch special portions are served in  small to-go bowls, but it is a lunch special, not a buffet. Don't expect mounds and mounds of food for $5-$7. They are lunch portions, and served as such- which are still very filling.   The cost, for all four items after the tax and delivery fee was only $27.25, which in my opinion is a Slammin' Deal, especially when you get good quality food. As for in-house visits, I don't know if I'll be making any more, but I will definitely order delivery again!"}
{"text":"We got a flyer at work and saw the lunch specials so it intrigued us to order from here one day. Also because it was super convenient that they delivered.   I had the honey chicken lunch special and thought it was quite tasty. I sampled some sesame chicken from a coworker and thought it was pretty good as well. I also had half an eggroll and enjoyed it, too.   All lunch specials come with a soup (egg drop, hot & sour or wonton) or a can of soda. I had the wonton soup and didn't like it very much. The broth was brownish and tasted like soy sauce which is a big no no to me. There isn't suppose to be soy sauce in wonton soup! Also the wontons were bleh... the wonton skin was too thick. Clearly they are the types meant for frying and not in soups.   The price was fair, though. 7 lunch specials for around $45. That's a pretty good deal. Will order here again if I'm in need for a place that delivers, but otherwise it's nothing extraordinary from the casual chinese take out joints.    *I love that they don't charge extra for brown rice **They make their own hot mustard thats pretty tasty"}
{"text":"This was an outstanding delivered meal.  It was easy to order online through yelp.  Delivery was quick.  The meals themselves were delicious and generous"}
{"text":"Great Chinese food, especially for takeout. They were fast and efficient. The chicken chop suey was awesome, full of big pieces of tender chicken!"}
{"text":"Had a very nice lunch at the Red House.  The food was fresh and delicious.  Good service."}
{"text":"Came for takeout on Xmas, that was a mistake, place was packed and a disaster. Told us 45 minutes but took about 1 hr 15. Having said that and giving them the benefit of the doubt knowing \"how good can it be with it so busy\" it was pretty good. Would go again. It's a bit sauce heavy tho so next time will order easy on it."}
{"text":"Let me start out by say I've been in the Scottsdale area for over 5 years and I have been less than impressed with the Chinese take out options. I had Red House recommended by a neighbor and was pleasantly surprised. I had the \"Dragon Phoenix\" dish and it has a generous amount of both chicken and shrimp. One person in our group is gluten free which is tough to accommodate at Asian places and they were able to do it no problem. The food was delivered quickly and was full of flavor and hot. I would order from their again everyone in our group was satisfied and I feel the price was appropriate for what we got."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in deepest darkest Pickering.  Consistently good food at reasonable prices.  I usually get the red curry chicken while my wife loves their Pad Thai.  Dinner servings are huge, you'll have leftovers!  If you're in the area and feel like the usual Thai standards, come here, you won't be disappointed.  Pickering locals know to avoid that disgusting \"Thai One On\" across the street, which charges more than Red House for really bad food."}
{"text":"So I have been here one time before and it was very tasty. However, this time was not that great. The food seemed to take a lot longer than it should. Also, our meals came out seperately. My boyfriend received his 5 minutes before I got mine...hmmm. I ordered the beef with garlic sauce and mixed vegetables. It had a sweeter flavor thatn the gentleman at the counter led on it would.  Oh well, not bad but not good. His meal was the 'chicken amazing'. Ha ha... should have been called the 'chicken not so amazing'. It was very heavily sauced to the point that near the end of the dish, the bottom of the plate was covered in this bright red-orange sauce. Again, oh well. We know for a fact that the szechuan chicken and the beef with broccoli is tasty, so try those for sure!"}
{"text":"Red House had been on my list for a while, but for some reason, I thought it was more of a sit-down restaurant.  Although there are tables, there aren't many, and the place is quite warm in the summer months.  I would prefer it for take-out, especially since I am not a fan of the overhead television tuned to a sporting channel.  I thought my food was A-okay, but not great.  I had cashew chicken which did have plenty of cashews, but it also had some globs of gelatinized \"sauce.\"  I'm not sure if this was some kind of base that didn't get fully incorporated or it was made ahead and  not reheated to a consistent temp.  In any case, it was fine, but not the best.  It was fast, and we did have good service, and I would definitely consider for take-out again."}
{"text":"Food is decent, but EVERY time I've ordered from them, they get something from my order wrong. This time, I ordered my food at 9:30pm...and they just rang my doorbell 5 minutes before 11pm after telling me 30-45 mins! Really?! Their service sucks!!  Ok, they comped the meal, so that was nice!"}
{"text":"Not a place to go for the atmosphere, but the food was excellent. Had the spicy beef (extra spicy)w/ brown rice an it was very tasty. The onions and peppers were well cooked. I normally don't like Diet Pepsi, but there's was really good. Only bad was the fried wontons (Chinese chips and salsa)-a bit stale."}
{"text":"The Red House was okay. Was a lot busier than I thought it would be.  I had the Pad Thai. It was good, but not great. I would love to go again to gve it another shot. BUt for now I will stick with this rating."}
{"text":"2.5 actually... but the extra .5 star only because of the service.  We came here on a Wednesday quite early in the evening so the restaurant hadn't filled up yet. The restaurant only seats about 30 people so if you have your heart set on coming, I suggest either coming early or making reservations.  We ordered the Pad Thai ($8.45), Thai Green Curry Chicken ($8.95) and the Beef Salad ($5.95).  Pad Thai (with chicken and shrimp): Very bland with some unusual textures. There's not much else to say about it.  Thai Green Curry Chicken (lime leaves, sweet basil and coconut cream): One note, nowhere near as flavourful as other restaurants in the area and also quite mild in comparison.  Beef Salad (lime juice, cucumber, red onions, mint and Thai dressing): You'd thinking by the combination of ingredients that this dish would be bright and flavourful but unfortunately, that was not the case. There was an odd flavour, which I assume came from the Thai dressing, that seemed to taint the whole dish leaving the flavours muted and unappealing.  The service we received was excellent but unfortunately, it wasn't enough to make up for the shoddy meal."}
{"text":"I don't think anybody can argue that the options for Chinese food in AZ basically suck. If you've ever lived on the east coast and tasted Chinese as it should be done then it's almost unbearable. Red House is the only good Chinese food in this entire state I'm absolutely sure of it.  The delivery fee of $4 is a bit excessive but the food is worth it.  I've never gotten anything from this place that I didn't think was above board. Don't bother going anywhere else."}
{"text":"Other than the food and the service, it was OK.  Seriously, the guy who took our order at the counter obviously considers waiting on customers as an annoyance. What kind of attitude is that for retail? Crabby, insolent, and no eye contact.   We had two dishes. My wife had the teriayaki chicken plate and I had the orange chicken. Although these are two very different chicken preparations (the teriyaki chicken is sauteed and the orange chicken is breaded), they both had one thing in common: they were made from chicken you wouldn't feed your family. Breast meat? FORGET IT. These were both made from stringy and fatty dark meat.  The one bright spot in this culinary misadventure was the extremely green broccoli served with both dishes. In fact, it was so green it looked artificial, and based on our experience with the chicken, I had to wonder what technique they used to make it look that way.  The restaurant was not clean. There was food on my chair (no, BEFORE I sat there!) and there was debris including a hair comb on the floor.  I will never - EVER - set foot in this place again."}
{"text":"A friend originally from East Coast recommended this restaurant as the best Chinese in Scottsdale, and it is what he is used to eat in east coast.  So far I tried chicken Egg Foo Young, fried rice, and orange chicken.   Egg Foo Young is a real Egg Foo Young. I realized what I've been eating around here was Egg Foo Youngish.  Not a real one like they  make here.  Fried rice and orange chicken was really good as well.  Very fast service, located on my way home form work, very reasonable price.  I can see myself becoming a regular here."}
{"text":"I was not sure whether to give this restaurant a 2 or 3 star. I will give them three stars but that is being generous. I read the recent reviews and decided to try this place. I ordered An egg roll and sweet and sour pork . The egg roll was good with lots of vegetables but very greasy. The sweet and sour pork was more breading than pork, greasy. The sauce was on the side which I liked. The best part of this take out meal was the brown rice. Hard to make bad brown rice. Wish there was a great Chinese restaurant in this town."}
{"text":"The appetizer wontons are fresh, crunchy, meaty and delicious! The hot & sour soup is hot AND sour (and very tasty).   I ordered the sesame chicken and requested extra crispy...but it wasn't (maybe they didn't see where I wrote that request in on GrubHub). It was still very good though. I think I was expecting the sesame chicken to resemble the yummy pictures of orange chicken, but it didn't look anything like it.   The bbq pork fried rice that accompanies it is scrumptious and love that they put a couple of pieces of steamed broccoli on top.   I will definitely order from here again (especially for the wontons!)  Bonus points for the delivery being done really quickly (estimate of 1 hour turned out to actually only be about 30 minutes)."}
{"text":"Best  Chinese food in Arizona. Pork fried rice might be the best I've ever had. Really good lunch prices too. I eat here about twice a month for their lunch specials. Good sized portions too. Their hot n sour soup is delicious. My favorite is their beef with green beens. I also like their BBQ pork, and pepper steak. I've been coming here for over 3-4 years and will continue to come back."}
{"text":"To start with this isn't a Red House. It's a small mainly takeout Chinese restaurant next to Fry's Marketplace on the Northwest corner of Via Linda and 90th in North Scottsdale. That's where the misconceptions end.   The food is excellent, the service is good and it's very busy. My partner and I had heard about Red House, but the first time we saw it was a Saturday night and we wanted something more formal. Tonight we were looking for something more casual and this place hit the spot.  We started with steamed dumplings, which while they could have been slightly better the took only a few minutes to arrive. Much different than Tottie's Asian Fusion where we had to wait 45 minutes. (earlier review). I had the Orange Chicken and my partner had the Pepper Steak with Onion. Both tasted great. This is the first time since I've been in Arizona that I've been able to get Orange Chicken with broccoli in it, like I'm used to having it in Chicago. So many places only give you the deep fried chicken in the sauce--no vegetables. The broccoli was cooked to perfection, nice and crispy.  Unbelievably the few tables they had were full with people eating in and this was on a Thursday night. Plus they had a steady stream carryout customers.   Make sure you try Red House!"}
{"text":"Im from Long island, this place, is very VERY good. Im constatly going back. What more can i say? There extremely smart fast professional and make very good food.   I love you red house Hit me with a free Szechuan chicken combo bangerrrrrr"}
{"text":"The food here is just okay. I ordered a schezwan beef and it was suppose to be a spicy dish that was not at all. The beef was just okay as well as the rice. The best part of it was the vegetables. Also ordered the wonton soup and I enjoyed the broth but the wonton was mush and tasteless."}
{"text":"order from them last night, food was cold when the driver got here. bad customer service. not recommended."}
{"text":"Good food, well priced, and good customer service.  I often use them for catering.  They are on time and correct on the order!"}
{"text":"This is a great alternative to the sit down chinese. It has strong hints of NY in the flavors. The sauces are very balanced, and less garlic-y than the other options in Scottsdale. The vegetables are fresh and fantastically prepared. The price is about $2 cheaper across the board than its competitors.  If you can appreciate NY Chinese food, and more specifically Chinese from Queens, then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"I live nearby so it's a decent place to grab some quick take out that is relatively good for the type of place that it is. Sometimes there is a strange smell in the restaurant like chemicals or mothballs...not usually anything bad enough I can't quickly pick up some food and go. Today I walked in to grab some lunch and the smell of mothballs was so strong and awful I turned around and left. I don't know what the odor is, but it's awful, and I can't imagine eating food that was prepared somewhere that smells that way. So sad as I usually like this place."}
{"text":"Very reasonable price and good Chinese take out. You also can dine in as quick Chinese fast food.  It's definitely way much better than Panda Express for sure. They cook your meal fresh and go.  The lunch menu is good deal $5.95 including soup and drink ( only she forgot to bring my soup LOL), you can't beat the price. The food is not the best but good enough for quick lunch.  The only thing that I didn't like about this place-as soon you open the door, the moth-balls odor struck your nose immediately, pew...  Not a pleasant smell for restaurant."}
{"text":"Great tasting food. Classic style Chinese food (maybe for like NY style Chinese). Very oily & lots of fried dishes. All very delicious though.   Prices are great at lunch time & you get soup, main dish, & choice of rice.   By no means is it fine dining, but its a great place for Chinese take out or for the occasional lunch."}
{"text":"Just plain nasty. Avoid.  Counter staff don't care about your being an important customer that keep them in business. Food lacks anything to set it apart from anything. Claiming a NYC style does nothing for anything but pizza."}
{"text":"I love love love them!!!! Ps try steak rolls never knew it existed. I'm a native N.Y'r finding a good Chinese restaurant isn't easy.  No matter what I've ordered its always so good. Highly recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"A few things that set this place apart from other Chinese restaurants include: 1. sweeter sauces in general 2. chicken dishes seem to be very juicy and I would assume they use better quality meat. 3. Very clean. Because of #2 I gave it the 4th star. I have never been disappointed. There is not a lot of tables here so you may have to get it \"to go\" over lunch."}
{"text":"\"NY Style Chinese Cuisine?\"  I'm from the Northeast, and trust me, this is a designation you'll find only in AZ (I'll never understand this state's obsession with NYC...).    Anyhow, I tried this place for one reason, and one reason alone:  General Tso's chicken.  For some reason, this item is left off 99% of the Chinese menu's in the valley.  Price:  To my surprise, my L30 Lunch special came out to $6.XX and included a generous portion of chicken, mixed veggies, rice, and a soda.  Even McDonald's is more expensive than this place!  Quality:  It's good, but not great.  They're a bit heavy on the sauce (what Chinese place isnt?) and the chicken's gratuitously breaded.  Regardless, the sauce was flavorful and the rice was, well, rice.  Its not \"knock your socks off amazing\" but how many places truly are at this price?  Experience:  Considering this was a quick stop for lunch, it needed to be quick.  Called ahead and my order was ready when I got there.  Guy behind the counter gave me a bag with a smile, which is all I could ask for.  In a nutshell:  I'll be back!  Solid lunch at a VERY reasonable price."}
{"text":"I was surprised how busy it was on a weekday evening and this got me excited because if this many people are coming here to eat then it must be pretty good, right? Most customers were coming to pickup their orders and it was just one after another. Reminded me of fast food Chinese take out and this is how I would compare the food quality as well. Its like Chinese take out food but with Thai and Malaysian food instead.   Chicken satay $6.95 - comes with 4 large skewers and dipping sauce which was like a peanut caramel paste. It didn't taste like it was grilled over a fire and the meat was not really tender and was a bit on the dry side. The caramel paste was okay but not what I was expecting for chicken satay.  Chicken with roti $7.95 - comes with 2 flat breads. The sauce was okay but the chicken meat it came with looked like processed chicken meat and is similar to what I would compare to chicken nugget type of meat.   2.5 stars"}
{"text":"The fried rice was disappointing as it consisted of rice and meat. No onions, green onion, etc. We ordered take out and when I called to provide feedback the staff put me on hold for over five minutes and then just kept repeating back what I had said. She finally said that's just how they make the fried rice and you have to request for everything to be added. Strange."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were very excited to find a great Chinese food go-to when we moved to the area.  Every time we have visited Red House, the people appear to be very friendly and the food is excellent.  Egg Rolls are fantastic and I love the lo-mein.  However, I'm not sure what is going on over there... Almost every time we have ordered, our order has been messed up.  Either they are forgetting something, wrong type of rice, wrong order all together.  It is certainly a disappointment when you sit down to eat and you do not have the correct order.  Note to self, we will check our orders before walking out the door."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese (Back East Style) in AZ. I always order extra egg rolls because they are great, pan fried dumpling are awesome along with pork fried rice with all white meat general tao's chicken. Many other items are great Wonton Soup, Chicken & Broccoli, Shrimp & Walnut sauce, Chow Fun is all great."}
{"text":"The food was ok but it did not shout out at me. The  Pork Mai fun noodle was bland and I had to doctor it up with curry. Most places have it in the dish, Perhaps they forgot to add it. The sweet sour chicken had no vegetables like most places. Only the red color sweet sauce and pieces of breaded chicken pieces. I have eaten at other Chinese restaurants and this lacking a lot compared to others"}
{"text":"Very high quality for delivery chinese food.  I could have Red House come to my door every night, and be a very happy man.  I had the chicken lo mein.  A wonderful comfort standby.   With one bite of the noodles I was sold on Red House.  The taste and flavor aren't really that much better than any other restaurant, but Red House delivers that taste and flavor without drowning the meal in the sauce.  My girlfriend ordered the steamed chicken and vegetables from the weight watchers selection.  She added a side of brown sauce just so she could make it a little tastier, but keep it healthy.  It's nice to see a chinese place with healthier selections.  I can't say I have seen the inside of this restaurant,  but I'm not sure if I ever need to.  The food came to my door in less than a half hour and was still pretty hot on delivery.  Prices are really good, too.  With a side of brown rice this meal was only around $20."}
{"text":"OJ chix is ok but the soy drenched not fried rice ruined it!"}
{"text":"coming from the east coast i was looking for a good delivery chinese place and Red House is just awesome. their general tso's is great, chicken and brocoli is amazing.  it's very inexpensive and quick delivery"}
{"text":"Great food and prices. Their egg noodles were wonderful and they were able to make one of my items less spicy. I also liked their pineapple fried rice - it was delicious and they added pieces of crunch. Lastly they give you free spring rolls if you order goes over 25 dollars. Too bad they don't offer delivery but you can get the food to go."}
{"text":"FINALLY!!! I found a local (within 8 miles of where I live) Chinese Food Restaurant that is great tasting and affordable. I moved here from Missouri (& Colorado & New York) and l am used to having my Chicken (or shrimp &) Broccoli in a White Sauce and they respectfully and happily made that change for me and it tasted GREAT. The House Special Wonton soup which I have not seen since NY or Colorado was delicious and a welcome favorite to see on the menu again. I also ordered the Chicken Lo Mein and it also was wonderful. I will be in here frequently."}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time and ordered several dishes. Ordered veggie pad Thai which tasted bland and very oily. We got the veggie stir fry and the lady on the phone asked if we wanted oyster sauce or soya sauce. I told her to make it how they normally do it and she kept asking my sauce preference which I eventually said soya. It was too watery and veggies were soggy. The red chicken Thai curry was nothing special. The ginger shrimp was too chewy and also way too watery. The deep fried squid and mango salad were probably the only good tasting dishes. Was not satisfied with the meal. Won't be visiting this place again!"}
{"text":"Have literally been searching for YEARS for decent Chinese takeout like I remember from my childhood in Chicago. Everything I or my acquaintances have tried in the valley have been sub par, at best. Read the reviews for Red House and thought I'd give it a try. I thought the days of me enjoying egg foo young were over until I ordered from here.  Hands down the BEST Chinese food in the valley for take out.  Egg foo young gets top marks with quality chicken or shrimp. Not slimy like other restaurants but cooked to perfection with good gravy.  Chow fun noodles were delicious and fried rice was also above average. Will be back again and again."}
{"text":"One of very few places which has NY style chicken chow mein. The egg rolls & soup reasonably priced but the large chix chow mein overpriced for the small amt of food. . Also the food made me sick so I will not be going back.  It is basically a little hole in the wall."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered it to be delivered. All of our food was hot and the take out containers were really study. Orange chicken was really good and I like the fried brown rice. The pot stickers were my fave :) Will be back!"}
{"text":"I have been a loyal customer of Red House for about a year now and I have never received such poor service!  It was just one thing after another!  First, I had a coupon for a free orange chicken and I was not able to use it though I should have been able to.  I called to place a delivery order and they informed me that the coupon was only good for dine in or carry out, though there was no indication of this on the coupon.  Then, I was supposed to get free delivery since I spent over $15 and I was charged $1.00.  On top of all of this my noodles were mushy and bland.  The delivery man was very nice but that's about the only positive thing I can say."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed Red House yet. I go here a few times a month for lunch. Definitely great lunch specials, at great prices, with nice service. Your typical NY/NJ style interior-no frills. You don't come here for ambiance. Good rice, great chicken and broccoli-and they call it Egg Drop soup, not egg flower like so many other places here in AZ. Yay..I like it!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery. Arrival time was about an hour. Chicken was severely under-cooked. We chose \"white sauce\" with our meals (Yelp's delivery order menu system defaulted it as the first item in the dropdown) but there was no sauce, white or otherwise, only soup on the side. The veggies were very fresh, the white rice was fine, and the fried rice was pretty good."}
{"text":"I can't comment on the other dishes. But I wasn't a fan of the pad thai. Very red and unauthentic."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today with a friend and it was quite delicious!  I struggle to find good Chinese food in Arizona, so I did not have my hopes up too high.  But, they're Yelp ratings made me give it a whirl.  I had the Kung Pao Shrimp, which had a good amount of spice to it.  I could taste the kick but it was not overpowering.  The lunch specials here are quite a deal, you get soup or soda with your meal.  Mine was just about $6 with tax.  My only complaint was that four shrimp in a meal is not enough.  If there would have been 5 or 6 that would have seemed right."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews and what the common thread running through the reviews was, it was NY chinese food, I was expecting something different. The owners may be from Flushing, but this food is not what I consider NYC chinese food. There are no ducks in the window, no feet in the soup, no pork buns. This is Queens, Little Neck, Massapequa strip mall chinese food. This is New Brunswick / South Plainfield, NJ chinese food. The only thing missing was the lighted picture board of the menu. It's good, it's not great. I have had better. In fact, I hate to complement anything from Wisconsin (dreadful place) but Tom's Red Pepper in Middleton, WI is actually a better version of what the other yelpers are describing as east coast chinese. The won-tons were stale. The sweet and sour sauce a bit thin. The chicken was cut rather small although it was white. I was disappointed to see it was not served with the traditional chunks of green pepper and pineapple. The fried rice was good, but very greasy and too much soy sauce. Chloe J said in her review that it had a distinctive flavor? There is nothing distinctive about onions, grease and soy sauce. The won-ton soup was slightly on the bland side. The food is okay and if someone was looking for adequate chinese, a cut above the heavily sugared and sauced up P F Chang's, I would recommend Red House. Could it be relocated to New Jersey and compete in that market? No. They lost their Flushing edge, they have been west too long."}
{"text":"Let me first say, I have been here many times and this was one of my favorite places for Chinese in the valley, but recent changes to the staff, serving portions and quality of food have made me re-evaluate my opinion of this place.  I went in today during the lunch hours, having done so many times in the past.  The restaurant was empty of customers.  I placed a lunch menu order for carry-out.  I chose the Kung Pao Shrimp (with Soup and Fried Rice).  I ordered a separate pork egg roll as they usually are quite tasty here.  When the boy was done taking my order, he sat back down at one of the tables and started to resume pulling the ends off snow peas, which he was doing before I walked in.  He never washed his hands before handing the food either.  Later, one of the kitchen staff came out front and started to talk to him in Chinese with my order ticket in his hand.  He then came to where I was sitting and informed me that he had neglected to charge me for the egg roll, but all were on the ticket.  I thought, sounds like that is your problem, not mine, since it was one the ticket that I had paid for.  I went ahead and paid the extra $1.46 for the egg roll.  When my meal was ready to go, looked in the bag.  I had a bowl in the bag with my meal.  In the past, there was a Styrofoam container with rice and entrée separated.  Not so anymore.  I asked why did I have a bowl, they explained they changed the way they packaged the meals now, but it was the same portion.  Ummm.. NOT the same portion at all.  I was still upset from the egg roll debacle and now I was getting less for the same price.    When I got home, I found they did not even bother to provide the sweet and sour dipping sauce for the egg role.  Glad I grabbed a couple of duck sauce packs before I left.  I started to eat the Dish I ordered and it was bland.  No heat for a Kung Pao dish.  The Wonton soup was also bland with no scallions and strips of pork in it as before.  The rice was very dried out too.  So sadly, this will be my last visit to this restaurant   I will be informing all my friends who I spoke to so highly of this place, to reconsider dining here as well.  The portion size and quality are not enough to make the stand out from Panda Express.  In fact, I would say you get about the same taste, but more quantity from Panda.  Darn shame, this was a diamond in Scottsdale, but now is a simply another lump of coal."}
{"text":"Sorry but I will not be going back . Their  beijing chicken had a very odd looking food coloring additive and a very bland taste.   The phone in order was very short and unfriendly.   I just will not be returning better off at Panda Express. lol sorry but that is  what I think."}
{"text":"Anyone who thinks the Chinese food here is good, has never had even mediocre Chinese food and/or has no sense of taste.  My wife and I each got something different, but nothing was even border-line acceptable.   Translation everything was bland and tasteless.   How you can do with hot and sour soup is way beyond me.  Among other things, there was no vinegar in the soup.  Adding chili oil was of no help.  The prices were OK, and the service was prompt, but I would submit those factors don't count for a  wit if the food is abysmal.  Every time I go to a restaurant,  I expect good food AND good service.   The food was a miserable failure,  so the service doesn't count.  I doubt this is the the case,  but possibly this was a bad hair day for them.  I  won't be going back, as that would be stupid of me ...there's just too many much better alternatives."}
{"text":"Pound per pound about as expensive as Pei Wei. I was expecting double portions after reading the other comments. I didn't get any left overs.  The meals came in white plastic boxes that were otherwise identical in size and shape to the Pei Wei boxes.  The didn't give me a menu, so I don't know what all they serve, but the General Tso was Tso Tso, and the white rice was very sticky, which is a plus in my book.  I think it was $20 and change without the tip for two meals and two spring rolls, no drinks. That's roughly what I have to pay at Pei Wei. The food was comparable, but generally, Red House is more typical as per delivery, where as Pei Wei is somewhat upscale quasi sit down food.  The only real advantage I see is that it came to me, not the other way around. Delivery cost $1.00 I believe, so not bad.  It took them about 45 minutes to get my food to me. The guy who delivered the food was neutral in his friendliness, which is at least better than being rude.  TL;DR: Food was clean and tasted decent, cheap delivery, average wait time, and with tip+delivery fee it cost about as much as Pei Wei."}
{"text":"Really good food! Quality chicken in my sweet n sour chicken. However, no pineapple, or peppers. Sauce comes on the side. Fried rice has bean sprouts! Love it, no one does that anymore. Also, the best hot tea I've found in a restaurant for a while. We got our food quickly, but no one else was eating in the restaurant. I think they do a lot of take out.  2 people=$ 22"}
{"text":"Not really sure where the whole \"New York\" Chinese thing comes from, because Red Dragon had the most mediocre, flavorless Chinese I've ever eaten.  Their lo mein was greasy, and the chicken and broccoli and cashew chicken had NO flavor. The wonton soup wasn't bad, but the wontons were mushy and overcooked.   The prices are really cheap compared to other Chinese places in the area, which seems to be indicative of the quality of their food. Jade Palace, albeit more expensive than Red Dragon, is a mile away and 150% better.  I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"The Roti Canai is excellent with a yellow curry that is perfectly balanced.  The soups are excellent as well at great prices.  The Pad Thai is disappointing."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place. I read the reviews about service and I thought that might be an issue and it was.   I like to look around at other peoples plates as I walk in and everything looked really good.  We ordered and when I food came they gave us the wrong dishes.  My wife got mine and I got hers. We both had chicken dishes but with different sauces.  Mine spicy, hers milder.  I thought that the plates look like they should be switched around but when the server sat them down he announced the correct dish. As a matter of fact my wife's came out about 3 mins ahead of mine. So he announced the name of the dish correctly as he sat it down before us.  All through the meal I keep thinking something is wrong.  I kept asking my wife, \"How is it\" and she would reply,  just OK. Then finally after I consumed about 80% of my meal I took a bit out of my wife's dish. Sure enough, I knew for sure then.  She has my spicy Black Pepper Chicken. Had I discovered it earlier I would have said something. A little ticked off that they told me the wrong dish as they plated it.   Also there was no forks anywhere and when I asked for one I got a bit of attitude it seemed.  Thinking of going back.  The two bites I took of my wives dish was good. I ate an order of something I didn't like, didn't order and yet consumed. Disappointed for all the wrong reasons."}
{"text":"Good stuff for a mostly take out Chinese place for in Scottsdale.  New York style Chinese food with all the standard offerings.  Lunch specials come with choose of rice plus soup or soda for under $6. Portions are  satisfactory.  The hot and sour soup is better than average for Scottsdale.  Everything was fresh and the service was very quick.  Not really a sit down restaurant, but what seating there is is comfortable.    I recommend Red House for value and quality Chinese food in north Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Great egg rolls, boneless spare ribs are the bomb! The sweet and sour chicken's chicken is all white meat and the prices are huge, chicken and cashews is really good with sliced chicken instead of their normal breaded and the roast pork or chicken fried rice is really good too."}
{"text":"It was cold and I wanted hot and sour soup.  I was surprised to find that it was more of a fast food set up.  Which was fine.  Within 2 minutes of sitting down at a table, the hot and sour soup came out.  It was mild.  Not spicy, not too sour.  Which means you can add to the flavor with pepper or soy sauce.  I'm okay with that.  Some places make it way too sour.  You can't take the sour away after that.  The lunch prices are very reasonable.  I would come back and try something else on the lunch menu."}
{"text":"The egg roll was quite honestly the best I can remember having, and I have had a lot of them... And the pork in garlic sauce was fantastic! There wasn't hardly anyone dinning in but take out, jeez I guess the Red House is known about because it never stopped! Amazing food, thanks!"}
{"text":"Listen people. This place is an absolute GEM. Amazing customer service. EXTREMELY quick. INSANE quality. I very rarely try new places...let alone Asian cuisine, but this place absolutely rocks. Go check it out!!"}
{"text":"2.5 star + 0.5 star (because it is in Pickering?)   I circled this strip Mall twice before I find Red House Thai & Malaysian Restaurant.. The sign is really small.. or I am just getting older?!   The waitress here is super nice and welcoming... and when she knows that we speak the same dialect, she got more exciting and even went into the kitchen and tell the chef that someone here eating speak Cantonese... sigh.. is it a good sign?   Lunch Specials serves from 11 AM to 3 PM Daily... starting from $6.95 includes 2 spring rolls and a pop.   Mee Noon Goreng Chicken ($7.45)  - it is really vermicelli stired fried with chicken and veggie in a Sambal Sauce  - It is served in a metal wok... sigh...  - not bad, but I think I can do it by getting a bottle of Sambal sauce from the supermaket... it lacks the real taste and kick of authenticity  - Spring Rolls are frozen supermarket varieties too   It is a little unfair to based my review on just one visit or one particular dish... but really sometimes it is the first impression that counts...   Red House Thai & Malaysian is a decent restaurant in Pickering area because of the limited in choices... so if you are in the area and you want an Asian food fix.. you won't be disappointed.  BTW, the lunch menu online is outdated.. they changed the offereings and the price a little bit."}
{"text":"We are in love with Red House.  Period.  Anyone from New York will understand why.  Just good, no-nonsense Chinese.  Authentic dishes and dishes that appeal to the masses.  We would dine here everyday if we could - definitely one of the best Chinese restaurant in the North Scottsdale area - if not in AZ.  And reasonable given its location.  My fiance and I both say we are extremely lucky to have found each other - since we prefer Asian cuisine over anything!  (Sometimes I feel like he's actually the Asian and I'm the Caucasian!)  Our standard meal consists of 1 Eggroll for the fiance (super super good - New York style ALL the way).  Maybe the  Szechwan appetizer sampler depending on whether it's on special (comes with chicken skewers, fried shrimp, an eggroll - the chicken skewers are amazing - you can order these separately as well).  Seafood Hot and Sour soup is usually the choice (good amount of shrimp, scallops, they even throw in Kamaboko (in Japanese - or fish cake).  Not a lot of places do that.  My only complaint about the soup is sometimes it's not enough sour for me, or spice - but still very good.  Considering I basically have no taste for spice - I'm sure to the average diner it would be plenty spicy.  And then onto the mains.  No matter what our standard is the House Chow Mai Fun.  FIRST of all  - I haven't seen Chow Mai Fun since I lived in New York - no one that I know of makes it here.  House Chow Mai Fun is a dish that consists of  Mai Fun noodles (very skinny rice noodles - the same ones that are used in Singapore Noodles) without the curry sauce.  The noodles are stir fried in a light sauce with veggies, and meats/seafood.  Soo amazing!  Trust me - I love Chow Fun (wide flat noodles) but this is such a light yet flavor full dish (where Chow Fun can be heavy with the wide noodles and thick brown sauce).  Then our second dish is either their House Tofu or Triple Delight.  We've also had their spicy eggplant which is amazing!  Also sampled the Shrimp with Walnuts - generous portions of shrimp, maybe just a little too much of the mayo sauce - but still yummy!  The only dish I've had that seemed not up to par with their others the House Pan Fried Noodles (which can also be called Chow Mein Hong Kong Style). The noodles lack the flavor and consistency than those of other restaurants, and the sauce is too much like the sauce they use on their tofu.  It should be slightly different but it literally tastes like the same dish (just one is served with noodles).  Cost wise Red House is more than reasonable!  Our normal Eggroll, Seafood Hot and Sour Soup, Chow Mai Fun and whatever our second entree and a large order of rice (see below) ends up being about $33.00.  Very generous portions!    Why the four stars? Two reasons. One: the restaurant itself is VERY small.  Although normally there is ample seating, when it does get busy the place can feel a bit claustrophobic.    The service is so great though - everyone is super nice and accommodating (and super super hard working!)  We normally take out, but there are some occasions we just need to sit, relax, and have our food come out piping hot from the kitchen!  The second reason for the four stars is a small one.  The meals only come with a small white rice, so we have to order a large.  And they charge you for the larger order.  Cost wise, it's not that much more, but still - most Chinese restaurants will supply you with all the white rice you need.  But seriously - such a  small price to pay for excellent Chinese!!  One other note - they do have lunch specials for very cheap so make sure to check them out!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised overall.  Had two dinners here; one takeout; other in dining room.  Pleased that they would customize one entree.  Very pleasant staff; fun that two children helped serve meals.  I enjoyed lemon chicken and beef snow peas.  Generous size portions.    Thanks, Red House"}
{"text":"You start off with fried crisps that in our case were stale. The pork fried rice was tasty.  The General Tso's Chicken was decent.  But the hot and sour soup was not good.  I chose water as my drink and got it from the soda machine.  It tasted awful and smelled weird.  And that brings me back to the hot and sour soup ... it tasted like it was made from the soda machine water.  Same weird taste and not spicy nor sour.    The unisex bathroom needed to be updated or something.  It appeared somewhat clean but it was so dated it felt dirty.  Smudge marks on the walls, a dark ring in the toilet, and cracked dark tile on the floor."}
{"text":"This wasn't good Chinese food. Looking at their menu it seems like their roots are in traditional Szechuan food, however it's taken a departure from what it seems like it's supposed to be. I ordered four things; the ginger beef, the sesame chicken, the shanghai noodles, and the panfried dumplings.The only thing that I actually liked where the dumplings. The sesame chicken was not sesame chicken at all, it was sweet-and-sour chicken, with a completely artificial sweet-and-sour type sauce that was bright red, totally soggy, and tasted like very old fry oil. The ginger beef also had far too much breading, tasted of that same old fry oil, and was completely soggy as well. The shanghai noodles were really just chow mein with a overly five spice flavored sauce, sad vegetables and meat assortment on top.This is not the way that shanghai noodles should be. The noodle type was completely wrong it should be a wheat based thicker noodle that is pan fried with more of a light oily brown sauce these were deep fried and were chow mein noodle or otherwise known as egg noodles. If you don't mind completely Americanized Chinese food then you might love this place, but if you're looking for authentic Chinese food stay far away."}
{"text":"If you love Thai food this is a great place to get some in Pickering.  One of my faves is their roti with curry.  It's sooo yummy.  They also have pad Thai, and Thai corn cakes which is delish.    A must visit if you're in Pickering and need a place to eat."}
{"text":"Besides the egg rolls, I wouldn't consider going back for some food... I can't believe that people would order from this establishment"}
{"text":"Simply the best chinese take out I have ever had. the steamed vegetables with tofu are not only healthy but also delicious. Very surprised! PS: You will love this place if you are from Taiwan like me."}
{"text":"Excellent local chinese food very authentic. They have many good dishes you can't go wrong with any of them. My favorites are the house egg foo yiung, shrimp and lobster sauce and moo shu pork. They also have very good soups and crispy noodles for the soup."}
{"text":"I got: Egg drop soup Vegetable lo mein Fried rice  Egg drop soup was gelatinous, so off putting. I shared a video to show this. Not good at all. Taste was very mild. This is the worst egg drop soup I have tried  BF got wonton soup, which he loved, so dont write off all soups they offer.   Vegetable lo mein was lacking any discernible flavor. Good texture.  Fried rice was good, would order again. I wish they offered a vegetable fried rice option. Pork probably gives it all the flavor, but I always get a taste of what I can only describe as \"dog smell\", like when you can smell a dirty dog when they come up to you, with pork. Call me crazy but I just dont love the way pork tastes/ smells"}
{"text":"I was craving Chinese food in Scottsdale, and stumbled across mention of this place as genuine N.Y. Style Chinese. Having been raised on the east coast, I grew up eating great ethnic food in general. I love Chinese food, and haven't found great Chinese here in Scottsdale since my favorite closed back in 2001.   Reading the various reviews, I noticed that while some of their ratings were pretty high on various review sites, there appeared to be some inconsistency in the diners' experiences. I was wanting good Chinese enough that I decided to take my chances and perhaps find my new favorite Chinese place.  I decided to eat in since it was about 15 minutes from home for me, so that I could enjoy the food right out of the kitchen, piping hot. When I arrived there were no diners seated in the restaurant, so no problem with getting a table. It is a small place, with no real ambience, but that didn't really matter - I was there for the food.  As there appeared to be no table service, I approached the counter and ordered Hot & Sour soup, which many reviewers had raved about, the House Egg Foo Young which had also gotten good feedback, and substituted fried rice for white rice for only a dollar extra. I also requested that broccoli be added to the Egg Foo Young. The young lady working the counter was perfectly friendly and helped me make the adjustments I wanted.   I sat down and watched as a steady stream of people came in to pick up take-out orders. Most were apparently regulars which I took as a good sign.  My Hot & Sour soup came out very quickly, along with crispy Won Ton chips with a sweet dipping sauce. My soup was good, but not over the top. It was bit thinner than I anticipated, and I can't say it was the best Hot & Sour soup I have ever had. For the price, it was just fine however. Just not as much flavor as I had anticipated from reading the reviews.  My Egg Foo Young came out with perfect timing just as I pushed my soup bowl away. It was a HUGE order, and looked perfect. Brown gravy and Fried Rice were served along side. The Fried rice looked delicious, and I started with that because the Egg Foo Young was still extremely hot.  I would have their Fried Rice again in a heartbeat. They were generous with the bean sprouts and green onions, and there was a nice amount of broccoli stir fried in. It also had peas, onions and carrots. The rice was nicely cooked too. It did need a bid of soy sauce but that was easy to fix.  When the Egg Foo Young cooled enough for me to eat it, regardless of how wonderful it looked, it was a little bid heavy. It is still the best Egg Foo Young I've had in Arizona. Both the Egg Foo Young and the brown gravy needed soy sauce to perk them up. The Egg Foo Young was LOADED with chicken, shrimp, chicken, pork and veggies, and the oiliness of the patties was offset by how thick and loaded with ingredients each patty was. The oil did not saturate them. Although is wasn't quite what I had expected, I would order it again.  If I were back on the east coast, I would have rated this 3 stars. I gave it 4 because it was superior to what I've had here in Arizona over the 16 years I've been here.  As I ate, the steady stream of take-out and delivery orders continued. No one appeared to have to wait for their food any longer than it took to pay for it.   I want to return to try some of the other dishes on the menu. Perhaps tonight just wasn't their best night, but it was good enough.  They only deliver within 5 miles of the restaurant. I had planned to have it delivered, but I was 2 miles too far away."}
{"text":"Fantastic dining experience with very flavourful food.  Favourites include: cashew nut chicken, murtabak (not certain of the spelling) and fresh rolls.  Seriously can't go wrong with many of their dishes."}
{"text":"My family and I just finished dinner. It was great! First I think we are a little out of the delivery area but they came any way! We placed the order at 9 and it came in 30 minutes. Every thing was still hot and the Togo containers are awesome not the typical styrofoam ones. It's so hard to find good delivery but we came upon this gem! Thank you red house!"}
