{"text":"My husband and I really welcomed this Vietnamese fare near our son's swimming class, so we come here every weekend.  Our favourite is the Pho and the sandwich.  We usually order 6 sandwiches; giving some to friends and eating the rest of breakfast the next day (in which they still taste amazing just slightly toasted in the toaster oven.) 

A little patience with the staff goes a long way at this restaurant due to the level of English, but we've always had excellent service.  

They recently renovated the interior to add more seating and a somewhat more updated look.  They also have the traditional ceramic tea cups now  :)

Excellent value for money in terms of the quality of food vs the price!"}

Highlights and FYIs:
- \"Meat-like\" flavours and visual appeal
- Attendant's English is alright, but not great; I don't care the food is good!!
- Cash and Debit (above $15) only

Vegetarian? Or want to cut down on meat? Miss Vietnamese cuisine flavours? Or just curious?? Visit this hidden gem! 

I discovered this restaurant through Happy Cow. My wife and I visited Tinh Tam Trai in Jan 2017 for dinner. They told us they opened up 2 months ago, so it's fairly new. 

OVERALL... experience was a big POSITIVE for me. Our cuisine is largely vegetarian/animal-free and one thing that I missed quite a bit was Vietnamese Pho and the Vietnamese rice dishes. The food we ordered closely resembled the traditional Vietnamese 'meat' dishes in terms of the depth of flavour, visual appeal and texture. Definitely will return for more!

DETAILED REVIEW

Place
- Bright, warm, welcoming. Has lots of green plants at the entrance!
- Very clean
- Location is in the outer rim of Vaughan Mills next to Captain's Boil, in the same area as Bulk Barn and TD Bank.
- 4 tables in total (2 x 2 seaters and 2 x 4 seaters) [I think]

Food
- Orders
+ \"26. Vietnamese veggie spring rolls (Goi cuon)\": The fried spring rolls which traditionally has pork in them. A well executed dish. It had 'meat'-like fillings and the rolls were stuffed to the limit with it. Served with a 'fish' sauce that closely resembled the actual thing, but not overwhelming (usually it is quite smelly).
+ \"1. Assorted imitation meat Vietnamese sandwich (banh mi thap cam)\": The baguette, my oh my. This was made fresh. The baguette crush was just unbelievably good. Now I did inquire as to whether there was mayo. Given the minor language barrier, I'm not sure... I believe she said there was. Regardless, the mock meat was excellente! Definitely tasted like the traditional assorted cold meat which I loved.
+ \"9. Phnom penh style noodle soup (hu tieu nam vang)\": Hands down the best vegetarian pho I've had so far. It was a little too meaty tasting for my wife's liking. I really enjoyed it, hit the right spot, ooh yeah. It is a clear broth with a deep, strong flavour which was excellent for the chilly evening. There were tiny 'meatballs', with some 'fish cake', 'pork belly' and 'shrimp' as well. The texture, visual appeal, and taste of the pork belly was amazeballs! The shrimp's bounciness was surreal.  This is a definite must try! We were recommended to get \"10.\" or \"11.\" next time.
+ \"16. House special rice (com tam tinh tam trai)\": This consisted of rice, cucumbers, tomatoes, grilled 'pork', 'pork skin', and side dish made of 'eggs' and vermicelli. The texture of the grilled pork was executed so well. I cook a lot but I was baffled as to how they pulled it off! The pieces are flat and somewhat hard, to imitate the rough texture of meat. You can tear away the layers of 'pork'. The flavour had the right sweetness like the traditional VN grilled pork. The 'pork skin' mirrored the actual dish, kudos to them again. Now, the side dish made from 'eggs' and vermicelli. This is steamed and I'm not 100% sure if it's egg free. Will clarify next time, but I believe it is made out of tofu. Definitely tasted like egg though! Vegetables were fresh and rice was cooked perfectly.
- They also had a large variety of desserts and hot foods in stainless steel trays (similar to how Jesse Jr displays their food; I have no clue what they are called... I'll take a picture next time).

Price
- Items were generally less than $10. I think it's falls in line with most VN restaurants. Free parking too!"}
{"text":"The food is AMAZING! The portions are very generous. The service is fast and friendly, though there may be a slight language barrier (\"authentic\" experience?!). This was my first time there, I will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent vegetarian Vietnamese dishes, with generous serving sizes and even better prices.

We had the pho, another noodle soup, two side dishes and banh mi to go. Let me tell you, it was excellent. The broth was so flavourful -and the mock meats they use taste better than I've tried in other places.

Their spicy bbq 'pork' banh mi... soooooo good. 

The staff is so nice. It's a cute place with a few seats. I wish they had a location closer to where u lived. I highly recommend trying this place out!"}
{"text":"Great place for Vietnamese vegetarian food.  Very economical and delicious food.  Not upscale  but acceptable.  Definitely a recommendation from me."}
{"text":"This place has the best vegetarian Vietnamese dishes and at such a great value. Their broths are so flavourful and their mock meats  are so real. My favourite is their bun bo hue. Ive grown up eating banh mi, and I have to say I now opt for their vegetarian banh mi over meat ones. My family has become regulars here. The staff is also really friendly."}
{"text":"By far the best vegetarian restaurant ever! First time here. They put so much effort and thought into their menu and food! Ordered the \"roast pork\", it looked just like roast pork! The house sandwich was my favourite, a must order! I can't stop raving about this place. The people were very nice too, which is always a plus! It's a small family business, hopefully it stays in business forever!"}
{"text":"I came here for the Pho. I noticed that they have $3.50 sandwiches so I ordered one too. The sandwich is delicious and good portion size that I didn't expect from a $3.50 sandwich. The pho tastes delicious and quality mock meats are used. Service is very friendly. Cash only so bring cash.

Overall this is a vegan Vietnamese restaurant that is delicious and affordable. I absolutely recommend it."}
{"text":"Great vegetarian option if you want Vietnamese food. Usually I find Vietnamese dishes a bit meat heavy. This is a great place. The staff was friendly and quick. The food was delicious! The best was the duck noodle soup for me. The fried noodles were also very delicious - crisp and perfect taste."}
{"text":"I came here in a group of three, and only one of us was actually vegan but we all enjoyed the food. I had the vegetarian banh tam bi, which was really good! It tasted just like regular banh tam bi. We also had a stir fry noodle dish and vermicelli with cha gio. The staff here are really nice and even gave us a free tofu pudding to bring home. I would definitely come back next time with my family to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"I have been here twice for lunch. Had the vermicelli and house banh mi. Both were delicious. Fair prices. Banh mi was $4.50 - great for a quick lunch and it comes out warm. The complimentary tea was also amazing. Small family size restaurant, so wait times might be a little long for the food but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Great Vietnamese vegetarian option in Vaughan. Great tasting food. Large portions. Lots of options. Very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"One of the best vegetarian restaurants I've been to with an authentic Vietnamese menu. The food was delicious. A bowl of freshly prepared #10. Bun Hue along with #25. Crispy fried veggie chicken sticky rice.
Highly recommended for vegetarians. Will definitely return. 
P.S. The staff is fluent in Cantonese."}
{"text":"Wow, the food is SO good here. The imitation pork is really crispy and very close to what real pork tastes like. The sandwiches are equally as good and are affordable at $3.50 each. The lady was quite nice and gave us samples and a free dessert to take home. I would definitely come back as this is one of the best vegetarian Vietnamese restaurants that I've ever had."}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh food at a good price point!

Came here on a Saturday afternoon; there were a couple other groups also dining. We seated ourselves and were served tea not too long after.

Decided to go with the banh mi xa xieu which was incredibly flavourful and just delicious! And a great price at $3.50. Also had the noodles with spring rolls and mock meatballs. The spring roll and meatballs were perfectly fried and had a great crisp to them. I didn't love the meatballs - their flavour reminded me a lot of pork floss (dried shredded pork) which I wasn't into. Boyfriend really liked it though. My only gripe with the dish would be that it could come with more veggies.

Lastly, we had the banh it tran (available weekends only) which are sticky balls of chewy dough filled with mung beans and in this case, bits of imitation meat. It was very fresh and the filling was nicely seasoned but beware - the sauce that comes with it is quite strong so I'd recommend dipping it as you eat rather than pouring the whole thing on top which is what's normally done (and what I did).

The service was fast and friendly. I can't comment on the language barrier that others have mentioned since I spoke Vietnamese with them. 

Total with tax and tip for 2 people for a light meal was $22 - a good value for such tasty and fresh food! I'm looking forward to trying many more of their dishes!"}
{"text":"Food tastes good but everything is too oily here. We ordered a banh mi to go and they forgot it in the oven, at the end my banh mi was too hard & crunchy :( They knew that but still served me that one."}
{"text":"Amazing food, I admit I was skeptical being vegetarian but this place has situated everything and it's all delicious!!! The broth was 2nd to none, so I have found my new favorite soup spot."}
{"text":"The best vegetarian restaurant and the best Vietnamese in town. Very clean. I tried most of dishes in the menu and very satisfied. The best is Hu tieu Nam Vang, Pho and Banh my."}
{"text":"I came here with my friends on a Sunday afternoon and we got seated immediately. I decided to get the pho, while my other friends got the fried egg noodle and the bamboo shoot noodle soup.

The pho has a very nice, fragrant taste to it, and it was probably the best dish out of the three that we got. The fried egg noodles tasted good, but I could tell it was somewhat saturated with what I think is MSG. Nonetheless, it was still tasty. The bamboo shoot noodle soup had a very unique taste - almost sweet, but still flavorful. The clear noodles in that soup got thicker the longer it sat in the broth, so it soaked up the flavours pretty well. The bean curd and mock meats in these dishes were very tasty!

In terms of service, the washrooms were really clean and the owners were really nice. However, they do not speak English very well. They do however, speak Vietnamese, Cantonese and Teochew. I *highly* suggest you download Google Translate app and ask questions through it if you have any special accommodations you need to address. Otherwise.... this place is pretty bomb!"}
{"text":"I came here many times. I cannot believe I have not reviewed this place yet. In summer used to go to wonderland then have dinner at this place we usually get the sandwiches (bang mi) they are great a fulling for a low price. I tried the all and they all worth trying. They also have pho which what I came here for today. They also have some spring rolls and bubble tea. So you can't go wrong with comming they have everything. 

Will recommend this place to everyone and they should check it out."}
{"text":"This was an extremely authentic vietamese restraunt.  There were large portions and lots of food, and it was rather cheap.  Definitely would come back. Side note: don't get the spicy noodles."}
{"text":"UPDATE: They've redone the interior to increase the amount of seating (almost doubled - maybe 40 seats?). The lighting has changed to be much more pleasant. And they now serve with proper glassware/tableware. It's by no means upscale or nice-looking, but much more acceptable. Washrooms are also in excellent condition. The menu has even been expanded and they offer a lot more. It's quite impressive what this place has become. They accept CASH and DEBIT only ($10 min for debit)."}
{"text":"I never thought I'd end up eating banh mi again. I came in thinking it was just vegetarian but was told it's all VEGAN! I had their house special combination and I blew me away. I had to get a second one. I'm just sad it's so far away from me!"}
{"text":"The vegetarian food is awesome but the service is very slow. All the staff were like day dreaming while we had lunch there. Their English is very limited so be very concise and use visual aids. I will only go back there when I crave for Vietnamese vegetarian good and have lots of time to kill."}
{"text":"Delicious! And great value. This place is located in the out parcels of Vaughn Mills Mall. At $3.50, the 'pork' sandwich is a great deal. The soups and stir fries are very good too. 
From reading the other reviews, it seems this place used to be smaller. But they now have 5 tables that sear four, 3 tables at seat two and one table that seats 8. Perfect for lunch."}
{"text":"Delicious and carefully crafted vegetarian food. A must try veggie restaurant! The imitation sliced pork is very tasty"}
{"text":"I recommended you guys to try their bun bo hue chay and the bun tam bi chay is amazing.Excellent customers service owner is very friendly.Thank u"}
{"text":"3.5 stars
Note: cash only

I came here for dinner because I noticed photos of the Phnom Penh style noodle soup, one of the dishes that I missed after the closing of Pho Anh. Our group ordered the spring rolls to share. It was somewhat difficult to communicate with the wait staff for small changes to the dishes or even to ask for water. Fortunately one person in our group spoke Vietnamese. We later found out that they also speak Cantonese.

The spring rolls were tasty. They use taro instead of pork. The noodle soup bowl is huge, so come hungry. After tasting the soup, I could tell immediately that it was vegan. It doesn't have the hearty flavor that comes from meat. Instead, it had the same flavor as faux meat. The noodles were tasty. They did a great job of making the faux meat (pork, shrimp, and fish balls) look similar to real meat. The taste and texture on the other hand were not similar, though. However, it tastes similar to the faux meat that I've had at other restaurants in the GTA, so I can imagine that vegans/vegetarians would enjoy the food here.

The restaurant has 5 tables. 3 that seat 2 and 2 that seat 4."}
