{"text":"I think sometimes a when people hear a place is great, it may influence the reviews they give it, and I think this place is an example of that.  This place serves okay food, has an okay wait staff, has average to high prices, but really does not live up to the many glowing reviews that it has, rather it appears most consistent with reviews like this, where it is okay, but not tremendous.  We ordered three pizzas for the 7 of us, and our opinions were all about the same, they were okay, but not great, one was truly sparse on the toppings.  The beers we ordered were good, but not cold and the glasses not chilled."}
{"text":"Fantastic food & drink. Great selection of lunch and dinner foods.   The patio seating and bar are fantastic."}
{"text":"I think this pizza is absolutely great to be honest.   I live in Arizona, and i'm always on the run because of my Job, and let me tell you, it's always good to have good fast food close by.Everything, from the texture of the dough all the way down to the sauce and crust itself was very much so pleasant.    Goin' out for pizza in the AZ area?I suggest this stuff right here.  5 out of 5 *****."}
{"text":"This place was excellent!  I went with a friend and we had the capresse salad, the bruschetta, and two pizzas. All were fantastic, the service was good and friendly. I would definitely recommend to friends and go back."}
{"text":"When I visited az again I came across this place..amaz! Great food. Great service. Great lasagna. # cheat day!"}
{"text":"The pizza was prepared to perfection. Then the owner came out with lemoncello liquor shot that was delicious. The servers were amazing! This will be a regular date night spot for me and the honey."}
{"text":"nice atmosphere, great wait staff, and good pizza. the creme limoncello after dinner will definitely do the trick!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, definitely one of the best I've had in the US (I am from Italy). The atmosphere was very friendly and the owner even offered some Italian dessert and his homemade pumpkin liquor. Really great food and great experience."}
{"text":"Awesome service and great pizza, super friendly staff.   I ordered a Toto Sapore and when it came and I saw it, it reminded me of some good Grimaldis pizza. Then I tasted it and I immediately noticed a difference. The bread was soft yet perfectly cris and the toppings was absolutely delicious and high quality.   The staff was great and we got to meet the manager because of a minor hiccup and he made sure we were more than satisfied at the end. That's a huge plus on customer service and a guarantee that we will tell our friends about this place."}
{"text":"Pizza is awesome, words simply cannot describe the orgasm going on in your mouth....true story folks!!!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I have ever had. The principe is exquisite. The Ingredients are fresh, housemade, and high quality. The owner and chef Mateo is very hospitable and loves to visit with his customers. He even presented additional dishes and ingredients to try. Fantastic overall experience."}
{"text":"If you haven't been here, GO! First time I came here I returned twice in less than six weeks. It's as good as Bianco's without the three hour wait. Salud!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, wine wonderful and fantastic service. The limecello and latte excellent."}
{"text":"As close as it gets to Italy. One of our favorite places in the Valley, Pomo never disappoints. Every pizza is superlative and the charming atmosphere - created by the sincerity of owner, host, and server alike - cause you to feel like you've come home. Start with the prosciutto-adorned cantaloupe and be sure finish with the complimentary house limoncello. Made from a fourth-generation family recipe, this delectable milky, citrusy goodness is the perfect way to end a fantastic meal."}
{"text":"The place is small but decorated well. I loved the pizza. The staff was fun and seemed proud of the restaurant. I've gone twice and each time the pizza was amazing. I tried the pizza that had four different toppings on different sections. It was a great sampler. It's probably my favorite pizza place in town. I actually like it better than Pizzeria Bianco in terms of taste and bigger menu."}
{"text":"Mauricio is delicious! Oh...and so is the pizza!  Always amazing and scrumptious and the special limoncello after dinner shot is better than dessert."}
{"text":"Just went there to celebrate a birthday and this place is outstanding.  I told the server and after a delicious pizza was pleasantly surprised with a canoli. The owner himself came over and it was all very nice.  The pizza I ordered was so good that I'm thinking about it now and can't wait to go back to try other things on the menu. Also would recommend trying the Blood orange drink.  Really enjoyed it!  Great place for a date and also a celebration, i.e. birthday or anniversary.  Highly recommend this restaurant and hope to return soon."}
{"text":"I've been to Italy a bunch of times, Naples included and I can safely say this is the closest I've ever experienced to true Neopolitan pizza in the US.  Really fantastic:  I had the Napoli pizza and it was just amazing.  Add to that the service, the extras (fried something or other and a very nice home made limoncello) and this place is an absolute winner.  Can't recommend it more highly."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing.  Went with friends in from Chicago last weekend for the first time, we all loved it.  Went again last night with friends and they loved it too.  Right now it is my new favorite pizza in the valley.  Had the traditional margarita pizza both times .....so good.  The crust is so tasty...so happy to find a place like this here.."}
{"text":"It's a nice place to go on a date or a girls night to have drinks and catch up. I went for my pick up order and as soon I walked in, the staff acknowledge me and offered something to drink while I waited for my order."}
{"text":"Pizza is ok, but not comparable with Pzzeria Bianco.  And since Pizzeria Bianco now has 3 locations and no more wait (at least not more than any other good restaurant) I rather go to Bianco any day of the week.    perhaps my mistake was that I went there with my wife on a \"date\"  we both love pizza and I just know that if I had taken her to Bianco she would have been happy, but after this place she hardly wanted to go for dates anymore.   The place is tiny. dark and was empty that night.   Service was great, the pizza is good, and certainly better than the average pie but not really that special  the ingredients are very good, but it was soggy in the middle.  But overall the ambiance is missing and the location is at least at night a bit lonely."}
{"text":"They make a de margarita . They make a de pizza pie  . You wanna de pepperoni or you wanna  de plain pizza pie .They make a de perfect pizza in them we all should  trust . you wanna  de thick pizza then go to pizza hut .  Primo Pomo Pizzeria  ."}
{"text":"Pomo Pizzeria is absolutely fantastic to anyone that likes first rate Italian pizza/calzones that is made to order with fresh toppings on a light airy crust. In addition, the assortment of Italian sodas is terrific. I would highly recommend and will be going back very soon."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best pizza and service. I highly recommend the lodgiano pizza - not on the menu. A margarita base with delicious mushrooms and shaved cheese. Use the spicy olive oil to dip your slices and you're in heaven."}
{"text":"Probably the best pizza I have had in Phoenix. Everything was top-notch including the excellent service and the friendly manager who took great care of us. We started off with the bruschetta and it was delicious; fantastic balance of mozzarella cheese, crunchy bread and tomatoes. We followed that up with the Quattro Stagioni pizza, topped with Italian sausage, saut√©ed mushrooms, salame de Parma and olives; a combination so good I can't wait to go back and try it again. We ended the evening with a dessert made with Nutella that was chocolatey and decadent and to die for. To top off the evening the manager brought us a shot glass of Crema de Lemocello; The perfect ending to a wonderful meal."}
{"text":"First time trying Pomo last night. Quite a wait but completely worth it. Tip - you can call ahead and reserve a spot."}
{"text":"this is the BEST PLACE FOR PIZZA sorry Arizona this is the real thing the taste the cheese and the owner is great comes around and gives you this SHOT OF LIQUOR from Italy which is the DEAL SEALER!!!!   Dont expect some PAPA JOHNS style they have a small menu and the pasta is on another LEVEL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! GO NOW"}
{"text":"David the bartender is an awesome multi tasker. I sure wish i had an employee this talented and professional. The food has been wonderful so far. Fresh and imported ingredients. Even my body builder guy enjoyed the food.  Most of the time he is anti Italian food. Pomo has a great atmosphere in addition to pleasant people service and outstanding food"}
{"text":"The food was unbelievably fresh and good! Love the vibe of this place and the staff was great!"}
{"text":"Pomo is the best pizza in Phoenix. It is Naples pizza through and through, and the owner brings each guest a gratis cordial of his homemade creamy limoncello after each meal. It is not out of the ordinary to order one pizza per person. It is amazing. Get the Principe (the one with rocket on it.) Wow."}
{"text":"Attentive, friendly service and delicious food. Can't go wrong with the downtown Phx restaurant."}
{"text":"In town for business, and I would have never guessed such a welcoming and well crafted pizza place would be in Phoenix. Loved the wise guy, well layered with a great dough base. The atmosphere was perfect with a great ambiance and enough energy to make the place feel alive, but didn't leave you raising your voice to engage in conversation with companions."}
{"text":"I went in 10 minutes before closing. I was worried that I had come in too late to order. The waiter, Maurizio, was so gracious and accommodating. He said it didn't matter, they would make whatever I wanted. I wish I could remember what I ordered because it was the best pizza I have ever tasted. When I go back to Phoenix, I will be making a special trip back to this quaint pizzeria."}
{"text":"Yay x3 as I have found my new favorite restaurant in downtown phoenix! As a pizza lover, (i know, aren't we all), I was excited to give this place a try. My husband and I sat at their bar, and well, the service we had made us still feel like we were on our honeymoon. The bartender was great, and the food...EVEN BETTER! It sealed the deal when we had the FREE limoncello and warm, sugar-powdered dough chips. Who doesn't like free sweet treats?  If you haven't tried this place yet...What on earth are you waiting for? Your tongue and tummy will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Recently had a wonderful dinner here! We started off with an order of bruschetta, which was incredibly fresh. Then we each had a personal pizza, the Regina Margherita and the Pomo. All of the ingredients were perfection and the dough was nice and thin. While we were waiting on our tiramasu (which was incredible) the head chef Matteo brought us a cinnamon liqueur that tasted like Cinnabon in a shot! The service was great, the patio was pleasant, and the food could not have been better."}
{"text":"Tasty, if pricey. Four people. Four pizzas - all came out one after the other. Great thin crust. Tasty toppings. Only thing that kept me from giving this \"top of everyone else's list\" establishment five stars is the pricing. A simple 13\" pizza should not be $15-$18."}
{"text":"Simply amazing.  Three friends and I came by Pomo on a Saturday night around 7:30. Most of the tables were full, but we didn't have to wait. We opted to eat outside even in winter as it was a nice night and the space heaters provided plenty of heat. We loved the feel of the place.  We ordered the bruschetta to start, and it was delicious. It was especially divine with the spicy olive oil drizzled on top.  We ordered two pizzas: the Principe with prosciutto crudo, fresh arugula, and shaved parmigiano and the Toto Sapore with Italian sausage, pancetta, salame piccante and prosciutto cotto.  Between the four of us, there was enough food to share. We loved being able to try two different pizzas. The Principe was delightful - especially the thinly sliced prosciutto. I had it with some of the spicy olive oil, which made it perfect. We all also enjoyed the Toto Sapore. The meats were delicious. All the ingredients on both pizzas were of great quality.  To end the night we ordered a tiramisu to split. The slice was large and perfect for each of us to have a good sized piece. We also enjoyed the little pieces of heaven they bring to everyone at the end of the meal - thin and crispy fried dough pieces covered in powdered sugar. The owner also brought out another dessert even after all of that - some sort of yummy cake with mascarpone. We were happy!  Price is decent too. For the four of us, included tip, we each paid $15.  Will definitely be back again for the good pizza, dessert, service, and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Love, love, loved it! This place is a home-run. My husband and I have become Neapolitan-style pizza connoisseurs over the past few years. Pomo pizzeria is the real deal with lots of authentic Italian ingredients & flavors. Any place that serves oregano in a shaker on the table is authentic Italian.   We were disappointed that the Sicilian arancini is not served at the downtown location, but settled for the Mista salad, which is a perfect, light starter. The owner dropped off a thick balsamic vinegar to add to it... divine.   For the main course, we ordered our standard - the Bufala Verace (basically Margherita with Bufula mozzarella). And it was fantastic, must order this! We also ordered the Cappiccosa - also delicious, but one slice was enough for me, and I was back to the Bufula.  Sauce is generous, but not excessive. Crust is thin & light, but thick enough to hold the slice & eat without knife & fork.   The native Italian staff was friendly and the Southern Italian owner delivering the complimentary crisps & limoncello (best we've ever had, by the way) really put a nice finishing touch on our meal."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and staff was very friendly and attentive - providing recommendations when I was ordering and always checking to see if I need anything else or refills.  Had the Principe Pizza (prosciutto + arugula) and it tasted very fresh with a great balance of sauce, cheese and ingredients on an amazing crust.  The owner also brought me a free plate of fried dough with powdered sugar as dessert towards the end. Who can say no to free desserts??"}
{"text":"Wonderful place! Love the Pepino pizza! The service was absolutely wonderful! They were quick to get the pizza out to you. The powdered sugar dessert was delicious. Love the service, they know how to keep their customers happy!!"}
{"text":"- definitely a date place, romantic but a bit busy in a fun way - great service and server, fast, attentive, charismatic - GREAT pizza, i say that as a pizza snob - its a bit small, so i wouldn't go there with more than 4-6 (max) ppl"}
{"text":"This place was delicious! The pizza was great with lots of authentic choices. I really enjoyed the atmosphere as well! The complementary fried dessert was the perfect end to a great meal!"}
{"text":"I think I'm starting to take this place for granted - shoot I almost decided to give this place 4 stars instead of 5 because I don't get quite as excited as I used to about this place since I have been here too many times and it is no longer \"a treat\"....what was I thinking.  Anywho, the pizza here is amazing Neapolitan style pizza.  I think they've even been certified by some Italian Neapolitan association (along with only a couple other places in the Valley) that relates to the methods of cooking the pizza - so that's pretty cool I guess?  Does it make the pizza taste any better than the Italian style Pizza down the street? Who knows, but it clearly isn't hurting!    If I had ever been to Italy this would also be the section of the review where I ramble on about how it reminds me of that little Pizza joint just outside of Naples I went to and yadda yadda.  Check it out for yourself - I don't care if you are a deep dish person it is worth it."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place in downtown phoenix! I've had the chance to try quite a few since I live downtown, but this restaurant has the freshest ingredients and most inviting staff. I love coming here!"}
{"text":"I used to live about 25 ft from this restaurant when it was formerly  Sens.  Let's just say, I am glad I no longer live 25 ft away from it being Pomo-I might have gained 100lbs!    As far as pizza in downtown Phoenix goes, I know everyone loves Pizzeria Bianco.  However,  please try Pomo when you just can't fathom waiting 2 hours to eat.  You will not be disappointed!  The pizza is delicious and the owner is absolutely the nicest guy I have encountered in the restaurant industry.  Like many other reviews here, we received the complimentary Iimoncello and fried bread for dessert. Yum!   The owner overheard me saying to my group that I really wanted a different dessert than what we were going to order.  He came out and surprised me with it for free!   We were all so grateful and impressed- please enjoy this awesome downtown restaurant!  The food is wonderful, and the service is beyond excellent."}
{"text":"Was back in town and a friend suggested pomo again. This time it was plain bad. The pizza came out fast but it tasted too salty and the tomato sauce was very sour. Pretty good service but with high prices and bad pizza I won't go back."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying the food was delicious: my boyfriend and I each got pizza and they were really good. But the service was awful. Fifteen minutes after being seated, we still hadn't been served. We never really had a waiter: a man (who I think was the manager?) ended up taking our order and, although he was really nice, he was busy with his other work so we never really saw him again until the end of our meal. By contrast, the table across from us had two servers: a server who did his normal duties and another server who they seemed to know and who came to the table to chat, no exaggeration, about every five minutes. I actually thought she was just part of their party at first since she sat down with them a few times. It was odd, since there seemed to be so many servers on duty to be completely ignored. I loved the food, but I just felt like I overpaid for such an irritating experience. I'd suggest takeout, since eating in is an exercise in frustration (unless you know one of the waiters personally)"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food and service at Pomo! We shared the grilled veggie app and a pizza with ricotta, salami and sausage - both GREAT. Our waitress was very nice and I loved that the owner came to our table after the meal with a complimentary fried dough dessert and shots of a yummy cinnamon drink that he made. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on our way to a concert based solely on the appearance of the inviting patio. Duvel on tap, nice decor and some very tasty pizza. The owner even stopped by to check on us. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"First of all the service was really good. Our drinks never hit empty. Our food was out in a timely manner and did not disappoint. Pizza was great and the Pana Cota is excellent. Eat it!!"}
{"text":"Great Pizza but the service was even better!  The staff could not have been more accommodating.  I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Not sure what the bad reviews are about. I have been coming here since they opened this downtown location. The food here is amazing and authentic which is how you would get it in Italy... The dough is amazing and it's a secret on how he makes it! The pizza is awesome and the deserts are great too. The employees here always welcome me and the owner always makes a point to shake my hand and say hi. It does get busy here at times but the service has always been good. The complimentary fried dough with powder sugar and the limoncello is a nice touch! Try this place out I'm sure you will love it!"}
{"text":"OMG first time eating here and everything we had was amazing: bruschetta, salad, pizza, pana cotta, cannoli, coffee and after all that the owner gave us a a shot if their homemade limoncello.  Our server was very friendly. Next time I'm in downtown Phoenix this place is a must!!"}
{"text":"Did I land in Italy? This place is great. Delicious...from the salad to pizza to wine to dessert. And great service too. I've been happy EVERY trip I've made here. It's pretty small, so don't be surprised if there's a wait on a weekend night...everyone else wants to go here too!"}
{"text":"Food was so good. Little pricey on the wine selection and when asked if we would like the bread with olive oil, the waiter didn't mention there was a cost to receive it."}
{"text":"Best pizza in AZ!! Just got back from Naples and this is right on point with my local joint Acqua Farina. Love all the small touches and perfect service. I wish they had the same access to seafood though!!"}
{"text":"Don't write many reviews but had to for this place. Amazing first impression !!!. It is authentic, friendly, tasty, and satisfying.  So glad it's in downtown.  I hope to become a regular at this restaurant."}
{"text":"The more I visit this downtown pizzeria, the more I'm convinced it can compete for best Neapolitan in the city. Pomo offers a really great combination of flavors that results in an entirely satisfying experience.   The pizza is made in a traditional wood fired oven and it really shows in the lightly charred and spotted crust. The flavor in the crust itself is solid, and it serves as a well textured base to the pizza. The thinness of the crust is perfect for Neapolitan pizza. My only dislike here is the lack of oven spring on the ring of the crust, as the crust seems to have lost some gas somewhere along the way.   The sauce at Pomo is the centerpiece of the pizza. Pomo delivers a bright and simple tomato sauce with well-balanced acidity which blends itself into slices of fresh mozzarella. There's a great ration of cheese-to-sauce, as Pomo avoids a tendency of some Neapolitan places to undercheese the pie. The cheese avoids any unwanted browning and mixes really well into the overall flavor profile.   Pomo's Principe introduced me to the magic of prosciutto and arugula and I've yet to find a place that does it better. If you're not loving the slightly steeper prices on some of the pizzas, you can't go wrong with their margherita either.   Pomo matches the quality of their pizza with attentive service and a friendly and generous owner. One negative however- the \"house bread\" looked and tasted like it came out of a sandwich bread bag. Not the level of effort I expected after tasting their pizza. However, even that's not enough to prevent me from giving it a 5-star rating.  If you're looking for some of the best pizza in Phoenix and would like to avoid the line at Bianco's, Pomo is nearby and serving their own Neapolitan pizza on par with almost anything else you'll find."}
{"text":"Wow  What a fantastic pizza, light and crunchy crust. Sweat sauce with just the amount of topping and cheese.  Very authentic Italian atmosphere complete with a shot of a sweat liqueur at the end of the meal.  Highly recommend this restaurant for those people from out of town who want a light meal."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times but this time was particularly great. My roommate and I came up for a quick snack after studying and had a really nice time. Great ambiance and welcoming staff! Especially our bartender, I think his name was Clay? Was super knowledgeable on the ingredients and menu. Helped us pick out a great pizza and kept us entertained :) we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Last time my husband and I went here gave it 5 stars.  Tonight dropped family off at airport and decide to go by myself instead of battling traffic.  Ordered a bottle of wine, bur-rata and a white pizza. The pizza came out first which was fine because I told him it was fine for them both to come out together but he did not bring me any olive oil.   The wine bottle came to my table already opened.  The waiter did not even pour my first glass for me or any  after.  I asked for it to be corked when I was finished with my meal, he pulled  a cork from his apron and put it on the table.  Since it was plastic I could not cork it my self, another waitress brought it inside to the bartender to cork.  My waiter brought my bottle out with a broken cork that was not the origin to my wine.  To make things worse I never got my limoncello!  I know I sound bratty but I am a teacher on a Friday night just expecting good service"}
{"text":"I love Pomo. The pizza, wine selection and desserts never disappoint. Great atmosphere as well. I am so glad this restaurant is close to home."}
{"text":"Staff is not friendly and the look on the person who brought us out food was like I hate you and my job.  I do have to say best pizza in town. Salads are fresh and the dressings are homemade."}
{"text":"Simply delicious!! Amazing does not even begin to describe the food, all of it is hand made with the highest quality and expertise!! Highly recommend!! Please stop by and enjoy the Italian family atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh salad and pizza ! We shared the mista salad. Fresh greens, cucumber and grape tomatoes with thinly sliced Parmesan cheese. Then we ordered a pizza 1/2 and 1/2 the Pomo and the contadina. Service was excellent!"}
{"text":"OMG!  I love this place.  I loved it when it was in Scottsdale!  I lived in Italy and if feels like I am in a pizzeria  there.  The authentic ingredients, the 90 second baking in the authentic oven...the sauce...I LOVE IT!  And I love the owner..he is so funny!  I recommend this place.  If I lived downtown I'd be here ALL the time.  Can't wait for the new Scottsdale location to open again.  Bravo!!!"}
{"text":"Automatically garners 5 stars,My family and I visited this location and had a great meal and time! , The food was fantastic and the service was friendly helpful ,They have excellent customer service ,I love coming here, Love the food!!,Will be back for sure....."}
{"text":"If you're looking for great pizza in Phoenix this is the place to go. Everytime I go I am reminded of the pizza in Naples. Amazing! Pizza is spot on! I recommend the Diavola or the Bufala Verace."}
{"text":"Due to an early dental appointment I was only able to have the tomato soup. It was excellent!!! My coworker had the Quattro? Pizza which looked great and he commented that it was good. He ate the whole thing. A bit pricey here but is worth it. Also a hipster type feel as well."}
{"text":"Best Pizza Ever.  Maybe the only real pizza I've ever had, now that I know what authentic napoletana tastes like.  the Chef and waitress were both extremely kind, and offered us desserts on the house =]  I've never been this sad when my tummy got full, cuz I couldn't enjoy any more of the most delicious pizza taste that I have ever experienced."}
{"text":"Loved the Panini...the bread is make there and ingredients is fresh..You gotta try this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Delicious wood fired pizza with maxing key friendly staff. Great bottle of wine. All topped off with complementary, homemade Lemoncello. Perfect dinner after all day hiking. This was our first trip but made it onto the \"must return\" list."}
{"text":"This is our second time here and it only got better since our last visit. Best pizza in the valley. Try their organic Italian sodas with the pizza and be prepared to fall in love."}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous experience tonight. My wife and I have been two other times, but couldn't wait for 1.5 hours for a table. Tonight we could have had a table but chose to be seated at the bar.  Our server, Amber, was attentive and gave us excellent recommendations. My wife had an Aperol Spritz (a drink she had in Italy this summer), and I stuck to red wine.   We started out with the bruschetta, she had the capriossa pizza and I had the diavola pizza. Each pizza was superb. Instead of red pepper flakes, they have this red pepper flake oil that is divine. The owner came by the drop off freshly grated Parmesan that was to die for along with Italian dried herbs that we did not use.   Following our meal, we were treated to some complimentary pizza crusts topped with cinnamon and sugar.   Will absolutely return to this gem in downtown.  Ciao!"}
{"text":"Not only is this the best pizza in Phoenix, it's among the best I've ever had (and I have spent a few weeks in Italy). And we got free lemoncello!"}
{"text":"Every part of the dinner was exquisite.  Not only is this authentic, it is delicious. We started our evening with cocktails and an amazing bruschetta. Our server, Kathryn was poised and knowledgeable.  All of the ingredients are flown in from Italy.  We followed up with two pizzas. Each was remarkable.  Finally we shared one of the best panna cotta we've ever had. But wait!  Just as we thought we were done, out comes the owner with  a creamy limoncello.  We will definitely be back. This place knows how to do things. GREAT JOB!"}
{"text":"First timer. Brought my little girls in. Staff was great. Pizza was authentic and tasty. Fresh ingredients. The chef even brought something out special for the girls."}
{"text":"I love this place!  And to have it downtown now is perfect... I don't have to go all the way to Scottsdale.  My boyfriend and I went after the gym Sunday afternoon.  We were headed to Matt's breakfast, but it was packed.  I got the bufalo pizza, he got the trio (or one with lots of meat), both perfect as usual!  Love the food here.  So far my favorite pizza in town.  There are so many downtown all a little different and thankfully with Pomo here I don't have to wait in line at Bianco anymore."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere, drinks, and food! Will recommend to anyone visiting Phoenix. Thank you."}
{"text":"Well let's just say I was not impressed. The food was just okay. I had the lasagna. The main problem I had was they don't offer a side salad and when I asked if they could put a little salad on the plate with my lasagna they refused! Seriously and you call yourself an Italian restaurant. I don't think so. Also, very expensive. Not at all worth it."}
{"text":"Claiming \"imported Italian Porcini mushrooms\" is misleading when the mushrooms clearly came from a can and were literal piles of brown goo. They were inedible, and I tried. The sauce also tasted canned, which is fine, but at least spice it up a bit with some Italian herbs, right? I also wish the basil had been added fresh and not cooked on top. The crust was good though and the owner was very friendly."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! This Pomo Pizzeria has the best service and is very fast and friendly. It totally deserves a 5 star rating. Definitely my favorite place to get pizza"}
{"text":"I am Italian/American and expect authentic Italian when I try a new restaurant. And this was a pleasant surprise! Nice setting and very good, friendly staff. Owner is a real gentleman! You too will be impressed! Worth a visit..."}
{"text":"Gorgeous atmosphere, good prices and excellent recipes. Almost feel like i'm in Neaples. Definetly i'll be back."}
{"text":"After a date to the Phoenix Symphony, we walked a bit to find this small and well reviewed pizza place. We had never been until tonight.   This may be my new favorite restaurant. It's so phenomenal that even writing this review creates a division in me because I want to keep it a secret BUT more than that I want it to thrive.   Wow. Literally the best service I've had possibly in my life, the freshest caprese salad of my life, easily one of the top 3 pizzas of my life (we ordered the pomo which is mushrooms, red bell peppers, onions, and sausage... It's much better than it sounds) and some very good ambiance.   We ate outside and the weather happened to be ideal. (March nights are great) The bar next door had enjoyable live music too. I am shocked that this place is all around as great as it is.  If you can, stop by with an open mind and an empty stomach. You will not be disappointed. Possibly best of all, the bill for both of us to eat very well: 26 bucks.  Wow.   *standing ovation* Bravo! Encore!"}
{"text":"Best new place in Phoenix. Our Authentic Italian pizza was unbelievable, our beers were cold and dessert was to die for."}
{"text":"My friends and I love pizza and we decided to try this place that we have heard so much about.  We arrived at 7:00P to an already full restaurant and put our name on the list.  They said it was about a half hour wait so we went to the bar and ordered drinks and waited for our table.  The bartender was friendly, efficient and engaging.  In almost exactly 30 minutes our table was ready and we went outside to the patio to be seated.  Our charming young waitress was Celine (as in Dion) and was very knowledgeable about the menu and helped us make some choices.  We ordered two kinds of bruschetta as appetizer while we continued to enjoy the downtown scene and our cocktails and conversations.  The bruschetta arrived and was covered in contents!  Delicious!!  We quickly devoured then ordered our pizzas from friendly Celine.  The pizza here is Neopolitan style (very thin crust).  They arrived in no time and each one looked and tasted amazing.  I can't pronounce the names but we had three different ones plus the Mista salad and each was done perfectly!    After dinner while we were enjoying ourselves and finishing up, the owner of the restaurant came by with a tiny after dinner desert plate consisting of what seemed like pastry of some kind with powdered sugar on it.  Nothing fancy, but a nice complimentary gesture they do for every guest after dining.  On top of that he brought out four little shot glasses and began to pour a yellowish mixture from a bottle.  He said it was his own blend of lemoncello and cream and he thanked us for coming in and said he hoped we would be back.  What a nice finishing touch to an already wonderful meal.  The shot glass size lemoncello/cream was delicious and something I had never thought about combining.  Celine came back again to thank us for coming in and urged us to come back again.  This will definitely be added to our regular pizza dining experience in the future!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza joints in AZ. Decor and ambiance makes for a nice date night or even a casual lunch/dinner outing. Our service is always outstanding. the Bufala pizza is a must try! simple ingredients and full of flavor."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite restaurant next to Cibo, because if one gets flooded with tourists, the other can be a backup. This place offers quality pizza and great cannoli. They even have this food (I don't really know what it's called) that's easy to chew and taste like nothing so it's basically a vehicle for powdered sugar and chocolate sauce. These are the reasons why I think Pomo is a great restaurant. Stop reading this review now."}
{"text":"Great dinner last night at Pomo! Wish this little gem was in OC. Everything from wine, salad, pizza to the limoncello and sugar dough was spot on!"}
{"text":"I know I'm like the hundredth person to post  about this place but its worth it. This place rivals pizzeria Bianco for the best pizza in Phoenix. Which is saying something.  We got here and the places was slammed. Sat down and service still kept up. Food was awesome. And they hook you up with free fry bread and lemoncello at the end of the meal. This place is nuts everyone should be here."}
{"text":"This is a very special place, possibly the best pizza in Phoenix. I waited too long to write a review, so I can't give as much detail as I'd like.  I had the Don Alfonso, with sausage, red peppers, and salame piccante ferrarini. It was fantastic. Every element was extremely high quality. The pizza was flawless and delicious.  I had come in after 1:30, so the place was quiet and I got to interact with the owner. He was extremely friendly. At the end of the meal, he brought some free dessert -- they were flaky, crispy frybread-like things, dusted with powdered sugar. Excellent. (Sorry I don't remember the name of the pastry.)  For me, it helps to place them on a scale compared to other gourmet pizza restaurants. Here's the breakdown: Pomo is better than The Parlor, Il Bosco (in Scottsdale), and Hungry Pie (Scottsdale).  The only places that could compete with Pomo are Bianco and Piazza al Forno in Glendale. It's been so long since I've been to Bianco that I just don't know - I'd need to go there again. Piazza al Forno is the only place where I remember feeling the way I did when I was Pomo - where I was hit by a train, where my life was interrupted by this sense of \"Holy shit, this is not a normal Phoenix upscale hipster pizza place (which are, admittedly, pretty good). This is a whole different ride.\""}
{"text":"First time. Nice atmosphere. The food was good - but missing a little something too, flavor-wise. I also thought the presentation could have been better. That said, we will occasionally return and test out other menu items and see where it leads us!"}
{"text":"Hey Yall...I would have given this joint 5 stars and posted this amazing picture of this lasagna, but because  I am all about  free...I didn't receive fried dough nor my free limoncello...I'm not even pissed that I had to send my cool temperature lasagna back because it taste awesome. However the lack of my free ness cost this is amazing picture of this amazing food. Then I ordered the Panna Cotto and my life changed...INSERTS ANGEL...the joint is totally freakin awesome. Oh with my dessert arrived my limoncello this limoncello...it sinfully disrespectfully delicious I felt like I was stealing something while I was drinking it never a good sign, truly an orgasmic experience..even though there are 17 waitresses they work and move in sync like a Olympic  Swim Team...kudos ladies!!! Asking me if I will come again is not the question... the question is how soon will I return...ASAP"}
{"text":"Came for dinner before going dancing. Nice chill vibe with pretty good cocktails. I tried their calzone & it was really good; authentic brick oven taste."}
{"text":"The service was great, don't get me wrong.  However, I was really disappointed with the food, we ordered the Caprese and a Margarita with mushrooms. The Caprese came out first and the tomatoes and mozzarella were really poor quality. It's not like I don't realize tomatoes are out of season but they could really do better than that. The mozzarella was just bad over all, the texture and taste. Seeing as how bad the mozzarella was, I had our waiter change the cheese on our pizza to the buffalo mozzarella which was like 3$ more just to hope it would turn out better. Our pizza arrived, I expected the buffalo mozzarella to be a bit more watery, but our pizza was literally flooded with the water from the buffalo mozzarella and was a nightmare.  I don't drive all the way out to Phoenix often, and I usually just do it to go to nice restaurants I find on Yelp. Such as Bianco, Matts, and Atoyac; and I always seem to have a good time and experiance at all of these but this place let me down."}
{"text":"Had one of my all time favorite dining experiences here.  My sweetie and I sat at the kitchen table, had great drinks, and shared a delicious pizza. We split a tasty dessert, and we're surprised with complimentary Limoncello shots.   Left tipsy, satisfied and delighted. On par with 4 star places that cost 3x as much."}
{"text":"I can't in good faith give this place more than 3 stars. I'm actually pretty surprised there are so many 5 star reviews. Nevertheless here is my opinion and experience here.   We arrived right when they opened at 11 and put enough money in the meter for an hour and fifteen minutes. All the while my boyfriend laughed at me for wasting my change on being over zealous. We were the only guests thus far and were seated right away. Everything was clean and nice as far as tables, chairs and decor.   We got 2 waitresses as one was training. Having never been here we decided to try the meat, cheese, and olive platter. I was excited for it to bring back memories of my grand parents from Sicily. We waited, and waited, and another table was seated next to us. We waited some more and our waitresses returned to take our main course order. We were told to try the margarita pizza and regaled with tales of being certified all the way from Italy itself, which I can only assume, is the justification for the pricing. The sauce is even out of a jar shipped all the way from Italy itself. However, our pizza would supposedly be cooked in sixty to ninety seconds (yes, that's what she said) so at least we wouldn't be waiting?   Finally our appetizer arrived with paper thin (warm) bread. The bread was inviting and the olives were great. That's about all the praise I can dish out for the meat tray. Even my boyfriend who, being a typical American male, lives for meat and cheese trays, was disappointed. Granted it was a lot of food. There wasn't enough bread for the whole tray. So if you're a party you might want to ask for extra bread if you decide on this lack luster adventure.   By this time the restaurant had filled and tables around us were chattering away and eating. Yet we sat, and sat. About 45 minutes after we arrived our pizza came to the table, while everyone around us was finishing their lunch.   I will be honest. It looked sad. Sauce everywhere, barely any cheese, and small pieces of basil that adorned 2.5 slices of the 6. I stared at it for a few minutes before taking a slice and trying a bite. My fears were substantiated tasting sauce out of a can or jar that had traveled half way around the world on a barge, probably next to a container of leather flip flops, and crates of Nutella.   I learned to make a five hour sauce from my grandmother. I'm quite frankly appalled that a self proclaimed Italian pizzeria is not making their own sauce.   Five minutes after our pizza arrived a man came and put a container of cheese an oregano on the table. My boyfriend dumped some cheese on his slice and said \"try some, it'll help.\" I tried and decided it was no use.   For dessert we tried the Nutella cake. While it didn't taste much like Nutella (more chocolate), the strawberries and whipped cream were phenomenal.   I can't say that I'd make the trek again for strawberries and whipped cream. If we return it'll be for sauce less pizza only."}
{"text":"I like to keep it simple with pizza, and the Sauce and crust are perfect. Wish they had better wine prices, but overall very good pizza."}
{"text":"I had been looking so forward to dining here, and was not the least bit disappointed.  The service was incredibly friendly, the food delicious and the ambience cozy enough.  Our server might have been new as I ended up having to open the bottle of wine for her.  A funny moment, though I can imagine some stuffy customers not being so patient.  The night was capped off by a visit from the owner with two shots of limoncello and some delicious powdered sugar covered fried dough.  My lovely date and I argue to this day about what they were called."}
{"text":"Pomo, I love you.  The dinning experience at Pomo was amazing.  Although the restaurant was fairly busy, we received our pizza's very quickly. The pizza's were hot and delicious.  The service was exceptional and it didn't hurt that our waiter was Italian; his accent was delicious ;)"}
{"text":"I love this place. My fave is the Zuppa al Funghi - its amazing! Pizza is yummmmy. The owner interacts with every customer whether delivering the pizza personally or checking in on you or bringing you the creamy limoncello at the end. Nice outdoor seating out front. It's nice to sit at the bar and watch the guys make your pizza too!! Definite date night kinda place."}
{"text":"Great draft beer options and cold glasses!  I consider myself a Neopolitan Pizza aficionado and this place blew me away. I had the Principe and couldn't stop eating. Can't wait to come back and try the others. The staff was beyond nice. Try to grab a seat at the pizza bar to watch perfection while you eat and drink.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!"}
{"text":"Even when this place isn't quite on their 'A' game, it's still tremendous.  Hats off to Pomo and all the other great pizza places showing up in the Valley."}
{"text":"The Phoenix Zagat gives this place a 26.  Wow, Zagat inflation!   For a New Yorker like me, a rating like that is reserved for places like Blue Hill or Babbo.  This a New York Zagat 20.  This is an LA (my new home) Zagat 22.    The food is good but not amazing.  The bruschetta was tasty but bland; my wife and I had to dump salt all over it to bring it to life.  The burrata salad was also good.  It too lacked a bit of salt but was tasty.  The burrata was nice and fresh.  The pizza is the real winner on the food front.  We had the Pomo (sausage, peppers, mushrooms) and it was amazing, not to mention fast -- the pizza was ready in 90 seconds.  The sauce had just the right amount of acidity and the dough was perfect--decliciously crispy with just the right amount of salt.    The service also deserves a special mention.  The bartender (a short fellow with a pony tail) was awesome.   He was attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable about the menu.  The waitresses -- meh, the opposite -- they were just ok.  Also, the owner/manager offered us Limoncello (albeit in an EVERCLEAR bottle) which we passed on.  My days of drinking grain alcohol (or whatever it was) are long gone.  Nice touch nonetheless.  Three issues:  I encountered not one but two hairs during my meal.  One long one on my glass of ice water, and a short one in my salad.  Nasty but it happens and I didn't make anything of it.  The third:  the bathroom was in shambles.  No soap, no towels.  I expect better from any restaurant, let alone one a Zagat 26 (hah).  Probably a result of it being Super Bowl eve.  I told one of the waitresses about the issue and when I returned later the soap issue was fixed, the towels, not so much.  Training issue.  All in all, not a bad spot if you're in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Pomo continues to be one of our favorite restaurants.  Great food and service.  For a superb experience, sit at the bar and ask for David!  Thank you Pomo for another tremendous night!"}
{"text":"A neat joint close to PHX relatively quite downtown. Located next to a bar, this is a small place with seating both indoor and outdoor. Menu selection was simple and we chose veg. lasagna and buffalo brasca along with Classico Chianti wine. The pizza was served hot with fresh cheese and lasagna was flavorful. We were amazed at the freshness and authenticity of food. To finish it off, the owner (presumably) offered us grain alcohol to go with crispy powered sugared wafers. These were complementary. Overall, amazing service and quality of food."}
{"text":"We came here late after a volleyball tournament with our kids and were absolutely blown away.  This is authentic Italian pizza.  Everyone in my family loved the food. My wife and I have both been to Italy and this is as good as anything you would find in the best pizza locations in Sicily... Great, friendly service too!!"}
{"text":"This is the significant other's fav pizza spot.  We've gone twice in the last three weeks.  The pizza crust is thin, slight charred and tasty.  The ingredients are always fresh.  I had the pollo salad and it was surprisingly delicious for something so healthy.  We sat at the bar once, and the bartender(female) was very knowledgeable about wines.  If I opened a bar, I'd steal her away.  ;)  When we sat at the table, the waiter was very attentive. The owner always gives us complimentary and to die for creamy limoncello.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Phoenix! The owner and chef is actually Italian, so he really knows what he is doing. Their tomato sauce for the pizza is fresh and tasty, their secret: san marzano tomatoes. Blown away every time I go. The desserts are quite good too, try the semi-fredo, wow!! The owner will also serve limoncello at the end of your meal. A must try in Phoenix."}
{"text":"best pizza ever!  I've tried pizza in many states and this 90 second pizza is AMAZING!   Best I've ever had.  you must try for yourself."}
{"text":"One more visit for Pomo. This time super busy and i am not surprise pizza is outstanding and service even when packed is prompt and  fast. we tried new summer menu with bruschetta Trio delicious (smoked salmon, pate' olives, mushrooms) then we go through swordfish carpaccio outstanding flavor and end it with pizza porcini so good. Their porcini are from italy (if you like mushroowms pizza with porcini is must). Complimentary strip dough and cinnamon cream (pure heaven)."}
{"text":"Sooo good! I am really picky with pizza. I have gone to all of the suggested spots. This pizza is my favorite. The crust is thin and crispy on the outside, the sauce is flavorful! We went for lunch with toddlers so we had to get the pizza to go when the stuff started hitting the fan but it was still great when we got it home. The only thing that I didn't like was the appetizer of grilled veggies. It was completely tasteless and not grilled enough and gross but who cares when the pizza is that amazing. It really is like pizza in Italy. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Excellent.  Great service -- attentive, but not overly so.  Every morsel of food was wonderful.  Also, really like the neighborhood vibe -- it felt warm and friendly.  Go!"}
{"text":"This was my first time in this restaurant and I have to say that I was amazed at both the service and food. I would recommend this to anyone in Phoenix heading downtown.  We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"One of two authentic pizza places in downtown Phoenix, which also serves salad and panini sandwiches.  In addition to the dining room there is a dedicated outdoor seating area right off the sidewalk, which are both clean and well arranged.  This being my first visit i wanted to try something different, so I ordered a Capri Panini.  The panini was large and was similar to a folded pizza. The \"bread\" is made from the same dough as the pizza, and cooked in the same ovens so it is fresh and crisp.  The roasted vegetables and mozzarella were ample and flavorful.  Although this sandwich was very good, it did have one issue...The protein.   The sausage could not hold it's own with the other flavors in the sandwich.  At one point I even questioned whether they had forgotten to put it in at all and opened half of the sandwich to find only a few small \"coins\" of sausage.  In my estimate, there was less than a half of sausage in the entire sandwich.  I understand that the secret of preparing food is to balance flavors, however, if the diner is left searching for the \"star of the show\" then in the end it is a failure.  My guest had the Contadina pizza which looked great and he was very happy with it.   I will return to try the pizza."}
{"text":"We had a very friendly Italian waiter from Roma and the food was great. The Bruchetta had wonderful fresh baby tomatoes."}
{"text":"Good pizza is judged first by the crust, then by the sauce, cheese and toppings.  Five stars on all."}
{"text":"Fast and I mean fast service. Sat down at the bar and ordered a pizza. Less than 5 minutes I was heading out the door with my piping hot pie. Decent flavor, good crust. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I've been to Italy and Eataly in Chicago and Pomo is up there with them for the best pizza I've ever had. It is almost identical to Authentic Italian pizza. The atmosphere and food may not be great for younger kids. The service is good however can be slow. Also, a great dessert menu! You must get the Bufala Verace pizza. It is by far the best kind."}
{"text":"DREADFUL SERVICE! we went here since there were 454 reviews on yelp with avg of 4.5 stars. although the food was excellent (mediterranean bruschetta; gamberi rucola pizza), alyssa, our waitress, was missing in action the entire evening: we waited quite a while for her to show up at all; my cocktail came after our bruschetta; the pizza came but we had no silverware and had to ask a busboy to help us out; after we finished our pizza, wanting to order coffee and dessert, alyssa once again had to be summoned by someone else's waiter whom we recruited for the mission. we gave up and just left. it ruins dinner when you have to ride herd on your wait-staff! (in fairness to Pomo, it seems to be an Alyssa problem since the waiters on either side of us were quite attentive to their tables.)"}
{"text":"Went for lunch with the family.   Excellent meal!  Service was fast, friendly.  Their dough is probably the tastiest I've had in phoenix.  I enjoyed their pizzas better than both bianco and Cibo.  I look forward to returning soon!"}
{"text":"This place was AWESOME!  We came on a Friday during primetime, but we were able to snag two seats at the bar.  The bartender was incredibly helpful, friendly, and really passionate about working at this restaurant!  The pizza was absolutely amazing, and I seriously wish that I lived in Phoenix so I could eat it every day.  Not only was the bartender great, but (as mentioned in other reviews) the chef provided us with TWO rounds of complimentary fried dough and limoncella. I've run out of superlatives but this place is legit.  If you live or are visiting Phoenix, I would strongly recommend you go out of your way to eat at Pomo Pizzeria!"}
{"text":"Stumbled onto Pomo Pizzeria by accident late on a Saturday night and was more than pleasantly surprised.  I was very impressed with their food and attentive wait staff. After having lived in Chicago for 15 years, I'm hesitant to compare pizza/pasta against restaurants back \"home\", but Pomo was excellent and I'd highly recommend it.  Prices were fair and we really enjoyed the food and the atmosphere. I will continue to go back."}
{"text":"Pizza is delicious here!  Great decor, wonderful service.  Closest to authentic Italian you can get in Phoenix!  Always a treat to come here.  The Margherita pizza is my absolute fav!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for a girls lunch with my mom and sister, and it was great! Very cool atmosphere and friendly staff. We split two of the salads, both very fresh with unique ingredients. We also shared their margharita pizza...Great! we left nothing but crumbs."}
{"text":"Probably the best pizza that I have ever had. I keep it simple, a bit of cheese, sauce, and some olives.  This place is legit!  Cool atmosphere, great owner.   Remember, good food takes a minute so do not expect to get your meal fast. It takes time to make it fresh and cook it the way you are supposed to.  It is pricey but worth it. Come one man, this aint Pizza Hut!!!  Go try this place and you will thank me!"}
{"text":"Damn son. As a Chicago resident, I thought I had eaten all the great pizza I would consume. I was visiting Phoenix and this place was just down the street, so we figured, when in Rome ...   We ordered a pizza, flatbread and salad, all of which were amazing. The crust of the bread and pizza were delightfully charred, but still chewy on the inside. All the ingredients were top-notch and the salad was perfectly dressed.   The complimentary fried dough and creamy limoncello were just the cherry on top of an awesome night of dining al fresco."}
{"text":"Really good pizza, awesome atmosphere and an open kitchen. Def authentic as far as crust, toppings and style, bit a little pricey. Will be back nonetheless."}
{"text":"I eat here at least once a week. I am lucky to work nearby. But, this place is so good that I often take guests there or find myself eating there on weekends. You will not be disappointed. The service can be a bit slow sometimes and they seem to have a lot of turnover among waitstaff, but the food is outstanding. The coffee too!"}
{"text":"Wow! This might be the best Neopolitan pizza I have outside of Italy. We tried 4 different pizzas and all were outstanding. All ingredients were authentic and extremely fresh. Crust was absolutely perfect. The decor and service was also excellent. I will definitely return the next time I am in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. From the authentic Italian food to the home made lemoncello, it's my favorite place in Phoenix. Just do it. No joke, just do it"}
{"text":"Four person rundown:  Grilled Veggies - lightly grilled veggies served with a side of seasoned olive oil. Very light and very well done  Caprese - fresh and light. Worth a try  Mango Salad - Citrus meets tart. Topped with creamy balsamic vinegar.   Shrimp Salad - A good bit of shrimp and a very nice dressing  Toto Sapore (meat pizza) - delectably crisp with just the right amount of toppings  Wonderful service and just an all around good experience. Will repeat."}
{"text":"Great place- kind of a cool vibe and great food.  If there were half stars, I would give this a 4.5, but definitely leaning toward 5 rather than just 4.  Ordered the Bufala Verace and the Principe pizzas, which were both phenomenally tasty.  Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza. The evening we where there, the owner gave every table a free sweet treat and shots to end the meal. Nice touch!"}
{"text":"Prego!  If you want pizza, get it here! The Verace pizza arrived hot, a little too burnt-to-a-crisp, but still palatable. We also ordered the pollo salad (pronounced \"polo\" not my embarrassingly \"po-yo\") to make sure we had our daily dose of veggies. We decided to forego on dessert, but our server brought out a complimentary plate of fried dough strips with powdered sugar.   Parking was easy, we were surprised by the no-wait on a Saturday night.  A good casual dinner pick!  ."}
{"text":"All you need to know - very good pizza.  And they care about it; you can tell good food is personally important to management and employees.  It was interesting to learn they are part of an international society that supports and evaluates pizzerias around the world.    Servie is always excellent.  Good wine selection, and they give you a chance to taste before you buy.  Can't imagine why anyone would wait in line to go to Bianco when you can walk in to Pomo and experience wine and food that is as good or better."}
{"text":"Great place! Came here with a group of coworkers, David was our server and he was very helpful. It was our first time going and he was very knowledgeable, we told him what we felt like and he gave us great unbiased opinions. We ordered 6 different pizzas, only finished 5. They were all delicious. We also ordered a bread basket, meat plate appetizer  and 2 desserts to share between us. The food was phenomenal, service was the best I've had and I definitely will return. The general manager came by towards the end of our visit and offered us a round of HOMEMADE limon cello (on the house) and it was delicious. If you love Italian food and great service, this is the place to be. I couldn't be more pleased with my experience."}
{"text":"Love this place! Having traveled to Italy and having such a wonderful experience there, I love coming to this place for a nostalgic experience with my husband. It truly is simple foods, done very well. The atmosphere is very laid-back, but also feels special at the same time."}
{"text":"Who knew Phoenix was turning into the place to get good pizza?? There are so many great spots downtown including the notorious pizzaria bianco but Pomo is also pretty good if you don't want to wait hours for your pizza.  The pizzas are thin and get soft from the sauce so they are a little hard to eat. You've got to master the pizza fold.  We had the burrata as an appetizer and it was delicious.  I have no idea where people park, though. It's tucked away on a side street. We walked from cityscape."}
{"text":"Yummmmmmmm! Buffala pizza = bomb.com. The owner brings you this flaky desert and a shot of limoncello. Oh yeah, doesn't get any better."}
{"text":"Back in the day I went to the location on Scottsdale a couple of times and I loved it so I paid a visit to the DT Phoenix location and I believe it's even better.  Great decoration, wonderful staff, knowledgeable and kind waitresses (Kiera was super kind) and really good food.  The caprese salad was superb, hands down.  I also had the Pomo pizza which was very good.  The chef (I believe he's the owner) is super kind and he stopped by our table to greet and invite my friend and I a shot of a liquor that was pretty tasty and also shared some kind of desert which was also pretty good.  A funny fact is that all the floor staff were women (beautiful and super kind women).  BTW the bar looks pretty cool as well, could be a good place for a happy hour for two.  I'll be back soon.  Cheers"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 5 stars as I have given Bianco and Cibo.   Excellent pizza that nestles itself nicely between the crusts of Bianco and Cibo.  Bianco = paper thin, irregular shaped pies with crunchy (no doughy) crust that's a little burned in a spot with or two with big bubbles and fantastically fresh ingredients  Cibo = crust about as thick as two nickles with the outside wonderfully flavored and small \"bubbles\" and chewy and fantastically fresh ingredients  Pomo = nickle thick bottom with outside crust right smack in the middle between the above two. Medium bubbles here. Again.. fantastically fresh ingredients. Their slices of pepperoni are thicker but smaller around than the other two  Really just depends on your mood that day. Reasonably priced like the rest and awesome pie."}
{"text":"Went for a business dinner and was a bit loud. Awesome owner who was present. He is from Italy and at the end of your meal provides lemon chello, the real kind and fried dough. Good was great but not great for business meals."}
{"text":"Great food, kickback atmosphere, and very down to earth employees.  Pizza comes in one size accompanied with fresh ingredients and a shot of lemon cello with fried flour covered with powdered sugar and honey after every meal.   If you haven't been, it is a must!"}
{"text":"Pomo is awesome. Much better value than pizzeria bianco with a larger menu and bar options. I like the atmosphere better here than bianco as well. Our server was attentive and recommended us a fantastic bottle of wine paired with two pizzas we got - and this was at a birthday dinner with 20+ guests at one table. Great experience, I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I just went to a few cities in Italy Aug 2013, and fell in love with the pizza in Naples and Rome. Naples, known as the city where pizza originated from, has am-azing pizza. The sauce is simple, the dough is fresh, soft, and really delicious.   Although Pomo has more ingredients on the pizza, such as arugula or sausage if you want, the dough is perfect. It really brought me back to the pizza I had in Naples. There seems to be a lot of pizza places in Phoenix and Scottsdale, and even a Grimaldi's opened in Scottsdale.   We had just had Pizza Bianco the day before, and Pomo is wayyyyyyy better. It's probably the best pizza place I've had in the states so far that serves napoletana pizza.   This was my most memorable meal next to Nobuo's in Phoenix. And for that, THANK YOU, Arizona!!"}
{"text":"No ambience at this place at all. Weather was chilly tonight so my boyfriend and I opted to sit inside..There were a few larger tables for groups and then a long wall booth with smaller tables and chairs in front of it. It was like being in a cafeteria ..we were wedged in between two other couples. UGH. wanted a quiet relaxing dinner and that didn't happen. The waiter was rude and fake. He kept hitting on two girl customers..kind of creepy. Also a worker hit me with the door..when he apologized he REEKED of alcohol. The food was the same as the service. Awful. My pizza came out and it was so soggy the toppings all slid right off. It was a disgusting mushy mess. The chicken on my salad was dry and tasted of very poor quality. I feel like I must have went on an off or bad night because I am not picky and there are so many good reviews for this place......I however, couldn't wait to leave so I surely will never go back. Bummer."}
{"text":"Ate here last weekend with my boyfriend and another couple, and we were all very impressed with the quality of food. My boyfriend and I split the margherita pizza and a shrimp and arugula pizza, while our friends split a salad and a pizza with a lot of meat toppings.   The pizza at Pomo is made in the Neapolitan tradition (one of only two pizzerias in Arizona that are certified to do so), so it's crispy on the crust, and soft on the inside. This was especially true of the margherita, which had dough so soft in the middle that paired nicely with the creaminess of the mozarella.   The shrimp and arugula pizza might have been my favorite, however. The dough wasn't quite as soft as the margherita, and the shrimp's flavor was brought out by the arugula.   I had a glass of pinot grigio, which was a little sweeter than my liking, and the rest of the table had beer that was on special -- $2 for watermelon beer! I definitely would recommend ordering some if they still have it, as it was a nice summery treat.   Before we left, one of the owners came by with a shot of this creamy, cinnamon-flavored Everclear, and a plate of fried dough topped with powdered sugar and Nutella. Although this seems to be his schtick with all the diners, it was a sweet and appreciated gesture, not to mention tasty! We had to hang out at the restaurant after drinking the shots because they were a little on the strong side, but so delicious.  The only reason I've docked a star was due to our service. Our server was too attentive -- every couple of minutes she was over to ask how food was/to see if we needed anything, and then when we would tell her we were fine, she would just stand there. Staring at us. For like a minute. So totally bizarre."}
{"text":"This place is just about perfect. The staff is friendly and attentive.  The pizza my wife and I had was thin and crispy. We were kinda hungry so we ordered another and it was the same. The complimentary limoncello and fried dough with powdered sugar was really nice of the owner. We will be eating here again on our next trip to Phoenix."}
{"text":"I loved this place. The chief made top quality ingredients  into perfection. The pizza is made within minutes from the moment you order it. Pepper oil that is served with every dish adds a touch to already culinary masterpiece."}
{"text":"Have seen this place for a few weeks but decided to finally try it out for girls night. Went with my two girlfriends! Ordered a bottle of wine and three desserts. The cannolis, tiramisu and crem br√ªl√©e. Mmm. Perfect desserts. My roommate swears by the tiramisu.   The atmosphere was fantastic. The waitress was so great! She actually convinced us to come back just to try their sandwiches. They let us stay past closing as we finished our bottle of wine and were very accommodating!"}
{"text":"I loved the thin crust . The menu for pizza is very extensive and very Italian. The pizza sauce was spicy and fantastic as well. Had a couple cocktails and they were well made and service was great."}
{"text":"Great pizza, but there are no pastas or gluten free options at this location. The scottsdale location has a bigger menu and I was hoping for pasta. I would give them 5 stars if I was just after pizza but due to the lack of pastas I have to deduct a star."}
{"text":"Th great pizzeria on any street corner. The  crust was cooked to perfection. I had the Contondina: onions the food was exceptional it brought back memories of my past life when i could find a good pizza on the east coast.  The complimentary lemonchello was to die for."}
{"text":"Yum-my everything from start to finish. Staff helpfull & attentive. Can't wait to go back & get some more pizza, caonnli & limoncello."}
{"text":"The best pizza in the valley. I love the fast service, friendly atmosphere and most importantly the food.  Whenever the family gets together for dinner this is our go to place.  I admit, one tiny drawback, is to make sure you have money for parking.  That aside you won't be disappointed in your experience here.  Especially since your meal concludes with free limoncello and free powered sugar fried dust bread.  DELICIOUS!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and service in Downtown Phoenix. I decided to play it safe and ordered the Margarita pizza and it is one of the best that I've had to date. I did ask for extra basil after so I'll be sure to do that next time. Perfectly sized meal, great atmosphere, I will be back."}
{"text":"Holy Cannoli-this place deserves 10 stars!! A friend of mine and I were out and about for the ski pro Avalanche sale at the convention center. After waiting in line for approximately 6 days we checked out and were ravenous! We decided to go here based on a recommendation from someone in line ahead of us. This place does not disappoint. We ordered the chicken salad but subbed the homemade dressing for the lemon vinaigrette. It was a good helping of spring mix, pine nuts, tomatoes and AVOCADO!!! Bomb.com, people!!!   Next we ordered the pizza with all the meat (can't recall the name of it..toto something or other)! The crust was the perfect blend of crispy and chewy. It was perfection!!   As a complete surprise, after our meal a nice gentleman came up and offered us a shot of their homemade limoncello! You MUST try it. One word: delicious.     I highly recommend this place!!  Price: salad, pizza and one diet coke came out to around $30 pre-tax/tip. And ya know what??? Worth every penny!!"}
{"text":"We have been coming down to Phoenix from Alaska for many years and have been searching for \"that pizza place\". We have finally found it.  Everything on the menu was fantastic. To top it off we had excellent service from David (we sat and ate at the bar). The owner shared a little something from the old country at the end of the meal. This is THE ONLY  pizza place we will go to from now on when we visit Phoenix."}
{"text":"New to the state, last week I decided to try some of the popular restaurants in the downtown area. I had one of the worst experiences, let me share a bit of my night .  There were some art shows and presentations down Roosevelt Street, I believe it is called \"First Friday\". Walked past a cute little building and saw it was Pomo and remembered that was on my list for places to try out. We get there and it is relatively busy as I would expect on a Friday night, the hostess was nice and very kindly cleaned a table for us to sit in. It took about 10 minutes plus for someone to bring us water. Then she finally came back and seemed extremely stressed (not to mention this was the first time I have ever seen a waitress wear a mini jean skirt and an apron) I was very shocked they allowed her to wear that as everyone else was wearing black jeans or work pants. We had been sitting there for over 20 minutes and were very ready for some food. I ordered a glass of wine and a pizza Margherita. The pizza came out within 5 min yet my glass still never arrived. A tall man who seemed to be the manager walked by us looked at the table, didn't greet us nor notice we had no extra plates or silverware on the table. I had to wave down the hostess and she kindly brought us the silverware and some oils and pepper flakes.  I was nearly done with my meal when the waitress finally returned to checked back up on us. I told her my wine never arriving and she just gave me a strange look, I believe she just never put it in. After reminding her about my glass she still didn't offer to get me the drink. I was very annoyed but trying to keep my calm, it was noticeable english wasn't her first language but I don't think I was too difficult to understand my order.  After that she started coming to check on us a bit more often since she noticed I wasn't in a very good mood. A big table beside us had just left and I noticed she did not help pick up a single cup both times she went out there. The hostess cleared the whole table, seemed like that young girl and the kitchen were the only ones working.  This isn't even the worst part yet. I went into the ladies room and there is a horrible oder, seem like someone couldn't hold it and pooped on the ground. The worst part is that it looked like someone tried to just clean it with paper towels instead of giving it a proper clean. I could not finish my business, I quickly left and told my husband to pay in cash so we could just get out of this place as quickly as possible. I hate not leaving a proper tip but I do not believe she even earned any of what we did leave her.   I was extremely disappointed with my experience, the food was very good, saddly I can't actually leave a rating based on just that."}
{"text":"The pizza was excellent as well as the staff. David, one of the waiters was awesome so friendly and willing to get us anything that we needed."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. From the service to the food. Everything tastes so fresh. We ordered the POMO pizza and also the waitress recommended the mushroom soup. Paula was such a fun helpful happy spirited woman who helped us on our first time experience. Thanks POMO. I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"Taste like Italy! I really loved this little low key pizza join. My hubby and I stopped in tonight for a quick bite. They don't take reservations but we were able to be seated right away. Peroni on tap was a plus. :) We started with the caprese and split the peppino pizza. I highly recommend the peppino!! A little sausage ricotta perfection! :) Most of the other guest ordered one pizza per person but one was enough for us. My hubby could have ordered more so if your hungry you might want you own pie. After dinner the offered some complimentary limoncello. It tasted like sweet lemon candy! Sooo good! Try this place out! It's great!"}
{"text":"This is the \"cheese pizza\". I thought commodity prices where heading down? Apparently not, these folks are rationing the mozzarella! Maybe next time I will the order the extra extra extra extra cheese. Make it look and taste like a pizza guy, not a big bread stick with tomato sauce."}
{"text":"Honestly the best pizza I have ever had!!!!   My boyfriend said its the best pizza he's had since being in the US since 2013!!!  Everything is fresh. Fire wood stone oven!!!  Perfect crust!!   We also had tiramisu!  It is also home made. So amazing and moist.  The best I've ever had for sure.   The owner came out with a complementary desert while we waited for our tiramisu and also poured all 3 of us a shot of liminchello!!!   It was amazing!!   We needed to be rolled out of there. But omg!!!  It was soooo worth it!!!"}
{"text":"The most amazing pizza in Phoenix. Owner and the entire staff are a delight to chat with. When I want the best, a quick trip from Mesa is worth it every time."}
{"text":"Hands down, best pizza in Phoenix.  We've tried several of the eateries around town, becoming regulars at Federal and Parlor. But it's not even in the same league.  It's been a long time since I had a high quality piece of Italian pie. Throw in the fact that cannolis are on the dessert menu and my craving for pizza Saturday night was sky high. Not far from our house, we figured we better try it now before we move.  We arrive on a decent weather night around 6:30. The place is packed. 45 minute wait for a table, or sit now at the bar. We opt for the bar as it's just the two of us and we are hungry.  Start with caprese (so delicious and the mozz is amazing). Yum. Two pizzas. Husband demolishes his. I finish half because, ahem, I want cannoli. Both amazing. Well, mine was great (Margherita), I never got a chance to try husbands.  OMG, the cannoli. I haven't had cannoli since Sicily in 2009. I was SO FREAKING HAPPY. I want them now. I want them all the time. Knowing that I can get cannoli like that here in Phoenix is dangerous knowledge.  We've got about 3 weeks before we leave Phoenix. We'll be back."}
{"text":"First time here. NOT impressed. First I will say the ingredients seemed good and the food tasted amazing for what we ordered. But here's what we had to endure to get it. We made reservation online because we happen to see the option. Got there...no reservations. They weren't busy so no big deal. We sit down among other families and within a few minutes the music changes to hard core hand banger hard rock. Then another song...same thing. We look at the surrounding of old Hollywood photos and say to each other...are we missing something? We tell the waitress...who then sends a manger (I'm assuming because he didn't identify himself). Both not opting to change the obviously obnoxious music but ask us if we like it? Really???? He wasn't getting it and we had to give him the analogy of \"outside of a tattoo shop, where is this music ever appropriate???  Of course he doesn't answer that and hardly looks at me anymore trying to convince us this is appropriate...but he wants to make us happy (at this point coming across patronizing). It gets changed with the statement they are catering to a young downtown crowd. Food comes. Tastes great but pizza is the soggiest thin crust pizza I've ever had. Was surrounded by fruit flies while we ate (no bug light anywhere of course). If you've seen any of the bar rescue shows you know if there are fruit flies flying around customers...they are also flying around and most likely floating at the bottom of the alcohol bottles. We don't know for sure and I certainly wasn't about to ask the long haired bartender to check. To add to our amazing experience we are sitting along a full length padded bench...of which our section is the only one not all torn up. Chairs are all nicked and worn. To a young downtown crowd these may not be a concern...clearly. But to the rest of us we expect a bit more."}
{"text":"Great vibe in this place. Very friendly staff. Outside area had plenty of heaters so it was comfortable even on a chillier night. As for the food, it definitely brought me back to a little piece of Italy. We have the Bufalo pizza and caprese salad. Both great. 3 people had two pizzas, caprese and three drinks got out for $60. Plenty of food. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Awesome service and one of the best pizzas I have ever tried! Place also has a really good vibe to it, I got pizza to go this time but I really look forward to coming here with some friends for a pizza and a couple beers. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great tasting pizza, awesome dessert made with Nutella, just wish they had Moscato. People that work there are very attentive and do a great job serving."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the 1st time and loved it!  The neapolitan pizza is excellent and service is great.  We sat on the beautiful patio outside as the weather was nice, really enjoyable.  Some really good Italian wines and decent craft beer selection.  Oh, and loved the free homemade limoncello as a tasty after dinner treat, to die for!  Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizzeria in phoenix they cook brick oven pizza taste just like nyc Grimaldi's!  I love the atmosphere outdoor and indoor dining along with a quiet bar area. They serve the food fast. I would recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"If you are looking for the best and most authentic pizza in phoenix, look no further. I have been here three times and every time they seem to raise the bar. The Pizza is amazing, authentic ingredients, and authentic tastes. The atmosphere is also good as it is easy to be comfortable and relaxed here especially with guests. The decor is Italian, the waiters speak Italian, and the alcohol is Italian. Try the tiramisu it will blow your mind."}
{"text":"We came to Phoenix last week for a wedding so we had a party of maybe 20 people. Service was spot on and attentive, and the pizzas were just amazing. I haven't tasted pizza like that in a long time. The sweet marinara and salty mozzarella was just simply perfect. I would come here all the time if I lived here."}
{"text":"Awesome, fresh neapolitan Pizzas. I also really enjoyed the antipasti grilled vegetables with an incredible olive oil based dipping sauce. Good selection of pizzas.  The servers were very friendly and attentive. The owner came out at the end and offered us homemade Limoncello shots.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I love this place. There, I said it. Right at the very start of my review! I love Pomo Pizzeria for its DELICIOUS food. I love it for its location right there on 1st St in downtown Phoenix (although other locations are available for those of you in Glendale, Scottsdale, or Gilbert!). And I love it for its consistently outstanding service.  I've been to Pomo Pizzeria many times, but will never forget my first visit ever. It was as if the owner could sniff out a newbie! Honestly, the quality personal engagement of the total team there was (and has continued to be) truly outstanding.  I was introduced to Pomo by one of my very closest friends, who \"dragged\" me along because she was THAT excited to have me experience the high level of service and delicious food she had come to expect from this location. I was not disappointed. The owner even treated us to a special little dessert drink of his own making after our meal completely free of charge!  I will admit that I am a bit of a pizza snob. Having grown up in New Jersey, I have that special brand of condescension found only in east coasters whereby we refer to New York pizza as the \"only real pizza\" to be found on this earth.  Pomo hasn't COMPLETELY cured me from this admittedly arrogant folly; however, I will say that I have tasted pizza at every pizzeria I can find in the Valley and Pomo Pizzeria continues to remain the easy #1 Top Choice for Best Pizza in or around Phoenix.  Pomo - you should know that I'm still searching for that one little out-of-the-way pizza shop to topple your reign, so you'd better keep up the amazing work!  If you haven't yet experienced the Pomo difference, you need to. Go do that sooner rather than later. You won't be disappointed! And Pomo - thank you, thank you, thank you for being so wonderful and delicious. I love you, and I'll see you again soon!  ;)"}
{"text":"Why do I like pomo? Great food, simple yet sophisticated, great service and great ingredients. Always consistent."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely amazing but the service was a little poor. Had to ask the server 3 times for a drink. If the service was better I would have given it 5 stars"}
{"text":"Here it is - a 5 star review begging for a 6th. This place earned it. I don't expect to find another place this good for a long time. They set the bar too high.  After other plans fell apart, my girlfriend and I wandered in and were greeted with very nice service, which continued for the whole evening.  We started with drinks and crostini/I-don't-remember-what-they-called-it. The beer selection was strong but not too extensive. I prefer having an absurd number of choices, but this place isn't a beer garden and I found something I liked. If the entire meal had been as good as the crostini I might have given this review \"only\" 4 stars.  The pizza was outstanding. We got a white pizza, and it was easily one of the best pizzas either of us had ever been lucky enough to taste. It was probably the best I've ever had. I was blown away.  It was almost closing time when we finished. First, our waitress brought us a free plate of sugar-dusted fried desert \"chips\" (see the photo), and then the head chef came around with complimentary shots of limoncello. It was a fantastic end to the meal.  Do yourself (and maybe your significant other) a favor and check out this amazing restaurant."}
{"text":"This review will be very simple for all you skeptics or having one of those yelp days looking for best places to eat:  Hands down...best...margherita pizza...I...have had...in...my life!  The periods were meant to be slow and long pauses building up to the excitement.  I have been to Italy, and this pizza is authentic as it gets.  Lastly, I love desserts.  Therefore, Hands down...best...cannoli...I...  Actually, this is supposed to be short.  As a result, their cannoli's are friggin' delicious.  Please go to this place.  Great atmosphere.  Owners are great.  Food is good.  We will see you again Pomo!"}
{"text":"we had a large party so we all got to sample each other's pizza .giving this one three stars the pizza was good and service was fast....however nothing stood out to me....most likely not going back not sure what all the word is with this place being so good..."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! unlike any pizza you have ever had before!  Great service and great food, what more can you ask for?! :)"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp after finishing up at First Friday.  Walked over and was greeted by a 40 minute wait, which is to be expected on a Friday night.    However, seeing the other 2 places right next to it completely empty intrigued me.  Our pizza, the Toto Sapore, took a while to get...but...one bite...that's all it took.  All was forgiven.  All was right with the world.  Salami on pizza really is proof that God loves us.  Shockingly good pizza.  Our bruschetta (the one with avocado) was also fantastic as was the quite unique limoncello.  All in all, I HIGHLY recommend this place.  Can't wait to go back and try another pizza (and some grappa)!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and service ... 4 formaggi pizza was crisp and delicious ... Perfect martini (served in a traditional and normal-sized martini glass, not one of those silly, undersized things that you see all over that look like a dainty, squashed wine goblet).  And the gratis pastry and Limoncello to top things off were a nice touch.  Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Haven't had a slice of Pomo's pie and am going through withdrawals. This place keeps it simple with countertop service serving up awesome pizzas, pastas, and sandwiches. Their signature pizza, the Pomo, stands up to the best pies in the valley of not smashing them. The master chef's dough and fresh ingredients does it for me."}
{"text":"Talk about AMAZING, this place knocked my socks off!   The Phoenix location is not a very big restaurant but it has HUGE character. I sat outside because it was a lovely evening and a little quieter too. The service was excellent, our glasses did not go dry and our plates promptly cleared when finished. The waitress was on the ball and did not leave us for to long but let us alone enough to enjoy our evening.    I started the meal with the Romana Insalate which was romaine lettuce with Pomo's home dressing and shaved parmigiano cheese. The salad was fresh, the dressing superb and the shaved cheese topped it off nicely. The portion is large enough to share with another.   For the main dish I had the Bufala Verace which was a step up from the normal margherita style pizza. It had the freshest sauce and imported bufala mozzarella that was so creamy it just melted in my mouth. Topped with fresh basil too, seriously this pizza was something to write home about. WoW does not even come close to the awesomeness that danced on my tongue!  Dessert was molto perfetto!! The tiramisu is worth getting, the portion is gigantic and is definitely a share with your friends dessert. It was light and sweet and the berries on the side added to the perfect mix with the coffee and chocolate flavors.  The owner is such a sweet man, at the end of our meal he offered some of his homemade limoncello. It was a sweet, creamy lemon mixture with a hint of vanilla (i think.) He should really put this amazing stuff over vanilla bean ice-cream and berries, it would make a great dessert.     This evenings meal could not have been any better. I wholeheartedly recommend trying this place, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Awesome service, I sat at the bar and had bruschetta and their tomato cream soup with a glass of wine. The tomato cream soup was DELICIOUS and so filling! I was completely satisfied with the food and then the service was phenomenal, the bartender was busy but was absolutely attentive to my friend and I and everyone else there the entire time. He was awesome and the food was awesome, I'll definitely be heading back soon."}
{"text":"Really great woodfired pizza. Service is super fast and I love my crust crispy and chewing on the ends. I would rate this pizza up against most I've had in Italy or New York. Surprising flavor for the Southwest."}
{"text":"This is the place to go for delicious Neapolitan pizzas. Not Bianco, where you'll wait an hour+ and get hammered at Bar Bianco on Lambrusco to the point where you don't even remember what your fig and prosciutto pie tasted like. Pomo has great ambience, super friendly servers and the owner even brings out some limoncello for you and asks you how your meal is. Their pizza is just as good as Bianco without the wait. Very recommended."}
{"text":"I'm second generation Italian and have traveled to Italy many times and I have to say THIS IS PIZZA. Crust is perfect, sauce is perfect, and cheese is perfect. This is pizza at it's purest and it's delicious. Your taste buds will be in heaven"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch the other day based on all the great reviews. The lunch crowd was in full swing but I'm not sure what all the hype was about. I had one of the paninis, which are truly HUGE, but it wasn't anything special.  It was good, hot, well made, etc but didn't live up to the hype. Maybe my expectations were too high?  I was looking for the \"wow\" factor but it wasn't there"}
{"text":"Really good pizza. Really good drinks. You will read more about these in other reviews.   My issue - the frizzy haired hostess at the entrance who committed the cardinal sin for me upon my arrival. She said \"just one tonight?\"  Yes sweetie, just one, you condescending b***h.   I may give this place another chance, but I swear if I am greeted this way again, I will take my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Best Pizza in AZ! as full blooded Italian growing up on great Italian food, it is sometimes really hard to find good food... We LOVE Pomo ;-)"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and got great, attentive service on a Saturday night. Delicious pizza, amazing nutella torte, good selection of beers. Service was very fast. Little expensive though."}
{"text":"A solid 4 stars. Pizza was good but the burrata was missing something and didn't have much flavor. Dessert was fantastic! Staff was very friendly and did their best to be attentive but I can tell the busier they get the more service suffers. Great atmosphere. Please carry ranch... you're not in Italy."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza and staff. Very friendly, attentive without hovering. My favorite seat is at the kitchen bar where I can watch them turn out one pie after another. Each one is a work of food art, made with fresh ingredients. Their Pomo Pizza is my favorite, but I like them all and have probably had everything on the menu at least once."}
{"text":"Met up with family.  All of us really enjoyed our pizzas.  This is as close to Italy as one can get for pizza in Phoenix.  Homemade limoncello to end the meal was a nice touch."}
{"text":"I can't wait to try it. The Manager has ask me to come over for a meal on the house. Says he doesn't serve deep fried pizza ., I can't wait. I am coming, Steve   Yelp is great . It let us improve our dining experiences with the help of others ideas.  Thanks,Steve"}
{"text":"The dishes were all delicious and the service was great.  I am a fan of eggplant parmigiana smattering be the best.  Minus one star for being out of the first three things I tried to order."}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant!  They have a giant wood burning oven in the back and you can sit and watch them cook.  The owner evens chefs!  He came by to visit with us and then returned at the end of the meal to bring us the delicious pastry and limoncello!  Everyone was so kind and the food was terrific.  We had the pizza and the Caesar salad and it came with anchovies...our favorite.   We were visiting Phoenix and found this restaurant on yelp!    It was a great choice!"}
{"text":"I've been here a dozen or so times throughout the years. In the past year I have developed an allergy to wheat and was excited to see they have gluten free pizza!   Excited to try the GF pizza, came here for dinner.... ordered a bottle of wine then a couple appetizers, along with pizzas- one of which was gluten free. As we finish our appetizers, the server comes over and says they have been on of GF pizza since yesterday. Really? This is something that the restaurant should let their staff know... maybe they could have told us up front then... or, you know, before we order and we're already finished appetizers and well into our bottle of wine. This would be a higher rating had they let us know about this.   Overall, the food and service are good. Except for this (not so minor to someone with a food allergy) detail. And I do love the limoncello that they give everyone at the end... nice touch."}
{"text":"The pizza here is fantastic. The atmosphere is cozy but don't sit outside if you mind the cigarette smoke blowing over from The Turf on a busy night of boozers. Don't get me wrong, I like a good night out of boozing but not when I'm having dinner with my woman. My gf and I shared 2 pizzas, the margarita & another one with shaved parm & sliced prosciutto. Afterward the main pizza guy gave us a plate of some kinda fried dough dessert with powdered sugar. It was nice. Then he came by later and poured us a homemade shot of limoncello in little glasses. Immediately & pretty much automatically I raised this thing, acknowledged my gf & tipped it back to the heavens & slammed the glass down on the bar. After wiping my mouth & looking around the room I realized it was supposed to be enjoyed by something called sipping. It was a nice way to end the meal. Oh & the service was good, I recommend this place."}
{"text":"There are no words to describe the love I have for this pizzeria.   It is as close as you will get to an authentic Italian food.   The atmosphere is absolutely amazing with Italian music playing in background. The smells inside are unexplainable. The smells of fresh oregano when you first walk in are a must experience....All of the staff is real friendly.   Every pizza that I have ordered and all of others entr√©es I tried, I was amazed every time. Everything is so fresh and in house made. Then if you are lucky, the owner will pour you his homemade lemon shot, which is purely amazing...They call it homemade limoncello. The owner is mostly there serving and cooking, which shows you how much love is put in the atmosphere and food of this little local Pizzeria.   They take reservations...I can't wait for my nest visit..."}
{"text":"This was a great experience for me.  My co-worker and I were in the area for training, and got in pretty late.  Luckily, Pomo Pizzeria was close to my co-worker's hotel, so we were able to walk on over at around 8 pm on a Sunday night to get some food.  Service was excellent; all smiles and they were able to seat us pretty quickly.    We quickly ordered two of the pizzas suggested by the server; excellent!  The pizza with the charcuterie had awesomely fresh ingredients, and it was just a unique menu item.  Definitely didn't make me feel fat!  We then had the pizza with different cheeses on the white crust.  VERY tasty.  Once again, fresh ingredients, and it just tasted wholesome.    We also got canolis!  One order comes with 3 mini canolis, all of different flavors.  I think one was pistacchio for sure, and another vanilla (?).  I completely forgot the last flavor.  All 3 flavors weren't too sweet, but it hit my co-worker's canoli craving (say that 3 times fast) straight on.    I think the owner or the manager of the venue also came by and gave us shots of a wonderful vanilla liqueur.  I was expecting it to be bitter like most alcohols, but it was actually very sweet and smooth.  Perfect way to end the night.  Props to the clean restaurant, beautiful decor, excellent service and management, and of course, delicious food.  Will try and come back here whenever I'm back down in Phoenix.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"What a great place for pizza!  The wood fired pizza is done super fast and tastes awesome.  We brought our entire girls basketball team and coaches here after a tournament. They close between 2-5pm on weekdays but stayed open after lunch to cook for us.  We were given the best service and the pizza was incredible.  The calzone was just as good.  There were zero left overs as we demolished everything on the table.  We were very appreciative of Myra, our server, and the cook, Fernando.  You won't be disappointed here!"}
{"text":"This is the only pizza place that can make my mouth water just by thinking about it. Even the seemingly most \"plain\" pizza has the most amazing flavors and texture, especially with some chili olive oil drizzled on top. Love the complimentary Limoncello shots at the end of every meal. Also, the desserts are insane. This place can do no wrong in my book."}
{"text":"Great dining experience. Pizza is great from the wood fired oven. Friendly service and efficient staff. What sent us over the top was the complimentary desert crisps after dinner followed by a lemoncello cream made by the owner that was out of this world. We were already sold on the place before the lemoncello cream made the perfect finish."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't discovered Pomo earlier.. unbelievably fresh, hot and authentic. Perfect thin, crispy, slight burnt (love it) crust with a flavorful sauce and toppings were my favorite part of my \"Pomo\" pizza. Tangy and sweet Balsamic vinaigrette mixed greens with cucumbers and tomatoes- was exactly what I needed on this hot, humid summer day.   Waitress was attentive and had plenty of help, which was great. Great patio area and really close to the Children's museum (where we just came from). Love love love."}
{"text":"From appetizers (bruschetta, egg plant), thru main courses (gnocchi, pizza buffala) and dessert (tiramisu), everything was delicious and service was excellent. Thanks"}
{"text":"This is our first visit to Phoenix and I have to say this was not a very welcoming experience!!  Came across this place on yelp and thought we'd try it since it has almost 5 stars. Wow, was this disappointing! First of all, the hostess said it was a 20 min wait & said she would call my cell when the table was ready. After about 25 mins we noticed several empty tables which sat empty for about another 10 mins-which is when we decided to ask about our table. She replied with an \"airhead\" response, \"I'm sorry, would you like to sit now?\"......uuuuuuhhh, no actually we want to keep waiting idiot!!!  Service was HORRIBLE!! Had the worst waiter, not friendly at all, worst attitude!! Don't waste your time or money here, seriously!!! Food was mediocre, at best."}
{"text":"Nice caprese good pizza.   Great atmosphere.  A short walk from downtown Phoenix.  Open late.  I would come back"}
{"text":"Our first visit was so terrific, we couldn't wait to come back. We love the patio, but it's still a little too hot to sit outside. So, for this trip, we sat inside. Again, service was prompt and friendly. We had water on the table and a drink order taken within minutes of sitting. Our server was helpful with suggestions, and stopped by just the right amount to check on us. When she didn't stop at the table, I still observed her eyeballing our table to see how full our beers were, or how far we were into our Mista salad--which is the best salad on the menu. It's also the only one we've tried so far ... The pizza, Quattro Stagioni, was so good. Thin crust, and just enough sausage and olives to make it a nice-sized main course. We still had room to try some desserts this time. On our previous visit, we had a salad and two pizzas. While all were fantastic, we screwed ourselves out of really great desserts--which is knowledge we gained on this visit. Peter had the Semifreddo, and I had the Tiramisu. The Semifreddo tasted of cherries, though it's made of fig. Peter loved it. My Tiramisu was the best I've ever had--and I've had a few. It was so light and flavorful. Somehow, though I was stuffed half-way through it, I managed to finish the whole thing. I'll pay for that later. Just for balance, I should probably mention some \"opportunities'--as we call them where I work. Really, I mention them only for balance, because we both really love this place, and plan to return often. The toppings on the pizza was very unevenly distributed. Most of the sausage was on one half, and most of the olives on the other. (See, hardly worth mentioning, but ...) Also, ... the Tiramisu could have been cut in half (or maybe two thirds). It was just too big. (First World problems.) I took a pic of the Tiramisu, but my phone ate it before I realized it was gone, and I couldn't share it here. Again, Matteo, the owner, brought over his bottle of creamy Limoncello just as we finished everything. He's such a nice guy, though, I suspect, not so good with the English--which is all the better. He just smiles and nods, and we assure him everything was \"so damn good.\" We thank him too much for how great everything is. Because ... we're just so grateful for this great pizza restaurant, right in the neighborhood. So, two Perronis (beer), a Mista salad, a pizza, and two desserts came to just about $50. Money well spent, if you ask me."}
{"text":"I thought the pizza and salad were fantastic! Great flavors! And the atmosphere was fantastic!! Our waitress was spot on but it seemed like the rest of the staff were right out of the Robert Palmer video without a smile to be had... :|"}
{"text":"The great thing is the food here is amazing. What wasn't so great was the fact that the manager was constantly on his phone the whole time, and he and the wait and bar staff kept sneaking off to the back to drink with I guess local patrons? Anyways, it was weird and sadly the food alone is not enough to bring me back..."}
{"text":"Bottom line - YES, we will be back!  We had the good fortune of stumbling across this place on an exploratory walk (although I was aware of the good reviews...) before closing time for the afternoon (2:00 PM) and we ordered the Marghareta - which is our favorite - and this was decidedly one of the two best we have had the pleasure of enjoying here in Phoenix.  The other is just a few blocks from here and from where we are staying and it is going to be a difficult choice to decide which one to come back to first!   The service was great - friendly, quick and informative - and the location is fabulous.  We had the pleasure of sitting outside on the porch.   I have to admit I have no idea how the Pizza Hut across the street stays in business!   The prices were quite fair for what we received.  The pizza was at tasty as any I have ever had...and I just decided that Pomo will be the next place we go...again!"}
{"text":"This is a great pizza place. Perfect brick oven taste at a good price. The pies run you for about 12 bucks. If you've ever been to Grimaldi's before this place has a similar taste. Best pizza restaurant I've been to in Arizona yet."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, helpful staff, and fantastic drinks make this a Phoenix staple for me. Great spot for lunch, dinner, or a date.  My \"usual\" is the Margherita pizza and a Peroni to sip. Simple, but it really allows the ingredients to shine. It's always a good sign to see an owner as involved as Matteo is. Keep an eye out for him when you're finished with your meal--he'll likely be heading your way with a bottle of Limoncello. Will be coming back for a long time."}
{"text":"Great food!  Great atmosphere!  The owner/manager really went that extra mile!  Very welcoming place!"}
{"text":"I decided to give Pomo another shot. I ended up at the same high table that overlooks the kitchen. For whatever reason, this spot seems to be unpopular but I like it because it keeps me warm AND I can see what's going on with my food!  My friend and I shared the Mista salad and the Pomo pizza. I was much more pleased this time with the food we ordered! The sausage on the Pomo pizza was delicious and the Mista salad was larger and more filling than we expected. It's also fun to get all of the little freebies. They brought out bread and oil, the fried strips of dough with powdered sugar (again), limoncello (again), and then this sweet cake. It felt like the longer we sat there, the more food they put in front of us! Service is very attentive and I never felt that we had to wait long for anything. Also, I'm assuming the man who gives out the limoncello shots is the owner and it's fun to see him around.   The pizza is still not my favorite in the valley (hence the 4 stars) but I can definitely say that it's a solid place to go and it's a nice option in the pizza rotation."}
{"text":"Excellent ingredients, true Napolitani! First time here and we where treated like family. Wide beer and wine selection and a to-die-for homemade limoncello!!!"}
{"text":"This place is hands down the best Italian food I've ever had. Service was amazing! When you walk in it feels very cozy, very LA. Of course it was busy! But we got a table in 10 mins. I ordered a \"Vespa\" cocktail at the bar while we waited for a table, and it was perfect! It's sweet and it had a couple raspberries! Then I ordered the Pomo pizza, the lasagna and a canoli. Everything was delicious! So flavorful! I will definitely come back again very soon! I'm just so lucky that its super close to where I work:)"}
{"text":"Delish!  The lasagna and the pizzas were devoured nearly immediately.  The complimentary post-meal limoncello is TO DIE FOR.  It's reason enough to come here.  Cocktails were tasty and service was good."}
{"text":"Was staying downtown near here and came across this place. What an awesome find! Not American style pizza for sure and that is a good thing. Great food and service. There was a hottie for eye candy in the open kitchen which enhanced the whole experience."}
{"text":"I don't know what I can say that hasn't already been said. My family and I have gone here for many special occasions. It has a classy ambience some of the best Neapolitan pizza in Phoenix. I normally get the Margherita pizza for fear that the other pizzas might not be as perfect. My family gets different pizzas, and they always love it, so I'm probably wrong, but I still don't want to take the chance. I've since moved to Seattle and have developed cravings for this pizza. I imagine this will be one of my first visits upon returning to the area."}
{"text":"We stopped by Pomo's this afternoon. The pizza was delicious. We sat at the bar next to where they make the pizza. The guys were friendly and wanted to make sure we were satisfied with our food. All fresh. Service was fantastic. We will return!"}
{"text":"Pomo is a hugely welcome addition to the downtown area and manages to hold its own against the nearby Cibo and Pizzeria Bianco. Great wine selection, decent beer choices, and the food is terrificl. An additional perk are the complimentary powdered sugar dough crisps and limoncello shot."}
{"text":"Very good pizza!  They have a very unique taste and texture, but it definitely works in their favor.  The cheeses and meats seem to be very high quality, and their combinations seem a bit weird at first but are definitely well thought out.  If you're in downtown and want some great pizza, definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Phoenix,  hands down!!!  Chicago and New York styles should bow there heads out of respect."}
{"text":"Loved this place! My boyfriend lives walking distance from here so we headed over to grab a quick bite before a party. Fast, amazingly good pizza (we got the one with prosciutto and arugula) that rivals any other pizza I've had in Phoenix and fantastic service. Everyone who works is SO nice and friendly. Like- really, really nice. You'll see! I'd love to go back for drinks/dessert too!"}
{"text":"I just cannot get over what an awesome experience eating here was.  The ambiance, incredible service, unbelievably good food and super fast wait time.  They have this cool-looking stove that is kept at such a hot temp, that the pizza cooks in 90 seconds... mind blown.  The pizza - uh! :) Perfect combo of crusty/soft dough, incredible flavor - legitimately different than any pizza I've tasted before.  Then- the complimentary pieces of fried dough (think wonton meets fry bread) dusted with powdered sugar.  So very yum.  I was falling all over myself to the waitstaff about how great everything was & out comes this wonderful man (manager?) with a bottle of homemade Limoncello (liqueur) & hands out shots to my table! Just ridiculous! We floated out of there, yammering on about all the people we were going to convince to go (and take us with them) to this place!  Take your friends, family, go solo - just get there. It's worth the couple bucks more than a chain-pizza place. So very worth it."}
{"text":"My search is OVER.......this is by far the BEST, BEST, BEST pizza you can get west of the Mississippi.  Possibly better than my beloved east coast pizza.  The crust is made with love - well taken care of to ensure a consistent thickness all the way around.  No giant burnt bubbles and thick on one slice and paper thin on the other......not good eats.  The texture - OMG - ridiculously light and soft on the inside and ever so slightly crunchy on the outside. Crazy Good!  The sauce is what pizza sauce is supposed to be - light but tastes like actual tomatoes - not ketchup.  Oh the cheese.......we had the classic Regina Margherita and the Peppino which has ricotta (rigawt as we say on the east coast) and salami (pepperoni).  The cheese sat on the pizza like a favorite flashy accessory and the taste was fresh and phenomenal.  The chef brought out their hot pepper oil and grated parmesan and oregano which yes I used that oil for crust dipping! Aside from the food - service was fantastic.  The server and the hostess were very pleasant and attentive but not buggy.  After inhaling our pizzas, the chef came out and gave us a plate of fried thin pizza dough covered with powdered and two chilled shot glasses of some very proudly house made limoncello creme.  I would buy a gallon of this drink if it was available.  After all that pleasant food worshiping, I HAD to have their cannolis.  I am very critical of cannolis and their filling.  The filling was firm but soft and full of flavor.  Presentation was lovely as well.  I can only say if you have a hankering for REAL pizza, come to Pomo and support a local business that brings pizza happiness to Phoenix and to all who visit.  You will NOT be disappointed."}
{"text":"The pizzas were similar to other good neapolitan pizzas I've had. I wouldn't say among the best but I'd come back if someone wanted to go. I think they skimped on basil for one pizza but did good with arugula on another. Two friends ordered tomato soup, and they both really liked it. One picked up the bowl and slurped it clean. Owner? comes around and offered some treats at the end of our meal which was a nice touch.   The restaurant is not large and I can imagine there'd be a wait during peak hours.   Not a 5-star experience because: parmesan and oregano were brought out after a whole pizza was already eaten, staff looked really tired/disgruntled when they walked around, and the bathroom was pretty dirty with towels all over the floor. Not big deals but things for the restaurant to work on."}
{"text":"GO HERE. The pizza was amazing and the free limoncello at the end of the meal was to die for. I'd like them to start selling it because I'd definitely buy a bottle or two. Brought my out of town guests here on recommendation of a friend (who always knows the most delicious places) and I was NOT disappointed. This is true simple woodfired pizza at its finest, complete with very fresh ingredients. Yum!"}
{"text":"Great food and service, patio misters way to strong can't enjoy outside feels like your taking a shower, but everything else was great."}
{"text":"Great service and great pizza!  We tried the Don Alfonso and added garlic... Very good.  The complementary limoncello at the end, priceless!"}
{"text":"We came to Pomo on a whim and I am glad we did. We walked in and were greeted and sat right away.The pizza was really good. I order the margarita pizza and it was really tasty. We enjoyed a shot of chilled limoncello and called it a night. Great food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Awesome -- just awesome. I'm in a food coma after a delicious Brie and prosciutto pizza with fresh ingredients and complimentary limoncello. On top of that, everyone that works there is great -- it made me feel like a local (Italian) hangout even as an out of towner"}
{"text":"Neapolitan pizza is my favorite pizza by far.  I used to drive from Midtown to the old location in the Borgata during my lunch hour. Now I can just ride the light rail.  The staff has always been friendly and the food is amazing."}
{"text":"AH-mazing pizza!! I ordered their pepperoni and my husband ordered an artichoke, olive, onion, mushroom To die for. Really good. Crisp edges and scrumptious! A+++ Excellent service too"}
{"text":"Tried this last night with the wife. Wow...what a great experience. Really nice and attentive staff. Great pizza and lasagna! We decided to get the Creme Br√ªl√©e, which the wife claims is better than Cowboy Ciao's. In my opinion Pomo is better than Cibo and Pizzeria Bianco."}
{"text":"We ate at Pomo again tonight. Pomo is our favorite place in Phoenix. I really enjoyed my pizza with Brie cheese and smoked prosciutto. David also made me an awesome cucumber basil martini. Pomo's food is always fantastic and service outstanding."}
{"text":"As I prepared to write this review, I went to look for my original review.  I found none.  Which is amazing, since I have been here at least 30 times and have checked in enough times to be the current Duke.    This is my go to place in Phoenix for thin crust pizza in a great atmosphere.  I have been to Bianco, Cibo, Federal etc.  This is still the place for me to bring visitors and friends.  1. star for perfect execution of the food - every time 2. star for great atmosphere - you feel like you are in a contemporary Italian nightspot. 3. star for perfect execution of the food  - every item. 4. star for reasonable pricing 5. star for the personal touch that Matheu (owner? or manager?) gives each table.  Makes it feel like home.  And for me after 30 + visits it is almost home.  Seriously, I have not had a single bad (or even mediocre) item here ever."}
{"text":"I love this place! I went about a month ago and I can't stop thinking about it! The atmosphere is wonderful, even on a weeknight. The space is bigger than it looks from the street, with a beautiful brick oven. It gives off a fun, hip, yet romantic ambiance. We ordered 2 pizzas from their traditional pizza menu and we both loved them. We had a delicious grapefruit italian soda in a cool, vintage-y bottle. And the kicker? They brought us a FREE dessert because we casually mentioned to our server that it was our first time here. And the owner brought out the dessert himself. Now that is impressive. Oh, and he brought out free shots of some limoncello vodka drink! It makes you feel special to get that much attention! I will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service...thank you David. Great food, great price, amazing lemon cello. If you want a great dining experience with good people, Pomo is the place."}
{"text":"Pomo has the best service around. Come for the food and leave with friends for life. Been here 11 weekends in a row and haven't had better service. Ask for Stan, Giada, or Francesco, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This pizza is the best around! Make the trip to have this BOMB pizza made from a genuine brick oven! We sat at the bar and our bartender, Chad, was the best - super friendly and he definitely knows his stuff :) If you haven't tried Pomo, you NEED to!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious and the customer service is amazing. One of the owners came to our table to introduce himself and gave us two shots and yummy dessert."}
{"text":"Excellent food, incredible customer service. The owner and staff are so hospitable, it feels just like Italy. Food 10/10 staff 10/10 experience 10/10. I cannot wait to come back."}
{"text":"Not happy today with the service or the food.  So different from last year to now, expensive for lunch.  The service was mediocre and the food was okay.   Ordered but had to ask for entree and dessert.  In Italian:  Non contento oggi con il servizio o il cibo. Cos√¨ diverso dallo scorso anno ad oggi, costoso per il pranzo. Il servizio era mediocre e il cibo era okay. Ordinato ma ha dovuto chiedere per antipasto e dessert."}
{"text":"Second time was the charm.  This place was packed after a D'Backs game, but I brought my friends here anyway.  Whatever might have been missing the first time around has been rectified.  The pizzas were perfect.  The staff was extremely friendly.  And the mood very much reflected the growing reputation of this place.  Cibo and Bianco have been put on notice.  Pomo has the goods to take on their neighborhood competitors.  Bravo Pomo staff.  You've got a great future downtown."}
{"text":"Racism in America!!!  Went to try out their pizza as I read an article about this restaurant and it seemed to be pretty busy, so I was thinking good sign right? If it's busy it has to be great food. Well we walked in and approached the hostess and I said \"table for two please\". She and I seemed to browse the selection of seating at the same time and I saw a table for two open in the back and thought, \"awesome an open table!\" Nope, to my surprise the hostess turns to us and states, \"it's going to be 35-45 min wait unless you would like to sit at the bar or outside.\" Well it's 100 degrees outside, so that's not an option and the bar was pretty crowded as it was so, I looked at my husband and he nodded no, so I said, \"that's okay thank you.\" There were two other restaurants in the plaza so we went to check them out and there was no waiting but that also means the food may not be very good. I said to my husband, maybe we should go and just wait our time out for the pizza cause it's got to be good if there's a wait versus a the two restaurants that are virtual ghost towns. So we wander back into the Pizzeria and by now there is a couple that had walked in right before us. It's literally been 2-3 minutes that has passed. I thought great the wait may be longer now but our loss, our fault. We walk inside to stand behind the couple to place our names back on the list and was very surprised when the hostess grabbed two menus and proceeds to lead them to the very same table I saw was open merely minutes before. So by this time I am completely confused as to why we would have not been seated at the table. So the hostess turns to us as she walks back to the hostess podium and has a look as though she had just been caught doing something naughty but I dismiss the weird look and I said, \"we are back.\" She said, \"oh okay it won't be long probably 20 minutes.\" I said okay we will wait and there was a table that needed to be cleared so I thought, surely we will be seated momentarily. My husband and I go to wait outside as there is little space in the entrance and a woman pushing a wheelchair and an older gentlemen walk up to the entrance and I go to open the door for them and pleasantries are exchanged. I turn back to my husband as he tells me, \"I cannot believe that just happened, can we just go?\" I said, \"let's wait a moment there's a table opening up and I would like to give the restaurant the benefit of the doubt as this type of racism can't still blatantly litter our community. I would like to see if we get seated before the party that just arrived.\" My husband just nods his head and we watch in wonder as the hostess picks up 3 menus and led them to the table that opened up. So it's probably not hard to guess at this point that either my husband or I are minorities. My husband is black and I am Amerasian. The couple was Caucasian, as were the party of three. Needless to say my husband and I left and will not grace our presence at this establishment's doorstep again!!!! Shame on you for allowing such a practice at your place if business!! At one time your ancestors were the minority, but you must have forgotten that part of Americas's noble history!!!!!"}
{"text":"Move over Cibo and Pizzeria Bianco, you now have a new follower!  Thought Cibo was the best pizza in the valley until I discovered Pomo a few days ago.  Only regret I have is not finding this place earlier!  What started off as a shaky start (not being acknowledged for 10 minutes after sitting down) turned out to be an excellent meal and even better service.    Compared to it's competitors, Pomo has a lot more on their menu to order from.  I got the classic Bruchetta and Margarita Pizza.  I was absolutely blown away by the flavors in the bruchetta, but the pizza was the star of the night.  Perfect dough, san marzano tomato sauce, ovalini mozzarella, basil.  slightly chared on the bottom.  perfection.  Towards the end of the meal, the owner came to my table and provided me a desert.  I said thank you, but I didn't order this.  He said, I know, but this is something we would like to give you for free.  A few minutes later, he comes back with a shot glass and some sort of alcoholic beverage.  I said thank you, but I don't drink.  They acknowledged that they messed up by having me wait in the beginning, but made up for it with this genuine offer.  I will definitely be a frequent visitor of Pomo as they also have locations in Chandler, Scottsdale, and Glendale.  Looking forward to my next pizza...seriously, this stuff is good."}
{"text":"Remember when Pomo used to occupy that touristy faux-Mediterranean space in the most upscale part of Scottsdale?  They served one of the best Napoletana pizzas I have ever had in one of the most pretentious, snooty atmospheres imaginable.  I am thrilled to report that my experience with the downtown Pomo was not at all the same.  Having just walked from Cibo, where we enjoyed a decent pie (I'm still not convinced that Cibo comes anywhere close to its level of hype), we stepped into Pomo, expecting to be lambasted with stucco, fake accents, and photos of Florence.  Imagine our surprise when it turned out to be... trendy?  That's right, it was modern decor, and the waitstaff was of the hipster variety.  Wow, that was unexpected!  My biggest problem with the original store had been taken care of.  This was turning out to be an excellent dining experience.  We then ordered our pie, expecting the same quality we had enjoyed from the old Scottsdale oven.  Nope.  What happened?  The pizza was not adequately soupy.  It lacked the amazing flavor and attention to detail that made it somewhat worthwhile to brave Scottsdale's most self-absorbed patrons.  In short, it was underwhelming.   After we left here, we proceeded to walk right down the street to La Piazza Locale (also VPN certified), for our third and best pie of the evening.  I suggest you do the same.  They have the same modern vibe with a much better Napoletana pie."}
{"text":"There's no place like Pomo. Take a ride from the farm and walk down the shimmering yellow road, it will lead you to a magical kingdom like none other, the Kingdom of Pomo, ruled by David the bartender. Enter the door, belly up to the bar and let David take care of your every knead.  I promise, this trip is worth dodging flying monkeys and battling the wicked witch of the west (side) where her tastiest pizza is akin to mall food court. Not that it's all bad, but in comparison, it's mall food court; they all fall short.  In the battle of phoenix pizzerias, Pomo takes top billing for me these days, delicious, fresh, oh man, it's soo good. When you're finished with your meal, don't forget to ask them about their limoncello; the best anywhere and best yet, this is a complimentary after dinner drink. Tell them your friends say they serve the best limoncello in all the land and they'll promptly and proudly serve one up in a flash.  Happy yelping Phoenix, if you're going for Pomo later, don't forget to invite me along ;-)"}
{"text":"This is a really cool, fun place. I always sit at the counter overlooking (right on top of, actually) the pizza-making operation. Their pizza's are great, the service is good--and the view is fascinating. Plus, you get a treat at the end! What could be better than that?"}
{"text":"Great service and fantastic food. Fresh ingredients. Perfect ratios of cheese to sauce. And the crust was nice and crisp and held up the rest of the pizza perfectly. The dessert crisps with powder sugar were also light and delicious."}
{"text":"When I first was pulling up to Pomo's, I was a little mislead. It was fairly close to Arizona State University and was close to the center of downtown Phoenix so I didn't expect it to be as good as it was. The restaurant was not as big as I thought it was going to be, however, that did not change the fact that the food was amazing. The only negative part about going to this Pomo's is you have to be prepared to pay $5 for parking unless you want to park far away. Nonetheless, the parking is right outside of the restaurant so it is not a far walk at all.   As soon as I walked into the restaurant, I was immediately seated. There was a fantastic Italian smell there that really gives you the full experience of the food. The menu was quite confusing if I'm being completely honest. It took my friend and I only a few minutes to decide what we wanted to eat but the waitress checked up on us a few times to make sure we were still doing alright. When it came to ordering, I had to ask the waitress to help me understand the menu but she was very nice and helpful.  The food was delivered within 10 minutes of ordering it and when it came out, it looked fantastic. I ordered pizza and if definitely looked professionally made. They did not have ranch which was kind of disappointing but I guess with a place as good as Pomo's you don't need the ranch. When I needed a refill, the waitress literally came over as soon as I set my cup down to come refill my drink. All in all, the service was great, the food was great, and the overall environment was great."}
{"text":"\"Top notch\" ~Dinner partner \"Best pizza in Phoenix\" ~couple next to us at bar  This place was great. We're in town from Ohio for the bengals-cardinals game. We were looking for good pie and that's what we found. Pair that with excellent service and it makes for a great night.  David was inviting, professional and sincere. He offered advice on what to see around time. Discussed football with us (he's a Bears fan.) And went above the level of attention one would expect at a pizza bar/restaurant that offers such great food at such a good price.  All in all, stop in if you get the chance. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Pomo Phoenix is near perfect in every way.   We came here last weekend before a play at Herberger Theater and it reminded us sooo much of their original on Scottsdale Road. Great ambiance, with the owner hovering around, making sure everyone was having a good time. Nice!  We started off with some bruschetta and plate of Carpaccio. Both were delicious. We shared a Regina Margarita and it just took us back to their old location. Wonderful.   They say you cannot go back, well this Pomo's is pretty darn close to the original. Four and a half Stars rounded up to Five. Expect to pay $45 for two, including taxes but not gratuities.   Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Wecome to Arizona . If this is the best pizza in Arizona. Save your money. Go to Walmart get the everything pizza for $10 follow instructions and I guarantee you it tastes better than what you get here at a ridiculous price for a miniature size pizza. In New York this would go out of business charging what they do for what they give you. For Arizona I'm serious try that walmart pizza and save your money. They just don't make pizza as good out here and no joke, walmart bests dominos and the rest of the average . I have been throwing parties for 20 yrs and make my own pizzas. I enjoy others who make excellent pizzas. Drove an hour to get here wasted my time gas and money. One day I heated up a walmart pizza. I thought Walmart was a joke. Wrong!"}
{"text":"On a adventure Saturday, we walked in on this gem behind the Phoenix public market. This old world style pizza bar has by far the coolest ambiance in town. Unpretentious and cozy brick and wood decor matches a well rounded menu. We ordered Principe pizza. Wow the fresh basil and soft crust melts in your mouth. With just the right amount of fired edges makes this place #1 on my pizza bucket list.  Thanks Mihai for a great experience.  Omg did i say the food was great!!"}
{"text":"Giving this place a two star.  Reason why.  I never eaten here, definitely a first time. A friend  was thoughtful to bring me along to have dinner with him. Seats were limited and had no choice to eat at corner of the bar. The place had a good vibe. And the food was great. At the end of finishing my meal i was cashing out to pay my bill, the dude with the long hair who works at Pomo knocked my drink over and my drink spilled on the counter top and all over my shorts and t-shift. Of course I kept my cool and behaved well and took it easy. The guy got a little annoying when he kept apologizing to me. A great way to make good impression to a place you'll never will come back to.  Felt embarrassed with my clothes wet was not something I had in mind."}
{"text":"This is definitely a solid place.  We had the chicken salad and the primo(?) - prosciutto, arugula, parmesan pizza.  The dressing for the salad was better balanced than most places which I definitely noticed (my tongue is very sensitive to acidic and salty food).  The pizza was tasty, though it had a bit too much ash and burn on it for my taste.  The pizza also had a tough time holding together for bites, smaller pieces of prosciutto should help.    The free limoncello shots and powder sugar dusted fried dough were a nice touch to make this place stand out.    I think I like Cibo better, but this place is a solid second for this type of pizza."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place because of all the great reviews. My friends rave about it too! So of course I went in with pretty high expectations.   Someone had mentioned this below, but I do agree that this seems to be one of those places that gets a lot of hype so people may convince themselves that it's better than it actually is. The pizza was just 'good' in my opinion. I ordered a cappuccino too and when it came out I was like what the heck is this? Haha. There was no foam whatsoever. It just looked like chocolate milk. Still tasted decent, but was really weird. An Italian thing? Maybe? Who knows... I also ordered a salad. Nothing too special about it either. Though the mangoes on the salad were so ripe and delicious!!  While we are there they started to clean the brick oven and man it was a super powerful smell. Whatever chemicals they were using. Luckily we were done eating, but some people were getting nauseous. Something I could easily overlook if the food was amaze-balls but unfortunately it was just average. I did go there with some people who have been there before and said they really liked it the first time, but agreed that it wasn't as good this time. So maybe an off day for them? I have to admit that might make me come back and try it one more time.  Hard to pass up some great (and MUCH better) pizza at Cibo, North, and Bianco in order to come back though. But maybe if I am desperate, I'll give it another shot."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  I was so disappointed to hear that Pomo was closing in the Borgata, but was quickly relieved and excited to hear that it was opening in downtown Phoenix...within walking distance to my loft - score!    The margarita pizza with a San Pellegrino orange is an absolutely perfect dinner...I'll be back many times over for this tasty treat!  Great location in downtown, great atmosphere and decor, friendly staff and super tasty food."}
{"text":"Oh dear lord this place is good.  I go to the turf more often than I'd care to admit and I've always wondered what the food here was like.  I'm really picky when it comes to pizza or italian food as most places tend to put way too much sugar in their marinara.    A friend and I wanted to try some place neither of us had been and I'd heard good things about this place from some friends so I decided to give it a try.  We ordered a salad, pizza and a couple drinks.  We were both blown away with not only the service but the food as well.    There are a couple of artisan pizza places not that far from Pomo that get a lot of attention but I'm honestly not a fan.  Pomo is hands down my favorite pizza place in AZ."}
{"text":"Heaven, heaven, heaven! The PERFECT pizza!! Better than New York, Chicago, and Miami. I downed two pies without blinking. It's worth coming back to Phoenix for this piece of heaven."}
{"text":"While I think it really bites that their original spot had to relocate because a famous place is being torn down for yet another set of luxury apartments, I am SUPER glad that downtown Phoenix gained another fantastic locally owned spot to nosh at!    This is only one of 2 places that is certified (not sure what the term is) as a genuine and authentic Napoletena-style pizza restaurant.  Apparently, it even comes down to the type of marble they use to make their dough on.  Seriously cool!    The owners are from Naples and have definitely brought a taste of Italy to Phoenix.  While we were there, one of the co-owners was in working and walking around. In fact, he brought some of his homemade blend of a creamy Limoncello to us to try and some friend dough.  Talk about a great dining experience!    My friend had the caprese to start with and she loooooved it!  We ordered the margherita pizza which is one of about 3 or 4 genuine Neopolitan pizzas they serve.  Sweet jesus!  The sauce was perfect, the crust was the right consistency (could have done without the overcooked spots in the crust though), and the mozarella was mmmm mmmm good! I ordered what I thought was an appetizer flat bread, but it turned out to be the same size as the pizza (it was super rich...a little too much garlic, but delicious nonetheless).  There was plenty to go around and enough for leftovers to take home too.  For dessert we had their Tiramisu, which my friend boasted as being the best she has had in the valley (and she has tried it every where).  I had their cream puffs that are covered in chocolate mousse.  Wipe the drool off your chin.  Both were fantastic, but I wish I'd have gone with my first instinct and had their Nutella cake after spotting their GIGANTIC jar of Nutella in the kitchen.    I'll definitely be back and bringing other friends with me to try it out AND so I can have that cake!!"}
{"text":"Run, don't walk, to Pomo Pizzeria Napoletana. Go for the tasty pizza, great salads and roasted vegetables. Appreciate the professional service, nice large wine glasses - with a reasonable pour- and generosity of limoncello for dessert.  Thank you for not rushing our enjoyment of your food and our company!"}
{"text":"I've been to Pomo twice in the last month and have been more than pleased both times.    The service is first rate.  I had a smiling, friendly, helpful server both times.  There is a great selection of craft and common beers.  The wine list is impressive too and won't break the bank.  Try the grilled peppers as an appetizer.  May sound simple but very tasty.  You can't go wrong with any of their pizzas but the napoletana is not just good but damn good."}
{"text":"The placed was packed for a Tuesday night, but it isn't that huge either.  I decided to order to go instead.  I order the Margherita pizza and it was ready less that 10 minutes."}
{"text":"The pizza here is by far the best in Phoenix. Every pizza is full of great flavor and the crusts are crunchy but not dry, which is hard to come by. The location here is small but it's very intimate and the owner himself makes appearances to the customers after every meal to offer a small desert and limoncello. We always get a pizza per person and it's more than filling and the price, for what you're getting, is worth it."}
{"text":"I stopped here for a bite on a Thursday night, after flying solo to Phoenix, planning to meet up with my wife the next day. I was so impressed that we came back together for Sunday lunch before we flew home. Both times it was amazing; my wife was as impressed as I was. It took maybe four minutes for my pizza to arrive after I ordered it. They bake very quickly in the wood-fired oven. I tried the Toto Sapore and the Diavolo. Both were delicious, but the Diavolo (essentially a fancy pepperoni pizza) especially so. My server (the same both visits) was friendly, knowledgeable, and prompt. Nice atmosphere inside. There's a patio out front, as well, with a great few of the Westward Ho building."}
{"text":"If I could give 10 stars, I would. A friend and I literally stumbled upon this pizzeria on our attempt to make it to Crescent Ballroom. We sat at the bar, had a bottle of wine (great Italian variety) with amazing apptizers, we almost past on pizza until we noticed the owner watching every pizza cook individually and making sure each one got just enough heat . Finallly people in AZ who know pizza. Thank you. Traditional pizza done right."}
{"text":"What a treasure! We split a Pomo pizza. It had a tender yet crispy crust and delicious toppings and sauce. Pizza was followed by a scrumptious semifreddo. The owner stopped by our table with a creamy homemade limoncello -- gratis. Service was friendly and speedy. Everything was as close to perfect as one can get in this life!"}
{"text":"One word...\"lasagna\". It was so good.. Service and pizza good too. I'm only giving 4 stars because I'm greedy.. Lol. One size pizza, it's a stretch to share if you're hungry."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to try the pizza here, since my friends raved about it. The hostess was nice and sat us right away. However, we were served waters and no one attended to us for fifteen minutes... No drink orders, explanation of specials, etc. decided to leave. I'm sure we'll give it another try, but service is big for me."}
{"text":"Another awesome meal. Good service, ambiance, food."}
{"text":"I AM ONE HAPPY CUSTOMER! The cuisine and service at Pomo is unparalleled. I was taken here for my birthday last night and I could not wait to write a raving review. The food is truly heaven to the taste buds with their fresh ingredients and traditional Italian recipes. They are inventive with their menu and there is no need to have anything more than what is on it...because everything is delicious...simply perfect! The owner takes pride in ensuring his customers are happy by greeting every single person that walks through his door and offering special goodies to enhance your taste buds and experience (I will leave that one in suspense for you to find out on your own).  We ordered the tiramisu and my family put candles in it to sing to me. As if this delectable dessert was not wonderful enough, as soon as the owner saw me blow out my candles, he rushed to make me a special birthday treat of his own. A birthday sprinkled plate with a canoli (absolutely delicious) for everyone at the table and a rose dollop of dessert cream with a candle in it. Then he shared a shot of cinnamon crema from Italy with everyone at the table to salute my birthday. I FELT LIKE A QUEEN!  Additionally, you must try their chamomile grappa. Must!  I cannot express enough how the beautiful atmosphere, amazing food and kind service made my entire night so very special. I will never forget it and I will be back as often as time will allow me to be.  THANK YOU POMO for making this birthday girl very happy!"}
{"text":"Too bad you can split this review I would have given a 5 star for the pizza and salad but they get a minus 5 for service. The server was pretty bad. No refills of water or ice tea and never checked on us to see if we needed anything else."}
{"text":"Pomo is hands down the ONE pizza that I crave with a vengeance. About a year ago I set out to try other up and coming pizzerias in the valley and try my own sort of self proving standard against what I thought was the ultimate high bar that Pomo had unknowingly set.. a complete ten on the pizza level in my world of taste buds. I have yet to find it here. There are some truly great pizzerias here in Phoenix and Scottsdale, don't get me wrong! BUT none of them compare to Pomo. The crust is what makes the pizza here so delightfully perfect in ones mouth! The crust on every pizza I've had here has an authenticity hard to find outside of Italy. Oh wait!  They have that special authentic Naples seal, after all!:  The APN, Associazione Pizzaiuoli Napoletani and the VPN , Verace Pizza Napoletana. Do the research on those earned and coveted culinary seals and you will see that they are true Naples, Italy certifications for amazing! My very favorite pizza is the Pizza Chef. A white pie of prosciutto, basil, mushrooms, parma cheese and crema all topped on that amazing crust that is perfect and crisp to the bite. AND, I can't resist always starting with the Affettati Misti, Pomo's charcuterie and Italian cheese board that comes olives and their amazing house made bread. Don't be taken aback if you find yourself having to wait for a table. You likely will. While you wait, Pomo has a great, yet small, bar and an amazing bartender too. David will figure out your wants for libations and make sure you are happy ! The wine list is awesome here. The Italian cocktails are unique and fresh. Who doesn't like an Italian mojito because it has prosecco added?! The patio here is fun and dog friendly; there are sometimes Italian Vespas parked out front to look at .. or jazz up your Instagram feed! Sometimes after perusing the PHX Public Market, I have found myself on the Pomo patio for an afternoon cocktail and lunch! I have always been too full to partake in any of the desserts here at Pomo.. I keep promising myself to box up some of the pizza and order a Panna Cotta! Know that you will be treated very well by Pomo staff and the management, as well. If you are here in the evening, it is not out of the ordinary to get a gratis Limoncello to top off your amazing meal. It is house made and served in a shot glass. Not to be taken like a shot because it is to be savored like the delight it is: lemony and creamy. The fried pieces of dough doused in sweet sugar are pretty good to finish off the meal too. The vibe here is friendly, fun and trendy. Worth the wait for amazing pizza! My very favorite pizza quite possibly.. outside of Italy! Whats better .. they are legit Italians here!"}
{"text":"Yum! Love this place. Always fun to visit, polite attentive staff, great food, fair price!"}
{"text":"The pizza is perfect, melted cheese right to the crust, incredibly fresh toppings, great cocktails, I could go on but I need to get back to dinner. Believe the reviews and come here."}
{"text":"After a couple of disappointing no go holiday parties at restaraunts downtown, we stumbled on this place. It looked like a place I had eaten in Rome and the pizza on one diners plate looked remarkably like the pizza I eaten while in Italy.  This proved to be one of the most delightful surprises. From the caprese to the pizza, there isn't one thing I would change. What will keep me coming back? LASAGNA BOLOGNESE. Hard to make. Harder to find prepared well. This was it. Yum. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Love Pomo!  Finally, great service downtown!  Pizza was perfect. There were four of us in our party. We started with a salad to share, good and plenty for a starter. We wanted to try two pizzas to share, our wonderful server suggested ordering one, then when about ready, she would bring the second.  Timing was perfect and both pizza's will make us all come back for more.   Then, the owner came out to the table with a light desert, on the house!  A few minutes later, he reappeared with a homemade Lemochello Cream...he was super nice, friendly and both of our treats were the perfect ending to a perfect dinner!  Thanks Pomo...we will be back!"}
{"text":"I have to say I was blown away with the food served. The bruschetta was incredible and not over spiced with garlic. If it was there, it was really smooth. The grape tomatoes were a different thing for me and I loved it.   The pizza we enjoyed was the POMO: Italian Sausage, Roasted Red Bell Pepper, Sauteed Onions, Sauteed Mushrooms. It was fantastic! Thin crust, yet the flavor of the bread was present and complimented the tasty toppings.  If you can, get a seat at the bar by the oven. Not hot at all and you get to see the process. It's like dinner and a show!  To end the meal, have a generous slice of tiramisu. Perfect amount of ooz, if ya know what I mean.  I don't want to forget, the owner/mgr I believe, comes out with an unexpected bonus shot of homemade limoncello and honey drizzled pastry bits. My God it was heavenly.   I love, just love this place."}
{"text":"I go to Phoenix once a year on business. I always eat dinner here! Usually at least twice! Best Italian food I have ever had! Killer pizzas! Amazing, out of this world lasagna!"}
{"text":"A girlfriend and I dined here last night and sat at the counter and we were very impressed. The pizza was amazing to say the least. The service was excellent and watching them make the pizza pie was interesting. Huge brick oven that was made in Italy and shipped over. The owner is a delight, very humble and offered us limoncello as an after dinner drink, which was fantastic. Perfect lemon taste. Can't wait to go back there and experience more wonderful food and company."}
{"text":"We were so impressed by this place!   The space is small. My boyfriend and I didn't have reservations, and no tables were available when we arrived around 6pm, but there were seats available by the \"pizza bar\" so we sat there. The pizza bar is right in front of the kitchen and oven, and you can see all the pizzas being made.  The waitress was very friendly and explained the menu to us, as there are three different types of pizza listed: I believe they are classic (red sauce), traditional napoletana style, and white. The prices are reasonable for what you get. The pizzas were some of the best I've ever had. The white pizza we chose had parmesan and prosciutto. They don't skimp on the prosciutto-- the entire pizza was covered in a layer! The red pizza had cooked onions and pancetta. The sauce is unique and delicious; one of the kitchen staff told us that the sauce is made specifically for this type of pizza. The thin crust has a nice crispy finish on the outside.   We watched them make the pizzas; the employees are clearly experts at it. The food comes out quickly, as the oven takes only about four minutes to cook each pizza. The time from oven to table was literally under a minute-- one employee would take the pizza out of the oven, another would be waiting to slice it, and a runner would be waiting to take the pizza to the table. I loved that the owner was pitching in in the kitchen and taking food out to the tables. When one of the pizza-makers had downtime, he went to wash some dishes. Everything runs efficiently.   When we were done eating, we were looking at the dessert menu when the owner brought us a free dessert. I'm not sure what it's called, but it's kind of like elephant ears or a funnel cake but more crispy dough, sprinkled with powdered sugar. Then the owner surprised us again with free shots of limoncello! The waitress told us that the owner makes the limoncello himself. It was amazingly sweet and smooth. Drink it slowly; one of the kitchen staff said people tend to knock back the shot quickly, but you're supposed to drink it slowly and savor it. I agree.  When we told the owner how happy we were with the meal, he seemed genuinely happy and thankful. The staff clearly care a lot about their customers and creating a good experience. I only wish they had a location in DC, where I live!  Parking is the only downside, as it's not free. There are limited 3-hour meters out front; the rest are 1-hour, so you would have to go out to feed the meter halfway through your meal. We parked next door in the university parking lot, which was $5."}
{"text":"I used the Yelp app yesterday to discover Pomo while in Phoenix for work. It was an excellent experience from start to finish! Outstanding service, outstanding food (better than pizza I've had in Italy), a passionate chef... what more could you want?  Erica was a great server - friendly, attentive, and helpful throughout the entire meal. The best part - after finishing my 12\" Pomo pizza (delicious, and more than enough for one person) and Peroni, Chef Matteo brought a plate of Italian fried dough and a shot of his homemade limoncello - on the house.  I was in and out in less than an hour (because I had to get back to a seminar), but would have gladly ordered another drink and enjoyed the friendly atmosphere if I had more time.  I will absolutely stop in again the next time I'm in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Pizzaria in Phoenix. Better pizza than cibo, more homey than pizza biancos, and better service than spinatos. I enjoyed my first trip profusely and I will return."}
{"text":"Pizza took a little long but they went above and beyond to make it right and we weren't even upset. Great pizza, great experience!"}
{"text":"My family makes this spot our weekly Thursday night dinner. Pizza! It's simply delicious! Yup, just that simple. The crust is thin - our order is normally done within 5 minutes and we've never been disappointed. We normally get the salscicca (spell check) or don Alfonso and it's never bland or soggy. We recently ordered the Calzone and still as delicious. We haven't had anything as of yet that we didn't like on their menu. We have been Thursday night regulars for about 6 months now.... We love  pizza (clearly lol) and are always willing to try new places and still this spot tops our list."}
{"text":"I was visiting Phoenix for a conference and was suggested this fine establishment due to their authentic wood fired pizzas. I was not disappointed. The service was fantastic and the pizza was even better. If I'm ever back in the area, I know where to go."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place because it is a cute pizzeria in downtown Phoenix.  But on my two visits the food is merely average and maybe a tick below average.  Our last visit we got the mango salad.  The portion size is generous and enough for two, but it tasted like there wasn't enough dressing, the lettuce was chopped so small you almost needed a spoon to scoop it up, and it tasted like it had cabbage in it (it was supposed to be arugula and baby lettuce).  The pizza was okay, but needed seasonings and I think $16 for a 12-inch pizza is just too expensive.  Service is a little lagging and with the exception of the manager on duty, no one seemed particularly happy for my business."}
{"text":"Maybe my review is biased towards the fact that my expectations were too high. How can an establishment that have hundreds of reviews and border 5 stars get away with such a below average food?   Taken into account that I have been to a countless amount of top Italian restaurants, I do not feel guilty at all to give them two stars. The only reason why it has got an extra one war sure to staff hospitality and good service. Otherwise they would surely have got only one star.   Presentation was ok, but taste was way below average. Caprese salad cheese did not taste as fresh as it should. Pizzas tasted way below average. Borders weren't crunchy, but really doughy. Desserts were way too sweet. None of the Desserts were finished, and that's never a good sign.   I end this review stating that restaurant owners should revisit the formula of the restaurants one in a while. Maybe this pizza place was once a decent Italian restaurant. It is definitely not the case anymore."}
{"text":"My new favorite pizza place! Pomo is going to rank high on my personal list! The ambiance, service and don't forget about the food, was all amazing. I came here for lunch so next will be out on the town for dinner and boy I can't wait. The pizza, oh the pizza, is just delectable. The mixed trio bruschetta appetizer is also just splendid! Ending the meal with a cappuccino felt like I was in a small town in Italy. Way to go Pomo!  I have nothing but great things to say about this place and cannot wait to return! Whose in?! Ciao!"}
{"text":"Was staying at the Westin in downtown and the staff had recommended Pomo Pizzeria. Decided to give it a try and it was really good. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Ordered the margherita pizza and strozzapreti pasta (hope I spelled that correctly) you could tell all of their ingredients are fresh and really good quality"}
{"text":"*NOTE TO WARY FOODIES : GREAT PIZZA COMES WITH  A PRICE* Sometimes you just need a good slice (...or eight).   Slowrise sourdough crust cooked in a wood burning oven (\"This gives the pizza a soft and digestible crust\", says the menu...thank goodness, it's digestible!).  We decided to order one \"Classica\" (thin crust) and one Focaccia (yummy puffy focaccia crust!): Classica Contadina (Red Bell Pepper * Onions * Gaeta Olive * Artichoke * Mushroom $14) Focaccia Carbonara (Fior di Latte * Eggs * Pancetta (Bacon) * Onion * Panna * Pecorino Romano $15).  Trying to stick to my Veg-kick, I requested that the chef remove the Pancetta from half of 'za.  The waitress confirmed that this request was fine, but the Pancetta + onion were mixed together...leaving me with a pretty bare pizza.  \"Could I have sliced tomato +olives instead of the onion+Pancetta?\" - \"Sure!\" - \"Excellent!\"  When the 12-inchers arrived - piping hot and smelling like discs of heaven - We dug RIGHT in.  Let me tell you - - - some of the BEST pizza I've had; that Carbonara was right up my crooked alley.  Eggs on a pizza, sprinkled with freshly grated Peccorino, prepare for flavor explosion.  SO good, in fact, thaaaaattttt maybe (just perhaps) I umm....are one square foot of the stuff. *belch*  NOTE: *one* of the olives had a pit which I almost cracked my tooth on...  As the evening waned on, we sat back and relaxed and just enjoyed the conversation.  After about 20 minutes, the owner delivered crispy dough pieces dusted with powdered sugar (then slipped away without a word).  These were delicious, and I cannot believe that I could consume more food!  More time, more conversation, and the owner returned again, this time delivering two chilled shot glasses which he topped off with Crema di Limoncello!!  He bowed slightly, and whispered \"Salute\" (then slipped away).   We were left to enjoy our crisps and 'cello under the evening protection of heat lamps - - - it was pretty great!  *IF YOU ENJOY DRIFTING IN THE REALM OF THE BLISSFULLY UNINFORMED FOODIE, YOU MAY WANT TO STOP READING NOW....*  Because this is here's where it got hairy...  The check stated \"1/2 Roma Tomatoes $3\" and \"Open FOOD $3\" (I've added an image of this).  When our waitress returned for payment.  I asked her, \"What is this charge for 'Open FOOD $3'?\" - she shook her head, took the check, and returned back to her manager to ask.  Moments later, we were visited by the GM.  \"I'm so sorry, but my hands are tied!\"  He was charming, and kind, and seemed like the kind of person whom  would be really fun to grab a drink with! ....but he essentially said that he wouldn't void the charge, because then *he'd* be in hot water (not really a \"good\" reason to deny this request).  This meant that our $15 12\" pizza was really a **$21** 12\" pizza...just because I'm a vegetarian who didn't want Pancetta and was not informed that the addition of sliced tomato & olives would result in a RIDICULOUS markup...  INSANELY good pizza.....but, sheesh...what a womper."}
{"text":"Not impressed, just the basic soggy pizza and flavorless cannolis many many Downtown Phoenix Woodfired pizza places. When I order pizza that supposed to contain basil, I expect more than one leaf on the entire Pizza. Mushroom soup was excellent, and I wish I would have just had two bowls of that and not bothered with the pizza.  Someone else that my table had the panna cotta, and that wasn't very flavorful either, Although the strawberry topping was delicious. Would not eat here again. Try Cibo or Pane Bianco instead."}
{"text":"Always amazing food. I've been to the location in Scottsdale too. Friendly staff at both!!! The vibe in Phoenix is always just more laid back and casual, which I prefer. Authentic neopolitan style pizza."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful Father's Day dinner here.  The pizza was amazing, the crust was perfection. We really enjoyed the staff as well.  Everyone was friendly in a natural and genuine way."}
{"text":"Stars are made of many corners, with fewer corners there will be fiewer stars. The point? Don't cut corners.  The first cut corner was the bread, in previous visits it was a great, fresh inhosue bread. This time the bread was stale, and looked like stanrd slices from a bag, which we were also charged an extra $1.50 for since we were nnot told one came with our salad.  The next cut corner was the mango salad, the mangoes had that freezer taste and were a bit mushy. I understand some ingredients are seasonal so maybe the menu should adjust.  The pizza, is the shining star as it should be. The margarita pizza, with the amazing sauce that is not sweet, thin and crisp crust and melted but not overpowering mozzarella was great. The real lesson, come for the pizza not the other stuff."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place last Sunday night as an out of towner. That can I say, pizza was great. The service was great. Sat at the bar, the gentleman with the long pony tail took care of me. Can't remember the name of this pizza but it had prosciutto and arugula. Tasted Amazing. I have two more work visits to Phoenix and will definitely stop by."}
{"text":"Sunday afternoon with more than half the restaurant open, but would not accommodate 4 adults and two kids. Gave me some line about blocking the walkway, that's cool, if you don't want kids, just put a sign on the door, don't lie about not moving tables, especially when I've been in the building before when you gladly moved tables for a group with no kids."}
{"text":"Sooooo good!  I lived in Italy for a year, and this is pizza the way I remember it.  Fresh ingredients, chewy crust, yummy tomato sauce, not dripping in too much cheese or grease like American style.  Hubby got the Pomo while I got the Principe - ended up eating half each.  Plenty to take home and enjoy tomorrow.  We sat at the pizza bar, so we could watch the cooks.  Our server was attentive and friendly.  The head chef was kind enough to give us a couple shots of limoncello after dinner.  We'll for sure be back."}
{"text":"Came here last night for a birthday dinner. Had amazing service, super attentive and the food was really delicious! Great experience!"}
{"text":"Oh, Pomo!!! Just when I thought I was certain where the best pizza in Phoenix is, Pomo comes along and blows it all out of the water. This place makes me feel like I'm in Italy! I've never been, but I would bet that the experience here is 99% close. We came in with a 30-40 min wait around 8pm on a Friday night  (justifying their popularity) but opted for the bar to be seated right away. And so glad we did because our bartender, David was fantastic. He made us feel right at home. We started with the bruschetta and it seemed to come out as soon as we ordered it! Per our bartender's recommendation, we tried the Principa pizza (prosciutto, arugula wonderful tomato and cheese blend) and it was perfection from toppings to crust. We had already had a small meal at a food truck beforehand and didn't expect to finish but we killed it. After paying, we were surprised by the complimentary fried dough/powdered sugar dessert. It was a simple yet satisfying ending to a wonderful meal. I cannot wait to go here again!! Congrats to Glendale & Gilbert for soon getting their own Pomo!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, dine in, but WATCH OUT when you get food to go. Six of us recently dined at Pomo and  it was instantly obvious the food was handcrafted, the pasta was one of a kind, and the meat lasagna was the best I have ever had. It hurts me to give it four stars, but there is one oddity. Order the same meal to go and you will be charged unreasonably for items which were previously brought to your table for free. Bread - $$$. Shaved Parmesan cheese - $$$. Sometimes it's the little things that can impact your dining experience, but I would not want this review to keep you from eating there - delicious, fresh, and fantastic."}
{"text":"Perfect Thursday night dinner at this awesome pizzeria. Started off with sitting outside on a cool April evening. Draft ale and glass of red wine. We tried the mango salad and a Don Alfonso pizza. Both were great. The pizza's sausage was the star as well as the pizza sauce. The crust was soft with just the right amount of crunch. We followed this up with panna cotta which as a non-dessert person was also great. The crunchy pie crust with powder was exceptional and they gave us extra.  Lastly,  The owner/manager greeted us with a shot each of limonchello and it was terrific.  Couldn't ask for more. Great night. Great dinner."}
{"text":"Love Pomo! Best pizza in town. Great atmosphere. Friendly staff. Reasonable prices. Ample seating and parking."}
{"text":"There is no words that can describe just how delicious the pizza was! I was blown away by the abundance of flavors, my tummy was content and my taste buds loved me!   We started off with a bruschetta. Simple bruschetta, nothing fancy, still tasty. My boyfriend ordered the Toto Sapore. Packed with lots of different meats, sausage, prosciutto, pancetta, and salame! Perfect choice for meat lovers. I opted for the Peppino which included ricotta cheese and salame. The crust was perfect! The tomato sauce really made the whole pizza to be honest. Not too thick and a good amount to still enjoy the rest of the ingredients. You MUST, MUST, MUST try your pizza with the chili infused olive oil. It's amazing! I wanted to take it home and use it for every meal.   Lastly, the desserts. My, oh my...those desserts. The owner was kind enough to bring us a dessert on the house which was fried pieces of dough sprinkled with confectioners sugar. He also poured us a shot of something with cinnamon, sooooo tasty! Very strong, but the flavor was delicious. We went ahead and each ordered a dessert. My boyfriend got the Tiramisu and I got the Semifredo Alle Mandorle. My dessert was a traditional Italian dessert light mousse filled with figs and topped with amaretto cookies. That description alone just sounds mouth watering, no detail on the amazingness of that dessert needed!   I'm excited to have found my new favorite pizza spot! I will return soon for the sandwiches! :)"}
{"text":"Very dope restaurant. This pizza was absolutely amazing. I got the margherita and it was pretty life changing. I also had the romana salad and it might be the best salad I ever ate. The cheese and croutons are so fresh.  I loved the italian sodas.   The mallofogie(sp) was probably the best dessert I ever had.  The staff was very friendly and provided great service and recommendations.  Everything about this place oozes authenticity, from all of the italian the staff was speakign to the little scooters out front to the compliementary powdered dough with sugar and limoncellos after the meal.  If this isn't the best pizza in AZ, its right behind pizzicletta.. but it is definitely above Cibo and Bianco in my books."}
{"text":"While in Phoenix make a trip to Pomo! I came to Pomo while spending a night in town for work.  I sat at the bar and conveniently found out that on Tuesday nights they do half price bottles of wine.  Of course I went with one - the Super Tuscan.  I hope the next time I'm back it is a Tuesday.  On to food - I went with the Principe pizza on David the bartender's suggestion.  Great choice.  The pizza is absolutely fantastic and I am a tough judge since we have excellent pizza in NY.  They use fresh, imported ingredients.  The oven and most of the ingredients are straight from Italy.  I also got the Mista salad which is huge and very fresh. At the end of my meal the owner handed some delicious homemade limoncello - some of the best I've had.  Also got a taste of dessert.  Overall great food and atmosphere.  I'll be back when I'm back in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Genuine stuff with so many unique options. Love they offer calzone.  Spicy olive oil a hit. Good for business or pleasure."}
{"text":"I was a roly-poly ball of hunger fueled mania when I came here this evening, so I'm not sure if that's what's talking here or not -- all I know is that I think I had one of the best dinners of the year here.  We split a pizza and the summer sausage pasta. I know there are names for these, but I will have to look them up and edit this review after I awaken from my food-coma.  The service was pretty great. The waitress at first was quite slow to take our order, but the owner seemed to have noticed this and immediately stepped in to take care of us. After this, service was attentive and friendly -- we wanted for not a thing."}
{"text":"Met some friends for dinner on Saturday night.  Was great!  Food was terrific, service was casual (fitting for the atmosphere) and fun.  Staff was responsive to all our needs.  Had 3 pizzas (all great).  Beer (waitress brought me 2 samples to help me choose) and wine.  All a+."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, atmosphere, and staff. We had amazing service through our entire visit and the food and drinks were wonderful. A great place to visit for date night before heading over to FilmBar to catch a flick."}
{"text":"Dear Lord, will you please put a Pomo in downtown Seattle? We stopped here last Sunday, was our last meal before leaving Phoenix and man am I glad it was this place.  The service was impeccable, the food and craft cocktails were mouth watering (had the lasagna & a pizza) and brag worthy.  Then at the end they brought us a wonderfully crafted shot of Lemoncello which was so delicate and a perfect way to end the evening.  This place was tip top!"}
{"text":"Best dough, cheese, meats outside of Naples, Italy.  This is by FAR the most authentic Neapolitan pizza in the Valley.  When I take my last breath I want it to be chewing on their pizza dough."}
{"text":"I think it is good, but not quite the hype. Also, service seems to be OK.  When you are in a trendy, down town environment, you need to stand out.  Pomo fades into the crowd for me.  Good but not great.  I would eat here again, but I may not go out of the way to find it.  Could have just been an off day."}
{"text":"Big pizza fan here so whenever I go out of town, I always look for a good pizza spot.   What separates a good pie from a great pie comes down to the sauce imho. The sauce was on point and the crust was crispy.  I also had some brushetta which I loved.  The only small deduction would be the person who put the toppings on the pizza. It was thrown on haphazardly with 1/2 the pizza having all the meat and the other half having veggies. Some slices seemed to be vegetarian and others triple meat. Didn't make for a great presentation. Still good food though."}
{"text":"Oh my word.  This pizza takes me back to Italy.  We've searched high and low over the states for authentic Italian pizza and we finally found it with Pomo.  Especially in a city that is a pizza lover's paradise...we LOVE Pomo!  We've eaten at both locations and prefer the quaintness of the downtown location.  It too takes me back to Italy.  And the owners speak Italian which makes the whole experience very fun with the word 'prego' being thrown around quite a bit.  Makes me smile.  This is my kid's favorite place as well (ages 2, 5 and 7)."}
{"text":"This is a cute little Italian joint. My friend and I went at 645 and it was busy but we barely had to wait 10 minutes and they suggested that we stop in at the turf for a drunk first(the bar next door). It was nice in there but a lot of green lighting, which doesn't really make anyone look good. We got our table and sat outside. The service was quick but not very careful. At first when our pizza came out, there were no plates, napkins or the toppings they are supposed to bring  with it. We asked for those things and the napkins didn't show up until we were almost finished.  The pizza was delicious, we got the one that starts with an a, I don't recall the exact name. I would defiantly eat here again.   One other thing was we both ordered a glass of the White House wine and it tasted like what I imagine pee tastes like. It was pretty gross, I'd suggest you splurge a little and go for a more expensive wine, you will probably have better luck."}
{"text":"Ate at Pomo last night for the first time and was thoroughly impressed! The Margherita Pizza was out of this world! I lived in Italy for awhile and have to say this was the closest I've had since my return. When compared to true Italian pizza, this was far closer and better than even Pizzeria Bianco. The service was good too. I will most definitely be back...very soon!!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE, horrible, horrible service! I visited on Saturday 5/16 at 6 pm. Hostess says we've got a 30 min wait, we'll call you. After 45 mins later and no call our group of 4 returned to check in. Hostess says \"hey we phoned you.\" I call BS as my mobile has phone history and tracks calls, and there was no calls for 2 hrs. She says my list and notes say we phoned. \"I say the technology says otherwise. You're either calling me a liar or there's a mistake\" She didn't even try to place us elsewhere. We requested to speak with the manager. She refused to call the manager over. Saying one was no one on duty. Wow! Then she ignored us at the reception podium for another 5 mins to wait us out. We gave up when no more action was happening from the service side of Pomo. There's too many good pizza joints in downtown Phoenix to put up with this. Pomo will see us No Mo!"}
{"text":"The foot was great! I don't remember what it was called but I had their version of a meat lovers pizza and my date had the margarita pizza. We both ate the entire pizza because even after you're full, you just can't stop eating because it is so good. After our meal, our waiter brought out complimentary dessert and they gave us shots. I couldn't hear what he said the drink was but it was thick and sweet but that was a nice touch to close out the experience. I just found out there is one in Gilbert which makes me very excited so I can have this place more often!"}
{"text":"This place was fantastic. The only reason I didn't give it 5 Stars is because I didn't try everything on the menu! (but I would've liked to) I was in Phoenix for work, and found this place after arriving at the airport. Very friendly staff! Looking for the next reason to come back here!"}
{"text":"I am very picky with my pizza, and this place has the best pizza by far!! It is thin, Neapolitan style pizza - so although a whole pizza to yourself may seem like a ton of food, it is actually not heavy or overly filling. Or, a nice lunch would be to split a salad and a pizza between a few people. The ingredients are authentic and Italian, and I love that the menu describes the items using italian words. It just ups the authenticity and makes it fun to try new things. I went there with my family of 6 and our food came out very quickly. Our server was great at answering our questions and was very good at prebussing (clearing the table of unnecessary plates, cups, flatware). She also made a point of just giving us time hang out and enjoy our company while not rushing to hand us the bill. The owner?/manager? came over and gave us free sangrias during the meal, and dessert/after dinner drinks on the house!  The hospitality here was truly amazing. I've worked in the restaurant industry for over 8 years now, and it is very obvious that the staff here is trained well and enjoys their work. Put that together with the amazing food and Pomo is the place to go!!"}
{"text":"Go here as soon as you land in Phoenix! The Pizza tastes like its right off the streets in Italy and it should because the owner seems to be right off the streets of Italy. The complimentary Limoncello tastes like chilled cake icing in a cup! The Peroni was ice cold. The bruschetta was so fresh! I had the Diavola pizza. I soaked it in their chili infused olive oil. I'm telling you it was the best pizza I've had west of the Atlantic!"}
{"text":"There's a reason why the Neapolitans are the godfathers of pizza; come to Pomo and discover why."}
{"text":"Delicious wine. Divine pizza. Depictions of Italian street life on wall murals. And a surprise treat at the end of the meal. This place offered up a great dinner experience a deux for hubby and I.  The Margherita pizza was simple...and simply delicious. We shared one pie and a salad, and then a slice of the Hazelnut Torte cake. Yummmm. The waitress was knowledgeable about the wine list and suggested two reds that we also really liked.  After our meal, the chef brought us a special (and unexpected) treat...homemade limoncello shots and powdered sugar-coated crispy dessert bites.  After a meal like this, the only thing I was left craving was a spin on a Vespa!"}
{"text":"Went with a group of five this evening and we were very disappointed!  one of the guy was very nice to turn the second heat on when we were sitting outside. I asked for a second coke bc the 1st one had been sitting out for long time i think, there was no bubble and tasteless. Our main waiter was nice doing it without question asked. However, seriously, my coke was still almost the same.  Took a long time for the food ready, and almost everything was very salty which all of us even my niece 10 years old agreed with. We had the bread brought out after our main food. Its ridiculous. Isn't that necessary or matter anymore.  I feel bad to tell all of these things here instead of confronting straight to our waiter. It would be pointless i think and too many things to say.  After all, we were wondering how this place got 4.5 stars with great pictures of food. We shouldnot trust yelp anymore.  The chicken salad looked so great in the picture but its dry and weird. We spent $100 for bad food and ending up we went home find something better to eat.  I felt so bad bc i am the one who chose this location for my friends, they weren't happy at all. We were just unfortunate maybe!"}
{"text":"My AAU  basketball girls were basically \"Shooshed\" by the waiter Stan, before we even got situated in the already loud restaurant. Then, Stan complained because we needed 4 separate checks for 14 people. Lastly, he called out drink-types 1 by 1 and told everyone to \"raise your hand\" instead of addressing each diner individually. I asked him if perhaps another waiter, more accustomed  to dealing with large groups would be better.  Of course he is still severing us, so the end result will remain to be seen.  So far, 10mins later and we are just now getting drinks, which he can not remember who-ordered-what & we are missing one drink. Stan has apologized for the \"misunderstanding,\" which we have accepted. I believe you can do better Stan & Pomo.  Part2 to come........Spoke w/manager (Fransisco?) who was very understanding and open to constructive criticism. Admitted to Stan being a new employee and needing more staff. In the end, the Pizza was good."}
{"text":"The pizza is the best we have eaten. There was no wait. We got our food in 10min. Great friendly service. Enjoyed!"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic and the staff is super friendly. You can tell the panini bread and pizza dough are actually made in house."}
{"text":"What a disappointment! My boyfriend and I visited because we are new to Phoenix, live downtown and this place had excellent reviews. It is WAY overrated.   I was handed a dirty, torn menu right off the bat (it even had summer specials even though it was fall). That is enough indication of the amount of care put into a restaurant. We then had to ask for a waitress when no one attended us in a reasonable amount of time. When she came by, she was not in the least bit welcoming. We ordered drinks hoping it was just a fluke. Nope...the poor attitude continued when our orders arrive and we were asked what we wanted to order. We decided against eating here, paid for our drinks and headed to the Chamber's next door - where we had an amazing time. Pomo's was such a waste of time."}
{"text":"Had communication from Pomo to clear up a misunderstanding on the part of the host who took my call. Would try them again... :)"}
{"text":"Service: Our first experience, without going into detail, started off VERY rough. The owner was notified and he more than compensated us. I have never experienced any company going so out of their way to correct a huge mistake. No one is perfect, mistakes happen, but it's how those mistakes are handled that counts. We went back the next weekend.   Food: Best Neapolitan pizza in the valley. The real deal tomatoes. We used to drive all the way to downtown Glendale to go to another famous pizza place (the only other one in the valley area with certified tomatoes besides this one) and this place blows them out of the water. Fresh, delicious. Get the margherita. Tiramisu was fantastic and I don't even like deserts."}
{"text":"When I travel I look for authentic Neapolitan pizza since my hometown has none. This place did not disappoint! I was dining with three men. I was the only one to finish my entire pizza, crusts and all! They even have several Italian beers, including my fave: Peroni! Bravo Pomo!"}
{"text":"We stop in at least once when we come to Phoenix. The ambience is cool. Food is always good."}
{"text":"I went here and had a Toto Sapore. Amazing! I've been going to this place even more now - great service!"}
{"text":"Fresh food is to word here. Friendly staff. The Caprese is a great way to start. Then an awesome Pizza."}
{"text":"Wow, definitely some of the best pizza in the valley! Tuesdays are 1/2 priced bottles of wine. Make sure to try the traditional pizzas!"}
{"text":"Can't say enough good about this place. Came upon it on a two day trip and ended up there twice in two days. Best pizza I've ever eaten. Personally I think it had a lot to do with the sauce and crust. Also the mulo was a great drink they made my wife ordered both nights. The service was phenomenal. I didn't get the name of the gentleman at the bar who served us the second night but he was a great guy. Complimentary shots of lemoncello. Even though we came in just before close he made sure to let us know there was no rush and to enjoy ourselves.   In my opinion this is a must visit for anyone visiting Phoenix."}
{"text":"I haven't even finished eating and I have to give them a 5 stars! Me being Italian definitely makes my review bias but damn: they got it! The romana salad was nice and simple but yet delightful, Bufala pizza was to die for and Tiramisu was as good as mine! Good job guys!"}
{"text":"Loved the interior. it was clean and inviting (a big plus was the nice booth seating options). I dug the street scene mural as well. Pomo also has a cute bar,  and equally cute \" al fresco\" dining area . They use really select fresh imported ingredients,  and cook the pizza in one helluva oven (950 degrees). The meat and cheese plate paired with some great olives was delicious as was my mushroom soup.  Our table ordered 2 pies (sausage,mushroom,onion,peppers)(zucchini,peppers,¬≠egplant)  The pizza was simply outstanding, i allowed myself a slice ..and it was a slice of heaven Grilled zucchini,roasted red peppers ,eggplant. The presentation, aroma,  and taste was wonderful, the crust perfect !....This is PIZZA ..Italian pizza ! We all really enjoyed this pizza and cannot wait to try more from the menu.  A nod to the pastry chef ..for the fabu chocolate molten cake ( with gelato) Cannoli, and fig custard ..oh and the amaretto cookies .  Service was terrific! solid menu!  pure authentic ingredients,  and certified napoletana pizza = 5 solid stars!"}
{"text":"Oh my my! You must eat here! I have been in Phoenix 18 months and this is my first \"must\" review. My advice is share the salad, share the pizza, but eat the whole dessert yourself! Authentic food, great service, excellent experience."}
{"text":"This review is long overdue. I found out about Pomo pizzeria a few years ago and it is literally the best pizza I have ever had....and I've had a lot of pizza. I have been to this location as well as the Gilbert location and both have been great experiences. My favorite pizza is the Toto Sapore and I also love the Peppino. I have also tried the lasagna and another pasta dish and both of them were incredibly fresh and tasty. One of the best parts about this restaurant is the ambiance and the owner. The shot of homemade limoncello at the end is seriously the best way to end the meal. I don't think I will ever be able to find a better pizzeria than Pomo."}
{"text":"This is one of these fine dining restaurants that located at the downtown area. Also a fine place to go for weekend leisure. If you are craving for quality Italian food this is the place to go. The server came couple times to check on everything and even helped us box our left over."}
{"text":"Went here for 6p, light dinner on a Saturday: Had just the margherita pizza - really fabulous! Hubs usually doesn't like thin crust, but he really liked the crust, and all the ingredients were balanced.  One star taken away: really should be 5 stars, but perhaps our waiter was new? Maybe it was his first job? We still had 3 pieces left of our pizza to finish and he asked \"so are we thinking of getting dessert?\" It was premature to ask and hubs and I looked at each other quizzically. We said \"no thank you.\" I added \"we're still working on the pieces we have.\"   Then there was 1 more piece of pizza left and he asked \"anything else I can get you?\" It was kind of him to ask. We said no thanks and he gave us the check right away. Felt like he was rushing to get us out...however there were about 5 tables occupied inside at the time and lots of other empty tables. By the time the pizza got to our table, and by the time we got up to leave, it was 20-25 mins.   Net-net, I felt rushed. I didn't take offense and maybe he was new to his job. But please don't rush customers about dessert when they aren't done with their main meal.   Extras: they provided a lightly peppered olive oil, parmesan, chili flakes and Italian seasoning on the side. This was definitely the piece that stood out!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I attended Pomo's last month and we were extremely happy with the service and the food.   We were really shocked on how fast the service is!  I read the reviews on here and can understand some negative ones but those people are idiots for what you get. This isn't a $50 a plate restaurant! So those people who are looking for perfection from a very affordable restaurant are \"smoking\" stuff!   My girl had the pizza which was really good, and I had the lasagna which was above average. I did love the complementary lemoncello shot, and the dessert.  The only negative was that the young waitress (very good-looking so I will overlook) brought out our plates one at a time and said some lame excuse that she didn't know we wanted them together. What? So we are going to eat separately? Obviously, there was a mixup but I'm prone to those so I'm not going to hold it over her because she was young and easy on the eyes. :)"}
{"text":"Really great place, love the fact the the owner/chef came up to us and chatted with us a bit, gave us a shot of his MOST AMAZING made from scratch Limoncelo, definitely the best we ever had.  The dessert was delicious and same with the pizza.  But still nothing beats Cibo's Pizza for us, still by far the best we ever had, including New York, San Fran and anywhere in town."}
{"text":"This place is so delicious!! Matteo is an amazing owner!"}
{"text":"We love it here! Pizza is amazing and the owner is amazing! We feel like we almost know him every time we come in! He's always so happy and greets you like friends:) we love trying all the pizzas and every single one has been amazing! Big wine list, fun drink list! This place is a go-to! :)"}
{"text":"Had a tough day and I wanted to treat myself to a nice dinner. I drove to the downtown location, rather than the Glendale location, based on the reviews I read here. Big mistake. First, you have to pay for parking downtown. Even on the weekends and evenings. Second, even though the restaurant was mostly empty, they had no less than 6 employees on staff, each given a specific task. The person that greets you, seats you and gives you menu's. The busboy brings you water. The waitress takes your drink order and comes back with the drinks and then left us far too long before coming back to take our dinner order. The folks behind the counter seem to pour the drinks and make the food.  Our food was delivered to our table by the folks behind the counter. The waitress seems to have it pretty easy here compared to the typical duties of a waitress at just about any other restaurant, which is why it's hard for me to understand why we were never visited again by our waitress during our meal. She was too busy chatting it up with a couple seated at the bar. I glanced her way and stared several times, hoping to get her attention because my drink was empty and I'm basically choking down dry bread. My meal has to stop until I can get something to wash my food down with. I give up, I get up with my empty drink and I take it to the counter. The man behind the counter knows what I was drinking and offers to refill it and bring it back out to me.  Suddenly, lo-and-behold, our waitress appears. Why our waitress was so inattentive and couldn't take a 2 minute break from her conversation to check on her table (and then she could go back to her conversation) is beyond mind boggling to me.  Now, let's talk about the food. I ordered the Romana salad, which was way over-priced for what you get at $9.95. It's basically some lettuce, crutons and salad dressing. Not much to making it, not much to it at all.  I also ordered the Regina Margherita pizza ($12.95) and my drink, a Coke, at $2.50. These are not cheap prices and the level of service should be equal.  There were flies buzzing all around our table, so I wish I would have sat outside.   The pizza was good, but the tomato sauce was a bit too 'sharp' for my taste.   There is another, similar restaurant called La Piazza Al Forno. They also have locations in downtown Phoenix and Glendale. They are also VPN certified, and I think the menu has more variety, cheaper prices, and, in my experience, much better service.  The excuse offered to me regarding my waitresses inattentiveness was that she was quitting her job in a couple of days and was saying goodbye to some regular customers. Again, she didn't have to stop talking to them, she just needed to excuse herself for two minutes to check on other customers. Its unlikely I'll become a regular customer, in part, because the waitress left me feeling alienated, or less important.  The total was $25.40 with $2.11 tax for a grand total of $27.51. A 10% tip on the pretax total would have been $2.54. If I was taken care of, I would have left $6, but since I got irritated for being ignored, I left her $3.00, which considering the circumstances, I thought was generous of me.  Everyone has a limited job to do. The cooks did a good job. The greeter did a good job. The busboy did a good job. I'd go so far to say this restaurant doesn't need waitresses. She was the only one who screwed up, and all she had to do was check in on us from time to time. I think the folks behind the bar could have easily done her job and she would be free to talk to her friends all day, every day. The customer would be taken care of and everyone would be happy. its a win-win-win situation. I cannot emphasize enough how easy the wait-staff has it at this location.  As for any after dinner treats delivered to your table after the meal (again, based on reviews I read here), I didn't get that. I got a bill. The waitress was fast to deliver the bill and to check back to collect the bill and deliver the receipt. Noted.  I found the food here to be good but over-priced and La Piazza Al Forno to offer similar food, that I think tastes better, at a cheaper price and with much better service."}
{"text":"I love it here. The portions are perfect and the drinks are splendid! The staff is friendly and welcoming always. The location is very cool but it is a little small. Great place to eat pizza on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Very good overall. Ordered the mushroom soup and bruschetta. Soup was outstanding,  bruschetta was quite bland and disappointing unfortunately. Their style of pizza is outstanding and the combination of ingredients and the freshness of the taste is wonderful. Service was quite well also: recommended!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and exceptionally fast service. We barely had gotten our order placed before it was on the table. The tiramisu was excellent as well."}
{"text":"The pizza here is phenomenal.  The best margherita pizza in Phoenix.  I came in on a lunch break during the week and sat at the bar.  I'm not exaggerating when I say I sat there for over 10 minutes before anyone approached me.  I was quite disconsolate when I walked in and didn't feel like talking to anyone so I felt content to just sit there and watch the female (only) staff of servers walk back and forth in front of me- trying not to make eye contact because then they'd have to take my order.  As I watched them interact together, I realized that none of them liked each other.  In fact, it was like watching a commercial for the Bad Girls reality TV show but this was more entertaining.  Finally, a chef approached the bar to make himself a drink of water, feeling rather thirsty I said \"hey, do you mind if I get one of those, too?\"  He was more than happy to make me one and asked me what I would like to eat and I told him I wanted a margherita pizza.  Within literally minutes my hot and fresh pizza was out.  The Chefs name was Mateo and he was freaking awesome. The owner also came by and made sure I had everything I needed including a nice tall Peroni to go with my delicious pie.  I can't wait to come back in and get served by the guys while I watch the waitresses claw each others eyes out.  Dinner and a show."}
{"text":"Their pizza is alright. I still think Spinato's pizza is the best! But their location is amazing because it's near Downtown, Phoenix."}
{"text":"Tried both the margherita pizza and the roma salad... both were just absolute perfection.  I can't imagine a world where the flavors or ingredients for either are better.    It was a breezy fall's eve, so sitting outside was the right choice.  Service was great, drinks were cold - and after finishing off the 'za and salad, the chef came out with a taste of his special homemade limoncello.  That's what he called it at least, 'cept it was in an Everclear bottle.    Apparently more than a shot of it could cause liver-failure and diabetes at the same time - 'cause it was deliciously sweet, and thick enough that it coats your throat like lemon flavored cough syrup.    It was a nice touch, and the chef, despite not knowing a ton of English, was very kind.  I will be back to try other dishes, I can't see making a bad choice at this establishment."}
{"text":"Went to Pomo last night with my partner and a friend. We were not impressed.  Pollo salad-chicken was under seasoned and dry. The bread served with it was also dry and didn't taste good.  Margarita pizza-the sauce had no flavor. The basil was cooked-this is a big no no to me.  Pr√≠ncipe pizza-too much olive oil and too much Parmesan cheese. Too salty. I've had this pizza before at another restaurant and the salt should be balanced.   Our server never came back to ask how any of our food was. I had to flag him down for drink refills. Keep in mind that there were only 5 tables seated while we were there and there was plenty of staff in the restaurant. At the end of the meal when he noticed there were only two pieces of the Pr√≠ncipe pizza eaten and we declined a box he ask is something was wrong. At this time I told him the problems we had with the pizza that I've described here, he removed the pizza and boxed it up-I'm assuming to save for himself, which I don't have a problem with-but still charged me for it.   I wouldn't say the food is bad, but it is not worth the price. Go to Fired Pie and save some money, or if you want a pizza that is truly worth $17 then go to Pizzeria Bianco."}
{"text":"Seriously fantastic pizza. TON of fun just looking at this menu, and watching all the variety be served. Really enjoyed going here. Only went a few times yet enjoyed it very much every time!"}
{"text":"Gem!!! What a fantastic little restaurant. Exceptional food and even better service.  You can feel the fresh ingredients and the pizza cooks right in front of you.  The owner comes out and pours a desert liquor. This is a piece of Italy in American Southwest.  Dont miss."}
{"text":"Authentic pizza and pastas! Pasta cooked al dente! Service was welcoming, prompt, friendly and accommodating. Our sweet waitress went on & beyond and even modified one of pasta dishes despite it says on the menu \"no add ons\". I ordered a mista salad and it was drenched in dressing- I am recommending having dressing on the side.  Beer on tap & water glasses were never empty! I loved that I could see the wood burning pizza over from my table! Everyone who was over 21 got a super yummy shot of lemoncello- ON THE HOUSE after dinner. The ambiance was cozy. I would recommend making reservation since there were not that many tables. Salute!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is definitely good. It's a little pricey but worth a try. I do enjoy brick oven pizza and the atnosphere is pretty neat (dare I say \"romantic\"?) I may return sometime with the wife."}
{"text":"My sister and I went here for lunch today. I wanted to see if the pizza really tasted like I remember from Naples, and they have $2 bottled beer on Sundays! We both had the Italian lager, split a mista salad and ordered the traditional Bufala pizza. The salad came out first, and was huge! The greens were fresh, the grape tomatoes flavorful and the shaved parmesan was very good. The chef brings out a small bottle of aged balsamic for the dressing. Next came the pizza, which was piping hot, and topped with melting bufala mozzarella. It was delicious, just as I remembered. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Italian/Brick oven Pizza in Phoenix. And you pay a premium for it.  The salads are fresh and tasty, the pizza is full of flavor, yet not heavy or greasy.  Wait time on busy weekends can take a bit, but the bar with outdoor seating is a great place to wait.  Everyone I've encountered is always friendly and helpful.  I like the nice touch of the fried dough sticks with powder sugar at the end of the meal.  Once in a while, you get offered a complimentary shot which is an added bonus if you drink."}
{"text":"Great environment, very good service and good food. We are started off with a meat and cheese board that was great. All the components were very flavorful and I highly recommend it. For the meal we knocked out the peppino pizza. If your looking for a pizza with fresh ingredients, this is the spot. Personally, I could go with more cheese and sauce but that's just how I like it and not knocking it. For dessert, the tiramisu was yummy and recommended. Overall, a quality time out."}
{"text":"From beginning to end everything was amazing. The bruchetta was so simple but tasted delicious. The pizza tasted amazing. Flavor was really good.  But i love anything with arugula. Could not eat the whole pizza def enough for 2. The cannolis were simple tasted good nothing special. The owner however gave us a shot of something with lemon and it was thick and creamy. Tasted like lemon cluster with some alcohol. Service was super friendly."}
{"text":"Mio Dio, this review is LONG overdue. I am so lucky that these guys are so close. This is one of the places I like to go when I am missing Europe. These charming little spot oozes Neapolitan charm from the atmosphere to the mouthwatering pizza, salads and pasta.  These guys are definite top contenders for best pizza joint in The Valley in my opinion. Don't get me wrong: I LOVE Bianco, The Parlor and my beloved Bocce up in Cottonwood, but there is something about this place that really stands out for me and I think it is the European atmosphere.  Lisa E. dragged me in here one weekend and I am eternally indebted to her for that. The first thing I noticed it that I heard a LOT of Italian being spoken-ALWAYS a good sign!  I had the Pomo, what can I say, I'm simple and predictable. It was like having fresh meat and veggies, fresh cheese and savory sauce on a fresh baked crust sent from heaven. I'm not a pizza guy, I will NEVER suggest going out for pizza but these guys are an exception. Their pizza is not too heavy which is how a lot of pizza places utterly fail and the freshness and quality of ingredients is what really sets Pomo apart.   I've also had the lasagne bolognese. Again, I'm not a huge fan of lasagne again because it is often so damned rich and heavy. Pomo pulls it off brilliantly AND they give you so much that you have lunch for tomorrow!  They have amazing salads which are huge and full of lush, fresh veggies and their bruschetta is to die for.  Lastly, their coffee kicks ass. This is what really takes me back to Europe: amazing, AUTHENTIC Italian Espresso. I WISH these guys were open in the morning because I would come here for coffee EVERY DAY!  The space is great: they have an awesome little bar and a patio for the months when it's nice outdoors and some counter seating where you can watch your meal being prepared.  If you haven't been here, put Pomo on your 2015 list to check out. If you're from out of town, these guys are not to be missed!"}
{"text":"Was just visiting Phoenix area for a few days. I happened to google and find this restaurant.. The website made it look awesome so I really wanted to try it -- This was the BEST decision!    The look and feel of the place was great, very friendly staff who was happy to answer all of our questions.  We started with some salads and sorrentina.. Both tasted great. The star of it all was obviously the Pizza!!  It was the best pizza (and I live in Chicago, so I know :-P hahaha! only joking) But seriously! we ordered a margherita, Toto Sapore, and Peppino!  All were delicious!    The cherry on top of our time there was when Matteo, the chef, came out personally and gave us all a shot of his homemade Limoncello! He was very nice and talked with us for a bit and even let us take a picture with him. (we were complete tourist on this trip!)  :-)    Great place, if you are in the Phoenix area and haven't made a stop by this place.. What are you waiting for?!"}
{"text":"Pomo is possibly one of the best pizza spots in Phoenix, and there are a few. Napoli would be proud of what is being served up at this quaint little place. It's a winner.  Why go there: Central Ave is full of good places to eat downtown. This place stands out because of the quality and consistency of their pizzas. They had pizzas that took me back to my childhood where this Italian man from Napoli, in Paris (no less), would crank out about 80 pies on select nights in our neighborhood, from his wood fired oven built in his obscure van.. The Pomo fam is for real.  Their pies are tossed into this stone oven, wood burning oven, possibly holding a 900 degree heat, and come out lighting fast. Their Neapolitan pizzas are truly a reminder of what Italian food tastes like in Italy. Sauces are not thick and heavy, everything is balanced and fresh. The apps and dessert card are solid with plenty to choose from but not too diverse. Service is always solid and they know their stuff.  Don't miss: Two pizzas stand out, the Diavola if you enjoy a little kick from a spicy salami. And a white pizzas with four cheeses, the Quattro Fromaggi.  They also have a killer house made gnocchi that will surely please, that's a good main dish to share actually as an appetizer actually. Hope you are humble enough to ask for a good wine pairing, because what you get here will surely elevate their offerings. Their desserts... really, almost any of them will do. We've tried them all (don't judge). Our soft spot is for the panna cotta... we'll have two please.  Tip: If you can and don't mind, try to sit at the bar where they make the pizzas, it's fascinating, the guys craft those pies with love and precision. It's refreshing, get a good front row seat if you're not looking to gaze into each other's eyes over dinner. This is gonna be equally as fun. The GM will come by after your meal for a round of limoncello on the house for the table. Not a bad way to see you off, so hang tight and save a bit of room for that last little goodie... Salute!"}
{"text":"best pizza I have had downtown or probably ever. so authentic & tasty. it's a little pricey but the service and food you get is beyond amazing. on almost every visit we have had the owner will come out & poor the table a taste of a new drink or bring us a yummy dessert for free! I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"O solo mio!  So glad we found this place on our drive through town.  Thought I'd never have pizza like this unless I went back to Italy.  So yummy!  Sat by the bar and no doubt everything is fresh!  They are shaving cheese right in front of us!  Pizza, dessert and shots of limon cello!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"DON'T ORDER TAKEOUT.  Not only will you get their extremely uneven food - really, that's what you call a Caprese salad when your lasagne and pizza is excellent?  But you have to run the gauntlet of the clueless, unsupervised phone staff plus the arrogant know-it-all servers.  Will take great pains to stay away from the place in the future."}
{"text":"We called nearly a week ahead to make a reservation for a party of 14. When we got there, they had no record of having taken our reservation, and said they could only accommodate us outside (on a cold, blustery evening). We repeated that we had made a reservation and politely asked to see the manager. While we were waiting, the hostess that had been talking to us seated a couple of parties that walked in with no reservation at all, including one larger party of 6. Then when the manager finally came over, all he wanted to do was argue with us about whether we had called the right location to make our reservation. We ended up leaving and taking our business to the restaurant next door. I don't care how good your food is, if you cannot care for your customers properly, you will not get my business. Sorry, Pomo, but you suck."}
{"text":"If this is authentic Italian pizza, put me on a jet to Italy PRONTO! Location is great, parking is metered or you pay to park in a lot. $1.20 in change got me roughly 46 minutes on the meter. Seated at the inside bar (there are 2 bars, 1 inside and 1 outside). D√©cor is nice and outdoor space is perfect for lovely weather. Service was quick and pleasant, even with a personal run through of the menu. My Margherita pizza came out in under 5 minutes and was bigger than the plate it was served on. I was told since the dough is thin it's not all that scary to eat but decided to eat half and save room for dessert. Before dessert came out, the chef brought out a mini dessert of fried dough and powered sugar. Simple yet waited for my cake. Sooo glad I did, the nutella torta was AMAZING! I didn't get a lot of nutella flavor but the hazelnuts and chocolate were divine!  Will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"I've nev er had better pizza than this, and the Mista Salad was awesome."}
{"text":"Amazing food!  My husband & I shared the Bruschetta, the romaine salad and the Pomo Pizza!  Perfect for two, with a great cozy atmosphere and attentive staff.  We will definitely come back here again on our next trip!"}
{"text":"Mmmmm!!!!!!!  Visions of the beautiful Italian countryside ambush my head at with first bite of the decadent pizza in my hand. The crispy crust made the perfect balance of a saucy masterpiece. Flowing cheese grazed my chin as I embrace this rich experience! I'm still infatuated as I eat the last bite. Sadly-(sigh). I might also mention the fabulous soup and enthusiasm of the service of Selenae, our server. Her intuitive manner satisfied our every desire and whim. Wow! We will never forget our experience at the Pomo."}
{"text":"I loved this place. The pizza was authentic and delicious. We went on a weeknight so there wasn't too many people but with this place being small, searing may be an issue when they're busy."}
{"text":"This could possibly be the best pizza I have had. I have 3 pizza places that stick out in my mind and this is one of them. It is a tough competition between here, Pizzeria Bianco and Il Bosco. The pizza is cooked to perfection and the sauce is absolutely perfect. Quality ingredients and it is extremely satisfying. The service was also great, just wish it was a little cheaper."}
{"text":"Maybe my Northeastern roots have made me a pizza snob but I wasn't too impressed.  I realize that the pizza is VPN certified and that it has such fawning reviews but I thought it was just OK.  I liked Cibo better.  Honestly, I liked Grimaldi's of Scottsdale better.  However, their service, their atmosphere, and their deserts were fantastic.  I'm not saying don't go, just don't expect the Mona Lisa to eye you enviously as you chomp down on a slice."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch and ordered the equivalent to a meat lover's pizza. The pizza was quite good and came out fast. Definitely had the brick oven flavor. But, I think the toppings were just ok, and the wait staff wasn't very attentive. I had to wait a long time to get refills on my water more than once, and he seemed distracted by side work when it wasn't even really that busy. There are plenty of good pizza spots in downtown Phx, so in order for me to want to come back, they'll have to step it up a bit more."}
{"text":"Loved the pizza and burrata at Pomo! Super cute outdoor patio that's perfect for night dining or days with great weather. Our service was awesome and our pizzas came out quickly and melted in our mouths"}
{"text":"Cute little place, pizza was awesome and their Italian sodas made for a nice little addition. The staff was friendly, we sat outside and it was a cool night. Funny that this place was right across the street from a Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"\"Quick pizza that tasted yum\", said my son Ethan!  We loved it.  Definitely would come back."}
{"text":"Great Food. Very Authentic people and food. They did all the little things that make you feel like they value your business. I would recommend to anybody looking for authentic Italian pizza/food."}
{"text":"Worst experience out in a long while. Service wasn't just slow, it was blatantly oblivious. In the middle of a 45 minute wait for a plate of bread I saw a manager, but only in that I saw her ineffectually milling about doing nothing (certainly not keeping an eye on the satisfaction of patrons). Wasn't offered anything while I waited. When I asked for a refund for the bread the waiter sad sure then threw it, uneaten, in the trash right in front of me. I guess this place really needed to drive the point home that they don't care. Message received. And the pasta I waited for with an empty glass no one offered to refill? Overcooked, unseasoned, and frankly kind of gross to eat. Nope."}
{"text":"We've been lots of times and always had a great experience. This visit was not the food and service we've grown to love at this place.  - Burrata salad- creamy, but didn't have much flavor. Salt helped the cheese, but nothing could help the tomatoes. The tasteless chunks were flavorless and far from heirloom quality. The homemade fig jam listed on the menu was missing from our plate. Not worth $15. - Kale-Romana salad- ($10)- the name is a little misleading. There were a few pieces of kale, but it was mostly romaine lettuce. Fine, but disappointed by the bait and switch. - Ortolana pizza was good (better with a bit of crushed red and parm). - Carbonara pizza was OK. There was plenty of creamy sauce and chunks of crispy pancetta, but if there were onions or egg (as the menu listed) I didn't notice them.  The place was busy, but it always is, so not sure why service was a little scattered. We waited 35 min for our salads and there was a really long lag between the two pizzas, even though there didn't appear to be any others going in and and of the oven during the interim. The second round of drinks we ordered never arrived and we had to ask for our water to be refilled. Definitely not the norm, so I would return to give it another try. Hopefully this was just an off night."}
{"text":"Our go to restaurant every time we come downtown!! Everything on the menu is amazing! If you're a picky eater like me I suggest the Margherita pizza. Also you must try the creme br√ªl√©e."}
{"text":"The customer service was good. The place is nice and the food was great. It can be a little pricey but if you're in Arizona and like a thin crust pizza then go try it."}
{"text":"Great bruschetta and even greater pizza. I usually go to the Scottsdale location, but this place was even better. The staff was nice and friendly as well. Paula was the coolest server I've had in a while. She was very nice and had us laughing the whole time. Overall I would come to this location again. Right in the heart of downtown Phoenix you can sit, eat and get out of the crazy city life while eating your fine dine pizza."}
{"text":"WOW! Great food, friendly staff! Had the calzone and it was huge! This is legit Italian food! Worth the stop outside of downtown!"}
{"text":"We were downtown visiting our brother who lives in ASU dorms and wanted to take him out for birthday dinner. Pomo was walking distance and had great reviews so it seemed like a perfect place and that it was! Thank you Billy for messing with the heaters that we insisted on bc we were cold but had to sit outside. Thank you Michelle for all the wonderful suggestions and for being so patient while our family of six took forever to order. The food and service were outstanding making us anxious for our next visit....and just when we thought this dinning experience can't get any better here comes birthday desert for brother and the owner with shots of  limoncello! Thank you for a fabulous evening:)"}
{"text":"Food was excellent. We had two salads they were both great. One was similar to a caeser. It was yummy! The second was the pollo salad. It had chicken, avocado, pine nuts and a lemon dressing. It was my favorite out of the two. We then had a couple pizzas. I must say that all the ingredients were so fresh. It was really good food. The reason for the four stars was our service. While the food came out timely, the server seemed like she disliked her job. She wasn't very friendly and she was often MIA. Took a while to get our check too. Lastly we got desserts and they were great too! I would definitely go back. Hopefully we have a better waitress next time."}
{"text":"If there were 10 stars I would give this place 12!  Don't let the simplicity fool you.  Great food, great service.  Amazing authentic Italian pizza.  Everything is imported, even the oven!!  You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Came here a few nights ago. We ordered the Quattro (can't remember the full name). Size was perfect for two people and it was delish! Great service too! Will definitely go back to keep trying their other pizzas!"}
{"text":"I'll start with the negative to get that out of the way: During off hours (just as they opened) we got what I hope was a brand-spanking-new-waitress, so even though she was extremely nice, I can't say the service from our point person was anything better than OK at best. The restaurant is much better than deserving of nit picking, and since she'll be better with a little time, my rating cuts some slack & overlooks some problems with 1 person's lack of experience (for the record: unopened beers without an opener, bread and olive oil coming out after appetizers, and having to take food to go because of an organizational error on her part-we asked for antipasti & pizzas at the same time, but didn't happen). We did have two rambunctious boys getting fussy, this waitress and everyone there were very understanding and friendly with them. In honesty, this is a very nice restaurant that we probably shouldn't be bringing kids to anyway, so some of the blame is ours. Besides her, everyone else seemed extremely competent.  However, the food was excellent, fresh with great ingredients. We started with the bruschetta, and although we had to split 2 pieces between 3 people, it was fresh throughout with quality mozzarella and buttery rich olive oil. The other appetizer, veggie plate with olive oil, was good-not-great, felt like I could make the exact same thing pretty easily at home. Bread on the table was standard warm Italian bread, and the olive oil provided was lacking or they forgot to bring out the good EVOO, but didn't eat much of the fillers so wasn't an issue.  Bonus points for chef and staff speaking to each other in Italian, also for Duvel on tap. Great cute date place, intimate setting, cool atmosphere and decorations. I'd rather come here than most other higher end places we've found in Phoenix.  Pizzas were fantastico! I've spent cumulative years in Italy, and this could be something you'd find there. Not sure if they import Neopolitan water like at some places, but whatever they're doing it seems very close to what you'd find in Campania. I got the Pizza Principe off the \"classic pizzas\" menu, crust was perfect thickness and salt level, sauce was fresh and tasty, prosciutto and arugula added salt and savor to it all, Parmesean rounded the edges of flavors off nicely. We got a pizza margarita for the kids, and I couldn't stop eating that either, again great crust and sauce, and not too much cheese. My wife couldn't stop raving about the \"cheese-less pizza.\" Overall a very authentic and satisfying experience. Will be back, and even if it's a new waiter/waitress again, it'll still be worth it. Small place though, so might be a wait during weekend evening hours. Wish I had more time to try the home made Limoncello."}
{"text":"This restaurant is authentic.  Really authentic. Their pizza oven is imported from Naples!  Success. Their pizza kitchen is open with modern decor.  As a customer, I can watch them make the pizza.  Success!  Their Arugula and Bufala pizzas are really good. Along with their Lemon Drop drink.  I would drive back to Phoenix, Arizona just to eat the pizza here. Yes, it is that serious."}
{"text":"Being an industry person, it was very difficult for me to walk in 30 minutes before closing...but we had just seen a movie and we hadn't seen each other for awhile and we were all hungry. We were greeted with warmth and hospitality and efficient friendly service from David, a tall, handsome young man with a warm smile and gentle demeanor. He made us feel comfortable and never rushed us. The manager was just as sweet and we truly appreciated this. The food was awesome! A salad with mangoes, a Pomo pizza and a white pizza with prosciutto and mushrooms! The spicy olive oil is delish, too. We did have one other pizza but I don't remember the name but we added arugula to it! Yummy! Quaint atmosphere, friendly staff, great food. We will be back. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Im giving this place the ine star simply because I enjoyed the crust on the pizza. But, the hostess, besides sitting down and leaving her post to be with her friends (so did other waitor/ waitress, so im not sure if it was the owners or something) was actually nice. Our witress was very ingenuine and not helpful. She simply did a the minimum: asked for our order and brought us food. First, we asked for water because we were super thirsty, but my boyfriend pointed out all the crap that was in it, little black peices that looked like dead bugs to me. Also, their tables were sloppily cleaned, white on top, but full of dirt and pizza souce on the edges. Finally, we got our very small and unsatisfying 17$ pizza. Thats right SMALL, meant for one person."}
{"text":"Rude rude rude. Horrible customer service, we parked just across the street but we didn't have change to feed the meter. We sat down and were looking at the menu but we were concerned about the parking so we asked our server if she can break a 20 so we can feed the meter and she sent my husband to the hostess, so she went to the bartender and he was soooooo mean!!!he made an ugly hand sign to indicate that there was no change...so we walked out.  Please be nice to customers since we are the ones who keep a business going. We were prepared to spend over $100"}
{"text":"The word on the street is that Pomo is where it's at.  I have tested that theory, and it proves to be true.  This place is fantastically tasty and has the best service I have encountered in a very long time.  My hubby and I were hungry after Yelp's Downtown Revival Event and we had seen Pomo at the event.  They obviously support Yelp, which means Yelpers must support them.    We walked in around 9pm, so it was only about half full.  We took a seat at the bar and ordered two glasses of wine.  The wine is all reasonably priced.  We ordered the Margherita pizza and added mushrooms (which might be a crime against humanity in Italy but that's how we like it).  We also spilt a salad to share.  The pizza was perfectly cooked.  Unlike some other Neapolitan pizza joints, this pizza had an even char across the entire pie.  It was an amazing pizza and you could tell that all the ingredients were the absolute best quality.  The bartender and our server for the evening, David, was making a delicious looking martini with hibiscus and peach schnapps so I went ahead and ordered one for myself as well.  I don't remember what it was called (the first glass of wine had already gone to my head) but it was one heck of a great martini.  For dessert, we ordered the cr√®me brulee which came with strawberries and raspberries on top.  It had amazing vanilla bean flavor and you could see the flecks of vanilla bean in the custard.    I have to say that the service from David definitely put this place over the top in terms of quality for us.  Give that man a raise!"}
{"text":"This is an \"official-authentic\" Italien restaurant, and I frequent it regularly. But it is not just basic - it is gourmet.  My favorite waitress is Marie, and she waited on me today. She should probably be given some sort of award or something as the best waitress I have ever had.   There is LIVE basil hanging on the wall. For real. Just walk up and see for yourself.   The olive oil is unbelievable.   I giant copper covered Pizza oven adds to the environment.   If you care, the salads are all organic. And the optional chicken on the salads is organic raised.   They have both gluten free and regular food.   I have never had anything that was less than \"unbelievably good\" at this restaurant.   On the other side of the restaurant is a small cafe that opens in the morning before the main restaurant. (Cafe is closed Sunday) It is the best expresso machine in Scottsdale, with the owner of the restaurant (sometimes) who actually knows how to make a real expresso or cappuccino. You should understand how rare this is. Note: The express or coffee you get in the main restaurant comes from the same expresso machine.   The pasteries remind me of being back in Italy.   You are not going to find an Italien place like this very often.   *Please take it easy on the wait staff, and please give them positive feedback when you write a review. These folks work hard, and are subject to a lot of reviews online, because this restaurant is growing in popularity.  One night I took my entire staff to eat here, and we were treated like royalty, even though the place was super busy.   Warning:  The one negative thing I would say is that Pomo's destroys the Pizza-eating experience for me when I go to other pizza restaurants. When I try eating what passes for pizza elsewhere, I just think to myself \"this is definitely not Pomo's. ; - )   - Russell Wright"}
{"text":"With coworkers, they wanted pizza. I'm usually a chain kind of pizza guy, used to the bell peppers, olives, and mushrooms. This place is a wood fire oven place with ingredients that I can not even pronounce. If I can't pronounce it, it's not going in my mouth. I chose a pizza that had cheese, sauteed onions, and Italian bacon. I really enjoyed it for the tomato sauce was slightly sweet which went well with the saltiness of the bacon. I actually ate the whole pizza. Yummy."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is awesome!!!   The service and food are great!!!  They have a great variety of pizza, all of which sound delicious, and homemade pastas which we didn't get to try.  All of the pizzas are super thin crust Neapolitan style, made in their wood fired oven using oak, and mostly using imported Italian ingredients.  We shared the Peppino pizza (tomato sauce, mozzarella, ricotta, spicy salame, basil, evoo) and it was so deeply flavorful.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"So.  Good.  Would eat here every single day if able.  I split a margherita with my two young kids - size was just right.  ... try to avoid facing the door near sunset.  Liiiittle bright."}
{"text":"Authentic, Fresh, & Delicious! Service was prompt & polite-Bonus Points for the Chef personally delivering a complimentary dessert and homemade cinnamon liqueur at the end of the meal! Definitely a new favorite!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch this place was simply awesome !! Salad was very good !! pizza was excellent  (I had the Sorrento). But , best of all ...the Panini's, The bread is made in the wood burning over ."}
{"text":"Central phoenix has tons of great pizza (which I eat quite frequently), so I was excited to try this place and it's certified pizzas. Pizza preferences are very subjective, so about all I can say is that I ordered four different pizzas, and while I thought they were all quite good, nothing stood out as \"the best\" of what you can get in the area. (Specifically, I thought they lacked a bit in flavor and were heavy on the olive oil.) If Pizzaria Bianco and Cibo weren't nearby, this would be a good choice, but I'd recommend those other two places over this one."}
{"text":"My boss recommended this place and since he is someone of high importance, I trust him. Not because he's my boss, but because part of his job description is \"to entertain and take employees and clients out to eat\" so duh, he eats alot!  We get seated outside on the patio. The weather was gorgeous and we ordered the Toto Sapore and the Crostini. The crostini was ok - it was similar to a brushcetta board: one with ricotta, one with mushrooms, and one with salmon.  It was ok and I probably would not order it again.  The Toto Sapore: Italian Sausage, Pancetta (Bacon), Salame Piccante, Prosciutto Cotto (Ham) was amazingly good! The crust was thin and crunchy, and the sauce was not too thick.  I loved it!  After our entrees, we were given complimentary fried wonton chips (not sure if they are called any other name) and powdered sugar.  It was a sweet gesture, but it didn't taste that great so we opted to order the Hazelnut chocolate cake - it was incredible! It was so rich so we took half of it home and that thing was gone before bed that night.    Our server was a little slow on service, but I was fine with it since I was enjoying the beautiful weather.  Pomo, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"We stopped by Pomo to fulfill a post-happy hour carb craving! We order the Peppino pizza, which has a great spicy flavor from the hot salami on it! You can tell from the taste that they use high quality of ingredients on their pizza! My only wish was that the center of the pizza was a little more well done. It was a little soggy for my preference. I thought the size of the pizza was perfect for two to split. In fact, we had an extra slice leftover. If we had been more hungry, adding an appetizer or salad would have been great. The prices were really reasonable too! The server was really hospitable and even offered us a free shot of limoncello!"}
{"text":"Excellent! My wife and I tried this place while staying in Phoenix for a conference. We had the eggplant parmigiana to start, a Margherita pizza, and finished it off with tiramisu and espressos. I couldn't tell you which was my favorite because it was all so good. The sauce was amazing. And very reasonably priced which was the cherry on top."}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious pizza, fantastic customer service an a personal thank you from the owner made eating at Pomo something I look forward to doing again."}
{"text":"Authentic Italian Pizza- they knocked it out of the park! The good was fresh and full of flavor. Staff was friendly and service was excellent. I wish they had a sampler of everything on the menu, we wanted to try everything! This will definitely be a new favorite must on our visits to Phoenix! Excellent !"}
{"text":"This place knows what they are doing! Great service, food and atmosphere. This is the second time coming to Pomo Pizzeria and both times were exceptional. Even middle of the week and there were plenty of people in the restaurant. The only reason I did not give 5-star is the lack of a happy hour and a poor red wine selection."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch with coworkers. I usually don't get vegetarian pizza but decided to try it out. I got the ortolana pizza and wow absolutely delicious! The pizza was not too sauce leaving it soaking and the crust was just crispy enough. I 100% recommend trying this restaurant if you're craving good pizza!"}
{"text":"I eat here a lot! I love the Daiya shreds and gluten free crust option! Don't worry, this place is very authentic! If you are lucky to be here when the owner is in, be sure to drink the limoncello. Everything here is delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing finest italian food and the best italian style pizza u have ever had. Check out the pictures.. We walked in and this italian accented man sat us down and and explained everything to is the pizza are mad in a brick oven and much more and the chef is a genius with his art in making italian food it was very unique. But this is the place to be if u want pasta pizza and many other italian foods and the price was low per plate I was very surprised. Awesome place"}
{"text":"I love this place. Great service and keep coming back for the principe pizza and my son for their chocolate cake."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our meal, the pizza was delicious, the beer was cold. The service was friendly. The owner even came out and gave us free desert and lemoncello for free. It today made my day and we plan on going back again soon."}
{"text":"Just had an amazing experience! Hate to admit this but hands down one of the best pizzas I have had! The staff was great and very friendly. I was craving an after dinner caffeine fix and our bartender recommended the cutest little espresso drink... I told her I don't like coffee and it was perfect, right on point! The chef brought us out some complimentary sample desserts and limoncello shots... Words can't even describe how delicious! Well done Pomo, you just got some regulars for life!!"}
{"text":"Pomo was delicious!  Great atmosphere, great food, and excellent service!   And the men of Pomo are delicious!  Handsome staff starting with the Manager!  And the owner has a sex appeal to him as well!  Great job Pomo!  I definitely will be back for more food!"}
{"text":"We were here back in January and could not wait to come back. They did not disappoint. Sat at the bar with David again he is so awesome. A great multi tasker. Looking forward to coming again in August when we are here for move in week at GCU."}
{"text":"This is far one of my favorite places. The bartender, David, is amazing and a great asset to this restaurant. He's very knowledgeable on the menu and wine choices. Owner is usually there cooking too. Delicious food and great service."}
{"text":"Liked it so much I took a group of 15 people there the next night...  Loved it!  I was there just the night before for Valentine's Day and it was great then.  This is a fun place for small to mid sized groups...."}
{"text":"I can't imagine this place ever getting a bad review.   Remarkable service & food.   Two of us ordered the Toto Sapore and we spared nothing. It was absolutely delicious and fresh.   The complimentary pastry and limoncello is a nice touch and surprise!  It is fun to watch the pizza guys hustle around the oven.   I definitely recommend going here."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza!  Amazing customer service! Great atmosphere! Fair prices! What more could you want? =)  Special Note: every time I have ate here one of the owners/managers checks in to make sure we are taken care of and ALWAYS brings a free desert and shots of Lemon-cello on the house.  Keeps me coming back!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Friendly servers! Lightning fast food prep!! Literally like 5 mins after you order!...and for a pizza!!! Very affordable and located in a perfect part of Phoenix to take a stroll after dinner!!!"}
{"text":"Not sure what was up with their bar service; maybe only one person was 21 or over but our party on a Friday late afternoon/evening had a nearly impossible time getting drink orders as well as getting them correct!  We were a large party but they knew we were coming days in advance.  They had us out on the patio but the patio bar was not open (???) and all orders had to be taken inside to the main bar.  Some in our group had the pizzas and were apparently satisfied because I didn't see any of it go back but they have got to do something about the service or at least explain to folks what's going on (we humans can be very understanding)"}
{"text":"Vegan review: Pomo's downtown location is small but pleasant. They offer several vegan (or can be made vegan) options (pizza, pasta, bruschetta, anti-pasta and of course salads) and use what I assume is Daiya vegan cheese. The vegan pizza has a nice thin crust and excellent tomato sauce. They put the cheese on a little heavily though, so it can get a bit overwhelming. I usually ask them to cook it well done so the vegan cheese melts completely. It's not the very best vegan pie in town, but it is tasty! I've had the bruschetta before as well, and it's a meal itself. I believe the minestrone is vegan (it's marked as vegetarian) and tried it once, but wasn't that impressed. It was a bit bland. The bread served with it is excellent though!  What I really appreciate is how clearly they've marked the menu to indicate what is vegetarian and/or vegan. It makes ordering so much easier! The service is always great, and the location has a nice covered patio for the days and nights when the heat isn't too overwhelming. Most of the parking nearby is metered, and it can get very full during school days because it's so close to ASU's downtown campus. There's usually not a problem finding a spot in the late afternoon or evening though."}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere and amazing food. Pomo by far beats out its competition in the downtown/midtown area. The wine selection is excellent and fairly priced. It really gives Phoenix a city feel - something Phoenix tends to lack. I recommend the Pizza Chef and Romana salad. Another ++  portions are big enough that you can potentially share and not walk out stuffed.  The only recommendation I have is mounting the dining room tables, it is almost like a maze walking through the dining area and the tables move easily.   I can't wait for Pomo to open in Glendale!"}
{"text":"The food is so fresh and flavorful! I enjoyed everything that I ate which included: a salad, a glass of wine, and the Alfonso pizza. My friend and I even got a complimentary dessert and shots on the house. Nothing better then that!!!"}
{"text":"Very nice setting.  Oven seems at the right temp but you can't fault them for the flour available. For Phoenix this is an excellent option for true pizza neapolitana."}
{"text":"Brought my dad here for Father's Day lunch. Such an amazing experience!  We started off with a Caprese salad with some of the best mozzarella I've ever had. It came with a few pieces of bread and they bring you a few bottles of different olive oils and balsamic vinegar - all great. I also got an imported blood orange soda that came with the bottle.  We decided to go with the 'meat lovers' style pizza - ham, salami and Italian sausage. It's on a thinner crust cooked in a wood fire brick oven. I love the smokey flavour that adds to it. The sauce was perfect and not too thick and again, amazing quality cheese.  We turned down dessert because we were pretty full but the owner came over to introduce himself and poured us two shots of house-made limoncello and gave us a plate of fried dough with powdered sugar. Both were amazing and it was just so kind! I would definitely order limoncello for myself there again. It was pretty strong but not overwhelming, and I just love lemon and cr√®me. But then when we're just about to leave, he comes over again with two beautiful cherry and chocolate cannoli, saying, \"I can't let you leave without trying my famous cannoli!\" The cannoli filling was perfect and it was such a generous gesture, it made me feel really welcome. I've never had that happen in a restaurant before and you can tell the owner takes pride in what he does.  The pizza, salad, and soda (more than enough food for two) with a generous tip was under $40. Add in the free desert and it's a hell of a great deal.  The background music was also perfect - Sinatra followed by Mumford & Sons followed by Dean Martin? Yes.  I can't recommend this restaurant enough. I'm so glad it's in downtown Phoenix instead of Scottsdale because I would never have gone!"}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to try Pomo summer of '13. I'm not from the area and wanted to try something local and authentic. Well BAM!! Pomo was it!!! I've tried authentic pizza from Napoli and this was it!!!! I was very impressed with the fresh flavor and the awesome service. The cooks were great and the owner was a charm! When I go visit family again I will definitely be stoping by to get my Pomo fix!!! Yum!! Yum!!"}
{"text":"The best Napoletana pizza I've had outside Naples. We were visiting from out of town and chose this place based on yelp reviews.  I had the Toto Sapore pizza, which did not disappoint.  My mom ordered the Contadina and enjoyed every bite.  Our waitress gave us great service and was very helpful since it was our first time.  The chef was very friendly and generous.  We received a complementary dessert and shot of crema di limoncello. This was the best crema di limoncello I've ever had, including my visit to Naples."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about Pomo, but everything I can say is good...no....great.  I like pizza, I love great pizza, I therefore love Pomo downtown.   Having tried the pizza at many of the valley's \"top spots\", Pomo is my favorite.   I would rank it above any other pizza I've had the pleasure of enjoying in Arizona, maybe even anywhere, and that includes the few pizzas I tried in Italy.   It's also worth mentioning that if you're a valley pizza snob like me, you've probably tried that certain place in downtown PHX that's received a lot of publicity and high praise from the press.  You know the one I'm talking about.  Well, my taste buds tell me that Pomo is the hands down winner in that race.    With a great big pizza oven right out in the open, a nice selection of apps, salads and pastas,  incredible selection of both red & white pizzas (or build-your-own), a great wine, cocktail and beer list, a great location and of course great service, Pomo checks ALL the boxes.    If you're lucky enough to dine there when the owner is in, you're likely to get a delicious special treat at the end of your meal as well, so cross your fingers and hope that's when you find yourself there.  Also, they can get quite busy during dinner hours so I've found that getting there between 5pm-5:30pm will typically get you sat right away.    Bon App√©tit!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place in Phoenix! It's authentic Italian (they call it Napoletana) style pizza, so naturally it's incredible. The appetizers and desserts are great too. This place compares favorably with the likes of Pizzeria Bianco, and there's rarely much wait. I've rarely come and not been offered complimentary homemade limoncello as well, another plus!"}
{"text":"Excellent, by far the best gourmet pizza in AZ. This place is everything that the other more famous pizza joints promise to be and fail to achieve.  Their sauce is robust and flavorful,  toppings are top notch, crust the perfect char.  Great, hip, downtown city atmosphere.  Friendly staff, prompt service but not rushed. Thank you for finally bring a good pizza joint to downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"This pizza is delicious!! Found it through Yelp and all the reviews are spot on. I ordered a Margherita and it was perfect. The amount of cheese was more than enough, and there wasn't a ton of sauce to overpower it. If I lived in Phoenix, I would eat here all the time! The only thing was the service was a little slow for a somewhat empty restaurant which was disappointing. Either way, would eat here again!"}
{"text":"the best, most authentic, real Italian pizza I found in the United States! I felt like I was back in Italy!"}
{"text":"Service was amazing! I'm a bit of a north east Italian pizza snob and I am very pleased!! The pizza is high quality, great selection and super reasonably priced unlike some other yummy spots in town. We will surely be back!!"}
{"text":"This is my most favorite pizza in town. Complementary limoncello and crispy sweet are good to finish the meal."}
{"text":"My son and I loved this place.  The pizza is delicious and the desserts are fabulous.  My ten year old son decided to try a white pizza and he was converted from red sauce immediately. The service was also very helpful and attentive."}
{"text":"If you have been Italy and enjoyed their pizza, then you have experienced Pomo! If you have not been to Italy  and eaten pizza, then you must try Pomo. They use truly authentic ingredients and they have have a wood stove that was  brought from Naples, Italy.   The pizza crust is full of flavor and the toppings are so amazing. Fresh mozzarella, prosciutto, spicy salmi and many other tasty toppings.  In addition, their appetizers are also amazing. Fresh buffalo mozzarella, tomatoes and some field greens make a perfect start to your meal.   After you eat your delightful pizza, then try their simply tasty desserts.  We tried their deep fried dough sprinkled with powdered sugar. Simple but yet a great way top off your meal.   In addition, we also tried the homemade limoncello. It was pure delight! Just like the limoncello my mother makes.  A perfect way to cap off the dining experience.    Oh yeah, I almost forgot, the owner and chef, Matteo, was extremely hospitable  as was the wait staff.  If you are looking for a way eat like you are in Italy without spending all the time and money to get there, eat at Pomo's and you will at least et a very authentic meal and you can wash it down with a nice glass of Perroni.    I can't wait to head back to Phoenix so I can get another taste of Italy.  I only wish they would deliver to Cincinnati!"}
{"text":"This is the first time I am writing a review but when you try something new and it is simply amazing, how can you not want to tell the world?  My boyfriend is currently working in downtown Phoenix and I am getting a mini-vacation so my only job is finding places close by for dinner.  I often turn to yelpers for suggestions and thank you!  After reviewing the menu, our super sweet waitress, Ciara, was our go to decider.  Gotta love when the wait staff is honest and can help you with more than just making sure your drinks don't run out.  We started with Romana salad.  It was very close to a Caesar salad which when done right is one of boyfriend's favs.  The lettuce was crisp and no browning so very fresh.  The dressing coated every piece and yet  it was not heavy at all.    My bf is a major carnivore.  So when it comes to pizza, the greater the portion of meat equals greater happiness in his world.  That being said, we ordered the Toto Sapore pizza.  I typically have some kind of veggie on my pizza but I couldn't fault this choice one bit.  That pizza could probably make a vegetarian cry in their pillow at night!  Even though the crust may be said to be charred by some, the fact that I was eating a crust as thin as that and yet able to retain that softness you get from a \"regular\" one was like a miracle. The sauce was beautiful and not over seasoned.  It tasted like tomato!  We were tempted to order another but since we had salad and wanted dessert, we nixed that idea.  That had to one of the best decisions that we made.  I can't spell it for the life of me but that dessert melted my heart and worth every calorie it had.  It was these beautiful cream puffs covered in a rich chocolate mousse surrounded by clouds of another sweetened cream.   Overall, living in south Chandler, I would easily make the trek to return to this place.  Though next time, I am gonna skip lunch so I can have the room for more pizza!!"}
{"text":"Wow what a treat.  I make pizza at home once a week at home in Austin from scratch and after a long time have I found one I can say tops mine in crust. There are many pizzerias that have wood fired brick oven pizzas but here everything was perfect. The Panna Cotta and their espresso was another treat to top off with. Too authentic. When the server told me that the owners have everything \"certified\" it was not hard to believe. I am sure to stop there next time I am in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch at about 1:40pm, not realizing they close at 2pm.  My daughter and I ordered a salad and pizza to split and while we were eating our salad I noticed about 5 employees staring at us.  Like consistently staring to the point I was uncomfortable.   I realized then that we were the only table left and they were closed.  I asked the waitress and she confirmed they closed at 2pm but not to worry because she has nowhere to be and we could take our time.   After we finished our salad we had two people immediately clear everything from our table.  Thought it was odd but figured they would re-set it before the pizza comes.  A few mins later a lady came back and was very rude and said that she thought we were leaving and re-set the table.    Our pizza came and everyone was still staring and made us feel so uncomfortable that we shoveled the pizza down and got the check.  Again, our table was cleared so quickly and it was very obvious they were rushing us out.  It was 2:15pm when I paid and we left, not that far past closing.    I don't know how to rate the food, we ate it so quickly that we barely tasted it.  I think the pizza might have been fabulous but it really sucks I couldn't enjoy it.  I paid $30 for lunch (including tip) and I couldn't enjoy it and am now stuck with horrible indigestion from eating so quickly.    Lesson learned, don't go right before closing!  If I go back,  I will re-review this place and hopefully give it more stars!"}
{"text":"Super warm and hospitable!  Owner is from Naples, very welcoming and generous.  Free dessert and shots of limoncello plus some other cinnamon liquor.  The capriciosa pizza was amazing . Love the authentic Italian olives and artichokes!  I feel so full and happy leaving here.  They have an outdoor bar where you can eat/drink under cool mist lamps.  Very comfortable and chill.  Good for people watching."}
{"text":"These days, my girlfriend and I rarely venture to Pomo Downtown - previously opting to dine at their Glendale location that's closer to home. However, since the Glendale restaurant has recently been bought out and rebranded, it looks like we've come full circle and are back to dining in Downtown again.  Make no mistake about it - Pomo makes a great pie. We've always known this. From their use of quality ingredients to the slightly charred and flavorful crust, it's easily one of the better Neapolitan pizza options you can find in Phoenix.  As always, we typically start with bread and olive oil. It's nothing spectacular, but it's fine for what it is, I guess. During our most recent visit, they gave us a dribble of balsamic in a dish (and I do mean a dribble). We had to request the olive oil for some odd reason.   For pizzas, their bufala verace is easily their best, which is basically the proper form of mozzarella that is sourced from buffalo milk as opposed to a cow. Being the purist that I am, I can definitely say that this is the way it should be done.  I won't go into too much detail with the menu. There's your usual white and red pizzas. Everything is traditional and dare I say, playing it \"safe\" for the sake of authenticity. You won't find any of that barbeque sauce, ranch dressing, or chicken toppings here. When your pizza is good, there's absolutely no need to cater to corporate flavor - which is something that I wish the majority of the pizza makers in Phoenix would learn. The only thing that's odd about Pomo's menu is that many of their pizzas all seem exactly the same, with the exception of either adding or eliminating a single ingredient and changing the name.   House made desserts are also traditional - and while none of them really blow my mind, they're all respectable options. I like their Torta Nutella and Semifreddo. However, there's just something about their desserts that seems \"sterile\" to me. It's almost as if they're so safe that they come off as dull.  In the past, this Downtown location was particularly special due to the complimentary limoncello shots and fried dough that were served to you after you finished your meal. None of the other Pomo locations do this (at least to my knowledge) and I feel that it's an awesome touch that plays a significant role in people returning.  Please don't let old Yelp pictures deceive you. They don't do that anymore, as the man responsible for those little touches has since moved on.  Despite these complaints, I still feel that they serve up a pretty spectacular pizza that will always be a forever favorite of ours.  Highly recommended for the pizza!"}
{"text":"Took my friends here while they were visiting, great location and incredible food. Service was great and the atmosphere was laid back and cozy. For sure headed back soon!"}
{"text":"Top notch all around! I don't have a single complaint about this place! The service was extraordinary, the pizza comes out quick and is some of the best pizza I've ever tasted in this town! The owner even came by our table after we had finished eating and poured us complimentary shots of his homemade limoncello. You can tell from the second you walk in that the owner and his employees take great pride in their restaurant!"}
{"text":"Came here totally by accident, because the restaurant I wanted go to was closed. I am glad it was! My wife and I enjoyed the Regina Margherita and the Pomo pizza. They were both were ready very quicky, cooked perfectly, and super delicious.  We also received complimentary creamy limoncello shots and powdered sugar crispy chips  for dessert. This place is defintely going to give the Pizza Hut across the street some competition."}
{"text":"Over-priced. Decent, but I've had better. They need to cook it longer so the cheese browns a bit and the crust is crispy not soft and bendable."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and location, but WAY overpriced. I paid $11.38 for an iced tea and a cannoli (which turned out to be 3 mini cannoli). Too much $$ for so little."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night for a business dinner. Pomo lived up to the hype! Believe it! I had to order the Bufala Verace, made with tomato sauce, imported mozzarella di bufala parmigiano, basil, evoo. Delizioso!"}
{"text":"I had eaten Pomo's pizza a bunch of times in the past, but for one reason or another, someone else had always gone to pick it up. So it wasn't until this time that I actually ventured inside.  The food itself warrants 5-stars. It is authentic and delicious. There will be endless debates the world over about what is the best pizza, what is the best style, what is the best crust. We all have our own opinions, but for me Neapolitan wins every time. The crisp, slightly chewy crust is amazing. The toppings are always fresh and plentiful. Now, it's not the cheapest pizza you will ever get, but, trust me, it is worth every penny. I'm sure it's not cheap to build an oven made from bricks and volcanic sand from Southern Italy.  Everyone here is so nice! From the greeters to the servers to the bartender. Even the cooks look happy in their work. My order wasn't quite ready when I arrived, but the greeter was quick, efficient and welcoming. When I sat at the bar and had a Peroni while waiting, the bartender was engaging and friendly.  I heard they have opened another two locations, so wherever you live, you are probably close to a Pomo Pizzeria. Do yourself a favor and go visit!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place six stars, I would.  I love that this menu includes items other than the typical spaghetti and pepperoni pizza and the food reminds me of what I used to get in Italy.  The wait staff are amazing.  I ordered the mushroom soup, polpetti, diavola pizza, cannoli, and some amazing wine. All of it was fantastic (not that I could finish it all).  The service was prompt, informative, and super friendly, even though they were super busy and we were a large party with a lot of questions.  We got the yummy powdered fried bread and homemade lemon cello.  I will definitely recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Must try!  Capricciosa & Lasagna is OUTSTANDING! atmosphere and customer service was great and you're even greeted by the owner himself to see how you enjoyed your meal."}
{"text":"This place is crazy amazing. I brought my aunt here while she was visiting from out of town. I took a risk since it was also my first time. We were not disappointed! The pizza was awesome and the salad was a generous size. For the three of us the pizza and salad were enough. The owner then came over and sneakily left a dessert that tasted like a funnel cake in chip form! THEN he brought over a bottle of homemade lemoncello (sp?). It was so good (and strong). Free booze and great pizza makes for a 5 star review."}
{"text":"All around a good place, good food, clean, service is decent. Has a very home like feeling, seemed as all other patrons were enjoying there time there."}
{"text":"Found by accident thanks to Yelp.  Seated quickly, fabulous service!  The pizza was among the best I've ever had.  We had the stagioni.  Our waiter comped my daughter a Shirley temple and dessert (powdered sugar on crust).  We are from out of town but will make a point to coming here when in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I took my best friend who lived in Italy and traveled through Naples here for his birthday dinner. This has been his favorite neo pizza outside of Italy. I personally can't get enough of the Principe and the homemade limoncello is the perfect touch!"}
{"text":"4 stars for service and the pizza! As for the pasta, not so good. Definitely would recommend if you're looking for a good Neo pizza to eat outside of Italy. The pasta was unfortunately unflavorful and can simply make myself at home."}
{"text":"One of my most favorite pizza spots. I LOVE the margarita pizza and the kale-romana salad. Please do NOT forget the shot of limoncello for dessert ;)"}
{"text":"Just had the best dinning experience here! David was the bartender this evening and greeted my husband and me right away. He was extremely attentive and incredibly accommodating. Our food came out with perfect timing and tasted exceptional. Will make this our go-to from now on!!"}
{"text":"The Lasagne Al Forno was the best lasagne I've ever had. The Carbonara Pizza Focaccia was delicious without the tomato sauce."}
{"text":"Nice pizza place. The service and food are clean and fresh. Great for a date night or lunch."}
{"text":"Always great all around.  Love the sangria.  Love the bartender (Dave).  Love the pizza.  Love the patio.  Love the vibe.  But the best part is the limoncello!"}
{"text":"Searched, \"Best pizza in AZ\" and Pomo Pizzeria came up beating Pizzeria Bianco (still haven't tried to compare).   My boyfriend and I basically got the same dish but I got mine pizza style and he got his calzone style. We got the Calzone Napoletano and the Peppino. The calzone style had a lot more liquid. Both were equally delicious.   My boyfriend tried a German tap beer and I tried one of their signature drinks the Mulo- figazia vodka, pomegranate juice, lime juice, ginger beer. I really like the cooper mule drinks. This particular one tasted like fruit punch.  Overall we enjoyed the atmosphere, food and drinks. Very touristy.   Would liked to have had bread and oils provided but you can purchase for $2.   Overall we spent $75 for 2 entrees an appetizer not worth mentioning, 2 draft beers and a Mulo."}
{"text":"Very good pizza, everything here is 100% fresh.  The sausage is real Italian sausage. The taste was amazing and a good size pizza. The owner gave me a shot and an excellent desert both lemoncello. It was fabulous,  I can't say enough of how good this place is. I will definitely be back and bring friends."}
{"text":"Service was great, tables a little too snug for two people but when on their game the staff pulled dishes and stuff as quickly as possible (must have read other reviews and made improvements).  Food was very good, light flavors allow for individualizing oils, I particularly love to dip my pizza in oil, a little trick I learned growing up back east, so having spiced oil for dipping as opposed to choking on the traditional red pepper flakes was a plus in my book. The server was very sweet and friendly, decor was pleasing, bathrooms were clean on our Saturday evening visit.  Loved the little fried dough powder sugar things our server referred to as \"crack\", indeed, addictive, nothing left on plate.  For that matter, my husband and I shared a salad and a pizza and were very full and content!  Going back with our daughter tonight, gonna try the lasagne."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza, we had prosciutto and arugula, margherita and contadina. All three were excellent and hot and delicious with a thin crust, yummy. And finished with the wonderful desert panna cota. And a shot of the best limoncello ice cold and creamy.  We can't wait to go back there again. The waiter was very nice. Bravo for the pizzaiolo.  Best pizza in Phoenix . Grazie a Millie ."}
{"text":"This was our first time here, and we didn't really know what to expect. What a pleasant surprise! Food was excellent and the service is superb. Very attentive staff, cooking was spot on. A lovely aperitif provided by the owner. We will be back."}
{"text":"My wife now prefers this to Pizzeria Bianco.  We sat at the pizza bar and watched Matteo, an artist with the dough, prepare the pizzas.  Great atmosphere, friendly staff, some of the best pizza I have ever had.  Highly recommended and a great addition to downtown."}
{"text":"We arrived at about 6:20 on a Sunday night and the place was PACKED! Luckily there were 2 seats left at the bar by the chef. SCORE! The place was light and airy and the staff friendly. We started with a caprese salad which was nice and fresh. Our main course was a shared CAPRICCIOSA Pizza with Artichoke Hearts, Gaeta Olives, Prosciutto Cotto, Sauteed Mushrooms all on a perfectly crisp paper-thin crust. YUM. Watching the chef/owner make a staggering number of pizzas in very little time works up an appetite, at least for us, so, even though everyone was given a complimentary dessert of thin crispy strips of pastry with powdered sugar, which we loved, we ordered dessert. We shared a semi-fredo that was cool and a perfect ending to our meal, or so we thought.... We were delighted to receive two complimentary shots of creamy limoncello that the chef poured for us himself. TO. DIE. FOR. We'll be back and I'm going to order some more of that drink. It was like lemon pie in a glass with a kick."}
{"text":"This place is serves authentic Italian food! Amazing pizza. Italian owner from Napoli was awesome and walks around the restaurant serving desserts and limoncello"}
{"text":"God do I love pizza done well, and this place knocks it out of the park. The atmosphere is your typical upscale hipster pie place (woods floors and tables, spare wire seating, hanging lights, pizza oven prominently displayed). The pizza is mindblowing. We had the porcini, bufala verace, and the chef. Thing crust, perfect char, amazing ingredients. The red sauce is light and bright, complimenting the richness of the cheese/toppings. The porcini are plump and earthy. On the white pizza, the prosciutto is draped over the cooked pizza to add just a hint of extra salt/umami/funkiness to the indulgently creamy base. This is everything pizza should be, with a great wine list to boot (I recommend their Montepulciano by the glass -- it's an excellent pizza wine)."}
{"text":"Delicious!   They also gave us free desert and lemonchello!   Great service and food was amazing!"}
{"text":"I have given this place 2/5 because I think it has potential to do better and be something good but here is what I got from my experience...  I ordered take out from here using Uber eats and was super underwhelmed. After looking over pictures of their food posted on yelp, I ordered what would be potentially a new pizza spot as I had just moved in not too far away. I ordered the bruschetta trio and the peppino pizza.  The bruschetta trio, which is suppose to be 3 distinct different types of bruschetta came as a two piece duo. Not only was there one of the three missing, but the two that were present were the exact same type. The two identical bruschetta in this duo was comprised of what was on its way to being two lonely pieces of old bread that had a mountain of tomato dumped onto them and had a few pieces of soggy cilantro within the tomato clump. The next item was the peppino pizza. That was actually decent, their dough and spicy salami made the pizza but the absence of cheese that was replaced with grease was disappointing especially after seeing the photogenic photos posted on previous yelp reviews. Even when considering what was good about the pizza, the price point of that pizza was definitely above the quality of what was delivered. Definitely upset that the first place I tried after moving into the neighborhood was a huge let down. With so much food competition in downtown Phoenix, they completely dropped the ball to gain a customer.  Since yelp has encouraged me to write more, I present what I hope the company's manager and web designer will find.   Somewhere down the line this restaurant has lost its recipe of what is \"AUTHENTIC NEAPOLITAN PIZZA HANDCRAFTED IN THE TRADITION OF OLD ITALY.\" The signature style of Pomo Pizzeria definitely did not create an unparalleled pizza experience. In fact it very well blended into the mediocre pizza that is available on every other corner. The absence of their advertised authentic flavors is clear, but it also hurts their proclaimed techniques handed down over generations which after eating that can't be more than a child attempting to work in the kitchen for the first time. Their ingredients and pizza making process will not take you on a journey to discover Neapolitan pizzas unless it's through the steps of screwing up how to make pizza and decided \"whatever, let's give it to paying customers anyway.\" What ever \"true tradition\" that goes back hundreds of years and thousands of miles to Napoli, Italy is not present at this location and I wouldn't be surprised if it was absent from their pizza chain.  The Pomo family recipe has taken a hit in quality if this is what is to be expected. I hope whoever certified you by the Verace Pizza Napoletana and Associazione Pizzaiuoli Napoletani, you find a way back to your authentic Italian dining experience outside of Italy itself."}
{"text":"Well, you know what they say, nothing indicates that you like a place like the fact you keep going back and this has to be my 3rd or 4th time going to Pomo's. Each time things seem a bit more polished and hey, some of the downtown patio seating you can find. I also noticed that they have a number of local brews on tap in their bar area. I like their outside seating so much that I've literally never gone inside the restaurant, though in the summer I have a feeling that will change.   I've never had anything bad here - the pizzas are wonderful and a friend of mine tried the meat lasagna today and it looked delicious. I also like their appetizers. For those counting calories the roasted veggie app is delicious and the pizza's - I have to say, I'm a crust aficionado and the crust on the pies is wonderfully crispy and the pies, literally as good or better than any I had when I was in Naples a few years ago.   Wait staff is also friendly and efficient and the owner always seems to be around, providing fried dough crisps with powdered sugar and if you are lucky, a shot of his homemade limoncello.  There are a lot of good eating options in the area but this place, this seems to b e the best."}
{"text":"Wonderful traditional pizza. So much flavor.  Staff is super sweet you might need to flag them down when it's busy but would def call me again."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was like a home away from home! The smell of the food mixed with laughter and cosmic Italian service masked the stress of the day. Our server Stan \"tall Italian and handsome lol!\" he was the greatest server we had in forever, always smiling quick with a joke, very impressive with helping us understand the menu! Our food was norcina, lasagna,calzone, and Pomo's wonderful pizza yummo!! We all tasted each other's meal and each had a beautifully well planned out seasoned to perfection for your taste buds enjoyment. Definately recommend this place to all of Phoenix and abroad!!"}
{"text":"I was visiting Phoenix and stumbled across this place. We decided to check it out to grab a drink and a bite to eat.  I had a couple of good drinks--I can't remember what they were, but they were very tasty.  For my meal, I ordered the triolese. I had never had brie on a pizza before, and this rendition of it was delicious. The size of the pizza was pretty large as well as I could barely finish mine. I am usually not a fan of thinner crust pizza but this has got to be one of my favorite non-deep dish places I've ever eaten at.  It was nice to sit out on the patio and our waitress was attentive as well.  I don't get out to Phoenix much, but next time I do, I'll be sure to stop by again."}
{"text":"We both got a pasta and split it and it was the perfect amount. Mauricio was taking care of us and service was excellent, we walked away with that warm and fussy feeling! Everything tasted home made, exactly what we were looking for! Chairs were uncomfortable to sit on, and decor and feel were more modern and casual than I would have expected/ wanted for the feed and authentic feel."}
{"text":"OMG i love this place.. we came upon it.. by accident.. A drunk nite at the USAirways center after Jeff Dunham.. and we took a bike taxi to a \"pizza place\" this is where he brought us.. and OMG we are from NY and love pizza and this is the best pizza we have had since we moved to the valley!!! we have been back a few times since then and its still as GREAT! awesome pizza.. they give these airy sugary dessert strips of yummy goodness! with a shot of lemoncello.. omg its belisimo!!! this is so awesome.. words dont even express how great it is!! :) love love love this place! we always order and extra pizza just to bring home with us.. its that good i can't wait to go back.. think i might go tomorrow.. :)"}
{"text":"i was in town on business and had a hankering for pizza, especially the real way to make italian made pizza in a brick oven.  they do it well here.  i was reminded of my lovely time in italy and i felt good about it.  my friend judy and i arrived for dinner on wednesday.  our server david was real nice and great with service.  we ordered our own toppings, sausage and mushrooms and it was delicious. my peroni was a lovely pairing with the pizza.  when i return to phoenix i will want to dine here again."}
{"text":"I've eaten all over the USA, and the east coast usually has the best pizza. This place is right up there as far as taste.  Although I won't be back, its way over priced.  Their pizza only comes in one size.  I ordered 4 pizzas and 3 sodas and the bill was $76.13 not including tip.  Plus you have to pay to park."}
{"text":"Great pizza, average service.  But overall, the pizza is really good.  Their toppings are better than most."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!  A little piece of Italy right here in downtown Phoenix (and Scottsdale too).  Top notch food, great quality, and always prepared well.  A good selection of wines to pair with your food or Italian beers if you're in the mood.  This is a must try if you're looking for a new place to go!  A few of my favorites:  homemade creamy Tomato Soup, Sorrentina, Bufala Verace, with Montepulciano wine! A++"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times.  We had the eggplant parmigiana as an appetizer then the Diavola pizza as the main dish.  We topped it off with the  pana cotta dessert. Never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Let me tell you a story about the time when the server messed up my order and straight up lied about it.    We were there last week with some friends, I love Italian food and my husband keeps raving about this place so we gave it a go.    I ordered carbonara.  You know, the pasta.  It's on the \"pasta\" section and I didn't see any \"carbonara style pizza\".  Fifteen minutes later, the server gives me \"carbonara pizza\", so I said, \"Oh I wanted the pasta\".  The server goes, \"Oh we don't have that, we ran out of eggs\".  BUT, the funny thing was the carbonara pizza was covered in eggs! Scrambled eggs.  It literally tasted like scrambled egg pizza. Also, I've never heard of carbonara pizza.  That's equivalent to me asking for spaghetti, and getting spaghetti pizza instead because they're out of spaghetti sauce.  I am very disappointed. The pizza was gross.  If they didn't have the pasta, she should've given me a heads up when I ordered, that way I could've picked a different item instead. There was no \"carbonara pizza\" on the menu, so I don't know where she got the idea to turn carbonara into pizza.  It tasted like scrambled eggs on pizza dough.  Terrible! Will not come back, that's for sure."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in phoenix. I had the shrimp and arugula pizza. The shrimp was tender the sauce was simple but perfect and the arugula set it off. What really makes this the best pizza is the crust and the sauce. The sauce is wet but the crust on the bottom manages to stay crispy. There is just a right amount of char on the crust so you can still taste the dough. I had to eat the entire thing and am now recovering with a long nap.   The service was great when I was finished the little Italian guy working kitchen (not sure if owner) gave me a shot of his home made lemoncielo and some fried dough with sugar. The lemoncielo reminded me of a cream pastry but with alcohol. Delicious!   Anytime I want perfect pizza I am coming here. Ps if you are a small group like 2 or 3 people sit at the bar facing the kitchen. It's quite entertaining watching them make pizza right in front of you."}
{"text":"I didn't know what all the fuss was about \"PIZZA NAPOLETANA\" until I tried Pomo. The pizza here is fabulous, thin crusts and fresh tomato sauce and mozzarella. I have two favorites the DON ALFONSO and the Napoli.  The place is small but it makes for a fun casual environment. I have been several times and always left full and happy!"}
{"text":"I decided to pick the prosciutto pizza with Brie cheese.  Something on the unique side of a pizza. The taste combination is actually delicious when you can actually taste chunks of the two together.  I wish there were more chunks of Brie cheese and prosciutto. Otherwise my second pick would've been a meaty pizza.  It went nicely with a glass of Syrah. Then at the end they also gave us fried dough and limoncello! :)"}
{"text":"Pomo is absolutely fantastic!!!  Matteo took very good care of us during our two meals there over the New Year's break.  The pizza is fantastic and the lasagna as well.  Very authentic!  We will definitely be returning on our next tip to Phoenix!!  Molto Bene!!!"}
{"text":"The only open, certified Neapolitan pizza places in Phoenix. Delicious, friendly, fast! We had the signature \"Pomo\"...beautiful! And whatever you do...don't skip dessert! They have their own on-site pastry chef who uses ingredients straight from Italy. We devoured the best piece of tiramisu I've ever had. Love that this is within walking distance of our house!"}
{"text":"Walked here after a concert downtown and the hostess politely steered us toward a take-out pizza, as it was a few minutes after closing. We declined, having just walked nearly a mile to get there; we really wanted to sit down somewhere.   As we left, the owner came running out and insisted that we come back in and offered to seat us. That is an owner who cares about his business.   Beyond this professional gesture, the pizza (we had the amatriciana) was really, really excellent! We sat at the bar and were never made to feel rushed, despite our after-hours imposition. This meal really hit the spot.  Now I know I've got a go-to Italian place the next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"To me eating pizza, or really Italian food in general, is a social experience. You surround yourself with family and friends, and even sample each other's orders.    So that being said it really is about ambiance, as much as it is the food. But where I see Pomo miss is the ambiance. It is overly sterile, and cold. The staff there is great and that will help bring up the warmth level. But when they get busy, everyone in the place knows it and can feel it which is distracting.   Many will enjoy the high quality ingredients they use, as I do. I enjoy the simple nature of the food, it isn't overly complicated in construction but after the four+ times I've been there I haven't found a favorite on the menu yet."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've ever had! comfy hipster vibe with Vespa permanently stationed in front and cozy open seating inside and out. The grand ah factor is there massive handmade charcoal brick oven they cook their pizza in. They are certified by VPN and APN of Napoli Italy, meaning their dough recipe adheres to strict standards and damn if you don't taste the hard work that goes into each pizza.  Very fresh toppings and tons of variety in the menu to choose from. Only con was that my mushrooms were slightly overcooked/soggy. The crispy but soft and slightly charred crust was heaven and you could tell the cheese was high quality because it was not over oily like most cheap quality pizza. I was very pleased.  The cherry on top was the homemade tiramisu. 2 Best I ever hads in one place...wow! The owner also tends to come around the tables and offer homemade limoncello shots and thank you for coming to his restaurant. Very hospitable and omg the limoncello is so good I was using a spoon to get the last few drops out of the shotglass lol my husband was so embarassed. Will be back, arivaderci!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times and every time service has been pretty good. Sometimes it feels like you are at someone's home BC I'm sure the staff is family, which can get awkward but food has been amazing! Haven't really enjoyed any of their specialty cocktails so I hope they fine tune their offerings on that end. If you are looking for a good pizza I would definitely come here, as long as you aren't looking to drink."}
{"text":"this place was really really awesome. my pizza was draped in prosciutto. yummmmmmmmmm  i went with a group of 6 or so. and the only negative is the waiter guy did entirely forget my order and didn't check to see how we were until everyone else had finished their pizza practically.   seems like an anomaly, honestly, based off these other reviews and the reputation this place has. so, can't fault them too bad. and i eventually did get my pizza and it was eventually amazing. must have just been the unlucky one that day.   will still definitely go back at some point"}
{"text":"The place was very dirty. The water they served us had black stuff on the top and floating around inside. The menus were covered with stains and the tables were not clean, but had crusted sauce all over them. The cheese and pepper shakers looked like they had never been wash before. The options for food was very limited. The prices were outrageous for a personal size pizza. The pizza we got was okay. The thin crust was excellent! However, the cheese and toppings slid off the crust when we picked up a slice because of the grease on it. The sausage and spicy salami were good though. You are better off going across the street to Pizza Hut for pizza."}
{"text":"Amazing pizzas and service- from the hostess to the server and the manager (Maurizio) are all awesome! The Porcini pizza is the bomb!! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza, service and atmosphere. I highly recommend!   If you're looking for authentic pizza, this is definitely the place to go."}
{"text":"Pizza was amazing and people were super friendly. Despite me not understanding the menu which was mostly in Italian, I was in and out with my take-out in 10 minutes. The only reason its 3 stars is that for $18, the pizza was super not filling. It was 12inch, but so thin that i had to go back out and get a second dinner. Dont plan on sharing a pizza from here."}
{"text":"So great! Sit by the bar in the back and watch the magic happen! So good, mmm; that crust!"}
{"text":"We had a little pre party dinner and cocktail hour tonight. Our server Chad was incredible...so much delicious food...cocktails and FUN. The cocktails are perfectly balanced and well we all know it's the best Pomo right?!?! Their oven cranks out the absolute best Eggplant, meatballs and yes....pizza! POMO LOVER"}
{"text":"I wasn't planning on going here. It just sort of...happened.  I wasn't sold after my first look at the menu, but my friend was jazzed about pizza so I just went with it. But first I needed to cure my grumps with a bit of caffeine, so I ordered a cappuccino.  Oh. Yes.  I was in cappuccino heaven. Best cappuccino I have had in my life. At that point I was in for a penny, in for a pound.  My friend and I shared the sorrentina (toasted bread with mozzarella, tomatoes, garlic, basil, olive oil), a light start to hold us over while we decided which pizza to try. Once decided, the pizzas come out super-fast. My amatriciana was a little salty, but I chalk that up to the ample amounts of pancetta. The crust was light and chewy and slightly charred, just how I like it! I couldn't eat it all in one sitting though, because there was still dessert to think about.  And another cappuccino to go with it, of course! Happily provided by our lovely and knowledgeable waitress.  A slice of warm chocolate torte and a shot of limoncello to end the evening, and leftover pizza for the morning. Perfect."}
{"text":"Incredible pizza. Being from Chicago I have high standards but this was so fresh and just outstanding.  If you want a taste of Italy you have to try this place. They also have creme brule and canoli."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Good service! Got the del duca and the quatro stagioni. The waitress said we could eat a pizza each but 2 people could share one. We both had lots of leftovers. I guess it depends how hungry you are but an entire pizza each seems a bit much.   Nice touch on the free limoncello and pastries mentioned in other reviews at dessert. We didn't have room for any of the other desserts!   Pay parking although I think it is free on Sunday...we paid anyway since we were not sure but it was only 5 dollars expiring at 10pm so was good. We sat on the patio which was hot until the sun went down but not much of a view. There was no room inside at the time...  Worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Solid three stars.  It seems to me that Phoenix has a good thing going with Pizza. The last time I visited, I had a fantastic experience at Grimaldi's. I think this place comes pretty close. It's all better than Isola in San Diego, but that's just my opinion.  I shared their Romana salad which is easily in my top five favorite salads. I can probably drink the dressing they put over it. The perfect lemon/olive oil ratio. Their Margherita is also so fresh and delicious. Generous portion of sauce and mozz. Yum! They also provide a decent complimentary desert. Fried dough I assume with powdered sugar.  Why three stars? The service is horrible. We wanted to sit inside since it was so hot out and we were promised to be seated inside next. Then all of a sudden came this list of other people who got inside before us because of an imaginary list. We also had to waive down our waitress a few times when needing service. Lastly, she wasn't up to date on their beer selection so she came back and forth about three different times with different answers about the beer they had to offer."}
{"text":"After moving here from Chicago I was hard pressed to find some authentic Italian style pizza. Pomo opening up in downtown Phoenix has been a consistently fulfilling occasion. The food is as close to some of the traditional Italian places I've been as anywhere I've discovered in Arizona. The staff is helpful. (And by helpful I mean helpful. The male bartender with long ponytailed hair was super patient while two customers flipped through their phones to show him pictures of pizzas they liked from other restaurants. Like, really guys?) plus anywhere that gives you a complimentary shot and sweets after your meal is a instant thumbs up."}
{"text":"Good pizza, fast service. We did a take out order late at 10:30 PM. They were one of the few places in the area with an open kitchen at the time (it's Phoenix, not New York, places close down early). We were happily surprised by the quality of the pizza. The crust was nice and thin and crispy. We grabbed a beer at the bar while they were making the pizza, and the food was done before we could finish our drinks."}
{"text":"Amazing food, I love the sauce they use on their pizza. The atmosphere was really comfortable and they have a great cocktail menu. I shared the Pomo pizza and mista salad and it was perfect and just what I wanted. The waiter was friendly and charming and the limocello shots at the end was the way perfect to finish off a great meal. I'll definitely recommend and return. :)"}
{"text":"The pizza was definitely good, it's about the size of two personal pizzas. It is thin crust, and that's the only thing I didn't like too much about it. I got the Don Alfonso."}
{"text":"Incredible restaurant with delicious pizza, delightful employees, and unique cocktails. We have been to Pomo twice and have had an exceptional experience both times. Michelle took care of us last night, and was friendly, professional, and passionate about her job. She made great recommendations, and our drinks (the Lamborghini and the Vespa) were perfect. We started with the melon and prosciutto, which was fresh and the perfect starter. Our pizza, the Principe, was fabulous. All in all the best pizza restaurant in the Phoenix area. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I watched an episode of Diner, Dives and Drive In's and saw and episode where they featured a pizzeria in San Antonio, TX that had an oven shipped back piece by piece and where they make their own cheese, had been trying to get out to that part of Texas for months.  I never made it to that pizzeria but Pomo deserves a spot or at least high accolades.  They have an oven that was shipped from Naples, a section on their menu that's reserved for E.U. certified ingredients.  We tried 2 different pizzas, the Principe and the Toto Sopore and wow, when it comes out of the oven it's just heaven in my mouth!  Excellent crust, light sauce and not at all greasy.  When we finished, we had to try the cannoli after hearing so much about it on yelp but found it the almond/cream filling a bit bland.  We felt like we were visiting a friend's house by eating here.  Just as we were done.  The owner sent more desserts over!  Shots of Limoncello, Panettone, and thinly fried pizza dough spindled with powered sugar.  Very nice ends to our meal. We left full and happy!"}
{"text":"What a nice little restaurant. I will return. I had lasagna al forno. Great taste and the right amount of sauce to meat ratio. It seems to be a college hangout close to The ASU. Satellite campus. I got a complimentary limoncello. This is my first time having this drink, which is the national drink of Italy. Yum!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza in town!!!!! The staff and owner are super nice and always smiling!!!! Plus after just about every meal the owner brings you a tasty powder sugared pastry and shot of limoncello on the house! Love the Pomo!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"After 4 years, I found this to be the best place for pizza. Service is fantastic, and the food is amazing. The fire pizza oven chars the crust just a tiny amount to give it an excellent flavor. Sauce, crust... spot on. Happy to have them here in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Got to pomo while the Miss got the margherita pizza.  The two pizzas were pretty darn good!  Both had a good balance of flavor while nothing is too overwhelming.  Not that the pizza needed anything else, but I jazzed up the pizzas with chili peppers, Parmesan, and oregano.  It was good in its own little way!  I'm glad I found this little place while in the city checking out Spring Training.  If you are nearby, make sure to stop by for a pizza, you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"(Lots of street parking) Not a fan of most restaurants in Phoenix, but went for a friend's birthday upon his recommendation and was more than satisfied. The pizzas were amazing. When you typically order pizza with prosciutto at a restaurant, you get 1 (maybe 2) measly chopped up pieces. At Pomo, they are so generous, which makes the pizza even better. The cocktails were great and super cute themed (Ferrari, Vespa, Maserati, etc).  Our waiter and the owner were the best, so accommodating and personable. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Good food, but not great. I was with two other people, and we had a bottle of red wine, the meatball appetizer, a couple of different pizzas, and a dessert. It has been a few weeks since that experience, but the one thing that really stuck out in my mind was that the food just wasn't that flavorful. The service was great, but I don't think I would bother going back."}
{"text":"Absolutely Amazing!!! Everything. Gainey Ranch, Scottsdale location. Ask for Jenniffer Burke, she will serve you with a smile. Perfect evening, every time! Happy, fun, delicious!"}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  This really is one of the great pizza places in Phoenix.  Great Neopolitan-style pizza on par with almost anything you can get in Italy.    In our multiple trips here, we've had about half of the pizzas on the menu.  We always get a Margherita.  Any other variation of topping is just a variation on a theme of excellent base pizza.  The crust has good flavor, is well-blistered, and has really great chew.  The pizza is not over-sauced and the sauce is excellent in its simplicity - great tomato flavor, slight acidity, slight sweetness.  Their parmesan adds necessary tangyness, their mozzarella is very good, good cheese drag.  At this particular location - at the end of your meal, you will get a small plate of fried pizza dough covered in confectioner's sugar, and a shot of limoncello or crema di limoncello.  It's a nice touch that finishes the meal on a high note.  The staff is friendly and engaging, and the pizza, truly, one of the best in the nation."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times and each time was very good. The pizza is exceptional and makes going to Bianco's seem merely trendy. Small seating area, so leave your number with the hostess and grab a beer at the Irish bar next door. Parking is TERRIBLE and you'd think the city of Phoenix wants to kill downtown business.  Overall, I would suggest this restaurant downtown any time. You have to try the lemocello (sp?) too. It's amazing!"}
{"text":"Love this place! staff is so friendly and the quality of the food is consistently good. The atmosphere is fun and inviting."}
{"text":"Worst service of my life. Sat at my table for 10 minutes without being approached once or even given water. The hostess also seemed like she didn't want to be there. We walked out and the 5 employees were standing by the door when one said thank you. The worst part was that there were only 2 other tables seated, who already had their food."}
{"text":"I took six of my friends to Pomo yesterday. I told them about the powder sugary dough and the complimentary lemoncello. We ordered pizzas and paninis. Food was good but we weren't offered the usual fried dough and limoncello. Service was slow. I love Pomo but they need to be consistent with their service. I will probably be back next week. Hope the service is better."}
{"text":"Absolutely the most authentic pizza joint in the states. Makes me feel like I'm in Napoli. The owner is awesome, friendly and a heck of a host. Makes me want to move to Phoenix."}
{"text":"The food was perfect, the waiters are incredibly friendly and prompt, and the overall experience was fantastic. I have not had a more authentic Italian experience since my trip to Italy. We came in near the end of the night, and not only were we not rushed, but the staff kept prolonging our stay with great conversation and samples. You can just tell when a restaurant is working for more than profit, but for the joy of providing a good meal. You need to eat here!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered the Affettati Misti, Mango Salad and Pomo pizza - everything was absolutely fantastic!!!  The location is easy to find, the waitress was laid back (not rushing us) and the ambiance was wonderful.  We'll definitely be back to try some of the other items"}
{"text":"What an experience!!!! Great atmosphere, great food, and the owner surprised us with a complimentary dessert and limoncello shot. If you are nearby, stop in for an amazing meal."}
{"text":"Amazing! The salad, the pizza to desert. Everything tasted so authentic. Not only was the food amazing, service was on point and the owner was so genuine and welcoming. Very rare to find this type of food and service together."}
{"text":"We visited this place on June 15th to celebrate my sister in laws birthday and we were very pleased with the food. When we arrived there was no waiting so we were sat right away. We ordered some appetizers which where the meatballs and bruschetta trio  and it was really good. We orders 2 pizzas and the lasagna. The Don Alfonso pizza was my favorite. We had 2 waiters and we don't know if one of the waiters was in training as we where not told anything but both where very attentive with us."}
{"text":"After going to Pomo the first time and getting amazing pizza and complimentary Limoncello and fried dessert, i raved about it and forced my friends to go.  This time.. there was no limoncello. I was utterly disappointed, but you cant be upset at not getting something that was complimentary. Right?  Pizza wise, we got a red and a white. The red sauce is amazing. We ate the Carbonara which was just spectacular if you are a veggie fan. And a white pizza with egg (ill look up the name and update this) I really liked it, but it is very egg-y, the other people in my party did not enjoy it.  Now on for dessert. We got the creme brule and it was just spectacular. crispy but fluffy, refreshing.. great fresh fruit. Yum."}
{"text":"Read reviews and looked at their IG pizza posts. Decided to try their dairy free cheese Don A lfonso pizza. Ate some of it on the way home at night. Realized it tasted a lil weird and flipped the pizza over. Saw that half the pizza was burnt! Disappointed!  Dont burn pizzas!! Should of went to Costco or something."}
{"text":"Had just flown into Phoenix on a long flight.  Tired and hungry, we turned to Yelp to locate something fairly convenient to our route and lucked out in finding this place!  The staff is friendly and helpful and as soon as you walk in the door, the amazing smell that takes you over lets you know you are in for something really good.  Ambiance is nice, casual, warm and inviting.    We ordered their version of the meat lovers pizza to split and it was ridiculously good.  Impressive stone pizza oven in the corner produces thin, crispy pizza that is just the way i like it.  Looked like a lot of the ingredients were imported, which added to the authentic taste.  Free powdered sugar dusted fry bread at the end of the meal that was the perfect ending to a really satisfying meal.  Will keep this in mind for future trips to Phoenix and definitely recommend you check it out."}
{"text":"Hands down best pizzeria I've ever been to!!  Pizza is phenomenal, so is the wine!!! I love that everything is so Italian and authentic-- that being said, staff is great with suggesting certain items if you are an indecisive person (totally me). I got a Brie and Prosciutto pie (can't remember the name) and paired it with a fabulous glass of Pinot Noir. Couldn't ask for anything more!!! Basically you MUST come here, especially if visiting Phoenix and have no clue where to go eat.... I've solved that for you..... HERE!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"After visiting for dinner with my girlfriend, Pomo pizza offered tastes of Europe on par with Portugal, Spain, and Montenegro! We shared a Ramana salad and a Margherita Pizza. The Pizza was exactly the way I enjoyed it overseas! The only down side to this restaurant is that it is small and when the weather outside is warm, you may be stuck sitting outside. However, DO NOT let that deter you from the amazing cuisine this restaurant has to provide. The final kicker to this restaurant was the complimentary desert!"}
{"text":"Pomo kills the freakin game. Best Neapolitana style pizza in America. The lodigiana is slap your self good. I cried for my first visit. Felt like I was in Italy with the chef explaining to me what makes Pomo so different. All imported ingredients. The oven is at like 900 degrees so the pie is done in 2 minutes. Crust is perfect, sauce is traditional and to die for, and the cheese taste like Italian heritage. Not every pizza is on this level but the majority are. Lasagna was fire. Salads are bangin. Service is always amazing, and Mauricio the manager will seduce you with his Italian accent and heartwarming hospitality. Makes me feel like a young Italian boy talking to his great uncle. They love my kids and make sure they have a great time. The complimentary lemoncello changed my life. Best I've ever had in life. Ever. David behind the bar is great, all the staff and chefs are smiling and they love what they do. Pomo is a true experience."}
{"text":"We took a tip from the bartender and tried the calamari shrimp appetizer and a white sauce pizza. Both were excellent. The salami had amazing hot flavor. The fried eggplant on the pizza was cooked to perfection. We ordered the best Creme br√ªl√©e I have had since my time in France. Great atmosphere. The place was hopping."}
{"text":"After a morning at the Farmers market, we sat and relaxed for some pizza and water at Pomo.  The pizza was EXCELLENT! The crust is super thin, crusty, light, fresh and hot.  The service was excellent and quick. Thanks for a nice afternoon of food, sunshine and great service! I will be back!"}
{"text":"As we all know, Yelp occasionally throws us a surprise restaurant as number one in a particular city. Luckily, Pomo was only a five minute walk from the Sheraton Downtown. This mid range pizzeria looks OK from the outside. The place was half full on a Sunday evening and we were seated immediately.   The menu is short and dominated by Pizza. You could choose a salad or a swordfish steak but the oven in the corner of the main dining area gives you a big hint on what you should be ordering. The drinks menu is dominated by Italian wine. There is also the pleasant addition of six draft beers.  We all stuck with pizza - a 12\" thin crust individual serving. Bellissimo! The base was almost as good as you would find in Naples, itself; the tomato sauce was natually sweet and the salami picante. We had made the most of Pheonix's dining options and had expected to be taking home doggy bags but, blink and the last slice was long gone.  The service is as you would expect from a place that is $25 a head. Our waitress kept an eye on us without being overbearing. The manager came out after the meal and gave us two rounds of home made shots.  Is it the best restaurant in Phoenix? Not sure about it, but Pomo is correctly highly rated. It gives you relaxed dining and great Pizza in Downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"How does Phoenix have so many amazing pizza places? I mean, how? My previous home cities of San Diego and Denver didn't have one! This place has put me in a bind. Cibo was hands down my favorite, now this place comes in and screws everything up for me. Can you have two number 1's?  Pomo is a super cool place with a nice vibe with it's patio that connects with the bar. The pizza is tops in town. Have tried a few of them now and everyone one of them have been delicious.   The service is fantastic and you can tell the owner is appreciative of his customers. Like other reviewers, he came over to our table and gave us his homemade limoncello shots which were phenomenal!!! Thanks Pomo, we'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Had lunch with my friends here it was refreshing ,would definitely recommend this place but idk if they have much of chicken and vegetarian menu"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice now, both with a small group. Both visits food, service, and atmosphere were solid. It's a small restaurant so I would definitely recommend reservations for a group of 6 or more.   Both visits I ordered the vegetarian pizza. Which is amazing! The crust is thin and flakey with the perfect amount of cheese and veggies. Even the non-vegetarians at my table thought it was better than the meat pizza! Someone at the table ordered the eggplant parmesan, thankfully they were willing to share because it was probably one of the best I've had. It wasn't too stringy or firm but cooked just right.   Our server was excellent, attentive but never bothersome. The restaurant was even so kind as to pour our table shots of their homemade limencello at the end of our meal. It was a welcome surprise. It tasted creamy, tangy and delicious!   After telling a friend how amazing the restaurant was we looked up their additional locations and was so excited to see they are expanding around the Phoenix area and have another location closer to home. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I had the no cheese pizza. It was really good. I was impressed by the organic options including the USDA certified organic soda. Loved it. I will be back."}
{"text":"A nice sunny day in Downtown Phoenix. I had a list of places I wanted to eat at and one of them was this place. I love me a good pizza every once in a while. They were pretty busy. We sat at a table outside with a view of a Vespa. The place smells so good...pizza baking in the oven...mmmmm...  We tried half Toto Sapore and half Pomo pizza. Excellent toppings and ingredients. The crust was light and crisp but eat quick as the fresh tomatoes will make your pie soggy.  The service was alright."}
{"text":"I entered a raffle and won a gift certificate to Pomo's. At that moment, I did not realize what a beautiful world I was going to enter.   Pomo's is amazing. It's so beautiful, and the food is to die for. My boyfriend and I always get two pizzas because we cannot share just one pizza! I also love the dessert! It is just good, pretty much orgasmic,   It is a very happy place and everyone looks like they are having a great time as they're there."}
{"text":"All I have to say is, \"WOW\"!!   My wife and I were hungry and decided to get a bite to eat. She Yelped and found a few restaurants. However, the reviews of Pomo Pizzeria caught her attention and I have to say I wished I would have found the pizzeria first. I would have received a few \"get out of the dog house\" credits. Unfortunately now she gets them.   When we arrived, the immediate available seats were at the counter where they prepare the pizza. It was awesome sitting there watching them prepare the pizza. Because the pizzas were not deep-dish, we decided to order a pizza each. I ordered the Pomo and my wife ordered the Toto Sapore. Needless to say I devoured my pizza in record time.   After we were done, we were given these thin strips of bread(?) that were deep fried and coated in powdered sugar. Delicious! To finish it off, were were given a shot of  creamy limoncello. Again, delicious!   Aside from the food, the restaurant has a modern-style look to it with a great atmosphere. And the wait staff was incredible. Bottom line, if you want to eat an incredible pizza at an incredible place, I'd highly recommend Pomo Pizzeria Napoletana."}
{"text":"Excellent service and very friendly staff! The food was delicious and our order was out quickly. Ordered the toto pizza (meat lovers) and romana salad with chicken. Ask for the little white shots"}
{"text":"I work for the UFC and travel around the country quite a bit. My team and I find great food all over but haven't run into a Napoletana quite like this.  This was the most amazing pizza I've found in a long time.  Management and staff were fantastic and couldn't have been treated better.  Would recommend this quality food to anyone!!!"}
{"text":"Wow this pizza is fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. We had the mozzarella margherita, which was one of their \"Napoletana certified\" flavors, and it was exceptional. They use imported San Marzano tomatoes and imported moz and they blend together in this perfect way that packs far more flavor into a three topping pizza than you would ever guess.   Our server was fantastic, the meat plate we started with was top notch, and the pizzas take barely 90 seconds in the 900¬∞ oven, so they come out crisp but not scalding hot, which was just fine for us.  We had a lot of fun, and for $14 for a pizza with enough to share for two (especially with a light appetizer), we'll definitely be back. A lot."}
{"text":"I came to Phoenix on a business trip and found this gem. I ordered the Dolce Diavolo.  All I can say is WOW!!  The ingredients were fresh and straight from Italy.  Given that it was my birthday, I had the tiramisu.  OMG!!  The best I have ever had.  The prices were very reasonable and service wad good."}
{"text":"Spot on. Really, really well executed. You can clearly taste that the chef puts quality first. This is one of the finest restaurants in the city. Simple, well seasoned, classic pizza. Makes life worth living."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Caught the servers talking badly about my group and me. Food was a 4 out of 10. Service was a 0 out of 10. Didn't know I'd pay $100 to be disrespected."}
{"text":"I really have nothing negative to say about POMO pizza! This is the prefect restaurant if your in the mood for pizza.  Its good for casual lunches with out of town guests or romantic date nights.  We have been here several times and have never once had a negative experience.  The only problem is you need to go with a friend who enjoys your taste in pizza so you can split a pizza and salad! (Which is not a bad problem to have!)  Our favorite pizza is the pineapple prosciutto but its only a special and they don't always have it.   I would recommend the PRINCIPE pizza and Romona salad.  As far as pizza goes this is one of the best! (However, as a small side note to out of town guests, if you only have time for one night of pizza in the Phoenix area I would recommend Bianco, Sorry Pomo I still love you! )"}
{"text":"A late dinner with sister and some friends on a Tuesday night. First time at this downtown location.  The advantage of coming late is free parking and no need to circle endlessly to locate a parking space. It can be such a nightmare finding parking spaces in downtown Phoenix.     I think the restaurant is smaller than the Scottsdale location. There were a few of large parties that night.  Luckily, we found a table near the door.  It wasn't the most ideal table since you can feel the heat from outside.    Service wasn't too attentive that night.  We had a hard time finding our Waitress after placing our orders. A friend actually asked if the owner worked here, lol.  The Bartender was awesome tho!          We had ordered a few POMO classic pizzas, Capricciosa, Pomo, and Regina margherita. I have been craving for more slices since they were at the Yelp's Downtown Revival. Kids had their cheese pizza. They wanted pepperoni but wasn't listed on the menu.  If you ask, they will customize it for you.  It came as the same as the Regina Margherita but just with pepperoni thrown on top.  Who needs to wait forever at Pizzeria Bianco when you can still have fresh wood-fired oven pizza at POMO.  I'm glad they opened another location in dt Phoenix.   My sister and a friend ordered the mojito.  I got a sip of the drink.  It was on the sweeter side but still refreshing and delicious.  I would order it next time. Caution if you are lightweight drinker, consider sharing the mojito."}
{"text":"Wanted to love what others had touted as the best pizza ever, but left wishing we had gone to the Pizza Hut across the street.  My pizza was almost inedible.  Slugs are less slimy than the mushrooms on my pizza.  My husband's pizza was okay, but nothing special.  Disappointing."}
{"text":"Totally awesome place for lunch! Shared an order  of caprese and split a tasty pizza with my sweetie... Delish! The Italian owner then brought us a complimentary dessert of lightly fried dough with powdered sugar and a couple lemon ever clear shots! Very nice and tasty touch! All of the employees were very friendly as well... Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Tried Pomo for the first time. Was amazing. Food was fantastic. My got pasta and I got a pie. Service was great and polite. Live the atmosphere of."}
{"text":"Hands down, my favorite pizza in the valley! Beats pizzeria blanco any day in my opinion. Fresh ingredients and probably the closest I could find that mirrors the pizza we had while traveling in Italy. My only gripe is that it's not closer my home! The salads and desserts are excellent too!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Went to this amazing place for the first time three years ago. Even since I got back from living in Italy for 3.5 years I've been searching for authentic Italian pizza that I grew to love during my long stay there. Then sommelier at school told me about Pomo. I decided to give it a try. The first time I looked at the menu I knew this place was legit. I saw my favorite pizza from Italy the capricciosa. Of course I ordered it and wow I finally found what I had been searching for all that time.  All though it can seem pricey to some people but people have to realize the ingredients that have to be imported from Italy to make these bad boys. Hell real San Marazano tomatoes and buffalo mozzarella are not cheap imports. This is one of my favorite places to take family and friends when they come in town. The staff and the owners are so friendly and make you feel like family. If you haven't tried this place you owe it to yourself to go."}
{"text":"My review for this place is long overdue - I've been enjoying Pomo for almost a year now, and am nowhere near tired of it.  The pizzas are simply amazing; every bite is delicious, and once I start eating, I just can't stop.  The service is also top notch whether you're dining in getting take out.  The five stars are truly deserved."}
{"text":"In a mecca of artisanal craft pizza here in the phx valley, Pomo shines brightly with a niche of their own.   Downtown Pomo gives you high quality pizza made with love in each bite and ingredient. They provide a comfortable & intimate family vibe at their flagship location, and dont miss out on the owner capping off your evening with a serving of his famous not-for-sale limoncello.   Their wine list offers some of the best italian wine available by the glass in the valley, along with a selection of very reasonably priced delicious italian DOCG bottles.   Sit at the bar, grab a table inside, enjoy an evening on their romantically lit patio, it'll be a nice evening at Pomo."}
{"text":"Ate at the restaurant today to compare pizza with other restaurants in Phoenix.  Ordered the Contadina pizza, Donna Rosa pizza, Caesar salad, and the antipasto meat tray. The service was good. The pizza was okay. Having lived in Italy for 3 years we know what authentic Italian pizza taste like. What is somewhat ironic is that the word Pomo is the name brand of an Italian tomato puree that is used on most of the pizza in northern Italy. The restaurant didn't seem to use as much of that authentic puree than might be indicated by its name. The middle of the crust was a bit soggy, but it did have slightly scorched crust that you would expect on real Italian pizza.  The meat cheese and olive antipasto platter was a bit disappointing. It may be that I am spoiled by the butcher's block at  il Postino restaurant.  Variety of meat was good but only one type of cheese and one type of olive were part of the platter.  The pizza at Pizza a Metro is much more authentic to northern Italy then Pomo and is far less expensive."}
{"text":"This place is legit! A damn good pizza without the wait. It seriously was done in 5 minutes from the time I placed my order. And the spicy salame woo wee!"}
{"text":"Pomo was an excellent choice for us to celebrate our 5 year anniversary! We went on a Saturday night around 5:30 and there was no wait. Literally 5 minutes after we walked in though we would've been waiting. The service was excellent and the owner even brought us a special anniversary treat on the house! The pizza was delicious too. The bruschetta was very different than any others I've had before. Not bad, just different. We probably wouldn't order it again. The ambiance is also very charming. We had a wonderful time!"}
{"text":"My sister and i tried this pizza joint yesterday for the first time! Excellent service and the food was delectable!!!! Margerita pizza did not disappoint!! Very fresh ingredients! I will definitely be back at the first opportunity!!"}
{"text":"Holyyyy molyyyy the pizza here is ridiculously amazing!!!!!!  From the appetizer, to the entr√©es, the complimentary dessert and more desserts that we ordered to the lemon cello shot.  Whooooo. Absolutely love it. I left pretty happy. Haha :) gain 8 lbs.  Too bad the service was really slow. I got up three times for napkins, for the dessert menu and for the to go box. :(  Buttttt, I shall return.  Hopefully better service :))"}
{"text":"I don't know what authentic Italian is, but i think this might be it.  The staff was super friendly, the menu clear but not boring.  The soup was very flavorful, almost too much so, i need the bread to balance it out. Save room for dessert.  Soooo very good.  We had the tiramisu and creme brulee! Both just amazing.   The chef brought over limoncello creme.  The best thing i have ever put in my mouth.  Been thinking about it for days."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing service. I would recommend it to anyone looking for high quality pizza at a very reasonable price. The ingredients are top-notch and the staff is very friendly and helpful... Even who I'm assuming is the owner gave us a free shot of \"limoncello\" to go with our desert it was delicious."}
{"text":"Pomo is currently sitting atop the Phoenix Yelp Homepage as the #1 restaurant in the area. I originally had this place bookmarked because it's a VPN (Vera Pizza Napoletana [True Neapolitan Pizza]) location, but the fact that it's currently ranked #1 solidified it as a \"must-go\" for me on my visit. For your edification: the VPN is a Naples-based non-profit group that certifies your pizzeria in that the pizza is being made a certain way (i.e, ingredients, cooking method, preparation, etc.)--however, as my Yelp friend Glenn G reminds me (over and over): \"I've unfortunately learned this does NOT guarantee the quality of the pizza.\" So with that in mind, let's begin our journey.  Antipasti:  Piatto Di Bufala- This is basically a salad comprised of Arugula, Grape Tomatoes, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, and Buffalo Milk Mozzarella. I loved the mozzarella and the rest was pretty standard; not sure I'd order it again as it's a bit much to pay ($14) for mostly greens. 3*  Tradizionale:  Regina Margherita- This really is one of the most simple (and original!) pizza types out there; it's just San Marzano Tomatoes, Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, and Fresh Basil. I think when made well it might be my hands down favorite pizzas of all-time, and Pomo does a fantastic job with it. From the crispy and chewy crust; to the gooey mozzarella; and the freshness of the tomatoes and basil it was a sheer delight. This is a must try. 5*  Classica:  Capricciosa- For our second pie we got something a little more \"fancy\" and ordered the Capricciosa, which consists of Prosciutto, Gaeta Olives, Artichoke, and Mushrooms. We did the 'chokes on only half of the pie because my Bro-in-law is not a fan. The pizza was pretty good, but I think in comparison to the Margherita there was no competition. Unfortunately, I should've eaten a slice of this first, before having the Margherita--but I didn't and it couldn't hold a candle to it. 3.5*  Bambini  Pizza Ciro- I was a bit surprised to see that they have a kid's menu so we ordered the Ciro -which is just San Marzano and Mozzarella- and added Sausage. They have another kid's pie that had Salami, but for some reason they couldn't substitute the Salami for the Sausage. We agreed, but upon inspecting the bill I noticed that they charged an extra $3 for the kid's pie just for the sausage; so, a $6 pie went to a $9 pie. Don't get me wrong, I'm not being cheap, but something about that just irked me the wrong way. For $2 more I could've ordered another Margherita! Regardless, the boy loved it and the sausage was very high quality. 4*-pie/ 2*-for the pricing   Dessert:  Torta Nutella- As soon as I saw this I had to have it. It's a flourless chocolate cake; filled with an Italian Nutella Cream and Hazelnuts; and topped with a Chocolate Ganache and more Hazelnuts. Sounds good right? Well, it was good, but not good as expected. I guess I was hoping it'd be sweeter but it was more of a dark chocolate mix which is good, but not what I wanted. It's also very rich and decadent so it can easily be shared by two people. 3.75*  Service & Ambiance- Great service from our waitress, Amanda. She was very nice, helpful and answered any questions we had. Pomo is located in a pretty small building in Downtown Phoenix in a quaint section of town that doesn't make you feel like you're in a large city. The building seats about 30 (inside and out) and is very cozy. I think the best part of the building is how you can watch the boys prepare your pizzas and being able to stare at the awesome VPN-approved oven. Perfect spot for a date night. 4.5*-service/5*-Ambiance  Value- Other than the \"Sausage Incident\" mentioned above, their pizza prices are fantastic. I think they could stand to lower their dessert and antipasti prices a bit, but with that being said we still only paid $15/head for a party of 3 adults and one child. 3.75*  Usually after visiting a place that's much ballyhooed there's usually always a bit of disappointment, but Pomo was pretty terrific--especially the Margherita! I think I would agree with the current Yelp average of 4.5-stars, but I think I'll round it down to 4 because I just don't see myself wanting to come back the next day--which is usually one of my criteria for a 5-star rating. Plus, the Sausage pricing left kind of a bad taste in my mouth, but nevertheless, Pomo gets a huge thumbs up and is highly recommended."}
{"text":"First of all a couple of months ago I would have given Pomo a 5 star review, or higher. The pizza is still great!!! One of my top 2 favorite pizzas in the entire world. Only second to Juliana's Pizzeria in NY (The Original Grimaldi's). But lately the service there has been less than satisfactory. I used to go there every week and the Manager Maurizio took great care of us as did Selene and Desiree. But since Maurizio and Selene left and if Desiree isn't waiting on us the service is not very good.  I took some out of town friends there the other day and they ordered the meatball appetizers and they came out cold. The manager apologized and sent us out another order on the house and they were cold as well.  As much as I like the pizza I might have to find another lunch spot if something doesn't change."}
{"text":"I went here recently for my birthday and absolutely loved it! My boyfriend and I shared the pepino pizza and strozzapreti pasta and both were amazing! I usually do not eat red meat and found the italian sausage in the pasta to be mild yet flavorful, pairing perfectly with the rest of the dish.  We also were treated with complementary limoncello after dessert which put this place over the top for me, it was incredibly delicious and a refreshing end to the meal. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I am a complete pizza snob from the northeast, and this place really blew us away!  The pizza was really done well, and the mushroom soup is so outrageously good words can't really describe...it is not cheap, but not completely outrageous either.  The panini's are a really good value and each can feed at least two people!  So far, this is far and away the best pizza in Phoenix we've found."}
{"text":"Outside of NYC (and maybe New Haven, CT), Phoenix may have the best overall pizza scene of anywhere in the US that I have been to before.  I keep finding excellent pizza joints and am loving every minute of it!  I decided to head down this way today and try out Pomo.  The reviews looked great, and it was one that I had bookmarked too.  Win, win.  I drove down, parked in the lot next to it ($2.00 an hour) and walked over.  I was the first person in the joint at about 11:30am.  I was greeted by the hostess and asked where I wanted to sit.  It was nice out, so I decided to sit out on the patio.  I had a water to drink and then I placed my order for a Regina Margherita.  The first time at a new pizza spot,  I always go with a plain cheese pizza.  If their plain cheese pizza is good, you know the rest of their stuff is going to be good!  Here is how it was..............  Regina Margherita Pizza ($11.95)-  This pizza looked great!  I'm becoming a huge fan of the Napoletana style pizza.  Wood fired oven, cooked quick (less than 2 minutes usually) and it makes one hell of a tasty pizza.  This pizza was simple and delicious.   Right away I noticed that it had plenty of cheese.  My first bite in, I tasted one of the creamiest cheeses I have ever had.  It was great!  The sauce was nice and mellow, the basil was fragrant and delicious and the crust was fantastic!  The bottom of the crust was nice and charred and blistered.  The crust around the edges was charred nicely yet still soft and chewy.  The middle was just a tad soggy (it's normal with these type of pizzas) but I could still pick it up, fold a slice and eat it.  No knife and fork needed.  I devoured that pizza in record time.  It was absolutely delicious!  Can't wait to try out some of their other offerings.    When I was done with my meal, the pizza cook? brought out a plate of complimentary fried dough with powdered sugar.  It was a fitting ending to the meal.  The little strips of dough reminded me of fried won tons.  They were light and delicate and just sweet enough from the powdered sugar.  Nice gesture and it was appreciated!  I only have two things bad to say about this place....both of them were based on the fact that I sat outside.  There were quite a few flies.  Understandable because I am outside, but there were more than normal.  Maybe get some fly traps or supersonic bug zappers or something.  The only other slight gripe is that if you sit outside, there is a bar next door.  People were smoking out there and the smoke blew downwind over towards my way.  No fault of Pomos, just a heads up.  If you don't appreciate smoke, I would sit inside just in case.  Service was great and every employee I encountered had a smile on their face!  If I am downtown, I know where to come for some great pizza!   It was fantastic and I left very full and very impressed!  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Their Pizza is to die for. Salads are pretty tasty.  Prosciutto and Melon *aaahhhh***  they made a beliver outta me! We enjoyed the nice atmosphere quick service pleasant staff. They do have a full bar! Best of all no waiting time for anything."}
{"text":"I just ate here for the first time. Excellent food and excellent service!  The limoncello at the end was an extra bonus!!"}
{"text":"I am going to give POMOs a five star rating. The pizza was delizioso and the wait staff was just friendly and delightful.  But then to my wandering eyes should appear, at the bar, but a lovely custom whereby the owner was pouring limoncello!! That just sealed my 5 stars-it was tasty, refreshing and as lovely as the owner himself. I will be back next time I am in town!"}
{"text":"Can't get enough of this place. Easily the best mushroom soup I can remember. The salads are crisp and well crafted. The lasagne is sumptuous, more bolognese than the usual cheese, tomatoes and ground beef mix. There is some awfully good pizza in Phoenix, which is somewhat amusing given the claims of Boston, NY, Chi, and SF. Pomo can hold its head up with Bianco, and Cibo, and Federal et al. His searing oven cranks out spectacular crust with very high quality toppings. Amazingly affordable prices for the quality of the fare."}
{"text":"AMAZING, DELICIOUS PIZZA!!!!!!!!!!! I am gluten free but I cheat on my health diet when I come here! (Don't tell my doctor lol)   I get the cheese pizza and it is simple but soooo gooooooddddd! They closed down the location at the Borgota because the owner of Borgota is moving all the businesses out, tearing it down and building condos. I feel so bad for all of those business owners. But anyways, I went to the location in Phoenix even though it was further because I couldn't resist not having it!  Can't wait until the new one in Scottsdale is open!!!"}
{"text":"Food and service is fantastic! David the bartender has a great personality offers fabulous service and takes great care of the customers. I come here every time I'm in town and always enjoy myself."}
{"text":"\"Prego!\" Little did I know this word would become so near and dear to me. Here, say it with me. It's not fair to ask unless an Italian has blessed your ears with the sound.  Use your imagination and listen to the Colombian from New York describe the Italian. Roll your lips inwards gently, breathe in through your nose and roll those \"R's\".   \"PRRrrreee-G-o!\" To be clear, added emphasis on the \"G\".   Maurizio greeted us with \"Prego!\" as soon as we were seated. Or at least that's what my myopic memory will always hear. From deep within his belly, a short percussion, out came \"Prego!\" Waters were seamlessly on the table when I inquired about the sign outside.  \"Wine for $5?\" \"Yes. We have a Sangiovese for five dollars.\" \"Prego. Pronto!\"  Out came the biggest goblet of wine in my history of life. Still shocked at the enormity of my vino I peeked at the menu. I looked at my friend. We agreed we wanted pizza. Mensa candidates the two of us. There were three columns and we sought assistance. Starved and envious of our neighbor's plates we desperately wanted to place an order.   Maurizio efficiently highlighted the differences. All pizzas are thin crust and twelve inches. \"Classica\" = imported tomato sauce. \"Tradizonale\" = respects Napoletana style standards. \"Focaccia\" = No tomato! A pizza and a salad was Hoovere'd down. I had no idea. But now YOU do. I wanted to eat more of the pizza. I haven't stopped talking about the pizza. I was perfectly satiated by the amount of food shared. However, I could have scarfed another slice or two down!   Toto Sapore was the perfect pizza that night. The meat wasn't too salty (italian sausage, pancetta, salame and prosciutto), the sauce was introduced but not overwhelming, the crust was crispy but not wafer thin like paper and passed the fold test. Because really, pizza is meant to be eaten held in your hands.   The Insalate Pollo offered a generous share of pine nuts, avocados, grilled chicken (not dry at all!), grape tomatoes on spring greens with a lemon vinaigrette. I was surprised the lemon vinaigrette wasn't too strong. I've got my mind on trying the mango salad next time. Goals, we all have to have goals.  \"Dessert?\" I still have a half filled goblet of wine. In my haste to consume pizza it had been left unattended. (Unheard of!) We begged off on sweets. Suddenly two little shot glasses appeared at our table.  \"Prego!\" And then a plate of thinly cut, fried dough, sprinkled with powdered sugar. \"Limoncello! On the house!\" As Maurizio's friend, (because everyone is friends at this restaurant), filled our teeny tiny glasses with a bottle that read, \"EVERCLEAR\", we were armed with instructions.   \"Sip the Limoncello.\" Gingerly I approached the Limoncello. Despite my concerns about consuming a grain alcohol it was *delicious*. Alas, I drove, so I had to pass over my dessert drink to my dining companion.  Thinking the night couldn't possibly end on a sweeter note, Maurizio brought out two chocolates. When unwrapped they held special messages.   \"A man enjoys the happiness he feels. A woman the happiness she gives.\" \"You will always be beautiful to me and I will always be true to you.\"  The Italians love romance. Bring a date ;)  By the way, \"Prego!\" has multiple uses. (After being thanked) You're welcome, don't mention it etc. (In response to a request) Yes, of course  Have you tried saying it out loud? Hmmm? \"Prego!\" It's fun. Alright fine. Go have some amazing pizza!"}
{"text":"I didn't want to be the first person to give this place four stars instead of five... and I can be pretty harsh when it comes to rating pizza.  Sooo... thank goodness I loved the pizza!    I had the Toto (it had sausage, salami, prosciutto, and something else on it)... and it was absolutely deee-lish!  They present it nicely on a large plate and then bring out everything an Italian or non-Italian could want to add to their pizza -- red pepper, oregano, parm, and I think a spicy olive oil.  The pizza was extremely tasty without any of that, but because I always know better than everyone else (even the chef), I went and made it even better :)  My dinner companion (my mommy) had the Pomo.  It was the typical supreme- type ingredients (S, M, O, G)... and while I didnt taste her pizza, I did hear one of the most negative people I know only say good things about it... so it musta beena gooda!  And sorry about that last comment, mom!  As for the canoli, well, not as great as the pizza by any means... but who am I to knock off a star because the dessert couldn't measure up to the wonderfulness of the main entree.  I wouldn't get the canoli (actually three little canolis) again, but they had a bunch of other desserts worth trying."}
{"text":"My husband and I were first timers here yesterday for lunch.  We ordered the arugula/ buffalo appetizer and the buffalo mozzarella pizza. This place is the real deal! Totally authentic pizza with imported flour, tomatoes, cheese and oregano to mention a few.  My husband is from Rome and the flavors brought him back to Italy. The owner Matteo is a fantastic host and really knows his craft! You will not be disappointed with anything you order!"}
{"text":"Upon the recommendation from the \"foodie guy\" at a conference, I ate at Pomo Pizza with a bunch of people I met. The pizza margarita was super tasty. I could really taste the fresh tomato sauce and mozzarella.  The waiter gave us a free dessert of fried dough strips with powdered sugar to go. Loved it."}
{"text":"I know everyone loves Pomo, but I have had mixed experiences. I've had pizzas that were delicious here (usually the more plain pizzas), but I've had a couple that were not so good. Additionally, their lasagna was not my fave (a bit on the greasy side). Their prices are a bit high, and I understand they have high quality imported ingredients, but there are other similar restaurants with better prices and better flavor."}
{"text":"My friend is a huge pizza lover and this is one of her favorite places that she wanted to take me and I see why!! Everything was amazing.   I ordered the  Capricciosa pizza. This comes with Prosciutto Cotto, Gaeta Olives, Artichoke, and  Mushroom. I loved it! Everything was amazing except I wasn't a big fan of the olives. I washed it down with the Pinot Noir wine which was delicious.   Not only was the pizza delicious but what makes the place is the customer service. Maurizio did such a great job. He always made sure that we got everything we needed and was so friendly and funny! Ask for him when you come here!   So you got good food, good drinks and good customer service right? What else can top that? How about the owner coming around with free shots that he made! Um what!? What restaurant do you know that comes around your table giving you free shots!!?? Not to mention we also got free desert! This place was such a cute little spot for a date or even with friends for a great night of pizza and wine. =)"}
{"text":"Ordered a large pizza and husband goes in all seriousness \"what is THIS? A pizza for ants??\" Lol. Total appropriate response in quoting Zoolander. The pizza tasted pretty decent for being in AZ but this pizza was tiny. 6 extremely thin slices for a large. We were still starving after. I'm still convinced only New England know how's to do proper pizza, especially NY."}
{"text":"The pizza here was tasty, but I did wish the crust wasn't so soggy/oily.  I like my crust more crispy, at least where I can pick up a slice with one hand without the slice falling apart.    I do have to mention that the service as excellent and the restaurant itself had nice decor and was very clean.    Recommendations:  Quattro and Totto  The complimentary dessert was also a nice simple treat :)  I think I would come back, and just simply ask them to keep mine in the oven a little longer."}
{"text":"Third time I've been here.   Fantastic food.   My problem was the service. My problem was when our waiter asked how everything was going and if we needed anything. In mid sentence the waiter noticed the college girl next to us was raising her hand for his attention (yes, like grade school hand raising) and he completely dismissed us and catered to her. He brought out her request and then got back to us.   Point being, we felt very disrespected."}
{"text":"Pomo, I  you.  Came in for lunch on a Saturday.  Ordered the Regina Margherita and the panna cotta for dessert.  Every single bite was perfect!  The people are nice, the restaurant is clean.    The Regina Margherita is one of the best I tried.  They provide a bottle of olive oil on the table which I did use to drizzle on each slice.  It made my pizza extra juicy.  The pizza is fantastic on its own though.  I ordered the panna cotta, something I always wanted to try.  It came out plated beautifully with fruits and fried bread with powdered sugar.  Amazing!!  I would give Pomo 10 stars if I could."}
{"text":"I truly wish I could give more than a 5-star review to Pomo. We began going there when they still had the Borgata location. Living downtown, that was always a bit of a hike, but it was worth it. Now that they're downtown I feel like my life is complete.   We are very fortunate to have some world class pizzerias downtown and around Central Phoenix. With one exception, I've tried them all numerous times. Obviously any review is opinion-based, but I would whole-heartedly say that Pomo is the superior of them all. I've never had anything that was not absolutely delicious here. I've yet to try their panini and pasta, but the pizza, salads, calzone, and desserts are all out of this world. Dessert-wise, the semifreddo is the one we come back to most often. The Romana salad is always a great way to start. Pizza-wise, the carbonara is a rich little treasure that deserves your attention. The diavola is spicy, but well-balanced, and is another \"must.\" Really, you could probably close your eyes and pick randomly and be so far from disappointed you'd find yourself in a foreign land.   At the end of every meal the owner brings out powdered sugar covered fried pieces of dough that are almost paper thin. At dinner these are also accompanied by homemade limoncello that is syrupy thick and delicious. There's even a cinnamon version that you will thank your lucky stars you were fortunate enough to try should it be available.   So Pomo, from the bottom of my heart, thank you for doing what you're doing. I can't wait to spend more time enjoying your fare, and I wish you unlimited success!"}
{"text":"Just got to experience this place for the first time last night and it was delicious!  I tried the PRINCIPE pizza and it was so perfect with prosciutto, arugula, and parm!  All my favorite things!  Service was super fast, cute location, and I thought the complimentary dessert and limoncello were a nice touch.  I'll definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Never thought I'd ever say or admit this but the pizza here is better than any I've had in New York City and that says a lot considering I grew up on pizza. Typically you'll see coal oven pizza, this uses wood....good wood (that's what she said - I know.)  This place has legitimate Napoli (Neapolitan) pizza! The owner is from Napoli and as Italian as it gets. Ingredients are fresh and high quality.   There are three other locations in the nearby Phoenix area, I've only tried this location but assume they're all wonderful. The owner is sweet and attentive, I've seen him pass by every table in there and the bar and talk to patrons as well as offer them shots of Limoncello, that says a lot about him as a person and a business owner.  Go now."}
{"text":"Inconsistent: I've been to Pomo twice. The first time had excellent service; however my pizza was a bit burnt and the dessert was just absolutely awful. I also ordered a mixed salad, which was nothing special but at $10 I would have expected something a little more.   My second experience at Pomo: the service was horrible. I sat for almost 10 min without someone stopping by to take my order. No one came by for a good 10+ min after I was finished with the pizza and I was in such a hurry I just gave them my credit card to run the bill. When I got the check back (after an unacceptably long wait) I noticed they ran through the wrong pizza and then charged me an additional $6 for mushrooms. I was in too much of a hurry to tell them and they wouldn't have returned for 15 min anyways. In total, 1 pizza cost me $27 not including tip. The pizza was good but absolutely not worth $27.   Overall, I'm conflicted on whether or not I will return. I don't want to go back there due to my bad experience but since I stay downtown during the week and it's within walking distance from my hotel, I may return.   One thing I definitely want to eat again is their tomato sauce. I would buy it in jars if they sold it. It is some of the best I've ever had. Also.. the mushrooms they charged me an additional $6 for (when I ordered their mushroom pizza, which comes with mushrooms).. anyways, they were delicious."}
{"text":"So I got food delivered from here and the pizza was mediocre but the pasta was pretty good. That could have been enough for a three star review but then I opened the tiramisu, omfg!!!! The mascarpone was rotten like sour and miserable tasting. It even looked off when I opened the box. I have pretty low standards on just life in general and don't expect much outside of maybe ordering food that isn't old and nasty. Seriously I just got out of freaking prison and when your tiramisu makes me long for prison grade desserts your restaurant has a fundamental flaw if that will even leave your kitchen. I called and talked to the manager and he seemed to know about the issue like this has happened before and on numerous occasions. I don't want gift cards or a free meal, I just want to have faith in a restaurant that when I am ordering I can get edible food, plus i was on a date at someone else's freaking house!!! How do you recover from that?? The manager was pretty funny though when I talked to him, his thick accent made me remember all the good Italian food restaurants that used to exist in Phoenix. So in closing I give up!  Edit: they did reach out and seem legitimately apologetic and hopefully this issue won't happen again. The restaurant industry is hard and nothing will ever be perfect but it is nice that when mistakes are made they want to rectify it."}
{"text":"Our favorite hang out place. I seriously love the limoncello. I can't seem to figure out the recipe. Lol. We'll keep coming back at least twice a month since we live in Goodyear. Thank you for the awesome memories we create when we visit this place."}
{"text":"Great service. Excellent food. Quick. And owner gave us free drink at the end. Definitely will come again. Bravo!!!!"}
{"text":"Their pizza... oh my... just amazing! The Peppino is my favorite and my husband loves the Toto Sappore. They have an excellent lasagna bolognese and limoncello. The only reason why I can't give this place a 5 star is because their appetizers/desserts are not very good, and we have tried plenty. Hopefully, they will revamp those parts of the menu or just take those sections off and make the pizzas cheaper ;) Other than that, this is my favorite pizza place by far!"}
{"text":"5 star food, service and experience for a 2 star price! You don't find that very often. Love this place. Thank you Dave at the bar. We would eat breakfast here too if they were open for it."}
{"text":"A cute little bistro with a delightful European feel, Pomo seems like a good place for a drink and/or pizza. I stopped in for a glass of wine and a late-night snack with my husband. We spit the sorrentina appetizer which is grape tomato bruschetta with a base layer of melted mozzarella. The two large pieces were enough to split. The Syrah I had was wonderful, and my husband enjoyed a glass of chianti reserva. Both of us reminisced on our trip to Italy last year and enjoyed the beautiful patio on a surprisingly cool September evening in Phoenix. We didn't have a chance to try the pizza, but the orders for other tables made us want to come back to try them. The menu has lots of options for pizza and dessert as well as a lunch menu with a selection of panini. The service was a little slow getting the check but this may have been because we were taking a while to enjoy our wines. It's a little on the pricey end with wine by the glass averaging $8-$9 but the pizzas seemed worth the price at $12-$16 with several couples nearby splitting just one pizza. Overall, a great find for what we wanted, and we will be back again to try the pizza."}
{"text":"Well I was a little skeptical at first reading previous reviews. Came in it was busy I think we had the lunch crowd, however coming in we were seated pretty quickly I ordered the grambina and rocalua I believe it's was called, delicious shrimp and arugula and in almost what felt like 10 seconds flat this pizza was down depending on ur hunger level if u order a 12 inch pizza I ate a whole on to my self so did my girlfriend so u could share one or do your own but they only reason it does not get 5 stars is due to slow service time it took a while to get our order placed and throughout the meal and at the end to get out check"}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday for lunch and we got it right away as there weren't many people. I came in here determined to eat a nice salad to go right along with my diet, ahem, \"lifestyle change.\"  Well, of course, that went out the window the second I stepped into this delicious establishment and caught a peek of the pizza on the table next to us.  I did end up ordering the mango salad and the Capricciosa pizza. The crust was thin, crunchy, yet soft. It had all the ingredients that lead up to perfection. More than anything, it was the great service that I was excited about. The owner came and greeted us and brought us water right away. He answered all of our questions. The server was awesome as well.   The place was very cute with a Vespa theme. I'd like to come back in the evening for dinner and see how different the ambiance is at night. I will definitely be going back to try a different pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza! Good Italian Pizza and fresh local ale on tap, sitting outside watching playoff basketball. Does it get any better than that? Well, yes it could, if the Suns were in the playoff, it definitely would be better (there's always next year).  I've wanted to check out this place for awhile, as it was recommended by a few fellow yelpers and since I had it bookmarked, was in the area, and I joyfully discovered their Happy Hour was still going on until 7pm...Score, as it was just 6pm, and most HH were over! So, I strolled in, and was promptly greeted, but all the bar seating was occupied, and since I was flying solo, they were going to toss me outside, but David, my capable host offered the outdoor bar seating, where he would be more than happy to open up the overhead, and allow me to enjoy the outdoors, and still feel a part of the indoor scene and catch the game. I accepted his offer as he promptly brought me menus galore...hey I just need pizza, \"what's popular\"?, I asked.  The \"meat lovers\" David identified as his go-to, and also a house favorite, so it's what I went with. The standard fare of silverware, a napkin, plate and acumens were brought out while I waited, and a wonderful tall glass of water was delivered without me having to even ask. The Toto Sapore had a load of flavor, not too cheesy, crunchy, not too thin, flavorful crust, and it came out quick, too! I also ordered a pint of the Devil's Ale, and I'm usually half way done with a brew before my pizza arrives, but not here, Wow!! Only a few swigs and I was being served...this, my first visit I just hope they're not spoiling this pizza/beer lover, but I think not.  I tend to equalize my beer consumption with beer intake, and usually polish off two pints, but because my pie came out so quickly, I almost finished it off before the first ale was consumed. Good thing, too, for I didn't want to stay for a second round, but was really enjoying the atmosphere and late spring weather. By the time I finished over two-thirds of my Toto Sapore, my glass was empty, my belly full, and I was a happy guy, and very satisfied customer. I will be back for more very soon."}
{"text":"This restaurant was good. I would not say it was the best I have ever had, but I was fairly happy with it. The bartender was really helpful and patient as I made my choice."}
{"text":"Pizza this evening out with friends we ordered 4 different pizza. Each pizza was cooked to perfection and delicious. Highly recommended if in downtown Phoenix. Best pizza you are going to find in here plus the Lemon cello is very tasty also I may add."}
{"text":"I am impressed! I came here on the recommendation of a friend, not knowing anything about the place and I ended up loving it. The decor is cute and modern and clean, although I can see this place getting packed because it is a small restaurant and I think it will get very popular soon.  I ordered the postafino (?) panini for lunch.  I love that it came with a small side salad with balsalmic dressing and big parmesan shavings.  Simple, lightly-dressed salads are my favorite! The panini itself was HUGE -- honestly, it's SO big.  Inside the panini was the perfect amount of melted cheese, arugula, and prosciutto.  For only $10, that panini is a great deal.  The other half of mine will be my dinner tonight.  Another plus is the olive oil and herbs/spices they bring out to dip your bread into.  They also have a spicy olive oil which is amazing.  I sprinkled some inside my panini and it gave it just the slightest kick.  I will most definitely be back, this place rocks!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is delicious and authentic to Italy!  Thin and super crispy crust.  I had the Principe -- prosciutto with arugula and shaved parmigiano reggiano.  Delish!  Each person should get their own pie, like they do in Italy, as the size and thin crust makes it a good personal-sized pizza.  (Although I didn't eat my whole pie in one sitting, the bf scarfed down his Margherita pizza very quickly!)  As we were paying the check, the owner(?), who has a fantastic Italian accent, surprised us by bringing over a small plate of powdered sugar covered pieces of fried dough (I have no idea what they're called) and a shot of homemade limoncello for each of us.  Fantastic!  The limoncello was the perfect way to top off a great experience!  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!  It was our first time there the staff was friendly the food was TO DIE FOR and they gave us dessert on the house, I'm definately going back there. I love supporting small businesses."}
{"text":"We visited downtown Phoenix for the Home Show and needed a place to eat. Opted for Pomo because Matt's Big Breakfast was too busy (probably why we've never been there). We had been to Pomo's Scottsdale location when they first opened and never returned because we just weren't wowed. We still weren't wowed.  I guess I'm very particular about my pizza because of my strong Italian roots. The crust was good, nice amount of char but overall just tasteless pizza. We had the Margarita Pizza and the Pizza Chef. Both good size pizzas but no distinct flavors, the tomato sauce was bland, very light in color; definitely not a hearty sauce even for pizza. If it wasn't for the prosciutto on the Chef  it would have been completely tasteless. I've been to much better pizza places in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"I was told that this was the best pizza in Phoenix. The Yelp reviews make it seem like a winner. This is hands down the WORST pizza I've ever had. It was dripping more than an ice cube in the desert. I have no idea why the pizza was so moist, with the brick oven I expected a crispy and delicate pizza. But what landed on our table needed a shop vac to suck up whatever random liquid was coming from this undercooked pie. I've come to the conclusion that Arizona and its people have no idea what good food is. Enjoy your crap."}
{"text":"Love it here!! The pizza's are so amazing AND AUTHENTIC, come out 5 minutes after you order, and the staff is so friendly. Every dish I've tried (from the grilled veggies, to the soup, to the many pizzas) has been wonderful. It's also not absurdly pricey and the atmosphere is warm and inviting. The owner also comes around after each pizza is put out and brings the cheese and this delicious spicy olive oil. He's very friendly and loves to give you a shot of limoncelo if you're lucky!  1 pizza is great for 2 people to share. It's more fun in a bigger group where you can get a few to try all the yummies. Ingredients are top notch, the dough is fabulous, and give me all the mozzarella please! I always suggest Pomo when we're wondering what to do for dinner and can't wait to try all their pies."}
{"text":"Hand made, quick fire pizzas that can be customized with a respectable array of artisanal ingredients.     I had the TIROLESE with Brie' Cheese, Smoked Speck Alto Adige IGP.  This type of pizza is not my personal favorite, but what I do know is that it was cooked perfectly, and the ingredients used made it feel like I was sitting in a small village, eating cured meats and chesse from someone who had made it all themselves.  The fact that the owner was in the store cooking my pizza created that feeling of authenticity, that when paired with my italian wine (great choices from all over Italy on the menu), made it feel for just a moment like I was not in sizzling Phoenix.    To be transported away, if but only for a moment by the experience of eating food, is one of the greatest pleasures of dining, and Pomo Pizzeria gave me that experience.    A happy 4 stars."}
{"text":"I don't see how anyone could give this place less than 5 stars. Went here on a Friday night and it was busy, waited maybe 10 minutes before I was seated but was able to get drinks while we waited. I was amazed how quickly the ladies got the tables ready for the next customers and the owner was very much involved. We had the Roma Salad and the Margherita Pizza and my wife had the Vespa cocktail which she thought was very refreshing. Before we left we were treated with a complimentary shot of is very own limoncello. It was simply a fantastic experience and our taste buds loved it! You have to ex price this place!  Did I mention their company car is a Fiat 500? How perfect is that?"}
{"text":"True Italian pizza and experience! I had the carbonara pizza, which is to die for. The sauce is made with egg whites and is not too over bearing like at some places. The staff is friendly and helpful. Highly recommend this pizzeria."}
{"text":"Stefano, the owner, has done an amazing things with bringing us authentic Italian pizza! I have been coming here for years and wouldn't go anywhere else. The buffala is best!"}
{"text":"Great service!! Had three different pizzas and was complimented with homemade lemon cello and powdered sugar crisps!! Fresh food and great service even during Super Bowl week!"}
{"text":"Great!  There goes my diet. So much for that three day vodka cleanse. The pizza here is out of this world. The crust is just sublime. The cheese does not overwhelm the sauce or ingredients. I had the diabolo and my friend the shrimp and arugula. Both equally perfect in their own way. The service was a tad bit slow but still friendly and attentive. I will be going back to try out everything on the menu. And one more thing, the complimentary limoncello shot we got at the end was not only super tasty but appreciated. Nice touch!"}
{"text":"We liked it. It's not your typical americanized pizza. It had great flavor but was a little soggy towards the center. We order the quattro stagioni and the roman salad. They served some bread before hand with some spicy oil. All in all, it was tasty."}
{"text":"greatest pizza i've ever had. would not recommend the cocktails tho."}
{"text":"Best pizza around! (This is for the downtown location only) I have been here many times, listen just give me a pizza that is fresh, not overly complicated and made with love!  And that's what they do here!!"}
{"text":"Pizza was mediocre at best. I believe the majority of great reviews for this place are being posted by people who have not experienced classic Neapolitan style pizza in any other setting. If you are used to the pizza hut across the street then you will find this place fun and exciting with a new take on pizza flavors. However in my opinion the flavors were all wrong, the crust was very good, the sauce and topping combinations were where this pizza fell short in my opinion. The lasagna was very good but it is the only \"pasta\" on the menu, if you want bread with your lasagna be prepared to pay for it. Our service was horrible although I do not think this reflects on the restaurant as much as the individual who was serving us. Our drinks came out with no ice, when we questioned this we were told the ice machine was broke and they were down to there last bag. I understand things happen but it would have been nice to have been informed of this situation before they were brought to us. Overall I feel this place is trying to hard to be an upscale pizzeria and falling very short."}
{"text":"They don't do reservations but they do call aheads which is basically a reservation. Small but cute so be prepared to sit outside. If you're not use to a lot of true Italian ingredients you may get lost in the menu...BUT the staff is super friendly and will help you understand. Food was quite good. The only reason I gave it a 4 out of 5 was the atmosphere of workers not quite sure what to do. Party of 7, no seating... Where do we sit them? At the bar. Where did walk carry out customer go.. I don't know. Who fills the ice? Apprehensive about asking who gets bill. It just seemed like they were brand new.. Maybe they were. Overall good place to eat!"}
{"text":"Went on Tuesday night, pleasantly suprised, got a nice bottle of wine 1/2 off and a great pizza, David the bar tender, was fantastic great recommendation of the pie, nice ambience,  great people,  awesome food,  a must go and check out."}
{"text":"I read that this was one of the best restaurants in Phoenix, and rushed from the airport to get there before they closed. Major disappointment, or maybe I just went to the wrong place. Hip pizzeria with great, friendly service, but the pizza was leathery with a funky, unpleasant taste. We each had one piece, and tho' we were hungry, we tossed the rest!. Hated to waste a great bottle of Seghesio Zin on that pizza, but maybe it saved the evening from a complete disaster. It didn't appear that one could really custom order your pie from a variety of ingredients. If you choose to ignore my warning at least check the menu first. Expensive (gotta pay for hip, right?)"}
{"text":"What a fantastic dining experience from the very first impression to the last. The entire experience was just terrific. I had called earlier in the day to get directions and parking information. The woman on the phone was just so wonderful and friendly. I was happy that my first impression was starting out just great. From the moment we walked in we were made to feel like family.  As an Italian restaurant should and is usually so good at. (Hint, hint to other vendors in town) The pizza here is totally, radically delish and I am very picky about Pizza. Pomo's is one of only two places in town to be certified in the making of authentic Italian style Napoletana pizza. Even with the burnt crust, which I am never a fan of, the pizza was still wonderful.      We also ordered the Flatbread App ( Loaded with garlic and the size of a pizza, so heads up) and the Caprese Salad ( Delish). For dessert we ordered The Tiramisu, and the Creme Puffs with Mousse. The Creme Puffs were light and airy and yummy.  The Tiramisu was one of the best two I have ever had. I have eaten a lot in my life since it is my favorite dessert.      Now the impressive part to make me homesick.  As we were sitting and digesting our carb load and contemplating a roll out to my car one of the owners came to our table to say hi. Besides being an extremely handsome Italian, friendly, and chatty he had a bottle of Limoncello in his hands. My version of the perfect man. Hello, but I digress. He served us complimentary shots of their version of Limoncello.  It has an Icee creamy texture to it. It took me a minute and a few tries but in the end I decided I liked it very much despite the unusual texture for this drink. It was very inventive and I love food inventions/experimentation. I believe he said he adds heavy cream and some other ingredient to it to make it thicker. He also gave us a sample of deep friend dough strips with powered sugar. it was kind of like a Zeppole but flatter and harder. The owner walked the floor chatting with his guests making them feel at home. Now that is the type of Italian restaurant I remember from the old neighborhood."}
{"text":"Whaddup fam. I walked into this place in an Uptown Funk type of mood. A few coworkers and I had one of those Secret Santa shindigs and we had to come to a quorum on a place that could satisfy and satiate a diverse set of palates. So we settled on Pomo, and since it was a Friday night, we called ahead of time and had a table prepared for us. We entered that joint like Bruno Mars and his crew at the beginning of Uptown Funk - we were fly.  I look back on it now, and I now realize in hindsight that I was unwittingly having my Last Supper moment with them. I ain't Jesus, nor were any of them endowed with otherworldly powers, but it was the last time we all broke bread together; and I am happy to say it was a delightfully memorable experience.   Phoenix has Fired Pie, Dominoes, Little Caesar's, hell it has Digiorno if those commercials really hit a nerve and you actually wanna pass that off as delivery (Tombstone better IMO.) Pomo towers above those brands. I am a pretty simple guy so I always get pepperoni, but my bros and gals got dishes that completed the entire spectrum of colors that the human eye can comprehend.  My pizza was stellar. So stellar that I was thinking about eating half there and saving the rest for the weekend. Note I went there on a Friday. That pizza is so good you wanna divvy up the rest of it for a fun weekend. It could be a \"hey I've known you for three years and just asked you on a date food,\" or it's 3am and my head feels like Alan's after he got hit by Tyson in the Hangover. As far as I know, my crew shared similar sentiments.  Now on to cost. When you are getting high-end stuff, you pay a bit more. So make sure you are ready to take hammer to your poor piggy bank. Also, topic switch, the general mood. The place is chill. It's the Jason Bourne of restaurants. From the staff to the chairs it's calm, collected, and cordial. This all coalesces in a way to ensure you're able to have a good time with the right people. It's also quite close to De Soto and the rest of downtown, so it's in good walking distance if this is the first stop before many.  There was one drawback. One drawback which took away that 5 star spot. The bread. Fam, I've been to Red Lobster and have had 3 servings of those cheddar biscuits and have tried to get out of paying the bill. I mean damn, I've been to a Chinese restaurant that was once an Opera theatre that served baller bread. Oddly though, the bread here doesn't cause one to salivate. I don't know all the facts behind this bread. Maybe an investigation by the F.B.I. needs to be launched to deduce why the bread here doesn't compare to lesser establishments.   But everything considered, Pomo is dope AF. I got to have one last hoorah with a group of people that I have ended up cherishing like Jesus cherished his disciples. Pomo is only 4 stars for me because I am really picky about bread - I own that pickiness. But for most it will likely be 5 stars. Don't waste your time with pizza that shames the name. Get down to Pomo and chow down."}
{"text":"Trendy place to eat. Very friendly and cute location. Our waitress was from our home town in California!  Go Giants!   Good pizza and great house wine. Hostess did exactly what he was supposed to do and insure we were having a good dinner. Found a new place to dine when in Phoenix again. Highly recommended. Great customer service!"}
{"text":"Came here on a random Friday night after bookmarking it awhile ago after seeing the glowing reviews. When we pulled up via pedicab, we realized this was the place they had been working on the last time we ventured into SquashBlossom. The patio area looked nice but it was way too hot that night to sit outside so we opted for the dinning room.  When we walked in, the place was nearly full but we were greeted and sat near the back wall at a small table. Our waitress was friendly and we both ordered cocktails that were really good. We opted to get the Focaccia bread as an appetizer and then share the Mango Salad and Peppino pizza. I requested that the Mango salad be made with other greens besides arugula. As I mentioned in the Zpizza review, since when has this crappy, peppery green become so fashionable?!?! If I want my salad to taste like an herb, I'll add it, thank you very much. When I asked for a substitution with one of the other greens listed on the menu, our waitress said they couldn't really do it, that the salads were pre-made. I probably should have opted for a different salad but she said it was a blend so I thought I could probably overlook it if there wasn't a lot of it.  We received a basket of bread that was just okay in flavor. It was nice and soft though and at first I thought it was the Focaccia appetizer but then it arrived, nearly taking up our whole table! It wasn't quite what I had expected though. It was definitely flatbread that had been baked but the waitress advertised it as being able to be dipped in their homemade vinegar and oil. That's what sold me on it so I had expected some bread that actually soaked up the oil. If you've ever had a salad at Gelato spot, it was a lot like their bread under their salads. Picture a really big, baked tortilla. There's not a lot there to soak up anything.   Our salad came out next. Sadly, 10% was baby lettuce and the rest arugula. Everything else on this salad was really good but the arugula overpowered every other flavor. I wouldn't get it again and it would be nice if restaurants stopped serving this crap but I digress...  By the time we were done with our salads, our table was overflowing with dishes, drinks, bread, appetizers, water glasses, oils. It was almost claustrophobic. We ended up setting several things on the floor so we didn't dump anything. The place is tiny so they can't have massive tables but it would be helpful if the staff paid a bit more attention to how much they put on our table and keeping it clear.   Now for the reason for the 4 stars. The PIZZA. It was sooooo good. Everything was super fresh. The cheese, the ricotta, the sauce, the sausage! This was probably the best tasting sausage I've ever had on a pizza. We devoured the entire thing like it was going to be snatched from us at any moment. It blows Pizzeria Bianco out of the water and eases out over Cibo with the crust and sauce and toppings just slightly.  Once we sufficiently stuffed ourselves with pizza, the head chef came by our table and gave us each a shot of Limoncello that was super strong and really good and some odd fried dough of some sort with powdered sugar. All compliments of the house. The dough was tasteless though so maybe they were just trying to give it away? I do appreciate the effort though. The chef was nice enough to bring it over but definitely wasn't overly friendly, smile or even thanked us for our business.   Even after all the other faults of this place, I'm still thinking about that pizza and its been a few weeks since we visited. I'll have no problem going back. Hopefully very soon!"}
