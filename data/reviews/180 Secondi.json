{"text":"The pizza was okay. Definitely not the best in the city. There was a good a mount of prosciutto, and it was nice and salty, but there was little arugula and it was on the wilted side before it even made it to the pizza. (However it was late in the day, so it's forgivable).   But the service is terrible. The staff are unfriendly and unenthusiastic.  I tried ordering take out by phone so that my order would be ready by the time I walked over. I asked for a classica with arugula and prosciutto, but the guy on the phone, after stumbling for a pen, saying something to someone else, coming back to me and having forgotten our conversation, tried to sell me another pizza that had prosciutto and other things. I said i don't want artichokes and mushrooms, just prosciutto and arugula - i had to convince him of the order I wanted, only to hear that I have to register a credit or debit card to order by phone, I couldn't place the order if I wanted to pay cash.  So I walked over at 8:25pm on a Thursday and the place looked closed. There were 5 or 6 people behind the bar, but they were either ready to leave, or seemed in their own little world or clueless and/or offended that I dare order a pizza 30min before close.  No one greeted me or said anything friendly. I got a \"Yea?\" as I stood at the cash to order, and \"that'll be 14.70\". And that's it.   I waited 15min for the pizza (exactly why I wanted to order over the phone). The kid that brought the box over to me looked like he was doing me a huge favour.  3.5 stars for the pizza. 1    star for the service."}
{"text":"Tried the sandwiches....they are awesome.   You get to create your own custom sandwich.   The ingredients used are quality all the way...a true gem in Toronto."}
{"text":"This particular spot is located right across from my apartment, which made it wonderfully convenient for those all too familiar lazy nights. I had pretty high hopes for this little place especially since the pizza's are hand crafted. I am a huge sucker for pizza and the area has it's fair share of pizza establishments, but this was the only  place that was independent.   Funny enough, my first visit to this place was not for their pizza but for their salad's. The boyfriend and I were craving hearty chicken Caesar salad's that night and the unique \"Build Your Own\" feature seemed appealing and promising. It was a takeout order and the box seemed unusually light but I mindlessly shrugged it off and headed home. Upon inspection, after so comfortably snuggling in front of the television, the salad appeared to be nothing more than a handful of romaine lettuce leaves, sprinkled lightly with Parmesan and these very itty-bitty, terribly unsatisfying pieces of grilled chicken!  Fair enough-that was a disappointment but I dare not lose faith!   My second visit was to finally try their pizza's and it was, thankfully a rather enjoyable meal. They say their pizza's are catered for a single person but I'd argue that two people can comfortably enjoy one. We had the classic margarita pizza with some Prosciutto for some saltiness and it was very satisfying.   All in all, a rather \"A-OKAY\" experience. I find the prices to be a tad expensive but the pizza's are quite good, though not spectacular, and the owner was friendly and warming. I will once in a while come back for a pizza but I wouldn't jump to head over there all the time."}
{"text":"One of the new very nice pizza places in town, their sandwiches and salads are are very tasty and good choices too. Run by a very sweet and friendly couple :-) most of the pizza options are yummy, they also carry interesting vegan, and super healthy doughs for a buck or two extra, but their general dough, cheese, and sauce is very well selected and prepared so one can't go wrong with the regular selection. Try the Margarita or other vegetarian options if it's your fancy, the meat options are also very good choices . Definitely add the oregano, spicy oil , and black pepper for more diversity in the taste of your pizza :-)"}
{"text":"Had a great experience at 180 Secondi with my family on Sunday. The pizzas were delicious (perfect crust) and the restaurant has a very innovative style of ordering that allows you to have full control over your pizza whether you like a simple Margherita or extreme-topping overloaded pizza. I was surprised to see how big of a selection they had of craft beers and wines and am interested to come back in the evening with friends and try sitting by the bar, because I think that would be a different experience compared to lunch. Overall I was very happy and will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"The Pizza tastes delicious but what is up with the amount of toppings to the pizza? Are they running out? Is it because its the lunch hour? I don't understand why they have to be so scientific about the topping.... its quite annoying when you expect to taste all the flavors in one bite when its mostly dough and cheese. There are plenty of other Pizza restaurants that will serve you \"beefier\" pizzas for $15.00 (that's for 3 toppings). Improvement needed.  Also, if you are serving caramelized onions.... make sure they are and not half cooked."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. Since Friday (...today's Sunday, embarrassing). Once to eat-in, once for take-out.   I think Deer Park was in serious need of a non-chain pizza place, so I'm so happy that these guys are finally open. Really awesome pizza, their cinnamon sticks are really good as well (love the cinnamon butter!). Pretty decent tap list - Great Lakes, Niagara College, and Mill Street (not just organic and tankhouse - stuff like frambozen and vanilla porter as well) AND THEY HAVE WINE ON TAP, WHAT?  Missing one star just because the service was a bit off - initially they gave us the wrong pizza, which I'm cool with - the staff is new, after all! Also because my salad was a little bit under-dressed (but I like pretty heavy dressing, so maybe that's just me)... I wish they were open a bit later on Friday nights too, even to just 11-ish.    Hope this place sticks around, I think they really have potential to become a neighbourhood mainstay."}
{"text":"180 Secondi is a great pizza place. To start off the ordering process is super easy. You fill out a form for either a pizza, sandwich or salad. Then you give them the form and they make you your food. As the name suggests, the pizzas come out in 180 seconds. The pizzas are fantastic. The crust is nice and crispy and not too doughy. The toppings are great and with a selection like they have you cant go wrong. The BBQ Bianca is amazing. I don't know how they achieve a crispy crust in only 180 seconds, but they do. Next, the cinnamon sticks are to die for. They come out nice and warm and fluffy, and the cinnamon butter is delicious. If you're in the area you would be making a mistake not coming here."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza and very friendly staff. Must try their pizza it's one of best in Toronto!"}
{"text":"BEST PIZZA IN THE CITY!!   You fill out a form add whatever you want super easy, cool concept, got two pizzas one bbq base and one pesto base, both great!! got wine and beer and the owner who is super friendly and helpful gave us extra beer, staff were great, we live in the area and will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Customer service is excellent. The owner is very attentive and will go out of his way to make you feel welcome! Remembers us every visit. Pizza is very delicious paired with a glass of wine. Perfect dinner out with my family."}
{"text":"This is a great little place that's a little quirky but with excellent food.   You have a scribble pad with options so you can build your own pizza, sandwich or salad. Went with a pizza on the margarita base, a antipasto salad to split with the girlfriend. Both were well made - filling but, light. Not too much oil / sauce on either pizza or salad which I appreciated.  To drink went with the French press vanilla stout, (very fun - like each piece individually but didn't expect them to go together so well), and the girlfriend got a Riesling.   Plenty of seating and a very friendly staff who are eager to help. I sat on the patio facing west and spent a lot of time watching people struggle to get out of the narrow driveway. More fun to watch than you'd think!  Would definitely recommend as a quick pit stop to put your feet up while walking in the area!!"}
{"text":"Four months from my first visit and now i am there so much I  feel like family when i walk in the door! Had to come back for a second review cuz i finally made a visit on cheat day and tried the fresh baked sandwich on the menu! And,of course it was out of this world ! I took the owner recommendation for filling so I knew I could not go wrong but it was the fresh baked pita that surrounded it that had me speechless! Fresh, warm homemade perfection ! I tried to save half for later and failed...ate the whole thing and was well fuelled for a 2 hour afternoon walk in the ravine and just needed a tomato for dinner !  What I love about this place is that they started out top notch and clearly work day to day to not only maintain but to exceed that level and building on perfection can't be easy ! But they make it look like it is! Yesterday, i got lucky and got a special taste of a potential new menu item (check out the pic on their instragram !) and my daughter (pickiest eater ever!) is already planning to special order one even if it does not make it on to the menu! Can't say enough. If you haven't been yet, go ! If you have been, go again and try something new ! Love this place!"}
{"text":"A wonderful pizza place! My family and I came here for Sunday lunch. My wife and I ordered \"North Beach Bianca\" while my sister ordered a classic pepperoni pizza. Our pizza was a delicious mix of savory and sweet, with just the right amount of the cheese and toppings. The pepperoni pizza was yummy too. We also ordered two salads on the side which were a healthful addition. There is self-serve water which is a big plus. Service was prompt and friendly, but non-intrusive. Definitely worth a visit (or more)."}
{"text":"After eating here a few times now, I have to move this place up a star.  A big reason is the sandwiches.  For under $10, you can select from a wide range of toppings of meats, veggies, cheeses, and sauces.  It's a generous portion in what is a nice pizza dough type pita.  Everyone I know who's tried it has come back for more.  Cheers to that sandwich!  Best in the neighborhood bar none.  The pizzas remain high quality (although a tad pricey) and they have a nice craft beer selection going on.  They have also consistently provided friendly service every single time I've walked in.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"The owner is indeed a nice guy. That is all I can say of a positive nature about what I hoped would be a good addition to my 'hood.  Went in today for first time - the parmesan bread fingers okay, but when I reached home I found the ranch dressing supposed to come with it had been forgotten.  The pizza was floppy, not wonderfully crusty, though the bottom was pleasantly scorched - weird. Toppings were too salty and MINUSCULE - I ordered chicken and bacon and while they were present, I am guessing a small handful of each on a fair-sized pizza. Not cheap, either. I won't be going back there again. Pity."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza! Very fast wait time (hence the name). The pizza is a good price and has some of the best crust I have ever tried.  I pick up from this place almost every week due to its location and it is always fresh tasting and doesn't disappoint. I strongly recommend ordering from this place if it is close to you."}
{"text":"Interesting concept. Walk in and order your own customized pizza , sandwich or salad. I wasn't sure what to expect when I walked in and was immediately told by a staff person the ins and outs of ordering.   The base price for a pizza was $10-12 and each meat topping an extra $2 and each veg an extra $1. I got a white pizza with argula, caramelized onion and Italian sausage. With a fountain drink it was $22 with tax and tip. Overall the pizza was decent and quite large for one person, only problem was I expected the argula to be added at the end and baked a bit. , instead it was just spread on top of the pizza. I ended up eating most of it separately.   The decor was interesting, with mostly single seats at the front and a few tables at the back.  Seems like the place is designed mostly for the take out crowd.   The service was meh. Despite being the only one in the place, all the servers ignored me and I had to get my own fork to eat the argula."}
{"text":"Love their food! You get to walk in and customize your order however way you wanted whether it was a salad, pita bread sandwich, or a pizza. They have issues sometimes with online ordering and payments, otherwise it's pretty good! Decent prices too."}
{"text":"Wow! I truly loved this place! Me and my partner just moved to the area and decided to give this place a try, I got a calzone and my partner got a pizza. We both LOVED our food! The in residents are so fresh  and you watch them make everything from scratch.  It's rare to find a place where they truly care about what they make, the employees were so friendly and the owners are truly passionate about what they do. I can't wait to come back and try more!"}
{"text":"We love this place. Live in the neighbourhood and find it fresh friendly and delicious. Gluten free pizza is awesome. Definitely a place to get great pizza."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery this past weekend -- they promptly called to confirm the order (I picked an uncommon topping) and delivery was super fast.  The food was delicious, and we'll be ordering again. A welcome change from pizza pizza or any of the other pizza chains!  We haven't eaten in yet (always get lured in by Union Social next door) but the space looks good."}
{"text":"amazing aesthetic in the restaurant and the pizza BBQ Bianca Pizza was 5/5, the margarita not as great but still not the best. The only downfall is the price for the size of the pizza otherwise amazing thin crust authentic taste!"}
{"text":"I truly hope their pizzas and sandwiches are better than their salads because I'm mad at myself for the experience I had last night getting a made-to-order takeout salad from them and I am never going back to waste another cent there.  I wanted an entree-sized salad with protein for dinner last night so I was encouraged to see their make-your-own option. I specifically asked if their \"turkey\" was real turkey or sliced deli turkey and they stated it was real turkey breast. I ordered a meal-sized salad with arugula, caramelized onion, artichoke, goat cheese, cucumber, tomato, bell peppers, turkey and balsamic vinaigrette. After paying about $10 and waiting almost 15 minutes for a to-go order, I received a cardboard container that weighed practically nothing. I peeked inside to make sure they actually put a salad in there and saw just the bottom part of the container barely covered with a handful of arugula, four tomato slices, four red pepper slices, a tiny piece of artichoke, microscopic crumbs of goat cheese, 3-4 cucumber shavings, caramelized onions and sliced deli turkey meat cut up. I went back to the guy I originally asked about the meat and said, \"I specifically asked if this was deli turkey and you said it was real.\"  He said, \"Oh, it IS real. It's real turkey breast that we slice very thin so you get maximum flavour throughout your salad.\"  What the actual fuck?  I know how to distinguish deli turkey from actual turkey breast.  I continued, \"This salad weighs nothing. I asked for an entree size. This is my dinner. There's nothing in here!\"  He said, \"All of our salads are measured to weigh 3 oz. If you want more, we'd have to charge you a meat option.\"  Do you know what 3 oz of anything feels like? It feels like air. It feels like nothing. It doesn't have enough physical matter to be considered DINNER. Hell, the meat alone should've been at LEAST 3 oz!  I was thinking that I GOT a meat option and yet no one told me that my dinner was going to be 3 oz in total. For $10, I can buy a head of lettuce, a few peppers, two actual turkey thighs and some tomatoes and make a salad that I could actually get full from.  I had already paid for this order so I sucked it up and decided not to pursue it further. I didn't want to be charged more for something that felt fraudulent.   The final two blows came when I went to eat this tiny, stupid salad. Their \"balsamic vinaigrette\" was just plain balsamic vinegar in a takeout container, and their peppers were moldy and tasted like dirt. I felt like a total fool for wasting my money. I'm never going back."}
{"text":"Absolutely delightful. My very favourite pizza place in the city. Also, they have the best sweet potato fries to be found, and those cinnamon sticks are dangerously good. My spouse loves the wings and says they're big with lots of meat on them. There are always great craft brews on tap. The owners and staff are friendly and attentive. Overall just love this place."}
{"text":"This is a great place. Pizzas are prepared right in front of you after you choose the toppings. Staff is very friendly and the selection doesn't stop with pizza they also have sandwiches and salads..and gelato."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! We walked in here because of all of the great reviews and ended up being rewarded with a great dinner. The staff was incredibly friendly and the pizza was delicious!"}
{"text":"Such a lovely, seemingly family run restaurant. I have been here with, and without children, and the service is always exceptional. It is more of a lunch place but I usually come for dinner as it is quieter. The butter chicken pizza is amazing."}
{"text":"Really really good pizza.  No like really good.  One of the best i had in Toronto.  Wine on tap was lovely abd excellent beer selection with great draft prices.  Two pizzas and two drinks came  to 45$ not crazy cheap but very fair.  Fresh mozzarella was great,  arugala was tasty and the pesto looked great.  Spicy oil isn't too spicy.  Better than libretto.  Really.  Come here.  Worth going north of bloor."}
{"text":"I had a late lunch today at 180 Secondi.  It's near where I work and I've been a couple times with colleagues.  I got there towards the end of the lunch rush, which had cleared out by the time I left.  If you want a pizza, you fill in your order form and it's made up especially for you.  It's a Neapolitan-style pizza and you choose your style/sauce, cheeses, ingredients, etc.  It's baked in a high-temperature oven and ready in 180 seconds (hence the name).  I ordered a personal-size pizza with pepperoni, bacon and tomatoes and a large pop.  The pizza was really good!  It took just ten minutes from the time I ordered the pizza to the time it was delivered to me.  The staff are really friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"off to a good start! Food is very tasty and well crafted. I feel like the quality ingredients they use goes a long way to making a delicious authentic tasting pizza. Would definitely come back. they are still very new as of the time I'm writing this review so I didn't mind so much that service was a little slow and the staff seemed to be in the process of training. That being said everyone was very polite and helpful and did their best. The space was a little narrow and awkward too. Not the best place to eat in at.. better for take out. I would definitely come back though."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza!!! Love it. I will be coming back for more and I highly recommend it. Margherita and Classic are my favorite so far."}
{"text":"Walked in for a take-out pizza and left a huge fan. The staff was friendly, helpful, and willing to go the extra service mile for us. As a huge fan of pizza, I was not disappointed at all with the food, and that pizza was devoured. Fast.  Overall, a great food experience."}
{"text":"Awesome concept, you can order a customized pizza or sandwich with pretty much whatever toppings you want, just check off the ingredients you want on a form and then they make it right in front of you and cook it in the oven in about 3 minutes - aka the name 180 Secondi. The pizzas look really legit, with thin crusts. I got a sandwich and was very satisfied with it. It's made with freshly baked pita bread, so it's really soft and fragrant - so good. They have gluten-free options as well :) Would definitely want to come back and try an authentic Italian pizza! Staff are very friendly as well and helpful if you are confused about the ordering process."}
{"text":"What a great spot. The pizza is great, fast, and you can pick from a lot of different toppings to make it different each time. I keep coming back to this place because the people here are so nice! The pizzas are fairly large too, so you can even get 2 servings out of it. Decor is fine, it suits the feel. There's no need for anything to decorated or fancy when everything else is so good."}
