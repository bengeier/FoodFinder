{"text":"Great jalapeno margarita!!!
And the staff is nice also, great view next to the pool and just a great over all place"}
{"text":"Was super chill.  Lots of fun.  Fun & thoughtfully crafted drinks!   Food menu is limited.  Staff is super friendly and helpful.  Clean, plenty of towels and even fun floats for use in pool.  Loved having a DJ present!   He played mostly top 40 stuff, would have loved for him to dig a little deeper in his DJ music \"bag\" and pulled out some fun & funky older stuff!  ;)  Overall, social club is a little smaller than expected, but still a fabulous time!  :) Thank you!"}
{"text":"Jay is basically the best bartender ever. He makes sure you are taken care of and is a pleasure to hang out. If you are having a gloomy day he will fill it with rainbows and sunshine. Plus chips...drinks and sun."}
{"text":"Looks like a hoppin place with warm weather! With roll up doors & private cabanas . (It's on 1st floor part of pool area at the Sheraton.) But even in cold weather is nice-they have heaters & it's quite warm. They have some specialty cocktails & of course craft beer. They have a small menu But a little bit of everything to eat. Nice large wood  picnic tables.  & games for adults to play. Everything inside during winter. I would comeback. Not to families esp. in Summer NC law kids can't be at the bar. I heard stories lol . I would recommend for a fun afternoon stop or lunch -TVs to watch the games too."}
{"text":"Great breakfast options at Craft City. Crab cake eggs Benedict was delicious. So many great flavors with the spinach and potatoes. Service was a little slow but the manager was attentive and very apologetic without my saying anything. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Jay is by far the best bartender here! He's quick, makes a mean drink and makes you feel like you've known him forever! Fun atmosphere, games and great pool parties too. I find the only downside is that the management is always hovering around the pool and look so out of place in their polyester uniforms and walkie talkies! Other than that, it's a blast!"}
{"text":"The entire staff is awesome here, special shout out to (Heather, Scott, other Scott, and Jay). Quick, attentive, and they all make one he'll of a drink! Get here, you'll love it. One hell of a place. The staff here defines the saying that the people make it a place to go and not the spacr. I will be a patron of this place as long as they remain!"}
{"text":"We went on an extremely beautiful day and didn't rent a cabana.  We were able to get plenty of lounge chairs for the group and had a good time.  But, it's really just a small-ish pool with an overcharging bar and an old-school music DJ.  Pitchers of mixed drinks are $35 with seriously no alcohol in them.  And trying to get service is like pulling teeth.  So I went up to the bar and ordered there directly--watching the bar tender put his bare, unwashed hands directly into the chopped fruit and grab handfuls to throw into the pitcher.  And, you guessed it, he didn't wash his hands after, either.  He just wiped them on the same grimy towel he had hanging from his waistband.  Good thing there were nice, shirtless abs next to that towel...  I didn't tell my friends as they were having a good time, but I'm not inclined to eat or drink anything else from this place."}
{"text":"We rented a Cabana for my girlfriends birthday in June. The service was horrible, drinks and food orders were messed up, and the tabs were messed up taking 45 minutes to correct.  The managers were extremely disrespectful and rude (especially Joe) and clearly on a power trip. Also, there was a $45 undisclosed fee that was supposedly for have a server, I thought that was what the $250 rental fee was for.  I was polite and courteous the entire time because despite the experience, the birthday girl and her friends were having fun and I didn't want to ruin that. 

  I called in several times for the following week leaving multiple messages for the Food & Beverage manager, Elise.  When she finally returned my call she offered to refund the $45 and provide a free rental in the future, before I even got to express all of my concerns.  She even indicated that the only  complaints they've had since they've opened is the service and the management. Now I'm trying to contact her to set up the free rental, and she hasn't returned my multiple messages in a week.

It's such a shame because it is a cool spot, the food was pretty good, and the drinks were tasty when the bartender remembers to add the vodka to you pitcher of mojitos."}
{"text":"I tell everyone that this is the most under-rated bar in Charlotte!

The space is HUGE with a freaking pool...how many other bars can offer that? You do not have to be a guest at the hotel to hang out by the pool during the day, there are even options to rent a cabana. Inside, there are multiple bar games and comfortable seating areas available. They have T.V.'s and the view of the city is great.

Every day they offer a special on one of their appetizers and always have great drink specials. Craft City has a full bar, but the real win is the great craft beer options on draft, they have a great selection. 

Service is always friendly and attentive--and the best part...the bartenders can validate your parking! That's right people, free uptown parking. 

I always recommend Craft City when I'm meeting friends for drinks, it doesn't get enough credit. This is not just a hotel bar...check it out!"}
