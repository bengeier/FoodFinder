{"text":"The food was good but the service is what needs improvement... We had their mixed vege and aachari paneer. We also had their tandoori platter which was very good.. So I would come here for their tandoori options rather than the food itself... A good thing is they give a complimentary mango cheese cake for the Bday person"}
{"text":"Excellent Indian food! Fast and attentive service, great quality food, fair prices, and good selection of dishes."}
{"text":"Great tasting and good quality North Indian Punjabi food! We were impressed by the presentation of the food."}
{"text":"Ambience was way above par for the average Indian Restaurant. Food was delicious, over-priced by a dollar or two, but considering the quality, didn't mind at all paying a little extra. Staff was very attentive. Enjoyed the overall experience."}
{"text":"Nice location in a busy complex. The interior of the restaurant is really nice and classy, and so it feels more of A dine in spot rather than takeout.   We ordered a paneer dish and the chicken tikka masala with garlic naan and tandoori roti. Loved the chicken dish but the paneer one was just okay. Overall though, they had a lot of fusion items on the menu so I would probably come back and try something new"}
{"text":"I had their vegetarian options since they do not serve halal (what a shame) I would be there more often if it was. Had their mattar paneer, palak paneer and dal makhni with rice it was one of the best I've had in this part of the world the dal makhni.  Decor was great nice and modern.  They had some cool items I wouldn't mind trying on their menu in the future. Great for a hidden spot.  Definitely worth a try at least for their vegetarian options."}
{"text":"My wife and I were in the mood for some classic North Indian cuisine, headed to Brampton, and found this gem right on the border.  Tucked in behind another cookie cutter Walmart consumer 'Village' on Mississauga Rd south of Highway 7.  Seems quite new, modern Decor, busy on a Friday with a few families...  Service was very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly.  Two beers on tap Erdinger and Steigl.  We ordered some appetizers, a Fish Taco (Indian version!), and Samosas with Channa.  Portions were large, flavours delicious and quality presentation as well.  The Fish Taco was 3 mini Tacos, served in little Indian flatbreads (instead of tortilla), with a nice cabbage slaw. If I could be critical of them at all, might suggest adding a bit of green chili or having some sort of a hot sauce available on the side, but they were yummy as is!  Mains were a Chicken Vindaloo, Channa Masala with Garlic Naan and Veggie Pulao, everything came out looking and smelling fantastic, flavours spot on, rich, fresh, flavourful and delicious!  Thoroughly enjoyed our experience, and we'll enjoy the leftovers they've packed up for our lunch tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Food was good but very small quantity. Service was very slow. We sat for 20 mins n no one as for drinks or water. Had to wait 1hr for order on fries. A bit expense."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. Punjabi food at its best. We ordered the butter chicken, naan, and chicken pakora. Great flavours. Service was great. Food was prepared in a very decent amount of time.  Even re-heated the next day, the flavours stuck.  Highly recommend, and will definitely be picking up some more food next week."}
{"text":"Great Indian Food! Must try: Patiala Paneer tikka and Chicken Tikka, Daal Makhni Skip: Malai Kofta  Portions are big, but so are the prices but they are totally worth it. For Carbs we ordered Tandoori Rotis and Rice, both were nice. Rotis were cooked on slow flame thus were crispy and soft at the same time.Rice was the long grain with nice aroma. The Patiala Tandoori Paneer and chicken tikka were remarkable, both were juicy and tender. with the coat of pepper and Coriander, with the side of green chutney, lime, and sweet n sour salad, all the condiments complimented the main very well.  I just found out a nice Indian restaurant in my new neighborhood."}
{"text":"Ordered a pickup. Butter chicken was real good. Sun dried tomato naan is a must as you don't get it everywhere. Staff is good too; however, beware of there sweets section. Their sweets were pathetic. I tried their gulabjamun (staff recommendation) and i think it was the worst i ever had.   REPEAT? Totally! But no more sweets for me though"}
