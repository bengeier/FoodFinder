The place is clean and the staff is friendly, a nice lunch spot."}

{"text":"Plaza Bistro Catering catered a very important corporate meeting that I held in Phoenix last month. They created a beautiful table display filled with delicious food.  A few of the attendees told me that it was some of the best catered food they had ever had. The Wild Mushroom and Artichoke Chicken entr√©e was fantastic and melted in your mouth. They were on time and took care of everything from beginning to end, there was also plenty of food for everyone to have seconds.  Overall, their service and food were excellent.

I would recommend this company to anyone needing catering services for any work or personal events.

I'll upload some pictures later."}
{"text":"I received excellent customer service from Jason at lunch today. He maintained a cool head under the pressure of the lunchtime rush. There was a question about my rewards membership and he was able to get me the answers I needed. His efficiency and pleasant demeanor made my lunchtime experience very enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Their buffalo wrap, and Tuna Melt is pretty decent. However, the Reuben left a lot to be desired. Sauerkraut was non-existent, and the pastrami was flavorless and dry. Would not order again."}
{"text":"This is is very good! I enjoyed it. The food is good. Nothing fancy. I would recommend it for a quick work lunch. Salads and soups are very good! The staff is also pretty friendly."}

{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Plaza Bistro! It's in the same office park that I work in so I just walk over and it's just so convenient. The owners are so nice and the food is amazing. The chipotle chopped chicken salad is soooooo good.  I order it pretty much every time I go there and the owner already knows what I'm gonna order. It's that good. Their sandwiches are excellent as well. They also have wifi so I like to watch my netflix while I'm eating."}
