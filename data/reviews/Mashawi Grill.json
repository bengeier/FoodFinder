{"text":"A coworker told me this place was better than Layalina, and them's fightin' words, so off I went for lunch.  Interior is nice, airy spacious, a bit loud and echoey with upstairs seating. Not exactly a cozy intimate dinner spot, still retains that fast-foody 'get in, eat, get out' atmosphere of most places on Green.  In order to get a good cross-sample I ordered the mixed grill. Wait was a solid 15 minutes, and there was a steady trickle of customers the whole time (during spring break, I imagine they will be busier during school). The menu said they had hot tea but I saw none in evidence, just a soda fountain, cold bottle drinks behind the counter, and an iced tea server.  Got the food to go and got back to the office. The chicken (shish tawook) was perfectly done, which for white meat at an understaffed restaurant (they had help wanted signs in the window) is a mark in their favor. The beef was also well done and mildly flavorful but not quite the explosion of spiciness that Layalina provides. The kufta kabob was also mild and well-cooked. Nothing was dry or tasteless, the pita bread was fresh, the two sides they give you, one was some kind of jerusalem salad that was 90% tomatoes so I passed on it after taking one bite for review purposes (yup, tomtaoey. Yuck. The things I do for you people) and the other was this odd, neon-pink pickled... something. Not cabbage, not radish, not sure what it was. Its not on the menu. I ate it anyway. It was... pickled radishy but not too strong. Serving sizes were more than enough for lunch unless you're super hungry, I was and still felt full about halfway in but it was good enough that by picking at it over the course of an hour I managed to finish everything but the pita.  The rice was a little on the oily side but good if again, not as spiced as Layalina. All in all this was a nice, freshly-cooked, healthy meal for a great price. I've heard the owners are Afghani so its possible the food is a milder form than I'm used to. Either way it was fresh, hot, tasty and a great deal for the price. I wouldn't do a dinner date here or anything but for a casual nice lunch or dinner that's not the same fast food fare, I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Super cheap, pretty good value. You can get lunch--falafel and pita--for less than $3. I got the falafel sandwich and while it was a little dry it was still tasty."}
{"text":"The food here is so good! If you haven't had shawarma before then try it here, it's authentic. The hummus is amazing too. Also, the staff is so so nice and very accommodating :) I'll definitely be recommending this place to my friends."}
{"text":"So delicious I'm from out of town I came here with some friends and we all got different food and it was all amazing. Be warned though if you don't know what Turkish coffee is look it up before you order it."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Authentic Mediterranean food that is well priced as well. Highly recommend the hummus as well as the shwerma sandwich. Conveniently located on campus with large, open seating areas."}
{"text":"Excellent food - shwarma, rice, Jerusalem salad, pickled turnips & olives - and inexpensive! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I just tried this place for the first time, and it was delicious! I had the hummus and shawarma platter with chicken. The hummus was good, the chicken was moist with nice crispy bits, and it was topped with chickpeas and some kind of spicy relish. Mmmm."}
{"text":"The Good: - Very good food. I had the chicken shawarma and fries, S.O. had the beef shawarma and the falafel. I do not typically care for Mediterranean or Middle Eastern food, but I enjoyed my meal. - It is very, very price conscious. I think our entire meal was less than $20. - Mashawi Grill has plenty of seating. There is a second level that could easily accommodate groups of 6 or more.  The Meh: - It is a little slow, but when we went, the place had just recently opened, so that might have changed.  The Bad: - I wish they would give more details about their food options on the menus. I did not know that the shawarma had pickled vegetables in it, and was surprised when I first bit into my sandwich/wrap.   Overall: - I liked it, and would recommend it to anyone that enjoys this type of cuisine, especially for how well-priced it is."}
{"text":"I love Mashawi Grill...it's tasty middle eastern food and very affordable. I usually get their (beef) shawarma and hummus plate or I make my own veggie platter with small orders of falafel, tabouli, and hummus. Service is very fast and there is plenty of seating."}
{"text":"I've tried different middle eastern restaurants in champaign and I think Mashawi is one of the best, particularly because to its decent prices and delicious food. I tried all types of food there and loved them all, particularly the lamb burger that reminds me of home. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"As a middle eastern, if this restaurant was in my home country, I'd rank it among one of the good restaurants. This place is authentic and excellent.  I hope that they keep the same level of quality."}
{"text":"I have been to Greece, eaten at Mediterranean restaurants all over the state and I have to say... This was the best hummus I have had so far. I had the chicken shawarma and had enough food left over for lunch the next day. That's a good deal for 7.99!!!! The toppings were fresh and full of spices. The pita was warm and fluffy. The rice was aromatic and perfectly cooked. But I would go back any day just for the gummed. It was creamy, balanced and prefect with the olive oil and paprika. Once you have this... Store bought will never satisfy."}
{"text":"The quality of the food was fabulous. The potions gave us enough food for a whole other meal. The service and kindness of the owner was the icing on the cake. Thank you Jameel."}
{"text":"Awesome spot. The staff was really friendly! I complicated my order by replacing rice with salad and yogurt, and they were really nice about it. Ask for hot sauce on the side, it's great! My friends had the kabse, and they said it was just like home cooking!"}
{"text":"Awesome beef shawarma! First time trying this place and it's amazing! Will definitely be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times for lunch.  First time I got the chicken shwarma plate. It was HUGE. I would not order it again just for myself. The next time, I opted for the chicken shwarma sandwich instead. It was the appropriate size, and tasted pretty good.  I will try the falafel sandwich next time."}
{"text":"There is a lot of competition for mediterranean food in Champaign but Mashawi Grill is definitely a winner.   It is a typical student oriented place with ample seating, self serving with plastic and paper utensils. Cheap options to attract more students on tight budget but all options are great for lunch or dinner. We had a falafel sandwich, yogurt salad and baba ganoush appetizer. All of these were delicious dishes. It was enough for two people. There is ample seating upstairs with a nice view if you find a table near window. The place can use some upgrade but who cares as long as they keep serving delicious food.   Great place for a quick bite which is delicious and inexpensive."}
{"text":"Lives up to the reviews. Excellent chicken shawarma. However, the things keeping this from a 5 star are:  1) no spicy shawarma 2) the veggies in salad weren't especially flavorful or fresh. I should have gotten the hummus for sure.   If you're in the mood for Mediterranean food and happen to be on campus, this place can't be beat. I know I'll be back to try that hummus."}
{"text":"Great food and good prices. They have healthier options and fried goodies and everything tastes great. Also very fast with amazing service. They were so nice and very friendly. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"First time trying Mediterranean food and I was pleasantly surprised! I tried the falafel, baklava, and schwarma. All were delicious and well seasoned- however the baklava had gotten pretty mushy by 7pm.   The place was pretty empty, but there is plenty of space and all of the food was reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I came back to campus and a friend raved about this place. LIES. The service was horrible, the food was just okay at best, and I didn't want rice, so they charged me to have more salad. I feel like that should have been free OR she should have told me!!!"}
{"text":"Food is awesome and clean! And fast service. Portion sizes are pretty reasonable as well and there are friendly employees. Has an upstairs section to be seated if it becomes too crowded downstairs. Price are also reasonable :) definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite restaurant on campus. I have lived every single thing I've tried from the menu; my favorite though, chicken twook entree with hummus instead of rice. Also recommend trying the sandwiches with sheraq (the flatbread), it is has a great texture to it."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places to eat on a budget in Champaign-Urbana area. The food is awesome, service is nice. They add complementary sides, and sometimes desserts. I like the Shawarma sandwiches and mix grill plates. The sandwiches are big enough to fill you up, while a plate is more than enough. The plate can sustain you for a full day. Prices are relatively cheap, 4.99 for sandwich and 7.99 for plates. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to enjoy a great meal on a budget."}
{"text":"Delicious food at great prices! Everything we have ordered (mostly schwarma) has been perfect. I only wish they weren't on campus so we could go more easily :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely 5-stars, wish I could give it 6! It is everything advertised in all the reviews.   Stopped by on my way back home near St Louis. Saw the review and thought it would be worth the time to stop from the interstate. It would have been worth twice the wait!  The chicken schwarma I had is really good but the lentil soup is amazing. Lots of nuanced flavor. My wife had me try her Jerusalem salad and it was also wonderful. I also stole a couple fries (seasoned, not plain) and they tasted like curly fries, but straight. My wife raved about her black bean burger and it was perfectly cooked. Not dry and nasty like some we've had elsewhere. My boys devoured the food like a pack of wolves in a famine. I didn't hear much but I think it's safe to assume that it was a hit with them too.   Typical city diner setting. You pick up the food at the counter yourself and get it on disposable plates and plastic silverware. However that keeps the price very low. I've easily paid twice as much for this much food in other diners. Added to the great taste and it's a can't-miss meal.  I live too far away to plan a return trip but if my travels ever bring me back this would be on the short list of places to eat."}
{"text":"I'll admit that I do not come here often and absolutely do not understand the appeal of Mediterranean food, but if I'm feeling the need to get healthy lunch for cheap, it's probably going to be a $3 falafel sandwich at Mashawi. It's delicious even to me, the staff is nice, and there's lots of space to sit."}
{"text":"Price and quality are the two reasons that Mashawi is above the pack. As other reviewers have mentioned, the sandwiches and entrees are affordable. Authenticity is a huge draw to Mashawi - when I want to taste real Mediterranean food, I go to Mashawi first. Their service is quick and I usually will grab their food to go. Check them out!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Mashawi for almost two years and I've yet to be disappointed.  If I'm looking for a big lunch on Green it's my go-to restaurant.  The only downside is that it can be a bit pricy depending on what you get.  Sandwiches and falafel are pretty cheap, but shawarma with hummus can be $9.00+.  Overall, though, the food is really satisfying and the people who run it are really nice.  Always a pleasure to eat there"}
{"text":"This place is great. Very reasonably prices, great portions, and delicious food. I have tried the chicken shawarma sandwich and the falafel. The chicken shawarma was great and the falafel was some of the best I've had. It was very fresh and hot, I could tell it had been made very recently. Often time with falafel it taste like its been sitting around for a while, but not here. I will definitely be returning again soon!"}
{"text":"My cousin & I ate here as it sounded good based on the other Yelp reviews & it did not disappoint! The price to portion size was fair & the staff was very kind. A large crowd poured in & ordered before we decided. We were amazed at how quickly they took care of all of us. We really enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"This place is really awesome! Great flavor, great quality, excellent customer service and very authentic meals. I've had the mixed grill entree, falafel sandwhich, shawarma and all of them were scrumptious. The only complaint is that they are pretty slow (relative to other green st places) but I hope that they will get faster as time goes on."}
{"text":"This place has plenty of great and cheap options that are relatively healthy!"}
{"text":"Food is decent, hub and I ordered chicken shawarma wrap, and I had the shawarma entree with rice veggies and fries, we also had a piece of baklava. Chicken shawarma was a bit dry, rice and fries were good. We are from Chicago and used to have the sandwich in a pita, this was a burrito style wrap. I tried the wrap, didn't like it, hubs says it was okay. I didn't like the pickles veggies, but just not a fan of pickled veggies in general. Not sure if we'd come back. Here's some pics!"}
{"text":"Amazing Levantine food for a bargain! Get any sandwich, my favorite is the kufta kabob.   Focused menu with delectable side orders.  Hummus made in house!   Good, even healthy food.  A must for those looking for a unique and cheap lunch near campus."}
{"text":"Mashawi is so underrated It makes me sad. Amazing shawarma sandwiches. Their hummus is worth buying a large and bringing home leftover (way better than buying a sabra hummus from store). Also, I know it sounds random but I think they have the best fries on campus. Overall, mashawi grill satisfies me every single time."}
{"text":"Worst place ever, the price is high and the proportion is so small that I have to go to Subway to have another sandwich. Don't trust those comments, they are lying."}
{"text":"The falafel sandwich (minus pickles) is incredibly delicious. French fries are always hot and fresh. Lunch/dinner for two is easily under $10, yet I would happily pay twice that price. Right in the heart of Campustown, sit in the window and do plenty of people watching!"}
{"text":"Really happy about this restaurant addition to Green St. Campus was lacking a good Mediterranean option for food. Mashawi Grill has very tasty shawarma and nice portions. The staff is very friendly too. I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"The price is unbeatable. You can't get anything like it for the price unless you're talking about fast food. But this is nothing like fast food. The food is so flavorful, the spices just right. Everything is fragrant. The falafel is so cute. The portions on most of the dishes are HUGE. It's great! Mashawi is excellent for the price and speed."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times since I found out about it last week, and have recommended it to others who have also loved it! I'm Turkish so I'm always looking for quality Middle Eastern or Mediterranean food and I love Mashawi.   My favorites are chicken shawarma sandwich and the regular beef/lamb shawarma sandwich (in Turkey we call them doner :) But I have many more items I want to try, especially the veggie items.  The prices are also amazing! I can easily have dinner with a friend for under $10 total, which is great on a busy evening. The owner and staff are super nice and friendly, the owner spoke a bit of Arabic with me and gave us free baklava on our first visit, which was very kind (and delicious!)  If you like Layalina, you should try out Mashawi Grill!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Satuday for lunch.  Ideal if you want to grab a quick lunch.  Not too much of a wait on Saturdays (or at least on the day I went).  Prices are around $10 if you are hungry and want an entree.  However, if you want something small, there are some options for less starting from $1.49 for soup, hummus, and etc.  Food Entrees come with pickles and salad Salad - sliced tomato & cucumbers in vinegar flavor dressing. Hummus - the entree does not come with hummus but you can order it in replace of the salad or pickles.  I would recommend ordering hummus in replace of the salad/pickles.  The pita bread/chicken just tastes better with hummus.  Chicken Shawarma entree - they are generous with the amount of food that is provided.  The chicken was slightly dry, but maybe because I went on a slow day?  The food was mediocre, but it's nice to have the option to eat mediterranean food.  Atmosphere - it's not a fancy restaurant or anything, just somewhere to go for a quick bite...more than enough seating if you are interested in going with a group of friends.  Customer Service - friendly, no complaints  I would want to check out the other restaurants on the street prior to coming back here."}
{"text":"Best shawarma on campus. Still a three star rating because I grew up in the Middle East and gorged on the best Lebanese shawarmas in Montreal. That said, I love the North American take on shawarmas- the fresh, lightly herb marinade dunked lettuce, tomatoes, purple cabbage, and cucumber. It always comes down to the meat though. And that's a 3 star one here. Still the best on campus though."}
{"text":"The guy helping us was so nice and helpful! My parents and sister were in town and we love this kind of food, so we decided to try it out. Everything was delicious. The falafel and hummus was what I got. So good! And you can't beat the prices. It got packed really fast, but the wait isn't long."}
{"text":"As a lifelong resident of Champaign-Urbana, I have seen so many levantine restaurants of different varieties come and go. Almost all of them have been plagued with at least two of the following issues: bad service, bad prices, bland food, awkward seating. I'm happy to say that Mashawi has none of these issues. The service is great and the people are friendly, the prices are some of the best on campus, the food almost always excels, and it's got a good, campus-casual atmosphere. The portion sizes are huge, too.  Everyone I know seems to love Mashawi, so I imagine it will be the first restaurant in this location to stick around ofr a while."}
{"text":"I trekked to Mashawi in the cold and got there at about 4PM. The doors were closed and there was no one inside. It was Sunday so I thought I got the hours wrong and settled for Potbelly down the street. However, it clearly states that the restaurant is open till 10PM even on Sunday. So, what the heck? You are ruining your business by being closed 6 hours before closing time. Not to mention, you're irking your customers. Three stars only because the food is actually great when the restaurant is open."}
{"text":"Loved the food! I was pretty sad when another Mediterranean restaurant shut down but this one right in the middle of hustle bustle of green street is awesome! The food tasted real good the only problem I faced was slow service, I had to wait about 20-25 mins before my food was ready and the place wasn't even busy at the time. But hey, it was well worth the wait."}
{"text":"We stumbled into the doors of Mashawi Grill after a hectic scramble across downtown Champaign...during a rain storm. But let me back up...we were on our way home from a college visit in Grinnell, Iowa. I really didn't want any fast food, so we looked to Champaign for some good eats. I wanted to try this Chinese place with 1,364 menu items (1,364!) but my mom wasn't in the mood. So, we tried to go to Maize Mexican Grill. After finally finding it and struggling to park, we went in and found that it was completely full. We decided we couldn't eat it in the car, so we tried to go to El Charro across the street, but they didn't have a parking lot. Keep in mind this was all during monsoonal rain. So, Mashawi Grill it was.   Sorry for all the backstory, but I wanted to set up just how bedraggled we were upon entering this restaurant. We were hustled into line and ordered quickly in the loud, hectic space, before shambling upstairs with our trays and finally sitting down. Interesting note: because all of their tables are large, you will most likely be popping a squat with some total strangers. But hey, as long as the food's good, right?  And it was. I had the shish tawook, which came with two kinds of rice. Both kinds of rice were delicious (one was bright yellow and mild, the other orange and spicy). The meat itself (chicken) was rubbed in a lovely spice mix as well. The meat my dad had in his dish (shawarma?) was better, however. Everything came with pita bread as well, for sandwiching or dipping.  I'd probably give 4.5 if I could. Wonderful flavors. Not quite enough for a 5 though...maybe if it had been a little less stressful getting the food and getting it all up to an available seat. It was cheap, though...cheapest Mediterranean food we've had in a long time. I'd come back if I lived in Champaign...then again, we passed so many authentic hole-in-the-wall Korean joints on the way here that it'd be tough to ever go somewhere more than once!"}
{"text":"I was so happy to discover that the UIUC campus has a mediterranean restaurant on campus! I have walked by this place countless times and hadn't ever given it a second look until a friend recommended I try it.   The food comes out quickly and is not very expensive! They give you decent portion sizes and the meat is excellent. The hummus doesn't have a huge flavor to it, but I really liked that since I was pairing it with the shawarma meat.    The employees are friendly and there is a huge seating area upstairs, looks like it would be great for a big group!   If you haven't given this place a try, I definitely recommend you stop in. This place is fast casual and will happily make your oder to go if you need. Also, they just started using the Hooked app, so check out their deals on there!"}
{"text":"Having been there once during the Winter time, I have to say upfront that you are in danger of freezing your feet off when you are seated remotely close to their entrance. Well, maybe I just had a particularly bad day back then.  As for the food, most of it is lying around buffet style behind some glass which I generally dislike due to the fact that I just dislike food that lies around for ages (duh).  Long story short: I had some kind of beef served with rice and vegetable. The vegetables tasted like they had been lying around the salad bar for quite some time (which they had, evidently) and the rice was already getting a little cold. The food itself is served on some cheap plastic plates - which is acceptable if you buy some food from some stand on a country fair, but not when dining in an actual restaurant. Apart from the way the food is served, the overall food tastes somewhat bland and could use some spicing up.   Being used to high-quality Middle Eastern food from where I come from, I consider the food at Mashawi Grill to be at the lower end of this culinary spectrum. I guess if you haven't been exposed to that kind of cuisine before, you actually might find the food there likable because of the new experience - but I personally cannot recommend going there."}
{"text":"This is the only Mediterranean place on campus I know of and it is delicious. The falafel sandwich which is really a wrap is always my go to. I tend to get either a Jerusalem salad or side of hummus to go with it to put on as an extra topping. I have never had a bad experience coming here"}
{"text":"Great shish kabob and falafel. Can't go wrong with any of the dishes. Meats are cooked perfectly, portions are generous, and prices are more than fair. Rice is on point!! Casual, relaxed atmosphere. In all honesty, Green Street really needed a place like this. Will be coming back often."}
{"text":"Quick view: Incredible value and immensely flavorful. A must for your next lunch break.   Super generous portions of delicious food at an affordable price.   Friendly staff. Clean dining area.   Longer review:  This place is a perfect counter-service lunch joint. You can easily pop in and pop out. No fiddling with receipts or social pressure to tip. In fact, you only get your receipt upon request and can elect to toss your change in an unobtrusive tip jar. Food comes out quickly and is always super fresh. Even that extra pita you asked for last minute will be nice and toasty.   Did I mention it was an amazing value?! You can get 12 falafel for under $5. You can get any dinner plate for under $15, and any sandwich for under $10. Portions are very generous. For how reasonable the prices are, you may feel compelled to over order. Don't. You can get totally stuffed for $5-10 here. E.g. Sandwich with soup   The food is fantastic. Very flavorful and fresh. Nice presentation despite the quick service. The hummus is delicious and beautifully presented with some while garbanzos in the middle, a drizzle of evoo, and a sprinkling of sumac. The plates come with rice and pickled veggies.   If you choose to dine in, there is extra seating upstairs, although it hasn't been too crowded the times I've gone.   If you're a fan of zorbas or Jerusalem, give this place a try.   Literally no complaints."}
{"text":"I always say I like to be surprised. Mashawi Grill accomplished this with their friendly staff and delicious food. I'm a huge fan of Mediterranean food and at first I was worried I would not like their food, but as soon as I set food in the restaurant I could sense the authentic feeling inside the restaurant. I had a Greek salad and a side plate of Homus with pitta bread. Also, their cheap prices are very atractivo for students in the university. The place could have more light, or more places for a small group of people to sit in, but I guess if you're going with a large group you'll always find a place to sit."}
{"text":"I ate here again. Couldn't resist. This time I got the Baba Ganoush and Chicken shawarma sandwich. Incredible. Maybe even better than the falafel sandwich (but really tough call). The only thing I wish they had was Sriracha at all the tables but that is really minor."}
{"text":"Price was good and food. Food was average and would not be rated as well in a major city as there are much better options, but for Urbana champaign there isn't much options. I would come here again."}
{"text":"I've eaten here enough times that Mashawi is well overdue for my five star review.  Forgot my lunch?  Better go to Mashawi.  Bad day?  Mashawi time.  Literally can't even?  Looks like I'm getting Mashawi.  I would say that it's a safe place to eat again and again, but the word \"safe\" doesn't give the food enough credit.  It is delicious and fresh every time I go.  I love their baba ghanoush!  Oh, and they're fast.  And you can get food that has vegetables and isn't fried.  #1 place to get lunch on Green Street every dang time."}
{"text":"I write this amidst a food coma. I went here today for a quick and cheap bite as per a recommendation from yelp. I have to say this place is a diamond in the rough of Champaign. I got the falafel sandwich for 2.99 and  shawarma sandwich for 4.99. This was an amazingly large portion of food and it was so good. This will definitely be a top place for a good quick bite to eat. Highly recommended that everyone should try!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  I had the chicken shawarma wrap.  It was delicious and only $5.   My small order of 6 falafel for $2 was perfect to share with my friend.  I did  wish they gave me more sauce.  We sat upstairs.  The view is great to people watch while eating.  I didn't have room for the baklava today, but I will be back!"}
{"text":"A great lunch place that was reco'd by a UofI student.  What looked like an unassuming converted bar had delicious food!  We had the chicken swarma sandwich and a side of falafel.  The sandwich was a wrap and came built with pickles, which we found unusual but they somehow worked with the roti chicken and yogurt sauce.  The falafel was the hero-- perfectly crisp and nutty with a great yogurt dipping sauce.  A no nonsense place for a good meal-- fast and at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Amazing shawarma and kebab sandwiches for $5 or less. There are also entree plates that cost $8 and have lots of food. Mashawi is located on Green St close to campus. I usually find myself eating here once or twice a week. And the fries are great, better than McDonald's for sure. I recommend this place, especially if you like Mediterranean/Arabian food."}
{"text":"Wonderful, inexpensive Middle Eastern food provided by a very nice family.   Mashawi Grill has a relatively simple menu, with sandwiches/wraps (super cheap!), entrees, and sides.  The pita are delicious, the food much higher quality than you'd expect for the price, and the ambiance super casual. You can get two entrees, with drinks, for $17.50, or a sandwich for $5.  Such a good deal!   The shish tawook (grilled spiced chicken with rice, salad and pita) is fantastic, as is the shwarma and hummus platter (served with lots of bread!).    Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Delicious shwarma sandwhich!  Going to have to go back and try some other dishes too."}
{"text":"The kabobs and shawarma are delicious. The meat is cooked tender and crisp with generous portions. Their falafel is great too."}
{"text":"good food for the price. the portion is also pretty good. the $2.99 falafel sw or $4.99 meat sw are more than filling, even for an active person with a big appetite like me."}
{"text":"One of the better options in champaign. Reasonably priced, fresh and tastes home made.  The falafel were a bit dry, but they are hard to get right. Great tasting pita breads.  Great tasting rice.  Good selection of drinks.  Great wraps.  Two level of seatings. If you sit upstairs you can sit by the window and look out.  They even have traditional mediterranean desserts.  The workers here seem a bit out of it, but i am sure standing there all day can get boring. They look like students who are working park time."}
{"text":"I ate here 2 days ago and I'm still thinking about it. I got the beef shawarma entree and it was delicious! My boyfriend got the entree that sampled all the meat options and it too was delicious. The cold salad was crisp and fresh and the rice had a great consistency.   The woman behind the counter was really polite and the cook wandering around seemed chipper and happy to see us. The only reason it's not 5 stars is because the super casual, cafeteria vibe. Eating surfaces were a little messy from the constant flow of hungry students so it wasn't so much a dinning experience as a grab-and-go type of joint. Also, parking on campus can be really irritating.   Regardless of the 2 *minor* downsides, this place left a lasting impression. I'm excited to get back soon!"}
{"text":"I will absolutely be back to Mashawi. The place is clean, spacious, and you seriously cannot beat the prices. The upstairs seating is also pretty cool.   The food is tasty and the portion size is good, I definitely got a bang for my buck. I do feel that the flavors are a little watered down, they went for more of a mass appeal than to truly do justice to Middle Eastern food, but seriously, for the price, its worth it.   Great additional to Green St, I'd be happy to go back."}
{"text":"Tasty, incredibly affordable, and they have Mexican cokes!  I ordered the chicken shawama for lunch. A little too much white sauce for my liking, and they used a wrap instead of a pita, which was unexpected but I didn't mind. The prices were great. I went on the third day that they were open, and the wait was much too long--about 20 minutes. I expect that it's probably gotten better by now.   I'll definitely be back. I'm happy this is on Green Street. Staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Tried this place for lunch yesterday.  It's in the old Qdoba location, but since I rarely venture on campus unless school is out, I didn't know Mashawi Grill had replaced it.  Ordered Chicken Shawarma entree ($7.95), which came with yellow and orange rice, 2 pieces of very dry pita bread, a tomato/cucumber mix, and some lettuce and picked veggies that were inedible.  Also ordered a 6-pc order of falafel. ($1.99)  I thought the shawarma was very dry and lacking in flavor, and combined with the pita bread I was really wishing that I had ordered some hummus with it.   One of my dining companions ordered the same but with a side of hummus, and he said that it definitely made the dish better.  The falafel was by far the best part of the lunch, but I think Layalina's are a bit better.  Still, for $2 it was pretty good.  It was average, but I probably won't make a special trip to campus for it."}
{"text":"Tasty options at reasonable prices. The lamb burger was excellent. If I were still in Champaign, I would definitely make it a regular stop."}
{"text":"I had one of my best buds down for the weekend and he loves Mediterranean food almost as much as I do, so naturally I had to suggest the new Mashawi Grill since I had such a good experience there last time.  This time was just as good and my roommate even tagged along to try it for himself!  We got 2 orders of the chicken shawarma , a lamb kabob and some falafel. The flavor of the chicken was spot-on, the tomato/cucumber salad was really tasty and the other various pickled items were also very delicious. I particularly like the very liberal use of spices in this cuisine, especially mint!  The portions were huge, one entrée is more than enough for a single person and we found ourselves struggling to finish everything. The falafel is also a really good deal, only about $0.50 per piece and not only are they huge, but so very delicious with the dipping sauce.  Can't really complain about the price, it's pretty fair.  My only minor gripe would be that the food comes out a little slow, we waited about 10 minutes for our food and my roommate's lamb kabob took over 15. Perhaps they need some more hands in the kitchen?  Still a really awesome choice on campus for Mediterranean fare, I'll be back again for sure."}
{"text":"This place started off great. It was the talk of the town. Their shawarma's were very good and filling as welll as their lamb chops.  But, what attracted me to the place was their Greek Salad with Gyro meat. They served it perfect at the start but over time their quality deteriorated with nothing but lettuce in the salad and finely chopped onions. Very disappointed. I hope they revisit their quality policy or like many other places in its location, Mashawi would be history soon."}
{"text":"I had a shawerma sandwich and it was pretty meh. It would be nice if they listed all the toppings that are in their entrees. There was something in there that I didn't enjoy so much. It also took an inordinate amount of time for my friend to get his simple burger order."}
{"text":"on campus location. great prices for large amounts of delicious food. excellent menu full of yummy Mediterranean food.   lot of wraps, but they call them sandwiches. they are a tad bit sweet for some reason, but most people will find them good. i prefer spicy hot.   we had shish tawook (chicken kebab), falafel wrap/sandwich, chicken shawarma wrap/sandwich. the tawook comes with pickled veggies, salad, two kinds of rice  and lot of grilled chicken pieces. the chicken was very good, not dry at all.   the wraps were delicious.  the main problem is the wait. it took us 25 mins+ to get 2 wraps and tawook. in the mean time they served over 10 orders that came after us. my tawook was prepared and sitting on the counter waiting for 15 mins the falafel wrap to be ready. that was the terrible part of our experience. i keep thinking if i got the tawook plate as soon as it was ready, how much more delicious it would have been.   amazingly low prices, great for students.   will definitely go back for more. but if i have to wait for more than 10 mins for a lunch order, im walking out."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here while we were traveling across the state. Quick service. Friendly employees. Wonderful food with good sized portions."}
{"text":"Had the chicken shawerma entree, $7.99 and came with a generous amount of chicken and rice along with pitas.  I agree with other person that some sauce on the side would have made it even better. Maybe five stars if I had a sauce.  Looks nice inside, food was ready fast. Can't tell this used to be Qdoba."}
{"text":"This is my favorite middle eastern restaurant their food always fresh, and their prices is responsible."}
{"text":"We were on campus and hungry.  I talked my husband and stepson out of BBQ to try this place that had nice reviews on Yelp.  My husband had the hummus/shawarma plate that he enjoyed.  My stepson had the lamb burger with fries.  The burger was tiny on the bun and although he didn't complain, I know he was disappointed.  I had the falafel sandwich that was actually a wrap, which was amazing.  I would go back just for this (hence the 4 stars).  The fries were not fresh cut, which is what I expect from a mediterranean place, and the white sauce I got for the fries was not good.    It is an order-at-the-counter-come-back-for-pick-up type of place.  The upstairs dining area is roomy, with a tv, and a view of the street.  The kid at the counter was nice."}
{"text":"Nice place, especially with the second floor. As a middle easterner, the food tasted pretty good and is worthwhile. It can be enjoyed for all different people and is priced fairly well"}
{"text":"I love middle eastern cuisine, it is so full of flavors. I have been eating at Mashawi from long, but don't know why still had not reviewed it. Well, it's better late than never. It's the kind of place you go, when you want to eat good food at reasonable price in not so fancy restaurant. Till now, I have tried soup, chicken shawarma, falafel, hummus, lamb chops and baklava. The only thing which I did not like was lamb chops. The meat was too chewy and dry, although the seasoning tasted wonderful. So, I would suggest to avoid lamb chops. Rest everything tastes so good."}
{"text":"This place is so yummy! I went here for lunch and got the Kukfta Kabob and it has minced lamb, onions and other spices. It comes with rice, salad and pita bread. The minced lamb was so flavorful, and they give you two rice options as  well. Also got a side of baba ganoush which contains eggplant and tahini. This was so delicious and tasted smokey and creamy! It all tasted really fresh and the service was quick and friendly. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Restaurant review Finally a restaurant to rave about. It truly is a 5 star based on taste and price. By no means is this the best restaurant, but when you compare around with other choices you can't go wrong with Mashawi Grill. I somehow missed this new restaurant when it opened a while back, but it was recommended by Israeli friends as the best Mediterranean food in Champaign along with authentic falafel. It was very easy to order off the menu and no line during the weekend lunch hour. The food did not take long to get unlike other similar restaurants and the staff were very friendly. Prices are simply amazing for the type of food you get. I ended up with the 10 dollar mixed grill that had a little bit of everything. Menu to be uploaded soon. The chicken kabobs were moist and very flavorful. They give you two types of seasoned rice and two types of salads as well. The only thing missing was tahini sauce or the yogurt sauce which would go well with this combo. Plus you get a pita that you can put all of your food in! I actually forgot to order the falafel and had to go back a second time. Somehow the freshness and flavor is unbeaten by any other falafel I have ever had. Soft, not too greasy, and well balanced in flavor. I could eat these all day long. Plus for 2 dollars you get 6! I hope this place stays at this level of perfection because I will be back!  Pros: Fresh Mediterranean food, inexpensive, fast service, friendly employees. Best falafel in Illinois!  Cons: No hummus, tahini or yogurt sauce to go with the entrees which makes it a bit dry.  Hidden deals: Sandwich only cost around 5 dollars with 2 dollars more for drinks/fries  Health code rating: B, looks clean but the one health inspection was so so on food temperature. http://champaign.il.gegov.com/champaign/estab.cfm?facilityID=2213"}
{"text":"It was the first time I have ever tried Mediterranean food. That being said, I thought that the food here was brilliantly done and was cheap for the price. It was very flavorful and there was plenty of it to keep you filled. There is plenty of seating and free Wi-Fi for customers. I would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Wow! I was really surprised by the cheap prices, and even more surprised at how good it tasted. I had the Chicken Shawrma sandwich and it was absolutely delicious. Wait was a little long, but that was because I went before they were officially opened. Staff was nice, and I'm sure service is faster now. Will be checking them out again soon. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"We tried mixed kebob and it was really good. It has chicken and two types of lamp kebobs. Lamb burger is yammi too. If you look for a Halal food, I recommend here."}
{"text":"Extremely reasonable prices, generous portions, and friendly staff. It's always been easy to strike up a conversation or joke around with the cashiers, especially with the owner! The food is distinct in its roots and is friendly to the Asian acquainted/familiar palette. Initially I was hesitant to try anything from the menu, but I've come to find myself continuously going back for its consistent quality and great service. Now I'm eager to try everything.   If you're hungry, go for a platter. I'm a fan of their sandwiches, which is really more of a crisp burrito!"}
