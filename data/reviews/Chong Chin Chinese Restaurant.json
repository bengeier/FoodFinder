{"text":"I had shrimp lo-mein. There was less shrimp than I expected and the lo-mein was dry. It was about what you'd expect from Panda Express. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Really the best local Chinese within a 5 mile radius.  The Rest of the other Chinese in Harrisburg is not very good at all,  below average."}
{"text":"Fantastic service and food. The chicken curry is the best I've ever had. Get in here and eat!"}
{"text":"Consistent service and decent quality at good price. This is our go-to when we are in the mood for some fast Chinese. Typical order includes something like general tso's chicken, chicken and broccoli, sweet and sour chicken, Kung pao chicken.  All good, flavorful and decent quality. The steamed dumplings are fantastic. Dine-in service is friendly, the restaurant is clean. Delivery is always quick! Can't go wrong here if you're just looking for a typical Chinese dinner"}
{"text":"I have lived less than 5 miles from this restaurant and had never dined there before. I placed a takeout order and received it in a reasonable amount of time. What i failed to do was check it before leaving the restaurant. The fried wings that I order were over cooked so I called ahead an and asked that they replace them. The woman at the counter informed me that I have to tell them how I prefer my chicken because some people like it extra crispy. I told her the replacement looked fine. She then commented \"you ate most of the rice\" I then asked for a full refund. I told her how rude she was and she then pointed to a family dining inside and said they like it here they eat here all the time. I shook my head and told her she proved my point. After an unnecessary back and forth i was able to get a full refund. Never again will I attempt to eat there."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  My husband and I have been looking for delicious Chinese food around the University/Harrisburg area. I am so glad we finally found it. Both times we went this week it was nearly empty but I noticed that in the 30 minutes we were there they had around 15 take out orders. I have tried the crab rangoons, General Tso chicken, honey sesame chicken, and sweet and sour chicken. Everything was great. The portions were huge, meat was good quality, and the prices were cheap. Service was awesome as well. We will be adding this in our rotation of dinner spots. :)"}
{"text":"I admit it...I'm spoiled by the no longer there other Chinese restaurant in Harrisburg.  The Sesame Chicken is cooked perfectly, all white meat option is there and the sauce isn't super thick and just, well, gross.  I'm not sure how they mess it up, but the sauce has an \"okay\" flavor I suppose, but it's so thick...I just can't seem to enjoy the dish

Our waitress was very friendly and our glasses never got empty.  I like the idea of the fried wontons as the for-every-table appetizer/snack.  The duck sauce they have is pretty good. 

I won't make a trip back to the 'Burg for this dish for sure, but I'd go back with others if invited."}
{"text":"good hot food.  They are a little skimpy on the veggies.  but that is how most Americans like their Chinese food.
I think it is great the kids are working in the family business.  They have no problems altering an order if you want something different"}
{"text":"Chong Chin is a good as it gets!! I love that they serve most all of their dishes are family style. It allows for easy sharing of meals and the ability to try lots of different dishes in one sitting. My favorite dishes are their Mei Fun and Fried Dumplings. The spring rolls and egg rolls are a favorite too!"}
{"text":"Wouldn't even rate it if i could! I didn't even try the food because the customer service was horrible!! They lady over the phone treated me so rude and with a bad attitude like I was bothering her trying to order... So didn't get my money bad customer service, you can keep your service!!!"}
{"text":"Great prices and good food. It won't be the best Chinese food you ever have, but definitely won't be the worst."}
{"text":"I love their fried wings and chicken broccoli shrimp combo however last time I was in there we asked for ketchup for our child's food and they brought us McDonalds ketchup packets. What!?! Class up folks."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was quick. I wanted to order soup. I asked what the house special soup was. The server said...I don't know. She didn't offer to go find out. JUST I don't know. Maybe I expected too much."}
{"text":"Good food, somewhat overpriced for the amount of food--9.50 for General Tso chicken with fried rice and a spring roll. Meat in the fried rice is $2 extra. Chicken wings are a little bland and can be fried hard. I will eat there again though for the location."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout. The restaurant was empty and not very appealing but they had several other orders along mine. This isn't you go to Chinese spot but will order from here again when we are craving some fried rice. The food was decent."}
{"text":"BLUF: Good value.

The food was not the best, but also far from the worst Chinese I have had.  For the price, $5 for a lunch plate with a standard entree, rice and a Spring roll, the value was pretty good.

I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Good price, good and quick service. I have been several times and haven't had a complaint once."}
{"text":"This was our go to Chinese restaurant when we lived in Harrisburg and we still try to make it whenever we are in the area. They are your typical mom and pop shop, and the family who owns it knows how to take care of their customers. The food is always consistent and tasty. We've been eating here for close to 10 years now and each time the food comes out excellent. Our favorite is the honey walnut chicken and shrimp lo mein extra spicy. Don't forget the egg rolls! My favorite are the spring rolls."}
{"text":"Food is great, and combos are much better for the price. Friendly family run business. Also fast service on pick ups and call ins."}
{"text":"Since my parents have moved to the Charlotte area, I have been looking for a Chinese restaurant similar to the great Chinese food that we had up north, and I definitely found it here. Chong Chin is a great little hole in the wall Chinese restaurant that delivers very good food for very little money.

Appearance: When looking for a good Chinese restaurant, just like a good BBQ place, you really don't want to go somewhere that is trying to be fancy or trendy if you want to get good food. The d√©cor of this place was kind of cheap and tacky and they had some popish Asian music playing. However like I said these are not bad things and the place practically screamed good Chinese food. Add to this that everything was very clean and well taken care of. 

Service: Going in for lunch can be hit or miss with restaurants and this was defiantly a hit. I was greeted almost immediately at the door, and my order taken promptly. While there were only two other people in the restaurant the one server who was on duty did not slack off and food was delivered quickly and my glass was refilled as soon as it was empty.

Food: Besides the things mentioned above two things made me confident in the food before I even ate it. 1. When I walked in the staff that were on break were eating the restaurants food. 2. When the server walked into the kitchen to place the order I heard them talk to the kitchen staff in Chinese. I ordered the lunch special with general tso's chicken (basically what we call general gau's chicken up north) which ended up costing me $5.30 including tax and came with fired rice and a spring roll. The sauce was a little over cooked and the peas a bit starchy, but overall it far spaces some of the sickly sweet stuff that other trendier Chinese restaurant are selling for $8-12, and for only fiveish dollars it was more than a generous serving and filled me up well.


Overall, if you get the craving for Chinese food like I did skip out on the overpriced trendy places and the so so chain restaurants and give this place a try."}
{"text":"Lipstick stains on drink cup. 
Food was average. 
Service was horrible. 
They sent their child out several times to see if we needed anything. The boy was probably 11 or 12 years old. He provided better/ kinder service than the adults. 
We had to ask for refills everytime we needed one, and usually had to wait several minutes for help to come around. When we would ask for a refill the lady acted very annoyed. 
Very disappointed with our visit. 
We used to come here more when food and service was slightly better. Probably won't be coming back."}
