{"text":"This place is amazing. The food is fantastic and quick. And it's great value for the price. I'm so glad they came to the meadowood area."}
{"text":"Everything we've had so far is delicious and well-priced. Especially the burrito w pastor and chimichangas. Specials are good as well. Kind owners and a good place for a sit down meal or for take out. Also have paletas and pastries in the store.

Update: Taco Tuesday $1 beef tacos! Yum."}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh food.  Very nice staff - helpful.  Tacos were delicious - I especially liked the chicken and Pastor with all the extras.  The bakery looked incredible - will definitely order a cake there for our next occasion."}
{"text":"Got takeout from this new local Mexican restaurant in the Meadowood strip mall on Raymond Rd. Delicious! Reminds me of Taqueria de Guadalajara on Park St. Authentic Mexican food. Pork tacos were sweet, almost like BBQ pulled pork meat, steak meat tacos were not strips like fajitas but rather had a ground beef look to them (but were steak). Tamales were pretty good, nice meat to masa ratio; rice was chicken flavored, no tomato base at all like traditional Mexican rice. Beans were great. Thick with a little queso cheese on top. Enchiladas only come one way, chicken and cheese; had ours with verde sauce. They give you verde sauce for the tacos - not sure if there is a red sauce or salsa; didn't try the guacamole, will next time. Tacos are two corn tortillas each with onions and cilantro. Will go again!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! I live close by and have eaten here multiple times. Everything I've ordered has been delicious. Just wish they had chips and salsa but being that they are brand new it may be coming."}
{"text":"Great new addition to the Meadowood /  Jamestown neighborhood.  I have had takeout 3 times and it has always been great! Looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"I ordered a round tres leches cake for a birthday party. OMG it was so good, I kept half that cake and gave the other half to the birthday girl. The owner was great to work with. I placed the order with only two days' notice and arranged a pick up on a holiday! That surprised me, but how convenient! 
I've eaten here several times since they've opened. They have pan dulce and on some days, you can buy a bag of day-old pan dulce at a reduced price. My co-workers love the Taco Tuesday specials, the breakfast platters, and they say the coffee is pretty good too."}
{"text":"The reviews for this place are spot-on. Myself and 4 others ate here last Saturday night, and we all loved our food. We definitely plan on going back!

Several of my dining companions really wanted to try out the mole sauce, and they unsurprisingly thought it was fantastic. Whether it was smothered on enchiladas or a plate of chicken, it worked for everyone who tried it.

I tried the chicken enchiladas with green sauce, and was really happy with it. The enchiladas were filled with well-seasoned chicken, and the green sauce (which is less spicy than the other options) was delicious. After devouring those, I mixed the leftover green sauce with my rice, and it was a nice finish to my meal. The tamales were also very good.

All of the bakery items were extremely tempting, but we were all too full to even consider eating a bite more. Perhaps next time!

The restaurant space itself is cozy, clean and overall seemed quite nice. Staff members were also great, and our food arrived quicker than we anticipated.

Despite being a bit of a drive for us, we were all very pleased with our trip to Los Atlantes. Based on this first visit with friends, I definitely feel comfortable with giving it a recommendation."}
{"text":"Mexican is not my favorite cuisine and I normally do not give/would not give five stars to a Mexican restaurant. But this little mom-and-pop place on Raymond Road is absolutely outstanding. The ambience is not great but it is very clean and efficient. What steals the show is the wonderful cooking of the owner. I have eaten there twice, the second time I did take out. I was so impressed by the original pork tacos that I had the first time that I came back and ordered three dinners plus a side of two pork tacos for me and a friend. The total was only about $34 and we had a lot left over to eat the next day. Everything was extremely nicely done and tasty. But I have to say it was the mole sauce  that stole my heart. It was just extraordinary. I have had it many times over the last 50 years.  I've made it myself and my son-in-law has made it. This was just about the best mole sauce I've ever had.  It had an amazing depth of flavor, very complex.  I don't remember a better one.  
If you want real homemade Mexican created with heart by the owner come here for eat in or take out.  They have daily specials but I think you could get the mole every day.  The pork tacos are exceptionally tasty and juicy.  Don't hesitate to go and be adventuresome with what you order."}
{"text":"This morning my wife and I stopped in and each ordered a \"breakfast burrito. I ordered a mole sauce with mine. Excellent food, The staff and owner were friendly and served us promptly.WE are planning a return for dinner. We live in Orchard Ridge close by.  Stop in ,order and thank these folks for giving us a new choice since Feilers and Piccasos closed."}
{"text":"Would have given them a 5 if they didn't forget the beans and rice. The food is excellent. Tamales are delicious and moist not like most other restaurants that are dry and crumbly. Had the steak and lengua tacos and they were both good. The chimichanga was also delicious with a melted cheese sauce on top. Hope more people discover this hidden gem."}
{"text":"Support this restaurant!  The food is delicious and the staff (owner) is wonderful.  We had the tacos but everything looked great.  The prices are very reasonable. I will be back and I will tell everyone about this gem."}
{"text":"My husband, granddaughter and I had dinner here this evening.  She was delighted to find they served Platillo de Borrego (a lamb dish), my husband had lengua (tongue) enchiladas and I had Los Atlantes tacos - 1 shrimp, 1 chorizo, and 1 lamb.  All the dishes were accompanied by rice and beans.  They also had a hibiscus drink.  The only dish I would suggest skipping was a rather strange flan.  It was very dense.  The rice pudding was tasty.  Service was prompt and pleasant.  We all gave it a thumbs up and said we would return."}
{"text":"Delicious, cheap Mexican food! The burrito, chimichanga, and nachos were really good, but I think the tacos really shined. They were simple with only meat, onion, and cilantro. Add a squeeze of lime and you're set."}
{"text":"Had a few tacos and a chimichanga and the food was excellent, arrived quickly, and was cheap. I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This place is 100% a staple for us and they make my favorite el pastor tacos in town. The food comes out fast and the woman who works the counter is so sweet! 

We've also had their guac which is always made fresh and they have two killer sauces a red and a green which we can't get enough of. 

We are so happy that this little gem is tucked in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here for carry out and were not disappointed. Our food (enchiladas and a burrito) was packaged really well and so tasty. I had the el pastor enchiladas and they came with rice and beans and a choice of red or green sauce. I had the green. They were delicious. The beef burrito was equally as good and no skimping on the beef. We also had chips and salsa...we chose the red salsa and they warned us it was the hotter of the two. It was definitely hot, but really good. A little bonus is they have Mexican bakery also. We did not get anything, but things looked really good. The woman that waited on us was very friendly and talkative. Another local place that I hope does well. Stop by, give them some business!"}
