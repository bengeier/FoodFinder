{"text":"First off, let me say the food is delicious, five star level BBQ!  Rated two stars because I ordered the brisket meat plate at $16.99 and my wife ordered the brisket sandwich at $10.99.  Guess what?  The sandwich had just as much brisket as the plate.  The only difference between the two was the plate came with an extra side and one less slice of toast.  That's it for an extra $6.00.  RIPOFF!!!  Morale of the story is save some money by ordering a sandwich instead of a plate!  I was so happy to have great BBQ nearby but this left such a bad taste in my mouth that I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Very new establishment... and it shows. We showed up around 7:30 on a Saturday night & they were already out of chicken, ribs, sausage & brisket! Luckily we weren't there so much for the food as we were for the live band & drinks. Unfortunately after seating ourselves, we waited for about 15-20 min before we realized that no one is going to serve us. My husband went to the bar and asked if we had a waitress & got us our first round. She sent someone over who took our order and we shared the pulled pork fries. The food was really good & plenty to share. We never did get offered additional drinks so we went back up to the bar each time we wanted another. Seems that the wait staff are also the bartenders?? No one knew who was waiting on which tables. Hopefully, they will get the kinks worked out soon or they may not last with so many other great options in the area."}
{"text":"Great BBQ. The catfish was awesome.   Love the atmosphere. Met the owner and his son.  Wonderful people."}
{"text":"West Alley BBQ at Chandler is legit Tennessee BBQ. Since we moved from TN to Chandler, we have been searching for real TN BBQ (where they put cole slaw ON the sandwich, not make you order it as a side) and have finally found it. We had pulled pork and brisket, both smoked to perfection. And since they use pork butt instead of shoulder it's not greasy.  It beats all the BBQ places in the area. Christian, the owner is outgoing and actually from TN so he knows his stuff. He gave us a tour of their pit and for a true BBQ lover, it is awfully pretty!!"}
{"text":"One and done.  Meh ambiance, meh service, meh product.  Went for lunch today (Saturday) and the place was out of brisket, out of turkey, out of sausage and had just gotten a shipment of ribs, otherwise they'd have been out of ribs, too. Should've known to leave at that point but stayed to try the ribs, which were NOT fall-off-the-bone tender, very syrupy and chewy.

Here's 6 reasons not to waste your time or money at West Alley BBQ: 

San Tan Flat
Blue 32
Rudy's
Cheddar's
Can't Stop Smokin'

All with far superior food, much better service and value.

Sorry West Alley, you don't measure up to the better rib houses in town.  If you don't get your act together soon I'm afraid you won't make it in the east valley."}
{"text":"Great BBQ in downtown Chandler! Very attentive, friendly staff. Outstanding ribs...sauce was marvelous and the side dishes of coleslaw and baked beans made the perfect compliment!"}
{"text":"Wow.  Best bbq ever had.  Brody is phenomenal server and Tyler the bartender is rocking   Had the loaded fries with brisket.  Absolutely best brisket ever."}
{"text":"Sooo, the mgr Greg is far from customer friendly! Our order was wrong, he acted like it was our fault.  Plopped our correct order on the table & walked away smug & laughing.  We didn't eat it I. Fear we'd be poisoned.  
Tyler our bartender was AWESOME!!! He's the only reason to come for any typified good service!!"}
{"text":"My husband I just attended an event at West Alley BBQ and everything was delicious. The pork nacho's were amazing and the bbq beans were so delicious. They have a bar in the back and a stage where the have live music. We will be definitely be back to bring the rest of our family."}
{"text":"The food and service was amazing! Loved the music also. Thx for an awesome tuesday night West Alley"}
{"text":"New to the area and came in on a recommendation and absolutely loved this place! The BBQ eas excellent! Our server Brody really made us feel welcome and was very attentive:) We will definitely be returning for more great food and music!"}
{"text":"The best fish fry in the valley plus great people what can be said if you want good food  go here"}
{"text":"The food was super good, and the service was great! I had the ribs and they were cooked perfectly. I definitely recommend the baked beans."}
{"text":"We absolutely LOVE West Alley BBQ! They serve excellent food, great drinks, and they have the most friendly and personable staff in town! They have a very dog friendly patio, which of course we love because our black lab comes everywhere with us! They always have great live music too! Overall it is most definitely a favorite of ours due to the great atmosphere, staff, and all of the above!"}
{"text":"This is the best barbecue restaurant in the valley. The service is always fast and the food is amazing. You have to try the catfish. We hosted a party at the restaurant and we received first class service.  Check them out!!"}
{"text":"Friendly waitress, but that's about all... the smoke you smell from the street seems to just draw you in... not an ounce of smoke flavor in the smoked pork... too bad, was hoping this place was going to be good but for the price, we expect better BBQ"}
{"text":"It's taken us a while to try out this place and now we can't wait to return!  The smokehouse fries are awesome.  We tried the chicken, pork and brisket and all were equally good.   Kids might have licked the plates if I had let them.  :-).  Wonderful new addition to downtown Chandler!"}
{"text":"First time visit to WA BBQ.  The food was awesome.  Everyone was so nice. Brittany behind the bar was great.  We met the owner and the kitchen manager.  They too were very friendly.  Took time to stop and talk with us. Can't wait to go back.  Finally some good BBQ in Arizona."}
{"text":"Man oh man!!!! Best brisket ever! I organized an office dinner here for 10 and the staff could not have been more accommodating or kind. Everyone's dinner was a huge hit, and I got kudos for finding the best BBQ In town"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!  Great BBQ sauce and the baked potato was the largest I have ever seen!  The portions were huge and we will return."}
{"text":"Love this little BBQ place in downtown Chandler! They have a great patio and the bar has a garage door so everything feels really open. I got the pulled pork salad and my husband had the brisket sandwich. Everything was amazing! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food,  must try bbq beans,  crinkle cut seasoned fries, coleslaw and potato salad. My only complaint was the ice tea/sweet tea had the hint containers may not be completely cleaned well or not fresh enough.  All in all I am coming back! Great bbq!!!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food, wonderful location, and great music. This is authentic Tennessee barbeque and blues in Chandler! Staff is friendly and attentive. Terrific find. We will be back often!"}
{"text":"Am a huge fan of the cat fish and the vibe of the place. Been going during the week with live music. The food is good. 

Wishing the family owned business well."}
{"text":"We followed our noses to this lovely spot. As if the food isn't enough, they staff this place with great folks. The pit-master, JD, gave us a tour. He's straight outta Tennessee and the real deal. There's some serious love that man is putting into his creations. I strongly recommend you order one of everything a few times over."}
{"text":"This is good barbecue. The whiskey sauce is excellent, the  brisket & pork were both delicious, and we really liked the green beans and mac-n-cheese sides. There is a bar and live music area as well."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Chandler hands down. Got the brisket it was the bomb diggity. I go in twice a week now since I tried it. Amazing service as well!!! Asa Tyler Brittany Alex Shane and Dana are the best bar staff ever"}
{"text":"Tried them on their 3rd day open. A bit pricey, but overall the food was great, and they have their smokers right out back. Pulled pork nachos were great. Pulled pork had a nice smoky flavor, which I enjoyed. The owner was very nice and wanted to ensure everything was great. They were pretty busy with large group after large group. I think this place will do well in this location, and Lord knows we need more really great locally owned bbq places. We will definitely be back! Tip to the owner: add a kids menu which includes a plain baked potato and we would be hooked!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good! Ate the lunch special brisket for $9.99. You get fries & deep fried pickles."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and the service A-1 thanks to Alexander and staff! I was introduced here by coworkers and brought my family. It was a hit! This will be high on the list of our hangout spots."}
{"text":"Low key, great staff, great food, drinks and music. Better then most of the Johnny come lately BBQ places that have seemed to pop up all over the place."}
{"text":"Sadly, was not impressed. 
Sunday brunch, Ribs tasted as if they were left from 1 or 2 days ago. Meat was VERY burnt and DRY. I was really wanting to like this place. Potato salad tasted like store bought, and white beans tasted like out of a can. Hubby said Brisket was enjoyable so 2 stars for that."}
{"text":"New fav restaurant.  The nicest family and fantastic food.  The pit master gave my kids a tour of his pit and showed them how he smokes the meat.   I recommend the ribs and the kids love the pulled pork nachos."}
{"text":"This was our first time eating here yesterday and it was delicious! I called the order in because we wanted to stay in for the day with the kids. Let me tell you.... so good! Definitely going back again! We got the pulled pork nachos, the pulled chicken sandwich, creamy coleslaw and a large baked beans with a side order of fries.... all was outstanding!!! There was not one piece of fat in my meat which was great and the meat was moist and flavorful!! Yes it was a little pricey, but what bbq joint isn't? This is a must try and will be your number one bbq joint here!"}
{"text":"JD ....NEVER GET RID OF HIM!! He pours his heart and soul into this .... thee most delicious bbq EVER!!!!  STAFF (elaina) is  always friendly. JD though, the greatest!! 5/6/18 12pm"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch with friends.  It's a Tennessee Style BBQ joint.  Service was good."}
{"text":"My friends and I visited at about 7pm on a Sunday night recently and had a great experience. Free street parking was easy to find, it was easy to get a table, we placed our order and the food came out withing a couple minutes. Everything was great tasting and generously portioned. I had the BBQ pulled chicken and loved it. My friends had brisket and raved about it. The beans, potato salad and vinegar cole slaw were all perfect sides. The owner came out to check on us, and spent a few minutes talking. This place is a real gem. Make note: it is easily accessible for wheelchairs."}
{"text":"Ate at West Alley for the first time this past week, delish! We love good BBQ and Downtown Chandler so this was a no brainier. The food and service was great, would definitely recommend ! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"We recently moved to Chandler and were checking out our new town.  We had just parked on Boston St. and a lady stopped and asked us what we were looking for.  We told her we've never been there before and wanted to check it out.  She said I work in the area and I recommend the BBQ at the end of the street first, then she mentioned a couple other places.  The owners are from Tennessee and they brought their Pit Master with them to open this new place.  We walked around, saw every restaurant she recommended and went back to West Alley BBQ.  
I am Gluten Free and am usually safe with BBQ Meats.  Aside from a few slip ups on my order, the food was really good.  I ordered Brisket and Pulled Pork.  My husband ordered the half rack of ribs and I couldn't try them because they serve it on Texas Toast bread.  Bones slid out of the ribs, like they never had meat on them.  That's usually my kind of rib too.  The Brisket was melt in your Mouth, and their Hot BBQ Sauce was awesome.  I love vinegar, and it didn't disappoint.  
They might want to brush up on what is Gluten Free and what isn't, but other than that, it was a good experience. (No Wheat, Wheat Flour, Barley or Rye allowed on GF diets). 
Price wise you get a lot of food for the money - I still have a whole other meal in a box left over.  
Overall good experience.  We will be back."}
{"text":"First time here and I've had bbq all over the country. This place is top shelf, good atmosphere, GREAT BBQ, service and bar were fantastic!"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere! Great food! Such an enjoyable evening! Christian, Craig, and the team was amazing!"}
{"text":"The food is good for a suburban bbq place. We liked  that there was live music. Probably a 4 or 4 1/2 star venue for what it is. But the ordering system is just awful. Even the poor staff was confused and frustrated. Please get servers that can just wait on the customers and a micros type system that they take all orders on. Or be a delicatessen style where you order from the front from a big menu above. But at the very least please get rid of the deck of cards, it doesn't fit the theme and it's super confusing for your staff on what they are serving from 2 different areas of the restaurant.  Great concept just poor execution, easy fixes. Good luck!"}
{"text":"Brisket and Ribs were wonderful and staff were overly courteous and friendly. At first glance the meat plates might appear to be little pricey for someone just getting lunch, but the portion size was big and you get 2 sides so it is definitely worth it for such a good meal. They also have cheaper lunch specials so this is definitely going to be a regular stop. 

I'm very happy to finally have a great BBQ restaurant in Chandler and I hope they do well as more and more people discover it."}
{"text":"First, the good. The brisket was smokey and tender. The sauce was flavorful without overwhelming the meat. The service was friendly. And now the challenges: one of the louder restaurants (sadly, not due to music). Room was warm (and it's not yet got here!). Pulled pork was lacking in flavor. Cole slaw (vinegar) had a fishy flavor. The beans were reminiscent of Campbell's (as in canned flavor). Sadly, even the fried pickles were flavorless. Overall, a disappointing experience."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times. Got the lunch special with the brisket and fries. My friend and I think it's the best brisket in the state of Arizona. They do have a lunch special including a drink and 1 side for $9.99. The brisket was a $2 up charge but, soo good.  I'll be back. Can't figure out why they're not lined up out the door."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. Too pricey and food lacked taste and quality! Tried to support new business but won't be back nor recommend to others! 20.08 for four bones, a scoop of baked beans, 4 fried pickles and a coke....not again!"}
{"text":"I work down the street at hop social and went in to this place just walking around downtown chandler. I never had seen it before but when I went in wow. I was greeted right away by the bartender Brody. He was so nice and recommended the brisket, so worth it. Plus he's super cute too. The food is amazing and the service was even better"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch to try our the new BBQ place, and it is an enjoyable experience, but come prepared!

So the place is brand new, and hopefully they will be installing more TVs because there is only one small one near the bar, football was happening so that needs to be stepped up!

Besides that, I went in for the Brisket, I love Brisket but my review is that it was just \"alright\"

The Texas Toast was soft and buttery, the Brisket however was Flavored but Very Dry, that stuff needs to be Juicy guys!!  Regardless, they had all the sauces in stock so I doused it with flavor and it turned out to be alright.

The coleslaw however is delicious, don't change a thing!  

It sucks that the fries are separate, 11 bucks for the sandwich and 2 dollars extra for fries. Just put em together!

Manager was very friendly, personable, and its a Family Owned restaurant which is always nice.  

Good spot, room for improvement, but not a bad meal, I've had worse."}
{"text":"This place is totally legit barbecue! Everything from the brisket to the ribs to the coleslaw and beans were absolutely amazing! And we even got a tour of the smoker. The service was every bit as good as the food, and we are coming back again"}
{"text":"I recently had West Alley barbecue cater in event here in Chandler and not only was the food amazing, but Christian provided top notch customer service. They have the best brisket in the Valley. It was very flavorful and juicy. Their fried catfish is the best I have had anywhere. I highly recommend West Ally barbecue for your next event or stop in for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"The owner came around and introduced himself and wait staff was terrific.  The food arrived at the table quickly.  You order at the counter and the food is brought to you.  I thought that it weird that the beverage station was in the back of the space, not near to the counter or where you come in.  Unfortunately the smoked turkey I ordered was dry but everything else in the salad was fresh.  I ordered ribs to take home, along with the sides that were included.  When we opened the container to eat, we thought the ribs were super charred and smoky - a little too much for our taste  The meat was tender. One last criticism: the sauce is unlike any I've ever had.  The hot is hot enough, though a little vinegary.  I guess I'd give them another visit and try something else"}
{"text":"We loved the food (pulled pork sandwich, brisket sandwich, brisket nachos) - there was so much brisket on my nachos I couldn't believe it.

The owner was out bussing tables and greeting guests...love going to local places like this. Local brews as well. We will be back."}
{"text":"The staff are 5-star! Everyone is very friendly and you just feel like they are truly invested in the success of this place; there is a palpable love that they want you to have, too. And I see why! The food is tasty! The meats are smoky and delicious and the sides hold their own as sides. However, this joint is pricey! $18 for a \"platter\" that included approximately 1/3lb. of meat, two 1/3 cups of sides and a piece of Texas toast?! When you witness it in person you see how absurd the price per ration is.  I love the area and as much as I enjoyed the people I don't know that I'd return because of how expensive it is."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Warm and welcoming staff.  I cannot wait to go back. Had the pork pulled nachos. They were excellent. Looking forward to trying other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Don't send a Texas girl for BBQ anywhere but Texas. First there was no southern hospitality, greeting, wait staff less than hospitable.
Prices are high considering what you don't get. The side servings were small.  Establishment boasts southern, nothing small about southern food. Potato salad was bland, boring and thin. Baked beans vinegary.  Grease was dripping from fried dill pickle slices which was a surprise on the plate. Pickles weren't listed but they were gross. Pulled pork served over Texas toast, was ok, no definite smoked flavor. Hoping for an over the top sauce to really flavor the pork, opted for spicy which wouldn't pour out of plastic bottle, I checked for obstruction, poorly designed dispenser, I'm sure as cost saving measure. The sauce was so vinegary. Very disappointed after spending $20.00 for pulled pork plate and iced tea.  I would opt for Dickeys over this place, better flavor, bigger servings, cost is better buy for value AND greeting is awesome!"}
{"text":"My husband and I moved to Arizona from Tennessee four years ago, and the one food we felt like we haven't been able to find in the East Valley was good BBQ...until now! We randomly happened into West Alley BBQ this evening after walking by and smelling the smoker out back. We knew we had to try it, and I'm so glad we did! We didn't realize the owners were also from Tennessee, but once we tried the food, it was so clear. The brisket was AMAZING -- so tender. And I loved the loaded pork baked potato too. (It's huge, and is enough for two meals!) We had a blast chatting with the bartender, owner Christian and the man smoking the pork out back. So glad to have this little slice of Tennessee in Arizona! Not only is the food great, the team is so friendly and welcoming, and the live entertainment was great too. We will 100% be back with friends from Arizona and family from Tennessee next time they come to visit :) PS: Don't miss the Tennessee Whisky sauce!"}
{"text":"My nose wouldn't let me leave the downtown area without giving this place a try. It definitely didn't let me down one bit. The ribs were literally fall off the bone. The pulled pork nachos were amazing. Hard to top the food but that wasn't even the best part of the visit. I felt the southern Tennessee hospitality from the owner and the pit master! Live music was also a very cool surprise. Great food, great atmosphere, even better people!"}
{"text":"We've eaten there three times so far. After the last experience, we may not be back. The first two times, the food was excellent! Prices a bit high for lunch, but good quality and quantity. The third time was a completely different experience. The ribs were dry, chewy, and not very tasty. They were the end of the rack, but still, it was bad. The brisket was also the end and the quantity and quality were lacking. Tennessee style BBQ is very different from Texas style, so if you're looking for something new, this might be a good choice. I just hope you don't get stuck with the dregs like we did."}
{"text":"Fantastic... only way I can describe West Alley BBQ (WAB)!  This casual, comfy and homey place does it for you hands down.  If you're a Tennessee-style BBQ lover (or not), if you love music (or not), if you enjoy courteous and attentive staff, servers, cooks, management and pit master, you gotta go here!  Starting with a House Chardonnay and a Kiltlifter, we thoroughly enjoyed their fixin's of delicious Tennessee-style Ribs, and the tender and mouth-watering Brisket was to die for - with a helping of their beans, Cole slaw and fries are great!  That's not all... their menu offerings are enough to make you think twice of what you'd like to get - extensive. Don't forget the sauces: Tennessee Whiskey; Mild; Medium; and Hot - marvelous (I just drenched my Brisket)!  This venture, fresh out of Tennessee (they're first Valley location), bring not only great food to the table, great caring service, daily variety in music, but you feel at home inside or out!  Thanx to Bardo (owner) and son Christian Brantley the incredible and endearing Pit Meister Jim Dandy (a true artist of pit) you can't go wrong!  Meeting them and enjoying their gracious and open hospitality made for a greater evening beyond the food, the music and the ambience... my wife and I so elated as we left, even danced a little at the front entrance!  Now that's a place to keep coming to... keep it up guys!  Bon appétit, musiques and l'amitié at the WAB from Gástro Ecléctico!"}
{"text":"Let me tell you...the brisket here is freaking insane. Their BBQ master is amazing..I don't think I have ever tasted better brisket. I hesitate every time I reach for BBQ sauce because the brisket alone is so flavorful...this is an art. BUT...BUT..BUT...Until you have had a MOSCOW MULE made by Alexander, you truly have not experienced mixology at its finest. This is a fine group of folks running this establishment - and what can I say, I'm a quasi-vegetarian...yet here I am."}
{"text":"Cool little BBQ place that fits DT Chandler pretty well. Very generous with their meat portions at a decent price. Meat quality is solid. I went a little later in the day so my brisket was a little on the dryer side. I wouldn't put it past them though. I went on a random Tuesday, and wouldn't mind going back. Personally, I'd give them a soft 4"}
{"text":"Went to West Alley today for lunch with my mom. When we walked in, we were greeted by the waitress, Amber. My mom ordered the pulled pork & I ordered the pulled chicken lunches. The sandwiches were piled with meat. The fries were ordinary frozen crinkle fries. The cole slaw was bland & the sauces were terrible. The taste of the sauces was good, but the consistency was water-like. The iced tea was brewed fresh & refreshing. There was a man passed out on the bench seat & he slept there the entire time we were there. Overall, the best thing going there was Amber. There's better bbq & a more pleasant environment elsewhere in the valley."}
{"text":"Great food and great service!!!!! Staff was amazing! Wings and pulled pork were amazing. I will definitely be back again and again. Oh, and the prices are good too."}
{"text":"So I came to this place because I went to go see my sister n law Lynn Jackson and of course she was phenomenal from R&B to good ole rock n roll! I thought I would order something because you know that's what you do when you support someone ! I was ordering just something small cause I had eaten! Ordered 1/2 order of wings and lo and behold they were amazing ! So tender and delicious! I end up regretting I didn't order the full order! Today I had to go back because this place is phenomenal! All the servers ready to help you , I ordered the wings again and my husband the fish fry!!! So so good! Thanks to Crispy and the manager Christian was so awesome and really sets the way for giving us an amazing experience ! Thanks to Lynn for telling me about this awesome place with live entertainment but amazing food and amazing staff!! You guys just gained a whole new slew of customers as I will be bringing all my friends !!!"}
{"text":"Tennessee style BBQ in Chandler! I'm an equal opportunity BBQ enthusiast so I was excited to see that West Alley BBQ had opened up recently in the downtown area. We knew we were in the right spot when we walked in and smelled wood smoke permeating throughout the restaurant. The restaurant is owned by the Brantley family with son Christian running the Chandler location while father Bardo is the owner of the first restaurant in Jackson, TN.

Your BBQ options are pork, brisket, chicken and turkey as a sandwich, as a platter, on a salad, or topped over fries, nachos, or baked potato. They also offer chicken wings and fried fish. All the selections sounded so delicious it was hard to pick just one item but I ultimately went for the brisket sandwich. I had originally ordered just the sandwich but didn't realize I had been rung up for the lunch special until we had already paid. It wasn't a big deal though since it was just a dollar more for the special which included a drink and side. 

Our meals came out in just a few minutes and looked spectacular. The brisket had plenty of chopped meat and had a nice smoke ring on it. It was served with creamy coleslaw, and had buttered Texas toast as the bread. I had the green beans as a side and they were well seasoned, slow cooked and had a great balance of flavors. The sandwich was good, although I did get quite a lot of fatty blobs in it. The texture and flavor was decent but I'll admit my favorite brisket is still from Little Miss BBQ. Tennessee BBQ is more well known for pork so I'll have to try the pulled pork next time. They offer a hot and mild vinegar based BBQ sauce. I preferred the flavor of the hot over the mild.

Service was friendly and the restaurant itself has a warm and inviting feel, with a patio both in the front and back which I thought was a unique feature. 

Thanks for bringing TN-style BBQ to downtown Chandler! I'll be back for some more slow cooked meats!"}
{"text":"There are some really great things about this place. It's spacious and comfortable. It's open seating (or at least it was when we went) so you can choose where you'd like to dine. It's clean and the people working here are really friendly, accommodating, and personable. We had mixed reviews on the food though. The brisket and pulled pork were FABULOUS! The ribs, however, had zero flavor. It's like they weren't seasoned at all. The fries were great! Maybe they could use some of the seasoning used on the fries and apply it to the ribs.  I would probably give them four stars if it weren't for the price. Based on the pricing one expects consistent fabulousness and that just not what we got unfortunately."}
{"text":"Was excited to try a new bbq place. Was very disappointed. I lived in Texas and know dang good bbq. This was a 2 or 3 star place. We ordered our food and another waitress brought someone else's food to our table. We ordered the pork salad, turkey sandwich and brisket plate. The salad was the best thing here and it's a bbq place.... the turkey sandwich had seasoning salt on it and was very dry. The brisket was the biggest disappointment. It was cooked too long. It had no pink around the perimeter. If you want mediocre bbq then go here. Another dislike was a jazz band was playing and it was so loud you couldn't talk to someone a foot away from you. I would overall suggest other bbq places. Save your time and money. Try another place."}
{"text":"Great BBQ. To start, Dana, who took our order, took a lot of time to make sure it was right for us. My wife is allergic to black pepper, so she held the salt and pepper and the rub. Still great with intense smoke flavor. Ribs moist and tender. So is the brisket which was very lean. They clearly pay a lot of attention to this. BBQ beans great. Nice people here, good service."}
{"text":"We have eaten at West Alley BBQ several times.  Everything is always excellent!  The chicken, turkey, beef and pork all always tender and not dried out.  The salads always have fresh lettuce (mixed greens).  Now to the BBQ Sauces - they are always very good.  My favorite is the Tennessee! 
The staff is great!  They are very helpful to first timers and they take real pride in the food they serve.  As a customer the staff never rushes you.  Drinks are brought out right away after sitting down.  They give plenty of time to look at the menu and after the food is brought to the table they check back often to ask if you need anything else.  There is never a problem with splitting the checks.  I recommend West Alley BBQ for anyone looking for really great BBQ."}
{"text":"Best BBQ I've had in Phoenix. The portions were huge and the service/staff were so friendly. They kept checking on us throughout our meal to make sure our food was good and to make sure we had everything we needed. Will definitely be back and will recommend to everyone I know!!"}
{"text":"After being in the Downtown area long enough you will surely smell the BBQ from West Alley BBQ. Let me tell you, it's just as delicious as it smells. 

I really liked the location here. It is set back a bit from the regular Downtown Chandler area but still right there so you can easily get around. Above it is Puro Cigar Bar (which I haven't been to yet) and next door is Ice Cream Sammies! 

Once inside, the location is long and narrow with two outdoor patios. I'd say head straight to the patio off the back of the restaurant as that is where the indoor/outdoor bar is at :D 

I got the brisket platter and it is several slices of brisket served up on a giant piece of Texas toast. I say hold off on the sauce as you are able to add a dowsing amount of it on your own and give the different flavors a try. I really enjoyed the Tennessee whiskey and the regular sweet BBQ was good too; they were both more runny than thick. I also got a side of the beans and coleslaw - each delicious. I was pleasantly full with it all but wished there were more of the sides. 

Overall, this place was worth the trip. The restaurant itself is plenty big with lots of seating, a large indoor/outdoor bar, and they even have a stage for live bands. The brisket is delicious and you can take a walk out back and see where they BBQ it all. Its well worth the trip at least once."}
{"text":"I had the brisket platter. The brisket was delicious, but the BBQ sauce was runnier than usual, and tasted ok... not very special though. The atmosphere is casual and nice. The patio in that back was nice for a winter day lunch

*Update: Thanks Christian for your reply. Appreciate your advice, but unfortunately I won't be able to try the other sauce cause I don't drink alcohol, so the BBQ sauce is my only option :)"}
{"text":"Went for carry out on a Wednesday. It was pretty early (5 pm) and there were 4 patrons dining. 

We ordered the pulled pork platter with 2 sides (creamy cole slaw and french fries). We requested both mild and hot bbq sauce on the side so we could taste the pork without sauce. Both sauces were delicious and typically thin of Tennessee bbq. The hot sauce was not very hot (by AZ standards) and when we mixed them together, they were perfect. 

The portion sizes were fair for the price. The pork was tasty, though a bit dry (adding bbq sauce helped). There were a few fried pickles included, but they were much too salty to eat. Fries were okay, nothing special. We don't know about the creamy cole slaw as it was forgotten. Tennessee barbecue and cole slaw are a match made in heaven, so we were very disappointed that the slaw was missing.

Overall, a fair experience. Because the sauces were so good, we'll give them another try."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite before having a cigar upstairs.  We ordered a burger, pulled pork sandwich, and fries.  Food didn't have much flavor and the fries were the best part of the meal.  Service was nothing special.  Lots of better spots to eat in my opinion considering the price.  Likely won't be back."}
{"text":"Solid Q addition to DC, nice laid back vibe, good Southern BBQ, the meat falls right off their rib bones slow roasted on wood fired smoker grill, nice to have 2 kinds of slaw, love their big crinkle cut fries. Good patio and very friendly food service at the back bar.  Really enjoyed our visit!"}
{"text":"The best BBQ I have had in a long time!  Since living in the South!!!!  They know how to serve great bbq and a southern bonus...vinegar slaw on the sand which, superb!  

Glad you are in Chandler!"}
{"text":"I'm from Texas and I know good BBQ. This is the BEST brisket I've EVER tasted! The owner & pitboss are from Tennessee -- this is the REAL DEAL! I'll be a regular for sure"}
{"text":"Guys I won't say their food is bad, but for the prices I would have expected much more.  The people are friendly but taste is lacking.  Sorry but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Their bbq is fantastic. Had a bite to eat while sitting at the cigar bar upstairs. The food is great and the staff is awesome. Matthew the bartender was super friendly and is very knowledgeable with spirits and their grass roots style of bbq. Thumbs up."}
{"text":"Thanks to Miss Linda who recommended this BBQ restaurant . Service was great, food was delicious, and the live entertainment was fun. Christian, the owner visited our table. He was very friendly and thanked us for visiting his new restaurant. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Excellent bbq.  Great band the night we were there!  Nice touch having music.  They have patio seating as well."}
{"text":"This place is Amazing! Wait staff is Awesome! Music, drinks and food are outstanding! The patio is the best around, with fire pits and great views! Live Music is very GOOD! If you want to smoke a cigar upstairs at Puro, they send BBQ up there also!  The smell of wood smoking is insane!"}
{"text":"I so much wanted to like this place.
My wife brought our family and my brother's family from out of town here for a special BBQ dinner.  The kids and wife ordered pulled pork, I ordered the full rack and my brother ordered the Brisket with a couple other meats. The problem started when the brisket came, it was a nice sized chunk of meat but it was very fatty and stringy, not like a brisket should be at all. We brought it to our waitress attention and she tried to explain it away as it just wasn't sliced properly, after some more discussion about it she said she would take care of it. She brought back a much smaller portion of brisket, I think it was 3 slices at a little over 4\" but it was a good piece of brisket. 

Next thing was the rack of ribs.
As my brother was getting his brisket taken care of I was deboning my ribs because I like to eat them with a fork, not off the bone like most. I couldn't believe how much cartilage and fat was on this rack of ribs. Before I was done I had a small pile of cartilage on my plate, several pieces where over 2\" long. The rib meat was so fatty and infused with cartilage I decided not to eat it. So I brought it to our waitress attention and she told us that my plate did have a lot of cartilage on it and something about a new meat supplier that they were trying out, then she politely turned and walked away before I could respond.    

A few minutes later I grabbed our waitress attention and handed her my plate with everything on it but a the fried pickles and a little over half of a fork full of the rib meat. I told her the problem with it again,  I wasn't going to eat it and I don't want to pay for it, she said that she would take care of it. 
 
When the bill came the full rack of ribs was on the bill but she did discount the brisket by a few dollars. I questioned her about the bill and she said she would see what she can do. When she came back with the bill this time she still charged me for a half rack and I was still hungry.

I felt as if I was treated as I was complaining just to complain, there is nothing further from the truth. I knew my wife would take any kind of criticism of her restaurant pick personal.   

My wife felt so bad for bringing us here that the next night she brought home the same meals for all 7 of us from Joe's BBQ in Gilbert which is much farther away, everything was spot on.  True story,, LOVE UP.

{"text":"First timer at west alley over the weekend, to say the least WOW!! Awesome environment, amazing brisket sandwich! And our server Brody was the most handsome boy in the place he made our experience worth every penny!!"}
{"text":"This place is perfect especially if you're upstairs having a smoke and drink at Puro.  They will deliver up to you which is very convenient.  
Was here for new years and have been back multiple times and for a reason. 

The food is very well flavored and the meat especially the Pork is so well cooked that it makes the dish you add it to or amazing all by it self.  The lemon flavored chicken tenders are our favorite but at times can be a little to salty but its ok.

Highly recommend this spot you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"What can I say. The food was off the charts goods and service was second to none. We sat at the beautiful outside bar and stayed hours longer ham we intended. Get the brisket before it runs out!"}
{"text":"I had a really great time trying out west alley for the first time. Brody was my server and he did an amazing job. Will definitely be a frequent flyer from now on. Amazing service, Amazing food! Thanks again service !"}
{"text":"Best brisket I have had in a long time. Cool atmosphere and great music definitely a place to check out if you are into barbecue. My server Brody was so nice and was very attentive and seemed to genuinely enjoy his job which is so refreshing in the restaurant industry! Definitely will be coming back here again!!"}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time and it was Awesome!! I had the catfish and it was very good my daughter had the brisket and you could cut it with a fork these people know how to smoke some meat! Good margarita and a melon flavored mule that I would order a pitcher of!"}
{"text":"Very Disappointed!  Ribs tasted old & skanky.  Though there were only a few patrons, customer service was inattentive.

Not worth the $$.  Will not return."}
{"text":"Second visit to this business in two weeks.  First trip the beef brisket was ordered.  It was wonderful, moist, tender, and full of flavor.  I had it over a baked potato.  When trying a new BBQ restaurant I always go for the brisket unsauced because pulled pork is everywhere.  I certainly was not disappointed.  At this visit we were notified of an all-you-can-eat catfish dinner on Fridays.  So, this past Friday four of us visited and all I can say is HOLY COW!

I've spent my 55+ years before relocation in rural southern Illinois very near the Mississippi River, catfish farms, NW Tennessee, W Kentucky and southeast Missouri.  Friends and neighbors in this four state area know both their BBQ and their fried catfish.  My review is based upon this experience.

The catfish comes with one side for $9.95.  The first order proved what a good deal this was.  Three large filets appeared, fried perfectly in an all corn meal batter.  The fish was hot with no sign of excess moisture.  The meat was snow white and firm.  The second and third subsequent orders were the same, just as hot, and firm.  If my Dad was still alive and was frying himself he couldn't have done a better job.  The coating, temperature, and frying time all made for perfect fried catfish.  

My hat is off to this new business and its employees.  They are trying very hard to keep up with the necessary bar amenities like TVs, etc but look beyond that and focus on the food.  People, the owners are from Jackson, Tennessee and know what they're doing.

Hands down, the best fried catfish I've had, ever here in the Valley.  The BBQ ranks in the top three on my list depending on my mood.

Go and get to know the owners, the pit master, and the employees.  I promise they will take very good care of you and give you some of the best BBQ and fried catfish you can find.

I have a feeling where I may be spending some of my upcoming Friday's now."}
{"text":"Went with a huge group. Majority ordered the pulled pork, it's your typical pulled pork. Hardly any sauce, not very flavorful. The loaded potatoes were good, can't go wrong with a baked potato. You order right when you walk in. The tea station is behind the cashier but the sodas were off in the back. Weird set up. 3 stars mainly because it's new, clean and the staff were all friendly. The food is mediocre at best. Needs more flavor and sauce on the sandwiches."}
{"text":"This is a great place! Great food, nice atmosphere, friendly people, nice outdoor area in back and on weekends they have great live music. Highly recommend it"}
{"text":"I would not have noticed this restaurant until I ran into one of the co-owners at Winco's supermarket last weekend. As I was lining up to pay for my groceries, I saw this young man purchasing 20 to 30 lbs of ribs. I thought he was going to throw a BBQ party for the town lol. Since I was curious, I asked him what he was going to do with all those ribs (perhaps he could share some of his good recipe?). That was when I found out about this restaurant. Finally, I've decided to try it out on memorial Day weekend.

We parked in the dirt lot behind the building upon arrival. As we were getting ready to walk around to the front door, a very kind old chef told us to simply walked in through the small icon gate. Already loving the hospitality, we were so excited to try out their BBQ ribs and briskets. Let me tell you....the meat falls off the bones EFFORTINESS! Seriously, it was so tender you could pull it right off with the fork. The meat is juicy. Shortly after our arrival, we ran into the owner we saw at Winco's supermarket and chatted for a bit. We had so much food that we ended up taking some back home for dinner. 

Finally, a delicious BBQ restaurant is opening up in Chandler. I've tried the rest in the valley and am honestly not impressed. I will most definitely come back here again. For those of you who like live bands, they do have music playing at night time (schedules are available on the dining table or possibly websites)."}
