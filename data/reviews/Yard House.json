{"text":"Besides Blue Martini - Yard House is a new hang-out for cocktails spot in Las Vegas.  They have a vast selection of food and libacious drinks.  Music is always blaring so the patio is a good spot if one wants to have a conversation or to people watch."}
{"text":"Not a quiet atmosphere but a good one none the less.  Highly recommend the Mac and Cheese and Jumbalaya."}
{"text":"Pretty good place, a classier alternative to an applebees or chilis. Quite a diverse menu, surprisingly the more elaborate entrees they offer are actually quite good, and priced well for the portions you get. I'm pretty sure they have 900,000 beers on tap. Pretty loud but if you are in the mood it can be a good time."}
{"text":"Normally a good place with a variety of food and fun atmosphere but on 4/25/17 when six of us went in for lunch at 1:30 everything went wrong.  With almost nobody there service was slow, took 15 minutes to get drinks, food a half an hour and then two orders were over cooked and three were wrong.  They did comp us one meal that was inedible and gave us two desserts then we had to wait for spoons.  Pretty much as bad as it could get."}
{"text":"Awesome beer selection ultra fast service service for a busy friday night.  Had two beers at the bar it was sin city ale?  I think .  Anyway great beer."}
{"text":"Birthday Dinner for my good friend Melissa Chupa...Happy Birthday!!!"}
{"text":"I come in here quiet often and it's amazing! The first time I came in here Daniel M was our server and he has been ever since. We make sure to ask for him each time we come here. He's absolutely amazing. However, tonight when we came in, and we asked to be seated in his section and the host replied \"sorry, he has no open tables in his section.\" So we're like like okay, we'll just wait until something comes available. And she looks at us and says \"okay, goodbye. Have a good night.\" With a snooty attitude. She didn't want to take our name down and let us wait, she just turned us away. And what's worse was there was a MANAGER standing next to her and he doesn't say anything. This place is very poorly staffed (hosts) and poorly managed. Every experience I've had with a manager here isn't very good."}
{"text":"Great place, good location, food was top notch, our server Deona was super sweet, amazing service, definitely will be back."}
{"text":"An above average beer selection.  But food could have been better. We ate here on St Paddy's Day.  Corned beef brisket with cabbage and potatoes.  Not good.  Cabbage was tougher than my beef, which was tougher than shoe leather.  Even the potatoes were hard.  Okay, maybe not their specialty... Better luck next time, huh?"}
{"text":"Had the seared Mahi sandwich and it was amazing. Great beers and ambiance. Had to come back two days in a row."}
{"text":"The Yard House is our old standby. Consistently good food, many beers to choose from. Great service and the nachos are to die for. Cheers!"}
{"text":"My FAVE place for happy hour. Especially great during football season. They have happy hour for Monday Night Football from 'kick off' to the final play. I usually order their fried calamari and a glass of white wine. Hubby and I consider ourselves \"regulars\". We've been to both Yard Houses in Vegas. Looking forward to the Yard House that will be opening in San Jose Santana Row in February 2011."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!  
I give a full 5 stars to the staff, management, and chefs. Great environment placed at the center of Old Town Scottsdale. If you haven't been here before. I'd say it's a perfect mix of upper class light sports bar and stylish sit down restaurant. Well put together dishes by the chefs. I'd recommend my favorites of the onion ring tower and the BBQ bacon burger or one of their various street tacos. I'm not a drinker past some Ice T but if you have a favorite beer. I'd challenge you to try out the Yard House and see if yours is one of the \"125\" beers on tap!"}
{"text":"Doesn't everyone love yardhouse? Their happy hour is awesome.

We gave them 4 stars, because overall they are wonderful. However, beware because they do have their bad nights. 

Tonight, we both ordered cups of clam chowder and one came out filled to the top and the other was way below the rim.

Then our chicken sandwich came out uncooked!!! We sent it back and the manager was nice enough to come out and offer us more food & dessert on him.

I have had the tomato bisque before and it was really good. Tonight, it wasn't good. I was very disappointed, because I LOVE tomato/tomato bisque soup.

We definitely wanted to note that they have very good service. When you ask for a box, they do it for you instead of giving you a box to do it yourself. They even write the date and what food is inside of the box in the corner! Little things like that really do make a difference."}
{"text":"Best Cuban sandwich I have ever tasted. Draft beer selection is second to none. Great staff and atmosphere. We ate at the bar and our interaction with the bartenders made the night."}
{"text":"The food at Yardhouse is always good. Today I had the Pastrami Burger. Everything about it was perfect with the fried egg on top. Can't give more than 3 stars because the service here is always below average."}
{"text":"Best place for BBQ in Las Vegas! Close to the strip with food that is literally to die for!"}
{"text":"Been going to Yard House for over 5 years, always for Happy Hour.  They have great deals on the appetizer's, we usually order 6-8 items and share family style.  My wife and kid both enjoy the food as well.  Atmosphere is relaxing, large booths are great,  prices are fair & food is good."}
{"text":"Love Yard House for happy hour! Great deals on appetizers and drinks.It can get realky crowded and sometimes have long waits."}
{"text":"This place has every beer you can think of along with a great selection of wine and liquor. It actually can be a little over whelming since it seems over half their menu is alcohol related. Their food is average but if you want a beer while the family is shopping, go here."}
{"text":"I always have great food as well as great service here! Practically everything on the menu is delicious. I love the orange peel chicken,  lobster garlic noodles, creme Brule, mojitos, and so much more."}
{"text":"This was my first yard house experience, and it was terrible! My family was visting Vegas. So we all decided to try something new. The experience was horrendous! Costumer service was horrible. The waiters were disappointing, they were disrespectful and awful. Even the food quality wasn't as imagined. Instead of juicy and steamy. It was cold and left out, it seemed as if the food had been left out and served to us. Maybe, it will be better in the next visit."}
{"text":"Yard house is my go to. Come during happy hour! We had a HUGE plate of delicious chicken nachos, onion ring tower, and a pizza all for $6 or $7. It was just two of us and we were STUFFED. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Spicy tuna roll is outstanding!  We come all the way from Show Low to enjoy it  service is great, people are all so friendly"}
{"text":"I wish I could give it 0 stars instead!

This is directly going towards the Bartender Sean. What else can I say? WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! I seriously don't know how management would hire douchebags like this for their company. This is coming from a person who works in the industry as well!

Went in to have a few drinks and some dessert at the bar with a couple of my friends last Thursday before a movie. Sat at the bar and waited for literally 2 mins before someone actually gave us menus after looking at us for a bit. So this guy Sean comes and drops off the menus, no greeting whatsoever, no offering of water whatsoever. He left and went to chit chat with one of his buddies behind the bar. My girlfriend had to get his attention for him to bring us waters.

Waters come in, asks \"You guys know what you want?\" One of my friends tells em not yet and he just gave this look on his face like \"WTF, hurry up\" so he leaves like hes in distress and does not come back for about 5 minutes after we were trying to indicate him that we were ready to order!

SERIOUSLY?!

This is what pissed us off the most. We were halfway through our food and my friend got his attention because she thought I needed something, so this douchebag Sean comes up to us and asks \"What, you needed something?\" with his hands up in the air, like we wasted his time from leaving him his conversation with his buddies to actually work and helping us out, like come on F*cking SERIOUSLY?!?!

I am very dissapointed with this Yardhouse location as I am a regular customer at the Town Square location. I will not be returning to this location as well as not referring anyone to this place for as long as Sean is there. Seriously you get better customer service in night clubs then at this place. I hope management stumbles upon this review and take action because I am still pissed at how this d*ck treated me and my friends. 

Don't come here if you want to be treated like shit basically. Upper Management please do something about this immediately."}
{"text":"Amazing food, service and drinks!!! Seating was fast ..food came out quick and was so incredibly fresh 
!! Fish and chips was amazing and so was the spinach artichoke dip..both are must tries."}
{"text":"Love love LOVE Yardhouse! I've been to many different YH locations and they've all been great. Very consistent. Delicious food options and they out hot. Pretty decent cocktails and great beer choices. Would certainly recommend for any time of chill gathering."}
{"text":"Love the food and drinks at this location. Been here multiple times and always had excellent service. The chicken tortilla soup is fantastic and so is the mac n cheese. The happy hour prices are great. I also appreciate that they do separate checks, even for large parties."}
{"text":"Let me first say that I LOVE Yardhouse. I have been to one in Las Vegas & Scottsdale & both locations were PHENOMENAL. I went to the Westgate Yardhouse this past Friday evening for my birthday dinner. It was slammed at 9pm but I didn't mind the wait for my favorite restaurant. We got a table 30 minutes later & our server was pretty quick to get us going with drinks and an appetizer. I ordered the Coconut Shrimp, my favorite app, & was definitely disappointed. The presentation was lacking, the shrimp were overcooked and lacking flavor, & the green papaya salad wasn't dressed. Every other time I have ordered this app the presentation, flavor, & salad were better. I figured since they were busy it wasn't too big of a deal. Then I got my entree, the ahi tuna salad. The tuna was delicious & I picked it out of the salad. The salad however was terrible. The flavor was extremely salty and flat. I was honest with the waiter about it and he told the manager who spoke to me and generously removed the salad from our bill. I really appreciated it since it was so inedible for me. I was excited for my lemon soufflé dessert at first, but it took so long to come out I honestly wanted to leave before we even got it. Finally when it hit the table, it wasn't even hot. After waiting ALL that time for it I expected it to be burning hot. I was so disappointed with the entire meal but after complaining about my entree I didn't want to bother the manager again. Overall opinion: SKIP GLENDALE & GO TO SCOTTSDALE LOCATION"}
{"text":"The people on the carry out phone are really rude and can't seem to follow
along. 

I know they are just disinterested high school girls who couldn't care less, but every time I call I end up annoyed. 

Whatever"}
{"text":"My wife and I have spent many a night at the Yard House in Glendale. Until our last 3 trips there we had nothing but great things to say about the place. Now I'm having to give it 2 stars. Our last 3 trips to this location have just been awful. The first of our awful trips we both got the Surf and Turf burger. I ordered mine medium and she ordered hers medium rare. Both came crispy and far from pink. Needless to say we sent them back. I got mine first somehow and waited for hers to come thinking it would be any second. It wasn't...by the time she got hers mine was cold! Making a long story short I complained to head quarters and we received a gift card to go back and try it again. We did and unfortunately it was the same experience with different food. We went through the whole process yet again and gave it one last try...I'm sorry to say other than going for the beer selection I won't be eating at that location any longer. Something happened there and the food has just gotten terrible. I really hope they fix this because it really was one of our favorite places to go and it is close to home."}
{"text":"I've been to this Yardhouse location a few of times on dates and it is without a doubt my favorite. They have the best selection of beers, which flow through all the pipes you see on the ceiling.The Belgian sampler in particular was fun to try and share with each other as we compared which flavors we liked best (my favorite was Blanche de Bruxelles!). The rib eye with string beans and mashed potatoes was perfect & satisfying. We had Ben as out waiter and he was really attentive and nice. Keep in mind that the place does get busy, and there's typically a wait time, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place for the first time while on vacation.   We are now a FAN!   Be sure not to miss the \"smore's brownie\"  they tell you it will be a 15 min wait since they freshly roast the marshmallows on top!  OMG it was so worth it , one of the best desserts we have ever had!!!"}
{"text":"It was my first time to have dinner at the Yard House. After shopping at the Town Square, my friend and I got hungry, so we randomly picked a restaurant. When we get to the entrance of the Yard House, we saw people walk in and out, and some of people were just gathering in front of the entrance. This restaurant was very busy that it took us about half an hour to get a seat. We sat in the restaurant booth, which is about 8ft from the bar. The design of the dinning room is pretty. The room is dark, but very comfortable. I ordered the small size Penne with Chicken, which is in the House Favorite category. My friend ordered the small size BBQ Chicken Salad. Even though the restaurant was very busy, the service was very fast. It took only about 10 minutes for the dishes to be served. In the Penne with Chicken, the penne was nicely mixed with the asparagus, mushrooms, tomato, and cheese, and it also looked glossy. The size of the dish was about 12 to 16oz. The smell of the dishes is very good that it is not too strong but mild. The penne was smooth and a little bit creamy; it was slippery in the mouth. The chicken was tender, and its flavor was salty, a little acid, and creamy. The acid flavor of the tomato was balanced with the marsala cream sauce. The BBQ Chicken salad had a very fresh smell and bright colors. The fried onion had a weaker smell than the no fried one, and it was well mixed with other greens. The texture of the salad was crispy and moist. Because avocado, tomato, beans, corn, cilantro, and pasilla were included in this dish, it had flavor of salty, sweet, acid, and spicy. The chicken of the salad had a little burnt taste. The size of the salad is big that we did not finish it even though the one we order was a small size. Due to the good first impression, my friend and I would like plan for a return."}
{"text":"Janet M. was our server and she was awesome! She was on top of keeping drinks filled, food came out timely and she was just really nice. I'd come back just so we can dine with her again, definitely made the experience better :-)"}
{"text":"We were in town on vacation and found this restaurant when out shopping. We loved the coconut shrimp and burgers. Relaxing atmosphere, family friendly and great service. Ask for Hanh, she waited on us both times and provided excellent service and a lovely smile!"}
{"text":"Being a Las Vegas local, we have been to Yard House several times.  We usually go to the location on Las Vegas Blvd, but we had some family in town so we thought we would try the Red Rock location.  Needless to say the service was sooo horrible last night, my family and I will never be back to Yard House in the future.  Which is disappointing since we really enjoy the food & the atmosphere is nice.  Las Vegas is a service industry town, so you expect to get at least decent service... especially with soo many restaurant options.

I would not recommend anyone go to the Red Rock location.  We had a party of 8 so I understand sometimes there are challenges with larger parties but waiting an hour & a half just to get our food is a bit ridiculous.  Our beverages were empty most of the night, our server never checked on us and not once acknowledged the fact that we had waited sooo long to get our food.  We would try to get her attention and she would walk past us.  When our food finally did arrive, we had asked for a few items such as refills on beers & drinks as well as something simple like tarter sauce for the fish & chips... which our server never brought us.  At the end of the night we mentioned how unpleasant the service was to the manager and he didn't seem to care.  I guess they are not too concerned with making their customers happy.  This was by far the worst service I have EVER had.  Very unacceptable."}
{"text":"I stopped here for a quick lunch today and left disappointed. They have a great draft list, but that's about it. 

I ended up getting the carne asada with shrimp enchilada stack. According to the menu, it was a \"house specialty\" so I thought I was making a safe decision. What I ended up getting was very disappointing. The steak was small and very thin. The shrimp stack was also small and looked like a pile of mush. All of the tastes ran together into one very bland flavor. But what really made me upset was the temperature of the food. It came to me barely warm, like it had been sitting for a long time. 

I posted a picture of my entree here so everyone can judge for themselves, whether or not it looks like a $24 dish. Also 2 beers cost me $16. So a bland lunch with 2 beers was $50 (including tip). Really!"}
{"text":"The food & beers are great! :-) Great happy hour as well! Awesome place to hangout with friends or habe a romantic dinner."}
{"text":"Magnificent seafood pasta. Even my 10 month old liked it. Very tasty, quick service, nice scenery. The bathrooms were pretty clean and the staff was very upbeat."}
{"text":"The first stop my boyfriend and I made on our last trip to Vegas was Yard House at the Linq as we wanted to try something new.  It was a beautiful day and we were seated on their amazing rooftop patio.  We ordered some ciders (PINEAPPLE cider!), and a few appetizers to share.  We got the Moo Shu Egg Rolls, Hawaiian Poke Stack and Coconut Shrimp.  Everything was super fresh and tasty.  We had never been to a Yard House before and this is definitely not our last time.  We were actually wishing we had just a little more time in Vegas so we could go back for one more meal.  There were so many tasty sounding things on the menu, it was hard to decide."}
{"text":"A lot has changed since my last visit.... and not for the good.  The street fish tacos were less than stellar (by far).  Dry and lackluster fish with not much thought put in the beans and rice.  Purple haze beer must have been tapped a few months ago. The chicken torta would have caused a rematch at the Alamo... However, the pastrami Benedict was top notch.  Overall, the $120 spent on a Friday night for a family of four was about as satisfying as a kick in the sack.  Bummer"}
{"text":"This is the only place I can get my favorite beer on tap, Tripel Karmeliet from Belgium.  They also have a good selection of local beers and just a good variety on tap overall.  The food is very good for bar food and I can easily overeat my way through their menu, especially during happy hour.

They have a separate gluten free menu.  I do not eat diary and they are very accommodating to leaving off any items on request."}
{"text":"I just love this place, especially the happy hour menu. You can get dishes starting at $5 per plate and up to $10 but everything taste delicious.  I took off one star because I've been here 3 times in the last 3 weeks and had the chicken noodles which taste different every time. One time I had it seasoned perfectly and twice was just bland. I wish they could be more consistent so I could  enjoy this place more."}
{"text":"Have been here 5 times now and each time it has been underwhelming.  Food is either wrong or cold.  The managers do a good job of making up for issues but the kitchen is bad.  Beer selection is good but prices are high.  Overall I would expect more consistent food for the price.  They do have an interesting menu but the dishes appear too complex for the kitchen to deliver on.  We have visited other yard house locations and have not had an issue."}
{"text":"I love the happy hour specials. It has pizza, wings, garlic noodles, sliders, etc... What more do you need to go with a couple beers? I usually come here specifically for the happy hour specials but a few times I've dined here with some friends. The jambalaya is my favorite off their menu. Really good.Gets really busy on the weekends."}
{"text":"We stopped by here on our last trip. My brother had never been. We ordered the calamari and onion ring tower. Both were yummy. Our drinks came pretty fast. I was little disappointed that my Gin and Ginger didn't have a garnish (I have had it before in Phoenix), but my drink was delicious!

My brother ordered a vampire taco, which was one the more delectable things I have ever had there. I ordered the Mac+Cheese, always amazing. They have great burgers, my husband went simple and got the bacon cheeseburger. My brother got the truffle burger. He said it was super good. 

Overall, I love the atmosphere there. It's casual, but still has a elegant feel to it."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a lot and have loved everything I have tried. A couple of nights ago we went and got a couple of appetizers. The chicken flatbread, asada tacos and grilled artichoke. I also tried the gin and ginger cocktail which was beyond amazing! My husband ordered the tacos for himself but my couple of bites made me jealous that I didn't order them too. They have great pizzas and burgers. I am slowly making my way through the menu and have yet to be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I am not much of a beer drinker but the Edinger Weiss is pretty awesome for a NA. Great compliment to the Mac and cheese. I haven't had anything here that wasn't good. If you don't want to be disappointed, go to Yard House!"}
{"text":"Service by Brandi was amazing. Chose this restaurant based on proximity to our hotel. The beer selection is amazing! Over 100 beers on tap. We had the truffle burger and vodka shrimp pasta. Both were amazing. We went back the next day to take advantage of the happy hour prices."}
{"text":"I've been to the Yard House twice with my mother and each time was an enjoyable experience. The food was delicious, the beers were top quality and the service was certainly up to par with what I'd expect from a restaurant with The Yard House's quality. All in all, I would certainly recommend this place for a fun family night out or even for a date night. Make sure to try one of their many beers on tap."}
{"text":"Great place to watch some college football! While service is attentive and game day atmosphere is on point, the food here is great, but not super special. I ordered the lunch combo which gives you the choice of 1/2 sandwich or 1/2 pizza with a soup or salad. I went with the roast beef dip sandwich that comes with au jus and a creamy horseradish. The sandwich was hot and gooey from the Swiss cheese. For the salad, I chose the classic ranch salad. This was fresh, crisp, and really satisfying! Definitely a 5 star side salad. I also ordered a side of fries which were decent (nothing special). 

Overall, if you're out shopping at Fashion Square, don't hesitate to come here, but if you are able to leave the mall and head to the less \"chain\" restaurants for something different then do so!"}
{"text":"A favorite local spot for my hubby and I as we live just 10 minutes from Town Square. The food is always very good, although the atmosphere can be annoying sometimes with the insanely huge singles crowd simply there to drink and look for a date. My only pet peeve about this spot is that they don't have any type of call ahead seating or reservations, so if you go on Friday or Saturday, expect to wait at least an hour for a table. Something like that just bothers me, I don't care if you want to take a credit card to hold a reservation like the high end joints do here in Vegas, but at least give us the option of reserving a table! Other than the insane waits and sometimes slow service, the food is great! Try the lettuce wraps!"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed with service and food two days ago. We went for happy hour on my birthday.  Ordered my favorite chicken nachos. It was not good. Dry and no toppings. 4 pieces of chicken and actually couldn't find the beans. It's one of my favorite places to eat. I don't know what happened.  The mac-n-cheese my son ordered was good.  And some of the other food we ordered was ok too. Too bad. It will be a while before I try it again. 
I didn't complain to the manager. It would have ruined the birthday celebration."}
{"text":"OK first of all, Glendale/Peoria is a wasteland of chain eateries and overrated strip mall joints. We have spent many weeks in the area (usually for sporting events) and eaten out 50+ times at virtually every place that serves food. Being generous, the food choices and quality is very limited in the area. If you eat burgers, you will not starve, but you need to lower your expectations if you are from out of the area.

Having said that, the Yard House is one of the few \"chain\" places that offers a diverse menu, great refreshments and good service. The 80's music and tall \"yard\" beer glasses offer a signature touch and the place is usually packed so that has to be a good sign. Overall, this is one of the better places in the area, albeit on an adjusted scale. Can't go wrong with the burgers, beer and apps, but the farther you get away from this \"sweet spot\",the dicier the food gets. Overall, not a bad call, just not anything special."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas! Alittle pricey but very worth. Kids meals are big portions. Friendly staff. Chicken Tortilla Soup is my favorite."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful time at the Yardhouse tonight, dining on their patio, and enjoying the great Happy Hour deals.  We had a group of 14 women, and we were impressed by their well-trained staff.  We had people arriving at different times, so it was definitely a challenge.  Zack and Sharon did an amazing job serving us tonight, sorting out all the orders, and separated the checks. Zack even took a group photo for us.  Michelle and Shauna did a great job and helped support the effort.  Kudos to the manager and the assistant manager for their professionalism in making sure the night was wonderful!  Thanks for the great evening Yardhouse!"}
{"text":"Great selection of beers and the wings were spool good the Firecracker,  try it had the gorgonzola hamburger very tasty recommend it and the string fries very good"}
{"text":"I'm not usually a fan of chain restaurants, even upscale ones like the Yard House. However, I am a fan of the Yard House, and here's why: First, the beer selection; if you're a fan of craft beers like I am, you will appreciate the dozens of craft beer offerings, many of which I have never tried. The Bear Republic IPA was my favorite of the night. Second, the menu is interesting and the food flavorful. I had egg rolls and lettuce wraps; both were in Asian-fusion style and wonderfully flavored. Third, though some reviewers have complained about price, for Monday Night Football they have all-night happy hour, with half-priced beer, appetizers and pizza. You can order appetizers and eat Tapas style while you watch the game from a large number of big screens. With beers, my bill was only $25. Lastly, the service was friendly, attentive, knowledgeable and quick. How many places have a waitress that can and will talk about the relative merits of craft beers, suggest one over another, give you just long enough to decide then come back to take your order?  Sandra, you rock!"}
{"text":"Food is what I expect from Yard house. But the hold time was way longer than conveyed. While waiting by the kitchen observed kitchen staff handle trash and then food without changing gloves."}
{"text":"Very disappointing especially for the price! Server was terrible. My food order was wrong so I had to wait for them to cook the meal I ordered while I watched my husband finish his food.  Then when my dinner finally arrived I shoveled my food down because we both couldn't wait to get out of there. Great date night.  Won't be going back."}
{"text":"I have dined at Yard House restaurants in several cities.  The quality is consistently high.  I recommend it without reservation."}
{"text":"Nice place - the foodies of the world will disagree with this review but for those of us who are looking for a balance between the fast food joints at Desert Ridge and the fine dining options, this one works just fine.

Like most restaurants that share the concept, the menu is predictable. Something for everyone from salads to beef and everything in between. No problem bringing a group here.  They even have a nice kid's menu, desserts and an amazing selection of beers.

Service has always been friendly and they have a nice patio.
Good spot for lunch or before/after a movie."}
{"text":"We went here because they had a ton of vegan options. So many in fact that we over-ordered. The buffalo \"chicken\" tenders were amazing and I enjoyed the chopped salad with the bloody mary vinaigrette. I love salads that have an equal ratio of vegetables - including lettuce.

The service was great as well. One weird thing: they ask everyone that comes in if they have been there before. If you say no then there is just a welcome, the same as if you had said yes. You expect something \"special\" after a question like that so it is very awkward. We sat near the door so witnessed it over and over."}
{"text":"That is a racist place.me and my friend was drinking here and is having conversation?not disturbing anyone else. but the waitress Lensy insist to move us out because she think my friend is drunk. And the guard of Linq was terrible and insist that they can arrest us only because we stand on the streent. It was a terrible.experiences and I would never recommand this place to any asian friend of mine."}
{"text":"Very good service, very good food. The vegan burger is excellent, unlike a lot of places that serve vegetarian burgers which are tasteless.The beer list is endless. Will definitely go there again the next time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"Got the gluten free street tacos. Carnitas were good. Blackened Swordfish was amazing!  Spicy and delicious. 
Staff was very friendly and knowledgeable about gluten free. 
Husband got the street tacos as well and the ahi poke tower. Described them both in one word, \"food-gasm!!\""}
{"text":"This was my first time at the Yard House and it was a very pleasant experience. First off, I liked that the server said \"welcome ladies\" instead of the usual...HI GUYS that we usually get everywhere when we are WOMAN! Hello!! We are not guys. It is one of my pet peeves. The waitress was friendly and attentive that not overly bothersome, so I give Tai 5 stars!! 
I ordered a club sandwich and it was huge and stuffed full of turkey, avocado and bacon. They also substituted the fries for a house salad at no extra charge. They also had my favorite 4 peaks peach beer and it was nice and cold.  I will defiantly patronize this place again!!"}
{"text":"I think ordinarily I would give this place 3 stars, but this review is based on my experience here on New Year's Eve.  After attending a Coyotes game, we came over to the Yard House for a late dinner.  Not surprisingly, the place was packed but we were able to find a couch to sit on outside during our 1.5 hour wait for a table.  Yeah, that's a long time to wait for this place, but like I said it was NYE and we didn't have any later plans, so we didn't mind hanging out.  Coincidentally, you can get full bar and menu service on the couches outside and we enjoyed some drinks while happily waiting for a proper table and chairs for dinner.

The food was OK; nothing really to write home about.  My favorite part of the meal was probably dessert - the warm brownie with ice cream was a treat!  When we finished our meal, it was about 11:15 p.m. - definitely too late to go somewhere else to countdown to the new year.  So, we hung out.  Our waitress, Jaime, was very friendly and surprisingly attentive for how busy the restaurant was.  She gave us festive top hats, tiaras, and beads to wear to celebrate.  We were also provided with champagne for a midnight toast.   All of this was free, and there had been no cover charge to get in.  I thought that was a really nice touch.  At ten minutes to the hour, the music turned off and the volume on the TVs, which had all been switched to the big ball drop in NYC, was turned up.  Everybody in the restaurant excitedly awaited the arrival of the new year and when the clock struck 12 there was toasting and cheering.  Yeah, this may all sound very mellow, but it was a fun, relatively cheap (given that every other place had a cover charge and/or price fixe menu), safe place to bring in the new year."}
{"text":"Let's start with dessert first...the s'mores brownie is chocolate marshmallow gooey goodness! (Just don't dig in too soon or you'll scorch your mouth)! 

The blackened swordfish street tacos were also good - although I found the spicy rice was a bit much. The mac and cheese with chicken and bacon was rich and creamy. 

Hundreds of beers on tap. I had the Belgium sampler which let me try 6 different Belgium beers. 

Pleasant decor, good tunes and attentive wait staff."}
{"text":"I'm a total beer girl so even though they have some foo-foo drink options on their drink menu, it is their beer that gets me drooling. The bartenders are knowledgable enough to suggest beers I may like and if I don't, they offer me something else without charging me for the discarded drink! The food is on the pricey side but during Happy Hour it is well worth it."}
{"text":"I've eaten at the Yard House many times, and I've found that it's consistently pretty good - not great, but ok. I think it's hard to find places that are consistently average, but even harder to find places that are consistently slightly above average, well above average, or, hardest of all to find, consistently great. I like the fact that Yard House is consistent.. the fact that they're consistently slightly above average is even better.

Last night I had the BBQ Chicken Salad, which I thought was pretty good, and worth the price. It was definitely a man-sized salad, as I couldn't even finish the whole thing! I thought the salad was over-dressed...but that's pretty common. I don't think people generally understand what a properly dressed salad is. What's funny is that if you ask for \"light dressing\" at most restaurants you usually get a salad that is close to properly dressed. (Sorry for the tangent discussion on properly dressed salads.. one of my pet peeves.)  If I were to order this salad again (I probably will), I'd make sure to ask for light dressing.

I love the music at the Yard House - usually classic rock. I actually heard a song I liked and had to pull out my iPhone to Shazam it. Sometimes the music can get overbearingly loud if you're trying to carry on a conversation, but more often than not I don't find the volume to be an issue.

Wait staff is clean & well-groomed. Staff in general is friendly. Silverware and dishes are clean. Food (that I've eaten) seems to be average to above average quality.

I keep going back, so clearly I'm a fan."}
{"text":"I went here with my buddy and his friend who lives in Vegas and when I walked in I was surrounded by plasmas, hot babes, and beer. I wasn't sure where I was at because I was hungover but i quickly was filled with excitement and joy. It doesn't get much better than those three things for a man. 

We went here for lunch and the hostess asked us which game we wanted to watch because they seat you where the specific game is being played on their plethora of TVs. They usually try to get you in a spot so you can view most of the games.

We all got burgers and everyone seemed to like them. My mouth was watering from all of those taps behind the bar but my brain was saying no go. My liver would just have to wait until next time to try all of that deliciousness. The waitresses were nice, friendly, and funny and made the experience that much better.

I wish they would put on of these up north but the next time I am in Vegas this is where the night will start off."}
{"text":"This is my first time visiting this Yard House location. I can't say I was too pleased with the experience. They not only messed up my tables drink orders but delivered an entirely incorrect meal to one of us. The first server assigned to us had a horrible attitude and seemed bored and impatient. Just a little positivity goes a long way. The young man who relieved him though, he was gracious and very humble. Overall, it wasn't a bad enough time or meal to make me not want to visit this location again but it did leave a bit of a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time the other week. One of the best burgers I've ever had from a restaurant. Their beer list is huge. It's around 125 beers (not including bottles drafts) and sometimes can go up to 135-140 beers on tap depending on the seasonal/speciality beers they get in that month. I don't know what our bartenders name was, but she knew a ton about beer and kept giving us samples, oh yeah they will let you sample any beer you'd like!

If your a craft beer geek or just like trying new brews, this is your place to be! Definitely check out."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and never had any problems with service but I usually go to the bar. This visit I wanted to take a booth but I was seated outside which is what I wanted.  

It seemed packed when we got in but we were actually seated right away!  Our server was Lisa I believe and she was great. Always checked on us. Our drinks came first then our food.  My order did come out a little later then the rest of my party but I didn't really mind cause I've had something to drink and some appetizers.  Lisa did notice that my food wasn't out yet right when we were about to ask her.

She came out with my food and it was warm, it would have tasted better hot. I didn't make a big deal out of it as she was accommodating and apologized. She asked if I wanted to have them make another one but of course I didn't want to wait again when everyone is almost done so I said it was fine.  She insisted she'll get the GM as that wasn't ok.  The GM came out apologized, and asked if I wanted anything else and I said no. She also comp'd the meal. 

Overall, good experience.  I appreciated that they comp'd the meal but it wasn't necessary as their apology was enough and asked if I wanted a new plate; I just didn't have time to wait."}
{"text":"I have been eating at the Yard House for years, since it is so close to my house, and so close to the mall. I've always had decent service, but my last visit really turned out to be a great one. My boyfriend and I went to happy hour to watch the football game (they have TV's EVERYWHERE.) We ordered two apps and two drinks. While our drinks and my food came out quickly, his wings were taking an unusual amount of time. I was so impressed when the manager came out to apologize sincerely, and explain why they were taking so long. He brought them out as soon as they were ready and took them off our bill, again apologizing and making sure we had everything we needed. As a former server, I understand things happen but it really makes a difference when the staff go the extra mile!!! I will, of course, be returning :-)"}
{"text":"Been to many yardhouses and I have never been disappointed.  Always solid food and service and drinks.  A little loud but that is what you get at a big bar.  Definately worth going if you pick a chain to eat at."}
{"text":"This is gonna sound like a recurring theme, but I came here for a friend's birthday dinner. Not sure about the other Yard House locations, but this place is GIGANTIC. Ample indoor and outdoor seating with enough TVs to watch any and every sports game.

With their burgers, Asian influenced fare, pastas, and Gardein selections, their menu has something for everyone and it's just a matter of deciding what you want most. Eventually, I settled on a surf and turf burger, which has a beef patty topped with lobster, grilled asparagus, and a swiss and tomato béarnaise. The burger was all right, but I should've gone with my gut instinct and ordered the pepper jack burger. I dipped my fries into the béarnaise instead of putting it on my burger. Oops. Let me just say that I'm just a sucker for crisp fries and savory dipping sauces.

Figured I might as well get a drink since I could walk it off around Town Square. One hpnotini for me please! It's a balanced mix of pineapple juice, pineapple rum, hpnotiq, and vodka. Basically, sweet + fruity + alcohol = girly drink. I'd drink it again, but I'd want to try their Snake Bite, the birthday guy's favorite, before making repeat orders.

Even with about 20 or more people in our group, the wait staff never stopped being accommodating, patient, and attentive. Major kudos to them for being amazing to us despite having a full house on a Saturday night.

Celebration or not, Town Square's Yard House is a hot and casual spot for watching the game with some pals or get-togethers for a meal."}
{"text":"Incredibly diverse menu that makes you salivate through choices at Yard House, and portions are very generous.  But the best part is the people and managers/leaders at this location making it the best of the best.  People are so consumer and service oriented, you will be wow'd with the experience.  And even the guy in charge of it all came by to check on our food and service - Mike Meler head chef and exec in charge of it the night we were there - was amazing.  Highly highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Love the vegetarian menu!  Amani was very pleasant and attentive, and all the food was great! I sound 60 but the music was a bit loud and it was very cold, but the eats were fantastic. Our choices included tomato bisque, clam chowder, mac &cheese, and the gardein thai chicken noodle salad."}
{"text":"They have the best happy hours around, the food is good and their Martinis are even better. When its winter, we become regulars. :)"}
{"text":"Great beer specials during happy hour, lots of local brews too! I especially love their Gardein (faux meat) selections as I am a vegetarian. My favorite Gardein dish is the Orange Peel Chicken. It really is a great substitute for chicken, albeit its a little pricey."}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour. Awesome beer selection - for the beer lovers. Awesome food. 1-10 I would give service a 5, it can be good or bad. 

Town Square is an awesome location and this place is a win if the weather is nice and you can eat on the patio. 

The menu is huge, I try to sample something new each visit. Last time I went with the NY Steak Salad, AMAZZZINGGG. The silders are awesome also!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to take a ditzy first date because they play the music so loud it's impossible to have any kind of a decent conversation. The reason I come to a restaurant is to eat and maybe have a chat with the person I'm sitting next to. If I want loud, blaring music I'll go to a club. Don't try to do both. Minus one.

Now, on to the food, which is actually quite good.

Seared Ahi Sashimi - It was fresh, but too much black pepper around the edges for me. I also didn't care for the heavy vinaigrette it was sitting in.
Fried Calamari - Pretty good although I'd like more rings and fewer squid tentacles, thanks.
Classic Sliders - Very traditional sliders, not bad. Fries are awesome.
Grilled Korean BBQ Beef - Tasted very authentic, just as good as any Korean restaurant.
Spinach Cheese Dip - Not the best I've ever had, but then again how can you mess up spinach dip?
Linguini & Clams - I loved this dish. Clams were fresh and the sauce was tasty.
Draft Beer - A+

The service was just ok. Our waitress did the bare minimum necessary to keep us happy. I agree the best time to come here is during happy hour. Any other time it's just way overpriced. I mean, $10 for eggrolls, really? Minus two.

Will I be back? Yes, but probably only during happy hour and I would recommend you give it a try if you haven't been here before."}
{"text":"Excellent Vampire Tacos and $5 appetizers!
Kerrah was an extraordinary server. She made our dining experience easy, fun and personal."}
{"text":"Great selection of beers and food options.  Would give even a higher rating but everytime i frequent this place, I realize that it's a little on the pricey side.  I've heard that the Happy Hours are fantastic (but in all honesty, I've never made it during this time period.)  However, if you're looking for a place to try a fantastic selection of beers, this is a great place.  

Be forewarned, this place is busy on the weekends.  Great Cajun chicken sandwich and their truffle fries are addictive."}
{"text":"The outdoor terrace upstairs is really nice. Food and drink options are abundant and everything tasted great! To top it off, our server was awesome! I would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I dont usually go to chain restaurants but my roomie was craving these veggie faux chicken wings (which i sampled and were pretty decent. I agreed to join her and must say was fairly impressed with the Lobster & Asparagus burger (natural meat, cooked perfectly medium rare). Even more so i was impressed by the attention paid to us by Emily the waitress. This nice young lady was on task! She made a great wine recommendation, subbed out the fries for steamed veggies, and what a great meal! Also picked at the fries my roomie ordered and wished i could have had a bit more restraint on them, cuz they were great, but not in my diet!"}
{"text":"Great food, beer menu that suits about anyone, and we had really great service. I have been to several Yard House locations and this is my favorite."}
{"text":"yard house is the best place at Westgate.  The food was a little pricy but can't beat the food and drinks there.  The service was great.  We had terrible service at Kabuki next door and gave this place a shit. Will be back. Never go to Kabuki."}
{"text":"After a night of bowling, clubbing or seeing a movie at the hotel this is a great spot to hit for a late snack or dinner.  I love the spicy jambalaya and make this my go to dish."}
{"text":"Great spot for drinks and apps.  I think the entrees are over rated."}
{"text":"So good!! I've been twice and I have had great service and amazing food!! I would totally go back !!"}
{"text":"Good place to hang out and catch a few beers."}
{"text":"Great beer offerings with good food and a fun casual place."}
{"text":"When i first came here with my family, i was not expecting a whole section of vegetarian items! Being a vegetarian, it is hard to find places like this where i can get away from plain old boring mashed potatoes or fries. Thankful for this place! the Gardein hot wings are my absolute favorite!! Very filling and delicious. Definitely one of my top restaurants. Wide variety for vegetarians and meat eaters!"}
{"text":"The food here is just plain delicious, service is great, atmosphere's great. However the music is very loud and its hard to hear at times. If you like BJ's you will like this place. Both have same food quality and modern atmospheres. Overall the experience is great and well worth it."}
{"text":"Very unique location for this consistent franchise. The linq promenade is a welcomed improvement (used to be a back alley street between hotels). Lots of activity to observe as you walk to the yardhouse. 

I had 3 street tacos (chicken tinga, Korean pork belly, blackened swordfish). All were very good as spices chosen hot the palate in many areas. Did the Belgian and ipa beer flights/tasters and enjoyed trying many beers for a leer price. Great service and lively atmosphere"}
{"text":"Ok so my last 2 -3 trips to YH were lackluster, as I previously wrote about.

But I have to give props for my visit on 7/26, and our server Jameson.

He didn't mess up a single order for our entire group, got drinks and shots and refills out quickly, and was really fun and entertaining.

Our group ordered the coconut shrimp appetizer, chicken nachos, poke stack, a vegan BBQ Gardein salad, Gardein pasta, a chicken enchilada stack, a couple burgers and whatever else I can't remember.

The food was good, served hot and it makes all the difference in the world to have an efficient server!

Nice job, Yard House."}
{"text":"We have family visiting from out of town who wanted to try Yard House. I called in the morning and spoke to Tim, the manager on shift.  I tried for a 5:00 reservation but nothing was available.  I asked him what was the next available time was after 5:00.  He said for a party our size (11 people) he could do 6:00 and put it down.  I confirmed before hanging up party of 11 for 6:00.  He said yes.  We show up at 5:45 and our reservation is not down and the restaurant is packed with a wait time of 50 minutes for a table.  We have 5 kids with us, no way we can wait 50 minutes, hense the reason for my reservation.  Tim was still there so I asked to speak to him.  He tried saying he told me to get there 45 minutes before our reservation time and there is nothing he could do.  He never said that.  Plus thats what reservations are for so you don't have to get there 45 minutes before.  If my experience was just dealing with Tim this restaurant would get zero stars.  He was awful.  I asked to speak with someone higher up.  I normally would just  give up at this point but because we had family fly in from 3000 miles away we wanted them to eat there since thats where they wanted to try.  Anyway, the GM Jeri came out and spoke w me.  I explained to her our situation and she was very understanding and apologetic.  There was a party of 18 just closing out and she said she would clean that table off for us.  Not only did the GM of the restaurant personally clean our table off she gave us a free round of drinks while we waited.  That would have been enough to compensate.  When the waiter came over he said appetizers were on the house too.  We could not have been more happy with the way the situation was handled.  Jeri was great and because of her we will be returning.  I will just make sure Tim is not the manager taking my reservation.  Not sure how he became a manager of a restaurant like this."}
{"text":"This place had good service and an excellent staff! There portions are considerably big given there middle if the road prices, and if its the drink u crave there shots are huge. Couple all of this with the really cute waiters and its a night of fun."}
{"text":"3 days ago I said I'd be back for more of the tomato bisque, and I did.  

Thinking I've never sat at the bar before, I did today. Such a better experience than all the times I've been here before. Maybe because it was relatively slow today, I dunno. But I enjoyed myself. Lauren & Kat were great!"}
{"text":"I've been to the yard house a few times. Love sitting on the patio, and enjoy the chopped salad with avocado. Only critique  would be that the salad should be a big bigger."}
{"text":"It's a Saturday night, this place is packed but we were still able to get seating pretty fast (3 minute wait). Our appetizer came out fast and it was delicious (cheese curds). The food, service, and atmosphere was great, no complaints."}
{"text":"Dear Corporate Yardhouse:

How Do I begin? Well, lets start from the beginning.  My name is Kirpal and I am from the Pacific North West and have been an avid Seattle Seahawks fan for some years now. I currently live in Dallas where I have my current job as a General Dentist.  I decided to take time off work and visit Glendale, Arizona for the Superbowl XLIX game on Feb 1st and paid nearly $1000 for my return flight, $300/night for hotel and then waited patiently since 8am at your Yardhouse location so that we could get a table for our group of 20!

As 10am approached we were seated to our table and enjoyed all the festivities that occurred before the big game and enjoyed the Wings, and a Burger. I decided right then and there since we had a large group that I would pay for my items directly as I received them so not to confuse anyone once everyone is ready to leave. I made my first purchase on my credit card, which included a Stone IPA, burger and wings. My following orders, which were also Stone IPA, were all paid in cash.  My waitress was very good about bringing the bill directly to me after each pint, which was around $8 and I would give her $10 including tip every time. The waitresses changed throughout the afternoon but they all understood I was paying as I was being served for all my beverages.

As there was about 1 final minute left in the game, which I took time off of work to watch and spent a lot of money on flights and hotels to be with my friends for this FINAL moment of the game, the manger of this Glendale Arizona Yardhouse, Felicia Gilletti approached me.   While I'm trying to watch this final play she has this bill in a black pleather holder about 4 inches from my face and sternly says \"You have this bill to pay!\" I was so shocked not about the bill at first but more so that she was shoving this piece of fabric  nearly 4 inches into my personal space and accusing me that I have to pay a bill which I know that does not exist since I have been paying for every drink as it came in cash! I explained to her that I had paid my first order on credit card and subsequent orders in cash and that she can go ahead and verify my card. I showed her my card which had my name, Dr................ on it. Her response was \"Your not a real doctor because a doctor would pay his bill!\" At this point my shock had still not waived off and I wasn't sure if I was more shocked about her shoving a piece of pleather 4 inches from my face, or her first accusation, or her blunt insult.

At this point I really wanted to get back and watch the game and paid the $40 that was claimed on the bill even though I also told her she was mistaken for the bill as I had been paying cash and I believe it was one of my other friends' bill who also was drinking the same brand of beer sitting across from me. I also told her that it was very rude of her to shove something like that in my face without even considering my personal space. And finally I told her it was very unprofessional of her to insult me even when I asked her to verify my credit card for my earlier bill and she could also verify with the many waitresses that my patronage was in good standing. Her response was that I would be getting kicked out soon as she collected my  $40. She immediately called security and I paid a bill that not only was mine but also ruined a special moment lost in the final minute of the game with my closest friends after waiting in hours in line!

Thanks Yardhouse for terrific customer service!

Unsatisfied customer,
 
I have written a letter to the Corporate office and my whole table who witnessed this abuse will also be writing letters to the main office and also will be leaving reviews here on Yelp! I will not be back as long as Felicia Gilletti is their Manager, as she is a poor reflection of Yardhouse's  exceptional customer service! She was extremely  insulting, rude, and very unprofessional in the way she handled the situation. I spent nearly $100 myself during the Superbowl game and she ruined it with her ignorance!  

I look forward to hearing how this establishment will respond to this horrendous experience!

Sincerely,

Kirpal



As expected! Corporate got back to me and basically took their stupid managers side and claimed I was in the wrong. THEIR MANAGEMENT IS HORRIBLE AT THIS LOCATION! This franchise will not collect a single dollar from me or my family again!"}
{"text":"I've visited this location multiple times, mostly for date night and always had a good experience!"}
{"text":"I have been here over 4 times and I enjoy it. It does get a little hectic during the peak dinner hours bit the staff is usually pretty friendly and helpful with your dining requests. Their pork belly banh mi sandwich is really good and I don't if it's just because of the hype with Vietnamese food or the location but $13 is a bit much for only half a sandwich considering a full banh mi hoes for maybe $4. They have a pretty good selection of beers and wines. It's a nice establishment and the location is great especially after you are done strolling through the plaza!"}
{"text":"Over rated. Better food else where. Waitress did not bother to refill my iced tea when she brought over refills for my husband and son. My turkey club sandwich - dry. Although I did enjoy the small side of Cesar salad, hence the 2 stars."}
{"text":"Didn't know you have to inform the Waiter's to take your kids to use the restroom. When we came back to our table, not even 10 mins everything was gone including coaster's. I thought we just put in our order's to find out we were completely kicked to the curb. Once cleared up the food was ok. Yeah just ok! I will not go here again! Never had that happen at any restaurant before."}
{"text":"So my son was getting married at Caesars Palace.  I needed a place to have his rehearsal dinner.  I called Yard House, and set up a beautiful menu with Megan Knoch in Miami.  She was the easiest person to deal with, and very accommodating.  Any questions I had, she would get back to me right away.  When the time came, Yard House @ The Linq took such good care of us.  They had plenty of staff waiting on our guests.  They were all so friendly, and happy to get whatever anyone wanted.  All of our guests raved about the food!  We were all extremely happy!!  For the day of the wedding I had ordered platters of food for the bride, and grooms rooms for the wedding party to eat while getting ready.  Dominick the manager called me to assure me they would have the food ready when the groomsmen came to pick it up.  He wanted to make sure our order would be at the maximum best for us, and it was.  Dominick was so amazing to work with, and when the groomsmen brought the food to our room.  They raved about the incredible service Yard House provided for us!!!  I highly recommend this location!!!  I will definitely go back next time I'm in Vegas!!!  Outstanding!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent location and the wait staff was very attentive.

You just can't beat that beer selection... my weakness.

The Cuban sandwich was VERY good!!"}
{"text":"This place has really good food.  The customer service is above and beyond.  I've not only experiences first hand, but had friends that have had waiters/waitresses mess up an order and they have always made it more than right.  Very rarely come across a business with such excellent customer service!  Great dim lighted atmosphere.  Very good wings as well"}
{"text":"Solely based on Adam's performance this place is a great spot love the sugared rims for lemonade this guy always kept them coming. Favorite thing about place him and the lemonade!"}
{"text":"Well, after my terrible experience a few weeks ago, I wrote all about it and I was contacted immediately by someone from their customer relations department. I spoke with her on the phone and explained the situation and she was very kind and understanding. A few days ago, I received a Yard House gift card in the mail from her... now that is what I call customer service! I am not usually one to complain in order to get free meals but I feel that they needed to know there was a problem and she reassured me that they would work on it. So, I am sure our bad experience was a fluke (hopefully) and we will be returning to use our gift card :)"}
{"text":"I popped in last night before the concert. It was somewhat busy, but they had plenty of staff. I had 3 beers and dude totally forgot about my beer twice. On the last beer, I had to flag down someone else to get it after about 10 minutes on empty. Not cool."}
{"text":"I just was at Yardhouse, a place I have been to often with my girlfriend. This time I went as a single male to watch NBA finals. I finished my two beers and waited  15 plus minutes for my tab. When I finally had to ask for my tab I was told I didn't have one (they always take a cc), so I told the bartender they took my cc. He must have took offense cuz he smart assed to me to \"just leave\". I had not even spoken one word to him prior. I told him forget his tip, and I spoke with  Eric the general manager, who was partial to staff, and basically said \"get lost\". Bad overall experience."}
{"text":"Been here twice now. The food was good the first time -- it's expensive for what it is, but what can you expect being in the middle of Town Square.

The first time, things went okay. It was a weekend, but an off-hour, so the place wasn't very busy. Service was fine. Food was pretty good.

The latest time, it was an entirely different story. My sister and I decided to go there and ended up being there at the same time as a wedding reception. Not a big deal; we choose to sit outside under the heater and enjoy the early evening weather. My sister gets a beer, I get a soda, standard stuff. Service is slow, but not terrible.

Then we order.

My sister and I eventually run out of conversation topics. I get a refill after a long wait, she gets another beer. I look down at my phone and it's been basically half an hour since we ordered -- WTF? No information at all.

Eventually our server finally tells us what happened -- My sister's food got picked up by someone and given to the wedding reception guests!! They have had to start her order over entirely. Two refills and another half hour later, they finally bring it out.

My food is luke-warm and uninspiring, while hers is okay. It is nothing to write home about, especially for the price paid. We ask if we are getting any sort of consolation for having to wait over an hour for our food.

The manager decides that the employee discount is fine, which amounts to /less than one of the beers/ off of our ticket (which had two meals, two beers, and one drink). For having to wait nearly an hour for what we ordered. I could understand if there was some complaining, like \"Oh, our order came out on time but there was some trivial thing wrong\", but this was entirely on them, both the delay in telling us what happened and the delay in fixing it.

Not going back again. The slow service, overpriced and under-delivered food, and insanely lame fix for their mess up put me off forever. There are better places to go without wandering through Town Square."}
{"text":"Great place for draft beer. Also good spot to pregame at. Food is pretty good. Pizza here is nothing to brag about. For the most part probably one of my favorite places to just sit and have a beer at Westgate."}
{"text":"We had our first visit to Yard house this past weekend to celebrate an engagement. ..food, drinks and staff were all great !! Very accommodating to our large number of diners .....we will definitely be back and highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Wow, tonight was one of the first time we had an unpleasant dining experience at the Yard House.  Everyone is normally happy with big smiles on their face except our waiter tonight Justin.  Sadly to say, our friend had to call over a manager to complain.  She was great and got it turned around to a much better situation. We normally wouldn't complain but with all four of us noticing the attitude in the first 10 minutes we just couldn't let it go.   Of course, the food was still great just took a while to get to us especially my drink which took about 25 mins. and it still didn't come out the way I requested it.  I know the restaurant was crowded so tried to take that into consideration but still the customer service should have been better.  

Sorry Yard House you may need to be your own secret shopper.  =)"}
{"text":"They have an awesome inside area, but we opted for the outdoor seating. Complete with misters. Great Classic Rock playing everywhere and more TVs than I could count. 

If it were at all possible to have too much of a beer selection, this place would be guilty.....But we all know its not! 
Incredible selection of beers from around the world and our waitress could easily be called a Doctor of Brews! Melody is her name, beer is her game! My wife and I are pretty educated on beers and she simply knew more! 
We started with a Belgian Flight, they were all very good, but the La Trappe Quad was the standout. It was the most aggressive Quad and was simply amazing! 
We started off with Kung Pao Calamari w/ brown rice and it was delicious. From there, I went for a friend's suggestion of the Pastrami Benedict Burger with Mac & Cheese. Let me say, interesting and huge. Cooked to perfection. Burger, Pastrami, Fried Egg with a delicious creamy sauce. Mac & Cheese was simple yet yummy! 
My wife went for the Blue Crab Cakes and loved them. Crispy and fluffy at the same time. 
When the check came, we were still happy!"}
{"text":"Went in about 9pm on Thursday night and surprisingly busy. I waited about 10 minutes for a table. Good service,  the waiter always came by to check on the refills of water and beer. I love the beer selection they offered here. Ordered tuna poke, Wisconsin cheese curd, BBQ chicken pizza and seabass entree. The food was good,  my seabass sauce was a little too sweet for me but it well cooked. Good food, awesome beer and reasonable price."}
{"text":"Took son with family here as a last dinner before he returned to college. We came early (5:30) and the place was just starting to get filled. Waiter was attentive and friendly. Food was tasty but portion size was small with my two asada tacos with rice and beans, my son's scallop dish, and side of sweet potato fries. Other dishes were fine (jumbulaya, cheese sandwich w/tomato soup, and orange chicken), but everyone finished their entire plates. We ordered dessert because we were not quite full. Our trio dessert was okay, but my daughter's chocolate dessert was not served warm as described. I think we will return for lunch next time, as this place doesn't serve enough food for dinner even after spending over $25 a person."}
{"text":"Manager cut our group off after we spent around $1000 on food and drinks. We were ID'd every time we ordered drinks. Made the process of getting drinks and food a pain in the ass. 2nd time this happen by the way. Prepare to be hassled. Oh yeah tried to order two drinks at the bar for my wife and I...yep they need 2 ID's and that still doesn't guarantee it."}
{"text":"Love the desserts and the ice teas!!!! Servers are always nice, some times a little to formal and a little uncomfortable for my taste. Ive dined here several times and had various entree items all very good!"}
{"text":"Best happy hour around. Try the california roll poke style. Not a fan of the rib eye. A little on the small side and over cooked. The chocolate suffe is excellent though. Also try to order beers that are on the popular side as the ones that sit in the draft lines get flat."}
{"text":"I got the Nashville Hot Chicken and was disappointed. Out came a boneless chicken breast battered and fried. They must have missed the \"hot\" part of the description and the chicken was obviously prepared earlier in the day and reheated. The fried sage was fried flavorless and while the sweet potato pancakes were alright, they were cold and floppy. For nearly $17 for my plate it was a waste.
My wife liked her chicken sandwich, for what it counts for I'm not sure.
Service was fine but got off to a slow start and it took about 15 minutes to get water in front of us. After that our server was excellent.
For how much is made of the beer menu, it wasn't that expansive- definitely above average though.

Bottom line- if you want good beer selection and appetizers it's good, but if you want a quality fried chicken (with the bone in!) there are other places less expensive, with fresh food and better service."}
{"text":"Phenomenal Beer Selection. Food is good. Had the nachos, generous portion and cheesy enchilada soup. Both very good. We were seated out in a patio area I'm guessing and it was dark. My wife had to use her phone to read the menu that was a let down. Granted it was their first weekend. 

Pretty nice inside as well as its brand new. I do like the one in Cincy a lot more."}
{"text":"This place is good, however overrated.
Very expensive if it's not happy hour,
Crowded and quite slow service, it's good food and you probably won't be disappointed but there are a lot of places for the same price where you will have a larger selection of food and a more relaxing experience... If your at town square try Brios, if your at red rock hotel try Lucilles smokehouse. The yard house needs to lower their prices , they think they are the only good food joint in town. They better be careful, this is Las Vegas not Grand Rapids, MI... There is serious competition here,
I predict the redrock Yardhouse will start to lose biz because of the new Lucille's ,
Only thing that will save them is to offer
More specials. 

Another thing is their bartenders are typical
Punks, and me as a local do not feel welcome there, I feel like just another touristic foreigner. I won't go back,
This place is for tourists whom don't care 
About the cost

Goto Lucille's, amazing all around, stop supporting overpriced mediocre restaurants like the Yardhouse"}
{"text":"The service was outstanding... Nice Job Felipe!  Food was well described, and perfectly cooked.   Do not miss visiting this restaurant.   Love, love,  love this place!"}
{"text":"Endless selection of micro brews and a great asian app!"}
{"text":"My husband & I stopped here after attending a funeral in Westlake. We were seated right away since it is a Thursday evening around 7:30. We were given a drink menu along with a regular dinner menu. We both made a drink selection & our server commented about the good choice of draft my husband selected. A few minutes later she returned & asked my husband again what beer he chose? He repeated his selection & off she went. A delivery person dropped off my glass of $11 wine & attempted to deliver my husbands beer to the table behind us. When they told her the beer didn't belong there she then realized her mistake & gave it to my husband. Our server returned & we placed our dinner order over the loud background music as she attempted to up-sell all the fancy items on the menu. We both ordered sandwiches, I thought it was odd that the server didn't ask my hubs for his side dish option. Off she went & we waited for our meals to arrive. When the delivery person dropped them off, we mentioned the plate my hubs received wasn't what HE ordered. Our server returned & asked how everything was? We then told her his dish wasn't what he ordered. He ordered a chicken sandwich & received a chicken dinner instead with pancakes? Really? He had already begun eating the chicken & she offered to return it. He said no, but it wasn't what he ordered. He just didn't want to wait for another plate to come out or have them turn the big huge chicken breast into a sandwich. She said she wanted to bring him a dessert in lieu of the wrong dish. He said no, she suggested fries, he said no. The fries he didn't want arrived anyhow. He continued to eat the chicken and thought it tasted good but thought the side of pancakes was very odd. 
When we finished eating & my hubs said he thought the chicken dinner that he didn't order might have been removed from the bill or possibly reduced to the sandwich price in lieu of her mistake. Nope the full cost of the chicken dinner was on the bill.
Shame on this server for allowing this to happen on her watch. In all my married years with this man I can't ever remember him refusing to leave at least a 20% tip. Well it happened today. Our bill was $52 & she was left $3. 
And the server that was taking id's from the table behind us was explaining to those guests that she always checked ID'S unless you have wrinkles, then you wouldn't need to offer up your ID. I turned around and chuckled. She realized the comment was loud enough to offend a wrinkled guest overhearing her comment. My comment here is my wrinkled face won't ever visit this place again, these millennials don't need my old money!! 
And this restaurant will only be a glimmer of a memory when the doors close because they really won't be around very long. The trendy atmosphere will succumb to reality when the next trend changes!!"}
{"text":"Great food great customer service awesome location ok prices great for adults lots of alcoholic drinks"}
{"text":"Truffle fries are delicious. And free
Samples of beer are a plus. Only downside... No pitchers"}
{"text":"I ordered Turkey & Bacon Melt 2. 0. (Swiss & fontina cheese, roasted romas, crushed avocado, pickled jalapeño spread) I usually don't order turkey but this sandwich rocks!!!"}
{"text":"First let me start by saying their beer selection= heaven. The beer list, is not only in order of type (which makes it easy to find a beer you know you like and look Below it to find something similar to try out) but also alphabetical and progressive. 

The food...DECENT. definitely not the selling point for this place,  but for a place that's selling point IS  a yard of beer...decent.  

Service: very attentive, waters & beers always full, bartenders are great at making recommendations for beer (when your being annoyingly indecisive about  which fashion  you plan to get inebriated). Matt is my favorite! He makes great conversation and recommendations such a genuine person and a huge reason we visit yardhouse! 

Bottom line, if your not  freshly 21 and stoked about drinking a beer out of a yardstick then this place may notice be AS amazing to you, but it certainly does not disappoint when your in the mood for some grub and beer! Food can be pricey, menu is huge and so are the entrees so there's no harm in sharing an entree with a friend...more room for beer!"}
{"text":"Yardhouse is my favorite restaurant. Great atmosphere, awesome service and the food is always yummy. Great beer selection as well and I love the inside outside seating options. This place is a staple in our date nights and can't say enough good things about it."}
{"text":"First time dining at this place last week and I loved it! They have pretty good portion sizes as far as the pizza was concerned and it tasted great! Great energy, and I got to watch the game from my table. Would've gave 5 stars but the server seemed to disappear at times. All in all a great experience. Will return for sure."}
{"text":"Happy hour is so good! Ahi nacho is a must try! Sounds weird but it's so good! Also a lettuce wrap is bomb also!"}
{"text":"They have great Happy Hour selections and prices. They even have a Happy Hour that starts after 10pm. A friend and I stopped in after a movie and were pleasantly surprised. I've always had great service and food. The grilled cheese sandwich and tomato soup is amazing!"}
{"text":"This place has the best lettuce wraps! This is a perfect fit for my current lifestyle change. Also I love the fact that you can enjoy your meal on the patio. Great attentive servers as well! :-)"}
{"text":"Service was really good, the food was terrible. Still left a tip because it wasn't the waiters fault that the steak was made of rubber."}
{"text":"I love this Yardhouse. Every meal I have here is top notch. I've ordered multiple things on the menu and never been disappointed. If you want a good meal and a couple of great draft beers- this is the place!"}
{"text":"The food was great but honestly who cares, they have 115 beers on tap.  Went twice last week while at nearby conference.  Both waitresses were super knowledgable about the beer, brought samples to try, and helped me choose a great brew every time. I think I might move to AZ!"}
{"text":"Have not been here in a while.Always had great service in the past,so went last night for a beer and some food.Got acknowledged pretty quick within seconds of sitting down.I didn't know what kind of beer I wanted so told the bartender I needed a drink menu and a minute or so to decide on beer.Well that was a huge mistake because he never came back to take my order.Granted, they were busy,but I seriously sat there waiting to order a drink for 10 to 15 minutes.I wouldve just left but was with friends who had got there before me and already had drinks.There were about 4 bartenders behind the bar, all of which ignored me.Finally, We had to flag one down after he came within our vicinity to take orders from people who arrived well after I did.I understand they were busy, but Even when they got a little breather, They would hurridly walk like they were doing something important only to see them stop and do something like fold a napkin, or put down a fresh coaster for someone who already had a drink.I wanted food, but knew that was never gonna happen.So I didnt bother asking for a menu.I finally again got one of thier attention and ordered off of memory.Food was good but pricey for the size.Also the garlic chicken noodles barely had any chicken in it, but still was good.The atmosphere was ok except for the fact that they had the ac blaring on  57 degree night.I got so uncomfortably cold I had to leave.It was warmer outside.No need for ac when its less than 60 degrees outside.Service did get a little better when the crowd thinned out, but overall it was a pretty annoying experience.Definately not worth the headache."}
{"text":"After having a couple less than favorable dining experiences at the Fashion Square Mall location, I was in no hurry to try this location. But we were at the mall for some other things a couple months ago and decide to give this location a try.

I am glad we did. It is definitely a big step up from the Fashion Square Mall location and we have been quite happy with our experiences on the times we have been back since. The three different menu items I have tried have all been enjoyable and well prepared and the others in my parties have all complimented their food items. 

The menu seems to have changed since the last time I was at a Yard House and it seems much better now. There is a great variety, so it is a good place to go with with people that have different tastes. The service has been quite good on our visits and they provide a comfortable atmosphere to dine in. The one exception is that it seems to get quite loud in the dining area.

I have no problem whatsoever recommending this location of the Yard House and foresee it working its way into the rotation of places we dine at on a regular basis."}
{"text":"I have lived in the Phoenix area since 1977 and have tried restaurants all over the state. If you are looking for the best Chicken Tortilla soup EVER, you need to go to the Yard House. I always go to the location at Scottsdale Fashions Square - usually to meet family & friends before a great shoppping excursion. We make a point to have lunch here. I absolutley LOVE the Chicken Tortilla soup! I always order a cup of soup and a small salad and I'm never disappointed. The soup has HUGE chunks of chicken in a lightly spicy & creamy sauce that will keep you coming back. I love that they top the soup with chunks of avacado, tortilla chips and cheese.I guess I really don't need the salad because the soup is so filling, but I have to get my greens! The service has always been great.

My friends and family have tried other dishes as well and have always had a favorable review. They have many alcoholic beverage choices and something to please everybody. I would higly recommend theYardhouse!"}
{"text":"Saw an employee in the Men's bathroom shove garbage down the can to compact it with his bare hand and then walk out without washing them. Proceeded to work the front desk and when I told him to wash his hands, he said they were clean. He continued to handle customers. I apprised Management and they barely had a 'Talk' with him, please avoid this health hazard!"}
{"text":"Best clam chowder I've ever had--I've had it on both US coasts. Nice outdoor seating with overhead heaters. Not the best if you don't want to be by smokers, though. Back home there is no smoking in public places so that is something to keep in mind."}
{"text":"Hey Yard House.  If you are going to have an open kitchen you may want to start paying better attention to Health and Sanitation Guide lines.  You're Kitchen was an absolute Mess.  clutter everywhere, plastic bags with product in them resting on the steam table.  I watched one of you're cooks brush off a grill at the same time Chicken breast were on the Grill.  YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELVES!!!!!   My Girlfriend and my self were going to eat drink and spend money.  But instead you lost customers.  You're kitchen was absolutely filthy.  And you're Establishment was not very busy. I know that will be you're first excuse!!!   You're unsanitary conditions Suck!!!!"}
{"text":"Love the Yard House!!  We don't really drink so can't comment on the beer, but have loved every food item tried.  Good music but looses 5th star due to music way too loud for an eating establishment.

Red Rock is my favorite casino, so glad they added a restraunt we can truly enjoy."}
{"text":"First of all, the waitress was so rude! It was my first time eating here with my husband and I was really disappointed! My patty was pretty burnt! The fries were good, super crispy! It was extremely loud and I'd rather go to McDonalds for a burger, yes... That's how bad my experience was. They will never see me walk in those doors again."}
{"text":"Overpriced and overrated. Service was friendly but just \"okay\". Restaurant is very dark in the evening to the point where we couldn't read menu or beer selections without assisted lighting in our booth. I ordered the Pastrami Benedict Burger medium rare and it came medium to almost well done. Fries were cold. They offer you truffle, sweet potato or garlic besides the regular fries but be advised that is a $1 up charge. Beer selection is good but also overpriced. I will not return for dinner but perhaps for a happy hour. IMHO you can get better food for much less elsewhere."}
{"text":"We had a group of 12, and the wait was about 15 minutes; not too long being a Saturday. Our waiter was great too, and he split our checks with no issues."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place is listed under (vegan). Nothing is vegan here, except for the Gardein products, which they batter with non-vegan ingredients (egg,milk). 

Trying very hard not to use foul-language to express my disgust and frustration towards the staff, and the way they handled a mistake that was made on their part. After explaining my low-maintenance dietary needs (because I am allergic to dairy), I was assured it was safe to eat the food. NOT. The waiter was NOT educated about the menu, and when the manager came by to....I dunno, blame ME for the misunderstanding, there was no apology, and no remorse. Plenty of attitude though.

On the upside, she decided not to charge me for the meal I only took one bite of (which made me extremely sick from my allergy), and thought she did me a favor. 

I will NEVER come back to this place, and I will NEVER recommend it. This review doesn't even begin to illustrate how nasty the service was. Is this how Yard House treats their guests?? 

Extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The beer menu is a little overwhelming at first, but it's well organized, so you can find the right beer pretty quickly.  Happy hour prices are ridiculous - I feel guilty getting so much good food for so little money.  (Regular prices are higher, of course, but pretty reasonable.)  And not only is the food good, but the menu is eclectic.  Before our first visit, someone recommended that we try the California Roll appetizer.  Not what you think of when you see \"California roll,\" but excellent.  On our most recent visit, I had the Nashville Hot Chicken; also very good.  The atmosphere is, let's say, boisterous.  So if you're looking for a quiet dinner, this might not be the place.  We've visited four or five times, and the service has always been outstanding.  Even though this is a pretty large restaurant, unless you go on a weekday afternoon, you might have to wait a bit.  We've always been able to get a drink at the bar, however, so waiting has not been a problem.  In short, I highly recommend Yard House at Crocker Park."}
{"text":"This place is nothing short of absolutely fantastic. The food is delicious and their house white ale is stunning. You also get stellar service!! Richard was our server and was kind and attentive in all the right ways. Love it!!"}
{"text":"We visited Yard House at Red Rock Casino twice when visiting family in Summerlin over Memorial Day weekend, once for drinks (just me and my husband) and once for lunch (the whole family).

Highlights
-Yummy beers (extensive selection - house craft beers were delicious)
-Chicken nachos - HUGE portion good for sharing
-Great kids menu choices
-Tasty, non-greasy fish and chips

And the best part was definitely the service - everyone from the hostess to bartender to servers were very friendly, engaged, went out of their way to make sure we were happy."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Service, food selection, plate presentation, taste and atmosphere. This place has it all."}
{"text":"Fantastic Happy hour Food!~!~!
Terrific service, and spoiled the entire time I was there!~!~!

Taking girlfriends of 35 years (our 1x a year get together, since cheer leading in High School together) there Friday for our first night together :) Everyone is going to L O V E this place!~!~!"}
{"text":"Had lunch today and it was excellent and so was the service! Never eaten here before and I'll definitely be back. We started out with the chicken nachos they were very good, loaded all the way through!! I ordered the vampire tacos, delicious. My sister ordered the pepper crusted gorgonzola burger with truffle fries and she loved everything. Our server Isla was wonderful!! Great experience, yummy food, I highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection,over 100 taps, some nice IPA's.  Food was pretty solid, tried the deviled eggs with tomato sauce, pear and gorgonzola flatbread, and a fish taco.  Town square is a great location away from the casinos."}
{"text":"Fantastic service and great food. Had an issue with the calamari being chewy and the manager was very quick to come to my table. He addressed my issue and comped the appetizer. The rest of my meal was fantastic and my wife had the creme brûlée dessert and loved it. I love this place."}
{"text":"Second time having dinner here this week. Great place! Such friendly staff! Thank you to James our server! Such a nice guy! He went out of his way to have a manager charge up my phone for me! The food was delicious and the portions large! Such a great place :)"}
{"text":"Just wanted to give a shout out to our waiter Robert M. He gave us excellent service today. He is super friendly, energetic, and so nice. It was our friends birthday and he made sure he did a happy birthday dessert. That was really cool. Thank you! We will be back again."}
{"text":"Didn't have our table ready for a bachelor party that we set up two weeks prior and then forgot to bring out all of our food. Terrible service and food wasn't great. Made me sick. Wouldn't recommend for big groups. Maybe they can handle 2-4 people. Really just ruined the night for us."}
{"text":"We prefer to sit at the bar.  The bartenders are always friendly and the food is usually as expected and great.  We did have an issue with the food being too salty the last time we were there and the cook didn't get my burger cooked the way I ordered it.  Despite those  problems, we will go back again."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the Yard House Happy Hour at Red Rock! 

Incredibly reasonable for the portion size at $5-$8 a plate. Nachos come served on a large plate with the usual suspects. Plenty for 3-4 to share. 

Chicken strips for our kids are actually fresh, not the frozen version. The Happy Hour cheese pizza at $7 is also a perfect choice for the little guys. 

All the flavors are here across an awesome variety like ahi poke and California Rolls served stack style, and when you get a really great server like Shelbie, it's an easy 5 Star experience."}
{"text":"This may very well be my new favorite place to hang out in Vegas! Proof: I just went here two nights in a row. ;)

My friends and I went here after they finished their finals week. There is usually a line to get in, but it's only because they are checking IDs and giving you wristbands. The bouncers are pretty friendly, no elitism at this joint, no cover like at Blue Martini which is just upstairs.

Drinks: I seriously think they sell the cheapest drinks at Vegas. I was able to get vodka tonics for just $5 each...seriously? I can get 3 for the price of ONE as compared to one of the pricey clubs on the strip. I didn't really eat a meal here, but I did nibble on my friend's bbq chicken salad, which was delicious. The alcohol I drank induced french fry cravings, so my friend and I split an order of their fries. The fries weren't the big thick fries you get normally, but they were still really good with ketchup and ranch dressing. The wait staff are very attentive and friendly, also very accommodating. We were in a large group on Friday, and they are not allowed to give separate checks, but she had no problem giving me one.

My only gripe about this place is that the music is REALLY loud as it gets later into the night and you have to basically shout across the table to hold any kind of conversation. It's also nearly impossible to find parking around Town Square on Fri and Sat nights, but I guess that comes with the territory. Also, it's kind of hard to walk in and get a table at peak hours, so I would recommend making a reservation for a larger group.

If you are looking for a good place to chill with friends, AND cheap cheap cheap drinks, this is DEFINITELY the place to go."}
{"text":"The food was over priced for what you got.  Service was slow even know they weren't even crowded. The rudest waitress ever. I ordered the Korean street tacos and they were tiny with no meat....for 12.95. Would not go here again. The beer was great, once we finally received it.

{"text":"Love this place...service was great and food was even better...there is always a wait so come early and put your name down."}
{"text":"I was in for lunch yesterday and had a great experience! The food was really good and the service was even better! My server Melanie was very personable and helpful. Couldn't of asked for a better lunch!"}
{"text":"When this place first opened it was a bit rough going. I thought no it's to be expected as the staff learns to work together. One thing that has been consistent from the start - I've been here 5 times now and I think they have one of the best bartending staffs in all of greater CLE. They genuinely want to know your name, are attentive, and are even sensitive to happy hour pricing. The bartender today said \"I'm waiting 8 minutes and you'll get a happy hour deal.\" Very satisfied with the staff,  and the food has been consistently good too!"}
{"text":"Had the ahi and Caesar side. The Ahi was fresh and tasty, the salad good. The dessert mini was a morsel, way too small for the price! The service was slow, and typical of a understaffed restaurant. If you're not in a hurry, I would recommend."}
{"text":"Yardhouse offers a great fair.  It's bar food on a more elegant scale, and I for one am a big fan of it.  Yardhouse is famous for all the beer it has on tap, i beleive its something like 100 types or somewhere close to that.  This location is in Town Square right next to Rave Motion Pictures, so instead of paying $20 for popcorn and soda, stop by Yardhouse and get a real meal!  You can go there just about anytime and have some great appetizers, entree's or dessert!  It's usually busy at night any time on the weekend so get there early.  Especially if your trying to watch the game.  It's a great place to go and I will go again, especially now since they have one in Red Rock Casino."}
{"text":"As always had a great experience at yardhouse. Steak is always cooked just right and the selection of beer is awesome. I tried a Moscow Mule for the first time and was very pleased."}
{"text":"Upon walking in the door you are heated with a lot of respect. The feel is that of a higher end restaurant. Starting with the hostess and continued by the servers and busing staff. Very well spoken and courteous. The food was great. A bit pricey. And, would like to see some kind of a dress code enforced. The feeling of fine dinning quickly disappears when you see people in sweat pants and hoodies. If there were some kind of small dress code and a bit cheaper it would be an easy 5 stars."}
{"text":"I liked their fried calamari appetizer.
Fresh and crispy.

I had the jambalaya with rice (lunch special)
Its alright, its just sauce and sausage, shrimp, crawfish spread on top of steamed rice.

I would much prefer my rice to be seasoned and fried with the ingredients/sauce but I guess its just a personal preference.

The server was robotic, he hardly ever smiled.
Dr. Build-A-Bot forgot to program his robots to have facial expressions.

But the manager went around saying hi to everybody which was kinda cool"}
{"text":"The draft selection was one of the best in Las Vegas, yet the service was awful.  We spent the majority of the night chasing after the bartender."}
{"text":"We will definitely be back. We came here today to have lunch because we were doing some other shopping. We looked at their menu first online and were thrilled at the number of vegetarian selections made using Gardein. This is a brand of fake meat that mimics chicken especially well. We had the Gardein \"chicken\" strips and the blackened Gardein \"chicken\" sandwich and the food was quite flavorful. Our server was attentive and pleasant."}
{"text":"I will make this a sweet and simple review.....
1)awesome service
2)awesome food
3)awesome beer(s)
4)awesome atomosphere(play lots of classic rock)

A go to place for anyone!!!!"}
{"text":"After waiting over an hour we finally were sat at the table right next to the host stand.  During our entire dinner we had several people standing around our table waiting.  The music was extremely loud which prohibited talking to other people at my table.  

Although the restaurant was extremely busy, our server Lauren greeted us quickly and brought our drinks right away.  We ordered the Ahi appetizer which was brought out incredibly fast.  The appetizer was delicious.  For dinner I ordered the turkey burger and substituted vegetables instead of fries.  The burger was incredibly moist and flavorful.  This was the best turkey burger I have ever had.  I would definitely order it again.  

Lauren was one of the best servers I have had in Las Vegas.  I probably will not return to this restaurant during peak hours.  Tables should not be place so close to the waiting area during peak times because it ruins an otherwise awesome meal."}
{"text":"Any place! I mean any place that can have over a 100 could beers on tap at gets 5 big stars in my book! The food here is good, but who comes here focused on that! It the biggest selection in the world in choosing beers! Great place!!"}
{"text":"Amazing beer selection and the bartenders are very helpful (with 145 different beers, I was a bit overwhelmed). 

In terms of food, everything I have arrived was delicious. Specifically, the spicy tuna roll and the vampire tacos were out of this world. 

I have only eaten at the bar, but the service was incredibly fast. Would definitely recommend YH for drinks or for dinner, great on both fronts."}
{"text":"Very cool place to hang out. They have a pretty good Happy Hour and they have a great selection of beer.  The food is good, not spectacular and kinda pricey. However, this is the newest Las Vegas locals kick-it spot, so it's more about the experience than anything else. Be forewarned, it goes get packed on the weekends, so be ready to wait an hour to an hour and a half."}
{"text":"This was a good, solid, American restaurant. The beer selection is excellent.  The food is above-average if unspectacular. But you just need something to justify having another beer from the great beer list. 

The salads are an exception: the salads are extremely good and very large. 

We'd go back."}
{"text":"While on vacation in AZ on my last night there I found myself sitting around a fire burning marshmallows and chatting with friends. As we talk  the subject of Yard House henceforth referred to as Yardstick comes up. I have heard of this mythical place but as I live in Northern California and the ones in CA are in Southern California I had never been. A friend mentioned that Yardstick was in Scottsdale and I jump out of my seat and ask why I had wasted my whole vacation without going to this one.   My friend who also has a love of all things beer said that we should leave the fire and go. After extinguishing the fire (safety first kids). We were off.

I was impressed with the restaurant it was fairly new and had a big open feel to it. Their beer list also included 100+ choices.  Which brought a smile to my face. 

After removing all the beers I have had on the menu I was left with about 57 choices. I spent a few moments figuring out what I wanted. I went with a Dunkel. A good choice.

The rest of the night went well. I ordered a French Dip and it was pretty good. The rest of my beers were good too. Although a bit on the pricey side. 

One of my biggest problems was our waitress kept forgetting to place our orders for beer and since the place wasn't packed we had to wait longer for beers. If we weren't waiting for beers we were waiting to place orders for beers. After being told she had forgot to bring a round that was ordered she did give us two free beers which was nice.

I'd go back to Yardstick again simply because I like beer a lot and do like their selection."}
{"text":"Have dined here for lunch twice. Each time the service has been superb and the food first rate. I especially love the personal pepperoni pizza, which sounds ordinary, but is flavorful and super tasty. The ambiance is wonderful and the noise level isn't bad for a restaurant in this location. We didn't have to shout at each other to be heard. Fantastic and we will return!"}
{"text":"I typically don't review chain restaurants that often however I think this place deserves it. I had not been to yardhouse in years and it was nice to see the changes in food. This place is in the Linq shopping area, on a Sunday night it had a pretty good crowd, we ate nachos and chicken wings and both were delicious. Service was nice and since we had a good meal here the first time we actually came back a second night, we had the wings again and this time tried their cheeseburger...it was ok seemed like it was missing something, they do serve you a side of aioli for the burger however even with this it lacked some flavor, it wasn't bad but it wasn't anything to write home about."}
{"text":"Another good meal and good service. Every time I come here I am impressed with the execution. Yard House is a chain that does things right."}
{"text":"I came here for the KC Twins. It's the first night of them running karaoke here on Tuesday nights, and I will be here every night that they are here. Best karaoke hosts of all time!!! Half price drinks for guys, and free drinks for the Ladies drink free until midnight."}
{"text":"My hubby and I love Yard House especially for their late night happy hour. It's super-chill and a fun place to hang out for a couple hours. Their menu is massive and have yet to have something that we don't like. Especially love the ahi tuna app as well as the pizzas (margherita and pineapple/ham). Last time we were in my husband could not remember which Amber beer he had the last time we were there. The server made it his mission to find out which one it was making several trips to the taps and listing off names and styles until he found which one it was which was impressive. The servers and bartenders have genuine personalities, but are not overbearing. I also like the semi-open kitchen where you can see back of house staff working. Yard House is one of my favorite go-to places to grab a beer/wine and a tasty little snack."}
{"text":"Over priced and small portions, but the food is good."}
{"text":"Our server, Jonathan, was probably the best waiter I've ever had at a restaurant! I got the blackened swordfish tacos, which were very good but there were only two small tacos and I left still hungry. The serving of beans that came with them was very small, too, maybe three bites. The rice was the deal breaker for me though. It was good, but Asian flavored and didn't seem to go with tacos very well. I look forward to returning and trying something else. 
My husband got the new pork burger, and it was amazing!"}
{"text":"Had a great time.  Enjoyed the tomato basil soup and grill cheese and honey blond ale.  A big plus was the great service.  Definitely  recommend"}
{"text":"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!

Our server Aaron was terrific!  He informed us of their Monday night football happy hour, which was the best happy hour menu I've EVER seen! We got 3 HUGE appetizers and a pizza for $30!! 

The service was over the top, my pineapple mojito was so good I got two! The place was clean and inviting! 

This is my new monday night football spot, we will be bringing our friends next week! 

Worth your time and money!"}
{"text":"I have dined here many times and the service is always pretty good!  I came in with my family on Father's Day, and let me tell you my family is pretty difficult to deal with but our server Nikki was great! She was welcoming and took great care of us even when we messed up our own order!  Also the food and beer is always great too!"}
{"text":"Always love Yard House, it never disappoints! Watching games at the bar is great and their vegetarian buffalo chicken wings always hit the spot! We ordered nachos once and the bartender informed us one of the sauces had chicken stock in it. I love this kind of service at a restaurant and appreciate when staff really know their stuff! Can't wait to have some Gardein wings this Sunday with a pint and the game!"}
{"text":"My friends and I regret eating here last weekend (per a Red Rock employee recommendation.) Someone in our party sent her burger back not once, but twice, because it was RAW in the middle (no exaggeration...it was cool, gummy, blood red-- not medium, as ordered.) Our server, Barry, was unsympathetic, unacommodating, and wholly unprofessional. His careless, lackadaisical attitude was off-putting and detracted from our experience at Yard House. Who cares how many beers are on tap if your server is a douchey loser, angry at the world? He literally said to my table of 5: \"You all are nothing but numbers to me. That's how I roll.\" A manager granted us a free dessert for our troubles and extraordinarily long wait time for food that was uncooked. Baffling. The Yard House is dead to us."}
{"text":"Poor service was never asked if i would like a beverage.  When i asked waiter Travis M. he rolled his eyes and ran from my table. The oddest experience i have had at this location. I will simply not return problem solved!"}
{"text":"I like the yard house but this location some how it never satisfy me like some of the others. Good poky nachos and great selections of beers. A little expensive but sometimes worth. There are better locations then this one. My favorite is the scottsdale  one."}
{"text":"I love this place. This is the only place where I will order a salad as my main course. I order the BBQ Chicken Salad and it is loaded! It will fill you up and it taste great. There is also an outstanding selection of beer to enjoy."}
{"text":"As Americans, we love choices. It is not unusual, therefore, that an American bistro and drinking hole offers a choice of beer and wine. But this place taps into just about more than any other place out there --- around 200 beers in all. Yet, is it all really enough? The answer, of course, is yes and no.

I for one do not need 200 beers. I need one: Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. That they have Abita Purple Haze or Portland Oregon Honey or even the Americana trophy Pabst Blue Ribbon makes no difference to me, except, that is to say, that the Yardhouse cares that people drink beer not just wine. In any event, if you're looking for new styles or brands of beer on any given night, this is going to be a place for you to go (at least in eight mostly Western states).

I've breached the threshold of the Scottsdale Fashion Square version twice. Both times were pleasant enough. The staff seemed young, good-looking and attentive. The prices seemed reasonable. The decor and atmosphere in the cavernous space are corporate (surprise, surprise --- it's a chain). There are too many televisions for my liking. But I'm not a sports bar kind of guy. While lots of square footage means plenty of tables (i.e. no or limited waiting for a seat), hobbling through this massive place to the restrooms from the patio could be dangerous and embarrassing for some with, ah, control issues.

The Yardhouse puts a lot of emphasis on eating. I suppose they don't want people getting too wound up on all those suds. With the exception of a handful of French fries, I have gone for the beer rather than the food. That said, the food looks good, the kitchen is open, busy and appears to be about as squeaky clean as the Yardhouse's image.

Part of the fun comes with sitting on the patio. It's not that the atmosphere out there is all that great. Essentially you're sitting in a parking garage. But the people watching is spectacular. All the young Scottsdalians love valet parking, prancing around half naked and giving the impression that they actually have more than the minimum in their free checking accounts. Ah, if it were only L.A. Perhaps it wouldn't be so pathetic ... or funny.

Cheers."}
{"text":"Best snake bites anywhere! The menu has a jive variety of food as well as various beers to choose from."}
{"text":"I'll make this short, since the other reviews all seem pretty much on the right track. As everyone else has stated, they have a very large beer selection-- over 200 on tap. The keg room is really interesting, but S.P. nailed it on the head-- nothing here is exactly memorable. The food is good, the beer is cool, the atmosphere is so-so. I can't say anything bad about this place, really, but I can't say anything great either. Maybe if I went back at happy hour (Mon-Fri 3-6pm or Thurs 10-close) and got cheap beer and half-priced appetizers I would feel different as they were, in my book, pretty overpriced."}
{"text":"I have frequented this place when my wife worked in Town Square and I received nothing short of fantastic service every time.  The staff is friendly and even when theyre slammed with people the service is top notch.  I recommend this place for anyone who wants a good beer and food."}
{"text":"On a Friday after work, I had a snake bite (ok 4) and left my credit card at the Yard House. Though I assumed it was in a pocket somewhere, the card was lost. On Tuesday, I got a call from Visa informing me that the Yard House called in my card as lost and was holding it for me!!!!!!

Amazed and relieved I returned, collected my card and - of course - reveled in the great food, terrific atmosphere and excellent service. Thank you,Yard House! You have another loyal customer."}
{"text":"This is a great place to enjoy a cold brew on the patio, and if you're really thirsty you can drink it by the yard. The noise level is moderate enough that you can easliy catch up with friends and hear what they're saying and you can laugh loud enough that the folks around you won't care. TV monitors are plentiful so you can always catch a glimpse of the game. 

Yard House offers good food at a good price, with a respectible beer menu.  Bring your friends and enjoy."}
{"text":"Friendly staff , some items are better than others.  Did not like the salad, the veggie pasta was bland. The Korean short ribs were thin strips of tough meat. 
Burgers, chicken wings, French fries, chicken fingers good."}
{"text":"The manager was kind enough to contact me and offer me a chance to try the fries again--on the house. The first time back, the sweet potato fries were on point. I went back a few more times and they were hit and miss, as were their truffle fries. My friend mentioned that it was possible the fries came out perfectly, but the busy waiters weren't able to deliver them quickly enough. Regardless, I would go back because it's a fun atmosphere, even when the food is not spectacular.

Overall, a great atmosphere despite the hit or miss food."}
{"text":"A group of 10 of us just walked in joking around and a little loud, but having a good time as a group of friends just getting together and having out. We got a table after a few minutes and instantly the manger Leo came over and informed us that they would serve us all the food we wanted, but we were limited to one drink a piece. We were cut off before even walking in the door because we were a group having fun together. I had 1 martini 2 hours prior and a ton of water, but I was cut off! Unbelievable! I will NEVER be back here. I can get drinks anywhere and the food is mediocre at best. I would rather go to the corner bar with better food. If you are in Town Square and looking for a good place with good food go to McFadden's instead. F this place"}
{"text":"Had a good decent Cobb Salad, fish tacos won't be a repeat, tasteless and presentation of the whole dish unappetizing. 
However, the Yardhouse Restaurants I've eaten at in Southern California were great!"}
{"text":"This is our 2nd time going to this location (others were in Glendale AZ) & it was good both times, not great just good also a little pricey but we had a $10 gift card so it evened out. We would go again if we are on that side  of Vegas"}
{"text":"I have always loved Yard House.  The food and the drinks have never disappointed me.  The service is usually a toss up...but this particular time it was unmatched!!  My husband and I just left the Town Square location, and our server's name was Seth.  Let me just say, incredible experience!!  He showed up to our table within seconds.  He had a huge smile on his face, and it actually seemed genuine.  There were some new menu items that had been added since our last visit, Seth knew about all of the new items.  He answered all of our questions without skipping a beat.  Best part about it...he didn't seem annoyed at all.  He was very pleasant and informative.  

Our food arrived very quickly and was just as delicious as always.  Seth came back to check on us a few times, but we had nothing but great things to say.  He never let our drinks get less than half full, and he anticipated our needs like a true professional!!

Everyone knows that Yard House has great food and a great happy hour.  I decided to write this five star review because I'm sure that not everyone knows how fantastic Seth's service is!!  My husband and I were so happy that we were seated in his section, especially when we saw most of the other servers.  They just looked so miserable...(mostly) smiling while they were at their tables...and then frowning as they turned away.  I don't think they know that their attitudes come across and can sometimes ruin a dining experience.  Seth was incredible.  I really wanted to let a manager know how much I appreciated him, and I would have...if I saw one at any time during our meal.  I really wish I had seen a manager walk by or come check on any tables.  They really should know what a great employee they have working for them!"}
{"text":"Love this place so much! We go here often :) food and drinks are great! I got the lobster, crab and shrimp garlic pasta. And hubby got the steak and shrimp. For Appetizers we got the calamari and the spinach dip. As well as a side of Mac and cheese. Everything was perfect, they even got me a chocolate mini cake topped with ice cream since I was my birthday :) love yard house!"}
{"text":"This place has an excellent happy hour!  My boyfriend and I have been here a few different times but not on the night happy hour and let me say it was well worth coming.  Late night snacks are my favorite and the yard house hit the spot for that!"}
{"text":"This place is awsome!  Eat at the one in Denver, so dropped in to the one in Vegas.  Love the jumbalia,  the calafornia roll, and deviled eggs (like moms).  Food is well presented, reasonably-priced,  and awesome flavors.  What more could you ask for!"}
{"text":"Wow, so it goes without saying they have a great beer selection.  The open kitchen is always welcomed as I like seeing the cleanliness.  I have been here weekly for years now, and they added a new item Street Tacos.    No doubt a response to the ever popular food truck cooking shows.  However I have to say they are the best tacos I have ever eaten, ever!  There is a traditional Carnitas which writes the book on good fresh street food, and the Korean with the red pepper threads and feta cheese(?) yes feta, and teh Chicken Tinga which is something I could live on, a shredded chicken in a creamy Sriracha sauce with carots and feta cheese on top of a soft 4\" tortilla.  It isn't for the faint of heart as the sauce made my wife cry but for the adventurous or the heat seeker it is amazing!  
Everything here is good except the Poke Stack mushy flavorless group appetizer.  Burgers are awesome, crab cake sandwich best in town, fish and chips great batter large portion, and always crisp crust and juicy meat.
Kids meals are generous enough to share, and real food not prepackaged excuses for a lower cost, the Mac n Cheese is real and fit for adults as well."}
{"text":"Yard House + Me = Love Affair!  

For parents of little ones, Yard House is a Go-To place with kids because it's okay to be a little loud inside - the entire restaurant is LOUD!  A good loud - because it's hopping with business!  

My visit last night gets 4 stars instead of 5 because the service was considerably slow.  The restaurant was full, like always, but the service seemed much slower than ever.  That being said, this place never dissapoints me.  

Visited Yard House last night (Friday night around 6:00pm) for drinks and dinner with friends.  Wonderful time with great food and great beer!

I tried a new dish last night and it was YUMMY!  The Chicken Tinga tacos rock!!  But be ready - they are SPICY!  When a beer restaurant can make some of the best tacos in town, you know you are in a special place!   The mexican rice and beans are excellent as well!  It was one of my favorite meals I've had at Yard House - and I've probably had about 25.  I paired my meal with their House Belgium Trippel Ale - which was very good!  

The children's menu is very good as well.  We ordered the Mac-N-Cheese for the kiddo, with a side of fruit, and it comes with a drink and an ice-cream dessert for $6.95.  A little on the pricey side of Kids Menus, but the food is top quality kids food!  It's not Kraft macaroni and cheese out of a box - it's homemade with the same cheeses they make the entree meals from."}
{"text":"Remember what Benjamin Franklin said? He's quoted as saying \"Beer is proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy.\" 

Ol' Ben would have DUG the Yard House. 

I was staying Red Rock, didn't want to leave the cool atmosphere and met some friends who were locals. The Yard House didn't disappoint. I started salivating at the hundred plus kegs at the entrance. I knew right then and there, I was home. 

Dig on the sizes of the beers. You can get an eight ounce sampler, a regular pint. or this massive glass. I stuck with the eight ounce and pints and traveled around the world with beer. Japan. Belgium. Australia. The US. Come on, I had to have me some PBR. I'm a Midwestern boy. 

Service was top notch. Scott was our waiter's name. You know how to tell a good server? They don't talk down to kids. They treat them like customers. And that's what he did. Our kids (who behave in restaurants, yeah, I'm a proud Dad, I gotta give 'em some props) were treated well by Scott. 

The winner at the table was Jambalaya Pasta. I had entree envy over it. It was perfect. My salad was fresh (I had to offset the beer calories somehow!) and while small, it was good. Tzvi got fish and chips. He always does. He digs it. And he said this was one of the best he's had. 

This place is perfect if you're at Red Rock, wiped out from swimming, don't want to leave the resort, have kids and want a nice, cold beer. 

And it was like, 112 degrees that day. Perfect beer drinking weather! 

Next time I'm in LV, I'll probably be back."}
{"text":"You absolutely can't beat the beer selection here the service indoors is much better than the patio service. the food is pretty good consistent.  It's always pretty crowded."}
{"text":"Had a late lunch with the family and not a great first experience at this location. Had to wait over 45 mins for our food. My sliders were cold, my son's asada tacos had too much fat, and my daughter's pizza was undercooked! The worst part was as we were walking out the restaurant the female manager comes to apologize about the long wait and offered to adjust our bill, but my husband already paid. She should've came by our table while we waited for our food! Too late....we're not coming back"}
{"text":"I have amina lets see....ok so we got rob not bad he did a good job it started off bad no silverwares on the table when the food came out...but rob stepped in an handle it...loved my food can't say the same for my friends oh well"}
{"text":"If you want a good beer selection you found it.  I like that they have the Moscow Mule made with house made ginger beer and 3 other Mule drinks I have to try next time.  

Got the Mac 'n Cheese,  the jerk chicken penne and a half roast beef sandwich with a salad.  Everything tasted great.  The pasta good and had just enough spice to keep it interesting but not crazy.  The Mac was superb.  The sandwich and salad all were fresh and very good as well."}
{"text":"Great!  Bloody Mary's are awesome and they have an outstanding beer selection. I had the lamb burger and my wife had the tuna nachos. What a great place off the strip and very good prices."}
{"text":"my waitress Shelly was extremely rude, brought me the wrong drink twice, and gave attitude after asked for something. she also rolled her eyes at us multiple times. extremely unprofessional, & should not ever treat a customer that way"}
{"text":"Love the Vegetarian options!! Gardein (Veggie Meat) section of menu is wonderful! I can always count on great service with a smile and quality food here. It's always super busy when I go here, but it's totally worth any waiting!"}
{"text":"We pay a visit to the Yard House every time we are in Las Vegas.  They have a huge beer selection and serve up some tasty food as well.  

My favorite dish here is the Spicy Tuna Roll.  Be aware going in that this is not sushi as the name might suggest.  It is very rare ahi on a bed of edamame and topped with avocado.  It is one of my favorite dishes to eat in Vegas.   Though it doesn't really live up to it's \"spicy\" name, it is an absolute must have!"}
{"text":"So, second time here, first problem.  Ordered the menu \"steak sandwich\" by a colloquial name \"cheese steak\" and was brought a piece of cheese cake for my lunch... While comical, common sense has to play a part and the waitress should be asking for confirmation I'd that is all she thought I ordered with my beer lol.  Overall, I got comped my lunch by the manager, and enjoyed a nice steak sandwich, which in fact was, a steak on a sandwich.  Delicious.  And I'll definitely come again, but make sure my order is understood clearly."}
{"text":"Sliders aren't burgers patties cut in quarters. Gluten free friendly isn't just your food with key ingredients removed - burger without buns? No, thanks! This is just a rock bar with OK food. No more, no less. The service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Waited over 20 minutes for someone to even acknowledge that we were sitting at the table, much less ask if we would like something to drink. Tried several times to wave down a waiter but they ignored us. Finally had to get up and go find a manager.
He half heartedly apologized and finally sent over a waiter, who happened to be one of the same people we had tried to get the attention of. No offer of anything, drinks, dessert, etc for our aggravation, which most restaurants who care about repeat business would do. They weren't even that busy, which makes the situation more puzzling."}
{"text":"We went at a busy time, but were seated almost immediately. Staff were very attentive.  My husband had the pork loin, which was some of the best I've ever tasted. I had thx quinoa salad. It was huge, and filling. I was disappointed that vegetables were grilled, or baked, to be more flavorful, but it was good"}
{"text":"I came here with my friends and the atmosphere is nice but the service was kinda slow and the food was just ok. I wasn't very impressed with it to be honest. I probably won't come again."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Excellent choice of menu items.Must try lettuce tofu wrap and seafood jambalaya with linguini pasta"}
{"text":"Not so good food poor selection of liquor who needs 145 beers anyway that's all folks I'm out!!"}
{"text":"On beer alone they get 4 stars - 4.5 even! Wonderful selection with half yards available. Service was good. Didn't have to wait too long for food. Got a pizza and it was solid. It is odd being inside the mall but oh well."}
{"text":"Fabulous food and wonderful friendly service.  The dark sauce for the lettuce wrap gave it just the right spice & flavor.  The onion ring tower seemed bottomless.  The spicy tuna was a bit different..not at all what we expected to see."}
{"text":"Great HH specials.  Kool vibe and good service, off the strip.  Not as many tourists more regulars and is a great option for something more reasonably priced.

Great tv's and plenty of beer options and delicious appetizers.

Def worth checking out, esp during HH."}
{"text":"This restaurant has some of the best dishes you will ever have. Even the kids menu is good. If your ready to splurge come to yard house. When you enter you walk through a long hallway. In the hallway,if you look to the left, you'll see where there hand made beer is made. If you look to the right you'll see chefs working on the meal. They always seem to be having a good time. The hostess are super kind and greet you nicely when you walk in. You sit down in a black booth and you feel right at home to be honest. Everyone is so kind there. 

To be honest though we went there about a week ago and everyone was so so so rude. My family loves yard house and it bothers us that they were so rude to us. When we walked in we waited about 5-7 minutes for a hostess. When she came to greet she looked at us as if we couldn't afford a dime. When we sat down the waitress had to ask another waitress to serve us. What the heck. I was so disappointed.

All In all I love this restaurant but I have learned a lot of new things since this incident. Never go back to yard house unless they change."}
{"text":"Good menu. Some really unique items. Good service; even during the World Cup final. Great beer selection of west coast beers and international stuff as well. Will certainly be back next time I am in Vegas. If you like good food, craft beer, and are in the Flamingo/Quad/Caesars are of the strip you need to stop here.  Down the Linq near the High Roller. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food and awesome ambience. Not sure why it does not have higher ratings. I have a great time whenever I go there."}
{"text":"Always enjoy Yardhouse's food, beer selection, and service. Whether its in Vegas or South Florida, this chain always delivers a good, satisfying meal. The wings are spot on, cheese dip tasty, entrees large and beers cold. The food probably tastes so good because it is really unhealthy for you though, definitely lots of salt or sauces on all the dishes I've ever had. Don't come here expecting culinary nirvana, its just a really good sports bar.

Make sure you hit Happy Hour during the day, M-F 3PM - 6PM and Sunday - Wednesday 10PM - close. You can get appetizers and beers much cheaper, then order your entree right at 6:01. Work the system people!!! It's a recession."}
{"text":"Very open, very cool & chill atmosphere. 
service is a little slow but it's worth the wait. (That's why I gave it 4 stars) 
Burgers are fantastic my favorite thing to get. 

Alcohol a little expensive but once in a while it's good."}
{"text":"The menu has a great variety of food.  Nice restaurant compared to other sports bars that I've been to.  I make sure to come to Yard House whenever I'm in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Yard house gets 1 star For having a restroom in the restaurant vs gong into the casino. For how expensive this place is my party of 10 expected so much more. 2 hours to order and get food? By the time the messed up entrees came, who wanted to wait for them to get it right? So disappointed on a random Thursday at 8pm. Won't be wasting my time nor money here. Others be prepared for a long drawn out meal...even when everyone in our party was immediately ready to order."}
{"text":"My first time here and I was not disappointed! I tried the vegan burger with onion rings and it was quite good. The burger was packed full (overstuffed) with goodness, possibly if they had less ingredients it would be just as good I'm sure. The onion rings blew me away, probably the best I've ever had, definitely try those. For dessert I had the apple and peach cobbler and it was scrumptious! It was like a smaller version of the Blue Martini's apple tart a la mode. I will definitely visit Yard house again! Our waiter was quite courteous as well, the customer service was certainly an A+. I recommend trying out the apple and peach cobbler here first then on another day getting the apple tart a la mode at BM. Prepare yourself, the apple tart a la mode is the best dessert that exists ever! Oh and it is pretty big!"}
{"text":"Service was great, price was reasonable and the food was delicious. Like the environment and love the sweet potato fries even without sauce. Rib eye was yummy. Lobster garlic noodle was tasty. Turkey pot pie was huge!!! It's bigger than your face. However, our sliders were a little bit dry so I gave 4 starts....

One more thing we like yard house is they have some unique dishes like Kung pao calamari and duck wings. We will definitely try them next time"}
{"text":"Horrible service! My friends brought me on my birthday 7/29. Our server can't tell you her name cause she didn't even introduce herself was the worst server I've ever had. We didn't feel welcomed she'd  roll her eyes every time we asked her something. You can tell she just wanted to get out of there. You know most servers ask \"how's your night going?\", \"what brings you in tonight?\" Or s a simple welcome my name is..... She asked for our drink orders right when I looked up from looking at the menu she was gone I guess we took to long for her. When we got our food she didn't being bring us cutlery, not ketchup, napkins or asked if we needed anything for our meals. I guess I'm suppose to eat my rice and beans with my hands. We asked three different people that walked by our table if they can get it for us of course they said yes but never came back. She finally showed up and brought us some 5-10 minutes later. I understand it's busy but if your working for tips you'd think you'd put some effort into giving A+ that would've been better instead of getting treated like shit. We wanted to go catch the movie but again she was no where to be found finally brought the bill and left right away so we went to the front cause we wanted to leave already the hostess said you have to give it to the server so we saw a guy with a white shirt not sure if he was the manager he took it said the server will take care of it. When she gave it to us guess what she disappeared again so we asked if the hostess can take the check book she said you have to give it to your server I asked can't you take it it's empty mind you she was leaning on the counter talking to the other 2 host I guess if she would've grabbed it the counter would've fell because she wasn't leaning on it. If you want to get treated like shit definitely come here. If you want amazing service go elsewhere cause you won't get that here. I wish I can give them a 0 They don't even deserve a 1."}
{"text":"Great meal and good environment. One of my favorite places at WestGate. Great knowledgable staff."}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of this restaurant in many different cities and this one in Vegas did not disappoint! The food was delicious, the waitstaff attentive and the prices totally worth it!"}
{"text":"We are here from out of town and came here for the first time. Meghan was our server and she's just THE BEST! She was very helpful and knew the menu very well and was able to make recommendations. We had the turkey burgers which was very very good. I don't know if we will be back in AZ to come back to this restaurant but if we did, we would come here again. Thanks Meghan for making our visit so great."}
{"text":"Most delicious place ever!!! Best happy hour prices around! It's a amazing place to eat really good service! I had the Thai chicken pizza, buffalo chicken wings, chicken tenders, a different pizza and the sushi rolls. I have been there a couple times for the happy hour special . Really big serving for the price it's super worth it.. The only bad thing I can say is. It's really cold inside the restaurant which masks the food cold fast.. Still excellent will give 5 stars and probably the only place I could give 5 stars to."}
{"text":"Okay experience, food was mostly decent, service was meh.  

Three of us went.  I ordered a caesar salad with my steak, and when it was delivered, the runner asked, \"would you like some pepper on your salad?\" to which I replied, \"Heck yeah!\"  He never came back.  I started eating anyways, and when our waiter finally came by, I asked for pepper... To which he brought me salt and pepper shakers.  Hate to be a snob, but I know YardHouse, and I know they have fresh cracked pepper!  He was just too lazy to go get it.  Anyways.  I had a steak that was cooked perfectly to my taste (and as I had requested).  The side was some broccolini stuff that was not seasoned at all, and at best steamed for just a quick few seconds.  I left that behind on the plate, but the steak was the hero here.

One of the others ordered the same steak but with the shrimp add-on.  When I looked over, I asked him if he was going to eat that...  Because there's no way I would have.  The shrimp was almost completely raw on one side still!  Once our waiter finally made his 10-minute interval rounds again, my friend told him of the issue and said, \"please just take it off the bill, I don't want to wait.\"  Instead, the waiter grabbed a side plate, had him put the shrimp on it to \"go show my manager.\"  So then the manager comes by and says \"Sorry about that, we're making a fresh one for you right now that is properly cooked.\"  That eventually showed up as we were all more or less finished eating.  

Super slow and inattentive service, the food (aside from raw shrimp) was decent...  Unfortunately, not up to par with all of the other YardHouse locations I've been to in AZ.  But that steak...  Mmmmm good."}
{"text":"Great Ambiance on the patio, Super Menu Selections: Vegan, Vegetarian and Low Calorie...Love That They offer Two Sizes of most meals! The service, value, flavor and options were excellent! Seems to me they changed their menu....We used to go to the Yard House A Long Time Ago and the menu seemed way better now, with way more healthy options and not as pricey as it used to be. THHIS IS A GREAT SPOT! EXCELLENT FOOD!"}
{"text":"It was good to come here for a quick drink and app during happy hour. 

We ordered the blue crab cakes and the chicken lettuce wraps. Both were good and actually pretty large. I would defiantly order both again"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service! I had planned a big dinner with all of my friends and already knew that Yardhouse does not take reservations. I called them a week in advance to tell them about the situation and called back the day before to make sure it will be all taken care of. Their manager Tex was so helpful and accommodated my large party for me. He reassured to me over the phone that they will try their best to make everything work out. Once I got there, I met Tex and found out that the tables were all set and ready to go :) The waiters were very good and checked back with us constantly. They refilled our drinks regularly, checked if our food was good, and made sure my guests and i were doing well. My friend's salad accidentally had an ingredient she requested not to have, but they took care of that, apologized, and ended her experience with a happy note. Again, thank you so much to Tex and the staff for making it memorable for me and making my guests feel happy :)"}
{"text":"Be careful if you are paying with your credit card at this restaurant. Last night the waiter gave me someone else's card. Discovered it this morning and called my bank to find several fraud charges put on my card. My bank in Summerlin said another report was made today. Feel could be fraud ring by their waiters! Service was also bad. Would never go there again."}
{"text":"So I this used to be my favorite place to get a decent priced filet mignon. Sad ending to eating here . 2 of us got food poisoning. We have ate there 10 plus times and this only happened once but I'm done with it ."}
{"text":"Great place to eat.  Tons of draft beer to choose from.  I had the Parmesan Encrusted Halibut.  It was excellent.  Lot's of indoor and outdoor seating with a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Lighting is too dim to read menus in the evening.  Wait staff said the lighting is automatic and adjusts throughout the day.  It is short sighted of management to make it difficult for patrons to read menus."}
{"text":"Very nice place.  Big menu and experienced wait staff.  Food was great"}
{"text":"This is,my whole families favorite restaurant. My parents drive from gilbert to come and eat here. Which for older people is a long drive. :)  We love to order the guacamole and chips. Our favorite dish is the chicken enchilada stack. OMG. it is huge but packs a ton of flavor. It has red sauce and green sauce. You will not be hungry after eating it. Everything we have tried here has,been delicious and is one of the few places my husband can go and they get his order right in regards to his food allergies. It you want some great food. Make sure you come here. Nice big bar also"}
{"text":"This place has great tasting food which came out pretty quickly.  They also have an enormous selection of beer on tap and great service."}
{"text":"Great happy hours. Half off menus and $3 drinks. Much merriment can be had for very reasonable money for a classy joint! High recommendation."}
{"text":"Wow my waitress Stormie was absolutely Amazing!!! She was attentive, knowledgeable, and help me decide what to order. I love the yardhouse now it's my  favorite restaurant to eat at. Great service and great food!!!!"}
{"text":"We went to the Yard house before the Coyotes game. We always like to sit at the bar. Our server Kaitlyn was very pleasant. We ordered the lobster and crab dip. It was good, but a few too many shells in it. My husband ordered a bacon cheeseburger and subbed a side of mashed potatoes. When it came out the potatoes were the size of a small ice scream scoop. It was laughable.  He ordered a side of steamed vegetables, and he got Asian vegetables. Kind of weird with a burger. My French onion soup was lukewarm at best. The turkey in my Cobb salad was tough. I pushed it aside. The rest of the salad was good. What saved the dinner was the hot brownie dessert with vanilla ice cream. Yummmmm."}
{"text":"One of the first places I tried upon moving to LV. Got there early to avoid the crowd (around 5:30 on a Monday). We were seated immediately and ordered our drinks. First I tried the House Tripel which was good, if not a tad malty for my taste. Then I had the North Coast Pranqster, one of my absolute favorite beers - golden and fruity. It was a decent price ($4) for a pint since it was HH. Drinks and food arrived fast. I went with the Baja Fish Street Tacos and they were incredible! Not very big portions, but combined with the beer enough to fill me up. I will definitely be back for more. Can't wait to try this again with friends. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"For a chain, this was a great place for a late night dinner.  The server was very attentive and friendly. The beer selection is as great as you would expect for the YardHouse chain. The interior decor is more polished than the rest of the chain that I have been to.  All in all, a reliable dinner at a good price."}
{"text":"I don't think I would have ever tried this place if someone hadn't given us a gift card, but I am so glad I did!  

Looking in from the outside, it's not my kind of place.  I don't drink, so a big, noisy and crowded bar and a restaurant known for their beer selection didn't really appeal to me. But like I said.... we had gift card, so hubby and I gave it a shot.

We've been TWICE now, and I have been extremely impressed both times.  

The first time we sat on the patio, which was really nice and comfortable.  It was a little chilly that day, so I was worried it would be too cold, but the hostess was really nice and let us go out and see how it felt before committing to an outside seat.  It turned out to be just fine because they have little space heaters out there which worked perfectly.

On a Yelp recommendation, we ordered the truffle fries as an appetizer (or a \"snack,\" I think they called it).  They were delicious, but we found out later that if your entree comes with fries, you can upgrade them to truffle fries (as well as garlic fries, sweet potato fries or onion rings) for just a dollar more, and you get a TON of fries -- way more than you get for the $4 \"snack\" portion -- so if you're interested in trying them, I would go that route instead.

Anyway, the hubs went for his favorite thing on earth - Mac n Cheese - and he was not disappointed.  I tried a bite of it and I had to agree it was pretty darned tasty.  I went for the grilled cheese with tomato basil soup and I have to say... that was the most delicious grilled cheese I have ever had in my life.  That's some big words, cuz I've had some pretty good grilled cheeses in my time!  

About halfway into it, though, I started to feel my arteries clogging and as I looked at the small puddle of oil collecting on my plate, I was feeling really guilty about how much i was enjoying it.  I think they must have slathered each slice of bread with a full stick of butter and then used about 2 pounds of thick-cut, full-fat cheese.  No WONDER it tasted so good! I was pretty happy that their dessert menu is crappy because I wasn't even the least bit tempted to order some more fattening food.

On our visit #2, we took an inside seat, which was still nice, but very loud.  If you're on a date, I would suggest taking the patio seating, which seemed a bit more quiet.  But be warned... even THAT is loud.  This isn't a quiet restaurant by any means.

This time we started out with the lobster/crab/artichoke dip.  Another good choice.  The husband got some kind of monster-sized burger with garlic fries (here's where we found out about the \"upgrade\") and I got the crab cake sandwich with onion rings.  Nothing bad to say about any of that!!

I feel like the price is good for the quality of food and the level of service you receive here.  We ordered an appetizer and two entrees on each visit, and both times the bill came out to about $40-$45 with tip.  Well worth it for our fabulous meals and some leftovers to eat the next day.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"So I walk in at 1 AM and the hostess asks how many people and I tell her 2. Then she soon realized that it became 1:01 AM and proceeded to tell me that they stop serving at 1 AM but failed to tell me that we can still go get drinks, BASICALLY kicking us out ONE minute after 1 AM? This is a joke right. How are you going to pick up 2 menus and right when you're about to walk around to go seat us you decide that it's too late? There's 3 hostesses, which is unnecessary, what a waste of pay roll for horrible customer service. I refuse to come back to this location. I give 2 stars because I actually liked the food here but management needs to learn how to properly train their workers because the way the hostess spoke to me tonight was straight up disgustingly rude."}
{"text":"Even though we hit the place during happy hour they could seat 5 of us right away and the staff does a great job of reviewing the menu for new guests (3 of our 5).  We had everyyhing from salad to pizza show up at the table.  The onion soup is marvelous, the pizza thin and crispy, one person made a meal out of a couple of the apps and was stuffed.  Bring a group and do some sharing."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place and come here often! We love the food and typically love the service. We had a horrible service experience this time around, however, we are still giving Yard House 5 stars based on their management. AMINA (not sure on the spelling) handled our complain amazingly. It takes a lot for my husband and I to complain, and hey.. we still tipped 15% on bad service...and she handled everything great! We will definitely be coming back because of her! Thanks again!"}
{"text":"The ice tea was great service was just write the chicken tortilla soup  was good could have been a little hotter but it is a hundred and 5 degrees outside the Margareta pizza was good also the server name Gwen I would definitely keep her and probably move her to nights where you need better help"}
{"text":"Food was really good and even the half portions were large enough to satisfy 2 hungry full-grown American men. I enjoy having my awesome nephew visiting me, and we ate well. The lobster, crab & artichoke dip was superb (maybe a little more dip). The cheese & bread fuzed together in my french onion soup, so this was the ONLY soup I ever needed a knife for."}
{"text":"Wow this place is awesome. They have 125 beers on tap (I recommend the Alaskan Amber) and great food. I've had the fried gnocchi which is served in tomato sauce with this very delicious spicy sweet sausage. Their Nashville hot chicken is also a big hit. It's a breaded, deep-fried chicken breast served with spicy heated honey along with a short stack of mini-pancakes made from sweet potatoes.  Can't wait to get back there!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I spent a few days in Vegas, during that time we tried to hit the food spots that were highest rated or recommended, unfortunately we were disappointed with most of the places we ate at (including the Eiffel Tower which was our worst experience). Our last day we came here for lunch, the menu selection was HUGE, definitely something for everyone. Food was delicious and service was good, prices were a little high for lunch/bar type food but portions were big so if you can wrap and take with you then this would be a good spot, we were heading to the airport so unfortunately we had to waste a lot."}
{"text":"Yardhouse typically has great food and service. Unfortunately, service was seriously lacking today. Tim, our waiter, provided some of the worst service I have ever experienced. We waited a long time before we ordered both our drinks and our meal. There was two of us for lunch and we each ordered an alcoholic beverage and a meal. As it was lunch, it was understandably busy. However, Tim took the order of the table next to us within minutes of them sitting down. He checked on them multiple times during their meal. He didn't check on us once. Even something small, asking if we needed anything else, would have been appreciated. Instead, we had to flag down other servers and ask for our check and more water. Sad to say, we will not be going back to that location for a while."}
{"text":"HAWAIIAN MULE!!! If you want a refreshing drink, order this. FYI: it could be stronger. I hope this becomes a permanent drink on their menu."}
{"text":"I went here for a girl's night out.  We had a great time.  It was a party of 8, so they allow a call ahead 30 minutes before your arrival.  We walked right in to our table, in a very crowded Restaurant on a Saturday night.  I had a pear cider, which was really delicious.  I have been craving it again, but can't find it anywhere.  We ordered appetizers, the spinach dip, nachos.  They were pretty good.  But the chopped salad was delicious.  It comes with a tomato gazpacho dressing, which I substituted for balsamic vinaigrette.  Then I tasted the gazpacho dressing-and it was really great, I will definitely try it next time.  I love the selection of beers-and the service was great."}
{"text":"Awesome music, food and drinks. The atmosphere is awesome and the staff is great . A great place to hang out and chill with family and friends."}
{"text":"we are in downtown summerlin just right across red rock and decided to have dinner in YH. we were seated and our server ryan approach us with a smile. ordered tomato bisque & salmon, clam chowder &ribeye for my friend, their food was great although my salmon was a bit dry but it was fine since i enjoyed my soup. i would definitely be back and try some other dish."}
{"text":"Very accommodating and friendly service. French onion soup was not the best I've had, but decent. My boyfriend got the surf n turf burger, which looked amazing. Very reasonable prices on the strip!! Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Happy hour was awesome. Great beer. We sat down ordered beers then food and it came out so fast from the kitchen. Good service too.a-lot  of beers on tap,very nice selection. we recommend the tuna sashimi,very good. We will definently be back."}
{"text":"Yard house is one of my favorite chain restaurants at Desert Ridge.  I have been there so many times and have usually had great service.  However after the service i received there at dinner this evening i am not sure if i will be returning.  Nor do i think that i will be sending any of my guest there (I work in the front office at one of the Marriott across the street).
I got there and expected to wait as it was close to 7pm on a friday.  To my surprise the wait time was only 25 which was fine with me.  I buzzer went off and we went to be seated while they walked us through the the restaurant to one of the booths.  I was shocked the party of 2 they were seating in a booth that sat 6.  We passed several 4 top tables in which they could have sat us at and saved the booth for the other groups waiting.  
Once we were seated two \"servers\" came up to the table.  I am assuming one was training but to my surprise i had no clue who was training who and who the actually server was.  We asked fro two waters and they brought those out to us and walked away before we could say anything to them.  Literally 20 mins later they came back and asked if we had a made a decision yet.  We ordered and of course the food came out pretty quick which is standard for Yard house.  One of the food runner brought the food and out and i am assuming one of the managers(wearing a white shirt)  asked how everything was.  I asked if i could get a side of lettuce that wasn't brown and wilted.  She didn't say anything to me and then again asked how everything was i repeated myself.  The she just became very rude and said i will get you lettuce.  She came back with fresh lettuce and didn't say anything once she arrived at the table.  She set it down and walked away before i could even thank her.
Our \"servers\" never came back until we were done with our meal.   And then brought the checks.  They were very polite but were lacking a major personality.  And as far as the manager goes maybe it is best if she stays away from tables.  
Again the Yard house at Desert Ridge should know that they are going to be busy with all the tourist in the area.  But with the quality of service that i received tonight would not want to make me send anyone to there."}
{"text":"The pepper crusted gorgonzola burger was delicious.  It was pretty busy, but didn't seem chaotic.  We sat outside, it was relaxing and the service was still good.  They had a ton of beers to choose from.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place is so much fun for me and my girlfriend. She is a vegetarian so we do not often get to share our meals.  She was so delighted when she saw veggie sliders and nuggets on the menu she could scream.  The veggie plates are delicious.

Nice to stop for a bite before or after gambling."}
{"text":"We manage to get around to Yard House a few times a year. We like the decor and the fact we can maintain intimate conversations should we desire. The menu is expansive, the beers a specialty and the final product always very good."}
{"text":"A lot of brew on tap but expensive for sure. A tip would certainly be to come for the happy hours when you can take $1 to $2 off beers.  Garlic fries were very good,  bit order a burger well done with crispy bacon and your burger will be charred to burnt. Not intended I'm sure, but it was too burnt. And when you pay $13 for a burger, it should be better!  Overall I liked the experience,  but not sure it's worth the price for what you get."}
{"text":"My friends and family of mostly vegetarians used to love to go here for the Gardein burger. Alas, they no longer carry it. Too bad. We loved that place but will no longer go there."}
{"text":"Picture this: a wonderful day at spring training where you are tired and just want a beer and a great meal. You hear the yard house in this area is good, so you oblige. Next thing you know, your food is cold and the drinks are late. You complain, but to no avail. Contemplating walking our, you plead to the manager. In one fell swoop the food is redelivered along with a comped meal and four Bahama mamas. This is service and the way an exceptional manager runs a restaurant. Schmitten by bad service, believe it or not. 10/10 will dine here again."}
{"text":"We order the chicken nachos and Turkey burger. It was just OK nothing special the chicken was dried out and tough to eat on the nachos. The service was good and had plenty of TVs to watch the games."}
{"text":"Heard lots of pros and cons from friends. Beautiful place. Beer selection is great. I asked if they had four different beers on tap and they had all of them. Service was good, attentive and quick. Food was just OK. I think we were expecting more."}
{"text":"Wasn't very good . Terrible food . Waitress okay. Food sucked . Would not come back. Don't come here"}
{"text":"Jose the bartender is nice and when I go in after a long day at work he is polite and attentive. This place is fantastic and the food is amazing. I like that I never feel like I am at Westgate with some of the other places that have mediocre food and lets face it not the best clientele."}
{"text":"Very good food and great draft beer choices. I went for the halibut which turned out to be a good choice. I also had several beers to"}
{"text":"Ryan our server was awesome! Food was delicious. Had the ribs, creamed corn (best I've had) and mashed potatoes. Ribs were good just a little too charred. Service was good and on time. Menus at the front door. In and out quick. Satisfied"}
{"text":"Great service and an awesome selection of beer and oh ya the food is good too."}
{"text":"Disappointing. Ordered drinks and waited for 30min for waitress (Gwen) to come by and take our food order...she never came. When she did come by, she asked if we were ready for the check. We had to leave hungry. Felt pretty crappy after having alcoholic drinks and leaving on an empty stomach. Thanks for nothing Gwen!!! You should learn how to waitress if that's the job you signed up for."}
{"text":"A Yardhouse representative reached out to me after I posted a review about my experience here at this location. Her sincere apology earned this location more stars. Although they have not replied back to the email they've asked me to send them, I think any establishments that goes out of their way to deeply listen to their clients about their concerns and experience earns kudos from me..and possibly..note: POSSIBLY another visit."}
{"text":"Let me first start out by saying our server Erika, was awesome! Excellent, excellent service from this gal. Anyway, I came here once again on the 2nd with my guy. We were seated immediately by a nice hostess without having to wait. Not too long after we sat down, we were greeted by Erika! She was so friendly, fast, and attentive..even with the place being quite busy. My guy got the jumbo shrimp with Indonesian rice and spinach and I got the fish of the day which was the tombo, served with white rice, broccoli, pesto, mango chutney, and another sauce which I don't remember...sorry! 
Moving on, the shrimp dish was excellent! The rice had a lot of flavors and the sauce they had for the shrimp was a wee spicy..yum! The fish on the other hand, was over done and came out a little dry. So we informed Erika, and bam! No problem! She was so sincere and I actually felt bad that I had to send it back, but the guy insisted. They actually gave me a new plate with the perfectly done fish and once again, Erika was there to make sure everything was right! She also made sure our glasses of water never went empty!
We finished off the meal with a chocolate souffle and as usual, it was deelish! The whole meal cost us 69 bucks and we made sure we left our server with more than 20 percent! 

Great food, excellent service, equals a great night at Yardhouse!"}
{"text":"I love this place, a stand-by for happy hours.  The beer selection is amazing and the food is top-notch for bar grub.

Coming here with a group and knowing a little bit about beer is gonna get you points with any crowd.  Want a nutty brown ale, you got Moose Drool.  Not a beer fan?  Recommend the Lindeman's Framboise.  Want to class it up with a Belgian?  They got everything from Chimay to Gulden Draak.  Beer to impress.

For food, I would recommend the Bernaise Sliders.  Nice rib-sticking bar food that anybody can enjoy.  Will be back frequently!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with this Yard House.  

After a turn on the High Roller, my husband and I decided to stop in at the Yard House located near the Linq for a glass of wine and some appetizers.

At the hostess station, we asked if we could have a seat by the window.  Gleefully the hostess said yes and guided us to a seat in the middle of the restaurant by a glass wall.  Hey bimbo!  A glass wall is NOT  a window!  I asked again to be seated by a window and she said they were all taken.  I asked about the upstairs patio....;.it was closed until six she said.  Okay - It is a BEAUTIFUL day in Vegas in the middle of winter (72 degrees)....OPEN THE PATIO!

So, we waited and waited at our table.......FINALLY a waitress came and took our order.  We had ample time to look at the menu while waiting, so we gave her our drink and food order.

Waiting, waiting, waiting.....twelve minutes later, we get the wine.  Waiting, waiting, waiting......32 minutes later, we get our food.  We ordered the Korean BBQ and Crab Cakes.  COLD.  COLD. COLD.  

So disgusted, we just packed it up and left.  

Great location, terrible staff, terrible service, bad management and cold food.  Don't think I will visit this location again.  So sad because all of the other Yard Houses' I have eaten at were just fine and dandy.  

Eat somewhere else on the mall - skip this one."}
{"text":"Great restaurant with a variety of beers to choose from.   The outdoor seating is a plus when it's not 100 degrees outside.  If you don't try their Mac and cheese at least once you're missing out! It's their signature dish."}
{"text":"Love this place. Go almost every Sunday with my guy. We never get a table just sit at the bar. The bartenders are always so incredibly friendly. Food is great and drinks are awesome. This spot will continue to be ours on Sunday's. Can't get enough of it! It can and does get very busy, but what do you expect when they serve great food with great service?"}
{"text":"Located in Town Square, I was here twice while visiting. Food is slightly overpriced but everything on their menu is delicious. Such an extensive and impressive beer list. The chicken nachos are amazing. It was a great restaurant to go to, and less hectic than anything on the strip. Would definitely recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is newly opened but the service is wonderful. Definitely sit on the upstairs patio. The view of the High Roller is worth it. When you visit ask for Crystal she is a top notch server.

The beer selection is out of this world so enjoy."}
{"text":"Service here was horrible. Gave it three stars because the food and beer were delicious. We did come on happy hour though, so the food was a better price. All the food variety really makes for a great choice no mattter the company!"}
{"text":"Why is it, that when they greet you, the obligatory question is asked - Have you ever been here before? You would think that after 100 or so visits, someone might recognize you. But NO! And even if it's the first visit, why do they ask? The place is a restaurant. They have food and drinks, I get it. Does the fact that it is the first visit or the 115th visit make a difference to them? And why does the server ask if you want another round when we have barely taken 2 sips from the first beer? What's the hurry? Are you running a fast food joint? Who's your biggest competition - Taco Bell? As a whole, the food is great, but the staff could use some common sense and a bare minimum of social skills. I'd say the beer is great, but not to their credit. Anyone can buy a keg and tap it."}
{"text":"great service great atmosphere terrible French fries.  Hamburger was good (truffle something blah blah blah) but not amazing.  Tasted a fellow diner's pork belly taco and wished I would have ordered that.  A few other diners ordered fish and chips that did not look appetizing which explains why they had plenty left on their plates.  

Skip the mini chocolate souffle.  It's just another premade brownie cupcake warmed up in the oven and tasted so. 

All in all I can't say The Yardhouse is a place I'd be excited returning to.  Me thinks its chain restaurant pedigree is too apparent in the food."}
{"text":"Hostess weren't very organized, nor very welcoming but later on got it together. Food was delicious, had the burger with an egg and my best friend had lobster pasta. Both were exceptionally delicious! Our waitress Amy was so kind, professional and welcoming! Great experience!"}
{"text":"My room mate and i eat at yard house a couple times a month.  The food is always consistent and good portions for a good price.  

However the one thing that this company really needs to work on is there customer service.  We were in yesterday evening and we were seated at a table near the bar area we sat there for at least 15 mins before our server even came to the table.  He asked if we had been there and we let him know that we had.  He then asked if we wanted any drinks.  Our friend ordered a diet coke, a order a glass of wine, and he ordered a moscow mule.  The diet coke came a couple minutes later the moscow mule came, about 10 minutes later my glass of wine arrived.  Some excuse about how the manager had to go and get more cause they ran out.  Our server then took our order and argued with our friend about what he wanted for dinner.  And was rude to my room mate and I when we ordered.  He then left and it was another 15 or so minutes that we saw him again.  When he came back i had asked for a glass of water and very rudely agreed to bring some water to the table.  And instead of bringing water for the table like every other table received or every other time we came in he brought just the one glass.  

If i was basing a return to Yard House on this service there is no way that i would come back every.  I work in the hospitality industry and this is no way to treat a guest of your restaurant.  

Please work on the service that you provide."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our lunch here! Try the spicy jambalaya. The shrimp were large, there was plenty of sausage and the sauce was very flavorful. There is a great selection of street tacos (our favorite was the swordfish) add a side salad for about $4, it is certainly worth it. And of course they have a huge beer selection! The wait staff is really helpful when trying to make your beer choice. Definately a go-to for all around good food/drink."}
{"text":"Really not too shabby for a chain restaurant, especially at Westgate!

Probably more of a 3.5, but you've got to hand it to them for the gardein selections on their menu. Awesome. 

The patio is really nice, weather permitting. 

Came back to this location with friends who were visiting family on the west side, and we were promptly seated on a Saturday around 5pm. 

They ordered calamari/salad and I got the gardein orange 'chicken' bowl. Very flavorful and filling, huge portion. Friends enjoyed their food as well. 

Kind of thought it was funny that they kept trying to upsell the 6-months pregnant lady on some alcoholic beverages, but bless their little hearts for trying. 

Definitely worth a visit if you're in the area."}
{"text":"i had the ribeye steak medium with mash potatoes and veggies...  all i have to say is my plate was cooked to perfection!!!  the steak melted in my mouth the mash potatoes were on point and the veggies were magnificent!!!  topped off with a blonde ale beer ... a brotha was in heaven!!!  i recommended this place for good eats and a fun atmosphere!!!"}
{"text":"The food is generally above average, especially the turkey melt with extra jalapenos! 

The staff is friendly and always knowledgeable about the wide selection of beers they have on tap. 

Prices are within range for this type of establishment, overall a great place to meet with friends for a nice lunch or a few beers."}
{"text":"The drinks took way too long to come out, I'm talking 10ish minutes for cokes......starters finally came, the fries were cold, we asked if we could could get some hot fries, even if they just heated them up in a microwave or oven, fresh fries came, that's all my wife ate that night, and was in the bathroom for the next couple of hours of the night. Be careful here"}
{"text":"Fantastic selection of beers, food that is more restaurant quality than bar quality, and open late would be the main points here. Prices are moderate, although cheaper eats that are just as good can be found in outlying suburbs. The view here is always great, and the outdoor seating area is fantastic most times of the year. Service is top-notch as well, even with larger parties."}
{"text":"Well I can say they messed up the gluten free tacos, when a gluten free friend ordered them and ate at least one bit of them, It was clear they were not gluten free, which is THE IMPORTANT PART of gluten free.  People that have allergies order a certain way for certain reasons.   When you forget these VERY IMPORTANT details people can die.   Please pay ATTENTION to these and train your staff to not run into this issue.the food here is OK but nothing to go out of your way to."}
{"text":"Me and my friend just went there and we ordered wings and nachos and everything was delicious. If you go there make your self a favor and order the nachos. Our tab was $14 total. Love it !!!!"}
{"text":"We arrived at 5:45 and saw several open tables, but were told that it would be a 15 to 20 minute wait. Okay not bad.  Two minutes after six, everyone waiting was seated. I saw that happy hour ended at six. Not a big deal as we were not planning on snacks, we wanted dinner. The timing just seemed suspect. Dinner arrived, but tasted nasty. I had orange chicken and my daughter got the Mac and cheese. Neither was very good. Who puts kale on orange chicken? The fish and chips for my wife was very good. Overall disappointed."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was pretty cool and it was nice to have a conversation without having to shout. The food is good but it really didnt blow my mind.  Needless to say, it wasn't bad for my first restaurant experience in Vegas."}
{"text":"Every beer you can imagine is on tap. The wings, California roll are a must try!! The red rock location is awesome"}
{"text":"Typically I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants, but I'll admit it, every time I see a Yard House, I go in! So far I've been to the ones in Pasadena, LA, Waikiki, Kansas City, San Diego, Newport, and Long Beach.

When I'm in the Yard House, I'm like a fat kid in a candy store. There are just so many beers to choose from, I want to try them all! I'm always tempted to order a beer from the craziest looking tap, but I find that the bartender is the best person to speak to for recommendations to suit your taste. Plus he/she will give you free samples!

But don't just look at the taps, there's a whole other selection of beers by the bottle. Those are a little more pricey sometimes, but they're all oh so good! If you're really creative, you can mix your own brews too. Try mixing chocolate stout with a blueberry wheat for a really tasty brew.

The Yard House doesn't actually craft any of their own beers in house, so it's not quite a brewpub. More like a gastropub with a lot of good beers. The selection varies by the time of year, so if you really want to try something special, ask them if they have any specialty or seasonal beers such as pumpkin ales in the fall and berry wheats in the summers. Awesome stuff!"}
{"text":"This is one of my faves. They have a wide selection of menu items and prices are very reasonable. My favorite is the grilled cheese and tomato bisque soup, especially in the winter. Their sweet potato fries are divine! Their pizzas are tasty too. I've never had a bad meal here."}
{"text":"I went to Yard House on Tuesday night for my friend's birthday. The atmosphere was fun. I loved the long booths as I came with 3 other girls. The menu is extensive. Very overwhelming but in a good way. What I enjoyed the most was the option for soy based chicken and beef. I really enjoyed the gardein BBQ chicken salad. The portion was extremely filling and delicious! It was also interesting that our food came out all at once. It wasn't that one person got their food first and we had to wait for the others. I thought this was great because we could all sit and enjoy our food at the same time. For dessert I had the mango sorbet which was so creamy and light all at once. I will definitely come back to Yard House to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Decided to eat here rather than n bothering cooking on a Friday nite. Despite the line, we were able to get a table right away. Though it was crowded and kind of loud it was a good meal. The California roll was great. Highly recommend the kids spaghetti w meatballs. Service was fast and food was good. Lots of options, especially for kids and not a lot of fried food. Would come back again."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and while the food is good, it is not amazing. On my last visit I had their fried chicken. It was average. The mashed potatoes were ok. The creamed corn and BBQ pinto beans were both really good. Their big draw is a huge selection of beers on tap. I will be returning for that and can put up with less than amazing food."}
{"text":"I'm a Yard house Veteran, my first visit was to the Costa Mesa California Yard house at Triangle Square. Had my very 1st Cosmo' Martini there many moons ago. After seeing a movie at the AMC Desert Ridge, my mom and I decided to pop in to the Yard House for a bite to eat, the food is usually really good. I ordered the Shitake Mushroom Noodles from the Snack menu and the Spring Rolls from the Hors Devours menu. The spring rolls were crunchy and tasty , my Noodles on the other hand .... I think they'd been sitting under the warming lights too long. They were mildly warm at best and kind of sticky. I was disappointed because I'd had those noodles before and they'd been really good when hot.  The server never came back to ask if everything was okay and when he did stop by he hurriedly refilled my water glass and kept it moving , almost as if he was nervous I'd ask him for something, he was obviously very busy. Drinks are expensive. I expect more from the Yard House ."}
{"text":"I was there last night and left my wallet on the table. I went back for it and was told a busser picked it up, gave it to a bartender then, it went to a manager. I was missing 80 bucks. The workers and management are super shady and not trustworthy."}
{"text":"Great spot to kick back, have a few beers and a hearty meal. Lots of great options and everything is always fresh! The selection of beer on tap is impressive.

Great clam chowder - best in the valley which isn't saying much but it still hits the spot and is always fresh. 

Just about everything I have tried has been fantastic and I've never had an issue here. I stop by at least once a month!"}
{"text":"Great drink selection and food.  Fun hang before a game or movie.  Great for groups.  Hard to beat Yardhouse."}
{"text":"I would have to say a beer drinkers heaven!!! As usual with big menus it took me forever to decide.  Since I don't drink too much beer,  I opted to try their Pilsner Urquell upon waitresses suggestion. Great taste nice crisp & a dash of citrus.  
For my entre I had the pepper Jack cheese burger with roasted green chiles & fries. The taste was incredible having that roasted green chile made the burger.  
Towards the end of the meal we did have an issue with one of the dishes (due to allergies) corn was supposed to be left off the spinach-corn-mashed potatoes.  The manager did appologize & said if there were any effects later on to call.  They subtracted the dish off the check.  Kudos to our waitress for taking care of that!!!  This makes for a return visit."}
{"text":"The night my husband & I got engaged, we were on the strip and decided to come here for dinner. It was a busy night but we actually had a romantic quiet time. Huge selection of craft beer! We got a few different plates to try and everything was delicious! The service was awesome, our waitress did a really great job in recommending different types of beer and dishes."}
{"text":"Came here a late night to get some food. Had the option to be seated right away but were told to wait 5 min to get a table outside. After 15 minutes we got a table which was fine, after all it was our own choice to do so. 

Menu is rigorous, prices are good and gives everyone a choice.

The food was great, but the service was reeally slow... We probably waited 20 minutes to get our drinks and we got to switch waitress twice. One in the party ordered an app for main, but got it to the table pre main, so he ended up eating before us.

Its a great concept, but lack of execution leaves much to say."}
{"text":"I really like this place, it's got a good crowd and atmosphere. It's a good spot to go with a group of people to hang out during happy hour. Tons and tons of beers which is good but I gotta keep my strict diet in line so I won't drink too much. Service can be mediocre though sometimes so be sure to not be in a hurry when you come here."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour a couple days ago and it seriously was the worst! I'm usually super excited to go to Yard House but after this time I probably won't be back. Our server Natasha was extremely slow and had very little personality. I ordered the Cobb salad and crab cakes and my friend ordered a couple other items. It had been a few months since I had been there so I was unaware of menu changes, even though those changes were not listed on the menu nor were they verbalized to me by my server. So when I received my salad I was surprised because it was a completely different setup. When I asked what it was she said, \"it's your salad, like I was stupid\". I told her that's not how it usually comes and said that they had changed the menu a few months ago. She didn't offer to make it a different way or the old way and after her rude and off putting attitude I just told her I didn't want it. She then runs off with it and doesn't ask if I want something else until I had to ask her. A manager never came by the table to check on us. Our beers sat at the well forever and were warm by the time we got them. Yard House has gone down hill service wise. The food we had was decent, nothing really good. Won't be back here."}
{"text":"Walked in & I felt welcomed , one of the best restaurants with the best greetings ever ! Got sat really quick , our server JESSICA was awesome , I believe she deserves a raise in her position ! Awesome awesome awesome !"}
{"text":"This was my second time here and it was great. I've been to the yard house in town square and both are nice. Can't choose who is better at this time considering the food was delicious at both places. I like the ambiance/decor at this location better than the one in town square though. Both locations have their own great qualities as for as accessibility and entertainment. I guess it all comes down to service. The hostesses at this location are obnoxiously bitchie and arrogant. Never had a problem with the staff at the town square location. Other than that, this Yard House is great and I recommend stopping by!"}
{"text":"And also from Kat, the Thai Chicken Pizza with Macadamia nuts (instead of peanuts) is awesome as well."}
{"text":"One of my favorite hangout places with the boys this place has a ton of selection for beers. One of my favorite appetizer entree if you will is the Korean BBQ Beef with brown rice and vegetables on the side it's absolutely delicious. Their burgers on a scale of 1 to 10 it's probably a seven out of ten they're ok. The portions are good but the flavors it's okay. My friend had the pastrami sliders which were fantastic he was raving about it the entire time


This place is located in Town & Country Mall right off the highway. The atmosphere is fun and they have a lot of shopping in the area. Again if you're in that area and you want a good environment not too expensive I would hit the Yard House."}
{"text":"So many delicious beers! Food is done well, but nothing exceptional. Can be very crowded and noisy with kids."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and only got drinks and was satisfied but the last time I went I tried the food for the first time. YUCK! We got spicy tuna roll, little turkey burgers, and crab cakes. The crab cakes were burnt and not even edible, the turkey burgers were okay but the meat only covered half of the little bun, and the spicy tuna roll was a mound of disgustingness. I will never eat here again and I would not recommend that anyone else eat here."}
{"text":"They can be pricey for a Larger Family, however they are really good. They are casual and dressy. There beer is GREAT!"}
{"text":"Sitting at the table right now. The only consistent thing about Yard House is its ability to be inconsistent. Today's rating  - 2/10; 10 bring the best. 40 min wait for food. A server who told us he is slamming the kitchen because he was slammed by tables. 40 min for salad and chix sandwiches. Salad arrived soggy, wet, but amazingly enough the chicken was dry, burnt and tasteless. 
Add to the joy, the fans and misters were off. When I asked why, I was told they were broken. 5 min after complaining to the manager, fans and misters are turned on. 
How hard is it to provide consistent food and service. It's literally the backbone of all successful restaurants. Clearly, Yard House isn't successful"}
{"text":"Bad service, topped off with a super sketchy sales transaction! Came in with a girlfriend had a few apps and one drink each. Had to remind our server about a missing appetizer. Never checked on us or followed up on drinks, by the time he came around we weren't thirsty anymore.
Fast forward to the sales transaction....server acknowledged two credit cards and repeated to us that he was going to split the check. Server comes back with only one credit card to which the entire check was charged. After minutes of flagging down our server we told him that only one card was charged and one card was missing he quickly took the check back and walked back to the registers. Minutes pass and he returns again now with both cards with split checks and said that the missing card was declined so that's why he didn't bring it back the first time. Dumbfounded, we then brought to his attention that one card was now charged twice (I verified through my online bank app) and his explanation for the other card missing for five minutes during the transaction is extremely suspicious and made no sense. We demanded to speak to a manager and the manager cited that it was busy and there was just a mix up on the registers. To add insult to injury he then tried to diffuse the situation/appease us by offering $5 gift cards! Wow! What we wanted was an explanation for the missing card and a guarantee that we wouldn't get charged three, four, five times for bad service. We walked away with his business card, which we had to ask for and an insincere apology from our server. 

Be sure to dine here if you want subpar service or want to be scammed!

Note: I had to give them a star to continue with this post!"}
{"text":"Food is good for the most part. Service not bad. Lots and lots of different beers.
Now let's get to the stupid part of this place. Grab a seat at the bar, order a little food and a beer. They ask that you pay first. They won't do this if you sit in a booth or at a table. But in a hardly-anyone-there-at-ten-on-a-Saturday-night:  hand over a credit card or pre-pay? Nobody. I mean nobody in Scottsdale that even resembles a classy place does this. I'm not talking about The Mint crazy bar scene where it is reasonable to ask for the plastic to start a drink tab. Not even Denny's asks for cash first before food delivery. Idiotic.
Also, lots of TVs but don't get too caught up in one thing because they like their soccer in there and they will change the channels without warning. The good sport you might be watching can easily turn into mostly bright green pixels with shirtless and  knee-grabbing Euros trying to score what would be about the third goal ever successfully made in the history of that sport.
Want a great sports bar, one mile away? Go to Zipps on Camelback. Down to earth, friendly, great food and easily 2/3 the price of the Out House."}
{"text":"Foods pretty good but the service at the bar is very slow.  And it looks like they go out of their way not to make eye contact with you.  Really?  I'd give it 4 stars if it wasn't for the service."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner with my daughter after shopping. The wait was relatively short considering how busy it was. We were seated at a table in a high traffic area. It was extremely noisy, not sure if that's normal for this place but it makes it difficult to have a conversation. We had to request silverware settings when our meal came so we had something to eat with as apparently no one recognized we didn't have any. My daughter ordered a club sandwich and was surprised that the cheese wasn't even melted. My roast beef dip was nasty. The bun was just barely bigger than a hotdog bun, it was completely soggy on the bottom and the meat was luke warm at best and lacked flavor. I ended up just sending it back. Most likely wont be going back to this restaurant any time soon."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner - the food was pretty decent and the service was very prompt and friendly.  I've been to other locations before and enjoyed the experience as well.  May come back to try other dishes and see if they get a bit more *exciting* or if it continues to just be standard fare."}
{"text":"If you don't mind eating in a crowded, chaotic, and loud place (pop/rock ear-piercingly loud, tv's, people shouting to talk, dishes crashing in the open kitchen) then you'll probably enjoy yourself here. If you find the above unsettling, you'll be putting your fingers in your ears and counting the minutes til it's time to go. The food is alright, not amazing, but good. Our server was really sweet and hard working and the chairs are comfortable. But make sure you're okay with crazy loud or you'll be miserable there. It's more of a big open bar feel than a restaurant. Not a place you can even have a conversation with those at your table. I'm giving it a three instead of a two-star because of the great beer selection (note: a draft pint was $7.05.)"}
{"text":"Yard house has amazing food !! It was my first time last week.  I love how it's vegetarian friendly. I only wished our waitress was a little nicer and payed more attention to my friends and I."}
{"text":"I have dined at Yard House on multiple occasions and at different locations. This past experience was unenjoyable. After a 45 minute wait, (which is fine!), we were ready to eat. We were sat outside on the patio; the weather was nice so that was ok. Our server was attentive and always had a smile on her face. While waiting for our food, a giant dog walks by inside the patio area, and when I say giant, it was an Irish Wolfhound. The other dog it was with was an identifiable service dog. As I have never experienced a Yard House allowing dogs on the patio, I was a bit shocked. The moment the dinner experience went south was when the individual right behind me was smoking. She was shielding her party from her cigarette smoke by keeping her cigarette between the back of her chair and mine. I understand the AZ smoking law and patios. The no smoking sign was right next to our table, which was right next to the door. I am not a fan of spending a significant amount of money to enjoy the flavor of the dish only to have it destroyed by someone's cigarette. It really took away from the food. I said something to the server, and she agreed they shouldn't have been smoking right there. I asked for the check before my daughter had an asthma attack. Lesson learned, inside dining only if you want the non smoking section."}
{"text":"We went to The Yard House to watch a football game recently. During happy hour the apps are half price and there are various drink specials. The food is delicious for bar style food and the beer selection is huge. Lots of TV ' S to watch your favorite games. Great service goes along with the great atmosphere. Would return."}
{"text":"Yard House is my favorite happy hour spot. Especially the town square location, they have the best service.  Yard House has just about everything you're looking for in types of food and great deals. Highly recommend the poke Nachos & the Vampire taco !"}
{"text":"Yard House at the Red Rock...A bit smaller than the ones in California, but that's okay. I've come to just accept that every Yard House everywhere will always be packed and crowded! Getting a drink at the bar can be just as bad as getting a drink at the bar at a nightclub. Luckily for my party of 10, we had reservations. The host told us it was a 2-Hour wait if we didn't! The music they play is pretty cool, but WAAAAYY too loud! You have to yell and read lips just to have a conversation with the person sitting right next to you! I'm all for a good vibe with good music, but please turn it down a notch or 3!!! 

The food here is just okay. Granted, I haven't tried many things on the menu, but the sliders and fries I ordered came out kind of cold. I would compare the food to maybe B.J's across the street. It's just OKAY. But, the food does go well with the alcohol you'll be drinking! The only drink I order from here is their Framboise. You gotta try it! It's kind of a raspberry flavored beer that doesn't really taste like beer but probably a girly version of it. Regardless, the Framboise...get it! SO GOOD! 

The service was actually pretty good. Our waitress was kind enough to ask us if we would like separate checks before taking our order, and was able to do it for us. Almost all waitresses hate doing separate checks, but thank goodness she offered it with a smile! 

So next time you're there, remember to try the Framboise!"}
{"text":"Good. Had the Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich and garlic fries for lunch. Big portions. I couldn't eat it all! Service was great. Very friendly. Little bit of a wait, but there was a convention in town"}
{"text":"Nothing special anymore. 
Yardhouse used to be a cool place to go because of all the different beer on tap. Its a nice novelty and the beer is served cold(one of my pet peeves). The food is overpriced in my opinion, but its good. 
Here is my contention: why get a steak at Yardhouse when the metropolitan grill is less than a football field away? Why get fish when Kona grill is next door? Why get a pizza when Ztejas is a short walk?
So, why get anything but a burger at Yardhouse? Their menu is all over the place. Jambaliya at Yardhouse? Common. 
This is a good place to hit happy hour and grab a game. And, they do have a good happy hour with half price app's. Keep your food orders to the basics----sliders, chicken wings and such which will contain your food bill. 
Service is good. At least it wasn't Johnny tackle box or Jenny etch-a-sketch serving me this time. Parking can be a hassle at Scottsdale fashion square."}
{"text":"Great location and the service at the bar was top notch!

Let's me  start by say I would have given it 5 stats, but the peach cobble portion was super tiny for the price you pay!

Drinks were made to perfection and promptly even as the bar tender Amy I think seamed to be the only one working. After a while some people showed up but she handled the bulk of  everything by yourself.

I had the steak medium rare to say it was cooked deliciously would not do it's due respect. Temperature was perfect, taste  was juicy and look was amazing.

This Yardhouse location is a cut above the rest of the chains locations, and I have been to 8 different locations in SoCal."}
{"text":"This place is great.  The weekend bar staff, Dana, Shawn, and Sal rock.  We always receive stellar service and the food and beer selections are outstanding."}
{"text":"The service.  5 STARS.  I've always been a fan of Yardhouse but this location is now my favorite.  Bartenders to the manager (I didn't get his name but he gave the scoop on the Masters golf championship ... got me watching golf!).... everyone was were so friendly. Anways, the layout is contemporary, great view out door seating, great food (I had the \"Poke Stack\"), and excellent customer service."}
{"text":"Great beer selection and great food! Their tortilla soup is the best in town!"}
{"text":"Ok, the food is good. The atmosphere-good. What is AWFUL is the hostess/seating service. They usually have 2-3 hosts on any given day and not one of them are capable. Twice I have been placed on a waiting list of 20+ minutes despite seeing 3 or more tables and outside seating totally open and available--and I am not counting open tables that just need cleaning.  The waitlist had 3 guests before us. Why hadnt they been seated already?!  I am sure they were thinking the same thing. They also neglected to offer the bar seating. I am exhausted by their snobbery.  Went to Gordon Biersch instead. Was seated and served immediately. Food and atmosphere there was GREAT. GB got our patronage and our server enjoyed a 20%+ tip."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings when it comes to this brewery and restaurant, which has a prime location at Scottsdale Fashion Square. The food is good. I recommend the delicious baked macaroni and cheese and the martinis are excellent. However, the service at the bar is lacking. I've been to Yard House a few times over the last couple of months (I'm usually dragged here because my friends love the place and I  cave in because I don't want to be difficult) and the bartenders -- one guy in particular -- are extremely snooty. The last thing I want when I go into a bar is getting the holier than thou attitude from my bartender and that's all I get when we sit at the bar here. If you want good food and drinks, this is a good place to go, just be sure to sit far, far away from the bar. The wait staff is much more pleasant."}
{"text":"Chelsea our waitress was extremely rude and unprofessional. Worst service ever here at west gate"}
{"text":"Took an hour to get food. Order was wrong. They took it back. Took another half hour to get it. Was wrong again. They said sorry and were gracious enough to take it off my bill.   Huh?  I got no meal. Why would u charge me?  Over 2 hours, no food and insulted. Went over to paradise bakery."}
{"text":"So good!!! There food is amazing! Service is always great. Pricing is fair, the food quality is great. Salad is to die for. Def a good choice!"}
{"text":"My 1st visit to the Yardhouse was exceptional. Sorry for the long post but I took it from my FB I made about both the Yardhouse and Saddle Ranch at Westgate

I wanted to share my two great customer service experiences I had when I went out last night. We started with dinner at Yard House - Glendale after we placed our order my friends food arrived quickly but my mac-n-cheese was taking a little longer. No big deal we weren't in a rush. The waitress checked on us again a 5 or 10mins later still no mac-n-cheese. Turns out the order wasn't placed because the printer cut it off the slip. The manager was very apologetic and took it off our bill. We didn't ask her to so the gesture was very much appreciated. 

 After dinner we walked over to Saddle Ranch for a drink grabbed a table on the patio and waited for our waitress and waited and waited and waited. A manager was a couple of tables away working on schedules so I asked her if we needed to go in to the bar to order (we had seen a server pass by a few times) She said absolutely not called someone on her headset and a security guard came by to check on us and took our drink order. He continued to check on us the entire time we were there and informed us the general manager took care of our drinks. When we left I got back to my car and realized I had left my iPhone on the table. I quickly drove around, rushed back to the table (the entire time thinking the worst) only to find it not there. I stopped the waitress and she said the security guy that had been helping us had it. WHEW!! So relieved! In a culture of get em' in get em' out to make more money Thank You Yard House and Saddle Ranch for providing excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"We stayed at the Linq for four days. Finding this gem (thanks yelpers!) made our trip! We ended up having lunch there one day and late-night dinners the next two nights. For lunch: I had the Cuban while my other half had the Roast Beef Dip sandwich. Both were huge and delish! Late-night to-go orders: The Chicken Enchilada stack was spicy and yummy. The BBQ Burger didn't disappoint either. Prices were the best: $15-18 per plate (less for the burgers), staff were professional and fun...what a combo! Did I mention their beer/cider list? I was torn between a few ciders, and our server graciously brought me some free samples. $7.00 for a pint of delicious cider. To find this awesome spot from the Linq: follow the signs to the High Roller (ferris wheel). Yard House is directly across from the Ticket window, beneath the High Roller. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of Yardhouse only because its loud, crowded and the waiting time to sit is long. Don't go starving... 
Our first time at this location was a great experience.  Our waiter was friendly and genuinely happy.  She was always refilling our water when it was half full, cleaned our table in perfect timing as the next dish would come.  
Not only great service, but the food was on point. 
Couple appetizers... Fried Calamari and onion ring tower.  Not oily or heavy.  
Entrees... ahi crispy salad and chicken fingers.  Large portion of salad with fresh bright red ahi. Best salad so far.  
Dessert... mini lemon souffle and home made baked brownie with ice cream. Both were on point that we completely devoured.  Prefect end to a great dinner."}
{"text":"The variety of beer and portion sizes are great, I really liked my salad, however the service is NOT. My order was forgotten twice and then not excluded from the bill. Second time's the charm to get me to not go back to this particular location."}
{"text":"I went here after an event last weekend. The service was friendly and the food was plentiful. I gave it three stars, because there's nothing exciting to rave. I'll go back again the next time I am in Town Square, since it's consistently delivers."}
{"text":"First time eating at a Yard House. Went during happy hour on a Thursday and sat in the outdoor seating. Very relaxed atmosphere. Food was reasonably priced for Vegas and service was awesome. Would definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"Last night, my wife and I were exhausted and hungry and needed a good break.  The Yardhouse offered that.  The customer service was superb, but not clingy and the food was spectacular.  The LARGE tap beer selection is, in a word, phenomenal.  If you want a quiet night of dining, or a sports bar environment, you can get both in this place, and not feel detrracted from either desire.  5 stars for service, quality of food, and atmosphere.  Definitely recommend to anyone.  We'll be going back whenever we're in Phoenix/Glendale again."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time a couple of days ago & i am in love! Great beer & great service. Also love that they have vegetarian options, it was so delicious! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible. Very dirty, and no customer service. It started out with dirty food encrusted plates to a tortilla with an avocado fingerprint on it. I want to throw up just thinking about it. The waitress was not friendly at all, and did absolutely NOTHING about the filthiness that was our experience. Stay away from this place."}
{"text":"Wish I could give zero stars. I LOVE Yardhouse and I have been craving it all day. My fiancé and I arrive around 5:45pm. We got our pager and we were told it works throughout the casino. (And even if we misheard, no need for the attitude we received.) We then sat out, not 10ft away, and played some games. We got a ring in our pager and went into the restaurant. One hostesses said, \"I'm sorry that was a mistake.\" To which my fiancé replied, \"what was?\"  Then two women behind he counter decided to become some sort of Anti-costumer employees and said, \"UM WE BUZZED YOU 6 minutes ago, and after three minutes we go to the next person.\" 

Ok couple things. 1) only buzzed once. 2) you work in a service industry. So did I got a long LONG time. Never once have I considered be so disrespectful, even to the MOST miserable costumer. However, Yardhouse seems to employee women who get to determine who lives and who dies, or so they seemed on their high horse. 

Too bad. Just spent about 60$ at Lucills. Where the service is actually......good. Interest concept for a.....RESTAURANT."}
{"text":"My siblings and I were seated outside on November 7th in the late afternoon.  The food was medicore and mostly came out cold but I would have given 3 stars because the service was excellent.  However, our issue was the feral cat  the establishment allows to roam the outdoor dining area.  We were told that this cat roaming our feet has already had two litters and is obviously pregnant again.  It was very unnerving to have a feral cat bothering us & making us feel uncomfortable.  There are agencies that can be called to help this cat such as the Feral Cat Coalition.  I would suggest that management be a little more proactive not only for the cat but for their customers."}
{"text":"Perfect for dinner. They have plenty of dishes, burgers, salads, crab rolls and super sweet ice cream."}
{"text":"Loved this place have eaten there on several occasions, no complaints from me! Had the Lamb burger on one visit and on other visits had Baja Fish Tacos they were amazing I made them at home the next day for family they loved them, the mac and cheese my friend had that was also good. Tried the Blue Crab Cakes they were yummy, my friend had the Korean Pork Belly Tacos plus desserts and cocktails! Would recommend this place, yes it gets busy, its popular so you have to wait awhile sometimes be patient its worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Sorry, this place sucked. It was crowded, the service was absolutely awful and the food was mediocre. I was literally asked for my I'D 3 separate times (I'm 45 by the way) AND you're only \"allowed\" 1 drink at the bar per ID.... even though the waitress at the table took at least 45 minutes between rounds..... yeah,  NEVER going back to this establishment."}
{"text":"Seriously the burger bun fell apart once I grabbed it. It seemed very old.
The owner should do something about this. By the way a friend of mine told me about him having the same issue.. big problem.."}
{"text":"My girlfriends a picky eater and they were really good with making sure her order came out right. The california roll (appetizer) wasn't what we were expecting though, probably wouldn't order it again. Lots of good beer to pick from. The wait wasn't too long either. I would come here again."}
{"text":"Service varies. I've found that the waiters that work The tables outside are More friendly. Jambalaya with jasmine rice and the macaroni and cheese (not your average mac and cheese; theirs has bacon chicken different cheeses and spices added to it to make it gourmet) are my two Faves. Timmermans strawberry beer is yummy. Or else I go for My usual blue moon with an orange."}
{"text":"Yard house at Westgate was fantastic. I was in town visiting and decided on Yard house for lunch. The food was great the atmosphere was also great.  The service was exceptional. Our server Chelsea was very attentive, helpful and knowledgeable about the menu and more importantly patient. I was with my parents and was really excited they had 100 draft beer selection. I ordered the Alaskan Smoked Porter and my father was able to have a Peroni on draft WOW what great beer. I'll be back every time I'm in town. Thank you Yard House and your team members."}
{"text":"They were out of the first beer I ordered. The server suggested another one, which was good. They have an extensive menu. I have always enjoyed whatever I have ordered as far as food goes. The service was good too. The waiter was conscious of us needing to get going quick as we were trying to catch a movie. He was quick with the check which is ALWAYS helpful!"}
{"text":"I love the Yardhouse happy hour' regular dinner menu and just to stop and have a drink. The Yardhouse in Town Square is better than the one in Red Rock as they will take reservations on the weekend even for a table of 24. Their menu is quite extensive with a variety of American style, contemporary dishes. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Yes I am a fan of this particular Yard House at Desert Ridge. Let me tell you why....first of all the staff is friendly and ready to help. The decor is casual with lots of large screen tvs without being over the top sports bar. There is a center bar with tables surrounding it and large booths along the walls. Seating is plentiful with outdoor seating also. The menu is extensive and has something for everyone. Along those lines, the beer selection is amazing. Try the tasting the beer sampler. We narrowed our orders down to the appetizer size of Korean Beef Taco and a Hawaiian Poke Stack to start. The taco was a small flour tortilla topped with marinated grilled beef, Asian slaw and a spicy DELICIOUS sauce. The Hawaiian Poke Stack was visually beautiful. Sushi grade Ahi cubed and sprinkled lightly with black sesame seeds topped with a layer of Asian slaw then a crispy wonton, finally slices of avocado and ANOTHER pile of ahi with a few sprouts. All this surrounded by a soy/wasabi sauce. Yes, it was fantastic. For entrees, we selected the Lunch Pairing of Margherita pizza/spicy house salad and an Ahi Crunch salad. This place knows how to do salads....Mixed greens with shredded carrots, perfectly steamed broccoli, a few crunchy wonton chips, sprouts and a wonderful spicy salad dressing. We were really impressed with the quality of the sushi grade Ahi...We also decided to try the \"Eclipse\" beer which was a Blue Moon Pale Ale with a float of Guinness on top. Yup, we are fans. I'm going to try the Porcini crusted Halibut next time. Just GO!"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant many times, and never fails! Happy hour is incredible! Beers on tap are endless! And the food! The food is incredible! The staff is always on par, even though it's always busy! What more can you ask for!"}
{"text":"I like Yard House! I have never really had a problem with yard house, I like the food, the service could be a bit slow it just depends on what time of the day you go. The truffle fries are so good!! The drinks are always up to par."}
{"text":"Stopped in after doing some shopping at Fashion Place. I loved the rock n roll music. We had the bbq chicken salad and my wife had the penne chicken pasta. Food and the service was good. We would go back next time in Scottsdale"}
{"text":"New England clam chowder is one of my all time favorites and yesterday I stopped by the Yard House in Town Square and ordered a cup of chowder and wings. I immediately regretted my decision, since the last time I went to the Yard House in Summerlin the chowder was watery, had very little flavor and was not good. Instead of canceling my order I figured I'd try it since I was at a different location. Wow! I was pleasantly surprised to have the most fantastic New England clam chowder I have had since the East coast. It was the perfect consistency and loaded with flavorful clams. I definitely got my money's worth. The service was excellent, as they bought my glass of wine since there was a minimal delay in my drink order. A delay I barely noticed, but I did make a point of telling them to call the chef in Summerlin and teach him how to make clam chowder."}
{"text":"Love this place! Has great beer selections and great apps! My favorite items to order are the onion ring tower and the nachos. Both of these items are fit to share with a group of people. This is one of my favorite places to go on the weekends"}
{"text":"Pretty cool place to hang out. Beers are great and decently priced (around $6.25 for the beers) and they have a HUGE selection. They also have happy hour, (half price beers) I believe its Sun. - Thurs. still from 10 pm - 2 a.m. Customer service is always great here. The staff is fun and friendly. However food is not so great here. I go to Yardhouse often for the drinks but never eat the food there. It's kind of bland and the price is not worth its value. But like I said, its a great place to hang out and relax, grab a couple beer with some friends and watch the game, but just don't eat here."}
{"text":"The 2 stars are because they politely let me down, lol. One star for each person I spoke with I guess. I haven't been to this location yet and if I had to based it off my conversation with the manager, it doesn't sound like I'll have the pleasure to visit. I called today to make reservations for my party of 20 for September 1st at 1700 (5pm). I was politely told that YHL could not make reservations past 12N for that holiday Friday, and that they may not even be able to accommodate us at all. The manager did mention if it was a chance they had the space the day of we probably wouldn't be seated together. I explained that we're celebrating our birthdays together and scattered seating wouldn't work to well. I offered to pay a deposit and was denied, bc YHL doesn't accept deposits. I know minus 20 people won't have any impact on your business that Friday. This was just the only restaurant we all could agree to. Great food!! People come and celebrate with large groups/parties in Vegas all the time at all times of the year right? Should patrons of large parties on high traffic times of the year not even consider Yard House LINQ for dinner?"}
{"text":"This place is hopping!

Maybe over The Top. \"Beer Menu\"?

I went for a \"sampler\". 2 versions, one is lighter (which I had), the other is heavier.
$8.95 for 6 small glasses of beers from San Francisco - Alaska.

It was good.
Food Looked great. I didn't eat. Just there to check it out. Hard to tell who wasn't on business in the crowd due to all of the credit card purchases (or debit maybe?). Suspect though there were locals.

Nice room. BIG! Screens everywhere with piped in Vid's. Music, I heard Foghat, Alice Cooper, and......lost track.

Good crowd. 20's -30's. It was Saturday night.

It's on the South side of Town Square (near the Airport). Just behind Guitar Center & Rave Motion Pictures.

Food looked Great!! Prices? Didn't look.

Yard House. Get's it's name from the Yard tall glasses you can get a beer in. Looks like a hassle to me.

Definitely hopping place!!
And a lot of Tap's to choose from.

I don't know if they have any of their own Brews though. If not, they should. If not I should also deduct a Star........."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, I think it's great that yard house is vegetarian-friendly with their Gardein menu. Their portions are generous, and the service is good. From their Gardein menu I have tried their Wings, Chicken Strips, Orange Peel Chicken, Gardein Burger, and Spicy Thai Chicken Salad. 

My favorite gardein dish is the fried chicken strips. They are definitely not healthy and are served with french fries; but they are crispy and tasty. Good for comfort cravings at a reasonable price.

The wings are also good, I've tried the buffalo and jerk. I thought the buffalo was a little too salty, but good. The jerk wings were also pretty good as a sweet asian style wing. 

The Orange Peel Chicken dish was disappointing. First, it's like $17 for brown rice and fake meat. Chinese restaurants do not charge that much for real orange chicken. Second, the orange flavor of the dish wasn't good. It just tasted like orange rind and didn't have much spice. Definitely overpriced for a basic dish that wasn't good. 

The Gardein Burger was okay. The Gardein meat did not taste good and had bad texture. The texture wasn't charred or crispy. It was soft and unappealing. I've had a lot of veggie burgers and was not impressed. Yard house assembled a pretty good burger aside from the Gardein meat though.

Lastly, the Spicy Thai Chicken Salad was alright. It's a classic chicken salad with a teriyaki and celery kind of flavor. The gardein chicken was shredded and tasted okay. Maybe I just think this dish in general isn't much of a crowd-pleaser, but it wasn't anything special. I would have opted for a grilled gardein chicken Caesar salad."}
{"text":"Location, food, and service were all fantastic!  Truffle fries, street tacos, and Cobb Salad are all worth a try. Very pleased!"}
{"text":"First time at Yard House last night. The service was beyond outstanding. Shanna was the best server I have had in the 2 years I have lived in the valley. Her energy was amazing. The food was good but the 5 star rating is based on service. The Steak sandwich was good. the garlic shitake noodles were outstanding. The Smores brownie was out of this world. Mudshark caramel vanilla porter was great"}
{"text":"Their food is ALWAYS great, and has never been disappointing by any means. Their menu has so many options, you could eat there very frequently and not eat the same thing twice. Their extensive beer selection is unmatched.  Service has always been both professional and accomodating. The atmosphere rocks and they usually have great music on. The Yardhouse makes it easy to take my picky mom out for lunch!"}
{"text":"The food and service here was great. We ate as a group of 8 and happily paid 18% gratuity each time. Great beer selection."}
{"text":"Food was great! Our server Kate was terrible and unfriendly. She doesn't know our liquor laws for the state of Arizona and rushed me into finishing my drink before I could get another one. She didn't smile and when I asked her for her recommendations she was very uninterested in my questions about the menu."}
{"text":"Love the food but every time I order for take out I order chicken tortilla soup. They tell me 15 minutes to come get it, I usually take longer because I'm at work and every time I end up waiting another 10-15 minutes... Seriously for soup?!? I mean are they going out and killing the chicken?"}
{"text":"So so food, so so service. Had a soup/sandwich combo for lunch, the soup was good - sandwich, not so much. Asked 3 times for silverware, never got it."}
{"text":"Tried spicy tuna... Totally disliked it.. Hummus, sweet potatoes fries were not good.."}
{"text":"I don't even have the energy to list all of the reasons why my experience here was negative. They messed up. Bad. I went into detail about a dietary restriction of mine, I was assured it would be no problem, took a couple of bites before I realized I was served the complete opposite. Manager came out to apologize with an \"I-don't-really-give-a-crap-about-your-problem-attitude\". Due to their carelessness, the food made me sick and I will not go back/recommend. Hope you're experience here is better than mine. Don't expect them to care either way."}
{"text":"The steak I had was amazing! And our server was great! Funny and friendly. I wish I could remember his name but my friends and I were having too much fun. The only negative thing is that the host didn't help me find my friends table. He said good luck finding them lol besides that I would definitely recommend :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to yard house yesterday because he loves the garlic lobster noodles. I also enjoy all of the items on the menu. What I was most concerned about and frustrates me to know no end. I gave my credit card, which it says on the back see ID. Which means you need to ask me for my ID when taking the card. This never happened. As a restaurant serving guests you have a personal responsibility to ensure the security of every guest. It only takes a second to verify the credit card information and ask for an ID. Especially when we are living in a hyper sensitive, high security alert, fraud raging society."}
{"text":"Had lunch at the yard house today , Sunday football season fairly busy. Ordered the crab, lobster and artichoke dip . Lots of crab meat and crab flavor, nice chunks of lobster, can't really taste the lobster because the crab was over powering . Maybe they should omit lobster and give a bigger portion or charge less. I'm guessing maybe 5oz portion of dip, comes w flat bread and chips. Onion rings served red robin style on a metal peg. I like these better then RR looked like made in house w/ a beer batter, and dusted w/ parm cheese. If this is the batter they use for there fish and chips , nice. I had the crab cake hoagie bread was toasted nicely , it came with two crab cakes about 2 -3oz ea. Bacon,tom  lett and onion. I could only eat half I didn't care for the Cajun aioli it came with, but that's not YH fault my own personal taste, next time I know to get tartar sauce. Fries was shoe string very good. Wife had the mac and cheese , with  chix , mushroom and bacon , I had a little taste . No big deal she liked it,i'm sure she'll write her review. Menu reminds me of claim jumper , something for everyone's taste . I would eat here again ."}
{"text":"We saw our waiter one time for the order and one time for our check.  Not once did we get checked on the entire meal.  

We were brought the wrong side (told the guy that dropped off the food, it was wrong and still no replacement) 

We had empty glasses before the food even arrived and never got refills-um, since our waiter was non existent.   

I'm sure this guy broke some sort of record for how many times he can avoid a table during a single service.   I've had more interaction with Starbucks servers...

The food tastes great, A+! 
Service was an F"}
{"text":"I have visited this location on many occasions with varying parties and it's always a hit! Delicious food, mixed drinks and draft beer make for an awesome start to a night out! If you make it early enough you can also enjoy a walk through Town Square; maybe squeeze in some shopping ladies!"}
{"text":"Food was good. I went during happy hour so i didn't break the bank. My server Devon was very polite, checked on the table often. Clean. Not so busy environment during the weekday. Will have more parties here."}
{"text":"Gotta love the beer selection. The restaurant itself - very cool. Food mediocre but hey - they got all that beer."}
{"text":"another great meal and half yard at the yard house.  great tunes always playing, very attentive staff and a huge menu somewhere between eclectic and funky.  always a winner in my book, but alwasy cold, bring a sweater!"}
{"text":"The beer selection is great... that being said, the food is what it is. Cookie cutter, out of the box, processed food. I had the bearnaise sliders and it looked like the end of chopped when they are frantically slopping food on the plate. The flavors were blah and it was a gut bomb later. The only saving grace was the ice cold beer."}
{"text":"So upset because they close the restroom at this hour and they cannot tell me any reason for it. They want me to walk all the way out to use the restroom. It's not like I was just walking in to use the restroom. My bf and I ate dinner and drank beer. It's very annoying especially when you really need to void."}
{"text":"It was over priced, the food was poor, and the atmosphere was nothing special.  They have a good amount of beer to choose from, but that doesn't make up for the other short comings."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of Yard House (or at least this location). It was so loud inside and the menu didn't have anything special. It's basically a general American restaurant. I don't know what is supposed to make it stand out or what the appeal is."}
{"text":"Honestly you can't go wrong with this place. It was a bit tucked away from the strip, so you avoid the insanity for a little while. The service was very attentive, knowledgable, and were actually out to ensure you have a good experience. You can tell they're wonderful because the management is as well. I informed the host I had food allergies and the manager came right out to discuss all of my options. He even double checked with the kitchen on any small question I had. The server was just as careful, and had an entire conversation to learn more about food allergies. I ended up ordering a burger on a lettuce wrap and the meat itself was phenomenal. I am very picky with burgers, so that is saying a lot. The drinks are also amazing and 100% worth the price. I wish I could travel back to Vegas just to eat another meal!!"}
{"text":"I am floored how expensive the food is.... Place is way over priced."}
{"text":"Great family place 5 meals for under $100 can't beat that!
Food tastes great and beer and cocktails where pored just right."}
{"text":"The Nashville Hot Chicken is great. I was skeptical cause it's fried but it's great. The Spicy Tuna Roll is not a roll but a dish and it's great. Loaded with avocado and seared tuna. Delicious. 
Update: I had the brownie with caramel ice cream and I'm in heaven. Stuffed. In heaven."}
{"text":"Always a great restaurant to come to. I was on a special diet when I visited and then made my order exactly how I asked. And the waiter was very polite about it too and didn't make me feel as if I was putting them out. Much appreciated. My plain good tasted great too. Will be back again."}
{"text":"I tried their turkey burger and it was excellent! It was thick and juicy, very flavorful. The desserts looked amazing, but I was so full from lunch that there was no way I could take another bite of food. The waitress was nice and we didn't have to ask for refills on our drinks, she was on it....I love that!"}
{"text":"I've never written a review about any restaurant unless it was a positive one but, this one is worthy of a write.  Weeks ago, while having dinner and a few drinks at the Yardhouse....I began to realize that the  Yardhouse bills itself as a restaurant.  It also, heavily promotes itself as a bar.  I feel that the atmosphere is a bit confusing.  What's more,  if you want to have a conversation with the folks you're dining with, this is not the place for you, especially during a Friday or Saturday night.  It is chaos!!  Most of the servers seem nice and knowledgeable however, I found myself being privy to a conversation between a manager and an employee that I had no business hearing.. Our table was very close and within ear shot of one of the stations servers use to input food.  This manager raised his voice loud enough (in anger) for it to rise above even the music.  Unacceptable!!!  What's more, there seemed to be enough managers there for two businesses. 'Further, this particular employee seemed pretty upset about it but, she kept on working.....hmmmmmm....not sure what happened there but, Yardhouse.....I won't be coming back.  I want to enjoy the food and the sports.....the yelling at employees and loud music, I can do without.  BJ's, much more relaxed atmosphere, you can watch sports and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Good food, good drinks, fun place. Lots of beer... makes the husband very happy. Too noisy though; not a great place for conversation."}
{"text":"If you like beer, this is your place. There are 160 beers on tap, but that's not the only reason to go. The deck on the second floor is a great way to check out what's at the LINQ. 

I had the turkey club. It was pretty average as far as club sandwiches go, but it was very tasty. The portion was more than enough for a hungry man. It comes with fries but I upgraded to sweet potato fries. You can also get truffle fries. Yumm! 

The service was excellent. Our waitress, Lisa, was personable and attentive. A manager came by to check on our meal.  The wait for drinks and food was reasonable...nothing to make you wonder \"what's taking so long?\" 

The prices are typical for Vegas..no surprises there. I would recommend this place and go there again. ..If there weren't so many other places here I want to try!"}
{"text":"Oh where did my old Yardhouse servers go? My boyfriend and I came here all the time. We love the beer selection and the servers were attentive, knowledgeable and experienced. However, the last 3 visits have not been pleasant. Each time we see new staff and we wait, and wait, and wait... finally a server... 10 minutes. Order our beer and food. Wait some more, another 10 minutes before our the  beer arrives! 20 minutes so far. Now this is a Weds night, not on a weekend.  Did I mention I miss the great servers they used to have? I am writing this while we wait for our food. Server then comes by and says she thinks the wrong food was ordered.... ugghhh. Then bf's food arrives but no lettuce wraps for me...waiting... his food getting cold while he waits politely for my food to appear. I used to love it here! Why did some big company have to buy them and drive out the good service?  Finally 35 minutes after being seated I get my food. But has anyone asked if we would like a refill on our beer? No.... food is still pretty ok and beer selection is great. Got the servers attention to order beer and dessert, whew! Server that delivered BFs beer is one of the veterans... he's like hey! Where have you guys been! We tell him about our last couple visits, much like this one...  yeah we used to love it here..."}
{"text":"After a long drive from Utah, the boy and I decided to meet up some cousins at Yardhouse before our final leg to California. The boy and I are familiar with the Yardhouse in Rancho Cucamonga so it was an easy decision as to what we would get for dinner. We arrived just in time for happy hour and got crab cakes and calamari. Our cousin who is not fond of anything seafood dug right in, which was a huge surprise. Calamari was alright. The tartar sauce wasn't as good as I remembered. It seemed a little bland.  The service for the drinks was a little slow. It took over 15 minutes for the house blonde. For dinner I chose my regular the mac and cheese and he had the grilled chicken and avocado sandwich. Immediately we noticed how dry my food was. It looked to have been sitting under the heat lamp for awhile. I ignored it and dug right in. I had to use salt and pepper to flavor it up (which I've never had to do) and it still tasted bland. We were extremely disappointed in the food but the service was pretty good overall."}
{"text":"We ended up coming here because the restaurant we set out for was crowded.  We were sat right away and received great service from our waiter, Carlos.  We were in town for a Cardinals game the next day and he gave us hints for the next day that were actually useful.  He knew the area we were staying in and provided shortcuts to get to the stadium around traffic.  Aside from that, the food was great and they had a good, well-priced kids menu as well.  I didn't have a beer this time, but they had a huge selection of beers I've had before.

I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"I have been to two Yard House restaurants this year and love this chain. Large menu, great service, and awesome happy hour specials.  

The portions are substantial and the menu has something for all tastes. I will be back....soon.  Oh by the way the beer is great too!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 3 stars because as a couple we had mix reviews. I ordered the mixed green salad and Lobster noodle. Both were delicious! Even though the greens wee not floating in dressing, I wish they put the salad dressing on the side. The Lobster noodle was filled with seafood and satisfying. We did ask for bread which was a disappointment. It was day old and room temperature. My husband ordered the French onion soup and ribeye. He enjoyed the soup. The steak was just ok. He asked for steak sauce and they didn't have any! He thought it was tough and flavorless. Service was awesome but the need to step up the main course. Not everyone wants only apps."}
{"text":"Went here for a late dinner with my boyfriend on our first night in Vegas. Glanced at the menu outside and saw everything was reasonably priced so we headed in. First thing I noticed was the HUGE selection of beers on tap. This place has a phenomenal selection of craft beers, and all the new ones I tried were delicious. 
Got the swordfish tacos for dinner. The fish and the toppings were all amazing. Honestly just no complaints about this place."}
{"text":"We go here ALL the time for happy hour, just can't find any other place that offers so much food for so little money!  Always hot and good tasting, just can't go wrong.  I recommend the spicy chicken pizza and chicken lettuce wraps.  They also serve \"meatless\" chicken, tastes just like chicken!  hee-hee."}
{"text":"Yardhouse is great. Huge selection of beers. The pizza is good. Staff is friendly at the bar. I always get the house ipa. It's good. :)"}
{"text":"You show me a person who doesn't like Yard House... I'll show you a liar.  Great location for both locals and tourists.  Obviously, the variety of beer is fantastic.  The bartenders are always super helpful in helping you match a beer with your meal, or helping you decide which beer you will enjoy.  I have also been offered samples on a few occassions, which I think is awesome!  They have great happy hour specials on both appetizers and drinks.  The outside patio is lovely during the spring and fall, inside tends to get a little loud, so the patio is great for dinner with friends.  The food is delicious.  They have a lot of options and I have not been let down once.  The staff is friendly and they generally look like they enjoy their job and work environment."}
{"text":"Just ate here two nights ago. Everyone always brags about the large beer selection that yard house has. And  they do not disappoint. Showed up with a group of five and we ordered multiple appetizers and entrees. Location has TVs all over the restaurant and no seat is a bad seat to watch a game. Sadly, I will most likely not go back unless it's just for a drink ,  due to almost everyone getting sick from under cooked food."}
{"text":"Pros: Great service, friendly staff, beer selection
Cons: Bland food
TL; DR: Don't orde the Lamb Burger

The review is solely based on having ordered the Lamb Burger, which is probably my mistake as Yard House seems like the kind of fun place to get drink, chat with stranger, and consume a ridiculous amount of sodium rich foods... not the kind of place to find well prepared non-traditional burgers. 

First off, I love lamb. It's flavor, when seasoned and cooked correctly, can transport you to food nirvana. When cooked like a generic piece of meat picked from a nondescript discount heap, is one of the saddest food experiences imaginable... and Yard House's Lamb Burger falls somewhere closer to that kind of sad experience. 

Maybe the executive chefs like bland gamey meat; or maybe the menu designer mistyped Lamb instead of Bland; who knows... the result was a seriously unimaginative experience. It literally just tasted like ground lamb meat between two pieces of bread with a minuscule amount of feta to inadequately create a mediterranean facade.

The shoestring fries were bomb. 

The beer selection is strong. 

The service was phenomenal."}
{"text":"Where do i start!
This place has over 50 beers on tap. If you came to drink, go early before rush cause you 'll end up having to stand. All that room and no where to sit. It you want to sit you have to order food. Their food is pretty good. It's bar food with a fancy twist. They have happy hour with half price food. Great chicken fingers! Their tuna sushi roll is one big roll with soy beans in it and hard to eat. Not exactly something a lady should order while sitting AT the bar lol. All in all it's a great hang out place. A bit too trendy for people like me who love dive bars. But the beers,lagers,3 different cidars on tap who can complain!?"}
{"text":"On a cold night, prior to seeing a show at the Brooklyn Bowl, my wife and I decided to pop into Yard House for some dinner.  Despite being pretty busy, we were able to get seated in a reasonable amount of time.  We got seated out on the patio area, with a heater lamp providing ample warmth.  The view was amazing.  Unfortunately, the patio hovers right above the sidewalk where everyone ducks outside to smoke.  So your meal has a tendency to be accompanied with a fair amount of second hand smoke as it all wafts up into an otherwise beautiful spot.  Yard House would be wise to ban smoking within 25 feet of their establishment. 

The prices are also outrageous, of course, because it is on the strip.

The service was awful.  We saw our server briefly as she dropped off our menus and took our drink order.  And then she disappeared.  We didn't get our drinks or see the server for close to 15 minutes after that.  This was not looking good, especially because we were trying to catch a show shortly after dinner.  When she finally returned, we were able to put in our dinner order.

I was feeling adventurous, so I decided to go with the lamb burger, despite generally not liking lamb.  I would not truly understand the depth of my folly until much later in the evening.  The food itself tasted pretty good, at the moment I ate it.  The waitress continued to disappear, so by the time we were able to get our check and get out of there, we barely made it to the show, despite having left plenty of time.

It wasn't until a couple of hours later, when we arrived home, that my stomach began its revolt.  I had made it through nearly 3 decades of existence without getting food poisoning and I had been done in by a lamb burger.  As good as that burger tasted when I ate it, it didn't taste good at all when I vomited it up several times throughout the night.  The destruction of my body lasted nearly a full day and a half, with very little sleep and whole lot of bodily functions.  The paranoia it left me with, however, didn't quite leave me.

Moral of the story?  Go to the Tilted Kilt instead.  Or literally anywhere else at the LINQ.  Because Yard House's food prep, accompanied by their prices and service, makes for one unforgettably terrible experience."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks! Loved the Hawaiian Mule, and the bartender was so friendly! Only downfall is the cell phone reception is horrible. We did wait 15 minutes past our reservation (call ahead time). Overall, I had a nice time with guests who we're visiting."}
{"text":"What bottom of the barrel ass mother fucker runs this place? The service that I received was absolutely horrible. I received two cokes one for me and one for my friend (BFF) .  We both start drinking our cokes and there is old sticky sugar on the bottom of the cup. What a disgusting place to eat. Cleanliness of this restaurant is horrid. OLD SUGAR in my cup. At least they were nice enough to give us all deserts and there was six of us. They'll never see me back here again."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's great to go for dinner and a movie. The food is upper scale bar food. And I hesitate to make reference as \"bar\" food because it really is better than that. The outdoor patio is lovely, even in the winter as they have heat lamps all over. When I go there, my friends and I usually order several different items off the appetizer menu, as they are large portions and it's great to share. I love the atmosphere and I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Tough to beat the beer selection, at least in this town.  I have never actually had an entree here, but all of the apps that I have sampled have been good quality and generally unique...On the negative side, you're going to battling a crowd most nights of the week and drinking here can get pricy in a hurry."}
{"text":"What a cool bar/restaurant. So many beers on tap to choose from. Food portions are huge. You have to get here for happy hour though as drinks are a bit pricey but would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"First review ever!!!! We come here a lot. Especially for happy hour. Came in over the weekend. It wasn't crazy busy or super slow. But I guess that's this time of year for most restaurants.  Our server was amazing. So nice and great customer service.  The food was awesome as always. The calamari here has been a big favorite of mine. Only a few disappointments. We have noticed that the managers do not wear name tags and some we've seen on their cell phones during work hours. I'm sure they do not allow that for the rest of the staff. It's that old saying what's good for the goose is good for the gander???"}
{"text":"If you go here, sit at the bar.  

I'm not saying that the service on the floor is weak, but I have had a much better time at the bar.

Late night specials are some of the best in town, and they have some great belgian brews.

Add that to a nice, hip clientele, and you've got a winner for knocking a few back."}
{"text":"I love coming here for happy hour...
I usually get the ahi sushmi, and a salad.  Its always great and then i wash it down with a different beer every time I go.  

The best part is the price though, i eat there with my husband and we usually have two bears four appetizers for around 25 dollars, you cant beat that."}
{"text":"I come here mainly for the large selection of beer. The happy hour prices are fair on both drinks and food. The portions are just right too. The service here is excellent!  As busy as it is, they're always on top of things"}
{"text":"I was hesitant at first because it looks like a typical chain style \"tap room\" sports bar place, but...Very Cool place to hang before the game when you are from out of town. Server was awesome, beer was a bit slow to arrive but the server kept us informed...It was SUPER busy...I had a Cuban pork dip sandwich.....IT WAS excellent!

Don't hesitate...Go in!"}
{"text":"Great food, service, people and environment. Conveniently located at Red Rock Casino, this location is spot on and is always fun to visit.  Menu is great for food and drinks. During dinner times in the late afternoon or evening is when this place comes alive. Check it out, better than other locations."}
{"text":"The waitress was very nice but forgot an order of spinach and artichoke dip. The bus boy came by and asked if everything was okay and we let him know that an appetizer was ordered and never came. He went to check on it and never came back. Then when our main entrees were brought out our waitress noticed that the dip never came. She asked if we still wanted it. I told her yes and then we finally received it after our main entrees were finished and the table was cleared. She apologized again and left without leaving us with any plates or silverware or napkins. I had expected her to take it off of our bill but she left it on. I realize that things happen and so I have to give it a 2 star despite a terrible service experience."}
{"text":"Great happy hour, , tasty appetizers, Huge beer selection, And the Best damn pastrami sandwich I have had in years. Go here eat and by happy !!!"}
{"text":"We stopped by for some lunch and were pleased to find that Monday is 3:00 to close happy hour!  We had very good lettuce wraps with 3 good sauces. More lettuce leaves would be a suggestion but all else was good. The boneless wings had good spice and there were plenty for the price. I had a half yard beer which came in a silly glass.  Personal preference."}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour!

Our party of four took a short cab ride from the strip to check out their happy hour and were not disappointed. They had a great selection of beer and all of the half price apps we got (Chinese garlic noodles, artichoke dip, buffalo wings, nachos, pizza) were both large in size and and very tasty. Our server was friendly and fast! We will be back here for happy hour again on our next Vegas trip :)"}
{"text":"This is our 'go to' spot! The food and drinks never disappoint! The Brussel sprouts and the mac n cheese are our favorites! The staff is always friendly! It was the first place I tried a Moscow Mule and it rocks!"}
{"text":"What can I say.. Fabulous food!  Fantastic beer!  Wonderful wait staff:-). Clean and very friendly. The best part is that the food is superb.  I had the Porcini crusted Halibut with Parmesan mashed potatoes accompanied by asparagus and fennel tossed in white truffle oil. All of this was placed on a bed of porcini mushroom sauce.  I am in heaven. Sent from my wife - the keeper of all things associated with my happiness!"}
{"text":"I had the vodka angelhair pasta it was yummy even Carmel icecream was even better lol"}
{"text":"Always love their food esp. the ahi crunchy salad and guacamole and chips.  Their lite lemon drop is stellar every time.  Great place to watch the BlackHawks games or any other sporting event.  

Great pre-movie treat and their beer selection is great from what i understand from my beer drinking friends.   I always try to take my out of town friends here for delicious mid priced local chain!"}
{"text":"OMG?Everything was just amazing tonight and good service?love California roll?This Las Vegas Yard House can be a must come restaurant?"}
{"text":"The menu is extensive and some original and tasty sounding options.  We were staying at Marriott Canyon Villas and it was a nice stroll to get an early dinner.  Because it was before 5:00 I could order from the lunch menu and the portion was perfect.  I had a choice of salad which was very fresh greens.  Great selection of craft beers too."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday with my boyfriend and sad to say, we weren't all that impressed with the service. The food was great, don't get me wrong! But the service was terrible. We came here on a Friday a little before noon, and got seated immediately. Our waitress, Emmie, came to greet us as we were seated and took our drink orders. However, it took about 10 minutes before our drinks came to us. 10 minutes to get our drinks! How ridiculous is that? We eventually got our orders placed, which was the Lobster, Crab & Artichoke dip for our appetizer to share, the Grilled Korean Pork Belly Street Tacos for me and the Asada Street Tacos for my boyfriend. 

It took a good 30-45 minutes before our food came out, and by that time, my drink was running low. I had placed my empty glass at the end of the table in hopes somebody would come up and offer to give me a refill, but that didn't happen. We were seated in a booth close to the kitchen, numerous employees had passed by our table, so it's not like we were hidden. But they just passed by our table, overlooking my empty glass. Emmie finally took notice (she seemed very oblivious, not good work ethic!) and gave me a refill, apologizing that their computers were down and the food orders were backed up. We could understand that our food might take a while, but getting a drink refilled? Again, absolutely ridiculous. Eventually, all our food came out...including the appetizer that we specifically asked to be brought out first before our main dishes. Thankfully, the food looked delicious to make up slightly for this.

The Lobster, Crab & Artichoke dip was DELICIOUS. It came with pieces of pita bread and chips, and I really liked it with the pita bread. We both really enjoyed the dip, we just wished it came out before the main dishes did. The tacos were phenomenal. My boyfriend enjoyed his Asada tacos (I had a bite and they were quite tasty!) and my Grilled Korean Pork Belly tacos were nothing short of awesome. Each taco dish came with 2 tacos, a scoop of their spicy rice, and a small bowl of beans. The meat in both tacos were cooked to perfection, not too much that it had a charred taste. The rice was alright, the beans could have been better. 

By the end of our meal, we both had empty glasses (received no offer on refills, what is up with this place and getting drinks??) and we waited about 10 minutes to get the check. Overall, I'd say the food rocked more than the service did!!"}
{"text":"The Yard House has a very large beer selection, which is great!  Their food is also pretty good. What I really love is the environment of this place. It is big and spacious, and the booths are large. I"}
{"text":"Brad is always our bartender and is always informative and friendly... He takes care of everyone like they are his only patrons, but does it all so efficiently u don't notice he's busy..."}
{"text":"Oh Yard House. You're one of my favorite restaurants in town. Great beer. Great food. Great service. And you're one of the rare places in Las Vegas that has my favorite beer. Alas, my last two visits to your restaurant had been less than stellar. How very disappointing. 

A few weeks ago, your zealous bus boy cleared my food from my table when I accompanied my child to the bathroom. That was somewhat annoying but forgivable - after all you've always been very efficient with your service. And you made good on our food with new plates of food very promptly. Thank you. I appreciated that. I just wish you could be more prompt with your bathroom clean up. 

Then yesterday, my child and I headed to your restaurant again to get a quick bite before our movie. Service was great, your wait staff is fantastic. But I can't say the same about your dishwashing staff. There was an awful lot of somebody else's lipstick on the glass you served me. That was an appetite killer. My inner germaphobe had a mini freak out moment. See picture. There's no excuse for that.

All that said, I still like you. You have nice people and good food. I'll just have to check my glass and guard my food more closely when I next dine at your place."}
{"text":"The beer selection is out of this world!   Unlimited possibilities.   Friendly servers, nice atmosphere.   Hit up the happy hour its the way to go.  Great food deals.  I tried the California sushi roll it comes layered which is different.  Everything tasted very fresh and delicious.  Also tried the onion rings with a smokey chipotle ranch.  Onion rings were crispy and delicious!  Next time I go definitely trying the pizza and wings they looked really good."}
{"text":"Not bad, not great, what you expect from a chain. My date loves the chicken lettuce wraps, it was good and comes with 3 sauces. I liked them too. Our waiter was great and was attentive and gave me great recommendation in trying a new lager. They do have a great selection of beer and alcohol. The low rating is price, to expensive for what it is, but again chain pricing, support your local food joints who offer good pricing and quality."}
{"text":"Love this place, beers are always awesome and food is pretty good . Lobster spinach dip is the business"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is really on the loud side.
called ahead for seating and got right in, was a very busy night.
have been here before and liked the food just fine, but last night I had the turkey pot pie witch is very large and could certainly feed two people, tasted ok, except for the onions were over powering, and I was throwing it up a few hours later.    Felt much better, after throwing up. (Didn't have any alcohol.)"}
{"text":"Amazing Beer selection! Try the Peroni on tap! Good service too! Always busy after work and weekends though!"}
{"text":"Not bad food as chain restaurants go but not great.  The big problem is their policy or staff; often rude and will take your credit card or in my case ATM Debit Card and refuse to give it back untill you finish.  I asked for it back several times and told them I would be paying in cash but they still refused until I settled by order for one beer.
Never had this happen in any restaurant in my life.  The host said that it is just a problem with their clientele; if that is the level of clientele at RR Casino or their place I do not wish to return.

Be careful or just give them a card to hold that has a very low limit or better just avoid such places.

Food is just OK and there are many better places in the area but unfortunately they are not in RR Casino."}
{"text":"This place left a very sour taste in my mouth. We got in there and the staff at the bar was rude. And the manager was not so nice considering my husband is older and looks older and they refused to serve him a beer on his bday none the less give us a problem for sitting at the bar (trust me when i say he does not look young) and the guy they served next to us wasnt even asked for his ID. my husband does have an accent so maybe they were being somewhat racist. also when we were seated at the table, they kept looking looking at us and talking (workers at the bar). we waited a while at the table and just ended up leaving bec a waiter didnt come within the 10 minutes we were sitting there. I will not be coming back after that experience for sure. i totally do not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"The waiter was not friendly nor cared to talk much when we asked about items on the menu. Our food came to us cold, we even ordered a hot coffee and that came cold. We didn't complain but I made damn sure I let people know this is not a good restaurant. Please don't waste your money or time in this place."}
{"text":"Went during Happy Hour.  Very good Bloody Mary.  Blue Crab Cakes, just OK.  I'm not so sure they weren't frozen then deep fried.   Chicken strips were very good, and not greasy.  Onion ring tower...
very nice sized portion, and with a slightly \"different\" and nice tasting batter.  Only problem...
much too greasy."}
{"text":"Pretty good place for happy hour. Amazing range of beer on tap. if you can get served.

Twice now I've gone here and was told it's a 15 minute wait. After an hour we still hadn't been paged. Last time I did go there and actually got seated was before a Coyotes game. We got our drink and ordered an appetizer then never saw our server again. We tried to flag him down several times and he would go to the table next to us and quickly turn the other way. 

Also kind of pricey for the food that is fairly standard fair."}
{"text":"Great beer and good food. The staff was very helpful with food and beverage selection , plenty of choices."}
{"text":"Fun place for dinner or happy hour. Really helpful waitress suggested beers we might like to try based on what we told get were our current favorites. Delicious food."}
{"text":"WE had a great meal at Yard House.  Quick and friendly service and wonderful food with very large portions.  Loved the LINQ area where the restaurant is located. Very extensive menu with just about anything you could ask for.  We will return and we highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Wide beer selection, but not a lot of rare/unique ones. Good food, but overpriced. No sound for NFL games was kind of a bummer."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, and the staff friendly and efficient. A great place to stop at and eat at a reasonable prince. The drink options were awesome also, to be expected of course."}
{"text":"Great beer, wonderful food, plenty of seating. They even have a wide variety on their menu. Would highly recommend"}
{"text":"Best experience! Our waitress was very upbeat and friendly. The food was the best compared to other locations. Calamari was big and tasty! Onion ring tower was delicious!"}
{"text":"Thank you Red Rock for the addition of this restaurant.  The food is consistently good, and the service it top notch.  I've only been here twice (and I think twice at the town square location) but each time was excellent.  I'm not a huge sports fan, however I've noticed that this is a great place to catch the big game! Many many tables and enthusiastic sports fanatics...

Back to the food! I love the truffle fries.  Love them! The desserts are huge enough to share with more than one person.  Clam Chowder is greattt! Salads are amazing.  I can't think of everything I've eaten here, but I know that its always been great.  I think I could try everything on the menu and like it.  Ohh I had a raspberry beer once, that was good! Excellent food, excellent service, excellent atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I went here yesterday and found it excellent. The staff were diligent and polite. I ordered the New York Steak Sandwich; it was delicious and cooked to perfection. I get thirsty while I eat and drain my glass quickly and was pleasantly surprised to find that the staff noticed and kept up on refills without me needing to signal. I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Bomb Happy Hour! Decent prices for drinks, tons of half off appetizers and pizzas too! I highly recommend the BBQ pizza without cilantro or the ahi sliders... Add a half yard of beer and it becomes the perfect meal!

The yard house in San Diego is equally delicious. Definitely a great chain that had high quality food with a fantastic beer selection."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, and the service has always been decent to good. The food is pretty pricey but I've only ever felt the dish wasn't worth the cost a time or two, generally it's very good. Weekend evenings are always packed so expect a wait.

The inside is a great atmosphere for watching a game, and the outside(on a nice day/night) is great for a conversation."}
{"text":"The Yard House at Town Square is one of my favorite places for lunch or happy hour.  I like the large beer selection and all the menu items too.  My favorites are the double mac n cheese and the street tacos.  The burgers are very good too.  The staff is always awesome very friendly and take the time to really provide good customer service even though they are really busy.  I never feel rushed there.  It doesn't matter if its dining for two or twenty the service is always the same.  definitely a thumbs up in my book."}
{"text":"Yardhouse - big fan of their happy hour.  Happy hour ends unusually early (6pm), but is a decent place to grab a bite to eat and drink.  We typically don't frequent Yardhouse outside of happy hour because it is pricey.  The food is good, nothing amazing.  The beer selection is great.  Service has always been good.  A good solid place for HH."}
{"text":"After a terrible experience at another bar earlier yesterday evening I was still craving good beer so I came here. I always know what I'm getting at Yardhouse. Food is good beers are plentiful and I always love the non smoking environment. Good job guys!"}
{"text":"To keep it short and sweet...

I live in the area (for over 10 years) and eat out all of the time.... Busy schedule, always with clients and I can comfortably take any of my clients here. From the t-shirt tech guy to the established elitist.... there is something there for them.

I've been everywhere in Summerlin and for price, service, an extensive menu and overall consistency -- Yard House is the best place to go without having to break the bank.

The food is always good.... the service is always great. From Business Lunches to Late Night Debauchery -- we always have a good time.

The only thing I can think of complaining about after 20+ visits is that sometimes it gets really, really busy and the wait for a table or to even find a couple of places at the bar can be long.... but that's certainly not Yard House's fault. (Open up another one in Summerlin!)

An obvious sign of success that some certain other places in the area should take notice of to step up their standards of providing quality food, great service and a great atmosphere for a great price.


- Cheers!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Yard House a few time but this was the first time since I found out that the menu offered Gardein selections.  I'll breakdown our experience chronologically for fun.  We were seated and given our HUGE menus.  Seriously, they are huge, the size of a photo book, half of it listing the drinks.  We carefully reviewed the Gardein and other vegetarian and vegan options before I decided on the Firecracker Gardein Buffalo Wings and an order of Truffle Fries minus the Parmesan.  BF ordered the vegetarian mushroom and pepper street taco plater.  I ordered their house Blonde and he ordered the Sam Adams Octoberfest beer.

Beverages were delivered right away, but his was not correct.  A few minutes to get our server's attention for a correction but soon enough, the Octoberfest made its way to the table.  Shortly after that, the Buffalo Wings, Street Tacos & Truffle Fries are delivered and we are both dissappointed (but not surprised) by the small size of portions verses the large prices charged for them.  

Truffle Fries - pretty good.  Served warm, nice seasoning, small hint of truffle oil and without the Parmesan as requested.
Tacos - okay.  A few vegetables grilled on a flat top served on a 4 or 5 inch corn tortilla (seriously the smallest at the grocery store is 6 inches, can't that be the normal?) sloppily sprinkled with queso fresco.  Served with a scoop of rice that appeared to be seasoned but tasted blah and a small dish of undrained pinto beans topped with cheese.  Save the additional $2 or $3 dollars for the rice & beans and order the tacos ala carte.
Buffalo Wings - fried goodness.  The coating was a nice balance to the chick'n inside and the sauce was flavorful.  Although, I'm not positive that I had the Firecracker sauce, rather than just a sweet tasting one.  It was not spicy at all.  

Our server stepped away on break, but introduced us to her colleague but then we got thirsty.  Beverages were empty, several sightings of replacement server without inquiry about another round.  Stopped eating food so we could order another beverage but it took several more minutes.  Received another round, but wanted to get the check since the food prices were high and the beers were $6.50 each!  Can't afford to stay too long on those prices.  The check had the incorrect beer on it plus the 2 we each consumed.  Flagged down our server, and before I could say anything about the check, beer, extra charge, etc., she made mention of the extra beer and went to correct the check.  So...is that standard practice?  Not to remove a mistake and hope the guest does not review the bill?  Maybe she was psychic?  Sketchy.

$55.08 plus tip and that was all our wallets could stand.  Even if we never return I do not expect the Yard House's bottom line to be hurt, The place was super busy and was not slowing down as it approached dinner time."}
{"text":"The kitchen messed up my order. The manager came by and said he was sorry. My wife had to eat alone while they remade my order. The remake took so long that I had to eat alone once my order finally came. Still charged full price for the entire meal. I guess the \"sorry\" was all that I got for having to eat alone."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. I honestly only go during their happy hour times. The portions are great. I always order their Thai Chicken Pizza with an Passion Iced Tea. Very clean restaurant. They've got two floors with an outside patio. It's very relaxed for being located within the strip. Also located right next to the parking structure for the Linq."}
{"text":"Normally good and consistent with food and service, but last night was a disappointment. I'm shocked by the high volume of people who go through the restaurant that their bathrooms were in bad shape. If that is how their bathrooms look, I hate to see how they manage the kitchen."}
{"text":"We are frequent visitors to Yardhouse.  We began going to the Long Beach location when they opened and have been loyal customers ever since.  We love the beer selection and the food is great but we go because of the awesome service.  We recently went to the LINQ location off the strip and were blown away.  Ali and Joshua made our day.  It was the last day of our trip and they made it amazing.  They made us feel right at home, suggested local brews, and kept us happy and engaged.  It may seem silly that a lunch can make your day but truly, they made ours.  With all the selections in vegas often with rude and disinterested wait staff this Yardhouse blows them all away.  If you want a near endless beer selection, great food  with a huge menu, and seriously unmatched service head to Yardhouse at the LINQ."}
{"text":"My office is close to this location so we eat here a lot.  I eat a lot of steak.  I love the pepper crusted filet.  It ranks up there with some of the best steaks in town.  Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"Ate there last week, kind of high priced for the fare we ordered. I had the petite steak, they were right. Did not mind the small steak, but the sides were small & not creative, should have a potato, steamed veggies, or brown rice, for this dish."}
{"text":"A very long wait on a Friday evening...but they more than made up for that with the service, delicious food and complementary appetizer."}
{"text":"Standard Yard House. Nothing is great, but there's a lot of decent food. Food always seemed to take forever coming out."}
{"text":"I love this place so much!!!
It not just because of beer but food is amazing too!
As others know and they are known for huge collection of beer, in fact, it is hard to choose which one I am going to have. But thanksfully they organized beer as beer style on the menu so it makes much easier to pick. Server was friendly and suggested some beer when I asked.
Food was great even it was on happy hour but took some time to bring it. 
This place is always busy i guess because of location."}
{"text":"This place was so good! We came with friends and everything we ordered was fantastic. And the prices were not bad either considering it's vegas. I had the spicy avocado roll- omg so good. It was so well seasoned I didn't need to add anything else onto it and the portions was enough for me to make this my meal even tho it was an appetizer! We also had the trip dessert and the peach apple pie with salted caramel ice cream on top was to die for. And let me tell you I'm not even a pie fan. My husband got the beer flight and all of them except one (sour beers which is not our preference anyways) was all exceptionally good. We would be so happy to come back again. And our service was kind, funny, and very attentive."}
{"text":"I like yardhouse. It's one of the few chains that almost never gets old. At the very worst there is always a new beer to try. The food is so-so; good for a chain, but that's not the reason anyone is going to yardhouse. The beer selection is excellent and the service is usually above average."}
{"text":"Nice place....patio seating is refreshing...as always beers here are awesome. Do try belgium hendrick ...thats a one devil beer :)(11%)"}
{"text":"Mac N Cheese was awesome! Ernestine was amazing!!! 120+ beers on tap, kilt lifter was very good, dined outside with perfect weather!"}
{"text":"I'm a big yard house fan, whenever there is family or friends that come into town this is where I take them.. Lots, I mean lots of different beer selections on top of cocktails, wine and sake!!! The food is awesome as well. Ahi crunchy salad is one of my faves as well as the southern fried chicken. But this location is the best only because it has two stories and you can sit outside on the patio and enjoy the high roller. Especially at night when it's all lit up. Service is exceptional, everyone is helping each other out and they are super friendly."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed about my experience at this location. I normally like eating yard house. It took our server awhile to greet our table  and then it took another 10 mins for us to get our beers. The food came out pretty fast so no complaints there. My party didn't like the rice that came with their tacos. I'll prolly go to the location closer to my house from now on."}
{"text":"Exceptional menu. Exceptional food (fantastic onion soup) from entree to sides to sliders; the beer list is extraordinary and a great staff! You should not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been to Yard House a couple of times and I've always had great service and great food. The chicken tortilla soup is sooo so good."}
{"text":"Cant complain about a thing here.  We were treated very well by all the staff and the food was very good.  The atmosphere is nice.  The Movie theater is next door.  We took the bus from the strip for dinner and a movie and very glad we did.  The area is very nice with lots of shops.  A nice break from the chaos and prices on the strip.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I came for lunch with a friend and we sat at the bar. Taylor the bartender was the worst bartender I've ever encountered! My friend ordered a beer I asked if I could get a sample of that same beer. She said okay and came back with 1 full glass and said you can just sample out of hers! Seriously! who says that? I ordered my beverage she gave it to me and walked away.. And never came back we sat there for 15 minutes until someone else acknowledged us and took our order. When I asked for my check she still wasn't very friendly and just had this worst attitude. I had the happy hour noodles! It was absolutely ridiculously delicious! For being something so simple and great portion size too! At least my food made up for the lack of service I got."}
{"text":"I had guest we went to Yard House for lunch every thing was excellent the food and the service my guests enjoyed them selves. We had a great time. 
I've been there many times every time was good except one time I was really disappointed but now because every thing is good I will be back again. I highly recommend Yard House in Red rock."}
{"text":"The service was good. Presentation was good. Food quality was great, and had a wide selection. Loud environment and can be very busy when the stadium next door is busy.

My food was perfect (oredered a pizza). One member of our party ordered medium steak that arrived cold and extremely rare. They took it back and cooked the same steak a little more, and put it back on the same plate and brought it back out. We were about all done eating when she got her steak back. Bummer.

Three of us (party of 7) had to go to the bathroom on the way home from the meal...they must use some ingredients that we aren't use to eating."}
{"text":"WOW, I cannot believe the great service and attention that our group of 45 plus family members received from this Yardhouse and our sever, Kerry, in particular.  They accommodated our ever growing group with smiles and charm and made us all feel welcomed.  The food was great, the portions more than amble and arrived for all of us at just about the same time!  Kudos again to  Kerry and all the Yardhouse staff here!"}
{"text":"Good food, amazing beer selection, very pricey that's for sure. But very nice, specially if you want a fun environment. Service is good. But they served me raw shrimp and raw burger before, so I only go there when they are not busy. Happy hour is the best."}
{"text":"This place is great. Menu is great, and food is always very fresh. They have very big portions, but they are a little pricey. A favorite."}
{"text":"One of my favorite bar-restaurant! Amazing food with so many choices to choose from! I have tried soo much on the menu and loved all of it! The tortilla soup here has to be the best I've ever had anywhere!"}
{"text":"Want to lose a few pounds? Eat at Yard House! Order the swordfish tacos or the chicken nachos and you will get an ample case of food poisoning. I ate there last night with some friends. Two of us ordered the swordfish tacos, and lucky us, we were both hugging the toilet all night long. Recently a close friend had a similar experience after munching on their chicken nachos. You know, we put our faith in the kitchen staff to keep us safe and healthy. This is absolutely unacceptable. I will not be returning to this establishment, and neither will anyone in our party. You have to do better than this Yard House."}
{"text":"ok the food and the drinks totally rock there! The servers and the floor staff were friendly and accomodating. One of the bartenders needs an attitude adjustment but other than that it was fun and the pasta was to die for! I will totally eat and drink there again it was really yummy."}
{"text":"I've been to this place several times now, for dinner and just for drinks, and my overall impression is: overpriced.  If you are just going out for some drinks and to watch a game, this isn't the place... not for $7 a beer.  Happy hour is the only time I will grab a beer here.... I know, I know, they have 100 some beers on tap, but in most cases I can drive to BevMo and buy a six pack just a cheap.

Now, the food is good, the beer is cold, so that's worth three stars at least... but I wouldn't take a first date here (a meal and drinks can run you $100 easy... I'm not putting that much into someone I may never see again) or just meet and hang out with friends.  Hey maybe that's just me.  It's worth checking out, if you have a lot of money sitting around."}
{"text":"My husband and I came for happy hour and we loved it here!  We got the moo shu egg rolls and they were delicious. Not your typical egg roll which made them even more tasty. Beer selection is amazing and staff is friendly. Can't ask for a better experience. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"(4.5 Stars): The ambience of Yard House reminds me of Gordon Biersch. This restaurant, however, had MANY more food options to choose from. I was so overwhelmed that they have over a hundred different kinds of beer (I enjoyed the Green Flash West Coast IPA from San Diego). The food portions are enormous and rich in flavor. The service has also been superb and attentive. Every time I visit Vegas, Yard House has been a stop and I plan to continue that tradition for years to come!"}
{"text":"It's chain restaurant, which I generally eschew in favor local businesses.  But close to where my friends office is so we meet there for drinks and snacks.  I've not had a dinner here at Desert Ridge, I ate a Yard House in California and. In Vegas for business dinners with groups.   and it was like driving a nice Honda Accord, not a bad ride, but not a BMW experience.  They are a chain and have a business model  not like local owners who live and thrive on making the folks happy because it's their living, not a job.   But enough about shop local.

  I suppose if you like the yard house in Arizona you will like them in their dozens of restaurants across the country.  They are kind of like OliveGarden on steroids.  If I took my wife there for our anniversary she would melt down,and divorce me. I mean, if I had a wife.   I basing this on former wives 

But Now the GREAT  thing about the yard house, at least happy hour.... They have some  gardein  vegan options which I like. And my friend who is a carnivore always is amazed how good they taste.  \"Wow,  this tastes like chicken!\"  

So kudos for Yard House realizing there is a market for vegetarians and vegans to enjoy some food with their beer 

Good place to meet after work and choose from dozens of beers on tap.  And vegan options!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. We celebrated a friends birthday. The truffle fries and chicken sandwich were excellent. Staff was attentive and prompt."}
{"text":"Just left Yard House and well it was ok. The wait was short. The waitress took a while so anorther waiter decided to step in after we waited 10 minutes and from there it was going good. Our food comes out and I have all of mine but my wife was missing her french fries. We waited 5min and a manager walked by so I asked him if it was normal for this to happen and he said no gave an excuse and the next thing you know she has fries. I had the steak sandwich medium and my wife had the original cheese burger."}
{"text":"I went here for a work event one time. Was a pretty good experience. The waitress was very friendly and knowledgeable (her name was Acacia in case someone reads this give her credit). This place has a great beer selection and carry one of my favorites (Left Hand Brewery Milk Stout). The appetizers and desserts were very good. I had the creme brulee, at the waitresses recommendation and it complimented my beer perfectly. Definitely worth checking out. Was very well made. Also another good beer to try here is the Young's Double Chocolate Stout, was pretty solid. Only downside i could see for some people is the pricing for drinks could add up quick, however i don't so much mind paying a higher price for a good brew and nice environment."}
{"text":"We went back again and the food was pretty good but I have to admit I'm pretty disappointed in the menu change. We've always wanted to try the chicken pot pie since everyone we know raved about it only to find out it was no longer offered. They did have a new salted caramel dessert that was extremely good though."}
{"text":"Our service was ok compared t oother yard house locations. was there this sunday (3/20/11, lunch time). food was great and service was good."}
{"text":"It was about an hour wait to get a table on a Friday night but that's understandable being a new place to the area. I like how they have plenty of beer to choose from which makes the wait pretty easy. Our waiter was outstanding and the food was equal. Highly recommend the egg rolls for a starter!!!"}
{"text":"We chose Yard House because it was open late and had good reviews. It didn't disappoint. 

The hot & spicy edamame was amazing! For my entree I had the tacos (carne asada and baja fish), which were very good. Overall, the food was good, but not quite good enough to justify the price.

More than the food, our waiter, Trej, was awesome. He was very attentive and gave us everything we needed."}
{"text":"Everything was real good. service and food great. Really becoming a fan of their food and great beer selection. Wish they would of came to Crocker park sooner!"}
{"text":"Oh yea, celebrated a few anniversaries and birthdays at this place. Good times, good food and great memories!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and every dish I've order was delicious. I highly recommend either of the salmon entree's and the fried macaroni and cheese!"}
{"text":"Wow we have had an excellent dinner at the yard house. Prices are good and the atmosphere and service is great. Worth checking out, you wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We went in one night for some drinks and we were greeted within seconds of sitting down. The bartender was very polite and informative about beer. He let us try a pineapple cider which was delicious! I haven't eaten there yet but next time we do I will for sure try at least an appetizer! Great service!"}
{"text":"Great place to come with friends and dates!The atmosphere is very laid back and comfortable.  Its okay for family as well during the day, the menu offers a lot, even for kids.
Service was fast and attentive, and easy to talk to. Very helpful in suggesting things, and just adding on to the dining experience.
They have plenty of seating options and a bar, as well as a amazing and vast beer selection, give it a go when you come!;)
Menu had a little bit of everything from american food to Asian food, lots of fusion dishes, and its never...should I say, typical! There's always a nice twist to the food they have here. Portions are very decent and \"share-able\". They have a happy hour too, which you should check out if your a night owl.
I will definitely be coming back :)!"}
{"text":"Worth the wait if you want a nice full service meal at Westgate Center. Main dining room near the bar is noisy but we managed to get a booth in the back where its quieter. Outside seating is a nice option too. Wait staff was friendly and attentive. Large menu. I thoroughly enjoyed the porcini dusted halibut, the cream sauce was delicious and the portions generous. Others in my party enjoyed the Kale Caesar and French Dip. Unfortunately, we were too full to try the delicious sounding desserts, maybe another time."}
{"text":"Fantastic selection! So many beers to choose from and fantastic food choices. I went with a couple friends and the atmosphere is very welcoming and the waiters are always friendly. I was told about their Mac + Cheese2 and it was just as good as I was promised. I look forward to going back and trying out the rest of their selection."}
{"text":"Brian was very nice and the food is always good.  I recommend the grilled cheese with tomato bisque."}
{"text":"Huge selection of beer. The hambugers are really good and the nachos were outstanding. Service is good. The club type atmosphere doesn't go well with a burger and a beer."}
{"text":"Um, why have I not been here until now? I absolutely enjoyed everything about this restaurant.  The food was delicious service was good as well. The bathroom was very clean too. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The experience I had was really a mixed bag. We had a business meeting planned so we called the night before and set up reservations. I was standing next to my assistant when she called to make the reservation and also when she called back to confirm the reservation. When I arrived the person at the desk said there wasn't a reservation. With the line I expected a long wait, which was especially frustrating because people drove over an hour to arrive for a very important meeting. 
The staff was able to seat us relatively quickly. We ordered appetizers, both of which I would say were pretty good. I ordered a Caesar salad and a burger. The Caesar salad was a bit above average but I'd have to say the burger was below average. I've had the same one (pepper crusted Gorgonzola) at other Yardhouse locations and they were great but this one just seemed a little off. Also, one of our members of the party started to have an allergic reaction to the food he ordered which is never pleasant for anyone, thankfully it was relatively mild.
Maybe it was just a bad night since I've had some great food from this chain at other locations. At least I hope that was the case."}
{"text":"I had very little time and no clue what to get.  Nikki M. Helped me calm the heck down and choose. LOL. Really she was so welcoming and knowledgeable about the menu and cocktail menu more importantly!!  After a quick stop I feel like a new woman. Thanks Nikki M. You made my day!!"}
{"text":"First of all the Macadamia nut crusted Mahi Mahi with the spicy rice is one of my all time favorite meals. The service here is always excellent. The manager with the wild mustache is very polite and courteous. Jocelyn the bartender is a master at her craft. The music selection is very unique and sets the mood for good food, cold beer and fun. As for the prices, what can I say, I pay $4.00 for a gallon of gas. So of course I'll pay $7.00 for 12 ounces of imported beer. Especially if it's served with a smile."}
{"text":"Nice place- a huge number of beers on tap and our food was better than the brewpub norm. Nice menu selection and super friendly staff. Definitely a great, relaxing place to catch a game or have a beer."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner our last night in Vegas...wish we would have come sooner!  I had the surf and turf burger which was cooked perfectly.  Definitely recommend the truffle fries and the made-from- scratch clam chowder. Our server Rosie was awesome :-)"}
{"text":"Outdoor atmosphere is great.  It was pretty busy, but we got seated pretty quickly.  The food was good and choice of beers great!  I would go here often just to try the different brews.  We were able to watch a few games on the TV's and still talk."}
{"text":"i love me some yars house happy hour. not for drinking but for the half priced food! ~$5 for chicken nachos! how wonderful. and the fried calamari! love it! i came here 2 days in a row and veronica the hostess remembered me, sorta embarrassing. the sliders are okay, garlic fries dont have enough garlic. jambalaya was really good. 
for a whole lotta happy hour food the bill was about 30ish which isnt too bad since i was 100% full.
not full enough to skip yogurtland though.... 
i prefer to sit in the booths and the hostess put us in one even though i saw 3 big women sitting at a table (they obviously needed the booth space).
so A+ for yardhouse
i come here everytime im in vegas"}
{"text":"Great place to stop in to have a bite to eat before a game or concert.  You will need to show up early though if there are special engagements going, it gets packed!  Fun place to be for a date night as well."}
{"text":"You know that feeling when you can't wait to get out of a restaurant? 

That's how my husband and I felt tonight after deciding on the Yard House...

It just started bad and stayed there. We walked up to the front to see about getting a seat and the girl asked if we would like patio seating or indoor. Innocently I asked, \"Where is the patio?\" 
(I was concerned it would be facing the parking lot or somewhere unappealing) and her response was, \"It's outside.\" In a \"duh\" kind of way. Thanks for treating me that way 30 seconds into being in the restaurant :/ 

Once OUTSIDE on the PATIO, our waitress took a long time to take our order, never remembered to refill any water or drinks, and we had to ask to have our appetizer dishes moved.  

Oh, about the food... Sorry, I was so distracted by the poor service... It was just okay. Hubby got some mushroom burger that was okay... And I had the Thai chicken noodle salad that was fine. 

So that was our experience... If you are wondering where the 2 stars come from, they have good fries. I really liked the fries..."}
{"text":"I love the food and drinks here. It is also really nice to eat outside when the weather is warm. Every time I am in Vegas I try to eat here at least once. I don't think I have ever been served something I didn't like at this restaurant. If you have never been, stop by for Happy Hour and try a few different things at a big discount."}
{"text":"We ate at the Yard House earlier today.    TVs would be showing sports, but it's more of a fine dining restaurant.  The menu is very extensive all at reasonable prices.   As a side to our meals, we tried their sweet fries with maple cream and bacon dipping sauce.  OMG!  That dipping sauce absolutely floored us!  It was a HUGE surprise!  It's a MUST TRY!!"}
{"text":"This place rocks, great beer and complete drink menu, incredible food selection, everything is good.  Staff is good. Reasonably priced.  Love the Cuban and wings."}
{"text":"I've been here twice over the past 3 months, first trip 5 stars, second 3 stars, average 4 stars.  The atmosphere is really inviting, great for groups and reflective of what a tap house should be.

First trip I ordered the half order jambalaya, second trip the seared ahi tuna sandwich on rye.  

It's hard to make a good jambalaya that isn't too salty, most are, and the YH hit it on the head.  The shrimp were large, and sat on top a cup plateau of rice, with the chicken, crawfish, and sausage in a moat of spicy cream sauce around.  Some of the best jambalaya I've had and would certainly order again.

The second round was the ahi tuna sandwich.  I was a little suspect out the gate with it coming on rye, but had a little trust from the last trip and how great the jambalaya was.  As the plate sat down, I could tell the ahi tuna was not seared to rare, but more of a medium well, cooked white with only traces of pink, bummer.  Hoping the toasted rye bread would compliment the meat and somewhat pickup where it left off, it didn't, and just made the sandwich more difficult to handle, literally.  On the upside, the peppercorn aioli and caramelized onions saved the sandwich from a certain fate in the back kitchen's garbage can.  Normally, I would have sent it back, but I was with my boss for dinner and decided to suck it up rather than act like a food snob for \"overcooking cooking my ahi tuna\", not a good look.

This place is pricey, perhaps over priced in some respect, but if they can pull off all their dishes as well as they did the jambalaya, I'll come back for not just the beer."}
{"text":"Not a lot of food for the money. Definitely overpriced. About the same quality as Applebees, maybe. Service is spotty, but generally OK."}
{"text":"What a bunch of crap! You can't bring an outside drink in and it's located off the strip?! Food is mediocre and expensive. I would pass"}
{"text":"Great food here and great staff defiantly recommend. If your looking for a high end restaurant this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Been here several times as I'm an out of towner here on a long term project. The food is great and the beer list is phenomenal. 

The bar service has always been poor, but I always figured it was because of how busy they were being a newer establishment to Crocker Park. However, the last time I went was a calm Tuesday night and I had the worst service at the bar I've ever had. The bartender named Kevin was oblivious to anyone that wasn't a female at the bar."}
{"text":"Never been a huge fan of their food but the staff at the new location is awesome.  Tim (I believe that was his name) was fast and informative about any beer questions we had.  This is going to be one of the busiest patios for sure this summer."}
{"text":"I loveeee this place!! I just cant seem to get enough!! I love the beer selection!!!"}
{"text":"There's like 173994718294 beers on tap and the happy hour is good. Plus lots of vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Truffle Burger is the best burger in the planet. Beer list is impressive. Awesome. Service was great. My go to Vegas spot when I don't want to spend an hour parking and want great food and great beer."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick beer. After finishing my usual beer the bartender recommended something off there limited menu, it wasn't my kind of beer so he exchanged it for something else. Friendly service for sure. Will always return for there large selection of draft beer."}
{"text":"Love yardhouse, always have. I have always liked the huge selection of beers on tap. You can find different beers from all over the country and sometimes internationally too. There a few yardhouse locations across the valley so finding one close to wherever you are should not be an issue at all.

Do yourself a favor and drink something besides a typical bud or you coors, and try a draft beer from a craft brewery. I mean do you really enjoy drinking the same old boring thing time and time again...."}
{"text":"First off I hardly ever and I mean ever give 5 stars but I will give a solid 4 to yard house. C'mon a hundred beers on tap. Can't go wrong with that. 

The beer menu is excellent. Lots of good selections of craft beer and typical bud coors type stuff, if you're into that. Bartenders know their stuff and considering the amount of beers they try to remember, I gotta give credit to them. 

So the location for this one is at westgate and on a weekend or game day I would say this is the only place I would be stopping in for a beer. Try the western bbq burger, really good smoked bacon and their own bbq sauce was a good touch. Good place to go"}
{"text":"Only 2 \"samples\" per person per visit. They have over 125 beers on tap..and I can't customize a flight. Seems pretty restricted for such a large variety of beers. However the beer is always good and the food is OUTSTANDING. Just give me some more options here I'm not trying to get free beer just trying to widen my horizons without chugging shorts and breaking the bank."}
{"text":"Wife and I went for Happy Hour today. Great drink selection and service. Food was bland and not tasty at all. Might come back for happy hour again...but just drinks next time."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, nice environment. LARGE assortment of beer and ciders. Varied menu. Might get fairly loud in the evenings."}
{"text":"I love the beer selection at Yardhouse and the food is fabulous too. I had the Leinkugels Sunset Wheat, which I know sounds odd but truly tastes like fruity pebbles! It is just one of many on their huge list.

The sweet potato fries are a must try! It comes with a delicious maple aioli. We also had the Ahi Crunchy salad with the star obviously being the tuna. The dressing wasn't my favorite but overall the salad was still a success. The peppercorn Gorgonzola is another favorite of mine!

Rebecca was our server last night and she was a sweetheart. She have great service, while still allowing her own personality to shine through. A great experience overall!"}
{"text":"Bernaise sliders =  YUM!!!!  I love yardhouse, and their happy hour makes it easy to try a variety of food.  My mom and I went for lunch (before happy hour) and they had nice lunch specials with a good amount of food for a reasonable price.  She had the crab cake sandwich, which she really liked, and I had - the bernaise sliders - which, as usual were FANTASTIC!  It was not very crowded, which was nice...and i love that they sell a 6oz beer.  Just enough!"}
{"text":"My brother and his GF were in town this past week and since she wanted to hit the mall, my brother and I did some brotherly bonding at the Yardhouse for lunch. Great Draft selection... so many to choose from!! The food is decent, service was a little slow but maybe thats cuz after a few drinks my brother kept asking our waitress 'When are you gona open one of these in Northern CA.?!'
The we ordered the spicey tuna roll and wings. The Spicy Tuna Roll is made much different than you would normally get at a sushi place, but it was surprisingly very good  and spicy!

The Yardhouse isn't at the top of my list of places to hang at, but it's certainly not at the bottom."}
{"text":"Great service. Great view. Was seated for 2 at the balcony terrace area. Overlooking the Brooklyn bowl and the high rollers. 



The food was great. The waiter was pleasant and attentive. The cocktails was delicious. And the food was quick. What more can you ask?! Lol 

Had a great time with my husband."}
{"text":"After enjoying a wonderful birthday dinner in downtown Phoenix decided to stop by the Yardhouse for drinks with my  son and cousin. The server Mel was attentive and very pleasant. I love the mangolicious martini yum!  Atmosphere is always chilled and conducive for drinks and enjoying time with  peeps. Wish I had room to enjoy the grilled wings that are so delish."}
{"text":"Best experience ever had at the area, it was a Friday-night and thought it would be so busy, but we got thru with no wait. Ordered 3 dishes of apps and they all were FREE bc the manager stopped by and said they took longer than they should. (They only took like 13 mins). So friendly staff, Great food and service! Everything is five-stars! They deserve it."}
{"text":"If you haven't read my other reviews, let me tell you now. I am a fan of beer. So of course this place gets four stars with its wide selection of taps.

My only problem is the ambience is a little cookie cutter box store commercial for me. Service has always been good, food is also good although a bit pricey unless you're there for happy hour, then can get some good stuff cheap,"}
{"text":"Having lived most of my life Southern California where the Yard House an institution I know what to expect when dining here. There menu is always changing, so if you are a regular you can always find something different to try.

I frequently do staycations at RedRock Casino and my friend and I were very happen to see the Yard House had taken up residence here.

As always, before I even order a drink or open a menu I place an order for the onion ring tower. It is a must have for every visit. We decided to also go with the Seared Ahi Sashimi which was very good as well.

We ordered the Chopped Salad, which was ok. Pesido at the district chopped salad is still my favorite.  We also has an order of boneless chicken wings that will now be apart of my onion ring tower order when I return.

My friend ordered the Surf & Turf burger which I tried and really liked.

As far as everything else goes... The service was excellent as always and the food came out very fast."}
{"text":"The server helped herself to choose her tip on my credit card.  The manager thought he was a hero by offering me the stolen money back and $5.00 additional for my,\"I'm sorry for your loss\" gift.  After I let him know that $5.00 was not acceptable, it was raised to $15.00.  
I received the gift card in the mail and once again called them to let them know my disappointment.  Well, they supposedly sent out another $40.00 gift card which together is still less than my meal that night.  
Awful customer relations.  Unless I called them, I never got a call from customer relations or the management of the restaurant.
A restaurant to skip for sure!"}
{"text":"Since the take over by Darden, quality of the food has gone way down.  Staff hands are tied since quality control is being fine by corporate.  There are other choices for a fun meal that is better quality."}
{"text":"To be honest, I've never had anything that wasn't on the happy hour menu. And to be honest, that's enough to keep me coming back. The happy hour menu consists of various appetizers at half price. I highly recommend the chicken nachos and the pastrami sliders. 

As far as ambiance goes, it definitely has a feel good atmosphere and it's a great place to relax and catch a game/sporting event on one of the many TV's around the joint. 


The lowdown- Bring your friends, bring a date, eat some good food, enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"Customer service at this yard house is awful, spend the extra 15min and drive to the one on the strip...I like you yard house just get it together in Summerlin.."}
{"text":"As a Vegas local, I frequent the yard house in red rock but this is my favorite spot. Sure it's on the strip but from the wait staff to food to location, I was very pleased with my experience. My guest had the surf and turf burger which was cooked to perfection and my half pizza and salad was a perfect lunch. Our waiter Darren was pleasant and knowledgeable. I am not one to feel rushed and he gave us out space and we never had to ask for anything. As a manager of a restaurant on the strip myself, I am picky but I cannot wait to come back and sit outside on the patio to enjoy the view. Thanks for the great time!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at the Yardhouse.  Woke up in the morning and didn't get any breakfast, but opted for an earlier lunch.  We took a look at the menu outside and noticed the place wasn't too busy yet so we decided to take a seat. (P.S. they have specialty beers)

MENU:  AWESOME!  The Menu had such a great selection for my pallette.  So many choices, but I went for one of my favorites, the BBQ Cheddar Burger.  Dude, this was the BEST burger I have ever had the pleasure of eating.  There was NOTHING wrong.  Flavors were perfectly balanced!  So good!

PRICE:  Good.  The prices were right where I expected.  Lunch for two was around $45, with a specialty beer.  

SERVICE:  GREAT!  This was a HUGE winner for us.  We were greeted by a manager in training and the lady training.  She did a great job at letting the trainee have full control.  The trainee was honest and had been in the industry before, which was totally fine!  We asked him questions that, in my opinion, most trainees would stutter around.  We also had him make the choice of which meal my wife was going to eat, and which beer I was going to drink.  PERFECT CHOICES!  The guy did a GREAT job and I think him becoming a manager is an EXCELLENT business choice!

BOTTOM LINE:  Incredible.  Personally, I was blown away by this experience.  It was simply incredible and we will be eating there next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"Just updating my last review. We decided to sit upstairs on the patio for some reason (103F outside) and we got the same server as last time (Tim.) Surprisingly enough he remember us and remembered what kind of drinks we had last time. We got the same 5 star service we did last time even though we only sat down for drinks. Whenever we come back to this place I will only stay if we have Tim as our server!"}
{"text":"They have great food and an even better atmosphere. I eat my whole plate every time I go there just because the food is delicious. A big burger on a pretzel bun. Honestly doesn't get any better than here. Lots of fun games and I always have a blast when I go there. One of my favorite places!"}
{"text":"My mom and I went to Yard House on a sunny May afternoon before riding the High Roller. It was not crowded at all. We were promptly seated on the outdoor deck which gave us a great view of the High Roller and the shops below. Our server was friendly and attentive. 

I had a pizza and salad. Very tasty and reasonably priced. My mom had no complaints with her fish and chips. 

The best part of Yard House is, of course, the beer. What a selection!! The drink menu is very descriptive so you know exactly what you're getting when you order- where it's brewed, alcohol content, etc.   I ordered a watermelon beer which was meh but hey, I'm not big on watermelon unless it's the actual fruit. 

The restaurant is quite large. Restrooms are on the main level.  There's an elevator as well as a staircase to the upper level."}
{"text":"Yard house happy hour is the reason why i love yard house so much. the quality of the food is already great let alone dropping prices for happy hour! selection of beers is amazing plus the various sizes you can choose from! great place for bites & drinks! even better place for a late lunch! Chicken Nachos is a must!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location sporadically for a few years. BEST place to try beers (they have over 150) Food is mediocre. Prices are decent. It's busy but the bar and restaurant is huge so plenty of space for everyone. The service is random. Sometimes good, sometimes okay and rarely bad. But it's worth it if you are a beer drinker. They also have a good variety of food listed for happy hour. Not all bad for a chain and pretty consistent. Will always come here if I'm in the area and in the mood to drink beer. I would give it 3-4 stars. Cheers!!"}
{"text":"food was good, service was sloww...  The taste & presentation of the food was on par but overall our server was pretty lousy.  They are very fast with the drinks & beer but even getting our food order taken was slower than it should have been.  I like their vast selection of beers."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! They've got a huge beer selection on tap. The server \"Dee\" was extremely friendly, even tho we came in at the end of her shift. Our new server was also super friendly, but I've forgotten her name. We had the crab cakes and a vampire taco to start. Both were very good! We then had the Thai pizza and pepper jack burger. Needless to say, I haven't been this impressed with an entire meal in a very long time! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great appetizers, go for happy hour and just eat them. Sliders and fries are awesome, it's always clean in there and the staff is always nice."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here for our anniversary and a few other special occasions. we both love the food and have been really happy with everything we have ordered. I love the Giant California Roll plate, its tasty!"}
{"text":"We wanted to find a decent Sports Bar to watch the Blazers game and we were definitely not disappointed! The food, the service, and the atmosphere were all great. As a vegetarian I was nervous about the options, but there were tons! I would definitely recommend the tofu lettuce wraps and the Kale Caesar salad. Large portions so just the starter portion of the salad was great! Definitely recommend the truffle fries, but I'm not sure it's real truffle oil- possibly just fake flavoring. Also, our hostess was so nice and split each of our bills up (I was in a group of 4) beforehand!"}
{"text":"Visiting Las Vegas from Houston, TX. Been to the Yard House in City Center many times one of my favorite places to drink craft brews.  The draft selection is Great & on point, food is pretty damn good, w/ tons of variety, all the meats & various vegetarian dishes. Imo food is tastier than a handful of casinos on the Vegas strip. Service is excellent @ the bar, very attentive, Managers were visible & involved w/ every guest.  Excellent location in the Quad courtyard next to O'Shea's.  I need to check out a few more craft beer spots on the Vegas Strip, but so far this one is the best."}
{"text":"Great ambiance. Great food. I especially love going here with a bunch of friends. It is a great place to hang out and have a few drinks ;)"}
{"text":"Everything was good.fast service.cold.beer. good food.atmosphere.all smiles.nothing badd to say about yardhouse"}
{"text":"We had wanted to try this place since it's opening, but finally hit a night with a shorter wait.  I thought my NY Steak Salad was very good, but my husband ordered the Jerk. Enchilada Stack and did not care for it.  My friends that were with us had the Mac and Cheese and the fish and Chips.  The fish was salty and the chicken in the pasta dish was bland and had no flavor, which was my husband's main complaint with the Jerk Enchilada Stack.  The server we had was okay, professional and doing his job.   We felt that for the lengthy wait, the food should at least have more flavor.   Seemed a tad overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"Nice big beer selection but the food wasn't so great (spicy tuna roll and California roll are not what you expect and don't really taste as one would expect either)."}
{"text":"Matthew L on the patio is the worst server ever!  We went on Saturday and got really bad food (cold, stale) and received horrible service (had to track down waiter to order, no refills, never came back to check on status of meal).  I typically like the YH, for HH at least, but felt compelled to warn people about the horrible experience we had sitting out on the patio last Saturday.  I contact YH- hopefully they will take some action to rectify the situation."}
{"text":"House of the best grilled cheese and tomato soup (make sure you ask for bacon). Now I see why its always packed."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place after walking past it a few times on my previous visits to west gate. Your given a hand buzzer to alert you when your table is ready, which is great when there is a long wait. This particular night was cold, and we requested to not be seated by a door; the opposite was done, so the dinning experience was uncomfortable :(

I ordered the four cheese pizza, and had spinach added to it. Overall the taste was okay.. My drink was delicious {cherry limeade}, alcoholic drink, and sadly the best part of my meal and experience. The other person I was dining with ordered a coke, and it was flat and, not so great in taste. After getting it switched out two times, he just gave up and had water with his meal.

Our waiter was great, checked in to see if everything was good. Will I be back in to dine again, probably not, based off of my experience; but I do recommend the cherry limeade drink!

#ilovegoodfood"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong here. Obviously you're coming to drink if you're here and this place has all the options. They have great bar food and happy hours. Only thing bad is that the bartenders think they are too good to serve you."}
{"text":"Ate here tonight.

Yard House provides excellent value for each dollar.

 I had the jambalaya (which was spicier that I've been I would have hoped) but each mouthful was *packed* with flavor.

Daughter had the Mac N Cheese - very good and cheeeeeeeeesy.

Wife had the Korean Short Rib taco - also excellent.

Huge, massive beer list on tap.  Amazing.

Dollar for dollar?  Well worth it.

{"text":"Tried Yardhouse in Scottsdale for the first time and I must say it was a pleasant experience. I was pleased with the staff and how polite they were and enjoyed the vibe of the ambiance. 

I started off with the Midnight Sangria which I loved! Ordered the Moo Shu egg rolls as an appetizer and really enjoyed them. I also tried one of the house favorites.. The Mac n cheese and I am completely obsessed with it!! It's loaded with grilled chicken, thick crispy bacon and mushroom not to mention different cheeses. This is a more sophisticated Mac n cheese for a mature palate. I will definitely try to copy this dish and make it for my family.

I didn't get a chance to try any deserts but this is definitely on my list next visit, I will also be trying a steak as well."}
{"text":"Great service, great location and outstanding food. We loved the nachos to start. The beer selection was well above average with several different seasonal beers available. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Great food, service was spot on. Wait staff very helpful in describing the dishes served. Wow what a selection of craft  beers. Menu broke the beers down into categories with descriptions of each. Outdoor dining pleasant even in February.  Parking abundant and easily accessible and free."}
{"text":"Went out to dinner with my friends JD and Michele  They chose Yardhouse and I was excited because I had never been before.  When we got there we were told there would be a 25 -30 minute wait although there were plenty of open tables on the patio.  We decided to stay and the 30 minute wait only ended up being like 10 minutes. 
We were seated and then started checking out the menu. 
Drinks were in order so we perused the drink menu, Our waiter came up and requested our drink order..

::::::MAJOR PROPS:::::::  to our waiter for carding me and Michele- being ::cough::43::cough::  that was quite the ego boost! 

and JD is kind of a beer connoisseur so he got some fancy schmancy kind of beer which I can't even remember the name of ... I decided on the Pear Cider. 
Let me just clarify that I  my choice ROCKED! 
It was light and delicious .. LOVED IT!
Michele chose the Raspberry Cider and it was good too.

We all ordered and JD chose the southern fried chicken, Michele the parmesan crusted chicken and me ? I chose a turkey club sandwich with french fries. 

Our meals came , and I was totally sad I did not get the southern fried chicken because it looked amazing!
My meal looked amazing too so I really wasn't THAT sad.
Michele was sad because he brought her the wrong dish. So she had to wait a little bit, I shared my fries in the mean time.  oh it was also a good reason for another pear cider.  JD ordered an Arrogant Bastard Ale.   

Michele's meal finally came and she was excited to dig in, and it was delicious.

The portions were large so left overs were even better. 

All in All a great meal.. just one star down for the wrong meal delivery... 

Will definitley go back!"}
{"text":"Service: Hostess gala was very friendly.  Im happy to say our server was Tess. She was friendly and extremely polite, making the experience great.  Wait wasn't long at all! 15 min for a Saturday night. We waited at the bar and our bartender was exceptional. It's great to be greeted by friendly people. 

Food: Chicken Nachos were good. Nothing spectacular. Highly recommend getting the island drop martini. By far the best."}
{"text":"Fairly frequent customer, and never remember having a bad experience here. The chicken strips are big and delicious. Service is prompt and courteous. Atmosphere is fun but relaxing. Most of all though, I have never in my life met a more genuinely friendly bartender staff. Every single one of them is amazing. Truly a great reflection on not only the people they are, but the hiring staff and expectations of the management as well. Kudos!"}
{"text":"Good price and food quality for 1/2 sandwich and salad lunch special. One of the better values in this area......so far. Waiter was attentive and kept our water glasses filled."}
{"text":"Last time we were here I had the Garlic Salmon and he had the Ribs. Both were excellent. We ended up on the patio section of the seating and there was a musician playing on the promenade just across the way. It was so wonderful, the perfect setting. Great beer selection and impressive menu variety. We have been here multiple times and sometimes service can be pretty slow."}
{"text":"We had been to Red Rock Resort a couple times before finding Yard House, but we have been loyal since finding it (2 visits during the last trip.)  Normally we aren't big franchise fans (didn't even realize this was a franchise until the second visit), but we loved that we could split a yummy salad and a wonderful individual pizza and have a great lunch! Good stuff!!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Good food. Good service. Great for any occasion really... Simplicity in its best."}
{"text":"I was helped by Erik who was a super cool guy. He was awesome in recommending items and a complete beer expert. It was both an awesome atmosphere and also a learning experience! Food is great!!"}
{"text":"Stopped after morning hike at Red Rock National Park. We were starving. Service was quick and food was good. Beer was great too. Vampire tacos hit the spot. Special thanks to waiter. Definitely be back when in the area."}
{"text":"Wow. Salty salty salty! This is an example of a terrible chain restaurant that is raising the blood pressure of the country. I ordered a \"chef special\" seafood pasta. It was so salty I had to return it - completely inedible! My father in law had fish and chips which tasted stale and fishy. The French fries were over salted.  I only give it 2 stars because it had a nice ambiance. My advice RUN AWAY!"}
{"text":"Great service waiters had great attitude and kept the drinks going. Food was amazing."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot, when I can't decide on what to eat.  I love this place, the food is always good, and the amount of beer that they offer makes it that much better.

I recommend you try the Jambalaya, with angel hair pasta.  Best Jambalaya I have ever had!"}
{"text":"This place has solid food and has a good menu for happy hour with good prices. If I had to recommend something get a California roll it's not your typical California roll but it's pretty good. Service is good food good so overall it's a good 4 stars. You can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"Easy going place that has something for everyone.  The menu was incredibly long.  My son had a steak - which was cooked well, my daughter ordered a delicious pizza & I had the ahi salad - which I could not finish.  Beer list is also crazy huge.  The location and service were good - and other than the fact that I thought it was a little dark - we would definitely go back.  Great place if you have to feed people with different tastes!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't even give this place 1 star considering my husband and I got food poisoning.  We went on Sunday night after not having seen each other since Thursday Night (no meals together). My husband was sick all night and I have been having severe stomach cramps and diarrhea. After contacting the \"store manager\" we were basically laughed at and told that we were wrong.  We are not wrong and will be contacting the health department. Eat here at your own risk."}
{"text":"We ordered the Grilled Korean Bbq Short Ribs for our appetizer. DELICIOUS! We then ordered the street tacos for our meal and they were great as well. After our meal we ordered the Smores brownie and the Creme Brûlée. Oh my, were these both delicious! By far the best service we have had this weekend! Better than Beth at Ruth's Chris, better than Adrian at the Strip House, better than Daniel and the pretentious manager Chris at Guy Fieri's Vegas Kitchen and Bar.... Our waitress, Summer, is super sweet and very attentive. She made awesome suggestions for our meal, and our glasses wear never empty. Highly recommend this restaurant!!!! Thank you for a great meal, and overall experience!"}
{"text":"Just left this location after having dinner on a Saturday night and the service was excellent. Christine was our waitress and despite the place being packed she was very attentive. This location and the location at Town Square are both very loud so I wouldn't come here for the ambiance, but the food is worth it. The fiancé and I both had black truffle cheeseburgers, our usual, and they are mouth watering. We also got the lobster crab artichoke dip which lived up to its name. Overall I love this place and will definitely continue to come here for a good meal."}
{"text":"Alec is a fabulous waiter! The happy hour has great prices and the apps were surprisingly huge portions! Its a fun laid back place with upscale service and food!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection and food.  The service can be a little slow but you may not mind that since it is a great place to sit around the bar and try some different beers.  One of my favorite places in Vegas."}
{"text":"Awesome place to go for appetizers and happy hour has one of the biggest selections of beer that I know really relaxing atmosphere and friendly people here I would definitely come here again I definitely recommend a firecracker chicken and sushi roll on the appetizer menu"}
{"text":"I love it here! The LINQ's Yard House is such an amazing restaurant to visit with friends and family. 

My friends and I weren't very hungry, so we were planning on splitting tons of appetizers and snacks, which was nice because the servers didn't force us to order expensive entrées. 

We ordered sweet potato fries, regular fries, buffalo wings with barbecue sauce, chicken strips, and I -- being a pescatarian -- ordered a baja fish taco. LOVED IT. Everything I ate was perfectly cooked with tons of flavor. 

Overall, I had a great time here. The servers were nice and patient while the food stayed consistently deeelicious."}
{"text":"Have gone to other Yard House restaurants with friends & had enjoyable evenings.  This time went to the Tatum Blvd. location & the music  was so loud  we had to scream to talk with our friends sitting across the table.  The service was OK but nothing to rave about.. Think twice before you go there if you want to have a conversation with your dinner guests."}
{"text":"4 stars for the food, 3 for the service. It just depends if that server is having a good day or not, but the service is either bad or great. Chicken and bacon mac and cheese is incredible and whether it's the bernaise sliders or burger, you won't be disappointed by what you get from any of the food."}
{"text":"Made the trip into Scottdale to visit Yardhouse Craft Beer Bar & Restaurant to see what 125 Tap Beer Handles looked like.  A mix of true craft, semi craft, pretend craft, imports & domestics.  I'll say this, there is certainly somthing for everyone.   I would like to have seen more true craft but with a selection that large there was quite a bit of beer to choose from. 
 I've heard more than a few complaints that all that Brew tends to sit in the beer lines far to long before being poured/tapped & goes Flat.  Having said so, we visited on a Sunday morning hoping the busy weekend would see all those beers poured through.  We tried quite a few different brews & only found only one truly out of sorts.
The Belgian Sampler/ Flight was nice & the food was really quite nice.  The Sushi was oddly prepared, much like a small cake, but more than acceptable.  As their name might suggest, the Yard House had 1/2 yards of beer although I didnt see anyone drinking them. Can you drink a Belgian strong ale from one of those?
All In All, not a bad trip.  3 Stars, could be better with more true craft beer.
PS. It was truly difficult not letting any Scottsdale Stereotypes invade this review. Sure there were cougars galore & 30k millionaires eveywhere the eye could see. And yes, I'm pretty sure I saw Mike Tyson!"}
{"text":"Man is this place high dollar but MAN is it worth it.  i got some gift certificates from work (otherwise my broke butt would never be able to afford to feed 2 here) and i gotta say i had the best steak Ive had in my life.   Also they have probably the most impressive beer selection in town.  Not the best beers always, but the biggest spread.  its a good place to listen to top 40 classic rock or see a game when you have a hundred bucks to blow.  This is my \"special occasion\" place.

my only beef with Yardhouse is they claim to be a rock n roll bar but all you need is a billboard chart on shuffle to match their knowledge on the subject.  Think upscale Hard Rock Cafe minus any redeeming memorabilia.

Attire was typically business casual, which i didnt know when i showed up in my ragged jeans and black flag t-shirt.  Oops."}
{"text":"Love this place & will definitely be back!  The place was PACKED, & I could see why.
Great food, atmosphere, & friendly service. 
The only down side is that my side of rice was pretty plain (but the rest was fantastic), sometimes the service was a little slow (but again, they were packed), & the floors were very slippery. They should really do something about that... I wore heels & had to walk very carefully so I wouldn't slip."}
{"text":"Great food...awesome beer selection...and good service. The menu covers just about anything you might want from a bar, mixed with some unique pacific style food (Anything Ahi here is good!).

Seafood is always fresh, burgers are fantastic, and the beer is always ice-cold. Great children's menu too."}
{"text":"We just had a wonderful experience at the Yard House. I was having a hard time finding any restaurant that had a menu that would accommodate an unhappy stomach. I spotted a couple of menu items that I thought might work.  We were warmly greeted, and seated in Brett's area. Brett was able to bring out the manager and the chef to talk to me. With the chef's recommendation, it only took a couple of minutes to decide on what would work and how he could alter it for me. My husband was able to have his Happy Hour menu and I got to have something that worked for me.  I have had to ask for the chef in other restaurants, with unsympathetic results or they made no attempt to make the food taste good. This one I made the effort to review because they all went out of their way to take care of me."}
{"text":"Been going here for years. Ok Food, ok pricing and ok atmosphere. Customer service is usually ok as well. Food just is not really that exciting and I don't drink alcohol so my rating is on food alone. Not a bad place to go, but not usually high on my list."}
{"text":"Came back to yard house again and customer service is still outstanding , I sat at the bar and Jose and jerry really made us feel welcomed"}
{"text":"I have yet to visit Yard House and have a bad experience. We were seeing a 9:50 movie and popped into Yard House around 6:30 PM on a Friday night to grub and drink. The wait was not too bad, and with the bar and sports on TV it went by even faster. The bartenders were friendly and quick, and my Longboard Ale did not disappoint. Mmmmm, beeeeeeeeer. 

Once seated we decided on the Lobster Crab Artichoke Dip as an appetizer. Personally I like this with the Pita wedges so I think they need to 86 the chips on the plate and add more Pita! I highly recommend this appetizer, it's one of our favorites! 

For dinner we decided to try something new. Going off positive Yelp reviews I chose the Jambalaya on Jasmine Rice. My husband went with the Chicken Garlic Noodles. We were both happy with our meals, good flavor, cooked properly, all the basics. I've never had a bad meal at Yard House so this was no surprise to me. If we have to choose, my Jambalaya was the better of the two (Katie FTW, yet again!). 

I love bringing a large group to Yard House, we came here for my pre-bachelorette party dinner :) and that was yet again another great Yard House experience. 

I recommend Yard House for quality food and beer, it is consistent, family or large group friendly and they have a large, diverse menu."}
{"text":"Service was ok... Spinach dip was overcooked other than that no complaints. Also we were seated pretty quickly for it being a Sunday. Food was good."}
{"text":"Tried 3 times to get in. 3rd time I actually had to leave work early to make sure the wait wasn't over an hour. Perhaps they're overhyped just because their new and in a popular location. Filet was pretty good for not being a steakhouse or 5 star reataurant. The \"half yard\" sized beer is excessively tall from the glass being so thin. Even the waitress was worried she would knock it over. Overall, the only time I would return would be during a weeknight when the crowd would be thinner and order a burger or chicken as opposed to a nicer meal."}
{"text":"Saturday night and we had plans to meet another couple at Yard House for dinner and drinks.  We were seated right away at a high top table close to the bar and kitchen entrance.  Pretty busy area to say the least.

We were greeted by a nice young guy to take our drink orders.  We all ordered beer.  My girlfriend and I always order Coors Light and Bryce (our server) gave us a hard time being that we were at the \"Yard House\" ordering a domestic beer. haha  He recommended the light beer which I went with and I must say it was pretty darn good.  My BF on the other hand ordered a raspberry beer (a girly foofoo beer I guess. haha).  With that said, it was the focus on the rest of the night because our dear server Bryce was not going to let him live that down.  (read on)

As we went over our menus Bryce brought the BF a kids menu (hence the beer reference).  So you know its going down at this point.  It's on son! LOL  That followed by a straw in BF's beer when he wasn't looking...totally crackin-up-classic.  So silly.
 
VARIETY is where its at on this menu.  Huge assortments of food and drinks....what more could you want to satisfy a craving for a fab Saturday night out.  I had beer, sushi and Italian all in one sitting.  How's that for variety. Amen!

Run Down:
Appetizer the California Roll: - It is huge, great to share, totally delish. It is literally  one piece of a sushi roll-but times 10 in size topped with snowcrab and avacado...a definite must try.
Me - Penne with chicken, mushrooms, asparagus, sundried tomatoes in a cream sauce - Never ever a disappointment (definitely not a dish for the diet)
BF - Orange Peel Chicken - Total Yum.  He gets it all the time and loves it.

To end the meal Bryce brought over a to-go kids cup in case BF wanted to take his drink with him (not for real because Im not sure you can do that). haha  What a delight Mr. Bryce was.  He definitely has that something special to add to customer service.  I hope his manager takes notice!  We will be back hoping to get his table again.

Anyways, food and ambiance are always amazing.  They have a cool outdoor patio with TVs which is definitely fun watching your favorite teams play.  Anything we have ordered on this menu has been consistently perfect.  I do think that the mac&cheese is one of my favorite dishes and the hummus is yummy too.  The service is always good.  This is a regular stop for us and we will be back soon for sure.  My stomach is growling just thinking about it....hey it is FRIDAY!!! ;)"}
{"text":"Really great selection of drinks, we have the six tasters of the IPA. We also had the four cheese pizza and it was great. Only wish our server knew more about the beers."}
{"text":"I love yard house, but this location lacks speedy service. We ordered a bunch of appetizers and some beer. Appetizers came, beer never made it. When we finally got out drinks, there was nothing to eat with them. The beer recommendations out server was giving us was just read through her little black book. She clearly had no clue how to answer my questions and severely lacked knowledge about beers as her recommendation tasted like water with hops... Food was delicious as always but the pork belly tacos are not worth the $4.95 price tag (EACH!) They were greasy and the Kim chi on top made it cold and soggy...  I'll probably give them another chance as I enjoy this chain's food."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, so this is a combined rating of both experiences.

The first time I went was in April at 6pm with my girlfriend. The  I ordered the the Chilled Edamame, Grilled Sweet Korean BBQ Beef and a half portion of the Ahi Crunchy Salad. I also ordered a glass of pinot noir and a large bottle of sparkling water. I can't recall what my friend ordered, so I'm only going to write about my experience. Our waitress seemed friendly enough, however she spoke so fast, that it was difficult to understand her. After we placed our order, we didn't see her for almost 20 minutes. A runner delivered my friend's drink and my sparkling water, however, the pinot noir was no where to be found. Then the edamame came out and my friend's appetizer, still no wine. We asked another waiter (not ours bc we still couldn't find her) if they could check on my wine. Our next courses came out -- Korean BBQ Beef, which was hot and tender with great sweet and tangy flavor and the white jasmine rice was hot and the perfect stickiness.  We started to eat, but I wanted to have my wine with my meal, so I ate slowly. 10 minutes later, I had to ask yet another waiter about the status of my wine, and they went to find our waitress, who finally brought my wine 15 minutes later. The Korean BBQ Beef was still good though, even though it was cold from waiting for the pinot noir. My salad came out shortly after by yet another waiter, then our original waitress came by and said that she was transitioning our table to another waiter since she was going on break, which was laughable bc to us, she had been on break for 45 minutes. Our new waitress asked us if we wanted to order dessert, which I did, a scoop of caramel ice cream. My GF also placed a take away order for her husband to bring home, so I assumed that while we waited for his food, the waiter would bring out my dessert. But instead, they brought out my dessert when they brought out his take away food. So I had to eat my ice cream really fast so the take away food wouldn't get cold. 

Food Score: A
Service Score: D+
Atmosphere: B+ (a little loud, but fun and ively)

The second time I went to  YH was on Sat night during Memorial Day Weekend. The place was packed so we got put on the wait list, and then went to the bar. Fortunately, 2 seats opened up at the bar, so we decided to eat at the bar instead, which was good for me bc I knew that my drink would come out much faster than the time. Our bartender was friendly and took our beverage order right away while we looked at the menu. We both had Stellas and then we ordered the Onion Rings Tower and Hummus to start. The food came out pretty quickly and the onion rings were nice, crispy and hot, but the hummus was runny and slimy and had a weird after taste, so we didn't finish that dish. I had liked the Korean BBQ Beef dish the first time, so I ordered it again for my main, while my husband ordered the Spicy Jambalaya with Brown Rice. That food came out in a timely manner, however, my dish was very disappointing and my husband's came out with white rice, so they took it back. Instead of replating it, they scooped out the white rice and put brown rice on the same plate, which was now a total mess. My husband was so hungry and didn't want to wait, that he ate it anyway, but we both couldn't believe that it didn't get replated. I was really looking forward to my dish bc it was so good the first time, however, this time, the beef was dry, much smaller pieces, almost shriveled and lacking any of the juicy flavor from last time and the rice was also dry and cold. I was hungry, so I ate it anyway. I was afraid to send it back bc it could've been worse, especially after what happened to my husband's dish when he sent it back. Our bartender asked us if we wanted dessert and I told her we wanted the caramel ice cream and she said that they didn't have it. She told me that I must be mistaken, bc it's not on the menu. I told her that I had it last time in April, and she said that they didn't, but instead, recommended the salted caramel butterscotch pudding. We ordered that instead, and we're glad we did bc it was quite good. Still annoying though that she said that they didn't have caramel ice cream bc I just checked the menu online and there it was - 

ICE CREAM
vanilla, caramel, mango sorbet, java chip, mint chocolate chip

Food Score: C-
Service Score: B+
Atmosphere: B+ (a little loud, but fun and ively)

I really wanted to like this place based on previous reviews. My husband and I are both in the hospitality industry and we like to support local businesses, so we may give it one more try, especially since it's conveniently located. Hopefully the third time's a charm and the service and food will both be good."}
{"text":"I was visiting from out of San Diego and had been to the Saddle Ranch Chop House the day before but there was so many restaurants here I made my friends drive back here as it was the second restaurant that stood out to me while i was here. (they live in Buckeye) so it was a lil drive to get here. But it was well worth it. It was pretty busy and surprisingly the wait was about five minutes until we were seated. It was so nice to get out of the heat. the booth was large and comfortable, of course they are known for the wide variety of draft beers over 100 i believe, (WOW) I just went with a beer i was familiar with shock top, i got a half yard of that. My waitress, I wish I remembered her name she was so awesome. so helpful with the menu, and making recommendations, very sweet and funny. very attentive, Her plus the food made this place an automatic favorite for me. While im aware there is a yardhouse in San Diego this was my first time trying it out. I got the Southern fried Chicken with the spinach and corn mashed potatoes, im not be exaggerating but this dish was beyond amazing, soooo soooo delicious. all the combinations of flavor were everything. definite favorite. YOU MUST TRY THIS !! I really enjoyed this restaurant and the sports like atmosphere is awesome. It was so good that I came back the very next day. My waiter was so kind as I expected and happened to be from San Diego As well , this time I got the halibut with asparagus and spinach mashed potatoes, another delicious meal. service was good. Thank you all for the amazing experience and That chef really knows what theyre doing !!"}
{"text":"Bomb ass chicken!! Just do it. Some of the best chicken I've had in years. The burgers were great and they have this cool deconstructed California roll that is just super cool. I'd come back or even leave strip just to come here"}
{"text":"Many dollars $$$$$$$$$ and many years later...employees are amazing, the food average when it doesn't smell of grease and lousy management.
Sorry Allen and Hope..you guys are awsome"}
{"text":"Never a bad experience at The Yardhouse. Besides the wonderful food and cocktails, the staff provides a great dining experience as well."}
{"text":"I don't usually love chain restaurants, but this place is legit.  One of my absolute favorite things in the world to eat is served here - the Brussels Sprouts and Ripped Potatoes appetizer.  I've ordered it 2-3 times and it's consistently great.  The past 2 visits, I ordered the Maui chicken dinner, and it's delicious!  The chicken is sort-of bone it, the breast and wing are attached to one another, but the rest of the bones are removed, making it simple to cut through the breast with ease.  The sauce and grilled pineapple skewers on top make this dish a killer!  They offer an excellent selection of craft brews, along with your traditional faves.  Definitely a must-go whenever I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"4 stars for the beer choice and 2 stars for the food. 
Beer are overpriced so it's only worth going there for  happy hour, so I prefer late night. Food is one of worst you can get. It's a big menu but very few items are edible. Usually 80% of the time it comes cold and 50% of time improperly cooked. I do like their jambalaya when it's cooked ok and their buffalo boneless wing when they are not overcooked. I used to go there once a week but the raw shrimps on the jambalaya made it become once every 3 months, that was the last drop and we make sure we eat before we go there"}
{"text":"Phenomenal customer service with very knowledgable and accommodating staff! My boyfriend and I are both vegan and our server went out of her way to make sure we had everything we needed and more. Great vegan options."}
{"text":"This restaurant/bar is conveniently located in Scottsdale Mall. I've had a lot of items on the menu and they are all pretty good. This comes off like high quality bar food, but the execution isn't quite there. They have something like a 100+ beers on tap, but nothing they have is really unique. As a beer connoisseur, it's all fairly standard stuff I've had before. A lot of flat screens for watching sports. If you are hanging around the mall and want to relax, it's a reliable place."}
{"text":"great beer selection but just a touch above average bar food. reasonably priced at happy hour."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the Yard House.  Excellent selection of beer to say the least.  Big menu with lots of interesting choices including some great vegetarian selections.  

What I've had so far:

Pear and blue cheese salad - outstanding
Spicy salad - awesome
Veggie burger sliders with Bearnaise to dip them in - delicious
Edamame - great 
Chips and guac - excellent
Grilled artichoke w/fresh made chips - THE BEST!

My husband has tried a few varieties of their boneless wings and he's hooked as well.  Very busy and loud, they crank classic rock and have a million TV's going but it's good for lunch or if you have a group that wants to go out and have a good loud time.  Service can be slow but it's always so jammed I can't really blame them."}
{"text":"This place has a very decent happy hour (M-F). Drinks and appetizers at a discount. The place is nice, located in Town Square and the crowd is great. You have to go there early if you want to sit at the bar. There is always a wait outside every time I go there. So, I guess it is pretty popular. The portions are huge , ideal for sharing."}
{"text":"Greatest draft beer selection in town. Friendly quick service. Above average bar food and other treats. Even the pasta is good. And the kona ice cream sundae, heaven!"}
{"text":"I chose this restaurant online mostly because of its stunning variety of menu options. An almost overwhelming variety of appetizers, salads, sandwiches, and even chicken-substitute options among other choices were appealing to my group. 
When we arrived at about 6.30 on a Sunday night, there was a very long line which made me wish I had called ahead. However, we were seated within 10 minutes.
Our waiter clearly did not think that our 24-and-under table would tip well, a tendency that bothers me since I always tip generously for good service. He was rude and abrupt, especially when we declined to order alcohol. He even took my menu away before I was done ordering. 
The food was brought out by a different server, and a pleasant smile and the shocking addition of a few kind words were a breath of fresh air from our server, who was anything but courteous. 
The food itself was stellar. One companion had a grilled burger, which had excellent flavor; my sister had the vodka pasta, which was also delicious. My shrimp lettuce wraps were good, but tricky to put together and eat - I wouldn't order that on a first date or business meeting!
Overall: great ambiance and location, terrible service, and awesome food!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Steak and shrimp was really good and totally worth the price. We went for my friends birthday and she got the cutest plate with an awesome dish of peach cobbler. Me and my friends will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went to this particular location for a friends birthday lunch last December. Great service and great food!   

This is a great place to get lunch if you have some extra time during your lunch break or if its your day off.  Pretty mellow atmosphere during the day, gets pretty busy during the evenings.  

Before our friend arrived we told the waitress that it was her birthday and asked if at some point towards the end of the meal we could get some kind of little birthday dessert brought out. She delivered on that towards the end of the meal, no charge.    She was a great waitress in every other aspect of our meal as well.  Made it such a great experience.

The food was pretty good as well, especially the lettuce wraps. There were no complaints from anyone at the table about the food, there was praise all around.  Best part was it was a pretty cheap meal for 3 people, at least cheaper than i expected it to be and that's always a pleasant surprise. 

This is definitely my favorite Yardhouse out of all the ones in the Las Vegas area.  Will have to go here again when we get the chance to visit Vegas again since we now live in Utah."}
{"text":"I have eaten here multiple times in the past and it's been about two years from my last visit. I can only say I was disappointed on my most recent trip with the service and with the food. I use to love the parmesan beer battered onion ring tower and I bragged how good they were to my wife, and when they arrived at the table they were missing the parmesan which she was quick to point out. In fairness I ordered off of memory and maybe the menu changed but I was disappointed. The server seemed to be uninterested and didn't spend any effort on telling us about the daily specials or make any recommendations. The food runners actually spent more time inquiring about our needs. I won't say I won't go back however with all the competition in the area it won't be a slam dunk as it had been in the past."}
{"text":"It is a fun place to hang out with friends in there. And try their house beer, you will love it."}
{"text":"Great happy hour! Server seemed like she was in a hurry to leave and got into an altercation with another server over our table. Very unprofessional. Very RUDE."}
{"text":"This is our families go to for a beer, food, and a good time on the patio. They always accommodate us and our large groups that seem to always end up with one or two more people!! Such great food and friendly staff!!!"}
{"text":"The yard house has almost any beer you could ever want to try! My husband loves to have a good beer on tap and this restaurant has tons! Whenever he picks a restaurant this is number one on his list! I also enjoy the wide variety of foods that are available no matter what you are in the mood for! They always have sports games playing and will usually switch tvs to what you desire unless it has already been requested by another guest. It is quite noisy but not unbearable to have a conversation."}
{"text":"With all the other restaurants to choose from at the revolving door of eateries that Town Square seems to be, Yard House has proved to have staying power. Maybe people feel more comfortable at a chain, maybe people are just boozehounds, the world may never know. 

I like Yard House better for lunch personally because I find the dinner entrees to be a bit overpriced. When it first opened friends constantly wanted to dine here and my wallet cringed as well as my patience as we jammed up against the bar waiting for our table. Once you get past that however, the place is quality. The portions are big and no one can complain about the beer selection (unless, like me, you await the arrival of Yuengling to the west coast, I check every time I go). They have a great selection of food so everyone in the party will be able to find something they're in the mood for. Yard House reminds me of Cheesecake Factory, but substitute cake for beer. The lunch specials are very fairly priced and will fill you up.

The outdoor seating is awesome in the still bearable months of summer and at night prepare to see some sights sashaying over to nearby Blue \"wait this isn't Tao?\" Martini. Good times all around. There are TV's everywhere in this joint, including outdoors, so you won't miss a pass, kick or homerun. Overall I recommend but if you're going for dinner, have a snack before you leave the house to hold you over."}
{"text":"Great collection of beers with 125+ on tap.  Food is very good as well, ranging from sandwiches to full dinners.  I had a Indonesian style grilled shrimp with nicely spiced rice.  Others had the Ahi Tuna which was cooked perfectly (rare!).  Overall nice place for casual dining"}
{"text":"Hit the Yard House a bit late on an off Sunday night so was not crowded although there was a short wait for outside seating.  I have been to one or two of these before and like the others, the beer selection is massive.  How they keep all the draft beers fresh is a feat in itself.  The food at this one was very good, I had a light dinner of scallops which were perfectly cooked served with a brown rice salad and some humus.  Different and very good.  The wife had fish & chips which were also excellent.  Not exactly cheap, the above with 2 large beers tax & tip hit $70 but as it turns out in the area the Yard House is one of the best places around."}
{"text":"The yard house is so ridiculous on the weekends that it is so not not worth dealing with. It seems like the Vegas douchebags and  whores like to pre-game at Yard House before they go to Blue Martini. It's filled with drunk college kids and people who get sloppy. The service is terrible on the weekends at the bar, you almost have to throw something at a bartender to get service. The food is great though. Honestly, I have never had a bad plate of food from there. It is a little pricey for a bar I will say. They have a huge list of beer available on tap and it can be a nice place to go to if you don't go at the already pre-specified times by another reviewer. It's basically a less fancy pick up bar on the weekends for college kids. If you want to get loud and rowdy, this is the place to go on Friday and Saturday. If you want some great food for dinner before a movie that's not on the weekends, this is your place."}
{"text":"Our bartender made multiple mistakes on our food orders. She's is human and we all have off days. This is the first time its every happened to me here and I eat here more than I should (I love this place). The Manager, Mr. Beau, and our bartender came by and more than made things right. Its easy to judge someone when they are having a good day, but true character comes out when someone is just having an \"off day\". Our bartender was still more than friendly and we enjoyed our food and time at the bar. 


3 star rating for all the mistakes
+1 for still keeping a great attitude after the mistakes
+1 for fixing everything above and beyond what I would expect without any \"hints\" or complaints from me."}
{"text":"Awesome food, brew & service. Outside seating is delightful."}
{"text":"Great food great bar tenders but prices are high for what they serve. This place is only worth going to during happy hour."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this Yardhouse at the Linq and check out the promenade too.  Yardhouse was delicious, lots of vegetarian options and great happy hour! Kelsey our server was friendly and helpful, and manager Dave was cool and went above and beyond! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"THE best boneless buffalo wings I've ever had!  Just the right combination of spiciness, quantity & crunchiness makes them a 10 out of 10!"}
{"text":"Had lunch w/ a girlfriend this afternoon and totally loved the grub!  I had the bombass turkey burger w/ the most decadent sweet potato fries ever!  The burger was huge, juicy & flavored so nicely w/ bits of veggies all over, smothered by melted mozzarella, bite sized roasted tomatoes & fresh arugula, so freakin yummy.  We had an awesome server who recommended an off the menu house mixed grape sprite, pretty sweet!  My friend ordered the turkey club & tomato cream and absolutely loved the soup.  With drinks & tip our total came to $40, good deal."}
{"text":"I always go back to yard house because its just quality. 

i met up with some friends and it was just phenomenal. 
immediately upon arrival the staff is always super friendly. Trey, helped me find my friends who were already seated and was gracious enough to help me because cell service isn't the best inside. 
then our server, Giambrone... who's name i will definitely misspelled,  he was the absolute best. His recommendations for the street tacos were the best and he said that his girlfriend, also an amazing server Alannah i believe, recommended and enjoyed the same choices. i got the shrimp, fish and korean bbq? i think, they were all fire! My water glass was always full without hesitation and he was on top of his game! talk about extreme customer service. He also managed to recommend some excellent drinks for my friends and myself too. these small things are the reasons that make you want to come back again and again."}
{"text":"Friday evening so I called ahead and got on the waiting list. Over the phone they told me it would be about 40 minutes. Once I fought the redrock Parking situation (as I expected for a weekend) my wife and I made our way  to the restaurant. We got there about 35 min from making the phone call and still waited for additional 20 min. Nothing surprises me anymore,   frankly I just give my self time for these type of situations.  Anyways my wife and I sat out on the patio. We did not have any alcoholic beverages so I think are waiter was a bit annoyed bye that. ( keep the  bill low=small tip)   My wife ordered the vampire tacos and I ordered the Cuban sandwich.  Both were amazing and would definitely order it again. Our waiter did check on us a few times and made sure our ice teas were topped off.  All and all I would definitely recommend this joint and will return. The happy hour menu looks reasonable too"}
{"text":"Pretty good food, and the beer selection can't be beat!  I just think that they should offer Happy Hour on Sunday evenings (the place was dead, so why not?)--also, the beers aren't very reasonably priced....most were at least $6.50 (or more) for a standard pint.  I understand some of the beers are imported, rare, or whatever, but have some beers in the $5 range (besides Bud--yuck!)."}
{"text":"We''ve been to the Yard House several times, for a snack, lunch and dinner, and it's usually because of convenience rather than as a specific destination.  We're not beer drinkers, so if you're reading for an opinion on the beer, this review will disappoint you!

I'm waivering between giving this place a two or three star review.  Two because it is so loud, if you go with people, you can't hear the conversation over the other people and the TVs blasting the games.  Three because the food is decent, nothing fancy, and maybe a little over-priced.  But, they have a huge vegetarian selection on the menu.  

Favorite picks -- the lettuce wraps with the shiitake and portobello mushrooms, the Chinese Garlic Noodles, the Chicken Garlic Noodles, and the burgers.  The fries that come with sandwiches and burgers are delightfully thin and crispy, and plentiful!  I tried a new Martini this weekend and I'd give it an A++ -- Black Orchid . . . full of flavor, not too sweet, and definitely not on the shy side with the vodka!

Yardhouse at Desert Ridge is a great place for pre- or post-movie dining.  The patio seating is great for people-watching on a beautiful day. The wait on the weekends is tolerable.  The servers are friendly, although the pacing of the meal can be rather quick.  Fine dining, it ain't, but what it does, it does without any major hiccups."}
{"text":"Love the selection of hard cider!! The Ahi Tuna Nachos appetizers were fantastic but not spicy enough!! My BF had Ahi Burger with Garlic Fries and I the Grilled Cheese and Tomato Bisque. Both excellent! Our server was also extremely nice and pleasant!!"}
{"text":"I reserved for a birthday party at this location for the first time, this past Saturday. From the front door to the end of our visit, service was awful. Our waiter, Chris, i believe his name appeared BOTHERED by everything we asked for at the table. We ordered drinks and the martini that i ordered was barely half full but when I pointed it out, it was as if \"I\" did something wrong. I called to complain to the Manager, who we met that evening. Though he is very nice and mentioned what they all stand for and how service \"should be\", I was offered nothing as a result of what turned out to be a HORRIBLE experience. I will never go to this location again where EVERY person that I experienced working there that night, besides the Manager, appeared angry to be there or unhappy. NO thank you. 

M Hannah"}
{"text":"Safe to say I will not be going back to this location. I spit out a dead maggot from my artichoke appetizer. The waiter took the dish away and didn't charge us for it but no one came to apologize or anything. So disgusted.
Also, our reservation was for 7:30 and due to overbooking we didn't get seated until 8:30"}
{"text":"This place is overrated! But its easy for that to happen with such a huge beer selection. The one good thing is that there are more beers than you could ever possibly choose from. However, the service was lacking as well as the food! Overpriced for the quality! Good-luck getting your beer!"}
{"text":"We had so much fun here last night! In vegas I don't know many places to go to the has the beer choices I like. I live in San Diego so I am used to being spoiled by great beer options everywhere i go. I always know I'll enjoy something at the yardhouse tho! They have amazing options and always has some ballast point which I love my sculpin! It was my birthday and all I wanted my my liquid crack which is that hoppy beauty!

The service was great, bar tenders were super interactive and fun. There was a new bar tender, it was his first day and he is already great at interactions. I had a lot of fun! 

For food too yardhouse is fantastic. I always get burgers but all the food we got was great. My friend loved her beef dip so much that she was telling the people next to us they need to order it too."}
{"text":"Their New York Steak Sammich is the ultimate sea.Mich eating experiance .. It may sound crazy but get a side of maple syrup for the sweet potato fries.. its delightful.."}
{"text":"Good service with a great craft beer selection that in not ridiculously priced (It's still Vegas Strip prices). Good mix of people, quite a few TVs, and great 80's music with the original videos made for a quite entertaining night. We will be back."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar to watch the Fiesta Bowl with snacks and drinks. Everything was very good. And many other dishes we saw come out of the kitchen looked great--especially the clubs. Very attentive bar staff"}
{"text":"Went here twice in a month. Both times food was great but the service wasn't so good. The first time the waiter was rude and didn't even acknowledge us for 20 minutes and then we paid the bill with a giftcard and he almost kept the giftcard! (it still had a balance on it.) we had to ask him for it back which we shouldn't have to do. Both times though it took forever for the food to come out. I ordered the lunch special (pizza and tomato bisque.) and both times half of the tomato bisque was spilled on my plate. I just think this yard house just needs to weave out there bad waiters and they will be fine!"}
{"text":"I really like the yardhouse. They have great happy hour and the staff is always pretty friendly. The only thing on the menu that I would not recommend is the jerk chicken pasta. It had no flavor and I was not happy with it."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Have a great vegetarian menu as well! I prefer this location over the Town Square one. Not overpriced for a restaurant on the strip and great selection of beer. Definitely a must try!!"}
{"text":"Our visit to Yard House today was quite disappointing. Our appetizers came out with our meal and there were shells in the lobster Mac and cheese. This just isn't the service we expect from Yard House. The only reason I have two stars instead of one is because the manager was very quick to apologize for the food coming out together and adjusted our bill."}
{"text":"Their food is so inconsistent. Stick to the appetizers and beer, you at least can't go wrong with those 2 things."}
{"text":"We stop here every visit. I really enjoy the Nashville chicken sandwich. It's not over seasoned and the slaw gives it some sweetness that plays off the sandwich itself. My wife loves the brussel sprouts but was disappointed with the lobster Mac and cheese. Lots of adult beverages to choose from although they were out of the peanut butter stout I wanted to try."}
{"text":"I have been a regular at this Yard House for years but today service we horrible & they weren't even busy.  We waited at least 15 minutes before ANY waiter/waitress came over and that was because we alerted the hostess that we had been sitting there waiting to be greeted.  Then my friend ordered a coke and got a diet coke.  Then my food (mushu pork egg rolls) were cold when they finally arrived.  The waitress failed refill our drinks until we sat there with empty cups for quite some time.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch for my mom's birthday. The food and serves was Great! 
I would go back again. We had salads, to burgers and everyone was very happy with what they got. We also got a a yummy treat for her birthday and it was very good!."}
{"text":"We came here tonight for a night out with some good friends for dinner. Encountered a great dinner and even better service from the staff. Hats off to Bri & Ashley for the attentive service! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"We visited the Yard House for the first time today for lunch. We arrived at 11:45AM & were surprised to see how chaotic it was to get seated. After about a 5 minute wait, we were seated. Then we waited another 10 minutes before our server even appeared at our table!  The place wasn't even busy so we had no idea why the delays - not off to a good start.

Can't talk about the beer - all 113 varities of them - none of us drank beer. We all had soda or ice tea, at $3 a glass, a small glass I might add, we thought it was too high a price. Yes they have free refills, but when the wait service was so slow, our glasses were empty until we could flag down our waiter & ask for that refill, none came from the waiter unasked for.

They have a large menu, lots of variety. Price wise, a bit high for the portions, and the dinner items ranged on average from $15 to $35 for an entree. 3 of us had a 1/2 sandwich & soup - all were very good. I had the chicken tortilla soup- for an extra $1.95, the other soups were no extra, which was excellent. Our 4th party had a salad with chicken in it which she said was dried out.  

Would I go back?  Perhaps I would give this place another try, maybe we just hit them on an off day. However, if they have too many off days, they won't be in business long!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed Happy Hour the other evening while engaging in a short business meeting. We really had excellent service (Sal was our bartender) and excellent food. The Ahi Wontons and BBQ chicken pizza will definitely be a re-order on our next visit. Very large bar area, but we felt very comfortable and were well taken care of. Our waiter and bartender were genuinely interested in our food choices and were very knowledgeable of the menu. We will return and bring friends!"}
{"text":"The food here is always good and service spot on.  A great place to grab a drink or a meal.  This is one of my favorite places to meet friends to catch up and have a great time."}
{"text":"I've been to this place several times and its rather hit and miss. The chicken fried chicken is seriously one of the best I've ever had (and I was raised in Texas) but the Mac and cheese was greasy and gross. Their beer is great but don't buy a cocktail, they are all ice and seriously weak. Truth be told, if I'm going to be eating in town square I'd rather eat cheaper and buy something or get drunk. 

It's very crowded on the weekends and not worth the wait. Also, the pizza tastes like cheap dijiorno. 

Tl;dr; food's overrated, beer great. Not worth line."}
{"text":"very nice atmosphere and broad menu. You can find anything for anyone! I had a great salad, but the few fries I stole were great too!"}
{"text":"Ate out with my family. Service was great, soo much beer selection. Food was great and came out to our table within few minutes. I also tried my parties other food. It was excellent!

Only thing i didn't like was my black truffle burger, it lacked flavor. I ordered medium rare and they gave me rare instead."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here for a nice night of casual drinks and light dinner. They have a great food selection on the menu as well as a great variety of drinks!! It is a long way to drive from me so my friends and I try to meet up once every couple of months and it is always spot on."}
{"text":"I've been there a few times because it's a decent place to go. 

Their happy hour is pretty decent. The food on their happy hour is actually exceptional. The drink specials, not so much.

This time I did the club sandwich and was happy with it. The portion sizes are large enough that there was actually some food to take home which I love.

I'll be back."}
{"text":"Good beer but this is how my pot pie was boxed.

{"text":"Love this place, they have around 50 beers on tap. Great customer service and the atmosphere is perfect.  There is all areas to sit at bar seating, booths, outside tables.  Plenty of space. The food is awesome we had the ahi nachos & it was amazing we also had the lobster crab artichoke dip.  We only ate appetizers but I saw a lot of amazing dishes go by.  I would for sure go here again on my next visit.  Plus the location has a bunch to see shops & gambling.  Right by High roller attraction."}
{"text":"Great food, good service, good beer & wine selection.  The Yard House doesn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink before our movie next door.  Yard house how I love your drink and beer selection and all your tempting appetizers!

We were seated in a booth inside- it was pretty busy at 6:30pm on Wednesday.  My husband was distracted by the sound of the door to the patio- the closing mechanism is not working correctly.

I usually get the Papago orange blossom or a skinny margarita but this time I try the salted watermelon margarita.  It looks great but I should have known better than to order anything with pucker!  It was a perfect koolaid experience for a college girl- not my sophisticated 30 year old self.

My husbands Moscow mule was in point and he enjoys trying different variations.

For appetizers we had the guacamole and coconut shrimp.  Kiera our server was nice to let us know that the chopped salad had no lettuce- and she could add some for us?  We stuck with the shrimp & guac instead.

The coconut shrimp is 3 jumbo butterflied fried coconut yumminess.  This appetizer is served with a sweet chili sauce and a green cilantro aioli which are both yummy.

The guacamole was nice and cold served with both white & blue corn chips.

Our server Kiera seemed like a nice girl but was not as experienced as some servers at yard house.  She lost timing at the end after we've gotten our food & waiting for dessert and check. Sometimes it could be helpful for the servers maybe to ask customers if they are seeing a movie to notice if they may be on a timeline.

We will be back!"}
{"text":"My best girl friend and I met up here Tuesday night around 7:30 for drinks & dinner.  Seriously too bad she's on the west side because it's nothing but fattening chain restaurants!!

We got the skinny margaritas first off which were pretty good- made with fresh lime & 1800 silver.  Also the pear and Gorgonzola flatbread was a no- go for us.  We thought it sounded good but 1 bite in I'm like \"this is not what I expected even though I didn't know what to expect!\"

For mains she got the gardenia (faux chicken) Thai noodle salad and I had the Greek salad, which my friend got last time and said it was \"vinegary\".  It sounded good still but I totally agree the acidity was too much for me.  I also got the short rib street taco which was decent and saved my first 2 courses.

We shared the mini chocolate soufflé at the end which was a nice light cake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

Our server was Torii and he was courteous, timely, and accurate."}
{"text":"Love the Yard House in CA, and this location is no exception. Everything is great, from the short wait, vast menu, good service, and great food. There's a large vegan menu, and they're very accommodating with gluten-free wishes. The truffle fries are not to be missed!  My husband loved the nachos and prime rib, while my son enjoyed nachos and Mac and cheese.  Great experience and great, off strip location."}
{"text":"I am trying to practice the vegan lifestyle and there are usually limited choices. I usually do not like to eat fake meats and cheeses that are dairy or animal free. I tried the gardein Orange peel meal instead of chicken and I was pretty impressed. The only thing is the entree could have been a little warmer. It was not hot. The gardein did not have that processed taste. The sauce was flavorful. I also had the spicy edamame and mixed greens. I would reccommend trying if you like orange peel chicken but do not eat meat like me."}
{"text":"Yard House is a good go-to place for meeting and hanging out with friends. The drinks are reasonably priced.

Happy hour is M-F 3-6 PM, and Sun-Wed 10PM-1AM where a lot of their dishes are in the $5-8 range and drinks are even more reasonably priced.

I always go with friends and try a variety of their dishes. Their ahi poke bowl is decent although there are probably better poke places around Vegas, but it's decent for a bar. Thei fried calamari is always on point. I can never complain about good calamari. I've tried some of their lettuce wraps and they're all pretty good. If you're watching your sodium intake, some of their seasoned meats can tip you over the edge if you're not careful.

They have a wide selection of drinks available and I have a good time trying out different brews.

Their staff is friendly and mostly attentive although they can become forgetful if business becomes busy. However their staff should take their breaks away from public since some of their staff become rowdy when on break in front of the restaurant.

Overall the Yard House at Town Square is a good experience and you won't be disappointed to hang out with friends there."}
{"text":"I always tell myself that the service I get before I get my food, will set the mood and taste of the meal. I knew today I'd be enjoying a great meal with the service we received at this location!
First off, Jesse(the host) was sooo very kind and respectful. As soon as I walked in the door he had a smile on his face,stopped his conversation and greeted me. The table he was told to put me at wasn't ideal for me..sorry but I'm short and I don't want to see at a lower booth. So with out hesitation he placed me in a better spot.
As soon as I sat down, our server ...Zach.. I believe was there to get myself and my guest waters while I waited for her. Once she arrived he gave us just enough time to look over the menu so that we could enjoy the happy hour!  He helped me remember a dish that is now \"off the menu\" and made sure that it was exactly what I was talking about.
Garlic chicken noodles .... try it.. it's amazing.
Food tastes amazing. His humor and personality through our whole stay was nothing but amazing and we appreciated it!
Yardhouse isn't usually the first place I think of to go to but my experience today has definitely put them right there in my top 3!"}
{"text":"Really good and friendly service. Plus the food is great!
I tried the clam chowder and the california roll. The california roll has a different look than traditional one but it was good looking and tastes really good!"}
{"text":"The service was exceptional, and the food was soooooooooooooo delicious. Everyone enjoyed their meal, and promised to make another trip to the Yard House inside of the Red Rock Casino Resort very soon. We had a table out on the patio with Two huge flat screen TVs facing us and I was able to enjoy the Lakers last game of the season .. YES !! sorry I'm not a Lakers fan at all.  All in all I'm rating my experience , the food , the service of all wait staff/host, and the view 5 stars. This would be a great place to take someone that is from out of town or just a place to come chill/hang with some friends and catch up."}
{"text":"Yes, they have a lot of beers on tap and that's why I gave it 2 stars. Otherwise, food was not good and the service was awful. Unless your going for the draft beer I would skip yard house. There are tons of restaurants in the area with better food, better service and beer on tap."}
{"text":"Go for the beer! My dad recommended this place for the 100 draft beers! Visiting from Ohio I thought the selection was very diverse and new to me. I ordered the Thai Chicken Noodle Salad and tasted like coke slaw. Wouldn't recommend that in the menu!"}
{"text":"12/14/2015 - visited during happy hour to try the appetizers on special. We were seated in a booth in the bar area. Lots of great tvs for viewing sporting events. Beer list was top notch and the specials during happy hour were pretty good for a place on/near the strip. Tried the moo shu egg rolls, vampire tacos, and traditional firecracker wings. All were very good except the moo shu egg rolls. Crispy on the outside but mushy and not the flavor we were expecting. Recommend trying the vampire tacos and the wings were large and only $6.

We enjoyed our experience except the wait staff made us feel like we needed to rush out. I wasn't ever asked if I wanted a second beer and after the waiter gave us the check and said no rush he came back 5 times in about 15 minutes to see if we were ready to pay. What if I was going to stay for the Monday night game? I was ready to but took the rest of my business to another establishment."}
{"text":"The beer selection is great. The food is good. However there is a problem. You go to the bar, and ask for a beer. Before the bartender even makes a move to get it, he demands payment! Cash or credit, and if its credit card, he demands that they keep your card behind the bar!
When you point out that you haven't even had a sip yet, and they are demanding payment in full , they say its their policy.
At any other (non corporate) bar, this would be the height of insulting unfriendliness. In addition, most cards have high limits (I think mine is 20k) . So if I were a thief, they would be on the hook for a few beers, but if anyone in their bar is dishonest, I'm on the hook for 20k!
Whom is working for whom here? And why am I being treated like a thief?"}
{"text":"Excellent service. Very delicious Ribeye with shrimp. Atmosphere was perfect, very relaxing and friendly.  the dessert trio was excellent as well."}
{"text":"It's pricy but the quality of the food is worth every penny. I just love to get a salad but I must say, the steak served at this place is the BEST I ever tried anywhere! Also, you can't get enough of the truffle fries..."}
{"text":"So many things went wrong when we went there yesterday.
1. Once our server sold us on the beer samples he stopped paying any attention to our table. Yes, we get it, you LOVE the beer samples but I am pretty sure your job does not end once you convince us to try them.
2. He forgot our sweet potato fries. Since they were not on the menu I asked if they had them, he said yes. So, it was not that he did not hear the order. Granted we all make mistakes, but there was no apology. 
3. The fries were comped... good thing too since they were the greasiest and most burnt sweet potato fries ever encountered. Oh and I must not forget, they came with a mysterious piece of something gross fried with them. YUCK!
4. If everyone loves your tomato bisque and you even have a grilled cheese and tomato bisque menu item, you should probably make LOTS of it on December 26. You know, if you are located in a mall full of people returning their Christmas gifts..... JUST A THOUGHT
5. So you have tons of beer on tap, but really so do other places. Lucky for the rest of us, these other places also try to have good service.

Won't be back....Unless I have a craving for nasty fries and suspicious fried \"blobs\". DOUBTFUL"}
{"text":"Talk about a beer lovers heaven. Can you say 150 beers on tap? I can't hear you! Well, if that doesn't sell you then the diverse menu options are sure to. And if you still aren't convinced, imagine big delicious portions and an amazingly generous happy hour menu. Two friends and I recently enjoyed a late evening dining experience: Chicken Nachos, Margherita Pizza, Bernaise Sliders, Tomato Bisque, 2 beers and a martini = under $50 with tip. 

Great atmosphere and plenty of TVs for those who want less conversation and more game time. When the weather is nice, grab a seat outdoors and enjoy some people watching. Even when the weather isn't so nice (just for a few short months in Las Vegas) there are conveniently located outdoor heaters, as in they are out of your way and you won't burn yourself after stumbling out because you sampled all 150 beers.

To my not-so-crazy-about-beer-people: take it from someone who doesn't care for beer. Do you like juice? Carbonation perhaps? I highly recommend giving the Lidemans Framboise or Strawberry Fruli a try. I promise you won't even notice its beer. If that doesn't work out Yardhouse has a great selection of mixed drinks and martinis. Try the Gobbstopper Martini or the Black Orchid Martini. 

And remember people: always drink responsibly :)"}
{"text":"As long as you know what type of food to expect here, it can be a fun place to stop in before heading over to the movies.  Happy hour specials are good, though I wish portions weren't quite so enormous.  Note to self, just because it's half-priced, doesn't mean you need to order twice as much.
Service has been friendly both times I have visited."}
{"text":"Great food and great service!! We had the happy hour nachos. They come on a platter! Be ready to share. We set at the bar and never wanted for anything. The staff is truly amazing. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Food here is for the most part pretty good.  A couple dishes I could totally do without, but they are few and far between.  The chicken penne pasta and the mac n cheese are pretty darn good. Seared ahi and crab dip are delicious.  Pizzas and pastrami sliders are yummy. Crab cakes are pretty disappointing as is the fruit cobbler.  The ice cream sundae and chocolate souffle (even though it shrunk by 75% in the past 2 years) are winners in my book.  Beer selection is vast and the martinis are awesome.

I really only try to go here for happy hour though because a girls night out or a date on non happy hour prices can get pretty damn expensive pretty fast, especially for a chain restaurant in a mall."}
{"text":"I really want to love this place.  i love beer, and they are definitely a mecca for that.  the food however falls a little short.  it's good for corporate bar offerings, but execution is inconsistent.  the pizza always seems to be too wet, so the crust is soggy.  the poke is good, but they left the silver skin on so i've got to spit some out.  the crab cakes are a pillar of mediocrity - fried to death and hidden by some mango sweet relish.  the beers deliver, great place to watch a game, and happy hour is very good.  you can get great beer and REAL food elsewhere tho, if you're willing to look around."}
{"text":"This was a late night visit. 11pm. Our appetizer was really good - lobster, crab and artichoke dip with baked pita. So yummy! I had the blackened swordfish street tacos. They were delicious.  Too bad our server, David O. was more concerned with doing his sidework trying to get out of the restaurant instead of paying attention to his patrons. He even brought 2 refills of drinks so he didn't need to check on us again. Unfortunately,  he brought the wrong refill. Hopefully,  others get better attended to than we did."}
{"text":"I have gotten good service in the past, but today it was horrible.
Waited 35 minutes for a table.
Asked how long, \"was given 15-25 minutes\"
I asked if I am going to make it for \"happy hours:.
Vanessa informed me \"it might just be a couple of minutes.  We have 3 guess ahead of you.\"
At this time it was 549pm.
I asked again, \"Am I going to make it for happy hours\"
Vanessa replied, \"it going to be a couple of minutes\"

Ok Vanessa. You failed to answer my question.
Please dont give me a run-about response. Just a \"Yes\" or \"No\"

She turned her attention to another guest... How about finishing the conversation you are having with me, before you address another guess. Improve on your interpersonal skills Vanessa."}
{"text":"One of the best place for bar food.
Vampire Taco
Chicken Nachos
Chicken Strips
Mushroom Pizza..
Sliders.
Ahhh. Great food for the money. Friendly staff.
Would return"}
{"text":"This place is great for a nice meal! My husband and I truly enjoyed the atmosphere and the great food! Our waitress was super sweet and was very tentative to our table, the best service that we have had in a while! This is a restaurant that we will be coming back to again and again."}
{"text":"Attentive, pro waitress, high quality food, wide range of draft beer and afternoon specials. Some TVs for the sports fans.  

Expensive, so recommend visiting during 'happy hour' and just order from the limited appetizer menu.

Learned the hard way that this restaurant does not accept meal credits given by the resort."}
{"text":"Great place to stop while shopping in Town Square. The deep fried cheese curds were about the best I've ever had. I look forward to a return visit soon."}
{"text":"Not a bad place.  Cool bar and beers.
Went during happy hour and made a meal of sliders, wings, California roll and garlic noodles.  Everything was good and it was too much to finish."}
{"text":"Great beer selection! Great food! Gotta try the ipa beer flight! Must have. Apps are good and filling!"}
{"text":"I've had casual lunches here many times.  The food is good, reasonable, with a very pleasant atmosphere.  Service is usually good, depending on the server, varied drink &lunch specials.  It can be a little noisy, but it's in a shopping center and gets great traffic.  It has booths,  which I like, tables and a bar.

 I'd recommend it without reservation."}
{"text":"Of course the beer selection is great, so are the salads.  The service is pretty inconsistent.  Your experience here really depends on which server you get.  Sometimes we can have the best server and everything falls into place.  But boy oh boy,  when you get that one person who just doesn't want to be there, it can either break your experience or you can choose to allow it to entertain you.  My girlfriend and I decided we would be ducks and let it roll off our backs.  It's usually at this location, the service at the Town Square location is so much better."}
{"text":"Decent food, served quickly, but feels like run-of-mill menu for yet another restaurant trying to place itself in the lower hit end category. They have a good beer selection.

Had crab cakes that seemed hurried, but well executed. No big chunks of crab, but dressed up with a dressing that was too sweet. Crab cakes without chunks ranks just above the fast-food scale for me, and these were a gray conglomerate inside."}
{"text":"Great selection.... Almost too many choices but samplers are available. Brews are fresh & cold.  Bartenders are crafty &  knowledgeable.  Happy hour prices can't be beat!  We'll be back! :)"}
{"text":"Food is alright. The items we ordered were \"RIB EYE & SHRIMP*
(12oz) spinach-corn-mashed potatoes, grilled tomato, broccolini, house made steak sauce\" for $32.65 and \"PENNE WITH CHICKEN
mushrooms, asparagus, sun-dried tomatoes, marsala cream sauce, parmesan\" for $11.95; all tasty. Stake was tender, shrimp were nicely done as well, and penne had creamy but not heavy sauce.  Was this food something we'll crave to come back for - no; but, it tasted good."}
{"text":"Worst ever asked manager about sauce on Brussels sprouts if it was vegan with confident yes I ordered comes out with mayo on them. Took 15 min to get kids ice cream. Just awful service  
They did apologize but still if you have 2hours to kill for lunch then it would be a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Only reason I went here was because the wife and her friends wanted to meet here. Nothing special about the food or drinks. Service was brutal and unattentive. Mirror image of the Desert Ridge store, overpriced chain restaurant."}
{"text":"We went Friday night and it was a good fun-filled atmosphere. I tried the House Blond Beer which was good (I'm not much of a beer drinker so that's saying alot). The lettuce wraps were delicious and the Maui Pineapple chicken was tasty. The only downside was they don't do the reverse happy hour at this location. If I knew that I would've went to the Town Square location - assuming they still do.."}
{"text":"Took the wife for her birthday.  Been many times in past.  We took advantage of happy hour specials.  We had four appetizers between the two of us and dessert.  We had a beautiful and very nice waitress, Kylie.  No complaints on food or our waitress.  Only question we had that is still not answered is that we ordered two Green Flash Le Freek pints.  I repeat pints.  We were served two 12 oz goblets.  We questioned our waitress about the difference and she said that was the way they served it from the bar.  It's not really a happy hour deal if it isn't the pint we ordered.  Happy with meal and service, unhappy about bar discrepancy.   ???????
Four appetizers, two deserts, four beers, $80.00 with tip.  A tad expensive for happy hour."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite restaurant of all time. The atmosphere (dim lighting, classic rock playing over head) is a perfect mixture of classy and laid back. The food is amazing! This is one place where I try something different almost every time because I know I can't go wrong! And of course, with all of the brews, it's a beer drinker's heaven."}
{"text":"I have been to yard house for business meetings, family outings and with colleagues for a beer.  They do have an astonishing array of beers on tap.  It is fun to seek out ones from Europe that you rarely find here even in bottles.

On to the food...

I like the food an variety here.  I have eaten from the appetizer menu only, had sandwiches, pizza and salads.  I can recoomend the Poke Stack, the Koren Ribs, and the eggrolls.  The Ahi salad is also excellent.  Try the french dip for more mainstream fare.

It gets busy on weekends but weekdays it is easy to get a seat.  They also do an ecellent tea service in a real pot and they have some non typical selections."}
{"text":"Great vibe, great food and yummy drinks! Great hangout any night of the week. Definitely recommend the French onion soup! Also the gorgonzola burger with garlic fries and the grilled cheese with tomato bisque!"}
{"text":"Fun place to sit and have a few beers before the games at Jobing arena.  The people watching from the patio area is pretty darn great.  Wide selection of beers and appetizers.  Pretty good selection of happy hour items.  The service can be a little hit or miss, but generally pretty good."}
{"text":"Sadly, I think we should have read more of the reviews before we chose to eat here tonight. The main good point about this place is the view onto the Linq (High Roller) promenade. The food is just average and that's being polite. My husband ordered a craft beer and at $9.25,  for 6 ounces, it came with too much of a head. My husband mentioned this to the waitstaff and one of the bartenders came by and my husband explained that a similar beer in Ireland has the head removed and then topped off again.
My husband ordered the lobster garlic noodles with a French onion soup as a starter. He said the soup was OK. The noodle dish was tasty but the plate it was served on was cold. I ordered a Margherita  pizza and a classic Caesar salad. The salad was fine, just average, and met expectations. The pizza Arrived on it's metal pan barely lukewarm. When the waitress arrived to check on us I showed that to her and she took it back and said that they would make a totally new one for us. It came in about 10 minutes. It was, speaking charitably, just adequate. 

The waitstaff was continually friendly and frequently checked on us -- so they get kudos for that.
What we really enjoyed was sitting right on a covered patio adjacent to the Linq promenade. It was fun to watch the parade of people. That's the best part of this Yard House. And I would say it's the only reason to go. Well, we did it once but we would not go back nor would I recommend it."}
{"text":"Had a couple of gift cards to use at Yard House and some friends had recommended it, so we finally gave it a shot. Saturday night, and seated outside right away instead of a 45-50 min. wait. We were a bit warm, (fans could have helped as misters weren't,) but we were glad to be outside after seeing how noisy and dark it was inside. Definitely more of a bar atmosphere than a restaurant. 

Service was pretty good. Menu was extensive and eventually we decided. We ordered a lobster, artichoke dip that was very tasty, and each had a burger; she had the Hawaiian, and I the lamb burger. Burgers were cooked to order and came with a choice of fries; we upgraded to garlic fries and onion rings, each a dollar extra. Garlic fries were good, and onion rings were cooked well, but bland, neither worth any extra money. Burgers were juicy, but served very plain, only two pickle slices on the side and no other veggies. 

Overall, not worth the price, and not a great atmosphere, unless you're in to hanging out at a bar when you're trying to enjoy dinner. Price per person was at the high end of Yelp's \"moderate,\" especially considering we didn't do desert, and only water and a tea for beverages. Probably into the spendy category for most. Not sure why only moderate average, especially with all the beer available. Maybe many are only having drinks. We likely won't be back for quite a while. Too many other places we enjoy, especially for a burger."}
{"text":"This place always satisfy everyone's palette. So many selections on food & beer. Choices from small plates to big plates. I always forget to take picture as when the food gets to the table. We all dive in. My new fave here now is the shitake garlic noodles. Small plate but it is enough for me."}
{"text":"So I usually come in here and it's amazing. we Usually ask for Donnie we found out he got fired. he was awesome. we had this server named kate. She had no personality. Any we found a dead roach in out food. so late got the manager and she action g like a total bitch. She was very rude and very bitchy. we had a problem once with a piece of hair in my soup. Jason took care of us was so nice."}
{"text":"Great location near the mall in a lovely area of Scotsdale. Loved the large craft brew selection. This would be a great happy hour. 
The lighting is VERY dark, and based on the music, this place isn't geared toward the 20somethings. So it was funny when my whole table took out their iPhones and used their flashlights to peruse the menu! At one point, the waitress held someone's phone so my companion could hold the menu at a particular angle. Fun stuff.
Huge menu and selection of food that came out VERY quickly. Loved my Southern fried chicken but loved even more the mashed taters/spinach/corn concoction.  Selected the trio sampler for dessert and was pleased with the yummy and unique selection. The lemon souffle rocks."}
{"text":"OMG...what a amazine place and AMAZINE DEAL they have at HH.... even ahi tuna is at happy hour.... which is perfectly seared..and the pizza,and the wings(asked for plain with no sauce,came out perfect and golden color...way better then buffalo wild wings),and the ONION RING TOWER....makes me hungry just by talking about it....imma go there now...and our server jennifer had been really helpful"}
{"text":"I would recommend this restaurant. The service was EXCELLENT! Our waitress, Shanna is an adorable, very personable and very efficient person! We've been there many time but first time Shanna was our waitress. Extremely polite, knowledgable and very friendly. She had other tables but never failed to make sure we didn't need anything.
Made our visit much nicer. Our food was very GOOD. We will return very soon, and ask to sit in Shanna's section!"}
{"text":"7 of us and no one can say anything but ,  damn this is good stuff.  Recommend for everyone to try this place."}
{"text":"Simply amazing!  The food is quite tasty, the ambiance is wonderful, and the selection of beer and other liquors is better and more diverse than any that I've ever seen.  If you are looking for a wonderful place to enjoy a good meal go no further because you've found it right here ... Congratulations !"}
{"text":"Horrible service, waitress forget our order after we waited for about 35 minutes. Dont go there. spend your money somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Just had the most tantalizing tasty lunch.  Started with the Ahi Poke Stacks, I had the Steak Salad, and my husband had the Fish and Chips with Garlic fries.   Most definitely one of the best lunches we've had together in a while."}
{"text":"Great place, for it was here that I finally found a beer to call my own: Lost Coast Great White and it is delicious in a tall half-yard glass.

Shiitake Mushroom off the Snack section of the menu is great for the price.

Bernaise Sliders were surprisingly a favorite of mine but a recent visit revealed to me \"they are not served that way anymore\" as stated by the waitress that night.

The steak I get from time to time done medium-rare is great, Ahi Sashimi and Coconut Shrimp with their accompanying spicy papaya salad is always a plus.

Finally can't argue with the overall look and feel of the place: flat-screens everywhere for whatever sport you're into and a bar ready to serve you with over 100 beers on tap.

Only reason for the lack of a 5th star was the most recent visit feels as if the place recent underwent 'restructuring' of some kind. Either the Chef(s) got replaced or left and the menu actually went from the large book of at least 7 pages that I'm used to seeing, to a double sided menu with WAY less items which usually denotes a smaller kitchen staff in most cases, my bernaise sliders being gone from the menu was what tipped me off to something happening recently.

As a result of whatever may have caused this, the Shiitake Mushroom noodles that I order on occasion has a way different texture than what I was accustomed to and did not enjoy it as much as I usually do the last time I visited. Maybe I'll ask the next time I'm there to see what really went down if it's at all possible to get an answer.

Overall it's a great place to relax and dine or enjoy a few snack items and a beer to go along with it. Definitely a place to visit on occasion."}
{"text":"Nothing bad or great to report. In fact, it's not very memorable. The service was OK. They forgot my mashed potatoes and I had to ask for it.  A huge restaurant with a ton of things to order on the menu. My steak was OK and a bit on the dry side. I don't really see myself returning."}
{"text":"I've always been a big fan of Yard house since the first opening in Town Square and Happy Hour specials. Monday-Friday: 3pm-6pm and Sunday-Wednesday:10pm-close. Now that they've opened up in Red Rock Casino, its even better! The restaurant has much more space than town square with higher ceilings and bigger outdoor patio seating. Not to mention flat screen TVs around to watch them sports. 

The food here is great. These are my top picks on the Appetizer menu:
Fried Calamari** (I'm a typical Filipina so you cannot NOT try calamari).
Hawaiian Poke Stack** (De-lish! It's fresh ahi with crispy wontons, carrots, bean sprouts, avocado, and wasabi soy sauce).
Spicy Tuna Roll ** (This is not a cut roll. This is like one round giant roll. But yummy. Has seared rare ahi, avocado, edamame, cucumber, and the wasabi soy sauce). 

My favorite Entree salad is the Ahi Crunchy. It has seared rare ahi, Asian slaw, field greens, crispy wontons mixed in soy vinaigrette. I feel like I could go on forever on all the yummy entrees they have. They have everything from burgers to steaks, to pastas and seafood dishes. Which is a plus for me because I need OPTIONS, so having selections to choose from, I can pick depending on my mood of the day.

I am so glad that Yard House is much more closer to me, even for locals in the Summerlin area. I don't have to drive to Town Square and worry about the annoying one lane conversion once you exit Las Vegas Blvd off the 215. GIVE ME A SNAKE BITE PLEASE!!!"}
{"text":"I enjoy coming to Yard House! I've never heard about it until they opened it here in Las Vegas @ Town Square. Perfect location too!  And then to find out they have locations all over california too. Go figure. 

The food is awesome. I tried from salads to pastas to burgers to sushi...and its amazing. The happy hour is the best!! I've ordered a lot from the happy hour menu that can feed 4 people or more and our bill was a pretty good deal for the amount of food we've ordered. 

I like that Yard House has the outdoor area with MISTERS for the summer because we all know how HOT vegas gets!! The service is really friendly and helpful too. And as a tip for fun! What my friends and I do on a \"night out\" we hit up Yard House first for happy hour drinks and then head to BLUE MARTINI upstairs to dance the night away! I never get disappointed."}
{"text":"The food is a typical mainstream American smorgasbord. You might get lost in the menu but that's ok because whatever you order will be decent enough. Not stellar. But decent. The best part about this place is their ridiculous beer selection. I don't care who you are, you will learn something about craft brew here and you will certainly find options you've never tried. A tad over priced for what you get."}
{"text":"We've been there twice now.  They have an interesting and eclectic menu, and everything we've tried so far has been excellent.  I had the Southern Fried Chicken Breast, which was really yummy comfort food.  I also tried the Pepper crusted Filet - the filet was very good, cooked exactly as I ordered it, very tender and flavorful.  The mashed potatoes & veggie was also very good.  My brother tried the Carnitas Street Tacos one time, and the Chicken Enchilada Stack another time - and he said they were both excellent as well.  The service was very nice as well - the staff were all friendly and waited on us right away.  The food arrived promptly, and the server checked back often.  Looks like a great place for Happy Hour as well, with a very large bar - a great place for drinks and they have a large selection of small plates, snacks and appetizers."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat in Vegas! This place really can't be missed. The food is amazing, I have never had anything that wasn't good. I end up getting  the same burger almost every time the \"Pepper Crusted Gorgonzola Burger\", after eating this you will never look at burgers the same. One word to sum up the place \"Truffle Fries\" you have to get these, I promise your life will not be the same after."}
{"text":"so i've got my boss and the prez of the company in town - they like beer, no strike that, they LOVE beer  yet, not into the high-end eateries ( damn !  was hoping for a freeloading meal at some of my fav foo-foo spots on the Strip ) 
I suggested Yardhouse - told them they've got about 100 beers on tap - i felt the breeze as they ran past me to get into their rental car - ok, beer it is !
I've been to several Yardhouse's in so cal  - this one is on par with the Newport Beach Yardhouse - the place is HOPPIN !  Good thing my gf wasn't there - my neck is still sore from following the ladies as they walked by  - it's worth going just for the people watching.

Talk about a boring group - we all ordered the same thing - sliders ! I I was the wild and crazy one - i ordered a mix - regular sliders and the bernaise sliders - both ok, the fries were better.  The  beer - very good !  Though i even had to raz one of the guys in the group after they ordered budweiser - i can't even believe they serve it at the Yardhouse  !

What's really scary is the president is actually going to look at pricing for office space in Town square - Lord, please don't let it happen  !"}
{"text":"Ordered app's for a group of 4 local residents during a late lunch today. 

Chicken Nachos: chicken was so dry you could barely chew it, like it had been sitting under the salamander for an hour, cheese was cold and rubbery, the only fresh food on the plate was the guac and the sour cream. 

Coconut shrimp: Over deep fried as they were practically black and what's with the plating? You can't spare a little more sauce? I mean it's just drizzled on the plate with some sort of veggie sticks.  

The real disappointment was the famous spinach artichoke dip that I used to love, but now it's a smaller portion and the taste was forgettable. 

The place was not packed for a Sunday afternoon, but the service was slow. Took nearly 45 minutes to get app's, had to send the chicken strips and fries back because it was cold, and wait another 20 minutes for a cup of chicken noodle soup that our guest didn't have time to eat and left.  Waitress was polite but seemed distracted, so the service suffered, but overall I wouldn't go back because it's all about the food, and the food was not good.

Living in Vegas gives you the opportunity to have many great dining experiences and I think that for the prices The Yard House is asking, they could get their act together on simple bar food."}
{"text":"I'm gonna review this as a Cards season holder, eating at Yardhouse about 2 hours before kick-off.

It was odd that they put wrist bands on you when you walk in the door.  Not sure why.  We had to wait about an hour for our table.  Only gripe about the wait...I'm a football fan and a Fantasy owner...we stood outside, so I had to keep going in to check out the games on tv.  If you are interested in watching the games the entire time you are in a restaurant, the New Yorker is the place.  They typically aren't as busy in the restaurant side a couple hours before the game and they have tons of tvs.  Food at the New Yorker is not as good as The Yardhouse.

Hubbie and I split the french onion soup and it was tasty.  Lots of cheese and I liked dipping the sourdough bread on the side.

I got the cajun chicken ceasar salad and it had a nice kick to it.  The Yardhouse dressing is egg-less and still pretty tasty.  It was an ok ceasar.

Hubbie got the club sandwich and liked it.  The fries are more shoestring, and have that burger king coating on them, making them more tasty...but I would prefer no coating.

Son liked his sliders.  His girlfriend got the brownie dessert since she had eaten already.  It was huge and sweet.

We got into the stadium in time to watch the opening kick-off as we climbed to our seats.

Best of the entire day...Cards clinched the NFC West Division title.  Yay!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, very good menu which caters to everyone's needs. Whether you are a meat eater or vegan there is something there for you. Expensive but worth it."}
{"text":"Fantastic draft beer selection. they have every style of beer and ale that one can imagine. The appetizers were also very good. I had the Korean Short Ribs which were awesome. Two thumbs up!!!!!"}
{"text":"They don't always get my order right the first time, but a majority of the staff is friendly and I LOVE all the vegan options on their menu. Plus, beers I actually like on tap! I highly recommend the Ace Pineapple."}
{"text":"Yardhouse is a safe bet when you have a crowd of fickle eaters. (Namly four kids)! My children love the buttered noodles, cheeseburger, fries, and brownie. I love the 5 ounce turkey burger protein style with the citrus soy salad. Popsicles to go for the kiddies!"}
{"text":"Nice location in Vegas and actually loads off a shaded alley way. I sat at the bar and had tacos and beer. The food is consistent and the price is right especially for Vegas. I would stop by again. Bartenders were very attentive."}
{"text":"Went today for lunch with a friend. Don't remember our servers name but she had short hair and 2 nose piercings good service and good food. I work at westgate and have been to that location but never out to Scottsdale I will return soon !"}
{"text":"Had a better visit at this location of yard house than the one in fashion square, buuuuut I cannot get over your ridiculous prices!! It's honestly ridiculous. And I enjoy the finer things in life often.. We didn't even order entrees, had a couple drinks each, and an app for close to $100 including tip. What, is your wine laced with gold or something??!! We only come here if it's a last option to watch the game. Too many other spots with quality food to back up their prices..."}
{"text":"Is this place some kind of joke?? I wish I could say LOL at the end of that..

This review is a little past the time that we came in to this restaurant. We came in probably around 2 months ago, I just always forget to write this review, but I feel it's necessary. My fiance' and I still talk and compare about this experience when we are at other restaurants.

We came in after shopping one day, were sat in a booth and our server throughout the experience was very friendly and kind, so he's definitely not part of this review. The mixed drinks have a splash of alcohol in them, I'm almost certain. I would know this because for 1) I have worked in the industry, I know how this works. 2) I am a drinker, and I literally had 5 drinks and felt nothing. Now, my desire to drink \"a lot\" of alcohol that night was obviously my choice, but DAMN, if I'm ordering 5 mixed drinks I sure as hell better feel some kind of buzz..??? I normally do. Not to mention how expensive the drinks are. Do these bartenders forget the alcohol? Are they free- pouring and just not pouring hardly any alcohol and hope that no one notices?? I had martinis by the way.

On to the food.. it would have been \"OK\" if they came out hot. Everything was luke warm at best, and nothing more than mediocre. Once again, if this were a restaurant that was cheap then it wouldn't have been a big deal. But for the price?? No thanks.

We laugh about this experience because we've been to fine dining restaurants before and ordered appetizers, drinks, entrees, AND dessert, and the bill has come out to less or about the same.
Either serve drinks with ALCOHOL like they should be and get your food up to par or lower your prices. Ridiculous and dishonest. We will never be back"}
{"text":"Another one of my favorite places you must try the enchilada stack ASAP the tomatillo sauce is OMG Awesome 
and the beer selection is 100 percent the BEST in az... Be sure to ask for Garret he's top notch super savy with the menu and great at recommendations for all the new beers love love love sending positive feedback and thank you garret for fantastic service again

{"text":"Food was cold and pasta was really hard. First time there and last time. Waiter didn't care much about situation"}
{"text":"Derek our server made the night!! Love him, come in and ask for him  
Had the ahi sashimi and Baja tacos... omg hit the spot, oh and the midnight sangria was delicious!"}
{"text":"Food was great! But maybe tonight was too busy, the server was not as nice as it has been in the past"}
{"text":"Yard House is a large restaurant in a central location and had no problem accommodating our party of 10.  Jessica W was a fabulous server!  She was very attentive, friendly and went out of her way to make sure we were happy with every drink.  We ordered a wide variety of food - nachos, cheese curds, chicken sandwich, tacos, halibut, turkey club, cuban sandwich, pork loin, mac and cheese, and BBQ chicken salad.  Every single one of us had great food cooked to perfection.  We ended the meal with a blueberry banana crumble and peach apple crisp.  The desserts were unbelievably delicious!  I wish I had a Yard House restaurant close to home."}
{"text":"Very good food and deals during happy hour. Great Service especially from bar staff. Love going here for fun night with Martinis"}
{"text":"It's a chain which is fine. We've been to the one in Miami.  It's at the back of the Linq alley.  We went later in the afternoon so it wasn't busy and were very impressed with the brew knowledge and help of the female bartender (sorry forgot her name).  Prices weren't bad for vegas and quality beers either."}
{"text":"Came in to eat for my birthday. We sat at the bar & the bartenders were nice & greeted me happy birthday. Although we had a miscommunication about beer, it wasn't a big deal because she handled it. The food is always on point. I never have complaints. I was just a little disappointed because I didn't get a birthday dessert or anything. It's okay, no big deal I guess..Probably should've went to another place if I wanted to feel a little special for my birthday hah. But if you do go, try their garlic shrimp & lobster noodles! It's really tasty!"}
{"text":"Food is good, but the service is always soooo slow!!  Definitly order an appetizer cuz you'll be waiting a long time for your entree. I've been there four times, and every time it takes about 30 minutes for the entree to show up.  Just don't go if you're starving cuz you'll be miserable. Also a little pricey. But great veggie options and good food and drink menu."}
{"text":"I love the vast selection of beer and the ability to taste a couple before making your decision. It also helps to have a server be knowledgable so you can pin point what type of beer you might like. I ended up getting the Leinenkugel's sunset wheat. It tasted like fruity pebbles! I found the food to be a little pricey. I would suggest to come here during happy hour. We had just missed happy hour, so we shared a small pizza and a salad and the bill came out to almost $50 with 2 beers. Also, I love the music that plays here. Overall, it's a nice fun place to eat, drink, and dance in your chair."}
{"text":"I really like this place because I'm a craft beer Guru lol anyways they have like 100 beers on draft along with their own house brews. The bar is pretty big and everything is clean in this place. I always get really good bar service. The bar backs are friendly as well. Nick the bar back there is really cool they should move him up to bartender he seems to really know his beer and has good conversation. Now to the food. I've had the lamb burger and it truly is a good lamb burger. It's kind of spicy if you like spice. I also had the Ahi Sashimi and it's also amazing. I've had the sushi too. It's one big piece of sushi but it's pretty decent. The bathrooms are clean as well lol"}
{"text":"Natalie knows customer service. Her ability to enlighten about menu items is useful and impressive! She exudes high standards for interacting with and serving her customers! She considers her responses and offers suggestions When asked. Food was as we expected ... Delicious. French dip was ok lived that it was served with horse radish. Green chili / pepper jack burger was succulent and well prepared!!!"}
{"text":"Overwhelming selection of brewskis! Luckily the bartenders are very knowledgable and can recommend a beer to your taste! 

Food was delicious! My boyfriend and I ordered 4 appetizers/small plates and it filled us up quite nicely! We went with the wings (Caribbean jerk - traditional), truffle fries, garlic noodles and poke bowl - all amazing and would definitely recommend! 

Great for big groups! We had a party of 16...ordering and paying was a breeze! Our waiter kept the checks separate from the get-go and they were very attentive to make sure we got what we needed throughout our meal!"}
{"text":"Indifferent service. Understaffed. The food was almost entirely out of boxes and cans, but is nicely presented. Way too expensive for what it is. Gang serving may be more efficient, but nobody is responsible, so nobody cares.

My Martini was very well done.

Ah, Darden. That explains it.
Corporate food, corporate culture, corporate indifference. Don't worry I understand, you have no power and no budget to address any issues. At least I had the luck to have been treated on a prospective client's expense account and Red Rock has several options available."}
{"text":"Always a good choice!  Great food fun atmosphere, amazing happy hour.  They run out of beer a lot."}
{"text":"I will say that it took forever to get our food due to several large (25+) parties but when we did finally get it, it was fantastic. The selection of drinks is better than most places and the beers on tap were very fresh. Our server was very friendly and attentive. We wanted somewhere to watch the NCAA basketball tournament and the set up of this restaurant allows the game to be seen from almost every seat. But not overwhelming like a sports bar."}
{"text":"The food and drinks was better then the service.  We asked for some little snack for my grandson so he could have something quickly, they promised Oytser crackers.  Uh, never got them.  We gave them advance notice that their was a birthday to celebrate and they said they got it.....uh, nothing.  I mean the food was great, not great service.  It was Friday night, they were just too busy for their staffing....Would I go back, sure!"}
{"text":"The only bad think about this place is the waiters and bus boys at the Red Rock location are completely oblivious to items on the menu. Guerrero is the worst server of them all. How do you not know there is a vegetarian section on your menu? And then after you seriously ask if I want to add chicken??? Food and drinks deserve 5 stars but service deserves 0 stars."}
{"text":"Great food. I'm not in Vegas anymore, but I will go to the Riverside CA restaurant when I get the chance. Loved the Cheeseburger and Fries."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place instead of Gordon Biersch. Previous Yard House experiences varied among our group, so never hurts to try again! 

The place was hopping because of a USA soccer game nearby. The beer selection is amazing, to say the least! The food? Well.... the Firecracker wings were tasty. Of the 3 plates we ordered (2 burgers and one french dip) the dip was by far the best. Both burgers were ordered medium. One came out looking like a charred hockey puck and the other came out undercooked. Sent the charred one back and the new one was only slightly better. The burger in general was quite bland, as no seasoning at all in the meat, and was rather small for $12. 

When the bill came, we were billed for an additional burger (the one that was sent back because it was burned). Our server acted all ditzy about the mistake and didn't even offer to make any sort of adjustment to the bill for the repeated screw ups. 

I understand that the place was busy, but there is no excuse for creating one of the worst burgers ever, double billing for it, then not making any effort to compensate for multiple problems. Needless to say, won't be going back here for anything other than a beer."}
{"text":"I love that yard house has options for people who don't eat meat! And it's all so yummy. I just wish they would knock the prices down by a dollar or two. Usually pay a pretty penny for a handful of buffalo gardein chick'n wings and costs me around (if I remember correctly) $10? Which is okay if I'm really craving it (which is often lol).
My dad and I came in here about a week ago and both of us together came to around $50. Which included our meals, waters, and an appetizer. So price wise that's not too bad but I think it could be a little better. 

But I recommend this place to friends when we are trying to find somewhere to eat. I'll continue to visit here regardless. Just wanted to give an honest opinion."}
{"text":"Service was outstanding but some dishes did not stand up ! 

Lobster Mac and Cheese was outstanding ! If this was all we ordered 5 stars for sure ! But  unfortunately I wanted to explore the menu. 

Will rate what we ordered:

Bloody Mary 3.75 stars: bacon was good but very thick tomato juice , to heavy. 

Tuna Poke 2 stars: very bad presentation drenched in soy no taste. Could not even finish it. ( see pics) 

Duck Wings 2 stars: dry and no sauce to dip in ? Crazy presentation that has nothing to do with flavor ( see pics) 

Brussels sprouts and potatoes  2 stars : unbelievable over cooked. ( see pics )

Lobster Mac and Cheese 5+ Stars : Outstanding ! Best I have had in a long while. 

Service 5 stars: very very good ! 

Parking : 3.5 stars very limited. 

If I go back will just order the Lobster Mac and Cheese and a beer."}
{"text":"Fabulous food! Their Cuban Roast Pork Dip is delicious, as are their steaks, Parmesan crusted chicken and fresh baked brownie.  Their waitstaff is very attentive and the beer selection is amazing."}
{"text":"I like this place for a quick and casual place to eat. The menu has a little bit of everything, and they have a great beer selection. Try the beer flight! The food has always been good. It's nothing exceptional, but it's much better than most chain restaurants. They also have great vegetarian options! The service is pretty fast and the space is big, so we've never had to wait too long for a smaller party."}
{"text":"The front desk is slow, too busy to care. Have to wait 20 min for wrong table, and another 10 min for the right one. The Manger finally got involves to get a table. Sad that employees don't care.
As far as the food it was OK, however the service is very slow, food was cold and out of taste .... 
Desert took long time, ice cream was melted...."}
{"text":"Food pictures? 
----- I only got couple + other's couple = many choices..

Feedback? 
----- sometimes services good sometime not; sometimes food perfect sometimes not.. so you should try it out

Worth $$?
----- of course! That's why I'm always here... :)


Today I just 'type' few things nobody is going to list ( I believe ):

1. Reservation:
-- now accepting limited reservations for parties of 8 or more
-- please speak with a manager about planning your event 

2. Call ahead seating:
-- call them and they will add u to their list if there is a wait for a table. 
-- call ahead is available for parties of six or less"}
{"text":"I went here when it first opened last year and I was impressed. Not anymore. Food was meh and I was being safe by getting the tenders. They were cooked too long and the serving size wasn't what it used to be. I didn't drink but my daughter and I did sit at the bar. Our bartender Deandre was smooth and attentive and kept making sure we were ok even though he had other customers. The greeters greeted us with smiles and thanked us for coming when we left. The staff is the reason for the 3 stars but the food needs improvement."}
{"text":"Great food and prices.  Ate there on a Friday night and wasn't overly crowded.  Service was also excellent.   And you can't beat the long beer menu!   I had a burger and fries and was one of the best I have ever had.  My buddy got the truffle fries and after trying them, I really wish I had ordered those as well."}
{"text":"Excellent beer selection, quality food and attentive service. BBQ ribs outstanding. Sammie a wonderful server."}
{"text":"Another great dining spot in Westgate, perfect for a group with varying tastes.  The Yard House has the best drink selection around, especially if you like beer and a dining selection so wide it has something for everyone.

The only drawbacks are is it almost always feels crowded and occasionally with the influx of people the service sometimes slips, and the food and drinks seem a bit overpriced for what you are getting - but otherwise it almost always provides a great dining experience."}
{"text":"This yard house has one of the best service in town. Our food and drinks were served quick and the attention to needs was excellent. Definitely a favorite location."}
{"text":"Hey,

My husband and I visited the Yard House and experience the best services and by far the best ever waitress name Jillian!!!

Outstanding services, friendly waitress and very caring to all the tables without compromising any wait time.  She was very attentive to everyone!!!

Will visit again when we return to Las Vegas!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times.

The beer is always cold, the bartenders seem knowledgeable and are able to offer you advice and samples.

I've had a pizza and their spinach dip - both were very good.  With the pizza I also had a side salad, which was just okay - I would prefer more types of stuff in my salad.

If you're looking for a low-drama beer and appetizer, this is a good place to go."}
{"text":"Our server was very nice - hence the 2 stars. The food was awful. Fish tacos were cooked beyond recognition; it was hard to tell what species of animal was in the tacos. Also super salty. The Spanish rice was completely inedible. The pork tacos were also a total fail. Oh...and the calamari was bizarre: it had fried lemon slices in it (???).
I'm over the Yard House."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite go to spots when we are at Fashion Square.
Everything is always fresh and as a vegetarian I love the tremendous selections they have available with their Gardein part of their menu.
The vegetarian buffalo chicken wings are so crispy and are the best veggie version of wings I have ever had.
My husband loves the beer selection as well."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times w/ the hubby & eh... it's just okay. Hubby & I came in recently to have a quick bite of appetizers & some drinks before a movie.  No wait @ all.  We were seated as soon as we walked in.  We ordered the Hawaiian Poke Stack & the Grilled Sweet Korean BBQ Beef which the hubby & I shared & left w/ a full stomach. The Hawaiian poke stack was just ok.  It probably would've tasted better if it wasn't drenched in oil.  Presentation was nice though.  Now for the Korean BBQ beef... THAT was pretty good.  & for an appetizer, the portion was quite big.  It seemed to be more of a main dish to me.  It came with a choice of white or brown rice.  Super yummy! Southern Belle for my drink was refreshing. Ahhh.... ; ) Definitely will order that again. lol. The guy who seated us & our waitress was very nice.  My only problem about dining indoors is that it's super dark in there! I could barely see the menu! Prices were reasonable as well."}
{"text":"This is thee Yard House to go to in Las Vegas. Other locations serve the same quality food but ya can't beat the service in this environment. I've been to this Yard House a bunch of times and their employees are always doing it right. When ever I have friends or family coming into town looking for a good eat with a reasonable price, this is the place to be.

But let's talk about food. Their food. OH GOSH THEIR FOOD. Believe the hype when people say that Yard House has some of the best foods you'll eat. Not to mention (pardon me for not being of legal drinking age just yet) that they have one of the largest selections of draft beers and alcoholic specials! I've had a few of their salads, a pizza or two, (the best) mac and cheese, and almost all of their appetizers and they are nothing shy of incredible. During their happy hour, they offer a bunch of specials such as $2 select drinks and half of select appetizers and pizzas, can't go wrong! My friends and I will normally come between classes for a huuuuge plate of their chicken nachos during happy hour.

Needless to say, Yard House takes the cake on food and service in my book."}
{"text":"YardHouse always been one of my favorites at any location. I've always gone during happy hour and haven't been disappointed. They have a happy hour from 3pm-6pm and again from 10:30pm-close which is perfect for late night workers like me. Their chicken nachos come on a huuuuge plate and for only $6 at the happy hour price. I can't remember which beer it was but the server suggested one that tasted like fruity pebbles and boy was it delicious! Highly recommend for anyone looking for a great happy hour place."}
{"text":"Yard House has a great menu! And a huge drink menu! I especially love that they have a vegan/vegetarian/gardein menu. And a \"gluten sensitive\" menu for my mom. The customer service is top notch. I'm giving 3 stars because last time I found a dead bug in my food. I ordered the lettuce wraps and the bug was clearly on display in the middle of one of my pieces of lettuce. I understand that lettuce is susceptible to bugs. But this could have easily been prevented. It ruined my appetite. I probably should have notified my server, but I didn't want ruin anyone else's meal at the table. I'll definitely be back though."}
{"text":"Great meeting place for family and friends. Comfort food and cold barley pops. Kayla was not sure of the sushi nachos?? My chicken pasta was good. I score a 6.1688 out of 10."}
{"text":"Good pan seared sashimi and many choices for an entree. Great service and the atmosphere was great for family or sports."}
{"text":"Love my experience here. The menu was huge but delicious. We started off the crab and shrimp spinach dip, then I got the surf n turf burger. Prices were on point, portions very good and the service was great. I'm not a big beer person, but I found a blueberry beer that I was able to drink (and finish) with no problems. Will definitely be going back to explore the menu some more in the near future."}
{"text":"On a Sunday afternoon we were able to walk right in & sit at the bar. The bartender was friendly & attentive. The food menu has a ton of options but we kept it simple & went with sandwiches. I had the grilled cheese with truffle fries instead of the tomato soup it comes with. The sandwich was perfectly melted and had some tomato on it. Good but nothing special. The truffle fries were fabulous!! A lot of truffle flavor....didn't want to quit eating them. My husband had the turkey & bacon melt 2.0. He really loved it. It had nice thick carved slices of turkey, cheese, bacon, roasted tomatoes, & jalapeño spread. Not very spicy. Delicious. 

The beer list is extensive. A paradise for beer lovers. We would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Food was great as always. Our waiter, was attentive, patient, and gave great suggestions for food. Restaurant was clean and service was wonderful.Highly recommend.They have the largest assortment of beer."}
{"text":"You really can never go wrong with this place. There is just something for everyone with their extensive food & beverage menu! First time at this location, we came in hungry and ready to eat... and left extremely satisfied! Big/clean venue with lots of seating, extremely friendly staff (when sat by the hostess, he noticed him looking at the television screen and asked what game he wanted to watch -- and changed it for us!), and incredibly delicious food filled with so much flavor! 

We ordered:

- POKE NACHOS ($12.75): Marinated raw ahi tuna on top of crispy wonton crips, in a sweet soy, siracha aioli and white truffle sauce -- topped with avocado, cilantro, serranos, green onions, sesame seeds & nori seaweed strips. (Just do yourself a favor & get this!)
- LOBSTER MAC & CHEESE ($25.75): A generous amount of lobster & pasta with sundried tomatoes, asparagus, wild mushrooms with cheddar cheese, parmesan & truffle oil. (Was skeptical to order this because of the price... but wow. The value is so worth it! Such a mouth orgasm, and I was impressed by the amount of lobster they put!)
- BLACK TRUFFLE CHEESEBURGER ($12.85): A thick patty with house made truffle cheese, a flavorful tomato-bacon-onion jam, with a side of fries. (Substituted for sweet potato fries for a $1.00 charge. Had cooked medium rare and added lettuce & tomato.)

Will we be back? Oh, absolutely! Five stars all around!"}
{"text":"Food was on real and server was super friendly. Took us upstairs to checkout the keg room and show us the rest of the place. Would highly recommend. Maeva was her name"}
{"text":"Went after happy hour, that was a mistake.  The happy hour menu and prices are great.  The kids meal (12 and under) is the same size as the adult meal, plus drink and desert.  If you go, go at happy hour and take your kids.  You can feed the whole family for a great price."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great menu. You could sit inside or outside too. Service is great as well. Best all-around restaurant in town Square"}
{"text":"Service is always awesome and the food is great. Love coming here for lunch when its not as crowded."}
{"text":"Not nearly as good as last time. Service was excellent. ....food not so much. Turkey melt sandwich was dry...turkey over cooked....poor presentation.  Fries.....held too long under heat lamp...French onion soup lacking flavor..

Sorry...used to be one of our favorites. 



."}
{"text":"Our friends ate here but I got drinks and clam chowder.  The chowder was great and the drinks were good.  My friends spoke highly of their meals.  Looked like halibut and steak.  The waiter was funny and nice.  Came by a lot and was attentive to making the dinner great.  I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Meh... 

Went there twice while on vacation. The first night (after a Coyotes game) had excellent service from Jan. Street tacos were rather small, but tasty. The Ahi salad rocked. The main gripe is that their house beer is some watered down swill from Utah and they still charge almost $7 a pint! A better choice is any of the local offerings from Four Peaks. They have a lot of beer listed on tap, but we're out of most of the English selections I wanted to try. 

Went back the next night and had rotten service by some overwhelmed waitress that treated us like we were to blame for her misery. She took our order and threw our check at us while we had no less than 5 other servers bring our food, drinks, and checked in on us. Nachos were fantastic and again had to mortgage the house to pay for my beer.

With a draft beer costing the price of a six-pack and hit and miss service, we'll try every other option in and around Westgate before we go back..."}
{"text":"I used to come here often when I lived closer however after today I will NEVER step foot in this dump again !! It took forever to get served . The menus were tossed at us and the bartender walked away. It wasn't until we asked someone to help us did we get served . After we finally ordered our lunch and the meal came out it was wrong . After we had the wrong order sent back it was returned cold ! When we let them know the food was old and we didn't have time to wait any longer the server informed a manager and she walked right past us cussing and complaining !!!!!! I am in the service industry and it seriously takes a lot for me to complain or even get on Yelp and write a review but someone who is in management should lead by example! This was absolutely disgusting the way we were treated ! If management can treat guest that way than all employees at this establishment can and that is a disgrace . If you hate your job leave ! Don't ruin your guest experience during the only break they have in a day!! Appalled !"}
{"text":"I'd been to this location before and couldn't remember why I hadn't been back. The service was okay, the food was okay but as we were sitting there we said, \"it's okay here but we don't need to come back\" 
With that being said, the French fries remind us of Smashburger fries but not quite as good. I had a bite of my husbands bacon cheeseburger which was really good as well. I ordered the club sandwich and as always it was so big I could only eat half of it. Servings are quite generous, atmosphere inside was extremely loud and very hard to have a conversation. We chose to sit outside and in the 100 degree heat it was very comfortable with the misters on and easy to hear each other talk."}
{"text":"First time at this yard house, food portions were HUGE and DANK.. Service was awesome, fast, and extremely nice. Our server. Rosèe was awesome and did a great job on our table she went the extra mile to make our visit better. Happy hour is always a good option for any occasion!

The turkey pot pie is honestly enough to feed 2 and the presentation was amazing! Definitely will visit again when I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Amazing food as always, great service, had the roast beef dip."}
{"text":"Firstly it's very noisy, we were seated right next to the kitchen,  so not only is the crowd  loud, so is the kitchen staff, and all I hear is plates and dishes.
The wait was 20 min, the only reason we came because the food is really delicious. I always order the the ahi pokie bowl .it's always fresh And delicious. 
I would suggest being at the bar, the service is a lot quicker.
But I would come back. ."}
{"text":"We left the sugar factory across the road because I knew that no matter what u order at the yard house the food is always fresh and delicious.
Well just as expected we ordered off the happy hour menu, my favorite the poke bowl, chicken lettuce wraps and egg rolls.
Our waiter nick, offered great service, and was attentive,  he always had a smile on his face no matter how many times we called him.
The yard house is my favorite place to eat because you can be guaranteed you will get a good meal,  and great service,  I prefer this location at town square because the service definitely quicker, especially when one is hungry.
It's also a great place to watch the games,  if you want to escape the heat,  inside dining is very cool....w"}
{"text":"Was at the Red Rock for a conference.  Good food, good happy hour, good beer, good service.  Done."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant. My girlfriend and I ate their three night in a row.  We decided to sit at the bar because the service was faster. The waiters and waitress was wonderful. Everyone would talk and laugh with us. The first night our food was a little late and they only charge us for one meal. The manager came and apologizes to us personally. When We are in Glendale again, we will definitely go back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"We know it's a chain but the beer was cold, chips and guacamole were awesome and the street tacos were delicious.  Our server Peter was awesome! Definitely worth a trip!!"}
{"text":"I am so glad we got a location in Cleveland! I love the extensive draft beer list and the food here is so good! The Ahi Poke Tuna Nachos are my absolute new favorite and I could order these every time I visit. The food is consistently good as well as the service. The only thing is that it can get really loud and hard to hear the people sitting across the table from you."}
{"text":"GREAT happy hour, for locals and tourists alike! 

If you are on the Strip near The Linq, I suggest you make your way to the Yard House. Good food, good beer, and great prices. Although this is a chain restaurant, it's one of the better ones. And this location should be on the top of their national list.

Our friend Betty was visiting from Texas, and we all took a ride on the High Roller. (Great deal if you get a pre-6 p.m. rate w/drink on Living Social.) Next up was happy hour at the Yard House, in the shadow of the mighty Roller. They have drink specials and half-price appetizers from 3 to 6. Timing was great (although I planned this attack in advance, because I knew what they had to offer...).

We split three apps -- Hawaiian poke stack, spinach cheese dip, and pepperoni & mushroom pizza -- and we each had a few craft beers (mostly white ales and IPAs). Food was good -- not great -- but you can't beat that quality at half-price. And if you like beer and can't find one you like on this extensive menu, that's on you. (They offer samples in case you're curious, but don't treat it as a free for all, or we'll all suffer!)

I have to mention the exceptional service we had. We sat on the upper patio amid a shift change, which could have been disastrous. Instead, we had three waitresses who were friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable about their menu -- which, sadly, should be a prerequisite to being a server but usually isn't. Kudos to the staff here!

I've been to other Yard House restaurants, but this has to be my favorite. What a fantastic location! And while it can be pricey during \"normal\" hours, the happy-hour rate is hard to beat. Overall, I can't think of a better place for happy hour on the Strip than the Yard House. (If you know of something better, let me know!)"}
{"text":"Reasonably priced casino restaurant. Food was good but not great. Service was excellent. The waiter helped me find a difficult to find game I wanted to watch."}
{"text":"This is my second time at the Yardhouse and both times at this location. I kept hearing that the Jambalaya was to died for. I gave it a try and was unhappy with the quality of the meal. Very dry out and cold. Didn't really have a flavor. Also our server was pointless. But I guess that's what you get when you are super busy. Waited in line for about 30 minutes.  

Overall it was eh."}
{"text":"This place is great if you are into beer; they have a huge selection. If you're one that can't decide, they give you the ability to order four, six, or even more small beers of different types to try. Their food was pretty tasty although a bit overpriced. The music was a little loud for normal conversation. Despite these small annoyances, I will go back and enjoy the place."}
{"text":"I must say Yard House is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. Whether you are coming for a full dinner or a snack or just a beer, it's amazing!

My favorite snack food here are their Truffle Fries. They fry their shoestring french fries to perfection, tossing them in a combination of truffle and garlic flavors. I get it every time I come here! My favorite appetizer would be their Wisconsin Fried Cheese Curds; they are accompanied by two sauces, one is a creamy, toned-down horseradish sauce and the other is a spicy-honey sauce. They bread the cheese curds lightly enough that it does not drown out the cheese. As for entrees, I enjoy their chicken tenders (which are perfectly crispy on the outside and moist and juicy on the inside), their mac and cheeses (which has the perfect amount of cheesy gooey-ness and is balanced by bacon pieces throughout), and their penne with chicken (that has tender pieces of chicken and is accompanied by crisp pieces of asparagus, giving an extra crunch to the dish).

For their beverages, they have a wide selection of cocktails and beers. I enjoy their more fruity beers, where my go to is the Timmerman Strawberry. Cherry Wheat is also a great choice!

Overall, I really enjoy the atmosphere of all Yard House locations and their food never disappoints. And if you can get their during happy hour, it makes it that much better!"}
{"text":"The best beer selection anywhere.  This is the place I originally started learning about new beers from around the world.  Before YH was even in Vegas, I was frequenting them in LA.  It helped me expand my \"beer horizons\" and now I can't even go back to bud light or anything like that. 

Surprising was the menu... very diverse and everything is good!  They have great happy hour specials as well... such as half off pizzas, seared sashimi ahi tuna and more.  

It's a comfortable environment with lots of TVs keeping you up on the latest sporting events with classic 80's tunes in the background.

A great deal and great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"The best selection of beers and good food.  How can you go wrong?  I credit YardHouse for my expanded view of beer.  It was here I first tasted Franziskaner, Mothership Wit, Weheinstephaner and others.  They have a good happy hour during the week and the appetizers are great... pizza, seared tuna, etc.  They also play good \"oldies\" for music as well.  Only knock is that they have games on TV but no sound to the games.  Not the best place to watch a game if that's what your into."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT! Ate here during happy hour and the service was amazing. Our server, Tiffany was very knowledge about about the menu and attentive to us and made sure we got exactly what we wanted, how we wanted it! The manager checked in on us to ensure that we were happy. Food was tasty and quick especially since it is a from scratch kitchen! On top of that there are 145+ beers on tap! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Poke Nachos!!!!  OMG. SOOOOOO GOOD.  Oh and the service at the bar rocks!
This is when I come for and a Blue Moon and I'm all set and I'm so happy I leave happy that's all there is to say in this happy ending...goodbye"}
{"text":"Great place. I always have a hard time finding gluten free places. The manager came out and said he would make sure with my allergy that their would be no cross contamination with gluten. I look forward to going back. Thanks."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I'm a tough critic. Rarely do I give a 5 star rank. This restaurant totally deserves all five stars. From the atmosphere, to the well-trained employees, to the great selection of food, and although I'm not a drinker the amazing variety of spirits.
If you're in the area, I strongly recommend that you give this restaurant top priority on any informal gathering. The music is lightly there are TVs with Sports playing throughout the entire restaurant.
 The number of positive reviews on this site is what led me there, take your time and read a few of these and you'll be hooked."}
{"text":"Came in for a small snack and a couple of beers, and Olivia and Jocelyn were both sweet, helpful, and attentive. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Came in for some recovery Bloody Mary's and wings. Kaya was helpful, attentive, and kind. Would certainly return."}
{"text":"We went here for New Years Eve.  The beer is what it is, this is why you go.  Several of my party ordered mixed drinks.  By far, the worst I've seen in a long time.  Watered down and tasteless with no alcohol.  Oh, did I mention overpriced.  Huge disappointment.  Felt sorry for my non-beer drinking friends.  Won't go back."}
{"text":"This place is good. I highly recommend the chicken street tacos. The Chipotle sauce is the bomb. The jerk wings were ok.  The truffle fries were pretty good. I would come here again"}
{"text":"Dude! I can't say enough about the beer and the great prices. This is our first stop when ever we hit Vegas for the food and the great drinks and then were off to play good old Vegas royal. Plus the happy hour - can't beat it :D"}
{"text":"Happy hour (4-6 and 10-12)  brings a discount to over 100 different draft beer and 1/2 off a nice variety of food.  The best is they have Gardein products which can turn almost any dish into a vegetarian dream.  I go for the veggie 'chicken' wings and the Thai-style pizza."}
{"text":"Consistent with the Yardhouse brand, this location is awesome. The beer selection, of course, is excellent. The ambiance, food quality, service, and happy hour put it over the top. Especially in Vegas."}
{"text":"We ate here last night before the hockey game. It was very good as usual if you can stand the wait. I had the pepper crusted Gorgonzola burger, my hubby had the mac & cheese, which he said is the best in town!

I keep track of everything I eat so I really splurged on this 1500 cal burger and also at $13 it is pretty expensive for a burger, but man is this thing good!

The only reason I'm not giving this place five stars is because we had to wait for a table which is not unusual Westgate but also because we didn't see our server for the first 15 minutes that we sat down. Once we did get her attention she was very quick, got us to hockey game on time and did everything else very well. 

If you're in Westgate, it's not too crowded and you have a few extra bucks, I recommend this Yardhouse."}
{"text":"The best place and its the best service. Get Jordyn C if you can! Totally the best young server ever. She was so attentive! Sweet gal!"}
{"text":"The Yardhouse has an awesome beer selection, as good as nearly anyone in Las Vegas. We have always had great service, the food comes out very quickly, and it is a modern, fun, upbeat atmosphere. 

You must try the Seared Ahi Sashimi, it is the bomb. Some of our other favorites are the chicken lettuce wraps, the truffle cheeseburger, the poke stack, and many more. We have been here 10+ times and have liked everything we've ever ordered, so I have to say two thumbs up. The Seared Ahi Sashimi has a great complexity to it, I'll save the description of the flavors to the Bourdain Types but it seriously makes my mouth water just thinking about it.

With regard to the beers, try the ever rotating list of short-termers that are posted on the screen above the bar, they keep a nice variety flowing through there and some of them have been absolute winners. If you are a fan of IPAs this place has a selection that is incredibly diverse, and you should try the Double Daddy, it is SICK.

The Happy Hours are great here, half price apps, pizzas, and discounts on every beer in the house if I remember correctly, check it out they do a great job and you always it'll be good. 

Most of our visits were previous to Darden Restaurants buying Yardhouse, so hopefully the product will stay the same!"}
{"text":"Food: I ordered the classic caesar salad. It was nothing too special but it was a nice light lunch. If you're in the mood for a lighter option, I would say the salad is a solid choice. The highlight of the meal was the cocktail! I ordered the citrus crush which my friend strongly recommended. It was so good! Perfectly sweetened mojito and the lemon and mint bring a refreshing taste! Perfect for a hot day!

Service: I would say service is pretty good. The waitress for our table was very helpful especially since there were people in our party who wanted to try their draft beers. 

Tip: They give free samples of beer, I believe before you order a half yard. My friend and I got to try a red and brown beer. Moose drool was our favorite of the two! Safe choice and refreshing!"}
{"text":"We were just wandering around to find a place for brunch, and the patio seating was the big draw. Turns out they serve a darn good Bloody Mary and the perfect high-carb hangover cure: Mac & Cheese.  The menu says it's a customer favorite, and I completely believe. The small portion seemed like a sensible idea, but I was honestly a little sorry I hadn't indulged in a stuff fest.  My companion enjoyed her chicken tortilla and fish tacos, too. It's a restaurant chain, but a good one!"}
{"text":"Go during happy hour, their spicy tuna roll is amaze balls, (someone already posted a picture)  that alone will fill you up! Ambiance and service is always on point too!"}
{"text":"Have a beer, then have another. I love this place and their selection of beers, and they normally have limited drafts, so be sure to have a designated driver. I always end up tipsy. Best place for a drink before a Coyotes game."}
{"text":"Tuesday night and you'd think there'd be less crowd of people, not the case here. It wasn't crazy busy where there's a wait or anything, but enough for me to take note. Service was ok our server messed up our order a little bit, but she was quick to correct it, but food was a little disappointing. They got a new appetizer added to the menu- pork lumpia which is Filipino eggroll, the ones you'd see served at every Filipino party. I'm Filipino, I know what these things are and have them often so I HAD to try them out here. I guess I was hoping for them to be super duper good and better than the ones I'm used to eating, but they're about the same as the ones my mom cooks lol. Safe to say I wasn't truly impressed, plus they are a bit pricey at $12 for like 7 eggrolls. I also ordered fish and chips and wasn't impressed with that either, the batter was near burnt and something in the tartar sauce was spicy. I also ordered truffle fries, but again sad to say it wasn't the same truffle fries I remember loving, they were darker in color than usual as if a couple more minutes in the fryer and the whole thing would've burned -- maybe they just need to replace the oil they used to cook? Anyway, I've had Yard House plenty of times before and know these guys can do better, but tonight just didn't cut it for me."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for lunch on Sunday, and I wish I didn't.  My girlfriend and I met another couple here for lunch.  We didn't really have to wait and was seated promptly.  The combination of slow service and average food was really disappointing to me, especially I generally enjoy this place.  The service...Our waitress was just overwhelmed.  It looks like she had over 8 tables and was running like a chicken with its head cut off.  We ordered some chicken nachos as a appetizer which was probably the highlight of the experience but our lunches too forever to come out.  We all pretty much ordered the same thing.  Lunch Special.... half sandwich and soup, or salad, or pizza. We added fries for couple of bucks and a kale chicken salad.  Finally when the food came out, everything was warm or bland.  My roast beef dip was poorly made and the bread was hard and crusty.  No wonder why you had to dip it.  My french onion wasn't even hot.  How can you serve luke warm french onion soup?  The fries were terrible, nothing is worst than fries that have been sitting there for a while.  Not hot, not warm, just blah!  My girlfriend ordered the Grill Chicken Kale Ceaser Salad.  She started to eat her salad and I said, that's a pretty sad looking salad, isn't there suppose to be grilled chicken in it?  She didn't even notice.  So I wanted to flag down my waitress but she was no where to be found, so I let a busboy know, since he was the one that actually brought the food out.  He said he will take care of it.  Well my girlfriend was pretty full from eating the nacho's and some of my food and about 15 minutes later the grilled chicken finally came out.  It was no more than 3 little strips of chicken.  My girl and I looked at each other and just shook our heads.  We didn't even bother eating it.  I wasn't really full or satisfied, but I just didn't want to eat anymore of this lunch.  I filled myself up on water and diet coke and requested the bill.  I still tip 20% cause it really wasn't the waitress fault.  Everything was just poor execution.  I'll give The Yard House a pass this time, cause it's never been like this."}
{"text":"I suggest going during happy hour.  Excellent deals on appetizers and drinks.  Food is good and the selection of beer on tap is astounding.  Normal menu items are a bit pricey for the budget minded folk but the service, food and drinks are good."}
{"text":"This was so delicious!!! I used the DoorDash app which is absolutely amazing, I love it! The food was there quick. I had the ribs they were perfect. The beans were sweet and spicy and the cream corn is great!"}
{"text":"Happy hour, great food but my favorite Jerk chicken wings were too spicy, I could only eat 1! They have La Fin du Monde, one of my favorite beers that is hard to find! Darker, nice atmosphere and the best music of any restaurant! !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"In town on vacation and this is my 1st time at this location and it was cool.  We came by on a spur of the moment date and it was super packed, large party of 80 before us. We still got a table fast and fast service.  The food was a little slower than usual because of the big party and the Manager Mike came and delivered the food personally and apologized for the wait, which was not even that bad. That made out trip special because he really seamed to care that we were happy. Zack the server also kept a good eye on us too. The whole staff in general were helpful.   I ordered the Cuban sandwich, which is my favorite here. I beyond recommend it to everyone. We also tried the new carnivore pizza which was also good."}
{"text":"Just moved here from the West Coast where food is paramount. I stopped in at Yard House while having my iPhone fixed at the nearby Apple Store.

I was delighted to find a local casual restaurant that serves Poke, Lettuce Cups, burgers with flavor and other non-standard fare. We had the Ahi Poke Stack and Lettuce cups which were great. The Bacon Cheddar burger was quite tasty, not bland.

The mac and cheese with truffle oil was okay, but was a little bit mild for my taste.

The current modern decor and atmosphere added to the experience. For a while, it felt like I was out West again. I'll be back to try out more things on the menu."}
{"text":"For a chain, I do like Yard House. As most of you know, I am not a chain restaurant person but for Yard House and a few others, I do have an adoration for. I have never eaten or drank anything horrible from Yard House at any location so this chain has my Yelp Love.

I have been to this Yard House located in The Linq Promenade many times sipping drinks at the bar. It has been my standard location if I am hovering around this part of the Strip. My reason is not for the beer as I know that is a main focus of the Yard House but for their delicious cocktails and full bar. Give me a yummy cocktail and I give you my heart. I also love the vibe and the mixologist who are always so attentive and super friendly.

My favorite cocktail here has to be the Black Orchid Martini. It is a fine concoction of Svedka Rasberery Vodka, Blue Curacao, watermelon pucker and cran juice. It looks as delicious as it tastes. The sexy dark blue liquid poured into a classic martini glass looks mighty pretty in a cocktail selfie, for those who do things like that. ;) It is a nice sweet cocktail that is pretty potent as well. Do it!

Unlike other Yard Houses, I have yet to sit down and eat. I will do that one day because I am so into their Miso Cod with Brown Rice... one day. Until then I will be saddled up at the Bar with a dark blue martini in my hand, followed by a Grey Goose and tonic whilst chatting with a friend or two. See you soon, Yard House!"}
{"text":"I have been to several Yard Houses and it's always good. The Town Square one has to be the most convenient one I have been to. Good parking and an easy walk from the back parking lots of Town Square.

The service here is superb! We ordered a Hefe-weizen and they said it would take a minute to switch taps. We got it right away. To have a local place that has German beer on tap is pretty awesome.

The food is fantastic too, I've never had a bad dish. On my last visit, we shared the Queso dip. It was pretty ooey-gooey and very delish. I think it needed more chips though, we kind of ran out and started piling on the queso towards the end.  I think I heard my arteries screaming \"For the love of God, not all at once! \" 

For my main dish, I ordered the miso sea bass with bokchoy and brown rice. I'm a huge fan of miso fish dishes after trying the miso cod at Nobu in 2009. So the miso sea bass at YH is one of my favorites. The sweetness and the freshness of the fish was impressive. I also prefer brown rice, so having it as an alternative over white rice is always a plus.

Yay for Yard House!"}
{"text":"Yes, it is now a chain, but was once a single restaurant in Long Beach CA, and I've been to that one many many times. This location does not disappoint (unlike Long Beach though, it is not on the water, so that is sad). The food was excellent, as was the server. I had French onion soup and the BBQ chicken salad, and mom had the fish and chips. Mom said it was as good as the ones she had in the LBC. Also, the cherry limeade (alcoholic!) was yummy! If you haven't been, try it, you won't regret!"}
{"text":"No other place in Vegas to get an AMAZING beer selection and vegan bar-food!"}
{"text":"Server was so so. Nashville chick sandwich was Delish.. except I did not order the sandwich. They were out of the wine I originally ordered. It was pretty good for the circumstances."}
{"text":"Dueschutes Brewery Mirror Pond Pale Ale, very good, very cold, jerk chicken wing had great flavour, but the texture was gross, seemed like they were steamed and finished in the pizza oven, it was dark, I couldn't tell if they were raw or not, they made another batch, same as the first. Uneatable"}
{"text":"Yard House is never a disappointment! Service is great, not a long wait. The Buffalo cauliflower is so yummy! I enjoyed their tomato bisque soup and salad. Service is good."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my top spice to go too. Most definitely for happy hour is a must. I get this every time. The meat lovers"}
{"text":"Great service, great beer selection. Server was wonderful, spinach dip was awesome! Prices are reasonable and the vegetarian options are superb!"}
{"text":"I love all Yard Houses, but the service and meal Recommendation was off the charts. Thanks"}
{"text":"Good selection of beer and the food is extremely edible. Great place to punish yourself with too much alcohol and some artery-clogging mac and cheese. They have some good healthy options, as well. The salmon I had was cooked perfectly.

I've been to a couple of locations and both have had good service. There is an excellent beer variety, although the prices aren't great in that category. However, I understand it is probably expensive to stock that much beer on tap. The house beers are surprisingly good, as well. All around a solid restaurant in all categories."}
{"text":"Poke nachos are my absolute favorite here. The fish is fresh and the entire dish is delicious. I usually go for happy hour so I get a good deal on dinner. Things I usually order are the BBQ Chicken Pizza, onion ring tower, firecracker boneless chicken, and fried calamari. That usually feeds my entire family for under $40. I think it's a great deal and the food is BOMB! If you are looking for cheap and delicious dinner, look no further. Monday through Friday from 3p - 6p is happy hour. OH and you can catch football here too for all you NFL fans out there."}
{"text":"Before you go out on a night on a strip, come here. Love the atmosphere and all the servers and waitress are all great! They are very attentive and its what customer service is all about and gets people coming back.

I usually get appetizers because who wants to look all bloated on a night out. NOT ME! LOL

I had the kung pao calamari and the onion rings. It was enough to get me full. You can get the calamari with brown rice so it makes it a little healthy."}
{"text":"My favorite, favorite place to go for a drink in Vegas. 80% of the end of my nights were spent at the bar (which I also learned was a quick way to grab a seat and order dinner as well without the wait). Drinks were delicious and not overly saturated with sugar like the drinks in other restaurants along the strip. My favorite was the salted watermelon margarita; their grilled cheese, tomato bisque, and salted caramel pudding is to die for."}
{"text":"We waited over an hour for our food. One dinner came much later then 4 of them. Both  meat dishes were raw in the middle (they could have walked off the plate). We had out of town guests and had bragged about the place..it was embarrassing!  We were so disappointed with the entire experience"}
{"text":"Good food but service was not the best.  Loved the French onion soup!  French fries where string fries.. pretty good.  I would try it again...So many beers on tap fun!"}
{"text":"Yardhouse is one if my favorite restaurants! You gotta try the house tropic drink ($10) it's  fruity, refreshing and not too sweet. I love the chicken nachos even though this is an upper scale restaurant, these nachos are delicious. I don't care for beans so I ordered them without beans or red sauce and the green sauce on the side. Omg my  mouth is watering just thinking about it lol. It's a little pricey but worth it. I love Westgate, it's close to my house  so I'm glad there's a Yardhouse near by!"}
{"text":"Seated quickly for a party of 2 around 7pm. I had a taco craving and had never had their tacos. The server recommended the carnitas tacos which were delicious! Ordered with a side of guacamole and tortilla chips. The guacamole was excellent. Ate here twice within a span of 3 days and got the carnitas tacos both times. Also love the pear cider!"}
{"text":"...For the record, I have never posted a negative review online...This evening I decided to eat at this Yardhouse location, but the experience was traumatic. Between California and Nevada, I have eaten at this restaurant at least a few dozen times, and general eat the same few options. Getting to the point, upon arrival of the main course, i saw a dark piece of something poking out of the breading of my chicken fingers. Considering I eat these almost every time I eat at Yardhouse, dismantling deemed appropriate. I pulled the breading off and discovered a cockroach /bug type wing and a limb on an insect. The food runner was notified of the incident, and attempted to take the plate back. I denied him, took a photo and requested a manager. The manager (Beau Boskey) assured me it was cabbage, but also denied eating it upon request. At this point, he offered to take that dish off the bill, and shrugged off the entire situation as a misunderstanding. He entirely discrediting my opinion, and I'm a collector of  scientific insect displays. Kind of ironic. Our server came over and apologized about the whole situation. We understood it wasn't her fault, but did let her know that the manager handled the situation wrong(she was tipped). She apparently notified him of my dissatisfaction and conversation of taking this to his upper management/corporate. After Beau, the manager, caught word, he decided to retract his original offer and comp the whole meal. This attempt to appease me was an appropriate gesture, a bit late and an obvious back step. Overall, this restaurant experience will never be forgotten... in a bad way. .........By the way... I looked up deep fried cabbage on google image search and my photo looks very different. gross. 
3/22/13 Update- I was recently offered a free meal and assurance that my experience is going to be used as a training exercise. Obviously, I'll never eat at this place again, and hopefully they figure out how to deal with these situations better in the future."}
{"text":"Back again for the 3rd time:the Penne  with Chicken &Turkey Pot Pie were good, but the pot pie could be crispier. Trying the Roast Beef Dip, I hope it is good too."}
{"text":"Vegetarians who like fake meat- delight! I had the blackened \"Gardien\" chicken (Gardien or whatever is the brand of the veg protein) OMG super good....perfect spice, creamy avocado and the fake chicken was actually Juicy. Did not have that artificial taste. And it was all on a \"torta\" (bun) which was soft yet substantial. There is no reason to stick to the vegetarian section however b/c there was so much good stuff on the entire menu. The Shrimp ceviche on the small taste menu was decent size and super good...chopped up like a salsa which a great cilantro, lime sauce. I think it had the salad shrimp; couldn't really distinguish the shrimp part but was good-red onions, etc. The music as loud and annoyed me a little; not a fan of loud music and tvs everywhere but people seem to like that. The music was consistent- 70s and 80s rock I guess; made my husband happy. Prices were as expected. Split the sandwich and ceviche, total of 3 glasses of wine....$50. Try this place!"}
{"text":"Super good. I first had Yard House last year. I can't remember the name of the burger I had, but I crushed it. The sweet potato fries were really good too - especially when you ask for the rum dipping sauce. Pure heaven. :)"}
{"text":"I generally hate Las Vegas. What I love about this place is that it doesn't try to be a Vegas bar! Pretty standard American restaurant/bar offerings. But what makes this special is the epic beer selection! Easily 100+ beers on tap, with the majority being very good. The fish tacos I ordered were just meh. Who cares though when the beer is so good. Definitely worth a stop if you're on the strip and want a good beer."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, clean area, awesome servers. From start to finish the staff was amazing and friendly. I tried the Wisconsin fried cheese curds which were delicious he sauces with them were the highlight, the horseradish was simple and added a little flavor the cheese curds however the honey sauce was my favorite and just a little kick. For lunch I enjoyed the lamb burger which was amazing the feta cream was light and added so much flavor. I subbed buffalo cauliflower for my side and was not disappointed the spice was manageable. For dessert the mini crèm brûlée which is topped with bananas. We were celebrating a graduation and our awesome server made sure it was done right.
OH AND THEY HAVE GREEN TEA so it's a yes for me"}
{"text":"What an incredible experience. The staff impeccable. Great Happy Hour Yes!! in Vegas. The Linq Hotel is PERFECT!! Best Yard House I've been to yet!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing - so much so that I had dinner there 2 nites in a row. that's a first for this Yelper.  the food's fresh and  well-prepared. They have a huge menu, as well as having more beers than I could consume in a lifetime. Altogether this is a must visit in Arizona!"}
{"text":"Huge variety of beers and nice food!

Really nice place but very busy. We've been on Friday night and we had to wait 40-50 min. But we took nice beers, waited at the bar  table and enjoyed each other  
I had Ginger Crusted Salmon with Wasabi Mashed Potatoes :)"}
{"text":"If I could give 1/2 a star I would.
Just had a horrible service. Was here yesterday, tuesday 5/1, with only 2 people in the group. The halibut might as well of been sushi. It was cold and rock hard. Sent it back and we did get a new one. Waitress was great and very apologetic. 
A group of 10 wanted to eat here, Wednesday 5/2. My steak was cold. I let the same manager know of the issue and now he gives me an attitude. Instead of cooking the steak over all they did was put the steak in the microwave to reheat it. I didnt send it back because I was hungry and everyone else had their meals and I didnt want everyone waiting for me. Some other plates in the group were cold but noone said anything else.
When I brought it up to my server, they spoke with the manager. All he wanted to do was give us a dessert. For a party party of 10 with drinks all he could do was a dessert.
I guess since it's on the strip THEY don't care about their CUSTOMERS!!!"}
{"text":"While the title implies a beer selection and it certainly has 3 pages of draft beer of all types and tastes, we were very impressed with our lunch. My girlfriend ordered a pastrami dip and tomato bisque soup and sandwich I had the turkey club with French onion. The sandwiches were ample for a half sandwich special and very tasty. The avocado in the turkey club was a nice addition and the meat was ample. The French onion soup was covered with bread and cheesed sufficiently, not overly salty that can happen with French onion. The Pastrami was plentiful and the dark dipping sauce added a nice flavor. The Tomato bisque also had a nice texture and taste as well. The abundant draft choice drew me in but the food was a pleasant surprise. Compare restaurants in a similar price range and this one should rate highly. In fact we also ate at Carnegies Deli and paid more for a less impressive sandwich. Don't hesitate to try the food here. Will definitely come back here to try all of the beers."}
{"text":"Gave the local spot at Red rock second chance. The house was full...5***** service. Callie  was our waitress please keep her and her team.Everything was excellent above and beyond service. I had the $32.00 ribeye and shrimp. Steak was very tender and so juicy and flavorful  can still taste it now...the mash potatoes suburb with added greens just spectacular. Civiche app very good and just the right amount of spice. Wife had  swordfish tacos no complaints...Great job Red Rock yardhouse...these locals are back !"}
{"text":"One of the better chain restaurants.  Generally, we avoid them but this one works out when meeting people around Desert Ridge.  Our server was nice but only saw him a couple of times and our drinks were empty a LOT (we were outside).  The food was good and everyone seemed to finish their plates.  Nice vegetarian selection for my wife."}
{"text":"Yard house is just pure awesome. Been to the one at red rock and the linq too but the one in town square is definitely one of my favorites. 

They have great choices for mixed drinks and food as well. 

Appetizers get the lettuce wraps, truffle fries, calamari (don't confuse it with the Kung pao one) and nachos you can't go wrong with."}
{"text":"I have been to the Yard House twice and had two very different experiences. The first time I went with a group of people and we all found that the service was some of the worst we had in memory. At one point we wondered if our waiter would ever come back. When he was there he was very unhelpful and the other people in my party especially were not pleased with him. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger and I thought the food was alright at the time, but I later ended up getting sick. However, after my negative experience I was contacted by the restaurant and they apologized and invited me back. I was actually pleased with their customer service and how they reached out to me, so I did come back for a second time and was glad I did.

My second visit was almost like eating at a completely different restaurant. We were even seated at the opposite end of where we were the first time. This time our waitress was excellent and did a great job of making sure we had everything we needed. We ordered new things this time around like their calmari, lobster crab and artichoke dip, and the vodka shrimp pasta. Everything was excellent and we couldn't get enough.

Needless to say I ended up being very glad that I came back for a second chance. I have no more complaints about the Yard House other than it being a bit expensive. In any case my wife loved it even more than I did, so I am sure we will be back to try it again."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Has a ton of beers on tap and a pretty big menu. Never been there before, I asked one of my buddies what was good and he pointed to the spicy jambalaya. I decided to give it a whirl.

We started with the crab/artichoke dip which was pretty good, a bit salty though. The onion rings on the tower were very nice. Fried perfectly and great dipping sauce.

Jambalaya was pretty spicy.  You have your choice of pasta, jasmine rice or brown rice. Comes with peppers, sausage, crawfish, and some giant grilled prawns. I stuck with the pasta. It was tasty. Of like big brewery chains like BJs and Gordon Biersch, this one is probably the best of the pack."}
{"text":"After multiple days in Vegas and eating at various places downtown, me and my wife found ourselves frequenting the Yard House at LINQ.  Love the location in the newly renovated LINQ area between Flamingo and LINQ.  The menu is very versatile and suits many types of diets.  We are pescatarian so it was great to have many seafood and vegetarian options.  They have a place on their menu dedicated to vegatians that also uses meat alternatives.  The macaroni and cheese with truffle oil was incredible.  Everything we've eaten here was worth writing about.  Upstairs is a great seating option.  Our only complaint was the hostess wasn't very accommodating to us having a child, we felt like we had to find a seat ourselves that worked."}
{"text":"I love love love yardhouse! I am a vegetarian so most of the time there really aren't  many vegetarian options.  This place has so many options, I have a hard time making up my mind.  The beers are really good too!!  Highly recommend this place, the atmosphere is welcoming and enjoyable. The vegetarian wings are a favorite!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Rosie and William were the best , party of 11 , everything came out great and fast , drinks were always filled, My husband didn't know what he wanted to try from the beer he asked Rosie to surprise him, Rosie asked him 2 questions and brought out a great beer (I can't remember name). It was easter , my cousins birthday and she just got hitched and of course like always Yard house never let's us down. Food was grrreat !! Dessert was yummy !! And our drinks were fire !! (Fire: good,off the hook, worth the money,bomb). Our servers and our food and our company made for a great time."}
{"text":"Everytime I've been here I've had terrible service.  I would recommend going to another restaurant to avoid bad service."}
{"text":"Service is okay and the beer selection is cool as well.

The food is meh. I have tried a few different items, but will stick with liquid meals at this establishment haha.

The service is so-so as well. It's slow and they can be rude."}
{"text":"Went with my friend and we loved it. The beer selection was amazing! Our server was very helpful and got us samples of beer to find beers we liked. We ended up ordering an extra beer, yummo.

Being vegan, the server was very informed on their menu and what was vegan and what was not. The menu also has a selection of about 8 different vegan things to eat. We will be coming back for sure.

The only thing I can say for improvement is that, if they want to cater to vegans as it seemed on the menu, they need to have a separate fryer for vegan things like french fries. They have a huge kitchen so I am sure there is space to figure this out."}
{"text":"Be ready - this place is LOUD and busy!  Be prepared to wait.

Our visit was Thanksgiving day, meeting up with family for a late lunch together.

Some things to note, the tuna roll (appetizer) is not a traditional \"tuna roll\" as one would expect.  The fish n chips is delicous!  Beer selections are considerably better than most places I've visited.

While service wasn't \"AWESOME\" it wasn't bad.  Our server was a bit of a newbie so we cut her some slack.  Timing on the food was a little off... apps came first, but food followed way too quickly after the apps, not leaving enough time to enjoy the appetizers before the main course."}
{"text":"I work in the service industry. I was exhausted after a really long night at work and needed food. It was about thirty minutes to closing time, and a certain person didn't even care. His name is Jake and I highly recommend that you request him as a server. He was so kind and simply wonderful. Our food was amazing! The manger stopped by our table and was so sweet. The service and food quality are above expectations. I will go back every chance I get. Also, Jake had not only every detail of the menu known, he also knew about ALL the beers they have on tap as well! I couldn't be more impressed with the service i received. I highly recommend that you visit this restaurant."}
{"text":"Many bartender's here are like cheers, good ol friends that know your name.  

Excellent happy hour w/ a large variety & portions.  The menu is really for anyone.  I love the Spicy Tuna Roll the most.  It comes out like a layered cake instead of a sushi roll.  I ask for extra Sriracha or course & I love the dehydrated mushrooms on top.  It's shareable!! 

The Lobster Garlic Noodles & Chinese Garlic noodles are phenomenal.  Korean Street taco is tasty & I love the chili threads on top.  Pizzas are good & on happy hour.  

Hawaiian Mule is our favorite similar to a Moscow Mule.  For beers, if I don't get one of their many different beer flights, I'll get this Watermelon beer that's 10%!  It's nothing like a framboise, it's only a slight watermelon aroma, but taste like beer.  There's also a flight that's usually has it on the list to try. 

Ambiance is similar to any sports type bar.  I always sit at the bar & located next to the movie theater so perfect spot!  

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Pepper Jack, Poblano Burger... Awesome!  Spicy & juicy.  The sweet potato fries were Crispy & not soggy.

Black Truffle Burger has a different taste, not the best burger, but good for being hungry.  Both had soft buns & were cooked correctly.  The shoestring fries were crunchy, not as good as the sweet potato fries.  

Poke Nachos was one of the many new featured items & I highly recommend it!  Spicy chipotle mayo, crunchy wontons, not greasy & the poke didn't have any chewy pieces of fat.  Perfect starter or as an entree.

Service was slow, they are always busy so we enjoyed a leisurely dinner, & weren't in a rush."}
{"text":"No matter what I order here it is always always delicious! They have the best chicken tortilla soup!!! I also love their pineapple cider, so refreshing! It's expensive so I only come here in special occasions!"}
{"text":"I want to update my review. Lately yard house has been impressing me! they have a large menu with a wide variety of different foods. Happy hour is the best time to go for excellent prices on drinks and food. We had 2 beers 2 drinks Margarita pizza, spinach dip, jerk wings, and ahi sashimi for $55!!! With excellent service and friendly staff to boot!"}
{"text":"First time trying yardhouse and I have to say I am a fan! Upon entering you catch a peak at the keg room, and I was amazed to see over 100 different beers on draft. There was a small wait but my wife and I opted to sit at the bar. The bar staff is extremely knowledgeable of the beers which is quite impressive given the variety. I ended up getting a dogfish head 90 minute (a terrific IPA) and my wife ordered a mojito, which was made perfectly. 

Now to the food. We started with the Lobster Spinach dip and it was ok. Nothing bad, but I didnt completely love the flavor... but afterwards, I still cannot get over how amazing the Mac n Chz squared is! A mouthwatering portion of applewood smoked bacon, chicken and mushrooms cooked together beautifully makes me never want kraft ever again. I will definitely be faced with a difficult decision when I come back whether to try something else or indulge in this masterpiece again. All around great dining experience. The room is a little loud and kind of difficult to keep a conversation, but the service was great, food was spectacular, and cant beat the beer selection. Also being right next to the highroller was ideal as we rode it after dinner."}
{"text":"Came here in December, first time at a Yard House so we didnt know what to expect. We entered from the casino and we're told the hostess station was straight ahead, yes it was, clear across the entire restaurant, long awkward walk. She said 10-15 min wait, it was only a few min. The place is really cramped and loud, not what i like if im going out to eat. Its cool if u want to go cheer on a game or be loud and drink with friends, tvs EVERYWHERE U TURN, but that wasnt what we were into that night. Took awhile for our waiter to come over, when he did he was very nice, took our drink order. Ordered apps and dinner, it took soooo long to come out. We were not impressed at all everything even the drinks were just ok. I guess their main draw is beer????"}
{"text":"This restaurant is very nice, spacious, and had plenty of TVs to watch sporting games. Our servers were very attentive, and our food arrived in a reasonable amount of time. Will definitely return! I ordered the Moo Shu Eggrolls and they were delicious. The French onion soup was a tad watery, but still good. The fish and chips were a bit bland."}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite dinner/ lunch spots in Las Vegas.

Most of the time there will be a wait on a Thursday, Friday, or Saturday night. Food is well worth the wait.

Menu is pretty extensive and has something for everyone. Have tried the ultimate grilled cheese and it is one of the best I have ever had. Desert and drink options are very good as well. 

Prices are affordable and  more than fair for portions that you get."}
{"text":"I love this place for happy hour!  Great appetizers for super prices throughout the entire restaurant. I always get the boneless buffalo wings! Yum!"}
{"text":"This is, for sure, my number one place to go with my mother. I love love love this place. If you are ever in Vegas come to this Yard house. The food is AMAZING!!! They have something for everyone.  Their staff is amazing. Oh and if you go at night it is so nice and relaxing with the candle like lighting. LOVE IT."}
{"text":"This is seriously my all time favoritest chain restaurant ;-)
Let's start with the music.....out of this world! As in Moody Blues, Steely Dan, Jackson Brown etc etc.  
The food is always spot on fresh, tasty and up -to-date with whatever the newest diet need may be ie. vegan or gluten-free.
I've never had anything here that I didn't like. (Except several bad dates, the YH is my go-to for the usual meet and greet, so if the date is a dud I'll at least be getting fabby food and catch a game) Try the sweet potato fries app with the creamy maple bacon dipping sauce or the Cuban roast pork dip sandwich with pickles and a Dijon mustard spread and the side of au jus has a hint of BBQ. I don't care who you are, that's good shtufff.
The staff is great, everything is always clean. Happy hour is fabby, plenty of tv's for sports fans, a patio if you're so inclined to watch the movie-goers walk by.
Again, another place I have good luck with.....see my reviews for the Sand Bar or BJ's"}
{"text":"Good food, good beer and great service!! Ask for Kevin, awesome waiter!! I'll be back. Love that they have Apricot Ale on tap :)"}
{"text":"I ate here because they offer vegetarian and vegan options. Yard House uses Gardein products which is a vegan company with substitute meats. I took the vegetarian option, Gardein chicken wings and chose a sauce with no dairy. 

Also Julius is a great server. He double checked with me about possible allergies to cheese after my table ordered fries with cheese on the side. He didn't have to come back to check with me concerning their buffalo sauce but he did, and I am super thankful for that! 
This is a great little spot and Yard House has much to offer!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service!! Our group ate here multiple times and everyone was always very happy with there food. The prices were fairly good. Would definatley eat here again!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite restaurants in town! Everything that I order is AMAZING! I love to come here for lunch!! The Ahi tuna nachos AMAZING! The appetizers are dinner size portions! My favorite desert is the peach apple cobbler! They also  have a huge selection of beer and wine!  I plan on coming back often!"}
{"text":"We came back due to having a gift card from the last time we were there...huge thank you to the manager for giving us a second try, or vice versa! 

We had great service this time. Wonderful service. The waiter Trey gave us several suggestions and never seemed annoyed with all of our questions and never rushed us on ordering. When he went on break he brought in Blair and introduced her...I thought that was very nice. She was awesome as well giving is more suggestions for our second round of drinks. 

We ordered cocktails from their special menu in honor of the World Cup...they were yummy and strong! Our appetizer was the Hawaiian poke stack. I could eat this for days! Ahi tuna with carrot and dikon over flat fried wontons with an avacado and a very flavorful sauce on top. It was great.

We decided to get a pizza which we never get except from a pizza place. The BBQ chicken with onion, cilantro and tangy sauce was what we ordered. Overall the taste was on point. I wish I had ordered more sauce to go on top! My other half got clam chowder and said it was very hearty and had a to die for taste. 

We were too full to get dessert this time. We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is legit! Totally worth every penny. The food is out of this world. The truffle fries were a game changer! The lobster garlic noodles were amazing with huge chunks of lobster and shrimp cooked to perfection. My husbands ribs fell off then one and had great flavor and texture. The drinks are not weak and deliciously made. Service was friendly. All around amazing experience!"}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour menu & prices! Great location, patio is nice when it's not too hot out & great place to people watch. Good for a medium size group of people if you want. Just don't like how the bartenders make the drink glasses all sticky! Not sure if they let the booze rundown the glass & don't wipe it off? Happened tonight & the last time I was here before. Turkey pot pie is delicious & HUGE. Great portion sizes!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for a long time. I was with a friend, a vegetarian friend, and Trying to decide where to eat, I remembered about yard house serving vegan food. I also like vegan dishes but I like to add meat to them just for flavor. I ordered the fried calamari, not calamari rings, this one had tentacles and all. Also ordered The vodka shrimp pasta, which it was very good even though I couldn't taste the vodka. (There goes my plan of having food and drink for the price of one.)
The beer selection is humongous . Like a kid in a candy store i couldn't decide what to get so I went with the diet coke.
My friend ordered some green stuff and some green tea.
Atmosphere is great! Clean, great service, nice place to watch a game or meet some friends.
                                 Think I be back."}
{"text":"Rude employees, inappropriate conversations between employees in front of guests. Filthy restrooms. I've been MANY times, but I'll never go back."}
{"text":"Always solid. Good food. Usually a wait on Friday nights but nothing too crazy in my experience. Excellent beer selection of course. Haven't had a bad meal here ever and I've been to this one many times. Solid, reliable Desert Ridge dinner option (and there are many)."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the chain and have had great experiences at other Yard House locations but not here and I will go out of my way to avoid going to this location in the future. I felt totally crowded here and wasn't impressed with our bartender either. Maybe it was just that day, just that crowd and/or just that bartender but I'll stick to other YH locations in the future."}
{"text":"This place is ok. Lots if tvs so you can keep up with sports. Nice bar area. Service was a bit slow. Food tries too hard to be trendy. I had an entre salad and it came in a big stainless steel bowl. I had to ask for a serving plate, i wasnt really comfotable eating  my salad from a huge mixing bowl."}
{"text":"So I eat here a lot, and always sit at the bar. Food is awesome and service is awesome as well. The bartender that serves me does a fantastic job. Her name is Alli, definitely sit in her section. She works harder than any of the other employees. I used to regularly attend the town square location but now I will drive an extra 15 minutes to get to the Linq location."}
{"text":"We came Friday. The place was busy as expected. A place is defined by good service and good food. We had neither. It's started with a rude hostess and went downhill from there."}
{"text":"Waiting for a table of 2 on a Wednesday night (around 7:30pm) was about 30 min. We sat out on the patio and the weather was gorgeous! (surprising for Vegas!) What made it extra nice was that across from the patio, some guy sang while playing the guitar, and he wasn't bad either! It's located at the strip of The Linq hotel, where the High Roller is. It's a nice little strip when you're there at night, very lively!                                                                                

We ordered:

Ceviche - loved it but I feel the portions are too small for the price

Traditional chicken wings - asked for all the sauces on the side so I can try and they were, the jerk one was the best

Albacore Tuna Steak - loved this! Wish they gave a little more lol

And some black bean pasta from the apps category - it was bland. 

And entrées were:

Penne Chicken Pasta - this was a \"house favorite\"..it was alright. Wasn't too flavor. The portion was big, I couldn't finish, but then again we ordered a lot of apps

16oz? Steak - I tried some of this and it was super good! The meat was tender and juicy mmmmm!

Total bill came out to about $86.
 
I like the Yard House, just wish it wasn't too expensive. It's like the Nordstrom while BJ's is the Macy's, hahah!"}
{"text":"I walked through the doors of the Yard House and stopped dead in my tracks. Drool began to form at the corner of my agape mouth as I stared out over the immense keg room. I knew that I would enjoy this place immensely.

The Yard House is in a nice location. It's away from the main Strip, down near the airport, but not too far that a taxi ride is too expensive. We didn't check out any of the shops around the restaurant but it did look like somewhere worth coming back to.  We didn't have a reservation, but received a booth with no hassles or wait time. It was a Sunday night and there was a football game on and the restaurant was very busy and noisy, but our waitress told us that everyone usually left as soon as the game finished, which they mostly did. Our waitress was extremely helpful and friendly and gave us some delicious suggestions for beers to try. 

For dinner I ordered the Rib Eye, which was delicious and my vegetarian wife had the BBQ \"Chicken\" Salad. There is a massive selection of vegetarian meals on offer here, which apart from the beer was the main reason we came here. Both of our meals were very nice indeed.

After several beers and a perfect amount of food later we left the Yard House very full and very happy. The only downside to the whole night  was that our first very friendly waitress finished her shift shortly after we ordered our first beers. The waitress that took over from her was far from friendly and barely paid any attention to us all night. This wasn't enough to take away from a great night and if we're ever back in Vegas we will definitely be making a return visit here."}
{"text":"Went here on a recommendation from a friend, place looked pretty cool, everything is expect from a restaurant in Vegas. There was a 30 minute wait so we went to the bar to hang out while we waited. The bar has a great selection of beer, had trouble choosing what is get. Bartender let me  try out a couple beers before making a decision, I always like that.

Unfortunately the service took a bit of a bad turn once we got a seat at the bar to eat dinner. We waited a good amount of time for the guy who was previously serving us to take notice, not to mention anyone else. Had to call out to someone to finally get noticed. Got some chips and guacamole, it was delicious, as well as the fish and chips. No complaints about the food, I must mention the fries are pretty good, thinly cut and crispy.

I'd come back, but I won't be having dinner at the bar again."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I came here for happy hour the other night. The food was decent but the service took forever. We waited about 10-15 for our drinks and shots from the bar ( a couple of our shots were also brought out wrong) and we went around 10 pm so the restaurant wasn't very busy. Overall decent experience I just wish the service hadn't taken so long"}
{"text":"Hello Yelp Fans:  I am writing about a visit to the Yard House.  Following represents our experience:  

Beverages:  House wines are so-so.  If you have a refined palette, I don't recommend you order the generic house wine.  There was a good selection of beers - better choice for the money.

Appetizers:  We tried the calamari, the pita and spinach dip, and the firecracker chicken.  The calamari was very chewy.  I would not order this again.  
The pita chips were nice and crispy and just a touch of salt and the spinach dip was nice and thick.  Some spinach dips can have too much mayo in them.  This was nicely done.  
The firecracker chicken nuggets were a hit - they were nice and spicy, not dry, and actually could be eaten as an entree if ordered with a side of fried rice.  

Salad:  We ordered one house salad with ranch dressing and a caesar salad.  Both were served with the lettuce warm/room temperature and the plates were also warm.  The croutons on the caesar salad were soggy.  Neither salads were anything special.  We did not eat the salads, not worth the calories/effort to eat warm lettuce.  I would not  recommend ordering. 

Entrees:  The salmon and quinoa was a nice portion, but the salmon was a little dry.  It comes with a sauce, with the sauce (if you like the type of sauce served with it) made it less dry, but I feel any fish should stand alone regarding how it was cooked to maintain moisture (and not need a sauce).  
The ribs were \"okay\" nothing special, not a lot of meat on them, a little chewy.  The length of the rack was appropriate, but I would not recommend ordering them.     

Desserts:  We ordered the banana brûlée and one of the apple cobbler with ice cream.  
The brûlée was warm and soupy - would not recommend to order.  Flavor was not heightened by the bananas on the top which were brown in color and not from being torched, just brown. The top of the brûlée was NOT nice and crispy, no evidence of sugar on top and a torch used to brown it.  
The apple cobbler was very mediocre.  The ice cream was almost totally melted when it was served to us.  It was nothing special, save your money.       

Noise:  The noise level was high.  We could hardly hear the people at the end of the table for only eight people.  

Service:  Service was good, except we were never offered fresh black pepper on our salads and we had to ask for our water glass to be filled (that should be obvious).  

I hope this review is helpful to you!"}
{"text":"I normally Love this place, until my last experience last week. The bartender fraudulently changed my tip amount to herself on my credit card receipt after I left. I didn't know until I saw my statement this week. Glad I kept my copy of the receipt. I will be contacting BBB and management of yardhouse to report the bartender today. This is not only fraud but theft. Now I am very concerned about eating there & paying with my credit card. I'm extremely disappointed and will not be going g to that yardhouse location any longer. Please check your credit statements and make sure it's exactly what you signed for."}
{"text":"Yard House freaking ROCKS. Best restaurant ever. Great atmosphere (can be a bit loud some times), amazing menu, and everything they make is DELICIOUS. Seriously - order Asian, it's good. Order a salad, it's good. There's no skipping out and they offer \"snack\" size appetizers too! We ordered three snack size apps and lettuce wraps and it was $20...and we left FULL! I miss going there - we'll move back soon enough!"}
{"text":"Love the steak and lamb burger!
The place is clean and the server was courteous and friendly."}
{"text":"I love the Yard House. Today they went out of their way.
Every time I'm in the Valley I try to get here. Their food is great and the service is excellent. Beer selection can not be beat. I am pretty stuck on the Sushami but order something else also. Today it was a new type of taco the called the demon taco. I had the blackened fish taco \"demonized\" in which they use an encrusted cheese tortilla. It was GREAT! They were out of the beer I wanted and gave me a taster of another as I was making up my mind for the replacement. I ordered the taster then they apologized for it taking to long and the first was on them they said.
Afterward I went to the outlet mall and got what I needed. I headed back over and asked for some more water which they gladly served me. I told them my water had gotten hot and they invited me to bring my bottle in, they filled it, and chilled it in their refrigerator. So I had another beer, a great conversation, and chilled water when I left. Thanks!!!"}
{"text":"My GF and I had the lettuce wrap, ahi salad and artichoke dip..we ate it all and rolled out of there with full satisfying stomach!"}
{"text":"This is always a convenient spot to drop by at town square for happy hour or a drink to cool yourself down from walking around town square in 100F+, or while you're waiting to watch a movie.

I like that they have framboise on tap and i'm a fan of that.  The half price happy hour items feature their regular appetizers that come in full portion.  The tuna tartare stack or california roll (a stack of avacado, edamame and raw spicy tuna) are great.  Their thai chicken pizza is a great beer food item.  Chicken nachos is also good if you can handle the portion.

I used to go to Blue Martini upstairs a lot more but since they changed the menu Yardhouse just became a better choice."}
{"text":"The food at the Yard House ranges from good to great, but the turkey burger is fucking fantastic.  No joke, the best burger of any kind I've ever eaten.  I keep going back, thinking it's a fluke, but it's not. Every time, it's fantastic, and the salad it comes with is surprisingly flavorful and light.  Also, having a keg room the size of my apartment is a bonus.  As a beer snob, this is the place to drink.  The turkey burger makes it the place to eat too."}
{"text":"So. Good. Everything that I had was perfectly cooked and had awesome flavors. Big variety from salads, soups, great appetizers, burgers, seafood and sandwiches. The portions are huge! Also, they have a huge menu full of awesome beers and mixed drinks. The atmosphere is awesome, the workers are so friendly and funny and there are TVs everywhere so you can enjoy your sports game! Highly reccomended."}
{"text":"I think they block the cell signal so they won't get rebiewed. So, football happyhour, but nothing for the world series?  YH has always been mediocre, they aren't bad per se, but my sons don't even want to come here. 25 minutes to get an order in... arrogant servers .  I'd say they're mismanaged, perhaps mis-owned."}
{"text":"Fantastic lunch! We did the Ferris wheel and wanted to do In N Out. Too crowded. Second choice ended up being great choice. Three did pints, one beer flight. Very good beer details on over 100 possible beers.

Food was great. Beef AND veggie burgers. Ahi salad fantastic. Soup and half sandwich plate nice. 

Loved spacious atmosphere and great service."}
{"text":"Meh.  Sports bar.  Worse, a sports bar chain.  The outdoor patio was more attracitve, even if was part of the mall's covered car park.  I don't tolerate the smell of stale beer.  That's what greeted me at the inside podium.  There's bar food on the menu, of course.  Fried next to more fried stuff.  Come here after work and throw down some beers.  That would be fun."}
{"text":"Giving a five star cause that's was our experience. Travis was our server and he was on point and tentative and he didn't miss a beat. I appreciates multitasker on top of our order being correct as well. He was pleasant and efficient for our late lunch. We got here for happy hour which seems to change every so often. Maybe twice a year, but they can accommodate your vegetarian or vegan need. Travis was ind enough to mention that the dry oil was universally used for meat or cheese fry also, which we had figured but was super cool to be informed. Atmosphere is as to be expected. Music and sports to enjoy and always a crowd. I'd come here again."}
{"text":"Yard house. What can I say... I feel like I only wanna go here at happy hour these days. I'm veganish and like that they have veggie options. However... I'm finding their pricing getting to be a  it ridiculous. So I was looking for the Thai Gardein chicken pizza and they took it off the menu... along with a few other items I enjoyed. So that sucks. Service was good enough... what is should be ya know. Since I couldn't get my pizza I went with the Margarita pizza instead. It was ok. I feel like it was over cheesed and their spin on it was different than what I'm used to. Using giant chunked tomatoes instead of slices which was ok, and full cloves of garlic which was Alonso ok. The Gardein chicken fingers are always great. And my favorite is the Gardein Orange chicken. Which is like 18-19$ depending on location I think. And that seems a bit much. All in all... there isn't a ton of satisfaction here these days. But they have some good eats and of course great beer and cocktail options."}
{"text":"Yardhouse is a chain that's located everywhere in California, but I've never had any interest in going here. We came here since it's conveniently located near our hotel. I wasn't that hungry, so I just got the ahi poke tartare appetizer. I eat a lot of poke & this was very good & fresh! Only thing is next time, l'd probably ask for less soy sauce.

Server was also very attentive & friendly!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I were passing thru town (coming from the East coast driving home to Chicago) stopped in late for some dinner. The hostess and waitress were very friendly and our waitress explained the menu. I had the grilled cheese and tomato bisque... SO GOOD!! My husband had a burger which was cooked perfect (medium) & juicy. He was very happy! Great find for weary travelers!"}
{"text":"Service was prompt and friendly. The beer fresh and a great selection of Sunday games. We had the bacon bbq and chedder burger (rum bbq sauce was sweet and tasty) and the Korean pork belly street tacos. Both very yummy. Woukd recommend."}
{"text":"The bartenders, Oz and Aimee are great. My boyfriend and I always sit at the bar and get great service from them. The Spinach Dip is amaaaazing! I love that they have my super girly beer (lambics Framboise!), yummy food, great ambiance, and we get to watch the games from any corner of the restaurant!!"}
{"text":"We're new to the area and decided to eat at Yard House after a long day of unpacking. We'd never been to YH before.  Would we go back? - probably, but I wouldn't say it's my #1 place to eat.  The menu was good sized with many different options.  We started with the deviled eggs - not something you see on most menus.  They were quite tasty.  For dinner, I ordered the Ahi sandwich and hubby had a burger.  Both pretty good, but we probably could have shared just the fries from one of the sandwiches and even then still had plenty left over.  There were a lot of fries....and they're matchstick fries, which aren't my favorite.  Service was very good.  Andrew was friendly and attentive, and after we told him about all the moving and unpacking we'd been doing, he made sure to keep the beverages coming (non-alcoholic, he wasn't trying to get us drunk.). Overall, a good experience."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and so far I've found their food very good! Service was good, and the variety of beer is EXCEPTIONAL!!! I'm holding off on the 5 star because I've heard a few complaints from my friends about consistency. Consistency on food quality and on service quality. I've been there thrice and if by the fifth time I don't encounter any problems I will bump it up to a 5... your move Yard House!
P.S. yeah I used the word thrice!"}
{"text":"We totally pigged out here!  A great alternative to Vegas buffet.  The Garlic Noodles are so yummy.  The BBQ chicken pizza is not bad either.  Even my preschooler found the food tasty.  The atmosphere is casual and everyone seemed to be having a good time.  It could be a bit loud, but worked out well since my kid was watching a video on the ipad."}
{"text":"I love Yard House!  Never disappointed when eating here.  Great sized martini's, deliciously decadent chicken nachos, variety of vegetarian/vegan dishes, and the crunchy seared ahi tuna salad is so delightfully satisfying.  Oh and service ROCKS here too!  Attentive, friendly staff from the front door to the server.  Make sure to come here for happy hour too...yummm...looking forward to my quick return."}
{"text":"I don't know why people like this place. Please note all the things I don't like about Yard house. Perhaps you will agree with some of them. 
- there are no decent drink prices. Beer is expensive, wine is moderately priced, cocktails are absurd 
- mu Shu egg rolls taste like cat food 
- tuna poke has huge chunks of sometimes tough tuna
- summer salad was nice with clementines and strawberries
- I do like the selection of videos they play on tv and the music is general good too
- service is always decent 
- French onion soup is mediocre at best."}
{"text":"I was a bit skeptical before giving Yard House a try since I'm not really one for chain restaurants. Upon entering, I was greeted by friendly service and an immense tap selection, over 120 beers in fact! They also have special limited-edition beers, which are definitely a must-try. The food is pretty phenomenal and doesn't evoke the typical standard, somewhat-bland flavor of more common chain restaurants. I had the garlic shiitake noodles as a 'snack' (at least that's what it's listed as on their immense menu) which could have easily been the main dish for those who hadn't gone since breakfast without eating, which I had =P I followed up with the gardein spicy thai chicken pizza. Both were washed down with an excellent sour ale and a great IPA. The cherry on top to the night would've been a Cavaliers win, but unfortunately that was not meant to be. At least the food made up for it!"}
{"text":"Our server Matt was absolutely perfect! He was well knowledge of the beer list and very helpful with suggestions of our food items. I had the six pack sample which was absolutely delicious pairs with the pear & Gorgonzola Flat bread - YUM!"}
{"text":"Absolutely do not go here! My family went to dinner here tonight and it was by far the worst display of service I have ever seen. We were sat on the patio and didn't receive a greet until 20min after arriving and it was by a random worker walking by. She took our orders. Our server came by when he dropped off the drinks much later. He failed to introduce himself to us until he came back a second time. We never received the appetizer we ordered. My food came out wrong, they brought me a turkey club when I ordered a chicken sandwich. Our waiter Brandon came by to check on us 5 minutes after the food had been dropped off to see I didn't have any. He came back a couple minutes later still unsure what I ordered. It took a total of 12 minutes after this whole ordeal for me to get my food, by that time everyone I was eating with was finished. The manager stopped by and said it was my fault to have ordered the wrong sandwich... except he wasn't the one who took my order so how would he know. No apologies.. no urgency when they mistaking bring you the wrong food, lack of good management, zero customer service, extremely slow and shitty service. Absolutely worst service I have ever experienced, don't go to this establishment unless you want to ruin your night."}
{"text":"We stayed at Red Rock and sought out a dining option. My significant other expressed that the Yardhouse was a welcomed option. We went on and found ourselves at the bar where we ordered food and drinks promptly. The service was fast and the food hot.

 However, the quality was less than favorable. The turkey burger was dry.. very dry! The appetizer, chicken wraps, was ground chicken that appeared to be grocery store packed worth no flavor. Side sauces could be added but they lacked flavor as well. Not to mention the cost was strip level ($65.00 for 2). 

Casey, a male bartender,  kept hiring on the girl next to us. He was using vulgar language like F*** bombs and S***. My fiance called him out toward the end of the meal at which point he comped a drink and disappeared for the evening. My better half pointed out that if it weren't for Shelby, the other bartender and only reason this is 2 stars, we would have  walked out and made a scene in the process. 

Never again Yard house! NEVER!!"}
{"text":"The perfection of mediocre. Always consistently average which is okay I guess, you get what you expect. However, the host Vince today was such a complete a-hole and couldn't bother to even crack a smile or greet the customers as the approached. Just such a jerk that I thought I would look up the reviews. I'm shocked to see 4 stars on this place."}
{"text":"This place is bomb!! Been to a few other restaurants around the California area but this Scottsdale location is in the perfect spot. So close to my house and I can go get some good food when I'm finished shopping. Went there a couple weeks ago now and was immediately greeted at the door by the host and was seated right away. Matt was our server and recommenced the chicken nachos and also the fresh fish of the day which was the swordfish. My gf and i actually never had them and were quite impressed!! This place is the real deal."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place, I mean their slogan is \"Great Food, Classic Rock, World's Largest Selection of Draft Beer,\" what more can a girl ask for? I have to say the food was good, the music selection was awesome, and they did have an extremely large beer menu. I had the Stella Artois, which was delicious, but at $6.00 a glass I limited myself to two (I am a poor college student after all). The fish and chips was also surprisingly delicious, but a tad pricey at $15.00, although their fries were really good. The restaurant was very spacious, and nicer than I expected. The service was kinda slow, but I was with a group of fourteen. I would definitely like to come back here and try some more of the beers, that is when I have a little more money."}
{"text":"Visit this location before because of kid quest, we were put on wait when there were several open tables, which I notice when we were being sat. Our waitress was nice but inattentive took too long to bring our drinks, and I ordered sons pizza with our drinks, said to bring it when done. the pizza came out after our meals,,not served water at all, had to wait for our waitress for a while just to get our bill, no other waiter acknowledged us while we were looking around for her. Will probably not revisit."}
{"text":"I'm pregnant. It's been an hour since we ordered our food. It's about to be 3 pm. We should have just waited for happy hour. All I ordered was one short rib taco lol. So sad. :( I would ask to speak with the manager but I can't wait another hour. One star for the taco as it bears no fault. Delicious in fact. :P"}
{"text":"Large menu, almost over-whelming in that there are so many things to eat.  Probably over-ordered.  Oh, well, won't be the last time.
Huge vegan selection.  Not that I am vegan, but my internal organs need a break sometime.
Excellent service, wine list, and food.  Again, no surprises; food was as represented.
I suggest the skirt steak salad or the ahi tuna sandwich.  Both were great.
The wine list was thorough, but not huge.  The prices were great; plus, like Maggiano's and the Capital Grille (but unlike Morton's), you can taste almost anything before ordering -- a great way to sell a bottle of wine.
Would eat here again."}
{"text":"We noticed this humongous establishment at the front of the Fashion Square mall soon after we arrived in Scottsdale.Being lucky enough to have a wife who is a good sport when it comes to me checking out a new beer place we headed over here for dinner last Tuesday night.We got seated in a cosy booth and I took advantage of Delirium Tremens being on tap.I think they had an unbelievable 150 beers on tap.The restaurant comes across as an upscale sports bar with a number of big screen lcds plastered around the ceiling but with the volume pretty much off.Supposedly the founder's vision included classic rock and good contemporary stuff but we didn't hear too much music that evening.My wife tried the pork carnitas and I'm a sucker for good old nachos.Everything came out in good time and tasted fine.It's a lovely joint but being well under half occupied on this Tuesday evening the lack of any music seemed to magnify the football field size of the place.Chip the manager popped by to check on our state of satisfaction and apologized for the almost indiscernible music volume.There is a Yard House in San Diego but I am not inclined to go there because I can eat as well,drink as well and create a better atmosphere in our own house."}
{"text":"Seriously the worst restaurant experience I have ever had.

Came here with 3 friends: 2 omnivores, 1 gluten-free, and myself a vegan. I've been to yard house a few times before, never been hugely impressed with the food, but they have some vegan/vegetarian options without limiting the rest of the group.

So as we're ordering, I ask for the vegan burger with fries, to which our waiter, Adrian, replies that the fries are NOT vegan because they are fried in the same oil as the meat and other animal products... WHAT??? I was perplexed as was the rest of my group. Out of curiously, inquired about the vegan buffalo wings, and other vegetarian items on their menu that are fried. He informed me that they are not vegetarian either. I was really concerned about the fact that they list these items as \"vegetarian\" or name them \"vegan burger\" on their menu, but they actually aren't? Frying things in the same oil is unacceptable, people have allergies and dietary restrictions.

My options for a vegan side according to Adrian were steamed vegetables or veggie sticks. Lame. Disappointing. I got the steamed vegetables and they were literally cold in a pool of water, clearly frozen then microwaved, pretty nasty. My friend also ordered them and was equally disappointed. My vegan burger tasted pretty iffy. 

I asked to speak with the manager and relayed all that had happened to him, and he was shocked that the waiter had said those things were not vegetarian, because they are. They have a designated fryer for the fries and other vegetarian items. HOWEVER, he said that sometimes the cooks are lazy and will get the fryers mixed up, so they do sometimes fry animal products in the vegetarian oil. Again... What??? Isn't it your responsibility as a manager to  MANAGE your cooks and teach them NOT to cross contaminate the oil? Unacceptable excuse, in my opinion. My whole group was frustrated for me, and I just felt so defeated and uncomfortable, after expecting a pleasant restaurant experience since they have \"vegan\" options, or so I thought.

AND to top it all off, guess who got food poisoning and was throwing up all night after their meal? THAT'S right, I did. The rest of my group also had stomach aches the rest of the evening.

Truly. Disgusted.

Don't go here. Lame excuses, terrible service, our food took forever, and I got sick from a \"vegan\" burger which is pretty hard to do, since there aren't any animal products to spoil.

I would give it zero stars if I could. I will never return to another yard house again after this experience."}
{"text":"This is the best Yard House I have visited. When we make our trip to the Red Rock resort we always stop for a meal here. The food, drinks, and service went beyond my expectations. Matt C. took care of my family. He was extremely attentive and made sure everything was going well. He had to leave and passed us on to Christine, who was just as awesome. I had fish, I cannot remember the name but it was mighty tasty. I also had a few Paulaners as well. The kids menu has a good selection for the little ones. If you're passing through the casino and your tummy is grumbling, I highly recommend stopping in for a bite and drinks."}
{"text":"Came here for a happy hour with my coworkers. One of my coworkers ordered some nachos, a \"sushi,\" and some cabbage wraps. Food was pretty mediocre. The nachos were good, but definitely a lot of food. Also got a little sick of it after a while. The sushi wasn't my favorite and they made it very different from the traditional sushi. The cabbage wraps were my favorite out of the three.

Happy hours prices are pretty good! Nice to just go and hang out."}
{"text":"We have visited other YHs in the valley but consider this to have the best and friendliest service. We are real fans of their Happy Hour menu and of their \"visiting beers and ales.\" You can make a meal of the Happy Hour appetizers without breaking the budget, you really feel you get \"value.\"  The flatbread (not on the app menu) has become a spouse favorite, as has the Angel Hair Pasta from the \"Mains Menu.\" 

I have been disappointed by the desserts, I'm a fan of the Kona Coffee Sundae but over the past few years it has become so small that the last time I was there I found myself spooning out the \"airy\" whipped cream in an effort to find the ever shrinking scoop of ice cream. The servers used to ask if you wanted extra spoons so you could share...now they seem to know better than to even ask...at more than $7.00 this isn't good enough or big enough to represent value, as a result, we stick with the main menu and appetizer menu items.

Having \"dissed the desserts\" we're still fans of everything else and visit regularly."}
{"text":"This was our third stop for Angela H's goodbye party.

I ordered a Boddington's and shared a Spicy Tuna Roll with my Yelp-izzle David C. The Spicy Tuna Rolls was made in a unique way and was very tasty. 

I ordered a Snake Bite for my second drink and it came out wrong. I forgot that Yard House was one of the places that call a Guinness/Pear Cider a Black Velvet. The waitress gave me no problem about bringing me a new one even though it was my fault.

It was GOOD TIMES with some effin awesome people and a great place to end the night!!"}
{"text":"They have a great variety of food here and the staff is really nice. Unfortunately the food was not that tasty. It wasn't horrible, just not what i was expecting. The Mac and cheese was pretty bland and milky, so I would not suggest you order that. The manager was great abt removing that from our bill. 

I love that they have the Gardein meat substitute here and have so many options for vegetarians. The Gardein Buffalo wings were a great consistency, but too salty and spicy. The truffle fries were good. The dessert sampler is a great idea. Our favorite was definitely the lemon. It was delicious. I will order that alone next time."}
{"text":"Go during happy hour for great drink and food deals. Prices for some regular dinner menu options are as much as 1/2 off and the deal goes until 6 PM."}
{"text":"Love it! Love Happy Hour prices! Love the Sweet Potato fries! Love the service! love the tvs, the music, the lighting, the location (the Mall!)"}
{"text":"Spend a week in Vegas, this is the only restaurant I actually wanted to review, oh my goodness this please beats most all the casino restaurants in this price range. Happy hour is awesome, drinks are great. Service is really good. Started eating all the food then thought about taking pictures sorry. Pleated very well."}
{"text":"I needed to get out of my house last night after a stressful evening and my friend had time she needed to kill so we grabbed dinner here just in time for their happy hour! Steven was our server and he ruled! We were a little early for the Happy Hour and he was patient with us letting us wait to order that way we could save a few bucks. He even wished us a happy \"happy hour\" and was there for us throughout our entire experience. When I'm having another bad night and need a quick comfort food & drink, I'll be sure to stop by Yardhouse for their \"Happy\" Happy Hour :)"}
{"text":"Love the happy hour speicials & the small bites menu too. This is the best place to catch a bite at WestGate in my humble opinion. Always a wait on the weekends peak dinner hours & Cardinal games just forget about it. Wait out the door just wait for table. INSANE! But that tells ya all ya need to know that the food is top notch."}
{"text":"I love this place for their fantastic martinis!!!!! YAY for great tasting drinks!!!  the sweet tart, hpnotini and the gobbstopper are my favorites...they have a decent mojito too...I like to go here with my friends to catch up and get a lil tipsy!!  It is a large restaurant with lots of space and many tvs everywhere...fun little scene...they have great appetizers...I like their spianch dip and their chicken tenders!! Yum...great bar food!!!"}
{"text":"I usually have a great experience here, but tonight it was pretty terrible. Our waiter was very unattentive and our drinks we're empty for most of the meal. We ordered the seared ahi appetizer and it was good as usual, but my fish and chips were very greasy, and all I could taste was oil. The drinks were very weak too. I don't know if our waiter was new but I saw most of his tables looking around for him to come by. Overall not a great visit."}
{"text":"Why in Sam Hill have I not reviewed this place?!? 

Let's just say I order the EXACT same thing when I come here every time so this review is going to be short :) I ALWAYS order the Spicy Tuna Roll.
This in no way is a roll...it's like a birthday cake of goodness!
Here is it's beautiful mug!:

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yard-house-las-vegas?select=Xtt3fQqgiV4P9kOejJRFAQ#Xtt3fQqgiV4P9kOejJRFAQ

If I get lucky we hit the HH and it's HALF PRICE! 

I will say that hubby got the Mushroom Lettuce Wraps and they were sooooooooo good! 

I just love some of the menus offerings! But I tend to always order my cake :)

The last time we were there they have a huge new section of the menu of veggie burgers and vegetarian items! I can not wait to go again soon to try out some of the new items...not sure if they are so new I don't think I noticed them last time...because I always order the same thing and I don't open the menu :)))))

YUMMMMM it makes me want one right now!!!!!"}
{"text":"Service was very friendly.  Go in time for happy hour drink discounts.  I had the Vodka shrimp pasta and it was very good!"}
{"text":"Service at the reception was not well coordinated we got conflicting messages on when to get a table. The steak I ordered did not have any taste and not fresh at all. Overall, the food was very bland."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends after a hike at Red Rock. The menu is huge, the prices for happy hour are great, the service was really good considering we were a party of 12 and the place was packed. The server didn't even wince when people started asking for separate checks during checkout. 

Lots of options for vegetarians, carnivores, drunkards, and people just looking to have a good meal in a relaxed setting."}
{"text":"Wow!  Now that's what I call a Beer Selection.  If you are in Vegas and want to sample some beers, this is a great place to check out.  Unfortunately for me, I came here a day after my birthday and I was still in major recovery mode so I did not really get to take advantage of their abundant beer list.  

Their food was just okay for me but then again, maybe me being in recovery mode affected my taste buds too so maybe I'd give them another shot.  Definitely will be back at least to get some beers as I love fresh beer.  Bottled beer does not do the name \"Beer\" justice.  

And the service was excellent all around.  Since we had to wait for a table, we actually hung out at the bar for about 20 to 30 mins.  And since they had so many beers, we needed to ask the bartender for advice.  He was extremely patient with us.  And once we sat down at our table, again, the server, was excellent.  She kept coming around every few minutes to check on us and make sure everything was okay.  

3 Words: BEER! BEER! BEER!"}
{"text":"So glad Summerlin finally got a great restaurant!!! We love this place the food is great and the atmosphere is fun. Ricky and Anthony (manager) are awesome!! Their service was out of this world along with everyone else."}
{"text":"My wife and I went on our date night here tonight.  While this was only our second time here I must say it was quite disappointing.  I ordered the ribeye and shrimp and asked for it to be cooked medium.  I ended up with a well done steak and an incredible amount of char.  First off for a $32 steak that's advertised as being 12oz sure seemed to be an incredibly thin steak that looks like it was purchased from Walmart.  The steak had very little seasoning and came with a \"house made\" steak sauce that tasted like a combination of A1, water and worcestershire sauce.  The shrimp were a decent size but they arrived cold, rubbery and tasted like imitation crab meat.  

Our server Christopher was incredibly knowledgeable about their menu and was very helpful when describing their unadvertised side items and he was also helpful on suggesting different menu items.  He gave very helpful tips on what to avoid on their menu and was very honest.  The restaurant staff seemed very polite and the overall appearance of the restaurant was very clean.  I'm typically not a person to complain about a restaurants food quality but this really needs to be addressed."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar for happy hour and the food/drinks did not disappoint. They have a bajillion beers to choose from. I'm not the biggest beer drinker and the bartender did a great job recommending some good options. We also had a pizza and the spicy egg grills off the happy hour menu. They were quite good.

The only negative part of my visit was the seating. We sat at the bar. There were a ridiculous number of bar stools crammed around the bar. Thank goodness we were there pretty early Ned didn't have to sit next to a stranger. It would've been like sitting in their lap"}
{"text":"Definitely not a good experience and WILL NOT be back! Went here with Steven for lunch and we were super excited to eat and it sucks because we won't be back. The service and atmosphere along with beer selection was awesome but everything else was below average. Stared with the truffle fries which were good and Steven got the lobster macaroons which  was way to expensive and tasted like Alfredo with canned lobster on top and I got the ribs which tasted like it was heated up in a microwave. The waitress said the plate is hot (normally you can still move the plate not in this case) I went to push it further away and BURNT my fingers the plate was hotter than a fajitas skillet plate & was so hot my ribs sizzled on a normal plate, than my beans and corn sizzled along with it. $70 later not impressed."}
{"text":"OMG best food ever! There were so many appealing choices, we had a hard time deciding, and agreed we would have to come back and try all the dishes that didn't make the cut on the first visit.
Everything that came out to others seated around us, we were like, \"What is that?\" and trying to identify it on the menu to make a note. Spent $80 for the 2 of us on this trip, and well worth it...definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I typically love this restaurant and after living overseas for 3 years, this was our first dinner back in the states. However, we were not impressed with the wait staff. It was a Saturday night so we didn't mind the 45 minute wait for a table but it was a bit annoying to have to wait for more drinks. Our drinks were brought out by a different server each time and when they forgot to bring one for someone in our party they would blame the primary server for not putting it on the ticket or the bar for not making it. 

I will say that the food is always great but the service could use a refresher."}
{"text":"I personally hate dark and loud trendy millennial eateries, but this place was aight! Food and servuce was good.  Restrooms were all automated, soap, water, dryer, and door...just wave.  Waitress Taylor, quick, bubbly, friendly, cordial."}
{"text":"Always a good time and great food... the steak on my salad  wasn't done just the way I wanted it... and the waiter in the manager were wonderful about fixing it right away and getting me a new one Yum!"}
{"text":"Love Love Love!!! Service is A1! Ask for Angie at the bar.... drinks are delish! Assistant GM Bobby made us feel at home.  Super Cool Vibe!"}
{"text":"The waiter was fantastic, but the service stopped there.  It took us 15 minutes to get our drinks after ordering at our table.  The food was lackluster and prices too high.  Due to capacity restrictions, our friend walked outside for just a moment to check on something and was not let back inside.  After speaking with the manager, he indicated that it was just tough luck.  He didn't care.  We left never to return...btw party of 9!!!"}
{"text":"We ended up meeting  a few friends here for a birthday dinner and drinks. It was a Friday night, so it was pretty busy.  We ordered a few drinks and some appetizers. I went with the Korean BBQ beef appetizer and wifey had the Ahi Poke bowl. The Ahi Poke bowl was great, and only $5! My korean beef had good flavor, but the texture of the meat was a bit unappealing and there were tons of fatty gristle pieces on my dish.  I had the pineapple express to drink, which was great. . The overall experience was pretty good. Because it was SOOO busy, people were crowded in the slim hallway blocking the entrance/exit and the way to the bathrooms, which badly needed to be regulated. Overall, cool spot with good service and decent food. I'd go again."}
{"text":"Instant potatoes on a $30+ ribeye meal... not much more to say there. Great drink selection but won't be eating here or expecting real food.."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, great food & service.  Either valet or park nearby.  Love the poke bowl and street tacos.  One of the best beer selections in town.  We love this place.  Good for date night or with the kids as the kids menu is good as well."}
{"text":"Very good food, the portions are generous, and the alcohol selections are impressive at times. This location gives generous portions and I enjoy Yardhouses' location. It is right off the freeway and can easily be accessed. The staff members were always pleasant when I visited this restaurant. The beers are great, the cocktails get a thumbs up, and they do have TVS.   Great place - check it out!"}
{"text":"Here with a group for work and we have been here before and this was about 6:30 PM on a Monday night.  It is in the \"LINQ\" area and if not familiar with this area, it is an area off Flamingo Blvd right where the High Roller is (Google it).  It is a chance to get away from slot machines and gambling for a bit because it is a pedestrian walkway area with mostly shops and restaurants like you would see at any outdoor mall area. 

Positive;  They were able to seat about 20 of us on a long high top table with virtually no wait.  Some of us had \"adult beverages\" and for those who may not know you can walk around with alcohol on the streets in LV.  The food was good, service was awesome and the craft beer (+1) was some of the best.

Negative: When came in they require us to dump out or drink what we have before they would seat us.  THIS IS LV and I have NEVER had to do that.  There were 20 + of us and guess what management, we will be buying another round I am sure.  I HATE Nitpicky stuff like this and NEVER had this problem at any other establishment.

I give it a 3+"}
{"text":"Ok for lunch-the food was not bad and a mistake on the order was quickly corrected but the seating staff needs to work on their presence..."}
{"text":"You will not get food before your next birthday. I guarantee it! The Yard House is usually pretty timely, but this location, as dead as it was, took almost an hour after we were immediately seated.

In addition, after I paid the bill (I requested it early, because who knows when it will have arrived), we noticed my buddies entree had mushrooms, even after specifically requesting none. This was important, mainly because of his food allergy to them.

The managers offer. A few drinks for the road? Real responsible managing. Sure, we'll have a few drinks for the road, while we're strolling our kids back home on the strip!"}
{"text":"Our server helped us with the menu and he was patient and had a sense of humor. Great place to hangout. But super packed and loud."}
{"text":"Went here on mothers day with a party of 10. We called ahead to try and get a reservation and they would not accept....a little odd, but we showed up anyway. We were seated promptly and immediately offered drinks. The waitress, Jenny, seemed to be attentive and didn't let our drinks go. I drink A LOT of iced tea and measure my service by how long my glass sits empty, how much ice, etc. So, in this regards, huge points with me.

The food also came out promptly and was well made. Clam chowder was GREAT and steaks were really good.

Overall, we had a great experience, but it was weird that we were not offered any dessert....

Kids portions are huge (too much) and the adult sized portions were more than enough."}
{"text":"What more could an Irishman ask for? 100 beers on tap? DONE! Not just the beer, but get happy from 3-6pm with select appetizers and pizza.

Here are my fav's: Bernaise sliders and chicken lettuce raps. The pizza is also good. I have had the tai chicken, bbq and hawaiian. Me likes the hawaiian the best. 

For entree, I like the scalopes over orzo pasta. The size is a bit small, but packs a punch of flavor. 

70's rock.."}
{"text":"I absolutely love coming to Yardhouse. It has a great atmosphere and a huge menu. The employees are all really nice, I haven't had one bad waiter/waitress every time I go there.

They have a great happy hour menu, which is usually when I go. (Because of course I'm trying to eat good on a budget.) I have tried almost everything on their happy hour menu and haven't been disappointed once! Their sliders are amazing and their chicken nachos is definitely plate you get to share for all.

I'm not a huge beer drinker, but they have a big selection to choose from so I feel like anyone can find something for them on the menu! 

The only reason I give Yardhouse a 4 star is because they don't have some kind of rewards system. As much as I come here, I would definitely sign up if they had one."}
{"text":"Love this Yard House. They have happy hour during the week and it was an amazing deal. For two pizzas, it was only $12 and a pizza can definitely be shared by 2 people. They also had a bunch of other items for happy hour. The service was fantastic! We had Pablo as our server and he provided exceptional service! He did great with his timing of the check and refilling drinks. Overall it was one of the best experiences I've had at a chain restaurant in a long time!"}
{"text":"My visit to Yard House did not start out so well.  Coming out of the movie theatre I was faced with the patio belonging to the Yard House.  So I entered the patio which had at least 10 empty tables and asked the servers who were there if we could sit anywhere.  They answered: Oh, no, you have to go inside to the station and ask for a table.  We went inside and immediately upon entering saw a young man at a computer station.  We asked for a table on the patio to which he answered: You have to go to the end of the restaurant (pointing) by the steel doors.  We continued  walking to the steel doors and ask for a table on the patio.  The answer from the blonde young lady (don't know her name, my apologies) was \"just a moment.\"  At this point she began to wipe down some board and wiped.... and wiped....  My husband and I looked at each other while we waited for her to finish wiping.  Then she asked :\" and how is your evening going? \"  To which I answered \"not so good. \" I told her about having to wait for a table while the patio is almost empty.  She didn't appreciate the comment, geared up an attitude, and repeated what I said incredulously to the young lady who was soon to be our server \"Kassie\"  We said to her: \"all we want is a table.\"  
It is amazing to me that patrons have to walk to the back of the restaurant to a station where they can be assigned a table on the patio.  Is this a way to have patrons burn more calories so they can eat more? Doesn't it make more sense to have that station near the patio area albeit inside the restaurant.  Just saying.  But what got me what the attitude of the blonde station lady continuing to do her busy work while we waited for a \"table assignment\"  Could the wiping have waited? A simple, \"I'll get you a table right away\" would have gone a Longggggggggg way.   Enough said.
Our orders were Turkey Pot pie and a turkey burger with fries. My husband specified that he wanted no dairy on his turkey burger (it came with cheese).  After a bit, he was informed that the turkey burger mix was made with milk.  I thought that it was great of them to share this information.  They could have easily not told him and who would have known.  He substituted a \"Gardein burger\" which was a soy substitute made to taste like beef.  My turkey pot pie came as a huge plate covered by puff pastry. I soon found out that only the center of the plate contained filling (it was the type of deep dish that pasta is usually served in--with the wide rim)  So basically the rim was covered with puff pastry as well.  Not a problem. I thought the portion was good enough for one person.  The pot pie filling lacked enough celery. Celery being a most important ingredient to good flavors in a pot pie. (did I tell you guys that I make a mean pot pie???) I digress.  It also lacked pearl onions.  Am I the only one who puts  those delicious little onions in a pot pie??? Well, it could have been regular onion pieces that would have been fine.  The filling had plenty of large chunks of al dente carrots and plenty of turkey meat.  So I am making my recommendations to the chef:  More celery, more onions and cut up the carrots smaller.  
As my husband ate his \"soy\" burger silently, I wondered about the silence.  As he was nearing the end of his meal, I asked if he would give me a little piece of the burger to taste.  He did.  And then politely, I remove the piece out of my mouth with a napkin.  I found it to be vile.  Asked him how he could eat that he answered: it is what it is.  Wow,  what a trooper!  I would rather drink 2 liters of colonoscopy cleanser than eat that.  Just saying.  Kassie our waitress  was attentive and kept the water glasses filled so we have no complaints about that.  So all in all I am giving one star for telling us that there was dairy in the turkey burger, one star for Kassie's service and one star for my turkey pot pie.  Note to chef:  Celery and Pearl onions--it's not that hard to do."}
{"text":"Good food, cold beer! Nice to stop by after a Coyotes game or a concert at the arena. Service has always been good, and I have rarely had to wait on an off-game/concert night. Try the Pasta w/ Vodka Sauce if you have a chance."}
{"text":"Got seated quickly while it being busy on a Saturday night. I would not recommend ordering anything with chicken. The chicken in the nachos and the thai pizza were very bland. Like they just boiled it and put it in the food hoping that the sauces would cover up the blandness.  Then when we told the waitress that we didn't want to order anymore drinks and that we wanted our check, she took my glass that still had beer in it without asking me if I wanted it. Granted, it was a drink left, but I would like to be asked first before taking it in a rush. If you got to a Yard House, go to the one near West Gate. Better tasting good and better service."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Yard House!! They have a fantastic happy hour. Everything I have ordered here has been excellent. They play great music and the servers are so friendly. This is a great place to go to to watch any type of sport game!"}
{"text":"Let me point out first and foremost, I am impressed by the CONSISTENCY at Yard House each time I dine there.  No matter the location, I can always count on delicious food and great service.  With such a large menu, it really is a wonder that they can get it right every time... and I was feeling particularly hungry after an arctic Coyotes-Hawks game.  

Truffle Fries= heaven in my mouth.  Topped with parmesan cheese and chopped parsley, this \"Snack\" item was definitely worth the calories.  Regular fries will never live up to their full potential again.

On the appetizer menu, the Coconut Shrimp is a winner.  Four very generously sized butterfly shrimp are battered and fried to perfection atop a bed of shaved carrots, papayas, and cilantro.. give me a second while I wipe the drool off my keyboard please.

Mac and Cheese Squared is a personal AND House Favorite for good reason: cheesy noodles cooked in truffle oil with wild mushrooms, applewood bacon, and chicken breast.  Definitely a staple menu item.

The burgers are great, happy hour menu is awesome in forward and reverse, and did I mention that the selection of draught beer wraps around the bar? Thanks for being consistently awesome Yard House!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Yard House! The beer selection is excellent, good variety. Love the food selections because there are so many vegetarian options - the gardein wings are the best. And there's something about the playlist: soundgarden, weezer... Yes! Needless to say we'll be back to this and other locations.

Our server Matthew was great, he made sure we had everything we needed, was really attentive."}
{"text":"I believe I've been here three times in the past year. One time they brought be the wrong pizza, another time they forgot the chicken on my salad. Maybe I just had bad luck on busy nights, not the end of the world."}
{"text":"Every visit to Vegas which is five or six times a year I always choose to dine here.  The menu selection is beyond adequate.  The servers are always attentive and top notch.  The quality of the food as well as the flavor is always consistent and we never leave here disappointed in any way.  This is a great choice.  We wish there was a location in Albuquerque so we could dine here more often."}
{"text":"The most accommodating restaurant I've ever been to! The manager Dave was amazing. We came in with a party of 20 and ended up having 24 and they made everything work and gave all of us separate checks. It was such an enjoyable experience and the waitstaff were amazing! I would recommend this place to anyone and would definitely be back. Great food and great service!"}
{"text":"Food is awesome but now that I'm on a diet it's really hard to go there with my friends so I checked their menu nutritional information before going there. OMG it's crazy! Even their fish and rice plate has more than a thousand calories!!! I just skipped appetizers and had a small green salad with turkey burguer (they have whole whaet buns but I skipped that too)The turkey burguer was AMAZING, so yummy! It's a bit expensive if you want to drink there but everything else is great!"}
{"text":"There are a lot of things I love about Yard House, but sometimes it just feels too much like a chain. The servers are always running around like crazy and seem super rushed. It's too bad, because it takes away from the great food and beer. Plus, the patio is a great hang."}
{"text":"Have had good experiences dining in at the linq  and red rock location. Placed an order to go at this location because it's closer to me. When we got home and opened it it was a mess. The pizza wasn't even the right one that we ordered. The entrees were missing the sides. Like the mashed potatoes. And the food they did give us wasn't good. The truffle fries has a few sweet potato ones mixed in. Just makes me question the kitchen clenliness. We called and the manager and he was nice and comped the order. But it Ruined Our Sunday Night Fam Dinner."}
{"text":"The best place to pregame for the Cardinal game."}
{"text":"My husband and I recently hosted our son's rehearsal dinner at the YH at Red Rock Casino Resort.  Most of the wedding guests were staying at Red Rock, so we decided on YH to keep the dinner on property. We couldn't have chosen a better spot!! The manager, Vernice, and her staff of Summer, Brittany, Shelbie, and Stephen worked their tails off to make sure that all 50 of our guests had a wonderful night!  We decided on an appetizer buffet, and the staff replenished all evening as needed.  Drink orders were taken and served quickly with no lag in service.  At the end of the evening, the staff helped pack up food and decorations which was a great help to me.  (They also helped with the set up which saved me so much time!) This was undoubtedly the most important party my husband and I have ever thrown. Yard House made it so successful and memorable for not only us, but also for the bride and groom!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to go for beers. Taps on Taps on Taps. The food is as food as the beer selections. Don't F around, and go!"}
{"text":"As a regular there's no where else I would rather get together with good friends than Yard House. The happy hour menu is extensive and the music is always vibrant. Ask for TJ to get a good laugh in while you're clinking pints with your buddies!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible. The food was delicious (best mac and cheese ever). Our waiter, Christina, was AWESOME. She was super attentive and fun..her recommendations were on point and she helped us get in and out quickly in time for our show! All around amazing."}
{"text":"Came here with a large group a while back.  We were there to eat and have a beer before a concert there. It was a weekday so we made it to happy hour. Happy Hour pricing was fair. The food was pretty good. The very best thing there is the beer!  They had like everything on tap! MMMM!"}
{"text":"I love meeting friends here!  Nice environment, great outdoor seating, not impossible to get a table, a fun menu and great beer selection.

One of my fave parts of this restaurant/bar is the gardein options for all vegans or vegetarians.  Their jerk chicken gardein option is beyond delicious and flavorful.  I must find the recipe to share for Football Sunday with my veggie friends.  The same goes for their Buffalo Wings and Firecracker Wings.  SOOOO good!  I think they're WAY better than actual wings and the flavor is so on point that I will most likely only eat gardein wings moving forward!

I've tried several things on the menu that weren't just vegetarian friendly and haven't been let down since.  I'd name them all, but, who's got the time for all that?

If you're looking for a relaxed joint with a chilled atmosphere, huge selection of food and decent beer, check out Yard House.  It's become my favorite neighborhood bar.  Great service and the wine is always fresh tasting, as well.  (I hate when I get served a glass of red from a bottle that's been open for a few days..)

Great place!"}
{"text":"Our waitress Cheryl was very nice. She told me the chicken wraps were good so I got them and they were different but I liked them a lot. She was very personable and caring. This is probably the best yard house in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"OH MY! Someone has so new items on the menu!! Pig candy and Beef Jerky and a Siracha ginger Mary!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here with a few friends, had buffalo wings, clam chowder and a Caesar salad. The wings were very good, the clam chowder had lots of clam in it and the salad was good. The service was great too."}
{"text":"The food was good, but for the price I could of made it at home. They have a large beer selection which helped, the price of beer wasn't too bad either. Likely come back for drinks only. Not a fan of paying for overpriced food that I can make at home."}
{"text":"We always love this restaurant, food is great and service is always on point. Michelle was awesome and very attentive, 5 stars for her"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong, especially when I'm in the mood for craft beer. Service is not as good as the  bar or kitchen."}
{"text":"I love this place!!...
service is always amazing, the food is good for the price and the beers of course! it's a perfect spot to go for Happy Hours or with some friends for a relaxed \"pub\" atmosphere dining at reasonable prices (specially if you go during HH) the portions are generous and you have hundreds of beers to choose from.

Give it a try, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Advice to management, hire some more bartenders if you're going to offer 137 beers on tap. Service was horrible"}
{"text":"I ordered 2 lobster Lobster Garlic Noodles (Featured) to go, one order was great and the other is the picture below. I've order this dish several times and this is the first disappointment. It was bland, a little soggy, got one random pasta in the mix, and plastic. 
Please double check the food before sending it out."}
{"text":"I'm trying to like this place... But they make it very difficult.  I come here, with others, on a fairly regular basis.  On every occasion, the food is bland or borders on it, the service is slow, and something is typically wrong with my meal and/or drinks.  They carried the template for a bad experience once again tonight.  My recommendation is to try other places in Westgate as this place doesn't seem to care to improve.  #pitiful"}
{"text":"Got there  at 3:50 New Years Eve, told it would be an hour and waited till 5:45 to get seated. They put three parties before us cuz they were large parties. Shame on them. Only got seated cuz I complained. We come here a lot. Not impressed!"}
{"text":"We ate here before the Cardinals vs. Eagles Game on September 23, 2012. I had truffle fries and deviled eggs both items were scrumptious! We had a terrific server. I am not a drinker but they offer a huge selection of draft beers, I did enjoy two St. Pauli Girl NA beers. Get there early on game days, we arrived at 10:30AM and the place was getting busy! P.S. the Cardinals won."}
{"text":"The presentation and taste of the food is excellent, but the service you'll receive on a busy weekend night might not be worth your hard earned money. 

I was with a group of friends deciding where we would eat and have some drinks when one said, \"If the restaurant isn't busy, I don't want to go in there because it probably doesn't have good food.\" Sometimes, however, a place can be too busy to provide exceptional service. That was my experience at Yard House this past Saturday night.

We sat down at a booth and order drinks, appetizers, and entrees. Our drinks took about 20 minutes to arrive, they don't come in chilled glassware, and the tap isn't cold - so your drink is warm after three-four sips. 

Our appetizers arrived with our entrees. The bowls/plates are large and with five people in a booth, we didn't have table space for the food. We were eating on top of one another. Since we ordered appetizer soups and entrée sized salads instead of finger food - this wasn't cool! Armando blamed this on the kitchen, so my guess is they don't fire entrees separately from appetizers. Some restaurants fire appetizers and then check on the table's progress before firing the entrees. My recommendation on a busy day at Yard House would be to place your appetizer order, wait 15 minutes, and then order your entree.

We had a sixth person join us after our food arrived and her drink arrived just about the time we were all done eating. Overall, the experience was nothing special. I generally order appetizers for one reason, to offset the hunger and pace the food so you can enjoy the company your with and experience the meal.

Outside of the service complaints, the Chicken Tortilla Soup was very good. It has a creamy white cheddar flavor with slices of avocado and tortilla strips in addition to a nice portion of chicken. The bowl of soup is not a large generous portion, so it could easily be an appetizer. 

The entree portion of the Chopped Salad w/ salmon was fresh looking and generously portioned. It comes with the typical tomatoes, bacon, and avocados in addition to corn, cucumbers, celery, onion and cilantro.

For dessert, we decided to try the Mini Peach Apple Cobbler and the S'Mores Brownie. All three bits of crust topped cobbler were delicious. The S'Mores brownie required a topping of ice-cream, ordered afterward, because it is too dry to eat."}
{"text":"Food is great, spicy tuna roll is really good, not a sushi roll but seared ahi tuna with edamame and avocado and lots of other goodies in a neat presentation, looks like a cake of sushi!  Happy hour is fun but it ends way too early in my opinion. Kids meals are very large portions and a little expensive but a good value overall. My kids like the flavors you can add to the sodas.  I like this location better than the town square."}
{"text":"We visit the Yardhouse when we come to Vegas every year. We love the Happy Hour from 3-6. Great prices on food and drinks. The staff is amazing. Josh is fabulous!  When an employee remembers a patron from one day to the next despite how many people come and go, that goes a long way with me. Great customer service!  We are going to start visiting Vegas twice a year and will definitely visit the Yardhouse again and again!  One of our favorite places with a great atmosphere!  Thanks for the sweetener Josh!"}
{"text":"We were here for a large party.  We had 2 waitesses and at first it was good but we couldn't get past the water order.  

I ordered the kale Caesar salad with ahi tuna.  The dressing tasted like Dijon mustard and was missing the ahi tuna.  They brought me my tuna on a side plate.  Still didn't taste good. The tuna did not taste fresh.  

My BF ordered cobb salad. The waitress asked if we wanted fresh pepper... We both said no but then she started to put pepper on his food.  And she kept going until I yelled at her to stop."}
{"text":"Always love my Yardhouse experiences! This one had really good customer service and of course great food and beer!"}
{"text":"I don't know if people who don't know the difference between arugula and regular green lettuce/ice burg should be working at a restaurant. I ordered the vegan burger and asked for ice burg lettuce instead of arugula because I hate the taste of arugula and I got rudely told \"arugula is lettuce, but ok\".....really? Instead of just politely saying ok I got told that.Other than that service was fine the food was fine everyone else I was with seemed happy with their food and service."}
{"text":"Food and service was good, but ask for a certain game on the TV with no results. Wasn't happy.  On my way out manager said I could probably watch it at the sports book.LETS GO PENS"}
{"text":"Service was slow.  Food was okay for the price... it was not my favorite and I probably won't be back for a really long time."}
{"text":"Love their beer selection.  They redid the menu.  Yes, it was big BUT now the writing is too small :(  AND, the menu had a easy way to find beer from which country (important) and alcohol content % (important).  Now you have to go over EVERY BEER to see the small print of the same info.  Sorry but not a fan of the new menu.  I agree with dividing drinks/food and smaller menu but this is not a good solution.  plus the menu is way too light in color.  everything blends in.  we go here after coyotes game a LOT.    Also, Daniel is a wonderful waiter."}
{"text":"This is the oasis of good food in a slowly dying Westgate. Everything here is well portioned and delicious. Prices are high but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"We dined with friends and their children.  It's large, dark, and I can see how it would be loud--given the large screen TVs that are likely used during sports events. There were more families there while we were.  Our server was attentive.  Our friends' child did receive apple juice instead of orange juice (the waitress did repeat \"orange juice\" when it was ordered, so I know she took that order correctly), but the kiddo was a good sport about it and drank it because it was taking forever to flag the server down (we never did).  The menu itself has way too many choices that it's overwhelming when you first look at it.  I'd recommend not opening it if you are indecisive, because it will only give you a full blown panic attack. My husband was ecstatic with the beer selection and enjoyed his mac n' cheese because bacon.  He wasn't overly excited about the French Onion Soup--which is one of his favorite dishes and he frequently gets this at other restaurants, too.  I had asked the server about the street tacos.  I wasn't really interested in the entire meal, and asked if the \"ala carte\" designation meant the tacos (plural, quantity with the meal is 2 tacos) and just NOT the beans/rice, to which she agreed it was. Our conversation went like this when I asked for clarification after she recommended ala carte as a way to \"mix n match\" tacos since I wasn't sure which one I wanted: \"So ala carte is the taco portion without the rice and beans?\" \"Exactly!\" She didn't tell me it was really priced PER taco, and the menu isn't exactly clear.  I got the carnitas and fish tacos after asking for her recommendation and she listed all of them but two.  Unexpectedly, two tacos came (one of each), and were $8.40ish for BOTH.  Street tacos should never, EVER be this expensive.  And our server never returned so I could ask her for clarification  I just wrote it off and figured I'd Yelp about it, and hopefully warn others that the \"ala carte\" price of $4-$6 is PER taco.  Still ridiculous.  I will be fair and say they were OK tacos, but certainly not worth $4 each.  In all honesty, I can't review the other food."}
{"text":"You can't really go wrong with Yard house. Their food is amazing and their service is usually good. 

This particular visit I went during happy hour and it was buzzing with people. Good vibes and good food  = happiness.

My friends and I ordered and we received our orders within 5 minutes. The servers were extremely nice and were observant about our drinks and plates. 

I don't think I could've asked for a better experience."}
{"text":"Worst fish and chips ever. I would give this place a negative rating if possible. The manager argued that it was great fish and chips, I wouldn't even order this for kids if I were you. I have had better tv diner fish and chips."}
{"text":"Good food. Haven't tried any drinks here but over nice place! Decently priced as well!"}
{"text":"I've been to several Yard House locations (Temecula, San Diego) and the chain is awesome if you love draft beer selections with a wide range of food options. Girlfriend and I stopped in at the Vegas location on my trip out for my 50th bday. The \"village\" location can't be beat, with several other venues, live music and casino entrances off the courtyard area.

Prices were same as non Vegas locations and service was fast. Definitely a go-to for a delicious meal without Vegas price pumping."}
{"text":"The service was great, and the drinks were delicious.  I wasn't a fan of the food.  Maybe I ordered the wrong thing or something, but I've had better.  For the price I paid I don't think it was worth it.  I see it like I paid for the service, which was amazing.  Thank you Derrick :D"}
{"text":"Food was great service was bad waiters where rude and did not bring us our drinks till after we had received are food also waiters had a real bad attitude"}
{"text":"I would like to start this review by saying I am a server myself and I typically love going to Yard house. But this evenings experience was quite terrible.

We were greeted by our waitress, Suzy. She was seemingly upset to be working and was not happy or enthused when arriving to the table. She took roughly 15-20 minutes to get everyone's drinks to the table, our party being of 6 people. All 6 drinks drinks were dropped off at separate times by separate servers. Though a bothersome, we tried to be understanding. We ordered the Lobster spinach and artichoke dip (absolute must, completely incredible). We had to wait quite a bit of time to order, but once we did, our party ordered two salads to come out before the meals. Our salads arrived roughly 20 minutes after our dinners and were entirely wrong with toppings and dressings. It took Suzy and an additional server Bianca until the end of our meal to get us the correct salad. The orange chicken, Mac and cheese meal, and chicken and noodle bowl were all delicious and hot despite taking so long to arrive. Unfortunately when asking very politely to fix the issue, Suzy argued that we got exactly what we ordered and that we were in the wrong. I got one refill the entire two hours we were there, and didn't see her refill any water or sodas. Any other bar drinks sat in the well at the bar for 10-20 minutes before they were brought to the table. 

As the meal was ending and we were looking for dessert, the girls dropped of our checks with out us even asking for them, not offering dessert. On our check we paid for the salads and meals that were wrong and late.

Being a server at a top 100 restaurant in the nation on Yelp, I always serve to the best of my abilities with a smile and take care of any meals that went wrong. On top of that we almost always order a dessert on the house for any inconvenience. Suzy was unwilling to help, service was horribly slow, and we were treated as an inconvenience. 

YardHouse: Food is incredible! Drinks are so tasty and potent! Service absolutely sucked."}
{"text":"Some have said that if you've been to one Yard House that you've been to them all.. and I would agree, however, the beer selections vary. So does the atmosphere (to me), and (as I recently discovered) the food does as well. 

Nursing my hangover we decided to head to this Yard House as it was a little closer to our house. I was craving a good turkey burger and a salad. We had previously visited the Linq Yard House location and figured this one shouldn't be too different, right? Wrong.

The turkey burger had many more extras added into the meat (veggies and such) than I had at the other location. Maybe it was a fluke, maybe not. My turkey burger was also missing arugula. The menu did look the same as the Linq location... however the service was a little off... but not enough to keep me from coming back to enjoy some tasty beers on that lovely patio! 

That patio tho! Booths and bar table (comfortable) seating, plenty of tvs and lots of fans. View of the parking lot but beyond that, the mountains. If anything, go for the nice atmosphere outside and the crazy selection of beer!"}
{"text":"I have only dined at the Yard House in Waikiki... when I was first exposed to their massive beer selection. I had a great time there so when I saw that there are Yard House locations here (Linq and Red Rock, maybe somewhere else as well?) the beer enthusiast within got excited!

Their beer list is ridiculously extensive and organized pretty much every way you can organize them. Our server seemed pretty knowledgeable about the beers and was really helpful when I was searching for a particular beer. They didn't have the beer but she was willing to bring me a sample of another beer and search for a comparable beer. Keep that in mind when visiting Yard House, don't be afraid to ask for a sample. 

Their food list is also extensive and if I could describe it - I would say it is a fusion of many foods. I ended up going with a burger because we were headed to a show... but the burger was GOOD and huge and a very good price! For the strip, I'd say this is probably some of the lowest pricing for the types of food offered. It's no fancy place but they have plenty of TVs, seating, windows with views of the Linq Promenade and High Roller, and friendly servers (service) to go and enjoy yourself and fill your belly."}
{"text":"Beer selection VERY GOOD. Too bad many of the brews you can NOT order by the half yard and get in a fun half yard glass.  

Food is terrible. Nothing we ordered was good. Cheap quality and prepared poorly and a lot either burnt or dirty grease. The \"cold\" food items tasted poor, wilted and cheap quality for high price. 

Service was slow. We went midweek and mid-day. Very few people in there. Sad to see an old man in a wheeled chair using a bar stool for a table. A bar seat, yes where people put their butts, he was using in a restaurant for a table. I don't know if his wheeled chair wouldn't fit at a table or what but that is un-called for. Sad really. 

3 stars just for the huge selection of beer. Nothing else."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, and wonderful air conditioning.  We were told that this was a good place, and it did not disappoint.  Comfort food for grown ups."}
{"text":"They have such great food selection. Reasonable portions... and what can I say endless options of alcohol. 

My favorites are the poke nachos, ahi tuna sashimi, and the lobster garlic noodles which is to die for. 

It could get crowded n noisy at times. But it's great for watching the games."}
{"text":"We went in the afternoon with a group of 7. Ordered appetizers and drinks and the total was about $8/each. Food was great, enjoyed being near the high roller, sports bar atmosphere, and friendly service."}
{"text":"I got the miso sea bass. this dish was alright. The bass was cooked well but the rice was not cooked well enough. The rice had a crunch to it. Being someone who loves rice this bothers me. I really enjoy soft rice with my dishes. It does add a texture and it does prevent the dish from getting soggy but there needs to be a happy medium. The bok choy was cooked well and is roasted. these were so delicious. I have to admit the miso sauce on the rice was pretty salty. It complimented the lightness of bass.

I also had a taste of the pan seared ahi tuna. this was an interesting one. The ahi was cooked to perfection but the bean sauce was exxxxxtremely salty. Unfortunately the individual I was with came to the same conclusion. I have to say that the fish was cooked to perfection and was fresh.

Environment was extremely loud and packed. Personally not my cup of tea. For the food it was worth it though."}
{"text":"Not writing based on my first experience at this location. 
Came here this past weekend to celebrate my parents' 27th anniversary with the siblings. 
Julianne (sp). was our server. She was nice and attentive. We were too engrossed with our celebration, so it's not like we got to be personable with her, but her helpers were just as cool when they'd bring the food out to us. They all checked on us several times during the meal, and I was pretty impressed with her dark beer recommendation. She even remembered what adult beverages my dad, sister and I ordered when we asked for a second round. 
As for the food, their menu has a huge variety, and I haven't found anything I didn't like off of it. 
Favorites are the Bernaise Sliders/Burger, Ahi Crunchy Salad, and the Grilled Korean Pork Belly Street Tacos. 
Always fun to come here with a big group. Hahaha... So you can handle the loud atmosphere with other big groups."}
{"text":"We shared a Caeser salad and a Cuban pork sandwich. Very good food. The noise level  almost approachs thunderous because the place is so busy. We were there on a Sunday late afternoon. Good service."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this Yard House 3 times now because of the location.  I really love their Surf and Turf burger!  It does get very busy and I'm not a fan of restaurants who crank the music up so loud, you have trouble hearing the person across the table from you.  That said, service is always top notch and they have been accomodating because I need a slight modification to the meal.  However, last night my burger arrived with the cheese I specifically requested be left off (can't do dairy).  I flagged our waitress, Lindsay, down and she was very apologetic and said she would have it redone.  She stopped by to let me know it was in the works.  The general manager, James, also stopped by to apologize and ensure me that it was being taken care of.  Although I was disappointed about another wait, I was very happy with how they were responding.  The burger finally arrived, it was perfect!  Lindsay stopped by to make sure I was happy and then James came by to make sure it was done right and then told me since I had to wait so long, he would comp my meal!  I would have been happy to pay for it just based on their great service.  I felt that this was above and beyond what they needed to do but was very appreciative.  Thank you, James and Lindsay, for making my day!"}
{"text":"I've never seen a place with so many varieties of beer.  I mean, seriously ... Raspberry.  And it's good.  The food is incredible.  The turkey pot pie tastes like an entire thanksgiving dinner in one bowl.  I had the lemon chiffon cake with raspberries.  WOW!! Delicious!!"}
{"text":"When I come here I'm happy that they have options with raw fish. I'm a huge sushi fan so I'm always craving it -__- because it is one of the healthiest dining options out there. 

I gave the yard house 3 stars rating the food items.

Everytime I've come here the food is OK. It looks appealing but I feel that it really lacks flavor or any excitement. I had the spicy tuna roll which is a nontraditional roll. It has avocados and edamame with spicy tuna in between. It sure looks and sounds good but the flavor was MEH. I also tried the ahi sliders and they just weren't good. 

See for yourself. 

3 stars because the beer selection is obviously fun but other than that I'd honestly go some place else for my carb in a cup fill to at least get some decent food to complement it."}
{"text":"Best value is Happy Hour. Not your regular, boring, typical bar food. Good selections to make everyone happy. Lots of tvs but don't ever expect the sound to be on, even if the home team is playing. Music is \"oldies rock\". Good selection but very loud."}
{"text":"There was a 25-30 minute wait on Friday night. That wasn't too bad but it took over an hour to get our appetizer...that's ridiculous. Our waiter kept telling us the appetizer would be out any minute and he even said \"we aren't that busy!\" 

Anyway, we had chicken fingers for an appetizer and I had the BBQ bacon cheeseburger with truffle fries. Their fries are absolutely delicious! The BBQ sauce on the burger is very sweet. I think the waiter said it is maple BBQ sauce. 

The food was pretty good but the restaurant is kinda loud. Overall it's a good choice for Town Square but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there."}
{"text":"Descriptive phrase: hip, cool sports pub with poor service.

Yard House is a chain, and this one in the Linq is just as cool and clean as any other. When a big group of us came to watch the Final Four basketball games it was obvious we were gonna be there for a while and drop a chunk of change. We did, considering each half yard of beer is at least $14 and my own Chicken Nachos was $11.45 (good, by the way).

But the overwhelming impression I left with was how horrendous the service was. It wasn't even that busy at first, and it took 20 minutes in between visits from our server. And each time she came she'd only take 1 or 2 people's orders (of the 10ish of us), then leave again. 

The place has many TVs with games on, yet they refuse to turn the game sounds on, even though that night especially most of their patrons were there to watch the Final Four. Annoying.

When the bill finally came they would not split it. I understand some places refuse to do that, which I think is stupid, but whatever. However, when we went through the bill there were a ton of things that we didn't order. We brought that to their attention, and they changed it...to more wrong things. It took us legitimately 30 minutes to figure out what they did wrong and explain it them before they could change it correctly. They said they'd comp us a beer for the trouble, but those never came. 

The only reason this isn't a 1 star is because the food, beer, and atmosphere is still good. And the crowd, even the opposing fans, were all friendly and jovial. But I wouldn't come back solely because of the service."}
{"text":"Okay, there are a few things that are going to be brought up and I'm almost guaranteed to get a manager comment on this, but whatever, it's happening.

Went here last night to try the Gardein line here. I was very excited to see that vegan meats have been added to some of their dishes. How cool is that?? But upon doing some internet research before we ordered, I found out that due to cooking methods, ALL of the dishes wouldn't be vegan OR vegetarian. They cook everything on the same grill as the meat. What sense does this make? None. It's like having a black coat and putting bleach all over it - it doesn't resemble a black coat anymore and is tainted. If you mix vegan food with meat, what is the point? 

And here comes why it is 2-star. IT IS NOT STANDARD PROCEDURE FOR THE VEG*N MENU TO BE COOKED IN A SEPARATE PAN. You have to go out of your way to ask for this, and even then a manager comes out to explain that it's not going to taste the same as if it were on the grill. Hmm - do you really think a vegan WANTS dead cow mixed in with her food? HELL NO. Granted, Yardhouse has already taken *some* action and put a little dot next to a few items that absolutely will come in contact with meat since these items are fried and have to go in the same basket as everything else. But they haven't specified that ALL the menu items will come in contact with animal products which is not okay. It would be really helpful if people who come here know this right off the bat. If I hadn't had my phone on me that night, I literally would have gotten sick since I haven't had any sort of meat in 6 years. 

Here's what I would suggest: just like other companies before you (Chipotle comes to mind), please automatically make all the vegetarian/Gardein items cooked separately from the meat. You don't want a lawsuit a la McDonald's. It is ridiculous that these vegan meats come to you and then you cross-contaminate them with animal sources to make them not even vegetarian. Oh and this isn't just for this Yardhouse, it goes for all of them - trust me, I will be contacting your corporate offices today. Also, it would be nice if you could put a little V next to the items that could be made vegan or are vegan on the menu. Makes ordering easier, and the confusion of your staff minimal.

Anyways, I ordered the veggie sliders that come with fries, and we also ordered a side of sweet potato fries. Matt ordered a thai \"chicken\" pizza. After some back and forth, the sliders couldn't even go on the bread (only the wheat bread is vegan) so I got them protein style, wrapped in lettuce. The sweet potato fries we got as our appetizer were severely lackluster. Very bland, no taste, no toppings like sugar or anything. We couldn't have the sauce since it contained bacon, so I guess that's where all the flavor is. After the aforementioned back and forth with the wait staff, we got our food. Do they seriously only have the meat and the bun (in my case, lettuce) for the sliders? NOTHING else? No tomato or onion or even ketchup and mustard? For serious? The taste of the Gardein patty was wonderful, but for almost $11 for plain patties is ridiculous. The fries were way better than the sweet potato ones, but it just wasn't worth the price. I wish they would have suggested to make my order a veggie burger since that's essentially what they did anyways, was cut the patty into four pieces and pass them off as sliders. At least then I could have had the wheat bun and toppings. 

It was very difficult throughout the night to try and signal our waitress. I know it was very busy and that I did ask a lot of questions and such, but she was an expert ninja. Not the best customer service in the world. I also unfortunately don't see this Gardein line lasting here at Yardhouse. Until cooking the items separately becomes standard procedure, I can see a lot of vexed veg*ns. Honestly, what is the point of having vegan meats if they're going to end up on the same grill as actual meats? I just don't get that logic. Yardhouse itself is a bit pricey and I understand this, but at least give the customer the most you can. Plain sliders are not okay. In fact, I don't think I've been anywhere that has completely bare sliders. 

Due to the lackluster food, the outrageous price tag and the lack of good customer service, Yardhouse really deserves a 1-star review but I still love that a chain has decided to put vegan faux meats on their menu. The intent is there, but the execution is awful but can be easily improved upon. I might be back since there were other items that looked appetizing, but only when I want to deal with the headaches and the hassle. Until then, I'll stock up on Gardein at Whole Foods and make my own delights at home."}
{"text":"Great place for beer (very large selection), but not so much for food.  I had the Nashville chicken expecting it to be spicy and crispy.  It was neither, more greasy than crispy.  And it was very bland.  The sweet potato pancakes on the side were awesome though.  We also had the spinach dip.  It was OK, but again pretty bland and the chips were kind of burnt.  Our waiter was excellent, very attentive.  I'd only come back here for the beer."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I really like their happy hour menu - they have several vegetarian options, which is a nice change. We normally get the lettuce wraps, gardein wings (get the asian sauce, not the buffalo sauce) and then a few other random things.

They have an amazing taps selection, and you can get really small portions so that you can try a bunch of different types.

It's got a slight upscale pub feel to it. I really like this place, I just wish there were a location closer to downtown Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I hate to give a chain restaurant 4 stars and maybe it as the sleep deprivation I had after driving from Cali to Vegas, but dammit I enjoyed this meal! Super nice waitress and cool sophisticated interior, it was good. Solid meal ambience and wait time to be seated. Casual dress is appropriate, nothing fancy required and a Hell of a beer menu. A nice respite from June beat in Vegas!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are visiting and we decided to try this place. My husband had the chicken street tacos and I had the Margherita pizza. The pizza was way too salty. I mean it was so salty that it over powered it. Also it had a ton of garlic pieces. I mean so many....I didn't think it was necessary to have that much garlic or salt. My husband said the tacos were good. Also it is very pricey for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"This review is for Kelsee our servers breaker. She was the best server ever! Se knew so much about the food and drinks and kept us laughing the whole time. We loved her and she made our experience amazing. The food was pretty tasty too, the surf and turf burger was pretty good and the ahi bowl is yummy as well! Great time!"}
{"text":"We've been going to Yard House for a long time. We went there for Father's day and it took 35 minutes to get our food, which was cold, and the server didn't seem to care as he cleaned the tables around us.

I work in the service industry and understand it can get busy, but our food had been sitting in the window long enough to change color.

It will be the last time we eat at any Yard House as we've had the same service issues at the Red Rock location."}
{"text":"Food was really good, got chicken nachos for the first time...wow this is certainly a dish for sharing with a few people...huge portion! Great night on the patio and Rob was a great server, funny and very personable, thanks for a fun night Rob!"}
{"text":"The service of this location is getting worse.  Came here on a not so busy Sunday night, our server was Sean S., he wasn't really attentive after delivering our food.  I ordered the clam chowder which came hot.  And I also order a medium cooked Black Truffle Cheeseburger with regular fries.  The fries tasted cold and soggy.  The burger was medium warm and some of my meat was burned which it was the medium cooked as I asked for.  We were thirsty so we were waiting for refills, he preferred to flirt with ladies instead of serving other people.  I think next time I will go to the Scottsdale Fashion Square location instead."}
{"text":"One of the better places to eat and drink in Red Rock.  Quieter with good beers and spirits.  The Korean street tacos are good, as are the onion rings we had."}
{"text":"I am providing an update as I am very impressed by the manager Chris. They read my review and provided a gift card to try them out again. I can say, first experience aside the food was excellent however, the level of customer service, promptness, attentiveness not so much. Cocktail prices are high and location is extremely busy on weekends. For being such a large establishment we were informed they only had one side that was cool and being we live in the dessert where summer temperatures can easily soar beyond 100 degrees. You can tell where I am going with this, we got the not so cool side. Hot actually, couldn't wait to get out of there. I greatly appreciate the managers attempt to reconcile the situation but, I don't believe this place would be my first choice in dining options. I do have to give management an A for effort."}
{"text":"Great selection of beers and good pub grub.  Only wish I lived closer."}
{"text":"So we went here for my birthday yesterday, Yardhouse has to be one of my favorite restaurants...the host walked us to our table, didn't ask us how our day was going...our server's name is Jason...he hands us the menu, checks our IDs...gave me back mine and didn't say happy birthday...I get it it's not Disneyland...anyways we order our food and drinks amazing as always...so my Boyfriend went to ask Jason if we can get a cake for my birthday so he came back we we're waiting for the check and packing up our food to go...it's been about 10-15 minutes since he ordered the cake. So my boyfriend waives Jason over as he is walking and was just asking about the cake. And Jason just shrugs his shoulder and said \"i don't make the cakes here, they are preparing it.\" Jason comes back with the cake, lights the candle, drops off the cake and then walks away. Maybe he was having a bad day..I just thought it was really awkward and rude to say he doesn't make the cakes..I mean obviously he wouldn't be a server if he was making the cake. He could have been nicer about the situation, like a thumbs up, or \"it will be here shortly. \""}
{"text":"I would live here if I could. I loved everything about it Pierre B. was amazing. I had the garlic lobster pasta which was fantastic, and my boyfriend had the chicken bowl and he liked it  too. The best part was sooooo many beer options."}
{"text":"I met my family here after arriving at Red Rock. We all met up for drinks and some small bites. No one was really at the front when we entered, but we found our relatives pretty quick because they were all seated at a booth near the front. The service was kinda weird here. I ordered passion fruit iced tea and my relatives all got drinks from the bar. They all got their drinks first and I had to wait a while for my tea. We also ordered an Ahi tuna stack and we got that before I got my iced tea. It was kinda annoying because I was super thirsty. A couple minutes after we got our appetizer my iced tea finally came. It kinda tasted off though, like a diet iced tea, bleh. I ended up just drinking water for the rest of the time we were there. 

The Ahi stack was ok. The tuna was good, the wontons tasted like they were fried in old oil though and there was just a huge amount of daikon and carrots that were pretty bland. The sauce on the plate was a really gross brownish green color that wasn't very pretty. It was a wasabi soy sauce, it tasted good though, not too overpowering. 

I haven't been to a Yard House in a while and they've really redone their menu. There's a lot of interesting stuff on their menu that I actually wanted to try. I didn't get to this time around though because we planned to go to dinner somewhere else. I might actually try out Yard House again to check out their new menu."}
{"text":"Great meal...Had some cold fries and the manager himself  came over to talk to us and gave us a desert. Great customer service, which is rare these days. Waitress was wonderful  as well."}
{"text":"I love Yard House, but we have resorted to going during happy hour specials because otherwise we end up spending way too much. My husband and I have recently started just sharing their chicken nachos and order a side of their queso with it. So, so delicious and filling. In the past I have ordered their Penne with Chicken, which was good. My husband tried their fish and chips, said it was OK, but kind of oily. They have vegan/vegetarian options which is good for when friends come to visit. They said what they ordered was delicious. Plenty of parking, friendly staff, haven't had any long wait times. Always enjoy our visits here."}
{"text":"The happy hour starting at 3:00 is a plus, as is the atmosphere at Town Square with outdoor people watching seating for the fabulous fall and spring weather.  Happy hour deals are not great compared to many places, and not even a deal compared to some normal prices. You pay for the location and trendiness at all Yard House's, and they are a deal compared to casinos or others such as Tommy Bahama's at Town Square.  I have found all Yard Houses to have poor service, so suggest corporate implement a revamped training and process evaluation.  Seems to be enough workers, so that is not the problem that I usually see. The beers seem warm, and are in warm or room temp which makes it go down more slowly, and when it is gone, if you are not at the bar, it will sit empty for a long time.  The food is only okay for the price.  There are better places including in Town Square.  Oh and lastly all Yard Houses have acoustics that make it very loud, so hard to carry on conversation with a group."}
{"text":"a group of six of us went to check out yard house for dinner.... each meal was delicious! the pastrami sandwich with jalapeni sauce is great, as  is the cobb salad, the steak salad, the kale
salad , the calamari! we shared all our appetizers, each one had tons of flavor, i have eaten sashimi everywhere in Las Vegas.. this is the best sashimi, so yummy, i ordered two, their chefs are truely chefs who know how to combine flavors with many different ingredients. 
i also ordered the sea bass, cooked to perfection, flaky, moist with lots of flavor, they place it on yummy vegies with rice, the ribs were tender with great sauce, now the martinis: lots of flavor and alcohol, im not a drinker but the apple martini was tart , sweet and gave me a buzz, one was enough, my other friends had other martinis and"}
{"text":"I was staying at the Red Rock & came here because...well, \"worlds largest draught beer list\" was why.  I live in Brooklyn, & so I was fairly nonplussed at the selection...but then, maybe I'm spoiled.  I have access to a wide beer selection in my day to day life.  The food was alright, though a little heavy on sauces & dips.  A bit pricy, so consider yourself forewarned."}
{"text":"Ordered the Fish and Chips and the Pastrami Benedict Burger.  The burger was phenomenal - so many different flavor a came together for a great burger.  The atmosphere was fun."}
{"text":"I've eaten here before. It's a popular spot whenever my group of friends get together once in awhile. I don't go here as often as I used to, but this isn't why I'm writing a review on this particular location... 
Thank you to the Host Staff for participating in my boyfriend's engagement scavenger hunt! Kudos for playing along, and not making me feel stupid when I asked you if you had a scavenger hunt clue. You guys are always welcoming, nice and accommodating! 
We honestly had our first date here, which is why he incorporated it. I can honestly tell you that I remembered what we had that night, and how much I appreciated the customer service then (and on other visits with friends). I had the Ahi Crunchy entree salad (fave menu item), and he had the Chicken Nachos and Captain & Cokes. 
I'll be sure to write an update the next time we visit, which could be in the near future."}
{"text":"Showed up for dinner around 6:45. Table wait time was only about ten minutes. It was a table for 2. Once seated we were almost immediately welcomed by our waiter Tyler. (Which was petty darn quick for how busy it was). And just like that our drinks and appetizers were in. And soon followed our order for dinner. From the fried calamari to the Fish and fries and the club sandwich everything tasted great! Dessert was also delicious. Beer was cold and the atmosphere was good. Everything turned out great and Tyler made sure that we were taken care of.  If you are in the Desert Ridge area and are looking for a bite to eat or even just a beer or two, I highly recommend this Yard House."}
{"text":"Food was ok, Great place for hang  out or for watching sports great selection beers"}
{"text":"All though this location may be closer to home I still prefer the Town Square location. I have only been here once and the service was sub-par. Come to think of it they messed up my order even when I sent it back once."}
{"text":"One of the best Happy Hours on \"The Boulevard\" better yet in the Vegas valley.  Happy Hour runs from Mon-Fri 3pm to 6pm and Sun-Wed 10pm to close. Half price select apps. and certain beers and martinis are also at a discount. Beware, that during happy hour, the place is packed wall to wall wall with people. So, if you want to make in time for happy hour, I suggest coming right at three or not to long after three. They also have really good pizza. My favorite is the four cheese. I've also tried the BBQ chicken pizza, but the BBQ does not go to well with the pizza. The mac and cheese is off the hook. Just also know, cell phone service is unlikely."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this restaurant and the Food was very good and tasty. I will be going back again."}
{"text":"Grab your hubby or your wife and head on out to Westgate !!! Great food , great service and listen to live music!!! The Az evenings are beautiful get out and enjoy !"}
{"text":"Normally, the food is good but today I am not sure what happened...our steaks looked microwaved and everything was cold; along with so so service and they were not even busy. Hopefully, they  get it right next time."}
{"text":"I'm not that huge a fan of chain restaurant. However Yard House is one of those places I can never seem to say no to. I'm glad to come here whenever I get a chance to be in Town Square and my most recent experience is a testament to Yard House's ever-growing quality of service and their endeavor to update their menu. I was about disappointed in the options I was left with as I don't consume much meat but pleasantly surprised they offer gardein food! Not too many places would take the effort in including this in their menu and I strongly applaud Yard House for doing so. That said their food is always amazing and the dining options in door and out door at the Yard House in Town Square is great! The atmosphere is always friendly and I never feel uncomfortable around their wait staff."}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday night and the wait was to be 45 minutes, but it was over an hour before we were seated.  The food was fine, no complaints or problems, and the service was acceptable - but the noise & crowds were beyond bad.  There were four of us and it was only possible to talk to a person on either side of you because you could lean over and yell to them - couldn't yell loud enough to the 4th person across the table.

So, unless you're dining with someone who you don't want to actually talk to, I wouldn't recommend this place on a Saturday night ;)"}
{"text":"The Yard House in Irvine is just like the Yard House everywhere. Clean, loud and full of ice cold beer on tap. 

I will get the obvious out of the way first, this is a chain in most suburban western region markets and thanks to the hard floors and being inside of a casino it is very, very loud at night, especially on the weekends. It is also worth mentioning these guys bust Classic Rock all day, everyday. 

The menu features standard American fare that offers little in surprise but what they do offer is better than it has any right to be, particularly their burgers. My personal favorite is the Pepperjack Burger that features roasted green chiles, pepper jack cheese and garlic aïoli on a grilled bun. The Black Truffle Cheese Burger (boasting house made truffle cheese, no less) and Béarnaise Burgers are also admirable, especially a few beers into the night. All burgers are accompanied with a decent helping of Fries and Yard House seems to get the cooked temperature right every time. Another stand out item is their French Onion Soup boasting a perfectly melted cheese and robust onion broth. 

These guys also have an exemplar Happy Hour Menu offering an Ahi Poke Bowl, Ceviche and Truffle Fries that I can vouch for at very reasonable prices. The service has always been up to snuff both at a table or bellied up to their gigantic bar. 

Which brings us to their best asset; the nearly 200 beers constantly on tap. If you are an adventurous beer drinker, it is pretty damn tough to beat this selection. Every imaginable craft brewery from Coast to Coast and across the ponds seem to be offered. Naturally, this makes the Yard House a great place to catch a sporting event.

If nothing else the beer selection alone will guarantee my return next time I am in Sin City."}
{"text":"Love the gardien vegan options, they keep me coming back. I love the Buffalo gardien. They chop salad minus the bacon for me is amazing and I get it with the spicy Thai peanut dressing."}
{"text":"My partner and I go here almost every night, so I can tell you a lot about the place.

Don't bother with the \"food\" food, if you can. It's not that it's bad food, but it's almost never worth what they're asking for it. What makes this place awesome is Happy Hour, with lowered drink costs and half priced appetizers. Sunday - Thursday has a second Happy Hour from 10pm - Midnight (kitchen closes at 11:30).

Appetizers I've had:

California Roll. (4 stars) Amazing. It in no way resembles real sushi (but do California rolls ever count as \"real\" sushi?). The dish is served as a rice \"cake\" topped with crab and tabiko, cucumber and avocado. The plate is drizzled with a wasabi soy sauce and dollops of Sri Racha chili sauce.

Spicy Tuna Roll (5 stars) My favorite. And at happy hour prices the most sushi bang for your buck. Same \"cake\" style as the California roll, but without rice. Just spicy tuna, edamame, cucumber. I'm a sucker for spicy raw tuna, and there's TONS of it in this dish. I've never been able to finish a whole one. Oh snap, Atkins friendly appetizer?

Calamari. (4 stars) A pretty big portion with two types of dipping sauce. The calamari tasted fresh and tender - not rubbery, and the batter was light enough to not overwhelm the taste of the squid.

Chinese Garlic Noodles. (3 stars) It's good enough, but it's just garlicky noodles covered in parmesan with big hunks of mushrooms. A good starchy filler if you're really hungry/plan on drinking heavily.

Blue Crab Cakes (3 stars) These are actually delicious, but what keeps them from being 4 star is that you only get two and they're falafel sized (so be sure to get them when they're $6 during happy hour). The mango chutney was a nice touch.

Spinach Cheese (3 stars) The dip is alright, certainly heavy on the spinach (a plus) but it's served with deep fried pita. Seriously, why can't they serve it with baked pita or something that hasn't been dredged in oil? Seemed ill thought out to me.

Margheretia Pizza (4 stars) This little pizza (8 slices, thin crust) is incredibly light and tasty, with whole cloves of roasted garlic - YUM.

Four Cheese Pizza (3 stars) Fontana, Parmesan, Ricotta and Mozzarella. Not overpowering, good balance of flavor, but the giant lumps of ricotta keep it from being a 4 star for me.

Onion Ring Tower (3 stars) It's got a cute little serving plate (the onions are stacked around a central \"pole\") but it's just your basic onion ring - a little on the oily side, which might be excellent if you're pairing it with one of Yardhouse's many, many (MANY), draft beers.

Sliders (4 star) Comes in \"Classic\" or \"Barnaise.\" I think I prefer the classic, because I find bearnaise off-putting, but it does come on the side and that style of slider has fried onion strings (but no cheese). Both styles come with shoe string fries and a pickle. $5.95 for either at happy hour, but I'd almost pay full price for these.

If you ARE in the mood for \"food\" food, then please, at all costs avoid the Mac and Cheese. It's advertised as a \"grown up\" version, but in this case \"grown up\" means oil. Oily cheeses, oily bacon, and...truffle oil? The one time I tried it I needed to pile noodles up on the sides of the plate in an attempt to let the puddle of oil drip off. This wasn't a little puddle either, it was practically a lake in the middle of the bowl. I abandoned it about a third of the way through.

The Creme Brule is good, but not worth the $8.25."}
{"text":"Visited on a Thursday night, dined on roof top where we could see the Linq, they gave us a great table without even being asked. Shrimp pasta and my husbands hamburger were excellent but the beer selection was the best part! Great chill atmosphere and Also notable were the reasonable prices and fab server who was personable and very knowledgable about menu too. Thrilled to find out this was a chain and there is one near me to visit at home."}
{"text":"My wife and I found this place while searching for a good lunch option. We absolutely enjoyed everything we tasted. The cool thing about this place is you can get a lot of options at a lot of price ranges. I had the shiitake garlic noodles, which were incredibly flavorful. My wife had the barbecue chicken pizza and French onion soup. The crust had a little essence of that beer flavor, which tasted great with the barbecue pizza sauce. They also had mini deserts that were just the right size after the meal. Service was very friendly and attentive. The location is nice as it has a good view of the high roller wheel from the second floor. They had lots of beer choices as you would expect, but we didn't get a chance to try them. We will have to come back again!"}
{"text":"I always know that I am going to get great service, great food and great beer (you can't beat their selection) at  this Yard House. The mushroom lettuce wraps are amazing!  If you go on a Friday or Saturday night, expect a wait. But it's a fairly large restaurant so the wait is never too bad. The bar fills up VERY quickly. Very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. A nice wide selection of beer. I stayed at the Westin and this is a go to spot for locals, as recommended by the concierge."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here for the first time. Had a great time. Our server Tyler was phenomenal and made sure we had an amazing visit. We ordered a burger, the Cuban sandwich, the lobster /seafood noodles, and shrimp ceviche and tacos. Everything was great. I'd come back if I lived here"}
{"text":"I recommend vodka angel hair pasta small size and the poké tuna nachos. For desert cream brûlée with extra bananas yumm"}
{"text":"I avoided the Yardhouse for a long time, thinking it was a little too Snobbsdale for me. But I eventually caved. And I'm glad I did -- this is a nice place to come for happy hour or for a late-night drink. I don't think I would eat dinner here, though, as it seems pretty pricey and the menu doesn't look that imaginative.

The atmosphere is nice. If you like beer, they've got plenty of it. They also have wine and cocktails. I wasn't a fan of the pomegranate martini I had, so I typically stick to wine. The appetizers, including the spinach cheese dip and the edamame, are pretty good.

All the waitresses I've ever had here are very friendly. The bartenders are a mixed bag. While I've found them to be nice, some of them are a little odd... like they say odd things or mutter under their breath or move your menu around on the bar while you're trying to read it, and then laugh. 
I almost feel like they're ready to throw a spitball at me or something, like a passive-aggressive high school bully that walks down the hall with you, then slams you into a locker and laughs.
Maybe I'm just paranoid, though."}
{"text":"I usually come here with my family and it's a first pick restaurant, the service is always amazing and I am very pleased with the food."}
{"text":"I've been to Town Square many of times but never stepped foot inside of Yard House til now. The resturaunt was huge and the staff was very friendly and welcoming. Smiles and good times was all over the building, not only from the staff but also the customers.

The food was amazing and if you're a beer lover such as myself they have over 100 brews to choose from. The selection included everything from lagers to ale's and even mixed beer drinks if you want to mix raspberry Lindermans Framboise w/ a chocolate flavored beer. And worse case scenario, let's say that you can't make up your mind on a beer selection; they also have samples of every brew to find the perfect one for your taste buds... I prefer Peroni.

The dinner was delicious. My girlfriend ordered a spicy chicken flatbread sandwich with parmesan & herb fries. I had to take a bite lol, and that was bomb.com! Chicken was grilled to perfection with avacado, cabbage, and spicy mustard. I ordered the BBQ cheddar burger! Heaven on earth. 1/2 lb sirloin cooked to order, melted cheddar cheese, smoked applewood bacon on a sweet Hawaiian bun and sweet potato fries on the side. Best burger I've ever had hands down.

The only downer I seen about the place is that its extremely loud inside of Yard House. I'm not knocking anyone's fun but it was hard to carry a convo with my girlfriend without shouting at eachother and we're sitting next to eachother in a booth. But there's also outside dining so that probably could've been more peAceful to enjoy a nice elegant dinner. Definitely is the spot if you're having a nice date and get hungry :-)"}
{"text":"It's like they are trying to be vegetarian friendly but sort of failing at it. They have a section of \"gardein\" brand meals which is pretty good but then you find out most of that plant based imitation meat is cooked in meat oil. Which makes it absolutely pointless to even put a \"V\" for vegetarian because it's not. It's still in contact with meat. But their gardein pizza option was alright, kinda pricy food though. Service was really good."}
{"text":"Bar none one of the best brewspot / watering holes for locals in Vegas"}
{"text":"Meh, they changed the Lettuce Wraps. They no longer come garnished with fresh bean sprouts and carrot sliver just red cabbage. :( same price though!!!!   ?????"}
{"text":"Are you kidding me?? There were 4 of us and our food was awful. I had a $20.00 prime rib sandwich consisting of some kind of uniformly thin sliced lunch meat (roast beef?) with melted white mystery cheese served on a soggy brioche bun. Also, the greasiest thin fried garlic fries with a wade of diced up garlic on top. Nobody at the table wanted any. That's a 1st! The upside is my dog liked the meat. There was also a pineapple Asian dish that could have been cooked a tad more. They brought a bone-in chicken thigh and leg. Greasy. The other person got a Southwestern chicken salad. Some of the lettuce was slimy from age. Gross!  It was swimming in dressing and it had weird kinds of chicken pieces. They looked kinda pink but I doubt they were cooked there. Probably came in giant bags. Our server was very nice. This restaurant is not truthful, serve inferior food and charge a ridiculous price on top of that. SHAME on you!"}
{"text":"Rude employees wayyyyy to long of a wait after I arrived. Was ignored.  I am a delivery driver. I won't pick up here again. They won't put in order til I get here. Even though my customer order 25 min prior to my arrival. I will contact my company and their manager tomorrow. Bad move Yard  House. I lived here 20 years. I won't recommend you nor will I come back to pick up from here. Wow!!! Only a place tourists will go to!!"}
{"text":"Amazing choices of great drafts. Great selection of apps and the satein (sp?) choices are all delicious if you're seeking healthier or vegetarian options. It's nothing spectacular but still a step above regular old bar food. The beer makes it worth it."}
{"text":"I've heard amazing things about this place and was prepared to be blown away but unfortunately it was just ok. I stopped in late Sunday night after doing the happy half hour at the High Roller. We had to finish our drinks before we could get a table per their policy. The place was rather empty. We ordered the steak Cobb salad and chicken enchilada soup. The salad was ok but similar to very other Cobb salad I've had. The steak was overdone in some places and chewy in others. The soup tasted great. I really wanted to try the beer or the frozen mule but I'll go back another time for that"}
{"text":"100+ beers, great pub food and reasonable prices.  We were in Vegas for a bachelor party and one of the guys in our group used to live in Vegas.  He said we should stop in for lunch and I'm glad we did.  All of our meals were great and the prices we actually lower and I think they should have been.  This place resembles Miller's Ale House on steroids.

Tuna Poke for $6?  What a bargain!  I tried the roasted turkey melt on french bread after asking our waitress what her favorite sandwich was.  She was spot on because it was fantastic.  

Yard House come to Philly!"}
{"text":"So Yard house is your typical bar/restaurant. Food is pricey for the proportion and is not the greatest. I have ate at yard house at two different occasions and both experiences were the same. The first visit, I ordered hummus with pita and a chicken Caesar salad and the second time I ordered chicken strips and a cheeseburger with fries. Food itself was ok but I have had better."}
{"text":"So much amazing beer. Wouldnt have expected their tacos to be the most delicious things around. Eat here!"}
{"text":"Came to check out The Linq with some friends from Hawaii.

The set up of this Yardhouse is pretty cool. But not too much different from any other Yardhouse. It looks like they might have more seating upstairs but at the time we went in we were on the main floor. 

I like Yardhouse but have yet to have a favorite item on the menu... until now. They apparently have a Eat Late Menu from 10pm to Close. The Black Truffle Cheeseburger... is absolutely to die for. I can't stop thinking about this burger . (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=YG0eR1rDum1k8f0RrAnLBQ&userid=q50PWB-QR1YCHa60kagzgw)

The service was a little disappointing. They weren't very busy at all and it took forever for us to get our drinks and food. 

But other than that, it's like every other Yardhouse that I've been to."}
{"text":"I love Yard House. I would never imagine a place like this having many vegetarian options, but they have an entire vegetarian section on the menu, and it is all fantastic. My boyfriend and I usually sit outside and we love it. The hummus with baked pita is amazing and I love all of the Gardein wings. The onion rings are really good too. Also, the Greek salad is probably my favourite Greek salad ever. This place is awesome (I think I might even like this location better than the one in Illinois)."}
{"text":"Of course they have an excellent beer selection BUT of course it's on the pricey side. Not bad but don't plan on having too many.

The taco side dishes they had were all really, really good.

Service is great as well."}
{"text":"Food is only okay, cheap bar food. The real advantage to this place is the drinks. If it weren't for the Yard House I'd have never found ciders, which I love.

Steaks are not grass-fed, foods are made with low quality oils, chicken is alright. Not paleo at all, even if you try."}
{"text":"Visiting from California for my friend's birthday and we had great service from Ruby! She said she was new, but I never would have guessed it!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. I'm vegetarian and there are so many more options available than at most restaurants that I always have trouble deciding. No matter what I decide on it's great. Service is really great even when the place is packed. It's a little more pricey than what they state here on Yelp, but it's an excellent option for special occasions."}
{"text":"We stop by for happy hour. The staff was friendly and very helpful it was our first time there. So  we asked for advice on some of the menu items especially the happy hour specials our waiter was great wish I remembered his name. The happy hour prices are fair I definitely will come back again maybe for dinner"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, so many food options the menu is almost too big. The tacos are very average. My spritzer cocktail with watermelon puree was amazing though! Good service. I like that the beer sample are free."}
{"text":"Visited restaurant for a beer and snack on Saturday afternoon.  Sat at bar.  Approximately 5 bartenders but no one waited on the bar patrons for 30 minutes.  Finally, waitress took our order but she was so unhappy and mean, she should be replaced.  What a turn off.  Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is complete garbage. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE!!!!! It use to be so good a few years ago and now it turn into trash. The food took an hour to get to our table and when it finally got to the table everyone's food was so cold. I had the steak tacos and the meat was ice cold like it came straight out of the refrigerator. Our waiter was very nice but your wasting your money here go somewhere else like McDonald's. you'll get warmer food.  But on a real note don't go here."}
{"text":"Just ate at the Yard House for the first time. We will not be back!  After waiting 30 minutes for a table, my food was cold and some of the worst I had eaten.  The reason for the 2nd star was the spinach cheese dip was amazing. 

The server brought samples of the 3 beers he thought we might like.  The beers were warm.  WTF really.  I know it's Saturday and busy but damn bro really? 

The server was rude and only came by the table once... Wtf!  

Ok no more Yard House."}
{"text":"Loved this place. We chose to go there for dinner the one mainly bc of the gardein menu options. It have my vegan friends lots of options for food. Food came out hot and well presented and the food was delicious. We loved the huge beer selection as well."}
{"text":"Slowest service ever. And the place is empty. Good thing the one in santana row is much better."}
{"text":"Always super busy! Happy hour is to die for. We get the poke nachos every time! My boyfriend loves the Nashville hot chicken, I thought it was good just not my first choice!"}
{"text":"My review is based on happy hour and I must say it is a darn good happy hour here. 

If you, like me, love beer,  well that's a good reason to go.  Also,  if you love pizza and other treats well you have to check this place out. 

They have a wide selection of beer and the food menu during happy hour is excellent.  

Pizza, union rings,  sushi and other delicious foods and nice staff not to mention that!  

When in Vegas,  we always go there!"}
{"text":"We are huge fans of Yard House but this location did change our view of the brand. Came in twice during our week in Las Vegas and both times we had issues with our food.

We like the eat at the bar and ordered what we consider to be pretty easy items to make. 1. Chicken Nachos- the chicken was not warm . Not appetizing biting into cold chicken with melted cheese and warm chips. We asked to have warmed  but it still came back cool. 

Next day we ordered pizza and a salad. The pizza was lacking toppings-  cheese and sauce along with the mushroom and pepperoni. 

The Ranch Salad was a very nice portion size for sharing however it didn't taste like any ranch salad dressing I have ever tasted. It literally had no taste. 

Both instances the managers did not seem to be too concerned with our issues. 

I gave 2 stars because the beer selection is great and the service on one visit was pretty good. The other visit the service was so so."}
{"text":"It was my first visit to Yard House for a friends birthday dinner and I honestly believe this place is overhyped. The drinks are a hit or miss, but the food is okay at best. Our waters took like 15 minutes to get and I had to ask our waitress for my lemonade three times before she even brought it out. There wasn't really anything that stood out to me about this place. I'm willing to give it another try, but won't bother anytime soon."}
{"text":"The place was packed, even though the server said they were not busy and then started sharing dollar amounts with us at the table of her normal sales vs. that given night.  Come on... tacky.

Not a good experience.  Issues with the wait staff forgetting to put in items in that we ordered, then the kitchen running out, then magically that item shows up on the table.  Got a lot of free food that we didn't order, but unfortunately none of it was good.  Food across the board was very bland.  First time in a long time that I took one bite of a dish and immediately labeled it as disgusting.

Wife has had good experiences there in the past with friends, so maybe they were just having a bad night, but unless she drags me there, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Good place for some beers if you like beer and variety. Good appetizers and everyone there is drinking and looking to talk. Give it a try."}
{"text":"I am a really into craft beer and I was in Henderson visiting my mom. She thought it would be really cool to take me to the Yardhouse because they have so many taps and seem to be a fun place. We were seated fairly quickly and our waitress was very nice. But it took about 15 minutes to even get our drink orders. And then we order appetizers and our meal. That took a while as well and the food was definitely nothing to write home about. The calamari and squid were tough and chewy, and the lobster/crab dip was way to salty! I got the seared ahi sandwich and couldn't even eat half of it, the tuna was dry and overcomes and the dressing was not good. My mom got the baha fish tacos with rice and beans. They were also less than appetizing. Especially for the price! Way overpriced for what you get! I order another beer when our entrees were brought out and it didn't even arrive until we were finished and ready to leave. Yes, this place a great variety of excellent beers, but would definitely not recommend it!"}
{"text":"It is hard to go wrong when you have a WHOLE LOT OF GREAT beers on tap, great service and very good food.  I give them credit, they take good food, and do a very nice job with presentation.

But the reason I give them 5 stars is not what they get right, but how they handled something that I didn't like.  Place was slammed on a Saturday.  Service was very good, but my food came out cold.  Sent it back with a busser, my waitress immediately followed up, apologized, and made sure the replacement food came out hot (it did).  Then the manager came over, apologized, comped that one ordered, and offered our table of 5 a free desert to make up for it.  I always evaluate customer service not based on what is done right, but how a place handles something when the customer feels they were wronged.  

They were very busy that night, but didn't make any excuses for the error, they fixed it, and made everything right.  And for that, I will keep coming back.  

And everything we ordered was very good, on top of the great experience."}
{"text":"Great beer selections, borderline too many. Staff was a bit lagging in prompt attention. Also be prepared to pay, everything is a bit on the pricey side. We had guacamole and chips as a snack. The guac. was pretty good."}
{"text":"Yard House is known for its hard to be matched beer selection.  I've been here a couple of times and always sat at the bar. All the draught beer is pumped in overhead in pipes that add to the décor of the place.  You feel like you're in a cool loft somewhere.

The high point about Yard House can also be its downfall.  While I have no difficulty getting a Molson or something even harder to come by, I also have to pay $6 for it.  And that's for a standard 12 ounce glass.  I know Vegas alcohol prices can be inflated but that's a bit much.

I don't have much experience with the food.  I got some fries with a beer here once and they were on the greasy side.  I'd definitely bring a friend here but maybe during the day.  At night it gets crowded and kind of a scene."}
{"text":"YardHouse has long been our go-to restaurant for date night. The menu is extensive, with something for everyone, and nothing we've ordered has ever fallen short of the mark. The drink menu and beer offerings are excellent, as well. Yesterday, I ordered the appetizer chopped salad for lunch, with blackened chicken. The portion size was HUGE(I only ate half), and the ingredients were fresh and tasty. YardHouse is a great place to go for any occasion."}
{"text":"THIS IS MY SPOT. I eat here all the time and it never disappoints! I order the chicken tortilla soup & the turkey melt with no jalapeños. It is so unbelievably delicious. The fries are yummy, they have the best passion fruit iced tea EVER. I am always well taken care off by their servers. They literally have everything and more. Such a great place to eat and enjoy good friends."}
{"text":"I'll start off saying that our server was awesome, the Manager Leo was unbelievably rude!
Ok, so we had a party of 14 (plus being a Saturday night at 7, we knew it would be busy), so one of our guests went at 6:15 to put in a name and wait for a table, which we were told would be about an hour wait. Well 7 rolls around and no table, so half of our party waits to leave their hotel, because...no table. Well we finally get seated at 7:45 (we tell our friends to come meet us). The server comes 5 minutes later to get drink orders, 5 minutes after that, the Manager Leo comes and asks us when the rest of our party will be there and we say shortly, and he then complains he can't have empty tables for long. Well unfortunately there is a movie theater upstairs (and Stars Wars opened yesterday, so Town Square is busy) so our friends have trouble finding a parking space. Well maybe after 10 more minutes, the Manager Leo comes back to our table and begins to actually yell at us about the empty table, and how they had it reserved at 6 and they held it for us...Which wasn't even for our group! So we tell him this and we tell him our friends are trying to park, but he continues to yell at us and say he needs the table because other people are waiting. We respond and say we had waited (just like everyone else) for over an hour and a half for our table and our friends will be there any minute. He storms off mumbling, and then of course our friends show up 30 seconds later. We did have an issue trying to get our check, and at one point, Manager Leo came over to the corner of the bar area and glared at our table for about 10 seconds and stormed off again. I have to say that I have NEVER seen or been treated that way by a \"manager\" and I think that the General Management need  to have a talk with him. I can't imagine what he's like any other Saturday night during dinner hours."}
{"text":"this is a damn near a 5-star kinda place. my food was terrific. Nicholas, our server, was great. 
it loses point for the portion sizes (small for the price). 

the beer selection is incredible. not a chance you can't find something you'll like. 

i had the Nashville Hot Chicken which was delicious. it came with pickles and sweet potato pancakes. i don't even like pancakes, but these were outstanding - my favorite thing on my plate and i loved the chicken. 
Danielle found her pasta w/ shrimp and vodka sauce to be a bit bland but we both loved the deviled eggs we got as an appetizer.

i hope we can go back again soon. i want more of those eggs now."}
{"text":"Went with my cousin and two daughters for lunch great beers on tap and very good food.  One of us in are party ordered a dish that was not was expected however our server Nikki was quick to offer another dish and rushed...THANKS NIKKI"}
{"text":"Being a local Las Vegan, my husband and I wanted to go check out the Linq. I called the Yardhouse to find out to see if they offer a happy hour like their other locations. No. Ok, went to another restaurant in the Linq for HH and we were meeting three others at the Yardhouse for dinner. My husband is a beer drinker, I am not. I still had a full marguerita left from my HH which they gave me in a to go cup. I'm not a big drinker so I was drinking slowly. Once we were seated at the bar, my husband was asking the bartender questions about the beers on tap. It was at this point the bartender advised me that I couldn't have my drink. I had to \"chug it or take it outside\"! Rude. Yardhouse won't see ANY of my money. I know the bartender is just the messenger but this is a STUPID POLICY. Is my measly marguerita worth losing a bar tab and dinner for five people as well as future business? They won't be getting ours."}
{"text":"Love the Yard house happy hour menu. Always a great beer selection, over 100 beers on tap and the food is always good. Came in today and had 3 Hoegaarden's and chicken lettuce wraps for about $20.00. 

Service has always been good to me, friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Went to Yard House when in Town Square I happened to witness on a TV that Honda scored a goal in the 2014 FIFA World Cup game - Japan vs Ivory Coast.

We moved to Yard House to continue watching the game. We only had a light meal, and it was decent."}
{"text":"This is very high on my list of chain restaurants. I've never had a bad meal and their food is fantastic. I've had everything from the grilled cheese to the pizzas, quest, garlic noodles, bonesless wings, Mac and cheese and the brownie for dessert!! No complaints what so ever!!!!! Happy hour is great!!!"}
{"text":"Wings need to be double baked and weren't that good either way. Lettuce wraps were mediocre at best. Nachos on the other hand were a good size and pretty good. This place is definitely good for beer but only affordable during the happy hour. It feels like their food has gone downhill. 
The shortys are not included in the happy hour. Well you can get them but there it's no discount. I asked our waitress if they were included in the happy hour and she replied \"yes\". We then ordered two to go along with our eats. When the bill came I looked at it and noticed the shortys were the same price as in the menu. I asked our waitress about this b/c of what she has stated earlier. She said \"oh yeah, they are included in the happy hour...But are regular price.\" I was dumbfounded by her answer. Is it just me or does that sound like they are NOT included in the happy hour after all? I'm just saying...
Other then that the service is good here, tons of TV's everywhere. Kids can come hang and it's an overall good, fun and welcoming environment. Worth the visit for their massive beer selection on tap. I wish they had done court of stamp card so I could keep track of every beer I've had there."}
{"text":"My giant group of 12 people stumbled in here after going on the Linq high roller. We only had less than 1.5 hours to get seated with no reservation, order, eat, and pay before getting back to our pick up spot. We thought there was no way this was going to happen Considering the size of our group. At first the host said it would easily be an hour wait to all sit together or about ten minutes to sit at different tables and we didn't mind so agreed. After a few minutes they found a booth for us to all sit together and were really nice and accommodating at the host stand. Our waitress danielle was also so nice and took all our orders quickly. I asked her if she could bring us the bill and boxes before the food came out so we wouldn't be scrambling at the end to pay and just take the food with us, I expected her to bring one big bill but she even separated ALL the checks without us having to ask. That was really really nice of her and everything went so smoothly that we managed to finish eating and settle our checks before our ride got back. It was such a relief and the whole staff was great. And the food is always good so there's also that"}
{"text":"Great beer and the happy hour is one of the best in town.The spicy tuna tool is amazing."}
{"text":"Yard House is a staple in the late-night-casual-hangout category for me. In that aspect, this Yard House did not disappoint! They are located inside the Red Rock Resort, with the usual Yard House setup. Lots of tables, good for group, and a fantastic beer selection. I would absolutely go back for drinks with a group of friends. 

The food at this location was a bit below average- it was all okay (pasta, appetizers), but nothing stood out as great. Unfortunately, our waiter was basically unable to answer any questions about the food or the beers. Something I usually enjoy at Yard House is how knowledgable the staff is about the beer.  

Pros/Cons for going with a large group: 
They split the check by customer (so it was easy to see what you ordered and total up how much each of us owed), although we then waited more than 30 minutes for our cards and cash to be taken."}
{"text":"I hate this place.  I try so hard to like it but the service is terrible and the food is worse. Drinks,  we'll they are over priced. If you want to think this is the place to go on a Friday,  then good for you.  Otherwise it's time to find a new venue to hang out at. Frankly 7-11 would be better."}
{"text":"I literally spent more time in this restaurant trying to leave than I did eating.  Hours for food and then they didn't bring all the food my party ordered.  Half went back.  Dude couldn't figure out how to split the bill for three people.  I literally left and came back into the restaurant and he still was trying to figure out three meals and an appetizer.  He literally said to me \"what do you want? \". To which I replied, \"to leave\".  His response?  \"Me too.\"  Two hours for food and 45 minutes for a bill with five items on it to be deciphered.  Shoot me in the head.  I wouldn't give them a star but I have to do so."}
{"text":"Good food , lots of beer choices but I would like to see more local beer on tap didn't see hardly any beers from Vegas breweries.  Atmosphere lots of people but lots of space.  Choose a booth, table with a wait list or go straight to bar and get seated right away.  Customer service is good but bar can get overwhelmed and take awhile to get drinks. You can also order food at the bar. Love the inside entrance kegs wall to wall or outside entrance has water falls, fountains and relaxing chairs by fire pit."}
{"text":"This is one of the few hangouts I can say that everything from appetizers, entrees, dessert and of course alcohol is pretty perfect!. Service is on and off but the food makes up for it when its off!"}
{"text":"This is the fourth Yard House that I've been to across America and their beer selection continues to impress.  Food selection is also great!  Overall, one of the best places if you are someone who enjoys beer.  Even better if your waitress is knowledgeable (like our was).  Their Jambalaya is outstanding!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went on a Wednesday evening with a bunch of his coworkers. We arrived and were seated right away, but in a very odd C shaped corner booth that was difficult to slide into. Once I slid to the middle of the booth I had 5 to 6 people on either side of me so going to the bathroom at any point during the meal was going to be incredibly inconvenient, so I didn't. It also had a strange draft from the seam where the two back cushions met that was ice cold (because wintertime) and that was on the back of my arm all night. Where did that even come from?

Our waitress was friendly enough but oddly slow (I think her name was Jingle?). She took our drink order and then didn't return until 10 or 15 minutes later to take our appetizer orders and more drinks. We were served 2 drinks and finished our apps before we had to call her over to order our meals, at least 45 minutes after we walked in the door. Also the drinks are anywhere between $7 for beer and $10-14 for mixed drinks (and they're heavy on the ice) so it adds up super fast. Once we ordered the meals came promptly though.

My husband and I split the cheese curds and while they were delicious, they were also really greasy. It's an $11 appetizer. The cups with the dipping sauces were also half filled.

I ordered the jambalaya which was heavy on the rice and not much substance. It was a little spicy and had just 3 well placed shrimp. Granted I did order the small portion but it's still a $15 plate so I'd expect less rice and more substance. It was really tasty though and I was happy I ordered it.

I ordered 2 beers and my husband ordered 2 drinks and our total bill came to $75, and for that kind of money I'd expect a little more. The place is fine if not a bit loud and was crowded when we arrived. We both walked out underwhelmed even though the food was good."}
{"text":"In from out of town. Was there on a Monday afternoon and was wowed by the service from Cody. He offered samples and really made us feel welcome. The decor is classy sports bar. Lunch was delicious with the half sandwich and salad being a great deal and filling. Selection of beer is second to none. We enjoyed it so much we went back Thursday for bike night. Service was still good but Cody wasn't working,  and it wasn't quite as nice. We will definitely come back next time in Phoenix."}
{"text":"The black velvet drink is so good and I don't even like beer. I also hadn't previously tried Guinness but assumed I wouldn't like it. However, this was simply AMAZING. As is the rest of the food at Yard House. I had tons of appetizers (we shared as a table) & had the lobster garlic noodles - fab. It was one of those...I wish I want full so I could keep the flavors going nights!

The westgate area is nice and convenient as well. You have to see it if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Hands my favorite Happy Hour of all time! Marco, and Tim are so Amazing! I love the beer selection they always have my favorite Belgium beers here and the Mules are the Bond!  Omg I love the food too Chicken Nachos or a pizza or wings you are good! Great videos and sports too!"}
{"text":"Oh my God where can I begin with the Yard House. I have been coming to the Yard House for over 11 years I've been to all three of their locations in Arizona. And never have I been disappointed. I love the food there the atmosphere and the vibe. They have the best happy hours hand down. One of my favorite dishes will be the jambalaya pasta. And they have the best spinach dip not up for debate. I am also a big fan of the nachos they are so gigantic and so fulfilling. Not to mention 130 beers on tap. I will continue to be a regular at The Yard House"}
{"text":"Went for lunch and ok.  First beer flat but replace affably and quickly.  Food ok but best part was anticipation and location.  Much closer than other stores. M"}
{"text":"I am so sick and tired of giving this place \"another chance\". I used to LOVE coming here and I never complained about:
1--The long wait to be seated EVERYTIME I came.
2--The overpriced menu, considering the portions. 
3--The long wait time to be served EVERYTIME I came.

However, over the last year or so, it seems as though the portions are even smaller and the service is slower. I take blame for returning, but I guess I just keep thinking that the food will taste like it used to. 100% of the time that we've gone over the past year (which is at least once a month to meet up with friends), we've had to return the fries (small portion, by the way) because they are cold EVERY SINGLE TIME. We just went last Saturday night (which is why I decided to finally write this review), and there weren't many customers because it was right before they closed. We figured that it would taste better since there were less people to cater to. Sadly, the food was worse. My husband's bread was so hard that it was falling apart and the french fries were, once again, cold! When we told the waiter (who I will say was very nice and professional---yayyy!), he did bring us out some more fries, but guess what? You guessed it, the fries were not fresh. It was sooooo evident that all they did was get old fries and just refry them. Therefore, we were eating fries that were as crunchy as potato chips, but at that point, we just got tired of complaining. In the end, we didn't enjoy spending $43 on a burger and fries that he didn't eat, 1 beer, and nachos (this actually is a huge portion, I will say). The time before this, my food was decent, but of course, my fries were cold. The complaint came from my friend. First, they brought her food out long after they brought ours out.  Secondly, her sushi was completely flavorless and she said the fish tasted like it had been sitting out for a while. When she told them, they brought her back a new one, but she couldn't eat it because it was too salty. My friend tried it, and said she was absolutely right. They both said it tasted like they dropped the salt bottle on the sushi. I felt so bad for her because she was hungry, but she didn't get to eat dinner. About two weeks before that, I met up with some friends after work. I ordered a sandwich, and was very specific about the bacon being extra crispy since I am pregnant and do not want to consume raw meat. I also said no mayonnaise and I mentioned that every time I come, I have to return the fries because they are cold. I said this in hopes that she would let the cooks know, and therefore, I wouldn't have to return them again. They brought my meal out with mayonnaise and the bacon was very gristly. When I told them, they brought me a new one. This time, I was happy to see that the bacon was crispy, but they put mayonnaise on it AGAIN.....AND my fries were cold (sigh!). Of course, I got my meal after everybody was done eating too. I decided not to complain again, but I wasn't very happy about paying for a meal that I didn't eat. There are other incidences, but I feel that these are enough."}
{"text":"Came here tonight with a few friends and had Jordan as our server. The kitchen was quite overwhelmed but they managed to get our food out at a reasonable time considering their workload. I ordered the salmon which wasn't exactly to my liking but Jordan was incredibly helpful at getting something a little more suited to my Californian taste buds. He suggested the Ahi - which was seriously, hands down the best meal I've ever had at a chain restaurant. Amazing food, amazing service and Jordan is a superstar. Promote him now!!!"}
{"text":"Great ahi tuna! My husband has the filet and he loved it. The creme brûlée wasn't the best I've ever had though."}
{"text":"Yard House just got even better....They finally divided their incredible beer list into categories making it much easier to choose based upon each person's likes. I never knew they had ciders on the menu based on the names, but the new categories made it easy to see that they do...love the pear one!!!

My only issue with Yard House is that they don't have a late night happy hour on Thursday nights...I can understand the weekends, but what's up with Thursdays?? I always seem to get my Yard House cravings on Thursdays late night, but no Happy Hour :("}
{"text":"I really liked this place.  The waiter was really helpful with the beer recs, even though they were out of my first TWO choices (I'm not knocking them for that - I can't imagine the nightmare involved in keeping that much draft beer available all the time) as the list was just insane.  The food menu is big too - I kind of liked Kristin C's comparison with Cheesecake Factory - they have every kind of food you can think of.  Only this place is more obviously oriented towards young professionals - slightly cheaper, more emphasis on drinking, more hip, &c.

The menu, like the decor, is full of modern touches.  I had the Mac and Cheese, not sure why, which was on the menu as \"Mac and Cheese\" squared, or something.  Trendy, what?  I think it was the brief mention of white truffle oil in the description.  I would rate it as solid, but not a ton of flavor.  A good Mac and Cheese - also big (furthering the Cheesecake comparisons).  

Overall, it was a good experience.  It was definitely filling up after we got there around 6:30 on a Sunday evening.  The layout places the really long bar in the middle of the restaurant, with booths around the outside walls and tables filling the space between.  I think they should have gone with more booths, but it works.  Wait staff was solid - no complaints there, although our waiter who was helping us with the beer list kind of disappeared for several minutes, during which our water glasses (hey, we were trying to pace ourselves, or something) were ably filled by someone else.  

I dock half a star b/c of the price, and the other half due to a slight character deficiency.  Take one leg lamp from A Christmas Story, add some original and more diverse artwork, and call me in the morning."}
{"text":"I felt that it was over-priced for the french dip, but it was a pretty good trip anyway. The booths are huge so that is great if you like to spread out or bring a crowd. 

Service was always acceptable the 3-4 times I've been here."}
{"text":"What I enjoy most about this is the food is always good and whether you're up for bar food or something different or even healthy, there's an option.  I haven't sampled the beers but I've never been with anyone that wasn't satisfied with their drinks.  I've always enjoyed their fish selections and my favorite appetizer is the Ahi Poke Stack.  

I'm looking forward to enjoying the patio in the summer and this place is always busy but I've never had to wait long for a table.  I suggest this is a great place to meet up with friends for drinks and a menu to satisfy most cravings."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here a couple times: once as a large group from his work and once as just us. The food is excellent. I highly recommend the tower of onion rings as an appetizer. The atmosphere is loud, which can be fun if you are part of a large group like we were. As for a date night, it was still fun because the service and the food is good and I didn't feel out of place in a cute dress. Only down side is that it would get kinda loud. I haven't gone during a lunch hour which I could assume might be quieter if you want to bring kids; that way they can actually hear you when you are telling them to finish their food :)"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying this restaurant. I had the surf and turf burger, with the sweet potato fries. My goodness it was AMAZE! By far the BEST burger I've ever had. And they were NOT stingy with the lobster. They burger came with some sauce that I opted to have put on the side. Instead I ended up adding mayo to my sandwich. I sat outside it was a little hot out, but a nice view to watch people walk by and enjoy the ambiance. Can't wait to go to the one out here in PHX."}
{"text":"Probably about 4 stars, but a bonus star for having Old Speckled Hen on tap. Sooo creamy and delicious!

I had dinner here with the family before I flew back to San Jose. The miso sea bass was delicious! Service was great, and pretty empty on a late Sunday afternoon. Good beer selection! Prices seemed a bit high...good thing my dad picked up the tab. ;P"}
{"text":"I always love the Black Orchid Martini, service leaves a little to be desired tho. Noise level is high. My friends decided this would be a good location for my Birthday dinner. I was the last person served & never had a refill of my water."}
{"text":"No matter what Yard house around the county I travel to the food and service are consistently good today was not exception. My favorite sandwich is the pork Cuban with dipping sauce. The hot mustard dill pickles and warm ports on toasted roll dipped into their special pork dipping sauce is one of the best Cubans I have ever had and it consistently good no matter what Yard House I am at. Another great feature is all the beers on tap. One can go to get the regular ones or try one of the many craft beers the rotate through their bars. A great experience every time."}
{"text":"I was there with a friend two nights ago.  We were seated right away and pretty good crowd for a Tuesday night. Ordered the fish and chips and and was delish.  Great food and washed it down with a PBR and Checvar.  I'm vegetarian or actually pescatarian and good to see they had a great vegetarian menu option.  Definitely will try that out next time."}
{"text":"I have gone to this Yardhouse since it opened. I love this restaurant, and the food prices are right. Drink prices are a little expensive, and we can't go every week, but best out of town restaurant for guests."}
{"text":"We had fabulous service, fabulous beer selection and fabulous food! Would definitely return. Try the truffle fries! They are worth flying back to Las Vegas for!"}
{"text":"Had to kill an hour waiting to meet up with some friends at Red Rock Casino.  Yard House does that well with all their beer on tap.  They had just rotated in some new options.  I was happy to see some local brews on the list.

I had a couple of beers that were good.  Barkeeps were friendly and on top of things.  Everyone loves Olivia.  That happens when you're attractive, friendly, and bring glasses of beer to people.

One complaint, I ordered a second beer just before the end of happy hour.  The beer was brought then the beer was added to my tab.  I looked at the tab, I missed the happy hour price by 1 minute.  But the order was put in a couple of minutes before the order was entered on the computer.  There should be some push back on that, or servers should know to ring up the order first.  Not a huge problem over a dollar (or whatever the happy hour savings is)."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this place seems like one of those establishments that's generating so much business that they have employees drop the ball on customer service. My lady and I were actually excited to try YardHouse for the first time. The menu looked attractive and plus it's inside of my favorite casino resort Redrock Station. Unfortunately the experience was poor as soon as we walked through the door. We were first greeted by a gentleman that said we had to see somebody else to be seated. I really couldn't understand what he was saying. We ask him where do we go, and instead of him giving us proper directions or better yet walking us to where we needed to go, he just randomly pointed and stated \"down there\". So we decided we would figure it out and proceeded to walk, trying to stop someone for directions. Once we got to the waiting area we were told it's a 20 minute wait. The wait was more like 30 minutes but we were so excited to eat here we didn't mind at all. When we were finally taken to our seats our table was across from the kitchen directly in front of the main entrance. We definitely do not like trying to enjoy a meal with constant servers and customers passing us and hearing the commotion of the kitchen, so we asked to be seated at a booth, the young lady replied with broken english \"it's up to the boss\". My lady and I both looked at each other in disbelief. I was so shocked that I ask the server again and she actually said it again but this time with a long and awkward explanation. She took us back to the waiting area and it looked like the conversation she had with \"the boss\" seemed to irritate \"the boss\". \"The boss\", who's name tag read Allessa, was irritated to the point that she scratched our names from the top of the waiting list, put our names at the bottom and practically threw the pager at my lady with no eye contact or explanation as to what was going on. I ask her do we have to wait again and I received no response. So I switched up the question and ask how much longer is the wait and she answered \"about 5 minutes\". While waiting outside for about 15 minutes we wondered into Lucilles Bar-B-Q, which is literally about 10 steps away. We really weren't in the mood for barbecue plus the menu was a little more pricier than YardHouse, but the staff was so friendly and welcoming we considered it. We went back outside to wait but after about 25 minutes we returned the pager and told the \"the boss\" aka Allessa that we were leaving. What's even worse is that her attitude basically said good ridden. Something like that could definitely ruin your night especially when you have high hopes of a great experience. My lady and I ended up waiting an hour to be seated at Lucille's barbecue but the wait was well worth it! In my line of work I have to give not just excellent but perfect customer service, otherwise I don't generate income. It's highly unfortunate that a reputable establishment such as Yard House would have employees representing the business in that manner. This place definitely doesn't live up to the excellent customer service experience associated with Station Casinos."}
{"text":"Second time I've eaten here and it was fabulous! The watermelon margarita was refreshing, the hot chicken sandwich and fries were delicious and the mini peach apple cobbler with caramel ice cream was to die for. I'll be back!! Service was great as well. And I love the outdoor seating!"}
{"text":"Yard house.. What happened? I love yard house, but I am seriously conflicted now and want to say it was a one time thing. I hope.

I have been a patron of yard house for over ten years at this location and have never been disappointed until now. Having spent the last six years in the military, I have had the pleasure of visiting multiple yard houses across the country and never had a bad meal or experience. Until now.

So, I love beer and IPA's are my crack. 60 plus beers on tap and great food, I love it. I recently moved back to Arizona and just happened to see that this yard house had Dogfish Head 120 minute IPA on tap today. Those of you that know what that is to the craft beer world, and actually like it, understand the significance of seeing it on tap. My wife enjoys it too, so dinner tonight was an easy decision. Enough boring stupid backstory, here's the rundown of tonight's experience.

My wife and I went in around 530. Obviously we would have to wait, no complaints here, it's worth it. Usually. We were excited to have 120 on tap and that was the first thing we asked our server. They ran out two hours prior he said. Ugh. Okay, that sucks but they have a great beer list and the food will make up for it. While I'm thinking that, the server suggests I have a 90 minute IPA and they will add a shot of something to make it comparable to the 120...... I laughed and asked if that was a joke right? No he was serious. I'm not kidding, I wish I was. Alright then, so my wife ordered an IPA, and I ordered a different one. She got her's and the server said mine would be up in a sec. Okay. I'm not kidding when I say it took just under ten minutes for me to get mine. What the hell. Already annoyed we order our appetizer, chicken lettuce wraps. They were good, no complaints there at all. For the entrees, we ordered the penne pasta with chicken and the French dip. The French dip for the record has always been excellent, always. This time it was cold, and was nowhere near how good it used to be. The penne pasta was good, I mean how could you really screw that up, so can't complain. 

Here's the reason why i'm giving this two stars. No, I can't complain about not having the beer on tap, I get it. This is getting two stars because of the server. Dude, you really suggested I add a shot into a beer to make it comparable to another beer? What? Okay, you don't understand beer, whatever. But, ten minutes from when one of us received a beer to when the other did and no I'm sorry or even noticed it happened? A cold French dip? How do you eat that? Ugh. 

I love you yard house, I really do but I'm having serious conflicting thoughts about returning anytime soon. The service and food ruined our experience tonight. Honestly, I hope this was a one time thing."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend had this for dinner tonight. We just happened to be at the mall and saw the yard house. We are here visiting from California and we have a yard house so we figured easy choice and we are so glad we did. We wanted to celebrate our anniversary with just a nice dinner together. The hostess and manager were at the front entrance and greater us so warmly I had think for a second do I know them ha but of course I don't were from outta town. So we were already off to a great start then our waitress Mackenzie B came to our table. What amazing service she was so sweet and upbeat and just cared. We had some great conversations, she let us know about happy hr and answered any questions we had. I cant believe she has only been their a few months, she is very knowledgeable of the restaurant  and I love that. We got 2 beers and like 4 dishes to share and we were so full, so much food, great prices and so good. Great dinner hands down. Thank you guys."}
{"text":"My first time at the Yardhouse. Menu was hugh maybe to big. We tried two of their soups and two of their \"favorite' entrees. All of the food was very good. Two thumbs up to our server named \"Rosie\", she was terrific."}
{"text":"I have actually never been to a Yard House and probably would have continued to avoid it but it was a friends birthday so we had to go.

They don't let you make reservations past 4:00, so if you call in at 4:02 like my friend did to reserve seats for 10 you are SOL.  

We got there and had to wait 30 minutes for our seats cause the place was BANANAS BUSY.  Like everyone who lives in Desert Ridge eating here at the same time busy and it was LOUD.  

We finally got seated, after the hostess passed out, no exaggeration.  We were seated and I found it unusual you don't have a waiter/ess per se, but a bevy of people bringing and dropping stuff off which I guess helps with efficiency but lacks in anyone knowing what you are drinking and what you have asked for.

The beer selection is massive.

I ordered a side salad and it was HUGE. The pear salad with blackened grilled chicken and it was tasty.

Everyone seemed to like the food it was just a bit much for me.  Too loud, too many people, not a specific waiter to get the job done and it felt rushed like they wanted us out of there and fast.

Would I go back, probably not cause it just didn't stand out to me but I wouldn't hate it if I had to out of my control, like this instance."}
{"text":"On the table lay the following entrees: ahi sashimi, deviled eggs, traditional wings, and  fish n chips with truffle fries. Different chains of the food group... what a great mix of texture, flavor and taste. It was a sword fight of tangy, salty, and spice! Wash it down with some hefeweizen and it completes the taste experience! 

Let's not forget dessert! I indulged in the mini trio sampler comprised of lemon soufflet,  peach apple cobbler, and chocolate soufflet. The benefits of sugar is the rush of taste and the adrenaline that comes with it. I received my second wind after the \"ittis\" and as Tony, Toni, Tone sang \"It feels good!\" 

Experience makes great memories when it is satiated with the good company you keep. Thank you to my dear friend for treating me to this fine meal."}
{"text":"I went for the first time last weekend and I had a little issue. I called ahead to not have to wait so long because I had 3kids with me, I waited for longer then expected but the manager handled it like a champ! Thanks the food was so good and the service was great."}
{"text":"My first time eating out at Time Square and perfect 10/10 overall.

All of the wonderful staff were attentive and kind during the slow Monday lunch rush. It was much appreciated and seeing their smiles made my midday. It wasn't the fake costumer service smile you see at other American bars, it was the I'm proud of where I work smile. Which is rare in this day and age where costumer service isn't as exceptional as Yard Bird. Sharon and Kristian (misspelled Kristian's) made sure my experience there was amazing! 


I got the Korean short rib street taco meal and my boyfriend got a bacon burger meal. Whatever all of the chefs were doing, keep on doing it! The contrasting flavors with the taco, spicy rice and refried beans made the meal a perfection of fusion flavors. Lol, I got some of his French fries before he ate them all yet fried just right. Perfectly crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside along with the right amount of salt made the fries addicting. I will be back, this time towards the end of the day. Trying the chocolate sout root beer float is next! You guys from management to crew amd chefs are greatly appreciated."}
{"text":"Beautiful new restaurant! Our server Justin was very personable and friendly...we really enjoy this location, but then the YardHouse never disappoints!!! I'm a happy camper :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to The Yard House yesterday at Westgate. We were trying to catch a movie and should have had ample time to eat and have a beer before (an hour and a half) especially when the restaurant was 3/4 empty in the late afternoon. When we arrived and were seated we noticed that it was quite hot inside. The waiter told us the air-conditioning was on fritz. Really? This is Arizona in the summer. It was literally 120 degrees outside, and they couldn't call the AC repair guy?
Our waiter was very friendly and attentive, and honestly the only saving grace of our experience. We ordered our beers (they do have an AWESOME selection) and I ordered a salad, and my husband a sandwich. The beers came quickly, but the food took over an hour. Let me just reiterate that the restaurant was basically empty and we ordered a salad and a sandwich. We ended up missing our movie (by a half hour) and left hot and sweaty. 
The ambiance would be enjoyable if they fixed their A/C unit. The menu is presented as New American and definitely tries to give an heir of class, but it is really just average diner food. My salad was pre-chopped bagged lettuce with bottled dressing. My husbands sandwich was on sliced white bread. Definitely not great.
We certainly won't eat here again, and won't be going back for beers either unless they get their A/C in working order. I just feel bad for those poor servers who were stuck working in long sleeved uniforms in the sweatbox."}
{"text":"The service staff was amazingly attentive, polite and kept us happy.
The food was well-seasoned and diverse...
The guacamole was one of the best restaurant guacamoles I've had...
GREAT job guys!!!

Oh and your assortment of beverages was superb as expected :)"}
{"text":"I'm a lover of variety,and damn does this place do it. With over 100 beers on tap, wow can't get bored. the happy hour is superb, with the greatest ahi tuna. the california roll looks unique when it arrives. I had the best burger I think I've ever had from here, and I don't remember which one it was  :("}
{"text":"This review is solely based on the chicken lettuce wraps. I've never had them anywhere else as delicious as yard house. When I come here that's all I order with a glass of red wine. Perfection"}
{"text":"One of my favorite American restaurants!

I've always gone to the one at Town Square which is ridiculously busy! But this new one at the LINQ is the better of the two-- maybe because it's not soooo busy, great staff, great location, new everything!, and still provide the same great food!

Lots of menu items to choose from! 
- Appetizers like truffle fries (all time favorite), spinach dip, shrimp ceviche, street tacos (fish taco, chicken tinga, grilled short rib, grilled pork belly are a must try!), wings, onion ring tower, etc! 
- Soups & Salads! 
- Sandwiches & Burgers (we had the BBQ Bacon Cheddar - they put the BBQ sauce on the side, burger alone was juicy and you can't go wrong with bacon but the sauce topped it off)!
- Seafood Entrees!
- Steaks (ribeye is always my first choice)!
- Pastas (their truffle Mac n Cheese is booomb)!
- Desserts
- Countless Beers & Drinks! (Framboise - berry beer float and their watermelon beer)!

ETC, ETC, ETC!

Just thinking about the place makes me want to go there right now! Lol maybe it's just me but I like everything there! ¯\_(?)_/¯"}
{"text":"The Yard House is a great place for appetizers, drinks at the bar, dinner, and just hanging out with friends.  I love the atmosphere and the one draw back is that it seems everyone else always has the same idea to go when I do.  So my only suggestion is to arrive to be pleased, have fun, and above all patient to be seated or find a spot at the bar.  

My most recent excursion was for an ill advised late night snack that had me succumb to the delicious Calimari.  I do love to order this dish in many places but I always love how here it's prepared fresh and hot, and rather quickly and accompanied with the spicy tomato and tartar sauce.  I love the plentiful dipping sauce and attentive service for more on request.  I also appreciate how this is a place that serves fresh brewed ice tea for those of us in a hiatus from imbibing the many beers available on tap. 

So if you're a drinker, have plenty of hungry friends, love ice tea, and just want a fun time, check out Yard House."}
{"text":"What a GREAT experience!  The food was A+, so many beers/cocktails to choose from & the salted caramel butterscotch pudding was CRAZY good!  The best part was our server, Tiffanie! Friendly and on top of everything! Just overall terrific experience!"}
{"text":"WARNING: VEGANS AND VEGETARIANS!! THEIR GARDEN MENU IS SUPPOSED TO BE VEGAN BUT I WAS TOLD BY THE WAITER THAT THE ONLY VEGAN IS THE VEGAN BURGER!! He said that they cook all the other vegan or vegetarian stuff along side animal products. I just don't understand why you would promote vegetarian or vegan when you would cook these vegetarian foods along with equipment you cook animal flesh on. I will be contacting peta to take them off the list for vegan friendly restaurants. This is absolutely disgusting. They even use the name GARDEIN on their menu and GARDEIN is a brand that is completely vegan but because this company refuses to accommodate vegans non of their stuff is vegan except for one item because they have to cross contaminate the food with animal flesh. I will also be contacting GARDEIN because this is unacceptable. Why would you use a completely vegan product and not live up to their standard."}
{"text":"Rude service, unfair wait time for horrible food. Been up all night sick. But thanks to the manager who so promptly refilled my beer with her hand out for immediate payment as she removed my plate for a redo. Tourists don't even deserve this trap."}
{"text":"I had the vodka shrimp pasta and it was great. My husband got the ham and pineapple pizza and it was terrible. We even attempted to drown it in ranch to mask the flavor. The pizza actually tasted like I made it at home with pillsbury dough from the grocery store and then let my children put the toppings on it. The service was okay at best. Our server wasn't particularly friendly but not technically rude."}
{"text":"The food is always great here. I'm using the rating for the poor customer service. The front desk staff is always busy socializing vs taking care of customers. Wether it's about what time they are off or how it was working their pf chengs second job. It even gets worse when I have to speak to a manger just to take my order over the phone. Management is great overall and nice people. But they need to spend more time supervising the front of the house when it comes to customer service. Especially during rush hour. Have more staff who are ready to work and serve. I don't need to hear about if Chris should shave his head or keep long hair. Or how Gabrielle and Candice talk about how a customer who called in and has a reservation at 1pm is \"so irritating\" all this going on while I'm waiting up front like a dummy waiting to pay for my $100 take out order..."}
{"text":"My best friend and I sat in the reject section of the bar and we loved it!  The staff here is funny, attentive and great to be around.  Of course I can't get enough of their Tortilla Soup!  Perfect place to wind down and just have fun after a long work week.  This may be the new OI!"}
{"text":"Kick ass customer service at this Yard House!

Their menu includes Gardein vegan protein items, but the dishes have to be customized vegan, so make sure you ask.  I requested a \"chicken sandwich\" with the gardein protein sans cheese.  When it arrived it had cheese and mayo.  I told the waiter, and he was deeply apologetic.  A few minutes later, the manager came up to me and said the meal would be on the house.  Now THAT is customer service!  

As you probably know, their beer selection rocks and the ambiance is fun and friendly.  All the bartenders had something to chat about and were genuinely knowledgeable about beer.  

Love it!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Environment changes from family during the day, and chill and relaxed by night. Service is always the best and all employees exceeds expectations.

To be specific, Robert is a waiter here and for some reason every time we come back we get sat at Robert's sections. Which is nice because I think I may have made a friend because he is very friendly, so I recommend try getting him as a server.

Highly recommend to go to this location or any other locations. Food is great and everyone is informative and friendly. Waiters are very well informed of the menu and will guide you if it is your first time."}
{"text":"Love coming here for a late night happy hour! We always enjoy getting the chicken lettuce wraps - so many amazing flavors. We also get the ahi tuna and spinach dip! Love that their portions are large to get filled up. This is my first time at this location and it was a quiet Tuesday night."}
{"text":"I was surprised that I haven't written a review for the Yard House...weird. 

Well to sum it up, this latest visit to the Yard House was for a close friends Birthday Dinner. I was only expecting five people or so, but she reserved almost 20 some-odd seats!!! So good to know that the Yard House does take reservations in advance for such a huge party.  The party didn't start off as planned since the birthday girl was nearly two hours late for her own party!! lol. However, thank goodness for the large LCD TV screens plastered on every inch and corner of this place, we were able to kill the time, starting with some drinks and enjoying Sunday Night Football at the same time...so it all didn't go to waste :) The beer selection is AMAZING! They dedicate a whole two pages of the menu just for the beer, I've also seen Beer Floats and I have yet to try one. If you don't want to spend full price on alcoholic beverages, they have Happy Hour from 10pm-Close. 

The Yard House...its an interesting restaurant. The ambiance in this place is...well....AMAZING!? ha ha. It's weird, you sit there at your table and the lighting is dim and serene, yet at the same time, with the LCD Screens and the bar smacked right in the middle of the restaurant, it's also like a pub! So...like a high class restaurant/Pub/Sports bar/Lounge? Does this make any sense? Because I'm just typing away and totally going off subject..........

Food! I usually start off with the Calamari, the baby-squid type, not that O-ring type! Yum Yum....and my main dish is always the Crab Crusted Swordfish on Wasabi Mashed Potatoes. Absolutely amazing! The swordfish is cooked just right, every time I have ordered this dish, and not once was the fish over cooked. Its pretty pricey, $23.00 (give or take), but the portion is well worth your money! :) However this time I decided to try something else and a bit lighter. Since i filled my body with a lot of alcohol for the night, something big would get me sick so I decided to order something small. So I figured an appetizer, that's small enough right? I ordered the Ahi Poke Stacker which was $11.95. Ahi Poke is cubed raw tuna tossed in a mix of soy sauce, sesame seed oil, onions, limu, green onions. I grew up on this stuff, so I was quite curious of the Yard House's recipe. I was VERY satisfied. When I received my plate, first layer was ahi poke, then a layer of \"fried something\", next topped with seasoned sauteed Carrots, another layer of  the fried \"crispy something\", topped with more poke. It was light, refreshing, and absolutely delish!!! The taste was just as amazing as its presentation. :) My new favorite dish! Don't forget to finish off with the Kona Coffee Sundae for dessert, it's quite big, so you can share with a friend or significant other! 

Usually with big groups, taking orders could be tricky. It makes sense for a group of 14, to assign two waiters to take orders. After that experience, unless the two waiters can communicate good, its not a good idea. Problems such as taking double orders (esp with drinks..) not cool! But it was all squared away with no problems. Other than that the waiters were on their game and totally cool!"}
{"text":"The staff is friendly and the location looks cozy but however the food isn't all that.. my boyfriend got the southern chicken breast and it was such a small amount of food he had to order something else to get full.. it was just one piece of chicken breast and like a scoop of mash potatoes that's it.. I got a sandwich it was ok nothing really special.."}
{"text":"Its a big place. Great patio dinning as well. Food... Not bad at all. But nothing that your going to request the recipe of. But if you like beer, and beer by the yard, and you go with a designated driver ( which I tend to always be) then you'll like this place. Great for before or after any event at Westgate. But also long waiting if events are occurring. Call a head 30 minutes before arrival to cut down wait time"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner because I was craving the beer I always get here, RoseGaarden, so my lovely girlfriend was kind enough to bring me. This beer is a blend of hoegaarden and I believe raspberry ambroisia. We both had classic cheeseburgers, mine with pepper jack and BACON ! Both burgers cooked perfect, came with some delicious sauce, and plenty of fries that come in a separate metal cup type thing. This is nice for me since I don't really like my food to touch, and gives me extra plate space for ketchup. Both of us were happy and full. Only thing is kinda pricey. $50 for two burgers, a coke, and a beer."}
{"text":"Very extensive menu and beer selection.  I highly recommend the Yard House.  A large group of us all enjoyed a variety of different menu items from the menu including the fish tacos and macaroni & cheese.  My husband goes here for happy hour with his friends."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour and I ordered plenty of food off the happy hour menu. I started with some deviled eggs which were fantastic. I then ordered the crab cakes and seared ahi tuna. The crab cakes were also fantastic but the ahi tuna was just average. I finished my large meal with a grilled cheese and tomato bisque, both of these were delicious and I'm glad I had room to order them."}
{"text":"This place has it all. Food, loads of brews on tap, awesome adult beverages and people. We've enjoyed the grill cheese and tomato bisque soup on colder nights and various apps. Tonight we enjoyed drinks and apps. The bartenders are friendly and attentive,the drinks poured well and quite tasty .  Football watching and conversation with great company made for a wonderful night."}
{"text":"They told us it would be 55-85 minutes on Saint Patricks day and they got us in in under 30, I was very impressed. We ordered Nachos as an appetizer and it was HUGE! We easily could have just ordered that and a side salad and been full for the three of us. It was $70 for all of us to eat (no drinks) and it gave us an extra meal for the next day. Food never disappoints at Yard House, very good! Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Food used to be much better....last few times we weren't happy. Last time we went we got a margherita pizza that had whole half garlic clove chunks on it. No one wants to eat a whole mouth of garlic. Aside from that pizza had little/maybe no sauce and wasn't crisp, my frozen pizzas taste better. Nachos ok, not great. Think I got diabetes from the martini they served me. Not sure if it's the cooks or they decreased the quality of the food but very disappointed."}
{"text":"The food here is good portions are just right. We would come here to try out the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"A large group of us were meeting for lunch.  This was the right place to do it!  Great service with an abundance of food!

With a large group you never really know how the waiter will handle things.  Luckily we had a great guy who really made it welcoming for each and every one of us.  He made it a point to make a personal experience while you were dining.  It was wonderful.  

Our table shared some Queso with Chorizo to start.  It's served with tortilla chips as well as pita bread. Rich in flavor and great to share.  I would definitely add the chorizo every time. Our turkey sandwich was great.  The swiss & fontina cheese accompanied with the avocado and jalapeño spread made this sandwich so delightful!  A turkey sandwich with a little kick is always good!  The BBQ chicken pizza was good but nothing over the top. I would suggest ordering one of their other pizzas or menu items.

We enjoyed a great lunch with great service.  Thanks Yard House!"}
{"text":"It's a bit of a trip but it's my favorite Yardhouse in Vegas. No offense to the others. My suggestion is to go around 8. Eat out in the outside dining. That's if you're on a date or even if you're trying to throw back some brews with some friends. You won't regret going. Worth the trip."}
{"text":"This was so close to being a 4 star review until the very end of my time here.  I'm giving it 3 because the food was decent, the beer selection was insane, and its convenient for brew and view.  To see why its not 4 stars read on....

I went with my husband on a Friday around 3:30 for their happy hour to get toasty before seeing a movie - a pretty convenient location for that.  When we first got in, I remarked how I couldn't believe there was a woman at the bar with her friend and her infant child in a stroller next to them.  Something I'm not used to seeing but the place was pretty empty at that point so I disregarded it.  (Even though if I came with a baby in a stroller- which I would not-  I would choose to sit at one of the 50 empty tables and not AT the bar, but that's just me.)

The place was big and as I said mostly empty, and somehow the hostess still managed to seat us in an area with no waitress.  After eyeing a few of them as they walked by our table to help the tables around us, one finally came over to us - \"Is anyone helping you?  I can go figure out who is supposed to be your waitress.\"  No, you are going to take our order.

Like I said, the food honestly was pretty good.  We had the chicken lettuce wraps which had a ton of pine nuts (yum!) and came with three delicious dipping sauces - hoisin, peanut satay, and a sweet and spicy.  We also had the chicken nachos and onion rings which were average.  The onion rings were served with your choice of dipping sauces- ranch or slightly pink ranch.  (I like to call it Ranch Rose)  I would highly suggest they develop a horseradish dipping sauce.  

Overwhelmed by the beer selection, my husband asked for a recommendation, saying he usually goes for the lagers, pale ales, and amber ales, and the waitress had no clue what he should get, only that \"I remember someone ordering one of the pale ales earlier and didn't like it.\"  Ok. . .I ordered a rum and coke, seeing as well drinks were supposed to be $4 for the happy hour special.  We got out beverages and I tasted my drink and thought the bartender screwed up and put stoli vanilla in it - my husband tasted it and agreed.  Oh well, I'm not one to complain.  When ordering our second round, I specifically emphasized \"ANOTHER RUM and coke.\"  This time, a bus boy brought our drinks to us and handed me the glass and said \"Your Captain and coke.\"  Here's a lesson to all the waitresses out there - when your special is $4 well drinks and your clientele doesn't specify the brand of alcohol they want, that means \"well liquor.\"  Don't substitute it with \"top shelf\" liquor (if you can call Captain that) and definitely DON'T substitute regular rum with spiced rum.  \"Captain and Coke\" is a VERY specific drink.  \"Rum and Coke\" is not.  

It turned from bad to worse when the kid in the booth behind us decided to toss his straw over and it hit me in the head.  I turned and scoured at the table of parents and they shrugged it off and pointed to the kid as if to say, \"Oh it wasn't our fault, he was just a kid.\"  For all the parents reading this, if your children can't behave and you can't control them, don't bring them to happy hour.  It is NOT okay to shrug off bad behavior like that.  If it were my child, I would demand he apologize to whomever he hit.

When we got the bill, I was glad to see that I was charged the full price for my \"rum and cokes.\"  Stellar, exactly why I came to happy hour.  As we left, the place had filled in pretty well, and I saw ANOTHER stroller with a baby in it, only this time the parents were just standing around not even in seats or at the bar! (They also had a toddler who was sitting on the floor of the bar area.)  I'm sorry, I'm just appalled.  I've never seen babies saddling up to a bar before.   What if someone accidentally walked by and spilled beer on your baby?!  A bar is not a place for children, I don't care how bad you need a drink and its happy hour."}
{"text":"I came here while on vacation with a group of friends, it's a pretty nice actually! Really interesting decor, lots of televisions for the sports fans and a lot, I mean a lot of beer, they actually have 4 pages of their menu dedicated to beer, so there are lots to choose from. It was very busy when we got there, but our server was great. She was helpful and answered all of our questions. We ordered our food and it arrived about 25 mins later, as I said it was very busy. All I have to say is that the wait was definitely worth it, the food was divine, as in I wanted to keep on eating, but I was just too full, ( why can't I have two stomachs !?! ) their portion sizes are big here, so you can share the main courses with your significant other and get a snack or appetizer and try something new along with your main meal. I would definitely come back here as they have a meat substitute section on the menu- so to all of my vegetarian friends out there, you too can have your very own soy chicken wings, should you so choose, I did not have them, but will be giving them a try when I come back. Give this place a try and you will not be disappointed, I know I wasn't!"}
{"text":"I have always loved the yardhouse and go a few times a year being so close to my house.  We went in February and had the worst wait ever.  We could only assume that it was because of Valentines weekend.  We waited an hour to get seated and placed our order promptly but our patience wore out when the food was taking OVER and hour to get to our table.  I would have left angry had it not been for management that night.  As soon as I brougth it up to them, they took care of our whole table.  They couldn't apologize enough, and made sure we got a discount on our bill.  Due to this I have to commend them...customer service is big with me.  If there is a problem and they step up to take care of it shows that they care about their customers dining experience.  I know my review is really late but it's better late than never! PS....the food was awesome even though it was late to get to us."}
{"text":"Thank you all for being friendly, attentive, great service and wonderful food. I ate too much but good thing there is a mall next to you to walk some of it off :)"}
{"text":"Always good service and huge selection of beer. Disappointed they took firestone double barrel out of the bar... But not the fault of the bartenders... Ask for Brad at the bar he's friendly and a good bartender."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is laid back and inviting. A ton of different beers of all varieties. If you cant gind a beer here just stop drinking beer. Service fast, funny yet professional. Server didnt mind a lot of questions and she was super knowledgeable. We eat off the vegetarian/Gardein menu and love it all. Great place to eat prices are in line with the quality of the experience. To me its well worth every cent."}
{"text":"great food and large amounts of beer selection. i recommend the seared ahi tuna sandwich, onion ring tower, california roll, poke` stack, classic sliders, and another one of my favorites is the New York Steak sandwich."}
{"text":"Gigantic bar, good HH spot. Extensive menu with standard bar fare. Starters outshine the entrees. Nachos, boneless buffalo wings, onion rings were decent. Pass on the hummus plate. Good service, but would probably just return for large draft selection."}
{"text":"I usually stop in every now and then to grab a beer and a bite. Never had a problem with the food or service. I liked it well enough to want to try to have a large dinner. I called and asked to make reservation on a Saturday at 7pm. Apparently, reservations are only accepted until 4:30pm on Friday and Saturday. That surprised me because most people are not even off work that early on Friday. I was offered that I could come early and try to get a table. Needless to say, if you are interested in just having a bite and a beer, this is a pretty good place. If you want to have more than a couple friends, expect a long wait or make your way elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is great!
Their Happy Hour is great (regular and late-night), they have great drinks, great food (I love the Summer Salad, not to mention their HUGE sandwiches/burgers), and great service.  

Plus there are a ton of seats so you rarely have to wait too long for a table.

ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Country fried chicken 
And tortilla soup 
Are the business!!!! 
Time to walk it off here in town square"}
{"text":"I already love Yard House...they are a chain and the food is consistently good regardless of location.  I live in Seattle and go to location here.

I'm writing Yelp review for this location because the staff is superb!  I can supber bowl sunday of all days and they were one of the only restaurants that did not charge cover to get in.  THE PLACE WAS PACKED!!!!

I honestly expected the service to be lacking for this reason.  However, the food/drinks were out quickly and the staff was extremely pleasant.

Yard House already has GREAT food but this place put on a clinic super bowl sunday.  By 10 am their line was wrapped around the building...they were organized, had a process and seated folks pretty quickly."}
{"text":"This is so awesome, they have a full menu for vegetarians! Love all the options. The gardein wings are amazing. Thanks for thinking of us, and having lots of options to pick from."}
{"text":"Aquí es un restaurante muy rico que te da variedad de comida y a precios accesibles tienen varios tipos de cerveza cuando voy a las Vegas siempre vamos a este restaurante que esta muy rico y todos los meseros te atienden súper bien"}
{"text":"I love Yard House! The food is top notch, with unquie twists on modern classics. I love the spicy tuna roll appetizer especially - it is not your typical sushi roll, but a big slice, and it is freaking amazing, the spice and the zest are just right. I have been there a few times and have always had great experiences with the food and servers, who are very friendly and attentive. I keep coming back to try different items on the menu."}
{"text":"I love to go to Yard house for lunch, its quiet, the service is amazing and its not so loud either.  I am addicted to their Chicken Garlic Noodle, I tried couple other dishes, but Chicken Garlic noodle is simply too good..lol
I always ask them, half the oil, more vegetable if possible and they do it nicely with a smile.  lol

too bad I am not a huge beer fan, but of course who else has no beer collection than Yard house."}
{"text":"Great beer and lack of quality food. I ordered a simple cheese burger and the hamburger meat was salty and dry"}
{"text":"We love Yard House and come to this location regularly. The service is always friendly and the food is always good.

The menu is pretty extensive and includes vegetarian options. We normally order burgers and are always happy with them. They have a creme brulee on the dessert menu which is also pretty good. 

The only con is that wait times can be long since it's in such a busy area. But that won't stop me from going there and I totally think it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Only reason i didn't give 5stars is because you took away the skinny fries the best thing you guys had on the menu! Great job corporate"}
{"text":"They have a very impressive beer menu which they do a tasting sampler for. The real star though is the mac + cheese. It's full of chicken and smoky bacon! I highly recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"My wife likes this place more than me. They do have a very wide variety of beers to select from. I don't think the food is anything special. I would recommend it for beer drinking though."}
{"text":"I think it's obvious this place has a tons of beers on tap, and therefore they deserve an award, but to get a five star award you've got to have something else that's special. That they have, and it's the salmon. The appetizers are really good as well. If you go here get the lettuce wraps appetizer, the salmon plate, and a big ass IPA. You'll leave feeling really good."}
{"text":"I love Yard House, and I love this Vegas location! I've eaten here many times and never had a bad experience. It's located in the Linq Promenade on the Strip. Many fun, exciting things to see and do around here. Great service, great food, and great beer!"}
{"text":"Not a place for a good burger. Disappointed with table service and their lack of attention. Red Rock Casinos is an amazing place to visit and would definitely recommend to check out with the Downtown Summerlin stores just a small walk away."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time for my birthday the other day, and I was not disappointed! Great service, the food was so delicious. When checking my i.d. my cute little waiter noticed my bday and brought out a special adorable dessert for me. I actually cannot wait to go back and eat here again!"}
{"text":"Usually try and avoid large chains - and my experience here showed why.

Went with Mrs Z and Junior Z at about 4:00pm on a Wednesday.  Had to wait a while for a hostess to come and seat us (no problem), but when she arrived she acted like it was a hassle to seat us.

We sat outside and the server was great.  The wine list was vanilla and overpriced for what it was.  We had a few of the happy hour appetizers and it was bland and most likely frozen food. 

Not a terrible experience, but definitely bland and boring and not worth the time/money.

So many good restaurants in Phx - would rather support them."}
{"text":"I'll start this one out with four stars. I've been to yard house many times in California, however it's now in Las Vegas in the town square center. 

This place was packed, sure the games were on and with a place having 160 beers on tap one could imagine it would be. This is their strong point, all their beers on tap and they have tastings of the different beers as well. 

Workers have good personality and the food is brought out quickly."}
{"text":"A little pricey but the food was good and the staff was very attentive. The atmosphere was nice and it's bigger than it looks from the outside. Will stop here again"}
{"text":"Food is exceptional, staff is always friendly. A little on the pricey side with a family of 5 but enjoy date night with my husband and dinner with friends because of the atmosphere. Great location and close to home."}
{"text":"Yes, it's a chain, but we decided to check it out since there aren't any locations in PA or NJ. Stopped here for a late dinner since it was close to our hotel. This place has a huge selection of draft beers. It's a great way to try new beers and included some beers we don't usually see offered back home. I was a fan of the two different Four Peaks beers I tried.

We arrived a few minutes before 10PM and took our server's advice to wait til then for the late night HH to start. Included in the HH were drink specials and selected 1/2 price appetizers. We ordered a bunch of things to split- hot & spicy edamame, turkey club, pepperoni & mushroom pizza (HH special), and boneless buffalo wings (HH special). The food was good, but pretty standard."}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service.  This was a great experience. The wait staff and management went above and beyond to make sure we were satisfied."}
{"text":"The food is really good. The price is also good as well. However it can be a bit noisy and because it is usually busy it can take some time to get your food if your there on the weekend. Overall a good place to eat though."}
{"text":"Service here is AMAZING and the staff is wonderful, the food is okay but since they are known for their alcohol It seems to be a little over priced. A dinner is about $15 to $25 per person for a meal and with a drink it adds about $10-$20 depending on how many drinks one wants to get. We waited about 40 minutes to get seated which was fine, but the food was average. It was filling and came pretty quick but there was not anything unique about It. The place is very spacious and there are a lot of options on the menu."}
{"text":"Today me and fiance took my mom and step-dad to Yard house today for lunch with our beautiful, perfect new baby girl.  We were at immediately, it wasn't too busy.  Me and my fiance had been here many a times, we always have a good experience.  Our waiter Adam was great.  He was funny, informative, and a great suggestive seller.  All of us where very impressed! I run restaurants and I would hire Adam in a hot second!  
I had the garlic noodles, as I always do and tomato bisque soup.  My safe go to meal.  On the table we also had a roast beef sandwich; my mom loved it.  Mac and cheesex2 which my fiance loves and gets from time to time.  The final dish was stacked chicken enchiladas, the looked great!! I was really impressed with the presentation.  There was also 2 bowls of clam chowder and 1 french onion soup on the table, everything was gone by the end of the meal!.  
Adam checked on us many times, made small talk and joked with us through out the meal.  He gets 5 stars.  I would give the whole thing 5 stars but the beer we ordered was flat, or it was at the end of the keg. Now not to brag but I know beer, its part of my job to know beer, even the beer tap systems. And it isn't the first time that has happened to me there.  Any-who; Adam did get us a different beer and it was fine.  We will be back, next time for happy hour, they have great deals!"}
{"text":"Had two meal at the Yard House.  This restaurant is connected to the Red Rock Hotel and Casino. We chose to eat there both times because they had TVs everywhere and the NFL playoffs were on.  

For lunch I had the Ahi Tuna sandwhich.  Actually the Tuna was delicious.  It was sushi grade tuna, perfectly seared on the outside and raw on the inside.  The problem is this...If all of the slippery things, like tomatoes, caramelized onions and aioli sauce are all touching each other on the sandwich, its gonna slide and fall apart.  That's exactly what happens with this sandwich.  After the first bite, the whole thing just slides apart.  It was absolutely delicious, but you don't want it to look like it has been in your stomach before you eat it.  And it is really messy for lunch when you have to go back to work meetings. 

Later on that night, I brought my wife back for dinner. We had to wait almost 45 minutes for a table.  It was REALLY busy...But we had a couple beers while we waited and watched football.  

For dinner I had the Porcini crusted halibut, Parmesan mashed potatoes, porcini cream sauce, white truffle oil, asparagus and bok choy.  The fish was SO overcooked that it was stiff.  The rest of the plate was ok, I guess, but when the protein isn't cooked well, the rest of the meal is a let down.  I think it's because the place is so busy.  The food tastes like the cooks are overwhelmed and can't keep up. It's not clear if it was fresh or frozen because it was so overcooked.  It was also a very small portion of fish and a ton of potatoes.

This place has the potential to be really good, but they need to straighten out some things back in the kitchen..."}
{"text":"Ok, I love this place. I know it's a chain, which isn't my general go to. Sadly, a lot of chains just have mediocre product. This is the only Yard House location that I've been to, & the food, drinks, & service are always good.  

The truffle fries are everything, & everyone must try them. I generally go for happy hour, & they've got some pretty good food at happy hour prices. So if you are in the area & like booze & food, definitely go to Yard House."}
{"text":"As always Yardhouse menu never fails. Poke nachos the bomb! And the rose garden is perfect with it. 16 people on Christmas night and they have fireplaces and warmers in a private setting for us. Thank you again! Jay was accommodating and attentive to all our requests! Thank you to all the staff!"}
{"text":"***Disclaimer - REALLY long review in regards to late night Happy Hour not being honored on St. Patrick's Day

Came to Yard House at Town Square to celebrate my birthday with my husband and I was very excited to order quite a bit of things on the menu, both food and drink.  However, I was VERY disappointed to find out that happy hour was not being honored.  My birthday is on St Patricks Day and the server informed me that there was no happy hour because it was a holiday.  I informed the server that it's not a national holiday and there happy hour policy on their menu does not state that holidays are not included.  We were not informed when we entered the restaurant that there was no happy hour.  We were also not informed when we were seated and our first orders were taken that there was no happy hour.  If my husband had not inquired if a certain beer was on the happy hour menu, I believe we would not have been informed that happy hour was not being honored.  

My evening was ruined because there was no happy hour.  I did not want to order as many items as I would have liked because there was no happy hour.  My husband did not want to cause a scene that evening so I did not ask for a manager that night.  

The food that we did order was good for the most part, but it wasn't great.  We ordered the spicy tuna and california roll.  The spicy tuna was good but the california roll's rice was hard and undercooked.  The hummus lacked flavor.  The only really good thing I ate was the jamaican jerk wings.  

The next day I called other Yard House's in Las Vegas and the one at Red Rock informed me that they honor happy hour on holidays, it just depended on which holiday.  They said it was at the manager's discretion.  They said that they had happy hour but only from 3 p.m. - 6 p.m. and not the late night happy hour.  I also called Blue Martini, McFaddens, and Buffalo Wild Wings who said they had happy hour on St. Patricks Day.  

I then called the Yard House at Town Square and asked to speak to a manager.  I spoke to Leo and he informed me that the policy for no happy hour came from corporate.  He informed me that customers were being informed at the door that there was no happy hour and I informed him that was not the case with us.  He explained there was nothing he could do for me because corporate sent that policy.  He informed me that no Yard House in the country had late night happy hour on St. Patrick's Day.  I asked him for the number to corporate and thanked the manager for his time.  

I then called four other Yard Houses in the country and three out of the four said they had happy hour both early and late, even though it was St. Patrick's Day.  I contacted corporate and left a message since it was after hours.  I waited 2 days but heard nothing back.  I called corporate again on Friday, March 21 and spoke to customer service who researched the information for me.  He was first unaware of the policy so he said he would contact the Yard House in Town Square and give me a call back.  After calling back he informed me that there may have been some miscommunication and that he was new and that is why he may not have heard of the happy hour policy for St. Patrick's Day.  He asked if the manager at Yard House did anything for me and I informed him that he did not.  In the end, he said he would do more research and send me some gift certificates in the mail.  

As of 3/28/14.  I have not received them but he did say they would take approximately 7-10 business days.

All in all, I was just very disappointed with the way they went about the happy hour policy.  They should have made a sign out front or placed a note on the menu, or trained ALL STAFF to inform EVERYONE before they were seated."}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday with some friends for a going away dinner. We decided to meet during happy hour  (4pm-6pm). Such a nice looking place; clean and well kept.
We got seated, drinks were ordered and then around 5:30pm we ordered food (Pizza and boneless wings on the happy hour menu). To our disadvantage, the kitchen was backed up. We started noticing that tables who arrived after us were receiving their food before us. Our waitress, Nancy, was very apologetic and doing her best to fix the problem.
After 45 mins, we asked to speak to the manager. Jose, the manager, came over and spoke with us. He apologized and explained that the kitchen was backed up and offered to cover the bill. Our food came out one by one but fresh and hot. ALL THE FOOD ENDED UP BEING ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!!! We really enjoyed all the flavor. We even decided to get dessert!
We enjoyed ourselves as we ate and enjoyed our last day together as a group. Our wonderful waitress came by frequently to check on us and refill our drinks. The manager also stopped by to check on us. 
Even though we had a dilemma with the timing of our food, the customer service was great. I would definitely still return. I can't believe I've been to town square so many times and never stopped here. I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"WTF? Feta Cheese on Guacamole?!?!! 
The Yardhouse needs to STOP messing with their menu. The guacamole we ordered came with feta cheese on top. This was not a mistake. Guacamole is a mix of subtle flavored and textures. This added ingredient is just plain wrong. 
The burger I ordered was fine, but without the BBQ or Garlic Aioli. Apparently the server thought that when I asked if the burger had mayo or other spreads, he took it upon himself to have no spreads on the burger. It arrived warm, not hot, likely from sitting in the AC cooled interior of the restaurant. 
As for libations, Angry Orchard is still on the menu. My favorite dunkels are gone and apparently never to return. 

The sad part about all this, is the state of this poor level of service is consistently prevalent across the chain. For the price of dinner, there are better options. I want it to be better but it just fails in being so anymore."}
{"text":"Well now that I've been there about a dozen times, I suppose I should write a review. Since there are so many already, I'll keep it short.

Only go there during happy hour. It's a ripoff the rest of the time. Get there early and get your fill of tasty beers and appetizers. This is an excellent choice before catching a concert next door. 

They have Rogue Hazelnut Brown and Chimay on tap, and 120+ more. Try the Hawaiian poke stack.

That is all."}
{"text":"I have dined 3 times. Every time it meal has been excellent. We always try something new. The flight of beers are fun too!!! 
My only complaint is that I HATE skinny fries. Only because I taste more grease than creamy potato. Also I think all Las Vegas restaurants should have a hangover combo meal. Electrolyte drink, salty GERD friendly app, entree and dessert! After all with an irritated stomach from rough partying you want a stomach friendly meal and you need salt and water to cure it. Greasy food and overly sauced food is not the answer!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We arrived around 8pm and it was busy, but there was only a 20 minute wait.  The restaurant is poorly lit, somewhat loud, and service was very slow.  I thought our food would never get to our table.  At one point, we thought our waitress had completely forgotten about us.  Once the food finally did arrive, it was very good.  It was my friend's birthday, and at the end of the night the waitress brought her a ice cream/brownie type dessert.  I'd go again, but probably not for dinner."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic lunch/dinner here during their Happy Hour.   We were immediately seated and greeted by our server Seth.    He was outstanding during our entire dining visit. We had a few questions about different menu items and he was very informative and helpful!  Plus he had a great quirky personality that makes him a great waiter!

Since it was Happy Hour, they have many 1/2 price appetizers and deals on drinks.  We decided to split the Chicken Nachos and Bearnaise Sliders.   This was a fantastic deal as our nachos ended up only being about 5.50 and the sliders were around 6.50.  The chicken nachos were delivered on a huge plate!  This plate alone would have actually been enough for both of our stomachs to be filled.  They had a great combination of ingredients with plenty of chicken spread throughout the nachos.  Fabulous! 

The sliders came out with 4 on the plate and a side of shoestring fries. I didn't see that fries were included so that was a bonus.  Plus I love shoestring style french fries.  Yum.  The sliders were just ok.  I almost wish we ordered the classic style sliders.  Yes I did love the bearnaise sauce that accompanied the sliders on the side but the burger itself was very plain.  It still enjoyed them.  

Their dining area itself is spacious and roomy.  There are plenty of seating inside and on their outdoor patio.  Everything was kept very clean and tidy! It doesn't hurt to see their keg room when you first walk in...  puts a smile on my husbands face!  It is a great place whether you are visiting or a local."}
{"text":"First time at any YH.   Before I start I was very hungry and thirsty so that might bias my review.  We had the california roll appetizer, Thai pizza and the wife had a sandwich.  I had 4 different 9oz beers to sample.  The roll was a modern twist but they pulled it off.  The waitress warned us first.  The pizza was one of the best I ever had , thin crispy crust and very fresh and flavorful.  The sandwich just seemed ok from the one bit I had.  The fries came out cold but the waitress took care of that no problem.
We enjoyed the place so much we went back for lunch the next day.  Both wait staff were very good.  Looking forward to trying a YH back in California."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this location! The happy hour deal on appetizers is really quite a good deal. Also try the desert trio... You could share or just keep it all for yourself! Take advantage of the outdoor seating in the nice weather."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of Yard House ever since it opened here at Town Square, especially during Happy Hour where we can take advantage of the special deals on appetizers and drinks. It's a great way to find out what we like so we can share suggestions when take our out town guests here for dinner. 

Dining here has always been pretty good as far as food and service goes. Except for my last visit here.  I had ordered Chicken Nachos appetizer and mistake on my part, I didn't realized it's served with Guacamole which I am highly allergic to and get real bad food reactions from it. I was going to work my way around the nacho plate but our server was really nice and said he would have it remade, no problem, only it would take a few minutes more.  

Few minutes later I had a dish of Chicken Nachos! Looked great and it did for the most part tasted pretty good. Only thing is it was the same plate of nachos with the one layer of guac just scraped off the plate.  There were still even traces of guac still left on the chips and smudges of guac on plate!  (see pic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yard-house-las-vegas?select=j_re5zvpe5Qh7zwBXkpMyg#j_re5zvpe5Qh7zwBXkpMyg  ) I didn't really want to have this plate taken back yet again. 

Needless to say I was really disappointed I didn't touch the plate after I saw there was still guacamole on it.  It's no fault of the server. Rest of our orders were pretty good.  But the cook line needs to know that food allergies should be taken seriously. Had I ate anything that even had a smidgen of guacamole, you would've had your guest knocked out on your table."}
{"text":"This place is a go to for us on a monthly or bi monthly basis, my family which is my parents, sister, husband love this place.  the menu accomdates to all of us, for my dad and husband they have a huge drink selection.  Being inside the red rock opens up a world of experiances such as bowling, movies, or a little gamglin before or after."}
{"text":"Service was pretty good, very friendly! However our server liked to adjust your order to her preference. For example, instead of a vodka soda with lemon and lime that I ordered she rang in for citron vodka on the rocks with a slash of soda (honestly, that is very different). The food was decent, what I expect from a chain. The pizza is good, the friend chicken was good. The vodka pasta with shrimp was awful. I also think as a new restaurant they are still figuring things out, lots of things were being delivered to the wrong tables, two of our food orders were wrong, so they went back to the kitchen, replacement food took so long that all of the rest of us were done eating. Great selection of beer!"}
{"text":"Let me preface this: I don't recommend visiting any  Yardhouse when it isn't happy hour. The entrees aren't worth it, and the beers are $8+ per pint. 

That being said, Yardhouse used to have a world-class happy hour. It was consistent in every location I've visited across the country, from Hawaii to New York. Great apps that were half price, and a phone-book's worth of beers to choose from that were also half off. Lady friends will also dig the half off martinis and cocktails. Solid.

However, as of late, the institution that is their happy hour has faltered. Ahi sashimi has gone from a generous fanned out steak to a pathetic strip diced into 6 pieces, maybe 1/3 of what you used to get. Same can be said for the downsizing of pizzas, nachos, calamari. Yes, you probably used to get more than what you paid for (which I made up for in doubling down on the still overpriced pints), but now, I feel like I'm being cheated by their bean counters. I wonder if they're weighing out happy hour portions to the gram in kitchen before the dish is plated...

The menu has changed, and is much easier to peruse. A few new apps, cocktails and dishes here and there. Still, after trying a few of their entrees over the years, I find that nothing really blows my skirt up here. Not really a great choice for dinner, since they try to do a bit of everything (American, Asian, Italian, etc.), and don't do anything exceptionally well. But, they also seem to be rotating more beers into the mix more regularly, as updated on the flat screens around the bar, which I appreciate.

All in all, a good place for a good happy hour. Not what it used to be (food wise), but still in the 97th percentile in my opinion."}
{"text":"Delicious! We were sat in 15 minutes, and our waiter came quickly. I had the Maui Pineapple Chicken. A bit pricey, but worth it. The presentation was out of the ordinary, in a good way - pineapple skewers, half a chicken splayed, and a bowl of fried rice. The menu had a wide variety of options. All of it was high quality, and we all inhaled our food. The atmosphere was great - clean, modern, dim but not dark, and spacious. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"I always have a great time at Yard House in both the Summerlin and Town Center locations.

Great Drink choices and a solid happy hour makes this a good spot to take friends visiting from out of town."}
{"text":"Brandica was an excellent waitress!!!! She was very friendly and had a lot of positive energy! One thing important, she kept a smile on her face. I hope the next time I stop by she is my server!!! (:"}
{"text":"It's a fun atmosphere & the food is filling & tasty. The environment is loud & lively. It's at Red Rock which is conveniently by our house. Portions are huge so come hungry!"}
{"text":"It's my favorite!  Coming from Ft. Collins, CO- capital of the microbrew, I can get just about anything I want here.  Service is wonderful, can't be half off appetizers and the kids menu is great AND entertaining!"}
{"text":"nice mall located at and the settings in there is cool!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and atmosphere. Sometimes, food in Arizona looks like the landscape - pretty beige. Yardhouse stands out with unique food (i.e. blueberry ketchup, what?!) and great service! I took my wife and myself out to dinner and was not disappointed. It is pretty pricey but it's located right in the middle of Westgate Entertainment District so that's to be expected. I'd give the place 4 stars but our server/host, Angel, made this place five stars! He went above and beyond to be accommodating to our very picky tastes and never seemed annoyed or distracted by it. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm always a fan of Yard house, great food and great service. Our server Matt was great and very attentive. We started off with beers; me with the Four Peaks Peach (always great) and my boyfriends tried two hefes. Although he did not like that, Matt was able to quickly change the order to exactly with my bf wanted. We got the spicy tuna roll (substituted with the ahi poke, as recommended by Matt) and the chicken nachos (amaaaazing & so much leftover). Great decisions by us! Also, Matt saw that it was our anniversary and brought us a complimentary dessert (the chocolate cake with ice cream) which was a great way to end the night. The food was amazing, but still can't beat the happy hour prices, which will probably lead us to come back on a weekday instead of a Sunday night. Great food, great service! Will be back!"}
{"text":"I had dinner here (on Wednesday 1/22/14) with a corporate work group of 25-30 and enjoyed our evening so much that I had to write up a review! I initially worked with an MOD named Udo who was super helpful when I swung in the evening before to ask if he could accommodate our group on such short notice. Fortunately enough, he was familiar with the company I was with and gladly showed us the tables that they normally give us when a large group dines together. The tables were all separated (but were next to each other), which ended up being ideal when we all got to know each other in smaller groups. 

Having worked in the industry for many years throughout college, I can't express how blessed we were to have received Chelsea as our server. Being the only individual in the group from Arizona, it was important to me that I show my new team the better spots around town and Chelsea totally owned the entire evening. She was friendly and had excellent menu knowledge for both food and drink and impressed the biggest of beers snobs in our group with the Four Peaks Odelay (great recommendation!) During the evening, Chelsea was always around to check on us even though we weren't her only tables and I was most impressed at how quickly she had all of our separate checks ready when the evening came to an end (corporate request for individual expense reports...annoying I know!). Chelsea made our evening flawless and my teammates absolutely loved the dinner selection! Having been so impressed, we all agreed that we would be back in a few months and YardHouse was where we will return! Having dined at another restaurant the evening before, it was a total 180-degree difference in the service and gratitude from the competing restaurant. I'm sure this location stays incredibly busy at the base of the stadiums but Chelsea single-handedly made 25 repeat customers that were eager to share their experiences the next day in our job-training! 

I'd be remised if I didn't also mention the MOD the evening we dined in. I'm spacing on his name but he was a young brunette guy who checked on us repeatedly and ensured our evening went as perfectly as possible! Thanks to both of these individuals and if this makes it to corporate, I hope some compensation is sent their way! Thank you!"}
{"text":"The rose garden beer is amazing here. 100% recommended! Interior is nice and tidy with lots of space. Almost no wait time."}
{"text":"Good enough for someone that is hungry and nearby but not a repeat or a place I would suggest to my friends. Wait staff was polite and helpful."}
{"text":"Saturday 8 PM.  Our Rock n Roll post race dinner at YARD House VEGAS.. After eating salad, noodles and whole wheat bagels for the the last 3 days, finally my cheat day has arrived.  A quick ten minute wait and was seated at a nice table next to the glass refrigerator that house over 126 beers."}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour menu.  Expect a wait for a table!  

Poke nachos were nom nom!  Nachos were delicious too!!"}
{"text":"Great service by our server Diana, she was helpful with all her suggestions and the rib eye is so good. Great beers!!!!!!! And the brownie is bomb!!!"}
{"text":"I like Yard House.  I've been to the Town Square location three times and each visit has been great.  The selection of beer is phenomenal.  I think our server told us they have over 300 to choose from.  Not being a beer drinker, I was equally impressed with their Cider selection.  The carried a Woodchuck Autumn blend which can be hard to find in specialty stores let alone a restaurant.  They also have many different wines and a full bar so no worries if you don't prefer beer.  The food has always been great.  On past occasions I've tried the fish tacos (yummy), Cobb salad (had a twist to your traditional Cobb with edamame beans and corn on it), and blackened salmon with a mango salsa (excellent flavor).  There can be a bit of a wait to sit outside but there's usually a spot or two at the bar where you can wait.  Usually don't have to wait more than 5-10 minutes even on a busy night.  Service has always been outstanding and prices are on par with what you'd spend at a trendy Microbrewery."}
{"text":"My first time at Yard House. I was promptly seated and ordered the Nachos. It was a huge serving and I was unable to finish it all. It was delicious. My friend ordered the crusted steak and absolutely loved it."}
{"text":"Angel was amazing! Such a fun experience with him!! Loved the quick service and interactive service. Thanks Angel!!!"}
{"text":"Great customer service from our server TIm on 9/30/2016. Laid back atmosphere great food at decent prices will definitely recommend for anyone who is a lover of beer and great food."}
{"text":"This ia absolutely the worst place to eat  in all of phoenix. And when i say the worst i mean i would rather walk into the desert barefooted in august and eat a handful of sand. Terrible service, below average ffid and hot beer. Never coming back."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been here until recently. Enjoyed happy hour with Blue crab cakes (2) on a bed of greens and special mango salsa sauce for half price of $6. A friend ordered wings for $5 and we shared the trio dessert for $9 - mini chocolate soufflé, mini lemon soufflé and mini peach apple cobbler with ice cream. That was the order of best to least-best. I need to come back here for the missed adult mac-n-cheese filled with chicken, bacon, mushrooms and other bits of stuff with a side of truffle oil. Mouthwatering just typing this. You know what means. Yes-time to go back there soon! 

Good for watching sports and good for group dinners and for beer lovers. All sorts to choose from."}
{"text":"Great food , drinks and service. 145 beers on draft. Staff friendly and accomidating!!"}
{"text":"If you love beer and bar food, you gotta love Yard House.  The beer selection (both on tap and by the bottle) is incredibly impressive, and the list of appetizers is almost as long (not really, but you get my point).

I like coming here, because there are loads of flat screen TVs hanging out throughout the restaurant tuned to all the different channels you'd want to watch at a bar, I never get bored with the menu, and the service is reliable.  The service isn't outstanding, but that's okay.

Last time I was here, I shared the chicken nachos and lettuce wraps with friends.  The chicken nachos were a little short on the chicken, the chips were just a little too soggy, but I'd probably still have them again because of the substantial size of the plate and the tasty guacamole.  The lettuce wraps were just right."}
{"text":"Love the efficiency  of this place. Went in around 6:30 and only had to wait 10 minutes to be seated. 

Ordered the fried calamari to start off with and fish & chips for my main. They have TONS of options on tap, but I didn't order anything. The fried calamari was fried perfectly which came with two types of dipping sauces: tartar and some red sauce (sorry I'm not sure what it was called). They also include slices of batter fried ginger so beware!! The fish & chips tasted great--had a nice kick to them--only complaint would be the batter is a bit thick so some parts can be doughy. They come with thin cut fries and two sauces as well. 

I would've given the place 4 stars, but the service is what makes it 5/5. There wasn't a single time my glass was empty. Despite how busy it was, the service was genuine. Justin, you rocked it!! Definitely will be back for Happy Hour $$."}
{"text":"Yard House has solid food and a great menu for large groups. There is plenty to choose for even the pickiest eater. They also have a great beer selection and televisions throughout the restaurant to catch a sporting event. We love the Red Rock location for grabbing a quick bite before a movie."}
{"text":"Always good, consistent service at Yard House. Whether I'm stopping by for a quick drink during happy hour (try the strawberry fields martini) or having a sit down dinner, I am always taken care of. Good food, good beer, good cocktails, great service. What more could I ask for?"}
{"text":"Yesterday was my second time at Yardhouse & I can say that my visit last night blew my first visit out of the water. Now, I did go during opening week, so they did have many training kinks to work out, hence why I decided to try them out again. 

The first time I went, I waited on for a good hour for a seat, which was very uncomfortable since there was no room at the bar & the lobby is very small. Many people were waiting for their table so we were very tight and close together. After being sat, it took a while for the server to arrive, drinks to be brought and food to arrive. But again, it was their opening week.

Last night, we walked right in during happy hour (which had great deals)! We were sat in a very comfortable open booth and our server, Tyler, arrived very quickly after. He went over the beer menu (130+) for my fiancé who is a beer lover! He ended up trying two of the house beers which he was very impressed with. And made sure I was enjoying my beer (I'm a very slow drinker when I eat), which not many servers check in to see if you are enjoying the drinks, just food. 

We started with the spinach cheese dip, which I was incredibly impressed by, the chips were not regular chips, they were amazing! I could have eaten that all night!

I tried the swordfish and baha fish tacos. WOW, the swordfish tacos were absolutely amazing. I'm not a huge taco fan, but I would order the swordfish tacos DAILY.

But honestly, what really made our experience a 5 star was not only the amazing food and drinks, but Tyler.  His customer service was amazing. Being a server myself, I get so happy when I receive amazing service. He was extremely attentive, making sure we enjoyed everything, offering suggestions, and overall making sure we had the best experience we could. I will be sure to ask to be in Tyler's section every time I dine at Yardhouse.

Thank you Tyler."}
{"text":"Not a fan of $9 beer nights, so Yard House is really only worth it for Happy Hour. But it is by far the best happy hour ever. Beers become reasonably priced from 3-6 and late at night, but the best part is the half price appetizers. Where else can you get 3 different kinds of awesome tuna for $6/plate? Or great pizzas for $6? Or top shelf martinis for $6? Decent value if you're a lush with good taste. $50 goes a long way here, but it's $50 minimum to have fun here.

Bartender that I always see there is very nice; service is great. 

The decor is boring, the clientele is often obnoxious douche nozzles and coming here for dinner is a pricey mistake (entrees are meh), but 150,000 beers on tap can drown out any shortcomings."}
{"text":"Anchor Steam beer on tap!! The service was great and the BBQ chicken salad I ordered was pretty good and surprisingly filling. Patio seating was perfect for the weather that day and I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Not as big as other locations, and waiting area is pretty small, but the quality of food and service is same if not better. 

I ordered calamari and my gf got the truffle burger. Both were delicious and I loved the presentation on the black truffle burger. Drinks aren't that cheap, but its fun location. 

If you want and like Yardhouse food/drinks then definitely stop by."}
{"text":"All I ordered was iced tea. Bill came to $3.19 which included tax. Gave the waiter $4. He didn't bring me my change. So I guess all he wanted was .81 for a tip.  A simple cocktai/mixed drinkl is $9.75."}
{"text":"We ate here because I wasn't sure where else I could eat gluten free on the strip! I really appreciate the gluten free menu, thanks yard house! However the gluten free menu is pretty small, I got the chicken sandwich as a lettuce wrap and they let me sub veggies for the fries. I wish they offered gf buns. The steamed veggies didn't seem steamed at all, they were very crunchy and almost raw...not flavorful, didn't seem fresh at all.
I did enjoy my cocktail jingerber something...it was strawberry and cucumber infused gin! On point
The restaurant is very dark and loud and our booth was so big we couldn't really talk to the people across from us. Our waitress was good but service was on the slow side, had to wait along time for our check.
Overall this is definitely a good place for a drink but I would try somewhere else for dinner."}
{"text":"The menu is complex. Some items are a little too extreme in their takes on how the food should be served: example is the sushi - be warned!

A bit pricey for the quality food and service. Large restaurant though with plenty of seating and tvs"}
{"text":"The service was good, but my son's spaghetti was burnt and the French fries didn't come until we where done eating. We went with a group of people and there wasn't enough room for a highchair, it was very  cramped and uncomfortable I didn't enjoy my food."}
{"text":"Great food, Mac and cheese x2 is for real. Went there for lunch yesterday. They have a very good lunch menu"}
{"text":"This Yard House is located inside Red Rock Casino (my favorite casino). Good food, great atmosphere and the service is always amazing. It's fancy enough to celebrate special occasions but also laid back enough to just hang out with friends/coworkers after work. Lots of TVs and loud tunes playing in the background. You can walk in and grab a seat at the bar or wait to be seated. They offer inside or outside patio. I actually prefer the patio to dine al fresco. It's quite comfortable, they come prepared with heat lamps or misters depending on the season. 

They're well known for their excellent beer selection (you'll see all the kegs as you walk in) and if you're brave enough try \"The Yard\". Not to mention the Martinis! I live for these! Try the Strawberry Fields and thank me later! HH menu has a great selection too. What to expect: burgers, pizza, wings, pasta...the typical american fare. But there's also the unexpeced items which I especially like. For instance, the mushroom lettuce wraps and jambalaya. Mmmm. This is one chain restaurant that shouldn't be overlooked."}
{"text":"I love coming here. When ever my wife says we are going to yard house I get so happy. I love all the beers on tap, and the sampler which rotates every Tuesday is a nice starting point. I get the same feeling of getting to go to chuck e cheese as a kid when I go here. 

I love yard house."}
{"text":"I've never been there before and I really had a great experience with the server the hostess it's not so much I called before I drove out they told me a 5 to 10 minute wait when I got there they said it 10 to 15 minute wait and I ended up waiting for almost 45 minutesdefinitely a super ridiculous but the food was good"}
{"text":"I came here for the my 3rd time with high expectations. I was hungry and came to eat. It did.m not disappoint. We have the Spicy Tuna Roll as an appetizer and it was good but not as good as the Californian roll I had eaten on other visits. I ordered the Lobster Noodles and an A La Carte Vampire Taco. The Vampire Taco lit up my world. My Lobster Noodles were so good I couldn't decide if I liked the noodles better or the shrimp and lobster. Absolutely wonderful meal. The only negative review is that the waitress was a little slow"}
{"text":"I love this place the food is great and so are the drinks.
Fun place to do a party... I wish we had one in California"}
{"text":"The food was awful and the service even worse. With so many places to choose from in Las Vegas, this restaurant should not even be in consideration!"}
{"text":"Love this place great food love the devil eggs also great beer selection. Love it being in town square great place to hang with friends or take the wife for a fun night."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place! Great, knowledgeable staff and I LOVE LOVE LOVE their drinks and appetizers are wonderful! Onion Ring tower and the egg rolls! All their drinks are yummy! Their margaritas and martinis! I go here all the time to just hang out and have some fun! It's in a great location as well. Lots to do around here, see a movie, play games at Dave and Busters! All around this is my favorite place to go have a drink. I talk about the Yard House all the time. I always recommend this place for friends and family. I even took all my family here after my husband and I got married! It was so much fun! All we had was a ton of appetizers and drinks lol :D that's all I ever get, but it's a real chill place. The staff is so nice as well. This place gets busy and usually that's a huge turn off to me but they always are super fast!! I can't say this enough.. I absolutely LOVE this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Whilst in Vegas recently, we overheard a conversation regarding where you could get craft beer in the strip. The recommendation was to try Yardhouse, recently opened but with a great selection. 
We certainly weren't disappointed when seated at the bar, able to observe the many many draught taps and presented with the fat menu containing the details of that vast selection. 
We started by selecting something we hadn't tried before and applied that selection criteria a few more times. The staff member who attended to us was knowledgable and let me try samples before committing to a decision as to what would be my next glass.
We only had some basic chips but the food being brought out to other patrons around looked good. 
Would definitely recommend you check this place if you like craft beer!"}
{"text":"It's a restaurant chain, but damn do they do well at it despite having a large menu. You might go, \"But how can a restaurant chain have fresh food?\" Well yes there's certainly an extent to how good it can be. But as far as chain stores go, it's as good as it gets.

Their menu selection is huge, you have a selection of American/Asian choices to choose from. So a burger, pizza or edamame and sushi is possible. 

And the beers... So many beers on tap to choose from! At this Yard House, there are two entrances, so if you enter from the back entrance facing the parking lot, you'll walk by so many different beer vats behind the glass facing the kitchen.

As far as what I ordered, I ordered a half pizza half french onion soup. I liked it. Also got the house IPA which I thought was ok, but then again I only crave IPA's maybe once or twice a year.

Would return!"}
{"text":"The waitress was pleasant. Decor was nice. Pretty cool ceilings with beer floating over head. The food just wasn't that great. We went for happy hour and ordered a pizza, chicken nachos, chicken wings, and spinach dip. The pizza crust was similar to a cracker and it had no sauce on it. The nachos weren't hot when served as if they had been sitting around for awhile. Chicken wings were good but a little on the spicy side. The dip was by far the best thing we ordered. Served with large pita chips. Overall, I probably wouldn't go back for the food. Beer maybe."}
{"text":"Sucky food for the cost, it's a nice location but I don't drink so what's the point of coming here?"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, beer and food. Probably one of my favorite places in Vegas! I come here twice a month at least!"}
{"text":"Being so close to my house, I have dined here a few times now. Have yet to have a disappointing meal. 4 to 5 stars for the food. 

Another 4-5 stars for the venue and bar. With so many handles this is a beer drinkers paradise. 

1-2 stars for service. On average we have waited no sooner than 1.5 hrs for a table. They get real crowded around happy hour and the congestion can get annoying. Yardhouse is not bad for a chain resteraunt."}
{"text":"I love this place.  So many different beers on tap.  I want to try them all.  The food is delicious.  Great place.  Inside and outside seating.  My favorite Restaurant/Bar at Westgate. Have been going there since they opened it and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with our visit to Yard House yesterday. The dinners my wife and I choose were horrible. Not once did our waiter come back to the table to ask how our meal was, when he did finally come over the only thing that was finished was the beer and the coke my wife drank. He FINALLY asked how our meal was, he was met with a \"NOT GOOD\", he glossed right over what we said and asked if we wanted to box up our food. You mean the food we barely touched? The ribs were tough and had no taste, and the crusted chicken my wife had a bad taste also. No questions about how was the meal, is there anything else I can get you? Nope, we got the standard \" would you like desert question\", he could care less how our meal was. We fortunately found another eating establishment at Westgate later that we enjoyed the meal we paid for."}
{"text":"2nd time there both with a big group. Cool place, huge selection of beers, but the food is only so-so. Asada taco was tasty, but both carnitas and chorizo tacos were bad."}
{"text":"They changed the Mac and cheese recipe and now it taste terrible. It used to be my favorite thing here, so it's extremely disappointing to see this. Edit: They apologized and offered me a gift card, so they do seem to care."}
{"text":"We waited for an outside table when we got sat we had the door hitting one of our chairs. Asked to be move they did. Food and atmosphere really good."}
{"text":"This is probably the best restaurant at town square in $$ range for food and drinks. I love going to this place, because its located right across from the movie theater. My friends and I usually go here for a movie and dinner night. Food is amazing at this location.

 I am a big fan of chicken nahos, its just loaded with chicken, guac, beans, etc. Its a great starter for a big group. Hungry folks will devour it immediately. If you are going there with just another person, than don't get it. Its too big for both, and you can't take it home cause it will get soggy. My favorite are their ahi sliders. They are just delicious. The fish is fresh and its hint of citrus. Its a must have for anyone who's trying to eat healthy.   

They also have awesome beer selection, it could be bit more pricy than other local places, but the variety negates the higher price on beers. 

Overall, if you are hungry and if you are anywhere near town square than go here. On weekends, if does get really busy so if you have a big party than you might end up waiting for 15-30 minutes. I am not sure if you can reserve ahead of time."}
{"text":"Food was awesome! The manager Hope was super friendly and helpful. We love Yard House and have visited several locations. They never disappoint!"}
{"text":"Came here with a large group of 6 adults and 5 kids.  Have to say that the 5 stars is mostly for the service we received from Rachel.  She was very attentive and met all of our needs in a most friendly and pleasant way.  I know sometimes large groups like ours can be a pain with all kinds of requests but she handled them with grace.  We enjoyed our meal & I can speak for my Nashville hot chicken dish that it was cooked well but flavor wise I have had better Nashville hot chicken but that's because I have had the genuine dish when in music city several times."}
{"text":"I love Yard House! I really appreciate how the servers, seaters, and the rest of the staff have a natural groove as they work together. The food is great, but I prefer to dine during happy hour to save some clams. The calamari is great, served with a tasty jalapeno tartar sauce. The margherita pizza is thin, crispy, and delicious. And boy, can they whip up a salad! I adore the mixed greens salad. The cucumber berry soda is tasty, and I'm told the Irish coffee is just right. It's a great spot to walk off your meal after you eat, right in the heart of Desert Ridge Marketplace. Happy hour is 1500-1800, and 2200 to close."}
{"text":"Get the Mac and cheese squared. You won't be disappointed. Foods great, ton of beers on tap."}
{"text":"Great place to catch some happy hour action in the summerlin area. Tons of beers on tap and appetizers for days! Also the staff is friendly"}
{"text":"Bad day for Yard House: 
I found a hair on/in my moo shu egg rolls. It was the second egg roll, but it was right at the top at bite level. It was curly and very nasty. If my GF wasn't there, I would have made more a scene, but instead I got the usual apologies, etc and it was wiped off the bill. During HH, all appetizers are half price, so they probably could have just let me go without a bill for that disgusting hairy egg roll.

The chicken tenders were not much better minus the hair. They appeared crunchy, but after biting into them, they were soft and mushy and I actually spit out the first bite due to excessive fat. The hostess was too perky as well and they don't have the Pac 12 channel either. This was an hour I won't get back."}
{"text":"Really good restaurant at the end of The LINQ outdoor entertainment district right next to the High Roller wheel.   While a chain restaurant, it's obvious the food is made fresh on site.

I went with the Ahi Tuna Salad and the deviled eggs.   Deviled eggs only because I was amused to see them on a restaurant menu and they were delicious.  The Ahi Tuna salad featured perfectly prepared rare tuna slices.  Excellent and the portion was just perfect.  I was able to get up and walk around the rest of The LINQ and enjoy myself.  I also went with their berry flavored green tea and it was excellent.

All in all a great spot to have lunch or dinner.  Good spot for vegetarians as well."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place because of the great rating but it has fallen short on two occasions. The first trip was on a Monday night just to have a drink as we explored the area. The beer is priced like you would expect inside a major sports arena. In other words, very expensive. 

The second trip was to try the food. I ordered the chicken rice bowl and honestly, I've had better microwave meals. The majority of the rice was very undercooked and hard as a rock. The flavors were bland at best. 

I could forgive both the expensive beer and poor food quality if the service was exceptional but that is not the case either. While not the worst service I have ever had, I would expect much more based on the cost tier of this place. My entire group would wait for extended periods for drinks and trips to the table to see if everything was ok were nonexistent. 

The location is great but I can't honestly recommend this place to anyone. There are just too many bars and restaurants in the area to make this one of your stops."}
{"text":"This was the first restaurant I ate at in Arizona. They have a ton of beers on tap and serve yards of beer (for your inner drunk ). I had the chicken Caesar and the deviled eggs. Both were excellent. An associate had a steak and said it was cooked perfectly. It has now become a lunch spot to take customers."}
{"text":"I always love Yardhouse and the countless beers on tap and the mixed drinks. This location is great for retirements, drinks with friends and co-workers."}
{"text":"Obviously a wide selection of beers, our bartender paid attention to us and constantly checked in. For being a busy place they definitely did not neglect me :)"}
{"text":"I walked in to place a to-go order and was told it would be 25 min. I ended up waiting 50 minutes. However, the food is delicious and I appreciate the way they pack to-go orders to make sure crispy items stay crispy."}
{"text":"Over 100 beers on tap, food menu is surprisingly good for a place I typically associate only with beer.  Can do large groups.  
32-oz half-yard glasses are a fun way to potentially pour beer all over yourself.

Count on spending at least $30/person after tax/tip..."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a lunch or dinner spot in the Fashion Square mall, Yard House is a great choice and has a huge menu. I've been here about 3 or 4 times in the past couple of years and have always had a good experience. Most recently I visited with my mom before seeing a movie. She ordered the pepper-crusted filet mignon and I ordered the halibut. The filet was delicious and perfectly cooked, and the halibut was very fresh tasting and the parmesan potatoes and bok choy paired well with it. Our server was also very attentive and friendly and was great about refilling my water & iced green tea. (Let's just say some people are just not made for this AZ dry climate, and sadly I am one of them ... I'm *constantly* thirsty so I always appreciate the frequent refills!)"}
{"text":"My colleague and I came here for dinner because it was across the street from our hotel.  We were amazed to discover that not only did they have over 120 beers on tap, but that it was happy hour all night.  Our server, Katelyn, was very knowledgeable about the beers and gave us recommendations as well as samples of a few.  I ended up going with the Breckenridge porter which was delicious.  Our food came out quickly and was great as well, and there were plenty of tvs playing football and hockey.  Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"If you're a vegetarian, there are just some places you shouldn't go... Sausage factory.  Pig roast.  Republican National Convention.  However, Yard House does not make this list.  They delight a with a vast plethora of vegetarian selections that a responsible and eco-conscious mortal consumer such as myself could enjoy.  Our waitress, Caitlin, was prompt and had amazing posture.  She approached the table with an indigo aura, describing the menu the way an author describes a sunset.  I could tell we had made a sisterhood-style connection when she informed me that a vegetarian item I had elected was still fried in the same oil as animal \"products.\"  Namaste, Caitlin.  Out of the corner of your eye, the hipster art shifts emotions on a subtle yet significant level.  I would only ask that the artist employ more cerulean shades in future works.  Quite pleased."}
{"text":"There are a few cant miss items here: the carnitas enchilada stacks, the fried chicken, and the beer. I've never had a bad experience and they always deliver good food."}
{"text":"I went to Yardhouse at Scottsdale Fashion Square with my boyfriend on a date. We had a bad experience. The server we had gave us attitude and whenever we had a question about the food, she seemed annoyed and irritated that we would take up her time to ask such a thing. The food was not good for the prices they charge. We have been there before and the food was better, but this particular night, it was not good at all. Very hit or miss with the food and the serving staff is not welcoming and friendly."}
{"text":"While the new Yard House location at Red Rock has a great location, super comfortable patio even in the summer, and the same menu as all the other locations, it was still a disappointment. My Boyfriend and I were there last weekend and unfortunately the selection of staff doesn't seem to have been done with the same amount of care and discretion as it was in other locations throughout the valley. 

We were quoted a 45 minute wait time, and went to the bar for our first beer. They didn't have what I ordered, but the bartender didn't seem to know of any similar options (even though there are 3 or 4 on the menu). We were sat in about 15-20 minutes (one star earned there) and so took a few minutes to finish beer #1 and decide on #2. I decided to venture out of the normal and try one of the Yard House blends. When I asked our server about a specific option, she replied \"Oh, I don't know, I don't drink beer.\" Then proceeded to go on and on about how it has too many calories and makes you fat. So  A) Thanks, you're calling me and my boyfriend (we're both pretty in shape people) fat cows for wanting to enjoy a tasty beverage? B) You work in a restaurant that specializes in a certain product, and you don't know ANYTHING about it? At least fake it till you make it next time, OK?

What I ended up ordering wasn't at ALL what I was expecting and basically tasted like strawberry juice (since I obviously didn't get any information on it from our server) and I was pretty disappointed with it. When the manager came by to check on our table, I asked for a sample size of the less sweet part of the blend, to try to make it more bearable. She begrudgingly complied, brought it back 10 minutes later and then never came back to make sure it was satisfactory. Not HORRIBLE behavior, but a good manager would have been a little more attentive. 

The food was about the same as the Town Square location, but since the service was not even close to comparable, I would definitely not make this one a first choice again."}
{"text":"I love the Korean BBQ ribs and nachos. The beer selection is second to none. Customer service is hit or miss. Music can be deafening at times around the bar area. Good vibe overall."}
{"text":"Love this place! Awesome beers on tap, and love the service. Best part of service is they are very good at recommending beer! I love going to places that the servers actually know what they are talking about. Go there for happy hour, the food is bomb and the beer is even better!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise!  Great beers and tasty food.  A ton of veggie options too!
Kung Pao Calamari is amazing.  Truffle Fries too!  Don't miss the Hawaiian Poke Stack either."}
{"text":"I'm sort of hanging my head in shame writing this review because I'm normally very vocal and blunt about my hatred of chain restaurants. However, my heart swells with joy when I think about all the vegetarian options available at Yard House. 

I wish more restaurants would follow suit and use meat analogues like Gardein or Quorn. It's so refreshing to have a large selection to choose from instead of a veggie burger or portobello sandwich. I'm at a bar; I want buffalo wings, dammit!

Thankfully, their awesome veggie buffalo wings are on the happy hour menu. My sister and I split an order, we each got two drinks, and our bill was only $26!

When you're organizing a large group, it's hard to find a place that will please everyone. Many of my acquaintances are fearful of ethnic food and/or independent restaurants so often I have to surrender and eat at a boring chain restaurant. Now Yard House will always be my first choice."}
{"text":"Our salad was taste really good, but I would have rather they use romain lettuce. Regular margarita didn't taste like a margarita,but it still tatsed alright and packed a nice little punch with just one."}
{"text":"When to dinner here last night. Shaun was a amazing server (he should be giving lessons on excellent service to a lot of other servers in this town) his recommendations for food a beer pairings were spot on ... The food was delicious.... Thank you for an excellent evening...."}
{"text":"Are you a beer lover? And I don't mean bud light. I mean do you truly enjoy trying new and exciting beers?! If you do, then this tap system will blow your mind like it did mine. I am an IPA lover and always get a new IPA when I am here! If the alcohol content in your beer isn't too high, you can get a half yard beer! Oh yes!!! This is the beer tap system that excites us who truly love beer! The food being delicious is just a bonus!"}
{"text":"Awesome staff, awesome beers. Food and drinks are a little pricey but thats what you have to pay for for selection."}
{"text":"I've gone to this location a few times and it's a hit or miss really. Definitely a great selection of beer, but the food is tricky. I went here with a friend and my boyfriend and we loved the sliders and the sweet potato fries. The few times I got burgers they were pretty good; no real complaints about the burgers. But I wanted to try something new (big mistake) so I decided to order the Ahi Tuna Crispy Salad (something along those lines). Our server was great, which made not enjoying the food kind of a flop. 

When I received the salad, the tuna was sliced into maybe 1/4 inch pieces and the edges of each piece was covered in pepper. I do not like a whole bunch of pepper so that was a big disappointment for me. Also, they saturated the salad in salad dressing. I had to send it back because it made it very difficult to each and extremely unappetizing. I tried to enjoy it after they fixed the drenching of the salad and put the dressing on the side, but it was still difficult to enjoy the food. I was highly considering asking them to change the salad into the sliders but I  didn't want to wait even longer to get my food because we waited a while to get my salad and my friend's burger. I was very disappointed and would not recommend getting that salad. I almost did not want to pay for the food because I felt that I did not enjoy the food and I wasted the tuna :("}
{"text":"Best happy hour ever!

Practically all day happy hour on Mondays for Monday Night Football. But on a normal basis, happy hour is effective from 3:00 PM - 6:00 PM M(maybe Sunday included)-TH, and 10:00 PM - Close Sun - Wed.

Half off select appetizers which consists of most appetizers. My personal favorite is the Chicken lettuce wraps.

Bernaise Sliders for the win as well. Most if not all sliders are $6.95 during happy hour. Pizza is half off as well.

Yard House is a dim-lighted atmosphere consisting of great service from all servers. 

I don't normally order my alcohol from here because I prefer to fulfill my satisfaction with food rather than liquor but they have a huge selection of beer and discounted happy hour prices for most liquor as well.

Be warned though, this is not the place to come to if you're on a diet. I feel that they put tons of salt and sodium in all their food. Which is probably why I'm always in a food coma when I leave this joint. But if you're all about happy hour and binge eating, then swing on by!"}
{"text":"This has always seemed to be a local favorite, with many locations around town I often eat at the location in town square. The menu is huge with many comfort and healthy options. They also have a huge variety of beer on tap. I like the chicken teriyaki bowl and the Mac and cheese is excellent also. You can't go wrong at yard house and I will be making many more visits in the near future."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place, great food and great service.  Lobster Burger is my favorite."}
{"text":"Perfect service, perfect truffle cheese burger cooked perfectly, great beer. They knocked it out of the park with this visit everyone was rocking and it was busy."}
{"text":"Food is good, great menu. Beer selection is excellent. Bar service is very good.
Don't go there to watch the NFL...plenty of screens, but not enough dvrs to show all the games. When the manager was asked to change any one particular game...especially considering at least 3 blowouts, he was more than a bit of a dweeb about it, and gave the \"I don't make the rules defense.\"  If the manager doesn't make the rules then...
Nice enough place, just lacking customer-focused leaderdhip."}
{"text":"I'm torn writing this review. I worked at Yard house in Roseville, CA for almost 3 years, so I am VERY found of the food and atmosphere. I think this is the reason this visit was so disappointing. 
Front desk was prompt in greeting is and getting us seated in a booth near the window. We placed our order which arrived fairly quickly. 
Our server was not the most attentive or friendly. Didn't try to engage in any kind of conversation and rarely stopped by the table. The food was mediocre, I got the turkey club which was good but the fries were cold. Actually, we got 3 entrees that came with fries and the fries were cold on ALL of them. Including the fish & chips. Extremely disappointing, nothing worse than chewy cold fries :( 
Super bummed about this visit, especially since I haven't had YH since leaving my home store 6 months ago!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Every single time we've gone the food and service are excellent. Ended up there during weekday happy hour (4-6) and decided to order 1/2 price appetizers--OMG. The portions were huge and the food was dynamite. The Garlic noodles and egg rolls are the best! Only small disappointment--the BBQ pizza was just okay. Also had chicken soup, crab cakes and chicken lettuce wraps on the table-all were reported as delicious."}
{"text":"I still fail to see the Appeal of Yard House...
Good idea; poorly executed 

Not to cut and paste my review of the Town Square location, but they are really no different. This location just seems to have worse service; numerous errors, long waits for items, unapologetically uncaring servers...

Wrong items, spilled beers, check errors with a long wait to have corrected...

So...
They have a lot of beer. Otherwise, it's pretty much Chilis or Applebees... with lots of beer. Yard House is a beer bar for the non-creative.

The list is impressive. They have some neat stuff and the 6 pack samplers change regularly. The food is good, but I can't tell if it's microwaved, so that's almost as bad as being microwaved.

A mix list provides clever names for the combos you already know and love. The servers are generally pleasant and helpful and have, at the very least, remembered the scripts for various beer questions that may arise.

It is good, not for everyone, but sometime for me.

If you are in the area to kill time, stop in, have 2 beers and see how you feel about the atmosphere and the selection."}
{"text":"Ordered the vampire tacos because many customers had not only given them great reviews, but I saw photos of them by customers and they looked amazing. Mine were not. They were tiny Taco Bell sized things. Taste was all right. Fish tacos were so bland. My partners food was bland too. Food was not worth the expensive prices, can get better for cheaper elsewhere. 

I was especially disappointed in the atmosphere. I expected a bar with adults, but it was more chucky cheese! Kids and strollers. I know they can't help it and families should be allowed anywhere, but I didn't think babies would be such a big draw. Kids were blocking the wait staff and no one even tried to do anything. Toddlers running around, screaming. Not for me."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a great setting and a very interesting menu, the wine list is top notch. The Mac and cheese squared is worth a try, however, I was disappointed with the lobster garlic noodles. This dish has such potential to be savory and to bring out some great flavors in the lobster, crab, and shrimp that comes on it, but the seafood was not quite fresh enough, and was \"slapped on,\" rather than cooked as part of the dish.  The herbs were much the same, just tossed on. The seafood should be cooked with the sauce to infuse that garlic herb flavor."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong at Yard House.  The food is consistent no matter which location you dine at.  Ordered fried calamari, ahi sashimi, and onion rings tower as appetizers and the onion rings were beyond delicious.  Of all the items to rave about, the onion rings were light and crunchy.  The spicy jambalaya was seasoned perfectly.  The only complaint about the place is the lack of light. It was quite dark and hard to read the menu."}
{"text":"Love coming here for late night happy hour! Always get their  nachos or pizza for a good price.  Also love their extensive vegetarian menu."}
{"text":"This is our go-to Yard House!!.. this location is the most non-chain of chain restaurants!! Of course, with an amazing selection of food options and craft beer and cocktails, I'm amazed how they do it!! All management and staff are beyond accommodating!!. Shout out to manager, Ali(sson, , Marcos and Tiffanie at the bar loving the Tuna Roll, BBQ chicken pizza and chicken lettuce wraps as appetizer staples.. delish food, 5-diamond service and ahhhmazing craft!!.. assumptions aside, get down to this locale!!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to late night reverse happy hour location!! Awesome menu, usual great service, and great happy hour prices!

This town square location my usual spot. I will on occasion go to the red rock location if I'm in that area. But town square is the go to. 

Every time I come, it's usually always busy. Meaning I've never come on an empty night. Still receive great service and seated within an acceptable amount of time. There are great for large parties! ***side note: if you have a large party, be patient with them some servers look and act annoyed** I've come in with a party over 30 and they always accommodate us. (We come after we  perform in shows) 

Like I said I love the reverse happy hour menu so honestly that's the only things I've ever tried... And their dessert! Yummy! My absolute favorite is the Garlic Chicken Noodle!!! I see it more as a meal than an appetizer! Lo mein type noodles with chicken chunks accompanied by garlic flavor, edamame seeds, Parmesan cheese toppings, shiitake mushrooms, chunks of tofu, and sliced asparagus!!! Who wouldn't love that?! It's absolutely delicious and just the right amount of garlic flavor. 

All of their happy hour appetizers are a must try. Their half off pizzas are delicious, and my other favorite go to meal is the Ahi-poke Stack. Perfectly lightly wasabi coated ahi tuna chunks stacked on wonton wafers accompanied with carrot and radish slices all lightly coated in the soy and wasabi ginger sauce with slices of fresh avocado on the side!!  

When I order just the chicken garlic noodles and the poke stack during happy hour, with tip and tax included I walk out paying $15. Can't beat that!!! 

Not to mention to amazing beer selection they have available!! Pear Cider is my go to! 

Try everything on their appetizer menu! I promise they do not disappoint"}
{"text":"Cole, our server was amazing, and gave us extra hummus and pitas as we just ate them up quick. I had the Cuban. Not too hot about this sandwich. Wish I could taste more garlic flavor as promised in the description. Their honey mustard, is maple mustard. Different, yes, but not the same. Expensive. Will come during happy hour next time for reduced price apps."}
{"text":"They have an outstanding selection of beers and very good food! 
Service is good but feels almost high pressure at times. 
Good spot to go to overall though, very nice building as well with a good atmosphere."}
{"text":"When the Rock and Roll Marathon is in town, everything is going to be a little crazier. Service can be slower, food isn't quite right, the servers are a little less patient, etc. I get it.

Apparently, the YardHouse at the Linq did NOT get that message at all, because their service was straight up Five Star all weekend long. We had 20+ people coming and going from our corner booth, and our servers were calm, in control, and perfectly fine handling our madness.

George. What can I say? An absolute ace. So nice, so friendly, and so easy no matter how many table line-up changes we had.

Connor. Ali. Jason. And a lovely lady whose name escapes me and I'm so sorry! But you all were absolutely wonderful.

Thanks from the Fat To Finish Line Documentary cast, crew, and supporters. You made us all feel like we stars."}
{"text":"Service was good, food was okay, but the short Caucasian manager was an a**hole. Very rude and stuck up. Never had any issues at the town square yard house"}
{"text":"A group of us were in Vegas for a conference and we chose this place for happy hour our last night there. I wish we had gone there earlier in the week. They have a fantastic happy hour menu with full portions at happy hour prices. The staff was very friendly and fun. The entire atmosphere was just great. Definitely a place to hit while you're in town."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon the YardHouse last week. 
We were attempting to find a suitable (acceptable to all) dining place for a late-night meal, having not had dinner. 

The food options are varied- there is something on the menu for everyone, and the beer/cider/wine listing is one of the most extensive I've seen. One can try two beverage samples before ordering. Most importantly, given the touristy nature of the area, prices are reasonable.

I chose a turkey burger with a tangerine wheat brew. One friend ordered a small pasta dish-  but their \"small\" portion is not all that small. In my humble opinion, the food here is better than at most casual dining chains. 
Service was very good but I am deducting one star because we were not advised that sweet potato fries incur a $1 surcharge (we were only told that onion rings are $2 additional).

My friends stayed in Vegas longer than I and they returned to YardHouse for a seond meal. Would I return? Yes.
Will I attempt to find a YardHouse when I visit other touristy areas (hello Orlando...)?...Absolutely."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Yard House particularly their Los Angeles DTLA location.  This one at the LINQ was a missed during our afternoon visit.  I believe all of our food with my buddies was a missed too.  Maybe they were just having an off day.  My pastrami was a bit too dry and my bread was well.... couldn't really make of it.  While service was wonderful, the food was a bit of a letdown for us.  I would give them another try however, perhaps when I get back to Las Vegas for my next business event this year.

Until then, be kind to one another and Cheers! ~ :p"}
{"text":"If u advertise a dish as a house speciality u really shouldn't mess it up. Parmesan crusted Chk was really really really dry!!!! Like Chk jerky the sauce was good but the Chk would have to sit for several hours in the sauce to soften the Chk. My husbands sandwich was good corn beef hash but cold fries he asked for different fries but they never arrived. Disappointed"}
{"text":"I love Yard House! They have a great menu selection.  My favorites are the organic tomato soup with grilled cheese and the pork belly tacos.  Friendly staff and great outdoor dining."}
{"text":"After golf with my husband on our anniversary we went to yard house for a bite. The hostess ask if were just playing tennis and we said golf for our anniversary.  I ordered the Cobb with salmon \"amazing\" and my husband loves the bbq salad. We didn't know The hostess told our waitress kristyn about our anniversary and she took the initiative to surprise us with dessert plates. She even got the desserts correct chocolate for him and fruit for me."}
{"text":"Service was extremely good and courteous ! Food was upto d mark (except orange chicken, too sour for my taste) . We got these amazing seats which has view of light show from high roller and we loved it . One start less cz of longggggggg waiting period !"}
{"text":"My family and I are regular customers and always ask to be put in our favorite server's section.  Steven always takes care of us.  My five year old little girl loves him.  He remembers us and goes out of his way to make us (especially my daughter) feel special.  He checks in often, remembers our favorites, gives prompt service, we cannot say enough good things about him.  We went to lunch yesterday and were excited to see he was working and we got to sit in his section.  I have no idea what was goo on but shortly after we were seated and had our drinks delivered Steven was literally fired right at our table!  We sat there in shock, my daughter got upset because she didn't know what was going on, and we decided to leave after seeing that.  We cannot support an establishment that treats their staff that way!  There is no reason Steven should have been told \"Get off my floor, you're fired!\"  In front of us! I'm appalled, horrified, and I don't want to go back.  The entire experience was shocking.  We went to a different restaurant while trying to rationalize a situation I don't even understand to my five year old daughter."}

{"text":"Good service music a little to loud and I like music but it's hard to have conversation with the people your with."}
{"text":"YardHouse is a decent option for meeting up with friends- massive menu means there's something for everyone and the late-night hours at this particular location make it conducive to grabbing a bite or socializing before going out. However, the location is also exceptionally loud and service on a recent visit was less than attentive, even with a large party and a reservation. Luckily they didn't tack on autograt. The prices also seemed higher at this location than others, and the food just wasn't quite as good as usual.

AHI TUNA SALAD: Protein portion was noticeably less than at the Red Rock casino location.
CALAMARI: Portion size was good, breading wasn't too thick or too oily, and there was a good mix of whole pieces and rings. The dipping sauce was cold though.
GRILLED CHEESE & TOMATO BISQUE: Pretty good but nearly $14 for sliced cheese, bread, and tomatoes, is a bit ridiculous. Unclear whether other sandwich/burger orders include a side.
TACOS: $4 for various street tacos. They're street taco sized but not street taco priced and not very tasty either. Pass on the chicken, at least.
POKE NACHOS: Probably your best option. Well priced, good portion, and fresh. I liked the seasonings used, wasn't as salty as I'd expected. Easily shareable, too."}
{"text":"I live in Honolulu and the Yard House in Waikiki is nuts.  Always packed and just crazy.  This particular Yard House at Red Rock was mellow.  Crowded but didn't feel like it.  Relaxed vibe.  Ate here twice and the service was incredible.  Steak Salad was awesome."}
{"text":"Raw burgers.. And hair on our pizza.. Thanks yard house. I'll take the burger to go and actually cook it to health standards"}
{"text":"My family frequents this Yard House at least once a month. The food is very tasty and flavorful, they have unique offerings alongside great standbys, the service is always spot on, they have many options for kids meals (both healthy and not so healthy) and the happy hour deals are a steal.

On this occasion we sat on the patio and enjoyed great and timely service as usual. The buffalo wings are a great starter and my son enjoyed his kids pizza with carrot sticks. 

My only drawbacks: I don't get the sense it is the highest quality meat. This is because my waiter didn't know the term \"grass-fed\" and the Korean now beef was mostly fat and gristle. Also, the patio doesn't have misters when it's hot, which is often in AZ."}
{"text":"Hung out here with a friend while in town and was impressed with the number of beers on tap. This is obviously what they are known for. Food is decent too so put it all together and you get a good meal with your choice of beer. Prices are in line with the Vegas strip and since we usually stay close by this is a nice stop. I'll be back in town in two weeks so I'm sure I'll be back..."}
{"text":"Since this is a chain...I wanted to visit here a few times before I wrote a review...

Overall, they are a solid 3 stars. 

Ambiance is a little crazy and very very loud. If you go at an off time... It's not too bad but if you go at a busy time at around 7 or 8 on a Friday night... It's going to be crowded and super loud with lots of yelling as people are watching sports on the television at the bar... Which happens to be right in the middle of the restaurant. So if you are trying to talk to the person next to you.... Uuhhhhh good luck. :/  (2.5/5)

Price... If you outside of happy hour... The prices are decent for what you get. It's not cheap but it's also not going to break the bank either... So for a night out with friends it's not too bad... And the beers they have on tap and by bottle amazing! They carry beers that I have not seen at other restaurants here in Vegas so it's a plus. :) Also, if you do go for happy hour... Be prepared to be amazed... Most of the items they have at a discounted price for HH are full sized items at the discounted price. Crazy!! It's a great deal. (4/5)... For HH...5/5...:)

Now onto the food...

Cheese curds...Omg.... They are freaking amazing!!! I love me some cheese curds... They are lightly battered and served with 2 sauces... Go for the horseradish sauce... The other one is just too sweet. If you love cheese... These are delish!! 5/5

Burgers... I've had a few different kinds and so has my bf... The fries are da bomb.com... They are on the thinner side so they are very crispy... They almost seem to have a light batter on them... The burgers were good... Don't get me wrong I did not have any complaints except for the last time...My bf ordered med well... And the burger came out med rare... Maybe a miscommunication? Other then that the burgers are decent. 3.5/5 fries...5/5...:)

Sliders... Decent but nothing too memorable....2.5/5

Tomato bisque... Really too sweet. It had a great texture.... Very creamy.... But they added too much sugar to it...1/5

Grilled cheese sandwich... Surprisingly... Yummy! They put a good amount of crunch on the bread.... And the cheese was good... But the surprise were the roasted tomatoes on the sandwich! Very very good! 4.5/5

Service was a total hit or miss...a couple of the times I went... Service was top notch. Where the water didn't get a chance to empty and the server was touching my table and checking on us without being intrusive... And other times the service was a total miss. Like this last time I went my server's name was Dallas... And I asked her to wipe the table since I got sat at a table that was still filthy from the last table.    :( Not a great start for me. But she acted like she was totally annoyed that I asked her to wipe the dirty table and it took her a while to come and wipe the table. From there on didn't get any better. She filled my drink 2x and I guess that was limit since she came by to clear but never refilled my drink or asked if I wanted a refill. The entire night, she made me feel like I was just a bother... And when I asked for to go box for my sandwich and soup... She brought me a box for my sandwich and nothing for my soup and no bag either. Once again, I had to ask her for a bag and a container for my soup... And once again she was annoyed... But by this time I was done with her. Crappy service. 2/5

Will I be back? Most likely since I love the cheese curds and the beer but if we get her again in definitely asking to be reseated."}
{"text":"The southern hot the chicken And pancakes you can't go around the beer selection is unreal. Every time you go in you can sample two beers for free you're welcome!"}
{"text":"I had Blackened swordfish and hongos con rajas tacos they were both ok just kind of cold when they got to the table and the hongos one would have been better on a corn tortilla;)
Hubby had a bacon burger and had no complains. 
As far as service.. We had to ask for new glasses because they didn't smell clean*~* and we had to pour our own water thank you very much!
It felt like we had to wait a little while but maybe it felt longer because we were both a little hungry;)"}
{"text":"I've always received standard or above service every time I visit. The atmosphere is lively and upbeat. The seating is comfortable. The food is great. No complaints! I always come here for happy hour to get the best deals on finger foods (Monday-Friday 3pm-6pm). The wings and spinach dip are my all time favorites :)"}
{"text":"Yard house is always awesome. Need to escape the fact ur in Vegas? Then this is the place! Food is always good. Beer is endless and delicious. Service always spectacular. need a Ferris wheel ride after ur nachos? Then you came to the right place!"}

Personeel is erg vriendelijk! Pasta was heerlijk!"}
{"text":"Awesome location and great drinks! My boyfriend and I shared the onion ring tower and the queso dip and both were great! Would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"The organic tomato bisque with grilled cheese is excellent.  I get it every single visit.  5/5

The street tacos are very good and worth recommending. 5/5

The grilled artichoke is another favorite 5/5

I love the outdoor area for dining at this location."}
{"text":"Great place for simple comfort food and good salads. The unlimited choices of beers are topped by a full bar and great staff. 

Great place to unwind after hauling the mall."}
{"text":"We love Yard House but made me write my first review for them was Kurtis our server.  He was awesome in every way...  He made great menu suggestions and was quick and attentive. we will for sure come back and ask to be sat in his section.   Thx Kurtis for great service!"}
{"text":"Just okay...wasn't impressed by the service, esp with the \"hair\" in my friend's salad. Ugh! Ruined my appetite."}
{"text":"We went in on a Friday evening at 6 and it was packed.  We had tried to make a reservation for eight about a week and a half earlier and was unable to do so due to a miscommunication.  When we arrived that Friday we where told it would be an hour and a half wait.  Upon hearing this we explained that we had tried to make a reservation earlier without success and a manager was then called in to assist us.  Jason was the manager who was sympathetic to our dilemma and had us seated within 15 minutes even though the rest of our party was five minutes behind that.  Jason handled things very professionally unlike most service workers in this town that treat you like you're bothering them.  Because of his actions we will make Yardhouse our go to when in Town Square.  The food is excellent and we've always been treated well by the staff.  And as well as we've been treated by the rest of the staff Jason was that much better that we had to write a review singing his praises."}
{"text":"So far so good! Haven't had a bad experience here and the food is great can't complain :) they have a early and late night happy hour which has great selections! My favorites are truffle fries, firecracker wings, and onion ring tower. This time we tried ordering something different and got ceviche with tortilla chips and some tacos. Omggggg the ceviche was amazing haha I wouldn't say it's traditional ceviche however, it's more a fusion but nonetheless delicious! The tacos were great as well, they were filled up completely."}
{"text":"The wife met friends there as a bite to eat before a night of bowling. Place was packed with a 20 minute wait. Okay, no big deal. 

We sat then ordered our beverages. While waiting for them I had server spill a glass of ice water down my back. Personally, no big deal because it's only water and I live in the desert. She did however take a beer off my bill. 

I ordered the Bbq bacon cheddar burger with fries. It's the Yard House and my expectations werr high because I've heard such great things about this place and it's ALWAYS crowded. 

Well, big let down. Bbq bacon cheddar burger, with the name you'd think it would have some kind of sauce or seomthing? Nope. Dry as the desert I live in. Bacon. I like mine not so over cooked and a bit chewy. It was so over cooked I think I broke a tooth!!

I was not pleased with this experience. We visit Red Rock Casino however I will NEVER eat at the Yard House again!!!

Maybe I'll try Lucille's which is right next door.

By the way, the servings were mediocre. I'd get a bigger plate for the same $$$ at Carl Jr's"}
{"text":"Mark was an absolutely amazing server! I brought my sister and my niece and nephews in and he was very patient while the kids decided on what they decided to eat! Not to mention his food knowledge is perfection! My sister and I are both servers so we understand what it's like! As for the food the ahi Tina salad was perfect but the truffle bacon burger was not the greatest it lacked flavor. Mark you're awesome and if I ever go back to serving I hope I can be just as kind, patient, and knowledgeable as you are!"}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal at yard house.  Did the $10 lunch and it was great.  Always good service.  Huge many so something for everyone."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. Not only does it have a menu that is so large that there is always something new to try, but everything single thing we have eaten has tasted great!  Its nice to sit on the patio outside and people watch, but inside is fun also, especially when there is a game on the tv you want to watch. We recommend the spicy tuna roll - its so large, and not what you expect at all."}
{"text":"We have tried a lot of things from their large menu, and consistently, the food is always good. We especially like the late night happy hour, as it makes the (already quite cheap ) large appetizers half price, and this is a steal.
Great atmosphere whether sitting inside or out. Of course they have good beers also which is a bonus."}
{"text":"Have to say , me and the family just left disappointed. The server was awesome and had a great personality. (Travis)  The down side of this experience was the food. I ordered the Surf-N-turf burger. The lobster was okay , not great.. but the asparagus is where it really took a huge dive. It was so cold and undercooked.. it was saddening. The Ahi Poke bowl I'd give a thumbs up. Don't get the burger though , it's was underwhelming. As for their beer selection , it's really something.  They have an amazing amount and the scarffe  Hendrick quadruple was delicious. Great service , great beer , bad food. (Just my experience)"}
{"text":"Mike really wanted to go to Yard House, despite bad food experiences the first two times he'd been and the fact that it was 20 miles away. Said Mike, \"Yeah, I keep giving them a chance hoping things will change.\"

Chuck, the first waiter, was terrific.  Great personality and just a fun guy.  When we got switched to Molly, however, mmm, not so much.  Not her fault really, but she's no Chuck.   

Rick's margarita was terrible and they wouldn't re-make it.  Worst was that they had an attitude about the fact it was a crappy drink. Three of us verified that it sucked. 

The pizza appetizer was just ok, at best, and the Chinese something-or-other was bad as well.  As for the entrees, I had the pan seared scallops.  They were undercooked and the mosh stuff in the middle (oro pasta plus god-knows-what) wasn't very appealing either.  

I absolutely would not recommend this place to any friends and if Eck insists on going back there again, I'll stage a mini-coup and vote him down."}
{"text":"I've never been to the one they just opened in Houston, Texas so when our daughter said she was going to take us out for dinner here, i was all for it! - They got a great fireplace on the patio out front, but you might have to get there early or just wait for your turn because with the mountain views in the background...it is a definite spot when visiting! - I had some low calorie chicken dinner which was great, but the red potatoes were very, very dry! And whenever you can eat, pay your bill and walk down the hallway to a casino area....it's always a great venue and a great night!!"}
{"text":"Pros- Extensive beer selection, diverse menu, great atmosphere
Cons- I ordered Nashville Hot Chicken, friend had Jamabalaya $70 with 1 drink and tip. Left hungry, tiny portions- 1 piece of chicken on mine with 3 tiny pancakes, friends was mainly rice. When Im paying around $20 for a dish and leave hungry, its the ultimate let down and rip off."}
{"text":"HH is solid: Mon-Fri 3-6PM (and a late-night version) with food and drink specials. The food is consistent, I prefer to sit at the bar for quick service. Poke stack ($13 regular, $8 HH) is one of the better deals but prepare yourself for an overwhelming amount of shredded carrots. The lettuce wraps (chicken or mushroom) can easily make an entire meal. Everything I've had here is generally \"A-OK\" but nothing to rave about.

Heads up: if you are doing the gluten-free thing, pick another dining option. My coworker was limited to salads and protein, as none of their sides are safe. The server we had made her dietary restrictions sound frivolous, too, and now this spot is out of our regular rotation."}
{"text":"Dropped in for dinner w/a coworker the other night and had a good experience. It was my 2nd time at a Yard House but first time at this location. Beer selection was as good as I'd remembered, and I like the diff size offerings, as well as the couple samplers available. Food menu is definitely expansive and it took a while to decide on what I wanted. Had an asada taco and blackened swordfish taco. Both tasted good and my only complaint was that the chilled edamame was somewhat lackluster, both in terms of taste and portion. Friendly service, even if beer orders did take a while at times (maybe it's bc we were on the patio?). Overall a good time and I'd certainly go back."}
{"text":"Um... why did it take me so long to get here? I took some pals to Red Rock with the intention of visiting Cabo, but then remembered it was closed, so we hit up Yard House.

We opened our menus to the first page and spent about ten minutes deciding which beer to try. I chose the New Castle/Guinness blend, which was hearty and delish. My girl-date chose the Blue Moon/Guinness blend--also delish, and much lighter.

Then we got to the food menu. It's pretty much like going to the Cheesecake Factory (tons of choices.) They have a veggie-based meat substitute that can be put into any one of SIXTEEN of their dishes. I finally settled on the spicy chicken sandwich. It was definitely spicy, but very good. It came with a pile of very thin fries, which I dipped in our guacamole after we ran out of chips. I hate to waste good guacamole.

I just realized that the waiter boxed up my fries for me and I think I forgot them on the table. Sad. :( I guess I'll have to go back for more. :D"}
{"text":"Beer selection is simply unmatched in the valley, main reason I go there.  Food is a hit and miss, depends on your waiter and the kitchen on any given day."}
{"text":"What a cool spot to hit up before/after a game. There's a lot of outdoor seating right along the main walkways of the area too.

Service and food was great, nothing more or less than expected at a yard house.

I liked that a bunch of other bars and restaurants were right near this place too. Real cool atmosphere all around. 

TRY TO GET THERE FOR HAPPY HOUR SPECIALS"}
{"text":"This is a chain restaurant... So there isn't much to say about it. However, if you order fried food.... Be prepared for it to be \"too\" fried. Calamari has tentacles... Which I don't mind, but it's too crispy and greasy. I was fortunate enough to figure this out years ago. I decided to try something new, crab cakes, bad decision!!!! Once again, too crispy! Note to self, don't order fried food! 

After I sent back the crab cakes, I went with a favorite, lobster, crab dip. Comes with chips and pita! 

They are known for their beer selection on tap. I don't drink beer, but if you order a yard size... Just know it is exactly what it sounds like. A yard!"}
{"text":"So this time we came back for lunch and sat at the bar. Service was better except we had 4 different bartenders in 2 hours and one what appeared to be a manager. Jason was very personable and quick to take our orders and give refills. We started with appetizers which took 16 mns to receive. Jason apologized saying there was a party of 40 in the back room. the chicken wraps were wonderful the chicken nice and hot but we also ordered the pear and gorgonzola pizza and it came out cold. Unfortunately this was when we were in between our 4 bartenders and after about 5 minutes of seeing no one we decided to eat it. It was good but would have been fantastic hot. We went on to order thet truffle burger which was cooked perfectly medium and they allowed fruit instead of fries on the side. Better experience than the last time but still not overly impressed. The food is priced for quality dining and unfortunately we found that the Glendale location is lacking a bit all around. The north scottdale location would be my advice."}
{"text":"Love the beer selection!  Been to several locations and they do a great job at all of them.  The ahi is amazing!  Definitely need to check out the original one in San Diego if you have the opportunity."}
{"text":"This is the third Yard House location I've been to and I really appreciate the great consistency of quality they all share. Obviously they have a great beer selection, but I feel the food doesn't get enough credit... this chain has some pretty good food for being a sports bar on beer steroids.

I've tried almost all of their appetizers, and I don't have a single complaint... the entrees I've had have also been stellar. Huge portions to go along with those huge glasses of beer... most of the servers I've come accross usually can suggest which beer should be paired with which dish and vice-versa. The staff is pretty top-notch and usually pretty accommodating... and this place gets packed!"}
{"text":"Went in last night for a friend's birthday dinner. It was about 5:30, so not too busy yet. We chose to sit out on the patio since the weather was perfect. Seating was quick - we were taken to a table right away. We weren't big on the location of the table and asked for the one next to it, and they obliged no problem. The server was friendly and quick. Food was great as always. I always order ahi in some form and I have never been disappointed. All in all, great night. Love this location too!"}
{"text":"Every thing just perfect, the food quality, personels.... We had a wonderful night."}
{"text":"Well I typically never even bother to review places on yelp... but to start with the first part of my meal came out wrong... the manager came out to give us his apologies so I decided to just brush it off secondly me and my boyfriends steaks both came out way over cooked and again the manager came out to apologize I once again brushed it off ... about half an hour later we went to a movie before we could even get inside the theater we both got very sick.....I'm very unsatisfied with the entire experience at the Westgate yard house"}
{"text":"Lettuce wrap 5 Yelp
Tacos 5 Yelp
Pastrami sliders 5 yelp
Service 5 Yelp

-1 Yelp sat outside and it was bike night on Thursday so lots of loud bike exhaust.

Cost a bit higher but it was good overall."}
{"text":"This place is just wonderful, it's ENDLESS beer selection alone is enough to warrant that but the food is a whole different story. I've tried almost every appetizer and snack from the lettuce wraps to the truffle fries and not a single one has let me down. And you can't go wrong with any of the entrees either. The prices are mostly standard, but the wait is pretty bad. All in all, it's a great place for a party, and the eats, beer and service are good."}
{"text":"The BEERS! All the glorious beers! Yard House had something like 200 beers on tap. Ridiculous! They all come from this crazy temperature controlled keg room and travel through huge pipes on the ceiling. It's just awesome. Food was OK, but whatever. Check out all that weird and wonderful beer!"}
{"text":"I come here often for lunch with the girls. It is a great place to relax and rest our feet from all the shopping that is around. It is also a great spot to have some food before going up to party at Blue Martini. They are open late and never disappoint. The food is always great and we have never had any service that was less than stellar. It is perfect for sports fans and anyone else really."}
{"text":"We came here this past Sunday at about 10, just in time for their happy hour specials. 

This place had a cool vibe and we were seated in a comfortable booth. 

The service was exceptionally good, I wish I could remember his name but I can't seem to find our receipt at the moment. 

We ordered a couple of drinks and the Poke Nachos and California Roll. 

The Poke Nachos were delish but the California roll was a bit odd. It was more like a stack (rolls are rolled so a little surprising) but the flavors didn't quite go together nor did they reflect what you expect from a \"California Roll\"."}
{"text":"Yard house great place to hang out converse and drink . Chelsea was a great waitress . With rapport building she is absolutely great . Thank you and I with out a doubt rec  yard house . Ask for Chelsea"}
{"text":"This is my third time I have been to Vegas, I go every year with a group of friends and this is one restaurant I go to every time! Their menu is absolutely great (food and drinks) and their staff is just as great as their menu. 

I'm a big appetizers guy especially when I'm out with a larger group. If you enjoy wings their portion for the appetizer is really good for the price and the quality of the chicken makes it even better. I do also find the onion ring tower and good appetizer to share with a groups of friends and it comes with 2 dipping sauces which makes it even better. 

The best part of all was how knowledgable their staff was when it came to questions about the menu. There are times when I cannot make up my mind between a couple of items and I asked my waiter his suggestion. He was able to go into so much detail as well as include his favorite item as well. This place has it all, oh and multiple TVs for all the sporting events. This place is a must for anyone visiting Vegas"}
{"text":"So.... the bff and I went here for a club sandwich... she said it was Bomb! and she was right. it was very good! The bacon was crispy and the avocado was ripe... it was delicious! The server Colleen was very pleasant ...and had good suggestions... The french onion soup however was a little salty and the ranch on the salad we ordered was not very exciting...
 The smores dessert however!!!! was to die for! the marshmallows are fresh and the brownie was made to order!  *eyes roll back in head* it was so decadent! That is like a once a year kind of treat!"}
{"text":"My experience at this Yardhouse location has been great! The quality of food has been outstanding every time i've been here, plus you have an almost endless beer selection.. what more do you want! Last dish i had here was the Mac n Cheese and it was Mmmm Deeelicious! The Outdoor patio has a laid back feel to it... cool when hangin with some friends. Great place to be on any given night!"}
{"text":"All I ate was appetizers coconut shrimp, crab cakes, and Tai ribs.. Coconut shrimp was the best! Wife had veggy burger and top 5 veggie burgers I have tasted .. Juicy"}
{"text":"I love this chain. Excellent selection of beers, including local Joseph James! Little expensive but everyone from 702 will say \"it's Vegas\" .Vegas use to be known for it's cheap food and drinks plus quality! Now u gotta find the diamonds. 
     They have a nice vegetarian selection of food. The bartenders are very attentive and I recommend sitting at the bar top. Get a regular sized beer if you can't chug."}
{"text":"My second time at a Yard House restaurant, the first time was in Pasadena, CA and the food was not enjoyable. This Yard House location was great! We had a group of 18 and didn't make reservations, the manager got us seated as soon as possible. Our servers took our drink and food orders quickly and made sure the little kids got their food first. Everyone was pleased with their meals and one of our servers brought over a free habanero beer sampler for my brother. The staff were patient with us as we were a large group and didn't seem to mind all the kids running around. The service here was great and I really appreciated that."}
{"text":"I honestly only go here for happy hour with my family bc their hh food menu is such a great deal. The food is always delicious and the service is great but the food can take a while sometimes. We always order the chicken nachos, carnivore pizza, chicken strips & fries and sliders. Not on the hh menu are the shiitake garlic noodles. We always order a couple sides of those. For my family of 6 to eat usually comes to around $60 with tip during hh but that doesn't include alcoholic drinks. To make sure we don't have to wait we try to get there around 4:30 to beat the crowds and make sure we're here before hh ends at 6."}
{"text":"Great  edition to The Strip! Tons of good beer on tap and creative cocktails. Food is legit as well. Got the filet steak..was super tasty. We'll be back for sure next time in Sin City."}
{"text":"I ate here on Monday for lunch.  We had a short window of time(an hour) to eat before our meeting, but had to rush through food because it took so long for our sandwiches to come out.  

We each got a sandwich, they forgot the avocado on my coworkers sandwich, and the cheese on mine.  She got a little cup of avocado when she asked, but I just did without the cheese for time sake.  The food is very good, and the french fries that come with the sandwiches are awesome! They are skinny little shoe string french fries that almost have a texture of batter dipped fries...I don't know but they were very good.  The turkey on my  sandwich was difficult to eat in sandwich form, but had great flavor(thick cut, and then warmed up on the grill top I think based on the marks on it). They gave me a soda in a  to go cup when asked since we rushed through eating.  

My main complaint is just that it took so long for our food to come out. We ordered what we thought was quick food because we knew we were on a short time constraint. It was pretty empty inside so we thought that would help also, but it didn't.  I would  eat here again, but when I have more than an hour."}
{"text":"This is the perfect place to watch some football, enjoy some great food, and have a few beers.  Add in their reasonable prices and you have the recipe for a great time. 

With the beer options here you can't help but order at least one. The food is fantastic. Personally I love the lunch salad and sandwich special. I get a half Turkey club and the best Cesar salad I have ever had anywhere. They also have an option for soup too... however I can't every seem to turn my back in that Cesar salad lol. 

The wait staff are always pleasant and usually on point. I did have one waitress when I was there about a month ago who was very disinterested and because of that she messed up our order. 

They have many tv's up around the place and on Sundays they have several different football games showing. 

The only downside is twice we have had to wait to be seated even though there were clearly tables available. 

Overall I give four stars because even having to unnecessarily wait, the food is always worth it because the food is THAT good."}
{"text":"I get a call on Thursday: \"Dude, I just got fired from UOP, we have to celebrate!\" If it was from anyone else but Ryan, I would have been shocked. However, he hated his job and we love Yard House, so I was definitely down to have some \"FU UOP\" drinks up at Desert Ridge.

Yard House has been one of our main spots for years. Right off the bat, the Happy Hour is fantastic; 100+ beers on tap, including some of AZ's finest and a couple amazing international brews. The servers usually do a great job of suggesting drinks as well. Traditionally I \"cleanse the palate\" with a Warsteiner Pilsner and roll from there. Friday night, I tipped back a few Kiltlifters as well, all brought in well frosted pint glasses.

The food has been pretty fantastic across the board. Personally, you can't go wrong with Firecracker Wings (sweet and very spicy wings) and the Spinach Dip. Their seared ahi appetizer and Caesar salad are both fantastic, with the ahi always perfectly cooked. The Southern Fried Chicken Breast is likely the best meal, though my pal is a huge fan of the Cuban Dip.

The one potential drawback is the service isn't always fast. Honestly, if you are going to relax and enjoy time with your friends, it's great. Beer glasses don't stay empty too long, waters get refilled (we only sit on the patio), and the food usually comes out before you get too hungry. Just understand that the joint gets busy for happy hour and you will enjoy the experience. Give me a call if you ever want to share some FU beers!"}
{"text":"I have never been treated better in my life at any restaurant. Garin, the restaurant manager, saw that we had been sitting for 10 minutes without a server and he came over and apologized profusely. He allowed us to choose 3 beers each to sample (normally you can only have 2). He personally brought them to us and then told us he would be comping us our Brussels sprout appetizer which was to die for. Before we had even finished our first round of beers he brought out 2 more beers and said they were also on the House! Wow if I lived in AZ I would drive across the state for this kind of service. Unfortunately I live in Indiana but whenever I come back to AZ I will for sure be back!!!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for their Ginger Beer, it's made it house & you'll never want bottled ginger beer again! We sat at the bar and were served by a very polite bartender named Brandon! He gave us the breakdown of the drink and we ordered the Creme Brûlée and I really enjoyed it. The only part of could have done without was the chocolate chips at the bottom. Yard house was a really enjoyable restaurant. It's a tad dark inside there, kinda felt like your walking into a hole in the wall bar but it's far from that. The bar is huge and the menu is even bigger. Yard house is definitely the beer garden of Scottsdale. Check it out & ask for Brandon at the bar"}
{"text":"A buddy and I went to this Yardhouse last weekend, first off we walked in with plastic drink cups and were told we couldn't bring them in, what the hell is happening to Vegas!, anyways we gulped them down then and went back in.  The \"hostess\" took us up to the deck as we requested and was going to sit us near a table of kids, I said no we want to sit over there away from kids, she asked if I liked kids and I said no and I don't want to sit next to them while in Vegas...anyways we were seated a few tables away from them and were pleased.  Almost immediately the same hostess was back up on the deck with guess what, a family with kids, she went straight for the table next to us (there were about 15 tables empty on the deck) and seated them, then smiled at me as to say f*ck you...well f*ck her..!

Anyways our waiter was pretty decent, he did disappear a couple of times but at least got our order right, the food at Yardhouse is usually good and this time was no exception...would have been a higher rating but hostess really was a b*tch so two stars is all they get...."}
{"text":"This is still one of my favorite restaurants.  Love their wheat beer.  The ribs are so good.  Haven't had a bad meal here yet.  The servers we've had have been excellent."}
{"text":"To begin we placed at a large table outside (there were only two of us) that was far from the heaters. A waiter came to take the additional table away that was connected to ours. It was uncomfortable from that moment. Our waiter made the whole experience even more uncomfortable. He kept trying to joke with us, but it was very awkward. On a side note my vegan friend ordered the chips and guacamole. On the menu it did not state that the guac came with feta cheese on it. As a restaurant that offers vegetarian/vegan options, we were both shocked by this oversight. All of our food took a very long time to come out. Once our starters finally came out our waiter came by and jokingly asked if we were ready to order yet, making light of the slow service I suppose. Once our food finally came out we were underwhelmed to say the least. Our waiter also asked if we could taste the poison. I have never had a joke with me in such a manner, but the food was subpar, so the poison aspect was debatable. Also as a whole they seemed very disorganized. On two separate occasions food we had not ordered was brought to our table. On the bright side, the hostess and people at the front were very friendly. But because of the rest of the service I am obligated to rate this restaurant so low. Proceed with caution."}
{"text":"Super good food, great service. Brittany and Jordan took care of us and they were so nice. It was a super busy Saturday and our wait was quite short considering.
We will definitely go back.  We tried a new brew (for us) called Petrus Aged Red on Jordan's recommendation. It was so good. We found some at a nearby liquor store to take home with us! Good job Jordan!!"}
{"text":"Came here to enjoy some tasty German and Dutch Beer on tap with Yelp'er Scott D and found the visit to be both fantabulous as well as invigorating. Nothing like a cold one and some good company to feed the soul. Nice!

What a selection of beers they have here. There must be over a hundred or more different kinds from all over the world. It is fun to check out all the beer tap handles inside their fully stocked island bar. They also have many of the regular brands and several locally crafted beers if you wish.

Inside is comfortable with plenty of room to enjoy your meal. There was a cool B Day celebration going on right next to us. Humongous food menu with several of the standard favorites and then some. If you can't find something here to eat you are just not hungry.

We both ordered a couple of tasty waves and something from Burger and Sandwich section of the menu. I went for the Pepper Crusted Gorgonzola Burger with marsala sautéed crimini mushrooms, caramelized onions & baby spinach. Mi Amigo ordered the Roasted Turkey Club Sandwich with swiss, avocado, applewood smoked bacon, tomato, lettuce & mayo on some toasted bread.

Food was pretty good and service was friendly. Can get rather busy during peak hours and a little pricey if you ordering from the bar. BEER SO GOOD.

Conveniently located in the D. Ridge food court near the movie theater. Kid and family friendly with an outdoor patio as an option. Enjoy and be SAFE."}
{"text":"I had tuna two ways here, both amazing. Ceviche was incredibly flavored. Carpaccio amazingly fresh and delicious. Atmosphere was awesome and the surrounding shops make it work walking down the side street. Definitely check this one out!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed with the jambalaya over linguine pasta BIG time! So, the menu had lots of interesting and cool looking  dishes on it! I liked the vibe of the place and the waitress was a doll! She had such a pleasant attitude and had no problem seating me even though I arrived late and was informed that the kitchen would be closing in ten minutes. 

After  reviewing the menu and being told by the adorable waitress that the jambalaya was deelish....I was sold. The dish had shrimp, crawfish, blackened shrimp and sausage. I was shocked that the sausage and shrimp were seasoned,but was underwhelmed with how bland the pasta was. The dish was \"missing something\". It was not great. Just okay. Needless to say  I was not impressed with my meal at all. I did come late about ten minutes prior to the kitchen closing, but this is not a place that I care to visit again."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite restaurant in Vegas. Me and my boyfriend are vegetarian & they have an incredible menu for us. Their entire gardein selection is amazing. Please never take it off the menu! It's so nice to go somewhere that has amazing food every single time we visit. Also incredible service! Shaun was our server last time & he was beyond great. Had so much patience with us & was on top of everything. They also have a great happy hour!"}
{"text":"Best place in Westgate! They have almost every beer known to man and all of their food is absolutely delicious. Their burgers are some of the best I've ever had, the Mac & Cheese is awesome. Happy hour is worth going and the staff is always friendly. The only thing I can complain about is the hour wait sometimes when there is an event at Westgate."}
{"text":"SO MUCH BEER!

If you are trying to be a purveyor of micro beers and local made beers..
this would be the place.

Been here twice..had such a great time. 
Bar: nice and pretty.
Place: Loud but enjoyable
Price:  Take some cash to make things easierrrr....like 50 to make it a good time.

{"text":"We were wandering around the outside near the Linq Hotel and came upon this place. The staff here are well trained and greets you at the door and say good-bye to you when you leave. Even the young man who sat us at our tables started a conversation about our trip to Vegas. Our waitress, Kristen P was the nicest waitress on this trip to Vegas and I overheard her talking to the folks at the table next to us about being a transplant from the East Coast.  

It's a very good place for beer lovers - with over a 100 variety, she told us they have up to 300 varieties.  I liked the fried calamari which was crispy, good amt. tentacles and not too oily, $11.25.  The Youngs Chocolate Stout had a delightful chocolate scent.  Hubby thought his small Jambalaya, $12.95 was good. I thought the Nashville boneless Hot fried chicken $16.65 was OK but not sure I'd try it again.  I have a preference for buttermilk fried chicken.  The entire meal with tip came to $62+.  They treat you well here as a customer and that alone would bring me back in the future to try other courses.  There are lots of TVs mounted on the walls to watch your favorite teams."}
{"text":"So I LOVE Beer! But this place (which I've never been to) is now the Mecca for beer. Not only is their beer menu 5 pages long it's categorized by: Type, size and ABV 

I tend to err on the side of super dark stouts and IPA's so tonight I had the Dogfish 60min IPA and Odell Mercenary IPA. 

Both were amazing! The Odell was strong, like an IPA should be - granted it was surprisingly light in color but definitely my favorite at 9% ABV 

I paired it with the BBQ Cheddar Burger which was cooked to perfection (Medium-Well.) It came with a garlic aolie spread and rum BBQ sauce, which was tangy and sweet. 

My wife had the lobster and shrimp pasta which was equally as good! 

From now on if I'm ever in a town that has a Yardhouse, I will be giving them my business-no questions asked!"}
{"text":"Yardhouse is one of the better options at Westgate and even it is pretty lousy.  The beer selection is awesome and the music is good but that is where it ends.  The service is always slow no matter what day, what time, what year.  The food is mediocre to decent but over priced and the service is anywhere from poor to horrendous.

We recently went and ordered 2 soups, 2 apps, and 1 kids meal.  We literally waited over 30 minutes for anything to arrive.  We are talking the most basic items on the menu here folks and the place was half empty when we walked in.  

When it finally did arrive, by someone other than our long gone waitress, the onion rings were burnt and already cold, the soups had a layer of film on top which indicates they were sitting out for quite some time, and the french fries were cold.  I'm not sure if they planned this but we were so hungry from waiting we just ate the bullshit they served us.  

I asked for our check and waited and waited while our waitress Hillary stops at random tables that she is not even attending.  She finally brings us our check, drops it and runs away without taking it back even though my card has been out on the table for a good 15 minutes. She finally comes back and takes it.  Again she stops at random table after random table while I sit and wait and wait.  I felt like I was being held hostage by Isis.     

I am pretty sure I just survived my first hostage crisis.  Bottom line: Yardhouse sucks, Westgate is bunk, and the outlets are whack.  I hope I never come back anywhere near here again other than for a Cardinals game.  I swear this side of town can't have anything good."}
{"text":"Worlds largest tap beer selection.   Great food.   Pizzas and Burgers are top notch.  You can't go wrong with this place.  Could be a little cheaper but I'll for sure return."}
{"text":"Wanna go for a ride? Roll up into the Yard house and ride the rail, there are plenty of taps and before you finish something else will be added. Mitch Mc. was taking care of us so whatever you fancy beer or otherwise Mitch can make it happen .I enjoy comfort food with my brew so the onion rings were spot on, good and crispy, score.Tuna sashimi had a generous amount of Wasabi that took a few beers to cool down (thank you again to Mitch) and the halibut was very much enjoyed. We met a manager,  Nora, who was a doll, and will go back to see again.Great staff and I have to mention how clean the entire place was."}
{"text":"First time in this establishment. We were seated immediately. We had a choice of sitting in the heated patio or inside, we decided inside because even though it was heated it was too cold for me. Anyway, I ordered a pomegranate margarita to start, it was delicious. Time to order, since it was late I thought I'd have something small so I ordered the turkey pot pie and my hubby a full rack of ribs. Oh my gosh when the pot pie came, instead of a normal size pot pie I got a flying saucer. Anyway, it was good and full of turkey. My hubby also loved his ribs and if you gamble with your card you can use your points to pay."}
{"text":"Great server Chris at Town Square, but what a disappointment in menu, I go for the pork belly tacos and they had a menu change and a shrink in portions. Great service but highly disappointed is changes. Don't change what is already good !!!!! And customers know !!!! BRING BACK PORK BELLY PLEASE!!!!"}
{"text":"As inconsistent as it gets. First visit: above average burger, reasonable service. Second visit 1 day later: miserable dry burger - half overcooked and dry, half undercooked and yet still dry, and not as ordered. Waiter decided, rather than fixing it, to just hand us the rest of the order and let us try to sort it out.  Won't bother to go back, no guarantee that it'll be right."}
{"text":"The menu can be a bit intimidating and appear overly-fancy, but don't let that deter you. The service here is impeccable- our server Chris was a rockstar and made awesome suggestions to some picky eaters in our party. Even the hostess was incredibly friendly.

Their truffle fries are awesome. Classic ranch salad is a go-to."}
{"text":"The vibe here is really cool, but it can get kind of loud.  Right when we sat down, our server went on break.  I have NEVER seen such a wonderful transition between servers.  He brought over his replacement and introduced her.  When he was back from break, she told us that he was back and would be taking care of us the rest of the time.  It was so incredibly thoughtful and smooth, when most restaurants just kind of throw someone new at you and you don't know what's going on.

I told the server that I had a nut allergy and the manager came over.  She double checked my order and said she would alert the kitchen staff so that they could take extra care in making our food to avoid contamination.  THAT is how you are supposed to deal with guests who have severe allergies.  it was so great.  

Also, as everyone else has mentioned, they have a ton of drinks to chose from.  I, personally, was more taken with the feta cream cheese.  It was delicious and unlike anything I had ever eaten before.  

I definitely recommend this place.  Great service and really good food.  Also, the prices are not ridiculous like a lot of places in Vegas."}
{"text":"I go often to the yard house the service is always good and the beer flights are a fun way to try their more than a 100 beers on tap you can go a few ways. They have an ipa flight which is great but if you love Belgium's like I do that's the way to roll. Their happy hour is awesome they have several menu items which are half price from pizzas to sushi which  I know you wouldn't think...but their poke stack is my favorite! I have had many things off their menu everything was good with the exception of the ribeye steak although it was ok somehow when you think of a ribeye you think big and thick. It had no bone and was very thin. Just go with anyone of their many other choices."}
{"text":"They have a tremendous beer selection and plenty of TVs to watch the big game on.  If you're looking for dinner, they have plenty of great options.  The Nashville Hot Chicken had me coming in multiple times over a two week span while I was in the area for work."}
{"text":"You know, I don't understand why this place always has a wait. And I also don't understand the attitude we have gotten the 5 or so times we've come here. The girls at the front desk are unnecessarily snotty most of the time which makes no sense as they are hosting at a brewery and burger place. I am a burger addict and this place does not satisfy my burger cravings. I've had one good burger here, the rest of the time they were just boring. The beef seems fresh enough but absolutely no seasoning is used. I add toppings such as cheese and bacon and it's still boring. Their fries are good and their bernaise is as well but it's just too much of a hassle to get a boring burger. Won't be back here."}
{"text":"Brought my family here on a Friday night.  I asked for medium well burger, it was more medium/medium rare. So I asked if they could cook it a bit more.  They apologized and ordered me a whole new burger. I had the BBQ bacon burger.  A few minutes later burger comes and after a few bites I notice there's no bbq sauce on it. At this point I've kind of lost interest in eating a burger so I let them know i don't need another burger.
They apologized profusely, manager came out said he was taking the burger off the bill also comping all the beer and dessert for the whole table.  So we just ordered some ice cream for the kids.  They really went out of their way to make it right. I've never had such a sincere and great effort in any customer service situation as this. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"My favorite after work hangout!  

Always consistent with the food quality and taste.  There was only one time my food didn't come out the same and the manager came out to help me replace the order or to take it off my bill.  In addition, she gave me a complimentary glass of wine because I did not want to replace it.  Great service and great food. Fun vibe and has an outdoor area to hanging out and relaxing!"}
{"text":"First off I need to say how Ive been to the Yard House about 15-20 times in my life in the last 5-6 years. Thats about 3-4 times a year. Out of lets say 18 visits I have been satisfied almost 80%-85% of the time. Not bad. I enjoy the selection, I enjoy that my 2 year old can get broccoli instead of fries every time, and I think they have great happy hour. I dont drink so this is a food review only. I have had 2 bad experiences. 

Once about 3 months ago I found a 3 inch piece of aluminum in my salad which I chomped on for about 30 seconds before realizing it wasnt a fried onion. Mistakes happen. I get it. I didn't choke and die. They comped my meal.

 Lets move in to tonight. 7:45pm Friday Night Desert Ridge. 10 minute wait for a booth inside. No problem. As always ordered right away for the two year old so he could get his food before us. My wife and I ordered 5 minutes later. 2 steak type meals. Manager brought food over in about 15 minutes said sorry for the delay for the chicken strips and broccoli for you know who. No problem so far. Without realizing it, it quickly became 8:45pm. First of all it was freezing in there although I guess we were the only ones that noticed. So waiting 50 minutes for food felt alot longer. Here comes a manager type. Uh Oh. She says that never in her years had she heard what she's about to say. Our server forgot to put our order in. No I'm not kidding. Everything will be comped and we decide to wait for our meals. Two year old getting restless but so is my stomach. 9:00pm Dinner served. Wife takes a bite of steak. Without getting into too much detail, it was rancid and thats putting is mildly. It smelled so fricking bad. Here comes a manager type to check on us. She knows somethings really wrong. Time to get the boss's boss. My wife dares her to take a bite and cuts off a piece. She wants nothing to do with it. She literally was disgusted also. BTW, I ordered my steak medium. Nope. Not even close. I took 2 bites. Now I must say the managers apologized profusely. I will say however the head boss said \"well we are comping your meal\" which I said \"what meal? We didnt eat anything.\" I think she just misspoke and didnt mean it in a negative context although it was an extremely dumb thing to say.

 Its 9:20pm now and we have no choice but to leave. She takes down our name and address and says she will \"follow up\" with us. I'm not sure why I would even want to be comped as I don't think I could go back. There are too many options other than the YH.I really think it was just a disastrous evening all the way around and its not the norm for the YH. Maybe 80% satisfaction is just what you should live with when it comes to restaurants. I mean 8/10 above average to very good meals is not bad.So I am leaving 3 stars cause its unfair for me to just write about a bad experience and not mention the good ones."}
{"text":"Although I wish they have had delivery - mostly because i'm god damn lazy - Yardhouse is still a great place for vegetarian options. I've only done take out and probably will continue to only do so, as the atmosphere is a bit too loud and sports.. y.. for my liking. 

They have a huge vegetarian menu featuring Gardein meat substitutes: a great brand of very likeable and tastey vegetarian alternatives to things such as chicken strips, etc. Great option for vegetarians that are just starting out. This is the only place I know of that offers vegetarian hot wings and obscure things such as that. 

It's a little hard to get to; you have to go through the batshittery of West Gate. But it's worth it if you're hungry and / or lazy and can't cook. Yay!"}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying I brought this on myself. I was hungry, really really hungry, and yes I went for a chain restaurant. Further more, order poorly, like really really poorly. I blame my actions on fatigue, and pray you don't judge me. 
Came here today for lunch at 3pm. Was seated in their lovely patio. Started off with guacamole, it was fine. When it came to our lunches my friend asked if he could have a pizza half pepperoni half BBQ chicken. We were told you can't do half pizzas when they have different sauces. What? He explained he didn't care if the topping ventured onto the wrong sauce (BBQ/tomato) and the kitchen refused. Then came my brilliant order of the Hawaiian poke stack. At this time, an alarm should have sounded in my brain \"Rachel! It's ahi tuna! It's raw! It takes skill and quality to create a sublime product and your at a chain!\". Instead my tummy prevailed, and what I got  was a stringy, chewy, tough, pile of butchered fish. 
Lesson learned, when hungry and if you wind up at a chain, pause, think, then order.
I do want to mention the staff is great and this in no way reflects on them."}
{"text":"It's all about the sweet potato fries and onion rings here!  A good place to have dinner while watching a sporting event.  Oh and they have a good selection on beers."}
{"text":"Personally we had a negative experience here. It was one of those food was good but service sucked situations. Waiter didn't see us and we sat there 10 mins before a manager acknowledged us. Then the waiter had a negative attitude after that. Kinda ruined it but the food is decent and for being in Vegas prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Stopped in for my girlfriends birthday around 430PM on a Tuesday and were quickly seated. 

Service was good although one person sat us, another got our waters, another brought out beers, another brought our food, and another waited on us in between...

We ordered 4 apps. Chicken nachos, crab cakes, eggs rolls, and ham/pineapple pizza. Plenty of food to bring almost the entire pizza home. Everything was delicious and fattening except the nachos. Well, the nachos were fattening but not good. I think they made them before everything else and sat under a heat lamp. The nacho plate was mega hot while all other plates physically warm. The main problem was that the cheese was congealed and literally glued to the nachos. They weren't ooey gooey like we had hoped. Are about 1/4 of them and threw rest of way bc we didn't want to fight with them. Waste of money.

Nonetheless, service was friendly, consistent, and menu very large which appeals to all normal. I will and would stop back again..."}
{"text":"Ordered the lobster, shrimp, and crab pasta tossed in oil/butter/parmesan. The pasta was perfectly coded. The shrimp were large and was surprised to see a nice size chunk of lobster in it as well. Was very happy with my meal and the service (Tyler). 

My brother had the appetizer portion of chicken nachos. I had a few and they were exceptional and layered perfectly. Enough for two people. 

My mom ordered some type of fish. The portion was small and she eventually was sick the entire night (stomach). Cant legit confirm it was from the meal although she was ill a few hours later."}
{"text":"I could not have received a warmer welcome from the bar staff at yard house- 
Bar Staff includes not
Limited too:
-Jocelyn
-Ray
-Oz
-Deanna
- I apologize who I missed I just haven't been formally introduced!

They have been nothing but hospitable and great- by far my go to bar- also the patrons are great - this isn't a typical vegas bar although it's in a casino, I feel like I'm on the east coast!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I love their food, I love their drinks, I've never had a problem with their wait staff, they have always been fun and hospitable and just over all friendly. However, every. single. time. I call in to see if they are taking reservations or if I can be placed on the call ahead waiting list, I am met with attitude from their hostesses. I understand they are probably sick of answering the same questions day in and day out but it's something called a first impression and you are failing your business miserably."}
{"text":"I was really surprised by this place; we came here off the cuff, and it impressed me. 

One cool element is the bar; the bar's taps are fed by overhead, chilled pipes out of which flows many types of alcoholic ambrosia. In addition, the food was quite good as was the service. We went on a weekend day, so it was a bit busy, but all in all, we had a really fine experience and I'd go back in a heartbeat. 

For those that don't know, this is one of the new eateries located in Crocker Park in Westlake, and may I say, it's worth the trip!

So, if anyone asks you where you're going, just tell em \"I'm going out in the Yard (house), be back later!\" :)"}
{"text":"Their alcohol selection is UH-MAZE-ING!

There are pages upon pages of beers, wines, and cocktails to choose from. It makes it really hard to choose one. Two cocktails that I have had here before were the BIKINI TINI which has cruzan banana rum, cruzan pineapple rum, pineapple juice, dekuyper pomegranate and the HAWAIIAN SUNSET that has
cruzan black cherry rum, cruzan pineapple rum, dekuyper island punch & razzmatazz, citrus agave. Both were BOMB and well-made!

The only food items that I have had here was a couple bites of fries that were shared with me and the [MAC + CHEESE]² that has chicken, bacon, wild mushrooms, cheddar, parmesan, truffle oil. The fries were crispy! The mac was heavenly. 

From the two times that I have been to Yard House, each time has been clean and the staff friendly. I'd love to come back and keep trying all the food and drinks on their billions of pages. Haha!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Yard House, but this one was a huge miss.
Ordered the Spicy Tuna Roll but sub in the Poke Ahi and also a Chopped Salad.
The tuna roll came out first, but had the regular spicy tuna in it. Once I pointed it out to the bartender, he quickly whisked it away and had the kitchen fix it.
After finishing that dish, I inquired about the salad (having seen that it was not on the printed ticket in front of me). He went to the kitchen to check on it, and came back to say it had been sitting in the window, so he was having them make a fresh one for me.
When the chopped salad finally came out, it had romaine lettuce in it...which, if you've never had their chopped salad, is very out of place. It normally has no lettuce (and is spelled out on the menu without lettuce).
When I asked the manager (who was apologetic about the tuna roll) about it he said they got so many people asking to add lettuce, that they decided to just add it to all the chopped salads, but it could be ordered without it. I told him that was a bad move, gat lettuce messed up the salad.
Won't be going back to this location."}
{"text":"I would love to write more stars. Our server was great and I really enjoyed her as our server. I was here visiting my boyfriend for a few days and dec9ded to go in for happy hour to.enjoy the happy hour fun. I ordered  a ketle martini and mushroom wraps also some garden wings my bf ordered a few beers and a pizza. When it came out it was delicious but when I went to bite my wraps there was a black long beatle that crawled from under neath one of the lettuce wraps and I'm not going to lie i spit out my food and almost threw up, I am actually a vegan and have a very sensitive stomach I just couldn't believe how gross you can at least check the lettuce before serving. A Mgr came by said don't worry he would take care of it when I got the bill I of course had a 35 dollar ck. My wings drink and his food was still on it. Not like it matters but it kinda does, I would think it would be alil more compensated. I still of course took care of everything the server as its not her fault there was bugs in their food but I literally didn't eat anything after that I just didn't feel like they cared. Please be more caring and understanding of your customers"}
{"text":"Love this place. My husband and i eat here all the time and it is really kid friendly. Beer is amazing and their pineapple express even better. try the crusted halibut you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Have you ever been to a place that had an overwhelming menu?  Yard House was that place for me.  It took me forever to peruse the menu, and then there were 140 beers on tap to choose between.  Phew!  

I feel like everything we ordered was just OK.  Nothing really wow'ed me, which I feel might not be the case if they had a smaller menu where they could focus on making a few great dishes.  Drew ordered the regular mac & cheese which was nothing special.  I ordered the lunch duo with a margarita pizza and their ranch salad.  I really enjoyed the salad, not so much the pizza.  The salad was filled with the most random stuff!  It had sliced brussels sprouts, corn, pistachios, sunflower seeds, croutons, and was topped (of course) with ranch.  My colleague ordered the chicken enchilada stack and it is beautifully plated.  She let me try a bit and I had food envy the rest of the meal.  

Overall, it was a nice place to eat and sit outside for lunch, but I wouldn't expect to be blown away by what you order."}
{"text":"I come to town square and yard house all the time, I left to go to the bathroom and my $1000 sunglasses were stolen. No one was sitting near us as we were outside so I'm 90% sure it was a busser and/or server who took them. Manager didn't do anything but take my number and say he'd call me if they popped up. Ridiculous. No where they could have gone in 2 minutes and didn't talk to busser or anything."}
{"text":"Everything was awesome as always, super packed but we got in quickly! Food was amazing, it's always a LOT of food which was lunch for the next day ;)  This place is loud but fun atmosphere and always good service!"}
{"text":"We go here a lot. Food and drinks are always good here! Services usually pretty good but sometimes that wait to be seated is just too long. But you can eat at the bar which is good and you can eat outside.   Last night we had the tuna poke appetizer which is always very good!"}
{"text":"Love to be anti-chain on Yelp sometimes, but this place is really good. Great clean atmosphere in Vegas. Right in a nice new part of town. Not too many drunk people or smoke.
Food is very good quality. The Poke Nachos were out of this world. They had me doing the hula. Burger was delicious. Plus they had vegan options like sweet and sour \"chicken\". Of course tons of beer on tap to tickle your fancy. 
Get away from the craziness of the strip and enjoy a pleasant meal for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"GO!

Call me crazy, but this is currently my favorite restaurant! The food, oh the food, is absolutely superb! Not your typical bar food. I would recommend the seared ahi and surf and turf burger! You will not leave this place hungry. Oh, and did I mention they serve beer? Not just beer, but every craft beer you could think of! I believe there are over 160 beers on tap. A beer lovers paradise!  Bartenders that actually give a shit and servers that aren't on their phones all night, meaning they actually do their jobs, and do it well. Perfect ambiance for a quick drink and a bite, or a nice date night. Damn, now I'm hungry!"}
{"text":"They have a shameless practice that if you send something back they will charge you anyway but try and give you a f'ing gift card and still charge you for the stuff you sent back. 
A stupid dopey chain.... do yourself a favor and don't go."}
{"text":"I went on a date (heyyyyy) to Yard House and I wasn't sure if it would be a place I would like. It's a fancy sports bar with a twist of foods. I had the Lobster and aparagus burger and a mexican chicken and shrimp dish which was absolutely wonderful!!!

The array of beers were to die for! So many flavors and great happy hour specials!
I will return!"}
{"text":"Great location, awesome menu options.  And wow the beer is a amazing, so many options! Staff is on point,  everything came out fresh. hot,  and was delicious. Recommend  the Halibut, any seafood dish, ahi  nachos, just about  everything  is not going to disappint. Great place!!!"}
{"text":"If you haven't tried the Yard House, give them a try. They have several HOUSE specials and great selection of beers. We had Orange Chicken, which had a good spicy kick, Pasta n Sprimp had spinach noodles which added a great flavors, and the fish n chips, had a nice breading with a juicy flavor.  They were all very tasty and the service was pretty fast. There's a huge beer list several seasonal beers and even a sampler option. Also, they have a nice atmosphere with a patio outside...which is nice right now when the weather isn't too hot."}
{"text":"Sergio has horrible horrible service!!! my family and I always come to this location an, never disappointed. this time however we had terrible service. he always seemed he was in a hurry to leave the table. Also, we would have to ask for everything!! refills, take empty plates out the way, we would need the check and etc. the most disappointing part about this whole visit was that in the very begging I asked him to please bring a cake out to our table when it came close to finishing up our meal. Not only did it take for ever for us to get to go boxes an the check he forgot about the cake!!! My 9 year old niece understood things happen sometimes (birthday girl), which was ok. but I was more upset at the fact that he asked me right before he dropped the check if we were ready for him to bring out the cake... he never brought it!!!The cake never came out!! Which should've been no surprise because he had an attitude the whole time. I also work in the food n bev industry so I always understand if it is busy how it can be overwhelming for the server. It was not busy when we were dining in at all! Only reason I'm giving it a one star is because the food was actually good. Sergio is a horrible server. With no patience, attitude problem, and lack of menu knowledge. No longer will I arrive to this location. Btw if Sergio doesn't like his line of work than maybe it's time for him to get diff job. Not my fault u don't like your job."}
{"text":"I don't usually go to sit-down, chain restaurants, but when I do it's going to be the Yard House.

We had a gift card so we'd figure we'd try it out one Sunday. Our snobbiness was only heightened when we saw both the drink and food menus -- there were tons of options that could only be rivaled by the biblical size of The Cheesecake Factory's menu. How could the staff be able to perfect this many options? I don't know how but everything we tried was fresh, well-seasoned and nicely composed.

First the atmpsphere -- it's like 75 percent sports bar but the lights are real low so it also can have a romantic vibe to it.

I started out drinking an \"Old 43\" -- one of their, like 5 or 6 takes on an Old-Fashioned (I told you their menu is massive). It was perfectly mixed with no one ingredient overwhelming the others. It included a Spanish liquor called \"Licor 43\" that offered hints of vanilla and spice to go with the orange. Jeannene went with a Cucumber Citrus Tonic and had no complaints. For our second drinks we both had the amazing \"Old 43.\"

For the appetizer, we went with the guac and chips. The guacamole was freshly made -- creamy with diced tomato and sprinkled cheese (queso fresco, I think) on top. The lightly salted chips also seemed to have been made in house as they were still warm but no hint of grease.

I must have been in more of a Mexican mood than I thought as I had the Baja Tacos. Again everything was fresh with the fish having a light crispiness, having been pulled out of the fryer at just the right time. The vegetables added a nice crunch and the aioli provided some heat. A big pile of rice (surprisingly spicy) and a ramekin of beans added nicely to the meal. I then helped Jeannene eat her sweet potato fries (not limp and greasy nor burnt to a crisp) while she worked on her burger that also looked delicious.

We'll definitely be going back to make some more headway on that menu."}
{"text":"I heard only good things of this restaurant. The food was amazing but the service definitely needs to be better. My server would disappear. After the water he took about 15 min to come back an serve us. After our food took a long while to come out, the server not once asked if we needed anything. I would recommend The Yard House because of the food but they definitely have to work on their service."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to enjoy a good selection of beer on tap and great food. Its always busy so be patient. I have yet to order something i havent liked."}
{"text":"Beer, beer and more beer! Over 100 different choices my friends. They make their own beer and it's lovely. But I wasn't in the mood to think because I walked around Town Square all day, so I just ordered a Shock Top (Tastes like a lighter version of Blue Moon). 

The fellas ordered pizzas and the gals ordered nachos and all the food was excellent. The service was great even though it was extremely busy. The staff is extremely efficient and friendly and they're open to making suggestions based on what you like. We had a few more drinks and dessert was ordered and shared by the entire group. 

Excellent experience. The place was very large and very lively. I would definitely make a stop here again!"}
{"text":"we went to yardhouse during happy hour.. (which btw ends at 6 pm) and had a bunch of appetizers and a couple 1/2 yard tall ass beers.  lienen keugals... (sp?)  to be exact.. (tastes and smells like fruity pebbles!)  food was good.. i think we had like pizza and cali rolls....... a lot of beer.. so i forget. HAHAHA.. good.  good prices for happy hour... pretty pricey after happy hour.  hahaha.."}
{"text":"This is a nice people watching spot centrally located in the upscale center of Desert Ridge. If you go, you'll want to sit on the patio. Inside is very dark and busy. Has a wide gastro pub menu, something for everyone. Big portions. Big beer list. Nice place for a bite before or after a movie."}
{"text":"love the yardhouse. bartender Steve does a great job, thanks man. the happyhour offers more than the average. its pretty slow @ the scottsdale location, so service never fails. been to a yardhouse in every city my wife and I travel and we are never disappointed. well done for consistently."}
{"text":"The service is excellent here!  We had an awesome waiter (sorry forgot his name).  We ate our share and drank our share of sangrias.  They make good sangrias and it's NOT very strong nor weak.   They only offer 2 types of sangrias and we tried both of them.  
The chicken wrap I ate is as a dinner rather than an appetizer, it was just as good as PF Chang's chicken wrap.
The bacon hamburger was done just right.  The meat which we requested well-done."}
{"text":"A pretty solid place, great for a cooldown in summertime or a night out.

The living room is nice and dark, feels cozy and not in your face. Serving staff is friendly and attentive.

The appetizers are surprisingly large, I shared the nachos with my GF and it was enough for us both. They also make a really good tuni sashimi, I wasn't so sure about it at first, but it was delicious.

If you like beer you'll go crazy...the serving sizes are massive and it is like swimming in it, great choices, and good local drafts too.

A good upscale-casual hangout in the scottsdale mall area. Recommended."}
{"text":"This restaurant has quickly become one of our favorites while we are in Las Vegas. Everything we had was delicious. The choices were numerous. The drink selection, especially for you beer drinkers, was crazy large. The waitress was very knowledgeable of the different foods despite only working here for two weeks. We will definitely be back again to try the other items on the large menu."}
{"text":"Love Yardhouse! I have been to various Yarhouses around town and their food and service are pretty consistent. Not the best service every time but overall no major complaints. 

Love their happy hour menu, delicious food, great portion and for cheaper. 
Nachos, huge portion and delicious, perfect for sharing. Loaded with bean, cheese, chicken, jalepeno, sour cream, pico, guac... the goods!! 
Shitake Garlic Noodle - smaller portion, good for one - very good.. not crazy garlicky. 
Hummus - they have a chili oil type on top that adds such great flavor to the hummus, but not spicy at all. 
Fried Calamari is delicious - decent portion, crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside, the aioli that it comes with is delicious. 
ABSOLUTE FAV: Firecracker wings - these have a little kick to them, salty and sweet at the same time - great flavors - a must try!
Chicken Lettuce Wrap - pretty big portion, good for sharing - 3 options for sauce - all very good!
The Seared Ahi sandwich is so good.. I'm usually not a sandwich person but I will eat this one any day. 
Mac & Cheese - not for kids - truffle oil and wild mushroom - so good...

I can go on and on and on because I have tried most of the items on their menu - but these are the ones I always go back to!"}
{"text":"Yard house definitely deserves at least 4 stars.

We chose happy hour egg rolls for our appetizer at the beginning of the meal. The protein was a bit unseasoned but the remaining ingredients kept them highly afloat.

I ordered the surf and turf burger: butterflied lobster atop the patty. The burger was magnificent though cooked well instead of medium well as requested. The lobster atop didn't retain much flavor and took away from the deliciousness of the burger itself. The onion rings were an additional charge ($1) but were well worth the money, having a beautiful not-too-greasy fry. 

My wife ordered the Mac and Cheese - most popular item. This was also delicious, but again, the added protein seemed a bit unnecessary. The chicken inside wasn't to die for though the bacon, noodles and sauce were. The side salad she ordered was large in portion and quite tasty as well. 

The unsweetened tea was delicious and I don't like unsweetened tea much. It had several floral hints adding a refreshing touch. 

The server was friendly and prompt. 

Aside from a lack of seasoning in the added proteins I would give 5 stars. The atmosphere was modern slash bar but comfortable for all ages. The booths were large and comfortable as well. The ceiling was lined in brewing pipes. The lighting was perfect. 

Our ticket came out to $52 in addition to the  $12 tip.

Definitely worth the money!"}
{"text":"Always a good place to come eat dinner at any time and day good service and the beer selection is always amazing! And the happy hour is the best you can't beat it ! #YH"}
{"text":"I really like the Yard House happy hour. With over 100 beers on tap anyone can find a beer that they love. I had a few different IPAs that are hard to find. I ordered nachos, pizza and bomb egg roll things. If you are at the Linq, Yard House is the spot. The original Yard House in Long Beach is the Icon!"}
{"text":"I love yard house! This is he type of place I don't mind waiting 45minutes to be seated if it's busy. The food and drinks are delicious, a lot to choose from. I recommend their macaroni and cheese, chicken pot pie, or BBQ buffalo chicken salad. I've never left the place unsatisfied! Service is relatively fast and good as well."}
{"text":"Absolutely our favorite.  We eat here at least 40 times already.  They have two location one at Red Rock Casino and one at town Square.  If you are picky about the food, the food at Red Rock is slightly better than the one at town square so is the service.  Happy hour is from 3-6 pm Monday to Wednesday.  Late Happy hour is after 11 pm til 2 am Sunday to Wednesday.  We recommend the BBQ chicken pizza, Blue Crab Cakes, Jamaican Jerk Wings, Chinese Chicken lettuce wrap, Turkey Slider Not burger, Fried Calamari, Try Most of the happy hour appitizer they are pretty damn good.  Outside of the happy hour menu, the food is pretty good and a little expensive for what it's worth to us.  Beer Seletction here is ridiculous!  Something like over 100 different one.  They have TV all around with sport channel usually showing so this is great for all those that watch sports."}
{"text":"5 stars!

Casey is the bomb!

Awesome.  Had a GREAT time today.
Here for a conference and so we came here for lunch.
Menu was extensive.  Service was first class.  Server was awesome but so was everyone there!  Everyone was really great.  We had a server but other people were around and SO helpful and nice.  

The food was bomb!  And yes, I have been to a Yardhouse before but this one was great!

I had a juicy, greasy turkey burger with a side salad that covered the whole plate.  Yum.

Rest of table had the mediterranean flat bread- really good and light- and a tuna salad.  Everything was great.

We are coming back tomorrow for lunch we were so impressed!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time ( To Arizona) to watch our Dodgers in spring training. The place was packed and a 30 min wait. Witch I expected being a Saturday. Our waitress was real friendly and happy to take our order. Once our order came in ( a family of 6) it came in waves. From one person to another it was about 15 min. Then my kids fries did not come in with there meal. They had to wait a extra 10 to 15 minutes for the fries and by then there food was cold. I ordered my burger medium rare and came in over well done. With past experience at the Yard House ( Chino Hills and Irvine Ca.) I always had good service but not this time. It takes a lot for me to write a negative review. But it's the truth. The place was clean and friendly service."}
{"text":"Yard House is a great sports style restaurant with really good food and an unbelievable extensive draft beer selection at a very reasonable price point. Excellent service and ambiance."}
{"text":"This place used to be so much better. Now the kitchen is churning out mass quantities of food with no care or quality. If located in a lesser location, this restaurant would not survive. The food comes out way too sloppy and rushed for the $12+."}
{"text":"Went to Yard House to celebrate a birthday. It took forever for a waiter to take our order. Our waiter hardly checked on our table. Ordered the poke stack; not worth it. There's more \"salad\" thank poke."}
{"text":"I asked my buddy where I could acquire a delicious dark beer last night, and immediately was told to get to the Yard House because they serve at least 100 different beers from all over the world. I had also never been here before, so there was no argument from me.. 

I saw the Chocolate Stout on the menu and BAM, my mind was made up. It was such a perfect decision too.. definitely recommend trying it. Being adventurous, I also had their Orange Blossom Cream Ale and a Lindeman's Framboise. Interesting combination I know, but YUM. 

Onto the food -  we started with the Grilled Korean BBQ beef, (boneless beef short ribs marinated in garlic, soy and brown sugar with jasmine rice, sesame spinach, carrots, bean sprouts and green onions) - very good, great flavor, nice portion, could even be ordered as your main course IMO. For my entree I had the Mushroom Lettuce Wraps, (stir fried, smoked tofu, pine nuts and green onions with three dipping sauces and shiitake & portabella mushrooms), also very good, and healthy!! My friend ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken which had a mushroom sauce, sun-dried tomatoes and garlic mashed potatoes. Not my first choice, but it was very tasty and the mashed potatoes were so creamy, my mouth is watering thinking about them! For Dessert I had the Youngberry Chocolate which is Lindeman's Framboise & Young's chocolate Stout together (since both were delicious, I had to try them together, naturally). Prices ranged from reasonable to pretty expensive, the drinks were definitely in the very expensive range, as reflected in our well over $100 tab.. I will definitely be returning for happy hour one of these days for the lower drink prices. Service was great, bathrooms were super clean, all in all, I am a fan!!"}
{"text":"Great place. The food here is outstanding. It's a pretty new place as well. Located near the Flamingo hotel. The customer service was great. Our waiter was awesome. On top of the great service he made the dinner even better with his humor. Chatted with us throughout the meal and made sure we were taken care of. 

You can eat inside or out. They have heaters outside. It's on a balcony. You take an elevator up. Bathrooms however are on the first floor. Portions are big. You can share 2-3 people. The tortilla soup is to die for. Best I ever had! 

Must try this place! Will be back the next Time i come out here! So good!"}
{"text":"Seriously just can't go wrong with Yard House! Ive never been to one that I didn't like. The service is always great and so is the food!"}
{"text":"Went for a beer and some appetizers and was not disappointed. 

Cool atmosphere with a good variety of people. Servers were funny and they all interacted with us. 

Best happy hour I've been to in a while. Definitely going back again."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant on Earth at the moment.  The food is great, diverse menu for my foodie wife and great kids food too.  Service is oddly perfect, consistent, fast.  I'm baffled, and delighted.  Where has this place been all my life?  Try knee deep ipa."}
{"text":"can't go wrong - great food, extensive menu, huge beer selection, flat screens everywhere..."}
{"text":"A business associate and I went here for lunch today and we were both very disappointed.

The waiter took way too long to initially come to the table and ask if we wanted drinks. It's not like he was swamped. The restaurant only had about a half-dozen tables occupied and he didn't have but one besides us.

My friend had the Korean BBQ Beef which had more fat than edible beef.

I had the Enchilada Stack, which was okay but definitely not worth the $16.75 they get for it.

It's too bad because the atmosphere is very business friendly, too bad the food and service are so poor."}
{"text":"I love the yard house. The food is really good and nachos are fantastic!
It's very busy on the weekend but the service is great as usual."}
{"text":"This is a great place. I had the spicy chicken sandwich which was delicious. Also they have a Ruby Red Moscow mule which is one of a kind! I will definitely go there again. The service is awesome and the waiting staff is very friendly and helpful"}
{"text":"After checking in our room at the Flamingo, we went to the Linq looking for some eats.  We came in for beer and appetizers...being 110 degrees outside, the outdoor seating was just fine.  It was shaded, covered, and plenty of air circulation from the ceiling fans.  You can order a YARD of beer which = 3 beers hence this being Yard House.  I just ordered a pint.  Many things looked great on the menu but my friends and I split three appetizers - spinach & cheese dip, wings, and lettuce wraps.  It was plenty to hold us over for the time being and very good.

We got seated quick, our service was very great as well.  I can't speak for full meals here but it's a great drinks & appetizers place, and I do believe they have a happy hour during the week as well."}
{"text":"I had never been to the Yard House and was really shocked. I had been reading reviews for burgers and this place was rated quite well. At $15 for a burger which was the cheaper on the menu ambiance didn't even come into my mind. I thought a median to high menu it would be casual dining. But it's a full blown sports pub. I went in with my friend on his birthday at about 6pm on a Thursday. It was packed. So loud we were yelling in each other's faces at the table to be heard. Sports streaming on tvs all over. We're both quiet people. It was way too much going on. I felt like i was trying to have a meal in the middle of a club. My waitress repeatedly had to have me repeat my order because she couldn't hear. Super simple 2 bacon cheddar burgers one medium one medium well. When we got our burgers as far as the burger went mine looked fine except for the bun. The bottom bun was sopping wet. Like I mean it was barely a bun anymore. I usually only send food back if it's really bad. I took one bite and there was so much juice dripping onto the plate it was becoming soup and the bun was like a wet sponge and I was one bite in. It had obviously sat on the bun waiting for some time. Nothing on the plate was hot. The burger was luke warm. The fries were dry and somehow cold and seemed old and over cooked. The waitress brought the burger back to get a new bun. We waited.  And waited. My friend was more than half done once my burger returned. So I awkwardly ate my burger alone while he stared at me because he was done. The manager came over and was very nice and apologized. But I waited a solid ten minutes or more just to get my plate back with a new bun.  We ordered as soon as we sat because it was so packed and even at that waited quite awhile. My burger was now somehow half the size and now cooked a very dry well done. No more juice for sure and the bacon was like leather. I ate it because I hadn't eaten all day and I was starving. I asked the waitress if they had put the burger back on the grill to keep it warm while they got the other bun or something. She said no. Clearly they had. I pushed the fries around the plate which were mostly just shriveled up and looked like they were the end bits. Lots of crumbs and well...end bits when you get to the last fries before you dump them and make a new batch. My friend ate some as he commented repeatedly how starving he was while simultaneously commenting on how gross they were at the same time. His burger he said was actually very good. His looked good. Cooked the way it was supposed to be no soggy bun. The fries were nasty on both accounts. Cold and yet way over cooked, mealy, nasty. The manager ended up comping my meal and we had mentioned to the waitress it was my friends birthday and we were disappointed with the meal. She asked if we wanted a birthday dessert but by now we both kind of just wanted to get the hell out of there. She said we could take a to go so we did. He got chocolate cake to go. It was just a little two bite desert. It wasn't a full size. It came in a little tiny cup you put condiments in. He said it was good but it was a sample size like what they give out at the grocery. Again sort of odd. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I use to live and work about five minutes from here.  Amazing beer selection, I think I probably got around to trying a third of them before moving to AZ, where I also happen to live about 10 minutes from a yard house.  Loved its location connected to the Red Rock Casino allowed for a great way to start a weekend. Food is overall real good.  Bar is beautiful and staff is awesome.  My only negatives are it can get quite noisy if you're trying to hang out with people and even at happy hour their prices are a bit high.  But your paying for selection and quality I suppose."}
{"text":"Pretty typical fare in this location. I still can't rate too high because they charge 6 bucks plus a pint of beer. The chicken enchilada stack is full of white meat chicken, beans, cheese and comes with two different sauces. The BBQ chicken pizza is plaqued by too sweet BBQ sauce, but the large slabs of chicken help make up for that issue. Still, one of the better and more reliable chains around the nation."}
{"text":"Yard House is always a good decision. They are consistent with their food and drinks. You can't go wrong with anything from their menu! What made me write this review is because we had an amazing server. His name is Celal (I hope I spelled that correctly!). His service was great! He made sure our water cups was always full, and he came to check on us regularly but without being overwhelming. All restaurants need someone like Celal! Anyways, if you're looking for something casual, good food and drinks, Yard House is the place to be."}
{"text":"Waited 25 minutes for our food for 4 people; two burgers and two orders of chicken tenders. Food came out- all cold. Needless to say we weren't happy, so when the manager came over with the missing fries from the one order, we told him we were leaving.  He asked to make our food again; by this time it was over 30 minutes from when we ordered.  Can only imagine how long a second order would take.  He acted very surprised that we wanted to leave.  He asked if he could give us a gift card.  We were starving and wanted to go and get food, so we declined. Bummer cause we brought 2 people from out of town with us.  How embarrassing. Never will be back and such a shame that we live about 4 minutes away too."}
{"text":"OK, so I have been to Yardhouse a handful of times, and for some reason, every time I eat there, I feel/get sick later on.  ugh!  I would say they have one hell of a happy hour.  I would go here for beers and maybe an appetizer... other than that- I would never feel the need to be there!"}
{"text":"What an amazing time!!!!! We went a few days ago with my family and friends and let's just say, John made our experience an amazing one! His knowledge, his personality and his excitement for what he does really shows! The food was bomb and the beer selection was on point! We will be back to see John and have great beer while we now make this our number one go to place when we go out!!!! This location beats any location in California as that is where we are from! Great job John. 
P.S my father owns his own restaurant out here, I won't mention the name but we tried stealing John from this place but he thanked us and told us he was very satisfied with where he was in the most polite way possible!"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience here, and this is my first feedback...

After the best concert I've seen in decades, we spent the night within walking distance of Yard House, and there we arrived for lunch the next day. We each ordered a Bloody Mary, and encountered a teachable moment: Never entered my mind to say, \"Hold the bacon,\" and never entered the mind of the server to mention that \"There might be a slab of pig in your drink.\" No harm, no foul.

Fully planning to depart with plenty of leftovers, we ordered enough to keep the kitchen busy for weeks. Here I'd like to recognize Chelsea for patience and an easy manner. Upon ordering a particular dish, she recommended an alternative instead; let the record show that we wholeheartedly agree with her call. She was very attentive without being intrusive, and when all was said and done, her dessert *advice* was solid. Chelsea, you rock.

Thanks, Yard House, you've never let us down."}
{"text":"Beer. That is the only word you need to know when reading this review. 

They have BEER. Boy, do they have beer. Did I mention they have beer? 

Also, you will become a raging alcoholic after your first visit. Because you will want to try every beer here until you have succeeded. You can do it! Just kidding, you'll never be able to.

I suppose this place has other things outside of Delirium Tremens, I just don't care about it. No, that's not true, their salads are excellent as is most of their other food (I've never gotten something I didn't like), but I really go mainly for the beer. As if you couldn't tell that at this point.

The atmosphere is awesome, the waitstaff are attentive and quick. They must know I don't want to wait for my beer. 

This place is beer heaven, everything else is just bonus, baby."}
{"text":"I like the yard house. I would recommend taking a date to this place; It's casual. The place is a little too dim, though. 
The food is a tad bit overpriced, but the food tastes amazing. I would recommend the chicken enchilada that comes in a circular cut out instead of the traditional tortilla rolls with the stuff in the middle.
Comes with green and red sauce. So. Good. Drinks are expensive as well and could use a little more alcohol. Service is okay, but could be a little more attentive.
Either way, I like this place."}
{"text":"I had a late lunch with my friend here . Ordered clam chowder soup chicken wing and  pepperoni  pizza .everything was delicious and our service was friendly !! I will come back again ..."}
{"text":"I kind of, sort of, eh, love this place. I mean, I could REALLY love this place if they had different kinds of Chimay and maybe the food came out hot. Just saying.

I love the warm vibe of this place, but it is a chain so they don't really have time to chat and get to know you at the bar. I don't believe I've ever had a conversation with any of the bartenders at any YH I've ever been to now that I think about it. Odd. 

The menu is large, but again, doesn't stray far from the standard bar fare you find at most places like this. It lacks authenticity and the flavors are generally all muted. 

Had THE best server; Jordan, and she took great care of us last night. They first sat us right next to the kitchen (I cannot believe they have booths right there!), but the clanging of pots and all the noise soon had me begging for anywhere but there. I specifically asked if, when we moved, they could still let Jordan wait on us because she is THE girl. She is personable, complimentary (my fave thing about her - hehe) and quick. If she couldn't get to me she delegated and got me what i needed immediately (we did move far away from her section and she was so nice about it!). 

The beer flowed and it was good, but again, I'm particular to a certain brand that they don't have so I wasn't THAT happy, just moderately so. :)  The food was another story. Ordered the lettuce wraps with chicken and the chicken was barely warm and the sheen from the grease all over it made me a little ill, but that's okay, the calamari was worse. It was practically frozen. I was so disappointed because usually it's really good. We would have changed it, but we were starved. We also order the street tacos (asada and fish) and they were good, but for some reason instead of using corn tortillas to at least offer up some authenticity, they used this weird flatbread-tasting stuff. No bueno. 

Oh well, it's a great place to socialize and the people are pretty here so it wasn't an all-together horrible experience. The bathrooms are super clean and the lighting is great for selfies so no complaints there. I'll probably always come here, it's just the way it is."}
{"text":"The food we had at Yard House was awesome but the service we received was wanting.

Our servers name was Ray and It has been years since I gave a small tip but I only left a 10% tip and a note saying the service was poor.

What happened:
1. For our appetizer it appeared he dropped a significant portion of the Calamari on the floor and had sloshed all the sauces out of their dishes.
2. I had asked for a half yard of beer and they brought out a pint.
3. We had to waive him down every time we needed something including drink refills.
4.  Their was a table with six young ladies that he spent an exorbitant amount of time to the detriment of good service to the other customers.

We will go to Yardhouse again but not if he is our server"}
{"text":"Have always had a great experience here until tonight.  Server was not attentive , another server took our order , but it was messed up, appetizer never came and one dinner was wrong. Took another twenty minutes to get the right sandwich. Would have been nice to at least get an apology"}
{"text":"Food and service was fantastic! Sweet potato fries with bacon cinnamon sauce is heaven! We had a party of 6 and the Bill came with each persons order seperated...yet all on 1 Bill!!! Loved it"}
{"text":"Food is just OK, awesome beer selection and good happy hour deals plus a reverse happy hour after 10 PM.  If you want awesome steaks spend the extra money and go to T-Bones in Red Rock.

{"text":"Usually this place is really good in LA but came here around 6pm and sat at the bar and literally wasn't greeted for over 15 minutes. I love Yard House but you would think in Las Vegas with the ample demand for liquor they would be on their A game but sadly, no."}
{"text":"Love the tacos, tortilla soup is the best, good beer selection. The only reason I gave 4 stars is due to a snotty know it all waitress that served my group. Everyone else has been awesome. Can't remember her name or I'd put her on blast."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! they have the most amazing tortilla soup!  and the happy hour has got to be the best bang for your buck! Chicken nacho's is a huge portion and so is pretty much all the other apps....hope you enjoy!"}
{"text":"It's another Yard House. It resembles the other locations. I still prefer the Town Square location. The staff here seem to be less friendly and less attentive. And the wait always seems to be longer too. When our server asked if we wanted separate checks, and we said yes, a 20 minute debacle ensued as she had no clue who had ordered what. Not enjoyable. The ambiance here is the same as any other Yard House. The food and beer is the same too. (Duh, it's a chain.) I like that the beers rotate enough to keep things interesting. And while the beer list isn't crazy beer snob-ish, there's enough to tantalize most beer palates. And while the food isn't gourmet or necessarily crave-worthy, it's good enough to satisfy most foodies.  My particular favorites are the queso (it's actually a bit unique) and the mac 'n' cheese (it's chock full with multiple cheeses, bacon, and chicken). The bernaise sliders are also a fav. But they've stopped putting the bernaise sauce on the burgers and just serve it on the side. (Hint: The bernaise sauce makes for a nice fry dipping sauce.) Everything else I've had here has been just fine. There's been nothing I wouldn't eat. But it's also not a place I come to unless someone else suggests it. All in all, it's an a-ok spot."}
{"text":"Dropped by the bar to escape the heat, but ended staying for over an hour! The staff is amazing- very attentive. Drinks were well made. Definitely making this my go to stop every Vegas visit."}
{"text":"We went here on a soggy Saturday evening. Didn't have many other options since we were all craving different foods. The one thing we all wanted was a good pint! Yard house definitely has the best selection of local/national beers on tap as well as bottled. I had a local Papago Orange blossom and my friends tried the Rose Gaarden. All were really good and something we can't find at most places. The place was busy at 9pm and we had to wait about 10 minutes at the bar. There are lots of flat screens around to catch your favorite sports team. 

For dinner, my friends split the spicy chicken sandwich with sides of tomato soup. I had the turkey burger. Everything came out in large portions and was very satisfying! The turkey burger was well seasoned and had great sauce on it. The fries were the thin cut ones that make you feel less guilty eating them even though you end up eating more! Service was great, even though it was pretty busy. 

I'd definitely come back for happy hour or during football season. They offer happy hour all evening on monday night football nights!"}
{"text":"Other than a good location, the Yard House restaurant does not have a lot to offer in an area filled with great restaurants.  First of all our waiter, \"Garret\" was extremely un-attentive, slow and forgetful.  It was probably not his fault.  He was not familiar with the menu and forgot to deliver on simple requests aka \"water.\"  It just seemed like no one invested the time to train him.  The food here used to be creative and good - not anymore.  It is pedestrian, sloppy in appearance and flavorless - don't believe me? Order the lettuce wraps and get back to me!  We ordered mixed drinks and 5 appetizers outside of the happy hour time.  We thought that the avoiding the rush (empty restaurant) would deliver better service and good food.  We were wrong.  Sadly, the Yard House should stick to beer - the food and service needs improvement.  $120 down the drain!  All three of us agree on this review!"}
{"text":"As usual Yard house didnt disappoint, Matt was our server and did a phenomenal job and also gave me samples of other beers I might like.  Which I did- and got one to go.  This Yard House wont disappoint!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent. Delicious mushroom crusted halibut with bok choy and asparagus. The dessert was butterscotch salted caramel something or other. It was awesome. Very nice and unexpected winnner."}
{"text":"The gentleman that showed us touristy was very rude the service was horrible the menu has completely changed and was very disappointing overall with Bonne to yard house many many times and probably will not be back it is very just says flying the service and the quality"}
{"text":"This is a standard restaurant for us. A staple in our rotation. A \"it's convenient\", \"it's reasonably priced\", \"the happy hour is good\", \"I'm not craving anything in particular\", \"let's just do something easy and casual\" restaurant.

It's a good place. It's just not a great place. Everything is pretty solid. But nothing is exceptional.

The bartenders are very nice and helpful. They will give you a free sample taste of any of the draft beers. And it's a decent list of beers.

The service has always been good. Even when it is crowded and very busy, we've never had any issues with the service here.

One of my favorite go-to items on the menu is the bernaise sliders. The sliders themselves are very good. Good burgers and good buns. The bernaise sauce comes on the side. It is definitely not your standard bernaise sauce and would never hold up on a steak. But on a burger, this particular bernaise is delicious. The shoestring fries that come on the side are also great. Just the right amount of crispiness and salt.

The pizzas have also always been pretty good. Along with most of their menu items.

The wings, though, have been somewhat of a let-down. They are your typical cheap tavern wings, except they aren't cheap. Poor quality meat and not that meaty. The firecracker wings have a great sauce. Very saucy and flavorful. The buffalo wings, though, while there is a decent flavor to the sauce, is a very oily sauce. The ranch dipping sauce is well above average and pairs nicely with the wings.

The atmosphere is ok. The space and decor works. It's definitely a family-friendly place, often filled with strollers and small children. The bar area can be quite full during happy hour. Seems to be popular with both tourists and locals alike.

If you are expecting culinary greatness, you will be disappointed. If you are looking for a decent lunch or dinner after a couple of hours of shopping or before hitting a movie, this place will hit the spot. And the happy hour deals are great."}
{"text":"Well we called ahead an hour prior on Friday Dec 18 at 6:15 for a 7:15 seating. Arrived promptly at 7:15 and had another 20 minutes to wait. Not bad in my book. Ordered the Brussels Sprouts and Ripped potatoes, OMG delicious!!!! Hubby had the Pastrami deluxe sandwich which was very good and I had the Orange Peel Chicken with Spicy Rice. A little too orange for my palate but outstanding! Our waitress Trisha was knowledgeable, attentive and very friendly. Will most definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"HOPS ON TAP AND GREAT ON APPS!

We love, love, love the Yard House!!! We are beer drinkers, and the beer selection on tap is one of the best in AZ!! The menu is great & the food is always delicious! Awesome happy hour- an extensive menu to tantalize your taste buds!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday afternoon for lunch, and I was extremely underwhelmed. I have been to other Yard Houses before (love the ahi crunchy salad), but the food and service at the Scottsdale location was disappointing. They have a ton of solid beers to choose from, and we also tried a few of their cocktails, but they all ended up being extremely sweet. 
We decided to share a bunch of appetizers: crab cakes, egg rolls, coconut shrimp, lettuce wraps, and the tuna roll. The tuna roll and egg rolls were just ok, but the coconut shrimp tasted similar to fried chicken (and not a good kind of fried chicken). It just didn't seem right. Our server may have been having a bad or slow day, but she didn't seem interested in providing a good experience for us; she walked away while we were deciding what we wanted and asking questions about the menu."}
{"text":"Pretty solid. Chain bar & it's just like the one here at home!

Great beer selection, lots of TVs but I'd recommend Twisted Kilt for the game. However, this place is very vegetarian friendly."}
{"text":"The bar is a hit or miss on service. I've waited 10 minutes to be greeted when I saw four bartenders just hanging out in the area. The beer are cocktails are a little pricey, but I dig the atmosphere of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Second time here.  Awesome experience.  The food, beer, ambiance and service were all top notch.  Not your typical sports bar.  I had the lobster noodles.....INCREDIBLE!  But the evening was really made by Mary, our server.  Friendly, attentive, knowledgeable and funny.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I really like the restaurant however the checkin is in the middle of the restaurant.. I asked my server to put my drink in a tall glass, she said no so I ask another server for an empty water glass problem solved.. Lol the the food is good the service except for the glass was good. We will be back.. Btw the had Chamay!!!"}
{"text":"I've never been a fan of stiff family brunches for Mother's day, so my husband took me here the night before.  This place is large but was fun type crowded around the bar since it was also Kentucky derby day.  We loved the sizable beer selection and the food was tasty.  I got the sweet potato fries and 2 a la carte street tacos - Korean pork belly and Korean short rib.  Not to play down the short rib but the pork belly was awesome! My husband got the buffalo wings and the Filet.  Not a spec of food was left on any plate.  The only down side was that they do not have pick your own tasters.  There are 3 pre-set selections of 6 tasters and none of them fit with my pick in beer."}
{"text":"First visit since 2012 because I was in Korea and China.
Well, I met my friends there first time since 2012 so we had many things to talk about. We had great conversations, great food, except that the server kept looking at me as if she wanted us to leave although there were many empty tables. Maybe (just assuming) the server had to go or her shift was about to over whatever, but felt very annoyed and uncomfortable.
If you have a situation to tell then just say it! 
Except that awesome!
Two thumbs up for the kitchen!

Food: good
Service: questionable
Price: good
Parking: good"}
{"text":"Great evening with my grandparents. I had the NY strip, Grandma had the halibut, and Gramps had the jambalaya... We had a great time. We had a server who was training a guy named Tom, the trainee was great. The only downside was that they were not quick to refill drinks, even after my grandpa specifically asked for consistent refills because his jambalaya was so smokin' hot. Otherwise, great time, great menu, and Tom the Trainee-- you rock!


Also: There is a super tall bartender who is amazing. On the night I found out I am mildly gluten intolerant, I went in for dinner, sat at the bar with friends and he was so attentive to us and so helpful with me for ordering a gluten free meal and beer. He also took such good care of my friends and I, even though we were probably giggly and obnoxious because we were excited to shop for Vegas. Thanks again!"}
{"text":"Giant menu for food and beer, great for vegetarians looking for a decently priced place to eat in Vegas with friends."}
{"text":"Every time I eat at Yard House, the food is just A-OK. Nothing to rave about, but nothing to really complain about either. They have a huge selection of drinks and food. The menu is large and diverse. Service is consistently A-OK as well."}
{"text":"Happy Hour! My coworkers organized a happy near my home. I was ecstatic it was going to be at the Yard House. Why? Truffle fries, of course. Because I had to pick up children, I sadly could not get an Angry Orchard Hard Apple Cider on draft. I settled for their perfectly balanced virgin strawberry lemonade. I had 2 glasses. Of course, I had my delectable truffle fries. Shoestring fries, perfectly fried, crispy on the outside with a little soft on the inside, sprinkled with Parmesan cheese, parsley, drizzled with a touch of truffle oil. My coworkers looked like they were enjoying their chicken tenders. For $1.30 more, you can convert the fries to truffle fries. Their Margherita pizza looked okay with whole cloves of roasted garlic. The portion for the chicken nachos was enormous. Wow! However, glancing over the spread, I still stick to the truffle fries because they are head and shoulders above everything else! 

P/S Arizona's beautifully cool November weather made it amazing to dine on the patio. It was truly a lovely evening with a few of my favorite educators."}
{"text":"Best place to go and relax with some friends. The outdoor seating is fantastic with super comfy chairs and couches. 

The waiting staff is always attentive and has rarely lapsed on refills or food. 

The selection of drinks is simply mind-blowing. They have something like 150 beers on tap. Try the Young's Berry. Superb drink! 

Food is varied and very good. The sliders are always a safe bet and the fries that come with them are delicious. Also they have a lettuce wrap that must be tried to be believed.

All in all a great place to go and hang out.

Make sure you go during happy hour, otherwise the price for the drinks adds up fairly quickly."}
{"text":"Just rude when you are a party of one.i asked for a table but i was enored by hostess .it was given to people that came in after me. The manger was nice my server Seth was great. But this is not my first time with the hostess .so with that said i guess you have to yell to be heard .the hostess sets the stage the mood. Seth my server was great and tried to fix the problem .But there u go the table was gone this great day i had looked forward to was gone.i do hope they tell there hostess how important they are they can make or break the mood from the start . Why oooo why do I keep going back ?  I love town square and being out side i went back to yard house this time with my daughter and my service dog when I asked for water they said no that the law said they could not give him water. Not wanting to kill the day with my daughter she just ran to the pet store and picked up a container for him to drink from . I do hope this inspires them to check out what the law is"}
{"text":"Came to yardhouse with my mom to utilize her united voucher and enjoy the yummy food!  unfortunately they didn't accept the voucher but we stayed anyway! Our server Alba went ABOVE and beyond to make our experience enjoyable. She made me a special soda drink and offered it in place of a lemonade which i initially wanted. Also gave other suggestions for food and additions. Service like this is very rare! She is definitely GM material! 5 stars to Alba and 5 for the food and drink she suggested! The manager was also kind enough to offer a small discount for the united vouxher inconvenience!"}
{"text":"Yard House-- in the middle of the street-- Yard House!

A spin off of BJ's, but without the family feel to it. It's probably one of the biggest and famous chain of restaurant slash bar slash sports bars I know of. They're not really known for anything else but the different draft beers that they serve here but since I don't drink alcohol, I wouldn't be very helpful in that department. The atmosphere right when you walk-in is of most restaurants similar to BJ's or Alehouse. You'll find your singles at the bar watching sports, the flock of females in booths wooing loudly because they're in Vegas or locals that are pretending they're tourists and still wooing loudly aka Woo Girls (c) How I Met Your Mother. And sometimes, you'll catch the party of 15 or more in the middle of the room trying to celebrate or have dinner with friends. That's us.

Yard House is pretty good about taking care of large groups. We celebrated my brother's birthday here and their service wasn't memorae but it wasn't horrible. They took our orders, gave us our food, checked on us to refill drinks, gave the check, and thanked us for coming in. Nothing out of the ordinary though. The happy hour menu (Sunday-Wednesday, 10pm-close) has a wide range of different eats! I highly recommend the garlic noodles, sliders with Bernaise sauce on the side, and the chicken wings! Superb! For something not on the happy hour is the New York steak salad. I'm not too sure how I feel about red meat on a salad because it's kind of a culinary oxymoron, but the way Yard House throws it together leaves me with some belief that there are chefs and cooks that know what they're doing in the kitchen! Comforting isn't it? 

Last notes: Call ahead if you have large groups. The weekends are extremely busy!"}
{"text":"Good food. Large selection of beer and knowledgeable servers. Very helpful. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because the beer wasn't as cold as it should be. I think it was shitting on the bar top for a while before serving it to my table."}
{"text":"The food was awesome! Getting a bunch of appetizers during happy hour is definitely the way to go! We got the calamari, onion rings, cheese curds and rack of ribs. All having different sauces and the ribs were perfect. The service was as well, awesome! Never had to get her attention for anything, she always came to check up on us. Fare warning however, it is loud and there's constantly music playing but very enjoyable & fun music."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things, about the Yard House, at Scottsdale Fashion Square.  I visited, with a friend, on Cinco de Mayo.  An odd choice, for what is essentially a \"fiesta-type-party?\"  Not if you had read (and seen) their promo email, which touted the El Picante margarita (complete with a video, showing the how it's made).  That, coupled with a description of their Vampire Taco, sold me.  They do not disappoint, on any level. Cheerfully greeted by Mixologist Sal, I told him that I wanted to see him make the El Picante.  He did an excellent job, withholding only the \"firing\" of the jalapeno garnish, explaining that those are all done, ahead of time, as a safety precaution.
A manager even came out, to further explain, citing the proximity of several very flammable substances, behind the bar.  Understood; safety first. The drink is first rate, just a tad too sweet, for me, with the agave, but Sal remedied that, on the second go-round.  The Vampire taco is delicious - one of the best I've had, anywhere - and management substituted a corn tortilla, for me, so I could stay GF.  They are most accomodating, to say the least - very genial hosts.
My friend (who is not a fan of anything spicy at all) was absolutely satisfied, with his Roast beef dip.  The sandwich came with a substantial portion of French Fries, which were the best I've had in ages.  I don't usually eat potatoes but these were way too good, to pass up.  All in all, a terrific experience and we can't wait to go back.
If you haven't tried this place, what are you waiting for/  You're in for a treat."}
{"text":"So let me start by saying the food is good. If your looking to spend time talking to friends or family though, this is not the place for you as the noise level is high. You would lose your voice by the end of the night. Menu is huge to fit every taste and the street tacos are especially tasty!  Would recommend it for eating just not socializing."}
{"text":"I have never in my 35 years of foodie adventure been to a chain that does so many things on point! 

Beer selection topping at 125 plus ten rotating seasonals that alone would make a craft beer lover swoon - but the top notch service and funky fusion food combinations slam this place into home run territory.  

The fried Brussel sprouts & ripped potatoes were the best appetizer I had probably ever ordered in my life...the crab artichoke dip was \"ok\".  I preferred to do a flight of Belgian ales - great diversity in IBUs and alcohol percentage - and tastier than only trying one. 

For dinner I chose the Nashville hot chicken plate with sweet potato hot cakes while the hubbers ordered salmon with wasabi mashed potatoes.  For dessert the waitress brought a chocolate lava style something for my birthday - good but basic - way better sounding was the s'mores brownie lol.

I can see why this place has an hour plus wait - I know I will drive the hour each way just for the brussel sprouts...not too proud to admit it!"}
{"text":"Congratulations Darden Restaurants !! You took a better quality chain of restaurants like yard house, bought it and destroyed it in less than a year !!!!!!! How does a company do this in such grand style and completeness? You are one of the few who could pull this off flawlessly and the sad part is you do not even realize it......."}
{"text":"I have VERY few options here as far as GF food & allergies and the staff have not much of a clue - they really are not gluten-free friendly at all. Takes forever to get your meal too."}
{"text":"Went here for a quick bite before heading to a show. The restaurant was packed but we were sat right as we walked in. Service and food was quick. There's so many beers to choose from it's unreal. I had a watermelon beer and it was pretty good. I got the street tacos (one beef and one fish) and they were SO GOOD! My husband got the tenders and fries which he also enjoyed. Wanted to go back a second time but we ran out of time."}
{"text":"Ok I don't usually make reviews but this was literally the worst experience at any yard house I have ever been to! First of all the servers all look miserable and very rude. It was a party of 5 and the customer service was horrendous! Apart from the service being really bad the food was served very sloppy! I'm so disappointed! I'm a regular at the yard house in the town square location and the servers are always up beat, happy, and make sure your taken care of. I ordered vampire tacos here at this yard house and they were nothing like the ones they served at town square and they were really cold. We told the manager and she didn't even apologize she just said oh ok and took them off our table and just brought new ones. My husband ordered his favorite which was lobster garlic noodle and the shrimp AND lobster were cold but we were already irritated that he just ate it because we didn't eat anything all day waiting to eat at yard house. We weren't getting refills on our drinks. We had to ask for refills every time. I'm just confused on everything that happened tonight because it was literally 11:30pm, the place was completely dead and the server was never to be found. I love yard house! I go like 3 times a week and this was the first time I came here to celebrate my friends birthday and it became a big disaster! I will NEVER be coming back to this yard house ever again!"}
{"text":"So let me just start with we had an AMAZING time! The service was great and the food came out QUICK! We ordered the wings, the carnivore pizza, ahí sashimi, the kids cheese pizza with fruit, vampire tacos, the chocolate soufflé cake, and last but not least they gave my son his happy birthday ice cream with a cute little candle! Our server Lauren L was so attentive and making sure we were taken care of and made sure our food was good and to our liking! We have never had a bad experience at the yard house in town square! The food was cooked perfect and had a lot of flavors! I recommend this place to everyone! We came for happy hour 3-6pm! We will be coming again next week god willing! Thank you yard house at town square for yet another amazing time/food/service/and amazing customer service!!!"}
{"text":"My group and I dined at this restaurant my first night back in Las Vegas, which was during the weekend, when the place was pretty busy. Although it was busy, we were able to briefly look at the menu prior to being seated (to figure out if we really wanted to eat here or not) and when we finally agreed to dine here, we were seated right away. Our waitress was a doll! She was very friendly and attentive to our needs. She also gave great suggestions on dishes to try and was knowledgeable on what was in each dish. The food was AMAZING! I was hella hungry so I ended up finishing my entire plate, plus my sister's plate, had dessert, and still had room for a couple of shots. Hahah! Love it and I would definitely dine here again whenever I'm back in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great happy hour deals! Vast selection of food and drinks. 

Love their wings -- extra crispy. Tuna roll is so unique  -- flavorful and filling. But their side of truffle fries is the best thing they have on their menu, so good it's definitely my favorite!!"}
{"text":"A tourist town with touristy restaurants, until now... What a pleasant find. New Years Eve festivities in full swing, we were glad to find an open table... Anywhere...
.
We were sat almost immediately, and introduced to George, our server for the night. I believe we may have gotten the last table, at the time, but the staff was on task. Quick with waters and menus. Made some pleasant small talk with George, and a beer sampler arrived, confirming our choice for the first half yard. Well played, George...
.
Decided on Wisconsin cheese curds (deep fried, of course), a few tacos, and an absolutely epic turkey pot pie! The cheese curds could be a meal by themselves. The turkey pot pie could be 3!
.
Wish we could stay in town longer, to try some of the other offerings... If our small sampling tonight is any indication of the overall quality, then it's impossible to go wrong. From the extensive beer list, to the quality ingredients, piping hot entrees, to the excellent wait staff, this visit was a total win.
.
Keep up the good work guys. You are doing it right. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"I eat lunch here at least once a month. Service is always great. Some of the friendliest in Las Vegas. Great fish n chips, great mac n cheese... and try the grilled artichoke if you like them, you will love it. One of my favorite places. I'd like to see more choices on the menu, but all in all, this is a great place."}
{"text":"Disappointed. We eat at the Yard House in Long Beach all the time. This location was great when they first opened...probably because they had trainers from other locations. Sat at the bar and was ignored by 6 different bartenders. The mostly male bartenders were making lots of inappropriate comments about female patrons. Gross! A few female waitresses were complaining about customers...one even said, \"I fucking hate that bitch.\" Nothing says \"comfortable\" or \"a good time\" like sexual harassment and complaining. Nothing could save this visit...poke nachos were all nachos and no poke. We order this all the time, and this location skimped on the portion of tuna. 

I gave this place 2 stars because we love our local Yard House and liked our experience other times we have come to this location. We might give this one more chance. I don't want this location to sully my typical fun time at Yard House. With so many options in Vegas, this location needs to step up their game and retrain their wait staff. It is inexcusable for bartenders to walk by and ignore guests. One guy in particular is awful. My husband asked to close out our bill, and the guy grabs the receipt from a glass and waves it in front of his face. Maybe we were supposed to hop over the bar and process our credit cards ourselves."}
{"text":"Pros:
* Delicious food. You have to try the chicken tortilla soup.
* Friendly staff.
* Modern menu and decor.

Cons:
* Expensive. The food while good is slightly too expensive.
* Due to the popularity, they're generally crowded with long waits.

I believe Town Square to be the best shopping and restaurant plaza in Las Vegas. The quantity of choices for either is only matched by the quality. There certainly is no shortage of great food at Town Square and on yelp, Yard House is rated best of them all. I haven't tried them all but I can definitely say Yard House is the best I've had yet.

I went with a group of four on a late Tuesday afternoon. They weren't busy or crowded but I have seen the line pour out the door enough times to know I was lucky. We were promptly sat down just time to enjoy the happy hour menu. We ordered their famous tower of onion rings while we sifted through the massive menu. I ordered the chicken salad with a cup of tomato bisque soup. The other members of my party ordered the barbeque chicken salad with a cup of chicken tortilla soup, pastrami sandwich, and a mushroom burger. 

When the onion ring tower arrived it instantly lived up to the expectations. Thin, lightly battered, crispy onion rings sprinkled with parmesan cheese and served with ranch and chipotle ranch. They bursted with flavor to die for. At first the tower seems so incredibly large but when you finish the memory feels small in hindsight. My soup and salad was good with a pleasant, creamy, rich ranch dressing and well-seasoned tomato bisque soup. However, it paled in comparison to the nothing short of perfect, chicken tortilla soup. I have never had a tortilla soup so creamy and flavorful. They put a large piece of avocado in the cup along with the crispy tortilla strips and large chunks of chicken. Together, they blend to create a truly wonderful and hearty cup of soup. I had a bite of the barbeque chicken salad and while it was a bit too saucy for my tastes, the barbeque dressing wasn't overpowering and went well with the large pile of onion strings atop the salad. The pastrami sandwich looked great and the burger looked even better. The burger bun instantly caught my eye with a smooth crisp surface devoid of any grease or sheen. Next time I will surely try a burger. 

The Town Square location is large and wide open. The lighting is dim and creates a hip vibe that went well with the modern menu. Everyone in my group had a few questions about the menu and the server was friendly, knowledgeable, and willing to help. The prices however are a bit steep and you might want to arrive early to take advantage of the happy hour choices. One specific item that caught my eye was the 17 dollar macaroni and cheese. It looked delicious but it would have to be at that price.

In the end I walked away satisfied and yearning to return to try a burger or maybe even that posh mac and cheese entree."}
{"text":"Great place   always great food, happy hours, beer...sports"}
{"text":"Had a great evening out at the Yard House with my Dad. Our bartenders were top notch-friendly and accommodating and genuinely happy people! I had a great glass of wine (HH is awesome and great prices) and shared a plate of nachos that were really good too! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Excellent place for food and atmosphere. I have been there twice and both times me and my husband had great service and great food . I would definitely go there again  !"}
{"text":"Yard House is definitely one of my preferred chain restaurants for Happy Hour. It's a little more high end than other places, but you can get a very good deal if you come in during HH, which is 3-6PM M-F and 10PM-close Sun-Thu. 

For my non-alcoholic beverage consuming friends, fear not, Yard House has a lot of yummy appetizer options on their HH menu. For beverages, I get a Roy Rogers (Coke, grenadine, and maraschino cherries), which is super delicious and great for the designated drivers out there :). 

As far as appetizers go, I recommend their truffle fries ($5, not on HH special), fried calamari ($7), ham & pineapple pizza ($6), and their chicken lettuce wraps ($7). All of the food is delicious, reasonably priced, and great for sharing with friends or family while enjoying some beverages of choice (alcoholic or otherwise!)"}
{"text":"Can you say the happiest hour in the valley? Their happy hour is the best! I wish they were not so far away. Great food, great price! This place sets the standard of how to do a happy hour. Take notes!"}
{"text":"Will never go to Bar Louie again. Had a great experience here, it was packed on an early Tuesday night. This is always s good sign, I loved their HUGE drink menu and happy hour specials. Appetizers ranged $5-8 and drinks were $1-4 off during happy hour. Food was good, it you're looking for great/unique flavor go to B spot but food here was better than average for a sports bar. Will be coming back for pre-movie or after work apps. Service was also better than expected for a new restaurant- our waitress was excellent \"e\" something very hard to spell sorry. Also like that it was adequately staffed lots of help for her busy section."}
{"text":"This place has variety of beer selections and the food is good as well. I tend to always get the jerk chicken is amazingly good. The hefeweizens here are always great as well. Not bad for a busy restaurant that keeps up with quality and service."}
{"text":"I would of gave u five stars  but the last time I visit ur bartender suck on making my lemon drop Martini I come to this place a lot and u always get it right but this last time u guys suck on making my drink ! So if u have not train ur bartender how to do it right then re train than over cause I only come to get a good cocktails"}
{"text":"I ordered the Korean chicken wings and lobster, shrimp, crab pasta.  Ugh!  The chicken wings lacked flavor except for the sugar sauce they were tossed in.  Even the pasta was sweet and greasy.  This is clearly bad bar food, nothing more."}
{"text":"Decent service but the food took forever and was extremely cold by the time we got it."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times now for both dinner and just a few drinks at the bar. The food is totally fantastic and you get so much (which is good because the prices are on the high side). The beer selection is phenomenal as both my husband and I love beer. Their happy hour isn't the best but overall selection of food is great. Additionally if you're vegan they have plenty of menu time options!"}
{"text":"Always receive top notch service when I go. I go once a week for an appetizer and cocktail, and I recommend this location to fans of the Yard House."}
{"text":"The wait staff was very accommodating :) My boyfriend of 4 year proposed to me here and they were willing to take the ring from him in advance, and bring it out on a nicely decorated plate with dessert! The food was delicious. I ordered the Mac N' Cheese squared, and if I was old enough I bet anything the beer would  have been great, my fiance seemed to think so. The dessert was so-so, I ordered the creme brulee and I'd prefer mine without banana's on the top, the chocolate in the bottom was awesome though."}
{"text":"Absolutely gonna give 5 stars. My gosh I don't know if it was because I was starving but my Shrimp Cobb Salad was one of the best salads I have ever eaten by far. 

Everything about it was tasty. It had fresh cooked bacon, edamame, corn, yellow cherry tomatoes, blue cheese crumbles, thin sliced carrots and radishes. It also had a very light ranch dressing on it. The lettuce was crisp.

My husband ordered the Ahi Salad and he can be pretty lucky when it comes to food. He normally likes A good steak but opted to eat light too and ordered the lunch size portion.

We had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated at 545pm on a Wednesday. It was pretty busy when we arrived. 

Server was extremely pleasant and the person who delivered our food was as well.  

Big menu choices to choose from. I could have easily ate a hearty meal but thought I better be good for some chocolate at the Godiva store near by."}
{"text":"Delish! Quite the selection of beers. Their was even two choices of framboise so I was very excited about that! Ordered appetizers, deviled eggs and truffle fries...mmm mmm good! They put this sweet salsa like sauce on top of the eggs to give it that extra umph. They only give you 3 halves so we were wondering where that 4th half goes off to ;-) The truffle fries were seasoned with herbs and garlic making it the high light of our apps. Pretty dang delicious! The service wasn't all that great but they were very busy and our server did check in with us periodically when she could. I just love coming to Yard House. The atmosphere is something different than what anyone else can offer.  

The restrooms were very well maintained as well as the establishment itself. A+ for effort!"}
{"text":"Love this place,  everything we have ordered was amazing!  The waiters are super friendly and patient with the menus and recommendations!  The spinach dip is a must if you like spinach. My son said his burger was amazing and cooked perfectly!"}
{"text":"S-L-O-W!!!
The food was good, but good God the service was atrocious. I made a reservation on one of the occasions I went there for lunch and it still took 1.5 hours from sit down to exit. When you're on a conference and pressed for time, that type of service is unacceptable. The quality of food almost made up for the slow service, if the wait staff had been rude, I would have lost it and complained to the manager. 

I can't say anything was particularly bad aside from the slow service. Nearby restaurants were not nearly as slow and many had more patrons inside them. I hope their service speeds up because the location is appealing and the food really is good (for YH). Maybe next time i'm in the area, things will be different."}
{"text":"I love this place. They offer a wide assortment of beers and ciders. They will give you a sample if you are unsure about something you want to try.
They offer a large menu and I have never been disappointed.  If you like tortilla soup you have to give this one a go, it's sooo good! You won't leave this place hungry."}
{"text":"I have come to the Yardhouse numerous times and it never disappoints. Large variety or beers and refreshing cocktails.  Daniel from Texas was our server this last time and he made it such an enjoyable experience. He went through the menu completely and gave his recommendations which we were very pleased. The Cuban sandwich was AMAAAAZING. Thanks so much! We will be back again and continue to send our friends here!"}
{"text":"Excellent chicken strips...fresh...real....damn good.

Pizza is flavorful and this crust tastes great

salads are great

Porcini crusted halibut is excellent!

Good food - too loud to eat IN but we get delivery from grubHub"}
{"text":"As a seasoned Las Vegas vacationer and conference attendee, I find the Yard House to be a staple in my Vegas ventures. The atmosphere is ideal for late lunch to late dinner and cocktails with an overwhelming selection of unique brews on tap. The menu is a combination of both unique cuisine and American favorites catering to vegans and meat-lovers alike. The location on The Linq Promenade gives you access to the Flamingo Hotel, the High Roller and several shops and even more dining options. If you're up for a dessert in the area, Sprinkles and Ghirardelli aren't too far! Our server was welcoming, offering accommodations to any dish! Make the Yard House your first stop on your stay in Las Vegas, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We've been to Yard House many times.
Most times 4 or 5 stars. Love outdoor seating but today children were running wild & punching adults. Not restaurant's fault - maybe. 
Service oh sooooooo slow. Went to bar to ask for sweetener for our teas. Ordered onion ring appetizer - 30 minutes later it came out cold. Ironically the table next to ours sent back cold food twice!! This is the FIRST time either one of us has gotten up and left any restaurant. Guess you would have to be in the thick of this to understand. 
As much as we usually enjoy it here - it would be a LONG time before we will return. Heading to strip now for a better experience. What gives? New management?"}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to go and I have to say the FOOD was actually really good.  Nice presentation and even better taste.  We all know about the beer, but have some food you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love yard house. I don't know what else to say, lol the beer is great, food is great, nice atmosphere. Well placed screens."}
{"text":"Tons of beer on tap but average food and way too expensive. Better options in Westgate for food or drinks (like Tavern+Bowl)."}
{"text":"Really great restaurant!! Food and service was awesome! We had the enchilada stack, lobster crab and artichoke dip, garden chicken avocado burger, buffalo wings and cheese pizza. My husband had the Belgian Golden Ale. Will be back again. 

Came back to the Yard House tonight and I must say I was not impressed this time around. I dropped my review to 4 stars. This time we had onion rings for the app and for entrees we had the Mac and cheese with mushrooms and bacon, which was pretty good, white fish tacos which were good, fish and chips, which had too much batter and greasy, buffalo wings, our son is a fan and four cheese pizza, which was not so good, like pizza you get from Chuck E Cheese. For $110, I would expect higher quality food. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I have been here twice with a friend.  Ordered appetizers the first time, and the food was great.  However, the service was not only glacially slow, but our waiter (and all the others) were next to impossible to flag down for more water, a second drink, missing utensils.  Tried to flag people down only to be ignored - the only way we got what we needed was to physically walk around and chase someone down.
The second time was the LAST time for this place - was seated by the host and literally waited 12 minutes, still no one had come by to say \"hello\" let alone take our drink orders or bring water.  I went up to the host, whose station was RIGHT NEXT to our table and asked where our server was, that we hadn't even gotten water.  The host used his radio and then he too physically seemed to have to chase after our waiter in the kitchen.
When the host returned, he said our waiter would be right here.  Well.....13 minutes later he did show up, but at our neighboring table who had been seated AFTER us!! 
My friend and I looked up at the host, who just shrugged and smiled at us.  As anyone can appreciate, that was it - my friend had been keeping track of time, and we left after waiting there 29 minutes!!!!
We are locals and frequent Red Rock often.  However, the Yard House has lost us as customers.  The only reason they get one star is because the food is good.  Our treatment, or lack therefore by being ignored as customers is inexcusable.  
The management may contact me if they like, as I'm sure no manager of quality would accept this treatment of patrons by their staff."}
{"text":"This restaurant/bar was suggested by a cab driver.  It was good food and good service at a great price.  They have so many drink options and they give you samples.  It was such a good experience that we went back a second night.  I highly recommend the tacos."}
{"text":"Huge restaurant with a very nice menu.  Huge bar for the social lifestyle.  Beer options like you wouldn't believe, but if you want your liquor instead, they have that too.  Pretty good service.  Somewhat dim lighting but it serves a purpose providing nice ambiance. Great place for all kinds of affairs from family dining, to dating, hanging with friends or having a business dinner.  I would come back here again for sure if I get back to Vegas.  I suggest the Calamari appetizer.  It was fresh tasting, not overcooked and flat out yummy!"}
{"text":"We have been waiting for this location to open since it was announced about six months ago.

The place has a HUGE beer selection and offers a \"yard\" of beer of your choice.

The food is great and the menu includes steaks, chicken, seafood, tacos, and some of the best appetizers.

I had the southern fried chicken with cream corn, baked beans and mashed potatoes.  The chicken was prepared perfectly and the mashed potatoes were awesome.  

Wife had the vodka shrimp pasta and it was prepared perfectly.

I have visited the Coral Gables (Miami, FL) and Raleigh, NC locations and the restaurant has never fail to deliver the best service, large beer selection and the best food around while watching the game on the various HD TVs.

We will be back in the very near future."}
{"text":"Went there a few months ago, and it was great.  Amazingly large selection of craft beers on taps, but my whole party also got some great cocktails.  The food we got was great, duck wings, steak sandwich and tacos were delicious.  Emily and Lily gave us great service.  We'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Monday through Friday they have an awesome happy hour special 3-6. Awesome selection of beer, a very accommodating staff, and great food. They're one of the not Vegas spots that carries Hangar 24 Orange Wheat!"}
{"text":"I'm no beer conossieur, but I enjoy this place because of the wide array options on tap. So fantastic. The food is pretty good too. I enjoyed the parmesan crusted chicken, while my girl had the garlic noodle appetizer. The portions were large and we were full after that and a few beers. My girl loves cider and enjoy the raspberry Wyders that's on tap. We were here for a friend's birthday party, so our group was pretty large. The service was lacking and they were slow to bring our drinks, food and checks towards the end, but all in all they were able to acommodate our very large group. I'll definitely be back, with a smaller group.  The weekends get pretty busy, so expect a wait for larger parties."}
{"text":"No matter what YARD HOUSE you go to..you can expect the same great service...from the Host to the waiters..All smiles from the moment you walk in to the moment you leave..and it goes Same for the food! The only thing I noticed on their menu here (Las Vegas Town Square) they don't have Kung Po Calamri..
But other then that..the outside patio seating is a must...( late night around this time 1130pm..nice cool breeze..then a sun blazing at 110 degrees) but I ordered the wings so yup..that's all"}
{"text":"Terrible!!!  This used to be our favorite go to place....not anymore!  We always seem to get the same thing however it was completely different yesterday!  Apparently they changed the chicken batter (not for the better)  it was burnt, dry and looked green.  The hot chicken sandwich was also very dry and had no flavor.  I got the chicken cob salad and again way different.  Have the size of the salad but all the dressing and more.  The salad was more like a soup.  Then the drinks....well we got one, getting another not so much.  NOT OUR GO TO ANYMORE!  $70 WASTED"}
{"text":"Great beer selection of course, food is consistent from location to location. Bartenders were disengaged and unwelcoming, could care less weather we were there or not. Their response to thank you was \"uh huh\". Sad because I've seen many Yard House locations with full lively bars, fun and entertaining environment. I'll be back, the food and beer are draw enough. Hostess was upbeat and welcoming as well."}
{"text":"Outstanding beer selection, great menu options, cool atmosphere, and friendly service! Chill and relax with a half yard of beer from all around the world in this awesome spot right off the centre strip in the LINQ promenade!"}
{"text":"The wait was quoted 20 min, 40 min later we asked about our table and they said we were seated.  Server then took 20 min to even greet us.  

Our food:  my gf asked specifically if the chicken nachos had shredded cheese or queso cheese (she doesn't like shredded) and was told it came with queso cheese.  We then asked for a side of queso cheese and were told we would have to pay for it.  They also messed up another order at our table.  The manager (blonde haired lady) came out and argued that instead of bringing a side of queso cheese and taking that off the menu, that they would instead comp two meals (I told them no, just make my gf happy and bring the queso).  So I guess you could say the management \"took care of us\".  I just find it odd that they have no problem taking meals off, and not actually correcting the problem (and arguing with us)."}
{"text":"Yard House Red Rock is finally here!

All the things we were waiting for...

If you've been rock'in the Yard House @ Town Square and hoping for something closer... here it is... Yard House Red Rock.

I think I'll crack it open with the NBA finals.  Enjoy Las Vegas!

PS - the Tuna sandwich and the Mac'n Cheese are must haves."}
{"text":"My husband and I just visited for the first time since moving here in November. We will definitely be back. 

The service was awesome. 
The beer selection was overwhelming for someone like me who knows nothing about beer but the manager came and chatted with us a few times and helped us make the right choices. 
The food was delicious. (We had burgers and fries.)

So excited we found this place!"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of the Yard House by me, but this one is off the charts. The food was so good. I had a chicken schnitzel sandwich and fries which was incredible. I also tried the Nashville hot chicken, which was fantastic as well. The service was excellent."}

{"text":"I LOVE the Yard House! Great menu with too many options!!! All great options! I love the original Caesar shrimp salad and the hummus, a must every time! All the lunch soup, salads, and sandwiches are really good!! I love the big booths and open restaurant. Definitely a go to place!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent location for a Friday night date or family dinner night out. Duane was an amazing waiter - 5 star customer service."}
{"text":"Yardhouse is a great place to go during happy hour with either a big group of friends or on a date.  Eh, maybe not on a date, since the music is pretty loud in there.  The martinis are delish and strong and the variety of beer is amazing.   I just love the late night happy hour!  Last time I was there I got the Crab Cakes which were perfect!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing food and my lady loves the beer selection.I will definitely be back for happy hour.I tried the tacos today and damn are they good!Super cool setup at the bar and awesome service."}
{"text":"One of my top favorite places to have a drink and grab some food. The service no matter how busy it is seems to be on point and I have zero complaints really. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection. 5 stars for the beer selection alone. The cheer teams and their pounds of makeup and lame shenanigans drop it to a 4 star rating for the day. I'd still come back in a heartbeat"}
{"text":"I love this place. There are tv's all around and the food is awesome. I always get the roasted turkey melt. The service is a bit slower than most places, but it is worth it."}
{"text":"Love this place!!  Amazing food, staff, drinks, music, and environment!  It was super busy but they got us in and the quality of the food was amazing.  Our server was hilarious and very attentive.  Beer selection was fantastic and their beer brewed in-house was delicious!  We may have to become regulars!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, awesome location, friendly service. Food was big portions and very very good. Beer was good and fresh (try the yardstick)."}
{"text":"Staying at the Renaissance next door on a business trip, our group decided to have dinner here one night.  They took our reservation for 8 less than an hour ahead of time and we were seated as soon as we arrived.  The bar itself offered quite a bit of seating and looked full, and the dining area was pretty well packed also.  We were seated at an awkwardly deep U-shaped booth... the people seated at the inside had to scoot a good 15 feet to their seat.

As many have already said, the beer selection is great.  They also have samplers if you don't know exactly what you want and you can try most of their draft offerings in glasses of varying sizes depending on whether you're just trying something new or you know what you like and want a lot of it.

The food selection is pretty large and the menu takes a while to get through, as a result you know a good portion of it is premade, pre-packaged.  However, it still tastes pretty damn good.  I tried some of the spicy tuna and moo shu egg roll appetizers.  For my main course I had the orange peel chicken.  I enjoyed everything I tried.  The prices weren't unusual for a mid-scale restaurant in an outdoor mall-type setting.  

Dessert was a taste of their mini-trio sampler... a small lemon souffle, peach apple cobbler, and chocolate souffle.   Each excellent.

Service was a bit off, the waiter came across as somewhat arrogant or haughty, not really personable.  They didn't check back very often to ensure drinks were refilled promptly.  But over all, it was only a minor detraction from an otherwise above average dining experience.

Definitely worth a visit, and will be happy to try again next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Yard House has always been one of those staple restaurants that's been around for years and have maintained a consistency with the food they serve. 

This YH is located along the walkway at the Linq and has an express bar outside that allows you to order your alcoholic beverage and enjoy the night without having to be a patron inside the restaurant. 

We showed up and was told that there was a 35 minute wait. We decided to walk to the bar in hopes to find an open stool.  We were wrong, it was jammed pack. Fortunately, our number was called before the given time and was lead into the bar/patio part. 

It took a great while before we received any type of service. By the time our waiter served us, we had already picked out everything that we wanted. And once he came by, we placed our entire order. For starters, we chose the calamari and fries. Chris ordered the sear ahi tuna with brown rice and I ordered the grilled cheese sandwich with organic tomato soup.  The food took an even greater while. We were very annoyed and at that point, wanted to walk off the premise. It was obvious that the food runner was running to drop off meals to other tables as he was sweating quit a bit when he got to our table. YH is obviously lacking the correct number of staff to the amount of people that dines inside. 

The annoying part is the appetizers were given simultaneously with our meal!! Really YH? You've been serving food for so long and for your staff to give us food like that is a complete let down. Especially for an established chain restaurant with standards. The food as usual, was good but we were not impressed with their calamari. Number one, it was cold. The breading was not crunchy and was coming off the calamari. This is an easily passable order. The fries were good and flavorful. Our meals were good and we enjoyed it.

But the food just wasn't as enjoyable as it usually does due to their lack of service, staff, and coordination. The fact that they served the meal and the appetizer at the same time, is a big no-no. The waiter did offered to \"keep it warm\" while we ate the appetizers but seeing how slow their service was, we decided against it. 

YH is in a great spot and we hope they improve on their quality of service."}
{"text":"This place was overly priced and the food was disgusting!! My 9 yr old who will eat anything refused to eat the Mac and cheese from the kids menu because it was so awful.. both my husband and I tried it and agreed.. my vodka pasta with shrimp was awful. The shrimp tasted fishy and tasted the same.. we spent almost $100 for 5 people and there was no alcohol purchased. Very disappointed and will never return.."}
{"text":"The food quality is AWESOME here.  And it's a pleasant, cool setup to sit outside and people watch. 

This is my FAVORITE spot at Westgate to have a few drinks and eat, and one of my ALL TIME FAVORITES.  I've been to this location a handful of times, from lunch to dinner to late night.  I have tried a variety from the menu.  Everything has been primo.  My favorite is the Vodka Shrimp Pasta.  Goes so well with a half yard of New Belgium 1554.

The service is consistently superb.  Lighting, noise level, seating option, spacing, cleanliness- all outstanding.

I mean, compare this to competitors such as BJs and Rock Bottom.  All have similar prices, but the food quality, selection of food and drinks, and service (for starters) are superior at Yard House (particularly Westgate Yardhouse).

I've been to just about all of the Yard Houses in Cali and AZ.  This one is my favorite.  My previous favorite was in Long Beach, on the water.  But then when I really thought about it the water is dirty and stinks half the time, like most of the LA area does. 

They have an very solid website, and options to order online and pick up.  Haven't tried this yet, but it's a nice option. 

I'm a guy that is still a little mad the full yards got taken away.  But I understand it's not the company's fault.

YARD HOUSE ROCKS!"}
{"text":"Love this place! But sometimes it disappoints me then they don't have my beer on tap! I sooo miss the yards drinks yard house use to give out!!! Boooo!"}
{"text":"The initial attraction to the the Yard House is its beer selection of 130 taps, mostly craft with a few mainstays such as Budweiser & Corona. However, do not overlook the food menu which IMO, is top-notch with steak & seafood. The happy hour menu is very reasonably priced and the portions are more than sufficient to be filling. I had 2 craft brews and the happy hour Margherita Pizza. The pizza is 8 slices and ideally, is perfect for two. The food arrived hot and was very tasty indeed. I was impressed with the knowledge of the bartending staff, each question I asked was answered with certainty and politeness. I would highly recommend a visit to the Yard House for a great time. Cheers!"}
{"text":"This place is good for BIG parties and I mean 20+ people. We had my bf's and his friend's birthday dinner few weeks ago and had so much fun. The servers were very friendly and accommodating. Everyone ordered the yardstick($13 for 2 glasses of beer) while I drank my water since I wasn't in the mood to drink. I ordered the steak and shrimp which I rarely order but since we were splitting the check, it wouldn't be fair if I paid $66 dollars for a pizza or a chicken pot pie. Which by the way, the chicken pot pie is HUGE! 
Overall, the restaurant is spacious for big parties.

Met up with my friend last night. Ordered the calamari since I wasn't that hungry. I must say, not really a martini person since some bartenders make it really strong. But my friend introduced me to the Georgia Peach and Hawaiian sunset and absolutely LOVED IT! Not too strong but a creeper, so beware. 
My bf ordered the lobster burger and it was surprisingly delish! 
We also had the same server from a couple of weeks ago which she also was fantastic!"}
{"text":"We got greeted promptly and we decided to sit at the bar. Got great service and ordered quickly!"}
{"text":"Drove almost 30 minutes to get to this place to pick up a to go order which was placed at 11:30pm walked in at 11:58 exactly and they had already thrown the food in the trash, apparently too excited to close the reataurant. If you're in that big of a hurry to close down why would you even let a customer place a Togo order within 30 min of closing. Thanks for wasting an hour of my time Yard House."}
{"text":"So we went to the Yard House last night and we were seated immediately as we chose to sit on the patio.  Our server was Brandon, and he was exceptionally patient with us.  I always ask a waiter/waitress what they recommend when I've never been to a place before, and I probably should have taken his suggestions because...BLAH!  I ordered the Southern Fried Chicken breast, which I have at the homes of southern people so I know it's supposed to be wonderful with a variety of spices in the breading.  This came out a beautiful golden brown and what looked like maybe pepper sprinkles.  It was about as tasteless as chicken can be, and there was no salt and pepper to be had, only parmesan cheese and hot pepper flakes, which I would only put on pizza or Italian food, which I didn't have.  The potatoes were good with the garlic infused and the spinach leaves that were laid in between layers were kind of wilted but tasteless.  The gravy that came in a separate boat looked like skim milk and kind of tasted like that too, no thickness at all and certainly no flavor...gravy needs to be boiled to get that wonderful southern cooking flavor and this was just flat, and again no spices so no way to even make it taste better.  The best thing on the plate was the creamed corn, which was about two tablespoons of it and the coke that I drank.  They got TWO stars because of the service and for no other reason. I paid $20 for a meal that I wouldn't serve to guests in my home it was so tasteless."}
{"text":"I will not come back to this place! I met a friend for dinner and ordered the Kale Caesar salad with Chicken, what a mistake! NO kale at all only romaine lettuce with two little pieces of chicken, no dressing at all so dry!! I had to request more dressing and asked where the Kale was??!! The server did bring more dressing and kale but still for 10 dollars I was so disappointed ! I am only giving two starts because I know it was not the server's fault --- bottom line not worth the money I spent here !"}
{"text":"The food gets 4 stars. I was quite impressed for it being mainly a bar scene. I got the Spicy Thai Pizza and my girlfriend got the Pepperoni Pizza. The dessert was a straight HOME RUN. Got the Smores Brownie. We ordered 2 and the server only bought out one. He admitted to making a mistake but I actually thanked him because 2 would have been way too much. I ordered it with a side of chocolate mint ice cream. Delicious! 

2 stars for the overall seating situation. They weren't that busy (MANY visible tables open) and they took 45 minutes to seat a table of 6. I was disappointed with that. 

Overall good experience. I definitely recommend going. Hopefully you get seated sooner to enjoy the good food."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for the last 7 years and I can't remember a time where my experience was any less than amazing. I've been there for happy hour, lunch, dinner and always had a great time.

The location is superb. In the heart of the Scottsdale Fashion Square - so you can't beat that. The food is amazing, and you can get pretty much anything. From a simple salad to a nice steak and everything in between.

Drinks are great too and the beer specials are awesome. 5 stars in my book!"}
{"text":"I just happened on this place when I was in Las Vegas over the Christmas weekend and it was such a wonderful surprise. I had no idea it was a franchise but this restaurant is so delicious. Everything was amazing and the staff was super friendly. 

Food: There are SO MANY OPTIONS. The menu is huge so it was hard to choose but luckily there were 5 of us so we got to try a variety of dishes. 

Chicken Tortilla Soup: super flavorful! 

Shiitake Mushroom Garlic Noodles: There was no meat on the dish but it didn't lack anything! It's on the snacks menu but for my small appetite it was perfectly. It was buttery and delicious! 

Pineapple Chicken: There was so much chicken on this dish so I was expecting it to be dry but it was decently moist and the pineapple sauce it came with was very complementary. But the fried rice it came with was OMG so good. It looked like a normal fried rice but it was seriously the highlight. 

Miso Glazed Sea Bass: The fish was so flaky and it came with a bunch of brown rice and vegetables. 

Overall, it was such a good experience. I'm salivating just thinking about how good this meal was."}
{"text":"I love the off menu Thai Chicken Salad. I ordered it here and it wasn't quite as good as usual. The noodles were different. The kids menu is amazing $7 for a drink food and dessert. Still well worth the stop."}
{"text":"We LOVE us some Yardhouse!!  They always have great service, great food...never disappoints!  I took a picture of my favorite dessert-chocolate souffle'.  It's a tiny little morsel, and just enough to top off a fantastic meal.  It's only around $3, and it's pure heaven.  If you are a chocolate lover,  but are sick of restaurants slaying the \"chocolate cake\" with a mediocre knock off of a good ol' Duncan's Hines box cake--then this is your chance to indulge in a decadent, warm, rich chocolate treat!

As far as dinner goes, I'm a huge fan of the Southern Fried chicken, and my hubby loves the Enchilada Stack.  We've never been unhappy with anything we order, they really know how to make a meal...even if it doesn't look at all like it sounds!  For example, their Mac & Cheese is so much more than \"Mac\" & \"Cheese\".  It's several kinds of cheeses, mushrooms, chicken, oh my!!

We recently ate at a Denver Yardhouse location, and it's consistent with our Las Vegas locations! 

Oh, and I totally forgot about their vast array of beer choices--can't miss with this restaurant!"}
{"text":"So hesitant about giving them either 3 or 4 stars. I love coming here during their happy hour because it's great prices for awesome food. I usually order allot from the happy hour menu because the food can be quite allot. I've read some other reviews complaining about their portion sizes but to me they're just perfect. 

I have to say on this specific night, Jeremy our sever, was completely rude and had MAJOR attitude towards our table. It made me felt very unwelcome and wanted to leave right away. Every time I ask something or even add to the order he gives off this vibe that makes me feel so uncomfortable. I don't know if he had a bad night but my table did nothing wrong so he should of left his feelings aside and serve our table with a better attitude. 

Sorry Yard House but 3 stars because of Jeremy. I'll definitely be back but if he is my server again I would walk out and come back."}
{"text":"So we popped back into the Yard House after the Mexico/USA soccer match. Guess what?  My husband's food was stone cold, AGAIN. If you cannot produce a fish taco at an appropriate temperature, stop serving them. I am so done with this place. Of course the waitress took the plate and commented on the \"stone cold\" nature of the dish, but by the time a new one came, everyone was finished with their meal.  Also, the dish of beans served with the fish taco was about 10 beans in a cup of liquid. Someone does not care what they serve and no manager is catching on and fixing this stuff before the food hits the table. 

 At this point, I have to assume that this is not going to change. I am not returning here."}
{"text":"Great place to chill out and watch sports. People are friendly. But I have just one question. Why am I paying a tip on tax? You all total the bill, then add tax, then calculate the tip on the total INCLUDING TAX? Wtf? One star. Lots of people are getting ripped off. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Good food for a chain. Nothing I crave, but not bad at all"}
{"text":"Came here yesterday and didn't have a great experience like I've had at many other Yard House Restaurants before.  We were able to be seated right away +1 star.  
 
Our waiter came over and we placed our order. Lunch special with pizza and tomato basil soup, kids meal with pizza and veggies and ahi appetizer which  was being eaten for lunch and not appetizer.  My cousin also ordered a beer, which took forever to come out.  The waiter finally came over after about 10 minutes and said they had to replace the keg.  

Beer finally came, next we waited for our food... And waited, and waited and waited!  Thank goodness I had snacks in my bag for my 3 year old to settle him while we waited.  When the food did arrive, the cheese on the pizza looked old and dry, as if it had been sitting under the heat lamp for quite awhile.  We only had a few bites and moved on to the soup, which my 3 year old and I basically split because it was delicious +1 star!

Threw the leftover pizza away since it was gross."}
{"text":"Overall, fun place.  Food is more 3.5 star, but hey, they have a huge beer selection!  Appetizers came out quickly.  The onion rings are so so.  The calamari is good, but ours was mostly tails.  Steak was on the tough side.  Fish n chips were good.  Beer is great.  Service was great, other than the lull between appetizers and entrees.  Will go back someday."}
{"text":"Yard House is like a large sports bar with decent tasting American cuisine. I ordered the Baja Fish Tacos and my wife the Ahi Kale Caesar salad. Both were tasty and we both were satisfied. The food is a bit calorie laden so if your dieting this is not the place to go. Each of our meals which weren't large were in excess of 800 calories. 
The service otherwise was excellent. Meals were delivered promptly and our waiter was very attentive. This restaurant is a great place to hand out with groups of friends or families. Not a romantic fine dining experience at all.  Price wise it's quite decent. 1 appetizer and 2 entrees for $36. 
I would come here again.."}
{"text":"This was my first time at the Town Square location, as I usually visit the one in the Linq Promenade. While the beer and menu are the same, the atmosphere is much more relaxed and mellow than the one on the strip, as expected. I dined for lunch on the weekend and found myself really wishing it was happy hour because they offer such great portions at a discounted price. 

Our table ordered a few salads and sandwiches, a burger, and macaroni and cheese. No complaints about the food; the portions are great and the food was tasty. The menu in general is pages long and offers a little bit of everything with convenient half and full size options. 

As for the beer, this place has it all! I discovered a very special watermelon IPA that was only $8/pint and 10%ABV! One pint did the trick and it was really fun choosing from the pages and pages of specialty beer on tap. They do offer 2 free samples, which I didn't realize, so I'll be sure to take advantage of this on my next trip.  

I think I definitely prefer the other location; my fun-meter wasn't as high while dining here, but I would be sure to come back if I'm ever shopping at the Town Square outdoor mall."}
{"text":"The Yard House on the Linq promenade is an excellent happy hour gem! They have over 100 draft beers available on discount during happy hour Monday-Friday from 3-6pm. The happy hour appetizers are what brought me back a second time while on vacation in Las Vegas because most of the happy hour menu was nearly half off! We ordered a wide variety for the table to share including the margherita pizza, spicy chicken pizza, chicken lettuce wraps, and spinach and cheese dip with crispy pita bread. We loved each and every dish, especially the pizzas. 

The restaurant is large and has a patio, but filled very quickly for happy hour. It would likely be helpful to call in advance for a table due to the high foot traffic of tourists in the area. 

Our server was excellent. My friend couldn't bear the taste of the sour beer she ordered- she said it was like straight cough syrup. We notified the waitress and she kindly brought her a different type of beer and even comped the drink. 

If you're in the area and looking for a fun atmosphere to hang with friends and enjoy quality food and drinks this is your place!"}
{"text":"Awesome staff. Very friendly and welcoming. Great food, great service. Will likely make this my Spring Training place to eat on a regular basis."}
{"text":"I really like the look of the restaurant. It has a brewery-type look, but with more elegance. They have a reported 130 beers on draft, so it is an extensive list. The beer flows from lines coming out of a second story room through metal pipes that feed down to the taps. It looks very cool. They also have their token \"yard\" glass that they serve the beers in, which is fun. The restaurant is LARGE.  I love how open it is, rather than closed off rooms of seating. There are numerous televisions with sports games on. The staff is very friendly. The prices are fair and the menu is LARGE as well. You have several options to choose from on the menu, with some great appetizer options. I could only give the restaurant 4 stars because my table kept wobbling and there was an unfortunately placed light shining directly in my eyes the whole time. So make sure you like your seat and table before you commit to it."}
{"text":"lots of fun memories here, some a bit blurry."}
{"text":"This is a review of their lunch/afternoon menu.

The Skinny: so-so sandwich, okay pizza (2), space cadet waiter with a lengthy wait (1), pretty good lunch special pricing (3).

My hubby and I came here at 2 pm to grab a late lunch.

This place had a nicer vibe at lunch than during their evening hours - less loud, less pretentious, less obnoxious.

We were surprised how bad the service was given that the day before we'd had an excellent waiter. Our waiter gave us our menu and then went MIA most of the time. It took longer than 10 minutes to put down our order. It took over 30 minutes for our food (a crab-cake sandwich special and a bbq chicken pizza) to arrive which is bad considering that 1) the restaurant was lacking patrons during this time and 2) they are trying to cater to the speedy lunch crowd.

The crab cake sandwich ought to be bread with a small side of crab-cake. There were large slices of bread to the point where you can barely see the crab cake. My husband did not finish the bread and actually opened up his sandwich and just ate the crabcake. The french onion soup it came with was okay - not cheesy enough but okay.

The bbq chicken pizza was okay - not great. The crust was not crisp enough. Too little toppings with too much sauce made this pizza feel pretty unbalanced. The accompanying field green salad was fine except for the raw leeks that were in there. (Leeks are really not meant to be raw, dudes!).

Overall, this lunch service needs to be improved to match what happens here in the evening."}
{"text":"This is a review about their happy hour sliders.

The Skinny: okay burgers that have a poor patty to bun ratio and need more interesting toppings (3), service - long wait times, reasonable service (2.5), value: it's reasonable - not too expensive and within keeping with other happy hour specials in town.

We ordered a plate of bearnaise sauce sliders and classic sliders. Serving sizes are large - one plate comes with four sliders and a side of fries.

The sliders are served on a slightly sweet pan-styled bun. Overall, there is probably a little too much bun and not enough meat inside. The patties are well-seasoned, crisp however are a might on the dry side. 

The classic came with some standard cheese and pickle - which was okay but would have been better if there was some lettuce or tomato on top. The bearnaise sliders come with some fried onions which really improved the flavour of the sliders and texture. The bearnaise sauce wasn't anything I needed to go back for however.

The skinny fries are okay when they're hot but once again suffer once they've sat out for too long. They are crisp but are a little on the thin cut fries side of things so it lacks some of the lovely mealiness inside.

Overall, not bad sliders, but nothing really special. The edge goes out to the bearnaise sliders by virtue of the fried onion topping."}
{"text":"Great food... Great Service... Nice attention to details & a wide variety of food options.  I would sure love some organic choices to be added & some grass fed, stage four, no hormone, no antibiotic meat at some if the nice Las Vegas restaurants... Hope we see that soon!!!"}
{"text":"The calamari was all clumped together & a little over-cooked. It was not the best I have ever had here.  They usually serve tastier food than than today. 
Also we ordered ribs & they were good, but not spectacular. They were hot which was nice. 
The sauce was ok... A bit bland.  
On the bright side the server was very nice and we were able to sit at a high boy table in the bar area & order quickly."}
{"text":"Every now and then if I want a little snack I find the appetizers tasty, but their meals are inconsistent rating between terrible to average. A great place for drinks, but I'd pass on planning a meal here.  Almost everything is too salty to taste

Other yard houses I've been to have been better with their dishes so I wouldn't take this rating as a blanket statement for all locations"}
{"text":"I'm not a beer drinker but I've been here many times over the past year, mainly for the happy hour (half price on appetizers and discounted drinks) and have enjoyed each visit.  If you are a beer lover, this place is for you.  There are over 100 beers from which to choose, all excellent and worthy of serious consideration, according to my husband, a huge beer lover.

The food is great and consistently well done.  Menu choices include  ethnic-inspired dishes (Korean short ribs, noodle dishes), burgers, seafood, and steak.  On this visit, I had the turkey burger, which is one of the better ones I've had anywhere.  Even without cheese (I'm allergic to dairy), the burger had loads of flavour and was moist.  The accompanying fries were thinly sliced and abundant.  My husband had the full rack of St. Louis ribs and the meat literally fell off the bone.  Each rib had plenty of meat and the bbq sauce was spicy and tasty.  Hubby's sides were a lovely serving of cilantro infused baked beans and creamed corn, the latter of which featured \"a ton of butter and cream\" (sayeth the spouse).  We both finished half of our meals and are looking forward to tomorrow's lunch.

For dessert, I chose the mini peach-apple cobbler (ice cream on the side and happily consumed by hubby) and it was warm and full of fruit.  The size of the dessert was perfect: just enough to satisfy, not too much to sicken.  :)  

Yard House would garner 5 stars from me if the servers displayed consistent service.  Some days, my server is awesome, not too attentive but just enough, courteous and charming, and nailing every dining request I may have.  Other times, I'll see the server two times, the first time to take the order and the second time to bring the cheque.  Today's server was good and would rate an 8.5 (she remembered that my turkey burger was supposed to be cheeseless but forgot to include my garlic aioli sauce on the side).  

All in all, overall great food and decent service.  I always have a good time when I go and it's one of my go-to places for a fun time."}
{"text":"I love coming here with friends for Happy Hour! This Yard House is close to me and I love the shops in desert ridge! The service at this location has been spectacular, everyone is super friendly and all are willing to hash out great recommendations! My favorite drink is the sunset sangria and I love getting the Poke Nachos during Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to Yard House, after class or just because. I Love Love Love their late night happy hour. Half priced appetizers? I think YES!
The staff for the most part has been awesome. I Love sitting outside but sometimes it can be hard to grab our servers attention with the layout of the restaurant. The ambiance is fun and can be super romantic. But I always come with friends and we have a fun time. It is also interesting to watch the people of Westgate!"}
{"text":"The Yard House is great. Every time I go, I get something different and the happy hour is unbeatable. Located in Red Rock casino, portion sizes are hefty, drinks are stiff, beer is plentiful, and staff is polite. This is a great spot to get a burger, beer and deal during happy hour. Yard House knows how to keep customers coming back."}
{"text":"Yard House Town Square is always a good call. There are a few of these around town and they have a great happy hour. Service at this one is just alright and I'm guessing because they believe that everyone who comes there is on vacation. Treat locals better and the restaurant gets a 5 star review."}
{"text":"First thing, Beer, mmm it's good to have so many choices in one place.  I love the atmosphere when you walk into the place they have a clear glass viewing room to see all the Kegs.  You literally see hundreds of these babies locked down and ready to share in pure awesomeness.  I've been here at least three times in the past six months and my all time favorite is the ECLIPSE, black and tan with  * Blue Moon & Guinness Stout. Yeah it's kinda the bomb.  Anyways whatever kind of beer you like, except malt liquor is avail here.  I've tried the pizza, it was alright but nothing I'd order again, but the truffle fries are so good.  I did order those for dinner once by themselves, and will do it again thinking about it now.  Just a warning though, check your bill, sometimes they include gratuity already."}
{"text":"This is a casual place that has a better menu and drinks than a red robin or a chili's. I really like their grilled cheese and tomato soup and they make a great margarita. 

It is a very loud place and they have a lot of beer choices. A good place to meet up with friends or sit in the bar and take in a game.

It can get busy on weekends though.

Stay away from anything \"sushi\" sounding, it is not what you think.

The thai noodles are great!"}
{"text":"Never a disappointing time here!  Most of the food is huge and great, the drinks are great, the atmosphere is comfortable, the staff is friendly, the happy hour is very encompassing, it is in a very nice location, etc, etc, I could go on forever.  I used to come here once a week for their happy hour before my schedule changed and I always had a fantastic time.  I will say that I wish the happy hour was earlier but then again they would probably be a lot more crowded so it's not too bad.  I'm really a fan of this place and this location.  I've been to the one at the linq and that is pretty cool as well, it's just a lot harder to get to and a bit farther away so this is my go to spot.  Come here by yourself or with others, sit down, eat, drink, people watch and enjoy yourself!"}
{"text":"A Yard House, just like the rest which is a good thing because Yard House rocks!  Great food, pretty good prices, good happy hour but then again, maybe not so good here.  They have the same midday happy hour as the one at Town Square but do not have the late night Mon-Fri one which was a shock and a bummer when I was there the other night.  
I like their outside bar but the prices seem a bit higher than the inside prices.  I could be completely wrong, it just seems pricier to me.  I love the convenience though and the bartender the other night in particular was quite a joy and very accommodating."}
{"text":"Great place for food with friends - love their tacos and sliders - busy spot but find a place by the bar t"}
{"text":"First off, I never do this first but my server was so on point that I need to mention how good the service was.   She was really on top of things even though I'm a horrible person and can't remember her name yo give her credit.   But soda was always filled, checked up on us often but not overbearing, gave us a bag and containers to take out leftovers home without us asking and just had an awesome attitude.  

We went during happy hour and go a disgusting amount of food.  

Onion rings- we liked them and they give a hefty portion.  Would only get again if I was sharing with a few people ($5)

Traditional wings- really enjoyed them.  Gave us 10 medium sized wings.  Would definitely get them again ($6)

Fried Calamari- not good IMO.   Texture of the squid was a bit too squishy/tough and not feeling the breading.   Should have known not to get the seafood.  ($7)

Blue Crab Cakes- you get 2 decent sized per order.   They were decent but not intending to get again.   I'll pass, and for the money you can do better here.   ($7)

BBQ chicken pizza- better than what they serve at California Pizza Kitchen.  Nice sized.  You can share with 3 people easily as part of your order and won't get sick of it.   For the money, it was well sized and tasty.  ($7)

Overall would go back during happy hour but know to avoid the crab cakes and calamari.  Gonna be on the wings and pizza like white on rice."}
{"text":"So bad the don't even cook the food all the way and the host work are very rude no one should go here if you are in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"A quick lunch before a movie. Good blackened fish tacos for lunch. Pico de Gallo was fresh and very tasty. Obviously beer selection is second to none. This was my 3rd visit and the service is still suspect. Food is a 4 service is a 2.5. Waiter took beverage order, a different uni server brought drinks and yet another had to bring food. Disorganized service resulted in one meal fresh and hot and the other clearly sat on a warmer and dried out."}
{"text":"off the chain!! ..good beer, good food..and the atmosphere is awesome. this is a great place to just chill on the weekends or whenever i'm in town visiting some friends. Happy hour is always a good time to go too..decent prices for quality food and beer.

personal fave: blue moon..holla!!"}
{"text":"I like it, friendly Bartender Alli B. Is a rock star knows the beers super helpful.  Fast food services lots of TVs great people."}
{"text":"Went here for a happy hour (3-6) around 4 w BF for an inexpensive early dinner and drinks at a new place. 

Atmosphere was great, poppin for a Tuesday evening. Good mix of people, from young to older. Somewhat expensive and swanky atmosphere, but you could go in there with something more causal on and fit in. Very big, open floor plan with metal elements (bar and keg pipes that go into their \"keg room\" located privately upstairs.) Nice seating and booths. Very streamlined yet cozy. Downtown feel without having to go downtown. Relatively unimportant, but the bathroom was cool (check out pics if you must). 

Service was great. Friendly, & speedy. 

Food was top notch. Came out fairly quickly. Was presented BEAUTIFULLY. Alllmost too good to eat. My favorite was the Ahi Tuna Sashimi (see pic). I even ate the red cabbage slaw by twirling it around in the yummy dressing that accompanied the dish on the base of the plate. Spicy tuna roll was equally good. We were expecting a roll as in \"sushi roll\" but it came out in a unique presentation in a cylindrical form with edamame as it's base topped with seared rare tuna and topped with guacamole. Somewhat bland and not spicy except for the few  drops of siracha on the plate, yet very good. Thai pizza was also very good, with peanuts, cheese, a teriyaki style sauce and cilantro. 

This place is pricey, especially for the alcoholic beverages. For happy hour, it was three dollars off martinis, with that being said mine cost $8 for the happy hour price. My only complaint is that when it was served to me it filled roughly half of the martini glass. I'm sorry, but when it comes to alcohol, I see the glass half empty! Also, we went on happy hour and for three happy hour priced dishes, two alcoholic cocktails and a few beers our check was around $60.00. However, with that being said, the quality of the food is tantamount to the price it is worth. The presentation, location, atmosphere and service warrant the full price. My advice is go for happy hour, and limit drinks...Oh God. I sound like my mom. 

Will be here again, maybe for dinner so I can try the Mac and Cheese or Ahi Tuna Sandwich with dessert. They also have beer cocktails which sound fun."}
{"text":"Great attentive service, the host put my party first among tons of other people which was 5 star services among my part. The food was excellent, server was very timely and motivated. I highly recommend for those in the Westlake area or those traveling to give the Yard House, as the service and environment is on point. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Such great food! Ordered the turkey burger! It has carrots in the Patty, I ordered it with lettuce, tomato and onion. The side salads here are very delicious. I love the ranch dressing. The French fries are super crispy and delicious. We also ordered the nachos.they are so tasty. The chicken tenders are really good. The Mac and cheese was OK. It had a odd taste. But still edible. The server was really Nice. However the hostess was kind of rude."}
{"text":"My friend and I sat down at the only 2 open seats at the bar 2 hours before Coyotes opening night and the place was packed. As someone who works in the industry myself, I felt necessary to point out how AWESOME all the bartenders were Thursday night in giving great service, dealing with a mad rush, and not compromising anything in the guest experience. Travis dealt with us the most, and he kicked ass and did a great job. Just thought the entire bar staff should be recognized for a job well done Thursday! I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"We're from the Phoenix area and chose Yardhouse. We only had a 20 minutes wait to be seated. We ordered our meal and chose the onion rings as an appetizer. When the appetizer arrived it was like it was recently removed from a refrigerator.
When we asked for another, there was no problem. However, my dinner salad came and then the meal came, and then the appetizer came. I ordered the fish and chips, they were cold, my friend got the steak, it was cold as well. His fries were also way overcooked. 
I don't know where they hire their cooks from but it was very embarrassing for our waitress to go through trying to explain to us why this all happened. She did a very good gob.
I would suggest to future patrons that they ask if the food is cooked the day of instead of from breakfast the day before. I would've fired each one of those cooks responsible for making a somewhat nice experience into the fiasco they put us through. I can now compare our experience like it was a drive thru at McDonalds"}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch. This place is not on strip but easy to locate if you are roaming around LINQ. I love Yard House in general. Great ambiance and amazing food. Tomato soup was out of this world - super yummy. Probably that was the best I have ever had. We also ordered chicken bowl and baja fish tacos both were good."}
{"text":"3-6 happy hour $2 off draft beers and I love their sliders or the big juicy burgers on potato bun."}
{"text":"Yard House has never really been my favorite place, until I was introduced to happy hour. Not only do they offer great deals on beer and cocktails but the food specials are fantastic. The portion size is good enough for a party of 3 at the most. We ended up ordering the chicken nachos which by the way were absolutely delicious and the best part was, that it was good enough for 4 people.
Service was decent, they forgot to bring our drinks s couple times but overall service was good and employees were attentive. 
I will definitely continue to come back as long as they continue to have Happy Hour 10pm to closing."}
{"text":"This is place IS Beer Heaven!  Over 100+ taps of amazing beers! This is the ONLY place I will purchase [several] beers at full price, not on happy hour. 
Amazing thing #2 ~ (for the girls) they have a \"shorty\" glass which is a 9oz glass instead of 12oz, it is a beautiful thing! Now I can order two different kinds of beer without getting overly full (er bloated), instead of the two big 12oz glasses! 
Amazing thing #3 ~ The food is delish!!! My boyfriend and I split a burger. Bad idea. It was so good we really didnt want to share it afterall ;)
Amazing thing #4 ~ The staff are awesome! There are several staff behind the bar and ALL are happy and willing to help you if your initial server is MIA. They are very attentive, friendly and helpful if you can't decide :) 
Amazing thing #5 ~ The atmosphere is awesome and the music they play is great!"}
{"text":"There was a 40 minute wait for a table so we headed over to the bar.

Blech, I didn't like my Hofbrau Dunkel wiezen or the Franziskaner Hefe-Dunkel. I wish they carried the Erdinger brand.

For food, we got the mac & cheese and grilled romaine salad. The mac & cheese was extremely heavy. I like the mushrooms in it but the chicken and bacon didn't go well with the pasta. The grilled romaine salad was not what I remember it. It was a fine salad though. I have to remember that with establishments like this I should get safe items (i.e. hamburger, Guinness, etc.).

I'd say this is a good place to eat when you want a simple convenient meal but I wouldn't wait in line to eat here."}
{"text":"Yeah, I am a fan ... It's the 4th year in a row for me staying at the Flamingo for a trade show I go to every year and it's my 3rd year in a row coming into this Yardhouse for a meal.  I love the location of the Yardhouse at the end of the Linc street mall.  You can wait for a table here but I have either come in slightly off of peak or eaten at the bar.  They have a superior beer and cocktail selection.  They have TVs everywhere tuned to different games. They have a great menu with good options for carnivores to vegans.  They have nice entrees (had the salmon this time) lots of burger and sandwich selections (had those in the past) and plenty of appetizers to choose from.  Did I mention they have great beer and cocktails and TVs with sports on everywhere??!  Prices are typical, service is solid and value is delivered.  Want a sports bar ... there are two in this area, Yardhouse and Tilted Kilt, and I give the nod to Yardhouse for the food and drink.  I think my hotel location will change for the trade show visit I make every year...  If so, it wont be in this area ...but I may still find myself on the Linc street mall and in the Yardhouse one night.  Thanks for being so reliable Yardhouse.  See you soon."}
{"text":"The staff is great, the atmosphere is great, and obviously the drinks are great. The only downfall is that the pizza I had (the bbq chicken pizza) was not as good as other places (for my taste). It was a bit on the greasy side with a thicker crust than I prefer. If you like thin, crunchy, flatbread type of BBQ chicken pizza, I would not recommend it."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Just the simple fact that you get all you can imagine on draft and a house full of big screen TVs should put this place on top of any guys list. Me and my girlfriend visit this location at least once a week and the quality is almost identical every time. My favorite beverage is their GREATNESS, Its a combination of Guinness and Lost Coast Great White, Light with a bit a kick YUM :)... The only thing thats a bit on the negative side is the wait time. Weekends it can take up to an hour if not more for them to seat you but at the end the experience is well worth it every time.
Thanx Yard House :)"}
{"text":"We love this place!! Cool atmosphere and great beers on tap! Come during happy hour for some great appetizers! My favorite is the chicken lettuce  wraps! Also, our waitress Karah was awesome! Super attentive and friendly!!"}
{"text":"Went there for happy hour and dinner and it was great as usual.  The service was great and we were continually checked on but not in that annoying fashion, just quick check ins to make sure we were ok.  The crab and artichoke dip was amazing and I got the turkey cheese melt (or whatever its called) and it was amazing!  The fries aren't to my liking, but they compliment the meal enough.

We sat on the patio which was heated since its still January.  It was warm, the beer was cold and the food was great.  What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Average place, go there only if you want to drink, the waitress wasn't even interested when i said i am not drinking alcohol !!! anyways, the food was just mediocre and the value for money is not that good... the place is big, seating is good."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going here every year for the past 5 years for our anniversary. I know there's other places we can go to. That's why we have the rest of the year to do that. We always get great service. My wife loves how they make the drinks. We both love the food. And our kids love the leftovers lol. We will keep going there every year."}
{"text":"Very good everything ! Also we had chocolate beer and then raspberry bear 3/4 mixed with chocolate on top and it was awesome girls drinking beer drink lol :)! Our waiter was such a sweet guy and food, service, atmosphere was for 5 stars :)"}
{"text":"First time here & loved it! Tai & Sal are some of the best bartenders I've ever encountered in decades of drinking. They are so engaging and super knowledgeable about the beers on tap, different styles, & beer history. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to yard house tonight as a treat. We are moving out of state so this is sadly the last time for a while we will be able to enjoy Yard house. It took forever to be seated but we picked the wrong time for dinner and didn't make reservations. 

Once we were seated we were greeted by Dallas. She was amazing. She told us about the \"Pick 4\" so I could try my own choices of drinks. It was awesome. She continued to keep a positive attitude all night long always making us smile or laugh when she stopped by the table. Our food was amazing. 

Thank you yardhouse and even more thank you to Dallas for a great night."}
{"text":"Was extremely disappointed in both the food and service.   Ordered the soup and  pizza. It was okay , but I thought a little heavy on the garlic.  I pulled off 11 garlic segments.  My companion ordered the beef sandwich along with French onion soup. The sandwich came without the ajour to dip in. By the condition of the soup it was obvious that it had sat for a long time under heating lights. We didn't bother to call over the server as the food took ages to come out 

Although the surprising part of the meal was the Mac and cheese for the kids. The servings were huge 

We wanted to eat fast and move on so the two little boys (who were super well behaved) didn't disturb other diners 

The wait for any type of attention from our server was so long I stood up to find a couple of boxes to put leftovers in. We asked for the bill and that was another wait as was collecting the money

All in all I don't think I will be back"}
{"text":"I come here all the time after work and sit at the bar, only because of the bartender Steve. He's amazing and gives better service than anyone here. Get the Wisconsin cheese curds, holy crap."}
{"text":"Beers, beers, and more beers.  The selection is outstanding.  Great place to tip import brews that your local establishment has never heard of.  The food is slightly above pub-grub grade and the generous portions are a good value."}
{"text":"Easily one of my favorite places in Vegas. 

The food is absolutely fantastic
The best beer selection in both quality and quantity
Amazing happy hour; try the marg pizza or wings
Casual and laid back atmosphere
Many TVs with all the games on
Great for a date, family dinner or just drinks
Prices are very reasonable, even for Vegas

Now beyond all this, my girlfriend and I are both servers in the Vegas industry. We have high expectations, especially in this town. We have made a tradition that after every Red Rock hike we go to Yardhouse. I say this because the service stands out with and possibly beyond everything else. Now we usually sit at the bar, and every bartender is cheerful, attentive, patient and more than happy to talk you through food and beer.

This week, I was beyond impressed when Oz not only came over to greet us right away, but remembered the beer he let me sample well over a week before. Hats off to you my friend."}
{"text":"This, of course, is one of the greatest places to go and hang out.  It is like BEER HEAVEN if you ever want to try a new flavor and sick of the routine choices.  Place is amazing, great service etc.  Had the burger (3 on a five scale) and salad (average in many respects).  You can't go wrong as far as a place to hang out and do business deals etc.  One thing - if you are going to buy a t-shirt (I bought two of their shirts which are really nice and comfortable), make sure you buy it WHILE YOU ARE SITTING AT THE TABLE, we had to wait around 15 minutes after we closed out our bill just to pay for the shirts. Such is life I guess.  At any rate, definitely fan of the Yardhouse and have been to multiple locations!  Go for it!

PS Tried to buy the yardhouse hat but when you take the sticker off the bill, it shows a round circle there (need to fix that, it's like the products you buy that you can never get the sticker price off).

PSS Don't let me forget to mention they have the BEST music rolling there (I am not going to say what it is - you will have to go for yourself and check it out) but let me say BE CAREFUL you could use an application like Soundhound and spend more money on iTutnes songs than you pay for eating!! FUN PROBLEM TO HAVE THOUGH!!!

PSSS The BEST hamburger in town is at Bobby Q's off the 17.  I have a review on that.  Trust me on that one.  Find your sizzle!

Great job guys!!

Have fun, and find your sizzle!

We where going to leave but the Manger and our waitress Nikki fixed it right away and took it all off our bill. And it was real real good 
Ike omg good melt in your mouth good. I will and we will be back again and again ."}
{"text":"Best location in town. Most of the time us locals avoid the strip like the plague but this location is great for lunch. Great atmosphere and they have a wide range of drink options. The menu literally has everything from burgers and sandwiches to seafood and pasta. I suggest trying the \"California Roll\" appetizer. It's delicious! I'll definitely be back for my next lunch date."}
{"text":"It's always a hit or miss! Usually the food is typically on point it's the service that is in consistent. Rachell was our server this time around. Surprisingly they weren't busy, no wait to be seated or anything. As soon as we sat we waited about 12 mins for someone to even take our drink order. Finally when Rachell asked us what we wanted to drink it wasn't till about another 10 mins till we received our waters. 

When she returned she seemed like she was in a rush. We quickly ordered, then the waiting game began again. The amount of wait time is really unacceptable for what we ordered. I LOVE the food here which is why we constantly come back but it's the service and wait time that has me taking other options at times. 

This time around the Poke Stack which I love wasn't fresh, the chicken fingers had no flavor neither did the fries. Other then that the food is really a bang for your buck. I don't know why the service is so inconsistent. Rachell was not friendly not approachable and gave the vibe that she was to busy to attend. 

The manager on duty walked past us and we requested to change the chicken finger order he was very friendly and served us efficiently. Everytime we come across management they are beyond helpful it's the servers that need some costumer service training. Don't look so upset when your serving your customers it gives an unapproachable vibe. Then again that almost half the staff of YardHouse. The food is what keeps us coming back it's definitely not the customer service."}
{"text":"Came in with a party of 8 with 5 being children a a couple teenagers. Just wanted a night out with the kids and the sister in-laws. Not only are the host upfront not the most welcoming but so is the rest of their staff. It's really hard to find good service now we live in a city that constantly deals with guest service and yet it's always a fail to walk out of a restaurant feeling welcomed. 

I understand happy hour probably isn't TE ideal time to get full service but it doesn't give anyone the right to lose their manners. Not 1 excuse me, thank you or anything came from our server Carl. From snatching the menus to throwing down the straws and that face he would make as we placed our orders was just completely unprofessional. Since we had the kids with us I stepped away from the table to contact a manager. 

When I approached the hostess stand the gentlemen at the stand was assisting other guest. A lady walked up with another unwelcoming look on her face I approached her in regards to speaking with a manager. When the manager arrived I informed him on the service, he was apologetic and took 2 kids meals and our desert off the bill.  

The happy hour is well worth it. The food is good and the portions are great! Not to mention the delicious raspberry beer."}
{"text":"Darlene was our server on Saturday...she was very informative and attentive and so nice!! She was the most genuine server I've had the delight of being served by in a long time!! She gave me a sample of a beer, didn't care for it, and gave me another that she recommended and it was phenomenal. The lettuce wraps were better than PF Chang's and the Clam Chowder blew my metaphorical balls off. WOULD recommend:D"}
{"text":"I go to this place at least twice a month. Great food. Great people. Great suroundings. 
They lost my ATM card once....not sure how! Just watch them when it comes to the bill."}
{"text":"Spent a busy Saturday night having dinner at the Yard House.  We ordered the queso as a starter.  After what seemed like way too long, the manager came out to explain that they only had one order of queso left and they accidentally delivered our order to another table!  We were very disappointed but that manager said that he would make it up to us by giving us a complementary appetizer and dessert.  Mistakes happen and we were happy that the manager talked to us directly.  Our food was very good and the dessert was delicious!  My only complaint is that it was very loud in the restaurant!  It was hard to hear my dinner companion across the table!"}
{"text":"This place is solid. Great menu and beer selection. Always super busy."}
{"text":"I stopped in after work on a Monday. They have good Happy Hour prices. The bar area was well staffed. I'm not a beer drinker, but I noticed that they have over sixty beers on tap... from where I was sitting. The food was great (and reasonable) and the drinks were strong! Mixed crowd of younger and older people. Ok atmosphere"}
{"text":"Great place for beer drinkers... that, I am not. I stick with what I know...Ketel One and cran. But there are a LOT of beers on tap.  I went here (at the bar) after an exhausting day of shopping at the Fashion Square. ;-) The wait staff was superb! They were all very attentive. I think that I was greeted by at least four workers. And each of them asked if I needed anything. (I felt like royalty) My burger was made to my liking. Great atmosphere! Great spot to unwind and fill up. :-D"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful lunch on the patio of this new Yardhouse. Beautiful view of the High Roller and Linq. Plenty of beer selections and great lunch choices. The grilled pastrami and mixed field green salad was perfection. Husband had the French dip and clam chowder and he was impressed. The management stopped at our table to see how everything was, which was excellent. Mandy was our server and she was great, very efficient and detailed. We will be back.."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and delicious reasonably prices. Too loud for me on the inside so I sat outside. The music on the outside walkway was pleasant and heard well from where I was sitting. I got the carnitas. Great price and delicious.  For dessert, I got the brownie with coconut ice cream. It was so big, I had to take half of it to go."}
{"text":"I only stopped in here for a beer but I sure picked the right place!  Over 100 taps on display that line the long bar in the center of the restaurant.  My bartender was an older gentleman who was very nice and let me decide what I wanted to drink instead of being pushy.

Amazing beer selection, nice waitstaff.  Cool place to visit!"}
{"text":"Hard to beat this Happy Hour with $2 off craft beers and a glass of wine. $5-8 for appetizers. My wife and I  chose Moo Shu Egg Rolls and a Ham and Pineapple Pizza.(which my friend claims can't be considered a real pizza) but I do not concur. The food was excellent. I had a YH IPA  (Uinta) a somewhat mild IPA, and a GLBC Black Out Stout, which used to be only available on tap at GLBC. I was a little reluctant to try a chain restaurant but was pleasantly surprised. I think you have to try it just to check out the restrooms"}
{"text":"Stopped before heading to flagstaff for some lunch, over 100 beers on tap and large menu to pick from, they also have a lunch menu if you enjoy a budget meal.  I ordered the jack burger very good little kick there are 2 whole jalapeño on it.  House salad is like eating a garden loved it and their onion rings perfect"}
{"text":"I go for beer from time to time, lot of choices, a bit pricey, but it is a tourist area,It is nice to see non locals and hear their stories, always busy so set some time aside ,a for sure visit."}
{"text":"A pretty extensive beer selection, not bad, for North Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Bartenders are amazing with great happy hour. Come and enjoy the great food and drinks."}
{"text":"Good food - and good beer. Good service as well. We often order on Grubhub when we need a fix but are too tired to make it out."}
{"text":"This Yard House in the Linq is definitely trendy and a solid option for food and drink when you're in the area.  The space is huge -- is it the largest YH in the country? -- and the beer list is impressively thorough.  Food is generally well done and satisfies most cravings anyone would have.  I have noticed in the past year that service is hit-or-miss, regardless of which location I've visited.  I frequent the Red Rock Casino location a lot and some days, the servers are fantastic: observant, personable, and very knowledgeable about the menu.  Other times, it's difficult to get the person's attention.  Each time I've dropped by the Linq YH, I've been underwhelmed by my service.  I don't believe that I'm a demanding diner, but I do expect to be acknowledged within 5-10 minutes of being seated and to receive a smile or two.  However, working in the service industry can be trying at the best of times, so I'm willing to give people some slack."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat. They have a very extensive menu and phenomenal drink list. One of my favorite things to get is the California roll as well as the spicy tuna roll with real ahi poke'. Great atmosphere and chill vibe. The staff and servers were very professional and the food was top notch! A great place to eat if you're passing by of if you're staying in the Red Rock Casino & resort. Go there, now!!!! 

Don't forget to go there for whatever game you intend to watch. The atmosphere is kinetic with excitement!!!! Also,  I am not a vegan or processed vegetarian, but I could order nothing but the gardein wings and be happy."}
{"text":"What is there not to love about Yard House? 

There are only a few restaurants I know of where you can order anything on the menu and it's almost guaranteed amazing. Yard House is one of them! I have been here a dozen times and everything has been 10/10. 

The venue is great! I love how it's located right off of the strip so you can get away from the loud scene but it's also close enough to the strip. 

The service is great, quick, and very helpful! They are very knowledgable with their menu and food! 

Everyone needs Yard House in their lives."}
{"text":"Nothing but good to say about Yard House! Every time I visit Lad Vegas I make sure to stop by this location. 

The service is awesome, with all workers very knowledgable about their menu and food in general. 

Big menu, full of all different types of amazing food. I've tried many different items and they're all awesome! 

The vibe of the restaurant is very good and comfortable. Outdoor seating, and indoor. 

Parking is fast and very accessible. 

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Yardhouse has alway been my personal favorite. I usually recommend it for happy hour. My last visits (not during happy hour) wasn't all that great, but I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt since we were in a party of 8 (our waitress seemed to have forgotten is, food took forever to get here, and my dish came out cold while a few of mind were reheated (wondering why mine was reheated like theres). And this meal happened on a Wednesday. Don't know why it happened, wasn't expecting this to happen on the possibility the slowest day of the week). 

Despite last night, going to try and give the place another try."}
{"text":"Whatever you do, do NOT dine here alone!  They will ignore you until either it's convenient for them to serve you, or you leave.  Whether this is the server's choice or not doesn't matter.  Any establishment with even the tiniest bit of class usually makes solo diners feel welcome.  The Yard House has no class.  Walk in there at your own risk.  But rest assured, if dining solo you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"I eat at the Yard House once a month and order the same meal each time...Steak and Shrimp.  Medium well. Awesome stuff.  My wife and kids also like to eat here.  Service is great and people are very friendly."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME! The service was outstanding from start to finish. I loved that they showed us where the bathrooms were when we walked in. The vibe is great, tons of light and space. There's also a lot of cool art on the walls, definitely with visiting!"}
{"text":"Kim was the best bartender by far! So helpful and very knowledgeable. Five stars across the board. We will be coming back on Friday's to see her! Great experience!"}
{"text":"First time ever YardHouse wasn't good. The one at Town Square is so much better.  I hate paying good money for bad food/service"}
{"text":"I'd been avoiding Yard House ever since a failed attempt at the Red Rock location: long lines, extra-loud music, spillover crowds, and a \"more here to be seen than to eat\" kind of vibe. There's nothing wrong with a busy, happy, trendy place, of course, especially one advertising more beers than anywhere else in the world, but it's not for boring old me.

But, the menu we'd perused online looked so different and interesting (at least for vegetarians) that I had to give in when my husband pushed for a visit before going to see a movie at Rave. Put anything in Town Square and I'll probably visit it at least once.

Even though it was busy and the music was indeed cranked up, it was my kind of music (classic rock), and the space between tables meant we didn't have to feel like we should introduce ourselves to the family at the next table. 

We had two servers during our meal (our first one went on break), and both were as enthusiastic as they were thorough, which is to say amply both. As I ordered, I was pleasantly asked if I'd like my salad dressing on the side, if I was a vegan (so the order could be adjusted if necessary), and - be still my heart - if I was fine with the veggie burger I ordered being a Gardein burger. Seldom do I know what I'm going to get when I order a vegetarian burger. It could be a nuked black-bean patty, it could be a homemade concoction starring bulgur and carrots, or it could be the most dreaded possibility of all: the tasteless Boca puck.

Or it could be the best veggie burger in Las Vegas, which is what I was served at Yard House. Oh boy!

I can't claim it will be the best for every vegetarian. Some people like a strong faux-meat experience, and others want the opposite. I like anything with a traditional burger texture and some kind of spicy flavour with a lot of \"umami\" - fullness, and that's what I got. I went with the potato bun. Fresh, but very squishy. I may try the wheat bun next time.

But before this we'd already been charmed by the appetizers. The Onion Ring Tower - as tall as its name implies - kept luring my fingers back. The rings were crispy but not greasy, with a dust of Parmesan over all.

Throught the meal our lemonades kept coming, each free refill with a ring of sugar around the rim. Okay. We were *definitely* putting Yard House on the short list for sure things.

And, open until 2 a.m.? What was this? And it's a full menu until 2 a.m.? That entire page of Gardein vegetarian items - wings, sliders, thai pizza, sandwiches - plus everything else on the near-novella of a menu is available after most restaurants pack up for the night? And they have half-priced pizzas and appetizers not only during regular happy hour, but also after 10 p.m. (Sunday-Wednesday)? Squeal!"}
{"text":"The staff are so professional and friendly. Our waitress Meka was awesome!!  Lots of beers on tap. They have some delicious happy hour options. Today was my first visit to the Yard House And I will be back."}
{"text":"Garlic noodles - tasty but needed 'stuff' in it like a variety of veggies.
Short rib taco - all right but I was expecting tender beef and not double fried.  My fault, guess that is what Korean style is.
Pork belly taco - again just alright.
I got it to go and ended up dumping the taco filling into the noodles.  I give three start it I would go back on my choice.  I say two and a half for here cause I would try it again but only if a friend asked me to go."}
{"text":"Super awesome spot. 144 beers on draft. Amazing. Food selection was outstanding as well, which might have you thinking they couldn't possibly keep quality up on all dishes. But we were highly impressed! Lobster garlic pasta was succulent and filled with shiitake mushrooms. Southern fried chicken breast was perfectly fried crispy on the outside but moist inside! 
Have to mention our server Tre was superb. Listened. Offered good options. Super helpful and attentive. Price was even reasonable for the area."}
{"text":"We flew in late on a Monday evening and decided to swing by Yard House for some drinks and appetizers.  There weren't a lot of folks out, so it was nice to have the bar practically to ourselves. 

We kept it simple with some beer, a mojito, fried calamari, and crab cakes.  The food was not spectacular, but I suspect the venue is more about beers, sports, and a nice healthy dose of sports fan rowdiness.  I would love to see this place come alive on a Friday, Saturday, or Sunday."}
{"text":"Really good food! The menu has many options unique to everyone's own taste. There's even a section in the menu which is vegan. The food overall is good and the customer service is too."}
{"text":"Food is decent, Customer service is poor. I had a large take out order today. When trying to pick up the order the employee introduced himself as the Conductor of the restaurant and told me he was to busy to help with Togo orders. First of all you should have looked at my order, I probably spent more than most of the people sitting down for your lunch specials. Am I second class because my order is Togo.  I would suggest trying a different location if you want to experience the yard house."}
{"text":"For reasons unknown my son likes to come here when we are at Town Square and each time we have gone I haven't really left thinking anything spectacular. 

Service is hit or miss, mostly miss and food is good but nothing to really YELP about. Till our last visit...

We dined here last Friday night and our server, Brandi was awesome! She was friendly, attentive, suggested some good stuff and made us laugh. She touched the table just enough times for us to feel like we didn't have to search for someone if we needed something. 

As for food, I tried the street tacos. The Korean short rib taco and chicken...really, really good! We also tried the poke stack, delicious!

I'm sure we will be back but I want Brandi's table"}
{"text":"Mediocre restaurant. Beer selection so-so, food is one dimensional. Non of the special layering of flavors you might experience at other restaurants. Food selection is minimal. Service was slow. Based on the food alone, it is over priced."}
{"text":"I was in the mood to go to a place I had not been to before. Desert Ridge has various restaurant from fast casual to fine dining. Yard House seemed like the best fit for my companion and I. First observation was how efficient everything was running. Wait staff, kitchen...appeared to be moving along and they were busy! Our server was attentive without cloying, witty without ingratiating, and down to earth. We greatly appreciated her and that improved the experience overall. The Apple Cider brined pork chop was divine, as was the roasted veg. My Cobb salad with skirt steak was also delicious minus the skirt steak. *disclaimer* I am not a meat eater so this is not unusual for me. I didn't really want any kind of meat so it would not have mattered, nothing YH could have done. It wasn't you (YH), it's me. Make sure you have dessert!! The trio of Mimi's allows you to taste and enjoy without going over the line. The apple cobbler is the bomb.com.gov.org.net. Second is the chocolate soufflé...ohhh so happy with the soufflé. Anyway, YH is a large chain and I like their product-good work guys! We will be back."}
{"text":"We loved it. Late hours, cool vibe, HUGE menu, and great service. Oh yeah - fairly reasonable prices for LV and the Strip. Walked right in this Sunday night at 10pm. Had the summer salad as a starter; we both liked it. Our mains were the Sweet & Spicy Chicken Sandwich & the Ginger Crusted Salmon.  

The sandwich was good, not great, avg size and with a little kick. Nice helping of fresh skinny fries. The star was the salmon. Nice ginger crust, topped with shaved sweet potato and shredded carrots all on a huge mound of mashed potatoes. The peanut vinagraitte rocked though. Ask for extra.

And a bonus: You can actually get a mixed drink for less than $18-20 on the strip!

Great food and value. We'll go back."}
{"text":"We were recently here, late night, after a concert at the Gila River Arena. Staff was nice, venue was big. We sat outside on the patio. We ordered some drinks and two appetizers - onion rings and hummus plate. The onion rings were good, they come in a HUGE stack with more onion rings than I had anticipated for the price. The hummus on the other hand was small and bland. I was extremely disappointed, I didn't know you could go wrong with hummus! The pita bread that accompanied said hummus was bland was well and very bready. The service was great and friendly. I might try ordering something else next time."}
{"text":"I was craving ribs, so the first place I sat and ate, when I got to LV was here.  I was really happy to have found it.  I'm only taking a star off, because I could tell that the hostesses wanted me to sit and eat at the bar instead of getting a table/booth.  I came to EAT, not be a cast member on the show Cheers.  

I did get the ribs.  They were good.  Didn't love the sauce.  I'm a bigger fan of a mild and sweet sauce.  But believe it or not, the ribs were better with LESS sauce, rather than more sauce. 

But, let me say this...THE CREAM CORN MIGHT BE THE GREATEST THING EVER!  If I wind up on death row, I'm gonna want this as part of my last meal!

And, the prices aren't crazy, either."}
{"text":"Yard House is great, however, I am sometimes disappointed.  For those of you that love ahi tuna like me, I do not recommend ordering the poke stack.  They want to charge $13 for an appetizer that consisted of a few chunks of fish that sit on top of one large chip.  Underneath the chip is the \"filler\" of some kind of raw slaw then a few more chunks of fish hiding under it.  Oh, and the avocado?  A few slivers (maybe a 1/4) of an avocado) sitting off to the side.  That is not a poke stack.  If they want to serve it that way, then it should be on the snack portion on the menu for $5.  It was a pathetic interpretation.  I still love Yard House and will continue to dine there, but prefer to stick to what I know is good."}
{"text":"I know yard house is a chain, so don't judge me! Lol...but I have nothing but positive things to say about this yard house location...I called at 9:30ish during March Madness asking about reverse happy hour and Hiclay (hostess) was so awesome! She gave me all the details and went above and beyond service!! When we arrived at the restaurant we were even more blown away from Hiclay's service, then Evan's (our waiter) service - outstanding!! Please give a raise to both Hiclay & Evan, they are a prized employee to have at YH. :-)"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to visit when on vacation. While being a chain, it does not have the feel of a chain restaurant. I had the surf and turf burger cooked medium rare. The burger was juicy and there was a health serving of crab and asparagus on the burger. Others at the table had street tacos, Mac and cheese and even a vegetarian dish. All were happy about the taste, portions, and price."}
{"text":"I've been going to Yardhouse for quite some time, before it even came to Las Vegas. (I've even had an actual yard of beer, which has now been relegated to a display case by the hostess stand.  Should they change their name to Half-Yardhouse? :)) I think I may have emailed Yardhouse in a drunken rage one night in 2004 because they did not have a location here, but they were opening one in Phoenix. But anyway... now we have two!

Some friends wanted to meet up here and I felt a little apprehensive because it is always crazy crowded.  All twelve of us squeezed into one of the long booths, which was a feat and just started ordering.  It worked out surprisingly well thanks to the attentiveness and patience of the staff.  They kept clearing as needed and just made it work with a fun, can-do attitude.

Two things I did not know about Yardhouse:
1) Apparently someone took the time to type in all the ingredients to all the dishes into their Micros (aka ordering machine computer  thing).  So if you have people in your group with allergies (we had two), they can get a printed list of all the ingredients lickity-split.  None of that, \"I asked the cooks and they think it may not have peanuts in it.  Maybe.\"
2) On Monday night, during football season, happy hour is from 3pm until close!  How come no one said anything!?!  Check out http://www.yardhouse.com/NV/las_vegas/ for all the happy hour options and prices.  Maybe this is to compete with LBS that has a $15 mug one-time purchase with 10 cent refills promotion?  Not sure if the Monday happy hour applies to the Town Square location...

Plus, a bonus for me is that they actually had Goose Island Matilda on tap, which is my favorite beer.  Last couple times I came to visit it was tapped out.  

The only thing that sucks a little is that their firecracker wings have gone the way of the yard.  Back in the day they were actually spicy as the name would imply. But apparently, like the yard of beer, they were too spicy from some folks and finally management relented.  Now they are just wimpy and sweet.

Nevertheless, all in all a good night at the Yardhouse! Reminscient of those days of old in Socal."}
{"text":"Great to have a dedicated vegetarian menu here!  The staff are all very attentive and polite."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The restaurant is vey big and open and has a lot of windows so you can see the shops. They had a few vegan options which was so exciting for me since most places don't have any options at all. I got the vegan burger and it was delicious. Jenna was our waitress and she was so sweet and friendly even though we were needy. Totally recommend!"}
{"text":"We were sat immediately. Decor kinda dark. Could barely see the menu. Ordered the Nashville Chicken. Was very good balanced well with the Sweet Potato Pancakes. Ordered a side salad. Was a pretty big salad. Bother entree and salad were very good. Attentive waitress. Good service. Oh yeah appetizer was the Egg Rolls and they were excellent."}
{"text":"The French onion soup is really flavorful. The spinach cheese dip is tasty but not a very big portion. Our waitress , Lexi, was fantastic, very pleasant and informative. Had the Belgium six pack sampler. The six pack sampler is a must for anyone that wants to get a little taste. There's s traditional one also but I'll have to try that next time. 
The husband ordered the chicken enchilada stack which looked very tasty. He said it was good but he's not a man of many words. 
I ordered the vodka shrimp pasta. I will say there was certainly a lot of shrimps which is surprising!"}
{"text":"Big fan of yard house especially this location at Town Square, because it's a usual family friendly spot for happy hour where the parents can enjoy food and a few adult beverages and then walk it off at Town Square afterwards :)  Yet it's also a cool spot to hang with co-workers or friends.  A good mix of either, yet when your their with the family you don't feel awkward because so many other people are having family nights out and then when you are there with adults only, you aren't bothered by all the kids around, which is pretty rare to find a place that can manage to do both at the same time.  Maybe because it's a little dim and louder inside, but either way how the booths and tables are set up it's not too loud where you can't hear each other talk.

Happy hour menu is one of the best I think in town.  A variety of good choices that aren't just appetizer size, but could be full meals, so getting a good amount for what you pay for. 

Garlic noodles, poke stack, sliders, onion stack and cheese pizza for the kids are our go-tos.  I have had items off the happy hour menu and those were delicious too.  I don't think I've ever had anything I don't like here.  Recently had the mushroom lettuce wraps while doing the Daniel fast and those were really good as well.

A good local go to spot for us, especially for Family Friday nights at Town Square :)"}
{"text":"Pizza was cold food took a long while.....then had to hunt down a server to get utensils .... I recommend not coming here... Our server was Alison was very lazy to check in on us while we waited a long time to get our order and had to hunt her down to tell her the pizza was cold .... However , another server on the other side of the room Summer was helpful to fill our glasses of water and was a very attentive to her patrons. I do not recommend coming here and redirect you to mc Donald's instead."}
{"text":"The BEST grilled cheese with tomato soup (vegetarian) that I have ever had. Across the board. Across the states. Kicks Giada's grilled cheese at her Las Vegas restaurant out of the park. It is very classic, simple, and melt-in-your-mouth yummy. The waiter was new and he was fantastic, I wish I could remember his name! Excellent service, great draft beer selection, wonderful wine selection, and great menu indicators such as vegetarian, under 600 calories, etc."}
{"text":"I agree with some of the reviewers, this place can be really loud.  I have been there several times only because it is convenient before or after the movies.  The food is ok, not horrible, not cuisine.  The drinks could be better."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great people watching, great food. Lots of vegan options. 
They serve Gardein which is a meat substitute suitable for vegans and put it in a lot of their dishes. 
Our server, Clint, was understanding, kind, brilliant and very helpful. 
I had the Avocado & Swiss burger, minus the Swiss and the Garlic Aioli (made with eggs). I ordered the hummus w pita and smeared that all over my burger. It was fantastic. 
Our food took a ridiculous amount of time to get there, but I'm sure it was just a mix up and I don't hold it against anyone. The place was MAD BUSY on a Saturday night during a Coyote's game but we were seated in about 3 minutes. 
People around us were getting their food on time. Probably just a fluke :) The people watching was great and the time really flew by.
Their draft beer selection was fab! I had an IPA the name escapes me. Green something."}
{"text":"Love the beer selections and the menu looked great but I didn't get much of a chance to peruse it. The location is also a little bizarre, being tucked away at the back of the new Promenade section. It's not idea for people watching if that's what you're looking for and still amazingly crowded because it's new. Our servers were very nice, one was training the other, but not sure if I'd make it a return visit for the price."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas for 4 days and I ate here twice.  I had the same table and waiter George.  George is an awesome waiter.  If I ever make it back I would definitely ask for George.  It is has an upscale sports bar feel.  I am not a beer drinker but they have loads of beer on tap.  You can come with a group and there are enough menu options to please everyone."}
{"text":"This is an awesome place! So many beers on tap, great samplers and you CANNOT beat Yardhouse happy hour! You can get a full pizza, a few drinks and dessert for about $30.  Music is always good and the service is always quick and friendly! This is my favorite location in Vegas."}
{"text":"Not sure if there anything too add on top of thousands of reviews. It was my first time coming too this Yard House location in the Red Rock Casino. I have been too the one in Town Square Mall. Really not much difference between them just the location and fan of both. The menu is HUGE sometimes can be good thing or bad thing. I stopped here for lunch after nice long bike ride up too Red Rock Loop with friends. Something caught me eye on the menu. I never notice before was they have small lunch special section half sandwich and soup. It straight forward but lot of things that enjoy about it. They have four too five sandwiches and soups too choose from mix and match. The portion size the sandwich is decent size combine with a nice cup of soup for under $10 think steal of deal. I got the pastrami sandwich with clam chowder soup. Both were excellent! The pastrami nice hot, moist, fan of the bread, and like the spread in it. The clam chowder was solid have decent amount of clams, potatoes, and even cup of soup felt hearty and filling. If you want can even up size your cup too bowl of soup at cost. It perfect meal after getting great workout in light, hearty, and healthy lunch. 

The service was fantastic. We went as soon as they opened at 11am. Still our waitress was great, friendly, and informative she was the one that told us about upgrade our cup too bowl is want for extra charge. If looking place for light lunch or heavy lunch Yard House has it and that not even going into the beer list."}
{"text":"We've wanted to try the Yard House for awhile, and we finally achieved that goal this past weekend.  It was a wonderful experience, probably the best we've had at a chain style restaurant.  
Our server was very friendly without being pushy. She let us know that she was there of we had questions,  but she didn't hover over us. 
The drinks we ordered were delicious - little pricy compared to some other places, but they tasted good.  
Now to the food....I honestly cannot say enough about how amazingly yummy the food was. My boyfriend cannot stop talking about the garlic shitake noodles that he had! I got the crispy brussel sprouts and ripped potatoes for an appetizer, the dish was very tasty. A good amount for the size of an appetizer - the boyfriend and I shared it and still took some home. 
The entrees were 2 of the best entrees we've ever had anywhere.  I ordered the Blackened Gardein Chicken Torta and he had the Gardein orange peel chicken.  Gardein chicken is a faux meat, and the yard house is one of the very few places to offer literally a whole section of choices. They expertly prepared the dishes,  infused so much flavor and spice into both, it was heaven in my mouth. I must say, the fries that came with my sandwich were pretty weak though. I wish I had been offered a choice of sides because the Uber skinny fries are not a fave.
It was not cheap to eat here, so unfortunately,  we won't be back very often. But it is a new restaurant that we will try to go to at least once a month. If you're looking for a place to go for a nicer dinner, without being all fancy pants, this may be a good place."}
{"text":"Garlic Seafood Noodles and New York Steak Sandwich with Sweet Potato Fries. Both were excellent. The steak was cooked exactly as ordered and very tender. It came with a sauce on the side that was awesome. The noodles had plenty of lobster, shrimp and other seafood and a great consistency- not too saucy. We started with calamari so there was definitely food to takeout. Service was fast and pleasant."}
{"text":"Came with the family and everyone loved dinner. The staff is SUPER friendly. The menu is big and diverse. We had a bacon cheeseburger, Southern fried chicken breast, shrimp jambalaya and orange chicken. The food presentation was so pretty, we didn't want to eat it. (But we did and it was delicious!) Great ciders and beers. My only critique? Need more chips with the guacamole."}
{"text":"Visited Yard House last week, May 4th.  This is probably my 4th visit tot he restaurant and there is always a few constants.  Its ALWAYS busy (good sign).  I also always find the girls behind the desk have way more attitude than necessary.  Management needs to do some retraining in that area.

Other than that, the cocktails and food are good and they can accommodate large parties."}
{"text":"I've been to Yard House twice, once for dinner and once for lunch. Their lunch specials are very good, and their menu is rather diverse. Everything I've ordered I've enjoyed, and the prices are reasonable.
I agree with other reviewers that, despite it being a chain restaurant, it doesn't feel like a chain."}
{"text":"They have skinny margaritas now!!! Hurray!! 

While I believe Yard House has lost it's allure over the past year and is probably only 3* worthy, I'm bumping it up thanks to their low cal drink menu. This Fresh & Skinny menu is fabulous and features several drinks in addition to the skinny margarita, including a lemon drop, a cosmo and a few others. I can tell you the skinny margarita tasted super sweet and the only difference is the missing salt rimmer - which unfortunately just happends to be my favorite part :-(  These drinks are between 115-175 calories. Not bad!

The food is average - since I'm a salad kind of girl I can't help but to leave a little disappointed. I'd much rather dine elsewhere, but their happy hour menu is extensive and with all the drink options, it's pretty easy to find a drink and appy for everyone.

We used to do happy hour here all the time, now we find ourselves here only once a month, if that."}
{"text":"Go figure I go out of town to review something local, but stepping into the Yard House here in Town Square was a definite different experience!

To date, this is the biggest Yard House I have stepped into so you can tell that during happy hour it can pack quite a big punch for sure..The location itself is massive and tables are everywhere inside and out which made for a very quick wait time as you can imagine!

Foodwise I decided on the black truffle cheeseburger and after some \"local\" inside of my dinner mates the truffle fries..The burger itself was pretty filling and they certainly know how to prepare a medium rare burger when requested to do so (a pet peeve for me)..The patty was juicy and the showstopper to me was that the truffle sauce accompanying the burger and actually the truffle fries was not heavily salted like I am used to here..It turned around my view that maybe there is more to Yard House then just the Yards?

A low point was our waitress who was either just having quite the Vegas night or a Scrooge year round..Initially she threw the coasters down on the table as we ordered drinks and continued to slam down random items at will through out the meal (ketchup, food, etc), but did seem to try the cliche schmoozing when it came time for the delivery of the bill..That was a bit disappointing as it did have all of us blank staring each other if we really just witnessed this, but it did not rule the meal in the end!

The overall atmosphere seemed quite calm, cool, and relaxing..It did have it's share of loud tables, but you must make lemonade when given lemons"}
{"text":"This is for teh townsquare loc.The food quality was superb and better than I expected for never having been at a yardhouse before.Loved the huge draft selection and I did imbibe alot on various styles of beer.Truly enjoyable. Bride & I both enjoyed the food from apps to entrees and the service was excellent,even though it became quite busy.We unknowlingly entered at happy hour and perhaps ordered more libations and apps than we would normally would have but we had just landed a few hours earlier and were glad to try something new,overall superb and will def return"}
{"text":"So my husband and I went to Yard House last night for dinner. It was quite loud and also very warm. We definitely enjoyed the hundred plus beers they had on tap along with my favorite alpine duet which was delicious.We ordered salads and we split an entrée a pork chop with sweet mashed potatoes and a Bourbon cherry sauce and broccoli. Service was pretty good however our salads got to the table and about two minutes later our entrées got to the table. It is like the biggest pet peeve for me of anything because I like to sit and enjoy my salad before I eat my dinner. When they noticed that they were bringing the Entrée out too soon they didn't suggest anything like remaking our entrée or comping us the salad which I didn't even eat. It would've been nice to of had that comped since I didn't get a chance to eat it on my food with and cold. The pork chop dish was delicious with the exception of a little too much Sage. Sage and thyme are two of those things that you have to be careful with it cannot be too aggressive. Otherwise the entrée was delicious salad would've been delicious if I'd had the opportunity to eat it before my entrée shut up. Sometimes I think it's almost like you have to remind them not to placeFor your entrée until you are almost done with your salad which really shouldn't be the patrons job."}
{"text":"Eh..... 2 stars for the service, zero for the food. Let me explain. our waitress didn't listen. Kind of an important skill for a waitress right? Well unfortunately, she \"forgot\" a lot of things. My burger was raw, she forgot our drinks, and she was MIA for a lot of time.  Luckily, the manager/assistant manager was awesome. She totally picked up the slack and made sure my food was actually cooked and gave us a discount for the mess-up.  Sadly, my burger was not worth the wait. It was kind of bland and my fiancé had finished his food by the time my food came out. Not sure if I would come back."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Yard House's happy hour!!! 
If you're in the mood for a good beer and good food, this is the place to be. Other than their happy hour, their regular menu and food is good. I've been coming here for my birthday dinner for the past 3 years. I love this place. I recently went here with my sister. 

If you're a tuna fan, try their Hawaiian Poke Stack. 
If you're a blue moon/guiness fan, try an Eclipse."}
{"text":"Love the ambiance and overall appeal of yardhouse.

Lets begin with how awesome the happy hour is. 3 to 6pm

All the apps are 50 percent off and the burgers with fries are 3.50 cheaper. The portions are huge and the food is delicious. 

When we go for happy hour we get their chicken nachos, four cheese pizza (my two year old would kill for it!) chicken wings and chicken strips (which comes with fries)

Next time we shall get their spinach dip.

The nachos have red enchiladas sauce, guac, sour cream. Cheese, beans, and a tangy green sauce. Four cheese pizza is pretty big, more than enough for one person. I wish the crust was crispier but it was still good especially for the price. Chicken wings came in three favors and were great. 10 came on a plate. The chicken strips are very crispy but its not a usual crisp. They're light and have more of a Chinese tempora outside. The fries were thin and great. 

The beers are half priced as well but I didn't try it.

They had other lunch specials and dinner specials but I shall save that for next time when I write my update!"}
{"text":"I always leave this place happy. Thank you again for the amazing service, I only wish I remember my servers name. 
I went there for their happy hour and got the buffalo wings and a pint of raspberry cider. 
For those who've been there, you know their buffalo wings are amazing but they also have 3 other sauces. 
I like to get my buffalo wings with the fire cracker sauce on the side. Sooo good. It brings me back to the Bahamas for some reason but again, try it because it's really good. 
Our server brought me samples of the different types of cider which is awesome because I got to pick which one I like. I'm usually very picky with ciders because of the artificial tastes but when he gave me samples, I got to pick which one I like better. I really liked the raspberry cider because it was light, not too sweet, and sparkling. 
As always, they had amazing service which is the key to having a successful business. I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Always great food at Yardhouse, especially their Gardein selections for the vegetarians. Trenton was our server and he was very helpful, friendly and fast with our service."}
{"text":"Yard house has a huge variety of drinks and food. This town square location is always busy whenever I come in but we usually sit at the bar so no waiting for a table. The bartenders are friendly and quick most of the time. 
I usually go with the hawaiin moscow mule and street tacos. It can get very loud in here during peak times. It's probably the most popular spot at town square on fri sat night.
My favorite dish of all is the garlic noodles with seafood."}
{"text":"We had below average service from our waiter. Appetizer was never put in, and we waited awhile for our food with no drinks, but the manager really saved the day. He was amazing and when my beer was late, he gave me a small glass of Pacifico to tide me over until they restocked my beer. When our appetizer came after our meal (because he put in the order himself) he comped it and he was truly an awesome guy, food was amazing per usual. Waiter apologized which was cool and I'll continue to come back because we were treated pretty well."}
{"text":"I went on a Sunday and with a sunday night football there on a side of the stadium, the place was packed, good beer and GREAT service from staff... but the food was awful, well, we only ordered \"beer food\" nachos: cold and no flavor, wings, bland, sliders: cold and bad, street tacos: really? street tacos? flour tortillas, and also very very cold... I would go back but never order appetizers..."}
{"text":"Much better on subsequent visits.  Love the selection of beer and I haven't had a disappointing meal since my first visit."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a handful of times for lunch. I know they have a huge if not the largest selection of beer on tap in town (but its lunch time and I don't care for beer so this is about the food). I'd say the food Qualtiy is a touch above average. I had a burger last time I was there and actually thought they served me a slider at first the burger was so tiny. Tasty but tiny. Now the fries were fantastic! Shoestring fries hot salty and tasty-and a nice portion too! Servers have always been very pleasant. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Food was not impressive at all. For a place located in a fast paced, crowded - prime spot in Vegas.. Heck their other location in Glenview, IL located middle of nowhere serves more flavorful dish. Same menu - tastes completely different. 
Maybe their rookie chef cooked mine??"}
{"text":"It been while but had my cousin and her husband in town from Sac. I thinking of good place too go hang out have some good food, good beer, television around watch game, and not loud can hang out talk stories catch up. Yard House would be the perfect place although it can be loud. I went on tuesday night so not so bad plus ended up sitting outside on the outdoor cover patio area. It worked out great! =)

I checked in too my surprise the wait was not very long got buzzed less then ten mins. Just first glance the place was packed that night. The server she was great about being patience since cousin guys running late. The first things I LOVE about the YH but at the same time frustrating figure out beer too start the night, The list is so long if there something that not find or something similar too likely would be very surprised. I went with the Kona Brewery Fire Rock Ale. I love my Kona Brewery not only because from Hawaii but good beer! The most common one see is Longboard so saw another one on tap! Hell yay! The rest of the night went with another my favorite Firestone Pale Ale. It another one that hardly see on tap at bars. I love there beer still have since visited Firestone winery. 

The food was good as always! It been while but remember the Hawaiian Poke Stack stood out for me. Poke never go wrong in life. I love the way everything balances together. The Poke nice and fresh soy style Poke. The crispy wonton that adds little crispy fried texture plus works out great scoop up all the Poke. The vegetable gives it more depth and flavors too the dish. The wasabi soy drizzle around nice accent too the whole dish. It daunting looking at it start height. Once break down all good stuff. The second app had the bearnaise slider. Honestly not really big fan. I asked the server she recommend as second app. It more miss then hit. The slider meat itself nothing special little dry side. The bearnaise sauce itself nothing special. You combine the sauce with the fried onion on top of the slider and the bun. Ok. Sure pass on sliders plus heavy app start the meal.

I had the Street Taco (Chicken tinga). I wanted too try something different then my last visit. I glad I did! It was awesome. The combination of the chipotle tomatoe sauce plus the feta cheese right balance with spice and cheese. I enjoyed the fact not over stuffed with things in the taco. I added the beans and rice. The rice was tasty stuff. The beans honest never got too because the beers and apps all stuff. 

Dessert my cousin and I split a Lemon Souffle off our sever recommendation. She got right on. It was not your traditional souffle. That it would be bursting like ballon out of the dish. It smaller portion really for one. Dessert we were all pretty full but try something sweet. It was just right amount of lemon and whipping cream or ice cream on top. It perfect dish too end the night. Good good, good times, and family!!"}
{"text":"Large seating area with room for large parties of people. 

Ordered a cheese burger and salad. Food was fresh and flavorful, large portion, quick service and friendly waitress.

A little loud because the restaurant is large and crowded, but still a pleasant environment."}
{"text":"I have to thank Ali. Honestly for saving our trip. everybody I was was was convinced it was a low quality spot of service. I was concerned I would get blamed but she single handedly turned our trip around. her chemistry with customers and professionalism made me proud of my 35 years spend in customer service. thank you! have a good new year!"}
{"text":"First off, we rarely visit the casinos or chains unless we have to - but a friend was in town for DICE and staying at Red Rock. We all used to play in rock bands back in LA, so a place playing classic rock seemed seemed like a good fit.

Although the place was packed - we got seated fairly quickly at a bar table in the thick of things.  I don't mind being surrounded by some hustle and bustle, but it was cold out - and every time someone opened the door out to the patio, we got hit with a blast of freezing cold air at our table.  Just a crowded restaurant trying to maximize space I guess.

Beer selection is great - I forgot my reading glasses this time so I couldn't actually READ the menu, so I just went with a Stella.   For food I got the Ahi Crunchy Salad with field greens, asian slaw and crispy wontons tossed in soy vinaigrette (according to the menu) - it was quite good.  

I'm a HUGE fan of al fresco hanging out / drinking / eating, and I'm glad to see that more places in Vegas are embracing it, so I'll probably be back later in the year when it gets a bit warmer and try the patio."}
{"text":"Yard House is great for the overwhelming number of taps available. The food here is your typical deep fried pub grub. We ordered a whole bunch of dishes and while none of them stood out, it was fine since we were here to watch the World Series. That's where this place kind of falls down. Yes, there are screens everywhere. But the angle on a lot of the screens makes watching uncomfortable in a bunch of the booths or even at the bar. Given that it's one of the primary sells of this place, I feel like that's an issue with the restaurant. In some booths, the screens are also really far away. It was kind of a disappointment but at least we were able to get a table during a really crowded time."}
{"text":"I was debating between 4 and 5 stars. But when I couldn't think of a single reason for a deduction... duh! 5 Stars!!
Fat Tire, Peroni, Newcastle Brown, Molson, Lev... all on TAP! What a beautiful and most wonderful thing to have over 100 beers on tap. 
And the food, My God, the food Jerry!! I had the crabcake hoagie and loved it... we also had seared ahi salad, chicken enchilada stack, chicken fried chicken and an onion ring tower at our table and each was unique and excellent in its own way.
The servers were friendly, fun and knew what they were doing. Sharp, crisp service and decor. The music was a tad loud, making it difficult to have a conversation, but with all the beers, let's be honest... our conversation would have been mostly gibberish and forgotten by the next morning anyway.
LOVE IT HERE! This is a MUST when in Vegas."}
{"text":"I'd have added a fifth star, but Yard House is a little pricey on their beers. $6.25 for a pint of Samuel Adams. But I can't blame them, the place is packed. It was packed every time we went by. Yard House is pretty awesome.  Great beer selection. The food was very good for a \"Bar\"."}
{"text":"Since I'm a cheap, broke college student I usually only come here for Happy Hour. They have a lot of options ranging from appetizers, to pizzas, to drinks. They have a wide selection of beers, so I try to get something new every time I dine. Service is nice and helpful. I recommend trying all the Happy Hour appetizers at least once. My favorites are the Calamari, Nachos(very large portion!), California Roll, & the Seared Ahi Sashimi."}
{"text":"Took the wife and kids. Started with calamari and deviled eggs. The tarter with the calamari was really good. That's were the we should have stopped. The deviled eggs were just weird. I had the bbq chicken pizza and my wife had jambalaya. The kids had Mac and cheese. The bbq sauce was too ketchupy for my taste and the chicken was dry. The sauce would have been better if it was sweeter. My wife and I both are from Louisiana and we both felt that the jambalaya was too rich. The kids macaroni was bland and under cooked. The wait staff was friendly but a little slow. We were expecting a nice restaurant unfortunately we found an expensive tourist attraction."}
{"text":"Service was impeccable! I took my mother here for Mothers Day and had some of the best service around. The cocktails were amazing! The waitress Kelsey was super nice and patient as my mom decided what she wanted from the huge selection of delicious-sounding appetizers and entrees. We weren't confident on how to order the steak wellness and when it came back more raw than we wanted, the waitress was so nice about getting the food cooked to perfection and the the manager Gerry even came over to apologize for the delay in our Mother's Day dinner. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a nice dinner or special occasion. Both Kelsey and Gerry's attention to making sure everything was perfect on a very busy day made our day. Ask for Kelsey!"}
{"text":"It's 5 o'clock somewhere, right?! On whim, I went to Yard House for Happy Hour -- and I'm glad I did! I totally forgot how amazing their food and beer is! (And... Not to mention, how reasonably priced everything is.)

I showed up and was asked where I preferred to sit, and immediately was on my way to be seated outside on a gorgeous day in Arizona! The waitress, Bri, came over and brought water, and got my drink order -- a watermelon margarita. I was so hungry, I barely even looked at the menu, but ended up ordering 2 vampire tacos (which OMG they were so delish! Although for some reason I was thinking they would be spicy... Nope! They had garlic on them... Kind of an oxymoron, but hey... they were finger-licking good, literally! And half-way through eating my first taco, I realized it was pork... and I don't eat pork, but I figured a little pork won't kill me, right?!), and also chicken lettuce wraps. 

The food was phenomenal, but more importantly... Bri was AMAZING!!! She was extremely friendly, quick with our food and drink order, and very sweet, and even came by for a minute to chat with us. She was genuine and funny, and you could tell she cared about the people she was waiting on; quite refreshing! Before happy hour was over, she asked us if we wanted another drink, and she recommended an amazing blueberry beer for me to get. I went with her recommendation and so glad I did -- it was so yummy, just like dessert! (But not too sweet). 

Yard House is one of our local hang out spots, and we will most definitely be back... Hopefully getting Bri as our waitress again. Yard House Management -- if you're reading this, give Bri a raise or a bonus or something! She made the experience amazing that night! Thanks!!! :)"}
{"text":"This is a truly a happening place, kinda loud. There's a outside patio to sit, drink and maybe even eat. The inside is somewhat dark and crowded, but the food is great. Faves are the chowder, lettuce wraps, salmon plate, thai salad and the creme breulee for dessert. It is a bit pricey after drink, appetizer and actual meal. But worth it if you want a good meal. Usually there is a wait, but they do provide you with a pager. (not child friendly really)."}
{"text":"Not much to say really, great food, service is always great, and the beer selection cannot be matched by anyone in town.  I leave this place with a grin on my face everytime."}
{"text":"Same food options you can find at any Yardhouse, the variety is pretty much the same at any location. We like the food at the Yardhouse so wasn't a problem from our perspective. The service at this location was extremely good, our waiter was great, really couldn't have done anything better."}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed Yard House yet?! It's been a while since I've eaten here (usually we just come for beer) so we decided to stop by yesterday for happy hour, which is Mon thru Fri 3 to 6 PM. Happy hour features half priced appetizers, $2 off glasses of wine, and $4-5 beer. Since I never know what kind of beer to get, I looked at the menu until something sounded good...Ok, I'll have a Spaten Oktoberfest...isn't this beer only seasonal though? 

We ordered some appetizers to share: onion ring tower, spicy tuna roll, bernaise sliders w/ fries, and chicken lettuce wraps. Our favorite were the lettuce wraps, where the chicken was perfectly cooked and the sauces provided went well with it, especially the sweet and sour that had a little kick to it. The onion rings were a little over cooked and brown/over crispy but were still ok, especially when dipped in ranch. The sliders are always delicious, topped with fried onion strings and 1 of my favorite items on their menu. I didn't have the spicy tuna roll since I don't eat fish so I can't comment on that dish.

Yard House is one of my favorite places to grab a drink or hang with friends, especially this one since it's located right in Town Square and near the movie theater, making it a good place to drink before catching a movie. They also have a large number of TVs, so it's a good place to catch a game although I'm never on this side of town on football Sundays...They also have plenty of patio seating which is perfect on those spring and summer nights"}
{"text":"Great food and the best beer! Everything on menu is good, some great, steak average. I eat everywhere and this is one of my favorites. Apps are fantastic."}
{"text":"Been here plenty of times and this time I will say wasn't as good as the rest.

Not sure what it was but there are a few things that come to mind.

The customer service was meh. Nothing special. 

The food portions looked smaller. The bottom of my daughters pizza was burnt in certain areas. 

Not sure if we will come back to yard house anymore. I think we'll start venturing out to other restaurants now."}
{"text":"My mom aunt and I were starving after searching for a formal gown at the mall on Saturday. Unfortunately we missed 3-5 Happy Hour at Ztejas. We tried Yard House (happy hour on Saturday is only reverse aka late night). 
My aunt wanted us to cheers with an alcoholic beverage for the successful shopping excursion. I left my wallet in the car and tried to order a drink from the server and she kindly apologized that she couldn't without my id (I'm 26 by the way). The manager stopped by and even offered to pay for my drink if I went to get my id she was incredibly sweet and professional about it. I respect their rule of id'ing anyone who looks under 35. 
Their chop salad is yummy! It doesn't come with romaine so our server was kind enough to let us know and give the option to add it. 
The Brussels sprouts appetizer is delicious. Sweet potato fries are just okay."}
{"text":"was looking forward to a chocolate frambois, but alas... they were out of frambois. kilkenny never lets me down. 

had the fish and chips. i dont remember if i had it before but when it came out it looked like fish sticks. im used to huge chunks of cod, but they had something different... i dont remember the name. other than the fish sticks presentation it was good. well i guess anything is good if you drench it in malt vinegar. 

dunno if it was me but it seemed extra dark in there today. last time i was here was when i was on a date. didnt really think about the lighting then, but more about my dates boobs...

sorry anthony m. i wasnt thinking about your boobs..."}
{"text":"I come here a couple times a month since I live in the area. Service has always been good until tonight, around 5:00 on a Wednesday. My server provided my family and I with the utmost disrespect. I asked her about an item on the menu and instead of explaining it to me she told me the item is on the menu and that I should read it. What kind is service is that? Extremely rude. Then to top it off, she slams our plates on the table and doesn't distribute them amongst us, as well as took our food from us early while we were sill eating. I'm going to tell all my friends and family to not eat here. awful service. 0/10."}
{"text":"Visited on a Monday around 1230, place was relatively empty. Quick, friendly service and nice atmosphere with plenty of TVs and a ton of beers on tap if that's your thing. The onion ring appetizer was off the charts. I had a bbq chicken salad with very moist chicken and a chipotle ranch dressing with light BBQ sauce. It was outstanding."}
{"text":"Great food and I love the beer! The yard is the only way to go! The burger is awesome and staff is real nice but I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Lots of beers on tap! Service and food good, prices average. This place is right at The Strip, so drop in here for a few before heading for the next place!"}
{"text":"I walked in and felt like a kid in a beer errr candy store. I have never seen so many beers on draft. I was salivating just looking at them all. I ordered the devil eggs as a \"snack\" and the crab cake sandwich for my meal. Everything was really tasty. I'll definitely be going back to try more of their extensive menu and try every beer they have on tap."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the Yard house. We always get the tower of onion rings and the tomato soup.  Super delicious!! They have great cherry coke and the food is worth the price. I'm sure once I'm old enough to drink I'll be going out here."}
{"text":"Really cool place for lunch,  dinner or a date! There is table, booth or bar seating, so depending on your mood you can have an intimate or fun social setting. I door and outdoor seating available.

The best part are all of the VEGAN options on the menu marked with a green  V. I love the spicy Edaname. There are HUGE portions so go hungry. 

As for the signiture cocktails, they have a great balance selection of sweet, bitter and just strong. The bar is best known for their huge assortment of on tap drafts, a specialty for them!

Service is really on point, and what makes me go back. I have never had a single issue in all the years I have gone here for various occasions. That consistancy is one of the best parts of this awesome local spot!"}
{"text":"It's all about the beer. Pyramid apricot ale is why we go to the yard house. The service is always consistent and the wait time moves quickly if you are willing to sit on the patio. Quest dip and coconut shrimp are good appetizers.  We go for the beer!"}
{"text":"I use to love this place! I have no idea what has happened but the quality of the food and the service has gone down. They hassle me about my service dog every time even though he is in his carrier doesn't bark and I sit outside. The last three times I went my food was either cold or over cooked. Three strikes your out for me I'll take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Family had the need for some real food away from the VEGAS strip. Place never fails, always consistent with service and quality of food!"}
{"text":"I think Yard House is going to be my new late-night snack spot. They have a reverse happy hour from 10pm-close from Sunday-Thursday. 

We tried the HH poke stack, lobster dip, and firecracker chicken wings. All items were delicious, and the ambiance on the patio outside is perfect for winding down after work. 

Will be back next week!"}
{"text":"Everything here is great. I'm in Vegas a bunch. TCB.. That's what goes on at the Yard house. Excellent employees & management"}
{"text":"This is mainly a review for dirt bag climbers who go to Red Rocks Canyon to get their winter trad rock climbing fix. I could really give a rat's ass about Las Vegas gambling and tourist culture. The rub of making a climbing trip to Las Vegas is, well, Las Vegas: a dearth of decent beer selections, overpriced food, the dreaded strip. I was explaining all of this to a local climbing out at Red Rocks, explaining apologetically that my girlfriend and I were from Portland, and thus we were insufferable beer snobs. This local fellow, a guy named Adam, told us to go to the Yard House, explaining that it had the largest draft selection on earth. I'm not sure if this is true, but they clearly have well over 100 taps, including a full section of their menu devoted to \"piny, citrusy, hoppy IPA\". Hello! Furthermore, it's right outside of Red Rocks on your drive back to Vegas.

At any rate, we stopped by after a day of climbing and discovered that happy hour is from 3 - 6 daily, and that their normally rather overpriced pints ($7+) were a more reasonable $5. Stone Ruination double IPA worked for me. More importantly, select appetizers are half off. I ordered Chicken Nachos for $6, expecting, well, and appetizer sized portion. What I recieved was a MASSIVE platter of nachos. Well more than I could eat by myself. My girldfriend ordered spinach cheese dip and chips, which was equally huge. We returned here daily for a few pints and shared an order of the chicken nachos--which was more than an ample meal for the two of us. Dinner for $3 a head? In Vegas (well okay, Sommerlin really)? Awesome.

Dirt bags, this is your cheap post climb dinner destination. It get's kind of packed for happy hour, but you really can't beat the beer selection and the prices. And while it is at a casino, it's not really 'in' a casino. There is outside access from the parking lot, so you can avoid the sea of chain smoking slot machine slaves."}
{"text":"Yardhouse is awesome for several reason! The main thing for me though is their menu, they have MANY choices for less than $10! Their portions are great, the service is great and their Blackberry Green Tea is sooo yummy! My favorite are the Chicken Lettuce Wraps and the Chicken Tortilla Soup is delish! I haven't had a beer or a cocktail here in a while but of course you know the selection of beer is gigantic."}
{"text":"This place is a staple for us at work, when the boss decides we should skip the EDR at lunch time. Always good service, and good food, and today was no exception. If it's one thing I've learned, it's to not eat heavily while at work...  The remaining hours of the day is miserable sitting at my desk, so I opted for a bit lighter fare. I tried the Kale Caesar salad, with chicken. I was not disappointed one bit. It had kale (of course) romaine lettuce, pistachios, golden raisins, parmesan cheese, and chicken. It was way better than I ever expected, and I finished every single bite."}
{"text":"This was a great restaurant with really good food. This location is located at the Westgate area. We sat on the patio with a great view of the area outside. Service was friendly. Food was creative and delicious. Just be prepared to spend a little more because it is a little more pricey than other restaurants of the same quality."}
{"text":"Okay, so we've been here twice now, and I feel I can write a fair review.  :)  The first time we went to the Yardhouse, we loved the assortment of draft beer first and foremost!  107 different draft beers?!?  What's this you say??  I was impressed!   I needed an extra ten minutes with the menu, just to make my beverage choice alone!  I went with the Honey Blonde house draft - it was...good.  I ordered the baby spinach salad...and for my second round of beer asked for a blend of the berry cider with an amber ale (I even suggested the house amber)...they brought me a \"black velvet\"...it was not what I was expecting.  Not the right color or taste...(I learned why on our round two trip - stay tuned).  My salad came...over dressed...I mean, if it were wearing clothes, it would have had a prom dress on.  Soggy.  I ate what I could, gulped down my okay brew, and we moved on to Margaritaville.
I know what you're thinking - how can I give 4 stars to a soggy salad and an okay brew?  Trip two!  This time, I looked at the beer menu again...I saw the \"Black Velvet\" it has pear cider in it (not for me, thanks!), then I saw the \"Rose Gaarden\" - Hoegaarden White &. Lindeman's Framboise....delicioso! er umm...köstlich (delicious in German)  ;)  Loved it!  Two BIG thumbs up!  Then...I steered clear of the salads, and ordered their BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger...I took my first bite (white bun, burger, bacon, cheddar, garlic aioli, rum bbq sauce) OH MY!  My boyfriend is looking at me, and I can't stop nodding whilst chewing!  He reaches out, I hand him the burger, he takes a bite, and starts NODDING!  Thumbs up, that's an AWESOME burger!  Well worth the sticky hands the BBQ sauce installs.  
Loved it, and we will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Why should you come here? Two words: Happy Hour! My wife and I had lunch here on of our few days off together. We had the following:

Kung Pao Calamari $11.75

1/2 grilled pastrami with side salad $9.95

1/2 roast turkey club wide side tomato soup $9.95

The calamari was great. I'm glad it comes with rice bc anything with a good sauce should come with rice :P The sandwiches were good. I wouldn't recommend the turkey club though bc it doesn't come with lettuce or tomato. Portion sizes are big so order family style to get your money's worth. Will definitely come back here for happy hour as prices are in the $5-$8 range.."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere. It's lively and fun. Food was delicious. Our server was awesome. Glad we tried it.  Party of three - we each ordered something different and two appetizers. We tasted everything at the table. Each meal was cooked perfectly and well beyond our expectations for flavor. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Nice late night happy hour.

I had a Margherita pizza and a beer for $11 during their happy hour.  They have an early one during normal times and another that starts at 10pm, Sunday through Thursday.  The pizza was excellent in both size and flavor.

I went back the next night as well and ordered their spicy tuna roll based on a customer recommendation from the previous night.  It too was outstanding.  Served with edamame, cucumber, and seaweed in the bottom layer, seared and raw tuna in the middle layer, and avocado on the top layer.  Sprinkled with some hot sauce, it was filling, light, and nutritious.  The price was around $12 though it is 1/2 price if you get it during happy hour!"}
{"text":"I love The Yard House. It's a sports/beer bar, but it's not tacky, or like some kind of man cave, in fact, the Yard House seems to be able to pull off a super chill, highly relaxed atmosphere that feels classy and fun. Lots of big TVs everywhere, any game you could want to watch, with a dimly light atmosphere. YH has more beers on tap than you could ever hope to drink in your visits there. 

Just like their sort of combination feel (nicer bar/restaurant- awesome sports bar) they've managed to do something similar with the menu. Normally, Im a fan of restaurants not trying to do too much, and sticking with a few things that they know how to do well, but this place apparently knows how to do it all well. We came during happy hour and had cheap drinks, and half priced appetizers, firecracker wings, onion rings, poke stack and crab cakes. All were absolutely fantastic. Especially the wings. 

Unlike most sports bars, this place has never been incredibly loud, the way most sports bars are. Great atmosphere, awesome food, attentive staff, badass place to watch a game."}
{"text":"If you are looking for consistently good food, chill atmosphere and great service I'd recommend Yard House. I've never had a bad dish or bad service. The menu has a good variety of dishes to choose from even vegetarian dishes. 

My most favorite dish here is the Chicken Enchilada Stack. It's amazingly good. It's Pinto Beans, Cheese, tender pieces of Chicken & Pasilla Peppers layered in between Corn tortillas & topped with a Red Chile & Tomatillo sauce and a dollop of Sour cream. It's seriously mouthwatering."}
{"text":"I've been to the Town Square location a couple times for happy hours and such, but never to the Strip location. I've always loved their selection of beer there, but never really had a great meal, so when my friend's and I went to check out the Linq this weekend, we decided to stop in.  We ordered a grilled artichoke, truffle fries, flatbread, egg rolls, and turkey burger sliders. The truffle fries were fabulous, and when they say shoestring fries, think baby shoelaces because that's how thin they are.  The turkey burger sliders were good, and the egg rolls never disappoint. The other two items however, yuck.  The grilled artichoke was not cooked long enough, so it was tough pulling leaves off. The flatbread was the dough itself, cheese, and some veggies. It was dry and tasteless...no sauce or anything on it. At least throw some garlic oil on it maybe? Our server called the manager over and he did handle the situation by taking the flatbread and artichoke off the bill.  Overall, I'd definitely come back here for their vast selection of beer, but sorry Yardhouse, your food has disappointed me one too many times."}
{"text":"Good place to spend time with friends on the weekends! Good food and good prices! Awesome services."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in Vegas, and I have been to a lot of places.  Food is sooooo good.  There is a reason why this place is always packed."}
{"text":"Great selection of beers and the menu is good with many choices to choose from. I would recommend the Fried Chicken breast served over spinach & corn mashed potatoes and bourbon gravy! Moist and tender with a nice crispy batter and flavorful gravy and mash"}
{"text":"A fun place to grab a brew and a burger, of that there is no doubt.  

The beer menu is worth the trip.  Whether you like a fruity blueberry brew or a manly dark, rich stout... this place has you covered.   The food on the other hand is nothing that tasty.

This place is TGI McFunster, with a better beer menu.  That's not really a complaint, just a note.  I love the beers!  I really do.  And there is nothing wrong with a big chain restaurant burger or chicken fingers.  Just don't come expecting more than that.

The menu is too big for any decent kitchen to put out.  Expect mass produced entrees with plenty of frozen and deep fried boredom.  I know what you are going to say.... they have a Vegetarian menu... they have exotic dishes.  Well  I am forever unimpressed with these special menus. Remember the ingredients here are falling off the same US Foods or Sysco truck as the burgers.  There is no brilliant young chef in the back struggling to express himself with his unique cuisine.  These are corporate recipes on menus meant to suck the dollars from your wallet.  In the end, they probably hope you drink enough beer to forget the food.  So don't kid yourself into believing that the ingredients are anything extraordinary.  

On the good side...  the food is not bad and the beer is noteworthy.  In proper combination this can result in a nice, fun dinner.  If that is your expectation... you are in luck.  I like this place, but I just don't see it as anything particularly unique or special.   Welcome America to yet another TGI McFunster Exotic Brew Garden and Neighberhood-like pub."}
{"text":"The Yard House measures up as a place for a decent lunch. Stopped in early Sunday afternoon with my wife for a light lunch and refreshments. My better half went with a glass of wine while I opted for a beer. If you like beer on tap the Yard House is a place for you, guessing about 100 beers on tap. The setting and vibe is typical new construction sports bar, exposed mechanicals and a far amount of TV, nothing bad but not memorable.

My wife went for on of the salads with added grilled shrimp while I went with the soup and 1/2 turkey club sandwich. Our waiter Duane was very helpful in describing the diffences in portion sizes of the salads and checking on how I wanted my lunch served, both items at the same time. Our meals were tasty, well portioned for the price and served up timely. 

I'm more than willing to go back to the Yard House again. Nice selection of apps, sandwiches and meals that should cover most cravings. Huge beer list of local, regional,  national and imports on tap. Size options from small glass to a yard of beer."}
{"text":"Yard house has the best burgers I've ever had in my life. I would come to the Glendale restaurant every time I'm out that way."}
{"text":"Visited Yard House Town Square, and was doubled billed. This was only brought to my attention, when my bank account was overdrawn. There remedy was, \"oh, were sorry\" and it will take several business days for the transaction to be reversed. I won't be returning and buyer  beware of your receipts and bank balances."}
{"text":"My son and I wanted to grab a quick light bite in the middle of our Christmas shopping at Desert Ridge.   The Yardhouse was bustling with shoppers with a similar plan.   We received prompt attention at the bar from a lovely server.   My half sandwich and half salad was perfect in taste and proportion.  My son had a colorful quinoa bowl.  I highly recommend The Yardhouse for a shopping break or a meal after the movies."}
{"text":"This place was so much fun! The atmosphere was great and loved being able to enjoy the weather."}
{"text":"Cool beers on tap. Great food.. Loud, weird patrons. Loud awful classic rock. Often the wait is long. Hard to park. It's in Town Square on the same side as Guitar Center. Despite the bad it's worth it. Just in case, be in a good mood when you go. Oh, and nice bathrooms."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. First off, it has an EXPANSIVE menu that includes pizza, burgers, steaks, salads, sandwiches, apps and much more. Everyone can definitely find something that they like. Secondly, they are reasonably priced. I usually judge by what a burger goes for... I think $10 is pretty fair and this place is close, around $12-$13. So, not bad. The staff is attentive without being annoying. I dined alone and was given my own space in a booth- which impressed me because as a frequent solo diner (I travel for work a lot) we are usually banished to the back corner or forced to the bar. The food came out quickly and I can honestly say this was The Best grilled cheese sandwich I have ever had. I wasn't rushed to finish even though I was taking up a table that could yield more money. I wasn't asked if i was waiting for someone else, I wasn't made to feel awkward eating alone. Positive experience and wonderful food. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Food has been pretty good for a while but getting progressively worse. Bbq sauce is too vinegary and runny. Ahi tuna sandwich was my favorite but the fish quality is very poor now. So fatty it reminded me of a doggy chew toy. 

Chilaquiles were pretty good. 

Tip: if you are in a rush, do not order appetizers. Coursing here takes a very long time."}
{"text":"First of all, the service here is fabulous. I visited this restaurant for a weekday lunch which was definitely a slow time for them, but they never acted like we were imposing. I even had a toddler with me, and I've found that in Vegas, kids are not always a good trait in a customer. They were super nice.

However, when I received my French dip sandwich, I was not pleased. The meat was so fatty that I couldn't even choke it down. There are few lunchtime quirks worse than fatty roast beef! It really ruined the sandwich for me, and it's been a while since I was there. I was so disappointed! I usually love this place. I was especially disappointed that they served it to me in the first place, as it was obviously lame meat, even without taking a bite. I stopped about 3 bites in. I'm usually the very last person to ever return food, but it really was nasty. 

I'm not sure I would chose to eat here again when there are many other restaurants nearby that seem to be more consistent. This location is normally slammed, so I wonder if going in when they were pretty dead was the problem. I might give it another chance sometime if I were to be invited by a friend or something, but never again will I come here for lunch."}
{"text":"love their turkey burgers. 

the service is friendly but slow. 

the prices are reasonable. i really don't have much else to add except to tell you to order a turkey burger. 

turk turk burg! get it!"}
{"text":"This is a step above the rest.  Honestly,  if I had a 6th star to give I would.  GREAT music.  I would say consistently the best music of any place I've ever been.  Very good food, friendly and fast service even when it was packed.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"First time doing delivery through their Grubhub service and the order was delivered wrong. Called over to The Yardhouse though and the manager, Jennifer, really went out of her way to make everything good again. Jennifer really salvaged what would have been a Father's Day Dinner disaster. Thanks so much."}
{"text":"First time at the Yard House. I was skeptical, a chain restaurant located in fake suburban downtown AKA known as Crocker Park. When we arrived, there was a 60-70 minute wait, & we were lucky to find two seats at the bar while we waited for our table. It was extremely busy, it was a Saturday night, but the place is so spacious, you didn't feel packed in like cattle. A bartender greeted us immediately & gave us beer menus. With over 100+ taps, the craft beer selection is solid. There's always some worry places with that broad of a selection don't rotate their handles, beer is old & skunked, etc. That was not the case. I had a Clown Shoes Space Cake which was super fresh. The wait was less than an hour, & once seated, our knowledgeable server was by right away. Have the deviled eggs! They were stunning with bacon & a sweet tomato chili sauce. The cheese curd, jerk wings, & coconut shrimp were also cooked to perfection. Our group enjoyed every last bite. For dinner I had the Southern Fried boneless chicken breast with creamed corn, bbq beans, spinach mashed potatoes, and bourbon gravy. One of of the best things I've ever eaten. Crispy chicken, the creamed corn was like crack. The mashed potatoes were creamy & decedent. My only complaint were the beans were slightly hard. For someone who had planned to be disappointed by another craft beer chain, Yard House was absolutely amazing. We willing definitely be back!"}
{"text":"A curious menu item under \"Street Tacos\" is the Vampire Taco: carnitas, chorizo, chipotle salsa, guacamole and cilantro wrapped in a cheese and seasoning encrusted corn tortilla.  I can't figure for the life of me why they call them \"vampire tacos\"; another ingredient is roasted garlic, and from my childhood education of vampires, I know they don't jive. In any event, they could have called them \"Ultra Space Supernova Mega-Spectacular Grand Finale Tacos\" and it would have the same result: AWESOME.

There is a nice patio section perfect for people watching and catching a breeze.  But perhaps the Yard House's biggest claim to fame is having over one hundred beers on tap.  A HUNDRED!  Move over 99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall, Yard House has got you covered with taps!

What could possible go awry with 100 beers on tap and blood sucking, reflection-less tacos?"}
{"text":"Been to this location about 5 times now and haven't had a bad experience yet. I'll definitely go a lot more after this review.

Every time I go I like to try something different and it's all been good so far.

The food is great. The location is great. The service is great. The beer selection is phenomenal."}
{"text":"I've gone to Yard House plenty of times (different locations), but this specific location I was not impressed by. I get the same thing almost every time I come, the orange chicken and when I received it this time, it was half the normal portion I always get. There were only 3 or 4 small little pieces of chicken on the plate and a scoop of rice. Where did the rest of my meal go, because I certainly didn't get it? They sat us out on the patio because that was the only seating they had available and it took forever to even get our waiter to come out to us. We were left with empty glasses constantly and food took quite a while to get.

Then after we left, we got to the car and my boyfriend realized that he had forgotten his sunglasses and hat on the table. He ran back to get them and every person that said that they would go check the table, ask our waiter if he saw them or get a manager for us, decided to go in the back and then go back to waiting on their tables. Nobody came to update us on if they had them or not for 15 minutes. Finally, he went back and started looking around himself until he found a manager. With all the staff that was standing around, someone could've helped him."}
{"text":"*****BEST HAPPY HOUR IN THE VALLEY******

Yes its a chain restaurant but who cares. YH has the best happy hour menu anywhere around, their appetizers are super affordable, you can tell me: \"but its $5+ an appetizer due\" and i will tell you \"their regular prices are $10-$12 dude\" they don't skimp on portions, you could have a full meal on their apps. Their sliders are pretty good, but about $8, not a problem for the price, 4 sliders and fries, enough for two. My Favorites: Spicy Tuna Roll(not your sushi cut rolls), and their barnaise sliders. 

Their drinks: its an infinite list, seems like never ending on how many drinks they have, they have so many beers that you will never finish trying them all. you try their limited seasonal and everytime you come you get the same because your in love with it. 

Staff: is super friendly and knowledgeable, tell them what you're in the mood for and they will recommend something for you.

Hint: you could try up to 3 small samples of beer at no charge!!!

*If you have kids dont worry you could bring them. YH is not a bar where people get out of control. *"}
{"text":"Came out with some friends for dinner.  If you go to any of the Yard House restaurants you're probably going to have the same experience.... it's loud but the food is good and beer selection is awesome.  

I had the turkey burger which was really really good.  You won't leave here hungry, that's for sure.  My only issue is with the beer prices.  Both of my friends ordered beer and it ended up costing more than the food!  Dinner for 3 = $80.  Considering I only had water and a $11 burger but ended up footing 1/3 the bill because it was so expensive.

Bottom line- I like the food but my wallet can't handle coming here on a regular basis."}
{"text":"We ate there twice already. The service and food were great! They are able to accommodate Plant Based / vegan options. We took kids for a late lunch, early dinner; and the kids food was equally wonderful. The kids were pleased to find out that all the kids meals came with dessert. We have never had a bad experience with food or service! Would recommend!"}
{"text":"This review is for 07/16/2011. After leaving the Well, I had to eat up before the Arizona Diamondbacks vs Los Angeles Dodgers game at Chase Field. On my previous visit to Scottsdale, I drove by the Fashion Square Mall a couple times, but I never got to visit. With the help of Yelp, I found the Yard House.

I arrived around 12:30 to a nice part of the Fashion Square Mall. I don't know the exact location of the Yard House, but I know its around the valet service that the mall provides. The location where the Yard House felt like I was in Las Vegas, but it seemed that way. This Yard House vibe was excellent. 

I walked in and sat at the bar since I was alone. I was greeted by Steve and ordered a Cape Cod ($8.75 each) right of the bat. Yeah, I love my Cape Cods. Steve used Ketel One Vodka ($8.25) with Cranberry ($0.50). I can't believe they had to break the price down on my receipt. I was very hungry and I got ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken ($16.95). 

The wait for the food was about ten minutes. It is my second time to ever be at Yard House and I am still surprised to see so many drinks served on tap, but a lot of the drinks were sold out and had to be served by can. I finished my Cape Cod and ordered another one. Too much for one day?

My food came and I, immediately, smelled the mushrooms. No, not that those mushrooms. The chicken was very crusty, but the sauce definitely complimented the crusted chicken like it was butta. Awesomely delicious. Steve had to take a break and I had a female bartender. We stroke a small conversation and Steve came back. Sorry about that....I was starting to have fun with the talk. My total came out to be $37.54.

I had to go in and out fast to get ready to get to Chase Field, but with my stressful morning and celebrating at a dive bar to eating at a restaurant, half of my day came out to be just a perfect morning. Glad that this place was next to my hotel, but like an Angeleno, I drove instead of walk."}
{"text":"My favorite bar and top 5 on my restaurant list so far, came here for my 21st! My brother had worked there and said everything on the menu is good. Now i come every excuse i get.
Start it off with Truffle fries, with all the unique sauces you can get. Fresh, nice texture, they dont forget to clean the oil. Don't let anyone try your fries or you'll be swatting hands away all night  Sadly they no longer have maple bacon sauce which went good with everything.
Ive tried burgers, salads, but mostly chicken. The southwestern chicken sandwich (or maybe its Cajun chicken sandwich?) Is to die for. I haven't tried anything i didn't like or love. If you haven't been here, come here with a friend. Its not the perfect dating atmosphere unless you don't mind having to speak loudly. 


The beer gets it's own section. 
I check out the brew menu every time.  The outside of the brewery is decorated with the barrels and hoses coming out, tons of barrels. First time you see it its a nice aesthetic.
Tons of options.. So far \"Deschutes Fresh squeezed\" is nice for citrusy hop kick. If youre a hop head its a no brainer to get a double indian pale ale (DIPA.) I like \"squatters double IPA\" high on the ABV, and around a 70 on IBU's. Its about 8%.
For first time craft beer consumers, ABV= Alcohol by Volume % IBU= International Bitterness Unit. Higher the IBU the more hops usually. 
The bartenders and even waitress/waitors are usually knowledgeable about the beer/wine/spirits. 
I took it more mild after 2 mugs of Deschutes and 1 of DIPA, so i ordered a \"not your father's root beer\" except for the last sips, tastes just like root beer, but the alcohol becomes more present the further you drink, all was very pleasant. You get your drinks very fast always even when it's packed. 

I got crazy with the beer, sorry.. not sorry.
I highly reccomend this place to anyone, the atmosphere is loud and usually packed only bad thing i can say about Yard House. So far I have been to 2 locations and they're both nice. Tv's everywhere like you'd expect for a bar. Don't look at them, try taking in the experience. You wont forget it likely. 15 minute wait most of the time, worth the wait. Prices are reasonable. 
Eat, drink, be marry, drink, and enjoy Yard House."}
{"text":"Just had a great lunch with brother. Appetizer: Sweet potato fries...and some delicious creamed maple bacon dip. While we waited for our food the table enjoyed Martinis and enjoyed the crowded atmosphere of the West Gate Center. It seems a hockey game had ended or was about to begin so a flood of people came in out of the heat for some nice beers. They have a great selection of beer and martinis. I would check the online menu and make sure that you try something new. After a while our table was giggling and ready to eat. This place gets 4 stars just for the drinks. The girls had the lunch special of personal pizzas with salad or soup while the guys ordered the Grilled Korean BBQ Beef with large salads. Everyone seemed to LOVE their food. I wasn't as impressed with my Marghetita pizza but LOVED the Organic Tomato Bisque so the food gets maybe 3 stars."}
{"text":"I think Yard House is slightly overpriced, but still good nonetheless. 

I stop by this Yard House with my girlfriend periodically, usually on days where there isn't a Coyotes or Cardinals game going on. The outdoor wrap-around patio seating is nice, you can get a good view of everything going on. So we normally sit out there. 

Overall, their service is fine. I wouldn't call it excellent by any means. But it is good enough. We like to take our time normally and enjoy a drink or two before ordering. Some servers get annoyed at that, but most of the time it isn't a problem. 

The food at this Yard House is the strong point. We really enjoyed our last couple of meals there and that's pretty much why we come back. The ambiance is a little bit lacking at this location -it is louder than others I've been to, but the outdoor area is a little bit better. 

I think we may come back at some point. It's kind of an \"ol' reliable\"-type of restaurant. You know what you're getting in terms of service and food, so you can sit comfortably and watch the game or people watch from the patio area and relax. 

To me, this Yard House is worth of a 3.5-star review. Since I can't give that, I'll go with 3-stars."}
{"text":"Lamb Burger. The feta cream cheese is great then paired with that jalapeño shallot relish....oh man soo good."}
{"text":"Great Beer Selection and Spicy Tuna Roll!"}
{"text":"Yard house is pretty awesome especially when your there with awesome company.  I've been here a bunch of times and always have a blast.  If you're here you're going to be most likely getting one of those long glasses filled with beer, I always thought they were yard long glasses, hence the name Yard House, but I think they're half yards now. They have a great selection of domestic, imports, and craft beers.  They also have a special selection of beer which they'll serve until they run out.  I'd recommend trying those first if they sound good to you.

Happy Hours:
Monday - Friday 3pm - 6pm, half off those drinks, apps, and pizzas, there's also specials on some drinks.
Sunday - Wednesday 10pm - Close, same as M-F except no half off those long drinks.

If you can try to get a sit outside because inside is usually pretty loud and you might get your drinks faster, the bar is usually crowded.  It's also easier to get a party of about 20 seated together.  I think we had about that many last time, some passing out, everyone a drunken mess, good times. They have heaters during the winter and when it gets warmer nice place to have a beer away from the A/C.

Their food is actually pretty good better that what you'd expect from a place that serves mass amounts of alcohol.  They have everything from burgers to seafood to pizza, pasta, ribs, desserts...

Service is usually most of the time, haven't had a problem yet except for the time I asked for a yard a crown and they said no jk.  I'd say the only problem about this place is that when it's crowded, every time I've been there, it gets difficult getting a beer at the bar. Overall I'd always go back."}
{"text":"Yard House I love you!  This is definitely one of my favorite spots.  Always filled with people... varying from families, business get togethers, 20-something friends drinking.  Love it.  So versatile in your usage with this place.  I've done birthdays, dinner with my parents, happy hour with my friends... all here.  

The food is always yum.  Love the fries, love the burgers, love the steak, love the salmon.  Okay there was one thing I wasn't fond of... I got wasabi mashed potatoes one time.  Weird. But I don't like wasabi anyway... had to try it still!  Now I know.

The service is always phenomenal.  Look, I don't like beer, but there is some raspberry beer that doesn't taste like beer... and it's goooood.  

I've always had a good time here.  I love the vibe of this place.  They play good music.  It's never dead.  I just, love it."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I was given a gift card by the YH management and used it for my meal this evening. It was not presented until the check came, so it was not a factor with regard to the service we received.

My previous review gave YH 4 stars, with the only problem being slow service, especially when it came to getting the check. 

Tonight, it seems as though my input was taken seriously; all the issues are no longer issues! The meal was very well timed, with the drinks, appetizer and main courses arriving as we needed them. We got the check at the same time our dinner plates were bussed, so we were able to pay it and then relax for a few minutes before leaving (my biggest complaint before was that we were often held hostage for a while after the meal because of the check not being presented quickly). All in all, great service!

As per usual, my seared ahi sandwich was AMAZING. The kitchen gods smiled upon me today and I ended up with TWO tuna steaks in my sandwich, instead of the usual one. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Pop quiz: how sad is it that eating at this Yard House was one of my most anticipated moments before getting on the plane and heading out to Las Vegas for a few days? Gambling, glitz, girls and other words that start with \"G\" are all fine and dandy, but sometimes a guy just wants to down a few beers, chomp on some outstanding food and unwind in a place where not everyone is a raging tourist carrying an over-sized plastic drink that is watered down and reeks of desperation. This is that place.

My folks and I actually made it over here before they opened on a Monday morning and people were already lined up at 10:50 a.m. That's cool, right? This place clearly has a faithful audience, as evidenced by this review. And once those doors opened, shoot: it's like the customers in line thought the first 10 people in the door got a free unicorn that performs karaoke exclusively to hair metal songs. They rushed the door with a fervent desire to be first in and we just sort of meandered in after them. It's a big place with plenty of seats - there's no point in scrambling over each other to be the first one in. There's a lengthy patio, a surrounded bar and more seating than the average bar would know what to do with.

A hostess guided us to a booth opposite a table of nine individuals who exemplified the \"money cannot buy class\" rule. We overheard them tell the waitress they had to be out of there to catch a movie so right away you could tell this had potential to be the table from Hell. We already felt for this gal and then we realized she was waiting on us, too! Let it be known that Tasha, our waitress, got the MVP award for eternity during this shift because when the place opened, it appeared she got triple sat right out of the gate. Now I'm not an expert in the service industry but I know how hard it is to recover from a hand dealt like that in the opening minutes. We assured her we were in no rush, mostly because we weren't, and partly because we did not want to witness a breakdown on the floor. To her credit, she kept her cool and was efficient as she was sassy.

Speaking of keeping cool, you might want to psych yourself up before eating here because the menu is positively Dickensian with its verbiage. Six pages of beer alone?! No, you have not died and gone to Heaven; you just happened to wander into a place thriving with variety. Being that we stopped in for lunch, we stuck with sandwiches and the must-have lunch combo: a cup of soup and half a sandwich/pizza. Mom's chicken avocado sandwich was polished off with ease, Dad's... whatever Dad ate, was equally delicious, and my tortilla soup and pepperoni pizza were wolfed down in a shameful display almost as noticeable as my preference for hopping around the beer menu: Big Sky Moose Drool can totally give way to Kronenbourg 1664 if you try.

And through it all Tasha managed the suffocating requests of her demanding table, a performance that would go unnoticed if you were not paying attention given that everyone working here is a study in quick service and attentiveness. Food runners actually running food? Hostesses navigating the dining room with purpose? Bartenders keeping their orders flowing? You'd better believe it. We did not see a manager but I am assuming one was on duty, probably sitting in the rafters like Batman/woman, waiting to pounce when the need makes itself known.

There was one last bit of unfinished business: dessert. I'll just say this now: order the s'more brownie item. It will change your life. As the owner and operator of a beard and mustache, it almost made me consider shaving them off due to me realizing hot marshmallow embedded into my hair is not the most glamorous feeling. But wow if that was not the best way to go into a sugar coma that I have had the pleasure of eating in quite a while.

Yes, Yard House is a chain and yes, you know what you're getting by eating at one. But this one in particular has service and set up down to an art form. More TVs than you could ever watch? Extensive seating? A prime location away from most of the touristy things? Absolutely. And believe the hype, too - until the owners build one of these in Dallas, TX (hint, hint), it will remain a \"must-go\" destination for any upcoming Las Vegas trips. Who am I kidding? Even after they build one in Dallas, TX (nudge, nudge), I'll still be stopping here."}
{"text":"I enjoy going to the yard house at the red rock or town square. They have a great selection of craft beer and a big menu with food for everyone. It's not a bad place to bring yer kids and still be able to catch a game. I generally go here for lunch but they are good for both lunch and dinner I like their turkey burger. This weekend I went out of my comfort zone and got myself some comfort food ; ) Grilled Cheese (which was Deeeelicious)
Along with some tomato bisque. 
We also ordered the poke nachos & the tortilla soup."}
{"text":"Happy hour for drinks is pretty solid but skip this place if you're looking for good food at a good price.  My husband and I we're both very disappointed in the food."}
{"text":"I only go to YARDHOUSE for happy hour... and that's because I believe they have the best menu (including price, options & booze) in Vegas for happy hour! I love going here with a friend or even a big group! They have over 30 different types of beer on tab and an array of wines and other liquor. They are known for there yard sized drinks of your choice in a fun and hip glass! The ambiance is very relaxing and chill. Service is great and the bartenders are funny, too! Okay.. onto to the food that I've tried!

Happy hour food:
Hawaiian Poke Stack- Ahi tuna on top of friend wonton chips with avocado, ginger, carrots and their sauce.. amazing! must try! one of my favorite items on the HH menu.

Fried calamari- I love calamari.. I love drizzling lemon juice on top and dipping it in the sauces. It tastes like every other fried calamari.. nothing special but still so good.

Kung Pao calamari- came with rice on the side, Kung Pao sauce with the calamari and it was mixed with red bell peppers, carrots, and caramized walnuts. Very different, a little spicy, but very tasty!

Bernaise sliders- you have an option to upgrade fries for a dollar! I upgraded my fries for truffle fries and they were amazing (I'm a sucker for truffle fries)! The sliders tasted like regular sliders.. nothing too special. I will definitely try other stuff next time!

Chicken lettuce wraps- came with four different type of sauces and the chicken came inside a taco-shell like bowl. I love making wraps, but it was okay. The chicken was okay. Is it me or they never give enough lettuce? Hehehe

Drinks- Great selection for a cheap price!

Overall, this place is fun for happy hour food, drinks and fun with friends! I wish the Linq had happy hour menu!"}
{"text":"A-OK is pretty spot on here. We stopped in for the happy hour before a concert at the Gila River Arena. Happy Hours prices are solid and there is a great beer menu. We were lucky to snag bar seats and the staff did pretty well keeping up with the crowd (even though they seemed to surprised to be so busy for a Monday - I guess they don't scope out the show schedules). We ordered some food and even though our order was incorrect when delivered, they fixed it pretty quickly. Big menu of bar classics and some things you wouldn't expect. Boneless wings and cheese curds were decent, but not memorable. Overall, a good stop before a show and definitely worthwhile for some HH beers and snacks. More like a 3.5 if I could!"}
{"text":"We have been here probably close to a dozen times and it is always great. The service is top notch, so friendly and attentive. Steph was our server on our last visit and she was incredible. Great location for people watching and awesome food."}
{"text":"It's a Yardhouse! I love Yardhouse and this one is no different. Went there on a Sunday afternoon, there was no wait and plenty of patio seating. Our waiter, Paul, was very accommodating for our large party of 10 (including 3 young kids!). Would recommend to anyone staying in the nearby hotels."}
{"text":"The Yard House has it all- great service-  amazing drinks (we had the old fashion and bourbon lemonade) and terrific food!
We shared the Brussels sprouts (so crispy and amazing)- fried chicken was tender- and the chopped salad!
We loved it and it was super affordable!! We shared all of the above and couldn't finish it all!  You will not be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Friday night is really busy and noisy.  Hard to have a conversation.  Ordered the scallops and they were not really seared but maybe broiled?  Very overdone and the cilantro some thing was like poi and did not accent the scallops at all.  I had the Caesar salad with and that was pretty good.  Price was 16.00 so it was fair.  Daughter had the sea bass and she loved it.  Husband had lobster pasta and said it was good."}
{"text":"Ok, maybe I turning into a full-fledged \"Yelper\" by writing reviews of every where I get to eat...

I went to this place before the Fiesta Bowl.  Holy Cow!  Did, this place end up with a great location.  It is not the only bar within walking distance of the University of Phoenix Stadium, but it is the definitely the best.  The place is HUGE, with lots of BIG tables for parties of 6 or more.  We had a group of 10 GUYS and we all fit in a booth.

Their specialty is beer - lots of beers on tap, but they were out of several domestics due to the Fiesta Bowl crowd.

Service was good and the food was better than your average bar food."}
{"text":"I am a fan of the Yard House in general, but I have to say this is my favorite location.  Beer selection is just remarkable at all locations, and food is good, consistent, and has an interesting flair.  I particularly like their mac and cheese (although my waistline does not like it) and the Ahi Tuna dishes.  Cheers."}
{"text":"We went to the yard house last night for our 38th wedding anniversary. We have been here many times and have always had great food and great service. Last night our server was Chelsea, who was the greatest. She was prompt and attentive and brought us a cute dessert after we finished our dinner as an extra surprise. 
If you haven't visited this place yet, go for happy hour and order the new poke nachos. They were so good!!
Thanks to Chelsea and the yardhouse staff for making our night special."}
{"text":"Poor poor poor service. Went for a birthday party with 20 people. They refused to break up checks. Myself and one other left because we were ignored and after saying excuse me ma'am and excuse me still ignored. So I do not recommend this place. They were rude and ignorant. Can't recommend beers can't add"}
{"text":"I have a lot to complain about, but won't waste our time.. Here's the highlights. 

- We did call ahead seating and were told the current wait was 15 minutes. We should be seated right when we arrive. 
- Waited 30 minutes after arriving to be seated.
- Seated in a corner in a side room. Noise level so loud that no one could hear each other, even when yelling.
- Waited 15 minutes for server to take drink order
- Waited another 10 minutes for drinks
- Waited another 10 minutes for someone to take food order (had to flag down some other server to take our order)
- Waited about 40 minutes for dinner 
- Tacos (soft shell) came out looking like someone ate half of two of them. Shells were torn in half. Not even full tacos. Flagged server down and we were told the manager would be right over. 
- Server returned 3 times over the next 20 minutes as we wait for manager, apologized for delay. At some point, I asked if they were remaking the tacos. No, they were not. 
- By the time the manager came over, everyone was done eating, except for the poor person that ordered tacos and did not eat. The people who did eat did not enjoy the food. It was very poor quality.
- Manager pretty much blamed everything on the kitchen and said he was working in the kitchen trying to catch up. That's what took so long. 
- We were not charged for our meal. After we left, we had to go somewhere else to grab food for the person that didn't eat the tacos.
- We were there hours and during that time, we couldn't even make use of the time catching up because no one could hear each other. Train wreck from the moment we walked in the door. I won't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Yard House is a great spot for Dinner with Friends. Prices are average depending on what your in the mood for. But the best is the Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"The website is misleading and makes this place seem way more vegan friendly than it is. It's extremely vegetarian friendly, meh at vegan. With that being said, our server Ryan was SUPER knowledgeable about the entire menu and informed me of what was and was not vegan friendly. I very much appreciated his honesty and knowledge of vegan principals."}
{"text":"Long wait but it's understandable cuz it's a cool place to hang out. Their sliders & happy hour specials are the best!"}
{"text":"Been coming to this location for a few years.  Extensive beer selection as well as other drinks. The sour apple martini is one of my favorite.  Food selection is American but there other food  influences found such as their take on the jerk chicken.  Food service can vary this is a very busy place.  I personally have never had a bad waiter or waitress they have been attentive, friendly besides taking a while to serve food. My only real complaint about them is that the noise level is insane.  You are basically shouting at the person next to you to have a conversation because of the noise level."}
{"text":"Food is always good quality. Not the greatest of the great food wise but you know you are getting good quality.  Its also a great place to go when no one can decide on what they want.  Varieties ranging from pizza to Japanese! 
Being from out of town it was fun and exciting to try local Arizona beers and ales. Had great service from Brian."}
{"text":"I've been to this location numerous times. Normally the food is above average and the patronage fine. Last night the pizza was not very good, and the staff is apparently okay with loud cursing so all can hear. Instead of apologizing when I left, they should have done something about it while it was happening. Disappointed. The millennial crowd needs to pay attention to their audience. They weren't helping their image."}
{"text":"Visited the YardHouse at Red Rock Casino over the weekend.  It was pretty late, well after midnight, and we obviously got right in and sat down.  Wasn't too crowded.   Wait staff was accommodating and friendly.

I had the chicken lettuce wraps.  My girlfriend had the asian pork bbq appetizer.  Both were pretty good.  The beer is good and they do have quite the collection from which to choose.

We like to go there roughly once a month and that won't change after our latest visit.  Definitely a pleasant atmosphere and good place to get some food whether it's early or late.

4 stars!"}
{"text":"3 STRIKES and YOUR OUT ! 3 TIMES WE HAVE TRIED TO GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO REDEEM THEMSELVES AND THREE TIMES THEY HAVE PROVEN US WRONG! 

Dont cook food properly. Well done burger came out barely cooked on more than one occassion! $6.50 regular size draft beers. Long waits for food. The manager did comp the entire bill but we will NOT ever return. This was their last chance at redemption and they totally blew it we will not return."}
{"text":"I'm on a special diet that requires my food to be cooked without butter/oils and no sugars and the chef here spoke to me personally and delivered up this awesome goodness in he correct portion size as well!!! Love the staff here!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! I come here every year for my birthday and it is amazing! Great food, great crowd, and there is always something going on. I love the social environment, relaxed feel, but great dining experience."}
{"text":"I am a huge yard house fan...I was worried the new location in The Linq would jack the prices up...but nope.  The second floor patio will be a great hangout this summer.  Server Brandon is was fantastic and we NEVEr felt neglected even thought they were busy,

I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Love the food here and our server was Shelby so sweet and knowledgeable and beautiful.  All of the staff were friendly and helpful!  Really like this location and I will come back for the food and hard working kind people!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for beer.  The tap selection is unthinkable.  I like to try a different beer each visit to expand my knowledge.  The staff is also great and the food is good."}
{"text":"Julie K. and I came her after the Yelp Pamper Party for some more giiiiiiiiiiirl talk. 
We got a booth in the back and ordered Tomato soup and Crab dip and an Angry Orchard! 
The crab dip was AIIGHT. Definitely crabby tasting but not as creamy as I like. And when I got it, I was like, Oooh, tortilla chips - tortilla chips are not my favorite item to DIP... SOOO I'm snacking away and then I opened my eyes A LITTLE WIDER and I spotted: PITA BREAD. WTF., LOL. SO BLIND. The pita bread made me happy. SO keep your eyes open, there are tortilla chips AND pita bread to scoop your dip. NOM. LOL."}
{"text":"My friend and I went there around 6-7pm, it's a really busy location, Be prepare to wait.

Beer: 
they have house brew beers, just tell your waiter about you preference, you will get some good suggestions.

Food: 
Guacamole and chips: taste super good, guacamole taste so fresh, I cleaned up the bowl with my chip.

Spinach and cheese dip: the cheese is real deal, great amount of cheese that can give you extra cheesy taste. The homemade chips are amazing!!! Extra thick type of chips.

Kale Caesars with steak: amazing dish, I chose median for the steak, they cooked it perfectly. It contained different texture cause they added some nuts and dry fruits.

Service & environment: the servers were really nice and polite, my friend had allergic to coconut, they gave her lots of carrots and celery to ate with spinach and cheese. 

The prices were little bit high but reasonable, the services and food they provided definitely worth the price!"}
{"text":"This particular review is years in the making. I've enjoyed this establishment's offerings many times and will probably continue to do so for a long time. 

I don't like to proclaim myself a beer connoisseur for two reasons: I don't know THAT much about beer and I dont particularly like the term or label. With that being said, this is a great spot for a fan of beer, such as myself. Whether you like all types of beers or not, its pleasant to have the option just incase your preferences change over time (as most of ours do). 

The menu is fantastic. I only order \"vegan\" as of late but I've never had a bad meal. The \"rotating\" draft beer board keeps the extensive beer menu fresh for those who are regular visitors. Out of the twenty or so times if been here, I've only recieved bad service once."}
{"text":"Went here on saturday lunch time around 1pm, it was pretty busy, waited 15 minutes just to order a drink, took another 15 min to get the drink and then waited on food for almost another hour.  The food is definitely overpriced for the taste."}
{"text":"The food was okay... Steak was cooked as ordered... Salad was good but had house fried potato chips, which sort of killed it for me... Salad dressing was ok... Prices were reasonable considering  the location.... Don't know if I'll return tho... Never been impressed by this type of place..."}
{"text":"Yard House, the yin to my wallet's yang. Beer selection: awesome. Beer and food prices: high.

I'm a huge fan of draft beer. While some like to play with Belgian lambics, I'm still in the hoppy stages of youth swimming in IPAs and west coast bitters. They have around 10 different IPAs to choose from, and their beer menu awesomeness is well-documented in other reviews. For all the shortcomings, the number of high-quality beers and tasty food has my review eternally pegged at five stars.

So let's talk about what I don't like. Prices. I know I've said it twice but it is the only reason we don't visit more often. We once had an appetizer come out unforgiveably dirty. But it didn't bother us because once we told our waiter no less than two servers and a manager came to apologize. If they make a mistake, they more than compensate and obviously care a great deal about customer service.

Here are some of the other things I like. The turkey burger is to die for. We've ordered it twice and will probably order it every second or third time we visit. The fries are tasty, crispy, and wonderful but because they are thin the temp drops quickly. We try to eat the fries before the burger, but it's difficult because the burger is just so darn tasty.

My wife isn't crazy about the pizzas. I would order them again although I will never say it is the best pizza I've ever tried. I think we've only tried cheese, pepperoni, and bbq.

But the turkey pot pie? The mac and cheese (with chicken and bacon, their top seller)? The Maui chicken? The Avocado Swiss burger? Yeah, those are the best I've ever had. Here are some more details: pot pie is huge, covered with the tastiest, flakiest, croissant crust imaginable. The mac and cheese is legendary, a must try. The Avocado Swiss burger was juicy, had half of an avocado, and the creamiest of swiss cheeses. What I liked about the Maui chicken was that it was prepared, not thrown together. The vegetables were really cooked in a delicious sauce, and instead of drowning in sauce they were imbibed with it. Just perfection.

Obviously we will be going again. Love it. Can't get enough."}
{"text":"This location is always busy so expect a short wait. Ive been here whens its a packed house and also when it was just busy. Everytime I come they have given great service. The beers are great and the atmosphere is fun. Only complaint is the food isnt as good as the beers but u cant have everything. I enjoy stopping in and catching a game and sampling a new beer. Great place"}
{"text":"I had lunch here for the first time and what a pleasant surprise!  The service was very friendly, attentive, and helpful.  My friend and I had the lunch special which included 1/2 a sandwhich and soup.  It was terrific and the bill with iced tea came to less than $20 each!  A great deal in a very nicely appointed, modern restaurant.  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I was very pleasantly surprised.  We were seated right away (on a Friday night around 7pm) in a booth inside.  I normally always opt for outside seating in restaurants but even I needed a temporary break from the 100+ degree heat.  The waiter was very good - checking back frequently on everything and keeping our drinks full.  I loved the Enchilada Stack - who knew a beer restaurant could serve a great mexican style meal.  It had tons of lean white meat chicken, lots of cheese and yummy green and red enchilada sauce.  I finished the whole thing which I never do!  My husband enjoyed his steak as well."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the rave is about.
We tried quite a few menu items. 
Poke nachos were the best.
Spicy tuna roll was the worst
Fried mac n cheese was different but OK
Fried cheese curds were OK
Seared ahi sandwich was overdone
Chicken and waffles was healthier sweet potato pancakes was OK.
I forget the steak over mashed potatos name but it was overcooked too

Service was very good. Waitress was there to explain everything and very nice"}
{"text":"Loved this bar! Wish we had one in Oklahoma. Try the ahi!"}
{"text":"I live and work very close to this Yard House, so it turns into the go-to place for lunch, last minute dinner, or just want a drink. 
My two favorite dishes are:
- Classic Cheese Burger, protein style with sweet potato fires
- Chicken Enchilada Stack
The best part about Yard House is the huge selection of beers. They have something for everyone!"}
{"text":"Came in tonight with a larger party and they were super quick to seat us :) Josh was our server and so friendly, knowledgeable, and charismatic. We were celebrating a few things as well and a manager came over and said our appetizer and dessert was on them! Everyone who served us tonight went above and beyond, especially Josh!!!"}
{"text":"So, I was initially here to go the Blue Martini.  The crowd was nice.  We were able to get a nice big table for only the 2 of us.  We decided to get the nachos to share.  Looked good, HUGE!  I was disliked the nachos, the chicken looked as if they boiled it.  It had no flavor, no color.  Yeah, I have had way better nachos then this!  The waiter was great, but it wasn't his problem."}
{"text":"Alec was incredible!  It was our anniversary and he gave us the best service I've ever had at a restaurant!  I used to serve at a 5 star restaurant and this was that level of service!  My gf and I would def come back just for him :)"}
{"text":"Only dinging it a star because the service is just never great. 
But the food! Amazing! I highly recommend their miso bass! A bit pricey but worth a treat! So sad they don't have regular cheesecake or strawberry cheesecake or NY style cheesecake or strawberry shortcake.... Dessert menu is disappointing. Blah. 
But the beer is always cold and good, the food is always yummy and fast! 
Love their lettuce wraps and their poke bowl! Oh man I can go on and on about their food. Oh so yummy:)"}
{"text":"Yard house is like the new Cheesecake Factory to me...large portions of slightly altered yummy food with great drink choices...slightly more expensive than necessary, but worth it all.

I have always loved the idea of this place...as I am a huge fan of choices...and even though I am not a beer drinker, I am easy to satisfy with beer here.

We visited the Red Rock version Saturday and had a great time.  There was a 30 minute wait for a table for 6, but we were there for probably 2 hours and not rushed off at all once sat.  

I drank the super yummy Lindeman's Framboise Lambic, a Pear cider and their Michelob Ultra...all of which were fresh and perfectly cold.

I tasted/shared:

Lobster, Crab, Artichoke Dip...in which luckily no one noticed I did not let get out of my reach...yummmmmm!

Their spinach dip was also good, but again, I was focused on the other dip.

Basic blue cheese wedge salad...I have had better, but it did the job of getting a vegetable in my system...

Lobster garlic noodles...tasty, especially the spinach and mushrooms, but prefer udon noodles (this was wheat spaghetti)

(Mac + Cheese)2 which was highly recommended...I could taste all the   ingredients including the truffle oil, mushrooms and huge chunks of bacon.  This is surely a meal for the girl attempting to earn some curves, if you know what I mean...so I didn't enjoy all of it, not even half, but the con-dieter in me says YIPPEE for finding this delicious version of a fan fav.  

Prices are not necessarily a deal...but nothing sucked enough to be upset about it.  I am glad there is one close to my house now and will be back soon."}
{"text":"My family of 4 + a uncle, niece, niece boy friend + 6 more all ate here on a Sunday night around 7 pm.  We did have reservations and things were great.  All dinners were awesome as always.   I ordered my usual- fish and chips.   Not the best and not the worse but always consistent.   

Another thing I usual get is the turkey pot pie.  OMG- it's so good. If it's cold out and you need something good - get the turkey pot pie.  

Great service.  Great fun"}
{"text":"Come here quite often and I love this place. They really take pride in their customer service. Excellent. Their food is also delicious when I go I usually get the southern fried chicken. And let me tell you OH MY GOD! So delicious I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. Also they have a great happy hour. They have these vegan boneless wings called Gardein wings. Now I'm am the furthest from vegan but they are a healthier option and I promise you you can not taste the difference between this and chicken. They are soooo good."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came to eat here for a celebratory occasion however, I wish we hadn't. 

I ordered the small chicken Cobb salad and accidentally forgot to ask them to remove the bleu cheese. Our server Mike was fantastic, he had no problem taking the salad back to the kitchen to remove the cheese. When Mike returned with my salad it looked great, but as I started mixing the salad ingredients together I noticed the hard boiled eggs were grey and the tomatoes the cook served me were all spoiled. I understand that because of my mistake they had to remake my salad all over again but, the cooks should not be allowed to even serve rotten or spoiled food to their customers (especially because the food is being paid for). At this point I had lost my appetite so I asked for the manager, Debbie. I thought the manager was suppose to help solve the issue not treat you like you're ignorant. Debbie said \"that's the color tomatoes are suppose to look like\" implying that I was being scandalous for no reason. I grabbed the fork and tossed the tomatoes over so she could see that the tomatoes were Black. She took the tomatoes to the back to show the kitchen manager & tell them to \"be more careful.\" It just didn't seem like a coincidence that the cooks served me a bad salad after I made them redo it & I emphasized that to Debbie but she was no help. In fact, she made my experience worse by talking to me as though I were a twelve year old. She never returned after she took the tomatoes to the kitchen. Mike was the only person who actually helped, which is why I'm leaving two stars instead of one. Kudos to Mike for working with such immature and unprofessional people. & thank you for not charging us for the salad, I wouldn't have paid for it anyway."}
{"text":"The food was quality. We had burgers and tacos. We sat at the bar to avoid the wait. Bartenders were quick and helped with suggestions on different beers. They have one of the largest selections of draft that you will find. We enjoyed the entire promenade vibe."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and i absoltely LOVE every single dish from them and the waitress i got the first time was amazing however i am only giving 4 stars due to my recent experience. I ordered my favorite pizza and it was completly sloppy. Barely any toppings on my bbq pizza, a thin crust and tons of sauce. It was so good we ate it anyways but was hoping on a bit better of presentation. Best pizza ever but not last night."}
{"text":"If you need a place to meet up with some family or friends and have a good meal and some drinks this is definitely the place to go. The variety of food is incredible and the quality is to match. I've had wonderful jambalaya, a great fried chicken and sweet potato pancakes dinner, all the way to their great burgers and vampire tacos. Huge selection of beers that are all on tap. Just be sure to check wait times before you go, it can get busy on the weekends."}
{"text":"It doesn't matter where you have tried the Yard House whether its in Long Beach, Denver, or Phoenix you are almost always guaranteed great service, good food, and a killer beer selection. Poke Nachos are very good, Ahi Tuna sandwich also very good, burgers and tacos are also surprisingly good. This particular Yard House though was quite busy and a long wait so be prepared."}
{"text":"Pricey food. Mac and cheese  and beer were great. You can  have better chicken lettuce wraps at PF Changs, truffle fries are better at Bachi Burger. The tacos are too overpriced and you're better off getting them cheaper from a real Mexican restaurant. It might best for them to stick to American food."}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant, I've never been disappointed in the food each time I come.  I just wish there were more locations or at least one by me.  Poke nachos were good and for the first time I was able to eat raw jalapeño.  They sliced them so thinly that I got the kick without the burn.  The garlic shiitake noodles were great as usual and a hit with the toddler.  I was happy the Kale Caesar salad included extra atypical ingredients - pistachios, Golden raisins, etc.  Made a regular Caesar much more interesting.  My hot pastrami sandwich was great as well but bread a little hard from toasting.  I don't know much about pastrami but this one seemed much better quality than the typical deli.  Overall a great lunch!"}
{"text":"Thank you Meredith for making father-daughter lunch great.  You are an awesome server.  The rib eye and filet mignon was cooked perfectly. Keep up the excellent work."}
{"text":"i don't know if it's because i've been to the original yard house and it was so good... but, i was kind of disappointed with the quality of food here.

truffle fries were not hot & crispy. they were at the point where they were like cardboard. the pizza i ordered was alright. just didn't taste as flavorful as i expected it to be.

will give another try, but probably won't go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"Shoutout to JORDYN!!! Best server at Yard House. Her recommendations for drinks and food are the best. definitely coming back."}
{"text":"The wife and I stopped in last Saturday for lunch and had a great experience.  The staff was very nice and helpful.  April helped us with our beverages and meal.  She was fabulous.  The help she provided was a big part of why we had such a good time.  The nachos & street tacos were great."}
{"text":"I chose yard house as the place to eat on my 21st birthday, Tuesday. I will have to say I'm glad I did!!  I really like it a lot the food was awesome, the atmosphere was great, the waiter was really attentive. I tried my first mixed drink the pineapple express!  It was pretty tasty with the hint of mint I really enjoyed it!! The overall experience was really great, I will defiantly be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Yardhouse is always a good time. Long time restaraunter first time helper. This place is my go to. Great food, great service, and an amazing selection of beer. My only complaint of this place is that the beer is not ice cold but I guess that is expected with this many beers on tap. Dessie is absolutely the best bar tender if you decide to sit at the bar and if you decide to get a table ask for Eddie. This guy knows his beers. He's the real deal."}
{"text":"This a great place in the middle of an open air market with stores, restaurants, bars and entertainment. It is also not too far from the Monorail!  I came here with friends for our last night in Vegas. The staff was friendly. The place lively. Our waitress clarified any questions about the menu. Our meals were delicious. One of my top choices. I had the roasted turkey pot pie. Flakey crust with carrots and celery. Just perfect!  I felt like I was almost enjoying Thanksgiving!  The others raved about their salads. Good size portions.  And we never felt rushed so we enjoyed a great meal!  Oh and the mojitos were tasty too."}
{"text":"Chances are you've already hit this spot a few times in your dining/going out for drinks career. We all have. Honestly, I can't say I've had many pleasant experiences here. Prior to this past Friday the food had always been sub par and the service so-so. 

That all changed when I ordered their chicken nachos and the other three people in my party all had burgers. Everything was absolutely spot on. The nachos were gigante (hee-gaunt-a)! The chicken was super moist, almost like it came from a rotisserie. That's pretty key because the chicken on nachos is usually dry and stringy. Not this time. The red salsa they put on it was really good too. Enough cheese and guac as well as sour cream really led this to be the dish I had been waiting all week for and didn't know it. Super good. Everyones burgers appeared to be solid as well - I think all 4 members of the group were honorary members of the \"Clean Plate Club.\" The service was good enough - dont' recall the servers name, but he kept the drinks full for the most part, gave us enough time to look at their gigantic menu. The only thing that I didn't care for was that I asked him if he could put on the UNLV basketball game. I don't know if it was on TV or not, but he never was able to get the game on and he never mentioned it again. I would have appreciated some sort of acknowledgment - that said, it was crazy busy and I can totally excuse the oversight. 

After a few bad experiences I'm happy to report out a good one. I definitely won't avoid this place as openly as I had in the past. Great turnaround and Yard House always has a lively atmosphere which I like."}
{"text":"Always love this place. I love when they switch up their IPAs. Super friendly staff awesome team. Love sitting at the bar. Always so friendly."}
{"text":"So my friend recommended this place and I was excited to try it. At first I wasn't impressed with my dish and I expressed what was wrong and our waitress Lisa was on it to get it fixed. She offered to get me a new order and also told her manager Cory to come talk to me. The manager with no hesitation just like Lisa offered me a new plate and made sure I was happy. Cory even check up on me multiple times to make sure I was satisfied. Cory is a good manager and very friendly. Service was great from the time we sat down till the time we left. Even tho I didn't get a great first impressed of my food I was was wowed in the end and I'll be coming back to see Lisa. She was adorable and a great waitress."}
{"text":"Had lunch today with my friends and I've been here couple of times and only good things I have to say at this location of Yardhouse. 

Lets just say the food was awesome!!!! I ordered Cobb salad sans avocado with grilled chicken, and my friends had Gardein vegan burger and Mac&Cheese along with mimosas. The mimosas were a little too strong for me but I like it anyway. For desert we had mini chocolate soufflé cake & mini crème brûlée. 

Our waiter was SUPER awesome! She was very attentive and super nice! And so does the food servers! Because we requested outside seating, we were told it's a 15 minutes wait. But honestly we probably wait like 5 minutes or so and we were seated outside. It was super hot today and unfortunately we were seated under a heating thing. So we asked to move to the next table because 70° weather and heater over your head, I didn't wanted to be an oven roasted turkey. There was a slight delay with our food. I think it's because of the lunch time and today being a Saturday. We ordered couple of dishes to go and surprisingly our to go orders came first. But anyway we had such a fun time and the food was amazing to go with a good date with your friends."}
{"text":"Great high end sports bar that's good for the  entire family. Great menu variety and great guest experience."}
{"text":"Fantastic Service
Awesome Food
Little Pricey
Allows food Customization and still tastes great.
Totally Impressed.
I am a regular customer, i go there once every week.

After my last visit i would like to make one quick suggestion:
Restaurant should highly concentrate on hiring or training quality servers. Suggest not to pick who doesn't know how to treat their customers.
Great food is always complimented by better service."}
{"text":"They have a great beer selection!  Love to get the half yard beers.  They play great music, have lots of TV's all over the place.  Great atmosphere, the service is friendly, helpful and quick!  I don't mind coming here at all for dinner, but it is definitely a bit on the pricey side.  Just like the reviewer below I hate to pay over $100 for dinner for 2 with only a couple of drinks.  
I would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't so much on the expensive side and if they would not have gotten rid of the oregon honey beer.  If ever visiting west gate I would rather come here than go to Kabuki's.  Quick tip, get here early because there is usually a long wait if you get there when there is a crowd."}
{"text":"Cheap food and drinks. Nice and easy go-to place for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"I'm the type of guy that almost gives The Yard House 5 stars on the beer alone.  There is no other game in town that comes close to their variety...and so many truly great selections on tap!

The beer selection literally pleases everyone regardless of what you're looking for!...of course they have too many American Lagers...but they also have as many Belgium Whites and IPA's!

One of my favorite bar pairings is at the YD.  I am so fond of the Bearnaise Sliders with a Big Sky Moose Drool.  It is not my favorite beer on the menu by far, but together they make sweet X-Rated magic in my mouth!

I really enjoy the Hawaiian Poke, the Mac-N-Cheese, the Enchilada Stack, and the Vegan \"Boneless\" Wings.  They have several other staples as well though.  You have to try to pick out something that isn't downright good!"}
{"text":"Tonight was another date night with my beautiful bride! I decided to come here because the last time we were here the food was great and I wanted to sample some of their amazing beer. 

Tonight our server was Beau. He was wonderful and made great recommendations. I think this review moved up to the 5th star level because of his wonderful and attentive service to us. 

I liked that we could sample around a little bit before I found \"my\" beer. LOL! I had the Speakeasy Double Daddy IPA. It had a deep hoppy flavor. Seriously they have the biggest selection of draft beer around. I can't believe someone couldn't find a favorite here.

Laurie had the same thing she had last time. The Spicy grilled chicken flat bread sandwich and she asked our waiter Beau to sub the fries for a salad. No problem! I ordered the Mac+Cheese2 and it had pulled chicken breast, applewood bacon, wild mushrooms, cheddar, parmesan, campanelle pasta and truffle oil. It was as good as it sounds. The campanelle pasta was on point. I loved that it was not overcooked like you might find in some mac and cheeses.

This whole time while we are enjoying our meal we were never in need of anything. After the customary check back to see how our meal was and if everything was as we wanted we never had a want for a soda or water glass to be refilled. Beau also recommended another beer and brought us over samples, while consistently keeping our table cleared of any empty plates.

Desert was in my mind as I had read a previous Yelpers compliments of the Salted Carmel Butterscotch pudding. I ordered it and when it was brought to the table it had a great presentation, but an even better taste. The only thing that could of made it better is if they could of put the salt all the way around the top of it. Laurie had 4 spoonfuls before she ever tasted it, and I had 1 and was coughing because it was all on my side of the cup. It was too much for me, but might have been fine had it been spread around. Don't take this wrong, it was great and I probably would order it again!!

Overall I feel that service can make or break a great restaurant. I think that the Yard House is certainly becoming one of my favorite places to dine. The great food and the service we received tonight has me already planning my return!"}
{"text":"I had one of my best trips to Yard House yesterday (9/23) afternoon! The food was phenomenal, but what made the experience even better was our waitress Decelaine. She was extremely personable, friendly, and had extensive knowledge of the menu. It's waiting staff like her that make going out to eat a pleasant experience. Will definitely be returning for future eating excursions."}
{"text":"Been here before never had an issue . Loved the food. Service was terrible . 10 minutes after being seated before the server said a word to us. Went 3/4 through the main course without a refill on a drink and then no ice in the drink. Seemed to ignore requests and left me shaking mad. When I approached a manager about the situation , she said \"sorry bout that\" and \"that's not like him\" and then nothing else . Very disappointed ."}
{"text":"We went to Yard House before heading across the Strip to see Absinthe. Seated promptly and my wife's day was made when she was asked for ID.

As we were there at happy hour, we ordered some of the reduced price appetisers rather than going for entrees. All were delicious and very generously portioned. 4 appetisers between us was more than enough.

Sierra Nevada on draft in the UK is a rarity so I ordered up a half yard of Sierra Nevada.  After I'd finished that, I asked for another pint of Sierra Nevada and an Old 43 cocktail (woodford reserve bourbon, licor 43, house citrus agave, orange bitters). I was told that I couldn't have both at the same time and would need to finish at least half my pint! What? But, if I ordered a half yard, I could have both at the same time. A crazy rule which makes no sense and the reason for 4 stars.

Service was good and my wife had a free souffle and ice cream as it was her birthday."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out and eat/drink before a Coyotes game.  One of the largest food and beer menus I've seen.  Would have been 5 stars, but our service wasn't the best last time out.  We will be back again."}
{"text":"Good place for some quick eats and crazy large beers. Had the lunch special $9.99. Pizza and French onion soup. Pizza was tasty didn't care too much for the soup."}
{"text":"My family went to Yard House to celebrate my daughter's graduation from college. We were a party of 5 and we sat on the patio. It was a Thursday night, so not too busy overall. The service was painfully slow! It was a 3 hour experience. Our grandson's order was wrong! He was given chicken instead of the steak he ordered. He had to wait 20 minutes for it to be replaced - which is not easy for an 8 year old! Another member of our party was given burnt fish and chips which she wasn't able to eat. My steak sandwich was pretty darn good though! The manager came over to apologize and offered free desert for our trouble. Little did we realize we would have to wait 24 more minutes for the 2 small deserts she brought for our table of 5! She should have comped our whole meal! When a restaurant ruins a special occasion they should work hard to make it better - not make it worse. Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here on Saturday night around 10:30 p.m. after bowling for our date night, and we were so disappointed.  I have heard lots of great things about Yard House, so I was excited to try it out.

When we first entered the restaurant, we were struck by the ambiance inside.  It's beautifully decorated and well-maintained.  The hostess was nice, and asked us if we preferred to sit inside or outside on the patio.  We opted for the patio since it was a beautiful night.  We walked around to our spot and about 10 minutes went by before we were greeted by our waitress.  She advised us that she wasn't supposed to be given any more tables so she could go home, so we were her last.  It made us feel awkward and rushed.

We put in our order quickly, which was pretty disappointing because we didn't get a chance to really review the drink and menu offerings.  I was interested in trying a yummy cocktail, but I didn't get time to review the menu and I was afraid to ask questions lest the waitress need to stay around and waste time.  So, I just ordered a Coke.  My husband was going to try a few new beers, but just went with Newcastle.  At least it was on tap!

We ordered the California Roll, which is actually just a large \"cake\" of sushi.  It was supposed to be fancy, but in my opinion was lame and the staff should let people know that it's not your typical roll.  Also, we ordered it without the wasabi soy sauce, and, naturally, it was doused with it.  I also ordered the chopped salad, which, unfortunately, was covered in a disgusting dressing that I later found out was \"bloody mary vinaigrette.\"  This was missing from the menu description.  When the waitress noticed I hadn't eaten much of the salad, she asked if I liked it and I told her \"No, the dressing is too harsh and the flavors don't work well together for me.\"  She replied that it was one of her favorite things on the menu and shrugged her shoulders.  Sigh.  I had hoped maybe she would offer to have it remade without the dressing, or something.  But, she was busy waiting for us to get the heck out of there, so, that was a $10 waste of money and food.

Dinner was a bit better.  I had a margherita pizza, which, admittedly, is pretty difficult to screw up.  My husband had some orange chicken, which he said was decent enough.  I had eaten 2 pieces of pizza when the waitress came around and asked if I need a box.  Almost like: Can you please go home now?  After she brought the box, she left the check and said: \"No rush.\"  Which literally made me laugh out loud.  

We paid for the entire meal and left, in quite a disappointed fashion.  I will not be going back.  I would've been happier going to Roberto's!"}
{"text":"Hit this place before a concert at jobing.com arena & am so glad we did.  It's way better than your typical chain.  Menu is huge....if you can't find something you like here, you've got a problem!  We went for lunch & had the noodle appetizer, sweet potato fries, a small salad and a burger.  All were very good.  Then we went back for happy hour & had a couple of drinks & nachos, which were great.  I tend to avoid chains like the plague, but I would go back to this place in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner and had a pleasant experience! The service was very friendly from both the bar and wait staff. We had amazing apps: they consisted of truffle fries and a few tacos! They were sooo good! They also have a ridiculous amount of beer choices!!! I took a few stars away for the main course. My husband and I both had pasta dishes (Mac2 and a penne with chicken) which were a little cold and not the greatest in flavor!"}
{"text":"This is definitely my Go To when we are at Westgate.  Love the many beers on tap option and we always have great food.  Sometimes the wait is lengthy but if there are events at Westgate...you can expect that."}
{"text":"The service was great and the food was amazing. Awesomely large drink selection. It was a little loud but considering how many people were here I expected it to be louder. Our waiter was great and I honestly couldn't recommend the food more. This is a great place to get some great food and some great beer."}
{"text":"We had a few issues with our food (fries were cold, soup came late), but the manager was excellent and wanted to make sure we had a good first experience. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Yard House never disappoints I have have been to several all over the nation and all of them are consistent as far as food and service goes. The new poki nachos are excellent as well as the rib-eye sandwich with truffle fries. Not to mention you cant go wrong with a place that has over 75 craft beers on tap."}
{"text":"Fun place to grab beer and food in groups.  You can catch a sports game or just chill out and drink."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a two stars just because I could have received better service somewhere else. I came here with a group of friends for a birthday dinner on a Tuesday night. Our group and two other groups were the only ones there so I have no idea how the waiter missed my order. I ordered artichoke dip and chips, the waiter asked me if I wanted it to be served when everyone else got their food just because it's an appetizer. I said yes and everyone's food came out except mine. I waited for a bit then my bf told me to ask the waiter. I asked the waiter about my order and he said he will check the kitchen. Minutes past and no answer, I asked another waiter to check what happen to my order. He went to the kitchen came back and told me that the order was lost and my food will be done soon even though everyone was almost done with theirs. I didn't want to make a scene because it was my friend's birthday and I didn't want to ruin her dinner even though she was annoyed with the staff. My food finally arrived and it wasn't artichoke dip it was a whole steamed artichoke. I told the waiter I didn't order this and he offered to take it back. I told him no because I was starving. I ate it, it was good but not as filling as the dip would been but they did give it to me for free! I just wished my experience was better."}
{"text":"Love this place, service can suck when it's busy-nothing like eating soup with a fork! But a few must try's are are chicken tortilla soup and ahi!!"}
{"text":"Ahhhhh... beer.  Nice thing about Yardhouse... they carry Dogfish Head beer so you can try a glass of one of their IPA's for 6.25 a glass versus buying a 6pack for $10.

Well... on a personal note... I don't know about you... but I would totally buy the 6pack and just suck it down... but that's just me.  ;-)

So I tried the Smithwicks. Oddly enough, as a beer lover, I didn't even realize this stuff is readily available at local places, like Fry's.  Very good amber beer.

I also tried the Firestone union station ipa... to me, you can't go wrong with an IPA.

I had the orange peel chicken which was very sweet but nicely flavored other than that. 

Server was cool and friendly.

It was nice to sit outside with the heaters and everything and just people watch.  It's a calming spot after a hard week."}
{"text":"This place deserves 5 stars. I wish I could give you more. Coming from many years in the service industry, watching this place function is a treat. 

 I love coming here every time I am in Vegas. The ambience, the food, the beer, and the service is all great. From what I've experienced, everyone here knows what they're doing, and definitely has patience as you look through their extensive menus. 

I am spoiled by the amount of beer and the prices from my home state (Wisconsin). Coming here feels like home, with the 160 or so beers on tap, and the decent prices - especially during happy hour. 

The food comes out promptly, no matter how busy, and without any mistakes. It is always beautifully plated and tastes amazing. And! If I may add, adapts to allergies as necessary. 

Eric is a fantastic bartender, by the way. Smiling and friendly, and knows how to talk to customers. Taylor is also great, paying attention and making sure your glass is full. Tim is awesome at suggesting beers. And Lauren is on top of it right when you come in, making sure you feel welcome."}
{"text":"The food is OK the apps a little overpriced and disagree which is just fruit chews and cheap red wine was a little overpriced"}
{"text":"This was one of the best lunch experiences I have had in a long time. We where seated promptly but our waitress Heather was busy so it took a little bit of time. The manager Falecia came by and took our order when Heather came by she apologized and said my Margarita was on the house. The meal was excellent and so was the service. I WILL BE RETURNING!! Thank you Yard House!!!  YUMMY"}
{"text":"This place is massive!! I mean I haven't seen too many restaurants this large. Not a very mixed crowd.

The waitress staff are awesome, bartenders not so much. I've been more than once.

We ate, had some drinks and played corn hole. They have fooseball and table tennis. 

Nice spot"}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place ! It was packed on a Saturday night but the wait was 10 minutes which is not bad ! Them poke nachos were soooo bomb my new favorite seriously a wow factor! Ordered pepper jack burger with sweet potato which wa alright , burger lacked flavor but it was cooked medium like how I want it.  I would define come back again. The only thing I don't like is how they ask what to drink right when I sat down , I haven't even looked at the menu!"}
{"text":"To be totally accurate I would give yardhouse a 3 and a half star rating. Overall its prices are way too high so it does have a great selection of beers and a pretty varied food menu as well.  We were over charged by 5 dollars by our bartender and he didn't apologize for the mistake....which I caught... I would say that didn't help. Definitely go during happy hour when most apps and brews seem to be half price.  I've been to other sports bars that had quite a few beers on tap that weren't nearly as expensive. Be very very careful of your spending here because totals will add up in a hurry."}
{"text":"Yard house never disappoints.  The food is always consistent and delicious.  I come here regularly for the miso sea bass.  The bartenders are amazing!  They are pros at remembering what you drink and making sure your food comes out exactly how you ask.  I'm usually not a fan of corporate chain restaurants, but yard house definitely sets itself apart from the pack with their extensive food and beer selections.  This is the best place to eat if shopping around Desert Ridge or going to see a movie."}
{"text":"Great place !!! Came here for Valentine's Day and everyone was so nice customer service is great people ! Manager was so nice and really cared i will always recommend this place"}
{"text":"I've been back here a handful of times since I last reviewed Yard House and in that time they have definitely earned another star from me. From walking in the door and waiting to be seated to paying the bill and getting my to-go box the service has been great. Even when they are slammed and I have to wait for a table the staff has taken good care of us.

We are big fans of the variety of beer on tap and the lobster garlic noodles are a staple at my table. I usually visit with a variety of people with different beer preferences and they offer something for everyone at the bar. My server, Jerri, also did a good job of making some drink reccommendations after we found out that they were actually out of one of the brews on the menu. 

I've ordered the seared sea scallops and orzo pasta with wild mushrooms and white truffle sun-dried tomato sauce twice. The first time it was really good, which is why I ordered it again. The second round was just ok. Not as good as I remembered it. The sea bass is pretty good and I really like the organic tomato and basil bisque. The bisque is consistent, you can't go wrong. I will be back soon and I will order it again."}
{"text":"Was here on January 3rd around 8pm for dinner and the wait time was horrendous to sit inside so we chose to sit at the heated and covered outdoor patio despite the wind and cold. The hostesses both acted as if they didn't want our business but we stuck it out because we were at Town Square and wanted a sit down meal (plus the food is really good here). The waiter, I think his name was Celal, was so sweet and helpful. His recommendations were spot-on and our food came quickly despite the full restaurant. He looked to be juggling about a quarter of the tables himself, and was always checking on us. The food was amazing. The covered patio heaters worked well so we weren't freezing our bums off and the tables and silverware were spotlessly clean."}
{"text":"We went on a slow night and waited 30 minutes before our server even came over to order our drinks. She walked by plenty of times but didn't stop."}
{"text":"Had to wait 45 minutes to get seated on a Saturday night.  Liked the beer flight.  Cheap way to sample an assortment of beers.

Had the veggie burger Hawaiian style.  Didn't care much for the gardein meat product they use.  The fries were decent.  When I checked the calorie count after I could not believe how many calories and fat were packed into my meal."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Waited over 2 hours for a table. Ben one of the managers gave the worst customer service I have ever experienced kept giving our table away. I worked for yardhouse, it was once a good company.  DO NOT COME HERE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY GO ANYWHERE ELSE!"}
{"text":"I love going to Yard House.  Great atmosphere in the awesome Town Square that I have come to know and love as the best part of Las Vegas.  In addition to their friendly staff, they also have great food!  You can't miss the Mac and Cheese2 (squared).   Their entire menu is made up of comfort food, so if you are down to eat pot pie and all the staples that grandma used to make, you have come to the right place.  They have a huge beer list, but unfortunately there are no descriptions of the beers, just names.  However, their staff is always happy to make suggestions by asking what you like.  Their awesome food and friendly staff plus the location is enough for me to give this place the elusive 5 star rating."}
{"text":"Service here was awesome. Friendly welcome and happy workers. Sat at the bar and Bartender Dani made the stay fun. That we didn't even realize we stayed until happy hr. Recommend her highly. And the food was really well made and came out in a timely matter."}
{"text":"I am a regular at Yard house and dont have too much to complain about - the beer is good and there is a very diverse selection - the food is also good for a bar and grill type place - unfortunately, this typically reflects in the bill. Lunch for two can easily exceed 80 bucks..If that is no big deal, the Yard house patio is a great location for lunch or dinner.."}
{"text":"I went fro a burger.  The rest of the family ended up with pizza.  Good food, can be  noisy as the gemes were on.  Service was good."}
{"text":"The last time the hubby and I were in Vegas we did the High Roller ride, and after we got done I noticed all of the new restaurants, shops, and Linq hotel down in this area. The Yard House particularly caught my eye and I said on our next visit this was a place that we would eat! Almost a year later, we were back and I was ready to give this place a try! We came to this location on a Saturday, after spending all day in the pool. We arrived around 3pm and there were very few people in here(guess we missed the lunch traffic). We were immediately greeted and taken to our table. For some reason we were seated with the waiter that was doing the most that day. One gentleman came by to get our drink order because our waiter was at another table. Finally, our waiter came and gave us the initial greeting. After he gave us time to look over the menu, another waitress came with our drinks. After a few more minutes our waiter finally returned to take our order. Let me tell you the menu here is EXTENSIVE! There is something here for everyone! They also have a full bar and over 100 different beers. My husband ordered a salad, I ordered a taco (I believe it was the Baja fish taco) and artichoke crab and lobster dip, and my brother ordered calamari and a burger with fries. The crab dip and calamari came out first---with a different waiter. Let me start with the artichoke dip-- how you do you say WONDERFUL!! This is some of the best artichoke, crab, and lobster dips I have ever had-- we finished this in minutes of it reaching the table. The calamari was pretty good the only issue was the restaurant fries pieces of lemon peels and mixed it in  with the fried calamari and I ate a lemon peel and wasn't happy with the tart taste. My taco was delicious! Everything on the taco was fresh and it was well put together. My brother's burger was massive. I didn't care to taste it but I took a piece of his yummy bacon from the burger and some of his fries. My husband opted to be healthy and eat a salad. His salad was actually pretty tasty along with one of the house dressings and chicken that was on it. I also ordered the House Tropic cocktail. It was ok, didn't find it to really peak my taste buds. At the end it was hard for us to find our waiter--they really over booked him--- so we tracked down another waiter and asked for our check. The price of food is decent in my opinion and the atmosphere in here makes you feel like you're in cool local bar and no longer in Vegas. Really enjoyed our meal here!"}
{"text":"Although the amount of times i've eaten at this particular Yard House is limited, I must say that they have exceptional service. This is especially true when it came to ordering food. I have had two separate experiences, where I had ordered food from Yard House through a third party delivery service (GrubHub) and there was a mix up in the order. First time was due to the GrubHub delivery person never showing up to pick up the order, the second time was due to my order not having the side of fries that came with it. Both times, I called Yard House and discussed the matter with them and both times it was handled extremely well by this particular Yard House's Manager. The gentleman even delivered the food personally without any obligation to (it was only due to me staying at the next door hotel), and even allowed me to add a complimentary item to the order (I chose a drink). Suffice to say, the food was good, and the service here has been amazing. Would definitely recommend it to others."}
{"text":"The real draw here is the staggering selection of beers. You'd have to go bar hopping half the night to find all these brews.  I go for some of the lighter brews, and they have a bunch of tasty choices. Unfortunately, they don't set up tasters. If you're at the bar, the bartender might be persuaded to let you sample something in a shot glass, but I'd like for them to  get some \"flights\" together, like Rock Bottom does. 

My gripe is that the food is way overpriced. It's good, however I've noticed that the portions can be somewhat small. My last visit was as a guest of someone with a gift card, but our pasta entrees were ON THE MOON at over $20. 

Two stars for the beer, one for the service."}
{"text":"hands down one of my favorite places to eat. Beer selection is probably the best with over 100 beers on tap and there food is awesome. Ive had there burgers which are awesome as well as there NY steak sandwich also there mac and cheese is to die for."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of the Yard House for years, how could you not love a place with over 100 beers on tap? While I love the food, things do seem a little bit pricey. I highly recommend going during Happy Hour, because you get half off all appetizers and discounted pints (and their portions are huge, so you could easily fill up on one appetizer). My favorite is their spicey tuna roll (warning: it doesn't look like your typical sushi but it's oh, so delicious!)"}
{"text":"I just absolutely love yard house , I've never had a problem with anything ever , service is always on point and food is always awesome . I always end up getting the Carnitas tacos plate ."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today. The service was great and the food was decent I'm on a diet so I checked yelp for some reviews. Someone recommended the mock chicken wings. So that's what I had and my sister had the soup and salad. I thought the mock chicken was good but not as good as Green. My sister said her soup and salad were fine."}
{"text":"Love, love, love! This place. Surprisingly we got in the restaurant on a weekend quickly ( not as quick as Townsquare, godawful long wait there) Anyways the food was great the beer was awesome! The nachos are the bomb and big enough for 2 people. I like the fact that you can try several beer samples before you buy. They have soo many choices so it helps with an indecisive mind! Love it, def will go again."}
{"text":"I won't be as harsh as my hubby about Yard House because I thought it was pretty ok. But truly just ok. In fact, I'd give it more 2.5 stars than the full 3, but I digress.

When we arrived we were informed by two very exasperated too-cool-for-you hostesses that they DO NOT take reservations. When informed that yes, in fact they do, particularly for a party of 10 or more, as per their website and especially when it was taken by the manager who spent 10 painstaking minutes on the phone with me announcing every step he was making in order to secure our reservation and telling me 3 times that everyone would know about our reservation. I should have known then that it would be a cluster-F.ck. They did find our reservation though on a small scrap of paper near the computer. The too-cool-for-you hostesses never apologized about not having it or being snippy. Then there was a whole lot of scurrying around to accomodate our party. The manager was alerted and he himself worked to get our table ready and was as polite as could be.  We had to wait a considerable amount of time beyond our reservation  time though and that's just not cool.

Our party was seated with Jason as our server. For me, Jason was the saving grace of our experience at Yard House. He was prompt, courteous, and definitely knew how to make things better for us. Our drinks were served promptly and kept filled.  Beers were just the right temp and refreshing. We did have a mishap in the kitchen with my brother's pizza getting burned, but I have to give them props for not trying to serve it anyway and hoping for the best like so many other places would do. 

I had the Swiss and Avocado burger and it was great. Friend had Ahi Sandwich and loved it. Hubby had fish and chips and enjoyed them but decided they were a bit bland.. It may have given him a bit of Montezuma's Revenge overnight as well, but you can read his review for those details. Another friend had Gorgonzola burger which he said was VERY salty. The BBQ Chicken pizza enjoyed by brother and his wife was good though it was served about 8 minutes after everyone else's food since the first one got burned. Chicken rice bowl was ENORMOUS, but went over well. Pasta dishes were large and filling as well.  I would say overall, the food was fair, but it was about $5-$10 more in price point per plate than it should have been. Of course, you are paying for location so it's kind of to be expected I suppose.

So, thanks to Jason, my girlfriends and I will probably give Yard House another try....but definitely NOT on a night where there is a game or show at the nearby venues.  It was excessively noisy and the bar definitely took priority over the restaurant aspect of the place. And I might convince the hubby to give it a try again too. Maybe."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I have been here at least four times and have yet to have a bad or even slightly negative experience. The following is about my most recent experience. 

We met with a couple of our friends for drinks and dinner on a Friday. We were quoted 25-30 minutes, and were seated in 20. They were pumping people in and out of there quickly and turnover was efficient to say the least. 

Service is always excellent. Our server this time around was the perfect blend of attentive without being annoying. Despite being incredibly busy, we couldn't tell because he never skipped a beat, never made us wait long for anything, and never seem rushed/hurried/dismissive. 

Food is surprisingly good here. The exception being the calamari was rubbery and definitely overdone, and the two dips were rather bland (one was a marinara and one was some sort of jalapeño something or other). I have had ALL of their pasta dishes, and for a place you would expect to only have \"bar food\" the pastas are DELICIOUS! They are willing to substitute different types of pasta in each dish if you want (I subbed the penne for angel hair). Food prices are $1-2 too high in my opinion. 

Drinks: One of the reasons I like this place so much is the beer selection is MASSIVE. I have never had the same beer twice. Only like ciders? Well they have several to choose from of those as well. Beer flights here are also a great idea and affordable. 

Definitely will be back! Especially as it warms up to sit on the patio."}
{"text":"This was soo good. A beautiful space with so many draft beers. I got one of the house brews and it was delicious.
My tuna steak sandwich was amazing. It was seared perfectly and had a fantastic pink interior."}
{"text":"They have a lot of beer on tap, but it is almost not worth it just for the slow service ( I know other reviewers had no problem with service, but our server messed up our beer orders twice and was not quick about it, maybe she was having an off night) and the Snottsdale crowd.  When I heard the trendy girls ordering  mixed drinks it made me want to point them in the direction of the nearest scottsdale scene bar and give them a swift kick in their $150 jeans .  Why go to the Yardhouse where there are so many delicious beers on tap and order some sugary horrible cocktail??  Alas, I am not meant to understand and I accept and embrace that fact.

The food is ok, nothing special and certainly not worth the price they charge.  If you are looking for an impressive selection of beer, show up to the Yard House  for happy hour, order a good beer or two and then head on over to Papago Brewing for the rest of the night."}
{"text":"First time coming here and it was amazing! Inside was nice, the waiters was really nice and the food was magnificent . I would come back here again soon for the food cause it was so good! I had the ribeye and it was absolutely perfect!"}
{"text":"I give this visit to Yard House 5 stars!!! Mostly for the fact that we had the best service we have had in a long time!!! 
We came on a Sunday evening around 3pm, we were greeted promptly by our server Matt. He was efficient and personable with a perfect table-side manner!! Yes the food was good, but his service made our experience at Yard House 5 stars worthy!"}
{"text":"The brews are good but if you aren't into paying more for the right to look \"cool\" you should pass on this place."}
{"text":"I love coming to this location. They have exceptional nachos and good drinks. I will not waiver when coming back. It always comes out kind of pricy but it is worth it. The sake bombs are decently pieced as well. But the food! That is what is superb!"}
{"text":"EVERYONE PAY ATTENTION 
I would give a zero if I could.
My family and I came in to have a good treat for the week. The wait was fair considering we asked for outside seating. Although we had to wait almost 10 minutes before being greeted. My son and husband ordered burger medium rare that came out medium well. When they remade them it was still not the right temperature. We just ate it anyway since we waited for them long. Everyone else was done with our food by the time they ate! I can't believe they didn't even offer anything for the inconvenience. Table presence is key to good service and it was not here. I didn't really want to come back to this place because of service. I hate being profiled. I gave it a chance since they have great beer selection.  Which, by the way, we did not get in a timely manner. I pretty much hate this place now!!!!!!! Our server was lucky that we still tipped 15%! We go out to eat a lot. WE ARE NOT COMING BACK HERE!!!"}
{"text":"Too greasy. I am sure that is their plan. Grease and salt the heck out of the food, so people will need to drink more beer. We will never the go there again."}
{"text":"Food and service was fantastic.  This was my first visit there on the recommendation of several friends and I can see why they enjoyed it. 
The menu is upscale versions of classic favorites. It's on the pricy side but worth it. 

I would give 5 stars but the side section of the dining room had poor sound handling. It was unbearably loud even though few tables were occupied due to the bare walls. I love their stripped down look and feel, but they've sacrificed anything to absorb normal restaurant noise. That said, I'll be back and will try sitting in a different section."}
{"text":"After having a horrific experience at Nori Sushi next door where we ended up leaving before even receiving our drinks, we were hungry and had to be home soon after wasting time at there. So after leaving Nori we curved to the left and went to Yard House. There we were greeted by a very friendly hostess (she actually said Hi to us, which was an upgrade from where we had just come from) and were seated immediately. Our server, Joshua, was equally friendly and we gave us a wonderful dining experience. I got the ahi poke nachos which are to DIE FOR! As well as a kale cesar salad which was also great. And my husband got the streak Cobb salad which he also enjoyed. The manager even came out to check on us and even comped our first round of drinks after hearing about our experience at the other restaurant. Honestly between the service and the food it really turned our night around! We very rarely get to go out with two small boys so I really thought the night was ruined after receiving comically horrible service from Nori (we left before we even received our drinks it was so bad) but Yard House turned it around for us! Thanks guys and we will be back :)"}
{"text":"We went on a nice drive out to Red Rock Casino and decided to hit up the HH at the Yard House.  I started off with a Victory IPA and the buffalo chicken wings.  We then proceeded to try some lettuce wraps, chicken pizza, poke stack, spinach dip and the seared ahi.  Everything was excellent, especially the lettuce wraps and the poke stack.  

Next beer on the list was a Boulder Beer chocolate porter on nitro.  Smooth, delicious and very creamy.  I remember drinking Boulder Beer way back when and I always thought their beers were very tasty, and this was no exception.  

The service at the bar was excellent and our bartender was on her game (I believe her name was Aimee) and very attentive to our needs. We will definitely stop back in to try a few more beers and try some of the tasty appetizers that we missed."}
{"text":"I never made it in here to eat, we just came to drink.  (Sounds like the start of a drinking story, doesn't it?)  Good atmosphere.  The yard of beer is an interesting idea, but truthfully, I'd be afraid to consume one of those things.  Anyway, we had several different beers and a pint didn't cost as much as I'd expect.  I'd only make the request of having more Midwestern beers, but I'm biased like that."}
{"text":"My husband and I really enjoy coming here when we come to town. The food is always tasty! 
We came here on New Year's Eve, which we understand would be a busy evening, and is one of the reasons we made a reservation ahead of time (7:08pm to be exact). We arrived at the restaurant about 7:30ish, and waited until 8:20 to be seated. Our waiter, Otto, was amazing. I have nothing but nice things to say about this man! He was on top of our drinks, and food and made sure we were well taken care of. 
I would have given 5 stars, but the only complaint I have is, you should teach your hostesses not to roll their eyes when a simple question is asked. Other than that, as I mentioned above, we enjoy coming here! It is our, 'go to' restaurant for date nights!"}
{"text":"Very attentive service and very good food.  Also, I was impressed that the iced tea was nice and fresh.  So I am a dork and didn't try the steak or any of the beers.  I had a grilled cheese sandwich that was a gourmet masterpiece and every cheese lovers dream.  The sandwich came with a delicious tomato soup.  Also, split the artichoke crab dip.  It was good too.  I am looking forward to returning to try some beer and enjoy guy-watching."}
{"text":"Waiting, waiting, waiting, do I need to say more?  Had to ask for service. Really? Better get ready for football season."}
{"text":"I always enjoy the Yard House; this new location did not disappoint. Beer selection was the usual - massive, high quality and a well organized menu to find what you want. The food and service were also great...the place felt far more polished than its recent opening would suggest. 

Considering how much good food there is in Vegas, it surprises me that there are not more beer centric bars and restaurants. This Yard House is really a savior, and the slightly off strip location creates a calm atmosphere that is a welcome relief from the mayhem elsewhere."}
{"text":"Poke nachos the best!!! Good specials and just a good time overall! Would recommend to all"}
{"text":"Great happy hour half price appetizers and $3.50 and up beers. Plenty of craft beers to choose from and great menu selection even for the pickiest of eaters. Friendly staff and casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"Just came from lunch there. It was the best burger I have ate yet. I had the BBQ bacon cheddar burger with a side of jalapeños to spice it up a little. Cooked perfect juicy and delicious. The fries were good but would have liked them a little more cooked to get that good crunch. I would definitely recommend this place. A little pricey but well worth it. Never had an empty drink and she remembered what I was drinking. That's a plus to me. My wife had the pizza and salad. She says it was good and very filling."}
{"text":"Wonderful place for dinner. Food is fresh. Location is convenient. The price is also reasonable compared to other restaurants on the strip. Must order: baha fish taco and the crunchy ahi salad. Tip - the small entre salad is more than enough."}
{"text":"I don't even care that this place isn't local because gosh darn it - it sure feels like it is! Along the string of chain restaurants that line the streets of crocker park, finally, we have a place worth returning to! Let's start with the food - Jumbalaya was great - and they use chicken sausage, even better! My friend got the BBQ Chicken pizza and though I preferred my meal, the pizza was good. We went with the dessert sampler, which felt like an appropriate end to the meal. I would encourage them to think a little outside the box for their dessert options though.

More than anything else, I was incredibly impressed by the service - our waiter was fantastic, skimming other reviews shows that this seems to be a consistent theme. We had multiple restaurant employees greet us throughout the evening and around the end someone came by to ensure that we had a good experience. I'm sorry, but this stuff truly counts. It is called the SERVICE industry for a reason. Now good service on its own cannot make up for poor quality food - but thankfully that's not a concern here. Everything was well done, and the ambiance is fantastic. Portion size is also appropriate for the price. Wonderful addition to Crocker Park, can't wait to return!!"}
{"text":"I've been to yard house a couple times now and each time I've gone I've yet to be satisfied. I recently went this week and ordered boneless wings. Just by the look of them I can tell they were overly cooked but I still took a bite out of one. They tasted burnt. I requested a new batch. When I received the wings they  tasted the same. If they did or did not redo my order something was wrong with the way they were cooked. Either it was the oil or just the recipe. I don't know about you but I don't like eating burnt wings, boneless or not."}
{"text":"I love this Yardhouse! I've never been to one I didn't love!We got our food super fast which is always a plus! Our waiter, Justin, had multiple beers to refer and they were all 3 amazing! We asked for something similar to Stella and he killed it! Our waters were full, we got 2 appetizers, our stomachs were full! The prawns were so good! You get 2 sauces with them! I preferred the orange one but they were both good!!!! And the sliders were large and perfect! Definitely going back to this Yardhouse. Multiple times! :)"}
{"text":"Went here today the food is just average, only thing i would not recommend? The street tacos. The steak was not seasoned at all and very dry. It was very chewy and fatty.  I ordered two steak tacos and pulled out every single piece of meat. The onion rings were good, but who messes up onion rings? Stick to a burger and fries at this place."}
{"text":"This place is mine and my best friends' go to place for HH (3pm-6pm, weekdays) for about two years or so now. They usually have a good amount of customers every time we come here but it never affects the solid customer service we receive. 

Today, we came around 3pm, were seated promptly and our drink orders came all in the span of 5 mins. We ordered off of the HH menu which ranged from $3-$8 per dish. The onion ring tower, poke nachos, and calamari plate were enough to feed a group of four comfortably but of course we ordered all that just between the two of us. The bill reached about $20, not bad for dishes that usually cost double during regular hours. 

The inside is kinda dim which portrays a more intimate setting. A little loud when the games are on the bar tv (or when people deliberately scream when they're talking to the person in front of them) but overall I like coming to this place.

I can only assume that this place is better than the one at the Linq since that's tourist central. If you're local, you should come to this location!"}
{"text":"Took 30 minutes to get a beer after we sat down and it didn't get easier after that. Server was rude to our party the entire time. Great beer selection if you can get one. Food was average at best.  With so many other options in the immediate area, don't see a reason to come back."}
{"text":"My wife loves the yard house. She comes here for happy hour often and it's fantastic. They have a massive beer selection and the six pack sampler is a nice way to try new kinds. The edamame  is a great starter. I highly recommend the vampire tacos. The service was ok but it was busy when I came on a Sunday evening. My only complaints are how loud it was and our table was small and became crowded making it a little difficult to eat. Overall a great place though."}
{"text":"Solid, good food that we have come to know at all Yard houses. We especially love the chicken avocado sandwich and their turkey club is top 10 for club sandwiches. 
Tried the kale Cesar also. It's a nice mix of romaine lettuce and kale."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The portions are huge.  The chicken pot pie is comically huge and delicious.  They've got a million beers and ciders available and a wide selection on the menu.  The mac and cheese squared, my favorite, has apple wood smoked bacon and truffle oil.  The also make some great street tacos and personal pizzas.  The staff is friendly and great with kids too.  This is a great place to eat before you catch a movie."}
{"text":"I had the worst experience at this location. I was in town on vacation and my friends from PHX suggested we go here. Our group was about 12-15 of us and it took us a while to be seated -- fine, whatever, no biggie.

But once we sit, out waiter takes FOREVER to even say hi to us, small talking with the table behind us (the only other people he was serving). So finally he comes over and before we ordered anything, I wanted to get a round of shots to start off our vacation. Six shots took TWENTY MINUTES to come -- and the bar was an arm's length away. So I wanted to saddle up the shots bill right away -- I was charged GRATUITY for shots. Whatever, I just won't tip on it and let it pass.

Also, as someone mentioned above -- all of us were carded and hassled for our out of state IDs, even though everyone in our group was over 25.

The waiter continues to take forever and becoming frustrated, I just start to go to the bar myself to get drinks. After my 2nd or 3rd round, the manager tells me I need to stop going to the bar to get my drinks and I HAVE to let the waiter serve them (they really want that gratuity). He sits down and I tell him how slow and frustrated I am with his service. He tells me he'll make it better, asks me what I want to drink and says \"I got it.\"

So, you'd think free beer on the house, right? Nope! I get a tab at the end of the night for that drink. I hand the bill to the manager and he says, \"I never said it was free, I said I would GET IT FOR YOU.\" Oh, thanks for your great service.

Will never EVER step foot in this place just because of the customer service. Food and drinks were fine, but up there with some of the worse service I've had."}
{"text":"The staff: We always get some really outspoken and personable server.  Whether it's when we're sitting outside, getting showered by the misters, or we're inside and my friend Grace is spilling her water all across the table and I'm pulling a Neo and miraculously dodging a drenching; they've always got some witty remark to keep the ball rolling.  Maybe we're just setting them up with situations to be a smart ass, or they're just naturally that clever.  Either way, it's always a good time.

The goods: Happy Hour. Happy Hour. Happy Hour. Happy Hour. Happy Hour.  Their apps are re-dic and when they're half off they taste even better.  Love the calamari and chicken tenders.  Had a beer called \"Twilight\".  Combination of Guinness and Blue Moon.  Honestly I just got it because I hoped Edward Cullen would come sprinting around the corner.  Kidding...or am I?  No, seriously though, it was a great beer.  Not too sweet, not too bitter.

The atmosphere:  It's a pretty live joint, day or night.  Can't tell the locals from the tourists; don't really care.  Everyone's there for the same thing.

Great place for girls night out because according to Maria, Yardhouse gives out condoms because their waiters are fiiiiiinnnnnnnnnne.  I'm not gonna disagree with her, but I try not to leer at the employees.  Call me crazy but I think drooling into my buffalo wings while I'm undressing Timmy/Justin/Brad with my eyes would be considered rude.  The place is a lot of fun, and it's a walk away from Cadillac Ranch (which I heard will be closing soon!?!) and Blue Martini.  If you're on the South side of town, I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"We haven't been here for awhile, and we wanted to football, so came here. I had the turkey pot pie, which was not great. Too many onions and undercooked celery. The turkey was tough and my husband said the same was true for the chicken fingers."}
{"text":"What a great, great last time out in Vegas.

I was invited to a get together with some work folks and was accompanied by the ultimate gentleman.  I have fond memories of many of their locations (Costa Mesa, Irvine, Long Beach and West Palm Beach) and it was always with a crowd, so this is one of those chain places where good times are guaranteed.  

We went for happy hour since the appetizers were half priced and pints were 3.25.  The beer selection is HUGE and my companion and I had a hard time in choosing something to start with.  One of the two servers taking care of our table suggested we get a \"pre-designed\" sampler.  This is when the bar selects six beers for you, rather than you choosing six, and they stay within a certain medium, such as pale ales, darks, etc.  We wanted something in the medium category.  

The sampler is something I totally recommend you do if you're undecided about what beer you'd like and you have someone to share with you.  We sipped each beer, rated them accordingly, and decided our top three, in order, were Redhook ESB, Redhook Blond, and Fat Tire's New Belgium.  Since the top two were the New Belgium and the Blond, we ordered pints of each and shared 'em.

As for the appetizers, we picked up an order of the fried chicken strips and Hawaiian poke stack.  Great choices (kinda hard to mess up chicken strips, though); the poke was a pretty good portion for an appetizer and was tasty!  

Both of the servers were outstanding in tending to our party of 14.  Very attentive, didn't miss a beat, and were great about reminding everyone to get their last orders in before happy hour ended.  Can't beat that!

If only the Yard House were in the DMV....."}
{"text":"3 of the 6 people in our party got sick after 
eating here."}
{"text":"Overpriced bar food if you ask me.

I ordered the Escalade margarita

a $13 dollar sandwich

the moo shu egg rolls.

Bill was 38 dollars, and they gave me a $1 surcharge for \"truffle fries,\" even though it lacked truffle, and parmesan.


Escalade Margarita was alright. Packed a punch, but that was expected. This was ten dollars.

The sandwich was the disaster of the night. Very little chicken, and guac, and a whole lot of bread. The fries were tiny cut which I absolutely abhor! I tasted very little truffle sauce, and no parmasan. Go to Gordan Ramsey's Burger to get the best truffle parmesan fries in las vegas!

Moo Shu Egg Rolls were the highlight of the night. Perfectly fried, and seasoned, and came garnished with a bed of cabbage, and some nest of crisps?

Verdict: Stick with the appetizers like The moo shu egg rolls and the artichoke dip, their salads, and skip the rest including their overpriced sandwich and drinks (unless its happy hour)"}
{"text":"The food here consistently SUCKS compared to literally every other Yard House I've been to. They skimp out so much. I ordered a California roll which was laced with 1000 slices of jalapeño and came out with a giant piece of it falling apart. The taste was absolutely nothing special and yet it's impeccable everywhere else. The poke nachos was a disaster. Absolutely dry and the fish tasted off. I also ordered lobster garlic noodles which was the SMALLEST serving I've ever seen with two tiny pieces of lobster, ZERO crab, and saturated with excess sauce. Jesus Christ. Way to skimp out on the lobster. And lastly, to finish off this absolute shit show, I ordered the mini trio sampler and they gave me MELTED, tiny scoops of ice cream. The service is also a joke. I'm sticking to the place on Town Square."}
{"text":"More great service and food.  I was dining with a teenager and a 5th grader.  The service was very attentive and helpful with the kids.  We all enjoyed our meals."}
{"text":"Yard House is the place that my fam goes 90% of the time when we go out to eat... My hubby and I love love love the Classic Cheeseburger! Hands down, no joke, the BEST hamburger either of us has ever had! Their appetizers are delish! We love the nachos (minus beans) but be careful not to ruin your dinner cuz they are humongo. They have a wide variety of foods, all delicious! We have never had bad service here either. Mmm,mmm,mmm good!"}
{"text":"Ok, where do I start? We usually go to the one at Desert Ridge, but we were close to this one at Westgate so we decided to go...cuz we love this place.... usually.

We started with the Calamari. Delish! Then the hubby and I ordered the Classic Cheeseburger because we believe this is the best cheeseburger we have ever had! I order mine medium and he orders his rare. We were so excited to get our food because we were so hungry. The food took a bit longer but knew it would be worth the wait. Well... food came and we dug in. The hubby got 2 bites into the burger before we realized it was cooked medium well. We decided to talk to the manager because the burger is about $12 and we wanted it cooked RIGHT. The 2nd one came out quickly and he bit into it... PEOPLE... THE DAMN BURGER WAS RAW. R-A-W! It was so flippin nasty. The hubby pulled the hamburger apart and it was, no joke, just raw ass hamburger!  I was about half way through my burger and after seeing THAT, I just wanted to puke. 

I will say, yardhouse (Desert Ridge) has never done us wrong, ever! We will go back but we might stick with Desert Ridge."}
{"text":"Great menu, good value.  Lots of beer on the menu.

Love the Mac N Cheese squared."}
{"text":"Great restaurant in the Linq outside strip with prices that were reasonable. We stopped by after a work trade show on a Tuesday. The atmosphere is nice. It's situated by the Linq high roller wheel. Nice outdoor space with a view. 

The place was packed and there was a wait of about 30 mins but we were able to marry up 4 chairs at the bar.  If you love beers and beers on tap as well as bottles this is your spot. Everything from wheat beers to pilsners to sours. The have it all and are knowledgeable enough to walk you through what you are looking for or give you a taste. Highly recommend. 

As far food. I ordered the ahi tuna with jasmine rice and asparagus. In a city that is so pricy and filled with food options it's nice to get s great meal at a price your used to. The tuna was cooked perfectly and the whole dish worked.  All in all after a few beers and dinner we were set. If we are ever back in this part of Vegas I would come back. Keep it up Yard House. 

Cheers
Justin"}
{"text":"Great beer selection with something for everyone. Kids menu hit the sweet spot with our 9 year old. Loved the street tacos. I had the vampire and the fish. Both excellent. Hubby had the vodka pasta with shrimp. He said it could use more spice but was very good. Great service and nice ambience with outdoor seating."}
{"text":"THIS REVIEW IS FOR THEIR PRE-GRAND OPENING TRIAL. ( The restaurant at the new Linq opens at the end of February! =))

WHO: For past present, and future Yardhouse lovers, this one's for you!

WHEN: The official Grand Opening is the end of February 2014, =)

WHERE: Located at the new Linq next to the new Quad Hotel & Casino.

WHAT: I am absolutely excited about this new Yardhouse! IT IS THE LARGEST YARDHOUSE WORLDWIDE, and am proud to say it is at home in LAS VEGAS! What makes it the largest? It is 2 stories and double your regular Yardhouse!

My brother from another set of parents invited us to try the place out before their actual grand opening, and I'm glad that he did! It is absolutely amazing in there, and they sure chose the right set of staff (Derrick & Rosie are the best!! Yup, I have my favorite servers already! =)) I loved the atmosphere and the customer service. I noticed everyone working as a team that night! So, kudos to teamwork!

As for the food, my brother and I ordered the Lobster, spinach & artichoke dip as an appetizer. For our entrees, I ordered the surf & turf burger, which never disappoints, and my brother had the seared ahi sandwich, which also didn't disappoint. In a nutshell, I've always loved the flavorful menu, so they can't go wrong there!

VIVA LAS VEGAS!!"}
{"text":"I have been here about 3 times in one month, but I never complained until now. My friends and I went there earlier in the day to have dinner, but when we were waiting for a table, there were about five hostess' waiting there and doing nothing. After about 5 mins we finally got seated. They knew we were there, but did nothing.

Other than that small incident, food is incredible! Id have to say the ribeye steak, macaroni and cheese are some of my many favorites. I've also tried a couple salads which were yummy as well!!"}
{"text":"HAPPY HOUR REVIEW:

Boy do we love our HHs down here in the SW!  Gone are the images of older septuagenerian and octogenarian hovering over a buffet line. In fact most HHs seem to have nice mixture of all ages, including those just getting off from work, unwinding before the start of the weekend. For us, it was just hitting the Yard House before the start of a movie at nearby Camelview Five. 

AMBIANCE/MOOD:
Yard House is sort of a hip sports bar, with some really good food and lots of HDTVs. Don't be put off that the corporate parent is Darden, the same folk who own Olive Garden and Red Lobster. You'll need to remember, they also own The Capital Grille, Longhorn, Eddie V's, so they know how to make a fun and tasty experience. 

The restaurant is located in the breeze way, near the two entrances of the Scottsdale Fashion Square Mall and the valet parking area.  We sat outside in the patio area on this visit, even though it was in the low 80s. No one was rushing to get inside.  Did I mention we were sitting in the breezeway? LOL

MENU:
Unlike some, there are no special HH menu items offered by Yard House. Their HH prices are 50% off all appetizers and pizzas. These are actually the same size appetizers you would normally receive after 6 pm, so we were impressed. If you look at the photos, you'll see some really nice, mouth watering dishes. 

When you are seated, you are given a huge menu that includes also everything you ever could imagine.  The steaks and burgers are really good and everything is reasonably priced. http://www.yardhouse.com/files/food_menu_20.pdf 

The star at Yard House though is their nearly one hundred beers on tap. There are Heffes, Lagers, Pale Ales, Wheats, dark beers and so much more. If you like beer, this is your place. Nice!

SERVICE:
Our server Jon was excellent. He was also teamed with an equally good supporting cast that all worked well together. Granted Yard House was half full, but everyone was on top of their game.  It was something we appreciated as we looked at our watch, thinking about the movie next door. 

FOOD:
On this visit we ordered the Chicken Nachos (photo) that normally goes for $11.45 and their yummy Margherita Pizza, which comes with roasted garlic on it for $11.65. Both were outstanding and made us wish we could come back later for some more. 

On that topic, Yard House has what I call reverse HH with a special menu from 10 pm to close. On it you'll find such nom nom items as Black Truffle Cheeseburgers, Chilaquiles, Pastrami Dogs and something they call Monte Cristo Pops. Gosh do I enjoy truffle oil on things!  LOL

Yard House's food selection is almost as large as their beer selection.  I would guess you would need at least a dozen or so visits to try everything and I haven't even gotten to their Snacks menu. 

PRICES:
As noted, Happy Hour is 50% off all appetizers and pizza. Our bill came in around $23 including taxes but before gratuities. Jon was great, so we were very generous. 

So Four Stars and \"yes, we're a Fan.\" 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Everything was ok.  Thats it, ok.  They have a nice outdoor patio that you can sit and enjoy bands that play outdoors at Westgate."}
{"text":"My daughter and I visited Town Square and decided to have some appetizers instead of a full meal. We ordered coconut shrimp, the pear and gorgonzola flatbread, and shrimp ceviche. Of the three, the ceviche was the best. The flat bread was VERY flat, and burnt on the bottom, but the flavors of pear and Gorgonzola work well together, so it was ok. My daughter liked the coconut shrimp but it was a bit over cooked as well. All in all, it was just ok. I might give it another chance for a full meal."}
{"text":"I gave it 5 stars because from start to finish it was an excellent experience. We ordered the lobster dip, SO GOOD and the egg rolls to start off with. Shared the lobster hamburger, to die for. Beers were delish, I believe I got the Blue Moon and some sort of pomegranate beer. YUM! For dessert we ordered the brownie and ice-cream YUM~ I will be back. Our waitress was AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Heard good things about this place. Met some friends for dinner.  We waited at the bar for about 20 minutes. Place was packed.  Service was very good.  Over 100 beers on tap. We had 4 appetizers. The jerk wings were very good. Coconut shrimp were only 3 in an order, but large shrimp.  Entrees were very good.  Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"This is a decent spot at Scottsdale Fashion Square. We typically sit at the bar and split the prime dip. With 130 beers on tap, you will be hard pressed not to find a drink that will satisfy your thirst. The bar service is good and the food comes out quickly. This restaurant is a quick and easy spot to grab dinner prior to a movie at Harkins or shopping in the mall."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant twice since we moved here a month ago. The selection of beers is great. They also have a few cocktails. They let you try the beer to get a feel for what you like before you spend money on something you won't drink. The menu has a wide selection. This place is great for everyone kids couples groups. They also have great option for vegetarians."}
{"text":"This place is big. There are a lot of seating space and  there is also a bar. 
However, I think the food items on the menu are more than enough. In fact, I found it a bit overwhelming. Portion size is a lot for one person as well. 
But, the staff is really fun. They make sure that you glass is constantly full & that you are enjoying. Even when the place is full, food gets out quickly. This is located right next to Harrahs. If this is not the place for you, there are other places near by but this place has some of the hospitable staff members. 
Prices are average. For about 8 people the bill came out to almost $100."}
{"text":"Lots of great beer on tap.  Stopped by for a late night happy hour this past weekend, Good crowd and I can imagine a good place to stop after an event at either the Jobing.com Arena or U of P Stadium if you don't feel like dealing with traffic right away."}
{"text":"Go for appetizers. We had the sliders and spinach dip with crispy flat bread. Will be back for dinner another time."}
{"text":"I've been to Yard House about 5 times, for lunch and dinner.  I gave 5 stars because not once have I had a bad experience.  The food is always good, the service is quick, and the atmosphere is not too loud, but not too quiet... it's just right."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch, though the service was great but the food was mediocre. 

I had the French Onion Soup with the Grilled Pastrami. While the Grilled Pastrami was well made, the soup was terrible. The bread underneath was not toasted so it largely soaked into the soup, which consisted of a relatively bland taste."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a light lunch on Father's Day. Our server Grant was helpful and attentive.  I explored a couple different beers that I've been unable to find elsewhere, and they were both good and reasonably priced.

Food was good although a bit on the expensive side (two street tacos plus rice and beans for $14?). Both my wife and daughter also liked their food.

We'll be back - it is the Yard House after all, where else are we going to find some of these beers on tap!"}
{"text":"Vegan Burger: 10/10
Calamari: 9/10
Chicken Tenders: 8/10
Pepper crusted gorgonzola burger: 4/10

Sister had the Vegan Burger and said it was the best shes ever had! Both times we came, waiters were ALWAYS on the refills. I was never waiting on them to get me my diet coke. FANTASTIC SERVICE! 5 stars, A+. This was one of the only places this Vegas trip were I gave the fatty 35% tip. Too bad I didn't win my WSOP event because if I did, my waiter would have had a huge payday."}
{"text":"Last time I was here with my friend. I ate a salad. Nothing different and then we ordered some kind of tuna with edamame. It was too much I was not able to finish it. So I took it home. Had a couple drinks and went home. The next day I woke up throwing up that tuna thing and when I opened the box they gave me at the restaurant, the food was literally black. I threw up the whole day. It was horrible. A really bad experience. Nice atmosphere, good drinks, but, I do not know about the food."}
{"text":"Our visit was cut short by a staff member that was rude more then once. (Darin) I'm pretty upset we don't have alot of alot time and he ruined it. I was very very cordial the whole time we were there a few times I felt like we were bothering him . We had another waiter that was so great Jared , the young lady I asked to get manager first went to Darin and told him we asked for manager then to manager then they both were kinda jerks when they came back out, Darin completely ignored us. He gave my husband 2 beers with floaty stuff in them and seems quite perterbed he had to get another beer for us, he told manager then waited for a while to get clear beer which he didn't not get to enjoy due to all of this, then we also did not finish our dinner we left. When I said hey ty for ruining our evening he smiled and said yw. No thanks! We eat here alot and it was so upsetting to deal with we wanted to sit and drink a few drinks eat some food and laugh ty Darin for ruining that! Just asking him what was in a mixed drink he just made was an issue , so dumb ."}
{"text":"Great place for a casual dinner
Could have a few more dessert items
But overall it's a great place"}
{"text":"How do they manage to keep all those beers in stock all the time? I've eaten there over 100 times and only had two \"not so good experiences.\" I like those odds.  Most of the time the staff is helpful and friendly. They seem to enjoy or at least \"more than tolerate\" being at work. The food is fantastic, the happy hour deal is a real bargain and they always have sports on the big screens. One more awesome aspect: the music kicks a$$. Southern Fried Chicken dinner is fantastic. The Korean short ribs are one of the best appetizers. I get \"no onions\" on my chicken nacho's and they are so thoughtful that they put the Guacamole on the side because it has onions in it, Attention to detail, that most places lack. A+. My two bad trips. 1: they matinee waitress was rude, probably just having a bad day, but don't take it out on me. 2: My Korean short ribs were real fatty and under cooked, I never NEVER send food back so I was S.O.L.  Overall I love this place."}
{"text":"Service was amazing. Friendly, fast, and kind. Food was tastes great. With this two winning combos how can you go wrong. The ambient works for casual or a more formal affair. Of course they had a house drink list if you are into that sort of thing."}
{"text":"Updated review of what used to be one of my favorite places around to get a burger.  The Menu seems different and the portion sizes were noticeably smaller.  The burger was charred around the outside and a couple of the beers seemed flat--Pineapple beer was bomb tho.  The Hawaiian burger was just not the same , I don't know who decided to change things up but it was the wrong move ."}
{"text":"Although it's your standard yard house, it's prices are definitely a plus in Vegas. You can come here for legit late night food and decent priced drinks...

Even if they don't have a happy hour menu like other their restaurants, they do have a Black Truffle Cheeseburger that is amazing when paired with the truffle friends all for about $10. Also, having to pay $7 for a shot of Hennessy is a diamond in the rough compared to these other clubs and bars that charge anywhere between $10-$17 for a shot. 

If you're in the mood for some normalcy in Vegas at a decent price, this yard house will hit the spot. Also the Linq alley is a very nice place to just stroll, shop, eat, and drink. Highly recommend coming to see the glamorous Ferris wheel here!!"}
{"text":"I am not usually a fan of chains but we came into this place because of convenience and left as fans!

All I can say is Wendy is amazing and if you have the opportunity to request a server, request her! She is super helpful, a firecracker, and she knows her food!

We really just asked Wendy for recommendations and ordered everything she said and we were not disappointed at all! We got the mac and cheese...yum! And the egg rolls...and they were all yummy!!

If you are looking for a fun drink, they did make a good Bloody Mary which helped me out tremendously that day!!!"}
{"text":"Great menu! Called ahead 20 minutes and got seated immediately upon arrival. Cool atmosphere and family friendy! The guacamole and burger were the best I've ever tasted! Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"We cam in at 5p and waited for 15-20 min for our table.   Guest everyone is coming here for the happy hours.  Decorations look nice and the hostesses are friendly.   We ordered the following items:
1. Mooshu eggrolls -  love this and strongly recommend to try it out
2. Calamari -  too oily,  which I'm having a heart burn now. 
3. Buffalo wings -  super spicy.   I guess I should have asked for light on sauce; still good to order
4. Penne with chicken -  it was kinda good.   Too much sauce even though my daughter requested for less sauce. 
5. Jambalaya with brown rice - can't feel the spice of Jambalaya except for excessive sauce. 
6. Lobster garlic noodles -  too salty.  If not salty then this will be a perfect dish. 
Anyhow, kid's pepperoni pizza was amaze. I like it more than my dish . 
I gave this four stars due to the taste of the food.   Overall,  still recommend people to eat here."}
{"text":"This place is just fun. Wide selection of food, and an even wider selection of beers.

Came here after a movie and it was a perfect place to just chill and have a beer. I ordered the pepper crusted gorgonzola burger. The marsala mushrooms and bleu cheese went really well with the arugula. A slight twist on your typical bleu cheese mushroom burger but the change actually means something instead of just having fancier ingredients for fanciness's sake. The patty was perfectly medium rare, tender and juicy. YUM. The beef was gamey, almost like buffalo, but I liked the change of pace. However, I do wish the fries were cut thicker though.

Almost forgot, they had perfectly fried onion rings! Excellent texture, crunch, and flavor. Plus they come out on a tower, kinda like those kiddie ring tosses. Good stuff.

Fun, delicious food, and delicious beer. Will eagerly come back!"}
{"text":"You just can't go wrong with their happy hour menu! $6 wings, $7 delicious crab cakes, and an amazing \"unique\" California roll!"}
{"text":"This gem has the BEST food for a chain restaurant! Everything is perfectly seasoned and beyond delicious; my favorites are the clam chowder & mac & cheese.  The staff is extremely friendly, with the exception of one manager who has a nasty and rude attitude about everything (reason for 4 stars instead of 5).  Other than that particular manager, Yard House is a fantastic place to drink, eat, & have a good time!"}
{"text":"We drove out from Lakewood specifically to try this restaurant because of the great reviews. Our server was great and our appetizer (queso w/bacon chorizo) came out fast. It was delicious, but we had to ask twice for more tortillas (only came with a few???).

After over 45 minutes passed, we asked about our entrées...apparently our ticket was lost. Our food (wife had taco combo, I had lobster garlic noodles) finally came out 30 minutes later. The kitchen manager came over and told us they were taking them off off the bill. 

Problem is: Even after waiting SO LONG my pasta was cold and saturated in sesame oil w/no hint of garlic. My wife's tacos were also cold and had very little actual meat. We would've rather paid for hot fresh, well prepared food. 

Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. We try something different off the menu every time and have never been disappointed. Sooo yummy, good sized portions also. I'm not a huge drinker, so their mixed drinks didn't really impress me too much, but my husband loves the beers and the huge yard long glass you can order."}
{"text":"We requested a certain table. Waited for that table. We were told we would have that table. We were seated at a different table. We requested managers attention. Manager blamed it on the \"18 and 19 year olds at the front\". We were then told that we could wait again for that table. We waited and the table was given to another party. A manager is accountable and should take responsibility. She seemed to be slightly incoherent. I would rate this location 0 stars or negative stars if yelp allowed. =) BUT, Tim, our server was exceptional! Thank you Tim for the great service!"}
{"text":"Dirtwolf IPA on tap owowooooh! Tuna roll fabulous! Gardein wings with jerk sauce bombness! Along with the other sauces Firecracker is crackin. Truffle fries bombtastic! Bartender was smooth, easy going and manners were up top. Thank you to all staff for cleanliness and friendliness of establishment."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place after searching the strip for a place to eat with fair variety and reasonable prices (for the area). Yard house exceeded expectations. Complete with an extensive beer menu and in-house pairings crafted specially for the menu, I could recommend this place on drinks alone. The lamb burger was flavorful and cooked to our requested temperature. The pizza stood out for its robust sauce and quality toppings.

Even though I did not realize this was a chain restaurant upon first visit, I would certainly visit again."}
{"text":"Waited 20 min at the bar just to get a beer. The bartenders ignore the fuck out of you and then ask for ID's when we're clearly over the drinking age. Flattery? I think not. Fuck this place. We were standing next to the hostess station and they ignored us too. Wtf. Stay diligent Scottsdale you're doing a great job!  fuck you."}
{"text":"The  burgers are wonderful! we went to YH a few times, Love the food !  Server named \" Farren\", is so sweet and so professional ! The manager Anthony was really nice too. we let him know we really enjoyed our dining experience a previous visit. I am happy that they have a very nice kids meal menu as well and offer side dishes like fruit and veggies instead of just frenchfries. I am eating low carb, and the servers are so accomodating and helpful with low carb choices. I can't wait to visit again , my husband says they have the best wings he's ever had."}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly. I got a martini that had ice cubes in it and upon looking at the bartender making another discovered that this was because they don't use a strainer. Someone at my table ordered an ahi tuna salad that was very large and according to him delicous. I ordered the burger. The server asked how I wanted it cooked so I requested pink. Different places call a pink burger different things, so I went with that. He stated that pink was medium, so I ordered that. The burger that came out had a toothpick in it that said medium, but it was very, very well done. It actually tasted burnt. So if you order a burger, i would suggest asking for it undercooked to your specifications. The server was very nice though."}
{"text":"Yard House is a great alternative to a traditional sports bar. I happened to be there on the night of St. Patrick's day, and the atmosphere was super fun, especially because of the moveable glass wall panels that opened up the restaurant allowing everyone inside to feel like they were a part of the party happening outside! Our server, Rachel, was great - as was the food. According to the meat eaters in my party, the turkey burgers were out of this world. As a vegetarian foodie myself, I was pleased with the number of vegetarian friendly options. With the super extensive food and drink menus, Yard House seemed like a place that would have an option to please every palate - although if you like lots of different types of food, all the options can be overwhelming, so I would recommend checking out the menu online first to start narrowing down all the choices!"}
{"text":"If I could have given negative stars I would have. HORRIBLE SERVICE. We had a party of 12 and the restaurant  was not busy. We had 2 servers and neither one was friendly and we continuously had to ask for basic things such as drink refills. Service was ridiculously slow. Had to send 2 orders of Truffle Fries back because  they were overcooked. You know its bad when the manager takes care of the entire tab, especially for a 12 person party. Needless to say, I will stick to the location in Glendale."}
{"text":"Lmao. It's funny when a place like this gets 4 star average from 300+ people. It just goes to show what's wrong with most people. There's nothing bad about the place, but nothing that great either"}
{"text":"My family went to this restaurant and I wish we hadn't. It's AZ Restaurant week and they had a deal going for an appetizer, entree and dessert. I ordered the poke nachos and they were good. Then I ordered the Vodka shrimp pasta based on a recommendation from the waitress and when it came out with those thin noodles, I knew it wouldn't be good. I tried it and sure enough it was gross. The shrimp were tiny and the entire dish lacked flavor even the salt, pepper and parm. cheese didn't help. Then I sent it back and ordered the salmon and mashed potatoes. It was equally bland and disgusting. Even the little mini chocolate souffle wasn't good. :( I'm a glutton for anything chocolate and I didn't even finish it. We hadn't been to this place in about four years but it's fallen off big time. The manager was nice and I didn't pay for the entree. My husband is a rib-eye addict and he said his tasted like it was previously frozen. My daughter's pizza looked like Digornio. The prices are way too high for it to taste that bad. Overall, we wasted so much time and money there that we won't be back."}
{"text":"Yard house is super consistent, I go as a vegetarian for their gardein chicken which is a tofu chicken and it is one of the most delicious things in the entire world. Beer selections are amazing, environment is amazing"}
{"text":"I loved this place as soon as I walked in. The atmosphere, service and food are excellent. We were a group of 4 and we were sitting inside then we decided to go to the patio. The server was very nice and got a table for us very fast. The drinks are excellent. The food very fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"I have tried this place twice and was underwhelmed both times. The atmosphere is very cold and loud, lacks any ambiance. The food is overpriced and underseasoned. I was excited to try the gardein options but it was mushy and bland. I would have been better off with Morningstar chick'n from giant eagle. I am hoping I will not be back."}
{"text":"Happy hour specials are great. Our table ordered original sliders, margarita pizza, chicken tenders, onion ring stacked, lamb burger, & buttered noodles  kid's plate.
Onion rings were outstanding.
Lamb burger, cooked medium as ordered, was delicious. Truffle fries were kinda oily.
Restaurant was kind of loud & hard to hold a conversation.
 Will return though to explore more of expansive menu of food & beverages
Service was good. And even though kids plate didn't come out with rest of food, it didn't take long after to rectify."}
{"text":"Love their pasta here and the Mac in cheese is my favorite. I could live off their food. And even the wait time isn't too bad when they are busy. Love coming here with friends for dinner and drinks."}
{"text":"First time here! The lobster pasta literally made me roll my eyes back and say, \"OMG!\" The Man ordered a ribeye; he said it was good but my pasta was better.

Our waiter, Pablo, was amazing. The Man got a beer sampler and Pablo was fantastic at recommending beers. 

Bathrooms: clean! As they should be!"}
{"text":"The service is great for how packed it is.  The server Justin was amazing.  Helped us decide what to get and everything was delicious.  If you feel like good food and good service come see him!!!!"}
{"text":"Always a good day when I'm at Yardhouse! The service was friendly and fast and as per my usual, I ordered the hyped up Mac n cheese dish with all the fixings!  It never lets me down and this time was no exception. 
I also order the Kale Caesar salad which was equally delicious.  Both of those dishes are easily separated to split with friends if you are stopping by for a light meal.  

The beers on tap can't really be matched and if you're too indecisive like me, just order a flight and try several!  This location has ample seating and even though the place was packed, we did not have any issues getting service.  This is a great overall spot to enjoy a lazy afternoon with the water fountain nearby for kids to play and shops to walk around, as well as other eateries and places for dessert.  As well as with the movie theatre nearby you could just stay all day!"}
{"text":"Well, what can I say. I'm not sure why I gave it 4 stars, I guess it's because it's one of the few places that has pretty much all the beer that I like to drink. The food is ok, the fish is not as fresh as I like but still good. Must go for the BEER!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"*** High Price Warning ***
BJ's Brewhouse with a 50 percent premium. Two entree salads, one appetizer, a beer ($6.5), and a cocktail ($7), with tip, $70! Yikes! Nothing special here. Go if you're desperate, which I was. Phoenix restaurants close early! My first choice shut at 830 PM, and my second at 9 PM. My friend was working until 8 PM; so we needed some late dining. Saving the Yard House was decent, friendly service and food, albeit uninspired and rich, that was fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"I love this place to watch a game and get good food. There are TVs everywhere and every table has a great view. Service was excellent. He was so attentive my glass was never empty. I love the tuna salad. It was perfectly cooked with a ton of flavor.  My son loved the grilled chicken and mashed potatoes. The potatoes were real and not instant and are  full of buttery goodness."}
{"text":"Great location and atmosphere.  Can't go wrong with the black n tan and chicken nachos.  The service was great and the music was quality."}
{"text":"The service was great and the staff was friendly. I ordered the lettuce wraps with mushrooms and it was overall tasty but a little too salty. Despite this, I would order it again. My friend was interested in trying the blueberry beer, so our waitress offered to give her a sampler of the beer to try. If you tend to get cold easily, I'd suggest bringing a lightweight jacket or coat"}
{"text":"Great food & great drinks! I had the shrimp pasta with vodka sauce and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"My husband and I checked in only to wait for a table. We went to the bar while we waited for a table for dinner. I ordered a bottle beer. After 10 minutes two separate waitresses advised me I needed to leave as I did not order my drink from them. Problem is I ordered my drink from the bar from mike. Both waitresses got attitude and all but asked us to leave. An interracial couple was not welcome and our integrity was challenged by two white waitresses. I have never felt so unwelcome as I did at yard house tonight. Will never go back 
The manager tried to offer a free app but the damage was done"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I were greeted & treated as soon as we walked in. She said the wait was about 5-10 minutes and she wasn't lying. Sat outside because it's the first day of spring and our server Travis was very quick, efficient & caring. Foods great , they have lots of choices and great prices. I didn't order anything to drink but they had a wide variety of alcoholic beverages that sounded delicious ! Until next time Yard House !"}
{"text":"Derek the host was excellent in general, especially on the phone. You know when you call people and they just have this presence? Well, he's got it. And very informative. You've got an amazing host (and person) in him. 

George was checking around for us for a booth and got one immediately after I said I just got off work. GOOD LOOKING OUT, BUDDY. I appreciate that kind of attention to detail. 

Dallas was truly one of a kind. A server that feels like a friend, not someone trying to get their average check sale up. She really helped us with the menu and me being a pain figuring out this newly appointed gluten free vegan diet. Woof. Good luck to me."}
{"text":"I have never been to the Yard House. I liked the outdoor patio. Our server was so great. And the grilled cheese was perfect."}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant. It was nine of us and our orders weren't small ones either. Our waiter was very nice and attentive! We went during lunch hour so it wasn't too busy. The food was delicious and I can't wait to go back again!


************************************************************************************************
Okay went to the Yard House at Red Rock Casino and Hotel and just like the one by the strip it was AMAZING!!!!! This time we had a party well over 20 people and somehow our waiter was able to take all of our order, bring our drinks and food out in a timely manner, AND separate our checks accordingly. I've never had service like that before. I would definitely recommend both locations."}
{"text":"Ok, I went back the next day and the very bartender who was so sullen the day before took me so completely by surprise with her insight into my emotional state of affairs that I almost gasped aloud. 

I love yard house. They're basically accommodating of vegans. They once gave me a piece of chicken among my veggie pieces and no less than three managers came over to apologize. Good on them. 

I wish the bartenders had ten percent more personality on average because I'm an extreme extrovert but I suspect the general public who they're meant to entertain are perfectly satisfied by their level of engagement. 

Here's the deal, it's the best of the corporatey type places. Outstanding beer selection, stuff for veggies and vegans, at least in theory, and they want an excellent customer experience as evidenced by the two emails I received about my last review. Long live Yard House!"}
{"text":"Came here kinda drunk for beers before last call.

Pros:
Large and spacious.
A lot of beers on tap, great selection.

Cons: 
Was pick pocketed whilst sitting at the bar so be careful!!"}
{"text":"Basically an over priced BJ's restaurant. Decent portions but pricey. Unfortunately both me and my husband got food poisoning from here, and we didn't order the same thing. I had the burger and he had the chicken. I had the souffle cake which was dry/overcooked and husband had mint brownie that was good.Needless to say we won't take the risk of getting sick again."}
{"text":"Our food came very quickly as well as our drinks. The atmosphere of the restaurant was beautiful, and the servers were very friendly. Outstanding food and service! I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"On a last minute whim, took a quick trip to Vegas.  Avoiding the overpriced and often horrible service downtown hotel eats, I took a trip South of the city to Town Square Shopping Center.  Here, amongst may outlet stores, I found Yard House.  With the incredible beer selection, this is my kind of place.  Featuring inside and patio dining, I opted for the quicker option of inside inside dining.  Considering I like a more quiet atmosphere, I should have taken the patio dining instead.  Inside was very noisy, and it got worse the more people piled in.  It seems whoever built Yard House went with the industrial look but left out any soundproofing or noise control.  Yard House has over 150 beers to choose from, and I found an old favorite from my time in Germany; Kronenbourg 1664.  The appetizer-size of Guacamole and chips worked well for two but won't feed more.  I chose the Parmesan Crusted Pork Loin.  When it arrived, it was a BIG portion of two chops over sweet potato mash with a healthy side of asparagus.  Now THIS was DAMN GOOD!  The sweet potato \"mashed\" was a great counter to the savory chops.  Breading on the chops was light but covered well.  Over top, chefs drizzled a cherry sauce.  The asparagus was boiled just right, still crisp yet tender.  For an entree just over $20, I felt is was a great deal.  If the inside noise level wasn't so overbearing, I might have stuck around for a second or third beer.  I left with a tab just over $36 and satisfied, as it was a great dinner and more affordable than anything downtown."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, but I didn't expect any less. My son had the kids spaghetti and meatballs and it's his new favorite above anywhere else. HOWEVER, the staff was rude rude RUDE. I was going to take my son to the movies inside Red Rock Casino, and had placed a to-go order from Yard House so we could grab our food and make it over to the movies at the other side of the casino. We were out running errands when I placed my order over the phone, and by the time we arrived I realized we had plenty of time to sit down and eat. This apparently was WAY too complicated a request for A) the girl at the first counter B) the lady server who was going to grab our order and B) another chick who brought us waters. I walked in and said, \"Hey, I placed a to-go order but we actually have more time now, I was hoping we could be seated.\" All I got was weird confused looks in response like no one could understand what I was saying. So I said again, \"We just have more time than I thought we would, can we have our to-go order at a table?\" The counter girl looked as though I had kissed her boyfriend. I'm not sure what all the confusion and disgust was about, but I couldn't get an actual answer until after other customers had already walked up and picked up their to-go order, so I asked again and then was told, \"YEAH we're getting you a table.\" Um.... okay. Thanks? 
Then they had a fit over whether or not we needed our food plated. No, I said, that's okay, we're still going to head over to the movies and want the to-go boxes. Then there was a bunch of confusion about our drinks. A woman dropped off glasses of water, to which I said (softly, as I was already afraid of getting a pissed off response), \"We had actually ordered sodas with our food.\" And she just shook her head and said, \"I don't know anything about that.\" And walked away. So then the other woman who had seated us passed by, and I asked about the sodas (because our food had already been brought over, but not the drinks, so I was wondering if they'd been forgotten) to which she replied, \"Yes, I know you had drinks. We are bringing them.\" It was a good 5-10 minutes between getting the food and getting the sodas so I don't think it was weird of me to ask about them. 
My grilled cheese and tomato soup was phenomenal. Just wish I could say the same about the restaurant staff. For the record, this is maybe the first (possibly second) YELP review I've ever written, because I don't usually bother. But this experience was enough to make me never go back. Oh! And while we were there, I jumped onto a group text with my 5 best friends and told them what a shit show it was, 2 of them wrote back to say they had similar experiences at this location. Great establishment, tastey food, good beer and not too shabby prices........... SHITTY staff."}
{"text":"I am pretty picky when it comes to service. Our waitress was so amazing that I told her boss when he came over to see how everything was. He said they wanted to make her a trainer. She knew the ingredients to the sauce that came with the egg rolls. I ordered the pork with cherry, bourbon, and shallot sauce. The sweet potato mash that came with it had a hint of cinnamon. It was really delicious. I really wish I took down her name. But I'm sure they know who I'm talking about. She even even gave us to go cups for the rest of our drinks and never missed refilling them. Our waitress did not forget one single thing! I know being a server is tough sometimes, but she made it look so easy! She was also super nice and chatted with us!"}
{"text":"Delicious food made with great quality! Their prices are a bit on a pricier end and the food portions are enough for one person.

Our server was nice but he kind of didn't know which were sour beers or what kind of sour beers they had. I think of this place as up scaled bar food/ restaurant as they sell wings but also platters and meals"}
{"text":"This was not my first trip to Yardhouse's happy hour by any means and I'd say that each visit is quite similar (star-wise). It's just that when I get 3 drinks in me, the experience gets ramped up a bit, the food tastes better, and I forget how mediocre everything was. 

My husband and I caught the Happy Hour last night and our server Cristian was really nice and helpful with the menu selection. My husband asked him what a really strong, decent tasting beer was and upon recommendation, he ended up choosing the North Coast PranQster. It was unfortunately a bit sweet for his taste buds and then we saw Stone Arrogant Bastard Ale and wondered why our server didn't recommend that because we knew the reputation of Bastard beers.

So my husband downed his goblet and ordered the Bastard Ale. We got it and realized exactly why he didn't recommend it. It tasted like absolute crap! On a scale of disgusting brews, $1.25 Earthquake High Gravity Lager from a gas station with 12% alcohol content, comes in at a 10 for the most disgusting beer on the planet. Now, this Bastard Ale, even at happy hour prices, is 4 times the cost and a gnarly 9.5 on the disgusting beer-o'-meter. Moral of the story: listen to your server about beer recommendations; they seriously know their stuff. 

Onto the food! We ordered gardin(soy) chicken wings with buffalo sauce, chicken nachos, spicy Thai chicken pizza, and seared ahi sashimi. We opted for the gardin because I wanted to boost my soy intake for the day. They were battered perfectly and tasted pretty much like chicken. As they cooled, the tofu side came out more, but I didn't care because I love tofu anyway. The sauce is a really delicious typical buffalo sauce and the ranch was tasty. The chicken nachos were HUGE. The plate had to be close to 2 ft long and it was covered in nachos with all the goods: pico, sour cream, pinto beans, guacamole, cheese, salsa, and chicken. My only complaint about this dish was the chicken. They were pretty large strips and not many of them, which wasn't a bad thing because they were definitely on the chewy side.

The seared ahi was alright. I've always loved the sauce on that dish. I can't explain it other than being spicy, refreshing, and a perfect complement to raw fish. However, I found the fish to have some fat or tissue which was hard to cut through and seemed of a lesser standard than what you would find at a sushi joint. Lastly, the spicy Thai chicken pizza. We had to send it back for a different pizza. It was really salty because of the peanut sauce plus all the salty toppings made it salt overload. We replaced it with a pepperoni mushroom which is pretty fail-proof and it was the typical mediocre Yard House pizza with soggy center and all. 

You know those places that you go to once every 3 months because they have a great environment and service so you forget about how mediocre the food is? I think Yard House is one of those places if you plan on being sober. However, it is excellent for beer and vegetarians!"}
{"text":"While I love Yard House, I can't afford to go here when it's not happy hour.  They do have good happy hour specials, but this location doesn't have a reverse happy hour (after 10pm) on weekends, while the one in Scottsdale does.  Very deceiving when you expect both to have it!  The beer selection is amazing, but appetizers are way over-priced unless you are there during happy hour."}
{"text":"Happy Hour Mon-Fri 3-6 and Sun-Wed 10-Close

Happy hour specials are $2 off all beer, wine & cocktails and half off select apps

I love Yard House happy hour.  Many cocktails and appetizers to choose from.  Tons of beers on tap too if that is your thing.  Food and drink is always on point.  Price is right and portions are large.  My favorites are chicken nachos, poke nachos, buffalo wings, pizza.  Ok.  I pretty much like the whole happy hour menu.  I usually sit at the bar and watch whatever game happens to be on.  Service has been good.  They do get busy but make sure to check on you."}
{"text":"We had a great visit to the Yardhouse last week.  While getting in some much need space from the kids we decided to spend our date night at the Red Rock Casino.  We have been to other location's with mixed experiences in the past.  This night we decided to sit out side on the patio with the misters and it was just the right temp.  

I selected the Jambalaya and she had the Gardein Chicken Sandwich.  Throughout the entire meal I was comparing the recipe to my mother's home made Jambalaya and at first I was a little disappointed.  Once the heat started kicking up and chunk's of the chicken and sausage and craw fish started blending in my mouth my thoughts changed.  This recipe was fairly respectable as far as Jambalaya's are concerned.  Nothing beats momma's home cooking but a very good dish that I would order again.  

The Gardein (Faux) Chicken sandwich was pretty decent as well.  These Gardein products really try to mimic a meaty texture with vegan or veggie lover in mind.  I felt the texture was fairly chewy and was juicy like a real breast of chicken.  The Avocado on this sandwich was refreshing and made it perfect flavor combo on a hot summer night.   The YardHouse is a great place to try if you have a veggie lover in your group because they have something for everyone and an excellent beer selection as well."}
{"text":"I'm being generous with this review, only because my servers were extremely nice.  My third visit to this particular restaurant, I should have learned after my 2nd visit.  The food is so-so depending on what you order.  The service is so slow I could have driven home and cooked it myself.  It takes forever to get a drink and the music is so loud you can't hear each other.  Like I said the servers are friendly and nice.  My second visit I ordered a pastrami sandwich, it was by far the worst sandwich I've ever tried to eat. I sent it back and ordered something else which of course took another 1/2 hour. They definitely need to up their game.  Sorry, there are much better places to eat on the strip. M"}
{"text":"Loud, dark and expensive.  Enjoyed my snakebite (a pear ale and lager mix).  My husband's beer was flat."}
{"text":"I love this place. The happy hr is great good music ,great srevice. And the food is so yummy. Thank you all."}
{"text":"Consistent good food, service and atmosphere. 
My only gripe would be is that there is a corporate feeling about it.  Seems like there are rules in place for staff to follow and they are force to follow them whether it makes sense or not.
Example 1:  they carded my friends dad, who is 82 years old. \"Sorry, we card everyone\" they said. 
Example 2: we wanted the sound for one of the games. \"Sorry, we only put the sound on Monday Night games\""}
{"text":"We have gone twice in last month at Desert Ridge once on Sunday and once at 5pm during happy hour!  Both times food was very good.  Pricey at regular times but happy hour the food is very well priced for the items we got.  You are almost always guaranteed great service, good food, with 150 beer selection. This time I had the Poke Nachos are excellent for $8 at happy hour price along with the Sashimi was $8 and was excellent! We also had the Ahi Tuna sandwich the time before and it was fantastic too!  They also have some very good, burgers and tacos which are excellent.  We had the Crab cakes which I thought was very good, even though I would have liked a remoulade sauce instead of current way they serve this dish. The other time we also had the Rueben which was fantastic too with special pickles and a very nicely smoked pastrami/corned beef meat on the sandwich.  Sit at bar for fast service at all times!"}
{"text":"Great food, service and beer....great job and I loved this place!   Waiter staff knows how to spoil you....totally attentive, food is higher quality bar food.  We got the chicken Thai pizza and quest dip.   Beer...how about the world of beers at your finger tips"}
{"text":"I normally don't do this..  But... Tim is the most awesome waiter I've had in years. I normally have bad luck with my service when I go to restaurants, but this dude Tim broke my streak and I'm not mad. He was attentive to our needs and on point with results. 

If I wasn't just visiting he'd be the only person allowed to wait on me."}
{"text":"We went in here looking for a late night snack - just fries or something. From the front entrance, it looked dark and dead almost. Once we walked in the back it was packed and bustling.  It has an industrial pub feel  I am not sure what I mean by that - dark with wooden booths and pipe etc  I was VERY HAPPY to see that they had a whole section of the menu with Gardein products - vegetarian.  Things like wings, sandwiches, a whole bunch of things made with the veggie product.  It was great. 
We ordered the veggie \"wings\" and fries. The fries were very average - but the gardein wings were good - firecracker sauce - VERY spicy though.. I paid for it the next morning  ( if you know what I mean).  
The place was staffed with young folks, and our waiter was enthusiastic and friendly although not really too polished, but all in all his service was ok. 
I was encouraged to see so many veggie products on the menu - and I would go back when in Vegas just for this."}
{"text":"Great location and good prices. I had a grilled chicken avocado sandwich and my fiancé had the chicken rice bowl. Both were good but there could have been more chicken in the rice bowl. We also had the sweet potato fries as an appetizer and they came with good dipping sauce. They have happy hour during the week from 3-6 pm. Good place to check out!"}
{"text":"LOVE the Kung Pao Calamari! Definitely one of those craveable foods!"}
{"text":"Average fare with truly asinine bar rules. Wanna buy a friend a drink? They have to be there with you to prove age.  Want something common? Out of it 50% of the time. Sitting at the bar? Good luck with the service.

Service is normally better at tables, unless it's really jam packed with tourists.

Wanna be treated like bros trying to get their underage friends drunk? This is the place for you, otherwise, go to any other place nearby.

People at work always insist on comIng here for functions, which is the only reason I'm here. I really loathe this place. Go downtown, there are far better places to drink and a way more genuine and interesting environment."}
{"text":"I really like this place. a good spot for beer drinkers. Food is always good and it's a nice place. Always recommended."}
{"text":"I love the beers, I love the service, I love racer 5 ipa by bear republic on tap and I love the ahi crunch salad. Tonight there was a tiny piece of chicken in my salad so the manager comped my meal. I really didn't care but they went above and beyond to take care of me. The really know customer service, quality beers and quality service. Amanda and her manager are awesome!"}
{"text":"Verdict: Great Happy Hour, but don't come specifically for the food. 

Come here during Happy Hour with a group of friends and/or family, grab a brewski and some well drinks and it's a guaranteed good time! 

Other than that--food is decent, more salty than not and comes out a little slow. 

In my opinion:
DO - Get a little tipsy and stumble your way over to one of the other food joints located around Town Square. 
NOT - Eat here, if you can help it."}
{"text":"My husband and I don't live far from here and had never managed to check it out. So we finally had lunch here recently. The waitress was quite friendly but extremely busy. The beer selection could provide you with something new each trip for a year, unless you are drinking to wear out your kidneys. In addition to having a huge selection (food and beer), they offer varieties that you've likely never tried AND local brews.

Unfortunately, I don't drink beer. But my better half indulged in a Belgian beer that pleased him. My salad was nothing to get excited about, but his burger was cooked perfectly. The atmosphere is decent. It is a spacious place with TVs. I will say that it is noisy, so this is not an intimate place to visit. I felt like it was more in the vein of business professionals having lunches to write off and guys gathering to drink and watch sports. I didn't love it, but I didn't hate it. Yet I'd recommend it to those of you who are beer connoisseurs. Also, the prices are decent during Happy Hour, so that might be your best bet."}
{"text":"Service was good. Waiter Paul was very accomodating. Food was hit or miss. We showed up for happy hour. The vampire taco was extremely dry and had an odd flavor. I couldn't take more than one bite of the margherita pizza, it was bad. Real bad. But everything else was great. The sliders, queso dip was my favorite. I also ordered the chicken nachos and that was delicious, my only complaint was the shredded chicken was served as balls of chicken. I had to keep shredding it so I wasn't eating huge chunks."}
{"text":"If you are a beer lover, the selection is great.    Lots of great small microbrews from all over.  The \"yard\" glass is kind of dumb and I would think it would keep the beer from staying cold.  I would have liked to see more of the ultra premium belgian ales on the menu.  Now for the food.  Pretty boring.  I had the bbq chicken salad.  The dressing lacked flavor.  The chicken seemed like boiled shredded chicken and had little flavor."}
{"text":"Went with a decent sized group to the Yard House and was able to try out a lot of different menu items.  For appetizers we had the chicken nachos, onion rings, and the crab dip.  The onion rings were a bit limp/soggy but tasted alright, the crab dip was quite delicious with the pita however they give you way more bread than dip, and the nachos were pretty spot on and quite tasty.  

I ended up also getting their wings as my meal, the traditional wing flavor is delicious, I also tried the other sauces, the Jerk sauce was flavorful and I'd certainly consider getting that at some point, the Hot sauce that they have in my opinion doesn't have that great of a taste to it and is maybe a 2-3/10 on spicy (note that I usually consumer very spicy dishes so this maybe rather hot for yourself).

Around the table a few people ordered the chicken rice bowls which all seemed to really enjoy and another got the fish and chips.  The fish and chips had a lot of pieces which is a plus, however the overall flavor was considered 'okay'.  This venue has an ungodly large selection for beers and other drinks if that's your thing, but it was noted they did not have flights.  Our service was a bit lacking on keeping drinks refilled and bringing things to the group in a timely manner otherwise I'd say this would be deserving of a fourth star.  Their menu is quite diverse and is sure to have something for everyone in the group so there's no need to worry about anyone lacking choices."}
{"text":"Ordered the Miso glazed sea bass. The Rice was hard as rocks. The manger Jessica was great, she comped my bill for the Sea bass. The waitress was not that great. She knew that my rice was hard before I even informed her about it. I asked her to bring me a new order of rice. After waiting for 20 minutes for new rice I called her over to the table and she said that it was still not ready. I told her not to worry about it and to just bring me the check. She then looked at me and said I did not charge you for the cup of tomato soup. Like she was doing me a favor. I didn't ask for the soup to begin with you offered it to me because my rice was hard. I usually don't complain about the food I order but this time I felt I had to say something because I felt so disrespected. I asked the manager not to charge me for the rice sine it was not edible and she comped the Sea bass. I gave three stars because I eat here all the time and don't want to give just one star because of this one bad deal out of many visits. I will eat here again."}

The French onion & clam chowder soup are fantastic. 
The menu has a large selection of items & clean restaurant A+"}
{"text":"Yard House is one of my favorite spots for happy hour - the food is delicious and oh so affordable, and the service is always friendly. I frequent the Chino Hills location when visiting my sister, and the Marina del Rey location is a recent favorite due to their proximity to my job. On my recent trip to Las Vegas, I got to check out this location, which is in the new Linq complex on the strip. I didn't get to eat at this location, but we visited the walk-up bar our first night in town (7/1/14) to try what has become my favorite Vegas drink: FROZEN. MOSCOW. MULE. I don't usually go for frozen drinks and was going to order mine on the rocks, but watched the bartender make one for the folks ahead of us in line. It looked so good and it was about 100 degrees at 10 pm so I decided to go for it. Oh my....the best $10.50 plus tip I spent in Vegas! So good that my sister and I returned to the Linq our second night in town (7/2/14) specifically for this drink! I wish I could remember the names of the bartenders because they were both awesome - there was a male bartender 7/1 and a female bartender 7/2. 

This was a short trip, if we didn't return home yesterday we would have returned for a third night. It was THAT good, and I'm not even a big drinker."}
{"text":"I really liked the food here.  Being the only vegetarian in a group of people looking for a decent place to eat on a Friday night can leave you feeling a little guilty (or if the people you're with are just jerks, can really make you feel like crap), so finding a place that offers great food in addition to great vegetarian food was a win.  Oh, yeah, the their bar is pretty stellar (try the raspberry cider).  Only one person in our group actually ended up ordering anything with meat in it, as their vegetarian menu was just too appealing.  I was happy to see so many options, but a little bummed that they seemed to rely on Gardein products (which I love, don't get me wrong, it'd just be nice to see some variety, or even some creativity from restaurants when it comes to meat \"alternatives\").  I went with the Orange Peel 'Chicken' with a tomato soup to start, my boyfriend got the Sliders, and our table mates ordered a rather awesome looking salad with French Onion Soup and some tacos, respectively.  Everything was delicious, and I look forward to visiting again.

The only real downside here, for me anyway, was how crowded the restaurant was (I know, my bad for going on a Friday night), and because of the volume of people, the volume on the noise seemed to be increased, too.  We were lucky to be in a corner away from most of the hubbub, but it was still rather unpleasant.  If they could figure out a way to reduce the noise (not too hard to do, actually), rework the dining area so it allows for more fluid movement with out the congestion, and maybe be a little closer (clearly this last bit is not a 'must'), they would easily get 5 stars from me."}
{"text":"Really good place. Come here every time.fast paced service and the amount of different beer is awesome."}
{"text":"Great selection of beer, I like craft beers and has several different kinds of IPA's! Dinner was great we had Mac and Cheese and pastrami Benedict burger and it was delicious as well!"}
{"text":"Went in the afternoon on a Sunday and sat at the bar. Our bartender, Josh, was really attentive and took great care of us. The beers were all good and the food servings were quite large. A good find, just off the strip."}
{"text":"Oh yeah, this place. I've actually been here before, not this one in particular but the one in Miami Beach on a blistering hot day. By myself even and only because I mistook it for Yardbird where all the cool people like Anthony Bourdain and Questlove eat fried chicken. Nope, Yard House is not where the cool people eat either in Miami Beach or Glendale. How would I know? Because I was eating there, and I was with colleagues for a work dinner, mostly male colleagues who probably thought a sports bar would make a good, non-threatening bonding environment. There were other tables like ours. Bonding. Talking shop. Asking me about sports teams I don't know and then having to fake a response of interest.

There are apparently 66 Yard Houses across the country. It feels like that kind of place, packaged with way too many options on the menu for an indecisive crew. Of course, that meant huge platters of finger-food appetizers to tie us over like the $12.25 Chicken Nachos, excessively over-accessorized with beans, cheese, red & green sauce, tomato, cilantro, onions, guacamole and sour cream, as well as the $11.25 mound of Fried Calamari with both spicy tomato sauce and roasted jalapeño tartar for dipping and the $12.65 Poke Stack with marinated raw ahi, crispy wontons, avocado, and wasabi soy sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/29YG26H). There was certainly plenty to go around, although none of it was all that memorable to the palate. Keeping it real.

For my entree, I chose the $16.65 Nashville Hot Chicken which offered one good-size fried chicken breast topped with fried sage and accompanied by a short stack of sweet potato pancakes, and pickles with ranch dressing and honey hot sauce on the side (photo: http://bit.ly/2aatqea). I only knew to order it from my trip to Nashville with Jamie W. last year when we had Hattie's. That was awesome. By contrast, this was just pretty good with the pancakes a bit of carb overkill. I think I fared better than most of my tablemates who were feeling rather bloated from all the food and beer. I have to say the waitstaff was extremely attentive throughout our meal, something I appreciated since I needed to go back to the hotel and do some work. Guess I didn't embarrass myself too badly. I still have my job.

FOOD - 3 stars...mostly passable bar-level food and way too many choices on the menu
AMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...a sea of TV screens with big party booths aimed at them
SERVICE - 3.5 stars...attentive considering it is a sports bar after all
TOTAL - 3 stars...if you've been to one Yard House..."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times, and it's always been good. My most recent trip was for happy hour, so we got a few appetizers and beers. We ordered the mu shu egg rolls and lettuce wraps, and both were surprisingly delicious - the variety of sauces was a great addition.

The bar is very nice - lots of beers on tap, and a huge menu.

Definitely a good happy hour place."}
{"text":"Only time I ate here, I had a hair in my burger. Manager said it happens. I decided to cut my bill in half since I didn't eat my meal. Paid and walked out. Disgusting if you ask me. Avoid this place. There's a lot more restaurants around"}
{"text":"I've been here three times this past month for lunch.  Nice menu selection, good service complimented by a real comfortable feel within the restaurant. Although usually very busy you still have sense that you can have a private conversation within your booth.  Prices are on the medium to high side. Love their Arnold Palmers. The Yard House will stay in the rotation."}
{"text":"Should be called the \"Barf House\". Arrived with my family of 5. Ordered several items paying close attention to their house \"favorites\". So, thinking they would be things they served frequently and therfore things they knew how to cook. This was definitely not the case. 
I ordered the \"Lobster Noodles\". What a joke. The few lobster pieces I did find were like rubber. The sauce was so salty that I couldn't  taste anything else. The over use of nasty, salt laden, non-fresh ingredients combined with this chefs obsession with truffle oil (out dated and overused), made me send it back. I replaced it with the Meso Sea Bass...bad idea. The Bass was raw in the middle! I boxed this one up and left for home. As soon as I got home? Straight to the bathroom to vomit! Yes...vomit! By far, one of worst places to eat around. McDonalds has better food."}
{"text":"My first experience at Yard House was a fantastic one. I do not recall having better customer service at any other restaurant. From the hostess to the waiter to the bus boy ---- Wow! They made me feel so special.

I entered via the entrance within the casino and was directed to the front of the restaurant for seating arrangements. I hope in the future that they are able to seat customers at both entrances.

They asked if I preferred indoor or outdoor seating. I was in a movie for the two hours prior, so I chose indoor seating just in case the weather was acting up (again).

Our waiter was fantastic. We ordered what he recommended, which was the jambalaya and the mac and cheese. Their fried calamari was okay; I still think Olive Garden's is a lot better. Don't forget to ask for extra marinara sauce.

The jambalaya was tasty with two large shrimp atop a bed of linguine (or jasmine rice, if you prefer). It was tasty and I'm not usually fond of spicy food.

The mac and cheese was good. I think I have had better elsewhere, but it's a personal preference of mine to have super creamy mac and cheese, not dry as if it were baked, which I think it was. It was supposed to have bacon in it, but I did not find any. The chicken and mushrooms were a great additions. 

My boyfriend raved about his jambalaya, but the mac and cheese was only okay. I'll be back to try more of their entrees.

Overall, the customer service is what made this experience so good for me. I don't know if it's due to them just opening, but I hope it stays that way."}
{"text":"So this was my first time trying it. I fell in love. We got the chicken nachos, French onion soup, ribs, the vodka shrimp pasta, and a full rack of ribs with a side of mashed potatoes and garlic fries. The ribs were perfect. The chicken in the nachos were kind of dry but still good! The garlic fries were amazing!!!!!! I love how dark it was inside. Perfect for a nice date. Service was great too! Or bill was $79.40 but it was worth it!"}
{"text":"Consistently great food and service. This location is always busy located at the base of the High Roller. Several different seating areas that allow great views for people watching. Lower patio is great. The upper patio at night offers one of the best views of the Linq promenade at night amazing space to enjoy beautiful weather.  

Avoid the long waits at the host stand if your a party of two or less and just head right for the bar.  With so many different tap choices the friendly staff will let you sample different beer styles to find that perfect one to accompany your meal.  FYI they do not take reservations for large parties on Fridays and Saturdays."}
{"text":"While at Town Square we need some nourishment during our little adventure.  It was very busy being a Friday afternoon.  After looking over the menu we decided to stay seeing that everyone was able to find something they could settle with for the late lunch.  The menu selections seemed ok but something you can find almost anywhere. Typical burgers, sandwiches, salads, some steak and seafood options as well.  

I decided on the Lamb burger with the feta cheese which gave the burger a different and savory flavor.  The meat was tender and seasoned well.  The fries were these little toothpick looking things that were not as satisfying as they looked.  I guess I prefer a steak style fry something with a little more carbs I guess.  

The service was sufficient, a little slow at times but there was a football game on that allowed the time to pass.  However when you have a family the kids do not find equal enjoyment.  We might try this place again, but I am not sure if I would go out of my way to visit.  Maybe for the Happy hour they have tons of beer choices.  I don't care for the big crowds of rowdy people that do not know how to handle their booze."}
{"text":"Yard House is a beer lover's dream.  Their enormous offerings of countless draught beers can be overwhelming.  There is definitely something for everyone in that department.  The food is average, eyt tasty."}
{"text":"We had a bad experience with a different Yard House here in Vegas several years ago, but this one was excellent and much better than the other one.
After my parents and I took my brother and his family onto the High Roller, we went to the Yard House right next door to it for dinner. It wasn't a very long wait as it was not very packed that night. The pizza I had there was pretty good, but I forget what kind of other foods I had there as well."}
{"text":"Went here one night with my girl and was my first time here, ever....I was surprised that paying $15 dollars for something that follows such a small plate of food. I mean it had 5 bites and I was still hungry.

Inside: It was a huge aread inside with lots of TVs and a huge bar area, there is also a huge open kitchen area that is quite loud in fact all the time. They have a back area that is a great area for dates.

Outside: There is a secation of seats outside if that is your thing, I didnt sit outside so I cant comment on that. 

Service: The waitress was always around or near the table to ask if we needed anything added to the bill or glasses refilled. This was always the only place I have been carded at for years and it was the case I was at a table where someone would be drinking at, I didnt mind but bring your ID.

I really dont mind paying out for big food that is ok, or little food that is awesome, since this place was neither I won't be returning unless I come back during a happy hour and just for drinks."}
{"text":"Beer 5 stars...  Happy Hour 5 stars (1/2 price beers and appetizers from 3-6PM)...  Food 3 stars.

I really enjoy this Yard House, but it is almost a carbon copy of the others I have been too (which is not a bad thing).  There are tons of TVs.  The food is good but not great.   The pricing is probably $1-2 too much for what you get, but you are paying for the newness and location.

I came right after the grand opening during the NCAA tourney, and it was fun to drink and watch the slew of games on all of the TVs.

I thought the servers were fun... my drink was never empty."}
{"text":"I've always loved the Yard House. A yard of beer? Hello? 5 stars!

I've been to a few of these and the cool thing is that depending on where you are you can taste a few of the local beers along with staples like Stella, Sam Adams Seasonal, etc. 

As far as food goes, this is far from simple bar food. I had the Cuban with tomato bisque and my cousin had the spicy tuna roll. When she ordered the waiter asked, \"Have you had the tuna roll here before?\" she knowingly shook her head yes. The tuna \"roll\" came and let me just say, \"Fabulous!!\" It's shaped like a huge can of tuna not a roll. It has all the ingredients of a spicy tuna roll except for the rice. Instead of rice it sits on a bed of edamame. A delicious red wasabi sauce wraps around it. It's one of those dishes that make you look at your plate and get immediately sad because you didn't order it. Don't get me wrong, the Cuban was amazing but if you like sushi, make sure someone gets that spicy tuna roll! Service was great and there were a plethora of screens for football. Did I mention a yard of beer?"}
{"text":"Lots of beers on tap and a varied menu but I had the shrimp ceviche and it was nothing like it should've been.  Almost non existent shrimp and not even close to how ceviche is to be. Service was good and the server was very attentive but the prices were not in line with the quality of food in received.  Large place interesting to visit but I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Did not have a long wait. Coconut shrimp appetizer and onion ring stack very good. I ordered a California roll and was informed that it was not a traditional roll. More of an open faced stack of all the ingredients and then some, if a California roll. I had reservations, but decide to order. It was very good. Hubby had ribeye and shrimp. So good. Melt in your mouth steak. Loved it. We sat In the outside area and the street music was too loud for me. Next time I'll sit inside."}
{"text":"Dude. Don't ask me how, but I had thee BEST house salad ever at the Yard House.

It was something about their housemade croutons and ranch dressing that I fell for I believe. On top of that, everything was fresh and crisp, and so goddamn refreshing!

Short review, but hell, I only had a house salad!

The customer service was fine, but a little slow. Waited about 15 minutes for the check, hence the 4 star. 

I'll be coming back to the Yard House next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"We loved this place!!! We had a little misunderstanding upon our arrival but Beau the Assistant manager cleared everything up and took care of us. Our server Zack was very attentive and also gave us great recommendations for the food but also for their extensive beer list. I have loved every Yardhouse that I have visited and this particular location reminded me why. What a great experience. Thank you so much."}
{"text":"Well I love Yard House. There are vegan selections that make you look carnivorous. I can eat wings and my vegan wife can have chicken strips and you can't tell who is the crazy one (her). Their chikin menu is fantastic and is mostly the morning star brand but who doesn't like being able to eat at one table that accommodates most diets. This location is standard Yard House quality and will definitely return."}
{"text":"korean bbq beef appetizer w/ brown rice and veggies.. couldn't believe how full i got off the appetizer. i also had linderman's framboise it was a fruity \"beer\" i liked it! i need to venture out in tasting other beers there. the seared ahi salad isn't the ahi caesar salad, so don't get it twisted like we did. the seared ahi salad was a salad you can make at home, and the seared ahi was thick and overly seasoned. the atmosphere is great and is a great place to meet up before catching a movie at rave."}
{"text":"Our last experience here during this check in was a miss.

This place is usually great as it serves as a good place for grabbing a beer, watching sports, and eating some food.

This time,  I brought my wife and 2 yr old here and we had a little scary experience.
We ordered a kid's meal for my daughter with an apple juice.

Out comes this kids cup with what looks like a cloudy apple juice.  Of course my wife (who is pregnant ) tries our baby's drink beforehand, and then tells me it tastes bad.

I took a sip, and it tasted like BEER.   WTH.

So I flag our server, I ask if apple juice is supposed to have a 'fizzy' type taste with it at this restaurant.  She said no.  She brought the drink over to her manager across the room and I saw him smell into the cup and then walk away.  

A while later, we finally get the manager to our table, and he gave us this explanation:

\"I dont know what happened, but it wasn't beer.  It looks like our apple juice just fermented.  I don't know how that is possible since we usually go through the juice pretty fast and replace it.   Anyways, this is new apple juice now from a new barrel.\"  

That's pretty much it.  No, real apology on what Im almost sure was beer.  No offer for any discount on our food or anything.  Afterwards he just left.  As for the food, nothing out of the ordinary.  Enjoyed, the ahi tuna poke.  That's about it. =T"}
{"text":"Second time I have came here to watch the Cubs game and they won't put it on.  Love their food, but if they can't accommodate a simple request, I am not likely to ever return!"}
{"text":"I am not a big lover of chains, but I do like the Yard House.  Their beer selection is extensive, the service is always friendly and helpful and the food is quite good.  The menu is a little overwhelming, but lots of great items to choose from whatever your mood may be."}
{"text":"This place used to be in our regular rotation with our visiting it weekly. Over the past year, service is sometimes spotty and we have been going less frequently. Food is usually pretty good although there is no excuse for well done burgers or cold fries."}
{"text":"I went the other night while I was in Phoenix.  Had a great time and the best waiter, his name was Chris.  The food was good, service was great.  I am back in Alexandria VA and I have to say the service in Phoenix is so much better.  Please send Chris to the Springfield mall to train these people on customer service.  He was great!"}
{"text":"Always busy but worth the wait, good service, good food and consistent!"}
{"text":"Sitting at the bar getting terrific service from Allison and her trainee Jr. as usual great atmosphere and great food!"}
{"text":"I can finally say that I have eaten here at this particular Yard House 8 times, and I'm 8 for 8 in having a perfect meal: The Pizzas, Orange chicken and rice, the Nachos-saparated, the grilled cheese and tomato bisque, the BBQ Wings, multiple times on a few of these....Eric was the Kitchen Mgr during one of my visits; when I asked to speak with him....he came out to me and was soooooooo down to earth when I knew he was getting slammed....Jason, the server, was super cool, and I can remember having Erica another time.  

This is totally a Top of the Line Bar Restaurant!

{"text":"If I could give this place a lower score I would. I used to come here years ago with my family and I remember it being great. It was clean and we really enjoyed it. I recently decided to take my boyfriend to lunch here as I remember the food being really good. Unfortunately, it went horribly wrong. When we sat down I noticed the menu was completely different. Also the table was sticky like it hadn't been cleaned. We were both starving so we decided to get something simple. I got the chicken tacos, and he ordered the turkey club and a Cesar salad. There were some red flags and we should have left, but again, we were starving and needed to eat. When the food came there was a hair on his plate and the salad was wilted. Also, my chicken was dry like it might have been sitting out. We decided to eat what we could but half way through the meal we looked at the turkey sandwich and noticed it looked almost raw on the inside or like some of the fat was still on it. It was clear, jelly consistency and disgusting. After that we completely lost our appetites and were ready to leave. Long story short, we both had FOOD POISONING. Throwing up and all the other stuff that comes with it all night long. So yes, this place sucks!"}
{"text":"Of the collection of Yardhouses I've visited I'd have to say this was my favorite. Why?

Well the selection is better compared to other restaurants in the chain (especially in the way of IPA's) and the servers and bartenders seem to be misplaced beer nerds stuck in a beer desert. There isn't much i found appealing about the Phoenix area beer scene, so for a hop head residing in the area I would suppose that Yardhouse is one of the few beer hot spots. The food is better. The pizzas here seem to be of a higher quality. The BBQ chicken pizza was AWESOME! Totally in love with it after a pint or...four.

Huge douchebag clientele though. Popped collars and platinum blondes galore. I left my Ralph Lauren at home and got shot some pretty serious stares. If you live in Phoenix or are a brew fanatic like me who's passing through this is an oasis in the hot, beer deprived desert."}
{"text":"I don't know why, but my wife and I seem to forget to put the Yard House in our restaurant rotation.  

My daughter-in-law picked the Yard House to have her birthday dinner with the family.

I got the Cobb Salad which was fresh, crisp and chock full of goodies.

My wife got the enchiladas which she said excellent.

Our waitstaff was apparently new and was in training, but she did great and was very attentive."}
{"text":"I hardly leave reviews unless the establishment or service made an impression on me and Yard House did this time! My fiancé and I went to the Yard House to celebrate our successful day and we had a great waitress by the name of Sarah. She was attentive, friendly, fast and knows her beer. She was schooling my fiancé, who is also a beer advocate on breweries. We love hot and spicy food and to find out there was a Habanero beer from Sarah was just awesome! (Habanero Sculpin - must try!) The food was also good and large portions. She made our night a blast with her service and beer knowledge (we ended up tipsy, great beer selection.)"}
{"text":"This review is long overdue, but what else really needs to be said? Yardhouse @ Townsquare is an institution; everyone's been here and we all think it's great. The quality and selection of beer is one of the best in the city. The food is a level or two above your standard bar fare, particularly with regard to fish entres: very good for the money. The mac & cheese is a must-order for any new comers, and the poké nachos are great for groups. If you're regularly near Townsquare, chances are you've been to Yardhouse and chances are you love it."}
{"text":"This time we tried the gardein boneless firecracker wings a little too fried and crispy but the taste was great, sweet and slightly spicy. The gardein and the blackened chicken torta was passable. The fries that came with it was not hot. The gardein spicy Thai pizza was more sweet than spicy but the taste was similar to firecracker. The cocktails here are expensive for the taste. The Malibu peach martini and the refresher were ok. The refresher had the cucumber freshness with sparkling water I think. The portion sizes are huge, it's a sin."}
{"text":"Went here for dessert after a movie and wasn't as satisfied as we thought we would be!

The food was good, but overpriced. We got the vanilla creme brule, chocolate souffle, and the banana berry macadamia nut cobbler. The vanilla creme brule was vanilla custard with burnt bananas on the top of it??? If you enjoy real creme brule don't bother here.

The chicken nachos are more then enough for 2 people to share as an entree and the chocolate souffle was just ok.

Overall it's okay, the service was the best part, all the staff was extremly friendly. I would came back if some else choose to, but wouldn't be my first recommendation."}
{"text":"Best time to go is for Happy Hour. They have great food and drink specials during Happy Hour although it gets fairly filled up quick. If you go on a Friday you will have to get there somewhat early. The patio is nice to people watch since the movie theatre is close by. The beer selection is vast and the staff is pretty knowledgeable when figuring out which beer is best. Gave it 4 stars because if you go anytime other than Happy Hour the food and drinks are a little expensive"}
{"text":"We stopped by to try it out after a movie.  So the bored bartender, after tossing menus at us with barely a word, did take our drink order.  When he served our drinks we noticed he had crud under his fingernails as if he had been working on his car before work.  GROSS!!!!"}
{"text":"We love this place!  If you are a beer lover then you can't go wrong here!  The Yard House has the widest selection of beer that I think I have ever seen!  Very impressive! What is even cooler if they have their own brewery in house, literally right above the bar (make sure to look up when you walk in).  We didn't really eat much when we were here but did get a chance to try chips and guacamole, which hit the spot! The food menu was a bit pricey. Will definitely keep this as a regular spot stop next time we are in Vegas!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"One of the best happy hours in Las Vegas. Came in late with a party of 5 and we left very happy! Food was quick and everything out at the same time. Some personal favorites of tonight: seared ahi sashimi sitting in an amazing soy vinaigrette. Also the boneless wings buffalo style are always a must. Finally a must try the chicken nachos that comes with a tasty green sauce. Overall was a great experience and my first time at this location. Yard House does not fail!"}
{"text":"Great food. Awful service! The gardein menu is my favorite and the only reason it brings me in, and obviously the extensive beer menu! The gardein wings in buffalo sauce and Mac n cheese is my fave!"}
{"text":"ok so i have been here many times, for lunch and dinner, in big groups and small and i have always had good food. But this time was even better, Tim was our waiter and he was quite efficient. They wanted to try some beers and he made suggestions and brought samples.  He was helpful with questions, kept our glasses full and brought the kids menu without us having to ask as we weren't seated with it.  better service led to better experience. S
The mac and cheese was a big hit, the adult and the kid version.  the roasted turkey melt was also a nice sandwich with a lot of flavor.  I got the spicy tuna roll and I always love it. it's my usual go to option there! Its not your typical roll, almost like a spicy tuna cake with edamame, avocado, and tuna mostly without any rice.  It also is one big roll. Yummy as usual.... Like the soups too and the lunch sandwich or pizza and soup option but wasn't in mood. The kids meal comes with a fruit pop and side too which is way too much with their portion sizes! Lol... 
we were all too full to try dessert but they sounded good too. lol.  another positive experience here, just go hungry as big portions and so many options! Definitely the go to place at town square...."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Yard House:  here in Las Vegas and at several other locations I've visited.  This review is focused on the Las Vegas location at Red Rock Casino in Summerlin.

I haven't tried anything I don't like on the menu and no matter what kind of beer I'm in the mood for, they'll have something to satisfy.  The menu has something for everyone, and the beer selection is even bigger!  I love that they also have \"chalkboard beers\"--special or seasonal brews that they don't usually carry, but that they have on-hand for a short time.  Be sure to ask what they are since the list changes often.

The waitstaff has always been top notch:  friendly, fast and willing to spend time chatting about their favorite beers and food on the menu.  Food comes out hot and in good time, empty plates are taken away quickly, and your drink glass is never empty.  When we bring our young son, it seems they always find time to say hello to him specifically--a nice touch!

The atmosphere is a little dark, but not in a bad way, and while I wouldn't say the restaurant is loud, the noise level may bother folks with sensitive hearing.  This may be because it always seems to be fairly full.  Lunchtime is quieter, and on weekends you may have to wait to get seated.  There's also classic rock playing and it seems they've created a playlist full of all the hits!

Bottom line:  the Yard House is a rock solid choice for good food, good music and an upbeat atmosphere.  Gather your appetite and your friends and go:  it's that kind of place!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times but never got around to writing a review. Sat at the bar and enjoyed the game and tried their old fashions. I was pleasantly surprised by the taste and quality. Marcos took good care of me and really made me feel welcome and taken care of. He did an excellent job. I ordered the Nashville hot chicken. It is well prepared and crispy but it MUST be spicy. Nashville hot chicken isn't meant to be mild like that. If that had been spicy this would be a 5 star review. My suggestion to restaurant is to do a mild and spicy version. Don't chicken out! Other than that great experience!"}
{"text":"Unbeatable for the beer selection. Where else can you get Lost Coast Watermelon Wheat Beer, followed by Purple Haze, followed by Big Sky Moose Drool? Town Square- easy parking, happy hour, better than average bar/casual food. BOOM."}
{"text":"Like to come here during the week after work. Usually around 815-830. Bar never packed, always fast service!

Love yardhouse, every az location is awesome, drinks come fast, food is delicious. If there is a wait it's never too long.

Go visit!!"}
{"text":"Great food, cool atmosphere.  Our waiter was pretty much non existent which is why I took off a star.  Went on a Saturday night, we were seated right away.  They have an outdoor patio you can wait longer for, and once the Sky Wheel opens, I think it will be even more busy.  Great food, I had the surf and turf burger, yum!  Truffle fries were great, never had anything with truffle oil, but I have heard of it mentioned on several cooking shows so I decided to try it.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"So here is the reason I'm posting my first Yelp review ever....As a regular user of Yelp and a restaurant owner myself(East Valley), I thought today's experience was a good qualifier for what it was intended for, to let people know what they should know before they spend their money. First I want to make it clear that my wife and I frequent both locations in Desert Ridge and Scotts Fashion Mall and even on occasion, Newport Beach and want it to be known that we consider Yard House one of our favorite restaurants to sit down and have a beer and one of the only places we know of that serves consistently great food. Today we went to Westgate for lunch to meet some friends and family that live in the area and to watch the Cardinal game. We decided to go early and catch the end of a couple games before the Cardinals started and we ended up having our usual bites and a few beers. We sat between two tv's on the west side of the bar so that we could see more games and also figured that the Cardinals would end up on atleast one.  With 3-4 seats open on both sides of us and basically only crickets chirping, the tv's kept changing with games late in the 4th with only minutes left. My wife and I were in total disbelief and figured that someones toddler must have gotten ahold of the remote. Anyway, FFWD, our entree shows and the Cardinal game comes on the tv to our right and the 49's game to our left..life is good...beer is good...food is normally good (not today).... and then all of a sudden the toddler from hell turns both tv's to the 49's game. I looked at the bar tender and raised my arms and without a word he turns around and goes and gets the manager. The manager comes and says that he can't please everyone and that if we would like to move he would accommodate. I said we are in WESTGATE for f*** sake and I cant believe you don't have the game on for patrons that have been waiting on atleast one of the tv's.  Again in disbelief, I looked around me at the people wearing Cardinal garb who are now moving somewhere else to find a tv with the Cardinal game on...Krazy! From where we were sitting we could see 6 tv's and only 2 of them had the Cardinal game on and the rest were all 49's. The only 2 were clear across the dining area. So my take on the Yard House @ Westgate is it caters to all the fair-weather transplant fans of Arizona that would rather see the Dodgers, Lakers, Raiders and apparently, even the 49's. FFwd again...grabbed our check contacted our friends and we all met at Gordon B., where they appreciate the local sports and what Westgate stands for.... To be fair, the 1-star is for the trigger happy toddler who comp'd our drinks after dismissing our significance at the bar....Their are plenty of choices in this area, follow the crowds and not the crickets if you want to watch the local sports!"}
{"text":"My husband and I always wanted to try this particular Yard House but when we finally did, it was a waste. We had to take the delivery to go, which typically is fine but I'm guessing that wasn't such a wonderful idea. 

We both ordered the RibEye with shrimp. We asked them to substitute the green beans for broccoli. I do want to add that the broccoli that was served, I don't think I've ever seen broccoli look like that a day in my life. 

But nevertheless we still had this amazing steak with some nice size shrimp. Ha!!!! I asked for the steak to be well done (no pink) which I'm starting to think they read it wrong and decided to just char the outside. We also ordered a chopped salad that came with a brownish tint of avocado but hey, the sodas were decent. It was over $101 which was a waste and when I contacted them they advised me a manager would call me back well that was on August 19th and still nothing! 

If that's well done, I'd hate to see raw!"}
{"text":"You gotta love Yard House!!!(or The Yard as I like to call it) me and the whole fam use to be regulars here atleast every 2 or 3 weeks, that was back when my mother-in-law and her boyfriend were together.They would always have us meet them at the Yard every other Friday and holidays(like you would pass up a free meal). We would always order the same thing, The happy hour specials. Its too many items to name but you can look it up and see what it is(Pizza, onion rings, sliders, poke, calamari, fries, etc). All of the items were very good and I would say the Bernaise sliders are my absolute favorite. Some would say they are pretty basic, which I agree, they are. But its the mild yogurt-based dipping sauce that they serve with it that gives me an O-Face everytime I take a bite. Im a slider expert and I dont know about yall, but I like my sliders basic(beef, cheese, onions). None of that foie gras, pork belly, cilantro leaves crap. Keep it simple stupid!! I would also always order the same drink, a St Bernardus 13(14% alcohol, yeah buddy!!!) Cant wait to go back, probably wont be for while since monster-in-law and her boy toy broke up. We'll see tho."}
{"text":"For a daymn chain restaurant, my hunnybunz and I can't get enough of this place!  Great for get togethers, drinks, and the food almost never fails.  Its good.  I can't even count the amount of times I come here.  Our new faves we've discovered:  Tortilla soup (the bf loves loves loves he gets a whole bowl) and the turkey burger.  That turkey patty is fricken delish!  I would do it protein style and its just fricken good. Just wish there's was better phone reception here (any att local knows it just sucks). LOL"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a sports bar that offers a restaurant type atmosphere then stop in to the Yard House. They offer lots of choices when it come to beer and they have a menu the covers a wide array of options to choose from. Stopped in twice this week and the first night I had the Kale salad with salmon. For starters I ordered the clam chowder. The chowder had a great taste I thought it was a little on the soupy side. I've had the soup here before and it was spot on. My wife had the cheese burger and my son had the chicken quesadilla. 

The lamb burger is an excellent choice as well. It was served on a lightly toasted bun  with feta cheese on top of a bed of arugula.

The lobster noodles are a great choice as well. I had this dish on my previous visits."}
{"text":"Great restaurant and food.  Although the California roll was oddly different.  It did not have any seaweed on it.  That's awful strange since I had been to the Yard House in San Diego and in Denver and they were both served with seaweed.  Humm? That's kinda weird."}
{"text":"My favorite happy hour on the planet.  

I would travel many miles to get my hands on their Spicy Tuna."}
{"text":"Came here for a few drinks with some buds after checking out Town Square last Friday.  Happy Hour rocks here!!!!  Service was good, drinks were refreshing, good layout, and decent menu; basically the makings for a great hangout spot."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Service ok could use improvement. Our server seemed busy. Bar back or who ever dropped off drinks threw the straw in our food. They messed up our reservations as well. We had a party of 13 but only had 10 seats at our table reservations were made 4 days in advance for a bday party. The only 5 star thing was my cherry limeade drink. Who ever made it made it the best I ever had. Would I return probably not due to so many other options in a 5 mile radius."}
{"text":"What can I say about the YH? It wasn't a bad place, a little loud though. It felt like a sports bar with all the sports on the TV's. Nice music though. I ordered the mac and cheese with chicken and bacon. They could've given me a little more bacon, but I  was not at all disappointed. The parmsesan cheese fries with truffle oil were outta this world! If I go there again, i'll just order those fries. I don't have alot to say about the YH. The prices were a little high, but affordable. They were a little skimpy on the wine. Overall, my experience was average."}
{"text":"Horrible place, horrible service. One server for a table of 13 guests including kids. She took orders and kept forgetting to bring the water. The appetizers came out but the menus still occupied our table and one of us had to collect them and put them on the other table. Some of us had silverware while others waited and the food just kept coming. 

2stars are for the food because only that was the best part about this experience. Really flavorful food. Kudos to the kitchen. 

Zero stars for the rest of the experience. We had brought in a cake to surprise one of the adults in the group and the server as well as the manager was well aware of this yet the server kept asking the kids and the adults if they'd like to order dessert ?. One of the guests had to excuse themselves and go remind the server that we had brought cake and he brought it with him. It was so terrible really. There's more, I could keep going but I think you get the gist of this experience. One thing is for sure I ain't going there again. 

I may try a different location coz the food was good but this one has lost me."}
{"text":"First and foremost, my not so great experience here  today is no direct reflection of how good the food is here. I love this place. I had one bad service experience that will likely result in my discontinued future visits to this location but will continue to patronize the brand because I still love this place. 

There are multiple perks to this location though, especially if you've had a long day of shopping and are hungry. Also, it's an easy atmosphere and a LARGE selection of craft beer. Also, I recommend the sushi roll for anyone who loves sushi!

Don't let my post discourage your trip here to the Town Square location. Just know you may not feel like a welcomed priority."}
{"text":"This is a great place for beer drinkers!  So many good beers to try out.  Happy Hour is pretty good.  It's Monday - Friday 3:00PM - 6:00PM and Late Night Happy Hour Sunday - Thursday 10:00 PM - Close.  They have drink and food deals.  

The queso dip with roasted poblano, chipotle,  and bacon was very good.  It is a lot of food.  The pepper jack burger was cooked perfectly and had good flavor.  The onion rings were a bit of a let down.  They didn't have much seasoning and were just average at best.  The Hot & Spicy edamame had good heat and was cooked perfectly.  Really good.  

The staff has always been attentive and helpful.   The bar and bathrooms were clean. They have many TV's to watch sports on, but not as many as some other sports bars.  It's one of my top choices when I just want good draft beer but not when I want to watch a game.  It's a little on the expensive side compared to others, so more of a date night place."}
{"text":"4 people in my party all loved their food. We live in San Diego and had been to the one here as well. Love the menu options and because it was cheat day I ordered truffle fries. I am usually disappointed because 99% of restaurants skimp on the truffle oil...not here! They were delcious and I hated to share mine. My husband loved the quinoa salad and I gobbled up the ahi tuna sandwich. I wish I could remember our server's name because I would love to give him a shout out! Took photos of us like a pro and I can't imagine how many he has to take every day. Warm, attentive and knowledgeable- what more could you want? I wish they had a hot pretzel appetizer but now I'm just splitting hairs. Great experience!"}
{"text":"I kept hearing about this place, so I was happy when me and one of my girls decided to come for a girls night out. We had a couple of cocktails each, and 2 appetizers. The drinks were surprisingly good! Even though I love beer, I just wasn't in the mood. We ordered the lobster/crab/artichoke dip and the spicy tuna roll (which is not your typical cut roll. It's delicious art). They are must orders. We ate every bite. They service was pretty good at the bar, but that's because we went on a slow night. I will come back again and I need to have some of those beers. Then I can give it 5 stars, maybe :-)"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good, 
Went with my bro up here since he was dying to go to Westgate (not a fan of it) but all in all it was a good place for drinks and a turkey burger that happened to be delicious. Did I mention we sat next to Sir Charles Barkley."}
{"text":"Ordered a turkey melt and it came out so burnt. Didn't realize it until I took a bite and had a horrible taste. I opened the sandwich and both sides on the inside were very burnt/black. My clam chowder was spicy and it didn't say it was spicy. Our pita bread was overcooked. Our server was nice and offered to replace my food, but I'd lost my appetite so she took my meal off the bill. Won't be back though."}
{"text":"Multiple times I have attempted to eat at this location and the food is just not good enough.  I asked the waiter what his \"go to\" meal is, 3 tacos fish, carnitas and I'm unsure the third- looked and tasted like jerky, priced at $17.85.  The fish taco was edible.  The beef was undercooked and flavorless.  The third, I already described as jerky like- was heavily sauced and unrecognizable.  A cup of rice and small ramekin of beans.  I will not be ordering food here again.  They are a brew house- eat elsewhere and drink here.  The atmosphere is group friendly and they have 100+ beer on tap.

I think there are better choices for food.

Update: will give another star for restaurant's effort to get in touch regarding my experience.  If they care enough to know, I'll care enough to help/discuss.  I can appreciate the effort."}
{"text":"I ordered a simple lunch (salad and pizza)- nothing fancy, but still good food :) My husband got some of the tacos and LOVED them, as well as the beer selection. Great service also! It's a great place if you can't decide what you feel like eating.. They have a little bit of everything."}
{"text":"Food is ok, nothing over the top. The service it's decent and the staff are friendly and kind. There is a lot of beer, and the house beers are not half bad actually. But honestly, the area that needs improvement in this establishment is the food; everything i had tasted rather bland (fried calamari, the California roll, burgers and the tacos). Some better recipes and I think this place has potential! BEER!"}
{"text":"Told this place we were  a large group( high school) and warned them we would be loud and put us in back and now they tell us we are too loud??? We had a group of approximately 22 and we sang \"Happy Birthday\". That's what I was told was the offensive noise we sang too loud and this is a \"Family Restaurant\". Not for the fact the the Yard House is a Bar & restaurant but come on don't act like this is my mom's house. We spent in excess of $700 so I will not take my business back ( and I know no one cares) just putting out a warning if you're planning to host a large group at the YardHouse. DON'T DO IT !!!!"}
{"text":"1/29/16
After doing some retail therapy, we came into Yard House for some dinner. This place is set up beautifully; and it has a microbrewery inside of it so there are plenty of beer options available.

We were seated, and got a friendly attentive server- you can't beat that. I ordered the porchini Halibut with bok choy, asparagus, and mashed potatoes. This was ridiculously delicious, everything was flavorful and cooked perfectly. I also go a Moscow mule, and it was nice and strong.

I will definitely come back to try more of their dishes."}
{"text":"The Yardhouse is a chain restaurant, yet they do it so exceedingly well that it feels much more inviting than a traditional chain like the Olive Garden or a Sizzler.

First off, the wait time is well handled. We only had ten minutes to be seated and that was on a Saturday night.
Next, our server, Marshal A., was charming, accommodating, and super knowledgeable about the menu. Our food was timed perfectly and he anticipated our needs like a seasoned veteran.

The food was very good, but seemed to lack a little depth. I had the miso sea bass. Usually the sauce has more depth. I'm not holding it against them though and will order this yumminess again. VGK had just lost and everyone was a little effected.
My husband had the fried chicken and adored it. 
My daughter would like the gruyere back on the grilled cheese and tomato soup item. Blue cheese just doesn't rank and that item was why we chose Yardhouse in the first place.
Overall, a good memory in a reliable and yummy place."}
{"text":"The food quality is solid, the people are nice and they have a great selection of beer! They actually carry my favorite beer - Rogue Hazelnut Brown - which is great because not many places have it. The only downside is that the prices are a bit high - so happy hour is your friend :)"}
{"text":"This might be one of your most affordable dining experiences on the strip. My husband and I spent $44 dollars for two dinners and two pints of beer. Everything, especially the duck wings, tasted incredible and filled with flavor. I really enjoyed the Hot Chicken with cinnamon pancakes. This was a great play on chicken and waffles. 

Let me start by saying we only waited 15 minutes for a table of 7 on Saturday night. This was awesome. We could also get drinks from an outside bar as we waited.They do limit you to one drink per person at a time to ensure that you do not over do it. I think this is a great business practice especially on the strip. 

Once seated, our waiter (a tall friendly gentleman named James) quickly provided us with water. He then routinely came by to take our orders as we would make up our minds. No glasses were ever empty. The food he brought us was incredible and he truly seemed interested in ensuring we had a good experience. 

I don't know what could be done to make this experience better other than asking other loud guests to quiet down lol. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place is always pretty awesome with a decent wait time. I like it a little less than the one by the Linq because the service is just a little less up to par. The prices seem identical to other Yardhouses in the area and the atmosphere seems the same.

I do have one main complaint. My last time I was served here.My waiter seemed confused as to what I was saying as if I had a hearing problem. I asked for pepper for my chicken soup, and he thought I said the opposite.

He then promptly walked away without me having the chance to correct him. He never truly took the time to ensure our orders were correct. For instance, we were brought the wrong beer and had to have another server fix the mistake.

Unfortunately, I do not recall his name, but he was a young tall man with long hair. 

Although I just ranted about service, you must know that the food is incredible. I love the pork belly tacos, the crab cakes, and Thai chicken pizza. I'll always come back here for a good happy hour special."}
{"text":"The vegetarian menu is amazing!! It's not cheap but it's great for special occasions."}
{"text":"VEGAN review:

This is a review of the VEGAN BURGER. I came to Yard House at LINQ twice while I was in Vegas - it was that good. The portion is huge and the side salad is a great touch. The burger itself was decent, and I like that there was an effort to make an interesting vegan burger. There were lots of components to the burger (rather than just a vegan patty on buns); there was kale, vegan cheese, tomatoes, avocado, etc. When ordering the vegan burger, make sure your side is a SALAD with vegan balsamic dressing. The fries are not vegan!! 

I wanted to try their other gardien items, but I was wary about what was and wasn't vegan so I just went with the vegan burger."}
{"text":"The service was to good,every other bite i took \"is everything fine sir,do you need anything?\" Like every 5 mins...the food was decent ordered the steak, med rare... chared just right the Aidios MF was a lil weak the only reason you order a Aidios is because you know its strong also way to bright for my liking we was under a spot light it seemed right under a tv in the corner ...i would say its just like every other tourist spot probably why i will not go back.it was decent,just not for me"}
{"text":"Schweeeet Baby Jesus can I get an AMEN!!!  LOVE LOVE LOVE this fantabolous place with their awesome selection of amazing beers and a menu to pair with it. 

Double, no TRIPLE kudos to the waiter who knew literally every beer that I asked a question about, and I'm talking well over 10!  He rocks my tubular socks and I hope that I get him again when I make it back there!

I like the setup of the place and how when you walk in, you look to the left and you see this massive amount of keggage going on- it just makes you drool.  The ambiance was perfect, the bar was large and the TV's were all set to the good ole Giants and Cowboys game (first game of the season, this was serious business no matter who your team is)  

So, they offered me everything I could ask for:

-Ginormous selection of beer
-Football on multiple TVs
-Awesome wait staff
-Perfect ambiance

Make this a stop next time you're in Town Square.  If you don't you're just a silly little goose!"}
{"text":"I nearly lost my $#%¥ when I found out there was a Yard House open in Vegas! This one is a perfect addition to the Linq area sandwiched between the Quad and Casino.

If you've never been to a Yard House, it's a bar/restaurant known for having a lot on tap, a pretty extensive food menu and providing plentiful options for vegans and vegetarians.

Their menu is reasonably priced (along with some happy hour specials), especially for Vegas. My favorite thing to do is order 2-3 appetizers and get to try a bunch of different things! My boyfriend and I came here a couple times while visiting Vegas so we got a pretty good read on this location.

It looks like the wait for tables can be a little lengthy. We sat at the bar to bypass it all. The service was quick and c'mon, there is SO MUCH on tap here. It's awesome.

Not sure where to start? My food recommendations are:
-Truffle fries: You really can't go wrong with these. Savory and great for sharing.
-Guac and chips: They actually do a pretty solid guac here! Save the excess for smothering on your main course.
-Ahi poke bowl: I would definitely ask for soy sauce to go with this, since it's a little bland otherwise. They'll bring you chopsticks if you want, but I basically inhaled this, it was so good!
-French onion soup: Yes, I ordered a soup with a straight face at the bar. Twice. This was some of the best French onion soup I've ever had...perfectly flavored and boiling hot, crusted at the top with soup-absorbed bread and bubbling cheese. Yum. (PS- if you or someone in your group is getting an entree, you save about a $1.50 by adding the soup as a side instead of ordering a la carte.)
-Gardein wings: One of the reasons I really enjoy Yard House is that it's vegan and vegetarian friendly. It's just friendly in general, as they also point out low calorie options on the menu, but I digress. Hands down, my favorite Gardein dish is the wings. They are perfect, from bite sized goodness to having a meaty texture that will satisfy and possibly fool some carnivores.
-BBQ chicken pizza: Who doesn't love pizza in a bar? This one is top notch."}
{"text":"Great place to hangout and eat great food with great atmosphere.  The crew has always been good and friendly.   I love the blacken chicken salad and the chicken enchilada stack.  Both are awesome.  Great place to go with friends or maybe take your girl.  This place is in my top 10 food places I would recommend.   They have a lot of great food and anyone can find something to eat here for sure.  Must try but diffently busy on Friday and Saturday nights.  If you like beer, you will love this place."}
{"text":"TRAVIS IS AMAZING. 
Baja tacos are fire. 
He created this drink i described and went above and behind my expectations !
End of story!"}
{"text":"Just have to say how awesome our waiter (Trés) is. Really helpful & easy to work with. We had a group of 15...then 17 & he had no problem working our extra prople in. Even with constant changes to orders & questions he managed us all REALLY WELL! He's super friendly and just an awesome person! I appreciate him so much! He even went above & beyond to make 4 people in our group feel special for their birthdays! Its employees like Trés that keep people coming in!  I am Customer Service Trainer in my line of work & I would hire Trés in a HEARTBEAT!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, slow to come out. Obviously great beer selection and good patio seating. Nice staff and always clean. Everything is overpriced though. 
More of a social place to hang and talk over a drink than a restaurant - not very kid friendly."}
{"text":"Good beverages and food.  Excellent service and management."}
{"text":"This was the first time I had ever eaten at a Yard House. I was shocked on how good the quality was considering how reasonably it was priced. I had the BBQ Cheddar burger and it was terrific. The burger was full of flavor and seasoned to perfection. 

The scenery and the service was very good. They have a huge selection of craft beer and even though I could care less about that, my buddy was very pleased with his choice. 

For being in such a highly populated area we only had to wait for about ten minutes, which we were perfectly okay with."}
{"text":"Diverse beer selection and great food. The lobster artichoke dip  is fantastic and the salads are great"}
{"text":"They hit it out of the park for dinner. 

On a Saturday night, I always recommend calling ahead. They don't take \"reservations\" but one can call and get on the list, then check in. They'll notify you by text message when your table is ready. 

Appetizer of pea pods fried was good, but a bit challenging to eat. I guess one squeezes the peas out, and eats them, verse just eating the whole thing. Kid of weird, I'm not one for mouth stuff- knife and fork preferred!

Wanted to try something different and went with the Shiitake burger. Excellent choice, great taste, but the texture is unique. Great combination of flavors. 

My companion went with street tacos, which she loves here. Her drink had blueberries, and she said it was fantastic as well. The waitress was fine, not overly friendly, but didn't mind checking with the kitchen and was polite. This is definitely my favorite chain restaurant. A drink, two dinners, and an appetizer for under 40 of this quality is great."}
{"text":"We decided to eat outside on the patio because it was nice and gloomy today. Their inside dining is always very loud and it makes it really awkward to keep saying what!? every time someone says something. But their food and service is always good every time I've been there. Our waitress Nancy was very attentive and helpful. They had the heater on outside and we were slowly roasting in 65 degree weather, fortunately Nancy was able to turn it off for us. I ordered a cup of clam chowder and my friend ordered their Mac and cheese. Everything was very tasty, but my friend said that he only got one piece of chicken. So that was sucky for him."}
{"text":"The food was good, the drinks were good. The environment was pleasant & our waiter Luis was attentive. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Came for HAPPY HOUR with the girlfriends. Happy hour is from 4-6, and they have a great selection of beers and appetizers on their HH menu. And I think a few bucks off house cocktails. 
We all had beers. We also shared classic buffalo wings and a plate of chicken nachos, which was HUUUUUGE, enough for the 3 of us. 
Everything tasted yummy. Service was ok. Hostess and server could've been friendlier. SMILE PEOPLE! It doesn't hurt!
Would definitely return if I'm ever in the area again."}
{"text":"Nothing but awesomeness going on here.  The bartenders are TOP NOTCH and no attitudes to deal with.  David is #1 and the Manager Joe always is welcoming.  Give these guys a bonus.  Food is excellent but could be a little pricey.  I guess it's worth a few extras bucks when the customer service rocks - oh and so does the music.  Papago Orange Blossom ON TAP - Oh yeah!  Going back."}
{"text":"Kim P the bartender here is great! Amazing service, smile, and super nice. If I owned a restaurant Id want her working for me...And she can serve you any of like 100 beers."}
{"text":"NO LATE NIGHT HAPPY HOUR at this location, NEVER EVER so don't believe otherwise. 
Great menu but huge, felt like I was making life decisions! Shrimp Ceviche was awesome, doesn't come with chips as it's served like a salad $8.  Pizza was great $15.  Chopped Salad $8 terrible.  Pomegranate Martini was average at best $13."}
{"text":"Too fancy for my taste but wanted to try it out anyways. Disappointed that they didn't have a simple dish everything was complex and expensive."}
{"text":"Pretty much my favorite hamburger in Las Vegas is their Pepper Jack burger without the chipotle mayo. Love the skinny fries too. The best deals however are the happy hour appetizer half off deal. The onion ring tower is awesome and the traditional buffalo wings are great too. I tried the chicken nachos once but they weren't that great and got cold quick."}
{"text":"Overall a good experience. The beer selection is second to none. I ate the grilled cheese with tomato bisque soup. Plus added bacon, who wouldn't?
I sat at the bar. Service was good, but a bit hit and miss in the end. 
I had two pints with dinner, then I decided to have a last one watching the Dodgers blow it in the top of the seventh. 
Long story short, the last pint of Guinness cost me $10!  I left the cash out there for 15 minutes as a test. The kid walked by me several times, but never tried to give me change. Job poorly done, Tyler R. Especially after I gave you over a 20% tip on the first tab...  Although he had no problem flirting with the two blonde, female bartenders."}
{"text":"Ohhhh lalalala! Yardhouse is the best place to be. Theeee best spot for a 
Happy hour. They served all my favorite dish My husband & I enjoy coming to this place. Atmosphere is great."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. The happy hour deals here are some of the best you'll find at any decent restaurant. Great vegan menu too if that's your thing.  I always end up here when I can't make up my mind where to go eat."}
{"text":"yard house.. Sunday lunch with my boys(husband & 2 adorable boys)..hehe
They have a wide varieties of food in the menu, some I really like and others not so much. 
My fav. Is the shrimp and sausage jambalaya (cuz I like mine HOT)..
Thai spicy pizza is really good if you're not allergic to peanuts..
Dessert is the Mona coffee w/macadamia nuts ice cream..yummy yummy for my tummy!!
My son always get the kids pepperoni pizza w/ fries n a drink for $6.99.."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Yardhouse. It was the place I chose for my birthday dinner. A-stinkin'-MAZING! The service was fabulous, our waiter, Andrew was awesome. The atmosphere was funky and modern. The food was delish! I ordered the Nashville hot chicken and it was wonderful! The house salad was awesome also! Then, the best part...the waiter brought me a surprise dessert (creme brûlée) with a candle, then brought me a birthday card with a gift card to the restaurant!! I was so stunned! I think it is safe to say that this is my new favorite restaurant! I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Walked in and got ignored for a few minutes while the girls in the front were in deep conversation, I finally had to interrupt. 
Got seated and ordered the lobster garlic noodles, which was horrible! No taste, very bland. And definitely no garlic! Yard house should be ashamed to have this on their menu."}
{"text":"Food was good.  Good beer selection.  Staff was decent. But don't come here if you want to watch ohio state. Got it changed once to them but immediately changed back. The Oregon game was on on five TVs in our area, one tv showing unranked teams, and another showing big ten network that was showing reruns. I'll try a few other places before I go back, if I ever come back.  Food was nothing to come back for, and maybe other places will show the game."}
{"text":"Exceeded expectations. 

If you enjoy good food (huge variety), a large beer selection (draft and bottle) and good service, you will enjoy the Yard House. 

A return visit is definitely in the cards.

{"text":"My friends and I stumbled into this place. We were deciding on what place to eat in Town Square and found that this place had the best menu. 

Ambiance: 5 - This place had a good energy all around. The host greeted us and was helpful by explaining the happy hour menu. In the center of the restaurant is a bar and all around the room are TVs playing sports. At sunset, they added tea light candles to each table and I thought it had a very nice touch. I highly recommend going to this place if you're looking to watch a game or to have a date night here.

Service: 5 - If I could give higher stars than a 5 I would! Our waiter was incredibly helpful when we were ordering. There were times when it would take a while to get our food but he would make sure that we got our food hot and ready. I definitely would want to have him as my waiter the next time I eat there, if only I could remember his name haha. 

Food: 4 - I ordered the Hawaiian pizza and parmesan truffle fries. The Hawaiian pizza was a pretty large size and I was really satisfied with it. The only thing I didn't like about the pizza was it was very thin crust and soggy. I like to have my crust a little fluffy and if I do order thin crust I would like for the bread to have a crisp/crunch to it. The truffle fries were heaven!!! The portion was pretty decent and definitely worth paying for. It wasn't too oily, it had a little crunch, and the parmesan was added just right. I highly recommend ordering the truffle fries!

The next time i'm hungry at Town Square, I will definitely visit this place during happy hour. Great food for an amazing price!"}
{"text":"I had a wonderful experience eating here. The turkey club was amazing and I had a wonderful beer. Plenty of beers on tap. I would highly recommend coming here for a nice snack and a plethora of beer!"}
{"text":"If you like beer is a good place but for food not so much 
They are super expansive and the service is slow 
Everytime I go there and I have one beer , me and my gf end up paying $70-$80 
It's just to much 
I don't know why they charge that much 
I would come there more if that was t that expansive"}
{"text":"I love this place. Great customer service. Great music, and great vibes. Had lunch with my other half and mannn food is to die for. Food did not take that long to get ready. we ordered korean style dracula tacos, and some sort of \"vodka pasta\" dont worry it does not taste anything like vodka. I cant wait to dine in here agai"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Yardhouse. I probably come here once per month; you just cant beat their amazing food and huge selection of beers!

Amazing things i have ordered include: macaroni and cheese, chicken pot pie, jambalaya chicken, truffle fries, and enchiladas stack. I crave those enchiladas!

Their peachy belgian beer cocktail is heavenly in the hot Vegas weather.

The restaurant is always a bit loud, but thats what you get with a bar in the center of the room I guess. Still a cool place to grab a great meal."}
{"text":"I really love Yardhouse, but this location definitely does not have as good of food as the Red Rock Casino location. Obviously the LinQ is an awesome location, but they must get too much traffic and cant focus as much attention on the food."}
{"text":"This rating is due to the beer selection not the food.  While the food is ok, it is standard chain restaurant food.  The beer selection though really makes up for what it lacks in food.  It is a great place to stop by before going to a movie."}
{"text":"What can you say bad about a place with 100 beers on tap and a menu that's like opening a history book? Yard house is a great place to start your night, whether it's happy hour or a great dinner, we've done both and they really know how to take care of customers. The only complaint I had that night was the woman in charge of finding us a table was a little grumpy. We were a large group and she was a little upset that we didn't have an exact number 8 or 10. I get it, it matters, but talk about a buzz kill. Anyways, once we were seated on the patio, we had a blast and stayed for a few hours. We'll be back again and again."}
{"text":"Yard House is s great place to go for drinks and food. They have over 50 beers on tap and their cocktails are amazing. The restaurant is a place for fun. You're right next to the High Roller. The best seats are on the patio upstairs. You're surrounded by locals and tourists enjoying a night out on the town. You can hear loud music being played directly in front of the restaurant and I haven't heard a bad performer yet. The restaurant does tend to be loud however this matches the atmosphere of the restaurant. The waitstaff have always been pleasant and helpful. The menu is long and broad: from jambalaya to pizza you'll never leave hungry. The menu is so long that it does take quite some time to decide. The portions are huge. The food isn't the greatest however it matches the atmosphere. I definitely recommend giving this a try!"}
{"text":"Took my son, Mike here for his 21st birthday and first drink (lol).  We sat in the patio area.  Everything was great.  I love the selection of beer and had to try quite a few.  My other son, Steve, ordered a gin martini with a twist and they even came back and asked if he wanted a twist of lime or lemon.  Attention to detail was great from the bar.  The appetizers were great and so was dinner.  

This was the perfect choice for the occasion.  I wanted something above a bar or a Fridays (I love Fridays so don't get me wrong), but I did not want a Mortons (which I also love).  I highly recommend Yard House."}
{"text":"Perfect place for wide variety of beers and ciders.  Fantastic food.  Excellent staff and service......except for Chelsy.  She is so rude she will ruin your meal."}
{"text":"The food was amaaaaazing! I got the BBQ Bacon Burger and my date got the Chicken Enchilada Stack, really great choices. Our server Jennifer was fantastic. Probably one of the best servers I've ever had. She was very accommodating! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"9/10 

Great staff! They are so friendly and helpful. The food is very delicious and they give you a good amount for the price. 

The cheese curds appetizer is so addicting. Its the perfect amount of crunchy and gooey. They give you a lot too. After sharing this appetizer with my boyfriend I was already getting full. 

The mac n cheese is very good and the portions are great. 

Would recommend eating here. They have a very wide menu."}
{"text":"Awesome. Poke Stack is great. The staff has been great and friendly. Must stop. Great atmosphere. Kaya is awesome behind the bar.  

Got our Thai Chicken Pizza. Awesome also. This is a must stop for scratch made food in Vegas.

One more edit. My wife Becky just said this is the best pizza EVER!

Gotta try it."}
{"text":"We came here because it was close to where we needed to be and no wait. 
They have a huge menu, with tons of beer, most of which are decently priced. 
The food wasn't too bad. I ordered the surf and turf burger. Which is lobster on a burger..sounds amazing right?
Not so much. The burger was just sorta plain. The boyfriend got the teriyaki burger. Sauce was yummy, but again the burger was just ok. 

Judging on this I wouldn't come back next time I was in Vegas. There are much better places around in my opinion."}
{"text":"If I could rate it no stars I would.  We came on a Friday night, sure it was busy, which we didn't mind. We sat down and ordered our drinks, I wanted to make sure they had the beer I wanted, after saying they did, they brought out the wrong one. I sent it back, they came back and said, sorry we don't have that beer.  Ordered our meals, came out ice cold and over cooked! How does that even happen? Sent it back, second one came back over cooked  as well, at that point I said forget it and to not even bring out another one.  Luckily they comped the meal, I didn't even get to eat. Will definitely not be going back."}
{"text":"6 Beer Sampler, Belgian, awesome! I loved the Petrus Aged Red the best! It has a strong and sweet berry flavor. The dessert was fabulous! I had the brownie sundae, well worth the 15 minute wait to order, and it would be enough for three people easily!"}
{"text":"We used to go there once a week. We would have a couple of appetizers, the steak sandwich and a few beers. This was the spot to go to before enjoying a movie. Then along came the corporation that owns Olive Garden and bought them out. The ONLY thing poditive that I can say is that the place is really clean! The food prices have gone up, and the portion sizes have been reduced. The service has gone to the birds. It was so bad that after finally receivieng our drinks, we simply paid for them and left. It's a shame that yet another one of my favorite spots has gone by the waysde in the name of Corporate Greed. We will not go back!"}
{"text":"We have been here twice and both times the food, drinks, and service were excellent. The selection of beer is obviously amazing and so is the food menu. The crab cakes are amazing with their special sauce. We also had tacos and a pizza both great. It's a refreshing atmosphere with lots of style and also offers TVs for sports. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I live in north Phoenix and believe me there needs to be a lot more quality dining out here. This is a gem. The atmosphere is tops. The food is consistent. The management actually cares. It's just a cool place all the way around! A lot of corporate establishments seem to yank popular things off the menu cause it's just not trendy anymore. Every single thing I have had at this place was delicious! Not one other restaurant has pulled that off. A place you can actually count on for a good evening. High five to the Yard house!"}
{"text":"I loved the fact that the Yard House has vegan and vegetarian items on the menu!  The vegan Gardein Orange Peel Chicken is totally awesome!  They have an entire Gardein menu that is both vegan and vegetarian.  One caution though:  make SURE that if you order the super-yummy Gardein Orange Peel Chicken that you specifically say you want the VEGAN orange peel chicken.  They also serve this dish as a regular menu item and you don't want to make the mistake of getting real chicken thinking you are eating vegan.

The service was good, the vegan/vegetarian dishes are awesome."}
{"text":"I came here in September for a game. This place has a great beer selection lots of tv's. By the way the food is great to. The Lobster, Crab & Artichoke Dip is a must get for a Appetizer."}
{"text":"Love this place! Quality food and a nice varied selection of beers. I only lyrics wish it cost a little less."}
{"text":"I couldn't decide if I should give 3 or 4 stars and I docked two stars for these two reasons: They are just a chain restaurant and they charge too much for a pint of beer, $6 is too much in my eyes, especially if there is nothing special about it. And, I was told that they don't allow smoking on the patio at this location or the one at Glendale Westgate. Well, there is a bar right next door San Felipe and they allow smoking and it was still drifting over in the diners direction so I don't agree why you can't smoke on the patio. Isn't it enough that they baned smoking inside?

The Southwest Chicken salad was MORE than enough and was delicious as well as the macadamia nut cheese cake which was given to us on the house. The reason being was that the size of the cake slice was smaller than usual and the manager thought it wouldn't be right to sell a small slice for the $6.95 they charge. When the \"small\" slice was brought to the table Gratis it was still big enough that we had to struggle to finish it. So yes it was awesome!"}
{"text":"First of all I'm not a giant fan of corporate beer houses in a mall. BUT, I met a long time friend here for a couple drinks on a Wed night so here I am.

Didn't order food......The amount of taps they had was pretty outstanding. I usually jump from beer to beer, but they had Dogfish Head 90 minute on tap, so I stuck with that.  My friend, a die hard Jager drinker, orders doubles at a time, my girl, martini's.

Now being we are drinkers, and not cheap drinkers either you would think our table would get a bit more attention from our waitress in a empty restaurant on a Wed night.  NO.....we had to flag her down EVERY TIME to get a drink, many times her walking right past our table. We weren't a bunch of obnoxious frat boys.....3 people having expensive cocktails catching up.  We had to FLAG her down to get water as well.......pfffffftttt. 

I had my rating at 3 stars but after reading this I knocked it down a star because I'm ticked off again because of our experience."}
{"text":"We have visited this location more than 25 times in the past couple of years. As a family of 5, with an infant, toddler, and 8 year old, we are never disappointed. The kids chicken is amazing and I am willing to admit I steal pieces of off my kids' plates. I usually have the Bearnaise sliders, but recently I tried the chicken Thai pizza. I was not disappointed.  When my family comes into town, this is the staple restaurant we go to for dinner. No one has ever had poor food. I will tell you that my sister did have an experience where she ordered something, they came back and told her they were out, she ordered something else, they came back again because it was out, then ordered again and they comped her bill without her even complaining. That's how much they care about making it a great experience. The noise level can be a bit loud if you go in the evening, but my favorite place to eat is outside (unless it's 100 degrees). There are many TVs for avid sports fans to watch while you wait for the food."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to walk across the street and grab a drink on a slow weekday about a half hour before closing. We, combined with two other people way across the dining room, were the only ones there. The other people left and we decided we should go too. (Being in the service industry we know what its like) Unfortunetly, I ended up leaving my brand new phone on the table and didn't realize it until we were home and they were already closed. I went back the next day as soon as they opened and was told they didn't have it. (We were they ONLY ones there) I asked them if they could please ask whoever was working or possibly check video footage if they had it and was met with a very rude, 'sorry can't help you.' 

Not good, not good at all...

I guess one star for the beer selection?"}
{"text":"Our server Chuy and our young host....great customer service!!! Smiles and great attitude to go along with being professional and knowledgeable. 

Some of the bartenders need to be aware of their customers watching. My drink arrived, after I watched one bartender sniff & sip a beer that was headed out before my drink.  I also watched the bartender complain about putting a sugar on the rim of my drink, as they didn't have \"time\" for that! I hate giving negative feedback..... HOWEVER, this is called the service industry for a reason! Buck up and do your job, do it well or find another one."}
{"text":"Wow I had no idea! I thought this was a drinking place I had no idea it has such a nice, fancy dining experience. It appears to be close to fine dining although my friend and I sat at the bar and racked up a $80 tab with just two drinks and a few appetizers. Everything tasted great, the food was fancy and fresh, it is not chain restaurant style food. It's fresh and stylish and worth a few extra bucks. I really liked this place, except it was so dark I could not get good pics of my food for Yelp! Yard House was a treat I for sure recommend it."}
{"text":"Expensive bar food. Large selection of expensive craft beer on tap. They do not allow Vaping in the bar or restaurant. They do not have any UFC fights on in the bar eventhough the yardhouse is inside red rock a station casino."}
{"text":"Yard house located in Town Square shopping center.
the place is BIG and spacious.
on friday night expect 40mns to be seated (what happened to us yesterday lol) 
the covered patio (heated) is spacious as well.
our waiter was Kerry, he was funny, his service was excellent!
I ordered Chicken Nachos, the guys Tortilla soup and shrimp/calamari diablo!
Nachos are enormous, had to share ... it was very good, well served. Generously topped with beans (not muchy hey hey), guacamole, parsley, cheese, onions...
my friend love his dish the shrimp diablo, black spaghetti with a little kick of hot!
our clam chowder soup was yummy with actually pierce of clams and potato!
my truffle fries so so good, in LA i remember their fries being very skinny tiny like a match... 
Guys went wild and had dessert (me i couldn't breath lol)
peach/apple cobbler and home made brownie with caramel ice cream.
i tried both and it was too sweet to my taste
the brownie was big, didn't like it much. was little chewy and borders were dry 
Looks like their Happy hour 3pm to 6pm offers great deal :)
if you are in town! this is a nice place to dine.
all taste would be satisfied. Pizza, Pasta, burger, nachos, tacos what else? Bon Appétit"}
{"text":"Went there last Sunday for apps.  Ordered the fried calamari, garlic noodles..... both of the dishes were nicely seasoned and served hot.....yummers! Next  the shitake lettuce wrap, fried Mac and cheese......meh, nothing special, the mac and cheese were warm at best, and the lettuce wraps were over seasoned, too salty, my son ordered the enchilada stack, nice presentation I thought, taste.....would have been better had the dish served hot. The trio of desserts plake was really tasty. All in all was good as corporate food gets."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Good beers. The food however is mediocre , the  beef dip sandwich to Bready and the beef had no flavor."}
{"text":"The patio is great! We had an amazing waitress who did well with suggestions as it was our first time. The pear cider is delish!!"}
{"text":"while in AZ visiting friends i was introduced to the yard house. wow! i wish there was one in michigan. this place was amazing. i couldn't stop staring at the bar. i wanted to try them all!

the beer menu is slightly overwhelming however i managed. i chose a flight to start out and because i have never 'tasted' beer before. it was quite fun and there were some interesting brews. i was not a fan of the apricot beer and the apple cider was ok at first but then got to be too much. 

the one beer i did enjoy was the breckenridge agave wheat (i'm pretty sure that's what it was called i had to google it). it was excellent. 

i ordered the avocado swiss burger which was amazing and the fries were killer. i tasted some sweet potato fries which really really good, i will have to order my own next time!"}
{"text":"The service was great, the food was good. My husband's burger came out medium rare instead of medium well. The manager made it right quickly and even comp'd our entire check. We assured him that wasn't necessary, especially since I ate my food! But he insisted and couldn't apologize enough. Now that's customer service. It was our 2nd time there and we will co to us to go back whenever we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"Except for the blip in obtaining a table for 8, the manager stepped forward and accommodated our situation expertly. Our waiter was terrific and got us started with beverages and menus. I had the Maui Pineapple Chicken, which was moist and flavorful. The dipping sauce was great too. Others at our table had Sea Bass, Salmon, Fish and Chips, and burgers, and all were very satisfied with their choices. Excellent array of beer and wine selections too. Definitely will visit this restaurant again."}
{"text":"The garlic noodles and dessert is overrated. Also took an insane amount of time to wait for. For drink refills, I was practically choking on my food before she came by to give me watered down ginger ale. Waitress kept trying to give our food to another table, and even when standing next to her, our whole table telling her to put the food down, she still moved to put it on the other side of our table. Only after she put it down and three of our group picked up the plate to move it did she grab it and put it where we initially wanted it to go. The food is WAY to salty. I may as well lick a salt rock.

The calamari was great. It was tender and not overly fried. Excellent flavor.

The dessert I had was the peach apple cobbler. The mini creme brûlée was bigger than the three spoonfuls of pie and hunk of ice cream. The crust was crunchy and the ice cream was dripping a little more than I cared for by the time it got to me. The tart fruit slices were met with an insane amount of sweetness at the bottom. The ice cream's taste was nice, but I'm not sure where in the dish the caramel came from.  It was more appetizing than the steak.

Bring a jacket. No matter where you sit, once they open the door, everyone is freezing cold."}
{"text":"Came in at 10:15 p.m. and was told that the wait will be 35 minutes. We got seated 10 minutes after. Under-promised and over-delivered. Perfect way to do business.

We came here for the Happy Hour. The amazing thing is that the \"appetizers\" here are nothing short of greatness. We got the classic sliders (protein style), ahi poke, spicy tuna style (2), calamari, chicken lettuce wrap, and ahi sashimi.

The sliders are similar to any other bar food. The ahi tuna, spicy tuna roll style was amazing. Presented beautifully as well. I think the portion of the calamari was huge for $6. The chicken lettuce wrap alone will hit all of your taste buds! Also, the sashimi here is amazing! I can't wait to arrive again!

Our server was Bryan, and he got a great tip to accommodate his service!"}
{"text":"Excited to return to our usual Dinner place, we arrived, and slight wait, but tolerable.  Ordered drinks, and appetizer.
Wine had to be returned, because it was so sour, but our waitress quickly replaced with a great one.  Everything was going great until dinner.  We ordered three salads, one with corn, two without, got two with one without. The BBQ Bacon Burger was overly greasy, but had a great flavour.  The french Dip tasted like canned meat, and it was cold.  When asked if they could heat it up, they delayed then said they would remake it.  when asking the manager, if it was real beef, you could tell by the look on his face he was unsure as to how to respond.  He stated it was prime cut, and would happily remake the sandwich; in which they did, but even the  remake wasn't edible. Should have gotten 3 steak sandwiches.  Overall just disappointing."}
{"text":"I'm a Las Vegas local ... I looked online and saw a happy hour between 10pm-close and when I came they told me and a friend to go to another yardhouse in town square because they didn't honor the happy hour on the yardhouse website"}
{"text":"I got to meet up with Mandy and Anju , two lovely friends that I hadn't seen in forever, and we decided to go to Yard House as it has some pretty good happy hour specials. We go there just in time as happy hour was ending in 15 mins. We were seated immediately and ordered pretty quickly so that we could get those happy hour prices. We were pretty bummed that we were not allowed to order two drinks each those, (darn AZ laws) but end in the end it didn't matter because we could barely finish one. Sad, sad, sad lol.

We ordered a ton of stuff. Classic sliders, chicken nachos, spinach cheese dip and moo shu egg rolls. WOW! This is what happens when you go somewhere and you are hungry and your eyes are definitely bigger than your stomach. My favorite were the sliders and the moo shu egg rolls. I had two sliders and one egg roll and they were both pretty good. The nachos and the dip were also tasty and we did end up with alot of food leftover, even after we made a nice dent in all of it. Note to readers, Yard house portions are pretty big, which is never a bad thing!

It was a great evening with two fabulous ladies that I hadn't seen in awhile. Get there early so that you can enjoy happy hour. It's well worth it."}
{"text":"came here to celebrate  my cousins birthday

{"text":"This is a great place to watch sports and eat without being hassled. The hostess Alexis was a lot of fun and very personable and makes you want to come back to eat and drink and watch sports. The manager Jay was very accommodating. And our waitress Kylie was sweet and very helpful."}
{"text":"Pure Bliss.  For all beer fans try the Straffle Hendrik Quadrupel.  11% but smooth no harsh aftertaste.  Baja Shrimp Tacos were extremely tasty.   I have been to Yard house over a dozen times and each time they deliver!!"}
{"text":"Extensive beer list to the point that you never know what to order. Also have an extensive menu with lots of variety to choose from.  This place is open late, great place to grab a drink at midnight."}
{"text":"An old friend of mine decided to have a going away dinner at this Yard House and it was a wonderful night here!

The California Roll is a \"cake\"! I thought that was pretty awesome. The servers are very interactive and professional. I also enjoyed the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"The beer selection is fantastic but the food was just ok. We ordered kale caesar salads and there were literally 5 little pieces of kale among the romaine leaves. I was picturing a salad made up mostly of kale so that was disappointing. I also got salmon on it and while the salmon was cooked perfectly, it was one of the smallest pieces of salmon I've ever seen on an entree salad."}
{"text":"Yardhouse is one of my favorite happy hour choices. The beer selection is huge and the food option is extensive as well. Half price appetizers during happy hour and over 10 items to choose from. I always have a hard time choosing because they offer some great choices. Lettuce wraps are always a must and only $5(ish) during happy hour."}
{"text":"Corporate blandness redeemed by many vegetarian options.

With a name like yard house and the huge beer selection one might overlook the food here on first thought as I did. I was wrangled to go here on a triple date. 

On first glance at the menu I saw the usual burgers, salads and sandwiches one would expect. But I also saw a section called Gardein, which has menu faux chicken veggie items. From faux wings, rice bowls, pizzas and salads all with fake Gardein chicken. 
WE started with two orders of the Gardein wings $9.95 each. One order buffalo and one Jerk. The jerk ones were a bit bland but had a nice fried crust to them so they were satisfying. The Buffalo ones were a bit soggy from the sauce but overall a nice app.

For my main I selected the Ahi Tuna Sandwich 13.95 Seared very rare. It comes with a pencil holder of thin fries. The fries were good but a bit cool when they arrived, not the freshest. The Tuna was nicely rare and a pink color as it was not a the best sashimi grade. All together it did not work as the caramelized onions and Swiss over powered the tuna. Dismantle the sandwich, eat the tuna with soy and then the bread with the cheese, tomato, spinach alone and it works as two good mains.
 
My date had the Gardein rice bowl, (11.95)  the name is apt as it was mostly rice, with a generic soy based sauce, and mixed veggies. It was decent and nice it was on the menu but not gourmet, it needed some spice and less rice more vegies. 

I also did like the fact they had a local seasonal beer on tap (4 peaks pumpkin porter)

It was also nice they could split an app 3 ways with no issue at all. So bring in a group and paying will not be the usual headache."}
{"text":"I never have any issue with service or food at this location. 

My latest visit, our waiter Benjamin S. was one of the best servers I have ever had at any restaurant. He had the most personality and checked up on us while making jokes each time. I could not stop laughing.

My favorites at yard house are:
Lobster crab artichoke dip, chicken tortilla soup, chicken enchilada stack, & they have really good fish too. 

Benjamin brought out a dipping sauce for our sweet potato fries which were to die for. It was a bacon maple cream sauce. Omg I want some right now thinking about it. 

Beers are great. I'm not much of a beer drinker but I do appreciate their fruity beer selection. The prices are pretty reasonable as well."}
{"text":"Enjoying a date night.  We had some great food and drinks.   The presentation is always on point.  The only reason I was considering a 1 star discount, was the service was pretty good, but not amazing."}
{"text":"Happy hour is sick,
But you already knew that.
You just want my thoughts.

Half off select food.
We got the classic sliders,
Buffalo wings and

The fried mac and cheese.
The portions were generous
And enjoyable.

The Mac and cheese though...
Don't eat friend foods but, I did
Go in on that dish.

Great place to watch sports
Like the kings getting smacked up
By the golden knights.

Oh, poke nachos
Should be on your order, yeah?
If not, go change that."}
{"text":"Great service, delicious food, and awesome beer. Anytime and all of the time! Whether just for a casual lunch or a date night, coming here always feels like a well rounded and enjoyable dining experience. Please don't ever leave Westgate!"}
{"text":"Okay, I get it. I'm not suppose to like this Yard House because 1) it's located in the chichi, pretentious mall better known as Scottsdale Fashion Square and 2) the patrons are mostly chichi, pretentious folks who shop at the chichi, pretentious mall. But seriously, if you're jonesing for some beer and grub and the need to watch a few of the Sweet Sixteen match-ups, there's no better place than the Yard House.

From 3-6 every day, they have Happy Hour with $3.25 pints (they claim to have over 200 types of beer) and half priced appetizers. The best thing is that you don't even need to sit at the bar to enjoy this deal.

The only beef I had with this place was our waiter who insisted on calling us \"girls.\" \"Hey girls, how are you doing?\" \"Hey girls, what are you having today?\" But as that was followed up with, \"Hey girls, I'll need to see some ID,\" I guess he's not so bad."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon the Yard House on our way to purchase tickets for the Highroller and I'm so glad we did! 

The food was delicious! I ordered the Grilled Cheese and Tomato Bisque and added avocado! 

The drink selection was impressive. Everyone in your group is bound to find something they like. They had a ton of beer selections and they offered smaller sizes so you could try a beer before ordering a full pint."}
{"text":"Ok first the last review I posted I just realized  was for the Ale House not this place. 

Now for the Yardhouse. Usually the place good but tonight they bombed out. 
1) waiter needs to go back to bussing tables he's not ready to be serving 
2) nothing worse than just staring your salad and the entree comes.  Really hate that and it's partly due to inexperience with a server who puts the whole order in at once. 
3) don't take my food you brought too early and set it in a warmer for whatever time it takes us to eat our first round and then bring it back. When we tell you we want fresh you better do so or you will get a nasty review like this one 

So bottom line you guys screwed the pooch and lost another group of customers"}
{"text":"The service was good and the food was excellent. Everything was hot and fresh. The cocktails were soooo yummy. I've been several times and never been disappointed."}
{"text":"The waiter was very nice , but the booths were so cold. We all got something different from the menu and didn't like any of it .."}
{"text":"Got to yard house at 6pm with group of 15.  Everyone ordered and got their drinks in 15 minutes (except me). Reminded waitress 3 times. She continued to take other orders instead of getting my forgotten beverage. Finally got it 34 minutes later.

Didn't see any sense if urgency or get a 'sorry'."}
{"text":"I have never been so disappointed by this place until now. I went here with my family and found what seems to be tin foil in my food! When addressing the waitress she was very nice about it and she went directly to the manager. When he came to our table first thing he said was he doesn't know how it got in my food and it wasn't part of the recipe. . Well no shit..and then he said he won't charge that on our bill.. well I hope not!! But instead he doesn't offer a new plate or anything and just smiled. Poor management.. even the waitress asked if we wanted something else after the fact. Never coming back again who knows what else is in there food!"}
{"text":"Omg thus was my first time here. Wow the food was all really good but 1 thing the frinch dip was tough but my dad still ate it. The beer is very cold as well as the wine. Server was out standing. I will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"The best ala cart tacos in the world! Great menu here and awesome service! The biggest variety of tap beers! Korean beef tacos and chicken tacos all day! Alaskan Amber on point!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out since it was close by the Linq. Me and my friend shared the garlic noodles with shrimp and lobster and the spinach dip which was offered during happy hour special. The food was really good. I enjoyed the pita chips that accompanied the spinach dip, as well as the noodles. The noodles were rich in flavor and full of meat. Surprisingly they weren't stingy on the seafood! The drinks were good as well and service was cool. Would come back again."}
{"text":"Wow.  What a beer selection.  Popped in for a drink prior to hitting the AMC theater next door.  The menu looked impressive, and there are several lengthy reviews lately which really seem to cover it.  The ambience is pure sports bar, with enough screens around the room to view your favorite game.  Plenty of seating, both indoors and out, as well as a sizeable bar. Will definitely go back to check out the food."}
{"text":"It's my fave place to eat at Town Square. I'm not a big beer drinker but they have a huge selection and I do try new ones whenever I go. I always try to hit Happy Hour or Reverse Happy Hour so we get a good deal.

Now that they've changed their menus they have a lunch special which isn't bad! I definitely recommend this place. It's not as snobby as Blue Martini and it's just chill. A great place to hang out with your friends!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the beer selection & tacos. I go here quite often if I want decently priced, quality food, as well as a nice dark & not-so-noisy atmosphere. Would definitely recommend for semi-casual dates and birthdays."}
{"text":"Love this place for the beer. I really dig the fact that they have so many beers ready to pour. Hubs and i can sit and drink all kinds of beers in one night. The bartenders are great. Im not the biggest fan of the food. Just the beer!"}
{"text":"Me and a couple of my friends stopped at yard house on Tuesday night around 9:30 for they're happy hour, before we got there we double checked on yelp to see what time it started and it said 9pm to close. Once we got there we checked on the menu and it said 10pm instead of 9. We proceeded to ask the waiter and let him know that it said 9pm on yelp. He confirmed that it started at 9pm. A couple minutes later he came back and notified us that it started at 10pm. We told him about the mistake on yelp and hoped he would let accommodate us for the error and false advertising on the yelp account, especially since there was only 10 min to 10pm. He told us that the yard house yelp page was handled by yelp itself and not the company so it was not their mistake. We were pretty disappointed and annoyed that no one was taking responsibility for the mistake."}
{"text":"Yard House consistently serves up a wide variety of good food, and of course, has a huge selection of fresh beers on tap.  If I'm in the mood for beers I can't find anywhere else, this is the only place to go.  This location is particularly big and always has fast service for lunch with plenty of open seating."}
{"text":"Got to love a place with 100 or so brews on tap. And that's the Yard House. Even though there's a bunch of outposts of this Irvine, CA based chain in LA (including the new LA Live location downtown) I've never been to Yard House before. Shame on me, I know. They've got their own microbrewed beer in two varieties and a great Late Night Happy Hour so prices are really good if you come in late for drinks or apps. Another thing I like is you can get a sample shot of any brew for a buck. Which is what I did as i sampled four different beers including Vegas' own Sin City. Bartender was actually upfront with me that it wasn't that great a beer but when in Vegas, try the local stuff and for a buck, why not? So I tried the Sin City Amber and it was fair alright but at least it wasn't downright atrocious. Surprisingly, Tenaya Creek isn't offered here. They should do something about that. Also odd. They carry Gordon Biersch. Don't they have their own brewpub just a couple miles away? Waste of taps in my opinion. Plenty of variety and a chance to really improve your brew knowledge. I've got to finally check one out in the LA area sometime soon especially that the LA Live location is now open."}
{"text":"Good place to get beer. Good service every time, however.... the past few visits have been a disappointment. The food is just too salty for me. I had the shrimp rice bowl, it literally tasted like an entire jar of soy sauce was dumped in there, with extra salt. Hubby had the lamb burger and was pleased with it."}
{"text":"YES.

Delicious. Amazing service, great food and an overwhelming selection of delicious beer on tap (never something to complain about). 

Unfortunately, I was just visiting a friend and can't go here on a regular basis but I will be back as soon as I can. We were here in the middle of the afternoon for a late lunch and it wasn't busy at all, but I can imagine the place is just packed during dinner time, or at game time. I ordered the burger with Gorgonzola cheese and was very pleased with it. A little expensive for a burger, but it was delicious. Besides the price, our only complaint was that they didn't give us enough of their delicious french fries!"}
{"text":"Not bad, not fab..our waiter was not much of a \"people-person\"..difficulties ordering No Onion..
My friends enjoyed the Vamp-Tacos..Menu had many options including Sashimi, Calamari..worked good enough for a 9pm meal on a Friday night in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"April 3rd, 2011 (10pm Happy Hour)

Ordered:
Traditional Wings
Bernaise Sliders
BBQ Chicken Pizza

Pros:
 * Good Happy Hour Menu Selections (including brews)
 * Decent sized portions
 * Lively atmosphere 

Cons:
 * Super Packed
 * Slow Service
 * Expensive for happy hour (food)

Tips:
* new on the menu : Ahi Sliders !
* order your water with lemon to help cleanse you of that food smell after grubbing on finger foods. It's a natural antibacterial cleanser.
* Scan Life avail. for those with Smartphones... its on their coasters !!

  Okay, this place is another one of those places where service is not really a concern.  Service was a bit slow, but what do you expect from such a busy place during happy hour?  The food is good, especially the Bernaise Sliders (comes with fries).  I found it disappointing that there I wasn't asked how hot I wanted my wings.  I guess I've been spoiled with Buffalo Wild Wings.  I didn't get a chance to sample the pizza, but my friend ate up every last piece and had no complaints.  Happy Hour selection is pretty broad.  The prices are a bit higher than most happy hour menus, but the portions make up for it.  Other choices include Ahi Poke Stack, Domestic pints for $3.50, and Calamari.  A great place for late night eats with friends/co-workers. I'll be back for more for sure!"}
{"text":"Celao was hands down one of the best most genuine servers I've had. My friend and I appreciated his excellent hospitality and enjoyed our meal very much so. Thank you!"}
{"text":"After a less than desirable experience at another location we ended up here! EXCELLENT from start to finish. Our server was so polite and attentive through our entire dining experience and was able to accommodate every request we had. Consider this your place for a good meal if you're a local or visiting."}
{"text":"The ambience of Yard House is absolutely what you want for your Happy Hour dining. A very simple yet modern place to enjoy some good American eats. The music brings you in with some classic rock (the good stuff). Our server Rodney was super awesome the same time. He explained the wings perfectly (even though I had a lot of questions for just wings). But boy when these came out. I sure was happy. You get 10 for only $6. The Buffalo is tangy and a perfect combo for a HH cocktail. My bf got the skinny margarita (x2) and I tried the new blackberry smash. It was sweet and tart but good for a summer afternoon. My bf got the earthy and robust choice of the Jerk sauce. The service was excellent. They took care of us really well. My BF even said we have to come here more often for Happy hour."}
{"text":"Decent service and a large menu. A good place to go for beer fans when you're out of town and in good-beer voids like Phoenix.

I had the Hawaiian Poke stack, which was okay. Not sushi restaurant level but edible."}
{"text":"I am wavering between 3 and 4 stars.  Because there is nothing decent on the strip and this place was able to accommodate my vegan choice, I will give it a 4. 

The service (which I don't like to dock for unless it is atrocious) is what I remember the most.  There were staff members everywhere who all looked busy...but doing what?  They rushed around like busy bees but none of them seemed to have a dish or menu or tray or...?  

They did have A LOT of beer.  I don't drink beer but if I did, it would be the mecca.  The menu was half interesting \"farm to table\" American fare.  To be honest I don't like American food, my husband does.  And he didn't LOVE his \"farm to table\" wings.  I ordered a vegan burger but when I started to order fries, they admitted the oil is shared.  Glad to know, and not interested.  I am sure this is the case at most places and it sicks me out.  Vegan burger was tasty, salad was fine.

Here is the good stuff - the menu is such that basically anyone could find something that is suitable.  The beer and drinks are plentiful.  And the prices, compared to what is surrounding the place, are not horrid.  Also there wasn't a wait.

It is down a pedestrian only \"street\" so make sure to look for the arrows."}
{"text":"Chicken nachos are a must! I normally go over happy hour for a cheaper beer selection; they have TONS to choose from. If you're feeling daring order a yard or half yard. This location is weirdly placed under the carport area, but has a great patio if you're stopping in after shopping. The service can be a little spotty, but the food and beer makes up for it. They have a lot of TVs so if youre going for a sporting event you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"If the food wasn't so darn expensive I'd give 5 stars. So many beers, so little time! We went on a Tue & it wasn't that crowded at all until the hockey game ended. We sat at the bar.

Food:
- Grilled artichoke appetizer was $9.75. The chips were great. Loved the dip. But only 1 artichoke head split in 1/2? For over $9 at least put 2 on the plate.
- Parmesan crusted chicken was $16.95. They stack 2 pieces of chicken on top garlic mashed potatoes & the whole thing is surrounded by sauce with mushrooms & sun dried tomatoes.

Drinks:
- My friend got a red or black velvet. I think it was red. It was fruity & smokey. Not my style but he liked it. About $5.
- My other friend got some cherry beer. It was sweet & very cherry flavored. Again, not my style but of course he liked it. About $5.
- My friends then got some kind of orange beer with added slices of orange. I really liked this 1. Very tasty. They told me it's from a brewery out in Scottsdale. I remember my friend saying this 1 cost only about $3
- I drank a pomegranate mojito. It was good & there was plenty of mint. Mojitos make me feel like I'm drinking Listerine or gum. If I remember correctly this was over $8.
- I also got a margarita. Pretty sour but I always love them like that. 

The music was good. Is there really a jukebox? I didn't see 1...

Our bartender, Jason was friendly & helpful. He changed the channel for me when I asked. There are tons of tv's there! I have to say I did feel a little pressured to order a drink right away though. I like to take some time to look at the menu. Please don't jump down my throat & keep asking me to order a drink.

The bathrooms were plenty clean. The faucet on the left didn't want to work though. Even the girl working there who was straightening up admitted it's temperamental. I do like their sink once it works though.

Also, I think it's pretty cool that you can see the chefs working off to the side.

Read in 1 review about wrist bands. We were only carded 1 time & there were no wrist bands.

I really need to come back & try a desert. They sound like they'll be really yummy."}
{"text":"Great place for beer of course with over 160 beers on tap! It can work with kids but it's not really a kid friendly environment.  Food selection is wide and diverse and is usually really good but a little over priced for basically higher end bar food....my only real complaint is they get a little snooty and they seem to only hire male bartenders.... But that's true with all of them"}
{"text":"How great is a place where there is no smoking, plenty of beers to try and taste and drink and to top it all off prices that won't leave you broke? This place was a welcomed spot for a weary eyed traveler with his Italian friend. The food was outstanding - the sliders delivered a large portion with potato bread and the ahi tuna salad was perfectly portioned to fill in my remaining stomach area that wasn't already filled with beer!"}
{"text":"From the minute you walk in this place til the time you walk out our experience was awesome.  Some of the best food we had our entire trip.  We were greeted right away with friendly faces and smiles.  We had a larger party of 9 and they got us seated right away.  Amazing beer menus with 120 differents taps to choose from.  Let's just say I was in heaven.  Food all came out hot and together.  We each tried different menu items.  Each person in our group was extremely happy with our selections.  I got street tacos.  Yum Yum...  Short rib beef, blackened Mahi, and Volcano.  My wife had the fried chicken with potatoes and gravy.  Some lettuce wraps were killer and the steak sands just melted in your mouth.  Right off the.main strip between the Flamingo and the Linq.  Thanks for starting our trip off on the right foot.  
Stop in if you are looking for great food and reasonable price paired with great service."}
{"text":"Had the most amazing experience tonight at the Yard House! Johnny Patrick was our server and was absolutely perfect! Food was great, beer was great, service was flawless!"}
{"text":"Our lunch started off with the \"hostess\" who  barely acknowledged us. We were seated in the patio area. We  ordered our drinks and when they brought the drinks out spilled one on my daughter. The girl who spilled it brought out a  bar towel to wipe it up. I used my napkin on my glass and requested a new one. 
Our server took our orders. When I ordered (Mac and cheese)2 our server asked if I knew what truffle is. I responded that I do he said \"and you like that?\" in a condescending tone. Again yes, then he said \"ok you'll you  like it then\". After a long wait our entrees were brought out... No appetizers. When I inquired about our appetizers the girl rolled her eyes and left. 
Still waiting.... I asked for server. After a bit I saw the manager and called him over. He told me the server forgot to put in the order for the appetizers. That he would make sure entrees were remade. 
Finally we got food...it was good. The manager stopped by to check on us but we noticed he didn't stop by any other table. 
They did in the end comp the meal but no one ever apologized for our negative experience. 
As we were walking out the door the hostess yelled \"have a good one\""}
{"text":"The YardHouse chain of restaurants are generally consistent in terms of food and service. This location is a little unique in that it's located in a very high end mall. The location isn't as large as the Costa Mesa location, but seems larger than many. Service is pretty good if they are busy. If the are not busy, they somehow have really slow, inattentive service. 

Not bad, but there's fierce competition for $$ in this area and this is an average experience."}
{"text":"Service is OK. But I think for the price range this restaurant is we should have a higher impact as far as customer service. You either have one waitress who is on point or do you have a slacker. One thing I do have to say is when there is an issue management is amazing about addressing it even if it's not a direct complaint."}
{"text":"Want to give a shout out to awesome server Derrick. We were from out of town and he made our lunch experience great with his awesome customer service and personality. We enjoyed talking with him. Thank you Derrick!!!"}
{"text":"I went here last night. I'm always so amazed at how busy this place is!! No wonder, though, the food is amazing! Great atmosphere and decent pricing.
I live the Thai pizza! My friend had the ahi salad, she loved it.
I think it's so cool how they have the patio open with comfortable seating."}
{"text":"Food was awesome but server was the worst. Assuming the name on the receipt was the right guy, Manuel gave us horrible service. Did not really check on us. Refilled our waters once and had an attitude when we politely asked to split the checks. Love yardhouse and all the food but the service was not how it usually is. Very disappointed with that"}
{"text":"Love the environment, the food was amazing and the drinks were great! All of that with exceptional service to top it all off!"}
{"text":"Last night me and my boyfriend went out for dinner and it was packed! The wait time was super short though, regardless. I ordered a classic cheeseburger and my boyfriend ribs. His meal was great. He had no complaints! Mine came out pink and I asked for well done. When I told the server he was very apologetic but didn't need to be. The manager came out as well to introduce himself and apologize for the meal. It was no big deal at all but they staff was amazing. Our server particularly was very friendly, quick and had great recommendations. Probably the best location I've been to!"}
{"text":"Came here with the group of 18 for lunch after watching our friends proposal. It took about 20 mins to free up seating for our group which was to be expected. After getting seated we were met with our waitress which she took our drink orders and shortly after our meal orders. I ordered the surf and turf burger medium. Burger was great, patty was grilled just as I ordered and the lobster was plentiful. Not big on shoestring french fries because I'm a man of portion size but it didn't take away from the meal itself. Probably my favorite burger I've had there so far. Will be back soon"}
{"text":"Really good place. I've been here a few times before but not recently and a different location. They have really good food. I had the Thai Chicken salad; I wasn't expecting it to have noodles but it did. It was just spicy enough which was good. For dessert, we had the butterscotch pudding which was really good. They seem to have a pretty extensive drink menu too but I didn't have any cocktail this time. The service is good too; our waitress was very attentive and friendly. No complaints with this place!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were at Yard House today and the wait staff was so kind and accommodating to our needs. We are vegan, so sometimes it's hard to find more than just a burger. They had a really good number of vegan options, or vegetarian options that could altered to be vegan. They were also very knowledgeable about what was considered vegan and altered things to make our eating experience wonderful. The manager even came over and triple checked our order and everything. It was legit awesome. We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I love beer, so naturally while visiting the area, i was drawn to this place. 

The food is just OK. Which is neither bad nor good. 

The beer selection is STUNNING. It was dreamy. Their in house beers were also pretty decent. 

I don't know if I would come back to Glendale (maybe another concert, maybe if the Coyotes made it to the 2nd or 3rd round of the finals with my team), but I did enjoy the time I was there."}
{"text":"Great, had an amazing beer list, with specials. I had something German with cinnamon I think. It was incredible."}
{"text":"A little loud for me. Food just okay, nothing really special. Service was excellent. Good burgers but ice tea and arnold palmers  should be served in bigger glasses."}
{"text":"If beer is you thing then this is your place.  They have over a hundred beers on tap.  It would take you a month and a liver transplant to get through all of them.  It's a challenge I'd gladly accept.  Well not the transplant!  I've been here for both the evening happy hour and the late night happy hour and have had an excellent time.  The chicken nachos are so big they're a meal all to their own.  The chicken lettuce wraps are good and the Asian chicken salad is delicious and the flat bread to die for.  But the real reason I come here is beer.  So many great beers on tap.  I love Rouge Hazel Nut Brown!   It always tastes like another!  Super friendly bar tenders are waiting and willing to serve you up a plethora of suds that will satisfy even the most thirsty of beer drinkers.  It's no doubt why the bar is always full. However it doesn't matter if you sit at the bar or sit at one of their outdoor tables the service is always fast and the food is tasty.  I recommend checking them out the next time you're at Town Square."}
{"text":"Let me start off with - I love Yard House however, yesterday's experience was not the best. 
Our waitress' were super friendly per usual(Our original waitress went home and we got a replacement).
took 1hour and 20 min before we got our food. My sisters kids were turning into the snickers commercial. 
After 45 min - my sister asked the new waitress if the kids meals were coming. Waitress got the manager. 
He told us our food was delivered somewhere else and they were making our food now.
Had we not asked the waitress where our food was ... would anyone have ever noticed we hadn't  gotten our food? It was just super annoying because we had 2 hungry kids and The unexpected 2 hour lunch almost made me late for my doctors appointment. 
Manager comped our meal for the inconvenience - it was a nice gesture and I know shit happens but still annoying."}
{"text":"They advertise the Most Beers on Tap in town.  I can't verify that as true as I'm not from PHX, but they had at least 100 ready to pour.  I had a very tasty Chupacabra Pale Ale that was a Mexican import I've never seen before.  Looks like they have a late night happy hour, but I didn't see the details."}
{"text":"Got a chance to checkout the Yard House @ Red Rock this past Tuesday and let me say I was excited for this place to open.  To go back to my review of Yard House @ TS for a minute.. I've always loved the place.

1. Great Happy Hour Specials
2. For \"bar food\" it tastes pretty damn good
3. The atmosphere is filled with all different kinds of people 
4. The location is a short drive from my house

Enter Yard House 2.....

1. Same Great Happy Hour
2. Food and beer both tasted the same
3. The atmosphere seemed like everyone had left the office around 5 and wanted to catch a few drinks and some food before home (I'm good with that).
4.  The drive is a little further, but the location is awesome.

I thoroughly enjoyed our city's newest chain addition and look forward to visiting again soon."}
{"text":"Just wanted to write a review update since I've been enjoying my weekly Friday night dinners at Yard House.  I love the 4-7 Happy hour they have during the weekdays.  My close group of friends have been going every Friday and the food, service, and drinks are always consistent.  Server to server the place just delivers.

Poke Stack
Seared Ahi Sashimi 
Ahi Steak Sandwitch 

All personal favorites on the menu..... You add some Abita Purple Haze on tap, your in for a great night!"}
{"text":"Food was great today!  We always come here for happy hour.  Tejah is an awesome server!  She has a positive attitude and really took care of us.  We love this location and will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Our group enjoyed a fabulous lunch here this past Sunday. The patio is perfect for people watching on a beautiful afternoon. 

Appetizer: Crab Cakes. The guys really liked the crab cakes which appeared to be served with some sort of cream sauce with diced red and yellow bell peppers. 

Appetizer: Spinach Cheese Dip. This dip fits the standard and is served with crispy pita-esque bread pieces. 

I truly appreciate the large selection of Gardein entrees they serve for Vegetarians and Vegans that want to enjoy not-so- healthy bar grub like our omni friends. ** Be sure to note any dietary restrictions upon placing your order. I ordered the \"beef\" sliders original style and they came with cheese which was not mentioned on the menu. They gladly added a side of lettuce and the jerk and buffalo sauces to my plate. I adore there shoe string fries. 

My companions enjoyed their ahi tuna salad and steak entrees. 

As far as drinks go, there is a large menu sure to please everyone in your party!"}
{"text":"The Yard House has great food and customer service. Brittany was our server and she was amazing. She answered all of our questions and made great recommendations. For appetizers, we had the poke stack and blue crab cakes. Both were good, but the sweetness of the mango sauce served with the crab cakes was too overpowering for the dish. We had the Kurobuta pork burger and lamb burger for entrees. The pork burger has spicy candied bacon, white cheddar cheese, and blueberry ketchup (!!) on it. Wow. This has to be the best pork burger anywhere. This is a great choice. The lamb burger was good also but not as great as that pork burger. They are served with shoestring fries which are very average. Give me a crinkle cut fry any day. Now the cocktails. Woah! I had the Southern Belle and Tahitian Moonshine. Both were so good that they warrant a second glass, but be aware. I was done after two drinks. That moonshine is no joke. I even tasted the Timmerman's strawberry beer which was very good, and I'm not a beer drinker at all."}
{"text":"Yard house is our #1 go to for good food and vibes. When the weather is good we love to sit on the patio. They do have heaters and misters when the weather isn't perfect too. 
They offer a great happy hour from 3pm to 6pm offering half off drinks and selected, full sized appetizers. 
The food is always fresh and the service is always great. A few months ago my boyfriend and I were having a bad day and the server brought us out a complimentary dessert. I thought that was super sweet and it brightened our moods for the moment. Small gestures  like these remind me how nice people can be, and not just for an extra tip!
Friday and Saturday nights get busy so expect a wait. I like to come during lunch hour personally.
Parking is a little difficult. There is a parking lot but it is shared with Red Rock Casino, the movie theater and the surrounding restaurants."}
{"text":"This Yard House location here hasn't failed me yet, and I've taken at least three different colleagues here.

Great food, a billion beers on tap (okay, maybe not that many but it sure seems like it), and the atmosphere is great.   I love this location because it's in that potemkin village type setting  (Town Square) and it's nice most of the year to just walk outside.

Yard House is always my go-to and as you can tell from my check-ins, I also take friends here!    Different locations, same great food and service (which I have come to expect wherever I go now with YH).

When you need a brewski and you're just shopping your little feet out at Town Square, you should try this place."}
{"text":"So I had some friends come to stay in Vegas for the Rock N' Roll Marathon and I decided to take them to Yard House.   Always a great go-to place since they have everything, 145 beers on tap, and service is always impeccable.

Carnitas Enchilada Stack?   To die for.  That stuff is fantastic!  Even with the fried egg on top, and I probably would have never thought to throw an egg on top of an enchilada.

The one thing I was kind of annoyed with was that a friend ordered a Cuban roast dip sandwich.  It's supposed to be a hot sandwich.   The first time it came out it was barely warm.   Sent it back, and the manager came over to apologize and comp'd a drink which was actually amazing (and expected of Yard House's impeccable service).

However, when the replacement sandwich came out, it actually was only a tad warmer than before.  My friend was so hungry (they flew in from the East Coast) and it was 10PM here that she said she loved it (and it is a fantastic sandwich) but I was a little miffed about it.  YH never let me down, and that was a bit of a total bummer when I have guests.

Granted, my friends said that they'll still be back to try more Yard House, but I did wish that they figured out a way to get the cuban roast HOT before serving.  Especially in Vegas with no humidity, any hot items cool down super quickly and they need to be aware of that in the food prep business.

Anyways, impeccable service!  The food (sans the temperature piece) and beers were amazing.   Will definitely continue to be a patron of YH, but I was slightly disappointed with that experience."}
{"text":"If I were drinking, this place would probably rate as a 5 star.  And the food was done pretty well..... except for the fact that... well... it was done... pretty... well.

The calamari came out looking like either they were re-using oil or they had left it in the oil too long.   You don't fry calamari like fries where if they're a little too golden, it's okay.  Strangely enough, I tried their famous Mac & Cheese squared.... and it was great, except... it was a little over done too.  Strange.

Now I might update my review of them later since their service although good, was a bit inattentive at times, and it was crowded beyond belief.  Probably due to the Luke Bryan concert going on at the Red Rock that night.  Yeah yeah, I know.  I was like... Luke who? (some country singer for those that don't know).  Hey... what can I say, I'm not a huge fan of country.

So the drop in stars really comes from the food side and a little bit on the service end since the beer selection was great and that actually came out in a timely fashion.

Here's to hoping that next time, the food is done right."}
{"text":"Wow where do I even start? 
1. This was the longest I have EVER waited at a restaurant for my food to arrive. I have been here for a total of 2 1/2 hours. I even have enough time to write this review while I wait for my check to get split out which took an additional 30 minutes. By the way there was maybe a total of 8 people at the entire bar top.
2: I ordered an appetizer that never showed up and I actually forgot I placed the order. They forgot I placed the order too.
3. They made me pay $7/each for tacos because they don't have a vegan taco option and wouldn't let me substitute a custom taco WITH their vegan meat substitute which is significantly cheaper to produce and buy opposed to an actual animal. Think about it.
4. My bartender was rude and kept making comments back to me every time I pointed out how something was wrong. 
I told him I just wanted to leave and stop waiting around and he said \"me too\".
5. The chefs aren't wearing gloves
6. If there was a 0 star option I would've chosen it."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I don't get to go to it too often.  This is the place we bring anyone visiting us in Vegas.  The menu has a nice mix and the beer selection is amazing.  I have had a few different items here but I always end up getting the mac and cheese squared.  This stuff is a grown edition of the kids meal.  My wife likes to order the 
Chilean Sea Bass.  The beer menu can be daunting when you first see it.  Don't worry they offer beer samplers.  The samplers are hit and miss.  One time we went the sampler had 2 different Sam Adams and common hefeweizen.  Sometimes it can have some great selections.  They also have some cool beers blends.  I like to order the Dark Castle which is new castle and Guinness.  So if you have a friend or relative from out of town visiting take them to the Yard House, chances are they don't have one in their town.  Cheers!   Oh and if you go on the weekend, call ahead and reserve a table.  trust me!"}
{"text":"This place has pretty good food and an awesome beer selection. The service is usually good my only complaint is how overwhelming busy it can be on weekend nights. The Kona Coffee sundae is a must try (SO good)!"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant a bunch since it open a few months ago. The beer selection is truly amazing and the quality of the food is great too. The service tends to be good too but you can always get the slow server as with every restaurant. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because of the prices. The food prices are reasonable but the beers are spendy. I understand it is probably because of the ridiculous rent they must pay to be in the Red Rock Casino but it is still a bit annoying when you go there regularly. Anyway, definitely check it out if you have never been..."}
{"text":"Once you've been to one Yard House you've pretty much been to all the other ones. This location compared to the one I've been to before was a lot more laidback and chill. It didn't have that 'place to see and be seen' kind of vibe like the Yard House in San Jose's Santana Row has. This is more of a location to catch a game and catch up with friends in a casual environment.

Like all other Yard House's, they have a wide selection of beer and great appetizers perfect for sharing. 

Service was great and our server gave us great recommendations and always came by to check on us, which is always a plus in my book!

Can't go wrong with Yard House!"}
{"text":"Thanks Lee and Jonathon for the great service! Also the managers who accommodated a party of 18 on a busy Friday night. We were able to have a great 60th bday party for Sue. Our party was so disorganized and they were able to separate the checks into couples. Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Emily D was the best server I've ever had anywhere. She was attentive while not hovering. She was upbeat but not over the top. We were there during half priced apps but having been or still being servers ourselves, we believe you should tip on what the full check would have been. I'm pretty sure we tipped her more than the check as she was THAT good. I live in Maine, so trust me, I am not her friend, this is a true, unbiased report. We had the Chicken Nachos Grande, Cheese Curds and Margherita Pizza. Everything was fresh, tasted delicious and when I'm back in the area I will definitely stop here again."}
{"text":"Above average food

Above average beer selection

Above average prices

Good for groups

Limited Parking

Will likely go again"}
{"text":"GREAT seating for big groups. 

My daughter and I went here for dinner on a saturday night. It was packed, and her and I were eated on a booth that probably fit 20 people, seriously. I had the shrimp cocktail, and seared tuna plate and my daughter had the sliders. I had also a glass of cab and daughter had a shirley temple. My bill was about $66 not including tip and all.. By the time we left, It was an $80 dinner. Was it worth it? It was ok.. I think I could've gone to Johnny Rockets and had sliders and a soda for cheaper and also went to an AYCE sushi place for some tuna for about $20.. but, it's ok.. this was one of those far and few in between chances to eat here.. It's a bit over priced in my opinion for mediocre food."}
{"text":"We got your beer here !!! Really . . what do you want? They most likely have it.

I like this place for a good happy hour before a movie. The spinach & cheese dip is super tasty, and can feed 3 people for sure. The drinks are good also, and the prices are not too bad.

The staff is hit or miss, sometimes they are nice, sometimes they seem to just want to hurry you up and get the next table going. Also, even though you have a server, you might see 4-5 other people coming to bring you food or drink refills or asking if you need anything else. Kind of strange."}
{"text":"PRICEY! We stopped in and got a couple of apps, a beer, and a lemonade...$46. Too much. The apps were good, but not $46 good. We got the coconut shrimp that had a mildly coconutty flavor. No visible coconut on the shrimp itself. We got something else, but I honestly can't remember what it was if that tells you anything. The service was cool. I just didn't think the quality matched the prices."}
{"text":"This is my boyfriend Paden and I's local haunt, which should be a testament to this establishment in itself. We have recently become regulars with one of the servers, Garin, who is nothing short of a spectacular server. If you get him as a server, your experience and service will be unmatched! I'm also posting more recently because of the newer menu changes which are amazing! I would recommend the banh mi (sp?), the truffle cheeseburger, or my favorite, the new lamb burger with fried onions added (fat kid burger fantasies dancing in my head omnomnom). Garin also had me try the Hawaiian mule, which is, as eloquently as I can put it, totally amazeballs. YH makes the ginger beer in the mules in-house and it is soooo good and soooo worth trying! Don't be a square, go check it out!"}
{"text":"As they say, it's 5 o'clock somewhere. 

...And the place to be is Yard House. 

The Yard House is conveniently located between The LINQ and Flamingo. The concierge directed us there for a quality happy hour. I'm happy to say he was correct. 

We ordered a round of beers and three appetizers: calamari, nachos, and margarita pizza. Nachos were definitely worth it. It was a huge portion with tons of toppings. This was enough food to call it dinner. We continued to enjoy the beer specials until 7 p.m. They have LOTS of beer on tap - TOO many choices! That's a good problem to have. 

The waitress was exceedingly helpful and super upbeat/friendly. She gave us plenty of time to sit and enjoy without feeling rushed. We watched two football games during our visit. Essentially, we were table hogs. 

Anyway, I'd definitely recommend this place for happy hour, sports viewing, or beer in general. It's pretty much a classy sports bar."}
{"text":"Believe it or not, up until last week I had never stepped foot in a Yard House at all, at any place, or at anytime. We recently met some friends here and really enjoyed a pleasant and casual dining experience.

(+) Friendly and accommodating service. Our waitress was funny and outgoing and really added to our time here. Our drinks never went empty and we were checked up on periodically. Great service.
(+) Food was tasty and portions were good. I decided to just try the Classic Cheeseburger cooked medium and it was very tasty! Chicken wings were plump and juicy. Chicken Nachos were outstanding as well! Definitely enjoyed some delicious food here!
(+) Nice laid back and casual atmosphere with plenty of TV's on sports (+++) and they offer some great Happy Hour specials!


This is a great spot for decently priced food and drinks in a fun and laid back atmosphere. We are already talking of going back in the next few days!
 
4 stars.

Definitely a fan and we will be back!"}
{"text":"1st time here! Really enjoyed this place. The drinks were AWESOME! I got a mojito while my partner got a Bloody Mary. (But on the expensive side since our drinks were $10 each but they were good size and did taste great). Our waiter was also great! I would highly recommend this place. I'll be coming back :)"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite before seeing The Hangover, wasn't amazed, but it was good. I think we really came for the beer selection, apparently it is the only place in Vegas you can get obscure Californian beers. 
I had mushroom encrusted halibut over truffle mashed potatoes.....it was good, but not as good as I imagined it would be. The artichoke starter was delicious though....
However, with all the amazing food choices in Vegas, I doubt I'll be back..."}
{"text":"Blerg.  

They have an asston of beers on tap.  Awesome. 

They have a pretty sweet-ass menu with strong diversity and well designed dishes.   Awesome.  

They have an efficient and polite staff.   Awesome. 

A bit costly but par for the style.   OK. 

Way too noisy.  Way too busy.   Way too big.    They can accommodate 300+ customers and apparently do exactly that on a Friday evening..        

So it's a good restaurant that I have a hard time enjoying when it's busy.       I like Yard Houses...   but only when there's hardly anyone there and I can sit at the bar and most of the seats are empty.      Take what you want from this review."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite restaurant. You have to try the nachos (huuuggge portion) and the truffle Mac n cheese. Omg! Delicious!! I always order the dinner size and take half of it back for lunch the next day :-) they have a whole menu full of beer they offer on tap. I love all the fruity wheat beers, but there's certainly a beer for everyone!!!  Happy dining."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. We say at the patio. Service was great and pretty quick for a Friday. We had seabass, filet, Mac and cheese and ribs. All delicious and good size portions. Menu is huge! Lots of beers to chose from."}
{"text":"Meh...I wasn't that impressed. Then again, I don't drink. Food wasn't bad, wasn't amazing either. I would say it's fairly average."}
{"text":"Very disappointing! I ordered a Cobb salad. It was served with tasty skirt steak. The lettuce was brown. The other vegetables were old tasting as well. Virtually no salad dressing. The manager came by and asked about the lunch. I showed him the brown lettuce etc. He did take my salad off the final bill. The server also was sub par. I had to ask for a refill on my iced tea and waited for service even though the restaurant was empty. Overall, the atmosphere was nice. The booth was spacious and comfortable. But the good just was not that great."}
{"text":"food was excellent, my steak was perfectly cooked to my desire, portions were large, our server Sydney was friendly & communicative with my kids & i , we sat outside on the porch & weather was lovely , basically we enjoyed & we will be back"}
{"text":"Out and about in Desert Ridge with a friend, we decided to try the Yardhouse. I'd heard great things, but was really impressed when we actually arrived. Obviously the beer selection was incredible. I'm a big IPA drinker and was very impressed that the bartender could make legitimate recommendations based on what I had said I liked. Also, as a recent transplant here from the East Coast, I was curious to sample some West Coast beers I hadn't tried before. Plenty to choose from. Definitely impressive. Not that we were there for food, but we had lettuce wraps during happy hour that were great!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times before, but once I turned 21 this has been one of my go-to spots for happy hour because the specials are amazing! The fact that they have mini take home happy hour menus makes it all the more tempting as well. 

Allow me break it down for you:
Happy hour is Mon-Fri 3pm-6pm, Sun-Wed 10pm-close

Domestic Pints - $3.50, Craft&Import Pints - $4.25-$4.75
Sliders served on a bed of fries  ($6.75): Classic, Bearnaise, Pastrami, Turkey, Veggie. Ahi is $9.95

Half priced pizzas: BBQ chicken, 4cheese, Ham & pineapple, Margherita, Pepperoni & Mushroom, Spicy Thai Chicken

Half priced apps: Crab cakes, Calamari, Cali Roll, Chinese Garlic Noodles, Chicken Nachos, Onion Ring Tower, Wings, Boneless wings, Veggie wings, Hawaiian Poke stack, Spicy tuna roll, Seared Ahi Sashimi, Chicken lettuce wraps, Fried chicken strips, spinach cheese dip, Moo Shu egg rolls

Doesn't that just BLOW your mind? It's like a plethora of cheap happy hour eats and you'll probably get full off of one order of sliders, or 2 of their apps. 

So far I've tried:
-Bearnaise sliders (Bearnaise sauce and fried shoestring onions on the patty w/ a side of very skinny fries that are tenderly cooked with a very light batter coating which gives them a perfectly crunchy exterior and \"juicy\" inside)
-BBQ chicken and Margherita pizzas (They pretty much taste as they should. Sometimes the BBQ chicken is a little too saucy for my taste though)
-calamari (Yum. Perfectly fried on the outside and melting on the inside. Served w/ marinara and, I wanna say tartar sauce? I usually go with the red..)
-Traditional wings (First and last time I had these, they were so spicy! My bf couldn't even handle them and he claims to love hot stuff, hehe. The thing that I don't like about these wings is that you can't choose how spicy you want them, so you have to be prepared for whatever they give you)

Everything I've tried has been pretty good so far and there is still so much more I have yet to try! I know my boyfriend has been having some sort of frenzy over the happy hour poke stack. He's gone to this location about 4 times in the past month, by himself, just to sit and eat the poke stack, so I can only guess how delicious it must be. 

Key points:
-Happy hour is awesome here
-Traditional wings are hot! (at least for me)
-Calamari is delectable
-French fries are close to perfect
-Great for groups
-Service has been pretty fast on the days that I've gone"}
{"text":"I came here around 11pm with a friend after partying it up at a wedding nearby. There was a good amount of people, but it wasn't crowded or overly loud considering it was happy hour. We sat at the bar area and ordered Tomato Bisque, sliders, Sea Dog Bluepaw Wild Blueberry, and a Lost Coast Tangerine Wheat. I really love their tomato bisque. It is organic (not a big deal), topped with a fried basil leaf, creamy, and oh soo flavorful. Even though it isn't on the happy hour menu, I always get it because I'm addicted! The Sea Dog Bluepaw Wild Blueberry was pretty good. I'll admit, I don't drink beer very often at all, but once in a while I like to try something new and I was surprised at how much it really tasted like blueberries. It was almost like having blueberry soda with a mild taste of beer. I highly recommend it if you don't really love the taste of beer very much because the blueberries cover it up a lot. The Tangerine Wheat was a little too bitter for my taste (think tangerine peels), but my friend thought it was refreshing. The sliders are a great deal at just under 7 bucks for three sliders and a good amount of fries. I didn't get it this time, but I usually get the Bearnaise sliders. They also have Ahi sliders, but they're a few bucks more.

Overall, I had a good experience at this location. It wasn't too noisy or crowded and the service was very fast."}
{"text":"Great place for happy hour. I have enjoyed many happy hours here with my teacher friends. Great food, fun martinis, and wonderful service.  I love that it it fun, music is perfect volume to hear and still talk."}
{"text":"Excellent beer selection.
Food was just OK. The nachos were excellent, the French Onion Soup was weak and the burger I had was good.
Service was passable but they were pretty busy."}
{"text":"Eh, just mediocre. Folks were nice, but slow service and there weren't many customers in the restaurant. The food isn't anything special. They aren't accommodating at all if you have any type of food allergies. The manager told us personally that they won't cook your food separately even if you have an allergy. With all of the restaurant choices in the area, I'll most likely eat somewhere else the next time I stay in Crocker Park."}
{"text":"Love this place!  It's great for date night or family night.   You must try the garlic fries, best I've had.  Other menu highlights include the gorgonzola burger, cuban pork sandwich, and the tacos.  The appetizers are so good we often just share several as our meal.  Great drinks and excellent service make this a fantastic lunch or dinner choice.  Don't forget to ask about the chalkboard beers."}
{"text":"Pretty bad. Im only giving a star because the manager Daniel was really nice and comped our meal. 
Our entire order came out COLD. We ordered 2 orders of frychos (nacho fries), the bacon burger and an order of truffle fries. Had to send back the entire meal because it was cold and then had to wait for them to re-cook everything. My fries weren't good and the burger was flavorless. My boys did say the frychos were ok. 
 Wont be returning to this location.
But thank u Daniel for being so nice and professional."}
{"text":"Our server David was awesome!!! very personable and funny. Happy hour starts at 3pm Monday-Friday with a selective happy hour menu and variety of cocktail beverages. This was my first time having a Moscow mule and it was not bad, didn't know what to expect but very refreshing. I like the mushroom wraps better then the chicken wraps but both are very good. Every time I come here there is always a new selection of food. That is good it shows they company likes variety and is not afraid to try new things."}
{"text":"Wow - guess we had a \"hit\" last week! We came today and my entire family ate without me! We sent the food back not once but twice and mine THREE times! Our plans were messed up because lunch became 3 hours!! Everything came out cold and looked microwaveable.  The waitress was seriously lost and the manager didn't care if we didn't even want to take the \"to go\" food home!  So many things happened I don't know if there is enough room in the review! Biggest thing is I explicitly said no dairy and they kept serving cheese and butter on everything! If I was truly allergic this would have been a big issue but still is for me as I don't eat dairy and ticks me off they blew of off by saying \"oh we accidentally put Parmesan on your fries and I think you ate it!\" Yes, that was management! Then the waiter noticed my drink looked bad and said, well \"do fayou want me to replace it.\" I felt bad and said no and he said \"ok\" and walked away.  Not one thing was taken off of our bill except for the meal that I didn't eat nor took home after the THIRD (3rd) try!  Adios!  This place shows consistent mismanagement all the way up the corporate ladder apparently!  Go somewhere else unless you only want JUST A BEER.  Their food is low on the totem pole along with their team and management."}
{"text":"Great place for drinks and food.  Extensive beer collection coupled with a great menu of munches I love the sushi related saplings they have a. Spicy tuna roll that will rock your socks off !  I live the framboise beers sweet and tasty!  Service is focused on the upsale which I really didn't like and left early because of , whatever I know they are busy.  Bar area was swamped and singles mingling for fun and atmosphere.   Location on west side makes it great for the Summerlin crowd.  Remember they have one at town square too!"}
{"text":"Once upon a time, Yard House was a great restaurant! And then Darden got its hands on it... I've been a fan of the atmosphere, the beer selection, the service and especially the food, since the Westgate location opened several years ago. Darden swore they wouldn't mess with what was a winning concept. It's been some time since my last visit, but dinner last night has me believing that things have changed.

As a gesture of thanks to a good friend of mine, I offered to take him to dinner at Yard House. It looked busy, which is normal. So we weren't shocked to hear the wait was 45-50 minutes. In the meanwhile, we decided to do some shopping nearby. We walked about ten steps out the door and the pager went off (like 45-50 seconds later!)

We were seated quickly and greeted by Cody. This guy is good at his job. He is laid back, very efficient, has a great table presence and is very likable. What happened next wasn't his fault...

The drink order got a little confused but my company's White Russian did show up. We were starving, and Cody recommended the Chicken Nachos. They were pretty good and very generous, but far from the best appetizer I've eaten here. In the back of my mind, I kept thinking, Chicken Nachos shouldn't even be on the menu. And then our HUGE side salads arrived. Normally, I would overlook this. For $3.25, it's a deal. But, we agreed that they were both ordinary and way too big.

When both entrees arrived, they were barely at room temperature. I've never been served something that was so far from an acceptable temperature range. I couldn't even twirl the noodles. They were one big clump on the plate surrounded by room temperature pieces of seafood. And my friends entree sounded promising, but seriously?! How long does Mac and Cheese have to sit around to get this cold? Both entrees were returned to the kitchen. They were also very quickly replaced and delivered by one of the managers, Tim. Tim did comp the appetizer on our check, which was unexpected but nice.

I feel I'm being generous with four stars. Honestly, had it not been for the great service, this would've been a middle of the road three star review. Nice save Tim & Cody. Crossing my fingers that the Darden influence on the menu stays minimal at best. I will be back because I know Yard House is better than this."}
{"text":"Huge selection 
Been there a few times now
Not a fan of their home brew

Food on the other hand, well above average bar fare type food and the servings are huge!
Service really great too!

Tons of big screens to watch your favorite Cavs / Indians  or NCAA tournament on

Good stuff!"}
{"text":"This spot is great for a pregame or for hangout love love Miami ice martini and for food fried calamari and you have to try TUNA ROLL is a different style roll but is delicious. Everything is fresh good and service is on point."}
{"text":"The Yard House would be a solid 5 stars if they wouldn't be so greedy and charge $6 for a Shiner Bock ($4 at Rustler's Rooste).

I had the ribs and they were excellent. Although I don't see the need to serve the ribs on a plate that is about 500 degrees fahrenheit. People do eat ribs with their hands. A pinto bean dish and creamed corn came with the ribs, very tasty. Anyways, my wife had this Korean Pork or Beef  Appetizer that was ample enough to be an entree. Her plate was spotless, enuf said. Our tab was over $60 (included 2 Shiner Bocks). A tad expensive, but a delicious meal. A nice place to go for people watching and grabbing a great meal once or twice a year."}
{"text":"This place is great the food is so killer and they have 125 beers on tap.  Try the onion ring tower, you won't be dissapointed.  They had the dogfish head 120 minute which is hard to find.  Our bartender was Danny he was very welcoming and friendly.  Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Located in the Red Rock, this place has such a huge selection of beer and food. This place has a lot of vegan and vegetarian options including lettuce wraps with tofu which are bomb! Their desserts are lacking, and that is my only complaint. Their pizza is great. Their wings are even better. The service here, for being located in a casino, is really good and the wait staff is nice and accommodating."}
{"text":"Great beers--so many to choose from & helpful servers are cordial enough to let you have a taste test, if you're not sure about it.  Friendly, upbeat, knowledgeable servers.

The food: Huge variety--almost too many options.  Pretty good--(husband had taco sampler; I did orange peel chicken)...Some of the entrees seem a bit pricey for a chain restaurant.

Been to other locations both in Vegas & other cities...All have been fine...Not Wow! but  dandy service, okay cuisine, great beers!"}
{"text":"I had an absolute amazing experience here with my friends and family. The food was great and the service was even better. We had a huge party of 18 people and they did a great job handling all of our needs. Our server was cretia and she was fantastic."}
{"text":"The music and the beer!!
Though they didn't have some of the beers I love they had enough for me to find something I liked. 
But the music was like I created the playlist!!
And the food is really good too!"}
{"text":"Recently had my boyfriends Birthday Dinner here and it was ok. Where we were seated, either the person sitting at the corner had to keep her coat on because it was so cold or the person opposite sitting had to put her coat on because it was freezing cold. The food was ok. Two of my friends are Vegans, so I wish they had more of a variety of things to eat there for them. I know there are spots for Vegan specified eaters, but it could be implemented because people in this day are more aware of what they eat than they were of the past. The menu was ok for the most part, but ahhh. Overall, we won't be going back there.."}
{"text":"You go to Yardhouse expecting good beer, better-than-average bar food and lively atmosphere. The last dozen times I've been to Yardhouse I know what I'm getting and it never fails to deliver. You go here to catch up with friends, watch a sporting event or sip some good booze. For what it does, it does it right and I love coming here. It's usually my place to go when I have friends or relatives visiting from out of town.

For appetizers you have to try their fairly new poke nachos. It's so Yardhouse to have a traditional bar food like nachos with their own twist (what's hotter than poke right now) but I am a fan! It's probably my new favorite appetizer now. If fresh fish is not your thing, the fish and chips are pretty good. I am not a fan of fried fish but hey, it's not too shabby. If fish is not your thing at all they have their fail-proof wings. Tastes like the type of wings you can expect from any urban bar eatery-greasy, spicy and all deliciousness. For entrees, their steaks and ribs are pretty good. It isn't steakhouse quality so it wouldn't be my first choice. In fact I'll probably order more appetizers the next time around. I feel like Yardhouse shines in their appetizers menu and they are more of a tapas bar to me with beer. Oh the beer, they have a wide selection of beer-local, domestic, international, you name it. My personal favorite right now is the Moose Drool.

All in all, this is a solid choice to catch a game, have a good time with friends or relatives. You really can't go wrong. Show up early because the place is always packed!"}
{"text":"Pretty average pub food. Good beer selection"}
{"text":"I went back and tried something I wouldn't normally get on the menu (Turkey Burger).  I must say it is the tastiest turkey burger I've had to date!  I look forward to trying other items on the menu now that I've gotten more direction from fellow Yelpers!"}
{"text":"Sure, it's a chain, but when a restaurant has a list of over 100 beers on tap there's a pretty damn good chance that I'll find myself there at some point. That point was a few weeks back on a random Wednesday evening around 5:30. No crowds, instantly seated. Just the way we like it. Yes, parking is a pain in the ass. You will probably have to park way in the back in the garage and actually walk your lazy ass to the restaurant. Get over it. It's probably the most exercise you've had in years.

Grab the door handles - playfully shaped as yards of ale - and swing them bad boys open. Don't be surprised if you're assaulted with a nearly maniacal greeting by several hosts and/or hostesses. We were. Joker-like grins, forced, friendly and a bit creepy all at the same time. Dial it back, folks. Another thing you'll notice pretty quickly is how large and open the space is. A huge bar is the centerpiece, high ceilings, dark wood, bigass booths large enough for a party of 8, flatscreens hung everywhere. It's a bit loud, too, so intimate isn't exactly a word I'd use here. It has a sort of upscale Applebee's feel to it. Not bad, just does.

Our server was very, very friendly. Almost schmoozy. I suppose I'd rather have this than most of the near apathetic service you'll find about town. He quickly informed us that it was still happy hour for the next 30 minutes. A nice list of specials feature some of their most popular dishes, scaled down size and price-wise, along with drink specials. Discounts vary by the type of beer, so be sure to ask your server if you're interested. Speaking of beer, if you can't find something you like on their massive beer list (ask for a sample if there's something you're not sure about), you're probably a wine drinker. And they've got plenty of wines to choose from as well. If you're a craft beer geek, get thee to Yard House. For beer alone, they're a solid 4 stars.

The menu is exactly like the beer list - big. Don't believe me? Head to their website. You'll be scrolling for what seems like an hour. Burgers, tacos, pizza, some wierd meat substitute called Gardein, seafood, steaks, chicken, ribs. It just goes on and on. It reminded me a bit of Cheesecake Factory in breadth and depth. My fellow Yelpers have deemed this place \"pricey\" but I challenge with \"compared to what?\" Sure, most of their appetizers will set you back $10-12 each and if you're looking at entrees get out that plastic. They'll hit you for about $20 a piece. I wouldn't call this outrageous, but if you're used to Steak 'n' Shake, it might come as a bit of a shock.

So, the food. This is where it fell a bit flat for me. Admittedly, I'm a picky bastard, and given their behemoth menu is, our selections are a mere fraction of the total, so there's that. I was just a bit disappointed with some with the items we ordered. For a starter, we opted for the happy hour portion of fried calamari. It was tasty, but overcooked. They also fry lemon slices along with the squid. Weird. And beware. That white aioli they serve with it packs some serious heat. It's loaded with jalapeno peppers. This is not mentioned on the menu.

Next fail The deviled eggs. Who in their right mind destroys perfectly good deviled eggs by slathering them with spaghetti sauce? It's just not done, people. The eggs themselves were great and the slightly sweet bacon pieces a delight. But c'mon. Tomato sauce? Moving on. Moo Shoo egg rolls. Deliciously fried, filled with pulled chicken, cilantro, chili cream cheese. And that sweet peanut dipping sauce? Great beer drinking food. The mixed field greens salad was also very good - just the right amount of dressing, fresh, crispy, leeks are a nice touch. 

For entrees I went with their seasonal pork chop special and my wife the salmon kale Caesar salad. My wife thoroughly enjoyed her meal. The salad was loaded with fresh ingredients including shaved Brussels sprouts, crunchy pistachios, and sweet baby tomatoes. The salmon was grilled perfectly and seasoned well. My pork chop was overcooked, but tasty. The apple dipping sauce was a nice companion. The chop was served on a bed of roasted sweet potatoes and Brussels sprouts, both of which were cooked unevenly.

Well, our first visit to Yard House proved a bit scattered. Service. Great. Beer list, stellar. Food. Some hits some misses a bit inconsistent. It was good, don't get me wrong and there are so many things on their menu that I'd like to try that I'm pretty sure we'll be back at some point. When is the real question."}
{"text":"Waiting for a movie upstairs, orderd a chocolate martini, it was strong but didnt taste right... its a beer spot though so 4 stars for great service and food options."}
{"text":"Really Good Food.
Nothing complicated or fancy. Just good casual tasty food.

I have gone to several Yard House locations in LV.
Have always been greeted with a smile, shared a few laughs with our server, and happy with our food. How can you go wrong with that?

If you drink beer, which I do not, that is apparently one of the great highlights of Yard House. They have a zillion different beers. It is one of their claims to fame.

They can be really busy on weekends, so be prepared to wait for a little bit.
But do not worry, the line seems to move pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Every Yard House I have been to has been great service, fine (but not amazing) food and loud as hell! The one on the Quad was no exception.

They have this AMAZING outdoor deck, but it was not being used. Kind of a bummer, because it looked like an awesome place to sit and enjoy the view of people walking by down below."}
{"text":"We really enjoy our visits to this location.  We like to sit at the bar, we always  get good service and the staff are super friendly.  I love their spicy jambalaya with penne pasta. Excellent!  They also have a great selection of beers and wines. Great place to meet up with friends."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food and the service. I had the Cuban sandwich with dipping sauce and fries. Loved the tropical iced tea as well. Everything was delicious! Prices were so reasonable for the quality of the food. I will be back again."}
{"text":"Wow, humongous portions. I ordered the BBQ chicken salad and it was enough to feed a family of four! I think I only ate like a quarter of it since I also had a side of clam chowder soup before my entree. The salad was very good, but I think an appetizer size would have been sufficient. Too bad. Service was really good too."}
{"text":"Pretty good happy hour with half off apps and discounts on the brews. Great selection of beers (I had the Dead Guy Ale and my pops had a Bottington's). The California roll was bomb and so was our server. Ask for Chaun."}
{"text":"Love Yard House!  The beer selection is amazing and the food is really good also.  

Great for large parties.  The server I had was awesome and not only split the checks correctly, but also split the guest of honor's check evenly among everyone else.  Make a reservation first for a large party.

I like the dim lighting and atmosphere.  The only thing is it gets loud, so loud that you can't really hear the music that's playing.  But who really cares to listen to the music when you're having fun?"}
{"text":"We had party of 16 in our table. At that time, it was happy hour, we all ordered appetizers, beers, martinis, and specialty drinks. The food are so delicious. There are a lot of appetizers during happy hour that you can pick. Our server was karen, she was great, she got everything we ordered. We left happy and satisfied. 
Some of the food we ordered:
Fried calamari: it's pretty good, it was crispy and breaded well. 
Crab cake: it's okay, i don't really like the sauce they put. It was too sweet. 
Spicy tuna: it was good portion of food. It was a little spicy but enough to be content,  and it has a little vegetable. It was good! 
Strawberry Field martini: it's sweet and vodka is a strong but it was the bomb!
Southern belle: it was so good! 
Southern punch: it's amazing! 

Overall, the happy hour here is excellent. We had a great time."}
{"text":"Had an overpriced and completely uninspired and unsatisfying dinner with my family. The place was so loud that you almost had to yell at the table to communicate. We were seated at a very tall table with barstool type chairs. Menu just didn't excite any of us and the food we eventual ordered was below average. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"How can anyone not like a restaurant with 166 beers on tap. The food is really god but expensive.. 

Between 2 and 4 is happy hour with beers from 4 and 5 dollars and some of the apps are half off. 

The real reason to come here is the beers. For a beer snob like myself it is Eden! 

4 stars because of price"}
{"text":"I've been to Yard House many times in Town Square. It's good place to go when you want to drink and catch up with friends while getting some good food. This was my first time at the location in the Linq. Everything was really clean, spacious, and lively. Aaron, our server, was friendly, made sure our waters were kept full and was very attentive.
I didn't really care for their jerk boneless wings. The sauce was on the side and I feel like it needed some breading, it was kind of weird. Parmesan crusted chicken was good. It had a mushroom and sun dried tomato sauce. My boyfriend got the New York Steak Sandwich so I had to steal a bite and it was good also! I thought it was going to be strips of steak but it's the actual full New York steak on a sandwich with tomato and onions. 
Some of my favorites are the Mac and Cheese, definitely not your typical Mac and cheese. It has truffle oil and it is just delicious! I also like almost all of their burgers, I've yet to try their late night truffle burger (you can tell I'm a sucker for truffle lol). I also really love their grilled cheese and tomato bisque. The bisque has a nice basil flavor and I always add bacon to the grilled cheese, because well, everything's better with bacon right? For appetizers I love the nachos. It's a really big portion though, maybe too big for only two people. I also really like the lobster, crab, and artichoke dip. 
For drinks, I usually get one of their martinis or specialty drinks and I've yet to be disappointed!  Overall I love this place and will definitely be coming to the linq location more often!"}
{"text":"We love this place. Excellent service always. Sarah was our server again. She was friendly, attentive and professional. We enjoyed the coconut shrimp and Calamari appetizers. Both amazing. I enjoyed the pan seared ahi tuna. OMG. The best dish ever!!. Manager was there the whole way. I didn't catch his name but he wore glasses. We came on a Monday night at 11pm. We had a wonderful time and will return every time we are in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Ok Yardhouse..you have good beer (so do alot of other places), you have average appetizers, average entees..below average flatbreads and tacos...your nachos are atrocious and your enrtees are also just average, but we would come there sometimes twice a week,  for your burgers and fries which are/ were above average.  Now you've changed your fries to soggy, below average, potato sticks!!??  
Sorry..but there are too many restaurants in Vegas with better food..and beer.  The one small thing that set you apart from other places were your skinny, crispy fries.  That one, small change will prevent me and my family from visiting your restaurant.  
So...if the change of fries is an indication that you're trying to save money..I don't see it as a positive outlook.  
Every time a restaurant changes things that are working..just to save a buck...they go downhill fast. 
Good luck.  I'll be going across the street or next door from now on!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was great and staff was awesome! I tried the Hawaiian burger and it was awful but I loved there fries. Awesome drink selection and will definitely go back to try something else next time!"}
{"text":"My shopping partner and I were at the mall when all of a sudden -simultaneously - we both got the urge for some beer and bar food. Hence, we found ourselves at the Yard House. It's in the mall. This was my second time (Indian Wells) and my friends first time. I told him that he was going to be in for a treat with the beer selection. Lo and behold they have over a 100 beers on DRAFT! It was a bit overwhelming so it took us almost 10 minutes to decide what drink to order. I got the Oregon honey and he got the half & half. Both of us were not disappointed. We ended up ordering several appetizers We got the sliders (ok, too much bread, not enough meat & side of fries), crab cakes (2 pieces, average tasting),  lettuce wraps (grounded chicken with tofu, tasty), & the ahi tuna (unusually served as a round pie, good and super filling). This ended up being more than enough food for two people. It didn't stop there, though. We ordered the trio sample for dessert. We couldn't resist. It consisted of a small ramican of lemon souffle (yumm), chocolate fudge (yummier), and apple cobbler (heavenly). Overall, the service and food left us with a good stuffed feeling. I would definitely stop by and try it again. Unfortunately, we don't have one in the Bay Area. Wait, maybe that's a good thing?"}
{"text":"My first visit and my last. I ordered the Quinoa salad. What i was expecting from the description on the menu was a bowel of Quinoa with vegetables....what I received was al large bowl of tough mature kale with stems hidden by about a tablespoon each of Quinoa, Cauliflower, Tomatoes, Beets, Feta Cheese, Blueberries. This should be marketed as a KALE salad."}
{"text":"Yep!  I still like this place.  My husband and I went for happy hour today and ordered way too much food.  But the happy hour prices really do play tricks on your mind.  You think you are saving money by coming to happy hour, but somehow you end up spending more than you would at dinner.  We ordered the onion rings which I won't eat anywhere else but at the yard house.  We had the truffle fries, pork belly tacos and the short rib tacos.  The tacos were ok, and for $4.95 for just one taco I'll probably not order those again.  My husband ordered the Gorgonzola burger with mushrooms.  That was really really good.  I would order that again.  My husband had several different types of beer and I ordered a hawaiian sunset.  If they cost less than $6.25 as the happy hour price I would have more of them.  I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Been to this location for this chain on multiple occasions and we haven't had a bad experience yet. On the latest visit we met up with a couple of friends for a fun dinner double date. We were seated right away (occasionally there is a wait, but they usually move through it pretty quickly) and taken to a table outside, as requested. The patio seating is nice if the weather is right and you enjoy the fresh air while dining.  

Had the hummus appetizer, which is tasty and only around $4-5 with several slices of pita bread. For food we both had burgers, which were cooked to order and tasted fresh. We shared the s'mores brownie dessert with our dinner dates and it was more than enough for everyone to have a bit. It's a place we will definitely return to."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times over the past 2 years and I've never been let down when it comes to the delicious food and attentive customer service. I've had date nights with the bf, a birthday dinner and just girls night get togethers here and I'm sure I'll be back several times. This location is fantastic."}
{"text":"Love Yard House!!!

Consistent service, food quality and love the ambiance. We stopped by here after the movies and it was 9:30pm. The late happy hour starts at 10pm so we opted to drink until 10pm and then put in our happy hour order. Yard House has a fabulous happy hour with a variety of options for drinks and food. So worth it to check out the happy hour here. There is a regular happy hour and then a late happy hour. We were ecstatic to catch the late happy hour. Prices for apps are almost half off.

Our server was Jordan. He had an awesome sense of humor because I made a comment about his name and said, \"Jordan like NKOTB Jordan?\" He laughed and said, \"Why NKOTB? I prefer Jordan like Michael Jordan!\" Good save. He was friendly, accommodating, and funny. 

My friend noted they had Lindeman's Framboise which is one of my favorites!!! So I asked the server to do half Framboise and half Hoegaarden beer. Trust me, it's a pretty perfect balance without too much sweetness of the Framboise. We call this drink a Dirty Ho on the east coast, Yard House calls it a Rose Garden. 

Always always always get the Poké Nachos here. I dream about this stuff. I'm so obsessed actually that after the first two times I had it, I just had to recreate the dish at home. It's that good! And happy hour price is even better.

We also got the BBQ Chicken Pizza which was solid. The Vampire Taco was good but only took a bite because we were all so full. The mini sliders were tasty and juicy. Love the string fries, it's the perfect size to munch on. Our friends got wings which wasn't special but still consistent and good. 

Downside to this particular visit was the air conditioning was down and it was warm as hell. Might as well have sat outside because you at least get fans out there. But everything was still good and our server Jordan rocked so it was all good."}
{"text":"Alleine schon für die schier unermessliche Auswahl an Biersorten vom Faß gibt es die volle Punktzahl von mir. Wir bekamen dann einen wunderbar ruhigen Platz auf der Terrasse und orderten unsere Speisen. Achtung: man würzt hier sehr gut und die asiatischen Vorspeisen sind teilweise recht heftig von der Schärfe her.

Unsere einhellige Meinung: das Filet in Pfefferkruste war der Hit. Ich habe lange in Vegas kein so gutes Fleisch gehabt. 

Dazu der wirklilch aufmerksame und fachlich gute Service, extrem leckere Desserts und ein insgesamt gutes Preisverhältnis. Sehr gerne wieder - zumal die Portionen auch wirklich essbar waren - europäisches Essverhalten vorausgesetzt."}
{"text":"This place gets top reviews for a reason. The beer selection is unreal and the knowledge of the staff is commendable. It gets very busy on weekends so you may want to adjust your timing to account for that."}
{"text":"Took the family there opening night and had some grub and beers. Can't really say much about the beers, but I will say there were some highlights.

The sliders were awesome, and they played decent skate/surf videos most of the time I was there. I couldn't really ask for much more!"}
{"text":"I am what one might call a regular to this place. I love all the bartenders and staff. They are so funny and cool, professionalism is never an issue and I love that. I can honestly say the staff here is top notch along with the service. Oh yeah! You can order or substitute Gardein in everything! Try gardein nachos and/or gardein lettuce wraps! You will love it :)"}
{"text":"Yardhouse is really not all it is cut out to be. I took my best friend to lunch for his birthday. We ordered the lobster garlic noodles (meh!), orange chicken, and two beers. My bill was $98.00 for the two of us! The lobster noodles were nothing special; in fact, the dish was not good. To be fair, there was a generous portion of seafood in the dish. But for the amount of delicious seafood - it lacked a lot of flavor. I was very disappointed in the dish; which my waitress suggested to be her favorite. My best friend ordered the orange chicken. And by his constant comments on how we should have just went to Panda Express across the way, I can only judge that he didn't think it was very great either. We were both let down by our food and overall experience (like waiting 15 minutes for a water refill AFTER we asked for one). All in all, maybe I will give this place a second chance for happy hour when I have the opportunity to spend less money on lackluster food; but I doubt it."}
{"text":"EeK! Methinks not. OK, first of all I didn't get my water until 15 minutes after I was sitting anxiously waiting at 6:02 for my waitress so i can still get happy hour menu prices. I was not worthy enough to order additional food after dinner was served because I am a woman. Second, when ordering additional ranch for your wings they bring out a plate, small napkin and more ranch. THAT LITTLE NAPKIN WAS UNCALLED FOR. Goodbye Mother Earth. The lighting is incredible, and by that I mean it wasn't that lit. We sat by the kitchen and it was so loud that I had to yell at my friend who was right next to me, while he was trying to figure out why the soccer game that he was watching got changed on the tv.   

Would Recommend and will return.  Happy Hour prices, greater than life symbol"}
{"text":"Omg !! This place is amazing , good price. Great atmosphere , friendly staff . Service was great , our waiter suggested a few things  off the menu  ..knowledgeable 

So now the food , so much yummies all right here .. I recommend the vegan burger , so tasty , juicy (this is hard to find) our vacation here in Vegas will see much more of me , might need a goodies bag  of these patties to take back to AZ . 

So sorry I missed  our waiters  name , but he really rocked ..

P.S I eat it so fast forgot to take a picture , Presentation was absolutely great . Looked as good as it tasted"}
{"text":"Had the best drink list! The food is good, but the people watching was the best part. sit outside and enjoy a beer before a NHL game."}
{"text":"Yard House is by far my all time chain restaurant. How can you not love a place with a selection of pizzas, pastas, seafood, burgers, vegan, and gluten free!?! Wait did I mention they also have sushi!?? The first time I went here I looked at my boyfriend and said, \"WHY HAVE WE NOT ATE HERE BEFORE?\" He was as confused as me. However in the past 2 years I would say we have had our fair share of this place. 
We have gone just us, we have taken my mom, and also taken the kids for a family event. 
A couple of my favorite dishes include the Jambalaya, the garlic noodles, and the spicy tuna roll. The jambalaya actually has a spice! I hate it when places skimp out on dishes that are suppose to burn a little. 
The sushi rolls come as one big roll. A layer of rice, then a layer of fish, wasabi, tempura etc. The presentation is so nice you don't want to eat it. 
My biggest issue when dining here is not getting a soup, salad, appetizer, main entree, and dessert. I suggest going with someone you don't ming sharing with because you will want to try theirs too! 
The recently added a salted carmel butterscotch pudding. Oh man, just put all my favs in one cup and serve it to me why don'tchya? 
Decent prices, good service, open late, caters to parties small and large. 
How a good chain should be!"}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of the food and drinks at Yard House but the service is always slow so I don't come here often. We ordered  a pepper jack burger and fish and chips. I was disappointed with my burger but lucky for me my sister offered some of her fish and chips they were so delicious it inspired me to write this review! I think fish and chips is an acquired taste. People who eat it don't like it they LOVE it. So if you're a fish and chips fan come to Yard House you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Loved the food those chicken nachos are amazing! The red sauce is unique to Yardhouse that no other place has on nachos. Not spicy tho. Make sure to take advantage of the happy hour menu. First time here and definitely coming back."}
{"text":"This location is on The Strip so I am going to assume that it is busy most nights and they are prepared for it. From my experience this place was a fine oiled machine! The wait was more than acceptable compared to the hour long waits other restaurants quoted us. We were seated in a booth by the kitchen and I enjoyed watching the line of runners walking out with plates of food. It was my type of runway, less heals more food! The food was good, burgers, sandwiches and fries were all cooked well and quite tasty. And our server, Pricilla I believe her name was, was beyond great! She was attentive even though she had a number of tables to attend to and when carding my boyfriend noticed that we were in town celebrating his birthday and had a surprise treat for him at the end of our meal. All and all it was a good dinning experience and a safe haven from the madness that is The Strip."}
{"text":"My favorite time to go to Yard House is right before a movie at AMC to get some dinner and drinks.  It can get insanely crowded there after 6 (with wait times up to an hour), but the restaurant is pretty big so you may get a table sooner than they estimate.  My husband always gets a half yard of one of the blond beers and I LOVE the citrus crush.  We usually split 3-4 different appetizers, but the onion ring tower has become a consistent appetizer for us.  It can get a little loud in the restaurant, but it also adds to the fun bar vibe.  They have tons of beer on tap and lots of food options.  If you're in a hurry for a quick dinner bite, it might not be the best option; it's better if you have some time to spare."}
{"text":"Yard House is probably one of the few restaurants that I truly love to visit from time to time and still won't get tired of their food. It's simply delicious! I've ordered the buffalo wings (for appetizers) and Maui chicken and everything was cooked to a different level. Although there were the rare times when some of their entrees wasn't as good, however,the awesome waiters will immediately take it off your bill. I don't know about some of the Yelpers, but Yard House is a definite yes for me. 

Eat up and drink to your hearts' content people!"}
{"text":"OK,
Don't know whats going on? But this is the second review I know was already done before! It must be in the black hole!!!! Any way, I love this place! We usually eat here after a Coyotes game (Go Coyotes) It's a fun place, great food, almost any kind of beer you want! Whats wrong with that? (nothing) This place can get busy, and does have a lot of seating, but during game day! Expect some delays. But well worth the wait."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times in the past. Never had a problem with Yard House anywhere. Usually when we come here at the mall, usually to visit Tiffany Co. it's during lunch hour on the weekend. I like eating out in the patio area. It's really not outside since it's under the parking structure. But it's still nice. 
Service, food, and facility is always decent. Last time there, wife and I shared the chicken club sandwich. When we received it we were kinda surprise that it was a hot sandwich. We expected a cold sandwich. Didn't matter it was really good, don't sure what kind of dressing it was. But it was excellent. It comes with a lot of fries, so there is more then enough to share this dish with somebody. Yard House has a huge selection of spirits and beer. I had the pineapple cider, Always wanted to try a pineapple alcoholic beverage. It was pretty good.  
Overall:
They came and checked on us plenty of times, Beverages was always topped off. When we need to come by again, pretty sure we'll come by again for a meal."}
{"text":"Went there with a group of 8 people and this place was PACKED for a Tuesday night. Good to see folks out and about enjoying good food, a large selection of beers, and of course.. sports on the countless TVs that were spread out around the restaurant. It was a bit dark in there for my taste, hard to read the menu. The fact that there was plenty of seats, was great. You had a choice of tables, booths, or the bar. I liked that the menu had a wide selection of items to chose from: soups, salads, seafood, burgers, sandwiches, and comfort foods like mac and cheese. Service was speedy and efficient. We didn't get to the desert menu because we were full. Maybe next time I am at Town Square I'll stop in and enjoy the food, beer, and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Beers!!! Holy cow what a selection. Had a Thai chicken pizza and a couple great beers to wash it down. Told the bar tender the things I liked in beer and brought great selections. I might go back tomorrow......"}
{"text":"Two stars are for the adorably sweet and energetic waitress.  The other missing three are for the less than sub par food. Which really bums me out, because I have experienced nothing but deliciousness at the Desert Ridge location.  The normally wonderful grilled cheese (that I had been craving all day) was nothing more than two crusty pieces of toast with some burnt cheese around the edges.  And the boyfriend's mac and cheese was a whole lot of macaroni and pretty much no cheese. However like I said the service was really good and fast too.  Yard House, I'm not giving up on you yet.  Just giving up on this location."}
{"text":"Great service and excellent food!! Please try the Mac and Cheese AND the Walnut Pear Salad both are phenomenal. The selection of beer is vast but offers something different for everyone. Its a great place to dine inside OR out and it is almost always packed. If you haven't tried it, you must at least once!"}
{"text":"I had a really good experience at Yard House.
My waiter was great as he seem to know how to check on his tables without bothering any one.
I had the ribs and they were really good."}
{"text":"We liked the atmosphere and location.  This place is probably a lot of fun to have drinks.  Largest selection of tap beer I've ever seen.  We ordered an appetizer- Truffle Fries- they were string fries with a lot of seasoning but no dipping sauce.  I had a NY strip salad ordered medium- pink in center.  I got a plate with a group of lettuce on one side and an over cooked steak on the other side.  After picking thru the lettuce there was so much going on in the salad, the flavors were overpowering and I had to take a lot of stuff off.  On a bed of mixed greens the size of my hand, roasted red peppers, avocados, tomatoes, green beans, gorgonzola cheese, and deep fried pickled eggs??  And it was $16.95.  Would NOT ever get this again.  My husband had a Roast dip sandwich with onion rings.  He said the onion rings & sandwich were the bomb.  The server was a little slow and didn't check on us or seem interested when I pointed to a brown blob in my salad and asked what is this. She said \"it's interesting\".  The lighting sucked and made me dizzy.  It was 1pm and it was dim with a spotlight on our plates.  We would go back to try beers and maybe a different appetizer.  But there are so many other places to eat at Desert Ridge, this would not be my top choice."}
{"text":"So happy that there's a Yardhouse in Vegas! Extensive selection of beers, wine, and cocktails. Service was quick and friendly, our server recommended great beers all night. Girlfriend and I had the southern fried chicken and vampire tacos. Large portions at affordable prices. The chicken was delicious and huge and came with plenty of sides. Vampire tacos was flavorful, outer shell was crispy, crunchy, and kept all the delicious fillings from spilling out. This was such a great find in Vegas, we actually came back the next day for lunch."}
{"text":"Been a couple of times now. The food is very good and flavorful. It can get pretty busy at popular tomes so I'd plan ahead. And it's nice to pop into the casino after dinner of course you can really make an evening out of it."}
{"text":"I'm shocked I never reviewed this Yardhouse, as I must have found myself sitting here once a week. I visited Las Vegas this past weekend, and this location is just as awesome as I recall. Hands down, the best Yardhouse I've been to.

The food quality is consistent. There are plenty of vegetarian menu items prepared with Gardein's meat substitute. The Thai chicken salad is delicious, as is the chicken/mushroom macaroni and cheese, firecracker wings, and buffalo chicken pizza. They have wonderful French onion soup, and a ton of delicious appetizers. To name a few, I enjoy the grilled artichoke, spicy tuna roll, coconut shrimp, and moo shu egg rolls. The small plates are affordable sharing options; the flatbreads, deviled eggs, and ceviche are my choices. Obviously, I eat here a lot. AND THE BEER. PLENTY OF DELICIOUS BREWS ON TAP. Listen, there's really nowhere else in Vegas I'm going to find a decent selection of porters and stouts, so it's only natural I come here. 

The service here has always been 5 stars, for the 5 and a half years I lived here and even during my last visit. The wait may look horrific, but I've never waited longer than 30 minutes on a Saturday night, and the staff is super friendly and very good at what they do. It may get noisy in here, but the ambiance is nice and the restaurant is clean. Huge bar, and outdoor dining is also an option."}
{"text":"We were very happy with our meals and our server was amazing. She was very knowledgeable about the beer selection which is always a plus. I love that the menu has organic options. The red quinoa salad was delicious and I loved the big bowl it was served in. The California roll appetizer was delicious as well. Glad to see that Yard House is also in Kansas City. We will def visit your restaurant after we get home."}
{"text":"My favorite place to get a vegan burger, hands down. We always get seated fast and our food never takes longer than 10mins to come out. Ugh I just love this place and  it's not too far from where I live which is a plus. I would recommend this place if you're looking for a variety of food choices and great service."}
{"text":"The waitress was excellent! She hooked us up with a pizza and Burger happy hour style, but the burger lacked the essential element a slice of onion, tomato and some lettuce...meat was well cooked... as for the happy hour pizza was below average....
The big drink glasses are a definite \"No\" bulky and get in your way when eating... a regular pint works better...going back to the waitress pleasant on the ball never stopping and even a cool tattoo on her arm...probably won't go back..."}
{"text":"Yardhouse is a nice, laid back restaurant with hundreds of beers to try, many on tap, and some great food.  The first time I tried this restaurant was a few years back, and I absolutely love it.

If you love beer and some great food, you must try this place.  They serve fresh fish every day and it's cooked to order.  We always have the fresh fish when we eat dinner there.  Lunch time is usually something else, like their mac n cheese squared or some sliders.  What I enjoy about this place is their variety of foods, from american to asian.  

Want to save money and still eat well?  Their appetizers could be a meal in itself!  They are huge portions and things like chicken strips come with fries, anyway, so you can always order a beer and save money on the food. I really do love eating here and haven't tried everything on the menu yet.  I'm looking forward to more culinary adventures here soon!

Some great tips: always ask your server about their favorite beers, or what beer they prefer from lagers, stouts, etc.  They are well versed in their beer and usually their preference is really good.  Another thing--their portions are big, so if you're a small eater order one dish for 2 people.  Seating can take awhile in the evenings, so coming in around 830/9pm may help seat you sooner.  If you want to eat dinner between 5-7 and you can't find parking, just use the valet right next to the restaurant side of town square.  It's open till the early morning and saves tons of time on finding that open space."}
{"text":"Without question, the worst service I have ever had at a restaurant.  We came here for a birthday party with 12 people, after being seated we waited 25 minutes for drinks (never even got water until we complained to a manager).  Food, as is standard for any Yardhouse was good, but it was totally overshadowed by a unbelievably horrible service.  If you have 4 hours to waist, eat here."}
{"text":"Not only is the beer selection amazing, the food is actually pretty good too. 
I usually order the HUGE cali roll and save the rest that I can't finish for lunch the next day. The atmosphere is great and the bartenders are funny! This place is always a must-go when you're in Vegas."}
{"text":"If you want good drinks and great food, the Yard House does not disappoint. We ordered rib-eye, southern chicken and petite filet and all was delicious. Especially my petite filet, i enjoyed every bite! Everyone said they would order their dish again! Drinks we got Hawaii Five-O and Mojitos and they were refreshing, perfect. We kept them coming! And now to service, Kelsey was great, friendly, knew the menu and always kept up with drinks and removing plates, cups. She knows what she's doing! Great service!"}
{"text":"Sad to say...I'm a regular here! After living here for a while, you become desperate for a local scene to sit back and enjoy the games...thank god I found this place! Its the perfect place to enjoy the game while sitting by the fireplace on the outside patio w/ a more than courteous wait staff. It can be pricey at times pending your food choice, but its def a local favorite for me."}
{"text":"Always like the spicy edamame, poke stack, and sliders. Pretty consistent food quality and management is really accommodating. Soups are good and the pot pie is no longer on the menu but was very good."}
{"text":"Holy guacamole... They have hundreds of beers on tap and wonderful ,wounderful food ,also tv after tv.great service too. hey what more can you ask for ;) yes it is very clean. Now what are you waiting for?? Go,go,go;)"}
{"text":"Christian the bar tender is my absolute favorite! He's always smiling, always happy and gives good service!! Also can't go wrong with the food selection at yard house!"}
{"text":"I love this place ! I'm a huge fan of the Belgium beers like the Piraate and the Gulden Drak. There very hard to find them anywhere else. They have had some amazing seasonal brews as well.The food I usually get the buffalo boneless wings, or a burger. Can never go wrong there."}
{"text":"I love beer.....let me repeat that  I f*cking Love Beer, this place is like heaven. 150 Taps plus an amazing selection of other beers, and a full bar...that alone is worth checking this place out, but the food is top notch as well. 
I has a ceaser salad that was amazing, the roommate had a seafood dish that looked great, and that was paired with both of the daily flights (they have 6 beers preselected and bring them to you on little planks in 8oz tasting glasses). and a few from the menu.

I just moved to vegas and I must say that this place is top notch, a definite for me, I miss the Flying Saucer, luckily I have this place whenever I need my beer fix.

They also have a nice outdoor patio, I haven't been out there yet, but I can see many a night drinking a pint and enjoying the desert evenings there.

I really need to get there during happy hour for reduced price beers, while I do my best to drink my way through the beer list!!!"}
{"text":"Bugs flying all around. Disgusting. Service was absolutely terrible. My husband sat for 40 minutes waiting for an iceed tea. Only came here because the happy hour, but I've had better. Does go here."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with Yard House imo. Please keep it up!

Pros:
  Good service
  Good draft beers
  Beer blends and beer cocmtails!
  Good steak
  Nice decor
  Nice ambiance
Cons:
  None"}
{"text":"Wow! Service = exceptional, food = out of this world! Last minute option for dinner tonight and I was blown away. I cannot begin to say how impressed I am. I thought this was going to be standard bar atmosphere, but it is truly a place I would consider frequenting on a daily basis."}
{"text":"Beer - check 
Veggie food - check 
Fake meat tasting veggie food - check 

I think i wind up going here about once or twice a month. The fact that they have so many veggie choices alone makes me want to come here repeatedly. The waitresses that have served us in the past have all been good and swift. They do not come too frequently or infrequently and seem more than pleased to help. They even came out with crayons or what not for my nephew when he came with us (and that sure kept him busy!)

Maybe it is a tad bit expensive, but then I am ok with it just becuase os the numerous options it provides. I know I will be going back again, and I definitely think everyone should give this place a shot."}
{"text":"We ate here while attending a conference. They have a huge selection of drinks and beer. Their specialty drinks were so good. We tried several of them. The pineapple one was great. Burgers were super large but really tasty."}
{"text":"Came here the other night for happy hour. Our waiter was horrible. He indirectly and directly gave us attitude. After he picked up all the finished dishes. It took him about 20 minutes to come back to our table. It wasn't even busy! Then he ask how we wanted our bills to be and from his tone we knew he didn't want to split it accordingly in partners. So we asked for the bill together. I believe we had such bad service because his tip was already added to our bill (gratuity) By the way, he's the bald guy around his late 20s. Food was great! but serviced was so bad."}
{"text":"I love the yard house, but this branch not so much. I like it primarily cuz I can get Gardein everything and thats a major plus. Unfortunately the last time I was there, I was given actual meat in place of the Gardein like I had ordered. The service was excellent and all that jazz, but that left me with a unpleasant feeling and there was nothing they could do to recoup from that."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try the Yard House after seeing it on various trips I've been on. It worked out that we were starving after hours of walking the strip and Yard House was open later than most places on the strip on Sunday nights. The kitchen closed at 12:30am and we made it at 12:05am. Our waiter was absolutely fantastic. He checked on us multiple times, was prompt with drinks/food/ticket, and was really friendly and helpful!

This place has an insane amount of beers and ciders on tap, so that is a huge appeal. The food selection was enticing but a little overpriced. We were just hungry and didn't care, plus is was a nice modern restaraunt so sort of expected. However, the one thing I can't get behind and the reason my rating stands at only 3 stars is because the food was SO bland and disappointing. I got a bacon cheeseburger. It tasted like nothingness. My boyfriend got a chicken sandwich. No flavor. The garlic fries were barely garlicky. It was all edible but so boring for my palette, and at that price I was hoping for some flavor or higher quality. Based on that, I don't think I would come back here for anything but the beer variety in the future, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Great food and drink selection. Very busy place on the weekend which said a lot about the taste and service. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"came here for a light lunch yesterday with a friend and her son. this review will be about their food and not their beer seeing as how i am not a beer drinker (although i hear it is amazing if that is what you are looking for.) we were seated right away around 2pm. our waitress was super friendly and helpful with the menu and pointing out their lunch specials they had on the last page of their menu. she also was good at entertaining my friends two year old son. that was a relief! we decided to share some snack size guacamole. it was pretty good. it also had feta cheese on it which scared me at first. i have never had feta cheese on guac and never would have thought to put it on, but it turned out to be delious! we also got a snack size of the truffle fries which were addicting. i could have ate the whole bowl by myself. for the main course we shared some margarita pizza. it was pretty good. tasted a little salty, but not an overload. still good and had me eating more.
i never would have expected yardhouse to have pretty decent food but i was impressed. i think i will be back to try a few drinks and some more snack size bites that won't be breaking my bank."}
{"text":"I love this place no matter which location I end up going!
I came for dinner and cocktails and this place never disappoints... every time!
Reasonable prices on the menu and  I always have a great time with friends! Perfect for casual dating or just hanging out with friends.
Subdued lighting, contemporary, huge dining area with individual tables for 2 and booths , TV screens everywhere, a long bar that circles around the middle of the restaurant. We're talking back to back bar seating.
And if you watch everyone around the bar, everyone is in a social, happy, drinking mode. Lol FUN!! Love it!!!
The menu has a variety of delicious appetizers for everyone (my favorite part of the menu) and pair that with cocktails from the bar. 
The menu selection for dinner are good as well. I'll take the gang for happy hour, gotta try it...soon
Overall: one of my faves
Pro: everything about it
Con: none. I hope it stays that way"}
{"text":"If you have some time on your hands to wait for good unique bar food then this is your place...I love the convenience of shopping at Crocker then finishing it with a craft beer and yummy apps."}
{"text":"don't often love corporate chains..but love the Yard House..great selections of drinks and food..love the variety...everyone is always pleased with their meal..from fresh salads to tacos..  :)  service is always friendly and accommodating......had the wings..tasty but small, ahi tuna salad and clam chowder.  The pork belly tacos and carnitas are also a crowd pleaser...keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"Completely unprofessional. We were sat on the patio by a hostess and never greeted for 10 minutes. Finally a manager, named Aaron, comes out and says my mom cannot have her toy Pomeranian on the patio. That is completely understandable however this dog has been a service animal for nearly 3 years. When she expressed this to him he actually, physically rolled his eyes (which blows me away) and said \"oh really? Do you have papers for him\"? The fact that the manager of this establishment felt comfortable being so blatantly rude especially after we had been sitting 10 minutes without acknowledgment blows me away. It is illegal for a restaurant to request service papers with private medical information on it and had he not have been so rude then we wouldn't be filing an official report on the restaurant about it. Such a shame because I love the other Yard House locations."}
{"text":"Love this location! Valet is convenient and cheap. Food is always amazing and a large beer selection. One of my go to restaurants"}
{"text":"The food and people here are always great! Tried a new drink tonight too. It was awesome! Too bad I can't remember why it was... So sad..."}
{"text":"waited for my dish for over the 20 min and nothing.  usually this place is good but one bad experience ..."}
{"text":"Love it!  They have my Ballast Point Grapefruit Sculpin in tap. Had a delicious seared Ahi salad. I can never decide what to order."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere.  Just wish they wouldnt change the menu so often.  Just when you find a favorite, its off of the menu."}
{"text":"Service was excellent! Our server was on top of his game and was very nice. We ordered calamari and it was good but just a little bit over cooked. Also ordered 2 Caesar salads and 2 small pizzas ( BBQ chicken and Thai chicken.) the salads were great. Dressing was light yet tangy and they had baked cheese crisps in it. Oh those were yummy!! The pizzas were good but the bottom of both pizzas had way to much flour on the bottom. Made my mouth dry,But we had plenty of beer to choose from! 110 beer choices to be exact. Over all food was pretty good and service was awesome. Oh and I recommend going during happy hour. Lots to choose from at a great price :-)"}
{"text":"I'm a regular at the Yardhouses and was doing some work in the Northeast end of town today where the food choices and security are not good, so I drove all the way over here to have lunch.  Asked to sit on the patio and expected to be seated at one of the empty two-tops with somewhat of a view albeit the parking lot.  Hostess took me somewhere else and I asked if I could sit at one of the empty two tops.  She had to make me stand there while she went back to the desk to see if it was okay.  When she came back she basically told me no, because there was no server assigned to that area....but there were people seated within 6 feet on each side of where I wanted to sit! So, I asked why one of the servers handling those people couldn't handle one lone diner sitting within 6 feet!?! The moment she started to argue with me, I walked out.  Stupid and never should have happened.  Poor customer service and a lack of hospitality training. Will spend my money elsewhere today."}
{"text":"67 reviews. Holy frack.  I've watched a few soccer matches at the downtown San Diego Yard House, never been impressed.  Haven't eaten dinner there in half a decade.  I ate here on friday night with a mixed tables of locals and visitors- everyone was pretty satisfied with their meal and the dinner was impeccable.  On the other hand, the douche factor is through the roof: tons of ed hardy and ladies rocking the high heels/shorts look.  I think they actually charge a cover on friday and saturday night?  I know they have a similar scene at the San Diego Yard House, but I literally can not fathom why people would come here on a friday or saturday night."}
{"text":"This place is amazing I absolutely love the atmosphere and service. Their appetizers are great and they have a good variety. I only go back and forth between two entrees, either a chicken avocado sandwich (delicious) and a NY steak sandwich which is amazing on occasion they get it right. I always ask for the steak to be WELL done (no pink). I usually have to send it back in order to get the meat how I like it. When it comes out well done there is no other sandwich better then the NY steak sandwich, simply amazing. Great variety of beer and always great service. I will always come back!"}
{"text":"Best meal we had all week..  If your passing the Flamingo right before the Linq, make a right- head to the wheel.       Stiegl Radler Grapefruit- wife loved it."}
{"text":"Fiance and I decided to hit up the yardhouse for a quick bite before a big night out.  

He ordered 3 tacos a la carte, the fish, the korean pork belly and korean short rib.  According to him, the korean tacos were nothing short of amazing. 

 I begrudgingly ordered the margarita pizza knowing they didn't have buffalo mozz, but their combination of roma tomatoes, basil and garlic made for a surprisingly good pie at an excellent price.

I know it's a chain, and there are 'better' places to eat in Vegas, but I wouldn't be mad if I ended up at yardhouse again!"}
{"text":"Usually very happy with yard house but could tell that my server was overwhelmed which is completely understood. I ask for the sweet potatoes fries to come out before our meal and it came out with the main meal and felt like the main order was never going to come out. I was disappointed that he not once checked on us to see if we were happy with everything. The food was delicious but the service was not so good."}
{"text":"Great looking spot for a casual bite to eat in the Linq. As with all YH, the beer list is impressive and they offer little taster sized beers if you want to sample. If you ever wanted to become a beer snob, start here. Try them all. Beyond the brews the menu is LARGE and covers salads, snacks, sammies, steaks, desserts, gluten free, etc.. It's like the menu at a NYC diner, only with some class (and fresh((er)) food). There's a sweet patio, a 2nd floor and even a take-out drink spot, in case the shite beers at O'Sheas aren't your cup of tea. With big TV's around and a HUGE center bar, it's a comfy spot to hang and watch a game. Two thumbs up from this guy for YH!"}
{"text":"I love coming here so much. I come about once a month just for the grilled cheese & tomato bisque. It's divine...
Everyone is kind but not overly. I am here solo today but it's okay, the atmosphere & the bar is quite comfortable for a single patron.

I haven't found a Yardhouse I don't love!"}
{"text":"The food is good, the service is really, really slow. Which is good if you're watching a football game but not so much otherwise."}
{"text":"Overdue rating ... We have been going to yard house locations before they even brought them to vegas. We regularly visit the Red Rock location. The food, drinks and service have always been consistently good. The service we got from our waitress \" Rosie\" was amazing . I really should have posted a review of previous exceptional staff, but yesterday reminded me that this is well deserved.  Ps: Please don't 86 the Lost Coast Tangerine Wheat beers. That is our favorite."}
{"text":"The truffle fries were delicious and cheap at $5 for a generous portion equivalent to 2 large McD fries order. It was such a great deal. Pizza was ok and salads were very hearty."}
{"text":"Went to the Yard House last week for a double date with my sister and her boyfriend. Our server, Jan, was great! She was attentive, friendly, and didn't mind that we took 20 minutes or so to order since we were all chatting. She was overall a great server!
The food was okay. My sister ordered some kind of pasta with lobster which she loved. However, I ordered the ginger crusted salmon which I was excited about but the salmon was very dry and over cooked. I barely ate any of it. 
I'm only giving three stars because our appetizer (calamari) was completely forgotten and never came to the table and the food was subpar. This is the second time I've been in a row that I haven't been pleased by the food and for the price they charge I should walk away satisfied."}
{"text":"What a beer selection! What a food selection! Big portions of both too, our server, his name was Matt but I didn't catch his last name, recommended the nachos and a Papago Orange Blossom. The side salad portions were worth the price as well and we even tried some of their specialty cocktails that Matt sold us on. Both were great and they even brought out a birthday dessert for my friend. The environment was good with football on during a Sunday, would definitely go back, even for lunch and a quick yard of beer. Don't get fooled by the chain restaurant gimmick, this place is the real deal for foodies and beer enthusiasts alike."}
{"text":"Yard House definitely played a role in my killer hangover this morning.  Arriving at 5:55pm yesterday my friend and I were able to squeeze in two martinis and two apps at Happy Hour price before HH coincidently ended at six.  Bummer.  Especially since happy hour martinis are $5.25  but at the stroke of 6, raise up to a bank breaking $9.25.  And they somehow cant fill them all the way to the top.  

Dont get me wrong though, we stayed for another three martinis each, maybe because of the flirty, good looking mid-west bartender, or maybe because it was crowded and hot as balls across the way at Z Tejas and Kona.  Either way.  

Yard House is home to roughly half a billion beers on tap so if you like beer or just like to get drunk, $3.25 pints at happy hour are the way to go.  If you cant make it before 6pm, try waiting til reverse happy hour later in the evening.  Or you can drink straight through both if you have the cash to purchase regular priced drinks.  Which I just hate.  

Classic rock is the only music you'll hear here, EVER, even during a Pistons game which to me, really doesnt set the mood.  Try coming during a Suns game and they'll turn on the sound.  Great place to watch sports but arrive early, although its a big place, it gets crowded on game days.  

Good people watching, snotty valet right out front...everything we love about Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner tonight and was super impressed. We sat at the bar since it was pretty crowded. 
The entire staff was friendly, attentive, helpful and courteous. We had a tough time ordering the salad...sounds funny but there are a few versions of the house salad so be specific as to what you want. 
I had the penne with chicken which never disappoints and we also ordered the tortilla soup...yum!
Good service with a smile is hard to find but nailed it tonight!
Thanks guys-girls"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying The Yard House, and I was a fan. I got the Southern Belle cocktail, which is a version of sweet tea, which was yummy and perfect to go with my meal. I ordered the Nashville Hot Chicken, which was amazing. Perfect combination of sweet and heat! It is served with a side of pickles and ranch sauce, which pairs wonderfully and your choice of side. I had fries, which were ok, nothing spectacular. The rest of the meal was delicious though!"}
{"text":"Had lunch and dinner at this Yard House while in Vegas on business.

Cool location near the ferris wheel and on a pedestrian street with lots of neat shops.

Large, clean and modern facility.  Friendly servers.  Varied menu.

Strongly suggest the Poke Nachos.  We enjoyed them so much at lunch we ordered them again for dinner.  Fantastic appetizer.

The Roasted Turkey and Bacon Melt is sensational.  Highly recommend.  However, the Seafood Garlic Pasta was pretty bland and disappointing.  Avoid that one.

Overall, this is a great place to grab a bite.  Good ambiance, friendly service and good food.

4 stars!"}
{"text":"Great variety of drinks. Creative dishes too. 
Little overpriced in general. Some of them are open late which is a good place for a drink with  friends"}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant during an early evening on a weekend. We were seated right away and the service was pretty good. They have a great selections of beer if you enjoy the array of drinks as well. As always, love the music the play!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere.  Great beer selection.  Good food.  We went appetizer and salad a few nights ago.  The Spinach dip was great!  Comes with a fantastic toated pita bread.  The lettuce wraps were also a treat.  

Only disappointment is with ALL the kegs of beer on tap, no Tecate or Tecate Light!  Oh well.

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"A few hours after I arrived in Vegas on July 9, 2015, I went to the Yard House with a few friends and my boyfriend for dinner. The monorail station was pretty close, so it only took five minutes to get here. Since my friends were able to get a table before everyone arrived, there wasn't any need to wait in line that slithered out the front entrance. The atmosphere was lively with loud music. We sat in a booth and our server was definitely as energetic and jolly as the atmosphere.

I ordered the Korean Pork Belly taco plate with beans and rice. Two friends ordered a salmon dish with Wasabi mashed potatoes and a side of vegetables. Another friend ordered a burger and the other ordered a taco plate similar to mine. My boyfriend ordered the jambalaya. We also had some appetizers, which were just as flavorful.

When our food arrived, everyone enjoyed their meals and we had the time of our life. The Korean Pork Belly Tacos were crispy, juicy, and slightly spicy. I'm salivating just thinking about it. Two friends that ordered the salmon dish with Wasabi mashed potatoes did not finish their meals, so I decided to try one of the mashed potatoes. Who has ever had Wasabi mashed potatoes anyway? I haven't, so I tried it and loved how the Wasabi wasn't overpowering at all. I basically finished it and didn't have room for dessert.

Overall, service was beyond excellent. Prices were decent. I spent less than $25 on my meal plus a drink. The food was incredibly delicious. Wasabi mashed potatoes? Korean tacos? YES PLEASE!"}
{"text":"Great pub food, nice ambiance with friendly staff. Our servers were Areanna and Gary, who gave us the full scoop on Meiomi pinot noir. It was a full boby wine, a little fruity, light on the tannins. I strongly recommend this wine to anyone who likes reds that enjoys full body and fuity flavor. It pairs well with pastas, pizzas, and beef. And the funny thing is that i'm getting good wine from a brewery. 

They go the extra yard..."}
{"text":"I have only been here once so far, but I will definitely be back again!

They have an amazing selection for beer! My recommendation is to sit up at the bar. That's where it's at. The cocktails are very nice as well.

One of the best places for a happy hour for sure!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints,great for a casual business outing,a drink out with your spouse or friends.Very busy during the late afternoons or weekends ,I usually just sit at the bar.Good beer selections and menu."}
{"text":"Yard house has a huge selection of alcoholic drink options including a wide variety of different beers. I went when the Taylor swift concert was going on nearby so they were quite busy but seemed to handle it well. It has an abundance of seating and is vegetarian friendly. Our party of two was seated within 45 minutes despite the crowd. We went during happy hour time from 3-6pm so it was reduced price drinks and appetizers which was a great deal. We shared the cheese pizza, fried Mac and cheese and the Wisconsin cheese curds (lots of cheese items). They were all delicious. The Hawaiian mule was delicious and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I really liked this location of yard house . It was a little brighter and had a better ambience . Also the servers were nicer than the TS location . 

As far as food goes it was delicious . We ordered the hummus dip and truffle fries to start . The server asked us if we wanted more pita when we had one left which was nice . To eat I order the gardein chicken avocado sandwich without cheese or mayo and it was really good and light I was surprised . I'm trying out a vegetarian diet so it's nice they have those entree items . 

Def recommend this location - we were seated right away on a Saturday night and had a good time before our show at the Brooklyn bowl ."}
{"text":"This place is really good, we had no idea it was a chain. There are so many choices. The prices are great. The portions are great and shareable. The food is delicious and the flavor is mouth watering. The Asian dishes are our favorites, mushy egg rolls being at the top of the list. Highly recommend. We visited one in San Antonio Texas also and it was just as good. Both loications had great friendly service. Not to mention a huge cocktail and draught beer selection."}
{"text":"We found this place on our recent trip to Vegas, and liked it so much we came back a second time just for more drinks! They have a huge selection of beer, and I tried the tangerine, apricot and watermelon beers, all of which were tasty. 

As for the food, the appies were really great. Lettuce wraps had 3 different sauces, and all were delicious. The hummus was fresh and pita soft. As for the mains, my burger was slightly overcooked but still quite flavorful. My dining partner tried the turkey club and overall he enjoyed it but the turkey was freezing cold, like straight out of the freezer cold. 

Overall a great ambiance and would return just for that patio view of the Linq!"}
{"text":"One of my favorites.  Great happy hour, drinks (the only place I will drink beer - they have so many different and yummy kinds to choose from), vibe and a ton of vegan options to choose from!"}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Factory of Beer and Food. 

Dinner is a little pricey so I like to come out more for the happy hour where you can get pizzas, wings, chicken strips, etc.  It's probably a step up above Kona in terms of the happy hour foods.

I enjoy the beer flights so I can sample a little bit of everything.

One thing I don't like about the Town Square location (and this is probably true at all Town Square restaurants)  is that it is the DBC....DBC being Douche Bag Central.....and the later u go, the more u will come across them.  No further explanation needed"}
{"text":"I love Yardhouse. Especially this location. It's inside the Linqs courtyard, towards the very back in front of the High roller. Everything I ordered here is delicious my personal favorites are the calamari, the sashimi,and the wings! My last experience was really good our server Ryan gave us exceptional service. The happy hour here is a 10. By far one of the better happy hours on the strip. Not to mention they have the largest selection of cocktails and beers.I recommend coming here any time and they're open until 1 am. Will definitely be dining here again."}
{"text":"One of the best places in Crocker Park especially because they stay open later than most restaurants."}
{"text":"Yardhouse is one of my GO TOS!

Love the variety of this menu. ESPECIALLY THE BEERS! 
Calamari is my thang! I love calamari! But we decided to try the Kung Pao Calamari and it was pretty dang good!

I was craving pasta so I got the Penne with Chicken and I'd give it a 3/5. Nothing too special. Taste pretty bland, honestly. Probably wouldn't order it again.

Other than that, I'd probably go back to my favorite salad the Ahi Crunchy Salad!

Service was great! Loved that there's all night Happy hour on Monday nights! That's huge because everyone is looking for a place for football and happy hour!

It was also freezing that night, but the hostesses sat us outside in the heated patio so that was great!"}
{"text":"The Yard House was highly recommended to us by our Brother-In-Law. Great suggestion because this place was fantastic!

Atmosphere has a dark, casual, pub. Very comfy booths. 

Beer list is AMAZING! I think there were something like 150 beers on tap. Yup- ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY BEERS ON TAP. My husband got a flight where he sampled 6 beers for about $10. I on the other hand, had to go the non-alcoholic route and had the passion fruit iced tea. It was delicious and very refreshing! Highly recommend! 

As for food, we arrived during their \"Happy Hour\" which ran from 3-6pm. We shared the $5 Onion Ring Tower and the $6 chicken strips. I wasn't too hungry to begin with and there was SOOOO MUCH FOOD. I don't know if it's my heightened sense of smell and taste but the food, although was pretty good (my husband loved it), tasted too much like grease to me. 

Service was superb!! Our waiter was awesome! He was very attentive and friendly. My iced tea glass never ran dry. 

We really think you should give this place a try!!!"}
{"text":"I went with a group of 8 on Sunday night. I had to admit the price was pretty pricey but that's ok because its open later and fine-dinning type.
The food and service was great."}
{"text":"First place we stopped when we got to Vegas. As always we love the drink selection!! Place was nice and clean. We sat at the bar & our bartender was extremely friendly and knowledgable. I wanted to keep stopping back in even though we have one by our house in Chicago & Orlando!!"}
{"text":"The food we had was really delicious, and the service was great! The hostess was professional and nice when we walked in, our server was diligent and intentional the entire time and checked on us multiple times. We ordered the Brussels sprouts snack and deviled eggs. Fish and chips for entree. All of it was delicious! The Brussels sprouts were crispy to perfection and the sauce underneath the bed of sprouts and potatoes was incredible! Very good experience! Great place for late night food!"}
{"text":"I can't wait to go back here. I took my mom here one night for her birthday. We sat in the rooftop dining area outside. Our server payed attention to my subtle mentions of it being her birthday and took care of her without my asking, with dessert with candle and a comp'd appetizer. He was knowledgeable about the beer selection. He helped mom pick out a dark beer which she loved, and I got to do a flight of local IPA's. So good!  I remember mom got fried chicken, and the server was very accommodating to her likes and dislikes (with no eye rolling or impatience). Mom's from the south and knows proper fried chicken, and she loved theirs. I got a fish dish, and though I don't recall which, I remember it was excellent too. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good. I got the street tacos, by far the best thing on the menu and super affordable! The baja fish tacos were great as were the asada. 

Angel, our server, was fantastic! Service overall was great. Overall it was a good experience. It's nice to have affordable options on the strip!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for late lunch. As happy hour was going on we ordered off that menu.  Got sliders, crab cakes, onion rings and wings.  Overall was good.  One crab cake was a bit overcooked.  Wings had nice crisp outer texture which I like.  Washed it down with a nice Breckenridge vanilla Porter and santan hefeveizen."}
{"text":"i love yardhouse and their VEGAN MENU!!!! o ya thanks for Reppin the vegans/vegetarians !!!! HAPPY HOUR is awesome i got vegan wings for half the price and our server was super nice my wings kinda come out cold most of the times but i'm not a complainer man at the end of the day they're wings !!!!! who cares plus they'll prob warm it up if u ask but i just don't cuz who carez !!! their 4 cheese pizza is amazing too !!"}
{"text":"One of my idols is vegan Chef and New York Times Bestselling cookbook author Tal Ronnen. Tal was recently involved in the launch of 25 new vegetarian and vegan options at The Yardhouse restaurant, which utilize Gardein (plant-based lean meat products).
I got a text from my friend asking me if I would want to go to dinner with him and Tal, who was in town for work. I wrote him back and said that I was a big fan of Tal's and would be honored to join them for dinner. I didn't see the exact vegan options on the Yardhouse menu online, but I apparently didn't click on the right link for AZ printable menu, which shows all the available Gardein options. As I was looking over the menu, I was so impressed with the variety of menu items available-from appetizers, to salads, to burgers and entrees. Tal suggested that we order a few items, so that we could sample a variety of plates. We ordered a chopped salad, onion rings, veggie beef sliders, veggie BBQ chicken pizza (for our non-vegan friends), veggie chicken rice bowl and veggie orange peel chicken. If you are vegan and you order the veggie beef sliders, just make sure you order them dry.
Everything I tried was super delicious and flavorful. I know that I will be back 10,000 times in the future because it is a place I can go with my non-vegan friends and not sacrifice on my vegan options.
I found out tonight that chef for the Yardhouse in LA took over 6 months to find the perfect pickle to accompany the veggie beef sliders...guess a good pickle is hard to come by!
If you have an opportunity to eat at The Yardhouse, please support their vegetarian and vegan options. I can honestly say you will love them!

{"text":"In town on business a couple weeks ago.   A large party of us came here on a Thursday night.  I don't know what all everyone else had but what I had was so amazing!  The grilled cheese and tomato bisque. Holy cow heaven.  

The restaurant was packed! But our service was spot on.  The beer was cold, the food was hot and just a fun place to go.  I hope to get back here again when I am back in town.  Wish we had one of these in Dallas!"}
{"text":"The tacos are to die for!! & the crab cakes..never had better. This restaurant is incredible. The atmosphere is really nice tooNot too bright or crammed. I definitely recommend to anyone! Eat here!!!!!"}
{"text":"This review is strictly for the food as we did take out from this location.

Shrimp Ceviche - 3.5 Stars - Normally full of shrimp and fruit, but this time the shrimp was lacking, so to me it was more of a fruit ceviche. Still full of flavor and seasoned well, just lacking on the main ingredient.

Shrimp Caesar Salad - 4 Stars - 4 Jumbo Shrimp cooked perfectly. Nice and tender and full of flavor. Perfect amount of cheese crisps and croutons, only lacking was the amount of dressing. 

Spinach Cheese Dip - 5 Stars - Always awesome and full of flavor. The chips work so well with the dip and the portion size is perfect.

Angel Hair Pasta w/ Shrimp - 5 Stars - Pasta cooked perfectly. Sauce is on point and full of flavor. Large amount of shrimp. Portion size is perfect for sharing.

Turkey Pot Pie 3.5 Stars - First time having this dish here and was expecting a little more from the dish. The puff pastry was underdone, so it was greasy and not very edible. There were far too many leeks in the dish, so it tasted like turkey and onions which is not bad for me since i love onions, but it was just lacking in other flavors. On a positive note, there was a ton of turkey, so that was a huge positive.

Salted Caramel Pudding - 5 Stars - Can never get enough go this dessert. Always good, just wish it was a bit larger of a portion."}
{"text":"It's Yard House. It's a chain. What more do you need to know? 

Pages and pages of beer selections on the menu. Great drink menu. Food was good but nothing special or OMG worthy. 

I had the Papago Orange Blossom beer with a Cuban pork sandwich and it was good. The waitress was a great help in picking out a beer I might like. She brought out a few samples to try first, which was a grand idea.

Wait staff was quick and attentive. Bar staff was a bit slow. Took forever for our drinks to come out. (We ordered beer, not even mixed cocktails?)  Food came out before the drinks. Ugh. Fail."}
{"text":"So disgusted with their no dogs allowed policy. Snooty attitude at the hostess stand. You can't say it's because of health code because one. It's outside where disgusting birds and other animals can venture and two, any other restaurant and retail store here in Town Square is fine with dogs. Twice now we've been turned away (even asking for patio seating) because of our well behaved, certified dog. So twice now we've gone upstairs to McFadden's to open arms and amazing service. Your loss, Yardhouse. Currently there is a French Bulldog party beside us on the patio. So cute."}
{"text":"Seriously. There were literally a dozen and a half tables & booths available; empty, clean, and ready for use. And yet there were four parties of two - four people waiting more than fifteen minutes. It's a holiday, and the place is less crowded than I've ever seen it, and yet they have people waiting? Hostesses wiping down menus instead of actually hosting. I go here at least once a month when I go to a movie, and I've never seen such crappy service. They have great guac, but besides that there's nothing unique abt this place. I'll find a new spot for movie lunching from now on thanks to their horrendous customer service today."}
{"text":"The Yard House is my go to spot in the afternoon--not because they have super awesome food, but simply because they meet my particular lunchtime criteria:
- prompt service
- broad lunch selection, that include edible salads
- skinny margaritas
- booth seating in a dark corner (so I can read my smutty novels in peace)

If you have the same set of requirements as above--Huzzah! Yard House is the place for you!  If you just want to sit around and drink beer--Yay! You are still in the right spot.  If you want really great cuisine?  Hmm, Maybe you might try another restaurant... not that Yard House is bad (it isn't).  It is just more of a socializing place than a place to really sit and enjoy the food."}
{"text":"Blacken swordfish tacos are fantastic. Young Double Chocolate Stout delicious and a nice outdoor seating area. Too much football on tvs with baseball playoffs on."}
{"text":"It was one hot afternoon, the boyfriend wanted to take me check out how Scottsdale was and so he did. We happen to come across Yard house in the mall. The patio was sort of outside of where cars were getting valet parking. Might be a bit noisy for others but hey, not bad to check out fancy cars. :) After a long walk, we decided to come here for the happy hour and man was it worth it. We started it off with two half yards, one ECLIPSE (Blue Moon & Guinness) and one Guinness. We thought we weren't going to finish it but it made us feel hungry so we got some appetizers on their happy hour menu. The  Hawaiian Poke Stack was yummy, that is if you can eat raw sushi. It looks like a burger but they stack it with poke and use fried won-ton strips to separate the poke, avocados and ginger. I think they mixed the poke with some soy sauce and sesame oil. It was good. Then we got Seared Ahi Sashimi. (yes, we are into our sushi rawness) Small portion, theres maybe about 5 slices at most, and some greens on the side. Not bad. I think it is only worth it for happy hour price. 

Appettizers happy hour price
- Seared Ahi Sashimi (reg: $11.95) $5.95
- Hawaiian Poke Stack (reg: $12.95) - $6.50

Drinks  Happy Hour (half yards) -$7-$10
-  ECLIPSE (Blue Moon & Guinness)
- Guinness

course I would go to yard house again, for the happy hour :)"}
{"text":"Really liked the Yard House.  Ate there for lunch - had a few beers and the street tacos.  Great service and very nice patio."}
{"text":"This was the best gourmet grilled cheese sandwich and tomato bisque I've had and the sweet potato fries with maple bacon cream...OMG!  Love it.  I hope there is one in Memphis."}
{"text":"where do I begin, well first off the new location is awesome! Located last but not least in the the heart of the new Vegas attraction The LINQ. I ended up here to have late night dinner after drinking and walking around with friends. Anyways their menu has a huge selection and I went in for the \"late night menu\" starts from 10pm till 2. To start as an appetizer I ordered onion ring tower (these were soo good you must try them!) for my entree I ordered the Black truffle cheeseburger (7.95) medium well, & it was delicious! Super flavorful meat well seasoned and juicy! 
Along with that I ordered a side of truffle fries (4.25) the fries I'll give it 3 stars it was too salty! :( other than that everything else was bomb. Com :)"}
{"text":"I went to this location last night for dinner and let me tell you, for a Monday evening it rocks!  There were scores of people, large - large dining area (you can get lost in the booths or just sit somewhere out in the open...

The dish I ordered was Penne Pasta with Southwestern Chicken, sun dried tomatoes, garlic, a creamy white sauce that was just right (carbonara), and a good portion too boot!

The beer ---  I had a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale- On Tap!  Oh sooo good!

I give it four stars because the service was a little spotty...new hires being taught to serve, and the customer has to take the brunt of their inexperience...I was challenged for simple things like grated cheese for my pasta dish I had to ask for...and they brought the check before I was asked if there would be anything else I wanted---I actually wanted a coffee afterward!...Who'd-a-guessed!---lol   So I went to Starbuck's close to my apartment downtown....

Still, I would go there again.

A toast to all!"}
{"text":"Good food, pretty pack most days but today, we walked in at 920pm, and they told us the wait (regardless of inside or outside is 25 minutes at least).
So we walked around the bar and meantime, I counted 17 open tables of 4-6 people, not counting outside tables that were open. All 17 tables were ready for someone to seat them, but 5 minutes later, they still didn't seat anyone. We got a spot at the bar and when I returned my buzzer, they only sat one couple at a 6 person booth - speak of inefficiencies. 
Sitting at the bar, there's at least 6 open tables within spitting distance of me, still open after we've been seating at the bar for the last 10 minutes. And two more tables waiting to be cleaned. I'm shocked their wait was that long and they've only seated one party of two since we arrived."}
{"text":"My default place for good food with big groups.  The menu has everything you can think of: American, Japanese, soul-food, drunk-food.  Their selection of beers is huge!  My favorites are Leine's Sunset Wheat (a hefenweizen kinda beer), Leffe Blonde and Paulaner."}
{"text":"One of the BEST happy hours around!  Staff is very friendly and so are the customers....  you have to try the chicken nachos and pizza!!1"}
{"text":"Had a delicious dinner tonight. We came for dinner around 5:30 just in time for happy hour. My husband ordered the tuna roll, I ordered the California roll, and we both got the lettuce wraps. Everything is delicious and cheaper because it was on the happy hour menu. Aside from that. Our waitress brought us a free dessert that said congratulations since I'm pregnant. It was so thoughtful. We loved it and will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Hint: Happy Hour for beer, wine, & bar food
100 plus draft beers
Outdoor seating w/misters & heaters
Extensive food menu e.g., delicious fish tacos, BBQ bacon burger
My favorite was the orange peel chicken
Good desserts e.g., Kona coffee ice cream sundae, mint chocolate ice cream
Cool food service by Brian"}
{"text":"Yard House is pretty good! When it's nice, I like to dine out in the patio. My fiancé and I had coconut shrimp which was decent and I ordered the black truffle burger.  Now, I'm pretty plain when it comes to burgers... I will admit, this wasn't the burger for me. It was cooked as I asked and the service was still good. Definitely a place to try!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food and the drinks are just right. Sadly the desserts have been disappointing. However the balance in my mixed drinks makes up for it.

 The  chicken lettuce wraps  are my favorite.  My husband lives the burgers and beer assortment. Best times to go are Happy hour or lunch. Great deals ! 

Ambiance is inviting and staff are friendly. I like that patio is heated during colder weather as I prefer to sit out side. Great place to bring friends."}
{"text":"Service was slow. Food was not godo at all. It was left under the heat lamp and everything was limp and oily. French onion soup was just bread with a slice of cheese and no flavor. Servers were fighting for tables...disorganization and prices were unreasonable. Never again..."}
{"text":"Had the crunchy ahi salad and my son had the jambalaya. Both were spectacular. Couple it with the beer selection that's unmatched anywhere and you have a great spot."}
{"text":"Seeing as this is a chain, the reason for a 5 star review is solely based on our service. 

Derrick G was friendly, funny and extremely personable. I've eaten here numerous times and it's always the same, boring service. He kept it fun, but kept it moving and made some quality recommendations. 

If you're going to go - ask for him!"}
{"text":"After seeing Sarah Brightman at Jobing Dot Com Arena I was still in the mood for dessert. (See my Gordon Biersch review.)

I walked through the Westgate Center after the show and decided to give Yard House a try. Perused the menu outside and decided that the desserts looked good.

Went in and was promptly seated at a nice big booth for just one person. The hostess asked if I'd ever been there before and I told her no. She briefly explained the menu for me. 

When the server arrived he also asked if I'd ever been there before. I told him no and he went over the menu again. I didn't want him wasting his time so I told him I was just interested in dessert. He pointed out the dessert section and I asked him if he recommended the 'pint-sized apple peach cobbler.' He said he did but warned me it was small....hence the 'pint-sized' disclaimer. I thought that was cool....some menus say 'pint-sized' but he wanted to make sure I understood they meant it. Honesty goes a long way with me.

I said that was fine....that's all I wanted and really needed. He asked if I wanted anything to drink and I told him I'd look over the HUGE beer list. 

When he came back I asked him his preference between two beers. I took his suggestion with the Murphy's Irish Red and really enjoyed it. 

The 'pint-sized' cobbler was small...as he had warned...but it was tasty. The caramel ice cream it was served with was a welcome touch over the traditional vanilla.

Beer and a cobbler.....strange, I know.....but it worked. 

The ambiance of the place was casual and laid back with lots of televisions everywhere and lots of classic rock (like their slogan says).

Would like to try some of the food next time I'm in the Westgate area. 

Oh.....the sinks in the men's room were awesome. Or I guess I should say sink in the singular. It was a long trough with three or four 'spigots'. You put your hand up to the 'spigot' and a STRONG stream of water about two or three inches wide came out.  Made washing your hands pretty darn cool. It's the first time in a LONG time that I've felt I got all the soap off my hands in a public restroom.

A great and relaxing end to my evening out. Will be back."}
{"text":"Kelley, Bartender, took great care of us and recommended some flavorful draft beers! Try the Twin Peaks Peach draft! I ate the California Roll and the presentation was creative and colorful!"}
{"text":"Poke Stack is decent...
Bar service, usually great.  For the most part, the staff is genuinely friendly and knowledgeable. 
Yard House in Long Beach, CA...4 stars, fresh seafood and tender steak.
Yard House in Desert Ridge, AZ..a little sloppy on technique on some plates and skimpy on some others.

Bottom line...
Had colder and cleaner tasting beer elsewhere and have been disappointed a few times with the quality and care in the preparation of the food and portion sizes for the price.
Even my go to...the Poke Stack...sometimes the tuna is poorly chopped leaving sinew which displays the lack of 'Attention to Detail'. 
Decent place for burgers and beer but you can get the same quality for less money elsewhere..."}
{"text":"First time at this location and it blew my expectations out of the water! The service was by far one of the best I've ever had. Granted it was not busy but they took care of us so well! The location is a little ways off the strip, as we were headed towards the eye of Vegas we decided to stop by for a beer and a quick bite to eat. 

To eat, we had chips and guacamole before we could finish there was already a fresh plate of new chips already at the table. We also ordered the buffalo cauliflower. I've never had it before but give it a try, it is different, and the buffalo sauce is excellent! 

If you're in the area give this place a try, recommended!"}
{"text":"Pretty good grub and a huge menu.  I like the street tacos, burgers and appetizer options.    Fun rock music, indoor and outdoor patio seating at Desert Ridge.  It's one of the better places to eat late night."}
{"text":"SOOOO MUCH BEER. This is the place to come if you want to drink a couple good beers with some friends, or whoever. 
The food was pretty good, nothing too memorable, but they do have a good appetizer menu if you are trying to just get some drinks and apps. 
We had a decent wait (I think we were there on a Friday, though) and the outside patio was a good choice."}
{"text":"So I have mixed feelings about my recent experience at Yard House. I went last Friday for my cousin's birthday. Apparently they do not take reservations and as we were a party of 9 on a Friday night, the wait was long. Two hours, in fact. That in and of itself really wasn't the end of the world, we sat at the bar, watched the Cavs game and tried some of their own brews, which were okay (I had the white ale). When we were finally seated we were placed at a table that really could comfortably hold 7, maybe 8 people. My mom, brother, and sister are all pretty tall and the result was that we were very crowded and I was actually seated on corner of the table. A corner! I mean, I get it--it's prime time on a Friday night, but it was weird. Additionally the music was SUPER LOUD. I love me some Phil Collins, not gonna lie, but I don't want to have to scream over his voice in order to ask my aunt a question. I ordered the blackened swordfish tacos, which were very good--spicy with a sweet and fresh salsa. I didn't eat the beans it came with, but I tried some of the rice and was very confused. I don't think the kitchen knows what Mexican rice is supposed to be. All I know was that mine was a molded pile of oily rice. Honestly, it was disgusting, I took one bite and didn't bother with the rest. Our server was very nice, and I didn't have a terrible experience, but I certainly cannot rave about this place either. It might be worth a try to go back another time, sit at the bar and have an appetizer on a less crowded night, but with the multitude of restaurants in the area, I don't know if I actually would."}
{"text":"This is a nice place to go after u go hiking at red rock or if you live close by. They have a good happy hour menu. If it's a nice day outside you can go sit on the patio and if it's a little cold they have heaters outside which is nice. I've heard that the lobster macaroni is really good there so that will be something I will try next time I go. I got a burger with a lettuce wrap which was good."}
{"text":"The best crème brûlée I ever had, really friendly place with awesome music..!! And the service was amazing with a smiling and charming lady... Had a great night...!"}
{"text":"A local friend of ours suggested this place for dinner. It was our second night in Vegas. This restaurant is located at \"The Linq\" A chic, hip strip full of shops, eateries, and the \"High Roller\" the worlds largest \"observation Tower\" (Ferris wheel). 

We have a Yard House in San Diego, but we've never been. We'll have to visit soon,  'cause this place was pretty good. Simple yet fancy menu items. I had the truffle cheeseburger. Simple burger on a plate with some fries and sliced pickles. It was really, really good! 

Good happy hour menu. The wife recommends any beer cocktail, and she tried most of them! Not to mention the many beers they have on tap. I'm not a big drinker so I kept ordering 5oz. \"shorties\" of whatever beer I felt like trying. I tricked myself, it felt like I wasn't drinking as much, but after 2 or 5 of those, I was feel in REALLY good. 

Service was good and the atmosphere was chill. We'll have to try the one back home in S.D. soon!"}
{"text":"Probably our 4th visit....always tied to a movie, so usually late afternoon.  Every visit before would have gotten a 4.  This one, we ordered wine and calamari and the calamari was soggy and .......that does it for me.  We left and went elsewhere.

Plus their prices are way out of line!!!!"}
{"text":"I like Yard House.  Have gone to Desert Ridge in the past - my first time at Westgate.  Gret server.  Appetizer was very slow in arriving (think the kitchen just missed the order) and it was comped without us saying a thing.  Four of us tried some new (for us) items and we were all pleased.  Three different salads - all very good, plus a Gorgonzola burger (very good)."}
{"text":"I've been here many times, in groups of two or three, and I've always had great experiences.  

The menu is really extensive, and everything we've tried has been tasty.  My go-to order is their delicious seared ahi sandwich - great fish, carmelized onions, swiss cheese - yum!  

They also have a bunch of vegetarian items that use Gardein instead of beef/chicken - the BBQ chick'n pizza is my friend's favorite. The tuna burger and fish tacos are also yummy, and if you save room for dessert, the macadamia cheesecake with caramel sauce is sooo worth it!  The beer and wine list is definitely exteensive, too - great Malbec.

My friend and I like to have girl's night here, and we consistently get terrific service from start to finish - quick greeting, prompt delivery, lots of check-backs, full waters - without any irritation from the servers when our chat lasts longer than dessert."}
{"text":"It was about 1am. After a failed night at Nu Sanctuary,  (fail on them, not on us) my friends and I decided to head over to Yard House and hang out.

I was sad to find no happy hour, but that was my bad for going so late. :[ This meant that I had to pay full price for my appetizers? I haven't done that in...well, ever. 

Since I had to DD, I ordered a plate of fish and chips. I must admit, those were some pretty good fish and chips. It's not THE best I've ever had (check out my Mad Greek review for that), but it is definitely up there.  

I was surprised to find out that their last call is at 1:45.  It reminded me of being in California.  I didn't think any place in Vegas had such an early last call, but since they close (what? they close?) at 2, it makes sense.  

Despite us being there so late, I didn't feel rushed to leave.  I truly appreciate that because so many places are egging you to leave when it comes to the last 15 minutes of business hours.  Instead, they started to clean up around us, close up the bar, etc, but our waiter still came by to see if there was anything else we needed or wanted and even came by past last call just to double check we didn't want anything else.

Overall, I am down to go back. Hopefully, I'll make it for happy hour. :D"}
{"text":"Been to other locations and they are typically good.  Had a chopped salad and poke stack app for lunch with an alaskan amber beer.  It was all very good.  The bartender was good but could have been a little more social or talkative.  Either way, would go back."}
{"text":"Been her several times and always found it to be good.  This time it was even better.  Glad to see they are stepping up their game a bit.  The 100+ beers on tap are always good and the wines by the glass are good enough (not great but what you would expect).  The sliders and fries are always good.  My friend ordered a spinach dip of some kind (app), he liked it very much.  Suprised he didn't swallow the plate and a piece of the bar with it.  It was busy, the bartenders were very attentive, and I will be back.  Happy hours here are good as well."}
{"text":"If you are a beer lover come here. Great recommendations from the bar tender. The menu is organized in types of beer which is great. My husband and I had the French dip and French onion soup - so good. The place is clean - stainless steal bar, a little dark inside but nice. We will be back again!"}
{"text":"We went to yard house yesterday for the first time in several years.
Pros: Fantastic Kids Menu.  For seven bucks you get a huge meal, drink, and dessert.  I haven't seen a better offer for kids in the Valley.  Large menu and great beer selection.  
Cons:Taco portion is small for the money, and quality was just OK.  Sandwich portion was large, but just mediocre in flavor.  Service was kind, but slow at times.  The servers were trying to be attentive, but I believe the pure size of this place make things slow at times; ie can we have ketchup."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times and it's always consistent!
We are always seated right away without a wait and the food is always so good!
We've tried something different every time but I would definitely recommend their deviled eggs as an app. Their seasonal chopped salad was amazing too! 
Portions are really big here also."}
{"text":"Great place ... We always have to come here at least twice a month we love it ... And the rib eye stake amazing"}
{"text":"The only thing that redeems the Yard House is its phenomenal beer selection.  There's honestly nothing better than seeing a million taps in front of you, especially if you're the person who prefers beers on tap over any other alcoholic beverage.  My usual is the house honey blonde, but I do enjoy changing it up for darker beers or different flavors sometimes.  I usually end up sitting at the bar because at a table the service is hit or miss.  This isn't to say the service at the bar is a million times better, but I definitely enjoy the bar more than a table.  

As for the food I have my usuals that I always go to.  Yard House to this day still has some of the best truffle fries I have ever had.  Sometimes I've been disappointed with them coming out soggy, but flavor-wise, they're still on point!  I love the queso here as well!  I tend order those two as my meal and call it a day.  

Yard House at Town Square is definitely an easy staple in my life.  It is half way between my apartment and my best friend's apartment and we love the beer selection!  Other than the service, there really isn't anything I can complain about!  We always come back time and time again!"}
{"text":"Updated Review:::: I gave this place a second chance! After being over my previous experience I visited them five times. All the other times I attended were great! Management must of done something to fix the issues. They were clean at all times, all the people were friendly, we received our food in time, no hassle. I hope this continues to be the case going forward and I shall continue to return. 

Awful customer service! Why is there a
Gratitude included in the bill? I would have left $0.00 as a tip. My friends and I came to enjoy great food and drinks needless to say nothing about the experience was great not even the drinks. We came in 8pm an hour went by and I still hadn't gotten my food so I asked the waiter what was going on? Obviously he had forgotten about it. It wasn't until 9:30 that I received my food and I got to speak with the manager. Thanks for taking care of my appetizer I would have given you two stars, but everyone else got charged extra for food and drinks. Their bathrooms were disgusting and no pens to sign off my tab with????? Seriously never coming back again!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurant in town but, I don't think it'll be anymore after last night's visit...we didn't have any silverware when we got the food so, we were waiting for waitress to come by so, we can let her know we don't have them but, she didn't come by for about another 10min we were just staring at our foods just sitting in from of us we couldn't eat so, finally my fiancé got up went to look for anybody to grab them ourselves and by that time my noodles weren't hot enough and wasn't even that good this time I don't know maybe I lost my appetite or something. Over our dinner date was kinda ruined here and won't be back for a while"}
{"text":"I've worked in the Westgate bar/restaurant industry for over 2 years and I know how crazy busy everyone can get. Nonetheless, the managers, hostesses, servers, and bartenders always take good care of you! I definitely recommend sitting at the bar top- Darin and Jose will take care of you!"}
{"text":"Loved this place.  Great vibe, great food, great service.  Group got the rib eye, which was excellent, the pineapple chicken, fantastic and the I highly recommend the fried mac appetizers dipped into the tomato bisque, my new fave!"}
{"text":"Great place, great food, great service, great atmosphere!  This is the perfect place to go before or after a Coyotes hockey game, movies, shopping or if you just want to have a great time at Westgate. 

Highly recommended, will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"My friend and I went there for happy hour. Unbeknowst to us, it was biker week and the place was very busy but we were still seated right away. I love their Hawaiin Mule. If you like a Moscow Mule and also like pineapple, you will love this drink. One of the dishes we ordered was the spicy tuna roll. It is not presented like you would think from a Japanese restaurant. It was a circular stack of layers of cucumbers, edamame, carrots, guacamole and spicy tuna in the middle. It wasn't a big deal that this was not the traditional spicy tuna roll, but the tuna was not good. And the proportions of every else was just off and not balanced well. A manager had happen to walk by to check on people and she stopped at out table. Everything was great and we just told her about the spicy tuna roll. She apologized and offered to take it off the bill which we did not expect. We were just explaining to her that they may want to take that item off the menu. I had ordered the poke stack and I thought the tuna was fine. Despite being so busy there, the service was still impeccable and we never waited long for something to drink or a refill. Everything else we ordered was delicious."}
{"text":"Here is a great example of why I can't seem to lose weight...

Great beer and awesome food.

Calamari was good--tasted like anywhere else.

BUT the mac n cheese is the real deal. Boyfriend and I split it and it was more than enough for both of us. Rich, delicious heaven with roasted chicken, mushrooms and bacon pieces in it.

Service is okay...one of those places where the server takes your orders but doesn't deliver the goods. It's fine, just seems like they're held less accountable for good service."}
{"text":"Had take out for an employee luncheon, a total of 8 lunches and none of the food was great. The fish and chips with truffle fries was flavorless, the penne pasta was over cooked, the bbq chicken salad was decent but nothing special the French dip sandwich has rubbery roast beef and was inedible. The avocado spread on the turkey clus was brown and the chicken sandwiches with avocado also contained brownish avocado and rubbery chicken. All in all a large disappointment out of all the food the only good thing we had was onion rings and even they were overly greasy. Not a place I would order from again nor would I recommend to a friend"}
{"text":"Originally liked the yard house chain when living in Kansas City, good food and drink selection. Figured that all would have the same great service. Not so. This location had very poor food a year ago when we visited Scottsdale.  This year we realized that the hours were incorrect when we arrived just after midnight thinking they were open until 2pm as it says. Not so. They close much earlier. Check before you take a late night trip to Yard House. Good luck."}
{"text":"This fruit hadn't ripened yet. Unfriendly unknowledgeable bartenders. The yard house feel is not present here. The limited drafts and specials are not available. The bartenders seemed bothered to serve us. I would pass this place up till they get their act together."}
{"text":"My husband's family took us to a concert at the Jobing.com arena. We needed somewhere close to eat. All restaurants were swamped from concert goers, but when we walked up to the packed Yard House, they were very accommodating and we took their last table outside. Thankfully on a hot summer day, the misters and prompt service of water made everything okay.

While the restaurant was totally full, our waiter never seemed stressed and checked in on us often. He was very knowledgeable about all the beers and even provided our table with a sample.  I tried a happy hour martini. I would never not pay happy hour prices for their drinks. It was okay, but I think if I am ever there again, I would just get a glass of wine (since I don't drink beer)

As for the food, I chose their 4 cheese pizza which was on happy hour pricing. It was 11 inches and only 6 dollars and change! What a deal and a yummy pizza to boot! I decided to add pepperoni onto it. Each topping is 1.00. My husband and his sister had burgers which were some of the best I have tried. Be warned that their BBQ sauce is on the sweeter end, but all sauces for your burgers are on the side. Their fries are those yummy thin fries that make it easy for you to eat a lot of them. Members of our table also ordered a Cobb Salad which was good and Jambalaya. If you can't make it to New Orleans, this will do the trick!

I would have given this place a three if it wasn't for the pizza (especially with the amazing happy hour price) and the burgers. So I say come during happy hour."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my first time here. Location is convenient to the Flamingo, Linq, Harrahs or Caesars. 

Our party of 8 was seated within about 10 minutes near the bar. Ordered a half yard of the very good house IPA and that tided me over until my Nashville hot chicken sandwich arrived. You HAVE to get the half yard glass. C'mon it's Vegas. 

The sandwich was delicious. Best Nashville hot example I've had so far. Fries were tasty, a hair salty but and the right amount of crisp.

Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Yard House is usually a hit or miss however I came here this past weekend with my co-workers and had a BLAST! I think it's safe to say that I liked this location a lot better than the one at Town Square! When we walked in we were immediately sat! Awesome right off the bat! Our waiter David was ummm... full of energy to say the least... The drinks that were ordered did the job for sure. I have to recommend the \"Escalade Margarita\" for all those margarita lover's because let me tell you it's fantastic! Food was meh and the only reason I didn't give them 3 stars was because of the service. Truffle fries are amazing. The sliders that are on the appetizer are not so great, wasn't impressed. The jerk chicken boneless wings we ordered tasted nothing like \"Jerk Chicken\" and we were honestly too hungry to send them back but I would NOT order those again. desert was some new crumble cake not exactly sure but check my pictures! Overall I would return especially for the drinks!"}
{"text":"I came here on the spur of the moment because there wasn't much else open late night on Sunday. I use to go to Yard House all the time when I lived in a different city and loved it. This location.. Well.. I mean it was just okay because I really didn't feel anything was 4-5 star worth type of service. The drinks are what was really disappointing. Our waiter was very friendly and cool however that didn't make up for the weak drinks that the bartender was pouring up that night. I ordered a long island because I know it should have a PUNCH to it, and it wasn't even a jab to say the least. My bf ordered a Long Beach and that too wasn't made well. When we were asked would we like another drink from our waiter I had to kindly decline and let him know that the first round was awful. He informed me that they do some sort of measuring technique and I guess can't pour more alcohol than what's listed. I don't know but we ended up only ordering appetizers off the happy hour specials because after the under whelming drinks I was ready to depart! Chicken nachos are HUGE and filled with flavor, Calamari was great as well. Will I be back? Maybe..."}
{"text":"So went here on Thanksgiving for something to eat since I had to work and could enjoy a nice meal with my family. 

The host was great she sat us down rather quickly, she also got us started on some waters and told us our waiters name while we looked over the menu. 

I waited was a little slow at first (I think they were just to busy) and didn't stop by very much to check on us, in fact the manager had to come by and get our drink and appetizer order. Manager was super assume and friendly.  

Once out waiter stoped by to take our order the food was cooked perfectly and out quite fast. I would definitely be going back to this location. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a nice chill spot in a good location with shopping and gambling near by that is not on the strip. Away from the tourist."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday afternoon.. The wait wasn't too bad but when we were called to be seated I had one waiter almost run me down and right after I had another waiter on my heels where I had to let him pass me.  I'm sorry a 7 month pregnant woman doesn't move fast enough for the staff there.  We ordered our food and I added a soup but when I got the soup it was barely warm... Clam chowder isn't very good cold :(  The enchiladas stack was delicious and our waiter was very good.  unfortunately we were seated by the bar area where we had to deal with drunk people stumbling towards us to get to the restroom and having to hear drunk people yell across the restaurant because of how intoxicated they were.  Not a good place for a family to have dinner.  I had to explain to my 9 year old why people were acting \"weird\".  If you plan on trying to carry on a conversation good luck! Ur better off texting across the table.  Couldn't hear one thing my husband was saying to me.   Over all horrible dining experience... Nothing like the Yard House in Long Beach CA."}
{"text":"Great place to go for a happy hour with a large group of people....for the appetizers, beers, sports, the crowd and the drink selections.
They have plenty of room for larger groups and have small, cozy spaces for a quick, couples escape to enjoy each other & good conversation."}
{"text":"Im so excited for the opening of the Yardhouse at the Linq, Ive always love this retaurant even back when I was living in san diego. I plan on coming here soon."}
{"text":"Good taplist, good service. A decent place to grab a craft beer on The Strip."}
{"text":"The happy hour is the best in town. The bar staff was very friendly and I fund them more attentive then the typical wait staff. Many others share this because the bar is almost always full. Hangout and watch for an open seat, one will come open. If you have more then four you may be SOL!"}
{"text":"Ordered half Mac n cheese with gardein with chips and guacamole along with merlot red wine. The host who sat us made sure we were aware of where the restrooms where located. Our server was very fast with ordering and having us checked out."}
{"text":"Met up with friends here tonight to watch the Cardinal game.  After eating and enjoying my 2nd glass of wine, the waitress came over to our table and dumped a tray with a couple glasses of water or something!  Broke glasses, etc., both my friend and a got pretty drenched.   We both had to get extra napkins to dry ourselves off along with our purses and shoes.   It was the worst I have ever been \"spilled on\" in my life.  We walked outside a couple times just to try and help dry our clothes off.    Management would only take off one glass of wine for each of us.   It was ridiculous!   Not that we were trying to get everything comped, but they could have taken our beverages off the bill.  Won't be back there anytime soon.  We had to leave our seats just so they could sweep up the broken glass and mop up all the liquid.  What a joke.  A really good restaurant would have comped everything, we had split a meal, so our tab wasn't that much....their loss."}
{"text":"I have to start off by saying that I was a fan of the Yardhouse in Town Square. We went to the LINQ this Saturday for date night and went here for dinner.  WE ordered drinks and had the chicken strips and fries as an app, delicious.  

My boyfriend ordered the BBQ buger and I ordered the Cajun Chicken Penne pasta.  His burger came out cold and burnt, he ordered it med well.  My past came out....with NO pasta!  They took back both of our orders and when they returned, the burger was in no better shape and my pasta was disgusting.  

I would be giving them a one star, but the manager comped our entire meal, it was such a mess!  Don't think I will be going back to Yardhouse anymore."}
{"text":"Ahhh the Yard House, its good for a date or for family. Been here for both many times and loved it. Their menu is quite diverse, usually offering something for everyone. I love their chicken nachos, being someone who hates nachos, that says a lot. There is no liquid cheese involved! It's a heap of grilled chicken, beans, sour cream, guacamole, fresh shredded cheese that's melted, on chips. I also love their turkey club. The bread is perfectly toasted, turkey is juicy, bacon is crispy, and avacado is creamy. Their garlic parmesan fries are to die for. I did not care too much for their pizza though, had the margarita and I've had better. Service is always good and the ambiance is nice."}
{"text":"Service was terrible the management was rude and not worth the wait or the bad experience"}
{"text":"Great service, great food, awesome music. Love this Yardhouse. They always accommodate my large parties and still manage to get our orders right, food out within a good time, and split our checks right. Awesome! Thanks"}
{"text":"I like Yard House for the huge menu of food and beer!! Some standard classics like nachos (they're huge and delicious), deviled eggs (mmm!!!), and mac n cheese (can never go wrong there!) as well as some creative items like pork belly, swordfish, or chicken tinga street tacos, gardein (meat free meat) entrees, jambalaya, and more. I also like the firecracker boneless wings.

I like the Kronenbourg 1664 beer and Ace Perry cider.

Every time I've gone, I've had great service, too. The booths are very comfortable and the tables are big enough to fit your drinks and plates on!
It's louder at night than at lunch.
I go about once every month or two for lunch or dinner.


Only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is it's pretty pricy, and I've never made it to Happy Hour."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my husband and kids while on family date night! Usually we frequent the Yard House that is located in town square so this was to be a refreshing change of atmosphere with the same great food! 

Upon arrival, we were greeted and told that there would be a 30 min wait. The wait wasn't a big deal because they have a really nice waiting area out front with shade and cool sights! The buzzer went off with 5 mins to spare for us to order from the happy hour menu and the server was awesome about taking our order immediately!! 

The kids chose their favorites calamari, pepperoni pizza, and fries! Hubs had the buffalo bites and steak sandwich and I chose to order my favorite blue crab cakes and copy his steak sandwich order because I didn't want to keep asking to bite his food. 

The calamari was perfect! Crispy, chewy, and just perfect... to the kiddos it's considered the best in town! The pizza was pizza! Not amazing, but again it was for the kids! The fries. This time the fries were a bit off, I'm guessing because I had to request them ( they'd forgot to bring them) that I'd gotten a flash fried order was the reason they were a tad limp.. or maybe because they were swamped.

On to the adult meal. My blue crab cakes were meh today! Crispy on the outside but the inside as well as the sauce was cool. I can only assume they were done before the rest of food was the reasoning behind this travesty! I will admit the flavor was delicious.. and I know it would have been an a+ if it was hot! The steak sandwiches were a visit saving dish!! It corrected all previous wrongs and just made everything right! Cooked medium, the garlic aioli, the onion strings, and the au jus were all on point! It was so filling and I practically forced myself to finish it!

Overall im satisfied, we are a large family of 6 and most nights I barely get food out piping hot! As long as my kids left happy I'm happy!"}
{"text":"Happy hour 3-6 lunch specials 12-5! get there at 3 for a little bit of both :) :) :)"}
{"text":"I've come here a handful of times for Happy Hour and boy am I happy when I eat here.

First off , the selection of beer is magnanimous. I don't know too much about beer, but when I see a menu of 10 pages devoted strictly for beer...legit is all I must say. Very tasty beer, and a +1 for having my fav beer, Guinness, in stock.

The HH menu is also very large. Some of my favorites are the wings, sliders (turkey, kobe beef, classic), and nachos. Tasty.

Definitely my go to spot when it comes to HH."}
{"text":"Great menu with lots of choices and classic rock music (that means the 70's, not the 90's little yelpers).  I have found the food to always be good, although they sometimes run out of things (ahi or crab cakes in particular).  I do think it's a bit expensive, but I really have to knock down a star as service is so erratic.

Had great service the other night.  But the visit prior, we left before ordering, after a good 10 minutes with no one to take a drink order.  The best part, the hostLess who took her time in seating us while she finished her personal conversation, thanked us for coming in as we walked out.  I guess they didn't hire her for her brain."}
{"text":"I LOVE the YH! I miss the one back home.  However, this is great too. You must check them out for their HH specials. I LOVE their Georgia Peach Martini's and any of the raw tuna HH specials. However, get the sauce on the side. I thought it was overly salty and inedible, but on the side it was fine.  Their creme brulee is always great too, but not on the HH price. Awesome music, clientele and environment. I am very much liking the \"Westgate\" area. Excellent customer service from both Jamie/Waitress and one of the Managers/Mike. Happy New Years! :)"}
{"text":"Super pricy food- we'll aim for happy hour going forward. Lots of beers were tapped out- kind of surprised by that. But still got an IPA I wanted. Slow day today so noise wasn't an issue- place is MASSIVE! Got two tacos- they looked light on the portion but the taste was good. Chips were super fresh. Just stopped in for an app and a beer- customer service was great. We'll come back for happy hour food!"}
{"text":"Really good food. Loved the blackened chicken sandwich. Other stuff we had (all of it was good) Mac and cheese with bacon, cease salad, garlic fries. If there is a downside it would be all the tvs if you aren't into that. The food is  better than you ever get at a normal sports bar.bloved it."}
{"text":"My first visit here with the family was quite good.  It was evening and it was crowded.  We had to wait at the bar for a table so we enjoyed a cocktail in the electric sports themed lounge with TVs in every direction.  Service was pretty quick.  My wife tried one of their signature concoctions called an Upper Manhattan which is basically a Manhattan with peach puree.  She loved it and it's become one of her regular libations.  

Once seated our server was very friendly and efficient.  Our food arrived reasonably quickly and we all enjoyed what we ordered.  I left on a positive note and looked forward to a return visit which happened about a week ago.

Our second visit was during the restaurant dead hour - just before 3 pm and happy hour.  We opted for an outside table which was nice despite the occasional disruptive breezes.

I ordered a cocktail . . . a regular Manhattan which I specified but apparently the young server was unfamiliar with this classic so I eventually received an Upper which is a tad too sweet for me.  I say eventually, because it took a very long time to get my drink and after the arrived, the waiter was no where to be found so I had to bring it back into the bar to ask the bartender what it was.  He confirmed it was an Upper but he cheerfully agreed to make me a standard Manhattan which was returned to our table liquidity split.

We placed our lunch order and regretfully, like my cocktail, it took forever to arrive.  If it hadn't been for the positive experience during our first visit, I might have downgraded my rating to 3 Stars but I know what this establishment is capable of so I presume the slowness in service was due to the hour of the day and changing of shifts.  

I will say that our food was equally delectable as our initial visit.  I would definitely return here again but I would be more careful about the time of day for my next visit."}
{"text":"Of course we enjoyed our dinner tonight! Got the chicken lettuce wraps, and the Hawaiian burger!! Grabbed some shock tops too! We sat at the bar and the bartenders were great! Service was perfect up there."}
{"text":"First off, I must say that this review is specifically for this particular Yardhouse.  I also want to add that I am a big fan of Yardhouse in Town Square but definitely not this one!  I am writing this review after the third visit and third strike against this place.  Drove all the way across town to meet some friends and showed up at 5pm for Happy Hour.  At this time, we were told that it would be a 15-20 min wait.  One hour later we were very frustrated and still waiting to get a table!  We had a 2 y/o with us which made the wait even worse.  I have never been to a restaurant in town at 5pm and had to wait an hr to get a table and I feel this is unacceptable at this time especially when there are tables sitting empty inside!  They finally call our name and we are seated.  Our waitress comes up and we immediately see that she is a scatterbrain (says a quick hello and apologizes saying she will be right back?)  Ask to see a manager immediately to see if we can do anything about missing happy hr.  Manager comes over and is a decent enough guy who says any drinks and appetizers will be at happy hr pricing but doesn't have a reason why it took an hr to be seated?  Order drinks and it literally took 3 tries with our waitress to get our drink order right.  When she finally did, it took another 20 mins to get a pint of beer???  This continued through our meal and needless to say, we were all upset and unimpressed!  The food all arrived cold and unappealling as well.  This very poor service/waitstaff has been experienced all three times at this location and I will not be coming back.  The friends we were with go there about 3 times a week and also said they will not be returning here.  Loser here in my book that needs to really get their act together!"}
{"text":"We keep going to this place because we enjoy the food but the service is consistently terrible. They often get your order wrong and have to have it remade but never bother to tell you that it's being remade... I'm not sure why I just waited 45 minutes for a chicken sandwich"}
{"text":"First time visiting the yard house in vegas. If you are looking for a great meal and love ale this is the place to go! The food was delicious and portions were great. I had the sirloin we also ordered the salmon spinach dip clam chowder and chicken tortilla soup. We are food lovers and only seek the best quality of food. I'd give this place 10 starts if i could. Our server was Erin, she was very helpful and very attentive. Nit to mention the high roller ferris wheel is right in front of this restaurant.  You cannot miss this place!"}
{"text":"The yard house, where to start on this pretentious place.... Oh i know i will start from the bartender. OK so me and a few friends went here for a few drinks and maybe to talk to some ladies or possibly trannys my friend Sean is all into that, and i say don't knock it till u try it, anyway we sat at the bar and waited for our list of beers, when all of a sudden a man/pedofile crept out of the shadows gliding towards us as if he was wearing heelies or he was a fucking vampire!! he was very creepy and was wearing a trench coat and and a strap on, this guy was fucking creepier than Willam Defoe and it the clown combined!! I am almost 90% sure this guys is on AmberAlert.com, so he crept up to us and was like what can i get u guys...perhaps a beer, appetizer, or maybe a sacrificial virgin!! lightning struck at that very moment as my friends and i screamed like we just saw a picture of Al Roker's vagina!! we tried to keep it cool because we didn't want to end up in a dog kennel in the back of this guys van. I ordered the greatness which was Great white coastal stout and Guinness, it was pretty good but for 8 bucks it wasn't that good. My friends ordered some fucking daiquiris or some fruity shit like that cause there a bunch of pussies. We were thinking about getting another drink and the bartender rose out of the ground as if he had an elevator shoot him out of the darkest depths of hell!! I asked him what type of beer he liked and he said whatever makes an 8 year old girl pass out the fastest, i looked over at my friend and said they serve colt 45?? I ordered a Black and tan cause fuck it you cant go wrong with that...WRONG, my beer was completely flat and warm, so i asked the candy man for a new drink. he told me the beer was suppose to be flat so that way u can drink it faster, right than i knew....i had been roofied!! he winked at me and started to laugh so sadistically that the walls were crumbling and people were fleeing the bar like it was 9/11!! he pulled out a 2 foot machete and licked the blade and said....Can i get u guys any appetizers?? I said i think were just gonna get a booth, he replied ahhhh the bar is way better, u can see all the kids eating with there parents from this view, and its easy to slip roofies in the beer from here. I shook off the worlds scariest comment, and me and my friends grabbed a table. we looked at the menu for appetizers and i was gonna pass on the food, looked a little over priced. My friend ordered the coconut shrimp and my other friend ordered the spicy Asian glazed wings. When the food arrived my friend got 3 little shrimp over a pile of vegan diarrhea, for about 14 bucks. My friends wings looked pretty good, i tried one and they were alright nothing special, like my beautiful baby Tender Greens! We stuck around and tormented our waitress like the bartender taught us, we got the bill it was pretty fucking expensive for a round of drinks and 2 appetizers, but whatever my friends r rich assholes so they paid....i mean rich sweethearts ; ) as we were leaving the bartender flipped down ward from the ceiling like a vampire and said hope u guys have a .....lucky night!! we said, trembling with fear, alright cya.....he replied oh...you will.....you will and let out the loudest creepiest laugh like at the end of predator. the next day my friends went missing and the only evidence that was left of them was a comped receipt from a bartender ...who never existed!"}
{"text":"Drool....it's the ultimate \"comfort food\" spot in Summerlin.  With an open parking lot, you're only a few steps away from their outdoor patio or main entrance where smiling faces will quickly greet you.  BUT, dinner time can be a small wait.  Yes, it is a popular place and many others know it, so be prepared to grab a drink or two at the bar (if there is space) before your table is ready.

Where to start once you are seated?  A drink, for sure...and they are known for their many choices of beers. Ask your server for the most popular. Wine and cocktails are great too.

For an appetizer, try their Hawaiian poke stack, grilled jerk wings, Buffalo wings, pastrami sliders, Ahi sliders...

Your main meal, you have to try (and share) their Mac + cheese which has a chicken breast, apple wood smoked bacon, wild mushrooms, cheddar and Parmesan cheeses with pasta and white truffle oil. Their Southern fried chicken is also great along with my favorite (and very filling) New York steak salad.  This bad boy has field greens, roasted peppers, avocado, green beans, crispy potatoes and red onion tossed in Gorgonzola vinaigrette with beefsteak tomatoes and fried pickled egg.  Mmm Mmmm...

If you have enough room and you're not afraid to loosen that belt a notch or two, check out their desserts, I enjoyed their macadamia nut cheesecake. A friend had a Kona coffee ice cream sundae and another went \"lite bite\" and ordered their Mini lemon souffle with fresh raspberries and house made whipped cream.

Bottom line, come hungry with many friends to enjoy the evening."}
{"text":"Been here once before. Had memorable service last time with Nikki (but it's been years) We were seated quickly and had our orders taken quickly also. I had questions about a few menu items and Mely was very nice about it and SUPER knowledgeable. She helped me order the perfect meal (vegan) She knew all the substitions, so I felt confident ordering. We went for the kids Gardien chicken strips with edamame in the side, vegan burger and vegan grilled chicken avocado sandwich. Everything was delicious. I highly recommend the chicken avocado sandwich. Mely was very personable and spoke to our 5 year old (he loved her) and she filled our drinks before we even needed to ask. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and beer selection but for airport prices. Also the music in this place is god awful. Its like a nonstop breakup mix tape from the 80s. Overall its good but the pricing is unreasonable do to its location."}
{"text":"I'm giving this location 3 stars only because the manager last night Jose was amazing and had excellent customer service. We used the call ahead feature and got our party of five on the list around 8pm we didn't have to wait too long once we got there and we were pretty excited about this! We sat down ordered our food got our soups and appetizers pretty quickly. It was the entrees that took an hour after our appetizers to get to us. We were talking and didn't even realize that we hadn't gotten our food until we looked over and a party of 8 that sat down before us got up and was leaving. We flagged down the server who was very apologetic and he got the manager and they said something had messed up in the kitchen. By that time we didn't even want our food but the manager really made up for it and he has amazing customer service skills  I will definitely be back solely because of Jose!!"}
{"text":"Darden employees have done it once again! They never fail me in showing excellent service with their customer loyalty that Darden dearly values. The customer and employee relationship that starts, as soon as you are seated, is absolutely phenomenal! This Yardhouse at the LINQ is a must visit! The unique parts of this restaurant are the floating kegs on the second floor, Most but not all employees in here is your friend and EAGER to make your first and every experience the best you've ever had. I never feel hesitant to speak to an employee for specific concerns or needs in food on the menu. Whether it is having an allergy to an ingredient or just simply not liking a particular part of the food you want to order. These employees are very willing to make you a happy customer by always going out of their way to accommodate you!  One advice I can leave you with is, be patient with this location for another year because they are fairly new, if some employees don't give superb customer service, the right information, or don't know every question, you could let a restaurant manager know to train them better. Communication is what makes the world go round! It solves many issues or concerns. I would love mention specific employees who give BEYOND excellent service each time, Martin, Jason, Ryan, and Sky."}
{"text":"This place has an amazing selection of beer,  probably in all of vegas. They have a great menu, American food, and vegan and veggie food friendly,  i mean an entire page of gardein brand food... Also excellent for carnivores.... Awesome"}
{"text":"I love this place! And once I heard they were opening one up in my neck of the woods (Nor-Cal), I jumped up and down with pitter pattering JOY! 

Their happy hour is well worth it. Half off most of the appetizers. Don't miss this one peeps!

The food is somewhat more than the average price but well worth it. About 15 dollars on average for an entree. 

Our order: 
Coconut Shrimp: About 13 dollars for 4 large shrrrammmppss. Yummy coconut crunchy goodness. 13 dollars worth? Eh. I would have liked it a bit cheaper.
Garlic Noodles: Not your average garlic noodles. It was more buttery than garlicy. It's not what you taste in most Chinese restaurants.
Sliders with sweet potato fries: decent. To me, they were just a bit average. But nonetheless, good.

It's a bit dark inside. Sets the mood. :op

Yardhouse, I like you. Yes, I truly do."}
{"text":"We eat here regularly because the food is amazing and the service is impeccable however today there was a live fly in my food and the younger Hispanic manager chose to ignore that fact when it was brought up by our waitress.  I would not have wanted a discount of any kind I was just disappointed that he ignored the incident."}
{"text":"Organic Tomato Bisque is the best tomato soup I ever had. Gardein sliders aren't bad either. For Vegetarians like me they have a entire Gardein part of the menu."}
{"text":"I rather liked it. I would recommend it, but probably wont be back any time soon because it was just \"OK\". I had a regular old cheeseburger and fries, nothing crazy special, and it was pretty good. Beer pricing was average for a restaurant of this sort, but the reason I only give the place 3 stars is because for a joint that proclaims to have the \"worlds largest selection of beers on tap\", their porter and stout selection is pathetic. I know most beer drinkers prefer piss like Corona and Budweiser and Heineken, but us beer snobs are kind of left in the cold it seemed. You'll definitely find something you like, but World Of Beer in Tempe (when it was still around) had a far better selection of beers, regardless if they were on tap or not."}
{"text":"Went in today dinner with some girlfriends it was really nice I liked how the place is set up the dim lighting is a plus. Ordered the pepper jack burger which I substituted the meat with a gardein (sp?) patty since I'm vegetarian. It was surprisingly delicious and the fries were nice and crispy along with the Cesar salad I added for only 2.95 not bad at all let me tell you ! We all enjoyed our food the only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because our server wasn't so attentive as he should of been many times we had to look for him to get his attention and at one point just ended up asking another waiter who was nearby for refills on our drinks"}

I highly recommend the southern punch for you alcoholic drinker types, good stuff. The beers are always good. It never seems to fail we come here when it's slow or we come when it's packed but we always get servers that we have to track down for refills or request. 
  Servers need to be more vigilant checking on their customers needs. Our waiter was on us to order, checking every minute to see if we were ready, poof then he disappeared. We had to hail down waiters for refills not great for customer service so shame on you yard house for that.. Good job cooks!!"}
{"text":"Best beer selection in Scottsdale.  Best prices are during happy hour, make sure you get the chicken nachos!  Great place with a huge food and drink menu.  I was even able to take our Vegan friends here and they had plenty of food to order from."}
{"text":"I got the vampire taco with the chopped salad. Vampire taco had a nice bite to it.... just enough heat which the guacamole mellowed out. The chopped salad was fantastic... seemed like a whole avocado sliced on top! Just enough dressing to be flavorful  but not overpowering. The service was great, and as it was final four weekend I was impressed with the friendly diligence of the guys working the door, checking Everyone's ids and putting on wristbands!"}
{"text":"Good prices gotta love happy hour!! I love the onion ring tower went really well with the house made buttermilk ranch! Great service from our turkey server!"}
{"text":"Exactly what you would expect, this Yardhouse is like all the others.  Sometimes that's what you want, right?  Menu offers a ton of selections so you can be as healthy or as decadent as you want to be.  Vegetarian options, too.  Endless beer selection, if that's your thing.  Ok wine selection and crafted cocktails if you're not into beer."}
{"text":"I gotta give credit where credit is due... Yard House has a pretty massive menu, and something for anyone.  They have a great number of vegetarian options, and a number of items can be made vegan. The beer list here is massive... Pretty sure it's over 80 beers, including rotating seasonals. I like that I can always find a great Belgian beer at YH. They have happy hour Mon-Fri until 6pm that includes both food and drink specials. The onion rings are pretty fantastic, and I've never been disappointed by their pizzas. My bf loves the mac n cheese, and their peppercorn steak. 
This Glendale location is always busy, particularly before a game or concert. Be prepared for a wait if you want a table, and a crowded bar."}
{"text":"Went for Happy Hour and was very happy. Good food although strange combinations of sauces with the menu. Onion rings (good) with a 1000 island type of sauce. Didn't work. pepperoni pizza with schrooms was good with nice crust. had a few other other apps. 3-6 hours on the H Hour and was very loud and full by 5 pm."}
{"text":"After my last review, the management emailed me and was apologetic for the problems we encountered. We gave it a few months and decided to return for another try. We were seated promptly but I wish they would get rid of the tables and just have booths because sitting at a table makes you feel like you are on display! The beer was excellent as usual but this is the first time in probably 40 times we have been here that the service was really bad. I think everyone was having the same problem because I watched some people get up and go to the bar to order their own drinks or chase down their waitress. Perhaps they were understaffed that day or they just had a bunch of retards working! The food was slow but good. I had the fried chicked and my wife had the fish taco plate. Both were cooked to our liking - even though they came to our table on the slow boat!

I'm sure the service problems were just a one time thing so we'll be back again for another review! I hope they can get back to 5 stars because I really enjoy this place when everything is working as intended!"}
{"text":"This was my second time here! I had the chicken fingers a few weeks ago at a friends birthday. The honey mustard was delicious. I won a gift card at work for Darden and that includes the Yard House so I was excited. The food was really good. We ordered the hummus appetizer that was great I'd personally prefer the crispy pita. I also had the french onion soup it was perfect.. way better than outbacks. My date had a caesar salad and the french dip both were great!! The only reason I was unable to give 5 stars was how slow the service was... our server was very nice, had a great personality it was just slow!"}
{"text":"Yard House is my go-to spot for Happy Hour whenever I'm in Vegas! 

My boyfriend and I have been to this location three times this year and have yet to be disappointed. We sit at the bar so I can't comment on the wait staff but the bartenders here are awesome - especially George! Even if we don't sit in his section, he'll usually walk over to us to make sure we're good on drinks or make us cocktails to go (I highly recommend the Sunkissed Sangria and the Tahitian Moonshine). 

The food here is great - several vegan/vegetarian and gluten free options on the menu. I enjoy the summer salad and the mushroom lettuce wraps while my boyfriend loves the chicken lettuce wraps and the nachos. My bf is a big guy and couldn't finish the nachos on two occasions - it's a huge plate so he asked for it to go and gave it to a homeless person on the Strip. 

Dan and I will definitely be back next time we're in Vegas :)"}
{"text":"I ordered the BBQ burger on wheat and the organic tomato bisque. The food came out quickly and was very delicious. The soup had a nice flavor. The burger was cooked perfectly and very juicy. Pretty good service also. Sat outside on the patio because it was a beautiful day."}
{"text":"Family and friends enjoyed great food and excellent service.  The chicken pot pie was topped with lofty puff pastry and the center was filled with a scrumptious chicken and herb filling!  Other meals included a flavorful chopped salad with grilled chicken and a side of tomato bisque.  

Our server was very attentive; checked in with us along the way; and promptly brought our checked when we said we were ready to leave.  We will definitely return in the future."}
{"text":"We love yard house! Bets happy hour choices. Really good pizzas, chicken fingers. we have enjoyed pretty much everything we have tried. It is a nice place for kids since it is on the louder side, and great service every time!"}
{"text":"Really nice place with great food options and drink options.We came here after the ride on high roller and it was a short walk from there.Nice lit up shopping/eating area."}
{"text":"A last minute night out and we lucked out with Derrick as our server...very hospitable, courteous, and down to earth, while also being fun & attentive. Thanks for a great dinner out Derrick :)"}
{"text":"My hubby and I went for their happy hour. Their portions are good for the price but they were all very mediocre. We got the buffalo wings, Thai Chicken Pizza (borderline gross), and the calamari. I gave it 3 generous stars because the service was great."}
{"text":"Great local spot in Town Square with great food and beer. 

Love the Calamari and Spicy Thai Chicken Pizza. My girl is a vegetarian and loves the Gardein Buffalo Wings (made with soy). They actually taste like real meat!

Huge beer selection as well. My favorite is the Petrus Aged Red Ale.......bomb."}
{"text":"A group of coworkers and I visited on April 27. We were less than impressed with the service we received. First off, our server Zack, waited a very long time before he even came to our table, and when he did, he complained about the amount of tables he already had. My friends and I then order the chicken tenders requesting bbq and hot sauce on the side his response was \"can you remind me when the food comes out? The kitchen won't do that, I'll have to do it.\" Why don't you be a little proactive and get it so our food won't get cold while you're fetching the sauce we orders ahead of time. My friend order Korean short rib tacos, a dish she has had many times. When the food came out she questioned it and the severs argued with her telling her it was correct. One even told her to take a bite to double check. They sent out a replacement taco, which looked completely different from the original. Zack still continued to argue it was still correct after the fact, we requested a manager to come over. As soon as the manager looked he said that is a pork belly taco, we then explained out concerns of the entire evening. He then confirmed that the tacos were entered wrong and that he removed them off the bill, he also took 50% off the tab. The manager did a nice job at trying to recover the service, but it will be a long time before I return to Yardhouse, a celebration turned into many issues after another."}
{"text":"Beer Mecca & Food Oasis - GO NOW!!

I could spend my entire dining and drinking experience here at this restaurant.

Las Vegas is not a place you go for beer. The usual taps consist of your traditional watered down american beers. EXCEPT Yard House. The selection of beer here is so massive, it's almost overwhelming, but the bartenders are extremely friendly. I easily struck up a conversation with several of them and they walked me through all of what I was looking for in a beer choice. 

Their menu is equally impressive with a little bit of everything for everyone. The selection spans across several cuisines from around the world with a good helping of traditional american fare. Because it was a hot day at the end of our trip, we both ended up getting a salad, but it was hearty enough to feel like a real meal. 

The price is right, the food is great, the taps are expansive. There's no reason not to go. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great beer, great food, terrible service. I never had to wait so long for beer. Order water with lemon, took so long it had to be in a to go cup and no lemon."}
{"text":"To be honest, I don't know what any of the \"food\" food tastes like. I refuse to spend half a day's pay on an entree. Not all of us living on the west side have MBAs and expense accounts.

The reason I keep coming is Happy Hour. Half-off appetizers, 5 dollar cocktails, and cheap drafts.  I'm not even much of a beer drinker but I'll occasionally let one of the wait staff recommend something light and fruity for me. 

For the most bang for your buck, I'd go with The California Roll, Calamari, Chinese Garlic Noodles, Firecracker Wings,  Onion Rings, and the Four Cheese Pizza. 

For dessert I recommend walking over to the Coldstone Cremery across the street and getting something with butterfinger bits and sprinkles."}
{"text":"I'm either very lucky or this place just knows how to give a group of people good service. I enjoyed the dark and modern theme this place has, along with the simple outdoor dining area as well. The poke nachos are a unique twist and were my favorite. Along with the macaroni, it had a bunch of different and unique tastes and textures that I haven't had before in macaroni and cheese. Yard house would be the place to go for a nice dinner with a group of friends. Right across or at least a little farther down is game works, amc movie theatre, or the grass area. This was placed at a good side of townsquare n everyone needs to try out this place at least once in their life!"}
{"text":"I placed a to-go order today at 11:30.  I was told that my order would be ready in 10-15 minutes.  I arrived at 11:45 and waited and waited.  Finally at 11:55 I was rang up by Jesse and i gave a cash tip.  When i asked how long the order would take, he said 5 more minutes.  He then started seating customer's which is fine.  I only have a 30 minute lunch, so pressed for time at 12:05 i asked how much longer, he very rudely said Ma'am it's only been 5 -7 minutes but I'll check.  He left and came back with our food and said here's your food and your tips in the bag.  So Rude and to give back my tip!  I guess my tip amount for a to-go order was not acceptable.Unbelievable! No silverware!  No checking my food like he did with other customers.  Nothing.  I am a local and I work close to this location.  I will not be going back anytime soon! The one star is for the food.  Jesse took away the other 4 stars."}
{"text":"The vampire tacos are one of the best things on the menu!!! So many amazing beers on tap!! Kim the bartender does a really good job, always friendly!! Megan and Angelica are really awesome servers. Truffle fries always taste amazing!!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch.  Had been to only one other Yard House, which was at Town Square and I loved it!  Was looking very forward to meeting up with a group of ladies from our social meet up group and have another great experience, but at a location closer to home.

I ordered the Tomato Bisque with Grilled Cheese Sandwich.  The Tomato Bisque was wonderful......but the Grilled Cheese was VERY bland.  No flavor at all.  Extremely disappointing.  I also had a French Vanilla Cappuccino, but it was VERY bland - almost like it was watered down.

But the BIGGEST disappointment was our waitress, Janine I believe her name tag read.  She was not very attentive or pleasant.  Our whole table was talking about it,  Maybe she was just busy.

HOWEVER, it took us FOREVER to get her attention so I could ask for a refill on my ice water.  After one of my friends was finally able to stop her, and asked if I could get a refill on my water, she said \"Sure.\" And while walking away from the table my friend and I heard her say, \"I'm keeping an eye on your table.\". We were shocked and just looked at each other for a second.  Then I picked up my water glass and said to my friend, \"Well, if she's keeping an eye on our table, then my water glass wouldn't be empty now would it?\"

Unfortunately, because of her over all service or lack there of today, I gave her probably less than a 10% cash tip so that I could get my point across.  I'm usually AT LEAST a 20% tipper.

Over all, not the greatest experience at your restaurant, not sure I'll be back, and I won't be recommending this location to anyone.  The consensus was the same with all the ladies in my group.  That's SEVEN customers that probably won't be eating at your restaurant again."}
{"text":"We went to Yard House for date night. Parking was convenient and the atmosphere was wonderful even before entering the restaurant. We where quickly seated and greeted by a waiter who was very knowledgeable of menu items, as well as recommendations that where everything he said they'd be. The restrooms where also very clean, no wait there either. My date enjoyed the selection of lagers they had available. The food came out in a very timely manner. While everything was wonderful the best part was still the food. The food was absolutely delicious and exceeded our expectations. It's a bit of a splurge but as far as Yard House goes you definitely get what you pay for. I highly recommend this dining establishment."}
{"text":"Very extensive menu.  Great beer selection.  Side salad was huge.  Chicken penne was good but not great.  Street tacos also just good but the spicy rice is super yum!  Attentive service and our waiter knew the beers really well and made good recommendations.  Lemontini was not good."}
{"text":"I came here at about 6 pm on a Friday to try and snag a table for 7 at 6:30 pm. It wasn't a game night or anything but I was still a bit worried about the wait. By 6:15 the hubby and I were sitting at our table. However, everyone else was showing up at 6:30. The staff was understanding and didn't give us any problems about the wait. 

Our server was fabulous. She was attentive and incredibly pleasant and friendly. She noticed every time someone joined our party and was quick to help them. 

We started with some snacks to kill time while waiting for our friends to show up. I opted for the guacamole and chips. I wasn't too sure about the feta in the guac but it turned out to be good. The hubby had the sweet potato fries and maple bacon dip. I'm not a sweet potato lover but I may have eaten them just for the dip. It was nice to have a \"snack\" sized portion that was perfect for just that - snacking. I had the turkey club for dinner which had avocado on it. It was nothing special but still pretty good. The hubby had a spicy thai chicken pizza that he seemed to really enjoy. Overall, it seemed like everyone in the party enjoyed their meals. 

Their beer selection is pretty awesome. In reality, that was the reason we opted for the Yard House for dinner. The server was great at knowing what they had run out of and what wasn't on the menu.  For those unfamiliar with beers, she seemed to know what to suggest based on tastes. 

At the end of the meal, there was no issue splitting the check and getting separate bills. That was refreshing from what I'm used to. Overall it was a pretty good dining experience and I wouldn't hesitate to come back again."}
{"text":"My family and I have been there twice in the past week. It is THAT GOOD. The Hawaiian Poke Stack is awesome. I don't think I will ever tire of those. Getting one on Happy Hour is even sweeter. The food is great, and there is a wide variety to suit every taste. The ambiance is nice, as is the music. The service has been above and beyond both times we were there. (Thanks to Stephen and Tom!) My husband loves their amazing beer selection, and I'll admit the lines of taps and the keg room is a sight. I've had the scallops and the cuban dip, both were dishes I'd recommend to anyone. I also appreciate the attention they pay to their \"kid\" guests. Yard House goes beyond the basic child food options, and the selection for them is nice. I look forward to my next trip to Yard House."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick dinner on a Friday night. It was st Patrick's day, so the place was packed. I had the swordfish tacos which were delicious! My fiancé had the corn beef brisket (special) he loved it! Our server was Tyler. He was very attentive and probably the best service we've had in quite a while! Thanks Tyler!! We will be back."}
{"text":"Nothing but great things to say about this place. I like them in Glendale, AZ but love them here!! Mac and cheese w/out bacon...BANGING!!! And Jambalaya w/chicken (not pork) andouille!!! #winning 

We will definitely be back soon!!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times.  Ambiance is good.  Atmosphere is good.

The only problem here is that I've gotten food poisoning 8 out of 10 times from the raw sushi (ahi tuna poke and spicy tuna roll) and raw steak (new york steak sandwich).  It's too bad because those are some pretty good dishes.

If I come back, it would be for non-raw dishes like shittake garlic noodles and other great dishes.  Great bar food but food is not fresh enough for a restaurant.  Cuban roast pork dip was pretty dry.  Not anything near an authentic Cuban sandwich. Banh Mi was so so.  

The california roll is good."}
{"text":"This Yardhouse is a bit unique in it's design due to the building it resides in, but other than that it is your typical YH!! Same selection of beers at a more premium price again due to location, and same mediocre food.
But the fact that you are in Vegas, and in the Linq Promenade makes this worth a stop in. The views are nice, the service is solid and friendly, and of course the beer selection is huge. So if you're in the area definitely stop in!"}
{"text":"Awesome selection of beer.  I usually like to try a sampler.  Half-priced appetizers during happy hour rock!  Food is good though sometimes the sushi isn't so good.  The clientele here seems to be 30ish and above."}
{"text":"Loved the beer 'cocktails'! Ordered the burger with Gorgonzola - delicious. And the truffle fries are TO DIE FOR. Seriously. We ordered them and my mom had to tell everyone how amazing they were. So very good! We will definitely be back on our next vacation, and will recommend to friends & family!"}
{"text":"We were greeted and seated immediately. Our waitress was very knowledgable of the menu and all of the different beers. The food was very good as well! I will definitely be coming back next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I have always loved yard house. They have vegetarian options that are delicious. Tons of great beer choices and great place to meet up for drinks.  Service is usually great.  They are good about putting the games on."}
{"text":"One thing about the Yard House is no matter which one you go to you can always get a good beer and decent food. Unlike other chains this place keeps the prices the same even when on the strip. Justin our server was great, he took the time to give recommendations on beer and other things. We had the mooshoo egg rolls which were good. We also had the shrimp cevice and seared ahi sashimi. It's great they offer options that are not just thrown in a deep fryer. We are locals and we will be back to this Yard House."}
{"text":"Great place. Great food. Great customer service. Our food came at a appropriate time, our waiter kept coming by to check if we needed refills and if everything was fine. Over all it was a nice experience. We went on a Sunday night so it was filled with people watching the game; which we didn't mind, but even with so many people our waiter did a great job on keeping us happy."}
{"text":"I admit it, I'm a Yard House whore. 

I seriously love this place. The restaurant has such a chill and laid back vibe. It's huge and has ample seating. They have nice cushiony booths so if you and a date come by then you can have a semi-romantic dinner on one of those. Want to sit outside? They have a nice patio area in which they have heaters for the chillier days. They have TVs all over the place with different channels. Games are on most of the time. If you want to watch a specific game on a specific TV, all you have to do is ask.

I'm not a big beer person. But Yard House is the one place I will indulge in a glass (or two...or three...). My favorite beer is the Lindeman's Framboise. A Belgian lambic beer, it has the perfect cidery raspberry taste. They serve it in some sort of champagne glass - it makes me want to pinky up because I feel almost sophisticated drinking it! I also love their fruit ciders, especially their pear cider. The Snakebite is also divine - it's a blend of the pear cider and harp. Besides their beer, they have pretty good specialty mixed drinks. One that comes to mind is their Pomegranate Margarita. Tart and pomegranite-y with a pretty presentation!

Their food awesome! My faves are listed below:

[Before i list specific food items, I'd like to say that Yard House has really really good fries. They're super thin and super addicting. If you're into the thick cut steak fries, you won't find them here]

Appetizers
- Seared Ahi Sashimi: About 6 pieces of seared tuna covered in soy vinaigrette is served next to a small bed of red cabbage also covered in the vinaigrette. I really like this dish when it's made right. Sometimes they over-drench the sashimi pieces and the dish becomes ultra salty.
- Onion Ring Tower: Literally, the name says it all. It's apparently beer battered and comes with a chipotle ketchup and ranch dressing. 
- Spicy Tuna Roll: If you're expecting a typical sushi roll, then don't. This is served without rice and as a stack. Bottom layer are edamame and cucumbers. Middle layer is your tuna and the top layer is the avocado. It's a pretty dish. Very innovative. 
- Sliders: Specifically the bearnaise or ahi sliders. Four sliders plus a handful of fries. They call this an appetizer, but the portions are not appetizer-like!

Entree
- Mac & Cheese squared: Chicken, bacon, mushrooms, truffle oil. Can't go wrong with this one. They use wild mushrooms that elevated your boring mac & cheese to the next level. 
[This is it for entrees. I usually stick with their appetizers.]

Dessert
- Chocolate souffle: Small souffle good for one. Scoop of vanilla ice cream on top with mint garnish. Do not leave without trying this. I'm seriously serious. 

Yard House has great happy hour. 3 PM - 6 PM Monday - Friday and 10 PM - close Sunday - Thursday. Drink specials and half off on a lot of their appetizers! Their sliders are discounted as well. Perfect late night meal."}
{"text":"Food was only ok. Did the street tacos. It was super loud inside so hard to hold a conversation. Waiter was horrible and hardly stopped at our table."}
{"text":"Wife and I were there about a month a go for our anniversary and let me tell you the food was great amazing service our waitress that day was Courtney and she was incredible nice really enjoy our time thanks for the great service we were there on 04 24 2014 thanks again for the great food and service"}
{"text":"Ask to seat 8 it takes 15 min in an empty restaurant.  Ask for 6 IPA's. wait 5 min for them to tell us they are out but no worries we have all the other beers we ordered.  10 min later come back with 5 IPA's and tell us the other beer is out too.  Just ridiculous...  Yardhouse should be ashamed, I used to book my sales team into the Irvine Spectrum one for fun but they just lost that business too."}
{"text":"Service was terrible and food wasn't that great. Still have money on my gift card so I guess that's going on beer instead. $44.40 for a burger, chicken plate, wings and 2 waters."}
{"text":"Hard to believe eating on the patio with the outside temp above 105 isn't it?  Well, we were somewhat amazed how the shaded patio  with misters and fans worked at the Yard House.  

We were going to eat inside but it was crowded with a high decibel background.  No one was sitting outside so we sat down to see if it was tolerable.  The U.S. Open Golf Tournament from beautiful Torrey Pines was on so we grabbed a couple of comfy chairs near the misters close to the large HD screen.  We ordered cold ones and the Spinach Appetizer with flat bread.  It hit the spot while watching Tiger come from behind to finish first for the day with one day to go.  It was so comfy we then shared a fresh summer salad with strawberries and candied walnuts or pecans (either one or the other). 

 Next time it is hot (which is until October) check out the efficient misting system at the Yard House.  There's a lot of cold drink choices..."}
{"text":"We had the bbq and cesar kale chicken salads and both were delicious and savory! Take out was a breeze and the customer service person was a star. 

Really good food and service."}
{"text":"Decided to go here before our ride on the Highroller wheel. Wait was about 10 minutes, was expecting it to be longer for our party of 13. Hostesses were friendly. Food was excellent, we had one waiter (Christian) who gave exceptional service. His fellow coworkers (which they all help each other out was also great). Definitely returning back to this Yardhouse when we come back to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I love that place. They have a huge selection of draft beer and the food was amazing. Everything was fresh and cooked to perfection. You can sit outside, they have a nice patio on the second floor.
Service was great too, very friendly and they refilled our water glass all the time.  I am definitely going back!"}
{"text":"My family and I love this place.  It seems to be our go to place because everyone can find something they like on the menu.  The food is always fresh and the servers are very nice and knowledgeable about the beer menu.  My favorites are the tuna poke bowl and spicy tuna roll. Be aware that they don't take reservations of large parties so you may need to wait, especially on the weekend."}
{"text":"It is the only decent spot to pregame in Westgate.  That is why it is 4 stars.  But honestly, I want to give it 3 stars.  

Yard House always end up being the go to spot when other options suck.  It is like that in almost every city.  Or if your too lazy to look and try something new.

Example:
-LA Live is similar to Westgate, but a tad better.  And guess where we end up? Yard damn House.
-Looking for something on a week day night in Long Beach because everything is closed?  YH to the rescue!
-Want affordable drinks in Waikiki?  Or reverse HH?  Yep, Waikiki YH has you covered except for a 1-2 buck higher than the mainland.
-Las Vegas, Well, I don't know why we came to this one, but its was there so we ended up there somehow...

I seriously can go on with all the Yard Houses I have been to.

The best thing about Yard freakin House?  Over a 100 beers on tap, although I consider at least 20 of them worthless.  Like michelob ultra on tap?? Or Coors @Light?  Crap beers.  (sorry no offense to ya'll who like those beers).  I think I saw Red Stripe...

Food is okay.  I have had almost everything on the HH menu plus quite a few of their regular menu items.  Some great some bad, most were okay.  Service is okay.  Everything is usually okay until you start drinking then its fun.

I have never reviewed a Yard House before because that is like reviewing every damn Starbucks I have been to.  I think I will just copy and paste this with some adjustments to the location.

But despite this rant.. I am a fan."}
{"text":"This is probably my new fav restaurant!! I stopped there out of town and I was really amazed by the service. I can't remember my server's name but she was really helpful and nice! The nachos I got were amazing! I'm a very picky person but not even exaggerating... the nachos were the best I ever had! The salsa verde was on point and it tasted homemade! They were loaded and good amount for the price. The turkey sandwich I had was pretty good, I upgraded for garlic fries and they were amazing as well! I'm a big eater, sharing the nachos and my sandwich I had left overs to take home which is rare for me. Next time I'm up there I will go back"}
{"text":"Went there few weeks ago with family visiting from out of town and had a great time! Service was superior, thank you Dani!. Couldn't have asked for better. Food was top notch. Will be back! Adding this to regular rotation for dining out."}
{"text":"I've come here on many occasions and can't say I've had the best experiences.  Yesterday we got the smoked gouda and chicken flatbread and the chicken was completely dried out with little to no sauce.  It was not good.  Then we got the nachos and the guy who brought them out stated the chef cooked them incorrectly and put the pinto beans on top and not on the bottom so we could send them back if we didn't like them.  Why didn't they just fix it in the first place.  The pomegranate margarita was amazing as always.  We sat at the bar and were in front of the drink station where the one bartender continued to obnoxiously slam glasses down when making drinks which was completely unnecessary.  We went here for the convenience but I would go anywhere else in the future."}
{"text":"This place is pretty lively when we went. The atmosphere gave me a Dallas's vibe. The food was good. I had a chicken cesar salad. My friend got some shrimp pasta dish, that was pretty good. Must try their brownie. It's freshly made with your choice of ice cream on top. It's very good, but only when it is hot. When it gets cold, it won't taste as good. So eat it fast."}
{"text":"Yard House is amazing every time I've gone. The service is great and the food is delicious. They have a large menu with a ton to chose from. I love their salads, pizzas, and all of their apps are delish! Grab a bite to eat here after you finish at the mall. I love their outdoor seating."}
{"text":"It's so cool to have one in this location it's right of the las Vegas strip  they have a bunch of beer in tap for you to choose from its right next to the las Vegas bowl and oshas casino the waitress was very nice and on time we had no complaints and kept the day going the waitress I know was happy because we left a fat tip for her,enjoy"}
{"text":"Loved this place. It was my first time going with some friends. Great beers on tap and you can try a new one every time you go. Go after work with some friends and enjoy HAPPY HOUR!!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Unbeatable beer selection. Service was lackluster at the bar but better out on the patio. 

It was Saturday afternoon, a little after 3 and this place was virtually empty with the exception of the patio which didn't have a free table available. We wanted to sit outside since the weather was gorgeous so we decided to grab a drink at the bar while we waited for one to open up. The beer selection is great which can make it a little difficult for an indecisive person to pick just one. After much thought and analysis of the beer menu, I decided not to drink since I was suffering from a cold but my boyfriend chose a local brew which he ended up being quite fond of. After 30 minutes we noticed that there were a few tables open outside so my b.f. went back to the hostess to find out what was going on. She said that she paged our little buzzer a while ago but had figured we had left. Mmmm..hello, we were sitting at the bar where we told you we would be...why wouldn't you come and tell us a table was available? Anyway, after that little blip we closed out the bar tab and moved outside. 

Service outside was better than at the bar which was surprising. After the bar tender took my bf's drink order he wasn't seen again. Another bartender had to close out the tab and refill my water for me. I believe his name was Jay - he was very friendly so I recommend him if you can grab him at the bar. 

The food was good given that it's a sports bar. I liked the fact that there were vegetarian options outside of your typical salad or a veggie burger. They also list which items may still contain animal products for those vegans out there. I opted for the lunch special of a small pizza and salad. The salad was a mix of fresh spring greens tossed in a balsamic dressing - AMAZING. I could have just eaten the salad. I had the BBQ chicken pizza which was tasty but could have used some more sauce. Oh yeah, we also had the chips and guac snack plate to start off with - REALLY good guacamole here which was another shocker. I highly recommend it but be warned, it does have a little kick to it."}
{"text":"3.5 stars would be more accurate for my experience.

My business partner and I had a late dinner and a beer here last night.  There beer selection is second to none (or at least second to very few).  There are not many places that you are going to be able to find Dogfish Head 90 IPA on tap.  My 90 minute was great, good head on the beer.  No issues at all there.

I had the pastrami sandwich and french onion soup.  I am a bit of a fanatic about french onion soup.  I would give their an average to a little above average rating.  The broth/base of the soup was not all the thick but the crouton, onion and cheese were all done well to make up for some what the broth/base was lacking.  My sandwich was good but really nothing more than average.  The pickled jalapenos did give the sandwich a nice kick though.  

I had only had only been to Yard House once before for lunch and would go back more often if I still lived in the area.  

All in all I think Yard House stands out a great spot to get some beers/drinks but the food is a little above average.  I guess that is about what is to be expected when the draw is the massive beer selection.  I would definitely eat there again, just don't see me making a point of it."}
{"text":"Yay what a good happy hour!!! I come here all the time for their happy hour drinks and menu. The wines and mixed drinks are super cheap and delicious! 

All of the food is great! 

Plus you can sit outside on the patio or inside in the lively bar. 

They have a huge selection of beers and wines to choose from."}
{"text":"There is a great dining option on the strip. FANTASTIC tacos (asada steak, swordfish, pulled pork) all amazingly delicious. And only  two $. Under the Linq ferris wheel (literally). Huge space, actually elegant for a brew pub. The Mrs. had a turkey bacon melt on sour dough. Too good. A huge menu, even a separate gluten free menu with a lot of choices. If you take a cab to the Linq ferris wheel, you are dropped off next to Yardhouse. Ask for Rosie, she was a great server."}
{"text":"They have lots of televisions for sports. Dark atmosphere great for watching a game or catching dinner after shopping. The siracha Bloody Mary was delicious! It came with a piece of meat on top :). Service was super slow and the food was good but not great."}
{"text":"We've been coming to Yardhouse for years. Usually pretty reliable.  Good food.  Tons of variety on the menu.  Huge beer selection.  Service has never been exceptionally good but not bad either. 

Tonight was the worst meal we've ever had and we won't be returning.  

Sat down pretty easily in the patio on a beautiful Vegas evening.  One of my sons ordered a kids pepperoni pizza with a side of mashed potatoes.  That was tasty.  

My other son ordered an adult mac and cheese.  That was decent.  

My wife ordered the chicken lettuce wraps and she really enjoyed it.  

I ordered the bacon cheeseburger.  That was okay.  Way too much bbq sauce all over the plate.  I had a side ranch salad that was flavorless and soggy.

The worst was the penne pasta that my teenage son ordered.  It was awful.  Flavorless.  We told the server and she said she would bring more sauce because the kitchen probably didn't put enough sauce on it.  

Personally I would've just taken it off the menu and replaced that entree.  

Probably the worst thing that happened was when a different server brought a clam chowder to our table.  When he dropped the soup off, he also placed an order of fries on our table that was supposed to go to another table.  My 6-yr old didn't realize that and grabbed a fry.  The server saw that, grabbed the little bowl of fries, and took it to the table that it was supposed to go.  That's just weird.

I left a 15% tip and wrote a note to the server that she should've removed the dish that we barely ate.  Poor service = lower tip for the server and no return visit to the restaurant.  

Too many options in Summerlin to waste money here."}
{"text":"Love the crispy brussel sprouts and potatoes as an appetizer here! If you order them ask for the dressing on the side not on them....it makes a huge difference!   Cobb salad was fresh and delicious too. Eddie was our server and he was great. This place tends to get very crowded on the weekends so plan accordingly or be patient!"}
{"text":"Alexis, is a fantastic host, Jay is a very accommodating manager, great food, great environment, I'll be back on a regular basis!"}
{"text":"Wow ! This place was a surprise for me !!!
As it's a bar at Town Square I thought the food would be average but not much more.

I just ordered a grilled cheese with French fries instead of the tomato bisque that it usually comes with.
OMG ! The best grilled cheese I've eaten in the whole US so far ! It was made with 4 different kinds of cheeses : Fontina, Gorgonzola, Cheddar and Swiss. Made with artisan bread and also slices of roasted tomatoes. Perfectly grilled with the running melted cheeses. Sooooo good !
The French fries were cut very thin so they were very crispy, not fattening at all and so much better than the big ones with skin you usually get. 
So that small \"nothing special\" meal turns out to be simply great !

I have to say we were a party of 8 and everybody loved their meal. Pasta, tuna, tacos, grilled salmon, no left overs.

Look at the pictures to see the sizes of the draft beers. Humongous !

The only thing we didn't go crazy for was desert. We mostly had Crème Brûlée. But it had bananas on top of it instead of the usual crispy caramelized sugar and chocolate at the bottom. Not exactly what we expected. Good but definitely not to \"die\" for like the rest of our meal..."}
{"text":"One Liner: 100 Beers On Tap!

Food: (scale of 0-4) 3.2
Anything that starts with 100 beers on tap automatically gets 3 stars before I even get into the food. The food was great. First of all, the firecracker wings had one of the most creative sauce that was sweet sour with a nice kick at the end. Then comes the Chilean sea bass. It was perfectly cooked with a soy based sauce on it. The baby bokchoys were also nicely done. Consuming this food while trying one beer after another, you just can't beat that even in 120 degree heat.

{"text":"I feel like every time I go here it gets a little more fancy. The prices are a little above average, but the quality is there to warrant it. I had fantastic service and was really impressed. For some reason one of the guys at my table was giving our server a hard time about splitting our bill but she took it in stride and was more  then accommodating to his needs.  

The bacon burger seemed small when it came out but by the time I was finished, I was satisfied. The main attraction for this place are the beers. They have a HUGE selection of beers and the vast majority of them are on draft. For me this is awesome for two reasons; 1) I LOVE BEER and they have lots, 2) I will take a draft beer over a bottled beer every time! 

I am really looking forward to going back were I can spend more time drinking and less time eating."}
{"text":"First thing is first - I'm not sure why they have \"entrances\" from inside Red Rock Casino, but on the night we visited, we were waiting at what we found out was the BACK of the restaurant.  A bus girl had to tell us that the front desk is across the restaurant to get a seat.

My wife and I visited this place tonight and we had a pleasant time.  

To drink, I had a water (from the tap) w/ lemon and she had an iced tea.  The ice tea was unsweetened.  The waitress did a good job of keeping our glasses full.

For an appetizer, I ordered the Ahi Poke Bowl.  I am a poke nut and I was satisfied.  For the price, the portions seemed correct.  It was served with two large chip wafers, guacamole, been sprouts and macadamia nuts.  It was very delicious.

We had a chance to share the Maui Chicken (Chicken breast, grilled in a great tasting sauce, brown rice and roasted vegetables).  I loved it!

We also had a 12oz Ribeye Steak ordered medium well  that came with mashed potatoes and roasted green beans.  The mashed potatoes were bland and dry.  We traded that in for an extra helping amazing of green beans.

Clam Chowder was a side dish that seemed like a bit much with the portions of food from our main entree.  Nevertheless, the small serving was rich and creamy.

Not sure why it seemed to take some time to get our main entrees, but it did take a while.  The place did not seem so busy at the time.

My total experience here would be a 4/5.

Speed of Food preparation 3/5
Food 4/5
Service 5/5
Cleanliness 5/5"}
{"text":"Decent place if you are on the strip.Service was pretty slow for a Sunday afternoon with not even half of the restaurant full but if you are on the strip I guess time is not that important.

I went with my family and my two kids and was a mistake. I didnt know that Yard House plays rock music while half drunk men hang by the bar.

Food was decent I had a Surf and Turf Burger.Was _ok nothing special but the price was fair so that compensate.My wife had the Shrimp noodles and she loved it."}
{"text":"Beer, can I just say BEER! They have so many on tap it's hard to choose. They have the Four Peaks Peach Ale- which is my favorite beer of all time! The food is great, I have had their mac n cheese and also the sliders. You can't go wrong with Yard House! I also love it is in the Mall- I went shopping right before!"}
{"text":"Good steak and service.  Kind of small on the wine pour,  but other than that good.  Nice location,  if you can find parking. Probably at $$1/2 or $$$,  not a $$."}
{"text":"We went on a Wednesday to look at the car show. Nice location but the wait was a little too long for a beer. We split chicken strips. Just average. Dont have much I can say really."}
{"text":"Huge venue compare to the one at town square and its 2 stories with a great view of the Highroller. Yardhouse has a little bit of everything from pasta, asian food, pub food and even vegans. My girl loves this place for their truffle fries. I like both lobster or chicken garlic noodles. Of course they have a wide variety of brews to suit everyones taste. Not bad for a chain."}
{"text":"Great food,  cold beer and kudo's to YH for carrying Stevia sweetener for the ices tea.   The Organic Tomato Bisque is awesome.   Always great service and tv's everywhere.   Cool place."}
{"text":"My friends and I love going here during their happy hour!!! Super affordable, at times food takes awhile (depends on how hungry you are it seems long as heck) but overall great service. Lettuce Wraps and their chicken nachos are a must to try on their happy hour menu!! So cheap yet so good."}
{"text":"Yardhouse always puts a smile on my face lol. got beer? for all you beer lovers and delicious innovated foods. they take like nachos, tacos, sushi, seafood and put their own twist to it. Never a dull moment unless your waiting for a table because it gets really busy.  U can always grab a drink from bar while waiting. For our latest visit, fiancé and I ordered Korean tacos, truffle fries, babyback ribs and ribeye steak. To drink I had a few of the sin city amber and she had a framboise. Waitress was very friendly and her service was A+. Food was delish but I think portions got smaller from our last visit. No big deal because we were full as hell. Btw check out their happy hour !"}
{"text":"First time here and never coming back. I would give it zero stars but the service made me give it two stars. The servers are nice and attentive but the food is not good at all. We got a guacamole for appetizer which was made with not ripe avocados and it had no salt. Fried calamari has very tough and breading fell apart. I got a seared ahi tuna, the tuna was still frozen in the middle and no flavor at all left more than half of the sandwich. My boyfriend got a ribeye steak which the plate was about $30 and the steak was absolutely horrible. We have bought steaks at target that are way better cut of meat.The steak was mostly fat and grease. My mother In law had some chicken sandwich which also had no flavor, most of the food tastes like it has no salt or pepper. Oh and they don't even have salt nor pepper shakers on the table. We had to ask for some. If you know your food has no flavor please save us from asking for a salt shaker. Don't waste your time coming here or your money."}
{"text":"Happy hour picks are the Seared Ahi Sashimi and the Vampire Tacos.
After you are done, go right across to Paris Gourmet for some macaroons or gelato.

See photos."}
{"text":"Great food, a wide variety of beers on tap and solid service. Plus, its right at the red rock so plenty of other options after you eat!!"}
{"text":"My debut visit here recently while int he Phoenix area visiting family. Huge menu, over 100 world ales on tap. Great service, great aesthetics. Friendly and fast service. And most importantly delicious food, at a moderate price. I enjoyed a dish of fresh shrimp with the Belgian ale 6 shot sampler. I was in Heaven! My pallet was too! Just another fun feature of the very cool West Gate entertainment complex. I highly recommend this place when visiting there."}
{"text":"I will start by saying that the beer selection is quite awesome and it is a great place to go for Happy Hour, and they have some pretty good food and drink deals during that time.  The service is also very good.  The ambiance is great for this kind of place as well.  However, the food was not the best.  I had the blue crab cakes, which I like my crab cakes pan-seared, but these were fried.  The three sauces they served with them were all disgusting.  Would not order these again.  I had the Angel Hair pasta with shrimp and vodka sauce.  It was ok.  The shrimp were perfect and the angel hair was good.  The sauce had WAY TOO MANY shallots and spices in it.  Shallots should be used in small doses.  My Dad had the sliders, which looked good and he enjoyed, but said they weren't really anything special.  Overall, I'd probably go back for the Happy Hour or just to have beer, however, I can't see myself eating a meal there again."}
{"text":"Ever since they changed the menu about 3-4 years ago and got rid of several of the house favorites it's been hard for me to go back. Each time I do, I'm sadly reminded of the new menu that isn't as good as the past, food quality seems to have gone down slightly and now just seems more like the chain it is, as compared to in the past it seemed like a standalone with the quality...sad to see the fall"}
{"text":"Awesome brew selection including delicious raspberry \"girl beer\" float. Yum! I had to make my own at home. Went for a girl's birthday. There was about 20 of us and they were a little confused by our reservation but waiting 15-20 minutes wasn't the worst especially when there was already a big crowd on a Friday. All of us had room, ordered, and only 1 order mix up (he enjoyed the alternative food just as much so it wasn't a deal breaker). Split the mac and cheese and grilled romaine salad. The mac was good as was the salad. It was so simple, it inspired some delicious pan friend versions at home. Came back to meet up with family for fish and chips at a low key time. No complaints!"}
{"text":"Me and a couple of my girlfriends decided to check this place out after watching a movie at the Rave theaters...
We decided to share some appetizers and since this is a brew house we decided to check out some of the brews....
I can't say I was a huge fan of the food... maybe it was what we ordered but nothing blew me away... it was ok.
What I really enjoyed was the selection of beers.... as I have said in a previous review I am not a big beer fan, but I decided to check out a couple.... when in Rome type of moment!   I have to say some of the beers were quite tasty! 
So to sum up I think this place is a bit over priced for the food .... I have found better quality and better price at other establishments, but for the beer selection it is a place to check out."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this gem when looking for something to eat that did not consist of buffet or casino restaurant. Being from Cincinnati I have only drank beer here. This time we had dinner and it was fab!  The burgers are amazing. I had the steak sandwich, she had the burger. Hers was much better but still both very good!  Edit staff is superb and the beer selections are truly amazing. You can taste test what you like so save the pallet. We are going to back here again tonight because it was that good and does not carry the price tag of the casino restaurants."}
{"text":"I love Yard House. There atmosphere, the snooty bartenders, the great food and delicious drinks.. What's not to love. 

They have a BUNCH of Vegetarian options here! It's amazing. Veggie \"Beef\" Sliders.. \"Chicken\" Rice Bowl.. Spicy \"Chicken\" Sandwich.. (that's what I got.. Mostly because I've always wanted to say \"Can I get the spicy chicken sandwich please?\" I've never been able to say that before!). Its the Gardein substitute for meat, a gluten-free, soy-based protein that is supposed to duplicate the flavor/taste/texture of meat. I thought it was delish. Moist and Very filling. The aioli was great too. Don't be afraid of the cabbage (I was, I hate cabbage). It's a thin layer, quite sparse and the other flavors conceal the cabbage anyway. I'm not sure if this is a NV thing or a new feature at the chain, bc the last one I went to in So Cal didn't have that many veggie options (they had the regular amount, just not a half of a page in the menu dedicated to soy protein (fake meat) dishes!!

I'd love to give them 5 stars, I really wanted to. The staff was friendly, they called when the order was ready (I picked up), they even had the water I requested all ready to go... But the sweet potato fries weren't cooked all the way through. Not all of them, at least. As a giant fan of sweet potato fries, that is disappointing. It means enough to knock off a star even though YH knocked my socks off with the veggie menu. So stoked about that!"}
{"text":"I had some of the best service I've ever had at this Yard House location! I've been to other Yard House locations and wasn't expecting to receive the great service that we did. 
The husband and I stopped here after a day of hiking at Red Rock Canyon. We were super hungry and Yard House was the first thing we saw so we stopped. The parking lot was pretty full, but we found a spot towards the back. 
We were seated immediately (it was like 3:30 pm) and our server Nicole cheerfully greeted us and proceeded to take great care of us. Our beers were always delivered cold and promptly. She always made sure our water glasses were full. We both had the tacos (chicken tinga and fish) with rice and beans. Delicious food (I think the fish were my favorite)!!!!! Nicole even gave us plastic cups to take our beer into the casino when we were done. Next time I'm in town, I'll definitely stop here again."}
{"text":"One of my favorite gastropubs, anywhere. They must have close to 100 craft beers on tab. Flavors to satisfy all tastes.
However, in addition to the beer, they have great food. I think their chicken tortilla soup is the best in the valley. Their menu offers real food selections not just wings and burgers. Seafood, steaks, pizzas, even Nashville Hot Chicken!
They have strategically placed large flat screens to watch your favorite team.
Casual atmosphere, friendly service.
Try it."}
{"text":"Yard House is a great place in town square to start your night. I stopped by with my cousin and we had a great time. Our bartender was very nice, We ordered from Happy hour menu. Sliders with fries, Chicken wings and Poke nachos. Believe or not we finished all while we were sipping our beers. I recommend Poke nachos or ahi poke stack, both are very good if you like fish. I like the the environment, sometimes it gets loud but it's bearable. You can watch sports and enjoy your drink,Beside they have variety of beers.It's definitely one of my favorite places anytime I check out town square."}
{"text":"Sad that yard house is going cheap on Theo signature dish the spicy tuba roll substituting cucumber for edamame. I have come here for years with my hubby for date night to stay out with this and some beer but I'd thus is what I'm gonna pay for not coming back"}
{"text":"This is place and I will have to say I had a great client dinner there.  It is the perfect place to grab a beer and have a bite on a Friday after a long week at work.  I feel like they have close to 100 beers on tap.  how can you ever go wrong with that?

Not a coctail dress kind of place, but certainly works well with jeans and a t-shirt.  Located in the town square area there is plenty to do around the place.  Vegas is known for stranding places to eat in the middle of nothing if they are not attached to a casino.  Town Square s just the opposite.  Plenty of shopping and a movie theater in an open are plaza atmosphere.  Good for a first dat or to grab some brews with friends, go her if you can!"}
{"text":"Possibly the best place to get some food and a good beer in this city that for some reason doesn't like to embrace good beer. Compared with the restaurants in the casinos where at best there is one or two craft options, there are several dozen here. The tap list reads like a novel. There are some excellent finds here with styles to suit any taste. The food is pretty good as well. The Nashville hot chicken sandwich was delicious with a perfect balance of spice, tanginess, and sweetness. Service was very friendly and quick as well. It's a great place to come and enjoy a bunch of good beer and some snacks at the awesome and huge bar while watching a game."}
{"text":"Fantastic Happy Hour 3-6pm! Half price appetizers and good drink prices. I like their Sushi and Garlic Noodles.

And pretty much everything I've had there is good. I had a Peppercorn Steak about 2 weeks ago and it was amazing. It's right next to the movies so it's a good place to meetup too."}
{"text":"Although I'm not a big beer aficionado, I've always liked Yard House.  They have an expansive menu (including beer menu, of course), and generally friendly service.  Our experience last night was a good one.  We ordered firecracker wings, hummus, and spinach dip.  Everything was tasty, and the service was very good.  The highlight of the night?  Beer floats!  Yup, who knew beer + ice cream = awesome.  Yard House offers a double chocolate stout with vanilla ice cream and a raspberry framboise with vanilla ice cream.  I tried both.  The chocolate stout really has a strong cocoa note and nice depth.  Really yummy stuff.  I have a serious sweet tooth, so I loved the framboise with the vanilla ice cream.  That beer is delicious and redolent of raspberry fruitiness.  If you haven't had a beer float before, I'd encourage you to try this for dessert!"}
{"text":"The Poke nachos are out of this world! I  could have easily inhaled two orders on my own, had I been left to my own devices. I shared an order with my husband, along with an order of fish and chips. The food is great, and there are  enough beer options here to  satisfy the most discerning customers. Service was stellar! We shall return!"}
{"text":"My buddies were visiting from Colorado and wanted some where cool to eat especially because I know they love beer so I took them here. Restaurant was packed so we went to the bar. We had our beers poured. I had the ACE PINEAPPLE cider. Really crisp and refreshing.
My buddies ordered two burgers and I got the Mac and cheese. Biggest regret right there. My gut told me burger but I was craving something different. The description said chicken and bacon in it. Well if you count three tiny cut up pieces of bacon as an addition to a dish....
There was more bacon on my deviled eggs than my whole Mac and cheese bowl.....
The noodles were crunchy and undercooked. The Mac and cheese sauce was dry and wasn't creamy. Kinda just molded to the undercooked pasta. 

I did the universal sign of pushing my plate forward to hint to the bartender that it wasn't good. Well see that's the problem. With so many bartenders on we didn't know who was serving us. I swear we had 5 different people taking care of us....yet no one noticed a full plate of food pushed forward. Did not appreciate not knowing who was taking care of us. 

The only way we got a managers attention (assume the managers wear white) was that my buddy literally screamed HELP! to gain some attention. That's sad. She came over and asked what was wrong and I told her and she offered me something else. Honestly with ticket times and the fact my two buddies were done eating I just wanted to leave. I feel stupid bringing them here especially because they were here for only one night :(

The check said Beatriz on it but again really didn't know who was helping me. I prob will never come back to this location. It is not a good representation of the brand.

On a positive note I was pleased with how whoever took my order was very serious about my tomato allergy. That was nice. Also the deviled eggs were good. Nothing special just a good tasting pre snack. The host was very sweet and polite on my way in."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour dinner. Waiter (Devon) was attentive and friendly and even got my wife who was celebrating her birthday a birthday desert on the  house. Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I have been to both Town Square and Linq locations. Both are equally good and have indoor & outdoor eating options. Their drink menu is extensive and very fun for beer lovers. I always offer this as an option to visiting friends and family because there is something on the menu for everyon, the quality is very good, and the prices are fair."}
{"text":"Yardhouse is just a good ol' standard place.

I like just about everything on the menu, there's a lot of good beer on draft, and it's in Red Rock... my favorite casino!

I really don't even know where to start for a review here. I've had most of the menu, the only thing I really won't eat again is the turkey burger - it just seemed so weird to me - but the jambalaya is awesome, the regular burgers are standard, the apps are good...

Servers are friendly and efficient, beer is cold, food is fresh. Excellent for happy hour or a first date, as long as you don't have to wait too long. Cheap to moderately priced, social, good atmosphere, top pick."}
{"text":"Hundreds of beers on tap... an extensive menu... what else can you ask for?

I started at the bar with a Stone IPA, was delicious. Made my way to the table, grabbed another stone, ordered the turkey burger. Was cooked with garlic aioli, mozzarella cheese, served with fries and a pickle. Beautiful, cheap, tasty.

Hit the bar at the end of the meal for a kona fire rock beer. Great night, great place to go for casual drinks/food with friends. Definitely had a more local feel than a lot of other places in Vegas.

A+, will dine here again :)"}
{"text":"One of the better chain restaurants but a chain restaurant all the same.  The food is consistantly goodbut is somewhat over priced.  The turkey burger was really juicy and free-range which I really liked.  The atmosphere is nice on a warm day sitting outside and if you have to eat at westgate the yard house or Kabuki are the ways to go."}
{"text":"I won't lie. I had the lowest expectations of Yard House after having been to so many lackluster ones. Luckily for Vegas, this one is a winner, winner. Now all I'm missing is a chicken dinner.

But there's a lot more to be had. Like all Yard House menus, the variety spans from Americana to Asian in one giant menu. It's like Cheesecake Factory, but pricier and vastly higher quality. If there is a place to enjoy a killer selection of beer, while ordering everything from Hawaiian Poke to Korean Kalbi to Shrimp Ceviche, let it be here.

As a venue, this Yard House is stacked. A robust wait staff, plenty of seating all around, with TVs lining the ceilings and corners and game audio for a crowded Monday Night Football viewing. Who ever said this side of Vegas (Town Square) was boring? Certainly not I.

My hungry and tired of group of frenzy eaters ordered a plethora of random stuff, just as their menu intended:

Chicken Lettuce Wraps ($12)
Kung Pao Calamari ($11)
Seared Ahi Sashimi ($14)
Boneless Wings ($13)
Hawaiian Poke Stack ($14)
Turkey Club ($11)
Spicy Tuna Roll ($13)

All in all, everything was decent. The chicken lettuce wraps were fresh, tasty, and abundant. Wasn't the biggest fan of the kung pao calamari, but folks looking for a different take on fried squid ought to try it once. While the turkey club, boneless wings, and spicy tuna roll (which looked like mofongo!) were somewhere in the middle, the seared ahi and poke stack were the surprising winners of the night. Extra surprising that it tasted like fresh fish all while in the middle of the desert? Most definitely.

While I'm not one to frequent chains, I can see myself coming back to this Yard House with beer loving, sports seeking, hungry, good company. Lastly, it's a solid spot that is  within 2 minutes away from McCarran International Airport."}
{"text":"Every time I go here, I leave feeling so satisfied with the food, drinks, service and atmosphere. I experiment each time I go trying something new from their vast menu, not once have I been disappointed. YUMMO!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to the Yard House often in the past. We have not been here for a while, but we were looking forward to visiting this restaurant this evening and getting our menu favorite - fish and chips. Such a disappointment! The dish ought to be re-named - hide and seek fish and chips. There was barely any fish and mostly batter on our plates tonight. The fries were just okay. The tartar sauce had so much jalapeño in it that it was inedible. I think my husband and I will be looking for a new favorite restaurant. After tonight, the Yard House is no longer one of ours."}
{"text":"Having built up an appetite from losing in the casino, I decided to try out the Yard House which is inside the Red Rock Casino.  

I ordered the Fish and Chips, and a Bloody Mary. Nothing special about either.  

There was a decent size crowd for lunch.  If you are trying to have a conversation with someone, you can forget about it.  Between the music blaring and the noise of the crowd, it was hard for me to hear what my friend was saying.

Decent food, but nothing special."}
{"text":"Did not know they had fresh jalapeño. Fantastic. Added them to grilled pastrami. Pair with stone ruination."}
{"text":"I wish we had one of these where we live in Florida!! We came here twice in the last 3 days, food is delicious (highly recommend the lettuce wraps and the crap/lobster dip). And being able to sample & drink such a wide variety of beers is fabulous! If we had a yard house where we live we would be there all the time, this is a must visit for us when we are on the west coast"}
{"text":"I have recently gone vegetarian and I find some sort of irony that this new diet is what has brought me to Yardhouse in Vegas for the first time. I have been to Yardhouse before in a few other cities, but had a friend tell me last week about their vegetarian menu.

They use a meat substitute called gardein and it can be used in any of their dishes but they even have a section of the menu devoted to all of their vegetarian dishes. I decided to choose the chicken & veggie bowl with jasmine rice.. I expected it to be like a teriyaki sauce, but I have to admit that was my own assumption... In spite of not being sweet like I expected, it was a very delicious meal that I thoroughly enjoyed. My friend ordered the veggie chicken strips with a side of sweet potato fries. Of course I had to try this and I have to admit I would have loved to have ordered those too...

I think this is going to be another one of my new spots to frequent as it can totally fit into my diet and keep others around me happy too...

yay!!!

PS: Can someone tell me why this isn't classified under vegetarian?? I would have found it a lot sooner..."}
{"text":"All I have to say one of the best restaurants I have been to . Over 150 beers on tap happy we found this great restaurants food was great too .there was a lot  to choose on the menu"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!  It is a great place to come and have a beer or two as a break from shopping.  The atmosphere is always good, there are sports on all around you and there are more than 100 beers on tap!  

If you are a fan of beer you will be a fan of this place, and if you aren't already a fan, there is something on the menu that can convert you.  

Definitely go in during happy hour to get more bang for your buck with $1 off drafts and half price appetizers."}
{"text":"As sports bars and burger places go, this one is a winner.

First of all, my server, Ashley was great.  As someone who dines alone on business travel a lot, it's nice when a server makes you feel comfortable dining alone and is engaging and pleasant.  She really set the tone for a pleasant and relaxing meal after a long day of travel.

I am a big fan of jasmine green tea and so the blackberry jasmine green iced tea caught my eye.  Ashley assured me it wasn't overly sweet and she was right.  It was outstanding and definitely a reason to return in the future.

The sweet potato fries and burger were perfectly cooked, well seasoned, flavorful and just the right temperature.  My food came out quickly.

I look forward to dining here again when I return to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Servers pleasant and helpful--ask for Cali..  Huge menu.  Food served hot/cold as ordered.  They use runners and expediters so if your waitress is busy, there are others to pick up the slack.  We had rib eye (perfectly done0, French dip (OK), mac/chicken (delicious), burger (ordered well done but still was juicy!).   Definitely would go again.."}
{"text":"What can I say about the only place I have found in town that has my favorite beer on tap?

Yardhouse is a beer aficionado's dream come true. With over 100+ beers on tap I am sure you will find something that ya like. 

I strongly recommend coming in during happy hour. Weekdays from 3-7 and 10-close (except for Fridays) means almost all of their appetizers are half off, on top of that, they have $7 sliders, and cheap pizzas as well. The classic rock and continuously flowing drinks make this place a perfect place to hang out and chill if you want to go out with friends.

The food here is usually a step above the bar food found at similar establishments. Yes they do have nachos, pizza, but they have more adventurous fare such as hummus and pita, double stacked chicken enchiladas, tuna tar tar, and so on. I will give them props for food that you wouldn't think they would. But the thing that makes this place amazing, like a few other fellow yelpers mentioned is the... TURKEY BURGER! I don't know what they do to they turkey, but they make it delicious. Succulent turkey paired with herbs, cheeses and thin slithers of roma tomatoes make this one of the best turkey burgers I have had. Definitely give it a try.

Of course one of the coolest things about all Yardhouses is what I call the keg exhibition. Ever Yardhouse has a large room where they store the 100+ kegs in cold ice-cold fridge. Large windows allow pass-er-bys to gawk at the beauties. 

The location in Town Square is similar to the other ones around the country. A standard restaurant space consisting of booths and tables. A large central bar in the middle, and a ton of pipes which make the draft beers possible."}
{"text":"I literally had the best waitress today at yard house. She was sweet, nice & very attentive. I wish I remembered her name because she deserves acknowledgment. I'm used to horrible servers with bad attitudes so she was like a breath of fresh air. I'll definitely come back just for the great service."}
{"text":"I've been to their location in Long Beach before & enjoyed it.  This is a nice addition to the area solely because of the outdoor seating. This time of year, I base my dining options on outdoor seating availability.  I'll sit outside when it's 105.  I love fresh air!

Anyway, a few of us stopped in for a drink & a snack one night.  The service was blah, she mixed up our beers (dark & light) & the food blah as well.  Calamari boring.  Spinach Dip, too much pre chopped, undercooked garlic flavor.  Blah.  

Having enjoyed it in CA we thought to give it another try.  This time we took the in-laws in town from the UK.  They were in need of a good pint or two.  Our experience was a lot better this time.  Our server was still a little blah, as if she wasn't comfortable interacting with her tables.  She was fairly competent at least.  The food was good for it being a chain.  In fact it's probably the best chain food out there, but truthfully I just go for the beer.  

I'll go back to drink & eat..."}
{"text":"The Yard House is always a great spot to visit while in the Westgate Plaza. I am a big fan of the business and what they have to offer for service. I mean come on... How many place have you been to where they have more than 100 different beers on tap?!?! This place have amazing beers, that's a given! HAHA The food here is very very good. I can never get enough of this place. 

The atmosphere is very up scale and trendy. The bar area has plenty of televisions if your looking to catch the game for a drink with some friends. The dinning area is dimmed in lighting with plenty of room for small or large groups, offering table or large booth seating. 

Last time I came here is got the Four Peaks Kilt Lifter off the tap, and ordered some boneless wings off the appetizer menu. The wings were awesome! Great flavor with a moist textured chicken meat. 

The bartender asked if I would like to sample some other beers on tap that I haven't tried. I asked him what is the most common one that other using want to sample.He mentioned that the raspberry framboise was the most common. It's higher then any other beer in alcohol content with a fruiting taste, served in a goblet glass. I did try it and it was very good. I will probably order it next time I stop in!

I have always had great experiences while eating or drinking at the Yard House. 

FYI: You cannot get a yard of beer! I tried! HAHA"}
{"text":"My family and I LOVE the Yard House. We often come here for happy hour and eat off their appetizer menu! They have lots of great options that the whole family will love and their patio is beautiful! The staff is always friendly and keeps the glasses full! 
Inside the restaurant can get a little loud and is slightly dark, hence why we try to sit on the patio until it gets far too hot. Highly recommend for good food that isn't far too expensive. Large meals at a good price!"}
{"text":"Best place to eat in Vegas so far. Fast, friendly wait staff, great selection of beers and drinks. Every time we've eaten here the food has been awesome, whether it was sliders, monk fish, soup, or tacos. Love it."}
{"text":"Great beer, great food, excellent service.  What more could you ask for?  We started off with the seared ahi sashimi.  It was fresh, beautiful presentation, and tasted great.  I had the parmesan crusted chicken with mashed potatoes.  The serving size was good, presentation excellent, and the chicken was tasty and not at all soggy.  A definite hit.The large number of beer choices is the best part.  I had a rye IPA and loved it.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Another sport bar as thousands around USA

PROS: friendly staff, price, 

Cons: none

I recommend as a started spinach with cheese to dip your nachos and the stake sandwich."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch here on the way to the fabulous Red Rocks Canyon park. It is located in the Red Rocks Station House Casino in Sumerlin, Nv. There are other Yard House eateries in Vegas as well.
Food is pretty good.... menu includes pizzas, burgers, sandwiches, etc. My roast beef dip was okay, cup of clam chowder pretty good. Hubs' burger was better. Nothing too special on the menu, but a large selection.
Awesome choice of beers on tap, we each had a great pint.
Rosie was our server, and she was outstanding.  Service was really great, I would come back for the exceptional service and great selection of craft beers."}
{"text":"Great food and good service. Atmosphere is ok. A bit pricey. Mainly it gets four instead of three stars because of the vegetarian selection."}
{"text":"I am delighted to be the official Duke of the Yardhouse.  As a boy, I was raised in the happy hour menu.  As a man, I continue to feast upon it!  So, speaking from over 20+ years of Yardhouse-experience, let me share how to maximize your experience at this location:

A.) The location is prime.  It's right in the middle of Westgate and is great for people-watching, and it serves as a perfect pre-football or hockey game location.

B.) Happy hour= awesome!  http://www.yardhouse.com/AZ/glendale-restaurant/happy-hour/
Highlights include the Chicken Nachos (enough to feed two people until you almost puke); Pizzas (hot and yummy); Fried Calamari (some of the best I've had this side of the Mediterranean): Ahi Roll (better than Filet Mignon IMO); Spinach Cheese Dip; The Sliders- especially pastrami (enough to stuff you to the brim); and well, pretty much everything else!  Oh yeah, the drinks are great and are reasonable.  If you like IPA like me, the Green Flash West Coast IPA will melt in your mouth.  They have over 100 beers on tap, so you are bound to find something that you like!

C.) The service.  It's really good overall and you will be taken care of very well.

D.) The food.  It's all very good and filling.  

If all that doesn't convince you, that's okay- I'm happy to have the place to myself!  After all, I am the Duke!  ;)"}
{"text":"so off the bat very cool atmosphere and good rock music. servers and staff where attentive and did a goid job on there timely route. the food we ordered was first the queso dip. this appatizer was astounding. different then the queso at applebees as it was much thicker but tasty and good. this places it second to apple bees. the pear and gorgonzola flat bread did not come all the way cut and i had to tear it almost. the flat bread was pretty tasty but i wanted more cheese and pear a bit just a bit. but then there was my pepper encrusted gorgonzola burger. it was just ok the flavor was there but not enought the cheese was almost non exsistant. the mushroom and other veggies were cooked awesomely. the burger just fell a bit flat. could not find really anythin to peak my interest much but the service outstanding the food just ok but not for the price if you want desert get what me and the wife got. A kona ice cream sundae."}
{"text":"I've been here several times ...The food and service is usually always great here.  This time I decided to come on a Saturday afternoon and the wait time was pretty quick.  

The waitress was friendly and quick.  If you haven't tired the jambalaya or garlic noodle, try it b/c they are both pretty good.  Overall, I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"The wonderful world of Disney...
That is kind of how I felt while we walked to the Yard House from our parking space.  This area just felt so artificial to me...Were we in Disney World?  Were we in Las Vegas?  Ooh wait...its Glendale...

There was a 10-15 minute wait so we headed to the bar!  120 beers on tap!  HUGE!  My favorite bar in Ann Arbor Michigan-Ashley's-only has 70 beers on tap so I was very very excited to read about all 120.  Sadly the menu gave very little description of the brews and although the bartenders may have had answers it was difficult enough to get their attention let alone ask about the beers.  Thankfully the Pistons were playing on all bazillion of their flat screens so I wasn't too upset.  I went with a raspberry cider (I'm normally not THAT girly) and my man went with a Boddingtons.  After the first sip the buzzer went off and we were seated.

Our server was adorable and knew a whole lot about the menu.  I went with a BBQ chicken salad (shocker) that was divine yet I am sure was no where near as healthy as I would like liked.  Brian went with the french onion soup and a Bearnaise burger which he enjoyed. 

Food-4 stars
Beer- 4 stars
Bar service-3 stars
Table service-5 stars
Entertainment-5 stars...GO PISTONS!

Will I be back?
Ehh...seems like quite a few other spots to check out in that area before returning but it's a great sports bar type scene."}
{"text":"Went to Yard House 7 July 2012 for a bite.  I ordered the Hawaiian  First I must say the service was great...There was nothing wrong with the service. Totally available, even ahead of what you needed.  The food was the problem.  The Hawaiian was ok I have tasted a lot of better burgers even Carl's Jr's Hawaiian is better.  It really didn't seem like a \"Real burger\"  I only ate only 1/2 my burger.  when I reheated my left overs at home.  I notice one thing I hope nobody goes through.  the hamburger had some type of filler in it. (when you heat up a burger it stays together not fall apart into pieces)  This burger feel completely apart it was very odd. When eating a hamburger I expect there to be more meat than filler and for it to stay together not fall apart.   This was my first time visiting the Yard House.  I may try it again but I will NOT order any hamburgers if this is how they make them.

********I have to change the rating from a 2 to a 4 because a Yard House got a hold of me and was interested in my story.  I was going back to work,   things were crazy to say the least and then I moved out of state.   They listened to my concerns and wanted to make a change my impression about them and they did a great job."}
{"text":"The food was great and the server is wonderful and funny. It was a lil loud but overall experience is great."}
{"text":"Yeah, I forget what I ordered here.  I want to say...it was some pretty good chicken breast and mashed potatoes.  Something tells me my husband would have loved this place.  TVs everywhere, helpful staff...Really really good Diet Coke!

All I remember was the sheer embarrassment of being the only person wearing a sparkly gold dress and a friggin bridal veil, only in Vegas...except we're not on the Strip, so now I'm totally self-conscious about a restaurant full of people staring at me...though not embarrassed of rolling deep with 14 hot girlfriends wearing tight black clothing.  Taxi service is slow at this venue, especially on a Saturday.  Doesn't really matter because you're in Vegas and after you're done, the rest of it just kind of fades to black, don't judge me...you know what I'm talking about."}
{"text":"We went here as a party of six. We did not wait long for a table and the service was good. The atmosphere is what you would expect at any one of the Yard Houses you visit. 

They have a large selection of beers to choose from and the night we went they also were doing craft cocktails. My friend ordered a whiskey sour which was delicious. 

As far as the food goes, well it's a Yard House. The food is good, but basic. We mostly did appetizers. I think the cheese curds were very good. We also had the moo shu egg rolls. They were ok. The firecracker wings were also pretty good, but nothing spectacular. We had the vampire tacos which others in my party thought were amazing, but I was not impressed. I didn't finish mine. 

I'm not saying it was bad...and if I was at home in California it might be somewhere I would eat lunch or go watch the game. In Vegas though you have tons of choices.... a little too average for me. If you are looking for an affordable meal in Vegas though, this place is reasonably priced and it's not bad."}
{"text":"we spent $70 on the yardhouse outside bar a couple minutes before we decided we wanted to eat here. before we were seated, bo the on shift manager told us we could not bring our drinks we bought from them inside. my girlfriend told me \"this is bullsh**t.\" bo told us \"were not going to serve you\" even though she wasnt even talking to him. matt was the outside bartender who confirmed our drinks. needless to say we were not happy after waiting 20 minutes to be seated in the first place. the staff was truly understanding, bo on the other hand was completely rude from the moment we spoke to him. terrible treatment"}
{"text":"Felt like we were being rushed, the waiter gave the impression he wanted to hurry us through the meal and turn the table.  This was odd since there were plenty of seats available.  Ordered appetizers and the server didn't bring any small plates, asked us if we wanted them.   Brought our meals out and set them down without clearing the small plates.   Beer was flat, which is no surprise since they have so many.  I'm sure they sit in kegs for a long time.  Had a Cobb salad, which was the poorest excuse for a Cobb salad I've ever had.  Dining partners had fish tacos which they said were ok.  Won't go back."}
{"text":"Gardein/Vegi menu is great. Tastes like the real thing. Awesome for my wife and daughter."}
{"text":"Over priced for what you get. I guess you pay for the atmosphere. I do not eat meat and have tried a couple of the gardein items, none of which were all that good. Workers are very pleasant but I had to keep asking for refills on my drink. Because of this I probabaly won't continue to go here when I can go across the street to BJs and have a better experience."}
{"text":"Dinner was fabulous! We had some different beers and ciders, yummy steaks, and dessert. Our servers Ashley and Mecca were so much fun. Will be back for sure! Made date night memorable."}
{"text":"We stopped in here after a show to grab dinner.  The place is enormous and very noisy.  There were lots of inebriated people around too which didn't help the overall noise pollution up in this place.

It's a typical Yard House chain as far as food and drinks.  Think slightly upscale sports bar and that's what you get.  We had the fried cheese curds and they were OK.  My man and I wanted to split a salad and the salmon dish, but it was so loud the waitress thought we said salmon salad, so that was a bit disappointing.  She did however apologize and offer to make us the dish; but it was getting late and I was hangry - so we just ate what we had.  No one else was blown away by their food either.  Don't get me wrong, it was OK, but felt like I could get it anywhere in town.  It's just a bar with a bit better than bar food.  The service overall was really good however and this is the reason I'll give it 3 stars instead of 2.

Would I go back if I was in town? Probably not, since I know of much better spots to go"}
{"text":"Okay so I've been here before and their service is always great, but today was horrible.

Service:  Today wasn't a busy day.  The hostess were quick to seat us.  The server was friendly, but it took her almost 30 mins to come and take our order.  We all only ordered appetizers, and it took as long as it did for someone to take our order to get our food.  Not only that, they forgot about one of our appetizers.  When we told the server about that, she put in the order and we got it quick.  The server only checked up on us once to fill my cup with water, after she never came to see if we were okay.  

Food: The food here is alway great, especially when they have happy hour. I had the Seared Ahi Tuna and a Korean Pork Taco, both were delicious. 

I would recommend coming here because the food is great, but their service could use some work."}
{"text":"We have had good experiences at this location and after yet another great meal tonight, a long overdue review was in order.
We came in on a whim with a gift card and were pleased to see that it was happy hour. The three of us shared the fried mac n cheese, deep fried cheese curds, and BBQ chicken pizza. I also had the California roll and my BIL had the ahi sashimi. The California roll is actually more of a \"stack\" or layered sushi as opposed to a traditional roll. It's my favorite dish and always a good choice. I really enjoyed the fried man & cheese as well. The marinara sauce was good but the other one seemed to be some sort of mushroom sauce-pass on that one. My BIL and husband each had (and devoured) the creme brûlée while I opted for the apple peach cobbler. My dessert was delicious. Our server was initially Anna who got us drinks and then turned us over to Chad at shift change. They were both awesome-Chad checked on us a ton and never let our drinks get low. Overall it was another awesome meal at Yard House-and we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"You really cannot go wrong with Yard House.  It's a chain but consistent from location to location.  They offer an extensive beer list and the service is usually pretty solid.  I have been here more than 5 times and each time has been good in terms of service and quality.  They usually have seasonal or local selections on tap as far as beer, in addition to their big menu, and their Happy Hour is quite good ($2 off draft and cheap food specials).  And on mondays during football season it is Happy Hour all day.

The food is nothing spectacular but I believe it is better than the average pub.  And with the selection of beer, it's tough not to enjoy yourself.  It is great for watching sports and i recommend this place if you just want to hang out, drink some beer, and watch the game."}
{"text":"Garlic noodles are delicious !!! I love coming here for happy hour :) lots of draft options - fun !!"}
{"text":"Eating at a place like Yard House is not typically my choice. I avoid cookie-cutter commercial eateries because I already know what to expect.... sugar/salt/fat bombs, a tummy ache and the potential for mediocre service.

However, being at crocker park for the wine festival + having a gift card (gathering dust from last Christmas) lead me to the Yard House to soak up my wine samples.

My first impression of Yard House was that the interior was classier and cleaner than what I would have expected from a chain restaurant. They did largely employ 20-somethings, but I was pretty satisfied with our service. We arrived at 5pm on at Saturday and were promptly seated at a massive booth that would likely fit 6 people. Our server took our drink order and drinks were delivered pretty quick. They do offer an extensive draft beer and cider selection, including my favorite, Ace Pineapple Cider. 

The menu is pretty extensive, as you can imagine. My husband and I decided to splurge a bit & order to queso dip appetizer. The cheese dip was served hot in a cast iron skillet with flour tortillas and tortilla chips. It was.... just okay. Not particularly spicy, although it did have some fire roasted pobalo peppers mixed in. There was the option to add bacon and chorizo, but we passed.

For our entrees my husband ordered Nashville Hot Chicken and I ordered the lunch portion Vodka Shrimp Pasta. Without checking the nutrition facts online I can assume that these meals were likely 1000+ calories, but they seriously lacked flavor. They were pretty enough to look at but overall pretty meh in the taste department. My husbands' pancakes did not slightly taste or  resemble sweet potatoes and his chicken was lacking both the salt and spice you would expect. My pasta also tasted bland and under-salted... which was particularly confusing because I can only imagine the sodium content based on the reputation of chain restaurants.

Overall, I may return to Yard House in the future if the stars aligned (as they did during this visit). The facility was clean, we were seated quickly and service was attentive enough. However, the food really wasn't that great nor did it live up to it's description. It wasn't worth the heavy feeling I left with nor the belly ache that ensued later."}
{"text":"You can never ever go wrong with yardhouse.  Their food menu is very extensive, and their beer menu ever BIGGER. Clearly, everything I've ever had at yardhouse has never disappointed me.  Their happy hour menu is amazing as well!  This is the go to spot for the best happy hour in town I must say!

Im in love with their turkey sliders, korean BBQ tacos and of course, their Poke stack! Drinks wise, I always get their black velvet (Pear cider + Guiness) & framboise!  I always like trying new drinks here as well... and again, I've never been disappointed. 

The atmosphere here is very laid back and cool. TV's everywhere...  Restaurant is always so clean and packed.  Customer service is always on point.  They have awesome locations all over vegas.  Their Red Rock, Town Sqaure and Linq locations are absolutely gorgeous!"}
{"text":"The Yard House was AMAZING. I had the mac-n-cheese with wild mushrooms and my husband had the lobster, garlic noodles. Both dishes were worth the money twice over. Best mac-and -cheese i have ever had!  Cold beer and even had Boddingtons on tap!! Stellar experience."}
{"text":"Terrible sandwich, terrible BBQ chicken pizza, and terrible desert. Table next to us was complaining about food and had to get food returned kitchen. Wouldn't recommend!!!! Only go for beer. NOT food!"}
{"text":"Your typical chain restaurant/tavern.  Although they have a wide selection of beer, they don't tell you that the 4 beer sampler is priced individually.  The food was good but I just expected the service to be better.  We are used to the Mizner Park, Florida location which has better service.  We literally had to wait to find our server to pay our bill!  You would think that with a line waiting to get in that the server would have been anxious to turn over our table.  We have 6 more days in Vegas and this is definitely the only place so far where we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly, Food not so much.  I ordered a chicken dish that had a strong fish smell.  I never send food back because I do not trust that what would return would not be tainted."}
{"text":"Great place close to home...easy to meet family and friends. Big menu...lots to chose from! The appetizers are awesome. Beer is great and the atmosphere is cool! Staff is always there to check on you! Thanks guys for making it a great neighborhood hangout!"}
{"text":"My first time at the Yard House wasn't really anything special, but I can see why people would like it. The ambiance is cozy for sports enthusiasts and beer connoissers.  They have about 150 different beers on tap which is impressive. I sat at the bar and had one of the beers on tap. After looking thru their extensive beer menu, I ordered the Sin City Light; it was good. It's about $6 for a beer. So for the most part, the bar is what makes the place; along with all the flat screen TVs mounted throughout.

As a restaurant...they need A LOT of work. I ordered the Roast Beef Dip. A simple dish (it's a sandwich for crying out loud), how can anyone get that wrong...Au Jus was too salty. That's what makes the sandwich! Also, they need to melt the provolone in the sandwich. They just slapped on a cold piece of cheese! One of my friends had the Porter House Steak. She had ordered it medium, but she realized as she was cutting into the steak that it was a little on the rare side. Once she pointed that out to our non-attentive waiter, he did take the steak back and correct it. The manager even brought it back out to her and apologized for that and did not charge for her entree. That was nice of him... My cousin had the lettuce wraps. I didn't try them, but he says that the wraps were really good. My brother had the Ahi salad. He liked it. The prices on their food menu are comparable to that of a Chilis or Chevy's.

Now about our waiter...Seems like he was trying to avoid us the whole time we were there. The sad thing is that he was also training someone on the floor that night; what a good example he is setting for the trainee! We had to wave him down a couple of times for drinks and a couple times for condiments. Come to think of it, we didn't even get place settings until after our food arrived. We had to ask another waiter for that! He only came by to check on us once, and that was the same time he slapped us the bill."}
{"text":"WORST EXPERIENCE EVER! 
If you plan on having a large party here, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. 
I had a party of 20 for my birthday, however, it took about 45 minutes for everyone to show up. Some people had ate and that point and others were waiting for the guests to arrive (I even warned the server it would be a about a 3 hour table) by 45 minutes the server brought us our checks and we closed out. Claimed it was their time to leave. 
So I had no issues closing out but the people who ate felt obligated to leave, so I asked for a smaller table. It was set up for us BUT the server failed to tell the manager he would no longer be taking us. 
It took 30-40 minutes for someone to come by and even say hello. We finally grabbed a manager and he took our orders but was NOT very friendly at all. Kind of rushed us. Then had a server come by who had no idea that the manager had even taken any orders. 
Finally I asked for a refill on my drink. It came back now how I had asked but didn't see a server for ten minutes so just decided to drink it. 
Asked for a straw and she told me \"there are no straws\" but we could see straws on the bar. 
It was a nightmare and ruined my birthday. 
Nothing was done for us and the manager didn't once apologize. 
I left in tears and I would go to yardhouse almost every week and will not be returning due to this."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch. Service was extremely quick, our waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu as well. they have a great bloody Mary (it has a lot of Peppery taste to it but I didn't mind it )My fiancé and I shared the chicken nachos which were absolutely delicious and he got a couple tacos and they were probably some of the best tacos we've ever had.We will definitely be back before we leave!"}
{"text":"Beer system has still not been updated. The beer is still warm. Their long draw system either needs more polyethylene glycol or its simply broken and need repair."}
{"text":"Good food and good service. I love the outdoor seating area. Great for people watching at the Linq."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service and right amount of attention, along with a great me h selection and drink choices on and off the tap galore. One of my favs when I ride the wheel. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I ordered the lobster artichoke dip, which was really good. For dinner I had the steak sandwich. Delicious, highly recommended. HOWEVER, they really shouldn't put the tomatoes blow the meat, resting on the bottom bun because it became soggy FAST. Just be sure to make that switch when you order and you have a winning dish!"}
{"text":"I've been here 100s of times and consider it one of my favorite restaurants.  I came here last Saturday after attending a friends wedding.  They have a ton of great beers on tap and a wide variety of foods.  This time I got the chicken nachos which are great and more than enough for two people to share.  I also ordered a moose drool brown ale but the server accidentally brought out some porter.  I was disappointed the server didn't do more (other than apologize) to make the situation right but the porter was actually pretty good so I can't complain too much.

Their BBQ burger is one of the best burgers you will ever have and I highly recommend it as well.  The only thing I've ever had at yard house that I didn't like was the macaroni and cheese which is crazy because I love mac and cheese.  If you are looking for a semi-casual place that has great food and beers, you can't beat yard house.  Just pay attention to prices because you can rack up a huge bill if you aren't careful."}
{"text":"I like coming here for the great service and menu selection, not to mention all the beers they have on tap. This is an upbeat place that can get very loud. Great spot for happy hour and/or  to bring a group. Appetizers are big enough to share as well as some of the entrees. If your looking for a place to have a beer and watch a sporting event on their many tv's - sit at the bar and enjoy."}
{"text":"The chicken lettuce wraps here are amazing. Like the best lettuce wraps I've ever had in my life. The beer selection is really good and it's cool you can see all the kegs from the window. The staff is really bad behind the bar. There have been times where it took me 10 mins before I even got a bartenders attention and that's cause I had to flag him/her down. I enjoy coming here though"}
{"text":"So many choices where do I start. Let's start with quality of service, great. Never a problem. Quality of atmosphere, love it. Most importantly quality of food has always been great. Street tacos, queso, California roll, truffle fries, brussel sprouts, Nashville hot chicken, are some of our favorites. Not to mention the Bloody Mary and Guinness on tap oh my! We have not had anything bad here and will continue to go back."}
{"text":"I have visited Yard House probably 50 times over the past five years.  I only recently started Yelping so my check ins reflect that.

I give the Yard House 3 stars.  Why you ask?  I will get straight to the point.

The bad: More often than not, the service is slow at best.  If you are in a hurry, this is not the place for you.  The food is over priced and the quality is just not good enough to reflect the price.  I have had probably 20 different items on the menu and have never had that \"this is awesome\" experience, except with the vegetarian menu.

The good:  The beer selection is amazing.  I love craft/draft brew and they have it all.  Also if you are a vegetarian/vegan, the selection and quality of that food is excellent.  I usually go on a 2-3 month, strict vegetarian diet every year and it is a great place for that.

I wish I could rate it higher but I can't.  I will go back, simply because I love the beer."}
{"text":"How can you go wrong with some classic rock and an ice cold beer when it's 100 degrees outside? I'm not even a beer drinker and I enjoyed the Yard House.  

I had some time to kill and I thought this would be a good, kick-back place to hangout...and it was.   Since it is all about the beers, I went along and ordered my ballpark standby, Fat Tire in a pint glass.  It was the perfect drink for a warm day.  

The food menu was good too. We settled on chicken nachos and watched some sports.  Then all of a sudden, I started to pay attention to the music, it's all the best classic rock.

How can you not like having an ice cold beer and hearing my favorite song to roller skate to as a kid- Another Bites The Dust by Queen.  Perfect way to start my weekend in Scottsdale, AZ."}
{"text":"This is defiantly a great restaurant, hands down. They make all their food perfect and I haven't had any problems with the service or food. 5/5 this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"I mostly just go here when I want a good beer and don't want to pay $22 for a 6-pack of hand selected beers at Total Wine. Love the beer selection since I am a big time beer fan. Love the Rogue Hazelnut Brown, Sunshine Wheat and Murphy's. 

Food is pretty good too, I love shoestring fries so when I want to splurge i'll order something with the fries or steal some from whoever is with me. I ordered the BBQ Bacon Cheddar Burger last time (medium rare). The meat wasn't cooked medium rare and it kept falling apart while holding it. I don't know if they just forgot to put something in the meat to keep it together but it was annoying trying to eat a burger with meat falling onto the place while you eat it. The BBQ sauce is pretty tasty but it comes on the side and is very runny so you need to pour the sauce onto each bite of the burger unless you're fine with BBQ sauce running out onto your hands and plate. 

I've had other dishes here which have been pretty good but the prices keep me from coming back to eat unless I get a gift card for this place. I just will stick with beer"}
{"text":"Broad variety on the menu and draft beers, so something for everyone and the food and service rarely disappoint."}
{"text":"I love coming here after work to relax and have a few drinks. Mostly because they have a vegetarian menu as well. The staff is awesome and I always get incredible service from the moment I walk in! I usually sit at the bar and last week Cheshire was my bartender. She was sweet and funny and even though she was busy she was still having plenty of conversation with me. Like I said I love this place and the food is amazing!! Save room for dessert."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of BJ's but in Vegas, similar food and beer selection.  TV's at the bar so you can watch a game if one is going on or sports highlights.  The service is ok, it was pretty packed when we went and we needed a table for 10. The hostess offered us a choice of waiting an hour or being seated earlier by splitting are group into 2. Since we were starving and wanted to get out of there quick we opted to be split into 2 groups.  If you're visiting Vegas and staying on the strip going here might be a little costly taxi wise because it is a bit off the strip."}
{"text":"The service was very slow. ...food ok....hire more people for a busy Saturday afternoon"}
{"text":"So let me say that Mitch who was our server was awesome!  My sister is vegan & they have a whole section on their menu of vegetarian options.  He went back to the kitchen to ensure that the product was purely vegan!  Not only that he was very accommodating with her order.  (She got the gardin spicy chicken sandwich).  She said it was tasty & would come back.  I had the Turkey Burger which was one of the best tasting burgers I've had in a long time.  Since I didn't Want fries Mitch patiently ran down my other options until I decided (on mixed veggies which were crisp & not covered in butter & crap).  My mom got the beef sliders & she was very pleased.  We will all come back again since the service was Fab & they are vegan friendly!"}
{"text":"They have a great beer selection but the food in my opinion is just ok there wasn't really anything that stood out I guess you could say it's just mediocre"}
{"text":"This American staple is a venue that has never let me down. I have tried a variety of different entrees and they have all been quite exceptional. If I had to pick one dish, I would definitely go with the jambalaya (hold the chives). The sausage on the jambalaya is perfectly seared. The sausage, not too spicy, not too bland - just right. This place is definitely known for its robust selection of beers, however; I don't think the meals get the credit they deserve. As for as beer goes, I have yet stumped them on any beer I have ordered. This place would be the perfect place to spend an an ideal day beginning with a big lunch and then working your way through beer flights and then calling an Uber upon closing.  Unfortunately, my wife would frown with disgust if I ever proposed such a wild day. Regardless of whether you're in the mood for a great beer or an exquisite entree, look no further than this fine establishment for all your needs. I'm certain they have those fruity girly drinks for the wifey as well."}
{"text":"Received a Darden restaurant gift card and wasn't sure where to use it, because I did not think of those restaurants as too vegetarian-friendly! Was pleased and excited to see all of the veggie choices on the online menu for Yard House, and going here was a good decision.
I went at about 7 on a Tuesday night and it was packed, did not really expect that. There was a bit of a wait to get seated, but it was not bad. One thing that was great about this place was the huge menu. I definitely struggled to decide what dish to order. Love that they have a specific vegetarian section too, and also label if something is vegetarian. That is always helpful. After much deliberation I decided to go for the BBQ Gardein Chicken Pizza. Had never had a pizza like that before, and it was very good, a unique meat-free option! My friend ordered the ribeye steak and he was also very pleased with it and the mashed potatoes it came with. I definitely want to go back and try more things because there was just so much to choose from, and it is delicious.
Service was good too, our server was super nice which is appreciated. A little slow, probably just due to how busy it was. Also Yard House is a little to dark and loud for my liking. Also pricey! But overall, was a good experience and I will be returning."}
{"text":"It's a nice atmosphere. My wife ordered the lobster mac n cheese. If you don't mind paying $25 for fake lobster then this dish is for you honestly we were disappointed. My burger however was real flavorful and perfectly medium as I asked for. Overall is a mediocre place with a lot of drinks."}
{"text":"Damn.., if you love craft beer this is the place to be!
The service and beer recommendations were spot on. 146 beers on tap means there is something for everyone. I can't comment on the food because we did not eat, so this rating is based purely on the craft beer experience."}
{"text":"Great happy hour! They have an extensive drink list (especially impressed with their beer selection) and tasty happy hour apps. Their lunch menu runs until 5 pm too. While my Hawaiian poke stack and blackened swordfish taco were great, my friend was not as impressed with the chicken tenders, vampire taco, and California sushi roll. It's a little hard to find (one of my friends got lost), but if you walk toward the Highroller (sidewalk that runs by Kitson and Sprinkles), you can't miss it."}
{"text":"3.5 stars
-1-
The blue crab cakes were good and tasted fresh. The California Rueben was very falvorful and filling, but a little too oily.  The classic cheese is a good burger and the garlic aioli goes great with it. The Four Peaks Double Pumpkin Porter (seasonal) is good a alternative to the Sam Adams Oktoberfest (they were tapped out of Sam Adams), and it can creep on you since its a little stronger.

-2- 
The pork lumpia was a pretty good app. Nothing overwhelmingly great about the egg rolls but combined with the soy white truffle sauce, it was super good.  The seared ahi steak sandwhich was very good, cooked medium rare and very flavorful. The carnivore (12') pizza was truly meant for a carnivore, very filling. 
The mini choclate souffle cake provided the needed choclate fix."}
{"text":"We stayed at Hampton about 1/2 mile away.  What a find, thanks Yelp!
Sat at bar and was entertained by Ellen, well versed in the menu and the choices (over 125) of the brews.
After a local Great Lakes DORTMUNDER GOLD® LAGER and a Sam Adams Summer Ale we tried some of the fine appetizers.  Ended up with these being dinner!
I'm celebrating a 45th college reunion so Ellen generously offered an Apple Cobbler as a special dessert, on the house!
We decided that warranted an Irish Coffee with Jameson - this place is worth a second/and third visit!
We'll be back."}
{"text":"Minus the extremely annoying server the last time I was there this place is always a hit with me. I had the salmon last time and it was amazing!!!! But literally I've never had a bad thing on the menu and I get something different every time usually and I've been to Yardhouse probably 20 times in the last few years. The beer is obviously a winner, but I ordered one of the specialty whiskey cocktails and it was fiercely yummy. I've had the \"house\" red can't go wrong there either. If you can get to the happy hour it's the best if not the prices aren't unreasonable. Good date spot because the lighting is good not too loud but not too quiet either."}
{"text":"Great selection on Beer.....I have never seen so many varieties in one place.  It is located off the strip in Town Center and parking is easy.  Only thing is that you might have to wait a little on a Friday/Saturday night but why not....  You can then just drink all the different beers.  Oh the food is great as well... No complaints.  Service is great as well."}
{"text":"3 stars for beer selection and that's all.

Impressive beer selection. They pretty much have an entire wall of taps, so there's a lot to chose from. Their beer book is also well organized so you can search by type of beer, and see where each beer is from.

Now the food, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't really good either. Nothing to write home about...so I won't."}
{"text":"We got seated quickly even though it was very busy. Rock N Roll weekend plus Sunday football but we still didn't have to wait for a table. Our waitress got to us quick and my beer came before the wsitress was back with our waters. I usually end up waiting until right before the food comes to get my bar order at other places. They were on it. Our food arrived in about 10 minutes. Brussel sprouts and potatoes snack was so good. The sauce they put on the bottom of the bowl was amazing. I could eat it alone. The Brussel sprouts were crispy on the outside and perfect inside. We also had the garlic noodles with asparagus, muchrooms, and tufu. It was just the right pre race meal. I've been to this place a few times and never tried the snack meals or appetizers. They were big servings and no main dish needed. Our waitress checked on us multiple times and we weren't there very long. They have excellent customer service especially for being on the strip. Or really close to the strip anyways."}
{"text":"Felecia is the rudest person on earth.  If the yard house keeps her on as manager then the yard house doesn't care about its customers. We had a problem with ordering and she said that she has the discretion by her boss to say and do what she wants.  And boy did she not provide any help but was condescending and just not appropriate!  We will never go back there as long as she is working there."}
{"text":"I am a bud light and bud light only fan so you'd think this place would not appeal to me but that would be very wrong.   I bring friends from out of town here all the time.  They love the selection of beer.   I like the deviled eggs and my kids love the deserts.

I'd highly recommend this place for entertaining clients."}
{"text":"This is a beer drinkers paradise on assortment! 
Ordered the Maui Pineapple Chicken. Large portion of chicken! Very good! Highly recommend ."}
{"text":"Drinks are kind of high for Las Vegas but the service here is great..........................................."}
{"text":"I've stayed away from Yard House because its a chain however, there are virtually no other places in the area that have a decent selection of craft beer.  Holy fuckamole does this place have an amazing selection of craft beer.  I've only been a handful of times but the bartenders are awesome and know my face and call me IPA girl."}
{"text":"Go for Happy Hour or when a Canadian or Chicago hockey team is in town. 

Do not expect great service, as they seem to have either high turnover, or are just lacking in hiring those with a sense of urgency and/or awareness. 

The prime reason I make Yard House a priority on happy hour outings are the Lettuce Wraps ($6-ish from 3-6pm). 

Overall it's a middling place in a competitive area for restaurants so I usually do the big meals elsewhere."}
{"text":"Very, noisy in this place so be prepared to yell at your friend next to just so they can hear you. The food is incredible the truffle fries are a must!"}
{"text":"So went there last night (a Thursday) around 6:30. Wasn't very crowded as I was able to find a seat at the bar after just half a lap around. Waiter was attentive and proactively asked me if I wanted a water while I decided on drink and dinner. That was great and I was pretty excited that the evening would include great service, great beer and great food. The beer is where things went very wrong (especially for a place that people go to to drink a large selection of high quality beer). I ordered the house Belgian Tripel...it was out. He said it would be 5-10 minutes and asked if I wanted something else in the meantime. I asked for a Delerium Tremens. It came out with a 1/4 inch head that disappeared to no head in about 5 seconds. There were no bubbles coming up from the bottom of the glass. As I watched my sad little beer wither before I even took one drink, I already knew there was a pretty major CO2 problem because I immediately looked around and noticed that everyone else's beers also had no head - even the ones that had just just been poured like mine. I put it up to my lips and sure enough...probably about 10% carbonated compared to what it should have been. I told the bartender and he called over someone else, that person poured a small glass, tasted it and said...\"nope, it's fine\". I told bartender that it was not fine and I wanted another one. So he poured another and held the glass about two feet below the tap so it would create a bigger head. What...do you think I'm stupid? He gave me the beer and I watched the head disappear in 5 seconds. I told him it was also bad and I did not want it but that I would wait until the Tripel keg was changed. It got changed and he poured me the beer I'd been looking forward to all day...and it was as flat as a pancake too. I was super disappointed in the entire beer experience and didn't know why a bunch of people working in a place famous for beers were so ignorant of the product they were delivering. I travel to Vegas every other week and always stay at the Red Rock and always have at least one meal at The Yard House. Probably won't be my ritual any more."}
{"text":"Always love yard house, and this location is no different. Love to see a few new beers on tap, makes the experience new and exciting. My stay here is that much better after having jambalaya with friends!"}
{"text":"We were staying near the airport before our early morning flight home and did a search within the immediate area for an early dinner and drinks. 

We were intrigued with the very positive reviews and over 100 beers on draft!!!

The location is tucked within the Town Square near the airport and south of the strip. We walked in and were amazed to see all of the kegs behind the windows!  There were several people seated in the lobby area but we inquired about sitting at the bar and she told us we were welcome to sit there as it was open seating and she stated if we had any difficulties finding a seat to come back and let her know. 

We were able to find two chairs at the bar and were immediately greeted with drink and food menus.  We were definitely impressed by the beer and menu options!  We decided to order the queso appetizer, it is served with both chips and flour tortillas.

My wife ordered the two taco entree which came with rice and beans while I ordered the carnivore pizza. The interior is very clean and comfortable and it was fun to sit at the bar and watch the Saints and Vikings game. 

Our food arrived in a timely manner and looked and tasted delicious. We were really impressed with the entire  experience. We wish we had a Yard House in Reno!"}
{"text":"Great service and great atmosphere! It had a LOT of items to choose from on the menu which was a real plus. Our waitress stayed on top of everything and was very nice. I had the wings which were good, the sauce was a lot like Al's Garage but were bigger but the meat was a little tough. Liked the Onion Ring Tower, so good!! Good prices too!"}
{"text":"Spotted this familiar chain across the street from the Cardinal's stadium in the restaurant-filled outdoor Westgate mall.

Cost to worth it rating: 3

Highlights:
- Beers: ~113 on draft, pints, yards, and half yards (2 pints worth) available 
- Lemonade: specialty vodka cocktail with a sprig of mint that was perfectly refreshing and not too sweet
- Sweet potato fries: thin and crispy with a drizzle of syrup
- Spicy chicken sandwich: blackened and on a flatbread roll which was thin yet dense and grilled
- Jerk wings: sauce was a wee bit spicy yet sweet
- Patio: tables and couches with misters
- Bathroom (from the hub): 5 urinals and shelf to park your beer glass which he thought was awesome

Lowlights:
- OC chain so not really getting the AZ experience. 

Nice afternoon spot for drinks and snacks."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. I always get the tomato bisque soup to start DELISH! its very light and creamy with a touch of basil and homemade croutons. for the entree i can never resist one of two items.
 1) truffle mac and cheese 2) seared ahi dinner.
Mac & Cheese- very cheesy/creamy, bits of bacon and a truffle glaze
Ahi- Seared Ahi drenched in a Chinese black bean sauce with crisp basil on a bed of brown rice.
these items are a must try!
And now for the fun part.... THE BEER! 
***Young's Double Chocolate Stout- omg its desert in a glass.
***Big Sky Moose Drool- a creamy, slightly hoppy beer you could pair it with anything
***House Honey Blonde- the perfect summer beer. amazingly refreshing
***Sam Adams Cherry Wheat-  The best Sam Adams has to offer! a bright cherry flavored wheat beer with a crisp finish.. DELISH!
***Chimay Triple- slight raisin taste with a touch of hops.. yum! perfect before dinner beer.

why only 3 stars? the bar service is terrible. this location and red rock."}
{"text":"Excellent service as always. I organized a company luncheon at the Linq location. From beginning to end Yard House made everything extremely easy to set up. They were very accommodating as I had one employee that was vegetarian and another with a lot of food allergies. They were able to put together a very nice set lunch for me and gave me some additional options as well. The food was great. Everyone was happy with the choices and the food tasted good. Our service was very good as usual. This is a great venue for a quick lunch or a large party. We had a lot of people so I felt like we kept the servers on their toes, but they made sure to keep our drinks refilled and were always there when we needed them."}
{"text":"I really like this location. The bartenders are usually very attentive, specifically Kat. She really knows her stuff and seems to genuinely care about answering the questions correctly or going to find out more info.
My friend is vegan and every time she asks a questions she seems to get varying answers, which is a little frustrating. But overall this place serves me just right 
I usually stop by here on my way home from work or before a night out. 
They have a great Happy Hour. Mon-Fri 3pm to 6pm, and Sun-Wed 10 to close. My favorites are the Fat Cat wine and Spicy Tuna roll, even if they ask me if I've ever had it EVERY TIME.
Some other favorites are the Mac and Cheese, sans bacon. I know! I know, the horror!  Calamari is also pretty tasty, as well as the chicken appetizer with peanut sauce. I'll also often order a cup of clam chowder (with Tabasco, of course)

I usually end up at the bar, but the patio is also nice. 
I rarely sit at a table, but keep in mind there always seems to be a wait.

Also, I'm not much for deserts, but ordered this salted caramel butterscotch pudding desert once and it was amazing. I seriously could not stop eating it. Beware, it's addicting."}
{"text":"Impressive Beer Selection. We did have an issue with our order but the manager made it right. Kudos.  This place does get busy and does get loud.  Be prepared to wait a bit for a table but don't worry - if you are out on the town for a good time, you'll definitely have one here.

If you are speed shopping in Desert Ridge, you might get a little impatient."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great food, friendly service, and consistent. I also love how late they stay open. Every time I stop by with the boyfriend or the girlfriend, I know I will walk away happy and full. Plus, the location is prime. I love the steak and the shrimp ceviche but my favorite dish is the Chicken Garlic Noodles. I can eat that as an appetizer all by itself. The creme brulee is probably the best dessert as well."}
{"text":"Great beer and even cocktails menus. Love Leinenkugel Sunset Wheat, Sam Adams Cherry Wheat or Ruby Red cocktail. Hard to pick a winner. I've heard the new beer cocktails are \"weird\" so haven't tried those.

Service is usually good. The servers attitudes are sometimes better than the food runners. I've had plates slung at me...I laughed it off on all accounts, it's a tough job, I get it. They try to keep drinks filled, sometimes they succeed. Better at keeping the alcohol flowing than the water, if you get my drift aka $$. 

Some of my family's favorites are chicken fingers (kids menu), their fries, spicy tuna roll & California roll (two of my faves), seared ahi sashimi, Pastrami Sliders & the chicken lettuce wraps. Mac n Cheese is AMAZING, but I usually allow myself to order it once a year- it's so rich. Also, loved the Lobster Garlic Noodle; it's a special occasion dish, too! Any of their salads are good. The Gorgonzola dressing is great. Skip their pizzas. 

Check their HH special before you go.

Overall, I am especially fond of the vibe, the layout/lighting & decor, and their great playlist. Service and food are good enough and the drinks are great!"}
{"text":"We went there on a busy night with a large party, our wait to be seated was not long, we had great service although I had received a burger that was way over cooked to the point of where I did not want to eat it. Everything was good besides the burger. Our server was nice and responded to our requests quickly."}
{"text":"Highly recommend. My dinner was excellent only topped by our great waiter Dan!"}
{"text":"this is a great happy hour spot after work. you can't beat the beer selection - the framboise is my fave!  the food's pretty good, too - and it's always lively."}
{"text":"My first time in a YardHouse and we were approached by Alli the Bartender, Her attitude is infectious, amazing very knowledgeable about beer, I recommend  anyone in the area to come and grab  a beer or 2,3,4,5 f it just get a 6 pack sampler Alli will take care of you"}
{"text":"Two stars for me.  Stopped by for lunch and had a single baja fish taco and the pepper jack burger.  The tortilla for the taco was too thick and there was a single small dollop of guacamole in the middle.  The burger was smallish and no better than what I've had at a Ruby Tuesday's or Applebee's.  Bun seemed a bit stale.  Was expecting better based on the reviews.  Fries were the shoestring type and I've never been a fan (can't recall if the menu stated they were or not).  May give it another shot for dinner and see if it turns out better but lunch was pretty disappointing.  Should have gone to In n Out Burger.  

Will say it is in a nice location.  Beer selection is good.  Much better than you'll find in most chains."}
{"text":"Skip the Spicy Chicken Sandwich. The cheesy flatbread is too dry and overpowers the sandwich."}
{"text":"Visited on a Monday night for dinner, and still had to wait 15 minutes for a table.  Large and well-rounded draft beer selection, with a large food menu to boot.  The onion rings were pretty tasty, and the portion was just right.  I enjoyed the hot chicken meal, although I will try something else next time.  My wife enjoyed her Cobb salad, as well.  I am looking forward to bringing our kids because the kids menu is much more exciting than typical.  Will try to get back soon!"}
{"text":"What can I say...Simply the BEST Happy Hour on the strip. Amazingly delicious food and fantastic beer selection all in one place.

The atmosphere and decor is welcoming. The prices, especially during happy hour are outstanding.

The location...It's right below the LINQ. 

What's more to say. This is the place to go for too many reasons. See you there !!!"}
{"text":"My spot!!!! Can't go wrong with the brew selection.. I prefer their Belgium brews like delirium. This time around I went with some Hendricks gin n a splash of tonic..."}
{"text":"Great food great service. Good prices. Happy hour deals are awesome. Not to mention the over 100 beers on tap! 

I have only been here before for drinks, they have great deal on their large selection. The food is just as good! Good atmosphere as well"}
{"text":"Visited this location a month ago and ordered the salad, lamb burger and hot wings.  Food was delicious and the food server was attentive.  Atmosphere was amazing."}
{"text":"Super disappointed. We went in with a party of 8 adults 3 kids. We sat in the patio and while the mist was going it was great but then they turned it off and we immediately felt the humidity and each one of the little hoses was dripping on to us and our table. 

We had 2 servers, overall they were super friendly but it was clear they didn't communicate with each other. They each asked if we wanted appetizers. They each asked if we were ready for our bill. When both had been taking care of by the one that came first. It was a male server and female server. We ordered through the male server, he forgot a salad that was ordered so we asked the female server. The chop salad that had been forgotten ended up being very bland anyway :/ . Then we returned a watery clam chowder back to the male server and nothing was done on the bill for it. We didn't want anything to replace it. The woman server didn't even know we returned it. 
It was just very unorganized.

I have been to this location several times before so I know what a wonderful experience is & idk if it was just an off night for them but our experience was not great overall. Also, the food quality seems to be suffering. I didn't care for the enchilada stack that I ordered. I've had it before and thought it was great before. 

Otherwise, I loved the ambiance. But I don't think I'll be back by choice."}
{"text":"Love yard house! Went for happy hour yesterday and filled my belly until I burst and still took home leftovers. Happy hour is 3-6pm mon-fri half price apps, discounted beer and wine. Thai chicken pizza is the bomb. I get that and the garlic noodles every time. The sliders are great too! My girl friend and I walked in and we sat right away. Service was prompt and the food was served quickly. Gourmet apps at great prices! I usually go here once a month."}
{"text":"Matt f was a great server! He's  personable and made me feel very welcome. He knew a lot about beer, which is great because I love craft beer and the long list can be overwhelming! He made my experience easy and fun! I definitely hope to have him as my server again!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Best bartenders, best selection of beers (over 120) on tap and the best food ever. I'd suggest trying their version of a California roll. It's a lightly fried rice cake with everything you'd find in a California roll with a kick to it (jalapeño added)

The street tacos are a hit too as well as the Brussels sprout appetizer. DELISH"}
{"text":"I don't know why it has taken me so long to write a review for Yardhouse but I've been coming here for years! But I went yesterday and thought I should write about it. So here it goes...

And it's always been a good situation, food is good, drinks are good! It's like an upscale sports bar, but not. Plus I love that it's in the Westgate Entertainment center, so great atmosphere. The service is good. 

I love the lobster and spinach artichoke dip it is truly something special. As an entree I usually get the vodka shrimp pasta yum! I guess if I had to find opportunities of improvement, it would be to expand the menu. But in actuality. I really like it here a lot!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty cool place.  We had a big family get together here because it's kind of in the mid-point between the Henderson contingent of our family and those of us in the Northwest part of Las Vegas.  Service was prompt and friendly. Part of our group had already been seated when the rest of arrived and we hadn't sat for a second before someone appeared to grab drink orders for the new arrivals.

This place has an extensive beer selection - I tried one (the rose something... which I didn't really care for, but I still will have to come back to try some of their other offerings).  Food was, for the most part, really good.  Our large group had a variety of dishes for lunch and they were all pretty tasty, not to mention huge.  We shared a couple of desserts as well.  They were ok, but in my view not worth writing home about."}
{"text":"I've been to The Yard House at the Scottsdale Fashion Square twice now and, overall, have enjoyed my experience. The beer selection as all the other reviews have alluded to is lengthy, so there is definitely something for everyone.  Both times though, I have found the bar service a bit lacking. Now I understand during happy hour when the place is full and the bar is hopping, it'll take a few minutes to get service. But, when the place is pretty empty, I don't think it should take 10 minutes to get a drink sitting at the bar."}
{"text":"I must say, I was impressed with this Yard House. I wasn't fond when I went in Raleigh, but we had limited options on Christmas Day after hiking at Red Rocks. The place was packed and they had a 40 minute wait for lunch.

Once we were seated, our fantastic waitress brought us waters and offered some suggestions on the menu. We started with the chicken tender appetizer and I got a barbecue chicken salad for lunch. I went for the small size which was still way too big. Note to others: do not get the regular size unless you're planning on eating it for 3 meals straight. Seriously.

The chicken tenders hit the spot--not overbreaded and still had some flavor. My salad I didn't enjoy quite as much, but it certainly wasn't bad. It had a good portion of chicken along with lots of other fix ins that made it truly a barbecue chicken salad instead of a salad with chicken and barbecue sauce.

We also split a brownie for dessert. It was way too hot but still excellent and a good way to finish a good meal.

Again, our waitress was fantastic and on top of everything. Food was good, service was good, atmosphere was good. I was impressed."}
{"text":"Yard House has been one of my favorite hang out spots with friends for the longest time. It's at Town Square and right by UNLV, perfect place to go to during Happy Hour with the amount of draft beers they have!!

The restaurant is huge inside with outdoor seating!! I like sitting outside during fall/spring time frame and definitely indoors during winter and summer. It's a laid back chill environment that's good for everyone. The ambient lighting is good for that kind of romantic feeling if you want it to be, but also just to relax and chill. 

I'm here for Happy Hour with a bunch of friends usually, we used to frequent this place at least once a week, now not so much as we're getting tired of the same ol' thing, lol. 

I like trying something different every time I come here as far as the draft beer goes. I've tried almost everything and found some of my favorite types through doing this! Just gotta keep an open mind and be willing to try something new in order for this to work out! Amber ales have been my favorites, followed by stouts, and then lagers, but I've also been spoiled by what's on tap and now I stay away from bottled beer as much as possible! It really does taste different.

With my friends and I, we usually just stick around to what's on the appetizer menu, because they're half off during Happy Hour. Some of our favorites include the Chicken Nachos, Chicken Tenders, Seared Ahi Sashimi, Sliders, Spinach artichoke dip, and pizza. You'll almost always see these items on our table from the Happy Hour menu. Other items we usually end up ordering are the Truffle Fries and the Mac & Cheese. The portions are decent for the appetizers and good for sharing, especially the Chicken Nachos. 

It's good for just all around hang out with a bunch of friends to just relax and catch up. I don't usually do large groups at other places, but here it's fine, because it does get pretty loud."}
{"text":"We've visited the Yard House a few times now in the past month and both visits were exceptional: great service, excellent food, and a clean and enjoyable atmosphere with a good music playlist to boot.

Their firecracker wings coupled with their house ranch is a winning combination; maybe some of the best wings in town. Just the right amount of hot meets sweet. The margarita pizza also gets two thumbs up. Lastly, the nachos were plentiful, although we'll probably try something else in their place next visit. 

The Yard House has a fantastic Happy Hour. Very agreeable prices on some amazing pizza & wings.  Definitely worth checking out. We'll be back many more times."}
{"text":"Been here quite a few times.  Love all of the alcohol options, great service and good food! Chicken fried chicken is to die for!!! Also in love with truffle fries!!!! I would recommend this place to others!!"}
{"text":"A chain restaurant at its peak form. Every Yard House that I've been to has been consistent in its delivery and quality from service to food. Yard House is probably most well known in the areas that it serves for its world-class on-tap beer selection. There really are too many to count, I'd guess close to 100 different beers from all over the world and varied in styles and flavors. Coming in to a Yard House, you'll stroll by their windowed massive refrigerator where all the kegs are kept frostily chilled. It's a sight to behold for any beer lover and few places rival.

But Yard House is not just a bar, it's an excellent full-service restaurant that excels in wide-variety of foods to pair with your selected beer. From appetizers which include a very untraditional Spicy Tuna Roll and excellent, meaty chicken wings to their large sandwiches (Cuban Pork Sandwich is great!) and seafood dishes that include a fantastically prepared Ginger-Crusted Salmon, they do have something for everybody. Prices are affordable for what you get and portions are usually enough to have a little to take home for the next day.

The Yard House is less about one specific thing that sticks in your mind after dining there. It's more about the experience as a whole. The beers flow, the food is eaten and fun is had. I could go over a huge list of things I've had there an enjoyed thoroughly, but it's less important than the general feeling I'm trying to convey that the atmosphere and quality of the Yard House make it a winner anytime no matter what you feel like ordering."}
{"text":"Whether in SoCal or Arizona, The Yard house  is never a let down! Plenty of beers on tap, including local AZ beers. Lots of people and good appetizers. After a few letdowns in the area with bars, this was the most fun of them all that night! Definitely will be back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Was out of town visiting Red Rock. Wanted a good and light lunch. Got the Kale Caesar salad with Ahi tuna. Awesome and so fresh. Waitress was super friendly and attentive. Wife got the carnitas tacos. Oh, get the deviled eggs! They were perfect for two people!"}
{"text":"The wait wasn't too bad, I came in Friday around happy hour. The food was delicious but not just once but TWICE! I had to pull out really long blonde hairs from my food. My hair is short and violet so definitely wasn't mine. I didn't want to be a pain so i didn't make a deal about it, I just hope they keep the service more sanitary from now on. Hopefully this review will help"}
{"text":"Outstanding bar tending service by Kim, fantastic fresh food and mojitos..... I was in heaven!!
I love it when you first pull up a bar stool sit down and the bartender immediately greets you with a smile and is easy to make you a drink STAT. I new it was going to be a good when they had Mojitos on the menu and KIM provided a couple of recommendations for food...our choices were DELICIOUS... poke nachos, Baja taco, fried mac n cheese."}
{"text":"No happy hour here, even though it indicates on yelp/website that there is one. Service was good. Bartender was cool and let us try some beers before picking one. 3 stars mostly for lack of happy hour."}
{"text":"Came here today to take some unexpected friends out for some food. They were uber-hungover and needed some bad for you food. I had my monkeys in tow so it had to be some place loud. Yard House was the answer. 

The whole experience was wonderful starting from Amy, the hostess (she was very bubbly and genuinely cared about how my day was going) to Tracy, our server. She quickly brought out a Mac N' Cheese 2 for the kids (such a blessing to get quick food for little ones). We tried a bunch of different plates...like the ahi tuna poke bowl, spicy tuna roll, deviled eggs (which I didn't have...wasn't feeling it today), truffle fries, a burger with no bun, a steak sandwich with sweet potato fries drizzled with some honey sauce that made me want to scream with delight. The monkeys downed the Mac N Cheese like it was their last meal and were blessedly quiet. 

Will be back again soon :)"}
{"text":"They've changed around the happy hour menu, but, it's a good change! 

AHI TUNA  SLIDERS FOR $9.95! They are good and SO worth it! Yeeeeeeeuh"}
{"text":"Beer. Beer! BEER!! 

As far as the eye can see. Beer.

And football on more TVs than you can count. 

The food wasn't too bad, I had the chopped salad and an order of sweet potato fries. The salad is pretty interesting, it's one of those \"no lettuce\" salads, it's loaded with corn, cilantro, celery, bacon and tomatoes with a bloody Mary vinagrette. The sweet potato fries are served with a maple bacon cream which could have been good if there was more bacon flavor and way less maple. It tasted like cupcake frosting. 

The service here wasn't too bad, the bartenders were friendly enough but they got completely swamped at around 4 when the place started to fill. My bartender was nice but didn't really listen when I ordered so I got the wrong fries delivered. Easy enough mistake to fix.

I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here, but if I'm in the area I would definitely stop in for a quick beer before shopping at the mall."}
{"text":"Love the food amazing for being as vegan as I can be amazing place to dine in on a date with options for us. Our order has come our a few times with seafood in it but we look past it for the amazing staff and management willing to correct it. As well as more than happy to serve us. When ever our order has been wrong we still paid full price we weren't looking for a freebie just simply a correction in the kitchen and it was made. Great drinks, food, and staff, will always return."}
{"text":"As broke college students, my friends and I came to this place a lot for happy hour. At the end of every semester we were here or the Yardhouse at the Linq. We always came as a big group (between 10 and 24) and the staff was always accommodating from putting tables together to separating each and every single check. 

Their happy hour menu features quite a selection. Their chicken nachos were always popular for the guys in our group. The serving is huge so it can definitely be shared by 4-6 people. Onion ring tower is delicious, it comes with ranch and some other sauce. The other sauce is delicious, I just don't know what it is. The garlic chicken noodles is my favorite thing on their happy hour menu, it has a lot of flavor and is definitely good enough for a meal even though it's listed as an appetizer. My friends have ordered almost all the pizzas their and they're nothing special. Although I am from New York so I'm a pizza snob lol. Spinach dip is also yummy but very rich. 

Our favorite drinks are the ciders especially the pear and raspberry ones. My friends have ordered  many different kinds of ales, beers, etc and have enjoyed each and every one. 

Recently, we came for lunch and I ordered their lunch special. It consisted of either a pizza or sandwich with soup or salad. I had the pastrami sandwich with clam chowder. The pastrami sandwich lacked cheese and mustard but did come served with jalapeños. It was good but not quite what I expected. The clam chowder was yummy and I wished I had just ordered that by itself. 

All in all, it has decent food and definitely a nice place to hangout with some friends."}
{"text":"This place knows beer, that's for sure.  I can't be completely sure but it seemed that there were well over 75 beers on tap.  The food is pretty good and not absurdly priced.  The only problem?  Atmosphere.

It seems like the owners of the Yard House got together and decided to make a bar/restaurant for the Scottsdale crowd.  Noble plan, right?  So they listed all the attributes of a cool bar: lots of options, a signature element (more beers on tap than anyone in Pho-town), beautiful people, roomy booths and patio seating.  

It all comes across as pretty good, but there's nothing that really makes this place memorable.  It's actually like going to a mall versus going to your favorite little funky thrift store.  All the right elements are there, but some bit of soul hs been drained out, which is actually my critique of Scottsdale more generally.  

So if you're looking for a random beer or some bar food while shopping at the mall, the Yard House is the place to go.  But it's basically forgettable."}
{"text":"Normally, Yard House is a sure thing. We came to this location as we had family staying on The Strip and they have never been to The Linq. At first, we were going to Brooklyn Bowl, but because it was a nice night, we wanted to sit out on the patio for dinner.

Food and drinks are always good at YH. I had the surf and turf burger. However it didn't have the buttery goodness as how it's served at the Irvine Spectrum location. My husband had the lobster and crab omlette. The small bite I had, the egg seemed over cooked. My brother-in-law had the seared ahi that he enjoyed very much.

Dinner and family conversation was going well until the alley singer came back from \"lunch\" to finish her gig. The music playing in YH was already loud so adding the high pitch alley singer, who also had her sound louder than YH, started to give us a headache. Unfortunately, because the alley singer has a performers permit, they couldn't shut her down. 

On top of that, the tourist sitting at the table next to us had too much to drink that he didn't make it to the restroom and barfed against the restaurant wall behind me. I wouldn't have noticed because it was so loud, but it was at my brother-in-law side view that he saw it all. The servers were quick to clean up after the incident.

I have to say that our server was absolutely fabulous.

So despite all that was unpleasant with this location, I still love YH, just won't be returning to this location anytime soon."}
{"text":"I enjoy this chain. Been to the one in Miami and now Vegas.  The draft beer selection is insane, 170 I believe.  Menu varied from Miami but excellent.  I had Pineapple Maui chicken and it was huge.  Will be back."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've ordered a Vegan burger...and it tastes fantastic! Very impressive. Red quinoa kale, shiitakes, daiya mozzarella, avocado, tomato arugula, onion, miso, onion bun and mixed greens - it tasted as good as it sounded!! The patty was grilled fantastically, well formed, great flavors, and some smokey taste to it too.

I went with the truffle fries and they were really well done. You definitely could taste the truffle flavor that's so rich. I also tried the blueberry ketchup as my dip, and that was okay. They did it well, where you can taste the ketchup but also the sweetness of the blueberry, but I didn't really enjoy it, at least not with fries. One bite would taste like ketchup, another would taste like blueberry jam.

They also have a great selection of beers and a wide variety, from light lagers, to sours, to stouts, whatever you like they have at least a couple beers for it.

The server was attentive and helpful in deciding on our choices, but also was just a tiny bit off-putting with his hate of vegetarian dishes. Not too big of an issue, but if I was a vegetarian or a vegan, I could easily be offended."}
{"text":"Lots of menu options for food and beer. Service was good but the food was just ok. In particular my ribeye was undercooked and not very flavorful. Seemed more like a sirloin. Decent serving sizes, but overall the pricing felt slightly high--the Scottsdale factor. 

Seated and served promptly on a quiet Monday evening. Overall it was fairly quiet, which I prefer, but lots of space and lots of TVs--I imagine it might be quite different on another evening."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times were a pretty good experience. Fill disclosure, I was here both times for a lunch treat from work. I might have a little more positive outlook, since I wasn't paying the bill.

The lunch crowd during the week isn't bad. We would have a reservation but it was never required. Large place with lots of space to handle heavy volume. I've seen this place look pretty busy on the weekends. They have TV's playing all the sports, so this would be a good place to see the game.

I'm on a low carb diet so I couldn't eat everything, but here are some comments from my friends. The apps were pretty good. They liked the truffle fries, hummus, spinach artichoke dip, and fried cheese curds. One of the guys is vegan and was very impressed with the vegan options and the taste of the dish he ordered. Others preferred burgers and they had nothing but good things to say about them. I personally ordered the kale salad in the picture. It was very good. I think I would have liked a little more dressing on it. The skirt steak was tender and cooked to order. The other time I ordered the same salad with salmon. The salmon piece was kind of small but it was cooked well.

Lunch would take about an hour so it was about right since we had to get back to work. Yard House is a chain and it's menu is full of options sure to please."}
{"text":"Although the food was good, our waitress dropped a dish at a nearby table (she was also waiting on). As a result of dropping the dish at the nearby table, the rather obnoxious Male manager fired the waitress mid-meal, sending her home. They then proceeded to leave our table unattended for almost 40 minutes. I have never experienced such unprofessionalism in any restaurant I've ever been to. Overall: good food, although an awful, unforgettable experience."}
{"text":"Best Happy Hour at Westgate!  Delicious food at a perfect price!  Love the onion rings, chicken garlic pasta, Hawaiian Poke Stack, among many other items.  Jen was an exceptional server!  She was very attentive with our refills and any other services we needed!"}

{"text":"Had a great experience at this particular yard house. Sat at the bar for lunch was waited on immediately with ice water and a menu. (Bartender Josh S.)  Ordered poké nachos which were incredible but coulda been been a few more pieces of fish but concept and flavor was amazing (for a chain spot) This spot had a chill vibe for being on the strip definitely a place to grab lunch or a couple of mid-day drinks"}
{"text":"Very good place to hang out and grab a beer.  My wife and I had a great dinner and a couple drinks  with friends.  The atmosphere is casual and service was attentive!  I had the Nashville hot chicken which didn't really have much spice but was tasty nonetheless. My wife jade the red quinoa kale salad served in a bowl as big as she was.  We would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I'm in Las Vegas for a week for work... I'm not a gambler but the assortment of food is exciting. I finally went farther than near the hotel I'm staying in for dinner and I am so pleased with the yard house. First I parked by the Linq, passed the yard house, and then walked around to enjoy the atmosphere figuring I'd eat anywhere. After looking at all my choices I still wanted to try the yard house. 

I chose the shrimp rice bowl, kind of simple but when traveling and getting up for early I don't like too many heavy meals. Oh. My. Goodness it was perfect! Also fairly fast. The server was fantastic and very accommodating. I then added a lemon soufflé at the end for dessert. Let's just say I left a big tip because my dinner price was much less than expected! 

I'd come back."}
{"text":"First time here, wanted to see what the hype was about. Nice atmosphere cheese curds are the best. Great place to drink hang out catch a game. I order Jambalaya shrimp was not impress not much flavor only 5 shrimps. A little expensive but I can see why people like it as for me not sure if I will go back"}
{"text":"Ordered the sliders and chicken wings, plus multiple samples of beers. Have no complaints. The sliders were cooked to perfection and the beers were cold.
Out server, Christine was awesome and prompt. She made us feel welcomed and special. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great food, huge draft-beer selection. Don't get the house beers as they are just mediocre and there are many excellent other beers to order.
My big problem with this place, though, is the beer pricing. If you come during happy hour, fine, the prices are clearly stated on the menu. And actually, during happy hour, the beers are priced fairly, not really cheap, but fair, and the happy-hour appetizers are great deals and delicious. 
But if you come outside of happy hour, there are no prices listed for beers. There are hundreds of beers and they all are priced differently. Asking a waiter brings a vague response: \"The most expensive one is $8.50 so most of them are less than that.\" But they ain't much less! It's easy to spend $7 on a pint without realizing it. So...insist that the waiter give you the price of each beer before you order. Or, better plan, come only during happy hour."}
{"text":"This is my second time here and it has improved since the first!!! Food is ver flavorful and good potions too. I will be coming back to try more food on the menu. The music played is up beat and fun to listen to while eating!!! Thank you and see you soon!!!!"}
{"text":"Yard House is the perfect place to have lunch or dinner at after watching a  movie. I've been here twice but my last visit was when I actually tried their food.  Every time I visit it's always crowded, especially on nights when there's a football game on, which was the reason why my friends and I waited for over 15 minutes, but this wasn't a problem.

Yard House has a huge menu that begins with several pages dedicated to beers and other alcoholic beverages. They have a good selection of foods to order. I particularly liked the section where you can sub dishes containing meat with soy.

FOOD

+ Baja Fish: Two fried fish tacos topped with shredded cabbage, pico de gallo, guacamole, and sriracha ailoi. This also comes with a side of beans and rice, but I opted for steamed vegetables instead. The tacos were good and have a little spice to them.  I didn't enjoy the flour tortillas. I prefer corn over flour any day when it comes to fish tacos. I also didn't like how small the tacos were, though I learned that you can order more than the two you receive; however, any extras will cost you an additional $5. I'm glad I inquired about this since our waiter didn't mention this when I was asking him questions about ordering additional tacos. 

Originally I wanted just the beans and no rice, but our waiter said that counts as one side. I asked if the reason why it's considered as one side is because the beans and rice are mixed together. He said \"no\" and that it's just the restaurant's policy. He also said he could go ask the kitchen if what he said is correct, but he wasn't in a hurry to do that and just stood there waiting for me to make an order after I said it would be cool if he'd ask. (ok then, forget it!). So I chose steamed veggies instead over the stir fry option. I like steamed vegetables, but the veggies I received were watery and disgusting. 

+ Chicken Nachos: My generous friend offered to share her humongous plate of Chicken Nachos since the two little fish tacos I consumed didn't satiate me. The nachos are topped with chunks of chicken, guacamole, cheese, sour cream, beans, and onions. The nachos tasted better than my tacos, but I disliked how there was fat and skin left on the chunks of chicken. Not cool.

SERVICE
No problem with the servers or hostess, but we were displeased with our waiter.

+ I understand that the place was packed when we visited, but our waiter didn't come to our table until 10 minutes after we were seated. We ordered our beverages and it took  five minutes for him to return with our drinks. 

+ When I was finished with my food (plate empty, utensils down, and me sitting there not eating indicates I am finished eating), he came to our table three times, looked at our table, said nothing, then walked away. When he returned for the fourth time he asked me if I was done eating in which I replied with \"yes\", then finally took my plate away.

+ He called my friend \"bro\" when SHE asked for another glass of beer. I guess her side ponytail, makeup, and her magenta pants really screams \"bro\".

+ As I've previously mentioned, he didn't bother returning to the kitchen to inquire about the question I had about the beans and rice that came with my tacos, and he also tried to get me to buy more tacos without explaining to me that I'll be charged extra. I understand  that it's implied that additional food costs more, but it should also be mentioned because that's just good, honest customer service. 

OVERALL

I can see myself making another visit to Yard House, but I'll have to skip on the fish tacos and the mediocre service, which I hope I won't have to experience again."}
{"text":"The service was great considering how busy it was hence the 1 star I give this place. The food was 0 stars. Other than that, I would have given this place no stars. I ordered the angel hair pasta, my bf ordered the dip with a side of sweet potato fries and our friend ordered a grilled chicken sandwhich with broccoli. When all of our orders came out, I tried the fries and they were cold. I mentioned it to my boyfriend and when he touched his sandwhich, it was also cold. I thought that was a bit weird, but when my friend took a bite if his sandwhich he said his chicken was also cold. I was thinking, maybe because it's a sandwhich, it wouldn't be that warm even though my bf ordered the roast beef dip. So, I took a bite of my pasta and my pasta was dry, bland, and COLD. It seemed like they left it out for a long time because the pasta was kind of stale. It was by far the worst meal I have eaten. No one in my party enjoyed their cold food. The food is over priced and they serve cold food. What I did notice yesterday night because I was sitting in front of the kitchen, was the food was coming out fast, but the food was standing there forever. I saw 4 dishes waiting there to be picked up for roughly 10 min. No wonder the food was getting cold! Not enough runners to even bring the food out. Horrible way to manage a business that can't have enough staff to bring out orders. I will never return here for the food. Like a huge company like this, they should have already gotten their shit together. Horrible."}
{"text":"If you're in Dallas' section, I suggest moving. We typically come here twice a week for happy hour and drinks. I normally get my sliders and my partner gets the spinach dip and whatever else. This time, same thing yet it took an hour to get our food. We were treated by the servers assistant because she was on her break. She never came to the table to take our order because the assistant did. 
We got the spinach dip and drinks and waited roughly 45 minutes for our food... When we asked our server where our food was, the order had never actually been put in. She gave us the biggest attitude.
Now it's HAPPY HOUR finally yet we arrived an prior to it.... and our order is finally being put in.
We get our food 10 minutes later and start to eat. We ask for our check and end up waiting til we are done eating and then some.... so we walked up to the hostess stand. Dallas comes back our table surprised that we left, so she heads over to stand we are at with an attitude and hands us the check. She DIDN'T even give us the happy hour pricing... 
We'll just choose another place to eat from now on our weekly date nights. That wasn't right."}
{"text":"We just happened upon the Yard House while scoping out the shopping area by The Linq. The restaurant is pretty huge, I feel like we walked forever to finally be seated at our table, but it is a great space. 

Hubby and father in law both ordered beers, I just had some yummy jasmine iced tea.
I had fish tacos, and the guys had a burger and pizza. We all pretty much finished everything on our plates. The fish tacos we quite delicious, and those skinny little fries that came with the burger were great. Our server was very helpful and friendly. Prices for Vegas were reasonable.

One star off because the beers arrived AFTER the food did.

I'd come again."}
{"text":"I cannot exaggerate how amazing Yardhouse is! Their entree's are beyond delicious, their prices are reasonable, their atmosphere is big/mellow/fancy/dimmed/fun, their servers have always been friendly and it's quite welcoming! I love their food, it never seizes to amaze me how delicate their taste is! I've been here with groups of co-workers/colleagues, on dates and not once have I've had a bad experience. Yardhouse also has a bar with lots of beer/wine/alcohol selections so if anyone's curious, it's there.

Anyways, my overall experiences with this restaurant have been phenomenal! Highly suggested-"}
{"text":"Not only did I receive amazing bartending service by Josh on Thursday for my 21st birthday, but the next night when I went in on Friday just minutes past 1am... I asked for soup and they told me they was closed BUT shelbie went out of her way to go to the kitchen and graciously got me a bowl of tomato bisque before they were going to throw it out and stop serving. my birthday was October 1st and I came all the way from long beach to stay at red rock casino with my mom to celebrate and it was well worth it. I had multiple drinks at the bar to celebrate my 21st and Josh took AMAZING care of us and made my birthday fun with innovative new shots and attending to me consistently making sure we were good. he was the first person in Vegas to card me so it was fun :) I used to work at yard house at the pike so I know the hours are long and they stay open late so I am sooooo appreciative of Shelbie catering to my drunkenness friday night (Oct 3rd) and getting me the most delicious tomato bisque soup (plus bread and crackers!!!) about 5 mins past 1am. employees like that are an amazing assets to the yard house team and Josh (the trainer and bartender) and shelbie (the waitres) should be recognized for their sincerity and great attitudes. I am impressed with yard house at red rock casino and would definitely return!! thank you! I am so happy I am eating my tomato bisque as I write this haha.. thank you for an amazing birthday and delicious drinks and food. MUCH LOVE ! xoxo :) 5 stars and will return."}
{"text":"While I am not typically a fan of trying out commercial restaurants while visiting another city, this location of Yard House provided excellent service and food.
We started off ordering a couple drinks. I told the waitress I was craving something grapefruit and she brought me a beer that was delicious but I am not exactly sure what it was called. My boyfriend ordered a sour beer that was excellent as well if that is your fancy. 
We ordered the \"Poke Stack\" which is poke served with crispy wonton sheets with avocado on the side. 
I ordered the Mac and Cheese Squared which comes with chicken, bacon, mushrooms, cheddar, Parmesan, and truffle oil. Do yourself a favor and order the small because even that portion is huge! 
I mostly did this because there was no fridge for leftovers back at our room. 
My boyfriend ordered the Maui Pineapple chicken with vegetable fried rice. I didn't manage to get a good picture of this but I loved the taste of this. 
If you get a good seat at this restaurant then you can see the Linq High Roller Ferris wheel and the rail pass by."}
{"text":"Loved this place in Hawaii and I was really excited to find this here in LA. Delicious food and great service."}
{"text":"Tortilla soup is terrible and not tortilla soup. It's chicken stew with some chips on top. Ordered a German beer and it tasted rotten like blue cheese beer."}
{"text":"Service amazing! They didn't have buffalo sliders Anthony was great worked it out with the kitchen and BAM got my sliders!"}
{"text":"Incredible draft beer selection. If you are looking to eat, try the Brazilian bbq tacos.  Quite possibly the best taco that I have ever eaten.  That's what she said!"}
{"text":"Love that Yard House offers Gardein (plant based options.) it's the only reason I go to a Yard House. 
This location was quite large and is good for groups."}
{"text":"I was visiting the area for a conference. The menu seemed interesting. It had a little bit of everything. I decided to order my food for takeout. I had the guacamole and chips and the southern fried chicken entree and a side Guacamole  is guacamole but it had good flavor. The Southern Fried Chicken as a complete dish I wasnt a fan of. The components however was great. The fried chicken was crispy and moist and the bourbon gravy has great flavor. The pinto beans were spicy and they had a smokey flavor. The creamed corn was made with fresh corn and was really smooth. The (spinach) mashed potatoes lacked spinach but was buttery and so good!!.I was also a hearty portion. Overall a great experience!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is always fantastic,  as well as the service. Tonight's service was exceptionally good. It was 6:30 Friday night. Very crowded.  We finally got seated. Next to us was a very drunk and rowdy, as well as  extremely inappropriately dressed crew. We were with our kids and tried to shield them from this group as best we could. We never thought to ask to move as it was very crowded. A few minutes later a waitress comes by to say she was moving us. I thought it was a mistake and said \"no. Wrong party\". A minute later our waitress comes up and explains that she is a mom and that we should not be sat next to this group. That we should be in a more family friendly section. She gets us all settled in with our new server. Everyone was so nice and they even threw in a free appetizer. We never asked for any of this. They went above and beyond to make us comfortable, even with a packed restaurant.  We've always loved this Yardhouse. Great place!"}
{"text":"I feel like a huge douche for not reviewing this earlier. I probably go to this place once to twice a month and have never had a bad experience. Although I do have a great story to share. My roommate and I were eating dinner and he asked for a suggestion for a beer to which our waiter suggested a random German beer. My roommate then thought it would be clever to say \"I can't have anything German, too painful for my roommate, he's Jewish. The Germans burned him pretty bad.\" At this point our waitress looked at me with a completely lost glare on her face and said \"that's horrible!\"

The menu has recently been changed a bit but I'm not sure if it was cosmetic or if items were actually added. If you can find something that isn't absolutely delicious on the menu you've done something wrong. Their spicy jambalaya has crawfish in it which is unheard of and adds an extra level of deliciousness. If you are into eclectic burgers try the surf n' turn which includes asparagus and a lobster claw. I don't think I've had a better burger outside of Burger Bar at Mandalay. Add in their extensive beer selection, great atmosphere, and cheap prices and you basically have the best first date location you could possibly hope for. Or you have the best Sunday hangout, or Friday...or who the hell needs a reason let's just go to Yardhouse! Thank me later, I'll be in the corner having a German beer."}
{"text":"I stopped in this week for lunch and sat at the bar.  Plenty of beers on tap and flat screens for watching sports.

What made this lunch so great was the (mac+cheese)2.  This is simply the best mac and cheese dish that I have ever had!  It has chicken breast, applewood smoked bacon, wild mushrooms, cheddar and parmesan cheese with campanelle pasta and white truffle oil.

I ordered the lunch portion which was more than enough for one person.

Good service and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Dear Yard House, 

I don't like you. Let me clarify; you charge a ridiculous amount of money for beer. Just so we are all clear, I am only reviewing their bar and beer. I did not get the opportunity to dine with the Yard House, and I have a feeling that I won't be going back to do so. I guess I am lucky enough to come from a town that had several true beer houses; beers came from all over the world and you were charged a reasonable price for them. Unfortunately the same cannot be said for the Yard House. I visited the Yard House in Glendale, right next to the Cardinals and Coyotes stadium, and I felt like I was being charged stadium prices. This area looks great for pre and post game activities but I couldn't imagine going there just to \"hang out\" with friends. 

I will give you this - they DO have a great beer selection, if you only want North American beers. The majority of their menu is all North American beers, even their ciders. I'm not a cider drinker but if you do have cider on your list then you always have Strongbow, not at the Yard House. My beer of choice is Bass. Granted Bass is an imported beer and I am willing to pay a hefty $5.50 in most places to enjoy my most favorite of beverages. Yard House thinks they should charge you $6.25. 3 beers = almost $20; that's a little too close to stadium prices if you ask me. Also, these are draft beers that we are talking about - that means the beer should be cheaper than what I would pay if they were in a bottle. From what I could tell, they only had 4 bottles on the menu. 

I had high expectations for you Yard House, but now I see you for what you truly are: just another corporate machine charging high prices for that new niche market of micro brews and exotic beers. Now, leave the money on the table and leave."}
{"text":"A great choice in a hotel with few standout places.  Greatest selection of beers around.  The sampler had 6 choices and they were all good.  Mac & Cheese was outstanding.  Typical bar and grill food.  Very good selection of salads and entrees."}
{"text":"Packed on a Friday night and we waited 30 minutes for a table. Our server, Celal, was very attentive and our beers and food came out in decent timing. 

Opted for the sin city amber and the gorgonzola burger, paired well together. The fries were okay but not the biggest fan of the thin style. The burger was amazing and I brought half of it home for lunch the next day. 

My sister and brother in law brought their 3 week old baby and our server surprised them with a couple desserts with congrats written on the plate. Such a nice surprise! Very happy with the service provided by Celal."}
{"text":"Anothee great visit!  Sat at bar...ordered apps + sandwiches, cocktails + beer.  Not one complaint.   Dont recall last  time I had any issues here...if at all."}
{"text":"If you're a beer lover, you must stop here. They have hundreds of different beer on tap including Dogfish Head 120 when we stopped by.

The bartenders really know their shit. Don't be shy about asking for samples either. I was overwhelmed by the selection and I told the guy generally what kind of beer I liked and disliked and he picked a perfect beer for me. They also have a \"short\" size so you can try a bunch of different beers.

We didn't try any food, but it looked really good. They have burgers and pub food along with vegetarian foods and salads too."}
{"text":"Our server was very nice but the food was terrible. The chicken wasn't cooked and still bleeding and the sides for the half rack of rids wasn't even big enough for a kids portion size."}
{"text":"You can read all the reviews you want on the beer selection below.  I would like to discuss the (MAC + CHEESE)2.  Holy cow, this is world-class if you like mac&cheese.  

In fact, it's so much better than anything else, it could be argued that its unfair to compare to regular mac & cheese.  It should have it's own category called \"Awesomeness\".  

It's non traditional mac noodles, which is a nice touch.  Once you read the description you should just close the menu and order up!  A la: chicken breast, applewood smoked bacon, wild mushrooms, cheddar and parmesan with campanelle pasta and white truffle oil.

No joke, it's the real deal Holyfield.  You can definitely taste the truffle oil, but it's not overbearing.  It really adds an amazing flavor.  I guarantee you a happy foodie.  It's a rather large portion, so feel free to get a doggy bag.  It's not a bad idea to do a half portion, I'm sure it's not on the FDA's most healthy food list  ;-)

Splurge on this dish.  Trust me!!"}
{"text":"Great place !!
Nice environment. Good food, good bears and good service.
Had dinner one night and come back next night!
Coconut shrimps are so good !!!"}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate two birthdays in our party and all the waiter did was say you can hang out a little. That's the first time I've ever gone out to celebrate a birthday and they did absolutely nothing but a snide remark. This was a family affair. The waiter was insensitive. We probably should have called a manager. I've been writing for TripSheet Magazine for 15 years and will let the know in my dining and entertainment column. Some 12,000 cab and limo drivers will know not to take birthday parties to The Yard House. My wife was in charge of organizing and both my wife and daughter reminded the waiter. He still got a good tip. We are loyal customers of this establishment. They sent me a $25 gift certificate so my wife and I came back for a late night dinner. I was between the full rack of BBQ ribs and the rib eye steak and the waiter try the steak. It was juicy and delicious. It came with broccolini with too much salt, mashed potatoes and I guess they forget the creamed corn. My wife had the turkey burger which was good. This place was packed on a Thursday night."}
{"text":"I love coming here for their variety of beers asnd great sharable appetizers. The Happy Hour is great but the best part is the service from our amazing bartender Tim!! He always goes above and beyond to make sure my friends and I have a great visit. Whether it's getting us fresh coffee for a late night irish coffee, or explaining new drinks, and featured beers, I always feel welcome and happy to be here because of him. If you come here, look for Tim because he offers great service and truly makes Yard House a fun and welcoming environment!"}
{"text":"Skip the pretense and just give yourself the name \"Beer House\".  Why do we have to listen over and over to your alcohol sales pitch if all we want is a good dinner?  I had the jambalaya and it was a little bit better than what I can make with ingredients bought at the local grocery.  Thanks for sparing me the effort.  My husbands rice bowl was very bland.  The best part of the meal was the salad, but of course they forgot to leave off my croutons.  Maybe the beer has caused them to go blind.  So it is just like every other restaurant that charges minimum $15 to $20 for a mildly satisfactory entree."}
{"text":"This place is quite pricy but the servings are big. The menu is really big too! A lot of choices from American to Asian."}
{"text":"We came here for the beer selection. We ordered and the waiter insisted we try a taste first. It took 20 minutes to get the \"taste\". Immediately said bring the pints. Another 20 minutes. So we sat there for 40 minutes without a drink. Ironically the appetizer showed up before the beer. This was on a sunday night with less than 40 people there. Would have been a much bigger tab if service was reasonable, just an fyi for management."}
{"text":"Went during Happy Hour again. Service was great... food was nice and hot. The server even changed the channel on the big screen TV so I could watch College Football instead of the NFL game.. I love it here!"}
{"text":"I've been here about a dozen times and  the service here is always inconsistent.  My friends love to come here because of the location and Happy Hour. Don't get me wrong.. food here is great but the service of the waitstaff needs a little work. The last time I was there, the food runner dropped off our pizza at the table next to us. We were already irritated the food was taking long so we saw the whole thing. The girls next to us were talking among themselves that they got a free pizza and proceeded to pick and eat the toppings off. The server came by 5 minutes later and apologized to the other table... TOOK THE PIZZA OFF THEIR TABLE... AND DROPPED IT ON OUR TABLE and said \"Sorry... here, enjoy!\" Gross. That was the last straw.. I'm NEVER going back there again. Try the Summerlin or the LINQ location. I've been to both and it's MUCH better service there."}
{"text":"Was just here for my birthday and the Surf and Turf burger was amazing as always. I don't get the fried Calamari anymore because it has the tentacles and I don't like them. But the one thing I love about the yard house is if you try to be adventurous and you don't like the item you ordered they will either take it off your bill or try to please you with something else. My Fiance love the eclipse because they are split."}
{"text":"I had family in town, so we went in for dinner! We started with Tim as a server..he got my apple martini right! Which I appreciate!  But something was Cleary wrong with his attitude and then we were introduced to another server Anima, who was relieving Tim. Figured out what was wrong with Tim! Sorry you had to take one more table.  My Korean grilled bbq beef was ice cold..had no flavor. I never add salt to my food, which I had to..at least for some kind of flavor, but of course no salt or pepper on table. I had to ask another employee walking by for them. we also had to ask for chop sticks after Hawaiian poke stack was already delivered. I put a empty water glass on edge of table, never was refilled. I had to give someone else my half drunk water. She ask twice if we wanted same glass of water refilled but never refilled it. we were never offered more alcoholic beverages. we felt as if we were being rushed to the  point, ALL condiments were removed and well as glasses from table before we were EVEN done finishing our meals. I usually would have spoken to manager, but didn't want to complain nor disrupt our quality time with our visiing family.  sorry we were such inconvenience for both servers! Last two occasions at this location have been terrible!! Never will I be returning to this establishment."}
{"text":"Before riding The High Roller at LINQ we stopped for dinner at Yard House.  The menu was huge and a bit overwhelming.  Their beer selection is insane & they have a ton of signature cocktails as well.

We ordered the Spicy Tuna Roll for a starter and it was great.  It isn't the traditional roll in that there is no rice used.  I would call it more of a Spicy Tuna Tower.  The tuna is layered above a green onion, cucumber, and edamame mixture with avocado & cabbage on top with a sauce surrounding it on the plate.  It was beautiful to look at and the tuna was super fresh!

I wasn't super hungry for dinner, so I appreciated the \"Snacks\" options they had.  I ended up ordering their guacamole & chips and crispy brussels sprouts with ripped potatoes. Both were amazing.  My only criticism would be that the brussels sprouts have a super tasty dipping sauce that you don't see until you've eaten the top layer.  They have it on the bottom, so once you are full you realize there was amazing dipping sauce that you could've been using the entire time.  I was disappointed in that, because it was hardly used due to plating.

My husband ordered the Southern Fried Chicken Breast that comes with creamed corn, bbq baked beans, mashed potatoes, and bourbon gravy.  It was really filling, but he had no complaints.  He loved it all.  We would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Very, very good ... Service was good food was great . Martini was horrible  tasted like NyQuil. It's a beer place so jus stick to beer ."}
{"text":"Me and my husband came here last night after a movie and got seated fairly quickly. We ordered 2 drinks the house tropic which was a little sour (wouldn't order again) and my husband got a jack and coke. We got the cheese curds which I normally love but these were really greasy and were needed to be cooked longer as there was no crunch to it despite the breaded coating. I got the mac and cheese which was ok nothing special but my husband got the peppered steak filet which he raved about through the whole meal. And it was good. We like our steaks well done ( I know, I know major foul) and it was still tender and juicy. So we will probably be back. In total for 3 alcoholic beverages ( and they were small glasses), 1 appetizer and 2 entrees and a 20 dollar tip it cost about $104. So just a heads up to the cost."}
{"text":"Love this place. Service is always on point. Never have a complaint. Happy hour is when the food and beer is the cheapest."}
{"text":"A step above most chain restaurants! I love their chicken egg rolls and coconut shrimp! That's all I order when I go. I also like the cocktail list and beer selection and that you can order small amounts of lots of beers to try. 

Another plus is you can use your Olive Garden gift cards here and get rid of them on much better food!"}
{"text":"This is a full proof, tasty, go-to place for me.  I enjoy a lager anyday of the week and twice on happy hour days! I think that enjoying some great food and drink during happy hour is the absolute way to go at the Yardhouse, for it can be a bit pricy during regular hours.  I am a sucker for the shirmp and vodka pasta. Think there is a bit of crack in it becaus I can't stop eating it even when a button pops off the jeans. But you can get just about any dish here and adore it. I love my beer and I dig the Sunset Wheat on tap! I like to grab a few drinks after dinner on Sunday nights *happy hour* begins at 10pm!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!!  Chris the waiter was fantastic!  Huge kudos to Chef Tony for making me \"man candy aka spicy candied bacon\"!!!  If you come here to eat be sure to order the blueberry ketchup burger !  Don't let the name scare ya, it was phenomenal!!!"}
{"text":"It may be a chain, but if you are looking for the best tap list on the strip, the Yardhouse should be your first stop. It is a haven for beer lovers in the \"Bud Light\" death zone that is the strip. As a craft beer fan, this is exactly what the doctor ordered. 

The food is just ok, but but the prices are reasonable and the variety is staggering. There seems to be a different item for every taste. The are executed well enough, but let's face it, you don't go here for the menu. 

Cheers!"}
{"text":"First time time eating here and it was pretty awesome. The place is gigantic. It was a Saturday at lunch in Crocker park so I figured we would have to wait but there is just SO much room. Our server was awesome and walked us through the also gigantic menu. They have a little bit of everything from tacos to Asian to American. Lots of healthy and vegan options as well! I got the lamb burger with the kale Caesar salad instead of friends an it was pretty amazing. Lots of feta cheese which made me happy and the salad was also a good portion. Eating with my 6 year old I was scared it would be too heavy of a bar atmosphere but the kids menu was awesome and it was perfect for the whole family. We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Awesome!! Upbeat atmosphere, great food and beer selection, tasty desserts, decent pricing and excellent service in general. The lobster, crab and artichoke dip is killer and the chocolate soufflé is really delicious!! The Linq is definitely a fun place to frequent. Yeah baby!!!"}
{"text":"I went back to the Yard House after having a bad experience there to give them another shot. My husband and I really enjoy this restaurant. When we came this time it was a little busier but the server was much more friendly and helpful and the food was great. The manager even came over to make sure we had a good visit this time. My only issue here is that it takes a few minutes pay if you are using a credit card. Maybe there's a traffic jam to use the credit card machine lol."}
{"text":"I love Yard House! My favorite restaurant. Everything on their menu is awesome. Great scene, music, and friendly service. I always have a good time when I come here with family and friends."}
{"text":"Living in the West Valley, I like to choose places to meet up with friends that are convenient for all of us, and Westgate is helpful for that because of it's proximity to the 10 and the 101- and the stadium is pretty hard to miss!

Anyway, I love Yard House for drinks on the patio. I've been there for dinner half a dozen times and it's great food as well. Their happy hour is really great for food and drinks, which is hard to find at Westgate sometimes! I love their crab cakes and nachos, as well as the great beer selection and prices!"}
{"text":"It's a upscale sports bar. There are a lot of TVs and a lot of noise. You have the option of outside seating. Even if it's cold out, they have good heating lamps. The staff is pretty nice and I have never had too many problems the times that I have gone. When I go, I usually stick to the steaks on the menu. You can't go wrong with those options. I have tried some salads and pastas. Those are always ok. I've had almost every appetizer and my favorite is the coconut shrimp. My biggest gripe about this place is that the menu is giant. My feelings are whenever a menu is that big, that can't possibly being doing everything well, or as good as they could be. If they cut down the menu size and focused on fewer things, I think there would be a better product overall."}
{"text":"After a wonderful morning renewing vows at The Flamingo garden chapel my wife and family thought Yard House would be a fun stop for celebratory cocktails. The patio seemed a great place. Temperature was super. Drink orders placed and our waiter Derek was trying hard despite probably oversubscribed on tables to attend to. Service was slowish; but we weren't in a hurry. Lemon drop came without the requested and standard sugar rim for my wife, but Derek took the drink back to make it right. They don't remake the drink. They just pour it into a rimmed glass. Second round- same mistake. But this time \"Tiffany\", a waitress with serious attitude and a mouth on her turns the day downward. Smart mouth, bad training. I left the table to talk to the manager (Beau) and simply request Tiffany serve others and not rain on our parade. Get this- the manager sends her AND her attitude back with the second failed drink; because that's \"her job.\"  
Long story short. Beau and Tiffany need retraining. It's all about choices. We went two doors down and continued our celebration. 
FYI- one of our guests oversees casino experience and says she'll never recommend this Yard House, ever. 
Bottom line - this Yard House came up two and a half feet short of a yard. Pass!"}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Vegas I ate here for dinner on a Friday night and again for lunch on Saturday. The selection of beer is incredible. The house Belgium is fantastic. 

On  Friday I showed just before 5 pm, during happy hour, and the place was packed - not even an empty seat at the bar to have a beer while waiting for a table. I had to wait 25 minutes for a table. Once seated, the service was very friendly but slow and not too attentive. My Korean tacos were satisfactory but otherwise unimpressive. 

On Saturday I showed for lunch about 11:45. Plenty of available seating and once seated the service was fast, friendly, and attentive. My beer this time was the Belgium sampler. Again the house Belgium was the best of the bunch. Lunch was lamb burger and fries. Much better than the Korean tacos the night before. 

Popular place for sure. Fun atmosphere, excellent selection of beers, but only average service and food. Still, the beer alone justifies a return trip."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places. I do not like the way you smell after a night of boozing here (like a chemically smell), but I do love the way I feel. They, obviously, have the best beer selection in Las Vegas. The service is fantastic, and I love the fact that people know my name in here. I always sit at the bar...this is where to get the greatest service. Happy hour is the best thing going for this place. Where else can you get a Dog Fish Head 90 minute for less than $5? The food is great, I have never had anything I didn't like."}
{"text":"I still really  like this place. I love the gardein options and all the great happy hour drinks and food specials but that's when you need to come. During happy hour when it isn't super busy. We came here after a disastrous attempt at Hachi and ugh, we were let down. It's not their fault they are busy on Saturday night and have a 20 minute wait. I get that. What I don't get is the 5 tables we saw open while people were waiting. That gets annoying from a customer POV. Anyway, we get seated and place our order. I got the grilled cheese with tomato  bisque. I've had the bisque before and it is devine. Absolutely fantastic. The others in my party ordered sandwiches as well. I guess they made mine first and then put under the heat lamp because when it came out it was cold. Seriously. COLD. And the cheese wasn't melted. What good is a heat lamp????, since it's a pretty costly sandwich my brother asked for them to bring me a new one. So, I wait. And I wait. And wait some more. Finally,it comes out. Not grilled AT ALL and cheese still cold!!!!!! WTF? Waiter says he will bring me another one, I ask for original one back lol. It was grilled, as sandwich implies, but cold. He offers something else. At this point  we just want to go. they buy us dessert which was very nice and didnt charge me for the sandwich but I left extremely disappointed. I love this place.  I've always had fantastic service and great food. Tip: don't come Saturday night. I learned my lesson."}
{"text":"Pass on this location.
I've been here twice and both times it isn't what I've come to expect at Yard House.
This last time, the bartender made my upper manhattan with ZERO love. It was gross. 
Like undrinkable gross. I dont like having to ask for my drink to be altered. Make it right. I've had their upper manhattan's at 2 other locations and they are, in my opinion, one of the BEST drinks I've ever had (San Diego and Summerlin locations).
I've always enjoyed the food at Yard House and usually love the drinks. From now on, I'll stick with the Summerlin location. 
I suppose if you are a beer person, this is the place for you.
There are too many other places in Town Square I'd rather give my money to then here."}
{"text":"Come here a lot with my friends. I ordered the hot and spicy edamame to start with every time i come here. This time i got one of their burgers and i was pleased with my choice. Server was very attentive and easy to work with. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for drinks, had the best waiter ever. Ordered their chicken nachos and it filled up 3-4 people Lol!

I will keep coming here for drinks and food because they're both affordable. 

J out."}
{"text":"All my coworkers and I like to hang out often and this is mainly where we go every time. The prices are reasonable and when it's happy hour it's even better prices! Great food and service. When we go it's usually about 20+ people and the servers are on top of everything. It's a great place because it's not just a bar so coworkers under 21 can still come but for anyone who would like a drink it's perfect. Plus if anyone wants to stay later and drink the bar is right in the middle. Will always be a favorite."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Pretty good service. Our waitress moved a little bit slow, but they were slammed. I ordered the orange chicken with brown rice, and it was delightful; so flavorful and delicious! The lobster artichoke dip was superb. The swordfish street tacos were to die for. Definitely want to go back and try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Not very impressed. We went on a Friday night at 7pm and there was no wait - I know why, now. While the service was great the food was mediocre - it was cold and bland. My Mac n Cheese was OK, but I would choose Paradise Bakery's Mac n Cheese or Sauce's Mac n Cheese over this one any day. My husband and I both agree that we could have gone to The Keg for the same price and gotten something 100 times better. Bottom line is it is overpriced and overrated."}
{"text":"Took my family of 5 to lunch on 5.25.18. Seated in timely manner. Host great. Nearly 10 minutes to get water, requested lemons with water another 5 minutes. Ordered Apple juice took awhile. Opened napkin with silver wrapped in it napkin had dried food all over one corner, silverware was sent back for clean set up. Meals were good other than my wife's Pepperoni Pizza was terrible,  like cardboard. She never complains. I'm a person who feels if your going to Bitch you better praise. I do write reviews praising great service great food. Wish it were true at the Yard House, especially for the money spent for my daughters graduation. I'm always interested in seeing if anyone ever calls about reviews 702-860-2398. Thank you for your time,"}
{"text":"I've been to this yard house 3 or 4 times.  I think if I would have written a review the first or even second time, I would have given 4 stars... But, I just don't think it deserves that high of a rating...

The beer selection is fabulous.. Mostly because they have Triple Karmeliet.. my favorite :)  

The food is pretty darn decent too.  Great place to grab a steak and I am a huge fan of the hawiian pizza.  Good is good.

A little on the pricey side if you are planning to stay for awhile.. which is fine, but I don't like to have to spend 100 bucks for a diner and drinks for two.... especially when it's only a couple of drinks.. Boo on that.  Pretty much my only complaint.. I'll get over it though and go back soon I'm sure. :)

Oh, and one las thing, I love the music selection.. Always playing good tunes."}
{"text":"Like the Town Square location they've got an impressive beer selection and a diverse menu. The first time I stopped by last month the wait was ridiculous so I ended up leaving. But this past weekend I got a seat for lunch in no time. The food is decent all around. The moo shu egg rolls were tasty and the cuban pork sandwich was large and delicious. If you like the food and beer of the other locations, you'll like it here as well. Lots of HD TVs around the place and apparently lots of World Cup fans as there was a good sized contingent of Spanish supporters cheering as they beat Paraguay."}
{"text":"i don't drink, so this is a review purely on the food.  i had the blue crab cake hoagie (which is like a BLT with crab cakes).  bad idea!  it was the worst crab cake in the world, and it wasn't fresh!  it tasted like it was canned crab (which was probably what it was) that was sitting out too long in the heat for days.  it also had carrot chunks in it... what?
i had an order of the sweet potato fries, and it was nice that they drizzle honey on it, but not nice that it was over-fried and burnt."}
{"text":"Visited twice, my first was a week night after 8pm in May (table seating) and the 2nd approx. 7pm on 7/3 where the wait was approx. 30mins so we took the last 2 seats at the bar.  We were able to order from the full menu.  I opted for the summer salad (delicious) and my daughter the bbq pizza which she too enjoyed. We happened to have the same server from my prior visit.  The food was quick and the tasty.  The atmosphere was casually sophisticated (aside from the cackling chics down the bar from us).  I'll certainly return when for table seating when I have time to take my time and enjoy this restaurant.  Although, the gentlemen next to me received his burger incorrectly made twice... they were prompt to replace it and genuinely apologetic, comping his meal and offering him an appetizer to hold him over.  Their service is A+ in my book, but I'll have to try more items from the menu before I can give them 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Impressed by the number of great IPA's on tap. The place was clean, the environment was nice, and the service team did a great job. The food was great.

Since this is located in a busier area, wait times are a little lengthy. My buzzer never went off to let me know it was my turn to be sat so I ended up waiting an extra amount of time- I would recommend upgrading to a text-alert system like some other restaurants have done. The staff was more than apologetic for the technical issue and it was no big deal."}
{"text":"Totally dig this place.  The food was good, the beers were fantastic!  We tried about 15 different beers before we decided to stick with one.  The only downside for me was that during shift changes the service was totally crummy.  We sat at the bar and when our tender left, it was as though we were non-existent to the new bar tender that came on duty.  I'm just sayin'; empty beer glasses for over 15 mins is NOT a good thing.  Other than that, I do plan on going back and bringing several of my friends.  It's a great place!"}
{"text":"This place is always poppin and there is always a wait to get a table.  I usually try to avoid super crowded spots but this one really is worth the wait.  They have an amazing happy hour with over 100+ beers on tap!  Better yet is the food.  Everything I've tasted is simply to die for.  My favorite is the Lobster Garlic Noodles - huge chunks of lobster, crab, and shrimp - I couldn't ask for more!  The only thing preventing me for giving 5 stars is the wait... but it's constant max. capacity only affirms everything I just wrote."}
{"text":"Love it! Never disappointed.  Food is amazing.  Always have my favorite beer on tap. Friendly staff and great location."}
{"text":"The service was great.
Food was OK, could be better.
but good location."}
{"text":"Prepare for a salty meal. Nice ambience and fun Lind of place but food is mediocre. Service was good."}
{"text":"They have an awesome beer and cocktail selection. Went there for my birthday dinner and had a good time. Had their nitro beer which was really good. Drea was our server and she was really nice, had the pork burger (signature burger) and it lived up to it. My wife has the poki nachos and she moved them! Was refreshing and a good amount of food especially since it was an appetizer. Truffle fries are a must try! It can get busy so you might have to wait but it's worth it. There creme brule was amazing! Caramelized bananas on top was the kicker. We got there just as happy hour ended but we're nice enough to give us first round at happy hour price so that was very nice to see. Will be back to try more of their beers and more!"}
{"text":"Had to take the time to say what a pleasant surprise Yardhouse is! Wow. My first time to visit and our server Billy was so fun and helpful. His recommendation of the lamb burger was awesome. I'll be back"}
{"text":"3.5 and surprisingly good for a chain. Went here for a family brunch yesterday. We were a party of 15 and we probably all came at various times but the seating area they gave us was a tad awkward, split across three tables. Me and the hubby arrived last and kinda squished in.  
Hubby was in indecisive mode so I ordered two things thinking he could have some and then decide his own later. I got the Korean beef appetizer and the shiitake garlic noodles which were listed under snack. Sufficed to say both plates came out and we realized hubby def wouldn't need to order anything else! They def give you huuuge portions. 
The beef was well seasoned although a tad chewy. It came on a bed of rice and had pickled carrots and diakon and sautéed greens. I was surprising more impressed with the noodles. Hubby don't care for them much but I thought these were delish! Almost buttery... garlicy and mushroomy goodness. A great meatless option if you need one. 
Oh and we got some drinks; I got the refresher , and he got the el picante marg. Mine was as it's name would suggest very refreshing!! But hubby's was the star imo. It was peppery n spicy, salt rimmed and sugary in a perfect blend! I declare all margs I get now should come with a charred jalapeños!! 
Oh at some point we also had some of a pineapple cider... it was verrry pineappley and the hubby loved it. Lastly we ended with what I would say was the weakest point, a creme brûlée for dessert. I know right?! How could that be??
Well they put banana slices on top and brûlée those. I like bananas don't get me wrong but I think the two side pieces would have been sufficient and it lacked the nice crust I wanted because the actual creme did not get torched at all."}
{"text":"About the best thing I can say about the food at Yard House at the Red Rock Casino is that they have a very good beer menu! If you like bar food, the Yard House has an extensive menu of offerings, but everything we recently tried was less than mediocre.  There are much better bar food restaurants out there....

Our party of four shared two appetizers:

Fried calamari, which was the worse fried calamari I've ever had.  Overcooked and with absolutely no seasoning, it was bland, dry and disgusting. 

Lobster, crab and artichoke dip with chips and pita, which had an unusual flavor, not quite crab dip and not quite artichoke, and lost somewhere in the middle. Pretty bad....one taste was enough for me. 

For entrees we tried:

Steak sandwich, which had a very tough and flavorless cut of beef in a bun filled with fried straw onions. Awful.

Turkey pot pie, which had an undercooked pastry crust and served in a dish that seemed as big as a wagon wheel. Way too much food although it was filled with tasty chunks of turkey and veggies. Not bad, not good, but edible. 

Crunchy Ahi Salad, which had decent quality Ahi that was seared quite nicely.  This was the best dish we received. 

Fish and chips, which were greasy and sort of bland. Edible but not a lot going for it.

Service was good, and again the beer was great.  The waiter removed the calamari from the bill after I told him it was tasteless. 

We won't be back, except maybe for a beer."}
{"text":"Eat here like twice a week it's ritual now.. had my first date with my fiance there and look at us now..still co ming back for more and if ur budgeting there reverse happy hour is always great!"}
{"text":"I am not normally a fan of the Yard House but I was really impressed by this location.  Devin, our server was awesome and really made our experience a great one.  I ate lunch here with my bf's family, a party of 11 and she was able to accommodate our large group effortlessly.  My bf and I split the hot chicken sandwich and it was delicious!  Seasoned well with coleslaw and cheddar cheese.  It makes me want to give the Yard House back at home another try."}
{"text":"No salad- no beer.
I guess we came on the day before they get their deliveries??  
The service was slow and our server was unapologetic for the lack of menu items we wanted.  The sushi was not fresh and the truffle fries were greasy.
This place is always busy, but they need to step it up on their quality of food."}
{"text":"Great service! Even point out restrooms when you come in. Server Becca was wonderful. Made recommentdstions. We loved everuthing we had including the Cherry Limeaids.  Thanks Becca, I'm a huge fan. Will definitely be back on this visit."}
{"text":"Food. Was. Amazing! Service was great, too. We made a reservation before going because restaurants in Vegas always have a wait. We were late for the reservation and they still seated us really quickly. I hate chain restaurants and this one was far from it!"}
{"text":"Yardhouse NEVER disappoints! Always have the best service whether we are sitting at the bar or a table. You are constantly seeing managers walking around assuring that you are happy with your service and experience. Even the kitchen staff which you can see with their open kitchen layout looks well staffed and are always on top of their game! The menu and food here is so worth every penny! And of course the beers never disappoint! I've brought my dad here from Florida who loved it, meet friends here and go on date night quite often here as well. There's a reason why there's usually a wait at busy times because this place rocks! Keep up the great work yardhouse! We will be back very soon! If you haven't been yet go check them out! The entire staff won't disappoint !"}
{"text":"Las Vegas, man. Every now and then, a guy has to go hang out in one of these mafia money warehouses and roll the bones a few times. Vegas has changed a bit over the decades. Where it used to be that a guy went there for unspeakable indulgences, now he might take a family. Whatever. The deal is that, today, Las Vegas doesn't just jack your billfold at the ol' one-armed bandit, they take a chunk outta your backside with everything, everywhere. 

But, I ain't here to disrespect ol' Sin City. I'm just here to throw out a hint for some of the folk who want to get a little more bang for the buck. Listen. We all know The Lord threw the yoke on us and tasked us to plow the dirt outside the garden gates, right? When we earn a dollar, it takes a lot more than a dollar's effort. That's why you gotta be smart when you got a handful of lettuce. 

I know what your thinkin'... If a guy has money issues, why ever visit Vegas? Well, sometimes a guy is asked to do some work that puts him in expensive places. What can I tell you? Simmer down and keep reading.

This is where the Yard House, just off the Strip, can help your wallet out. Yard House is one of those chain restaurants. It's owned by the same dudes that own Olive Garden. But, hey! This ain't no Olive Garden. I won't even review an Olive Garden. 

Yard House Vegas is a pretty nice joint. It is a nice, big dining room with air conditioning, full bar, and decent food. One big detail about Yard House is that they typically have very good service. In fact, I have never had anything other than excellent attention at YH. Yard House Vegas has standard menu pricing, so it is about the same here as it is in any other town. That's a welcome relief from the casino concourse restaurants that hand you a wallet whoopin' like 30 minutes at the Texas Hold 'Em. 

Just look for the High Roller, the giant Ferris wheel on the strip. The Yard House is in the shadow.  

And, listen. I just saved you one Andrew Jackson, here. Be cool with the wait staff. Imagine the freak show they gotta deal with every day. I can assure you they ain't livin' the dream out there in the desert. Make it worth their while. Slide your spinach over to the sure bet, and help another human being out. Maybe your dollar will let 'em win big and get that ticket out of Sin City and into God's Country. Be a saint!

{"text":"Great food, Great service. First time ever there, very much surprised how good it was. Daniel was our server who did a super great job. Ask for him when you are there, you won't be disappointed. We will be back."}
{"text":"We had the Yard House's Korean Short Rib tacos  at the Arizona Taco Festival and were very impressed so we decided to come here for lunch before heading to a movie (restaurant is very conveniently located close to the theaters).    My husband ordered the Korean Tacos and really enjoyed them with a side of truffle fries.    I had the Kale Caesar with salmon which was unremarkable.    The restaurant is large and was not very busy on a Saturday at lunch.  The service was acceptable."}
{"text":"Love this place, great beer selection, appetizers are as big as full meals and staff are friendly and attentive. Great place to stop after work. Happy hour could be a bit more generous but oh well."}
{"text":"We had a movie at 8:00pm.  Walked in at 6:35pm and were told there would be a 15-20 minutes wait.  The wait ended up being right on the money and we were seated outside.  The waitress was awesome and even with the 4 billion beers they have on tap they didn't have any Leinenkugel (grr... If this was Wisconsin that would earn a 1 star rating).  She suggested some similar ones.  We mentioned we had an 8:00 movie and she helped us get out quickly.  We made our 8:00 movie had had a great dinner along with great service (minus the lack of beer from the North Woods... Wisconsin people will understand)."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great music, atmsophere, and great bang for your buck! Thanks Veronica and Jordan for a great evening!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Yard House in the valley. I frequent it often as I work at the stadiums in the area. The outside seating has changed in the past year unfortunately. There used to be more comfy chairs and couches making meeting new people easy and fun. There are only two couches left. They have followed suit with the Desert Ridge location and put hardwood tables and chairs outside :(
Their food and service far surpasses any Yard House in the valley. No snobbery here. The staff and mgt. aim to please. Favorite appetizer: Ahi Poke Bowl. They have the best sweet potato and Parmesan truffle fries as well."}
{"text":"Menu is plenty big yet the food is pretty consistent.  Happy hour is short but good and lunch has never disappointed.  Oh did I mention they have beer?"}
{"text":"Yard House seems to be a good place to meet a group of people because of their huge menu, beer selection, and atmosphere conducive to talking... this location can get crowded, so depending on when you go, be prepared to wait.

I'm typically not so much into chain restaurants but I've been to Yard House more than a handful of times and it's pretty consistent so I don't mind going every once in a while... the thing is, I now have a favorite item on the menu, it's the miso glazed sea bass.  When we went the other night, they were out... bummer!

Our server was fine- not the most friendly, but took decent care of us.  We were a party of 6, and I wasn't the only one planning on ordering the seabass... my aunt and I were both disappointed, but what can you do?  I ended up with the shrimp and vegetable terriyaki bowl and my aunt went with the tuna tartar appetizer and edamame.  Others at the table had the scallops, the turkey burger, a steak salad, and scallop entree... Few of us were drinking that night, but we managed to have a good meal.

The manager, Clem, came over to apologize for being out of seabass - that was appropriate; obviously, we knew it wasn't his fault, but the gesture was nice.  

In thinking about writing this review, I have to say that I lingered between 3 and 4 stars... I ended up giving just 3 because the Yard House has become just another chain restaurant in my eyes... nothing special, the same thing every time, just plain old average!

Sure, I'll be back for group meals, but I won't be rushing over on my own or on a date anytime soon. Go for a beer, go to watch a game, go to listen to some classic rock and have an average meal... and if you like seabass and it's in stock, go for it!"}
{"text":"The manager kicked us out because my husband was having an asthma attack and cursed when he was ordering his food, even though he didn't direct it towards the waiter. WORST SERVICE EVER. He claims we were drunk when none of us were drunk, nor ordering drinks, so apparently minority money is not allowed in this restaurant. I tried explaining this to the manager who VERY rudely told me to \"get out of his restaurant\" ZERO STARS"}
{"text":"Living down in Sierra vista 2 years killed me knowing that there is a few yard houses couple hundred miles north. 

They have the BOMBEST onion rings than any other place I've been to! I think there batter is laced with crack. I can eat a entire tower by myself there that good. Though I wouldn't recommend it since your stomach won't like you if you start pounding down all that beer they have with it.

Food there is on the high side but it's worth it. Havnt ordered anything that didn't taste like it came out of a freezer bag. You wont be disappointed. 

Every time I come here I always start with there sampler pack which consists of 6 beers they choose for the month. Your bound to find something that you will like. 

Seriously don't come here and order a bud light or a corona. I mean really im sure there are people that just won't try anything new but really though... There will be something you will love just as much if not even better than your pre existing favorite. 

There is usually a tall guy with a beard working the bar every time I come here. He has been here since it opened ad he will find something to quench your thirst :)

If your like me and have a few to many of those half yards and feel like you may have had a few to much. Dont be a dummy and drive off so the scottsdale PD can give you a DUI. Big no no! then just go walk it off in the fashion square mall."}
{"text":"Fabulous food and fabulous servous.  I also love the atmosphere.  This is one fun place to eat.  It is always crowded.  I think that says it all.  I usually go the the restaurant at Town Square.  You will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place was nice. Came here tonight for a friends birthday. The atmosphere was cool. The food was delicious, I had the Lobster garlic noodles. Nice size portion. Sarah was our hostess. She was excellent she kept our drinks flowing and was always insight. Very polite and upbeat attitude. She always carried a smile on her face. My friends asked her to take pictures for us of us and she happily did so even with one hand being she had plates in the other 

This was on a Tuesday night and the place was packed. I can just imagine on a weekend how this place turns out. I'll stick to a weekday anytime. It's located at the Townsquare mall right off the strip. Very nice location and not hard to find. Very clean and tvs all over. Although you really don't pay attention to the screen with a big party involved like tonight. But it's nice to know you have options. 

They have a huge menu. From a long list of appetizers to a full on entree menu. Food for the whole family to enjoy. Lots of drinks as well. Kids are welcome. The prices are....about right for the quantity and quality of food you receive. Parking is free and relatively close to the restaurant. I'd definitely come back and enjoy this experience again."}
{"text":"I don't normally review chain restaurants, but there is a certain dish that I need to share with you, Yelpers.  It's the Poke Nachos.  They're life changing.  But take note that it's a hot dish because it's topped with jalapeño rings.  It comes with a very generous portion of fresh, seasoned poke, diced avocado chunks, and wonton nachos (so perfect)!  If you're a fan of Poke you'll know that when paired with avocado, it's very refreshing and light... but those wonton nachos do so well at complementing the dish.

I haven't been in the US for a while, so I just came here recently and noticed this gem on their happy hour menu.  Thanks, Yard House, for making your happy hour EVEN BETTER!  Yard House service and taste, at any location, is always on point, in my opinion.  Any meal time is great here, but if you can't already tell, the happy hour is one of my favorites- don't miss out!

PS. Super cool place for beer drinkers!"}
{"text":"I always come back. Top stuff (especially on happy hour) 
-moo shoo egg rolls 
-chicken nachos 
Those are the bomb! 
Good service too!"}
{"text":"I went to Yardhouse at the end of March with a large group for a birthday dinner. I had no enthusiasm for the place, since I've been before a few times and have never been impressed. This time, I ordered the tacos (not vampire-style, that will be next), which were quite good, for this kind of place. Next time, I would skip their rice and beans. They were just ok.  A lot of us had trouble with our food being served cold, and the waiter brought out a manager to help. They fixed the problem and brought out replacements at the right temperature. They were obviously very busy that night and it took a long time to get our food, but the server was attentive and polite. They get one extra star for variety and solid vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Love yard house!! Their happy hour is where it's at!! 3-6pm apps between $6-$8 chicken nachos, lettuce wraps, calamari, Margherita pizza, etc. they have a ton of apps to choose from and a great selection of drafts and cocktails to choose from. Same vibe in each location. Huge restaurant, friendly staff, lots of tv's to watch sports on. Love it. We make sure we always hit up yard house anytime we're traveling. Great for kids, families, couples, large groups, partying, etc."}
{"text":"Went to the Yard House tonight with friends and I am sure I got food poisoning. I did not eat anything anywhere else but there. I got home a few hours later and felt extremely sick and am nauseated. I am also having the worst stomach issues ever! Although service was good I will not be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"Yard House consistently serves up a wide variety of good food, and of course, has a huge selection of fresh beers on tap.  If I'm in the mood for beers I can't find anywhere else, this is the only place to go. 

Unfortunately this location is small and always too crowded.  Ive never managed to go there and not have at least a short wait to be seated, then slow food delivery since it's just packed.  And sometimes it's just full of sports nuts being loud since it's next to a stadium.  I'll probably avoid this location in the future, although I love the Yard House chain overall."}
{"text":"Yard house always offers an awesome variety of food and drinks. Today we got the nachos and we had the local six-pack samplers which was a great deal for the price. Number one, two, three, four and five were really good. We didn't care for 6, but it's because we aren't IPA drinkers. The nachos are huge and never disappoint. We love The Yard House and will be back many more times to come."}
{"text":"I really like this place now. It's changed hands a few times and I think this is the best so far. I work right across the street and come for lunch sometimes. 

They have your typical fav selection of wings, burgers, sandwiches and salads. 

The wings are huge. I usually get the chicken salad croissant. It's pretty dang good and comes with fries. Excellent fries.  

I wish bottled domestics were a hair cheaper but it's not that bad currently really."}
{"text":"Great food, great beers, great for vegetarians, and lots of hot servers! Yum."}
{"text":"An alcoholic beer at 1pm you say? Sure, it's Vegas! 
Came here after doing some shopping. I'm 90% please with my Yardhouse experiences in Los Angeles. But this Vegas location took the cold.

There was a football game going on.. USC against I forgot (but obviously not important to the likes of USC), and enough seats to go around. 
Wasn't hungry even though the people around me eating some pretty damn good-looking food.

I was here for the drinks. Do people really drink this early in the day? Hell yes!
There is probably one drink that I look forward to the most. Not many people know it, and very few bartenders can make it to perfection.

And it's called the 'LA Water.\" 
Soon as I mentioned the name, bartender smiled and handed a glass of one of the best LA Water's I've had. Guess it was a hot day, 'cause I started drinking one after another like nothing. Bartender gave a chuckle and said \"...drinking it down like water.\" 
So yes, I was satisfied. Watched the game (USC won of course), burped and tipped the guy $10. I was feeling generous!

Must come back to Vegas just to come back here again."}
{"text":"Let me just start out with that fact that the food here is amazing! Everyone at the table loved their food (except my brother who is 11 and was sick, so he hardly counts) 
We started off with the truffle fries which were to die for and then were gone in a few seconds. :) For dinner I got the coconut shrimp and the spicy tuna roll because they were on the appetizer menu and I assumed that they would be small portions. Instead they were massive and I couldn't even finish them all. They were amazing and I would suggest them to anyone. It was classic flashy Vegas food :) I loved every bite. 

It was a little bit loud, but it's Vegas so it wasn't like I didn't expect it and there was a slightly long wait to get in which was just frustrating. 

The staff were nice for the most part and very accommodating. Overall it was a positive experience.

Make time for the Yard House!"}
{"text":"Food and service is great and the best bar staff in town!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I are always here. We usually come here when they have their happy hour. Its worth it and i love this place."}
{"text":"We started off our Vegas trip with a lunch here and had one of the best experiences we could have imagined. Our server, Frank, if I remember correctly, gave us such amazing service. He recommended a whole bunch of different beers and when we couldn't decide, brought out some samples for us to try multiple times. 

The food wasn't anything spectacular but it was good and did the trick. For the price though, it was fantastic. If you're here for lunch, definitely get the lunch special. 

At the end of our meal, Frank brought out a birthday dessert for my boyfriend. We were pleasantly surprised and it was nice that he remembered that little fact from the beginning of our conversations, even though it was a few days away. 

To top it all off, he brought us some to go cups of water to keep hydrated on our walk along the strip. All servers need to meet his standard!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and am underwhelmed. The food is ok. There is nothing I've tried I'd get again. It's loud and supposedly trendy. Save your money and go somewhere you can hear the person sitting next to you."}
{"text":"So I will start by saying I'm definitely a yard house fan and have been here too many times to count, however, over the past year I feel like the quality of the food has gone from 5 star to 4 and I'll explain why.

First about 6-9 months ago they changed there fries and if you read reviews everyone always loved the small fries and then you could make them truffle and they were bomb.com but now there fries are nothing more than the same thing you would find at your local jack in the box. Next is they have changed the happy hour menu so some of the favorites are no longer on their like noodles and bone in wings and a few other items . These changes kinda hurt my feelings a little lol

Now on to the good! They still have a lot of items on happy hour and just recently they changed it to half off the happy hour menu vs having a tiered pricing which is nice. The portion size of all their food is good and the pricing is fair , also they are a full brewery so you can get your drink on and be happy. Another thing I like is the atmosphere, it's casual with a lot of tv's so you can go catch a game or have a date night or even just grab a snack before you head to the club, This place meets every criteria . My favorites are the carnivore pizza and the sliders, and I like to order a onion ring tower and add the onion rings to my slider so I kinda create my own slider lol."}
{"text":"Vegas had previously surprised us with its poor service...until we went to Yard House. Tre was wonderful and provided by far the best service we have ever received. The food was delicious with large portions, the cocktails were great also! The manager was very much on the ground, helping staff and providing a friendly face to customers ( she even cleared our plates). A fantastic night!"}
{"text":"Just got back from a dinner here with my girlfriend and while things started out nice, they were pretty bad by the end.

We arrived and they were moderately busy.  We were seated quickly though and our server, Kerry G, arrived quickly and was very personable and quick to come back to us for ordering.  My girlfriend got a cheeseburger and fries and the Hawaiian Five O drink, I got the vampire tacos dish and asked for no guacamole, and we split an order of boneless buffalo wings.

The wings came pretty quick and our server even brought over some extra ranch.  As far as the taste goes, they were OK.  Not the best I've had and not the worst.  The sauce was decent but with only a burst of heat up front and I'm not quite a fan of either the breading or how they fried them -- not sure which.  My girlfriend really liked her Hawaiian Five O drink.

Then began a long wait for our entrees.  We noted that a table of 4 right next to us ordered at the same time and got their food far before us.  A few minutes after they got their food Kerry came over to us and told us our food was cooking and would be out soon, then asked if we were in any type of time crunch.  We said no, thinking we still had 40 minutes to make a movie at the AMC theater upstairs.

10 minutes or so after this our food finally arrived and Kerry noted that they had tried to give him the tacos with guacamole on it.  I surmise they made the order wrong the first time and he just never told us about it until then.

My girlfriend liked her burger but didn't care for the fries.  I tried them and thought they were pretty good, however.  My tacos were very ho-hum.  They were carnitas and bacon chorizo with cilantro in a cheese-crusted taco shell.  Cilantro dominated the tacos, however, and I could barely taste the carnitas and only got one bite where I clearly detected the bacon chorizo.  The rice on the side was the best part of the meal -- a good portion of it, slightly sweet and spicy.  Something I've never really had with tacos but it was good.  The beans were very bland and a surprisingly small portion.

Kerry came to check on us again, but at the end of the meal we ended up waiting at least 10 minutes for the check while Kerry was in the vicinity and I met his eyes several times.  Even after he finally came over and we told him we wanted the check it took another 3 or 4 minutes to get it.  Finally we were able to pay and leave but it was over an hour after we first arrived and we missed the showtime for the movie.

Good service at the start, bad service at the end, and food that ranged from average to bleh."}
{"text":"We came for HP and it was incredible! You get a lot of food for the Happy Hour prices. So many beers to choose from - I absolutely loved the Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat Beer. Never been to a YardHouse but will def come again"}
{"text":"Yard House is an awesome spot to suit for decent food and some drinks, especially during happy hour. As packed as it gets, you'll always be greeted with friendly staff that usually tries to seat you as fast as they can. During my visit, they said it would be a 10-15 minute wait but only waited ariuhdb5 minutes.

There are TVs almost everywhere you look inside this restaurant. Great place to watch the game. I haven't asked before if I could change the channel to a specific game, but I would hope they would be able to!"}
{"text":"this is a chain, and one where each of them is really hard to differentiate from another one...walking into a yard house is sort of like a deja vu experience where you've been there before, as if, a dream upon waking...

...now- Yard House is great if you have some coin to spend on the food and drink.
the saying- \"you get what you pay for.\"
great to use as an example for this place.
it may get pricey, but you are paying for great service, good selection, and top-notch taste."}
{"text":"I had family visiting from out of town who wanted to check out The Linq. After calling several other restaurants in the area, the wait was either too long or no reservations were available. I called Yardhouse feeling somewhat defeated and the gentleman asked how far away I was and when I responded he quickly put me on the call ahead list and said to go ahead and check in when we arrived. I was greeted by many pleasant hosts and was sat with my party right away. Our server took great care of us. We ordered Moscow Mules, beer flights, queso, salads, steak, Parmesan crusted chicken and orange chicken. The items were all delicious! Everything was served in great time and full of flavor. We were very happy with the service, drinks and food and even as locals it was worth the drive to visit this Yardhouse on the Strip."}
{"text":"Grabbed a bite here this afternoon for some delicious lunch and beer! 
Their lunch combos are a good size and bang for your buck. They carry some brews from Joseph James which I appreciate as a local. 
We sat at the bar and the girl taking care of us was pretty inconsistent and we ended up having another bartender take care of us halfway through our meal but he was great. 

Yardhouse has a such a huge menu with a wide variety of gluten free, vegetarian and vegan options anyone and everyone can eat here and enjoy it!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I ate here by myself and sat at the bar and had such a great experience. The service is what really stuck out to me. The bartenders were so nice and funny.

I ordered a margarita and the Cobb Salad. The Cobb salad was very unique. It had greens, kale, tomatoes, edamame, carrots, radish, egg, bleu cheese, corn, bacon, avocado, ranch. It was priced at $10.95 so not too bad for a nice part of town. They have a variety of different types of dishes which are very healthy but sound very tasty. 

The overall atmosphere was loud and fun. They have lots of TVs if you want to catch a game. Outside the day I was there, about 15 Corvettes were parked, so that was fun to see."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday night so I knew it would be busy and we wouldn't get a lot of time with our server.  We didn't even get her name or options for some of our food which ended up making my sandwich kinda gross.  The sweet potato fries were good though and my bf's burger was pretty good."}
{"text":"The service at the bar always has a rude demenar..i almost feel like I was bothering the rude chick behind the bar..never again.."}
{"text":"Food is always good, great service, and fun atmosphere. I have been here a few times and it's always good. Great selection of food and beers. 

I love their tortilla soup. I went here with my family for my birthday and they brought out a free dessert and wrote happy birthday which was really nice."}
{"text":"Went in for a friends birthday tonight! This place is always extremely busy and they don't take reservations so be prepared to wait. Luckily we had friends who got their early to get us a table. Service was great. We had 2 servers for the party of 13. Very prompt with refills, super friendly, and took great care of us. 

We started with the Korean beef which was so tender and great flavor. Highly recommend!  I got the small BBQ chicken salad and it was amazing! Plenty big in size and tons of ingredients. My fiancé got the pepper jack burger and that was good as well. 

They brought out a fun small dessert that said happy birthday for the birthday girl which was sweet. They don't sing but we did anyway! I will be back but probably on an off peak hour so that way there is no wait. Overall recommend. Great service, food, and prices."}
{"text":"Never been to a yard house before so this was my first and I'm so glad I came. I am not a big beer drinker but no joke, this place has everything! Every single kind of beer you would want in any type of size too. We had the truffle fries to share and it was amazing!! Seriously! I ordered the thai chicken salad noodle and that was not great. I would have gone safe with a burger or maybe a real salad instead."}
{"text":"Had a house pale, ribs with creamed corn & beans. Ribs were fantastic and I haven't had creamed corn in a long time, but theirs was the best I have ever had. Great meal and service.

Their fries are shoestring which are ok but burger wasn't very great."}
{"text":"Well....I have to be honest that I'm not a fan of chains.  This being said, my wife and I were celebrating our anniversary (without the kids) on Memorial Day, and the patio looked very inviting.  When we sat down, we were welcomed by Nicole who was a true pleasure (even thought it was a holiday).  She asked us if we're celebrating a special occasion, and we said yes to our anniversary.  The deviled eggs and lettuce wraps were delicious, and our lunch size salads were creative, huge, and tasty!  Throughout our meal Nicole continued to refresh my ice tea without me asking, and she gave us just enough conversation.  At the end, she surprised us with a beautiful dessert (pic attached).  We were both pleasantly surprised, and grateful to Nicole for remembering our celebration.  She is a terrific server, and a huge asset to the Yard House team.  We look forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"*sigh* What happened to you guys? =( I'm so bummed out right now, I used to adore this spot. Great service, yummy drinks, tasty food and lots of choices...ugh, now a thing of the past I guess.

Our office ordered Yard House through Delicious Deliveries for our sales meeting and it was absolutely awful. I ordered the mac & cheese and if I didn't know any better, I would say that the food was cooked last week.  It wasn't even on par with next-day leftovers. The noodles were weirdly chewy, the smell was uninviting (how do you make garlic smell bad??!), I don't think there was any cheese, the bacon was squishy, there was some large grey-toned pieces in it and I'm still not sure if it was meat or if it was some weird looking mushroom thingy. If I didn't know any better, I would think that this was some sort of prank, but I don't see Ashton Kutcher anywhere and we are two weeks past the statute of limitations on pulling an April Fool's goof. 

Not impressed and not ordering it again."}

{"text":"Yard House has been updated to a 5 star, after several visits helped to elevate it to one of the best overall restaurants on the west end.

The most recent visit was after a disastrous experience at the Gordon Biersch down the street (See Review). I am willing to admit that my disgust with GB's could have influenced this particular visit to Yard House, but after all, the right time and the right place are also factors by which we develop opinions.

I had two items off the happy-hour appetizer menu, the Seared Ahi Tuna and the Spicy Tuna Roll.

The bartender kindly warned me that the Spicy Tuna Roll was presented in a completely different manor than I was probably used to, offering my a bit of his personal insight to allow me an opportunity to rethink my decision. But I am a culinary warrior with the self-proclaimed fortitude that has catapulted me toward some of the worlds greatest food discoveries - and I was not about to be deterred by unconventionalism.

The presentation was unusual, to say the least. But this work of art was visionary delight, in a castle of tuna, a delightfully mild wasabi sauce and a number of items I wont embarrass myself trying to identify. It was almost too beautiful to want to breach the walls of this incredible castle, but the urge to sample its goods was too tempting. I can say, although its taste resembled a spicy tuna roll in many ways, it uniqueness made it truly a one of a kind item.

The Seared Ahi Tuna, which I had had before, was delicious as always and its presentation rivaled that of its chivalrous brother.

I am truly blessed to be within a stones throw of Yard House. I suggest you stop in some time - you might just see me there."}
{"text":"I had the Gardien Orange Chicken and added extra vegetables. It was to fantastic and was a large enough portion to have left overs. 

My husband ordered the meat orange chicken and said he would have liked more vegetables. 

My mother had the Gardien chicken and avocado sandwiches and she absolutely loved it . 
My mother choose this even though she eats meat. 

My father had the Jambalaya and was not a fan.

The patio was comfortable for dinner even in the triple digit heat thanks to the misters."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place ! There is something here for everyone. They have an entire vegetarian/vegan portion of the menu! I highly recommend getting their Gardien orange \"chicken\" add peppers broccoli and carrots. It is super filling so expect leftover or come hungry. I would recommend in this beautiful weather asking to sit on the patio it is wonderful!"}
{"text":"It took 10 minutes for someone to approach our table but when they did he was friendly. Ordered the chicken nachos as an appetizer and although they were huge, the chicken was bland and had no flavor. My wife ordered a plain cheeseburger cooked medium which came out fine, my bbq bacon cheeseburger which I ordered medium rare was at best medium well. Both of or burgers were okay, nothing special. The best thing about or time there was the beer of course, ordered a half yard which was interesting but a bit award to drink from. I will probably go back again to give out another chance, seems like I was just there on a bad night food and service wise"}
{"text":"We've gone in a few times either for dinner or lunch, we always seem to miss half price happy hour though... maybe next time........ I like the crab cakes and calamari, we had great service, Im sure we'll be back for more........."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the Yard House in any city we visit. The upscale beer bar boasts more taps than most and unique to the local you are in. 

Although they have the usual suspects, each city adds more local brews. So if you can't work your way around the area's brewing companies, you can sample a couple there. For that alone, I remain a fan.

This time, we weren't very hungry so decided to ordered the grilled cheese and tomato soup combo. Truly a nice looking and upscale version of the comfort food favorite.

I'm a fan of Yard house and you really need to sit at the bar, for the full experience - so many beers on tap, so few hours in the day..."}
{"text":"A fantastic establishment with both creative and signature dining experiences.  An excellent drink selection of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, and friendly courteous staff.  

I can't say enough good things about this establishment.  I have eaten there half a dozen times already and have been more impressed with each meal."}
{"text":"I love the food, drink selection, and atmosphere of the Yard house.  I could rate it 5-stars on those criteria alone, but location and food do not a restaurant make.  There are two issues with the service:

The first is that the restaurant can get uncomfortably packed at times, especially nights and weekends.  Using the bathroom can occasionally be a nightmare, as you might get stuck 1/2 way.  This feels like partly a layout issue, partly a flow issue, and partly a hosting issue.

The restaurant needs to open up some space on the bathroom side.  Servers and food runners need to establish guidelines on how to move through it without obstructing it constantly, and hosts need to ensure parties sat there are the appropriate size and not adding chairs to the ends of tables (this happens often, I wouldn't be mentioning it if it just happened 1-2x).  

The second issue seems to be turnover related.  I'm good at remembering people, even those I barely interact with.  I know the restaurant industry is famous for this, but when I was going there frequently I almost never saw the same staff member twice.  It's possible there's a massive staff, I suppose - but how many bartenders can there be, a dozen?  I used to go for a drink before a movie once a week, and I honestly never saw the same bartender twice.

This is coupled with their staff occasionally flubbing the menu.  Either calling something by a different name, not clarifying, etc. this has twice resulted in the wrong thing coming to the table, which I promptly send back.  Maybe it's a new-menu-too-often deal, too much turnover, I can't say.  But it happens too often for it to just be a one-off/unlucky customer kind of deal.

Edit - I noticed this establishment has a $$ rating.  In my opinion, this is probably a little under noted.  Some of these dishes, the ones including seafood or other exotic ingredients, can easily run up your bill quickly.  It's worth it, but the $$ can be a little deceiving, it should really be 2.5 $'s (if that's possible)."}
{"text":"It had been years since I had been to yard house and once I saw the menu and amount of beers on tap I was excited to try it out. I ordered a cider and my boyfriend ordered a house IPA. After waiting about 10 minutes, They brought out a house white? And we said no that's what he ordered and the food server said well that's what it said. Anyways the waitress came over and sorted it out and brought us the IPA we actually ordered. I ordered the French onion soup and my boyfriend ordered vegetable and rice stir fry. His hardly had any rice, strictly vegetables and was swimming in stir fry sauce. My French onion soup was super salty and lacking flavor other than that. Wasn't impressed at all. Not worth the pricey penny either."}
{"text":"I've been to Yard House before but not the Linq location. Looking for a bite to eat, and to warm up, we stopped in before our show at the Mirage.
The place is much bigger than it looks from the outside and we were seated right away. With a large menu selection we ordered a few appetizers to share to so we can taste a few items.
 -Poke Stack  marinated raw ahi, crispy wontons, avocado, wasabi soy sauce. I nice lite dish but very flavorful. I wanted to order a second one, maybe a return trip instead
- Lobster, Crab and artichoke dip. Served with pita slices and chips. Another decent option. Too much bread and chips, wish the portion of dip was larger.
-French Onion Soup. Suprisingly good. Most places that offer this soup have it swimming in salt or overloaded with onions, This was seasoned perfectly and kept the onions minimal per our request."}
{"text":"Review for the food. It was ok nothing out of this world. I had the ahi sliders with a side ceasar salad. The sliders were good, had decent flavors and the salad was ..a cesear salad..so ya know. I wwould go here again to eat but i'm looking forward to going back and having some brews. they have like 100 on tap so it seems like a coll place to throw a few back."}
{"text":"Never disappointed when I come here!!! Literally every item I've had, I've loved! Bonus... The variety of beers are amazing!!! Here's what went down for dinner tonight!!
My beau and I ordered:

- spinach crab dip 
- firecracker wings
- surf n turf burger
- Bahn mi pork belly sandwich
*watermelon wheat beer
*bacon Bloody Mary w/ beer shooter 

Spinach crab dip comes out nice and hot, nice balance of spinach and crab not too fishy like some are. Comes with warm pita bread and chips. I order this every time I visit!!!
First time for the firecracker wings.. Yummy!!! Sweet and a little bit of spicy, but not too much, and had a nice cilantro flavor as well. Crunchy and not soggy. You haveto try these!!!
Beau had his favorite surf n turf burger, medium done, topped with lobster and a side of shoestring fries and bearnaise sauce. Burger is delicious! Shoestring fries annoy me because they're too skinny, but they were perfectly seasoned and crunchy. Not a big fan of bearnaise, but went well with the burger. 
Pork belly Bahn mi was so tasty!!! It came with a side of naked coleslaw with lime (forgettable) but the pork belly was nicely charred and flavorful and a bit sweet. The Vietnamese sandwich came together with a nice radish, carrot- slaw with cucumber and mint on top a ham spread (really good!) and a light citrus sauce. DELICIOUS!!

My watermelon wheat beer was nice and smooth, not sweet nor bitter, but perfect and the bacon Bloody Mary tasted like bacon and since we like it spicy, was extra savory! Not sure what to do with the beer shooter.. We just added it in! 

My visit to yard house red rock location is always superb, service is friendly and prompt, and am always left satisfied. Thank you Ariandia for you service!!! 5 star all day long!!!!"}
{"text":"Service is quick
Food is mediocre at best

We arrived early after a trade show for dinner 6:30 ish. Plenty of open tables on patio yet we were seated in a corner. Asked to be moved to table closer near pedestrian path and was told it was going to be used by a larger party.   3 min later they sat 1 person there.   Asked the hostess what happened and clueless......


Ordered Korean bbq app...ok, fatty but like sauce. 

1/2 slab of ribs...tough, sides were cold
Angle hair pasta....no flavor 

My 2 cents....other than wide selection of beer, skip this place for food."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, awesome food, and pretty good desserts....Love their Ahi Poke Stack, Onion Ring Tower, and their Mac and Cheese with Truffle Oil is the bomb! I lik to finish off with the Kona Mocha Sundae....Awesome that they have one in Red Rock now, don't have to go to the strip.....ALOHA!!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to swing by the Yard House on North Tatum on a Saturday afternoon on a whim - and I can't be happier with our trip. We were there for happy hour and took advantage of the inexpensive prices on pints and appetizers. Our server was polite and very accommodating with us. I'll let you know, their beer list is ENORMOUS. We took our time, tried a couple of samples with our server's help, and had some interesting brews and a plate of nachos that could have easily fed 4. 
If you're a beer drinker- hell, even if you're not- check out the Yard House and check out their insane happy hour deals."}
{"text":"Solid staple here in the desert. Nothing particularly memorable, but nothing that will really turn you off.  Share some nachos and sweet potato fries. Can't go wrong with a burger.  People like the edamame, and I can't dispute it.  Good choice before a movie, or after work.  GREAT place for large groups.  Loud and crazy here on a Friday or Saturday night...even lunch can feel like a party.  Not a place I'd pick for a first date, or that special someone, or your grandma's 80th.  But super fun for a late night."}
{"text":"Very solid staple, and perfect for large groups.  Very happy atmosphere, with cheerful servers.  Get the appetizers, ahi tuna, nachos, or edamame.  The burgers won't do you wrong.  Pretty loud for a quiet or intimate conversation, and I would not celebrate dinner with your grandad for his 90th by any means, but not a bad choice for after the movies or before going out dancing.  Might put you in a conducive frame of mind!"}
{"text":"Every time I stay on this property I make sure I eat at this establishment.  The food and drinks are amazing.  Food is served fast and hot.  Drinks are served cold and fresh. The wait staff has always been more then helpful and makes the perfect food recommendations.  Make sure you make this place a must on your next stay."}
{"text":"This is a staple for my husband and me on any trip where there is a Yard House. Phoenix's one hits the mark and is as good as the other ones we have been to.

I ordered the fried gnocchi which was quite good. We also split an order of spicy edamame which was also tasty.

My husband always gets their half yard size of beer which comes in a glass that is half a yard tall. Other sizes include pint and shorty. Always look for their tasting flights to get a variety taste."}
{"text":"We have a habit of finding Yard Houses in cities we visit and did it once again this weekend in Las Vegas. There are apparently multiple Yard House locations in Vegas-- we have been to this one at Red Rock and the one on the Strip at the Linq.

Big pro for the Yard House is the sheer selection of beers and ciders! I love the options and the different sizes you can order.

They also have a good happy hour from 3-6pm for beer and appetizers. We got there in time to take advantage of the cheaper beers and some appetizers before dinner.

Our server (I wish I remembered her name) was great and came around the perfect amount of times, making sure we were well taken care of. She was accommodating to splitting our check 5 ways."}
{"text":"The Yard House is one of the few chain restaurants I love, but it's hard not to love when you have 100+ beers on tap! 

I finally tried the Ballast Point Sculpin Grapefruit, which is harder to find in my native Midwest. I also got the half yard of beer which is an impressively tall glass. They have samplers available as well and a well-organized menu to help you find something you are sure to like.

The menu is also spectacular. My colleagues and I split the spinach dip appetizer. I then decided to order the poke nachos as my main course and my colleagues each ordered a slider plate for their main dishes. Each of them could be their own meal so we were each pleasantly full afterwards. The poke was not as good as Hawaiian poke but still quite tasty. The slider plate comes with 4 mini sandwiches and fries."}
{"text":"Huge tapped beer selection. Beers that I didn't know were even available on tap! Food was great! I think this is a great place to hang with friends or family, have a few drinks with some great food. A definite return trip will be made when back visiting Phoenix. I wish they had a location in Chicago."}
{"text":"One of my favorite things about YardHouse is the Raspberry Cider on tap. I've never had a bad meal at any YardHouse restaurant. The turkey burger is amazing, especially with sweet potato fries. The Happy Hour menu is fantastic and the portions are still full size. Seth waited on us and he was the  BEST! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Work nearby and am here often as part of the weekday lunch crowd.  The menu has enough variety, that it can satisfy a group of varying tastes, and they have a great lunch menu, with smaller versions of their regular menu items--  soups, salads, sandwiches and pastas---  all of which are above-par, especially for a chain restaurant.

Props to the Cuban Roast Dip, or if you want to eat a little lighter--  go with the Thai Noodle or Ahi Crunchy Salad."}
{"text":"Our group went out for lunch along the strip and stopped here.  We had the lunch specials (under  $10.00) along with wine and a few beers.  The food was good, the service excellent (thanks Julius).  Total bill for 4, just over $70.00.  The outside covered patio was perfect atmosphere."}
{"text":"Love it here...     attached to the red rock casino, it makes it a perfect place to grab...    anything ( The menu is huge) and then jump into some games or a movie.    Street Tacos are AWESOME"}
{"text":"It's an upper scale Applebees decent across the board. Been to the town square and red rock locations, both decent. It's not a bad choice, but not the best..."}
{"text":"Was here last night, so here goes:

Positives:
1) Staff was awesome - sat at the bar and was checked on very regularly by both bartenders throughout the meal.
2) Cheese Curds - In my best Homer Simpson - mmmmm. 2 tasty sauces and a very generous portion.
3) Phenomenal beer selection.
4) My Cuban Roast Pork Dip was excellent, with a good spice in the dipping sauce.

Negatives:
1) Host stand didn't say anything upon walking in and heading to the bar (and multiple people were standing there).  I know, very minor, but only negative I had.

Great place for good beer and food - is definitely in my restaurant rotation."}
{"text":"We go there often for happy hour. Lots of beer selection, good prices and some of the best bartenders in Vegas. Will be going back a lot more times."}
{"text":"Love the Gardein menu! Service was a little slow that night, good thing we were on vacation. A tried and true classic. Thanks for having vegan options, yardhouse!!"}
{"text":"Hundreds of beers in draft, casual atmosphere with unique art on the walls, loud music from my generation, sports on the dozen or so tv's, a a large variety of food styles on the menu, and it's wishing walking distance to my home ;). What's not to love"}
{"text":"Great food and service. I had pork with a wonderful cherry sauce and mashed sweet potatoes.  Husband had chicken pot pie that he also liked. I had Pilsner Urquelle beer which was great. Husband had Trebel beer which he liked."}
{"text":"Truffle fries. Truffle fries! So so good and gobbled up in minutes! Our app order came out fast and was hot from the fryer, shining with truffle oil and a light topping of parsley. 

Brittany was our fantastic upbeat waitress and always had a genuine smile on her face. No wait on a Tuesday night!
Service was attentive, waters were never empty, and our main courses were quick to reach the table. I ordered the usual Mac & cheese. The full size portion was too much for me though since I tried some of my sis' roasted turkey Cobb salad with delicious ranch dressing. Dad's halibut was satisfactory; it came with asparagus, bok choy, and mashed potatoes underneath everything. Mom's two baja fried fish tacos with sriracha were to her liking and I'm surprised at how large the side classic ranch salad is. 

Good thing we didn't dine here on a weekend otherwise it would've been packed with possibly a 45 minute wait. Haven't had it at this location, but I recommend the Pineapple Express mixed drink with fresh pineapple and lots of mint!"}
{"text":"Yup, it's a Yardhouse. The patio has misters, though, and they run all night -- even at 10:00 PM the sweet heat of death is upon you in AZ.

Deliciously overpriced, but still  delicious.. beer selection is always fun. 

Yard House, Yard House, Ra Ra Ra."}
{"text":"A happening place! Very crowded and loud place, even difficult to get a seat at the bar. The bartenders were friendly and attractive, wide selection of draft beer! Very nice. The food was not very good though. Had good beers and delicious food at Yard House in Raleigh, NC a couple years before, but this location seems just okay to me.

Services - 7/10
Atmosphere -7/10
Decor - 6/10
Food -  4/10
Price - around $40 for a main course with a couple beers, not including tips. 
Occasion - game night, family gathering, or girls night out."}
{"text":"Yard House is a great bar hang out. Do I want to come here for a full meal? Not particularly. I can get better food at lower prices elsewhere. But their beer selection, plentiful TVs, and hip bar top make the place a good evening hang out. 

Yard House literally has a beer choice for everyone. Even for those who don't really like beer. It is one of the only places I know of where my partner in crime can get his favorite Breckenridge Vanilla Porter. If I'm feeling girly I like to order the Raspberry Cider. They really do have an excellent selection and I'm pretty sure it's all on tap. Love that. 

The service here is pretty great too. While sitting on the bar, my glass is never empty, even if I'm only drinking water. During my most recent visit, we ordered the hummus off the bar snacks menu. It was pretty decent and came with some incredibly fresh pita. When the pita ran out (there wasn't a lot that came with it), the bartenders offered to order us more at no charge. We ended up with three orders of pita before we ran out of hummus and they never charged us a penny for the extra. Works for me.

Yard House is a cool place to kick back and relax. They have a great patio that faces out to some excellent Desert Ridge people-watching, plenty of booths and tables, and I, of course, love their metal bar top. It's also right next to the movie theater which makes it a great spot to wait for your flick to begin. 

The prices are a bit much and their menu doesn't exactly excite me, but I do enjoy an occasional evening here."}
{"text":"Always a good time! Best bartender's in westgate. Kyle is the man and regardless of how busy they are always takes care of my N the lady. Pricey place but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Sad to say that I went on a Friday during lent so I had the four cheese pizza rather than my usual meat filled platter. The pizza was pretty darn good though and huge considering during Happy Hour it only cost 6.50. Talk about a deal! My roomie had the Cuban sandwich and said it was AMAZING. Overall the food tasted pretty great and if you during Happy Hour I really think it's hard to beat this level of food for this price. A lot of places serve really small portions for their lunch specials or Happy Hour but I think this place does it right and gives you huge portions hoping you stay around long enough to drink up a nice tab. I for one am willing to fall into this trap any day of the week as long as their food stays on point. Last star is missing because although the service was acceptable it wasn't star worthy. 

Great food, good size portions, Happy Hour makes their food cheap so plan accordingly.

(Spinach and cheese dip is pretty awesome btw.)"}
{"text":"I used to the go the locations in LA all the time, so once they opened a location in Vegas years ago, had to visit. 

I like this specific Yard House as it's in the Town Square plaza with plenty of the \"Outdoor Experience\" atmosphere surrounding it. And once your meal wraps up there is so much to do. 

Parking is easy as it's in the TS lot. 

Food is awesome. The Rib Eye, burgers, and onion rings are probably my favorite. Service is prompt even when they provide you with a pager. 

The number of beers on tap they have is insane. I forget exactly how many (triple digits maybe?), however, they are as plentiful as their TV screen setup - tons of these too!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere for two or twenty. Host and servers were all very nice and prompt. Had to wait about 15 minutes on a Saturday night but well worth it. Had BBQ bacon cheddar burger made of applewood smoked bacon, rum bbq sauce, garlic aïoli, fries. YUM! Drinks were big and well prepared also."}
{"text":"Been meaning to try Yard House for several LV visits, finally made it tonight. Excellent craft beer selection. Great menu. We had the Poke Nachos and Vampire Tacos. Both were excellent. Finished our meal with the blueberry banana crunch dessert with ice cream. Will be back here, definitely. Angel was our server and took excellent care of us."}
{"text":"This is our go-to place for a family dinner, great happy hour or date night cocktails. On a recent vacation we visited the Yard House in Hallandale Beach, FL knowing we could rely on the good food and drinks. I feel comfortable taking my 3-year old and my 75 year old parents. It's suits everyone. We love happy hour appetizers and drinks. My husband and I enjoy the bar on date nights for their good selection. THe bartenders are always great! Love it."}
{"text":"Food is ok , but their wide selection of beer is what it makes the deal sweet in here. Waitress/ waiters need to be more knowledgeable about their selection tho, our waitress couldn't answer any of our questions regarding the beers. Great place to hang out with friends. Place is clean, sport/casual atmosphere. It's also kids friendly in the patio."}
{"text":"I love going to Yard House. However, I really dislike this location (Town Square). I've been here about 5 times, and every time I always end up wishing I had gone to the location out at Red Rock (which is awesome) or wishing I just stayed home... for whatever reason this location is always EXTREMELY busy (like 1 hour wait for party of 2 busy) and the staff here not nearly as well trained or friendly as the staff at the other locations... they seem unorganized & occasionally rude, the layout of the restaurant is strange, and this location is very loud & very dark, all these things combined just make it sort of hard to enjoy going there."}
{"text":"This place was outstanding. The food was exceptional and the drinks (beer especially) is as good as you will find. Too many on tap to mention."}
{"text":"This place is bomb. My favorite restaurant- everything on the menu is delicious you can't go wrong. I'm obsessed with the tacos and the rice it comes with. Right now they have a seasonal Maui chicken and its to die for. Definitely the best chicken I have ever partaken of! Plus the service is great- I have enjoyed every server I have had and I have been there well over a dozen times."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love Yard House. They have a big menu with lots to choose from, a fun atmosphere, and quality food. The one downside is that it tends to be on the pricey side. Luckily?, we live close and can go in for happy hour which makes it affordable for us college students. We have learned though, that their afternoon deals are usually even better than their happy hour and if you go around 3, you can have the best of both worlds by choosing from either menu."}
{"text":"Come here pretty often! The truffle fries are the best truffle fries on the planet!! They have happy hour Monday-Friday 3-6pm, and their deals are pretty good. They also have their lunch selections daily from 11am-5pm, where you get to pick a soup or salad and a pizza or sandwich and all are awesome! Their roast beef dip is not the best and I am not a fan of their pizzas, but their appetizers are great( especially the onion ring tower)! Usually get the Hofbräu hefe weizen but the server convinced me to try the timmermans strawberry and !! The servers are really knowledgeable about their beers (since they have about 180 different kinds!) so they really help you pick one that's perfect for your taste!! At this specific location the servers vary with their personalities, so depending on who you get can absolutely influence your time there."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my time here a lot. It's a cozy large restaurant with booth and table seating. I arrived here with my sister on a stifling hot Monday afternoon. We were quickly seated at a table and greeted about five minutes later by our server Seth, who brought out our hibiscus tea and water. He was efficient and friendly and made great menu recommendations. We don't eat much at one sitting so we went straight in and my sister ordered their classic cheese burger with fries and I ordered the shrimp bowl with rice. One thing I noticed was their drink selection was ENORMOUS. Drafts, cocktails, mixed drinks and margaritas you name it they know it. Looked like a great happy hour spot if only we could've came at 10 pm. But it was ok, once our food came out I was very happy with my choice as I love veggies with my food and this place did a rice bowl with veggies and shrimp PERFECTLY. Since we were pressed for time we did not stay long but overall satisfied with the experience, I recommend going for happy hour on the weekdays so your server isn't rushed because I got that vibe a few times from the look of the servers there. Would go for happy hour!"}
{"text":"Love love love yard house! 
The one in long beach that's right on the ocean is my favorite! And then this is my next fave! 
The food is always good and the beer is always fresh! Love this place because they have every type of food! Easy place to go to make everyone happy!"}
{"text":"Location is great, close to the High roller other bars and restaurants.   They have a great beer selection and the food is not bad.  One less star for parking is horrible and wait time is super long.  Even on a weekday."}
{"text":"Food great here, for what you pay... Diverse menu, attention to presentation, Etc.

--Only problem I had is that a server touched all glass rims with same water pitcher at all tables. Grosses me out I quit drinking the water."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love their food and the service is pretty okay. We received our appetizers the same time we received our meals and they were cold (appetizers). I ordered a Southern Belle drink and there was a fly in it hugging a piece of pineapple(see the picture below). My boyfriend had a fly in his sashimi but being the weird one out of the two of us, he still ate it :/. My boyfriend and I decided to order two pilsner beers and we were comped for them, thanks to another waiter who brought out our appetizers. 

Our waiter Mikey was nice but we noticed he was handling multiple tables and a group near us was waiting for their meals for a while. Everyone was everywhere lol A waiter tripped and it got a little awkward but he was okay. All in all its a good chill place, but watch for little flies in anything with fruit or raw meat."}
{"text":"I used love the yard house but this last visit has me doing 180 degrees. The wait staff was no where to be found...the food was completely tasteless. The cooking staff must've been new to cooking too cause my chicken fried steak came out all cut up like they weren't sure if the food was cooked. The vampire taco had no taste either and one bite of my boyfriend's hamburger yielded the same result. AWFUL!!! Won't be visiting again"}
{"text":"The more I go here the more \"meh\" I think it is.  I like going for happy hour and have never ordered off the regular menu, because it's so pricey and not super fantastic for the price.  It's a good place to go with friends and I'll continue to go, but the food in general is kind of meh. I like the raspberry cider since I'm not much of a beer fan and that is something that I've started to crave when I don't come here for a while, but I don't miss the food.

Only come here for happy hour.  I don't think the regular menu is worth the price."}
{"text":"I had never been to a Yard House before. I was meeting a friend for dinner that worked across the street at the Forum Shops. We wandered along the way and picked this place to eat at. We were there during happy hour which I took advantage of for beer. I was set on having a steak so I ordered off the regular menu. My friend ordered several small plates off of the happy hour menu and I could see that was the way to go to try and sample a bunch of stuff at a reasonable price. I know it is a chain but I really liked the food and the service here."}
{"text":"Food was very good but not worth the fairly high price. Also beware, they allow smoking on a huge section of the patio. When I asked they said smoking allowed as long as its not within 20 feet of the door. The problem was it was within 5 feet of my food and no one else at my table smoked either. It been years since I have even seen a cigarette in any building, never mind a restaurant outside of China. If you don't want to eat your over priced food from what amounts to an ashtray, go somewhere else or ask to be seated out the range of your typical self centered cigarette smoker (or restaurant) that seems to have no idea that their stinky smoke travels great distances to visit those who don't smoke or want to inhale their second-hand smoke..."}
{"text":"Only stopped in for drinks, but Derrick, our bartender, was phenomenal. He gave great suggestions, was efficient and very personable. So glad we stopped in. Will definitely  be back."}
{"text":"The Yard House is the Reggie Bush of Phoenix establishments.  O-ver-rated.

Undeserving of accolades, superficially interesting, won't stand the test of time, all sizzle - no steak.

I mean, what can one expect from a corny chain, where one is overwhelmed by Disney-fied cake and ale?  This place couldn't be less lame if they renamed it Chotchkie's and served Extreme Fajitas.  Actually, I'm shocked that they don't.

Okay, okay.  I like beer.  They've got it.  But where is their sincerity?  They couldn't give a squirt of piss that they are serving rare Belgian pilsner.  I'm supposed to feel okay about this?  I need authenticity when I'm at a bar.  This is why so many Ultras in Scottsdale or LA or wherever fail with me, the dearth of convincing clientele, staff, and moreover, product.  Don't shit on my pillow and tell me its a little piece of chocolate.

Overall, this is a genuine 1-star rating ... not one of those mealy-mouthed \"oh, i wanted to give it LESS but I couldn't!\" reviews.  Go grab a beer here, but don't expect anything more than a bridled time with the fancypants of Fashion Square Mall.  

P.S. One time I saw a guy valet his yellow Testerossa here and got out like he ran shit ... until minutes later the exact same model pulled into the valet area right behind him.  Ha!  Nice rental, watermelon balls."}
{"text":"This specific yardhouse  as very accommodating to me being a plant based eater. The server had a separate person come out to ask my my dietary needs. I ordered the gardein \"chicken\" rice bowl and the \"chicken\" was cooked on a fry pan for me instead of the grill. Excellent service :)"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Never had a bad experience here.  Food is great with plenty of beer to choose from."}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant, this place did not offend me.
It is huge - the layout is fantastic. Booths line the walls so you can have a great view pretty much no matter where you sit. The tables which line the area between the booths and the centered bar are spaced well enough to accomodate large parties as well as not wreck the view from the bar or the booths. The outdoor seating wraps around the outer perimeter of the restaurant, so if you don't mind sitting in 100 degree heat, there are patio options as well.
The HH rocks. Great food specials and beer and wine specials. We sampled quite a few of the appetizers and they were pretty tasty. 
For Vegas, it's hard to find a place that's not sooo overpriced you can't get a snack for a reasonable price. You must know me to know how important snacks are :) 
The servers were cool. The atmosphere was OK. This is a place  would recommend to my family members who never travel, because they will feel right at home. Nothing unique of spectacular, but comfortable and you know what you're getting."}
{"text":"Really nice restaurant. Great service from Melody. Ate outside on a beautiful fall evening. Had the seasonal lobster mac and cheese. Amazing! Lots of big chunks if lobster. If you've thought about going there, do it!"}
{"text":"I truly loved my experience at this restaurant.  My coworker and I sat at the bar for our dinner and with over 100 draft beers available we asked our bartender for recommendations based on the type of beers we liked, we were also given samples of the beers that we were interested in trying.  Since the bartender had been so helpful with the beer selection I asked him for food recommendations as well.  Without thinking twice he suggested the ginger crusted salmon with wasabi mashed potatoes.  I started my meal out with a small salad which was a good size and had an array of vegetables, cheese and some croutons for crunch.  I then moved onto my salmon and was so happy I ordered it.  The salmon had a delicious ginger crust on it and was cooled perfectly.  The wasabi mashed potatoes were good as well but the salmon stole the show! My coworker had a burger and he really enjoyed that as well.  This place is a chain so I will definitely be looking for a location to go to near me!"}
{"text":"I am always very impressed with Yard House. They're menu is huge with several options including several vegetarian and vegan options. Service is usually pretty fast and friendly, it's always a bit loud in there, so if you're looking for a quiet place this probably isn't the right option but the food is very good and the variety is even better."}
{"text":"Their happy hour menu is awesome!! It's a bummer that it's only til 6pm though.

They have ample food options, all at a very reasonable price. The portions are very generous & shareable.

They get very busy during happy hour, so the service can be a little slower than normal
sometimes.

Nonetheless, I still have a great time every time I come here because of their delicious food & company."}
{"text":"We decided to take a break from all of the food courts and wanted a nice affordable lunch. This place was delicious. HUGE dish portions. I'd recommend sharing the dishes if you can. We got the spinach cheese dip (which was amazing!!), BBQ chicken salad, nachos, tacos, and Mac and cheese. All of the food was delicious. My friend said the Mac and cheese was only alright- nothing spectacular. But the rest of the food was very delicious! All of the staff were super friendly, welcoming, attentive, and accommodating. Great customer service!"}
{"text":"Ate here with 4 buddies last nite 4/23 Wait for table was short, then things went downhill. They were very understaffed and everything you asked for seemed to be a chore for the wait staff to listen to and comply with. This included bringing a towel to dry off things from the beer our waiter spilled on me. We got no comp, beer, desert or apology from a manager. The blue moons were ordered with orange slices and both came without??
Would recommend going to other Yardhouse off strip were customer service means something."}
{"text":"I'd have to say variety accounts for most of the appeal of Yard House..

They have by far the largest draft beer selection of anywhere I've ever seen, available in a variety of glass sizes. Pair that with an overwhelming selection of interesting items and you have a menu full of food and drink that will appeal to everyone.

This makes Yard House an ideal place for large parties and group gatherings. It might not amaze everyone, but all are pleased with the amount of choices available.

I've had some great food at YH locations and some very forgettable meals.  So while the menu is extensive and generally very appealing, not everything is great.

The location at Red Rock is a pretty good one. It's conveniently located and usually not too busy. The restaurant usually appears full but I've never had to wait for a table. 

The beer selection is stellar, but tonight, both my pints (grapefruit sculpin and victory IPA) came out lightly chilled. I don't know about you, but I like my beer as cold as it can get before crystallizing. I know restaurants never serve beer that incredibly cold, but a place meant for beer should at least serve their beer cold enough to be called cold. Just a little disappointing to pay $7.50 for a nearly warm pint.

The food was kinda off tonight too. I got blackened swordfish tacos, which were a little salty, but pretty good. I usually have a burger here and I think I'll probably stick to their sandwiches from now on.  My wife tried a BBQ chicken pizza and it just seemed very uninspired. It was served warm, cheese had no flavor, sauce was way too sweet.. She only had a slice.

I recommend their appetizers and beer highly, though. If you can make it during happy hour, this place is great!"}
{"text":"Awesome except for the douche bag puffing his vape into the patio area from the nearby \"vape lab\" kiosk. One star for being carcinogenic."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad dish from here. I don't usually like going to restaurants where I know there will be a 30+ minute wait to eat during peak hours/days (Friday night dinner, or so..). But I would definitely never say no to some Yardhouse.

The price is right for the food you receive. The atmosphere is calm and not over the top, and modern. Comfortable. The service is well trained, and inviting across the board.

You can't really go wrong here because of the great selection and convenient location (at least for me)!"}
{"text":"We sat on the patio to enjoy a nice, warm, and gorgeous afternoon.  The food is always good.  The service was a little on the slow side.  Yes, we were there for a few of hours but we were adding drinks and orders the entire time.  The lunch specials are a good deal and not too much food so you rolling out of there.  I got the beef dip and soup!  YUM!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times since it opened. Love the happy hour food and drinks. The happy hour appetizers are full size (not like some places during hh they cuts qty in half). So far, everything I have tried has been good. No complaints on the food. Service is hit and miss depending on the server.

{"text":"It was Game 4 of the NBA finals and we were watching the game - just a bunch of people in town for a wedding enjoying time together. We were Warriors fans in a Cavs dominated restaurant to boot! Domonik, our server, was the best of the best, with a fantastic attitude and courteous service! Even though we were Warriors fans, she treated us with the utmost respect and demonstrated the class of people Cleveland erst are! The service at this place was just top notch, with the manager coming over to ask about a sandwich we had thought was a little dry. The food overall was great, but this place really takes the prize for their superb service and attention to detail. Great sports bar experience. Go Warriors!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!
I love the southern belle and the food is always above my expectations.  The terriaki bowl with chicken and shrimp and brown rice is absolutely delicious, and so are the tacos and burgers, and everything I have tried here. Reasonable prices which can be hard to find, and a laid back, chill place."}
{"text":"We love this place! They are always busy, yet always get the order completely right. We have had the Thai chicken pizza, Gardein chick'n nuggets, & a multitude of different beers.  
Service is always excellent, whether you were at a table or in the bar area, and the hostess station is always very well manned.
Prices are a little high, but the quality of what you get is worth it. We will be back again and again."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Vegas! Great nachos and lettuce wraps!"}
{"text":"I ordered a take out burger and chicken sandwich. Was told it would be ready in 20 min. Arrived at exactly 20 minutes just to find out they didn't even start my ticket. Waited another 20 minutes. Not even an apology. I called for take out in advance because my 2 year old sun had a fever. All I got was an enjoy."}
{"text":"On vacation for my bf's birthday and decided to stop by the yard house for a drink for myself and our friends. The bartender working the bar on August 14, 2016 at about 9:05pm was completely rude. Our whole trip here in Las Vegas was amazing. We definitely regret stopping by the yard house outside bar in the alley between the linq and flamingo.

If you, as a worker have no tolerance for people visiting the strip or a certain amount of people you do not need to be working with people directly. The manager came out and automatically came off rude just like her employee. Never have we ever felt disrespected by any bar before and the employee at the yard was the first EVER. She made the mistake and miscounted the amount of people drinking and asked us once again for our ID's. Twice. Then she gets on the walky talky to call the manager, who didn't even help the situation. We decided to walk away because we will not tolerate being mistreated in any way. Instead we walked right over to the AMERICAN. The gentleman there was great."}
{"text":"In the area recently and tried this location, it is better than the one where I live.  The chicken wraps were really good and plenty for the 3 people.  Not to happy with the tower of onion rings, there was plenty of them, but they weren't as crispy and light as we thought they should be.  My friend really liked her club sandwich, she said it was fresh and tasty.  The specialty cocktails were all delicious, the Black Orchid was especially good.  We will come back and try different menu items next time, there is a good assortment.  The place is spacious and if I drank beer, this would be the place to check them all out.  Service was also really good."}
{"text":"Yardhouse is probably one of my favorite spots!!!

They have beer, a full bar, martinis, and happy hour. Which seems to run all night or something....I kid, of course. (Sheesh, I sounded like a lush just now, didn't I??? Hmm, oh wellz.)

Their happy hour is the best. You can get like $5 martinis and half off pizzas! Once my friends and I got (unexpectedly) drunk off taking shots of Hennessy at the bar that we had to (HAD TO) sober up so..the half off pizzas really helped in that. There was 4 of us and 2 pizza and a stack of onion rings. Uhmmm, yeaaaaah...we reeeaalllyyyyyy needed to sober up. heeeheeee

The best part of their menu is their mac and cheese! OMIGOSH, I cannot get enough of that stuff. I always wanna try something other than that but, I always have to have it!!! 
Its pasta (not macaroni) with bacon, mushrooms, cheeese (lots of it) and truffle oil. It's so freeekin rich. And kinda pricey. But, welllllll-worthhhhhh-itttttt!"}
{"text":"Best happy hour.  Great food ,good prices and great staff. What else can you ask for . Oh wait you can also watch sports. Also great deal on gift cards now."}
{"text":"First of all, I have to give our server Rejeana five stars for herself.  Within two minutes of being seated she appeared, a petite, bubbly and very informative young lady. She gave a very clear explanation of the beers, and menu and also asked if we were going to the game, since it was close to starting time.  We were not, but we're impressed that she would inquire.  Our drinks and meals appeared quickly even though the restaurant was quickly filling up.  Every time Rejeana passed our table she checked on us.
To start with we ordered the crab, lobster, artichoke dip which was excellent.  There were four of us, I ordered the Mac and cheese and a ranch salad.  The salad was fresh and of a good size for an appetizer salad and my adult Mac and cheese was saucy with plenty of chicken, bacon and mushrooms.  I will enjoy the leftovers.  It was delicious.  Another tried the pepperoni pizza which he said was equally as good as any he had had.  He also enjoyed his caesar salad.  One had the clam chowder, yum, with the fish and chips which was a very large order.  He totally enjoyed it.  And the fourth of our party had the tomato bisque which she said was the best she had ever tasted, and also had an order of the crab cakes which she totally enjoyed.  Two of us are foodies  from the Napa Valley in California and we are very spoiled with five star restaurants surrounding us.  The food we enjoyed  at your restaurant this evening was equal to what we enjoy at home.  Kudos to you!"}
{"text":"I usually love yard house but this trip was disappointing to say the least. Don't think they were prepared for Black Friday rush. Service and management were very friendly  but food was not good. Our appetizer took 40+ minutes it was taken off bill but even when did receive it tasted bad and thrown together. Just a bad experience overall."}
{"text":"This place gets one star for having a pretty good beer selection and decent food, but it lost all points as a restaurant by having the music at nightclub volume. When I asked our waiter if they could turn it down a little so I wouldn't have to shout to converse with my neighbor at the table, he informed me that it was a management decision to have the volume at that level.

Go there if you want a good selection of beers and aren't interested in conversing with your companions, but don't go there if you want the full dinner experience."}
{"text":"Fun place to chill and throw back a few. I had a gift card to use. This was the night. 
We arrived early at the bar and drank ? Beer. Moved into the longest booth ever fits 12 people. I had  Calamare for my  Appetizer and fried chicken for dinner which was very good. The service was as great. It's  Located inside of Red Rock casino."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. It has a great combination of food variety as well as a relaxing ambiance. The staff here has always been friendly, as well as the management. 


Today, I came in having one of those bad days, and the manager came up to me in a caring manner asking if I wanted any desserts on the house. I was astonished. He must have overheard me asking the host If we could sit in the corner not near as many guests. I was so touched. That speaks lengths about this company. I already love coming here, but now I will definitely dine here more often. 

Nick was our server for lunch and was a sweetheart as well. For appetizers I recommended the ahi tuna with wontons and a avocado, or the crab, artichoke, lobster cheese dip."}
{"text":"Great food & drinks got a seat at ghe bar once..... its just too busy to get a seat at the bar during happy hours, & service at the bar is slow, slow, slow....."}
{"text":"First encountered Yard House in Denver.  Had the pleasure of finding them again in Las Vegas.  

So many beers on tap, it is hard to count.  

Food is amazing.  

I sent corporate an  email requesting a franchise in my home town."}
{"text":"59 minutes to get food, after amazing seating service. Yeah, it's not crazy busy... Trust me. 59 minutes to wait for Mac and cheese WITHOUT MUSHROOMS. Food does arrive... 'Mac and Cheese'...say WITHOUT MUSHROOMS. Server then asks me..'I think so' ? Then 12 steps away, then 12 back... We're good. 12 bites in guess what.... MUSHROOMS. NOT A LITTLE BUT THE SIZE OF A SMALL STEAK. Cool, I have a semi food allergy and avoid them at all cost...but. Our server was good, apologetic, tells the manager. Here is where the process is awkward. 

Manager appears, to apologize, and offers a free drink for the road. OK....I understand this is Vegas but know this: I live here and my business is here. A free drink does not save you a 1 star review. A $200 bill with a food allergy mistake solved with a $2 product cost comp? Ugly ugly ugly.... There are way too many options on the strip to have this. Now, Scottsdale, San Diego and the rest of the Yard Houses will not be seeing me again. A huge mistake like a food allergy would, I would at least expect, more than a free well vodka and cranberry to fix."}
{"text":"I'm really not sure why I haven't reviewed the Yardhouse yet (being that I'm there all the time anyway) but I figure I chime in and give the Yelpers yet another review of an awesome eatery/bar.  I pretty much love this place.  The atmosphere is great, the music is usually pretty jammin (albeit someone has the top 40 hits on rotation nowadays and I'd definitely rather have the classic rock they usually throw on), and I always seem to run into someone I know.  Now, I'm usually not an advocate for chain restaurants but the Yardhouse has it's own uniqueness to pride itself on.  What exactly am I talking about you ask?  THE BEERS: the main reason why I commute well across town to Town Square.  The Yardhouse, aside from the Freakin' Frog on Maryland Pkwy, has the most impressive variety of beers available that I have ever seen.  They have all kinds of different types of beer for every type of palate and for 3.50 domestics and 4.50 goblets/specialty beer mixes during happy hour, that is definitely hard to beat.  I did mention happy hour and I will also mention that happy hour is the best time to go (10 to close Sun-Wed and I'm not sure of the mid-day happy hour but I know there is one).  Select appetizers are half off during happy hour and they even have well drink specials for the spirit and hard liquor lovers out there.  All in all, I must say that the Yardhouse is one of my favorite hangouts and they usually never cease to impress.  I say usually because they did get rid of one of my favorite beers (the Kulmacher Eisbock for those interested) but I guess they have another hundred beers to choose from to help console my woes.  Cheers and happy beer-ing..oh and please drink responsibly ;)"}
{"text":"I really liked the Yard House. There was entire section of vegetarian and vegan items on the menu made with Gardein. All of the options have dairy or mayo on them but they can be removed to make them vegan. 

The beer selection is impressive and made me super happy. I had a great beer from Dogfish Head. 

For happy hour all craft beers are $4-4.50 which is great for a lot of the obscure and hard to find beers on the menu.

The server was very knowledgeable about the beer and menu and seems as though he wanted to help out. He had a great upbeat attitude. I will be here again for sure."}
{"text":"Everything I've tried here has been good. They have a great selection of beers to choose from too. -1 Star for being pricey."}
{"text":"We went Friday night and as expected it was busy. This does not excuse the poor service we received. Waited 20 minutes for table then after we sat waiter immediately wanted to know if we were ready to order. We had not even looked at menu so it was obvious they wanted to turn tables. 

Got our drinks and ordered appetizer. Ordered another beer and after 10 minutes waiter said bar was slow and beer was coming. Ordered dinner and nothing. After 20 minutes waiter came over and said kitchen lost our order what was it we ordered again. It was obvious the waiter was no good at this point 20 minutes later dinner came and by that time tables next to us had turned. We were no longer hungry and took food home with us. 

Of course when bill came there was no adjustment for late meals or even just a comped drink that we waited on. We are locals and this location caters to locals but we were really disappointed. 

Not sure if we will ever go back, they did not seem to care about us so why bother. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Beer selection is amazing, DUH, its the Yardhouse... but their food sucks for the price.  Yes, their food is expensive for average food... just being honest."}
{"text":"Great food and over 100 types of beer on tap. The chicken tortilla soup is made with fresh chicken and an excellent choice. Be sure to check out happy hour from 3pm to 6pm Monday thru Friday or late night from 10pm to close Sunday thru Wednesday.  Calamari and chicken nachos are great happy hour selections!! Bar is usually busy and service is good."}
{"text":"This one completely took me by surprise. Attached to the Red Rock casino on the edge of town, I was expecting your standard American sports bar. After struggling to choose from such a good beer selection and enjoying some good calamari and a smartly deconstructed spicy tuna roll, I am happy to admit my expectations were totally wrong! I also happened to stumble in during happy hour, which sweetened the deal even more. The appetizers were half price and more than served as a meal. The tuna roll was fresh, heaping with avocado and very flavorful with an elegant presentation. The staff was friendly and attentive despite being busy.

I suppose the best review I can give is that I will definitely go back the next time I'm in Vegas (or another city where a Yard House happens to exist)!"}
{"text":"I am not usually a fan of chain restaurants but Yardhouse has become my \"go-to\" place for good food and a huge selection of craft beers. Having been experimenting with vegetarian cuisine recently I was surprised at how good their chicken substitute is. I definitely recommend it to any vegetarians out there or meat eaters looking to try something new."}
{"text":"Went to this street spot in Las Vegas for lunch and ended up getting so full on their appetizers ! they were all delicious we ordered the tuna, cauliflower bites, spring rolls and the boneless chicken wings everything was delicious waitress was very friendly and very efficient will definitely be back when we're back in town"}
{"text":"Happy Hour Review Only

Met up with some friends here for half price appetizers and discount drinks before the Giants/Cubs game on a Thursday evening.  Between four of us we split 2 orders of chicken nachos (extra cheese), 2 orders of sliders, calamari, and the poki tuna stack.  My favorite by far was the poki stack with this kick ass soy/wasabi dressing circling the plate which will clear your sinuses in no time.  The nachos and sliders are my friends' favorites.  They were okay, nothing special.  Calamari was not all that special either, bread crumb crust with marinara instead of battered with aioli.  I do however, highly recommend the $4.50 margaritas, big and tasty.  With all that food and two drinks each the bill came out to $20 a person. We left stufffed and still probably spent less money than we would have on ball park food.  Our server was chipper and accomodating even timing our last round for right at the 6pm happy hour cut off buzzer.  I would definitely go back again for happy hour, I don't think I would want to pay the regular prices after all that."}
{"text":"Lots of beers to choose from, but not many that stood out. Most were what I would consider grocery store beers that you can find anywhere. Their house honey beer is pretty good, though.

The food was good... my club sandwich was nice and filling.

Service here was some of the best I had on my trip."}
{"text":"It's Yard House, this company does a very good job of being consistent across all of their restaurants and this is no exception. The staff are friendly and attentive and the food is always fresh, hot and delicious. The only complaint I have found is that I have to wait longer for my beers here. Mixed drinks, I understand but to order a beer before appetizers and not get it until my entree on 2 separate occasions is pretty annoying. So, get that aspect together and it would be just as good as all the other locations around the valley."}
{"text":"I come in from time to time I travel for a living so when I come home to Phoenix I come here for shopping very convenient. I ordered my usual and the bartender informed me that they were no longer making homemade potato chips big sigh!! Because I always order the spicy Tuna Roll With homemade potato chips such a good combination I highly recommend it. So I ended up with tortilla chips not as good but Steve the Bartender went over and above and somehow had them made and brought them out for me!!!!Amazing I really appreciate good customer service"}
{"text":"Sunday afternoon and I was headed to Red Rock to meet a friend for a movie(Bourne Element- 3/5 Stars) and wanted to grab some lunch beforehand. I had been here twice before and enjoyed it so no surprise is again proved to be a solid choice. I arrived a bit early but didn't feel like sitting at the bar so I just loitered around the empty waiting area which may have been a slight annoyance to the hostess girls, perhaps interrupting a run down of Saturday night's activities? They were nice though and tried to act unaffected.  When my friend arrived were were seated promptly in a booth, which I requested(no prob)
 
 Immediate service netted us an ice cold Stone IPA(me) and some tasty cider-ish thing(her)...yum. I ordered a Pastrami sandwich and salad from their build it yourself combo lunch special.($10) and it was quite good. Tasty, juicy pastrami on a half sized fresh deli roll with mustard and pickles and a nice garden salad pre-dressed nicely, not too dry, not too wet. My friend's salad looked good and we were both pleased headed out for some mindless entertainment. Always solid, this is a consistent, convenient  and comfortable spot with a fantastic selection of beer and solid food to boot."}
{"text":"Had dinner here the last night of our vacation. Fun atmosphere. So many beers to choose from. Nice menu. Seated right st our reservation time. 
Had a great steak. Others in our group had ribs and salads. Everyone was pleased with their food. Decent prices."}
{"text":"The service was very friendly and the restaurant itself was really beautiful, with fold away walls that made part of the restaurant open air. The food itself was not spectacular at all. My wife loves Brussels sprouts but she couldn't even eat the ones they brought out. They were called crispy Brussels sprouts under the snack section of the menu. They deep fried them whole with potato chunks and served them on top of a spicy aioli. The cooking method led the Brussels sprouts to become chewy and tough as they cooled down. And it was just too much mayo for me. 

I got the chopped salad and had them add iceberg lettuce. It came out with an avocado half sliced paper thin and spread out on top of the salad. It was gorgeous and I couldn't wait to dig in. The dressing ended up being awful. It tasted like thousand island, but was pink, maybe from ketchup? It was basically pickly mayonnaise but was sweet. It ruined the salad for me. 

On the bright side the hummus did come in a huge portion. Plenty for 4 people to split as long as you order extra pita. 

I'm not anxious to go back, but since they are open until late and have a super diverse menu I probably will give them a second try."}
{"text":"It's a consistent concept. I love the selection since I like Belgium beer. We had great service and some appetizers.  The small beers are pricey but are worth it. 
."}
{"text":"Their happy hour is AMAZING! You have to get their chicken nachos, chicken fingers, onion rings, and lettuce wraps. Can you tell we have been here a few too many times for happy hour? I love their mac and cheese too! My reason for 4 stars is that the wait staff is either REALLY bad or just good. You never have the same service."}
{"text":"This would be 3.5 stars, but I am giving the benefit of the doubt here. 

Say what you will about corporate, chain restaurants. The one thing you do get with them is consistency. Good or bad. At least you know what you are getting into. With that being said, I really enjoy the Yard House! Yes, an exclamation point. 

The place has about 100 beers on tap to choose from. There is definitely something for everyone. They have all of my usual favs and some I have even gone out on a limb to try. The servers I have had have always been pretty knowledgeable about the beers and offer recommendations. 

I have had several dishes here as well. If you like Mac & Cheese try theirs. It is a huge portion, has lots of cheese, bacon, and mushrooms. So it can't be bad. The Ahi Tuna Melt is good, with sweet potato fries. Spinach and Artichoke dip is good. Crab and lobster dip, although they do skimp a little on the lobster. Overall, I would say the food is above average and the service has always been great. They have a ton of TVs with different sports and will even change channels if you are looking for a particular game. 

The Desert Ridge location does have one drawback: San Felipe's just moved in next door. So if you are here after about 9PM, you get the nice thumping from the noisy neighbor."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Great selections of beer! Me and wife love coming here any chance we can get. I've gotten different food every time and haven't had a bad dish. Usually pretty busy but well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Place is great. We love to eat here. Last night we went there and the service was a plus too. We had a great waitress named Ashley. Thank you for keeping a wide variety of COLD beer, great food and great service."}
{"text":"The Yard House has been at this location for more than a few years in a place (Westgate) Where I've watched at least 10 different stores come and go.  My family and I are big fans of the nachos, the friendly service, and the atmosphere.  It gets a little loud during night time but it only adds to the lively mood, especially when there's a popular sports event being shown on one of their many 30\" - 40\" TV's.  If you like grilled food, beer, and a place where you can relax the Yard House has what your looking for."}
{"text":"I have been to this location and the one in Glendale so many times i cannot even begin to count everything i have ate. But i usually get the same thing every time but i have ventured out of my comfort zone plenty of times. Service is iffy sometimes its stellar sometimes its decent sometimes its just okay. I usually don't pay attention because of the fact that i am more absorbed in the family time talk aspect so they really do not have my full attention span going. 

Anyhow for food, i have tried the jambalaya every way except with noodles! still need to try it! Sooooo good though. I know i have tried some sort of chicken with a gravy and corn mashed potatoes i think that was awesome as well. But those were my top two. the mac and cheese squared is okay i am not a fan of all the portobello mushroom or baby bello mushrooms i just don't really care for the after taste. Now if they just gave me extra regular button mushrooms I'd be in heaven especially extra mushrooms and bacon! I have also tried their chocolate souffle for my B-day 2 years ago which was awesome!  

My boyfriend had tried a sandwich before and was not too thrilled with it. But their shoe string fries are yummy. So its just about what you order that is important i just stick to what i know is safe for the most part.
The ahi tar tar is bomb too. YUM.

Thats all i got for now until then....

This will definitely be to be continued....Stay tuned
;)"}
{"text":"You can tell how good food is by the amount of business it gets!

It took 45 minutes for me to get a table on a Monday but that doesn't affect my review. The wait was only to prepare your taste buds for what was to come.

I had the Nashville Chicken with a side order of Truffle Fries. After taking a bite of the Nashville Chicken dipped in buttermilk I didn't think that it could get any better but after trying the pancakes my head almost exploded. 

Though this is a chain I think that it is still one of the best restaurants in the Cleveland area and a must try for those that haven't."}
{"text":"greg greg greg the bartender!!! i cant say it enough this guy is great he takes his job to another level his customer service was outstanding i would tell the world go see my boy greg hes great at what he does thanks for the 5 star service greg"}
{"text":"This place is always a safe bet if you're at town square.  You can do anything from drinks at the bar to a full fledged dinner with the family here.  The food is usually pretty good and the staff does their best to keep patrons happy.  My only gripe is that the prices are a little high and the bill can get pretty steep relatively quick.

Some of my favorite food are the Mac & Cheese, calamari, and chicken wings.  There is tons of other good stuff but I can't recall it off the top of my head.  

My favorite thing about the yard house though is the music!  Almost every time I'm there, they are blaring classic rock which is awesome!  On the occasions its not classic rock, they play 90's alternative which is my second choice.  Usually places like this play hipster, wub wub, or Justin Beaver type music.  Its nice to have a bar play actual BAR music!  Keep it up Yard House."}
{"text":"What we love about this place is the consistency of the food. Always good and the service is great too!  Try out their happy hours!"}
{"text":"Let's start by saying we ordered takeout for a company function. Total people 7. We are only 2 minutes away. 
I will be dealing with my order only. 
1) French Onion Soup. One of the worst I have ever eaten. Cold, onions hard, cold and what ever that was in the second container for the soup was terrible. The soup tasted like they just poured it from a can. If you can't make French Onion Soup don't serve it. Take it off the menu.
2) French Dip Sandwich. The sandwich was awesome. One of the best I have ever had. 
3) Classic Ranch salad. Normal basic salad. Just what I wanted.
4) Salted Carmel Butterscotch Pudding. I thought the soup was bad, this was even worse. Took a spoon full and spit it out. Can't put in here what I said but it wasn't nice. 
Why only one star......This place is next to a Hyatt, you would think they would have better food. Guess not. I wasn't the only one to complain but that is their tale to tell. For just opening 3 months ago you think they would have bugs out already. I was wrong."}
{"text":"Okay the first time I ever went i had a dinner entree and it wasn't that great. Second time I had the Bernaise sliders and I fell in love. Can't seem to order anything but them, since. However I did try the Ahi Steak sandwich once and that was amazing as well..Not a big beer drinker so really can't comment on that.. But the music ...if you like classic rock and/or 80's rock.. this is the place to be!!!There's just something about hearing Boston being played...."}
{"text":"Shout out to you for being open late! It's so hard to get some good food late at night. Food is always on point. The pepper crusted filet is amazing and the onion ring tower is a great way to start off any meal."}
{"text":"Nice looking place with good service and 100 beers on tap plus good, very reasonably priced, eats... do I need to say more? Sure I do! If the already mentioned didn't spark an interest than this should: GREAT Lunch Specials and Happy Hour (M-F, 3-6). The Club Sandwich is da bomb! Seriously large sharable dinner portion."}
{"text":"Great service from Amanda.  Food was really good and large portions plus the tons of beer to choose from.  Would recommend and it will be worthwhile"}
{"text":"This place is located very close to the High Roller, as well as our hotel, so we ended up eating here a couple of times. 

I highly recommend the crispy duck wings - they were so good that I ordered them both times I went. Other items on the menu that we tried included the fried calamari, the lobster, crab & artichoke dip, the blue crab cakes, the onion ring tower, the moo shu egg rolls and the coconut shrimp. 

I did not really like the crab cakes, as the flavour of the crab was overpowered by other ingredients that I didn't enjoy. I found the coconut prawns to be too sweet and greasy, but the calamari was quite good - we actually had both types, the regular and the spicy (Kung Pao) version. Both were tasty, but I prefer the original one. 

Service was good, and they have a huge beer selection. I would definitely return if I go back to Vegas. Their Bloody Mary was almost as good as a Caesar - it was spicy and served with a piece of bacon - yum!"}
{"text":"I do commend them on their fantastic selection of brews, but their food is 3.5 star at best. I once had to return a vanilla ice cream because it was so tasteless it felt like I was eating ice.

They do get some credit for having a very nice, upscale, and trendy location with great service in a top part of town. I feel with a reinvention of their menu options, this place could be a hit in Glendale."}
{"text":"This is my third time visiting the Camelback location, so I thought it was time for a review.

Yardhouse Camelback really does everything right. Their service is top notch and thorough. Food comes out fast and is well prepared, and the prices are excellent. Really delicious appetizers (get the nachos and pizza). They are great at making American dishes and salad and are average or above at some of the other dishes. For example, their burgers are extremely delicious with fresh meat.

And let's not forget their alcoholic beverages. Excellent selection of beers (as most of you know already know) and great cocktails."}
{"text":"We were in Vegas for five days and ate here three times - you do the math. It helped that we stayed at Flamingo and The Linq was right outside our hotel door.

The beer selection is unreal - over 100 draft beers, and they will let you sample something if you're not sure. I ordered the North Coast Scrimshaw every time - so good, and all of the servers recommended it.

Our first visit I had the jambalaya with linguine, and it was amazing. Full of sausage and seafood, and the two shrimp on top were fantastic.

The second visit my friend and I split a four-cheese pizza with pepperoni. It came out very burnt on the bottom. We told our server and he took care of it right away, and had them make a new pizza for us. The manager also came over and apologized, and they didn't charge us for our pizza. The new pizza was fantastic. We were very impressed with the service and how they fixed everything right away. This was a big reason why we decided to go back the next day.

Our third visit I ordered the jambalaya again (it was just so good!) and it was just as delicious as the first time. We decided to order dessert this time, and had the S'mores Brownie. It takes about 15 minutes, so make sure to give yourself time, because it is totally worth it. It is a big dessert - way too big for one person. The brownie is warm and gooey, and the marshmallows on top were toasted to perfection.

The staff were very helpful and friendly, and the view from the rooftop patio of the High Roller is awesome. They also have outdoor TVs, so we were able to watch the hockey game while still enjoying the Vegas weather. Would definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this location. Super friendly staff. I normally get the turkey club with side salad. So yummy. You really can't go wrong with anything here. And yummy Arnold Palmers!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for food, drinks, hanging out with friends or family. Love love the food. Great service. Great location. I will be back again. Awesome!"}
{"text":"I met my business partner there. He has health issues and need food that was oil free. He asked for a custom order of steamed rice and veggies. He was very happy. I ordered the Bon Mi sandwich which was tasty but meet was horrendously chewy. Mostly gristle. Totally ruined the experience and I like Yardhouse. I am usually at the Red Rock casino location. Would have been 5 stars if the meat in the sandwich was palatable"}
{"text":"This place is me and my husbands favorite spot to go before a movie and have a couple YARD bears and deviled eggs!! Amazing food and beer!"}
{"text":"Food was a disappointment. I've been to yardhouse before and had a better experience, but this place was just off. My boyfriend ordered the mac and cheese and parts of it came out cold. When we sent it back, there was literally another one brought out within 2 minutes which was still not hot. The food here is clearly made in advance and it shows in the quality. I ordered a tuna tower and the tuna in the middle was really cold as well, tasted like it still needed to thaw out. Also, no late night happy hour at this location. Would not eat here again."}
{"text":"I loved the enormous selection of beer on tap.  Service was fast and friendly.  Food... meh.  I think I had about the worst guacamole ever and was afraid the chips would break my teeth.  Fish and chips pretty much Mortons-like.  The fries had potential if they had been hotter. (Thin but not quite match stick.)

My dining partner had dipped beef sandwich.  His comment was pretty much \"Meh, I've had better.\"

I would definitely go back for the beer, service and atmosphere but eat elsewhere.

I don't know about others, but I like salty little things to eat when drinking beer.  I would have killed for a can of pringles or something to nosh on. (That's why I got the guacamole but it didn't work out)"}
{"text":"Poke nachos, spicy tuna roll and two orders of deviled eggs make the perfect dinner for two!"}
{"text":"Went tonight for my birthday dinner and the service was awesome.  Our waiter Derick was friendly and probably one of the best servers we have ever had at any restaurant.  We had a party of 5 and 2 kids and I didn't hear a single complaint about the food quality ."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this restaurant.  They have the most beers on tap in town. The prices are reasonable, and the food is excellent. 
The menu has a great selection from Burgers to Steak and Seafood, the Grilled Artichoke appetizer is very good. In the 20+ times we have eaten here,  we have never had a bad meal. 
They also have a great kids menu. 
One of our top 10 restaurants in town for casual dining."}
{"text":"Come here a lot love the food. Recently went here and the service wasn't so great at first had some issues but the server made up for how badly it started. Stephan was awesome at making sure things got better for us! Because of that I can still say we were really taken care of there by him, another server, and the manager."}
{"text":"Love the reverse Happy Hour.  Very extensive menu with great prices after 10pm (weekdays).  Everything I order is massive for a skinny girl like me.  I love the Poke Stack with Wasabi chips, my go to.  I can never finish it.  I went for a last minute late night dinner with my in laws and my father-in-law told the waiter it was my birthday and they gave me a super charming Happy Birthday creme brulee which my father-in-law enjoyed very much!  LOL  Thanks Yard House!  You are my go-to late night haunt!"}
{"text":"Gardein meatless options, massive beer selection.  Good happy hour prices.  Sit outside to see the Linq."}
{"text":"An evening of shopping can create quite the appetite. In a sea of restaurants big and small, we managed to stumble across a real treat. This place is nestled in Town Square between Guitar Center and Rave Movie Theatre. 

Some may sleep on this gem because of its location. When you think of dining inside of a shopping area and you are not shopping, it can be a deterrent. It's no fun to push through crowds and fight for parking just for a drink or meal. Yard House sits in a class by itself and begs you to push beyond that way of thinking and here's why. Valet parking is available. There's great food choices for every palette and an extensive drink menu that's should be categorized as the winos bible. 

This place is huge. But apparently, not big enough! We pushed our way through a crowd waiting for tables to the bar area. After all, why wait when you don't have to. The bar area offers the perfect view. It sots in the center of the room. It was rectangular shaped with tons of TVs and plenty of seating. Upon sitting, we were immediately greeted by Mitch. Before he could slid a coaster, I inquired about a cider on tap. To my surprise, there were at least six to choose from. Mitch did a good job of describing the makeup of each one which was very helpful. While sipping, I decided to look at the menu (while I could still see). It was huge! .... And admittedly, I am somewhat skeptical of places with tons of options. But, again, Yard House delivered. For starters, we ordered the lobster and crab dip. It was served with a sea of pita bread and chips. The dip was blended with just the right amount of cheese. Each bite was packed with lobster or crab and it was seasoned. More cheese please! I ordered the Mac n Cheese House Favorite (chicken breast and bacon filled pasta served in a mixture of cheeses). It was delicious. Too much to eat in one sitting. If you are not sharing, I would recommend the smaller portion. My compadre chose the street tacos which is served a la carte or as a meal with spicy rice and beans. Mitch pointed out they could be prepared various ways (i.e. on lettuce) and you could mix them up. We went with the pork belly taco and vegetable taco (something Rojos). Notice I said we. After reading the descriptions, we agreed it only made sense to share. Both entrees were worth seven stars easily. 

I topped my evening off with a sparkling wine specialty beverage. It was infused with  Chambord which happens to be one of my favorite liqueurs.  If that wasn't enough, I also tried another cider. Shots out to Woodchuck for the Raspberry Cider. It was perfect. Just like the evening. Yard House, rock on!"}
{"text":"Great service.  Awesome decor.  Huge selection of beers.  Food is not the greatest.  I had the bacon cheeseburger with skinny fries.  The burger was burnt and tasteless.  The fries were hard to eat because they were so thin.  I'd rather have steak fries.  Yardhouse is a great place to sample beer, but as a restaurant I'd never go back to eat."}
{"text":"They have a great space with a huge beer selection, 140 on tap to be exact. Other than that I don't have much good to say about The Yard House.

$50.00 for lunch with no alcohol and very slow service is a bit exhorbitant. We each ordered Ice Teas, a salad and wings. How could that be $50? Well it is at The Yard House.

I'll try them again sometime when I want to catch a game and have a couple beers otherwise I won't be back."}
{"text":"My hubby and I love Yard House for happy hour.  Any other time of day?  Not so much.  The beer is highly overpriced if it is not happy hour, as are the entrees.  We love the chicken nachos ( they spread red and green enchilada sauce on them) and the spicy tuna roll which is huge and is chock full o' avocado and chunks of tuna.  yum!  The beer selection is good, but there really won't be anything that makes you go too far out of your craft beer comfort zone here."}
{"text":"The outdoor tables are very dirty. They are wooden slats with very visible old decaying food stuffs in the slats.  The a manager was a jerk. I don't understand why they don't draw from the food court, out side area.   If you have been there you would see that the patio is right off the food court, steps from the movie theatre. The hostess stand is why way on the other side. We , quit frankly , don't care to walk a freaking mile in a circle. The waiters never write anything down and then disappear, so yes....it is that kind of place. Beg for service. Lots of mistakes. Mediocre corporate food stuffs. Huge walking torture circle to sit down and have a beer.  They really need to re think their patio. Lost opportunity."}
{"text":"I wrote a negative review a few months ago but thought I would give it a second try.  The restaurant is much better. The service was wonderful. The outside tables were replaced and no longer have slats, that trapped spilled food 
The server came over and wrote down my order, we were simple today but it was appreciated. I loved my Tuna appetizer ...healthy fresh and tasty. My husband and daughter were equally impressed....I will be back often. I really felt the last yelp that was negative was listened to and today was very professional and a fun time."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go for happy hour after work and to catch the game.  I love the chicken strips and the beer selections are great."}
{"text":"Worst Service Ever , long lines , made to wait 40 min for table and then have them try to put you in the bar , just to give your table away to a party behind you. Response from manager to wait for a table for 30 min again. Will report to corporate"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I walked all around westgate and decided on the yard house. It was busy but we were seated fast. Our server was very friendly and prompt in delivery. Choice of beers were extensive and the food was great. You might find it a little pricey, but I felt it was well worth it. Cooked right and very tasty, not overdone. We barely finished our plates and were definately satisfied."}
{"text":"Review: The veggie Mac and Cheese (squared) is the single best plate of food I have ever eaten in any restaurant.  End of review...."}
{"text":"Hmmm the Yard House seems a bit OVER-RATED to me except for the Lettuce Wraps...they're not over-rated at all, they're DeLisH! The Y-House Is always crowded on the weekends and the hosteses are a bit snooty. For what they charge here for food and drinks I would much rather go somewhere else that Is isn't as dingy and where the staff have a bit more personality.

When I came here on a Friday night with my possey I practically showed myself to the bar since the hostess was too busy with the chaos going on in the lobby, as we made our way around the bar I noticed a couple that were being toooo affectionate In public, that I bumped into every other person due to the lack of space, long wait for a table and bar stools and my \"Mission Impossible\" to get a drink...No Thank You Y-house."}
{"text":"The food here is fresh and sooooooo damn good it's crazy. Came here today with my son for happy hour it's my favorite time to come lol. First they have new additions to their happy hour menu so I had to try it. We ordered poke nachos, spinach dip, chicken tenders, and of course chicken lettuce wraps. Can I just say the poke nachos are ridiculously delicious the poke was so fresh it melted like butter in my mouth the seaweed flakes and white truffle sauce is amazing. The chicken tenders with fries was amazing the tenders were some of the best we've had eating out you can tell they are homemade. Spinach dip was so good with burnt cheese around the edges yummmm and of course the chicken lettuce wraps I always order never disappoint. Also our server Amanda was so nice and attentive can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Maybe the best YH I have been too. The service was the best.  Apps were on point.  Especially the  spicy edemame.   Poke is good also.  I had spicy Nashville chicken.  Get the edemame sauce with that.    It is a solid four stars."}
{"text":"Overall great experience! The green beer and short distance from our apartment is what brought my boyfriend and I here. This was our first time here and it was a rather busy night being St. Patrick's Day and all but our server Jeremy never faltered! He was quick, always had a smile and never made us feel rushed. The vegetarian selection was pretty standard. We really enjoyed the fried Brussels sprouts/potatoes as suggested by server. If you're a hummus fan, don't eat it here, it's crap. Our hummus was very kindly replaced with truffle fries. Cocktails and beer were fantastic! Try the Hawaiian mule, it's perfect for the warm weather. We will definitely be back! :)"}
{"text":"Upsides:
I wanted to try this restaurant because they supposedly have the biggest selection of draft beers.  Who wouldn't want to try that?  Anyways we sat outside and this place has a nice layout.  The server was very pleasant and helpful.  The beer was wonderful.  I ordered an Eclipse which is Blue Moon & Guiness which sounds kind of nasty, but it is soooo good.  Very smooth.  Also discovered two new favorites, Purple Haze (rasberry wheat) & Sea Dog Bluepaw Wheat (Blueberry wheat).  Wheat beer lovers DREAM.  Loved it.  Will come back for food one of these days!
Downsides:
Thought it was weird that they had to get the manager to check my ID because I was from out of state.  Whatever.  Also didn't like that they charged a dollar for their beer samples.  Who does that? The inside was a little dark too- need a little light to eat your food?  sit outside."}
{"text":"My friends took me to this place for a pre-birthday celebration.   I loved everything from the drinks to the food to the big booths we sat in.  The waitress was very friendly and accomodating and I ate my food, my friends' food and dessert.  Yum.  Yum. 

I will definitely go back to this spot!  :-)"}
{"text":"The best food in West Gate. Highly recommend the jambalaya, and the carnitas quesadilla."}
{"text":"We came for dinner on a Thursday night around 7pm. We were promptly seated and waited on by Cebal (I think that was his name). He took our beer flight orders, our apps and main course orders at the same time. Our appetizers came to the table minutes before our beer orders. The food here is always good as is the beer. For our main course we ordered the fried gnocchi. I'm certain it's a good dish, it was probably just something neither of us liked.  We decided that we weren't going to take it home but had no problem paying for it. When Cebal brought our check he told us that he would take the gnocchi off our check. Wasn't expecting that. We will be back as we have had some great food. Great beer and great service."}
{"text":"This is our DEFAULT happy hour.
I won't be reviewing their dinner as I have never had an actual meal there.

I'm not really a beer drinker, but they have such a big selection, I always find something i like. And I've been told they have a martini specials, but you don't go to a beer place and get martinis... come on.

Pretty much their entire appetizer selection (which is what, 20 items?) is on the half price happy hour menu. You know what that means? Four sliders and fries for FOUR dollars. (Also recommended... Hawaiian Poke Stack).

In summary, I can wrap up Yard House in two words.
Heck. Yes."}
{"text":"I think the ambiance leaves a lot to be desired, but the food was really surprisingly good. And the beer selection is great. When we went it was pretty empty and that definitely ruins the vibe when you are there to watch sports. But we were really happy with everything else!"}
{"text":"Over 700 other reviews, what can I say? We came we saw, we ate. Massive menu. Great, knowledgable staff. Didn't care to see 5 or 6 servers all surrounding one computer terminal chatting, but ah well. 

My wife enjoyed a southerwestern salad, while I ate an ahi steak sandwich for the first time. Nothing wrong with the meals. Service was fine too. I don't know what it is but the \"it factor\" is missing to would warrent a five star rating. Don't get me wrong the place is fine and recommendable. Other than trying something different on the menu, I don't really see a reason to return... yet."}
{"text":"I have only been there once to get some pizza. And Oh My... They have some delucious pizzas there!! I haven't tried any other dishes there but I will for sure!"}
{"text":"This is the Caesar kale salad. One with medium rare steak and one with ahi. They are both so delicious. We decided to add avocado. Great service. Will be back."}
{"text":"We stoped here for lunch. Food was very good. Service was very good. They have a large menu for both food and drinks. Lots of TVs and great sports atmosphere. Check it out if your in Vegas."}
{"text":"I'm a fan because Yard House has vegan options.  The service was good.  The food was average good.  I'm not a beer drinker, and neither are my 2 lunch companions, but we chose to eat here because of the veggie burger, and other vegan options.  Wish we could have eaten outside, but it was full and we didn't want to wait."}
{"text":"We have been 3 or 4 times since moving here 3 months ago and the food and service has been excellent every time. Great location! It is a tad pricey but good for date night. Would definitely recommend and try the Hawaiian Mule!"}
{"text":"If you are vegan: come eat here! I have been to this location multiple times and had different servers each time. The second I mention any sort of dietary restrictions they immediately take care of me. Each server has gone the extra length to check ingredients in anything I order. To top it off, everything has always been delicious! Today we had Pierre as our server and he was excellent and very attentive to our needs. Thank you for making one happy vegan!"}
{"text":"Really cool atmosphere,  awesome beer selection,  and good food.     This was only our second visit,  but I'll be sure to try another location next time the opportunity presents itself."}
{"text":"Amazing place! Where has it been all my life? I was visiting Vegas this past week for my cousin's wedding and my boyfriend and I couldn't find a place open past ten with reasonable food! So, we went to Margaritaville around the corner, which was only serving apps, and were told to check out the new places nearby The LinQ.

Wow, this place was brand new (only open three days at the time), had outrageously delicious food, had an amazing view of the gigantic Ferris wheel from the patio...I could really just go on and on. 

If you go, sit on the upstairs patio. 

If you like cider, try the pineapple!

My bf had a great steak and I ordered the Thai Noodle Salad. It was amazing and I wish the nearest Yard House was closer than Orlando (I live in Tampa, FL). I'd probably go once a week for sure."}
{"text":"Bad waitress talking very rude to me when I asked her for order and check.  She ignored me and only talked to the guy with me like I didn't exist. How condescending and inappropriate for professional place. I'm in customer service too. I'd never treat anyone like that. And How rude flirting with my guy when I'm right there next to him."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I am not a huge beer drinker, but the selection was outstanding. I was impressed with the volume of beer choices. Having said that, two of the people in our party, who had identical cocktails, asked for them to be remade.  The waiter, probably just doing his job, said the drink would be made exactly the same way, which seemed odd to me as a guy who bar tended for over 15 years, but it got worse. The waiter asked the bartender and the bartender agreed, the drink is what it is. No attempt to fix it for either one was made. On top of that, we waited over 10 minutes for our bill at midnight on a sloooow Friday night this past weekend. Surprisingly enough when the bill did arrive, it was separated and gratuity was included on all tabs. That is a real gamble. I have never seen it done when the service was good, only when it was marginal or worse. After 15+years in the industry, I would say, maybe it was a bad night....but I am apprehensive about a return visit."}
{"text":"Now dont get me wrong with the 3 stars....I love the Yardhouse and have been to several both here in Vegas and all over SoCo.

The food at the Yardhouse is always right on target all across the menu. I am a total beer snob so the few actual real beers they server are my main  reason for coming here which brings me to my 3 stars.
WHERE are the rest of the beers? This location has the smallest selection out of all the locations I have been to...its a disappointment. Most people are like \"oohhhhh look at all the beers\"..and get the same couple of lame ass beers time and again but I like to swtich it up.

The happy hour rocks of course and is only time to go have a few.

All in all..I love the Yardhouse..this is just one of their weaker locations."}
{"text":"Went to this location yesterday for Happy Hour! The crab cakes were very good! The lite Cosmo was made perfectly! Very good selection of appetizers half off during happy hour. Just wish it lasted until 7 or later ;)"}
{"text":"Cute atmosphere.  Always busy when we go.  Gardein selection for vegetarians like myself ;)"}
{"text":"Candice is a very good server! The food is just as good. I had the chicken strips with maple honey mustard (so yummy!) & fries, and my son had the vegan burger with fries; he said that it was very good. Great atmosphere, friendly staff, and lots of seating. Wish I had had room for the strawberry shortcake! We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Yeah I like it here. A lot. 

I've gone to Yard House about 4 times now. 

Always get the chicken nacho's, you get a TON of food, 3 people could easily share this. 

Beer selection is just awesome. 

But my favorite part, the atmosphere. A cool, trendy vibe. Perfect for a night out."}
{"text":"How can you go wrong with that many Beers to choose from and MMMM I love their Poke stack, Spicy Tuna Roll, and last but not least Mac and Cheese."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner one evening with some friends and absolutely loved it! It was our first time eating here and I'm glad we did . It was St.Patricks Weekend so it got really busy in there but we were seated within 30mins. We ended up ordering 3 orders of the Lumpia because it was so good and disappeared fast :) I had mac and cheese with chicken and bacon, that was very good! Hubby had a cheeseburger, as did my kiddos. Our server was great too, Although i don't remember her name. We would def return to our next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Great beer but the driest Corned Beef on the planet.  Almost inedible but I managed to down some.  What the hell makes you appreciate a home cooked meal.  Besides what do you expect for a dish that they serve 4 days out of the year.  Stick to the Poke Nachos.

The manager came to our table and asked how things where.  I let her know about the corned beef and she removed it from our bill. Definitely was not expecting that.  What great service."}
{"text":"A bit of a letdown really. I love the whole brew pub type concept (this isn't a brew pub, but they have an extensive menu and a ton of beers on tap), but I am not a big fan of chains. In this case, we had tickets to a comedy show near here, and were in the mood for a pint and some sort of fall food. In researching, we found that they had a bunch of stouts/porters, and had a grilled cheese/tomato soup on the menu. Done!
We anticipated a wait for a table, but when we got there, we had to wait a good 5 minutes to get our name in. In hindsight, I should have just gotten my phone out and called from right in front of the desk. Two of the girls at the desk spent the entire time dealing with another customer and ignoring us. Another lady tried to cut in front so I piped up, and finally got acknowledged. The wait for a table was only maybe 10-15 minutes which was reasonable. 
Once seated, it did take a little while to be acknowledged by the server, and it did take an abnormally long time to actually get the beer I ordered. 
We ordered the sweet potato fries for a starter, which never came because the server admitted that she never rang it in.  Same with the French onion soup that my old lady ordered with her meal. This seemed quite odd because we ordered everything at the same time.  We decided to skip the fries by that point since we already had our meals, but my girlfriend's street taco plate was pretty sparse so she wanted her soup. The soup did come quickly. 
Her food was good, but again there was very little for what we paid. My grilled cheese and tomato soup was very good.
So I am not entirely sure we will be back. The food was good but pricey and the service was spotty. I should mention that this was on a night where there was no hockey game, so the apparent understaffing of the servers is disappointing. 
I almost forgot to mention. Their beer menu online is much more extensive that at the actual restaurant. They list about 25-30 \"darks\" (meaning porters and stouts) online, but had about 10 at the restaurant. I was torn between a few options and thankfully they let me sample 2 beers before deciding. I really wish I could have customized my own flight they way they do at Des Schuttes in Portland or Uncle Bear's in ahwatukee. But the only flights you can do are already pre packaged for you.  Oh well.  With a big selection, I would have loved to do a taste test of my own."}
{"text":"We've eaten at this location twice now. Overall, the staff is friendly, food is good, great happy hour deals.
I LOVE the Moo Shu Egg Rolls. I would return just for these! They have tons of flavor and the dipping sauce is awesome. The fried Mac & cheese is decent, not the best I've had, but not the worst. They came out extremely hot and fresh. I wish we would have skipped the margarita pizza. It was relatively cold and had very little flavor - not worth the price. I would definitely return to try some other appetizers and entrees!"}
{"text":"The service is top notch.  The food is awesome and perfectly presented. The atmosphere is just how I like it, great music and lively."}
{"text":"The Yard House in Westgate was packed at 2pm on a Saturday but a good time was had by all.  

We all sat at the bar and were treated to exceptional service and comedic relief by Jeriod, who reminded us of Howie Mandel.   The drink recommendations were awesome and hit the spot.  

The Mr. Pineapple beer was refreshing, light and perfectly sour and I finished the meal with a Youngberry which was a Framboise lambic cut with a chocolate stout.  It was so sweet and smooth that it tasted like a dessert.  

The food is always good but paired with drinks, great service and our best buds made it an all around wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"First off, you can get to this place without setting foot inside the casino. That's always a plus for me.

Secondly, they have beer....lots of it. If it's overwhelming to you, ask the bartender and they'll always suggest something to try.

Food is tasty and presented nicely. I typically get a sandwich. I'm a sandwich connoisseur, and they make a mean roast beef on garlic toast that is always tasty. 

My girlfriend says the grilled cheese is the best ever. Not the kid style, American cheese between two pieces of Wonder bread, but 3 kinds of cheese melted between artisan bread served with a tomato bisque that is quite tasty too. A classic combo."}
{"text":"yeah, I'll throw my 2 cents in...
I was here on a Saturday evening around 7 pm and it was PACKED. 40 minute wait for a table for 2, not terrible but I should have made reservations.
Got right up to the bar and after glancing at a line of drafts 30 foot long, I ordered something I was familiar with because there was no way I was going to try and look at each one and look like a complete tool...anyway the bar service was fast.
We ended up getting sat outside, which we didn't ask for but hey, I was starving so we sat, ordered and food got there in decent time. I ordered the beef dip and is was phenomenal. I got the salad instead of fries and it was actually pretty good. I was expecting iceburg lettuce with an under ripe cherry tomato but it was much better than that.
All in all, I'd go back just to sample the beer and grab that beef dip again. I take a star off because it felt too touristy for me...I'm more of a locals only dude"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good beer selection, come here. They have 110 draft beers to choose from, including their own specialty brands.  The display of beers is pretty amazing. 

Overall they are basically your regular bar food kind of place, but the boneless wings were really good. It looked like they served fairly LARGE portions so be cautious of how much food you order!!  The couple next to us ordered nachos, wings and onion rings and it could have fed a family of six!!"}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour with some friends and was not disappointed!

I ordered the Hawaiian Poke Stack which consisted of shredded carrots and ginger, piled onto the poke which was stacked on top of crispy wontons with a side of sliced avocados. It was very delicious but I still prefer the tradition ahi poke with the bits of nori and chopped onions. The portion was kind of small especially for $13! But thank God it was happy hour. 

My friend ordered the chicken nachos which is more than enough for 1 person. You need like 3 people to help you finish it. The nachos were very crispy and warm and loaded with cheese, tomatoes, beans, salsa and guacamole on the side. We didn't even finish the whole thing, that's how big it was. 

Overall the atmosphere is great, service is great and the food is great. They also have a huge selection of beer :) this is definitely a good get-together spot."}
{"text":"I don't know where to begin. We came to celebrate my husband's birthday and could not have chosen a better place! This is our favourite place to come to celebrate. The food is always amazing and the atmosphere is superb. It is a reflection of how Antwone (manager) runs his place. Antwone is phenomenal and attentive to his customers. Kevin, our server, was great, knowledgable, and on top of everything.  Thank you Antwone and Kevin for treating us like family. It was a wonderful celebration!"}
{"text":"Came expecting this to be a typical bar-first chain, and was very pleasantly surprised at the superb quality of the food. The service and atmosphere was great, and I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. I hadn't been to this Yard House in a few years and has the opportunity to take my son who has never been. I kept raving about how much he'll enjoy it. When we got there the place was busy, always a good sign. But when the food came, what a let down! I ordered the fried chicken. The batter and chicken were ok but there was NO flavor. I had to add lots of salt and pepper (which, by the way, we had to ask for because none of the tables have salt and pepper). The side vegetables were about 3 tablespoons each, and the mashed potatoes were dry and unimpressive wiith bits of corn and spinach in it. The gravy, if that's what is was, tasted like watery buttermilk with parsley in it.  My son ordered the sliders and I was shocked to see that they looked exactly like the White Castle burgers you pop in the microwave. I think that's what they served him. The buns were stale. Shame on you Yard House! A $50 meal that was way below average. I could have done better cooking at home."}
{"text":"Everything on the table last night was very well executed!  Most impressive was the Poke tuna appetizer"}
{"text":"Their happy hour is amazing! a bit loud but that's normal for a bar restaurant!"}
{"text":"This place is always crowded.  It seems as though TownSquare is the new hip spot at the moment as I write this.  Plenty of beers to choose from.  I probably haven't heard of 70% of the beers on the list.  The food's pretty good, and the prices are decent.  It would be a lot better if there weren't so many people, but I guess that's how it goes now."}
{"text":"I've been here several times but I decided to write a review today because the service was so good. I came in by myself and sat at the bar. I had the blue crab cakes (which I always get because they are amazing) and the poke nachos (which were kinda meh). That's the only problem I have with this place. Some things on the menu are amazing.... And some are \"meh.\" The service is usually good but Casey, my bartender today, was the best. He remembered my name throughout my entire meal even though it seemed really busy. That was really nice because a lot of times when dine by yourself you get forgotten about. He checked on me several times and did everything in a timely manner. Seriously great service."}
{"text":"Yum to the Yum. I've been here a couple times, and it never disappoints. The food is fresh and the staff are exceptional. The restaurant is clean and the atmosphere is great. One of my favorite restaurants in Desert Ridge. The s'mores dessert is amazingly delicious. My last visit I ate the French dip, which was also very good. All the other dishes and drinks at our group table, looked great as well. No complaints to be heard. Keep up the great work. Your other locations I've tried are also great, it seems there is a consistent standards amongst all Yard Houses. A place to return again and again. Yum"}
{"text":"I've been torn on how to review this.  Part of me wants to give it a two, another part a 4... so settling on 3, blah.  

Pros: Pretty nice set up and large atmosphere.  Service was surprisingly very, very good, and we had a very attentive server and the food didn't take a long time to come out.  Bathrooms had awesome motion sensor doors.  Phenomenal beer selection.  Good variety of pescetarian and vegetarian options.  

Cons: Overall, not very impressed with the food in relation to the price, which is what really brings the score down in my opinion.  We got a kale and Caesar salad, clam chowder, chicken fingers with fries, and sword fish tacos.  All of the food we got was adequate, but far from anything that I'd come back for, and certainly not good enough to be priced at the level it was.  

If you're going here for drinks, probably a great place to go, especially for beer.  If you're going primarily for food, you won't have a bad experience, but in my opinion it's nothing special at all."}
{"text":"Korean BBQ tacos, fish taco style. 

Get in my mouth. 

I love you.


Server yapping in the bathroom to her boyfriend. 
I don't love you."}
{"text":"Sometimes you take a Bikram yoga class, almost die, and then need respite. Sometimes you sweat out all the toxins out of your body and then immediately go put things way worse than you have been eating for a long time back into your body because you were just in an oven for 90 minutes trying to contort your body. Sometimes you go to Yard House because your friend has a gift certificate and all you want is nachos. 

Yes, I took a Bikram yoga class and replenished my body by not drinking a protein shake or eating something with nutritional value but by coming to Yard House and ordering a cider and happy hour nachos. I'm cool. The nachos were delicious and I usually am not a big meat eater but I snarfed the chicken nachos like it was my last meal on earth, and since I was coming from Bikram, Satan could have been coming for me, I'll never know. 

One complaint: flat, gross cider. I know it's not that popular of a drink but you gotta change out that keg. It was alright though--it forced me to drink water instead of alcohol in my deflated post-Bikram state. 

All in all, I would not recommend nullifying your workout by eating here, but it was delicious and I don't regret it one ounce."}
{"text":"Amazing Gardein options! Thank you, thank you, thank you for yummy vegan options! BBQ wings were the bomb!"}
{"text":"Our waiter Stephen was AMAZING, he made sure we were always attended, he made sure my nephews were always good made sure our drinks were always filled he even treated my nephews to ice cream once they were done with their food!! Hope to be going soon again:)"}
{"text":"The food here was okay. Had a variety of choices. The Rueben was probably the best of the things we had. Great beer selection........if you can get service. The servers were inattentive and argued over not taking tables. A table of ten came in and the whole server staff disappeared. You could here them in the back arguing because nobody wanted to serve it. It would be a great place for drinks if the service wasn't so bad."}
{"text":"Got a chicken caesar salad. It was good, nothing spectacular. 
Been many times before. Love the selection of cider beer. 

AMAZING dessert. I got a creme brulee and a butterscotch pudding dessert. The creme brulee came with sugar crusted bananas and a chocolate bottom. The butterscotch pudding was not overpoweringly sweet. The salt balanced nicely, so it wasn't too much of anything."}
{"text":"EPIC selection of draft beer. That makes a German heart jump :) Also, very cosy (in a modern way) and friendly staff. 

Loved the onion ring tower and the vegan seletion (Mom's a vegan). The burger I had was well-sized and great American quality. 

Absolutely recommend that place to people visiting the Strip."}
{"text":"It's was just okay, I was a bit underwhelmed. The beer list was long but nothing special for a northeast Ohio place and the food was just ok, it had potential, but didn't really deliver on what the description stated.  Not sure if I would come back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants. Always great service, especially when Chelsea is our server, and delicious food. Sashimi is sooo good and awesome burgers."}
{"text":"This restaurant at the LINQ offers a decent range of vegan food with gardein chick'n and it is a big plus for a vegan like me! I had vegan Orange Peel Chicken and it was really good; serves with super thin fried sweet potato spirals, broccoli, and jasmin or brown rice. They also have a really long list of beers along with cocktails, wines, and ciders. 

The only thing about this place is that it is very dark inside and it can be crowded so it is helpful to reserve your spot by calling ahead before heading over there."}
{"text":"We go to the Yard House at the Red Rock and we've been to the LINQ Yard House and we've been to this town square yard house location and the food is usually very good and the service is usually fine but I must write tonight about this unbelievable waiter we had name Shaun and I really think he needs to be recognized for how great, sweet and attentive he is. He is beyond what he needs to be. My food  ended up being overdone and he couldn't have been more apologetic and sweet and just went out of his way to make the entire meal wonderful from beginning to end
 if you can clone this person and have  everyone be like him you would have 0 problems. Oh and the manager there was very apologetic as well she went out of her way to make things okay and my cup didnt  go empty for 2 seconds.  they had people filling the drinks. it's just really good service here better than any other Yard House I've been to"}
{"text":"Great place.  We sat at the bar and our servers/bartenders was great! We had Tori and Britney both were sweethearts.  They were attentive and the food was good.  I had the miso seabass and it was on point.  Most servers here in vegas are consistently nice compared to our area(md) ."}
{"text":"I've tried most of the watering holes and food joints in and around Town Square.  Of course, it is always a hit and miss.  I've tried Miller's Ale House on the opposite side of the outdoor mall also and I can say that Yard House is, hands down, way better than Ale House - in so many levels.  Am not a big fan of chain or franchised restaurants and tend to be very judgmental of them.  

My friend was starving after watching the most recent Superman movie at the Rave, or AMC Theaters.  I blamed my friend for choosing Ale House the last time because that was just a waste of a hard earned money so we went to Yard House which is literally a few steps away from the cinema.  I wasn't very happy of the choice, but hey, I might as well give it a try. 

We were quickly seated and drinks were served in a flash.  I ordered their Spicy Jambalaya with linguini instead of rice, and my friend ordered their Parmesan Crusted Chicken.   My review is based on the food that I pig out on.  My friend liked the chicken too, more than the pork medallion (actually pork schnitzel) from Ale House.  

We didn't wait long for our entrees.  The Jambalaya pasta came tolerably hot.  Good servings, if I may add.  It was reasonably seasoned.  Not that spicy as I was expecting but there sure was some kind of a bite and kick because of the paprika, cheyenne pepper and cajun seasonings.  The dish was perfectly tossed in cajun sauce generously packed with small shrimps, roasted red and green peppers, fresh tomatoes, slivers of andouille sausage and topped with two grilled huge shrimps (mini prawns).  I remember having Jambalaya pasta from Cheesecake Factory and Claim Jumpers decades ago and I thought they were good, but Yard House's is better.  

We liked the way our server/waitress didn't bother us every 5 minutes or so asking how everything was.   We were left to enjoy and savor our food, and only came when necessary (refilling our drinks, clearing up our table and bringing in the check).  Suffice to say, i finished my plate and was happy with it.  Total damage for me was $25.00.  A bit pricey for a pasta dish but considering the ambience and the service, it wasn't that bad."}
{"text":"Worst service ever and I'll NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN!!!! It took them an hour to bring me ONE BEER and when my food finally came it was cold and maybe it's because it took them two hours to bring my food to the table!! Never will I ever come here again!!"}
{"text":"Consistent food, drink and service! Great go to spot. The only negative is their fried food is always cold. 
Great snack food and the Kung pow calamari is really good. Black Velvet is a staple drink as well. BBQ chicken salad is good...."}
{"text":"So...had another date night with my favorite paid male escort.  He has a huge....appetite. He's not a cheap date. We got there right before last call for food.  We got Calle (like the state Cali, not the street in Spanish) who was very accommodating at the last minute, got us everything we needed. Basically, she was awesome and we are going to ask for her again! 

Let's talk turkey. Actually, that is about the only thing my paid male escort for the evening did NOT get. It was happy hour. Happy hour means (usually) small plates so you better order a bunch at the Yard House this is NOT true. You get normal sized meals at happy hour prices. There was so much food in our table that I couldn't get all of it in the photo. 

Let's just start off easy. I had a Bikini Tini. Loved it. Cheese curds. (I had them before and have fantasized about them since, don't tell anyone but at one point I was looking at photos of them on the Internet as though there were illicit adult content.) Loved those.  Okay, now to know me is to know I love dessert. I am a fat kid who loves cake. Well I had the SALTED CARAMEL BUTTERSCOTCH PUDDING. Um. Foodgasm, anyone? If you happen to be lonely and can't afford the paid male escort of the evening like I can, come here, get this dessert, it's almost better. I can say TOP 5 DESSERTS OF MY LIFE!

My escort he got...everything. No not everything... He got deviled eggs. Not his favorite, he said they were fancy. He's used to my plain old mayo and egg version, theirs had horseradish, cumin and had salsa and bacon on it. He had sliders. Okay they are good, but come on, this is a burger cut in quarters! Nice try YH, but you can't fool me! French Onion Soup. He said it was good but needed more salt. He got wings, he said they were hot and didn't want them to touch his lips. He got fries and had canon seasoning put on...I like my fries plain.  But I wanted to try a couple and 50 fries later, yup, you guessed it they were quite tasty... And he also got a buffalo chicken pizza. We boxed that to bring home. It looked good but we haven't tasted it yet.  He also got two margaritas and a coke. All expertly made/poured. 

And now we are at home wondering why did he get all that food? If you kept a tally...

3 alcoholic drinks
1 soda
1 cheese curd 
1 pizza
1 cup of soup
1 order of 10 wings
1 order of sliders
1 side of fries
1 order of deviled eggs
1 cup of French onion soup
1 dessert

Bill total:  $71.08.  SHUT THE FRONT DOOR! I have paid more at other places that are terrible. Spend your money wisely YH is where you can get a good meal! AND if you like beer 130 are in tap. 

Remember salted caramel butterscotch pudding."}
{"text":"I love this place, but if you are going to check it out I recommend going for happy hour. They have a couple hundred beers on tap which is their most attractive quality, however, if you don't go during happy hour you can end up paying $6 for a pint. If you are a beer lover like myself, and you have not been here yet, you need to stop in!"}
{"text":"Love the Yard House. Service is great and it's convenient to get to from my hotel. A disappointment on this visit is the absence of the fried gnoki dish that I sampled before.   Apparently it's off the menu. Color me Disappointed."}
{"text":"This brand new Yard House was awesome.  We are here twice on our recent trip to Las Vegas.  For our first meal we were here for lunch.  I had a half turkey club sandwich and a cup of French onion soup.  (Chris D. don't go out of your way for this soup).  The club was huge even for one half, but the soup was lacking flavor, and topped with a soggy piece of wonder bread.  My husband got the chicken avocado sandwich with truffle fries.  He was quite happy with his meal.  The bloody Mary's that we both had were amazing.

We came back the next day for a pre concert dinner.  We had the chicken egg rolls with a spicy peanut dipping sauce, and I had to go for my favorite ahi crunchy salad.  It was as good as ever.  That is one thing I like about Yard House, it is usually very consistent.  

Our servers were very attentive, and well trained.  If I only had one thing to offer, it would be to kill the speakers on the outside patio.  The music from YH competes with the music coming from the Linq entertainment center. It can be very annoying to constantly be hearing two songs playing at the same time."}
{"text":"Timmermans Framboise, oh my :)
It has been, in all honesty, the only raspberry flavored anything I've ever loved! 
I paired it with some adult mac 'n cheese, which sounds weird, but was crazy right. 
The mac 'n cheese was delicious with it's mix of cheddar & parmesan, just the right amount of chicken to make it filling & bacon.... it could have done with more bacon, but isn't that true for nearly everything?"}
{"text":"So much beer to choose from and i love how much food options they have. Burgers, pizza, pasta, steak, sushi, and even a gardein section; they have it all and it's all very good. We came on a Friday night and it was packed. We were told we would have to wait 45 minutes for a table and was seated in 20 which was awesome. If you can definitely come during happy hour!"}
{"text":"This place is ok, has a lot of beers so it has that going for it. I came here with a couple friends on a Sunday because I was near desert ridge and we ordered a couple beers, some shots, and some appetizers. As I stated above the selection of beers was the best as the shots are brought in these little plastic thimbles and seem like you are getting half a shot. The service is pretty good but the food is just ok at best.. Their poutine isn't all that, and maybe I am spoiled because I have had poutine in Canada but still I think they can do a bit better. The wings are ok, and the cheese curds are about the same as you can get at Applebee's. The staff and the beer is the saving grace and why this place gets 3 stars instead of 1."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Yard House.  There are so many drinks to select from, even though I always stick with my wine when I go there. Staff is awesome. The host that showed us to our table was so kind. He chatted the entire way talking about how his day was. 
It is usually pretty packed so I would make a reservation or get there a little bit early to grab a table. Its really loud especially when there is a sports game on so I would not recommend going if you are taking a date there and would like to hear her!  
I always order the mushroom lettuce wraps with Tofu.  It is an appetizer but fills me up like an entree. Pricey are very reasonable including drink prices! 

Our service has always been right on point.  Making sure everything is great, getting out food and drinks in a timely manner and always having a smile on their faces!"}
{"text":"I ordered through postmates and asked for the vegan version of the orange chicken. I was very specific with what I wanted and ended up receiving regular chicken, which I cannot eat. I had no idea whether my order was vegan or not so I gave the restaurant a call to see if they could let me know if this was something I could eat or not. The manager was really understanding and made me what I actually ordered, I went to go pick it up and they gave it to me no charge for the inconvenience. The manager's kindness really made my day. Thank you for the great customer service."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is always good and the service is excellent.  

Things we have tried and love:
Onion Ring Tower
Mac and Cheese
Chicken Parmesan 
Mini Trio Dessert Platter
S'mores Brownie

We have been to the Tatum Plaze (Desert Ridge) location several times and have never had an issue.  The place can get pretty busy, but they usually move through the crowds quickly and there is a waiting area up front if you need it.

There are tons of beer options and the menu is varied for any taste or picky eater!

We personally enjoy the outdoor seating area.  In the summer it's a bit toasty out there, but the views and people watching can make it worth it.  Plus, every server we have had out there has always taken care of us!"}
{"text":"This location is a part of the mall, and can be accessed where the valet drop off area is. They are a fairly large location for the space, and have plenty of seats for just about any group size. 

We headed in for a later lunch and even on weekends they have good lunch deals offered up. The truffle burger was very tasty and the fries were good as usual. Our waitress was very friendly and checked back on us often.

Sitting outside was fun since there is a TON going on out there and it makes for a dinner and show vibe. The downside is that this is the valet drop off site, so it also means that you get fumes and loud noises pretty regularly while eating. 

Overall: A-
Good lunch deals, especially for the area, and service was friendly and quick! If you sit outside, be aware that it can get loud."}
{"text":"Was there 2 weeks ago, late on a Friday.  To be completely honest, the food service was sub par.  Drinks were forgotten about, food came out sporadically, and overall the servers seemed overwhelmed.  Why still the 4 stars?  Because despite everything going wrong, the manager came up and insisted on making things right.  We never complained or said anything was wrong, but instead a very astute manager noticed, and would not take no for an answer when asking if there was anything she could do.  

The exact kind of service that will make us come back time and time again!"}
{"text":"Good food and drinks. Service was a little slow on Friday night, but overall it was a good dining experience."}
{"text":"We eat here frequently even though it's about a 25 min drive from our house. Last night we drove here, around midnight, to pick up two orders of shiitake garlic noodles since I'm 7 months pregnant and it's the only thing I wanted to eat. I was disappointed to find no chives in the either of the noddles. This has become a pet peeve of mine since they seem to forget on to go orders more often than not. Also, sometimes they don't include utensils on to go orders or the food is not packaged securely. Because of this, I don't tip on to go orders from here. A little more attention to detail would be greatly appreciated."}
{"text":"We went here to celebrate the May 5th holiday since every single Mexican place was packed but anyways.  I knew that this was one of the upgraded bar restaurants in town so coming in with not a whole lot of high expectations for anything you can't find much other places.  

Ordered fish tacos and a sashimi appetizer which was really good with a fat cut of tuna but otherwise,  it seemed like I could get it anywhere else although I ordered it in a combo and had to chase down the beans and rice that were supposed to come with it.  Wife had two margaritas that were not bad but overall,  kind of overpriced for stuff you can find lots of other places.  

I will give it to Chad our server that the service was impeccable and he was on the ball when it came to any issues or problems.  Not sure if I want to go back or to the other ones either."}
{"text":"Always have a great time here . The staff is wonderful and the food is excellent .  I wish more servers were this friendly and helpful ."}
{"text":"I LOVE their Macaroni and cheese. June bug drink is so delicious. Casual yet fancy. Awesome place for any occasion."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the Yard House, so when I saw that there was a location at the Desert Ridge Mall, I had to stop by for lunch.  I ordered some Sliders & Fries and a pint of Green Flash IPA:

The Sliders & Fries were pretty good.  You get a stack of 4 Sliders and a pile of Fries.  The IPA went down smooth with the meal...yum!

Was there during lunch hour on a Saturday, so the wait was short dining at the bar alone.  One of the best things about dining at the bar is that your glass is never empty.....

Return Factor - 90%"}
{"text":"Have been at our local Yard house Desert Ridge thought why not? Well service at bar was terrible. They ignored us for about  2-3 minutes. Then when we ordered our food we ordered a snack first then a sandwich. The sandwich came no snack half way thru the snack shows up. Now we tell them no thanks you would think asked them to kill someone attitude from that person and bartender. 
If you don't like your job leave."}
{"text":"Our food was great and we had a nice server. She helped us decide drinks and food selection.

There portions are always big so we left full to go watch a movie. We didn't even have to hit the concession stand up."}
{"text":"Mom and I stopped by for lunch the other day.  She ordered the Hawaiian Poke Stack Appetizer ($11.65), I had the Chicken Nachos ($10.35).....the waitress convinced me to have a Stone Ruination IPA ($6.25)....kidding, I didn't need any convincing.

The food came out fast.  Mom enjoyed the Poke Stack, it's one of her favorite dishes here.  The Chicken Nachos had a lot of potential....half of the Chips tasted stale...you know, when it has the texture of Licorice....anyway, the part of my Nachos with the stale Chips were awful, the part of my Nachos with fresh Chips was awesome.  Seriously, it was night and day.  Dammit Yard House.

The Stone Ruination IPA made it all better though....yummy!

Overall, it was an OK lunch.  Could have been better.

Will I return?  I'm sure I will."}
{"text":"Yard house has always been a favorite for me and my husband. Every visit we've had has always been great. Service and wait staff never let us down and are always so nice. The food is always delicious and makes us happy we came. And the portions are always worth the price. I remember on my last visit I ordered a side Cesar salad. I was impressed with the fact it wasn't some small basic overpriced plate you usually see with some other places. We also love the fact that it's open late."}
{"text":"I am giving 4stars for excellent beer selection, good food and service. The location is good, but parking is a pain since it is in a mall. Offering beers in 3 sizes is a great idea because I can try a few in the 9 oz. size.

The only negative was when we checked in, with a 9 month old in tow, a guy walked with a pitbull-type of dog and was allowed in. Really, a dog in a restaurant? When I asked about it, the hostess said \"well it could be a service dog and it is against the law to ask\".  It would funny if it wasn't so disgusting."}
{"text":"Good food but the service at the bar was extremely poor, the bartenders were very rude, never asked how the food was or if I wanted another drink. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Servers were great. Friendly, knowledgeable. Food was ok. Cheese curds were awesome! The horse radish/ranch sauce, not so much. Mac-n-cheese was decent, nothing fantastic. Not a big fan of the carnitas enchilada stack. A little over priced for food. We maybe go again for a lunch special or something & try something different."}
{"text":"Great lamb burger and sweet fries. Nice selection of beers. Kinda reminds me of The Chimes. Great service and very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Until last night's visit to the Yardhouse I was a big fan....now, I'm not so sure, here's why.

A good friend and his fiance were visiting from California and wanted to get together for dinner & drinks.  Since Town Square is located on the Strip, it was a convenient place for us to meet.  Over the past few weeks I've been drinking a lot of IPA's and Chimay and was telling him that the Yardhouse would be a great place for him to give them a try.  Since they don't have a Yardhouse where he lives in California, we were all very excited.

The Better Half and I met them at the Yardhouse.  It was pretty packed for a Sunday evening but we were able to find 4 spots at the bar in the corner so we could face each other and get seated immediately.  After browsing the beer menu, we decided on a Stone IPA.....the bartender said they no longer had it.  Ok, how about the Long Hammer IPA?  Nope...no longer carry it.  He proceeded to tell me they only had 1 or 2 of the IPA's on the menu because they are in the process of switching out the menu......what?  WTF is that?  I understand changing out the menu, but not being able to offer what you have listed until you make the change.....that's BS!  Especially for a place that claims to have 100's of beers on tap!  Ok.....well, if that's the case we asked for a Chimay Triple....guess what?  They didn't have any!

At this point I was a little embarrassed because I hyped up this place as a solid \"go to\" place to enjoy new brews and good food.  We settled for a Ranger IPA and called it a day.

For food we ordered Hot Wings, 4 Cheese Pizza, Jambalaya, and Sliders.  The Pizza was very soggy, even though I ordered it well done....that's the second time we've had Pizza and it come out soggy....we won't order it again.  The rest of the food was good, but not great.

Overall, it was a disappointing night at the Yardhouse.  There are tons of places in Vegas that serve good bar food, but came here specifically for beers that were not available....and that's suppose to set them apart from the rest.  I hope this was an anomaly and not the beginning of a trend."}
{"text":"BEWARE vegans and vegetarians their french fries is NOT vegetarian like it says on the menu. They cook it on the same oil as the meat."}
{"text":"Whenever we go to a Coyotes game or a concert @ Jobing.com Arena, we stop by this location to grab some grub and pre-game Brewskies.  If you plan to come here pre-game, be prepared for a long wait.  We average 30-45 min every time we come here before a game.

What can I say about Yard House that hasn't already been said?  I love their Beer selection and food.

My favorite dish is of course the Sliders ($10.85).  When they have it, I get the Green Flash IPA ($7) to wash it down.

Overall, it's a great place to be just before a Coyotes game.

Return Factor - 90%"}
{"text":"The Yard House is one of my favorite lunch spots, but last night I came in for a late bite around 9:30/10. We sat on the patio and had horrible service. The waiter acknowledged us as he walked by but then didn't return to take our order for at least 10-15 minutes. When our drinks were brought out, my water was forgotten. Our food came quickly, but the food runner walked away before I could ask for ketchup for my fries or silverware. I received ketchup but I had to ask again twice for silverware. These things seem like the basics. Oh also, someone at our table had something slimly floating in their beer."}
{"text":"Dude, this is the place to come if you're 40+ and want to be a hipster.  It's loud AF in here...I couldn't even hear my date who was sitting next to me.  The way the food looks online is what led me to try this place.  I'm learning looks aren't everything.  Cold onion rings, flavorless pizza, fishy smelling tacos. The crem brûlée was the only redeeming thing about the place.  I might come back just for that...but probably not."}
{"text":"Overpriced average food.... bar was okay .... atmosphere and customer service alone gave them three stars other wise no good"}
{"text":"Good food 
Good beer 
Must go if you want to chillax in a good restrobar
One thing I've noticed or would like if they large single cubes of ice for single malts instead of small multiple cubes...."}
{"text":"It amazes me because it has 118 kinds of beer!  Never have had beer at the restaurant in my life LOL... but tried one here, it turned out great!  The foods are great as well."}
{"text":"Great place to eat close to the Flamingo. The vampire tacos are the bomb! The beer selection is excellent as well. I had a house Belgian white ale which was also very good."}
{"text":"I will start off by saying definitely take advantage of the call ahead seating. We called ahead and maybe waited an extra 20 minutes when we got there. I can not even begin to tell you the amount of people that walked in and walked right back out. 
Second off the beer selection here is out of this world but I'm sure if you are looking to come here you already know that! 
The only reason why I'm giving this 4 stars is when dining here we ordered our entrees only to be told they didn't have what my boyfriend ordered or they had ran out. I mean it was 6:30 on a Saturday night I figured them to have way more prep done so to not run out of a dish on a busy Saturday night. 
We will definitely be back and that in no way hindered our experience here."}
{"text":"Don't bother with this location.  I like the Yard House but pass on the Las Vegas one.  The wait staff is not good.  Every time I go there at fewer and fewer patrons.  They don't know the menu and argue when you order something one way and it comes back different.  Skip it.  Yard House in general is good but not this location."}
{"text":"This area of Glendale is wonderful for hotels, entertainment, shopping and food. We have eaten at Yard House locations in both California (our home) and Arizona. This was our first time at this location and it was excellent. Lots and lots of wonderful food, dessert and beer choices. I LOVE the Mac & Cheese with truffle oil, as well as the Apple Peach Cobbler. I have tried burgers, salads, and many other items over the years and it has consistently been excellent. Love the salad choices, fresh and perfect portion sizes. Prices are fair, quality of food and service is excellent. We visit this area 3-4x yearly and are thrilled to have this new restaurant location to add to our choice list."}
{"text":"Yardhouse has an over the top beer selection. I love Purple Haze and have yet to find it anywhere aside from Sprouts or Sunflower m,arket. well here they have it on tap! I was extatic! I have only gone for lunch, the hummus is to die for and the sweet potato fries are delic. The first time i went i got the bbq burger, i was not a fan, but the beers and appetizers made me come back for more. My second time i got the crispy ahi tuna salad. The dressing was greak the fish tasted as fresh as it can in arizona. The service is great my sister fell hard on a wet floor and we got our meal free and they did everything to make sure she was okay and didnt need to go to the hospital. The only reason they aren't getting a 5-star is that when you sit on the patio you get less attention and the servers do have a kind of \"do not want to be here\" attitude. Love it though and will go back."}
{"text":"Yard House is a good restaurant with good food and drink as long as you don't mind the \"corporate\" atmosphere. I prefer restaurants that have a little less \"corporateness\" about them. I work for a big corporation, so when I get off work and want to go somewhere I don't want to have the same surroundings. 

What I do like about this place is their numerous beers on tap. Come here for happy hour and enjoy some good beers at decent prices. 

I keep searching for things to say in my review of the Yard House, but what comes to mind is the same rating I would give this review: average. 




Would I recommend this place to others? Yes.

Would I come back here myself? Probably."}
{"text":"I've visited various locations of this chain around the country and I simply never come away disappointed. The one drawback of visiting this location for the first time was actually finding it. The complex/development in which it is located is an absolute monster and it was difficult to drive AND look at all the various store signs at the same time. Once inside, we found a spot at the always large bar and were greeted with the information that Happy Hour was still going and encouraged to take advantage of it. Not only did we do so, but even our second round of drinks were billed to us at the Happy Hour discount despite being ordered at least 15-20 minutes beyond its expiration. The Happy Hour was a tremendous value, especially on the food as both the crab cakes and turkey burger sliders were rather tasty and filling. Not only were our bartenders very nice and attentive, I really appreciated how a store manager was extremely active in keeping a very full bar of customers very happy. Happy Hour or not, I'm a loyal customer of any Yard House and wish there was one in the Tampa Bay area I could visit on a regular basis."}
{"text":"As a Yard House apologist, I really love that they have this location in The LINQ Promenade as it saves me a trip to the retail and shopping development a couple miles down Las Vegas Blvd.

The inside is classic Yard House and a nice escape from the normal sights and sounds of the Las Vegas Strip.

There's even a patio that is totally glassed in right off the Promendade walkway to offer a different and quieter vibe.

Happy Hour at all Yard Houses are the way to go and I took advantage of a couple of appetizers after a long day of golf.

The selection, taste and portion size of their sliders on Happy Hour is always good, but their queso dip may have been some of the worst I've had anywhere. 

Also, my service was lacking what I have come to expect from Yard House regardless of whether I'm in Las Vegas, Scottsdale, Chicago or Orlando. I turned down a beer when I was first greeted simply because I was really hungry and wanted to get in a food order, then was never asked again and felt kind of ignored.

And, for the first time at ANY Yard House, a manager never visited me the entire time.

That just gave me an excuse to walk over to the Brooklyn Bowl and have a beer there as their Happy Hour runs an extra hour until 7pm.

This is what I love about Vegas. If you don't get the service you want in one place, there's always another option almost literally a few feet away."}
{"text":"Exceptional service! 

Yard house is a growing chain and I've been to quite a few locations in different states. This was the typical great experience and great food"}
{"text":"Tried the sandwich and soup lunch special.   I did the french dip and it was great and I wished I had ordered the full version.  Clam cowder soup was just ok."}
{"text":"Last night was the cherry on top of a perfect Sunday! A friend and I stumbled into the Yard House (Glendale location) after the Kenny Chesney concert at the Jobing arena for a late night snack. 
Sunday - Thursday The Yard House has a reverse happy hour from 10 - close. This was music to our ears!

After settling into a patio table , we ordered the Hawaiian flat bread pizza and chicken lettuce wraps, both of which were half-price. Having drank all day at the Diamondbacks game, I opted out of a beer - however my friend ordered the Four Peaks peach. I think it is safe to say she like it when she was giggling 2 glasses later! The food came out in a timely manner and both the pizza and warps were to die for! 9 times out of 10 we leave with a to go container, however last night was the exception as we couldn't stop eating! Our entire bill with the pizza, chicken wraps and 2 beers was only $23 with tip! 

Late night snacks will now be a tradition after Coyotes games and concerts!"}
{"text":"Manager Jim runs a tight ship. The food is excellent the service is excellent the staff and training are superb. We were restaurant owners and four of the five years we were open for business we were number one, so we know what it takes to run an excellent restaurant. Be sure and ask for a Christian as your server and sit outside it is worth the trip from up north in Williams just for the food and service."}
{"text":"First and foremost our server Zack from hawaii was beyond awesome. PERSONALITY BEYOND. Very knowledgeable about beer and the food choices. 

The bbq chicken pizza was yummy. The flavors were spotted on. The crust was the best. Chewy and crunchy. 

The only thing was frustrating was signing up for your email club. You also don't earn points for anything. Kind of disappointed.

Overall, thank you for a great relaxing afternoon.

We will be back."}
{"text":"Have went to the Yardhouse twice now with a friend of mine, both times have dine out on the patio and both times have had a great experience with the food and service.  Our server was Aaron (sp?) so he deserves some props.  Aside from the good service and atmosphere, there is a great selection of beer on draft and the menu is friendly for those with diet restrictions.  The cauliflower appetizer was bomb and have not been disappointed with any of my entree selections (ahi tuna green salad, chicken tinga street tacos)   Worth a try :)"}
{"text":"FROZEN EDAMAME... Need I say more? This place used to be good. Honestly, go to Culinary Dropout and don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"Good selection of beers.  Food was ok I had the pepper jack burger and the flavor was ok but the meat was dry. Serve was very good."}
{"text":"Great place! Great service! 

Appetizer ordered tuna which was good but sauce was on the salty sauce 

Fish and chips were great with fries

Fish tacos were alright.

Will be back though"}
{"text":"It's fine, it's a Yard House. 

Service is fine, food is fine and the beer's on tap are cold."}
{"text":"If it is a nice day - sit on the patio.  
Nothing off kilter about this Yard House. The experience is consistent with the others. 
The Ceviche was an item I hadn't tried before and it was quite good! just know, you are going to have to dig to get everything, the presentation may look cool but it is a mess once you dive in. 

Nice place whether with friends, family or business partners."}
{"text":"This place is so new in the WestGate complex if you google the address it doesn't even come up, just remember it is in the University of Phoenix Arena Complex in Glendale near the 101 and I-10 on Glendale Avenue. 
I wasn't expecting much since our experience at Gordon Biersch in the same complex was terrible. 
Well we went on Wednesday night and I dare say I had some of the best service possible. 
The waitress explained everything very well. For an appetizer we got this wierd Sushi Cake?? I know I had questions too but it was well explained first by our dear waitress. 
Then I had Linguini with clams in Garlic Sauce and Clam Chowder, abosolutely delightful. 
It's somewhat of a sports bar with a large bar and TV screens in the middle. 
They have the largest selection of Tap Beer in the Valley! You can view it when your walking along the sidewalk--You see this great room with hundreds of kegs--Quite a site almost like the matrix.
There were many people enjoying the night air and it actually looked like a functioning well class restraunt. Don't know how all the business looking people got there, but I dare say \"Glendale you've finally made a success with the Westgate complex on the West Side!\" Finallly it's about time."}
{"text":"One of my favorite happy hour place. Their martinis & mules are soo good and soo strong.

Also love the poke stack, nachos, pizzas, calamari from the happy hour menu (that's all I've tried but I'm sure I'll love more).

Went here for dinner tonight with one of my girlfriends and as appetizer we had the deep fried Brussel sprouts that has crispy potato wedges and a savory sauce underneath everything... Wow this is the best best best dish I've tried by far at yard house. You must try it!

Entrée I got the chicken penne pasta, which was creamy goodness with chunks of chicken, asparagus and sun dried tomatoes, which really gave it a kick! My girlfriend ordered the ahi tuna crunch salad which was also very good, seared ahi tuna on top of salads tossed with wonton crunch and sesame sauce... Very good. 

You can choose from small to large portion, we both chose small and with an appetizer it really filled us up :)"}
{"text":"Met a friend for lunch here today... very good service....very good food (TRY THE TRUFFLE OIL FRIES!!!)
Had the Pastrami sandwich and Tomato Bisque, Our table also ordered the Ahi Salad and the vegetarian chicken salad along with edamame and truffle oil fries off the \"snack\" menu  all was very good.

I thought it was a bit pricey, lunch for 2 without alcohol was $35.00 (2 items off the cheaper appetizer \"snack\" menu also\"
They ahve what is probably over 50 beers on tap if your a beer drinkers this place would be a good stop....I saw their Martinis were $10 each....Ouch."}
{"text":"Enjoyed lunch on the patio. The great, huge patio. This is a vibrant, fun area day or night. The bbq chicken pizza was good and enjoyed the salad. They were out of diet Coke which was a surprise. The soup & salad was a perfect lunch time choice. Soup was hot and tasty. Our server was very competant, very nice, very friendly."}
{"text":"Awful customer service.They ruined what is normally a good time at this chain. I will not be coming back to this location ever again."}
{"text":"Parents came in after being in Sedona for the weekend and hubby and I decided to take them to Westgate for the whole \"west side experience\" Perfect place for my step-dad as per his own admission he has had \"years of experience with beer\" :) 

We get down there neglecting to check the football/hockey schedules. Hockey game scheduled for the night we head out there. So busier then normal. Probably made for a better experience 

We put our name in and wait 20 minutes for first available. We get seated and it's a little warm in the restaurant. Warmer then usual. A little uncomfortable but we try and adjust. Drinks are ordered. I love, love the Peach cider. Hubby had a Hoegaarden. Step dad tried something @ the suggestion of our server Mike. Mom had glass of white zin. An order of cold edamame is also plugged in and we are off. 

We chat some and the edamame comes out. Cools us off. Mike comes and takes our order. Hubby had the steak salad, I ordered the Cuban pork sandwich, mom order surf and turf burger, step dad orders a Greek salad and adds ahi to it. 

Everything comes out looking fantastic. The salad my hubby ordered the steak was cooked perfectly for him. I will from this moment on every time we go there get the pork sandwich. Tons of sliced pork, pickles, tomatoes, aioli and garlic au jus. Shoestring french frys accompany my order. Mom's surf and turf looks to die for. The Greek salad was a little on the small side but the ahi looked perfectly seared. 

Everything was delish. I think the ladies won the night with what we ordered. It was so good. We missed happy hour prices by 15 minutes so the tab was a little steep for the four of us. $120 plus tip. 

Had my mom taste test the Frambroise. So good. She wanted to order vanilla ice cream and put the shot all over it. :)"}
{"text":"Took a relative here for a birthday party. It was a very good experience. Service was great. Food was good and huge selection of beer. Would definitely go back again especially for a special occassion."}
{"text":"This place is a must come to!!! Not only is the food amazing but their customer service is AWESOME!!! Every one we have been to , from here to Phoenix . the must have consistent customer service training because it is too notch. They make you feel at home, welcomed and always with a smile they greet you !! Always our go to place for date night!! 

Check them out !!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar for over ten minutes, and not one bartender approached us or even put a coaster down in front of us.

Bar was packed, but the four bartenders were definitely talking to other patrons. Two bartenders stood in front of one customer who spent nearly ten minutes trying to select a beer. Pathetic service. 

It must be difficult to be a bartender where you mainly serve draught beer. 

Will never go back."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all.  Pizza was kinda cold and not done really on the top.  Probably will choose not to eat here again!"}
{"text":"Awful service. It took 45 minutes for our food to arrive. My medium rare steak was so tough my knife bounced off it. Grilled cheese was congealed...it was gross. Waitress never came over to say kitchen was backed up.  It was also so cold with the a/c on that I had to order tea to keep warm. Manager did come over once summoned and was really no help. Avoid if possible."}
{"text":"A kabillion kinds of beer?  Check.
A bunch of snacks/appetizers for watching the game?  Check.
Music worth listening to? Check.
Dinner foods worth eating?  Check.
NHL Channel on at all times?  Check.  Well ok, most don't care about this but being a hockey nut no places have this.

Maybe none of the above is amazing (other than the beer selection).  
Maybe it is a bit expensive for a cheapskate like me (I go during happy hour and find it still to be a bit pricey).  
Maybe parking is a pain if you go for an event.  
Maybe it takes a bit longer to get food as its normally pretty busy.

I don't care.  Stop your whining, pony up 2 dollars and get yourself a couple of Big Macs.

On a more serious note one of the upper managers was around and noticed I was wearing my Wings jersey and bought both my wife and I drinks; he also happened to go to the same community college as I did in Michigan.  Go figure.

I'd recommend the Onion Ring tower, sliders, Mushroom wraps, and spinach dip for appetizers (in that order).  The sweet potato fries with maple dip are all kinds of tasty for a bar treat."}
{"text":"I'll get the less-than-positive out of the way first. The wait. Ok, that's done. What's nice is that the wait can be spent seated on the loveseats outside, with heat lamps in the winter and an ice cold cocktail or beer in the summer. And I like the layout better than the Desert Ridge location. I always feel like I'm in a huge hallway there. 

The staff is almost always very friendly (one off experience, but I think she was just having a bad day), the selection of beers and other drinks is endless, and the menu has something for just about everyone. The atmosphere is casual with a buzz in the air, and it's cool to look at the 'microbrew equipment'. It has to be for show, because I've never seen anyone near that stuff. Maybe someone knows different?? lol

The ahi tuna is mmmm mmmm good. If you're a salad lover, try the grilled hearts of romaine with gorgonzola vinaigrette. Ask for grilled chicken breast on top, if you're feeling carnivorous. Seriously, it is the best. And bring floss!"}
{"text":"I was surprised. I didn't think I'd like yard house as much as I did. Their weird menu really threw me off...what restaurant tries to do a little of everything?  In my experience,  you ought to stick to a specialty rather than do everything. I didn't try the sushi but the chicken noodle soup was hearty and good. Their boneless buffalo wings were good. The calamari is simple okay. Their draft beer choice is awesome. They even had my husband's favorite, orange blossom by papago."}
{"text":"Our daughter, who lives in Vegas and comes here frequently, took us here for lunch on NFL Championship Game Sunday. It was crowded, but not packed, which was nice since we got a late start. The hostess said 20-30 mins and we were seated in 10. There are plasma TVs everywhere here, so I can't imagine there being a bad seat in the house to watch a game. 

If I were designing the perfect sports bar (for me at least), this place would be the model. Start with the beer. The selection is impressive. You can take a beer tour of the world without leaving your seat. If you aren't sure where to start, do the 6 pack taster. 

The food?  I think the hardest part about ordering is picking something. All of the appetizers looked delicious. We had the lobster, crab and artichoke dip. Excellent choice!  E, who is a salad connoisseur, had the walnut pear salad.  R had the sliders.  Both were excellent!  I had the BBQ bacon and cheese burger.  That burger is now on my \"top 5 burgers I've ever had\" list.  The meat was full of flavor and juicy and the rum BBQ sauce had a nice tang to it.

The atmosphere?  Nice and clean inside, with an upscale feeling to it.  The clientele was a good age mix, attractive and dressed like they actually cared about their appearance.

Last but definitely not least, the service.  Our server was great.  I think her name was Cyndi.  She was attentive without being intrusive and best of all, when it comes to us at least, she was patient.

The bottom line?  I wish they would seriously consider a location in Northern California.  Might I suggest the Streets of Brentwood Shopping Center?  This is definitely in our rotation of Vegas places to go when we're there."}
{"text":"Delicious beer. Not too expensive.  Really solid complete menu.  This is a nice \"go-to\" place when you want to be sure you will enjoy yourself.  Its consistent with food, our server was nice and friendly.  Not really out of the box, no surprises really, but it makes a nice home base.

*I had the surf and turf burger.  Hard to eat but delicious besides.  Can't remember what I had to drink.  An IPA I'm sure, of which they have an excellent selection."}
{"text":"The staff was nice and friendly but the weight time for the food was very slow. I ordered something simple, a chicken ceasar salad but the dressing seemed to contain a strong taste of vinegar. I enjoyed the music, played rock n' roll."}
{"text":"This is a classy sports bar and their Happy Hour is very popular with the locals.

We got there at 3.30pm and the place was probably 90% full.  By the time we left there was a long line of people waiting to get in.

I ordered the Chicken Nachos and the serving size was huge.  It was well presented and it tasted good but the chicken chunks were rubbery and I couldn't get close to finishing it because the meal was that big.  At $5.00 a plate, I'm not going to complain.

My partner had the chicken tenders and fries and he was happy with the food.

I'd go back to try other items on the Happy Hour Menu."}
{"text":"Mac n Cheese Squared!  That's all I have to say.

Everyone else was trying to be healthy by eating a fish dish and salad or soup and salad, but c'mon when in a new place you have to try the signature dishes.

The Mac and Cheese Squared didn't look even close to what you might get out of a Kraft box.  Instead it is a white gooey cheese pasta (not elbows) with mushrooms, bacon (big pieces), and a vegetable (?).  Absolutely delicious.

But wait, one of the most important things....the decor.  You walk in and to your left is an enclosed room full of kegs.  You can see in via the glass and view the lines running from the kegs up to the ceiling.  Then you see huge chrome pipes running across the ceiling through the foyer into the restaurant and across to the center bar.  To add perspective we are taking about a hundred beers.

Dafe"}
{"text":"Rocco was great,  friendly and helpful. 

Tons of vegaterian options. And the menu is huge,  Incline skinny cocktails and 150 beers. 

I had the lettus wraps which were Delish and my husband had the Garden rice bowl.  

Prince point is great,  especially for being on the strip,  finally a place that doesn't kill your wallet.  

Food came out quick and there is upstairs and downstairs patio with a great view of the High roller. 

We will come back and definitely recommend it others."}
{"text":"Undoubtedly my new spot for reasonably priced craft beer while in Vegas.  You can order any size and take it to-go (they'll pour it into a plastic cup).  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Love the Yard House!!! Favorite spot to unwind and hang out after a long work week.  The staff is always friendly and takes great care of us!  Great service and great food that is reasonably priced.  I highly recommend Yard House for a relaxing and enjoyable time."}
{"text":"I live nearby. As a mature female I get frustrated by the lack of good service. I was in the service industry and know how tough it is. You think because I am a female I won't tip, but I will. Last night was crappy service, some of the 4 dishes served all at the same time was cold. I like my wings at a hot temperature, not cold. Come on guys. Thank goodness there are many other places now at Downtown Summerlin to choose from"}
{"text":"let me tell you why yard house is one of the preferable chain restaurants over most. the beer selection is on point. if you love beers then this place is a go-to because of their extensive selection. my recommendations for people who like fruitier beers:
* Abita Purple Haze - raspberry Belgian wheat
* lindeman's framboise - raspberry
* lindeman's peche - peach 
also I highly recommend the house honey blonde for anyone who enjoys lagers.

secondly, I have not been disappointed by the food. if you're adventurous with your food, I recommend the spicy tuna roll or ahi poke stack. it's always fresh and super flavorful. the shiitake garlic noodles are so yummy! you could get full off of those two dishes alone. the turkey pot pie is a classic and it's definitely something you need to try if you haven't already.

well played yard house, well played."}
{"text":"Great Mac& Cheese with Chicken.  Fun bar vibe with great food"}
{"text":"Food is usually good. It is loud, get a booth if you can so you can hear the person you are with. Don't depend on much service and you will be happy. It is a bar like atmosphere, lots of TVs, the games are on, people are yelling, kids are yelling, don't plan on going there to chill out and all is good. Tried this place for a second time on Saturday again got a table next to a screaming kid. When they cleared the table the they flung food at us.  I am not sure if they just employ young people that just don't care or if the noise is so loud it makes them all crazy. I was so stressed out from the noise I put on my headset and listened to music....Never again!!"}
{"text":"The lettuce wraps are my favorite. And they have an early and a late happy hour so you can get food drinks on the cheap! Tons of micro brews too!"}
{"text":"We cannot get enough of this place! The selection is fantastic! On this visit I had the seared ahi salad and it nearly brought me to tears. My husband thoroughly enjoyed the fried chicken on whipped potatoes with a bourbon gravy - he said it tasted like home (Kentucky). 

The beer selection is astronomical - a delight for every palate!"}
{"text":"We cannot get enough of this place! The selection is fantastic! On this visit I had the seared tuna sandwich and it was an absolute delight. The shoestring fries are yummy and the sea salt caramel butterscotch pudding is out of this frickin' world!! 

They also mix Framboise Raspberry Lambic with Youngs Double Chocolate Stout for what they call a Young Berry Chocolate and it's delightful. :)"}
{"text":"This place has great variety of both food and drinks. Servers are nice and attentive. There's an outdoor patio section that's primarily protected from the sun and has misters during the summer months. Overall I really enjoy coming here and intend to visit again."}
{"text":"It started with the hostess who was friendly and smiling.  Next came our server Natasha who took the time to describe the beer choice and food choice. Started with the queso with poblano peppers. Served with tortilla chips and warm tortillas. Simply delicious!  I had the enchilada stack and it was delicious!  The chicken as moist. The tomatillo sauce and chili sauce was superb!  Together the tastes complemented the chicken!  I would certainly recommend!"}
{"text":"Best beer around, food not so much.
Had the $10 burger tonight, really disappointing, I always order it medium it always comes burnt well done and cold fries, never good. I really wish they had better food. I just come for the Spaten Lager, worlds best beer. The only Yard House I've been at that has good food is the one in Las Vegas right off the strip."}
{"text":"I think we come here once a month at least. Food is always great. Service is always great! Love yard house!"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time on my girlfriend's behalf. She's always had positive things to say about this place, so I finally decided to go for it. The food was above average. I ordered the lamb burger and the barbecue chicken pizza. For the food, I give it a 7.5/10. I'd rate this place four stars if it were solely based on food, but that isn't the case. The service was 'meh.' Our waiter ignored us on multiple occasions and disregarded us. It took four tries to get a refill on water. It was as if he looked down on us (probably because we're younger.) You'd think all consumers would be treated equally without stereotypes, but I guess that's not the case here at Yard House! Good food. BAD service."}
{"text":"We stop by after the hockey game ( coyotes vs blackhawks ) , the drinks were good, the server was  pretty attentive , we order the firecracker wings , good as usual , my wife ordered the new pasta (shrimp and calamari a diablo pasta)))... plainnnnnnnn, awful , I tasted some of it ... awful pasta , the drinks and the wings good the pasta pretty bad"}
{"text":"Really nice restaraunt!  I would recommend if you are visiting the town square.  It has a business ambience with a casual feel, if that makes sense.  We arrived around 730 and had a 30 minute wait which I expected considering it was a Friday night.  

I started with the chicken nachos which was outstanding!  Chips topped with some kind of house BBQ or picante sauce, shredded cheese. Chicken (cooked well), guacomole, sir cream, tomatoes, cilantro.... Everything you would expect to make a great nacho plate. It was pretty large also, feeds 4 at least. 

My entree, I decided to go with the chicken and rice bowl.  It was pretty good, flavorful but the chicken was a little dry and could've used a little more seasoning.  If this dish would've been a little better I would've considered giving them a 5 star.  It was an reasonably priced as well. Those two items totaled to $30."}
{"text":"Great place if you're looking for a reasonably priced meal in Vegas. My friends and I stayed in the hilton grand, which was very close to the linq. We ate here for dinner the first night, then walking back from a day party at marquee we wanted to to somewhere else so we stopped by a Mexican place: $22 for a burrito! No way! So we ended up going back to yard house for another meal while we watched the World Cup. Would recommend the ahi tuna salad, light & refreshing, the small portion is perfectly filling!"}
{"text":"Love the beer menu that is divided by style to help you choose something you will like. The ribeye with flavored mashed potatoes and vegetables was excellent. Our server Shanna really brightened my day she was genuinely sweet and good at her job. Visited 7/23/15"}
{"text":"Great place to come for lunch and dinner.  I usually come here at least twice a week.  They have a large selection of foods, all delicious and service is always good.   Sometimes on the weekends this place can be so packed it may be up to an hour wait.  Conveniently located in the heart of town square so you can enjoy a beer or two after seeing a movie.

Favorite Foods: Lettuce Wraps, Korean BBQ Ribs, Clam Chowder, BBQ Chicken Pizza, and Baja Fish Tacos.

Obviously I come here a lot.  They have a  bunch of house beers, my favorite is the fruit wild ales, orange wheat in particular.  Does the body good after a long day at work."}
{"text":"Jason, our server, was fantastic! Very attentive and had some great suggestions for our table. He made sure we got our happy hour order in on time and the food was fantastic. I've eaten at Yard Houses in 4 different states and the quality of food is consistently good. Tonight, the Spicy Tuna, Calamari and Sliders were outstanding! We sat in a booth and even though it was packed, the noise level never affected us. A fine evening!"}
{"text":"tasty appetizers, lots of beer, sports on tv, who could ask for more."}
{"text":"Use to visit Yard house frequently in San Antonio and I have always liked it. This time I had a Moscow which has Ginger beer and  your choice of 1 out of 3 different liquors and I chose vodka. It was so really good. I didn't think it was strong enough in my opinion but hey I like to drink! I also ordered the Ahi poke stack and the lobster and artichoke dip and I thought both were really good. They also have great happy hour specials."}
{"text":"I have been to a few Yard House locations and I think they are pretty much the same. Service has always been fine. The food is good not great...I do however think their pizza is amazing and their Ahi poke appetizer and love their calamari.

Their drinks are great! There is a huge variety of drinks, beer, and wine! They have a great happy hour from 3 to 6 and another that starts at 8. The prices aren't bad. They have TV's all along the bar area so you can watch sports if your into that.   Cool spot to chill with friends and family."}
{"text":"Came here for a business lunch. Just a small  group of 20. No big deal. Lol. I love that I'm sitting there with my co workers, my supervisor, my direct manager, my old regional operations manager, the Southern California region big boss man and half of us are halving cocktails and then going back to work lol. 

The staff was very nice and accommodating. We had a couple girls helping us. The drinks came out quickly. And there was someone refilling waters and non alcoholic drinks every 5 minutes. The food came out pretty quick. It wasn't all together but it was hot and orders came out one or two at a time. 

I wasn't feeling well so I ordered light. I had the soup and salad combo. I do have to say you have a few options there. I believe there are 3-4 each of soup and salads to choose from. I chose classic Caesar and clam chowder. Both were awesome!!! 

Everyone ordered something different. I saw fish, sandwiches, meatless chicken wings, meatless salads, Asian, tacos, all sorts of stuff. Everyone enjoyed their meals. 

Service was awesome, drinks were awesome, food was awesome and the bill going the head man in charge awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"I hate to give such a low score but I have to 
Be honest... well first person to seat us was very kind. Our waitress took a while to come. Then she took our order. My food came back wrong I got steak instead of fish. The manager came to apologize that was nice. The food I received looked good but unbelievably had NO flavor. Classic case of a pretty plate with zero value. The Chef seemingly piled salsa and sauces on everything but never flavored the actual meats. I was so excited but left disappointed. I normally love Yard-house but that was in Cali. Oh well I will attach pics but like the food they will only be for looks."}
{"text":"This was the first time here, and it was an enjoyable experience for the most part. The exception was at the beginning of the visit. The menu is huge, and the waitress kept coming back quickly whenever we asked for more time. This made me feel very pressured and anxious about choosing what to eat as a first-time visitor. I eventually ordered the pastrami sandwich with fries and a side of deviled eggs. The deviled eggs were awesome, the best part of my meal. Overall, I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This was my first time to the Yard House. They had a phenomenal selection of beers on tap and the drink menu was bigger than the food menu! The environment was great, service was awesome and our waiter was very attentive even though they were packed. Only complaint would be that the food was very overpriced for the location and number of food offerings available, and strangely there was no cell service inside or even wi-if. We had an awesome time with friends but as Vegas local I would be hard pressed to return simply due to their food prices. There are just too many offerings at a much more reasonable price."}
{"text":"Excellent food, service and atmosphere. This place has great music playing as well as many different venues on their TV's. The appetizers here are all delicious and could be meals. Especially the blue claw crab was delicious, great dipping sauce."}
{"text":"Great dinner! Food was good but our server Nancy was A+++. So sweet and when she found out we were there for our anni dinner she gave us a special dessert. We enjoy Yard House and from now on will ask to be sat in Nancys section. Thanks Nancy!!"}
{"text":"Used to go to Yard House in California, and was stoked when I heard they were opening one up in Vegas.  Amazing selection of beers -- I'm not even a big beer drinker, but even I can find a unique beer to enjoy.  Their happy hour is truly amazing... the list of food goes on a mile long, and it was all delicious.  Now they just need to open a Yard House closer to my house."}
{"text":"Can't knock this place.  I know what I'm getting when I visit a Yard House, and I wasn't disappointed in going to this location after an afternoon of shopping.  Had a pint of Abita Purple Haze ($5.50) and a goblet of lambic framboise ($8.00).  If the happy hour lasted all day, I would have ordered an appetizer, too!"}
{"text":"I love yard house.. Im not a super beer drinker but they have such a wide variety I can always find something that pleases the palate. I never seem to make it for happy hour so the bill can get kind of pricey but overall its a nice place to chill, drink, and get some noms. 
The biggest draw back to hanging out there is its always LOUD. I don't think i've ever been there and had a normal toned conversation with my guest. The music is usually loud which means the patrons have to be louder just to be heard. It can get almost obnoxious at times. 
That's the only reason why they get a 4 star review. Otherwise great place."}
{"text":"This place is so so so good. Best menu and selection I've ever seen. Massive selection of draft beers, anything and everything you could want on a menu. Service was great, the food was wonderful. We ordered a lot of apps: chicken tenders, sushi, deviled eggs, and ahi tuna - so great!"}
{"text":"Stay away. I am irate after sitting at the bar for 20 minutes and being ignored by the bar tender, every server and the manager that was behind the bar. It is inexcusable for this to be happening at 3pm on a Thursday. Not busy at all, and still can't even be acknowledged. Sad because I have loved yardhouse at other locations, if you want to go, I recommend going to the West Gate location."}
{"text":"Came in for dinner and had a less than thrilling experience. This was the first time I had been to this location (usually go to the Illinois location which is awesome). Noticed it was not busy as the other restaurants in the area and definitely not like the Yardhouse I'm used to which always has a wait. 
The food was pretty bad. I ordered lettuce wraps (I get every time) which weren't very appetizing, and the lettuce was old and brown. My mom ordered a turkey burger which we specified to the server she wanted it cooked very well (as turkey burgers should always be fully cooked thru). The burger came out still pink in the middle. She asked to just get the regular avocado swiss burger. The wait was very long for the new burger and it came without avocado and swiss. My salad was also pretty disappointing. 
Our server Adam was nice and attentive and the only reason I give this high of a rating is for the manager Melissa. I have been in the restaurant industry many years and she was very nice and handled the situation in the correct manner. Would probably not go back for the food but maybe just for drinks as they have many of my favorite ciders."}
{"text":"Is a beer before noon a bad idea?  Not if it's a Black and Tan or a Stout Float.

Visited the new Red Rock location on a Friday for lunch.  Managed to beat the Summerlin Power Lunchers in and got a nice booth off to the side.

I like the layout of this place, but was a little annoyed at the fact that if I entered via the Casino they made me walk the entire length of the place to the Street entrance hostess to get a seat.

Our waiter was super friendly and very helpful.  So service was a plus.

Beer selection was awesome and I will admit the only 2 other times I have been to a Yard house was for the libations and not for food.  Opted for the Stouts since it was before noon.

The place would have gotten 4 stars if the food was presented a little better.  We started with the Moo Shu Egg Rolls, Poke Stack, and Spicy Tuna Roll, then shared a Lunch portion Spicy Jambalaya.

Moo Shu Egg Rolls were great, nice combination of flavors, crispy and paired great with the sauce.

The Poke Stack was far from good quality poke and our stack was more like a landslide about ready to tumble.  Although hardly a poke expert, I've cut my share of fish in my life to know that poke should be bite size pieces of fish, not mangled rough chopped pieces of flesh (have some respect for your fish).

The Spicy Tuna Roll is a beautiful bounty of elegance, and tastes good too.  Not your traditional roll but presented in stacked layers which works.

The lunch portion of the Jambalaya only had 2 shrimp in it, and if that is their idea of blackened, someone better find their spice peddler because they are getting ripped in believing they are delivering a good creole dish when all they are serving up is some shrimp with tomato sauce over some rice.

Overall a good place for some drinks and a good time but I will definitely be trying some other dishes."}
{"text":"While visiting Fashion Square Mall, my friend suggested we splurge and have a nice dinner. After looking at the menu, we decided to try it.

I enjoyed the Mac + Cheese- which was a large portion of  chicken breast, applewood bacon, wild mushrooms, cheddar, parmesan, campanelle pasta & truffle oil. It was truly delicious and I enjoyed every bite of it. I paid extra for a ceasar salad that was nothing special, but still good.

My friend enjoyed the  Rib Eye (12oz) with garlic mashed potatoes, green beans & shallot butter. She stated it was the best steak that she had ever had. She also paid extra for a salad, and felt the same about her salad, but she also asked for extra ranch dressing, which never arrived.

My friend  also enjoyed a bikini martini that I had a taste of. It was just lovely but due to the prices of the drinks, opted to not have one. 
The prices were kind of high to us, and our server didnt really give us warm fuzzy feelings, and at times we felt sort of rushed to complete our meal.

I think perhaps as a special occasion I would go again, perhaps not. 
But it was definitely worth a try and the menu is diverse enough to have something cheaper."}
{"text":"Great place, especially for happy hour ( 3-7 m-f) and they have a late night happy hour that starts at 10pm , i think. They have beer specials, martinis are $5.95 and almost every appetizer is half off. I have never had a bad meal here. Some of the entrees are pricey but the food is good."}
{"text":"If you have never been to the Yard, it is well worth the over priced food. It is only a little $$. But good food. The service is alway great. So nettles the wait can be crazy. So eat at off times."}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday after the movies for lunch. Ordered the Korean short ribs street tacos. Delicious flavors that blended well with a good Hefeweizen beer. Really liked the mass amounts of beers to choose from. Having choices always makes for an ideal situation. This is a popular place and generally really busy. Great place socialize with a big group of friends. Friendly customer service with a smile."}
{"text":"First time at this location. Live near by and was looking to watch college football. The prices for food are a bit high and there are no game day specials. Which I found off considering the amount of TV's. I did like the fact there was no-smoking like PKWY Tavern. We sat at the bar and the staff was GREAT! Large beer selection and full bar. The food was good. Better than any other location to watch sports. We ordered the Chicken Lettuce Wraps. We didn't realize it had Tofu in them also. The menu mentions Tofu but then has a selection of meet. We thought when choosing chicken we would not be choosing Tofu. Turns out you get chicken with the Tofu. We couldn't figure out why the Chicken was \"spongy\". We didn't care for it;stopped eating it and they immediately removed them from the tab. The Wisconsin Cheese Curds are wonderful. Not a fan of the sweet dipping sauce. They have their own Buffalo wing sauce. It is good but has a TON of black pepper in it. I like black pepper so it was OK. But if you are not I wouldn't order. They changed their fries to the standard Fast Food CHEAP Fries. I would not order them even the Truffle fries.  Overall I would come back to watch sports and have some snacks. Just wish they had HH or game day prices."}
{"text":"I wish I could give 4.5 stars but settling at 4. We went to dinner at this place and boy it was one of the best dinner. The place is really huge and as you enter there is a bar in the center, regular table seating around and some high chair seating too. It's an open kitchen, and looks neat. The place on a Friday is crowded but the service is quick. 

We ordered some watermelon margarita and they were really good. The watermelon was not too sweet just had the right flavor and it was delicious. 

We ordered quite a lot of appetizers queso dip(great dip, lots of cheese, little heavy but tasty), chicken nachos( this was the only disappointment, qty is pretty good and the cheese dried up, there was more of nachos compared to the dipping), onion ring tower (the best onion ring I have had, crispy, tasty and great presentation, the dipping served with it was delicious), firecracker wings( wonderful, perfect sauce and spice), fried Mac and cheese was alright. 

We ordered spicy jambalaya with angel hair pasta and trust me this is the best dish in Yard house. This dish my new favorite and the main reason this place gets a 5 star. The pasta was cooked to perfect and Cajun cream sauce melted the pasta in the mouth after a bite. The shrimp and crawfish perfectly cooked, absorbed all the ingredients. Chicken andouille was a little salty but I can ignore it coz the dish deserves all the praises. I can rave more on this amazing entree. 

Since it was a bday celebration, we got some free dessert and do save some space for their mini peach apple cobbler, it was warm, delicious and the topping with icecream a perfection. Mini chocolate soufflé cake was great too but preferred the cobbler. 

Overall a great place and great food. Price is definitely on the higher side, would suggest to go during happy hours."}
{"text":"The selection of beer is impressive. If you catch a glance at the beer room teeming with flowing kegs of delicious import and microbrewed beer, it could make your taste buds water as it does mine.

Unfortunately, beyond beer, the Yard House doesn't have much to offer. The food is average at best and is way more expensive than the quality justifies. 

It, along with its neighbors at Kona and Z Tejas, have built-in the additional \"scene premium\" that make a five dollar chicken finger appetizer suddenly worth eight or nine. 

The service is actually very friendly and knowledgeable, so it is a fine place to grab a beer en route to somewhere else, but I wouldn't go out of my way to overpay for average food. That's just me."}
{"text":"Great beer selection but that's about it. I got the crab lobster dip and it looked a lot better than it tasted. The consistency and color were fine but it was very bland and it tasted like there were a few drops of seafood flavoring in it -- not real seafood or something. The pita bread was very stiff and room temperature. I thought it would be more warm and flavorful. The server pressured us over and over to get dessert after we told her we were not interested. She was MIA most of the time and my water glass was empty. If I went back here I would just sit at the bar, get a beer and skip the food. Cool atmosphere but not worth the overpriced entrées and appetizers."}
{"text":"First off, I'd like to say that Yard House is our favorite go to restaurant. We were extremely disappointed with the service received on 2/15/14. The hostess told us it will be around 30min, took over an hour to be seated. 
Our waitress was a bit rude and had no emotion. We figured she was being like that because we were a party of 9 and thought she would get an automatic tip, so no effort was made on her part. 
She asked my mom for her id, which was expired, so my mom handed her a passport. She had to go \"double check with the manager\" 
my cousin also ordered a beer and handed her a Puerto Rico license. Apparently, she did not have a TAM card or could not verify ids by her self because once again, she had to \"double check with the manager.\" She even asked my cousin for the date on the card. Has she not seen an id other than Nevada's?? When she returned, she did not inform my cousin whether or not the id was fine. He had to ask her and she said yes with an attitude. 
Our drinks were empty. Warm beer. Waitress disappeared for a good while. 
By the time our food came out, we still had our dirty appetizer plates. I asked her for another drink which she brought another of, yet I had to ask her to take away my previous watered down one. 
My cousin asked for another beer and to please make sure it was a cold one, she did not look up from her pad and made a face. 
I asked her for a box for my food and it took her around 15 minutes. I looked around, she was not with other tables. 
It was my brothers birthday so she did bring out a plate of ice cream yet DID NOT OFFER US DESSERT. she dropped the ice cream off and left. Returned 10 min later and asked if we wanted any other desserts (as she pulled the check out) 
Our whole dinner conversation consisted of wondering what her deal was. What type of server doesn't even attempt to get a good tip or make a good experience for their guest?? Horrible experience. Bet part about her was offering to take a picture of us. 
To our surprise there was not an automatic tip on the bill which drove us even more mad because it just showed us that that's the type of server she is. 
Walking out, the manager asked us how everything was and I did have to let him know and he asked a couple of questions. I saw him go and talk to her immediately. 
I will not stay away because I love the Yard House, but I will not be seated with Ashley again."}
{"text":"I love this place, it was packed when i went but still was able to get a seat. the first page in the menu is the beer section. The men in my family loved that. The appetizer jerk chicken is the best.. you've got to try that! Our waitress was great too even though she was very busy. I got the penne pasta which was great. The salmon was also very good as well as the jambalaya. 
But the thing that stood out the most about this place was when the waiter asked me if he wanted to change a channel to my team! There are so many TVs in tune to the sports. I was so happy about that!"}
{"text":"I placed an order to go and was told it would be a ten minute wait which was fine. Very poor customer service at the front, they were cussing and not giving anyone any attention. I  noticed my order came out and waited an extra five minutes while the three girls and one boy gossip amongst themselves. I asked for my food and was given attitude and it almost felt like she tossed the bag at me. 2 stars only for the food - people in the front should definitely have better customer service."}
{"text":"I like this place; I wasn't expecting the food to be good, but I was pleasantly surprised!  The service was great, and the menu was huge!  We had just missed happy hour, which was disappointing, so I had to pay the full $8.50 for a Malbec...The beer sampler looked tasty, it had six different beers in smaller glasses and came in a tray.  Next time I'm at Yard House I'm getting that. 

I had edamame to start and a spinach salad for my entree.  The spinach was fresh and had the perfect amount of balsamic vinegarette.  All of the components were balanced:  candied walnuts, bleu cheese, mushrooms, spinach and croutons.  It felt complete, even without a protein.  I dream of this salad."}
{"text":"Do you like hair in your food? If so you should come to the yard house. The waitress was very rude and passive aggressive towards us. She ended up having another waiter serve our table. We ordered two entrees and both of them had hair in it... the color of the waitress who was rude."}
{"text":"Second visit to Yard House and had another 5 star experience. I am only updating my review to give a shout out to our server David-- he was awesome! He took his time to make us aware of all the new menu changes and gave great recommendations. 

He was also able to convert my stubborn father (a man who always drinks Bud Light from the bottle and who was dismayed to learn they only serve draft beer here-- GASP!) into trying a sample of beer from their extensive menu. I about fell out of my seat when my dad said he actually liked David's beer choice and ordered a full glass of it! Go see David, he's awesome and will take care of you!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant! There's something for everyone in our family..from my 10 yr old daughter to my 70 yr old mom! I love the poke nachos, my husband likes the garlic lobster pasta..The servers are actually very pleasant. The only thing is that I just had to try to get their attention a couple of times instead of them regularly coming to our table"}
{"text":"Very nice place I frequent when I'm in Las Vegas! I've always had a great experience here until yesterday when I just need a quick lunch.  I ordered a well done bbq bacon cheese burger. The first issue was no bbq on my bbq bacon cheese burger. The waitress explain its embedded in the beef patty. There was no taste of bbq in this burger. The second and most important issue is I requested a well done burger and I you can see in the picture I didn't get what I ordered. The manager resolution was to bring me a new burger or offer a free dessert. Since I didn't get what I paid for and was unable to complete my meal I should not have been charged for this burger but that wasn't an option here at yard house."}
{"text":"Two words: Happy. Hour. 

I know that whatever state I am in, I can count on Yard House for good consistent food. My favorite appetizer is the spicy tuna roll. It's not the traditional sushi roll, it's even better. It's just a giant circle filled with tuna, avocado and cucumber. YUM. The nachos, wings and pizzas are really good too. And it's CHEAP. So much food for so little money!

They have a great selection of alcohol and they have my favorite framboise! 

I've been for lunch and dinner too and it is also delicious."}
{"text":"Came to Yard House for dinner before going to the airport to leave Las Vegas. It's in a mall made to look like a quaint downtown shopping center. Pretty nicely done, actually, but would be nicer if they closed it off to care traffic. We likely wouldn't have found the place, though, were it not for our GPS leading us straight there on city streets. 

Was busy for early evening but we got a table right away. The staff was extra attentive and got us everything we needed. My boyfriend and I were meeting friends and since we had a plane to catch, ordered before they got there. Getting meals at different times and two different bills was no problem for our waitress. What a relief!

Perusing the menu, I was surprised at the selection. Though the Yard House is a brew pub, they have a pretty interesting and appetizing menu that include gluten-free and vegetarian options. My boyfriend got a grilled ahi salad and I got the mac and cheese which is nothing like the usual mac and cheese. It had chicken, bacon, and wild mushrooms in it with a small pasta I'd never seen before. The sauce was made of several exotic cheeses and it was delicious! My friend's four-year daughter shared it with me so though I thought it gourmet and exotic, it was easy enough for her to enjoy as well. I tried the ahi and it was really tasty too. Our friends got burgers with cones of crispy french fries and everything looked delicious. 

Overall, the restaurant is a loud and happening place but seems to be a good place to bring kids while still feeling like you're having a night out on the town. Prices were very reasonable and the service was fantastic. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I have been to the Yard House a couple of times now. The food has always been good, although I feel like it's a bit overpriced. This makes for a nice date night spot located in the hustle and bustle of Glendale's West Gate."}
{"text":"Perfectly fine.  Good bar type food.  Easy to accommodate the varying taste of a large group and nice location."}
{"text":"This was about the only way I wanted to spend my birthday this year. I came here with my boyfriend and I for a birthday/anniversary dinner. We were sat right away on a Thursday night, that was pretty busy! Our server was Chuy and his upbeat and charismatic attitude made my night so much better. He was always available for questions or recommendations for food and beer. I had some amazing stout beers while I was here too! For an appetizer, we shared the Buffalo Cauliflower with a spicy tahini sauce. It was the perfect amount of heat and the sauce brought it all together. Seriously will go back to get those every time! For an entree, we shared the Red Quinoa Salad. This was the best, most nutrient-dense salad I've had in a while. Few ingredients such as kale, red quinoa, blueberries, pumpkin seeds, and cauliflower. You definitely be full from this salad. The finish up with dessert, we had a S'mores Brownie. Chuy brought it back with \"Happy Birthday\" in cocoa powder with a lit candle. What a special way to spend a special night."}
{"text":"OMG Amazing to place to eat !! We got here and got our name down in case the wait is long.. Rush across to the high Roller ride.. Half way down our buzzer on.. I called in n told hostess we still on the ride.. She was so cool.. 
Finally got in restaurant n quickly got table .. Our waitress n servers so so great..catering to our many needs from Drinks to our apps.. And entrees .. We piggy out big time !!! But surprising our bill so so cheap..!!! $184.00 yay..
Love love and will be coming back to try rest of menu..."}
{"text":"We ate here after a business meeting an before an evening business meeting.  Lots of appetizers for the table and I ordered a Kale Salad.   Overall, it was really good.  Wait staff was great ... even reminding my coworker that she'd left her laptop as we were heading out!!  Saved her for sure.  :)

Nothing super fancy, but the food was tasty and I'd definitely come here again for another casual meal when I'm staying in the Red Rock."}
{"text":"We always enjoy this place. The menu offers a variety of choices, and we've liked everything we've tried. Even though the place is busy every time we come, we've never had an excessive wait (use their call ahead seating) and have had good service. 

A good place for a casual meal out."}
{"text":"We visited here last night and had a delightful visit. We were seated on the lower level patio and our waitress Brittany couldn't have been better.
We tried the queso and it was good, the tortillas were outstanding.  We also shared the fish and chips and they were really good. The jalapeno tartar sauce and the malt vinegar aioli stole the show. We liked the food and atmosphere and will be back."}
{"text":"So we were looking for a place to grub for a bite. This place is similar to other yard house but its more spacious and cozy. Ambience and food was good and price was affordable. They got a lunch selection for only 9.25$ that includes a sandwich and a soup and add a dollar for sides. Aaron our server was very attentive and friendly.good job. I will recommend this to my friends."}
{"text":"I have only gone to their happy hour, it is amazing :)

-HH is Monday - Friday 3pm - 6pm and Late night HH Sunday - Wednesday 10pm - close 
-They have a hip indoor + good outdoor seating
-Located right across from the movie theaters

HH FOOD 5/5:
-Half-price appetizers!! They have a huge selection of HH food :D
-Poke nachos ($8): raw ahi, with avocado, cilantro, green onions etc. This is so yummy!
-Spinach cheese dip ($7): comes with crispy flatbread its so savory.
-Onion ring tower ($5): love how huge the onion rings are!
-Fried calamari ($7): the bomb, it's so crispy and appetizing.
-BBQ chicken pizza ($7): my favorite out of all the pizzas; it's a thin crust pizza with red onion, cilantro, chicken and bbq sauce.
-I'm really sad that they took out the california roll and spicy tuna roll off of HH. Those were my favorite entrees too :(

HH DRINKS 5/5:
-$2 off beer, wine, and cocktails
-I usually get a black and blue (blue moon + guiness stout) or black and velvet (stout + cider)

SERVICE 2/5:
-I called in to tell them to book a reservation for 7 people and they confirmed. So when I got there, the hostess said \"I don't see your name, and we don't book reservations for less than 8 people.\" Well okayyy, I didn't know that, whoever talked to me on the phone should have told me. I was super annoyed, and as a former hostess, she could have handled it a different way instead of disregarding me.
-Our server (can't remember name) was really rude about us asking questions about the beers they have. Anyways my boyfriend was inquiring about coffee beers and this server was basically getting annoyed and making us feel uncomfortable with all the questions. The servers should be open to have a conversation with us, we don't know what kinda of beers you guys have."}
{"text":"Love this Yardhouse location!
We always come in for Happy Hour and Christopher is our favorite bartender, I work late so the hours are great. Still a little pricy but not bad at all.  The calamari and a Pyramid Apricot beer are my favorite midnight snack :)"}
{"text":"I've been to the Yard House outside of Chicago and generally speaking would not prefer a chain, especially on vacation or business.  But sometimes, you just want casual reliable food and I knew this place would fit the bill.  It did not disappoint.

I was at the Red Rock Resort and Spa on business with a free night.  I met up with three fellow travelling business associates.  The waitress gave us no trouble for seperate and itemized bills.  I had the tuna salad and a very yummy old fashioned.  $30 and yummy.  Perfect."}
{"text":"ves food and drink! fo sure come and have a good time ! they have lunch and happy hours specials . 100 percent recomended"}
{"text":"I have lived in Vegas for now over a year, and I have to say that by far this was the worst restaurant I have been too. 

When we first came in it looked fun, loud, dark - perfect for a younger crowd looking to have some fun. We decided to sit outside because Vegas weather is to be enjoyed as much as possible and were quickly concerned by the size of the menu. 

I have never seen a menu this large. Yes 2 pages are of the brews that they have on tap but the other 5 pages (back and front) are of food they serve. They serve pizza, soup, salad, vegetarian, tacos, fish, sushi, dessert, sandwiches, burgers, pasta EVERYTHING. This is when I got nervous. Usually when I see a menu over 2 pages I'm wondering if they're a \"Jack of all trades and a King of NONE.\" As I looked through the menu every item had this grandiose listing of ingredients that looked as if they belonged in a high end restaurant. As far as I knew I was in a restaurant that cherished beer and was named the \"YARD HOUSE\". It was obvious that they were overcompensating or just flat out LYING about what they put in their food. After reading a novel of a menu for over 10 minutes I thought I had finally decided what I wanted. I ordered a ranch side salad and their \"famous\" mac n cheese. My husband ordered a BBQ burger - well done with french fries. We did not order any brew. 

When they brought out my salad I was surprised to see that they had used a hot plate to serve my cold salad. It did not help the taste. The lettuce itself was very weak and not crunchy at all like Iceberg lettuce generally is. After eating a few bites I saw something dark and shiny in the bottom of my bowl...I began to dig it out and realized that it was a long thin dark black hair. I stopped eating. 

A few minutes after I stopped eating I asked for our waitress to take the salad away due to the hair and she apologized and asked if I would like something else instead. Just to be safe I ordered the Caesar salad. The salad quickly came out within two minutes and I was excited to try it because I LOVE Caesar dressing. I took a huge bite and for some reason my nose and my pallete tasted and smelled something skunky...I had assumed it may have been the man who had just walked by and continued to take another bite. After that bite I knew it was the dressing. The Yard House had tried to \"remake\" caesar dressing and it was awful. It tasted like someone had just rubbed their dirty gym sock all over my salad. I didn't take another bite.



Shortly after that our meals had arrived and as I am the BIGGEST mac and cheese fan I was super excited to taste their rendition of an old favorite. They had used some \"fancy\" pasta with a few different cheeses, chicken, bacon, mushrooms and a bread crumble on top. The cheese sauce was good, the pasta itself was way overcooked and too soft, the bacon was soft..which was not appealing and some of the chicken was cold as if they had frozen slices and just heated them for the dish. I pushed everything but the pasta and the cheese to the side and tried to enjoy it. After a couple of bites I started to feel really sick. I'm not really sure what caused it but I honestly felt like I was going to throw up. It might have had something to do with the fact that a few seconds before the table next to us OUTSIDE had ordered fish and I was drowning in bad fish odor at our table. My husband even complained of the stench. That fish was IN NO WAY FRESH. It smelt like rotten salmon that had been sitting under a heat lamp all day. I almost gagged when they first brought it out. I think that, and the combo of feeling like I ate a dirty sock and soft pasta may have made me sick. 


My husband said that his burger was alright, and the fries were okay, but really stringy. 

Halfway into eating my mac and cheese a woman came out to speak to me about the hair that I had found in my salad. She let me know that it was NOT a hair, and that it was actually corn silk, left over from the \"fresh\" corn they had just chucked to make my salad. I've eaten fresh corn, canned corn and frozen corn all of my life. They have very distinct differences. I know, that that was frozen corn. It was gooey and hard to chew, fresh corn just pops in your mouth. I don't know why anyone had come out to argue with me about what I found in my salad. Last time I chucked corn the silk was usually white to a yellowish color. Not BLACK. Nice try though.



Anyway, my husband and I both left feeling very nauseous and the drive back to Henderson was NOT a pleasant one. The entire drive home I was trying my hardest not to throw up. I don't want to explain what the rest of my night was like but I'm sure you get the picture. We wont be back here."}
{"text":"We had a great time last night a party of 12. We had the best seats in the house next to the only fire pit in the building. The food was amazing the flavor of the lamb burger was so moist. I ordered a salad but they forgot it. Once it came I can say it was worth the wait. It was fresh honestly the best house salad I ever had. Great selection of beers. Enjoyed the amazing hefier weizen. Next time I'll go and enjoy the large bar and just chow down on appetizers."}
{"text":"Amazing!! I can't remember the bartender name (starts with an E) but she was phenomenal, knew the menu top to bottom, and overall gave A+ customer service. 

I ordered the pork burger and it was such a great choice. I recommend this place to anyone :)"}
{"text":"All good! Food, Beer, atmosphere & service. So yelp wants a loooonger review so I'm typing more but said it all in the first sentence. Sometimes short and sweet and to the point is good enough"}
{"text":"Ok so I'm actually a big fan of this place; great happy hour and food is mostly good. So we won a visa giftcard of $100 and decided to celebrate at this yardhouse earlier...everything from the food, drinks, and service was going great until the bill came of $160. Ok so we explained to the waitress to charge $100 on the card and the rest will just be cash of $80 which the change would be her tip...she comes back to us saying the card wouldn't go through because ''giftcards like this takes out a percentage,'' so she claimed she tried swiping $95, $90, $85, and finally the amount of $80 went through. She also said it took out an extra $12 as the ''percentage that goes to the back to the bank.'' we made sure to ask if that $12 goes to her and she said \"NO.\" ok nothing seems to make sense, so I called customer service and they told us that the reason why the amount didn't go through BECAUSE they charged the amount of $115, $113, $110 (so obviously it wouldn't go through BECAUSE the card only contains $100!!!) and that extra $12 was charged as a gratuity for the restaurant, it doesn't go back to the bank merchant...So this waitress PRETTY MUCH LIED to our face not realizing we won't call the customer service of the card!!! They obviously keep track of every single swipe and was able to tell us what amount they charged us. She purposely charged more than $100 into making us think that it won't go through and charged that extra $12 for tip but lying that it doesn't go to her so we can give her more money...that is just plain SHADY! are u freaking kidding me? Why would she lie like that? Has other waiters here done this as their way to pocket more tips? It's not about the amount that gets me, it's this dishonesty that really boggles my mind! It was such a disappointment because she was accommodating but forget that when you're dishonest! Normally patrons would have made a fuss over this but I'm not like that, we just left but I would like to talk to a manager about this tomorrow because that's just wrong. We were willing to give her 25% tip but we're not as stupid as she thought we were so we left. She still got that $12 though so whatever."}
{"text":"I came in yesterday at 8pm. My friend and I were seated right away. We ordered our appetizer. When I came back from the restroom, the appetizer and check was at the table. Not once when we ate did the waitress come to ask how the food was. There was a table that ordered alcohol so I guess since we didn't order alcohol no one gave a shit about us. I paid the bill and left. The food was good but the service sucked. Good thing I got a free appetizer card in the mail. That was the only good thing about the meal. Won't be back. I would give zero stars if I had the option."}
{"text":"This would  normally be a 3 star review--A-OK--but the service we received takes the review to four stars and well deserved.

Our group came here after an Unofficial Yelp Event at Red Rock Canyon.  They set up for 10 because we weren't sure how many were coming.  We ended up with 8 so the set up was perfect.

Drink orders were taken quickly.  We must have looked like we could use rehydration after the 4.5 mile hike.  Refills were always quick to come.  My iced tea was refilled 3 times and our server brought two of us a glass with extra ice as our ice started melting.

For food, I ordered from their lunch pick two menu.  I got the turkey club with a bowl of clam chowder.  The club sandwich was good.  Each quarter had a piece of avocado which added to the flavor.  There were a lot of clams in the chowder.  It was enjoyable also.

The service.  Tina, our server, was simply top notch at what she does and that's the reason for the 4th star.  She was always around refilling drinks, checking on whether or not someone needed anything, and generally keeping the best care for us she could.  She also had an instinct of some kind such that she gave us individual checks without asking if it was one check or separate.  That's SERVICE!  

I'll be back.  Even though I live about 1/2 mile away, this was the first time I'd been at this Yard House.  Tina and the food won me over!"}
{"text":"If you love beer, then you'll love Yard House.

I love going here for happy hour because you get discounted brews and half off selected appetizers. The food here is solid to compliment your beer. It's a little more upscale bar food. There are more fancified dishes if you choose to go that route.

I really like the mac and cheese squared. It has truffle oil which is always a win with me. 

The service is pretty good most of the time. The servers are pretty attentive even when being slammed during happy hour. 

I went here for lunch the other day and they have decent lunch specials (around $7.95). I got the french onion soup paired with a crab cake hoagie which was pretty good. 

The food is decent but the selection of beer (over 100 drafts) is what you should go here for."}
{"text":"Great and friendly bartender. Just like hawaii's yardhouse with all the choices. We didn't get any food, so I can't rate it."}
{"text":"i actually would give this place 2 1/2 if I could. 
(COME ON YELP LET US GIVE 1/2 STARS!!!)

I think the presentation of the place is nice, and it is fun to come in a group for happy hour, but I think that in general it is over priced. In addition food that should be amazing just isn't.  I have had most of the things on their menu.

Eh.. Fun for a date but no so fun if you are a foodie."}
{"text":"This place was terrible I have been there a dozen times and this one was terrible first we asked for a table on the patio (it's our date night) and we got one in the dining room that's fine we were gonna order a few beers and make a night out of it well me and my wife still have our under 21 Ids which is fine I know state law blah blah blah whatever the waitress could've told us that they could serve us alcohol her manager had to tell us after we had ordered food....if we had known that this was the case we would've just left....when the food got there both burgers were cooked well done when the were supposed to be rare....it was a ridiculous experience and we will probably never return"}
{"text":"Ordered only appetizers and they were all great in flavor!! My favorite was their spare ribs, the flavor was to die for, they also serve it with rice. I also enjoyed their ahi poke dish, it was so good!!"}
{"text":"The Yard House is actually a pretty good restaurant.Great list of beers, diverse menu, and not to mention excellent service. The management seems to always want to ensure that you have had everything that you need and an excellent meal. They also have a nice and affordable wine menu that is very diverse. Whoever picked it did a great job. We have been there two times since they opened in the last couple of months and we will go again. I highly recommend you at least try this restaurant and you will not be disappointed. We also recommend the calamari, as well as a lobster and artichoke dip."}
{"text":"Oh boy.....I have never had a bad experience here until tonight. We went in with 8 guests around 6pm on a Wednesday night. 

1. When I asked for (2) 4 tops- it was like pulling teeth. It was obvious that it was more of a burden. Which I get it's a pain in the a** but you as a employee you should NEVER make it seem like a burden in front of the Customer. Allison was very rude. 

2. WAITED 30 minutes to be seated on an empty patio- which probably was empty in the first place, which was never an option until I asked for the 3rd time. 

3. Didn't get our drinks/apps for some time. Never saw the waiter more then 3 times during our entire hour and half stay. 

4. Everyone had ordered and received their food within 30 mins. EXCEPT ME (THE HOST) no runner, waiter, etc. even asked about our food or if we were okay. I sat there without a plate the ENTIRE time.  

After everyone was done- they finally came to collect everyone's finished plates and that was when they realized- I had no food...it was quite impressive the lack of customer service that was displayed. 

Manager came over said he wouldn't charge for the food I wasn't even given (irony). But he was extremely sorry- after talking with the manager he offered a $50 gift card which would be mailed in 2 weeks.

This experience was unbelievably bad....I might never go to this location again because of this reason. I will be contacting corporate/regional manager with names about this terrible experience. 

Just a warning- you may not get food....."}
{"text":"food is excellent and looks amazing-like a fine dining restauarant. its upscale classic american food like steaks and fries.  be prepared it is expensive. however the service is pretty good and they have over 150 beers on tap-crazy. a lot of the beers are good like purple haze and they have beer samplers. it does get crowded in there and it seems like they could use a bigger space-but testament that a lot of ppl like this place. also its in a great location next to total wine and the desert ridge outdoor shopping mall."}
{"text":"I love Yard House and this location is probably the best I've been to. The service, the food and the atmosphere were perfect. My group and I enjoyed our meal. It's hard to find a good place to eat on the strip, so I would recommend Yard House to anyone!"}
{"text":"Well, I usually go there to order two things, the blacken pepper gonzola burger or Chicken garlic noodles EXCELLENT! but this time I went during happy hour and they had great presentation on food, but my son and I were not thrilled on the California Roll. The rice was mushy, and there wasn't much seaweed on it. I took a photo and you can see for yourself. Other than that, the service was great. I just wouldn't recommend that California Roll."}
{"text":"This place has become a vegetarian's wet dream. In addition to having a killer beer selection, they have incorporated faux meats into their menu, thus veggifying over a dozen selections. I've had the fake meat in a salad, and it's very realistic - almost too much so! However, the most amazing item on the menu has nothing to do with fake meat: the grilled cheese. 

TO. DIE. FOR. 

Seriously one of the top 5 grilled cheeses. The tomatoes inside are roasted so they're sweet, warm, soft, and flavorful (as opposed to the usual sad treatment tomatoes get: simply sliced and put in the middle, cold, thus ensuring the surrounding cheese will never get hot enough to melt). The accompanying tomato soup is delicious as well. I snarfed it all down and practically licked the plate clean.

The service is always prompt and friendly also. 

Minus a wee fraction of a star because smoking is allowed on the patio."}
{"text":"Great place. It's a chain, but we wanted a place where we could try some local beers. This was just that. With a crazy long beer list our waiter was awesome and recommended some based on our normal preferences. He was spot on. The happy hour specials were great and tasty! Sweet potato fries were perfection!! Was glad to find out we have one close to home!!"}
{"text":"Pretty flawless experience. Astounding array of beers on tap (although they ran out of the one I wanted initially). Very friendly staff and good food. They accommodated a custom order and it came out right. They threw in an extra half artichoke since one of the halves was smaller. Good prices and atmosphere too - like an upscale sports bar."}
{"text":"This location is really big on Service, the bartenders cum servers are knowledgable and courteous. Our bartender surely took the time to ensure you like the beers (tasting) before we order - there is so much to choose from. 
With a large selection of beers, Yard House also has a great menu. 
Must have when in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Trying them again.......So I went to the yardhouse again tonight for dinner with a friend. I haven't tried dinner service in a while. I must say that the food and service was much better during dinner than the past few times I've been there for lunch. I'm giving them 3 stars because they didn't ask if I wanted another martini after I finished my first and the steak was very under seasoned."}
{"text":"It's been so long since I have posted a review and given it five stars. I was so satisfied with my meal at yard house yesterday.

I ordered their version of California roll which was simply amazing with a warm crispy rice beneath fresh crab and some delicious sauces. We also ordered the chicken garlic noodles which were outstanding and the PO KE stack. All items were Asian inspired and really hit the mark. 

Looks like they have a great happy hour which we will be attending soon. 

Hopefully they keep up the Quality as this is going to be a mainstay for me"}
{"text":"After hearing rave reviews from coworkers me and a couple friends finally went on 11-1-2013. We got there at 8pm and sat outside. The waitress took our drink and appetizer order while we waited for our friend. She delivered the drinks and appetizers yet there were no plates nor silverware and napkins on the table. She then turned us over to another waiter who scrambled to get proper settings.The calamari was over cooked ( dark brown and crunchy ).  The main course came; surf and turf.  Lets start with the lobster sauteed in garlic butter; dried out piece of rubber that once looked like a piece of lobster. Hamburger, medium rare was more like medium sawdust burger. Little flavor with zero juices.  The one stalk of asparagus was okay. The fries were somewhat good. I don't know where they hid the bearnaise sauce but it wasn't on our plates.  All that said 3 of us was  $ 130.00 of  utter slop.  Save your cash for someplace that actually knows how to cook food."}
{"text":"I went to the Yard House location back in Florida and love it just the same. The food is really good. Since it was so pretty outside, we decided to sit outside under the covered area. It took a bit of time to be served our food, otherwise everything was great. Our server Kristen was really nice.  I will return in the near future"}
{"text":"This location is sooooo nice!! We sat outside on the upper level. Very nice ambiance and server. I got the gorgonzola burger and it was delicious!!! I really like this location and I'll return in the near future."}
{"text":"i love the chicken nachos when they are $5 and the clam chowder is off the chain!! I drink Framboise here love it!!"}
{"text":"I was split between a four/five. The drinks were fair prices.(don't go bigger than a pint because it isn't worth it financial). Food was delicious. Server was fast and good. The only thing was the noise (at some points had to yell across the table). But over all a great place for beer drinkers and food lovers. Would go back again."}
{"text":"The people are great in the front and I really hate to do this but I have to be honest First time here and last time here I was so sick after eating here."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to go have dinner on 8/21/2012 around 6:30 p.m.  They were not that busy but after Lauren the \"hostess\" took our request for a table for two inside she asked us to sit down.  Three other parties came in and were seated before us (they were not asked to sit down).  My wife and I observed this and my wife asked Lauren when our table would be ready.  Lauren asked her how many was her party for again and did we want to sit inside or outside.  Really did not make us feel that the Yardhouse was interested in our business so we went elsewhere and let the manager know on our way out why we were leaving.  He (did not catch the manager's name) wanted to know how many were in our party and he would get us a table right away.  Apparently you do not have to count past one to work at the Yardhouse and need to give your party size more than three times.  This local is not going back."}
{"text":"It was a bit hard to choose between 3 or 4 stars but 4 stars only cause of what they have on tap.

I'm sure for like many, I was there for a movie and went to go grab a beer prior to the show.  We sat at the bar and ordered Ephemer, they didn't have it. (the only reason why I went there in the first place) got the Sam Adams summer ale instead.  Ordered wings but took like 20 mins for the staff to realize the printer was broken in the kitchen. 10 mins later, by the time we actually got the wings the movie was starting in 5min, so we decided to catch the next showing.  

For those of you that like only the drum stick and not the wing of the chicken, this would be perfect.  They only serve the drum sticks that are breaded.  I would assume because they had to get it out of the kitchen so fast the chicken was not done all the way.  Still had a bit of pink by the bones.  We did not finish it.  

They did take the wings off the check but the service was not as attentive as I would expect in a place where they have such an exotic selection of beers.  For someone that does not know about beers would feel intimidated and inclined to just order a bud light cause of the lack of help.  

Overall it was not the best first impression, but they have a great product and I will visit again for the beers."}
{"text":"Nice salad and great beer selection.  Clearly something for every taste.   Service was average wish they knew their product better and showed some excitment"}
{"text":"I have to say this is the best place we have eaten at ever and we eat out a lot! Everything was phenomenal from the service, to my cucumber berry soda, to our appetizer, to our salad, to our entree and dessert! We were very impressed from the get go and couldn't wait to see what else was in store. To top it all off our server Vanessa was so friendly and attentive! We highly recommended this place and definitely will be back!!"}
{"text":"We love this location. Everyone is friendly and helpful and it does not hurt that the food is good too plus their selection of beers is huge.

Just got done with an early dinner tonight. Our server, Summer was awesome! We had Hawaiian Poke stack and edamame for starters and wow! The poke was so fresh and very flavorful. I could have eaten it the whole night. The edamame was spicy and garlicky and buttery...yum! For our entrees, it's surf and turf burger, chicken garlic noodles, a Korean short taco and Korean pork belly taco. The garlic noodles was extremely good. I was not too sold on the surf and turf burger even with the lobster meat but hubby loved it. The pork belly taco was good, a little fatty for me but what do you expect from a pork belly? It was perfect with the kimchi. Didn't get to try the Korean short rib taco because we were too full. Brought home the taco and most of the garlic noodles for later.

There's only one negative thing I could think of. It's that they are on the other side of town :("}
{"text":"Decided to have dinner with family here on a Saturday, it was super busy. We waited about 2@ mins. Which wasn't too bad. The booth's were spacious, which I liked. Very clean (even restrooms). The food was great! 

You must try the carne Asada  with shrimp stack. And/or the swordfish tacos. Both are unbelievable.

I don't recommend the kids mac and cheese. It was okay, but had a gritty texture... to each their own though.

Beer selection is probably one the best in the area, so much to choose from! 

I will be going back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The menu has so many great choices it was hard to decide. The staff was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Over 100 beers on tap, sports on TV, super friendly bar tenders, and, big for me: tons of Vegan/Vegetarian options"}
{"text":"Yelp Challenge! Started 8/20/2011 (15 of 365).

My usual order during happy hour goes something like this; don't worry, I share it with one other person!

- Truffle Fries.  It's not on the Happy Hour list but it's only $4.  You can't go wrong with that considering truffle oil costs $20 a bottle!  These fries are bomb!

-Garlic Noodes w/ Shiitake mushrooms.  Sounds simple but the dish is really flavorful.

-Sliders.  Pastrami or Classic.  You can never go wrong with these especially at 4 fairly sized sliders for $6.95 during Happy Hour!  They don't come in your natural hamburger bun, they come in sweet rolls; yum!  You can substitute your fries on this dish for more Truffle fries.   That's how I do!

-Ahi Sashimi.  This is good paired with the Garlic Noodles.  

Some other items to try of course are their pizzas.  They're all pretty good, pretty big, and half price during happy hour!  Awesome.  

I like sititng in the booths here because they are a perfect distance from the bar and TVs to watch the current sports games while you eat, plus its a good view to people watch.  Sometimes it's nice to eat outside on their patio as well.  Their brownie dessert is pretty good too if you have room for it! Oh, and don't forget the beer.  They have a wide variety to choose from and you can have a whole YARD size glass to yourself.  Good luck with that!"}
{"text":"Beer selection is outstanding, spacious spot and the apps are the focus on the menu. Vampire tacos a must with baked cheese on the outside, OMG. Then Ahi Poke, fresher then anything we had all week long. Great place for beer, apps and a break from the craziness that goes on...... an always welcome break from the action!"}
{"text":"First time at Yard House, but I had heard a lot about it from friends.

Pros: 
1. The food was great and came out in a timely manner.
2. Amazing drinks selection. If beer is your thing head on over.
3. Servers are friendly and attentive. 
4. Ambience is perfect for a night out with friends or a casual first date. 
5. Bathrooms are clean with roughly 5 stalls so there wasn't really a line for the ladies. (Important for me)

Cons:
1. Each server has their own table and if you need something you have to look for your server. My husband and I had our hand up for a good 5 minutes and heard other servers ask each other who our server was before finally heading over to ask what we would like. I understand why they did this but all we wanted was some hot sauce...haha

2. Their menu has such variety it threw me off a little. I like consistency because it means they specialize in certain foods. And it's easier to choose.

What we had:
Fried mac&cheese (was not in love with it)
Truffle oil fries (loved it)
Mediterranean Salmon (loved it)
Korean BBQ tacos (husband liked it)
Dessert trio sampler (chocolate soufflé was the best)"}
{"text":"Love the different kinds of brews. FOOD IS AWESOME! I had a steak salad and it's the best ever~ will definitely go again next time when I visit Vegas!"}
{"text":"Lot of variety of beers favorite beer Hoegaarden
  The food is no big deal....
  Everybody at the bar are cool people the only way to enjoy the Yard House is sitting at the bar"}
{"text":"Great happy hour, thats for sure. It will keep me coming back! Beer selection is AMAZING. I'd steer clear from any \"signature cocktails\" because everything they use \"dekyuper\" in everything which 1) makes everything overly sweet 2) clearly these drinks are overpriced. Most cocktails tasted like Four Loko, so why not drink the Four Loko at a cheap price and really have an 'experience'

Food is mediocre but its easy to bring a group of people here because, just like the beer, they have a little something for everyone. Artichoke and Wings were delicious.

Service is always a little slow. My bartender seemed a little confused and scatterbrained. Its Sunday and its not even busy. The other bartender did not even acknowledge my presence. But the barback was very attentive on how he could actually help in any way possible.

Our Halibut and Filet were literally drowned in sauce, so I'd recommend sauce on the side. Wedge salad was good, but we had an up-charge for bacon! Wedge salad standard is wedge, bacon, bleu cheese. Simple. Its like charging me extra for my bacon on a bacon cheeseburger! 
When we sat at the table, the girl was incessantly hovering over us. I get it, you are there. We are also a table of four- two couples who are clearly just trying to have a relaxed dinner. Its not busy and I know I'm not taking up your table! Give me some space, please!

All in all, its not bad. Always consistent so you know what to expect. Mediocre food and great beer. I'll be back, not sure when, but I'll be back.

Side note- We tried to watch a hockey game that was clearly playing at Sports Booking next door, but they couldn't play it here. If you have that many TVs, invest in some NHL/NFL/NBA packages. Yard House has the potential for a great sports bar, and we all know Summerlin needs a good sports bar and if you played every game, every time, I'd be here all day everyday."}
{"text":"I could have cried, everything here is perfect. The best beer selection in the world, and the food is OUT of this world! There are items for every diet, whether vegan or meat-fanatic, lean and \"comfort\".
We started with mu shoo egg rolls (in addition to being fun to say, it kicks taste bud booty) and Korean BBQ beef (SUPER authentic and delicious!). The honey ale is great and the Rogue Hazelnut Brown Nectar is superb. I got the Hawaiian burger and it did NOT disappoint. Truffle fries too?! Oh my goodness.
I have gone around the menu and everything I get is unbelievable, seriously throw a dart at the menu and get that item, because it will be awesome.

My only qualm- open one up in Chandler!"}
{"text":"We only had appetizers but they were all good and the beer was great as well.   Would definitely return if we had the opportunity."}
{"text":"Friendly attentive service at the bar, tons of beers to try but I had a lemon martini and it was fabulous.  

We also had the fish taco appetizer and it was full of flavor but I was bummed that we had just missed the Happy Hour which is half off from 4-6 p.m.  If you are a lover of beer come here you'll have quite a selection to choose from.  Ask for a sample first if you're not sure what you want.

Located inside the Red Rock Casino."}
{"text":"Love this place, especially for happy hour.  Yard House is a perfect fit for Red Rock Resort, you have inside dining and a patio or outdoor seating right next to the entrance.  They have a lot of items to offer and the portion size for happy hour isn't changed.  Take advantage.  They have a lot of beers to choose from also though I'm not impressed with their wine selection.  

They have a separate gluten free menu so be sure to ask for it if you're on a gluten free diet.  

Just be weary if you're here for happy hour, sometimes they jack the price up or input it in \"error\" and charge you full price.  sneaky sneaky"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite spot in Town Square..  I love their burgers, usually eat these when I'm watching a football game.  I love the bar, bartenders always walk by so you can always find one to get you your cocktail.  I also experiment when it comes to the drinks, there's so many to choose from.  If I'm bored I'll grab their beer samplers and afterwards choose and stick with one while I'm there.  

Happy hour makes me happy here too!

But my last excursion here we had Lisa as our server, she was great.  And afterwards we chilled at the bar and Christian took care of us.  It's always a good time but Christian went above and beyond and was always on top of our drinks and service."}
{"text":"I gotta admit, I'm a pretty big fan.  I like cheap.  I like tasty.  This review is for the Happy Hour part at Yard House...I've never eaten any regular meals there!  Everytime we've gone, it's for Happy Hour.  Yes, Yard House does keep me happy!  Just look at my check-ins for this place.

OK, yes, it's bar food, and yes, it's nothing overly stellar.  But for what they do it is remarkable in terms of food.  And the prices!  You can easily get away for feeding a group of four for under $35.  Take your kids, take your friends, double date!  A good time can be had for little cost.

Yard House has Happy Hour M-F from 3 PM - 6 PM, Sun-Wed from 10 PM - Close.  Lots of opportunity to stock up on grub!  Our first time here was on a hunch since we were staying at Red Rock Casino at the time for my birthday.  We've been back at least twice a month since!  Payday = YHHH day (Yard House Happy Hour).

Most days, especially weekdays after 5 PM Yard House is packed!  The good thing about their Happy Hour is that you can sit ANYWHERE in the restaurant and partake in the cheapy goodness.  No need to only sit at the bar or the patio.  Happy Hour indeed!  We bring our kids quite often to eat with us.

For Happy Hour at Yard House there is a plethora of food and drink selections.  Pints (of a $hi+load of different choices) go fron $3.75 - $5.75 range.  Half yards go from the $7.50 - $10.00 range, house martinis are $6.50, and specialty drinks and wine by the glass are $2.00 off.  But honestly, I come for the food!  For me Yard House does not disappoint!

Yard House has a bunch of appetizers and pizzas that are 1/2 price during Happy Hour.  Choices abound, variety too!  Some of our most ordered faves:

-Spicy Thai Chicken or BBQ Chicken Pizza
-Fried Calamari
-Hawaiian Poke Stack (most def a fave)
-Onion Ring Tower
-Chicken Nachos (another fave)
-Seared Ahi Sashimi (yet another fave)
-Spicy Tuna Roll (it's not sushi but we like it anyway)
-Buffalo Wings
-Chicken or Mushroom Lettuce Wraps

On most occasions we will have nearly all these items on our table!  We are piggies!  It's a good thing the tables at Yard House are HUGE.  No matter though, whatever we don't finish we take home for leftovers later!  Although we ALWAYS end up finishing the Hawaiian poke stack and the seared ahi.  Those are very ONO.  

Yard House doesn't offer sushi like other Happy Hour joints around Las Vegas but no matter.  Their food usually fits the bill pretty good.  Another plus?  Each dish available during Happy Hour ranges from $5 - $8...and they are full appetizer servings!  Cheap, and lots of it.  A very good choice for decent eats in the Summerlin area!

I have a beer (or three), and a few appetizers and I'm as happy as a clam during Happy Hour.  It is a good time.  Service is very courteous and pretty quick, even during peak Happy Hour time.  Keep up the cheap eats Yard House, I will be back!  H-A-P-P-Y H-O-U-R"}
{"text":"Pretty decent food, I was pleasantly surprised. Huge portions on the salads. I mean, huge. For real. Great service. The chicken tortilla soup was thick, way heartier than I expected, but good nonetheless. And fish tacos were good too. The rice and beans? Take it back. I can do better from a can or a box of instant. 

Oh, btw, my friend got sick and threw up a little later that night, but I'm not sure if it was the food from here cuz I ate the same thing and felt fine.. well, you've been warned!"}
{"text":"I strongly recommend this restaurant. Good businesses deserve to be knows to the public.  

The food was great as usual . the selection of beer was too crazy I I only had over 120 choices 
service was also unbelievably nice. 
Thank you for providing a nice night with my friends and family last night."}
{"text":"Everytime I go, this place can be hit or miss.  Either the food's great and the service sucks or the service is good and the food is blah.  The sliders, crab cakes and chocolate souffle are probably the only things that keep me coming back for more."}
{"text":"Great service and all the food was perfect.   Ordered the Ahi Crunchy Salad and it was amazing. Will come here again anytime I am in the area. I saw the Mac and Cheese2 and it looked great."}
{"text":"looove the yard house defiantly get the moo shoo egg roles booooommmmbbb!!! great beer selection great food i prefer to hang outside to people watch i am addicted to the cherry wheat beer 1/2 yard mmm mmm good great place gets busy n packed quick on the weekends so order ur drinks as soon as u gt there so u can gt drunk as u wait for seating to open up as long as u can deal with bandwagon beer snobs ( i only drink ipa's even tho i dont know wut the fuck an ipa is n drank pbr a month ago )ur all to the good great location (west gate one of the few places west gate has to offer......side note:west gate what a let down it just never popped like the east valley a shame cuz im a HUGE west side advocate...anyway the yard house its worth the wait n money go check it out....oh n gt the asian wings to......"}
{"text":"Brandon was a great bartender. Really nice and helpful when deciding on all the beer choices. Loved his recommendations. Def try the young berry chocolate if u want a dessert beer the only reason I'm giving this review 3 starts and not 5 is because being vegetarian its disappointing when u order a gardein pizza and after eating u realize it wasn't vegetarian at all. It def wasn't his fault. Another server had asked if we wanted something else and we should have stuck w the same bartender to begin with.orher than that, next time we go Vegas well def be stopping by to visit Brandon again"}
{"text":"Visit on 1/21/12

Normally I experience a 4 at The Yard House but this experience was a 2 at best...I'm giving them a 3 for benefit of the doubt.  Service was s  l  oooooooooow... It was semi-busy but we have been there at busier times.  We started with the onion rings-tasty as usual.  My husband ordered the grilled pastrami which he said was very good.  I had the Thai chicken Noodle salad.  There was a generous serving of perfectly grilled chicken strips on the salad.  The noodles were slightly tough but otherwise a tasty dish.

The music was extremely loud during our visit.  We gave up on talking.  Getting our check took at least 10 minutes until my husband had to ask another passing waiter."}
{"text":"We met here for a work dinner.  They lost our reservation,  and we had to wait to be seated.   It wasn't too long of a wait but there's no reason a reservation should ever get lost.   The service was good and the food was good to.  They did a good job of keeping our drinks filled and attending to our needs.  We sat outside to have a more quiet atmosphere.l, my biggest complaint is that people were smoking that's not necessarily a deal breaker for everyone but it is for me."}
{"text":"Went here for a dinner with 2 other couples for my hubbies birthday after a CMYE Yelp event. I couldn't decide since the menu is good sized, and everything sounded really good. They have \"Snacks\" around $3 - $5, Appetizers $6-10 and Entrees $10+. I decided on the waitress' recommendation of the Spicy Chicken Sandwich on flat bread with Truffle fires. I guess it depends what you order, the burgers and sandwiches come with a side, but not sure about other items. My sandwich was AMAZING. I did add avocado to it too! I was stuffed at the end and it wasn't a healthy meal but it wasn't heavy either. I'd definitely go back. Remember if you are ordering mixed drinks to say \"light ice\" or you will get 3/4 cup ice and a few drops of alcohol :p"}
{"text":"Kinda bummed this trip. Shoulda stuck to my usual favorite of the Mac n cheese or grilled cheese sandwich and tomato bisque. 
Tried their lobster garlic noodles. You'd think with a dish called lobster garlic there'd be garlic flavor right? It was very bland, dry and salty. Not much going on for such an intriguing dish. 
Glad I had my favorite appetizer (chicken lettuce wraps) and a cup of the tomato bisque or it would have been a total bust. 
Since my guy and I split everything we saved room for dessert. Ordered the baked brownie with a scoop of caramel ice cream. It says that it takes 15 minutes to bake and come out. Ours was about 25. Think our waitress forgot about it along with our drink refills. 
Normally I'd rate yard house higher and be very happy. I guess the moral of the story is stick to what you know you like."}
{"text":"First of all, I have to say I was super happy that the chef was willing to make my lobster garlic noodles without dairy. That was a great impression and I really appreciated it. Which, the lobster garlic noodles were delicious, so if you can eat dairy I'm betting theyre even more delicious! 
My husband got the Nashville hot chicken, and the sweet potato pancakes are literally little pancakes. The orange syrup that went with the dish was really tasty too! 
The restaurant is big, spacious, and clean and modern. Our server was very friendly and efficient. 
Everything else in the immediate area of Crocker park is your typical chain restaurants, so the Yard House was a pleasant change of pace. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance.  We sat outside and it was on a deck overlooking the street below.  I had the Mac and Cheese 2 which  had bacon, chicken mushrooms and some other stuff.  The description in the menu sounded better than it tasted.  It was not bad but kudos to whoever writes the copy for the menu.

The menu is varied and when I'm in Vegas again, I will probably go back and try something else."}
{"text":"As a vegan, it is very hard to find good food besides salad and plain pasta at chain dining restaurants.  That being said, Yard House offers an entire section offering Gardein, a delicious meat alternative suitable for vegans and vegetarians.  HOWEVER, beware because they cook it on the same grill as the rest of the meat.  They were nice enough to cook my meat substitute in a separate pan so that my meal was still vegan, and it was pretty decent.  It was great when we were in a bind for time, as they got us in and out of there as quickly as possible and the waiter was very nice and attentive.  It is really loud and busy there, not exactly my cup of tea.  However, they were able to accommodate me despite the business and I am super happy about that.  I would definitely come back to this location, as many other Yardhouses are not willing to cook the vegan meat separately."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. The staff that takes my order is always patient and helpful and the food has always been good."}
{"text":"It has been a few months since we went to a Yard House and it felt so good to have this experience again. First off the music creates a vibe that transports one back in time and the hockey game on all over the place adds to it. Our server was great and explained that it was happy hour so we tried the four cheese pizza . And they were half off yeah. 

The atmosphere that Yard House creates for the guest is very laid back and chilled. One almost feels over dressed since not in flip flops and shorts when you come in. The inside dining is great and all. But secondly, they offer outside dining and the use of heat lamps in the winter and shade awnings in the summer. They used to have a fire place that guests could dine by, but it's no longer here. 

Thirdly, I tried the sunset margarita and I had three of them by the time the second margarita came it just seems that the alcohol gets a little stronger each time, but it's probably just me. We experienced desert with the try 3 plate. It featured creme brûlée, Apple cobbler, and a chocolate mousse. They were all delectable."}
{"text":"My fiance and I visit this restaurant often, we love the atmosphere and variety of the menu.  Lately I've been addicted to the grilled cheese sandwich with tomatoes and bacon. It usually comes with tomato bisque, which my man always gets, but I prefer the rich, creamy, clam chowder.  We went last Sunday, my sandwich could've been more golden brown, but the bacon was super crispy and the cheese very gooey so that made up for it.  The clam chowder was very hot and generous with the clams.  Service was o.k., I finished a glass of water and put the empty glass where the waitress could see it but she passed it many times before I stopped her and asked for a refill.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I like to talk about food. We got on the topic of cheese curds one day, where I was taught the importance of breaded vs battered (battered is better!) and also where the best cheese curds in the Valley are. I was told that Yard House has good cheese curds, but was a bit expensive. When my family came into town and wanted to get American, it felt like the perfect moment. \"Why not Yard House?\"

We went on a Saturday for lunch. I hadn't looked at the menu beforehand, and thought the prices were a bit high; however, I was happily surprised to hear that the lunch combos were available daily. We ordered cheese curds (of course) to share, and my coworkers were right. The cheese curds were GOOOD. I especially loved the honey hot sauce that came with it, though my parents found the horseradish aioli the bigger star. Just thinking about them right now is making me hungry. 

I got the shiitake garlic noodles with a kale caesar salad. Though the flavor was nice, the noodles were overcooked and seemed like they sat out for a while, because they were slightly congealed. The caesar had good textures and a nice lightness to it. My dad and brother got burgers, which they were also unimpressed by. All in all, a pretty average experience."}
{"text":"My mom and I went in yesterday and sat at the bar. When we first got there, there was one bartender at the beginning of her shift and she was working her butt off! Eventually managers and other bartenders started showing up and helping. We had really great service. Liberty did a wonderful job! 
The beer selection was great. I even got my mom to like some beers and she is not a beer drinker. We loved having the option of ordering a shorty because then we could try multiple beers on tap.
The food was pretty good as well. We ordered off of the happy hour appetizers. I really enjoyed the crab cakes.
Thank you for the great service! We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Yard House is pretty good. I can't give it more than 3 stars because every time I go, the wait is horrible and the customer service isn't the best either. They have messed up my to go order the last two times I went in, on top of the \"medium rare\" ribeye being so rough, that is tasted like I was eating a horses saddle. 

I will only go back if I'm out of all options and want a good desert. Their salted Carmel pudding is good."}
{"text":"I'm not a beer drinker but I'm always motivated to try a brewskie or two when I'm here. How can you not?!?!? They claim to have the \"world's largest selection of draft beer\"... so I figure I'll find one I like and generally speaking I always do :)

If you're there for food: come hungry! They have huge and tasty portions so it's nearly impossible to stop eating if there's food in front of you.

I can go for some seared ahi sashimi, right now!"}
{"text":"I like Yardhouse but the main thing I don't like is the price. Recently I went and they added a small plates part of the menu which was nice!

We sat outside for a birthday dinner and it was super windy and a bit cold but they had heaters going.

I don't have much to say except our server was nice. Very nice. She brought me extra pita chips for my hummus. Definitely better service than the town square location.

It's a cool chain. They have a big beer selection and drink menu.

Their food menu is pretty broad in choices also with pastas and burgers and even poke.

Their food is consistently good."}
{"text":"Went in recently to enjoy a few drinks before heading out of town. This is located near the airport. Main entrance is closer to the parking lot. There is a patio entrance but not really clear. 

We elected to sit at the bar to enjoy happy hour beverage specials. We were helped by Lauren and Taylor. Order of how we were helped remain fuzzy.

They were both friendly, attentive, and made sure we were well hydrated. Our bill was also settled fairly promptly. 

Some drinks offered and ordered that day included Old 43 and  Timmerman strawberry lambert. Old 43 a mixed drink with bourbon and citrus.  Timmerman strawberry lambert was on tap. One of the two was a bit more on the bourbon and the other was bit more sweet. Both good. The strawberry drink was good. Like a different type of cider malt beverage.

Overall good experience with staff and beverages times."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely delicious! Met up with family because they recommended this restaurant and I'm glad they chose this place. Such good service and very delicious food especially a good selection of Vegan meals which I chose from. Very delicious, will definitely eat here when I'm back in the state!"}
{"text":"Meh. I already am kinda opposed to the Yardhouse since it's a chain and all, but a group planned to watch a football game  here, so I decided to stop by with the fam. 
Food is ok. Here we had the artichoke (2 stars), homemade potato chips (3 stars, which is good cuz I usually don't like those things), and wings (3.5 stars). 
Beer selection is very good, if a little predictable. 
Atmosphere is cool. It's in the Linq. We had 3 tvs devoted to our football game, which was definitely not a top 25 matchup. 
Service sucks. Slow. Never checked in for refills/new beers. Literally scowled at our 3 year old for standing within 2 feet of the servers bar. Honestly, I would excuse all this if they were busy, but the whole place was only about 1/3 full! You're professional servers on Las Vegas Blvd! Get it together!
Did I mention prices are a lil high (avg for the Linq)? Overall, I'll avoid this place."}
{"text":"In Las Vegas for a meeting and found the Yard House in the Linq entertainment district. We have been to the one in San Diego and hoped this place was as good. 
This Yard House was amazing. A two story restaurant with a huge keg room on the second floor that could handle 145-155/160 different types of beer. All beers are served on tap only. Some domestic beers but most were craft beers from all over the world. Full bar mixed drinks and specialty drinks are available too. 
We started with a calamari appetizer served with cocktail sauce and tartar sauce. Very tasty. 
The food was excellent. We ordered the teriyaki chicken with pineapple and a side of fried rice. Chicken was very large portion and flavorful. Fried rice was a little bland but ok. The ginger salmon was extremely large portion. Perfectly prepared and not over cooked or dry. Topped with a string sweet potato fry over a bed of julienne carrots and snow peas. 
Aaron our server was excellent. Very attentive and friendly. A definite favorite place when visiting Las Vegas."}
{"text":"3 stars might be a little light 4 stars a little heavy.

I really do like the Yard house I really do!!!

It's a chain and it's Very Corporate, However in This Yard House locale at Fashion Square Mall, it servers them well, Service was fine, except it came from so many people, nobody had command of the service experience at our table. We had to constantly ask for what we wanted/needed for our table of 6, and it was delivered!

The food is always delicious and my favorite part of visiting YH. They have an amazing Calamari, and almost everything else is GREAT.

Lots of Craft and import beer selections, there are so many beers on tap, but I think they are based on margins not quality. A few of my favorite Belgian's and Micro's are nowhere to be found.

I have been to many Yard Houses all over the country because you can get a great meal in a pretty predicable restaurant/bar.

ORDER THE CALAMARI!!!!"}
{"text":"Came this week for happy hour with some girl friends & was impressed. The happy hour selection isn't bad at all - a few variety's of pizza, wings, and some other random items. I got the lettuce wraps to try to be a little *healthier* and they were sooo tasty ($7). They are placed in this delicious wonton type thing, I ate every bite. Also, wine was $2 off so mine went from $10 to $8, which is OK for happy hour, could have been a little better, but not a big deal."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to the Yard House. The first time we went to the one at Townsquare. It seems to me that the first time I just didn't have a good time or didn't order the right foods, but this time I really loved this place. First of all, we showed up for happy hour which was great. And this review might be a lot a review of their happy hour. My husband had a beer (Hefeweizen Dunkel) and I had a Gin and Tonic. They both were very good and the happy hour prices made me happy. 

Move on to the food: We ordered three of their appetizers (they were all on their happy hour menu), the Ahi sliders, their traditional bone in wings, and the Hawaii Poke Stake. We really enjoyed all of those things and it really was plenty of food. The wings were actually ordered by my husband, but I ended up eating more than him. He loves his wings soaked in sauce whereas I like mine more dry. These were more on the dry side and super good. The Ahi Sliders came with a medium sized basket of thinly sliced potato fries. They were very good spiced and nice and crunchy. I ate so much of those I was getting almost sick. And the Poke Stake? Oh man, it was delicious. 

Lesson learned: Always give places a second chance. This time it was really worth it."}
{"text":"This is an OK place in my eyes, wouldn't probably wanna go back unless its for the beer. The night itself was amazing because we were there with good friends and it was really fun. The restaurant itself didn't impress me so much and the food didn't exactly take me to an amazing culinary journey. 

First of all, I was really impressed by their beer selection. My husband and I shared a Hefeweissen dunkel und it tasted really smooth and good. The service was relatively fast for how crowded the place was. They were trying really hard I thought. Still it took 15 minutes for our waters to come out.

I guess I'm a little bit of a health freak and when I eat things I think about all the good things and bad things of the food for my body. I mean everything did have good flavors and was spiced pretty good, but I couldn't enjoy it so much and left the restaurant thinking 1. Am I going to fit through the door? 2. OMG I'm going to get a hearattache... 

The sweet potato fries were very very greasy and there was almost oil dripping from my fingers as I was eating my sandwich. Also, the food was kind of expensive I thought. The entrees were 10 dollars and up and didn't come with a side. They charge extra for the sides."}
{"text":"Excellent food, fun/festive atmosphere. A bit loud-not a place for serious discussions."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with my primo. It was good and affordable if you consider las Vegas prices.
A must try is the fried Mac and cheese.
We ordered 4 different dishes $36"}
{"text":"Like what other Yelpers stated already...loud and crowded.  Tough to hold a conversation unless you're at the bar or their patio dining. Always a wait everytime I've been here.  The last 2 times, I ate outside.  But sometimes you can be forgotten.

Now for the food...tough to rate them any different than a BJ's or Gordon Biersch.  I don't know what it is, but their food taste the same.  There is a selection here so you will have no issue finding what to eat.  I usually just get the salmon which is tough for anyone to mess up.  Usually go to a Yard House to socialize more than anything.  Price is little above a BJ's, but cheaper than a Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"My husband and I were meeting a friend at Town Square to do a little shopping, have dinner and then check out Ladies Night at Blue Martini. We decided to have dinner at Yard House. 

Although it seemed like it was really busy due to the number of people standing around near the hostess table, we only had to wait a couple minutes before being given the option to sit outside(quieter) or inside. We ended up sitting in a booth inside. 

A major reason to go to Yard House is the beer selection. I love Lindeman's Framboise, so when I saw the Youngberry Chocolate on the menu I had to try it.  It is Lindeman's Framboise & Young's Double Chocolate Stout and oh so tasty. 

For my meal, I had the Ahi Crunch salad was good but not great, mainly due to boring veggies. The ahi was seared perfectly and well seasoned, I think I would have been better off with the ahi poke bowl. 

We ended up skipping Blue Martini. Drinks were cheaper at Yard House for the guys (and martinis are always $10 at Yard House versus the $12+ pricetag at Blue Martini when it's not happy hour!!!) and the atmosphere was nice and laid back so we just stayed there. Yard House is definitely a place we will go back to."}
{"text":"Quick note about this Yard House....I have never been past the bar area.  This review is for my experience drinking and eating at the bar.  As for service, I have to give them at lest 4 stars.  The team here always makes sure that your fully hydrated with whatever you're drinking.  As for the food here, I've eaten at plenty Yard House's in Las Vegas and California.  When it comes to this specific Yard House, it's mainly just appetizers and during happy hour.  The calamari, seared ahi, and sliders are mu favorites here. I think prices are inexpensive, especially during HH, and because the service is pretty good, I have to state that I do recommend."}
{"text":"Husband ordered: 
- six sampler beer: ehhh. None of them were really great
- lobster pasta: very salty which made it difficult to enjoy.

I ordered: 
- BBQ chicken salad: drenched in ranch. Chicken should have been shredded thoroughly but came in huge chunks. Couldn't even eat half of it

Kids ordered:
- Mac and cheese and cheese pizza: both were devoured. Only problem was that it was supposed to come with a Popsicle of some sort but when I asked for the kids \"ice cream\" they gave us sundaes and charged us for it. I meant we were ready for our kids dessert that came with the meal but I guess I didn't clarify. 

Adult food: bust
Kids meals: great except for dessert issue.

Too bad because we frequent red rock often and get sick of food court food."}
{"text":"I kind of love this place.  It's a little pricey if you don't hit happy hour, but the food and drinks are consistent.  And I love beer.  I almost always end up eating appetizers here.  The Ahi Poke stack is yummy and so is the grilled artichoke.  The wings are mediocre and should be skipped.  Don't hold a candle to BWW. The truffle fries are delicious.  

Although it's a small patio, it's a nice patio.  And I find it pretty freaking awesome that in addition to the microbrews offered, you can find such stand bys as Pyramid Apricot Ale.  I don't care if I am a loser for ordering a Pyramid at YardHouse.  I did it, so there!"}
{"text":"This was the worse service I have ever received.  We were there for my dept luncheon during happy hour with seven other people.  Our waiter was not friendly and very rude.  I have no idea what his problem was...whether a bad day or trying to hurry since his shift ends at 5p.  He took our plates without asking if we were done, reached for the check when clearly we were not ready to leave.  It was as if he was rushing to kick us out of the restaurant when it wasn't even busy at the time.  To top it off, we saw him talking to the new waiter and POINTING at our table from a distance.  It was too obvious that he was talking about our table!  Talk about being rude!!!!

We have always love Yardhouse and have been going there for years.  Because of the poor and rude service we recd recently,  I am not sure if we will come back again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had dinner at Yard House.  I ordered Searred Ahi dinner for the first time and it was excellent!  I loved it!  When we do come here on previous occasions, I've always ordered the appetizers. I'm glad I tried something new."}
{"text":"Worst food and service I have ever had at the yard house. My BF and I went in for dinner after a soccer game and I ordered the vampire taco. After watching it die in the window for 10 min, I finally got a runner to bring it for us instead of our server Jonathan. They also brought the Mac and Cheese for my BF. The taco was rubbery and Mac and cheese was cold. When Jonathan finally returned to the table to ask how we were, we started to tell him and he just walked away. Worst experience in a restaurant in awhile."}
{"text":"We mistakenly  thought this was the prize restaurant from this season's Hells Kitchen. Oops. It's right next to The Highroller. There is seating outside upstairs but it was closed when we went.  The service was nice. Food was quick and decent.  They have a huge selection of beers, and you have the option to order flights/samples. We enjoyed the meal and experience."}
{"text":"So amazing 
Sat at the bar and had the team of Tiffany, Meredith and Brooke assist. Great dinner of chopped salad and soups- tomato bisque and chicken tortilla.

OMG
Fast and attentive service! Great menu!
Thanks, Mike for a great team!"}
{"text":"recently visited Yard house, and the food was fantastic. What I was upset about was we asked for seating inside,the hostess asked me twice i said inside.she than says ok 20 to 30 mins and handed me my beeper thing. it went off in 3 mins so me and my husband were like hell ya. well they take us outside. hot as shit with a screaming kid. we made tbe best of it to since we were out on a date. The 1 time a month we treat our selves as parents and we get stuck next to a child throwing tantrums and of  course parents not paying attention. i ask my husband if he wanted me to tell the waitress to move us. he said no. by then we have been sitting there for about 5 mins no lie to be greated. we order our drinks and food which thankfully came out quicker than anything.. the food was amazin. the experience not so well. Our waitress was Jennifer and she did not attend to our table at all.     being that is 111 degress out side and not atleast be given water or a \"hey i will be right with you\" and see other waiters and waitresses attend to their tables was sad to say the least. im just here to share my experience. food amazing service not so great.
the end"}
{"text":"I love coming to Yard House as they offer good service and good food. Prices have gone up some since I started coming to a Yard House, so normally have to stick to eating there during Lunch hour (11 am-5 pm) or during Happy Hours (3-6pm).

Location:
Located beside the AMC theater at Desert Ridge Marketplace, this location is very convenient for shoppers in the area to get to when they want something to eat. 

Service:
The couple of times that I've been to this location, I have had excellent customer service. The wait staff are very friendly and usually are very informative about the items on the menu. They are usually very prompt about bringing your drinks out and food is usually brought out in a very timely manner as well. 

Food:
I love the food here!! Been to several different Yard Houses and the food is very consistent. I usually get the same few items when I come here, as I know what I like. Items I have gotten are:

Truffle fries - $5.45
Spinach cheese dip with chips - $12.35
Chicken lettuce wrap - $11.95
Classic sliders - $11.95
Onion ring tower - $8.95
California roll - $12.45
Fried Calamari - $11.65
Wings - $11.95
Clam Chowder - $5.45
Kale Caesar salad - $7.45
Blackened White Fish Tacos - $5.25 each
Roasted Turkey Club - $12.45

I'm sure I've had something else, but I can't remember them. All of the items were delicious. Depending on what time of the day you go, some of the items are on the Lunch or Happy Hour menus and are cheaper. 

The only reason why I gave this place a 4 star, is because of their prices. They seem to be getting higher and higher for the same quality of food."}
{"text":"Like always the service is great but today the food wander so great the street taco is good but is not a street taco, no salsa, no lime and flour tortillas nooo for carnitas tacos is corn, the top sirloin was great the flavor but wasn't hot just warm the ribs with no flavor like use to be why? I don't know but today the kitchen don't do a good job, sorry"}
{"text":"I LOVE YARD HOUSE!!

=Location=
This location is right on the strip in The Linq Promenade. This is an ideal spot as so many people walk the strip looking for a good place to eat. This is easy to find and a good choice for those who don't want to empty their pockets to have a good meal. 

=Restaurant/Building=
One of my favorite thing about this location is that this spot is VERY large compared to others I've been to. This is a two story restaurant with even the porch having two levels. I love sitting on the upper level of the porch so I can look out and see the people and most of all the beautiful High Roller. 

=Staff/Customer Service=
As you enter, you're greeted by the host/hostess who will take you to your table. Depending on who you get and time of day, they can be real friendly with a smile on their face and ask how your day is and sometimes you get someone that doesn't even smile..just takes you to your table without a word. 

The wait staff has alway been friendly. They come quickly (most of the time) and take your drink order. Drinks usually come out quickly, but food orders are another story when it comes to this spot. Usually, they take your order as soon as they bring you your drinks, but I've been here where they're so busy that they come back 5-10 minutes after they bring your drinks to take your food order. If you come during Happy Hours, your wait can be long. 

No matter how busy this location gets, my waiter has always been so nice and made sure that they took good care of me and my guests. 

=Food=
Okay, so to be totally honest, I mainly come here for their Happy Hour deals. I just really hate coming to any restaurant, paying full price for something and then not being able to finish it. Yard House servings are more than enough for me and most times I have to take home food. 

Some of my favorite items here include, but not limited to..

-Onion Ring Tower $5 during Happy Hour
-Traditional Wings $6 during Happy Hour
-Fried Calamari $7 during Happy Hour
-California Roll $7 during Happy Hour
-Chicken Lettuce Wraps $7 during Happy Hour
-Classic Sliders $8 during Happy Hour
-Grilled Chicken & Avocado Sandwich $12.35
-Roasted Turkey Club $12.65 (my favorite sandwich here)
-Fish & Chips $16.25
-Clam Chowder $5.75 and up
-Kale Caesar salad $7.45
-Mixed Field Greens Salad $7.25

Food has always come out hot and fresh. Taste is always on point. No complaints there. 

Will come back again whenever I am back in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This Yard House was my first taste of a Yard House. Even though we came on a busy night and had to wait for around 25-30 minutes to be seated, the food and service more than out weighted the wait time. Since my first visit, I came often to this location during my two years that I lived in Vegas. It as a favorite spot to drop in for lunch, get a drink or two and was a nice spot to meet up with friends/family for dinner and to catch up. 

Service is usually quick and efficient, but depending on when you come, it can get super busy and you may have to wait some for your wait staff to come around to you. No matter how busy it's been, I've never had to wait for them to come around when I'm first seated, but again depending on when you come, drinks can still take some time to come out. I've even been here and have had to ask them about my drink. 

Like most Yard House restaurants that I've been to, the food here that I've had has always been so delicious. fresh and hot. Some of the items that I've tried on their menu are their Sliders, Turkey melt (one of my personal favorites), Onion ring tower, Fried Calamari, Truffle fries, Chicken lettuce wraps, wings, California roll, Pepperoni and mushroom pizza, 4 cheese pizza, Turkey club, and Fish Tacos just to name some. 

They have a great lunch menu which runs daily from 11 am to 5 pm and an equally good Happy Hour that runs Monday-Friday 3-6 pm and Late night Happy Hour Sunday-Wednesday 10 pm to close. 

Not a big beer drinker, but they have a great selection of beer for those that enjoy it as well as a menu of wine and mixed drinks. The mixed drinks that I've had are amazing. They didn't skimp on the alcohol which is a plus when paying the price you do. 

Overall my experiences here has been a pleasant one. I'd recommend this location to anyone."}
{"text":"Awesome street tacos
Korean pork belly wow
Many beers on tap
Been a foodie and beer enthusiast for years
Fast service crew and great bartenders 
Did I say great or awesome!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection, probably had 10 different pours in my week there and only one seemed a little old. They have a super diverse menu with lots of choices but pretty average quality. 

Bartenders clearly have a little beer knowledge and we're happy to talk shop. Happy hour food and drink deals were good and lots of sports on all the TV's. If you're a beer snob looking for good brews and ok food this is the spot."}
{"text":"What can I say.........It's a good place to get beer. If you go into your dinning experience knowing that it is a chain restaurant, then you won't be disappointed. Next time I'll just stick to the beer."}
{"text":"Amazing service at the bar from KYLE.  He recommended a great burger and onion rings.   Super speedy refills.   My 1st time at red rock I will Be back.  Came for the Justin Moore concert"}
{"text":"Had dinner last night the service was great and the food was mixed. Started with the Blue Crab cakes living on the east coast we are used to real crab cakes with lump crab meat and little filler. These were mostly filler with very little crab. The Penne with chicken was good nothing special. And the Roaster turkey pot pie was huge and very good."}
{"text":"So at first I wasn't going to write a review since yard house is always the best. No complaints & still no complaints.... Even though today they messed up our dessert order ... & then when we finally got the right one it just wasn't too tasty... The manager came by & asked how we are doing & if we are enjoying it I was honest & said no lol. He offered to get us something else & even take it off the bill ... Anyways moral of my review is .... Everyone messes up , especially on a busy day like this. We aren't robots ... I am a manager & I know how it gets dealing with people from time to time so I wasn't upset that the dessert was wrong, mistakes happen ! & I thought it was very nice how our server cared , as well as her manager ... They cared enough to check on us & if we are enjoying our food & dessert even with the high volume of people in here today... That is awesome customer service ! & I definitely love this yard house location more than the one at town square ! Still one of my top fave places to eat :)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I received a gift card for Christmas and decided to come to the Yard House last night for our three year anniversary. We were seated promptly at a table near the bar. After a couple minutes we were greeted by our server and we ordered two House IPAs and they were exactly as our server described: smooth and balanced. We ordered the Brussels and potato snack/app. They were really good and the sauce underneath was very rich. At this point, we were incredibly satisfied with everything. 

We had a hard time choosing our entrees so we again asked our server what he thought. He was very knowledgeable and recommended five to six dishes. My boyfriend ordered the jambalaya and I ordered the chicken penne. The entrees did not come with salad.

Upon receiving our food, we immediately see that the jambalaya is covered with fresh scallions, which was an ingredient not listed on the menu. Because of this, my boyfriend lost his appetite (he hates onion, scallions, leeks). He still tried to eat around them but noted that the rice was extremely underdone and edging on the point of crunchy. I agreed. Plus, it included four little shrimp, maybe six pieces of andouille sausage, and lacked Cajun heat. Suffice to say he didn't finish it. My chicken with penne included heated up chicken, sun-dried tomatoes, asparagus, and was just okay. The cooks left out the mushrooms, which was my biggest draw to the dish. I also found pieces of carrot in the pasta, which was not noted on the menu. 

Unfortunately, we waited about 10 minutes for our server to check on us. I informed him about the missing mushrooms and he offered to replace it there or pack me one to go. That was great but I didn't want to waste what I had so we agreed that a side of mushrooms would be fine. When I added them, they really elevated the dish. We didn't say anything about the jambalaya, which was probably a mistake. A manager also stopped by and offered a free dessert or a $5 gift card for our next visit. We weren't feeling dessert so she left the card. Upon paying, I abandoned the card on the table because I am sure we probably won't be back. 

So, for three beers, a snack, and two entrees, the total was $65. While the server and management reacted perfectly to the mushroom mistake, the food was just not good and we left disappointed on a very special night."}
{"text":"Bar tenders are cool but thats about it. Last 3 visits consisted of lazy service, bad food, horrible hosting. I found hair in my food unfortunately I won't be returning. Sadly I will miss their chicken pot pie and enchilada casserole  but the employees really don't help."}
{"text":"We celebrated my Dad's 72nd birthday tonight and we had an amazing experience as how true customer service should be like. 

When our dishes came we had 2 mistakes. First my dish was a pasta dish but was cold when I got it and only the plate was warm. Our other dish had noodles instead of rice as suggested by the waitress when first ordered. I got a new hot dish and kept the noodles.

Later towards the dinner, Alfredo came out and apologized for the mistake from the kitchen and  comp the 2 dishes. That's great customer service at its finest!! Thank you Alfredo"}
{"text":"I think I have been here 5-6 times since the place opened. 

*Friendly servers
*more beer choices than you can imagine
*fresh food
*great service
The Mac-n-cheese squared is off the charts... the Ginger encrusted salmon is excellent...the calamari is some of the best I have found in Phoenix.

Go there.. have a good time... enjoy the evening. you would be disappointed."}
{"text":"Good wine, good hamburger, good salad. Really worth it for a chain. We'll try other locations soon."}
{"text":"I'm sure the pub type food here is good but the shrimp and pasta dish i chose was blah. Shrimp was over cooked and rubbery. I hate the music that was playing. But the staff was attentive and not over bearing. I probably won't come back to eat again."}
{"text":"Disgusting cockroach that was a huge three inches was running around!! (See photo)
I rated the other Yard House at the Linq 5 stars. The food at this location was just as delicious, but what came down to the one star was the nasty huge bug at the end. 
We ordered our food as usual, but we came towards closing so they were starting to close the restaurant. The door says last call is around 1am, but our server took last call for us around 11:30pm. 
As we were finishing our meal, the restaurant turned the lights on brighter as they were closing. The huge cockroach then came out and was running around near our booth. 
All of the food was delicious but seeing an insect around where we are sitting made me feel truly disgusting. It was probably at our feet the whole time we were eating and we would have no idea because it is so dim. It makes me consider the cleanliness of not only this location, but the other Yard Houses. 
I told the manager and she just stepped on it and said \"thank you for telling me.\" She wasn't even surprised to see such a huge bug. They probably frequently have a cockroach problem and this was nothing new for her. 
Also, the only thing we drank was water. The first two cups I had tasted normal, but when they were basically closed and refilled it, it tasted off. The water had a nasty taste to it. This location (and maybe the others) was really dirty. Im disappointed to not be coming back even after the food and service was nice."}
{"text":"Great place for a talkative date. Lots of good seating all with access to the tvs. 
They did forget to add avocado to my boyfriends sandwich, and avocado was supposed to be one of the main ingredients. I think it was called chicken avocado club or something? We mentioned it to our server and she quickly brought some over on the side. 
It was delicious anyways."}
{"text":"We came here because it was open later than a lot of places and has a nice vegetarian section on the menu. The only thing is we arrived forty minutes before they closed and were treated as though we'd walked in at the very last minute. We were told we'd need to sit at the bar if we wanted to order food, and then the staff were all so busy prematurely breaking everything down to close up for the night that it took me forever to be able to ask someone to bring me silverware since my food was hastily set down in front of me without any silverware. It really kills the ambience when you're just wondering if you'll ever be able to get a fork or if you'll ever be able to order a drink despite that you're sitting at the bar all the while the manager is going around barking at everyone to get everything closed up. I've never been to a place that was so intent on having everything all pulled apart and cleaned up so the staff could leave at the same time as the diners, but the experience was rather unpleasant. I also got the sense that they must mostly deal with drunk jerks, because the attitude of the staff seemed relatively unfriendly and bizarrely condescending, apart from the one bartender guy who seemed to be trying. To be honest, based on my experience working in restaurants while I was in college, I got the impression that this place was hampered by poor management. That said, the service was similarly unfriendly at the Honolulu location so perhaps it's a corporate problem.

I still gave the place 3 stars because the Gardein menu is wonderful, and the food was generally quite good."}
{"text":"This restaurant was awesome... GREAT FOOD.  Excellent service (our server Was Tiffany.. SHE WAS THE BEST!!  We will absolutely visit them again!!"}
{"text":"Probably the best happy hour in town! They have a variety of appetizers and entrée for everyone to enjoy and a wide range of beer selection; pilsner, white ale, hefe, stouts, porters, IPA, etc. I enjoy their chicken strips with fries, crab cakes, burgers, pizza, and tortilla soup!"}
{"text":"I love the fact they have a diverse array of vegan options!"}
{"text":"Went here for a quick bite late at night and was delighted with the service and quality of food. My server Anthony was very knowledgeable of the beer selection and was not too pushy with upselling. Would return again."}
{"text":"If you like good beer this place is for you. 117 beers on tap at the time of my visit, all at 38 degrees! My friend and I came here the last few nights as we were staying at the Red Rock resort. We came near closing one night, and the staff was totally cool about it. They gave us excellent service as they meticulously cleaned in detail every square inch of the bar. It was as if Jon Taffer himself was overseeing their work. The food we had was also top notch. Excellent Korean beef. We had consistent courteous and attentive service from the entire staff, but our bartender Olivia really shined. Never let our glasses be empty before asking if we needed another.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First off... any place that has outdoor seating with heated seats and heated tables is a winner in my book! 
I started out with the Pineapple Express cocktail (which I loved so much I stopped by Total Wine to pick up the ingredients) and ordered the Baja fish tacos. I had never ordered a vampire style taco before so I ordered one regular and one vampire just to give it a try. My only regret is not ordering two vampire style tacos! For those that don't know, vampire style is where the melt cheese directly onto the skilled and then place the tortilla on top; the end result is a crunchy cheese coated bit of tortilla heaven! 
The service was great too! At one point the people at my table were in the middle of an exciting story and I noticed the server about to approach the table. The server turned around, waited a couple minutes for the story to be finished, and then came to ask how everything was. Total All-Star! 
Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Friday night was alright!
Went with our friend from out of town because of the famous over easy egg on a burger! We did have to wait 30 minutes on a Friday around 8pm, not bad since it was packed-at least they knew what they were doing getting it moving.
We sat outside since it was a nice night. We ordered the béarnaise burger (béarnaise sauce, fried onions) with garlic fries, the pastrami benedict burger (roasted tomatoes, fried onions, swiss, béarnaise sauce, fried egg) with onion rings and the kids chicken teriyaki with fries.
The béarnaise burger was ok nothing special and a little drying( bland and I wouldn't recommend )
The pastrami burger was really good but a mess to actually eat- my man lived it though and will be getting it again. Our son also loved the chicken and fries, his also came with a drink and a rice crispy treat at the end in cookies and cream. He loved it and for only $7 seemed like a great deal!
The waitress however was a nightmare, she didn't seem like she wanted to be there and was annoyed after every question I asked. Maybe she had a long day but I felt like I was bothering her.
Ps they also charge $1 extra for garlic fries which was a regret since there was soooo much onion in it, and for a $1 total scam! The onions rings were a dollar more too but very good, I'd pay $1 more again."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. One dish was burned, one dish was so salty it could not be eaten and one was too spicy - spice is okay except for when it totally distracts from the meal itself. I would never eat here again. Server was okay and tried to be attentive but just not a good experience."}
{"text":"All I have to say is they have great beer choices!!!! Service is horrible and food sucks!! Food was cold"}
{"text":"We went to the yard house on a Friday night. They were busy but we got in within 15 minutes. Our server was very pleasant and attentive. We ordered a variety of their happy hour appetizers. Calamari and the lettuce wraps were especially great! The craft beer selection of over 100 drafts is amazing! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I went to Yard House last week during their Happy Hour. They have a great happy hour selection. Sitting outside on the patio can be great, however our waitress wasn't super attentive. We asked when we got there what time the kitchen closed (11:30), but at 11:20 we had to go find her to order more food after our first round. Overall, I enjoy this location, just an off experience."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 10 stars! This place is absolutely amazing! We went here on our last day of a 4 day trip to Vegas for lunch since it was recommended by one of my friends who lives in LA and frequents there.  I checked out the menu and was immediately hooked since they had a whole section with Veggie Meat products!  We ended up getting the Spicy Thai Veggie Chicken Pizza (as Thai and Pizza lover - I have always wanted to try this!), side of fries, and garlic noodles.  My friend got the regular Spicy Thai Chicken Pizza.  We didn't order any beer but were highly tempted with their amazing vast collection.  The service was fast and friendly and the prices were reasonable with great serving portions.  We were stuffed with the delicious food! The only problem I see is that there isn't a Yard House near us in NJ!!!!!! If there was, I can guarantee I would be there on a twice weekly basis!"}
{"text":"Such a great place! I've never had anything here that wasn't delicious. Tonight I went with the BBQ chicken salad and it didn't disappoint. I will say that you're better off sitting in the outside patio because the restaurant is unreasonably loud! But overall, we love it!"}
{"text":"Yard House is a beer lovers/American food/slightly upscale kind-of-place. Above average for the chain, on the Strip in the LINQ across from the giant ferris wheel.

Zillion beers on tap means something for whatever your mood.  Big place, so they handled our group of six quickly.  Menu is extensive, American bistro.  Steaks, burgers, salads, pastas, something for everyone.  I did the Kale Caesar and the Mac & Cheese, both we quite good."}
{"text":"Though the food is okay and the selection of beer is diverse, the \"bar\" worker L***** never smiles, and when she talks to guests, she never looks the guests in the eyes. Let's be honest, she looks upset and seems to not even want to work there. She knows she can quit, right? It appears she dislikes what she does and just overall brings a harsh/unpersonall/sour tone to those she serves. She seriously never even looks at the guest when she talks, as if the guests are bothering her. I would not come to this yard house bar when she is working.


However, the hosts and other restaurant staff were very generous, courteous, and basically just did their job at making all guests feel welcome (appreciating business)"}
{"text":"We only ever come to this Yardhouse location for happy hour or drinks alone.

The food is good, no better than other locations. Service is good. Some of the waitresses weve had have been a little flakey, but it hasnt ruined the overall experience.

Like the other locations, they have a killer tap selection. I highky recommend asking what the samplers are for the day. On our most recent visit, my husband and I ordered our fave beer plus the \"traditional\" sampler. It consisted of:

Sam Adams Cherry Wheat
Sam Adams Winter Lager ( 2 of our absolute faves)
Stone Arrogant Bastard ( If you like IPAs, this is the beer for you)
Lost Coast Alley Cat Amber
Woodchuck Raspberry Hard Cider (dont let the name fool you, its not hard. It very, very light and kind of tastes like a raspberry Clearly Canadian)
Green Flash Brewing Treasure Chest

I never would have tried 3 of those beers w/ out ordering the sampler, so that was cool.

The best part of this location is the main entrance (off the parking lot). In order to get to the hostess stand you have to walk down a long hall thats flanked by the open kitchen and the keg room (w/ windows) on either side. First the delicious, melded food smells hit you, then youll try and see what keg is what thru the windows on the other side. I guantrantee, by the time you actually make it to the hostess stand youll either be starving or dying of thirst."}
{"text":"Yardhouse's  customer service is on point. They had messed up my order and the manager kindly went up to my table and apologized. The food was great as always! We started with the lobster artichoke dip. There were way too many chips and Pitts for a small dip size. The dip was tasty. We had the macaroni and cheese with gardein chicken with truffle sauce so yummy! My favorite! 

Our only disappointment was that my bf's burger didn't have a bearnaise sauce.  And on the menu it says Bernaise burger. It was just a reg burger he got. He was hungry so he just ate it. We didn't even tell our waiter."}
{"text":"Have gone to a Yard House in Florida and found that this one has less ambiance and worse service.  I had a small turkey Cobb salad, which was delicious.  We shared a chips and guacamole appetizer;  we have had this in many restaurants and never had such a small portion.  The taste was good, but not enough of a portion.  My husband had the Vegetarian tofu chicken stir fry, which was good.  Bar selections are adequate.  Overall, an average experience, which was a disappointment."}
{"text":"Great views from the rooftop deck area. Love their chocolate souffle desert."}
{"text":"This chain is doing it right.  Its a great place for a larger group and the variety of drinks is perfect.  The truffle mac and cheese is one of the best I have had.  Its very creamy and always consistent in great taste.  If you want to hit up a chain this is one to check out."}
{"text":"100+ beers on tap and fantastic food. The setting in Westgate and being able to sit outside enhanced the consumer experience. Prices were appropriate."}
{"text":"I came here with my husband and a few friends, just walking in to your left you can see kegs upon kegs of beer! It was beautiful! I really loved the atmosphere, low lights, with candles on the tables. Plenty of televisions around the restaurant with sports on. The alcohol menu was unbelievable with all the options of beer, anything you could possibly think of. One that caught my eye which i SADLY did not get to try was an actual Beer Float. MMmm sounds tasty! For dinner I ordered the turkey club, which was absolutely AHHHmazing! My husband ordered the barbecue bacon cheeseburger which he downed within a matter of seconds! The only downside is there is no military discount!! We will definitely be making a second or third or maybe even fourth trip there again! :)"}
{"text":"Chicken nachos are great! Carnitas tacos not so much, full of fat, huge pieces. Rice and beans for taco sides not good at all, skip them and the extra price!"}
{"text":"Went to The Yard House after a movie at the AMC theater next door.  It was a Friday, the restaurant was packed, but only a 15 minute wait for a table.  Three in the party, all had beer and food.  I always like the beer selection, and it is a wonderful selection.  I had a porter, another in the party a cider, and the last in the party, a black and tan.  Service was quick and efficient.  The waiter had a good knowledge of the beer menu.   I ordered the Parmesan encrusted chicken.  The meal consisted of two deep fried chicken breast stacked on a pile of mashed potatoes, in a bath of a sweet tasting mushroom sauce.

The dish was disgusting.  The chicken was dry.  I've had better tasting and cooked chicken breasts at Jack in the Box.  The potatoes in the meal were tasteless and mildly warm and the mushroom sauce turned my stomach.  One of the worst meals I have paid money to eat at a restaurant.  To be fair to the restaurant, my other party members enjoyed their meal, the waiter did notice my dislike of the meal I chose and offered a replacement meal.  Still, in my previous visits to the Yard House I have not yet to be wowed by a meal, or even close to have been wowed by a meal.  To me, the Yard House without the beer selection would struggle to compete with places like Denny's and Luby's."}
{"text":"A friend and I came in for lunch this afternoon and were greeted right away by our hot blue eyed server Brandon.   Without us having to ask Brandon brought us out ice water, which we appreciated so much because it was 1,000  degrees out on the patio. 
He was very knowledgeable about the menu and answered all the questions my friend had about the ounces and serving sizes. 
After not knowing what we wanted to order... Our server made some great recommendations about what appetizers would work great for us. He also helped us find something that would work well with our strict diets. 
Over all we had an amazing experience and will gladly be coming back ! I'll be requesting to sit in Brandon's section, Everytime ;)"}
{"text":"Our experience may have been affected by the fact that it was the final day of our trip and we were exhausted, but Yard House didn't inspire us. There's an incredibly large selection of draft beers, which takes center stage in the restaurant with comfortable booth seating circling around the exterior. While the copious number of tap handles was impressive, the food wasn't anything special. 

We ordered a few dishes from the House Favorites section of the menu, including the penne with chicken and the orange peel chicken. The pasta was smothered in a lukewarm mushroom cream sauce, lacking flavor or interest. The orange peel chicken was a better choice. Our server was friendly, but it took forever for us to get our food and later to get our check. The restaurant wasn't packed so I was surprised it took so long.

If you're a beer enthusiast, I'm sure you'd enjoy it, but I wouldn't go again just for the food."}
{"text":"The Staff is awesome, I just wish there was more of a \"scene\" here! I've been enjoying The YardHouse for over 20yrs now all over the country. It's great to know that I can go into any one of my favorite chain locations and get the EXACT level of awesome food and great service!!! Fellas.... great 1st date spot, Ladies, if you're unsure what to get on a date opt for the Ahi Crunchy Salad with a  9oz glass of your favorite white wine."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the environment at this place! Nice big bar with lots of TVs but also plenty of other seating as well. It was packed the day I went but I didn't have to wait to get a spot at the bar.

I ordered the BBQ Burger with fries and it was juicy and seriously delicious. This is a place I plan on going back to repeatedly and would highly suggest it if you don't mind a potential wait."}
{"text":"I eat the best salad I have had in my entire life... Bbq chicken salad. The portions are huge and that's because I got the small size. My hubby had a burger that he said is rated very high on his list. Our waitress was very friendly and quick . We will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place! Our 1st time at this place was a Saturday night so we did have a 40 minute wait for a table for 2 but that's expected. We got seated on the patio which was perfect for people watching. We had the lobster artichoke dip as an appetizer then I ate pizza and my husband had the lobster garlic noodles which were all super yummy. I also drank a salted watermelon Margarita which is the best margarita I've ever had. The service was incredible!"}
{"text":"Great drink menu! I could honestly go either way on the food. Way overpriced for the taste if you ask me lol! Love the mac and cheese though! But besides the mac and chee......stick with drinks! 6 pack sampler is nice if you like a variety and want to try something new."}
{"text":"Excellent service with great food. Highly recommend tomato bisque soup with any dish."}
{"text":"Meh. Service was ok, the beer wasnt super cold, and the food was just ok. I have had worse, but I have also had better from Yard House.

Note: Tons of beer on tap! If you like beer this is your place!"}
{"text":"Super fun place for large groups. 

They have a huge outdoor seating area that can accommodate lots of people as well as a game area. The patio area was hopping and despite the crowd the service was patient with our large group and very helpful. 

Massive beer selection, but the true seller for me was the fact that they had Modus Hoperandi on the beer list. I've never been able to find that beer anywhere except Colorado! Needless to say I indulged. 

They have a \"brown bag special\" on the beer menu for $2 and when you order it they don't tell you what beer you're getting. They bring it to you in a brown paper sack and leave you to find out what you got. I unfortunately received a Natty Light in my bag but I couldn't help but admire the idea of the special."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, delicious mac & cheese, yards of beer.. What move could anyone want?!"}
{"text":"This is my second time going to Yard House. First time was in Los Angeles & second time in Las Vegas. I came here with my family (big party). We were readily seated outdoors. It wasn't hot (Vegas weather) since there were mists to keep us cool. However, when they turned it off, the water kept dripping and splashing us.  We were irritated so we placed napkins on the area the water falls to prevent from splashing us. We informed our waiter about it and he said that it's been an ongoing problem and it's still in the process of being fixed.

Dj was our waiter for the night. He was very nice in the beginning. Yard House is known for their beers on tap. I wanted to try something new. I asked Dj for a recommendation. He served me 2 tasting beers. Unfortunately, I only remember one of them, Leffe Blond. When I asked Dj what it was again, he was unsure and couldn't remember the name. I was a little confused since he was the one who recommended the beers to me but yet he forgot the name of it.

Yard house is very pricey. Luckily, we were there during happy hour. I ordered the Pastrami Sliders ($7) with Sweet Potato Fries. The sweet potato fries were delicious! It took very long for the food the come out. Once the food came out, the sweet potato fries were hotter than the sliders. The sliders were very disappointing. I was expecting much from the sliders, but it only had pastrami and cheese. The sliders were also cold!

My sister also ordered dessert (Soufflé & Creme Brulee) togo. Everything was paid for already. Dj never came back to check on us to see if we received the dessert order. Instead, we had to ask one of the busboy to check on our to-go order. Keep in mind we were waiting for 30 minutes already & we ordered the dessert before we were done eating. The busboy followed up and said that they were packing the dessert. After another 20 minutes, we finally received our order from another waiter & not Dj. Dj never came back after we gave him the money. 

I was very disappointed with the waiting time and the service from our waiter. It felt like our waiter didn't want anything but the payment & his tip. His service was not consistent."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good food all around. I got to try a lot of things, including a blue crab cake hoagie with house ranch salad (lunch menu), chicken nachos, onion ring tower, fried calamari, and chicken strips w/ fries (disclaimer: didn't double-check the menu, so not all names of food items may be accurate). For some reason, out of all of those, I found myself munching on the fries and dipping them on the honey mustard that accompanied the chicken. I guess the fries were just in the sweet spot of crunchiness and fluffiness, and the honey mustard was way too addictive. I can't speak for the beer, but everybody at my table seemed to enjoy theirs and they have a huge selection. Finally,  gotta love a place that plays some Beatles and some George Harrison.

I also wanted to add a tip for finding this place. Gotta locate it before you can enjoy it, you know? It's kinda hidden if you're driving along most of the streets, so locate it on a map of Town Square beforehand or else just park somewhere and walk around. I think it might be best if you park near H&M and take the alley that starts off with the sushi bar and Yogurtland, then walk past the \"clearing\" in the middle. You should see it on the right."}
{"text":"So you wanna get a beer and not sure what to drink, well Yard house will satisfy...


This yard house has been one of the great successes at Red Rock casino, with a lot of places opening and closing within the casino this business should be around for a while.

The yard house has more beers than you can drink in 10 sittings from all over the states and the world. If the Cheesecake Factory is the queen of cheesecake well Yard house is the king of beers. (Sorry Budweiser)

The service is quite fast but with  weekends and nights a reservation is a must.

Food wise, the menu is extensive with great apps and a nicely portion sized entrees. I've never got to the deserts as I'm always full half way through my main.

Shepard's pie was the last meal I had which was a saint Patricks day special. It was a little overboard with the amount of sauce and the pastry was most of the plate which became a little much while eating.

Prices are a little high but the general quality of food is above regular pub foods."}
{"text":"Went here for me and my husband's anniversary. We were going to T-Bone's but I wanted more of a laid back atmosphere and had a craving for beer. I ordered their 21st anniversary beer and it was delicious! I can't remember the alcohol percentage but I ended up only ordering 1 but planned on getting 2 lol (I'm a lightweight/cheapdate) 

I ordered the Nashville Hot Chicken with sweet potato pancakes and shared truffle fries with hubby. The pancakes weren't very good. The chicken was to die for though!! He ordered the sandwich version. We were both so happy with our food, service and drinks. So much that I took my mother-in-law the following Wed. for lunch.

I expected the same quality in food and service. Our waitress Kristyn was pleasant and she looks like Mila Kuniz! I ordered Calamari to start and it came right away. It was freshly cooked however a tad overcooked. I still saved the rest to take home for my kiddos and Darlene was so sweet to wrap it up for me and say \"I appreciate you!\" That made my day. 

I loved my meal! I got the truffle cheeseburger and fries. yummmmy, unique and cooked perfectly. However, my mother-in-law barely ate her french dip roast beef sandwich because the meat was so tough. (She also has braces) We had to send it back. The manager Jen, came right away and she was so genuine and kind. She offered to replace a meal but we were pressed for time as we had a bingo game to get to lol. We did opt for a free Birthday mini-dessert. My MIL ordered the chocolate souffle and I ordered a Creme Brulee. The chocolate Souffle came out first and my MIL gave me a bite. It was more like a brownie than a souflee but it was still good. The Creme Brulee had a candle and they made a cocoa powder design that said \"Happy Birthday\" It was really pretty. Darlene even sang me a birthday song lol it was soooo cute! The Creme Brulee was more like a banana pudding with a chocolate crust. Not a fan. Regardless, I had a nice visit, and will come again because of the excellent service, food and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"There's pros and cons with this Yardhouse vs, Yardhouse in Townsquare (I've never been to the Yardhouse on the redrock side of town.)  Yardhouse at the Linq does not have a happy hour, I'm not sure if they have a reverse happy hour but didn't notice it on the menu.  The Pros: they have more beers on tap and the \"blackboard specials\" this is where we tried the Pugachev's cobra...man that was good stuff..strong, but good, one glass did the job.  Although there isn't any happy hour, there is plenty of seating, inside/outside/upstairs. This is listed as the world's largest Yardhouse.  I've been to this Yardhouse for dinner twice now, both on Friday nights and there was never a wait.  I've been to the Townsquare location and there has always been a wait.  Another con is the parking, of course I wouldn't recommend going to this Yardhouse unless you were already on the strip or planning to hang out at the Linq/Strip.  Having a group try to meet up on a Friday night on the strip was a hassle, I guess this would've been about the same if you were looking for parking at Townsquare also though.  Overall, I love Yardhouse! Great menu options for everyone, appetizers, small bites, vegan and vegetarian options available for all! *great for people watching and close to the High Roller"}
{"text":"yard house is like any other brewery with a bunch of beers available on tap, since i don't really drink beer I ordered the spanish peaks honey raspberry, and he ordered the house honey blonde which I liked better than mine, we also had the korean short ribs appetizer, lobster garlic noodles yum! and porcini crusted halibut yum too! Both entrees were really good...too bad i didn't save room for dessert**the server was very friendly and efficient, and another plus for the sizes of the booths and music choice (A-ha take on me)"}
{"text":"First time to this particular restaurant the food was decent the beer was good the service on the day we went was terrible. I've been to other yard House is how this has been the worst"}
{"text":"I finally decided to try this place and let me tell you it was awesome!! I had the truffle burger and the truffle fries and it was the best thing I have tarred in a long time. Even my sons pizza off the kids meal was amazing!! I will absolutely be back!! The service was great as well."}
{"text":"Courtney the hostess is rude. Came here today around 4 *understand there's a shift change* was seated at the first booth but wasn't comfortable there because it was right by the door. Asked our server if we could move but had the hostess do it?? They sat 3 other parties before moving us, she took us to a table right in the middle of the restaurant and wasn't comfortable with it when I asked for a booth she made a big deal about it..our server kind of slacked they weren't busy at all so I didn't understand why our service was so bad. Needless to say the host experience left a bad taste in my mouth that I don't think I would come back to this location...food was good though so I'll give it 2 stars"}
{"text":"Yard house always sounds great, but I can never say \"what a great choice\" or \"the food hit the spot\" to me it's more of a lets kill some time & hang out at yard house. Sad because every single time I visit it takes a long time for my food & drink..... Ugh even on dead nights!"}
{"text":"The food was good and came fast.
The Manu has a lot of things to choose from 
And the service was fast like it should be on every restaurant."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat and drink. Never had a bad experience and the food is really good! Nothing like a half yard of Dos Equis to go with a meal!"}
{"text":"This is still our favorite place to go after work. Consistent food. Friendly Staff. Although they seem to be busy every time we go, we always find a seat at the bar and have a great time.

Favorite Drink: Skinny Margarita & IPA
Favorite Food: Fried Chicken Strips with Fries and the Coconut Shrimp! Fabulous!"}
{"text":"The only saving grace to this review is the fact that I've dined at this location without AS MANY issues as we had last night.  

When I first moved here to Vegas, this was the first Yard House that I had ever been to and now I've been to many in a few different cities. I usually really enjoy Yard House because the food is good, there are so many different foods to choose from on the menu and they have my favorite 'Gin & Ginger' drink (that I modify to be completely different using Fireball..check out my 'Tips' for more on that).  Last night, however, was one huge disappointment after another in what I thought was an otherwise pretty consistently good corporate restaurant.

My friend decided to have his going away dinner here for all of the above reasons that I just mentioned but also because this boy LOVES beer.  I don't drink beer (gluten intolerance) and hence brings forth my first issue of the night.  I ordered a tequila and soda in a tall glass, with a splash of OJ and a lime, please.  My drink came in a short glass, with an orange slice and I'm not sure what the deal was but it tasted funk-ay. And this is my go-to drink, so I knew what to expect - and that wasn't it. 

It started out that there was only 5 of us and we were sitting in the first-come-first-serve bar area.  My friend made sure to call almost a week in advance and spoke personally to the manager.  He made a reservation for 25 people for 7PM.  When I got there at 7, there was no table for us - hence the bar seating.  The numbers continued to grow with most people being forced to stand behind other people who were seated and crowd around our table like it was a bar in itself.  Not ideal for us as guests and I KNOW not ideal for the servers who were working.  

The manager came over at one point to apologize, saying there was a 'mix up with the reservations' to which we assured him that we weren't high maintenance and totally willing to cooperate.  THEN he goes into 'actually, your party is really difficult for my servers because people are moving around so we're just going to have to group people together on checks and you guys can figure it out'. My friend, rightfully surprised, reassured the manager that we were easy going and he would cover anything left over at the end if checks got mixed up.

This was again,, where I started to get more irritated.  If everyone in the party had a SEAT, they wouldn't be moving around. Not to mention, most people didn't even have drinks because it was about a 20-30 minute wait between ordering something with a server and it actually showing up.  Trust me, this isn't an exaggeration. That one drink was my only drink of the night for this very reason. 

When it came time to order food, I had actually taken the time to research the gluten-free options online beforehand so I would know what to order.  As I'm ordering the 'Chopped Salad', I recite from the website that I can't have the 'Bloody Mary vinegarette' because it isn't gluten-free. The server doesn't believe me/isn't sure what I'm talking about so insists he will get me an actual gluten free menu. Fine. He takes everyone else's order and says he will return with the menu.

*cue Jeopardy music*

I didn't get a GF menu until right before the table's food was about to come out. 

I still ordered the chopped salad (without the dressing I knew I couldn't have anyways) and got it shortly after everyone else. And..it was gross. The worst part was the chopped celery - why you would put celery in that salad, I have no idea but it would have been so much better without that bitter crunch in every bite. I then had to stop eating halfway through because I had no water and there was no sign of a server in sight. Womp, womp, womp.

When the party was winding down, I was over it.  Myself and 2 other girls decided to ask for our checks, assuming that because we knew exactly what we had and were the only 3 who were ready, it wouldn't be 'too difficult' to split us off.  Nope. 25 minutes later I got my check..the same time everyone else wanted theirs too.

I'm not sure what happened last night but it was a huge disappointment. Yard House is great but I wouldn't recommend it for truly special occasions because I don't get the impression that they can deliver the kind of service those events deserve."}
{"text":"I seriously can't say enough good stuff about this Yardhouse location. I had never been to one prior to living in Las Vegas so this one will always hold a special spot in my heart! The service is always super friendly and because I have a knack for modifying their cocktails, the bartenders tend to remember who I am =) I highly recommend getting the \"Gin and Ginger\" but tell them to sub Fireball Cinnamon Whiskey for the gin..TRUST ME! Every person who tastes/straw tests it ends up falling in love! And you're welcome!!"}
{"text":"First time visiting Yard House and although there were a few hiccups overall I really enjoyed it. First off Steven our waiter was great. He was very knowledgeable and helpful with us in navigating the large menu. They have a ridiculous amount of beer on tap and I had two of Stevens suggestions that were fantastic. 
The food is where the experience lacked a bit. I ordered a steak salad as I wasn't too hungry my wife got the filet. Both were over cooked even though I ordered med rare and my wife medium. Both steaks were med well, but since we aren't too picky we ate them without complaint. They were OK. Honestly nothing special but good. 
The Desert trio soufflés were delicious and we left satisfied with our New Years eve dinner. We for sure will be back in the future."}
{"text":"This was our first visit and we came with a group of approximately 30 people.   The atmosphere is modern, with loads of beer on tap.  The restaurant is clean and open.  We were seated in the side room, which was perfect for our group.

Service was impeccable.   We had 5-6 servers and they were all amazing.  They went above and beyond, which is often difficult with a large party.

My husband and I both chose a beer with the help of our server.   Both were perfect!   Our server brought us a sample of another beer which was good too.   We were there during happy hour so prices were a little better.   We ordered the queso dip with the bacon chorizo and it was wonderful.   Cheese was hot and spicy and the flavors were great.  It was served with nacho chips and soft tortillas.   I was actually stuffed when we finished it.

I ordered the BBQ Bacon Cheddar Burger and my husband ordered the Pepper Jack Burger.   Both burgers were cooked as we requested and the flavors were good.   My only complaint was that my burger wasn't hot.  I am guessing it was because they did such a good job of having all the food ready at once for our group so that some of it sat waiting.   Not a fan of room temperature burgers.  

Overall, great experience, and would definitely return.  The menu is huge and the beer selection is great, so there is definitely a reason to return."}
{"text":"Being a woman in Las Vegas isn't always the best, but stopping here for a sour beer in order to write my work email was literally the nicest experience ever.  Frank is the epitome of his name: kind, welcoming, congratulatory, definitely convinced me the 2nd celebratory beverage was in order but not in a pushy way.  This is the kindest and chillest spot on the strip with a great selection of beers that the same kind Frank let me sample before choosing.  I'm a picky drinker and he led me via conversation and a few complimentary tastes to the beer I truly wanted.   This bar is lovely and Frank is a true and respectful gem of a guy.  We don't find many of them and I appreciated this so much after a long day of work !!"}
{"text":"We love the Happy Hour here!! Great place to watch the game!! We have the  best server... Jordyn! Chicken nachos were great and queso dip!! Allison is the best manager!!"}
{"text":"Been to the Red Rock location twice so far. Food and service have been very good both times. A little crowded and noisy but that comes with success.

Nice place for lunch or dinner and to take a date."}
{"text":"The menu is awesome! The beer menu is big. The staff is on top of things even though it's always busy. My favorite place in the area! Crispy Duck Wings! Ahi poke! Seriously a cool menu."}
{"text":"Good food, but long wait! We've been here for an hr before we got our food. It was delish though!"}
{"text":"6 PM dinner on Sunday, the food and service were good but the music was so loud it made any conversation almost impossible."}
{"text":"Good food and beer. NO BOXING OR UFC allowed on their tvs? That might be a game changer for me.... Dave and busters plays UFC...."}
{"text":"You're pretty much paying for the environment. The food isn't any better than most gastro pubs but the beer selection on the other hand is great. I'm not a big beer drinker all togther but if you are, it's a great place to try out."}
{"text":"Another LA transplant, I'm thrilled to find has moved to Vegas!  Shoreline Village was a bit far.  This place is your standard \"bar surrounding 100s of taps\" type of place.  Indoor and outdoor seating.  The food is decent.  It's not all stellar but there are some pretty stellar creations.  Their CA roll is a bit unorthodox, but definitely worth a try.  Their ahi sandwich is pretty phenomenal.  As is their Sea Bass.  Their pizzas aren't half bad either.  There are happy hour times with some level of discount.  Favorite beers for me:  Boddingtons (a must try), Guinness, any stout, and yeah that's pretty much it."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, but Hiclay really made the difference. From taking our order over the phone to how proactive she was ensuring our order was correct, she even separated the cold items and hot items and knew where each item was in the bag. You always know you've picked the right restaurant when the staff that works there is as friendly and happy as she was. New favorite spot!"}
{"text":"Amazing  Brussels sprouts. The chopped salad I enjoyed add lettuce it's extra special. My husband had the fish and chips and they were great as well."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had called Yardhouse to find out their happy hour, and the hostess told us 6-9, so we decided to dine here. 

Unfortunately, upon sitting down, I saw their happy hour was a completely different time frame, so we asked our server, Jordyn, about their happy hour. We told her that when we called, we got a different answer, and she said she would ask management if maybe they had another special going on. In the quick five minutes, not only did she find out what happened (the hostess was new and wasn't clear on times) but she spoke to her manager about the miscommunication and was able to get us happy hour priced appetizers. That showed that she truly cared about the service she gave to her customers AND was able to fix it! In such a quick manner as well!

 My boyfriend and I were originally debating on staying because we were a little upset, but this definitely displayed great customer service and I knew that Jordyn will surely take care of us. We ended up ordering poke nachos, calamari, the carnivore pizza, and 2 tacos (kbbq and a fish taco). The food was delicious as always! Yardhouse is always my favorite chain restaurant. 
We also ordered 2 micheladas each. After the first round, Jordyn said another bartender just clocked in that makes amazing micheladas and ensured she would make ours. She was very attentive and very clearly catered to us! 

When it was time to pay out our check, not only did Jordyn remember our discounted appetizers, but she was able to comp them completely off! My boyfriend and I have both worked in the service industry, and so we are both very critical when it comes to customer service, but she was amazing from the time we sat down to the time we paid out our check. 

If we could have her be our server every time, we definitely would!!"}
{"text":"our server rebeka was horrible she waited on the table behind us so many times and was so happy when she came to our table her smile was gone and seemed like we wore bothering her she never stopped to ask us  if we needed anything but went to the table behind us many times ... lets me say my friend and i are black and the table behind us was a group of white people ...she only came less we called for her and then she was lazy and wouldn't split our bill told us to tell her how much needed to be on one card rolled her eyes and walked away and only filled my water one time the entire time during dinner .. horrible service   told the manager and he was great he took care of our bill the food was good but the experience was not worth the 50 dollers ."}
{"text":"Or my first time at the Years house and not my first time at this location, but the menus has changed a bit. Host staff was great and the server was very nice and helpful. 

I didn't give a full 5 stars for the reason that they got rid of a large variety of drinks. I started off asking if they had Ciroc vodka and they didn't, which is understandable as not many bars have t. But when I asked for shiner bock, fat tire, Murphy's stout and for each beer I asked I got s \"NO, we don't have it\", that kind of was disappointing. 

I ordered the fish and chips with sweet potatoes fries and it was as always delicious. Will definitely come back for the food."}
{"text":"I'm so sad to write this review because I LOVE the yard house. I come here because the penne with chicken is my favorite pasta around. But I'm so irritated because as a group of five celebrating a birthday you would think that we would have some sort of attention paid to us. Our server Megan was the exact opposite of attentive. Actually she had the audacity to stand by the well multiple times and look at us as we were clearly looking for somebody to help us. One plate of food was sent back, extra side of sauce was asked for and waters were constantly empty. The only time we were happy was when the manager came by to give us the new plate of food that was sent back, check up on us, bring by the right sauce (after our server brought out the wrong one) and refill our waters. Even after the manager stopped by and did our servers job, our server still didn't pay attention to us. We waited and waited for her to come by so we could just pay and leave because we were just over it. And I know it will come as a shock when I tell you it only took her two seconds to grab the checks off the table (A+ on attentiveness there). I'm not sure if she was just a bad server which I doubt because her shirt said \"training team\" (hope she's not training anybody with the job she did) or she just assumed a group of five 20 year olds wouldn't tip her so she didn't even bother. Either way it was ridiculous and as a server I can't imagine treating any table like that and I'm pissed I even tipped her 15%. I will not be coming back to this yard house, that's for sure."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, absolutely no complaint there.  But here is how my rating went down:

     When my friends and I arrived, they were not busy.  It was really nice, tables clean, etc.  I'm pretty sure we had 2 waitresses but they looked pretty similar so it's hard to tell.  One of their names was Magdalene (according to the receipt).  As far as keeping our drinks filled they did great, which we needed because......it was an hour before we saw our entrees (and this is being generous.)

     Once we noticed, without a doubt, that people who arrived after us were receiving their food before us, my friend asked about our orders.  Our waitress replied that \"it should only be another 3 to 5 minutes,\" but she would go check.  (How she would know 3-5 minutes before she went to look is beyond me, but I digress.)  She comes back and says they're plating it now, it will be out soon. Our  food did come at this point, and like I said, we all loved our food.  

     The waitress brought our check without us having to ask for it - that was good.  There were 4 of us, and we were all paying for our own meal, so it was split payment between cash and credit.  There was more than enough to cover the bill, because like I said, we were each paying our own meal.  I told her to charge my card first and for how much, and to use the cash after.  She walks away and we see her go to the computer for a while, then she disappears for another 5 minutes (again, generous).  When she returns, I open the folder and the only thing in there is my card and the slip for me to sign.  I'm clearly puzzled, because I knew we had change coming back.  She probably notices because she says...... wait for it......

\"You guys didn't want change did you?\"

     Ex-cah-use me?   She seriously tipped herself.  I've heard of (and experienced) automatically billed tips for large parties, but a) we were a party of four, b) this was not on the bill, and c) none of us have ever had a waiter or waitress just keep the change unless we said to.  Is this what gets done to tourist?   

     She starts to walk away before any of us even reply, so I say \"Hold on.\"  My friend asks her how much change there was and she says \"Oh I'm not sure let me look\"  What?  Yes, you are sure - or maybe this is something you do all the time so it's hard for you to keep track.  

     Just so you know Magdalene, since apparently you are not aware, it is up to the patron to decide how much and IF they tip you, not for you to decide based on how you think you did.  We would have tipped you, but based on principle - you do not make the choice to keep someone's money and ask questions later.  What you did was extremely rude.  We probably would have tipped you even more than you took,  so thanks for taking it upon yourself to reward yourself.  It saved us some money."}
{"text":"We enjoyed this restaurant. The pear bear was fun to try and the Brussels sprouts are amazing.  Pricey beers.  The calamari is typical and good.  Worth trying and the beer selection is amazing. The service is excellent and the bartender gave us samples to find the beer we liked.  Parking in the parking lot behind is the best and closest place to park."}
{"text":"Had dinner with some friends on Sunday night and both the drinks and food were top notch. They are not kidding when they say they have a lot of beers on tap - but the beer menu is very well organized and has some really cool and interesting stuff. The food menu is likewise expansive, but we all found something that we liked. Very solid choice in Westgate, especially if you have a group"}
{"text":"This place isn't bad. Or great. It's okay, nothing I would or would not expect from a hip place just off the strip. Food is average. Atmosphere is okay. Service was friendly. I really liked our waitress. Prices are reasonable. You won't be disappointed if you come here but you probably won't be wowed either."}
{"text":"We really enjoy Yard House.  My husband is a beer addict and always wants to try something new.  With over 100 beers on the menu, he is still working his way through the list.  Luckily he is 6'4\" and can hold his alcohol, otherwise I would have to carry him all the way out to the car regularly.  Needless to say, he goes for the beer and I go for the burgers!  The pepper crusted burger is lovely and the Hollandaise burger is delightful.  I have also tried their version of Mac n' Cheese and I had dreams about it that evening, no joke!"}
{"text":"Helpful and accommodating staff, decent food, HUGE place.  
I really like that they have an outdoor patio to enjoy a cold beer on a hot summer night."}
{"text":"I was in town for a conference and dined here a few evenings.  Very good cocktails and happy hour apps.  Good value and the quality and freshness of the food was phenomenal.  When I am presented with another opportunity to travel to Westlake OH I will definitedly be returning."}
{"text":"So many beers so little tolerance. Yard House has a phenominal number of beers to sample on any given night including some local brews as from Sin City Brewery (my fav 7 years running) and Tenaya Creek. I ordered an Anderson Valley Boont Amber from NorCal before I saw the Sin City beers. No worries though. The hops in this California style amber went well with my dinner. I ordered a black truffle chesse burger. Freshly grilled and topped with gooey truffle cheese and onion bacon jam, this burger was some rich pub fare. The bitter hop notes of the beer cut through that richness. My only complaint was the size of the burger. I think I can get a bigger burger at Carl's Jr but it wouldn't taste so good. Luckily there were enough fries to make up the difference. Lovely little shoestrings that took to ketchup real well. 

Other fare ordered on this particular night were average fish and chips with the unique jalapeno tartar sauce and garlic aioli, a roast beef sandwich and jambalaya with pasta in place of rice. I tried the fish and a bite of sausage from the jambalaya. My favorite part of any of it was the garlic aioli for the fish but that stuff would be good on just about anything.

It was very loud in Yard House.  The music was loud which is fine by me especially given the classic rock sounds they were pumping out but it was difficult to hear my family over the sound of music. Not to mention the place was packed so we were talking over the couple hundred other people in there too. Despite the noise, the food was good and service was adequate. I will be back."}
{"text":"Great happy hour! Food was great, vampire tacos are a must have. Good beer list (huge.. hard to choose sometimes), great app prices. Pizza was good, too. Definitely a fun spot for a casual happy hour."}
{"text":"Although I've been here a couple times, I realized I've never written a review. 
The food at each Yard House is consistent. The atmosphere is the same, noisy and lively. There is a full bar and lots of beers on tap. Appetizers are delish, as is most of the food we've ordered. 
The service this time at Red Rock Yard House was less than stellar. Our waitress was a sweetheart, but repeatedly forgot our kids menus, forgot the ketchup for the fries, forgot my salad (everyone was done when I finally saw her to tell her), our bill took forever to finally come. 
Luckily, their food is pretty good, so we'll probably go back."}
{"text":"This was our first time at the Linq Yard House, although we have eaten at 2 other YH locations a few times. 
The Linq's Yard House did not disappoint. Service, food quality, ambiance, all first rate. 
We arrived on Saturday around 7:00 with 9 total people, and while it was packed, it took less than 30 minutes to get 2 tables. Two tables? Six of our party of nine were teen girls celebrating my daughter's bday and they wanted their own table. I get it, that's cool. Yard House was great at accommodating 2 separate tables, ours was across the restaurant and yet the servers were cool about taking care of both tables and giving my hubby the bill. 
Total bill for 9 people, minus tip, $160, not too bad! The food was great and service was awesome!"}
{"text":"The Yard House is always a go to restaurant when we have a bigger group, simply because they have a huge menu with a wide variety of choices. The apps are always tasty, my hubby loves the chicken wings and lettuce wraps, the onion ring tower does not disappoint either, if you know what I mean. The chicken nachos are big enough to definitely share with a few people, and the shushimi is very good, as well. We've tried the burgers ( I like the turkey burger a lot), the street tacos are excellent, pasta dishes look good (although I haven't tried any yet) and the pan seared ahi and ginger salmon are tasty. There's a good kids menu, lots of beers to play around with, full bar. Service has always been excellent and the atmosphere can be loud, but it's casual, too. We have eaten inside, but prefer outside. 
It's moderately priced for that type of restaurant, typically for our family of 4 the bill is $80-100, that's dinners with a beer or a cocktail."}
{"text":"This review is towards my take-out experience with this establishment.  I'm sure this is a great place to dine-in as there's a lot of people.  I'm a fairly new delivery driver and this place doesn't have it together.  I accepted the pick-up delivery at 8:08pm that's when customer ordered the food on a Monday night.  I get there at 8:22pm as I was fairly far, hit \"Arrived\" to let them know I'm here.  I checked in at the counter to show the order I'm picking up to this lady and she said \"It'll be a moment\"  Waited a good 15 minutes and it was getting crowded so I waited outside.  Now normally when the order is ready to be picked up, I'll get a notification.  I didn't get notice.  Waited for another 10 minutes and I go back inside to see if it's ready.  Nothing.  So the lady finally ask which order I'm waiting for...  I'm thinking to myself \"are you kidding me??\"   They should know exactly which order is it.. it's not like there's 3 other delivery drivers waiting...    I'm the only one there...  So turns out the order was partially ready and was just sitting there.  I'm like \"what's missing?\"  two drinks but she needs to get an \"To-go specialist\" to get these drinks for me.  And this \"specialist\" was no where in sight...   I'm like freaking great...  waited another 5-10 minutes for her to show up... then she takes another 5-10 minutes to pour two drinks.  I'm thinking \"is this really happening?\"  It's obvious they're short staffed, and the staff doesn't know what to do with delivery orders....   I finally got everything at 9:05pm...  takes almost an hour... what a joke.  

Avoid take-out from this place...   and just let your driver do the waiting for you."}
{"text":"I love it here! My boyfriend and I always get the surf and turf burger! So juicy and tender. I love love love their fries. It's just the right amount of crispy! However, the service is not consistent. We get good servers to terrible servers that only checks up on us twice. To get the order and the second time to bring our order."}
{"text":"Has and will always be my favorite yard house. All the employees here really get to know you and also greet you and make great conversation, especially if you're a regular. Yard House at town square has the best customer service of any restaurant I have ever been to. It's never taken more than 15 minutes for my food to come out, and the waiters always stop by your table to check on you. I wouldn't bring kids here really considering it is a barstaraunt. My favorite place to go weekends or weekdays, always great prices. I recommend any of their sandwiches or burgers with truffle fries or sweet fries !!"}
{"text":"The service here was amazing. If you get Casey or Olivia B you will have the best service and great source of information regarding all drinks. Thank you"}
{"text":"We love this place (and also the one in Town Square).  We come exclusively for the Happy Hour and have never been disappointed.

The beer selection is huge and always fresh.  We like the darker malty beers and lately for us it's been all about trying their Belgian Trappist styles.  Their own one is fantastic, and so are all the others we've tried so far (try saying that, or anything, after two 10% alcohol content goblets).

HH food is great.  We've tried quite a few things, our favorites are the Thai pizza, the lettuce wraps, and the Bearnaise sliders.  HH prices for beer and food are great, and service has nearly always been top notch.  On our last trip we were lucky enough to have Areannia (not sure about the spelling, but the 'i' is silent, hey I don't make this stuff up).  The most patient, sweetest, nicest, most helpful waitress you'll ever meet.

Great place to hang out with friends, I wish we had a Yard House where we live."}
{"text":"Amazing food as always.  Great beer list and mixed drink options.  Sat out on the patio, had a great view of the high roller.  The only disappointment was our table umbrella was broken. Wait staff was great!"}
{"text":"Service was not very good.
Food was ok...beer was excellent , though it took forever to get to the table.
It wasn't very busy at all & we had to wait 15 minutes just to get water & then another 15 after that just to order. Food took about a 1/2 hour to come to the table. From the time we sat (party of 2) till the time we paid our bill & left took 90 minutes. I gave 3 stars because of the Weihenstephaner...which was superb & the food (Turkey avocado club) was pretty good, even though it was brought out on the wrong bread."}
{"text":"I used to love this place when it first opened in 2009, but the last few times I have gone in 2013 the food has taken a turn for the worst.  The food is smaller and not cooked correctly.  The beer selection is still very amazing but the food used to be the reason to go, now it's not worth it unless you already happen to be in town square."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best onion rings on the planet hands down.... garlic fries were okay they didn't do it right ...they just threw chopped garlic on the top LOL... the burgers were pretty good we got them medium rare they were juicy the Buns were excellent pretty gosh dang good food."}
{"text":"Excellent service, great food, and loved the music!!! I highly recommend this place if you're looking to avoid the super fancy/expensive restaurants."}
{"text":"Happy hour menu has generous portions. So many beers you will be staring at the menu for a while. Pizza has lots of garlic smell, hidden taste, sliders are excellent . Cool atmosphere . I will come back"}
{"text":"If you've been to 1 Yard House you've been to them all. 

It's a restaurant bar type joint with extremely loud music and it's great! This is my first time coming to this particular YH and I probably liked it more than all the others in town.

Our server was very attentive and super duper friendly. When a few things didn't come out right he made sure to correct the mistake quickly and apologized.

Overall everything tasted great and the service was good. I like coming to these kind of joints, because you can hang out with friends, drink a couple of beers and kick back for as long as you want.

No one is ever rushing you and the ambience is always kickin'! The Yard House rocks and I can't wait to make my way back here again.

Thanks YH!!!"}
{"text":"Great selection for vegans. Knowledgeable & friendly staff. Full section of Gardein options. Delicious food for EVERYONE!"}
{"text":"I usually don't wright these but after my experience here last night I felt it necessary. My husband wanted The Yard House for his birthday dinner so we came with a party of 12. I had tried to call in advance and make reservations but they had already been booked so the host recommended to me over the phone that I should show up 30-40 min early myself so that by the time my party got there I would already have our spot and they all wouldn't have to wait. This is exactly what I did. However, the wait was much longer than expected. Apparently the table that they wanted to sit our larger party had one table in the middle of guests who just were not leaving which was making it impossible for them to have our table ready. I ended up waiting way longer than I was told and as our guests arrived they waited too. The manager working at the time (I'm upset I didn't get his name because he deserves some recognition) was so caring and apologetic and I could tell he wasn't just saying things because he had to but because he really wanted to help us out. He explained the table situation and thanked us for our patience and asked if we wanted to continue waiting, I told him we would wait longer. What I appreciated most was he then went out of his way to say \"well let me do something for you guys because I appreciate your patience\" and he bought our whole party a round of drinks from the bar while we waited! I thought this was amazing customer service given nobody from our party had complained or been upset with him yet he still felt it necessary to go out of his way and do something nice for us. I thought that was AWESOME! After getting our drinks we only waited about 5 more minutes and were then seated. Once being seated the service was also awesome! Everybody is so friendly and on top of thing. I never had to ask to have my drink refilled , never had to remind them when we asked for something which was impressive when you have a large party like we did. The food was amazing and the menu offers such a selection of different types of foods it has something for whatever you're in the mood for. 
Besides waiting so long (which was a big part my fault I shouldve tried to book reservations sooner) this place was awesome and I feel like they went above and beyond to keep my party happy. Will definitley be returning!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was very dark but laid back. The server had tables on both sides of the restaurant so we didn't see him much. My bf ordered something that takes longer to make than usual but nobody told us till after we had been waiting a while for our food. I love that they have a vegetarian menu, but the gardien chicken sandwich was very dry."}
{"text":"Great place as always. The girls at the bar did a great job (especially Alana).  Super friendly, quick, know their beer.  Also impressed with the management, they were around, helping out the staff and guests.  They changed the TV for us in 2 minutes.  Great atmosphere, love it.

Jambalaya excellent as always.  Poke nachos on happy hour, best snack and deal in the house.  New lumpia was so so, slightly biased because I was raised around real handmade lumpia, but not bad snack on happy hour menu."}
{"text":"We ate at Yard House this afternoon to celebrate our 15th wedding anniversary. Based on the reviews here on yelp I expected it to be a great experience. HUGE MISTAKE. First off \" Katie\" tried sitting us in a booth that had food crumbs and something shiny on the table and the seats. Then she sat us by the waitress/cashier area...I kept smelling something...it smelled like rancid garbage. Apparently one of the waitresses smelled it too because she sprayed bleach right behind me. Not sure which smell was worse right before dinner. Our waitress, Dee, brought us the onion ring tower...an old fashioned for my husband and a salted watermelon margarita for me. The onion rings were OK, nothing special. My husband liked his drink, mine however was horrible. I wasn't familiar with el jimador tequila but the rest of the ingredients looked great/fresh so I ordered it. Seriously it tasted like Cuervo...extremely harsh/nasty. Up to this point it's all small stuff that I can overlook but.....For Dinner my husband ordered the shrimp & calamari diablo and I ordered the lobster garlic noodles. My husbands dish looked really bad/awful presentation, but he said it tasted OK. Mine looked great but tasted bad. The pasta was dried out as if it wasn't fresh and the whole dish had a rich taste to it that ruined the seafood. I took 2 bites and was done. In all fairness our waitress, Dee, tried more than once to make the drink order right but my husband didn't want to waste it so he chocked it down. I didn't complain about the food...I suspect if I had that Dee would have taken it back. But for the money this dinner cost I shouldn't have to complain and Dee shouldn't have to work so hard to make it up to customers. Dee was a sweet girl and gave excellent customer service...she was the only positive thing about this place. Oh, and we did notice that the girl behind us left with most of her food still on the plate. We boxed ours up...my husband didn't want to waste food so he will try and eat it later but I suspect most of it will end up in the trash anyway. Very disappointing/expensive afternoon."}
{"text":"Great fun place to grab one of the many beers on tap. Nice selection of beer.

Food was pretty good and atmosphere was nice. Some nice outdoor seating with TV's to watch sports.

I went there a couple times while at the resort. It was my favorite casual bar to have good food, watch a game and try some new beers."}
{"text":"Can't speak on behalf of the other locations but this one rocks. It's always busy & you can never go wrong with their happy hour. They have lots of options to choose from. Of course they have a huge beer list, but even their cocktails are good"}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch after a long drive from Los Angeles.  Started with some Belgium Quads.  I ordered the lunch special, clam chowder and beef dip and my wife got the ceasar salad and pepperoni pizza.  Clam chowder was very good as was the ceasar salad.  The beef dip was a bit salty, and the pepperoni pizza was pretty average.  Beer was outstanding, which helped push the extra star rating."}
{"text":"Our last night in Vegas, and we decided to not venture out of the hotel looking for dinner. We decided to go to Yardbirds.  What a great decision we made. My husband and I split the wedge salad, fried chicken with their homemade buttermilk biscuits with honey butter/strawberry jam.  I just have to say it was probably the best fried chicken I have ever had in my life. The coating and flavor was so dang good!!! It's makes Ng me drool just thinking about it.

My cousins had the ribs and the bourbon ham on buttermilk biscuits.  You could see the ribs were moist and easy to get off the bone, and the homemade BBQ sauce.

His friend Dean had the fried green tomatoes with a good cut of bacon on top, and omg they were so yummy!!!  

I wanted the deviled eggs, but just couldn't order them as we had been eating so much these past few days.  No dessert for us either, but I would definitely try the peach cobbler next time."}
{"text":"As much as I hate to do this I am making it aware of what happened during me and my husbands last lunch we had here. On Wednesday February 1st my husband and I went to Yardhouse for a quick lunch. Our server was Kristyn. All was well with everything until the transaction went through on the credit card and it showed she added an extra dollar to her tip. My husband put a tip down of $3.45 our meal came to $21.00. He normally gives 20% but she never asked to see his ID on his credit card that on the back says \"check ID\" so his rule is thats a big deal to no check ID on a credit card that says check ID so he took a dollar off the tip. Well he sees on his bank statement that instead of $3.45 the charge is $4.45. 
Not sure why a server would ADD money to a guests bill when thats not what was on there. The extra dollar isnt the issue the fact of the matter is thats unethical. That is wrong. Just dont want it happening to other people thats all."}
{"text":"Only been to this location of the Yard House and for Happy Hour. 

Happy Hour is so delish! The drinks are okay. The appetizers are huge portions! 

Great to hang out with friends. With tvs everywhere for sports watching. 

Hit and miss with staff...I hope they would be more consistent in paying attention to seating customers. They forget they have to \"earn\" their tip. 

But the four stars is for the overall experience."}
{"text":"We do Yardhouse every other month it seems!  Alternated with Bj's across the street! :) 

This place is great . . . almost always comes with a wait though, probably because it's in the Red Rock Casino and there aren't many choices for this type of venue.  They have great patio ~ we love sitting out when the weather is nice, having a beer (hundreds on tap literally) and watching a game on TV.  

The menu is enormous and the food is good!  I don't think I've ever been disappointed here, ever.  And there's something for everyone.  My favorites are the seared tuna, turkey burger (I have one everywhere I go it seems), grilled cheese n tomato soup and their wings rock too!  Hubby loves the ridiculously large chicken pot pie!  

Happy Hour here is so worth it unlike other places - it's M-F 3-6 (there's also a late night happy hour too) and includes many of their appetizers and drink specials too.  It's a good one -- lots to choose from and not just the typical bar fare.  

Service is hit and miss - they are usually very busy so it varies.  I've had great luck at happy hour and on the patio.  We've even been able to order for last call so when it nears 6, she lines up our beers just before the buzzer!  Everyone seems nice, but sometimes you wait awhile for your visit and I am big on service. :)  So worth it -- go ahead and stop in!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, quick service, and delicious food. Got the pepper jack burger cooked medium and came out perfect. Everything is well seasoned. Christine was our server and she was great. Huge selection of regional beers. Spacious booths and misters outside go the hot summer days."}
{"text":"I Love Yard House for the purpose that they have meat free options. Also they have great happy hours which include deals on food and drinks. They are conveniently located in red rock casino but you can get to a entrance from outside. They do not take reservations for two people, but you can call and get on the waitlist. My server was not friendly, and never once smiled. 

There was no wait so we sat down right away, we were there for the late-night Sunday happy hour (10pm-close)

I can't believe the outdoor patio is open with how cold it is outside, but they have heat lamps and people seemed comfortable.  Me on the other hand, I was freezing my butt off with my jacket on inside ha ha


One thing I do not like about Yard House is that every time I try to add on a salad they say I must either have ranch or Cesar and I tell them I am dairy free and they say there is nothing they can do about it.  I am sure you can whip up some oil and vinegar somewhere no?"}
{"text":"I've been to other Yard House locations in addition to this one, and I honestly wish there was a location of this chain in my hometown of St. Louis. Their menu has a such wide variety... there is surely something for everyone. Another thing I've noticed about Yard House is that the restaurants themselves are enormous, so there is never a long wait time. This particular spot is very nice and new, located in the Linq area of the strip.

My husband and I came for lunch on our recent visit to Las Vegas. Though there are plenty of lunch specials to choose from, we each chose items off the regular menu instead. I had a large serving of the chicken and bacon mac & cheese and my hubby got a bbq chicken pizza. My pasta was delicious... plenty of chicken, bacon, and mushrooms mixed into the creamy and cheesy spiral macaroni noodles. My husband stated that his pizza had a great flavor and the perfect amount of sauce. 

We had a $45 gift card, and after tax and tip, we used the entire balance plus gave another $2. This may sound a bit expensive for two lunches with iced tea, but had we ordered the lunch specials it would have been much less. I think this is a fair price to pay if we actually had our same meal at dinner time. 

I will definitely return to Yard House whether it be in Vegas or another city... until St. Louis finally gets on board. (hint, hint)"}
{"text":"I have gone to all 3 Yard House in Phoenix AZ and this one is by far the best one for me, great service and Happy Hour is the BEST it goes on from 3pm-6pm or 10pm- to closing. Great for family and friends to enjoy some delicious appetizers."}
{"text":"Maybe it was the location that didn't allow me to enjoy the restaurant as much but I would go again and eat the appetizers."}
{"text":"Finally after months of trying we were able to get in and get seated without being told there is a 1 hour wait.  Oh the excitement. 

Not so exciting is the placement of the doors.  If you are entering from the casino, the host person still has you schlep across the entire restaurant to the other host person.  We have technology people..use it.  

So we get seated and surprisingly it was pretty empty for a Saturday afternoon. In fact there were only 2 tables occupied in our section so imagine our surprise when it took more than 15 minutes just to have someone come take our drink order.  

We ordered appetizers and then our lunch.  We got the Korean BBQ beef & the firecracker wings.  I have to say the Korean BBQ was delicious with the jasmine rice as an accompaniment.  

The firecracker wings? not so much.  In fact we sent them back. They were not even close to spicy as the description said but rather just covered in a gooey tasteless sauce.  I should have gone with my gut and ordered the jerk wings instead.  

For our lunch, we had the Mac + cheese 2, which was ok considering the huge chunks of bacon that came with it.  I think it might have been better without the truffle oil since the combo of mushrooms & bacon overwhelm the flavor already but geeze it's only mac & cheese x2.  

I had the tomato bisque and grilled cheese.  The bisque was quite good as was the grilled cheese. Not quite as good as Serendipity 3 but certainly closer and easier to get to without schleping to the strip.  

The thing that took this down a * to a 2* was the service. I can understand if they are jamming on an NFL Sunday or the World Cup etc but it was pretty much an echo chamber on our side of the room, yet service was so very slow. Except in getting our food on the table because about 5 minutes after our appetizers showed up, there was our meal.  Which in retrospect of the bad wings, was ok, but I would have liked to have finished the shared Korean BBQ first. 

Then after we were done, we sat there for another 10-15 minutes waiting for our waitress (and asking the bus person 2x) to bring our check.  

This is like the 3rd place in a row that we've been that the food was not bad but the service was so non-existent.  I know the excuse 3 years ago was because there were so many people pouring into Vegas that restaurants didn't care whether you got good service or not, you were \"lucky\" to get a table but you'd think with so many places closing their doors, the ones who are actually doing a good job would want to encourage passable customer service.  

ah well ..IF we can get in, we'll def. go back.  I want to go when I'm not driving so I can try some of their handcrafted libations."}
{"text":"Had my reservations since the sister site at the Linq was a disappointment. Thanks to the great people at this location I will be looking for more of this chain while traveling. Gabe made us feel so welcomed and was on the spot attentive. Duck fat chips with dipping sauces and duck legs in an Asian sauce hit the mark. Too bad my brother forgot his high roller hat there."}
{"text":"AWESOME beer selection.  Great location.  Great prices.  Very happy with the Happy Hour food selections. Try the Thai Pizza and the Truffle Fries for starters.  Bartenders are very attentive to make your visit a great experience.  They were also accommodating as we wanted to \"sample\" the beers before committing to a Shorty or a pint.  Will definitely be back again. Thanks Yardhouse!"}
{"text":"You can't lose here. The place is busy and loud but you can eat out side if your not into loud. Great food and amazing beer selection. Try the youngs double chocolate a personal favorite."}
{"text":"Food isn't bad and the atmosphere is nice but the customer service sucks!!!!! A little over priced not worth it unless you go on m-w 1030 half off apps. 

Not only did they forget to give us our silverware and napkins but when we order dessert that was completely screwed up. Then when our food came they forgot half of it in the kitchen!

{"text":"A FIVE STAR REVIEW WITH ISSUES*

Requested a patio seat for one. Host quoted 15-25 minutes. Totally cool with that, they are always slammed and this was no exception. Got my buzzer, I anticipated a long wait as the patio is an extremely popular spot. The temperature and atmosphere makes the wait always worth it. 50 minutes go by and no buzzing on my Yard House hockey puck (I'm always forgiving on wait times). I ask the host, \"Hey, just wanted to make sure I'm still on the list... after flipping through 3 full pages of check ins.. \"oh, I called you (buzzed you) awhile ago...! Ok, I guess my ass is numb I'm thinking to myself. Fortunately, a bad ass manager is nearby (Jeff) who curiously and politely interrupts the host and gets me seated immediately! Thanks Jeff!

I feel bad as I'm seated at a 4 top, but business levels are slowing down and there only a few 2 tops on the lower patio, soooo my guilt fades. 

Had my beer ready to order as I had about an hour to think about it. Server Kathryn took care of me promptly with water to start and my beer quick to follow. Order the shitake mushroom and garlic noodles to start under the \"snack\" portion of the menu. I get these almost every time I come here. Large enough portion to fill up on if you're enjoying beer, no jokes. After the noodle heaven I order the Beer Batter Fish and Chips for the first time. Again, promptly delivered with beer battered fries and a jalapeño tarter and an aoli (I forget the name, but it's delicious). The sauce sides are small so I immediately knew I would need additional tarter. The food runner (Kevin) asked if there was anything additional he could provide me. I quickly asked him if could get an additional tarter sauce from him and he politely ablidged! Thanks young man! 

After my first bite of fries I noticed they were cold and slightly stale. It also looked like I received the bottom of the barrel with most of the handful of fries being less than 2 inches long. Tough to grab, eat or dip. All good though, Server Kathryn checked in immediately and got me some fresh fries right away (although not beer bettered). No worries. They were hot and delicious!

Although they were some issues this evening (out of the norm) you completely redeemed yourself. 

Every place makes mistakes or errors. It's the genuine service recovery and effort that makes the biggest difference. You turned what could have been an abisimal , uncharacteristic experience into a phenomenal one. You deserve to be appriciated!!

SO...THANK YOU!!!!- JEFF, KATHRYN, AND KEVIN.

I'll be back....

{"text":"Goodness... not the best experience here. I was just at Yard House in Las Vegas & was craving the California roll again, so we came here for happy hour. We were seated at 3 promptly. Beers & water came quickly. So far, so good. Around 3:20ish our waiter finally takes our order. Spinach dip app. Which comes about 10 minutes later with like 8 pita bread chips. Sad looking plate. Around 4:15 our waiter comes back and says \"um what did you order again?\" So we tell him & at around 4:30 we get 2 more dishes steaming hot.. like burn your mouth hot. Then 10 minutes later my California roll comes out half cold, half hot. I kid you not. The last time I had it the whole thing was warm. I did not like the half cold/hot thing. It was not good. Then we were brought the wrong check. 
Our waiter was trying very hard to be pleasant & friendly, but overall this was just not a good dining experience. Over an hour for food is unacceptable."}
{"text":"Ugh. Worst birthday dinner ever. Went last night with my family for my birthday at 5:00. Place was packed because of the hockey game. Got sat at 5:30, that's fast considering. However, took 20 minutes to get drinks. Didn't get our food until 7:00!!! Moms steak was undercooked and was still undercooked when they brought another one. My brothers pasta obviously sat under the heat lamp forever while they cooked my moms steak because it was crusty and dried out. My husbands gnocchi had a hair in it. All they did to make it right was offer free dessert. I felt bad convincing my family who had never been there to try it out. I will stick to the location in Desert Ridge."}
{"text":"A great place to escape from the Strip for a while, They do great Happy hours which include a great selection of Beers and Appetisers, Its also located at the new Linq shopping area. Awesome friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"I rated other locations as 5 star, but this one needs some work in the kitchen department..  I have to give this 2 stars because I will avoid this location in the future, unless it is just for dessert.

I usually eat at the Orange County locations,  but I came here because this is one of my favorite chains.  

I was let down because my usual entree, the Lamb Chops, weren't the same as in OC.   

They tasted bland, and were lacking some seasoning.   Of the 10+ times I've had them at Yard House, these by far were the worst I've ever had.  I wasn't in the mood to complain, but the server didn't even come around to check on the food until I ate about half my entree. 

The brownie dessert was perfect, however."}
{"text":"I decided to visit Red Rock casino one random Friday night, and man, there must have been some event going on, because the place was packed. After getting tired of waiting at the casino bar for a drink, I decided to head over to the Yard House (which is located inside the casino) to grab a craft brew instead. 

I have been to plenty of Yard House's during my existence, and this visit in Summerlin was great. I found a seat at the bar and was quickly offered menus from the busy bartenders. The beer selection was solid as always, and the food was consistent. I always get the wings and veggie buffalo bites, and both were delicious as always. 

My favorite part of the night though was their entertainment for the night. They played random pop music videos all night. I LOVE music videos, and the fact that they were playing them in the bar caused me to stay longer and rack up a bigger bill than planned. Oh well, it was worth it."}
{"text":"Normally a great dining experience, today not so much. 15 minute wait for a waiter to even show up at our table. Flagged down another waiter to get us a drink. Manager came out and apologized. Daughters glass was dirty and had to be sent back. Manager again came out and apologized. Got our bill and nothing was comped? Not expecting a free meal but geeze at least com our ice teas."}
{"text":"Glorified Applebee's. I think they want the yard of beer to cover the lack luster food & services."}
{"text":"Place is big and nice and Amazing! I came here on a Friday afternoon and it was packed I can only imagine evenings. 

I had the lunch special turkey club, ranch salad, and fries. 

Fires pretty good, club and salad Weren't terrible but a little lack luster and disappointing. Club was a little bland and dry. Didn't like corn and big carrots in the salad. 

Server Jay was pretty good even though I was in the far corner"}
{"text":"I've been a repeat customer ever since they've opened. The atmosphere and service has always been great, but it seems like the food is slipping in quality. The mixed greens salad served with dried out carrots and wilted lettuce leaves along with a simple classic cheeseburger is very mediocre and phoned-in. That's pretty much the way to describe the food here nowadays, just really phoned-in and uninspired. 

Good beer list at least."}
{"text":"When I was a drinker I would have given this place 5 stars but now that i'm not all I can give for now is 4. Which is still good, especially for a corporate chain restaurant.

I have to say on every occasion I have been here I have always had a good experience. The food was always good and service consistent. When I accompany my beer drinking friends to the bar the bartender is always helpful and friendly. 

My favorite items are the turkey pot pie and chop salad. I wish I could order both in one sitting but the gigantic portions keep me from over indulging in the goodness."}
{"text":"I absolutely love YH. The service is always great at this location -- and the food choices never let me down. The restaurant is always well kept -- bathrooms are always clean -- and the atmosphere is absolutely relaxing. Glad it's close to me because when I don't feel like cooking and I'm unsure where to eat out at, we always end up defaulting to YH because we can always count on great food, amazing choices, and convenience."}
{"text":"Stopped by with family after a movie night, just a basic pub style restaurant. No frills just the basics and overpriced, not really my kind if restaurant."}
{"text":"We Love going to eat here because even if they are super busy the food still is consistent.  The staff is super friendly. The happy hour menu is awesome!"}
{"text":"Four of us visited the Desert Ridge location last night, on Halloween before a movie. We were able to sit outside which was great because the weather was awesome. We had the Coconut Shrimp as the appetizer and it was very good. The appetizer included 4 very large shrimp that we were able to cut into pieces and share amongst us.

The Fish and Chips were also very good. Our server was very friendly and willing to offer suggestions. I have food allergies and she allowed me to make changes to menu items in order to be able to avoid the foods I am allergic to, and she did it with a smile on her face.

The prices are little higher than most typical bar restaurants. My date and I had two entrees and only one cocktail and it was still about $60 between us, after tip. We enjoyed our food but something to keep in mind."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite chain restaurants hands down and is a go to choice anytime I'm not trying somewhere new.  Being that it is located at Red Rock Casino & Resort, one of the best in all of Las Vegas, makes it that much more awesome.  If you've never been to Yard House, I think you will really enjoy it.

Positives
1) Beer selection is about as good as you can get.  I don't know the exact count of beers on tap but the beer selections have their own menu!  Best part of the beer selection is it is mostly made up of craft beers from all over the place with a heavy concentration of West Coast selections from Nevada, California, Arizona, Colorado, Washington, & Oregon.  Also a wide range of German, Belgium, and other European selections.  They also have national domestics if craft beer isn't your thing.  It's fun trying new beers and this place gives you a lot of options.  They will provide a sample of any beer on the menu if you don't want to commit without trying.  You can get beer in a pint or large \"half yard\" glass!
2) Food Menu is huge and has EVERYTHING!  Appetizers, entree salads, steaks, ribs, sandwiches, seafood, pasta, street tacos, pizza, & burgers!  I'm sure everyone will find something they will like on this robust menu!  I recommend the boneless firecracker wings, deviled eggs, chicken lettuce wraps, and poke nachos for appetizers.  But you can also have calamari, coconut shrimp, or Wisconsin cheese curds. For main meal I recommend Fried Chicken Sandwich, Chicken Cobb Salad, Maui Pineapple Chicken, Fish & Chips, any pizza. and their street tacos!  Get the tacos \"vampire style\", you won't regret it! 
3) They have great desserts!  S'mores brownie and mini creme brûlée are fantastic!
4) The restaurant is huge and also has patio seating.  The service is consistent and friendly and you can use Boarding pass points to pay for your meal."}
{"text":"The vibe of this place is nice - we got a table and ordered some beers and appetizers.  The coconut prawns were outstanding.  We then ordered some salads.  Beers were good.  Service here is outstanding and so nice and friendly.   The noise level was good - happy, lively but we were able to easily carry on our conversations are well.   Prices are good too.  Definitely a place to return to again and again - so many more things to try....can't wait."}
{"text":"Yardhouse is one of my favorite places to go for HH. The HH menu has a variety of food but I'm a big fan of the turkey sliders and the chicken nachos. The sliders are always moist with bits of carrots in it and mozzarella topped on the meat. The chicken nachos has fake cheese, real cheese, large chunks of meat and of course the beans, sour cream and guacamole on top. It's loud enough that when you bring kids it's not a big deal either. Their menu is so huge that you can easily find something for everyone!  Also, the HH is NOT limited to the bar. That's a big plus because sometimes there is no room at the bar and it is nice that they include all patrons for this awesome deal.

Overall since its a chain restaurant there is plenty of service even when it's happy hour. We've always left happy and I love that YH is that much closer."}
{"text":"I like the Yardhouse....yet another chain, but it's definitely worth your time. Their Happy Hour menu is pretty awesome...with a variety of food for everyone and anyone and drinks....reasonably priced. 

However, my favorite dish to get is the (Mac and Cheese)^2. Chicken, bacon, mushrooms and truffle oil....it's my favorite. Although at 17 dollars, it's not for the faint of heart. The bf decided to get the Pastrami Sandwich and he was loving it also. Who can resist some pastrami with shoestring french fries? I know I can't.

Overall, this place is a good place to try lots of different beers and just to have some good decent food."}
{"text":"Beer: 10/10
Food: 10/10
Price: 8/10
Music: FIRE 

If I had any one person to give my aux cord to it'd be Yard House hands down. They need to make this playlist on Spotify so I can enjoy it in the comfort of my own home cuz I can't afford to live at the bar rail.

UPDATE: There is in fact a 'Yard House' Spotify playlist. My life has 100% been complete!"}
{"text":"Visited last night and ordered the steak quesadilla and short rib taco. Wasn't a fan of the quesadilla itself, but the steak and peppers were good. The taco was my favorite. Great staff, server was awesome, and food was good and prices were decent compared to other restaurants on the strip."}
{"text":"The food and selection of drinks are always great. I never have a problem with service, and also surprising considering how crowded it gets. The happy hour specials also allows me to eat and drink without busting my wallet. It's always busy at this location and has such a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"This restaurant has sub par reviews because their management and customer service are also sub par. I've been going to yard house for years - particularly because I am Vegan and they have an awesome Veg friendly
Menu. Well, tonight I went to watch my football game with some friends and apparently I got \"too excited and too loud\" for their \"family establishment\" and the manager came over and told me to quiet down. I am a 5'4\" dainty woman who had one drink and yes gets excited for her football. It was past 8 pm and yet the \"manager\" felt the need to come over and tell me they wouldn't serve me anymore because once again, all of a sudden, they are a \"family establishment\". I'm sorry but you serve over a hundred beers and you have televisions everywhere. If you want to draw a family crowd, have a happy meal and some crayons- don't get angry at the few patrons you have in the bar on a Thursday night. I'm disgusted by the way I was treated and I will NEVER, EVER return to this \"family establishment\". What a joke. I plan to speak to a Regional General Manager today as well as my attorney in regards to filing a harassment claim."}
{"text":"Yardhouse is interesting.

Great beer selection, but  usually overpriced, too rich, too salty, meh food.

Go for brews, maybe an appetizer, sit at the bar."}
{"text":"So went for grilled artichoke. No longer THERE!!! SOOO SAD!!!  But I tried the edamame. Fantastic!!  Also had kale salad EXCELLENT!!  Every Time I come here I'm always surrounded by smiles and good service. I had Gina as a Server, she was GREAT!!  Keep up the good work. Thank you again for great food and great service. Like always will be coming back for more!!"}
{"text":"Love the vibe in this place, great food (ahi crunchy salad to die for as well as the NY steak sandwich), and always amazing service. Our waiter today in particular Stephen is awesome we need more people like him in the service industry in Vegas. So kudos to you Stephen thank you for making our Friday night diner extra special."}
{"text":"It gets 3 stars based on the safety that it is Yardhouse; decent food and great beer selection.

I went with a group of 10, ready to stay for the evening....but after dinner we went elsewhere.  The eating area is big and open enough (I actually prefer it to the one in Town Center).  But thats where the good news ends.

The wait staff was slow and inaccurate.  They actually argued that the raspberry beer they brought was the dunkel we ordered.  The manager ultimately agreed with us.  Secondly, but importantly, they have a 1-drink-at-a-time rule.....
Everyone knows at a popular restaurant you order when the waiter comes around.  At this particular YardHouse, they will not bring you a beer until the one you have is less than a quarter done.  So now you must wait another 20-30min until the server comes around to check to even make an order.
They let us slide a little because they thought we were a good crowd....ridiculous"}
{"text":"After a long weekend in Vegas, I'm glad this place was able to bring me back to life haha. The food was solid.. I was able to get the jerk chicken wings, and those were definitely on hit. I would've gotten more, but I was already full off the ribeye steak, yummy yummy. I like medium well, so it was cooked to perfection. I honestly think this is the first place we should have ate, instead of the last. Definitely worth going too, if you're in town. My party that I was with also enjoyed their food, and we all left more than satisfied with our Bellies full. Service was on point, as thy kept the water coming(which was necessary) and we didn't have to keep calling for them, As we were constantly being checked on. I recommend"}
{"text":"The Yardhouse is a nice place to go if you're tired of the same old brews on tap. They have a fantastic and interesting selection of beers available, even if their staff sometimes can't offer much help! In their defense, though, the beer list is quite lengthy.

This particular location has a pretty nice patio with a fire pit outside that makes for some great people watching. I find that every Yardhouse I've been to is always incredibly loud. Maybe it's the cement floors that just ricochet the sound throughout the restaurant, but it makes for the main reason I stay away from these restaurants until a friend drags me along for happy hour.

The food is decent and I'll give them props for having a wide variety of tastes that goes well beyond your typical bar food. Unfortunately, everything is only decent. People rave about the truffle fries, but for me personally, I've never been into the white truffle oil thing and think it tastes like gasoline - fresh truffles are another matter entirely. 
The ahi tuna poke bowl is fresh and my favorite thing to order here- light soy sauce, rich avocado, a little bit of crunch and sesame oil.. great success. 
The ahi tuna burgers on the other hand- which claim to be fresh ahi tuna that is hand chopped - automatically comes cooked well. Who.. in their right mind.. cooks fresh ahi tuna well?! It's madness I tell you, and made those burgers that were once great, completely below par. If you decide to go this route - make sure you specify how you want them done!
The deviled eggs were a little sweet, but definitely a fun and unusual choice for a restaurant.
Ahi tuna caesar salad- exactly what you'd expect.
French onion soup - decent, but nothing to rave about. A small bowl with provolone melted over the top, a little lighter broth than most places, the bread was okay. Just okay.

Overall, a good happy hour with something for everyone - even a fire pit!"}
{"text":"Yes, it's a chain.  I love being able to get a Duval on tap OR a great glass of New Zealand Souvignon Blanc with their delicious Tuna Poke.  I'd eat the Tuna Poke every day!  The chicken lettuce wraps are fantastic but the mushroom lettuce wraps are BETTER!  I wish they would mix them.  

I LOVE the Yard House, it's consistently good, you know you can get a GREAT Beer and they have a good wine selection as well.  The food has something for everyone and I don't feel like I'm eating bar food.  BUILD ONE IN AWESOMETOWN."}
{"text":"Had lunch yesterday, the service was on point and the vegan burger was amazing, it's so good, so good... ordered one to go. I loved it, I'll be back."}
{"text":"We had a large party, and the staff from the hostess to the manager, to the servers were all so accommodating. They were also very patient and friendly to the kids in our party. Everybody enjoyed their food and I think that it is so nice that they offer vegan options. I was very impressed with the vegan burger. It was flavorful and had a good texture. I can't wait to return just to have it again!"}
{"text":"I won't lie- I love the Yardhouse. They have an amazing selection of beer and one of the best burgers you can get at a chain restaurant. The prices are a bit higher but so is the quality.

But I must take away some stars for  their reservation policy. My husband loves The Yardhouse, so 2 of his birthday dinners have now been held there. Despite having over 10 people they still refuse to accept a reservation or even allow call ahead. The night we went there was no hockey game or event but with the Superbowl around the corner- Westgate was busier than usual. We arrived 45 minutes before the rest of the party did and we were still quoted an hour and a half wait time.

Previous reviews were right about the small bar area- it makes it very hard to waste your wait time there, and while the patio is nice I wish it had more space to accommodate people waiting for a table with beverage in hand."}
{"text":"I generally leave reviews that are favorable for the restaurants as I do genuinely enjoy most of the places I review. However, my experience at this particular Yardhouse location paled in comparison to the other two locations I've been to in Tucson (yes this place was worse than being in Tucson) and Scottsdale. The first thing I noticed was that the restaurant had an unpleasant smell to it and that the floors were very, very slick inside the restaurant. Service was poor from wait times to customer service, and the food quality and preparation just did not feel like it compared to previous visits. Our waiter was rude and awkward and even had the nerve to make a comment to us that we should enjoy a free drink that the bar had mistakenly poured wrong not once, but twice. 

Update: I was contacted by Yard House, and they expressed their concern regarding my experience which is greatly appreciated. I will be going back to Yard House, but likely a different location."}
{"text":"I love their appetizer plates and very close to our house. Very affordable place and family friendly."}
{"text":"Good food and great drinks. Can be on the expensive side but the happy hour helps ease the pain on your wallet. I love going. Always great service. They also have the best green tea I've ever tasted in my life. I'd just go for that in all honesty."}
{"text":"My friends keep voting this place down because \"it's a chain\". But it is a chain that I like... I always have great beers to choose from, always have a great time and always get good service. So I don't really care that its a chain. I still get great happy hour here, never have a bad meal. And sometimes after shopping at Fashion Square, I need to drink my spending anxiety away. If you know what I mean...."}
{"text":"Waiting for flight  and needed to get out of the heat.  Had no plans of eating due to wife's food allergies CELIAC.  Low and behold an allergen menu.   Our server Mike S amazing went out of his way to listen and discuss with appropriate staff regarding the situation.  If more people took the time it would be easier to eat out.  Thanks Mike S !"}
{"text":"Ooh, la la! Super cool place.

It's very busy on Friday & Saturday eves, but worth the good time.  My party & I went there on a Friday @ 9:30 p.m. & waited for about 30 minutes to get seated.

Food was fab, took a while to get out, but you could tell it was prepared to order and fresh!  Try the brownie for desert, that thing is orgasmic!  It came right out of the oven.  My girlfriends had martinis and DAYUM, soo good, the watermelon one tastes just like a jolly rancher.

The seating is quite cramped, especially out on the patio...but whatev, it's all good.  

GO!"}
{"text":"Went here twice.  Chicken nachos  and cuban sandwiches were good.  Tacos were REALLY bad.  Do not get them.  We tried the baja fish, swordfish and chicken.  All were equally awful.  That's all I have to say about this place."}
{"text":"Saturday Dec 7th 2013, My family & I went out to celebrate my wife's birthday. We were told it would be a 15 to 20 minute wait. I gave my name to the hostess and was given a pager. 25 minutes later, I approached the hostess area and asked how long. I was told we we be next, but it would be 10 to 15 minutes. I go back to the hostess' again and was told they are clearing a table. 15 minutes go by and I again talk to the hostess (she was quite snooty and more concerned with watching the ASU football game) and she checked  with her fellow hostess' on their paper logs to see where we were for check in. I was told my name and the pager were not accounted for and that they would clear a table right away. It took another 10 minutes and we were seated. One of the hostess' must of contacted one of the managers (thank you to her). A very nice manager offered 2 free appetizers for our wait (a nice gesture). I told the manager that we did not even get an apology from any of the hostess' and that they should have better customer service. Next, we waited another 7 to 10 minutes for our server (I believe her name to be Rebekah). She was impatient and quite rude off the top. We ordered our drinks and she was off. During that time, the manager who spoke to us earlier, told her of our extended wait and her attitude suddenly changed, mainly to please her boss more than the customer. We ordered, my wife's meal came out as a kid's order. They made a new order for us to take home. We ate, celebrated my wife's birthday and vowed we would not return. Poor, poor customer service for a place I liked. Yes, a place like this gets packed, especially when local sports are playing, but each customer that walks through those doors should be treated well. I should have stiffed them on the tip, but I did not. A horrible experience."}
{"text":"PROs:
1. Good Happy Hour, with Reverse Happy Hour - The Poke stack is deelish, the spicy thai pizza is sooo yum, hmm pretty much all of it is good.  I need to try the garlic noodles, sounds good!
2.)  Tons of Beers - UM I dont even like beer all that much, but I get dizzy just looking at the menu.
3.) I wish I got the guys name, cause he impressed me the most.  It was a game day so the bar was packed, standing room only crowd behind me as I enjoyed my bar seat.  On one occasion a guy came up and asked this bartender if they had a certain beer, he immediately said \"No, terrible beer man\". Hahaha, but gave a suggestion to the customer of a similar better tasting beer!  It was great.  So I continued to listen to him provide suggestions to everyone that asked him for a beer.  
4.) TVs scattered around nicely.
5.) The patio and the comfy chairs, definitely group happy hour friendly.

CONS:
1.)When it isn't happy hour its way to expensive
2.)The glasses are not ICEY cold, I dont know how anyone can drink draft beer out of a cup that is not icey cold. (I'm picky)
3.)On game days, they card  you at the door, put a bracelet on you, and then when you sit down, they ask your for your id again!  This is the most annoying thing ever, I understand the risks of serving someone under age, but if you are going to card me to get in, put a braclet on me and then ask me for my ID when I sit down, after I have already put it away, I'm angrY!  Sorry it seriously bugs me, obviously!

Of course I'll be back here, because there isn't really a big selection at WestGate, and I don't always want sushi!"}
{"text":"horrible horrible horrible customer service!!! I waited 30 minutes at the bar watching at least 6 employees standing around texting with out even acknowledging my presences... not to mention the bar tenders nee to go back to school and learn how to make cocktails"}
{"text":"I don't understand why this yard house has such good ratings. 

Came in for happy hour and it was packed. But my rating isn't about how packed it was. 

I want to give 1 star for the food. Service was alright as well. I know they are busy so I forgive them on that part. 

I ordered 2 appetizer. 

Hawaiian pokie - just horrible! It was drenched in sesame oil! I had to take all the carrots and radish off because it was soaking my wonton chip. I had to hold up my chip just let the oil drip off. I'll upload the picture of the oil. It would of been good but it was so over powering. They should know better. 

Second appetizer was fried calamari. How can you go wrong with that.... Well it was dry and over cooked! 

Entrée -steak and shrimp medium rare- steak was not medium rare, it tasted like it was frozen. Mash potato had a weird taste like mold . 

Manager herd me and didn't do crap and walked away. Terrible management"}
{"text":"Food, eh. Service, eh. Everything, eh. 
I wasn't planning on ever coming back, but due to a friend insisting on taking us again because \"they know the good stuff\", we will return. I'd honestly rather go to Applebee's..."}
{"text":"Soup was amazing. We had clam chowder and tomato bisque. Thai Chicken pizza was great also. A little bit loud. Dessert sampler...fantastic."}
{"text":"Bummer Ahi salad ncluded a chunk of plastic  mixed in. Sorry a free dessert doesnt make up for it."}
{"text":"In context  of eating prior to  hockey.

We've usually avoided this location on game night since the 30-45 min waits rarely fit in with our plans.This Saturday ,Mar14th ,we made a deliberate attempt to get in , waited 30 mins. Got in around 1800, game starts 1900 . The appetizer, entree and drinks were pretty good but we had 2 1/2 yard drinks  which made it hard to have the plate right in front of us. 

  1/2 a burger and 1/2 the fries are just swept up by the staff. No attempt to verify our intentions just whoosh.

Server Aimee was apologetic and would have gotten us replacement fries ( no burger seemingly) or the manager but we had a game to get to that would have been disrupted by either offer. The $80 check for two people has to come with a degree of care and attention that weren't obvious.  So the food is certainly worth a 3.5 , but I can't recall the last time we had our plates taken with such \"reckless efficiency\"

Update: Have received a $25  certificate for this process and will  put it towards another outing( probably at another  of their locations). 

Update 2: 
Actually we reconsidered it and decided that  this was a poor attempt to resolve a situation that shouldn't have occurred. It's off our list."}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed the food. My lamb burger was very tasty and he had the halibut which he said was very good. Good portions on the servings. Typical bar and grill atmosphere but no too loud or rowdy. Good place for family gatherings."}
{"text":"$200 at Yard House goes a long way for three adults and three kids.  We came here for dinner and order almost everything on the appetizer menu, on top of two entrees and two desserts.  Seriously, this is some mad eating disorder.  Here's what we grind on: 

Appetizers: Seared ahi, ahi roll, ahi nacho, crab cake, crab artichoke dip, seared scallops

Entrees: Sea bass, steak taco

Sides: clam chowder, garlic noodle and kids spaghetti

Desserts: vanilla ice cream and coffee cookie sundae

When we were done ordering, the waiter was in shocked.  At the end of the meal, our waiter was speechless when he saw that we finish ALL the food.  What can I say?   Great place, great service!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to eat.  It's got a good atmosphere, although it's a bit noisy inside.  The sweet potato fries with maple bacon dip are great, as are the parmesan truffle fries.  We also love the halibut."}
{"text":"Our first time on yard house


Hi everyone today we decided to have a lunch at yard house 
We believed is Going to be great 
But we had a terrible experience with the customer service for some reason we had four different waiters  ridiculous on my own personal opinion.
Any way we order a tortilla soup  really good loved 
But the steak tacos was bad and we order a carnitas tacos (means pork) and we get a chicken tacos,

My burger was good half goat and half beef good flavor.

After a while we told the waiter we order a pork tacos no chicken and takes forever to come back for our table carnitas tacos are bad we don't liked 
Next time when you guys  recommend tacos    Give us the choice  on flour or corn tortillas 

This is the cherry at the end of the cake check this out 
The manager came to talk whit us 
And he said I'm apologize for all the inconvenience but something they I can do for you and I explain everything then you guys already knows and I ask a couple questions from the menu and he don't so have the answers for my and again he said I'm apologizing 
My reaction was try to fix this little problem because your food is ok but your service is terrible and he said I'm Going to give you a free desert for the inconvenience 

Alright the desert was the only good think from the whole time the we spend on this restaurant  

I guess we had a bad luck :(
definitely I'm not going to come back to this place"}
{"text":"The Yard House, for me anyway, is strictly a happy hour stop.  The beer selection is first rate with too many on tap to count.  The food specials during HH are great.  The entrees are ok but if you're in this neighborhood you have dozens of better options."}
{"text":"284. My favorite happy hour. I was SO excited when I discovered this location, you have no idea. 

+1 for extended happy hour. The game was on that afternoon, so their HH lasted till the end of the game that day. Can we carry this over to the San Jose location? (:

I wish I caught our server's name because he was pretty bomb. I've tried all of the fruit beers already, so it was time to branch out. He brought out sampler after sampler just so I could find the perfect drink.

We only had the spinach dip because we were going to grab dinner right after. Good food, good drinks, and a good game."}
{"text":"I guess when there's a fruit fly in your drink it does not seem an apology or rather any compassion or care whatsoever from these people. I had a cocktail at the bar that had a fruit fly and pointed it out to the manager on duty (man in a white tight long sleeve) he basically just shrugged it off and said \"oh that's a fruit fly\" WELL NO SHIT. Perhaps you should clean your bars? This is an indoor bar) 

Either way, shrugged off and charged full price for the cocktail and then short poured. 

Whatever Yardhouse. Your service sucks."}
{"text":"Ok the Day was lovely we sat on the patio and we had the best waiter Garin was GREAT!! Had the 32oz Honey Blonde and it was great! We did appetizers the Moo Shu Egg Rolls, the Spinach Dip, and the Crab cakes. Everything was awesome!!!! Definitely will come back Yard house!!!"}
{"text":"We are always fans of Yard House and have become acquainted with some of the bar staff. We've never had bad service but we always sit at the bar.  Great beer selections, happy hour prices are reasonable. Great place to meet people, too."}
{"text":"It's yardhouse, i mean i don't really prefer this type of bar. I love DIVES!! so this is a new thing for me to frequent. 

My friends love it and they aren't bad at all. The food meets requirements of a bar and actually exceeds at times. 

Options on tap are awesome but it breaks the bank..

My advice. Happy hour."}
{"text":"I LOVED this location! It wasn't as busy as the other Yard House, in Town Square, but that's probably due to the fact that I went the second day that they opened but they were still pretty busy, considering. I'm almost positive that they'll have a 1-2 hour wait VERY soon... 

We parked outside, not in the parking garage so we were able to walk up to the front of the restaurant from the outside. The beautiful fountain/endless waterfall thing is there, it's real nice! Inside was real nice as well but I wasn't able to walk over to the other entrance from the inside of the hotel so can't comment on that. As in any Yard House, TVs for sports! 

Our server was Ricky, he was an AWESOME server. Knew the menu, inside and out it seemed! We went for HH (M-F 3-6pm & Sun-W 10-Close) and they have awesome items on the menu. We ordered 2 Kona Longboard Beers, 2 Guiness, Chinese Garlic Noodles, Hawaiian Poke Stack, Margherita Pizza and Classic Sliders. The portions are like at any Yard House, not tiny but it wouldn't hurt to get 2 appetizers to get full, if you're there for HH. 

We'll be returning! I'm so excited that we don't have to drive all the way to LV BLVD to enjoy me some Yard House!"}
{"text":"Great place to visit for Happy Hour, love it. Lots of Beer to choose from, mmm, beer. They have a few TVs at the bar. Outdoor seating area, misters in the summer time, hate those things, if I wanted to get all the water from the misters in my food and drink, I'd be better off sitting right next to the splash zone at Sea World.

Thing I hate: the loud ass music that they play from time to time. It's annoying!!! I walk out of there sometimes feeling like I just got out of a club! WTF."}
{"text":"Yard house has some decent food! I was seriously craving a BBQ chicken salad, and you just GOTTA hit up a chain for that stuff, so ended up here.

The BBQ chicken salad was delicious- 4/5 stars.
The jambalaya- 4/5 stars. Way better than Cheesecake Factory, had great sauce, just wish there was more! We got half portion, and regretted it soon after taking a bite."}
{"text":"I have been here three times since I've been in Glendale on a business trip.  Everything I have had was delicious and what a great selection.Tonight I had dessert, salted caramel butterscotch pudding and fresh whipped cream it was amazing. Our server Chris was awesome!"}
{"text":"Been here about 5 times now and its always good.  Met fellow Yelpsters Jason W and Greg D here for happy hour hijinx.  Servers are always very, very nice and fast.  Even when the place fills up.  The poke stack is good and the wings make me wana slap my mama they so good.  Pretty good draft selection but they need to rotate stuff more.  60 taps are great but when I come a month apart and they still the same beers that's kinda boring.  Oh,  DO NOT SIT IN THE ROOM OFF TO THE LEFT!  They always try and seat us in there and its 9,000 degrees in there when the natural sunlight heats up the room.  A/C cannot cut it back there.  Just ask Jason W.  Sweat stains all over his blouse..."}
{"text":"This place has great service, atmosphere, drinks.... A great place to take a date :) Hint Hint guys. Women love this place. Get them a few house drinks and their panties will drop. The food is \"ok\". I've never really had anything award winning here but a must for a late night hang out."}
{"text":"Great food and a fun atmosphere. I have been here a couple times and it's been consistently great. On my last visit I enjoyed the Halibut. It was fantastic, seasoned well and cooked perfectly. Served with vegetables and mashed potatoes. Both very flavorful and presented well. My companion had a burger with lobster. It was the best burger she has ever had. The place is usually crowded and loud, but it is a great place to meet with friends. The staff is top notch and you'll always get great service"}
{"text":"Went to the Yard House last evening after the Legends shows at the Flamingo Hotel for a late dinner.  The menu was extensive and I ended up getting, Korean Short Rib Tacos.  It came with spicy rice and beans.  It liked small but  to be honest, it was a perfect sized portion for that late in the evening.  It was fresh and very tasty.  My partner had a burger with shoestring fries.  He liked it but he only ate half because he was not too hungry.  He asked for the burger with cheese and pickles only, and they mistakenly added garlic aioli.  He tries it and he say it was fine.  

At the end of the meal, the extremely nice waiter said he will buy us dessert because if the mistake.  It was but necessary but very nice. 

The meal was very good and we recommend it to anyone because of  the large menu, delicious food and the great service."}
{"text":"Manual was horrible, that's all. If you get him as a servers ask for a different one. Besides that I love yard house."}
{"text":"I ended up going here twice because the service was so accommodating! I have food allergies and am vegetarian. All staff was extremely friendly and welcoming. Both servers for each visit made an extra effort to create a meal to fit my special needs. It's hard going out to eat and I was relieved to find somewhere I could rely on for great food and service."}
{"text":"Terrible service. I'm actually shocked. Yard House in CA is one of our go to spots to eat with consistent great food and excellent service. This location was so bad it was almost funny. Inside was freezing so we asked to be seated outside bc it was warmer. My friends wives were still cold so my buddy asked if they could turn on the heaters above our table. The manager came out and Said that the heaters were all connected so he wouldn't turn them on bc they might heat up the neighboring 3 tables. Makes sense, no big deal. When my buddy asked him if he could Ask the other tables if they minded the heaters bc his wife was extremely cold, the manger Rudely said \"I'm not going to ask people that.\" Very weird for a manager to speak that way, but maybe he is having a bad day. I have an oil allergy. I told our waiter I have the allergy and asked for my asparagus to be steamed. I also ordered a med Rare steak. Food comes out , my asparagus is drenched in oil my steak is well done. They  also totally forgot my buddies steak all together. Very bad customer experience"}
{"text":"We tried the mini trio sampler and it was delicious! This place is always great!!! Try the onion rings tower, super yummy"}
{"text":"So you're tired of eating on the Vegas Strip and just want to grab a sandwich and relax at a great place with reasonable prices. This is a great place that is located fairly close to the Strip.  It is very easy to get here by car or taxi too.

Yardhouse has a decent selection and it's good for meals or just snacking with their Snacks Menu. You can also choose from appetizers, Salads, Pizza, Street Tacos and their Gardein vegetarian selections. Whenever I come to a Yardhouse I like to choose from the Grilled Burgers, Sandwiches and House Favorites.  

We ordered the Ruben sandwich on rye, grilled chicken with avocado and the grilled cheese with tomato bisque.  I tasted all of the sandwiches and I thought that Ruben was by far the best.  When I ordered the Ruben I asked if it came with rye bread and the waiter was not sure.  He was going to check and come back.  It took him some time but he returned and let me know they had rye bread.  A Ruben isn't a Ruben if it's not on rye bread!  

When the food was brought to the table I was talking so I didn't check my sandwich and the bread was not rye.  It took me a while to flag down our waiter and he finally noticed me came over and took my sandwich and fries and replaced them very quickly.  According to the waiter, it seems that the server took the wrong sandwich to the table and mine was sitting there.  It did not seem as warm as the original sandwich they sent out but if I was going to ask for them to exchange it again then everyone would be done with their meals and I would still be eating. So I ate a not so warm sandwich but it had a nice taste to it. I think it would have been an awesome sandwich if it was fresh out of the kitchen.  

The chicken and avocado sandwich was delicious.  The avocado was very fresh and the flavors went really well together.  The chicken was juicy and not overcooked.  The grilled cheese sandwich had tomato on it and it was good. The tomato bisque soup tasted fresh as well and was served at the perfect temperature.  The fries that came with the food were good with one of the orders but not with mine since they must have been sitting around a bit. 

If you are a beer fanatic this is the place for you.  They have a huge selection of about 200 beers.  They rotate some beers so they don't always have all of them available. There are even beer blends, beer floats and beer cocktails. As far as mixed drinks they also have mixed drinks including martinis, cocktails and mules.  They have plenty of wine as well and even Sake.

I only gave the place three stars for serving a sandwich and fries that were not at the right temperature.  Our waiter was professional and polite.. When I'm with my sister we make each other laugh a lot and the waiter was very patient with us.  

I would come back."}
{"text":"Wow Wow & Wow! Great food & an Excellent Drink! The best drink I've had since I've been in Arizona. The Nachos were \"Superb!\" No if, ands or maybe's. Call me a lightweight, but 1 drink was more than enough, I'm currently watering myself down\" I will definitely sleep like a baby tonight! I highly recommend this spot. 
FYI: The Nachos are too much for 1 person; if you can eat it by yourself, \"You're just plain greedy! \"Just saying....

FYI: Excellent Customer Service from Meghan! In the words of Arnold Schwarzenegger, \"I'll Be Back.\""}
{"text":"I had the Pastami Benedict burger - WOW!   Very good.  Really enjoyed the garlic/park fries too.  Great service and atmosphere too."}
{"text":"Amazing place to eat! Everything is always fresh and beautifully presented. 

Your taste buds will have a new bar to jump over when trying to compare entrees for lunch or dinner with other places.

My favorite: SEARED AHI CAESAR seared rare, hearts of romaine, parmesan crisps, croutons and egg free caesar dressing.

I feel so appreciated as a customer because when you check on on foursquare they tweet you back and thank you for visiting.   I hope other restaurants are reading this and take note... with the fight for the consumer discretionary dollar making the customer feel good bring repeat and referral business!  

Don't be put off by the name....come even if you don't drink because it is so much more than a bar to get a yard of beer! 

The service is great food is fantastic!  Must try you will be happy!"}
{"text":"So...the first time we dined here everything was spot on. I was surprised how busy they were on a random weeknight. Our server was excellent! She kept our glasses full of water and made sure we always had a beer available if we wanted one. We munched on truffle fries while we waited and they were the perfect mix of warm, salty and a bit of a crunch. Our entrees were also excellent: my husband ordered the Nashville Hot House Chicken and I had a chicken stir fry which was light and so flavorful. I wasn't expecting that from them!

Then we returned, this time during happy hour, and we're strongly encouraged to order from that menu. I wish we hadn't. The quality of the food just wasn't the same. Everything tasted like reheated frozen appetizers, from our egg rolls to the nachos (which the chicken on it was dry and overcooked). My husband liked his wings and onion rings though. Next time, I'll just stick to an entree, regardless of how cheap their appetizers or small plates are during happy hour."}
{"text":"The food was simply ok. My french onion soup is 5 stars. I love the seared ahi sashimi! 5 stars. I did not like the lobster noodles. They tasted funny and made my stomach hurt. I actually had to return that. I also ordered a Hawaiian Sunset martini. It was good. Tasted like a melted bomb pop lol. My kids got the pepperoni pizza. I tried a piece it was soggy and greasy. But the kids loved it. The blue crabcakes are ok but the mango salsa i could do without. Overall i will most likely go back and try some other things."}
{"text":"The Yard House seems like a sports bar in the surface. A good sports bar is actually needed around here, but don't go on a Saturday for the Ohio State game because they refuse to play the sound. They lost a lot of business due to this. The bartender kept saying it was because they are a \"family\" restaurant. What they really meant is the it is corporate and they have no interest in catering to the local community (other than selling their beer at ridiculously high prices). Sure the beer selection is awesome, sure the food is good, but it is all overpriced."}
{"text":"Their food is good but I give them 2 stars because their service sux if you have 6 or more in your party"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to going to Yard House because I love beer and I heard they have an expansive vegetarian menu. I went to the location in Glendale before but only had beer.

This place was PACKED. Very long wait and the bar was slammed. I could see why. Glorious beer taps as long as the eye can see. Their selection of beers are dazzling. They have large screen TVs playing the hottest games for the bar patrons. I could see myself getting a yard of beer and getting lost in a basketball or football game.

We were hoping to score some seats at the bar but we were finally seated in a booth before we could. The lighting is very dim and the music is very loud. Good music selection though ... something for everyone. Rock from every decade.

I was excited for their Gardein vegetarian selection. I got a veggie burger. It was just okay. The aioli was tasty but standard. Glorified garlic infused mayo basically. I wasn't crazy about the veggie patty. It was the type of veggie patty that tries to mimic beef patties. I prefer the ones that taste like yummy veggies/grains/legumes. The fries were good. Formerly frozen but passable.

I was musing over whether I should have ordered the Gardein chicken strips with fries instead. I have bought the Gardein chicken strips at the store before I found them rather tasty. But then I realized it was much more economical and time saving to buy frozen Gardein chicken strips and frozen french fries and buy a six pack of craft beer, instead of paying the Yard House to fry them up for me for $9 a pop.

My husband ordered a basic burger, medium rare. It came out rare. The server asked if he wants a new one or wants the burger (already sliced in half and covered in aioli) thrown back on the grill. Um, no he wants a new one. After waiting another 20 minutes, my ravenous husband finally got the burger cooked to his liking. He said it was good.

Bottom line... the food and service is just as mediocre as the other chains like Chilis, Applebees, etc. It is just wrapped in a much sleeker package. We might be back to sip some brews and dine on some tasty previously frozen fries while watching the game ... if we can find a seat at the bar. Otherwise, we will have our dinners somewhere else."}
{"text":"We had a party of 11 and the waitress was extremely accommodating and friendly. The food was delicious and brought out quickly. It was most of party's first time going to Yardhouse and we were all blown away with the overall experience."}
{"text":"great happy hour spinch cheese dip it my fav"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a nice happy hour here with my gf this evening. We both got their six dollar traditional wings and tower of onion rings which hit the spot. My wings took awhile to arrive, but the waiter made sure to take that off of the bill. The jerk sauce had a nice cardamom pineapple flavor, with a great finishing burn. The onion rings are nice and crispy encrusted with garlic. 

The skinny margaritas were simple and traditional but strong enough to give you that happy hour feeling. Will definitely return soon for the great service and value, something you'll never find on the strip."}
{"text":"Came here to watch a football game.  Good nachos and wings.  Slow service for a spot that wasn't very busy.  Ordered the mini chocolate soufflé...it was more like a mini-mini.  Little disappointed."}
{"text":"All of our visits have been great! Waiting for a table on the weekends can be long. Service and food are always good. It's very noisy, music is very loud so not a great place to go if you want to have a conversation with someone."}
{"text":"Their beer selection is really great.Tonight  I enjoyed some Green Flash Head Red IPA and Dogfish 90 minute a long with some of their nachos and sliders.

I remember the first time I had their nachos (at the Westgate location) and thinking that they were some of the best nachos I have ever had. I was either drunk or the Westgate location makes them differently because tonight, they weren't anything special. I didn't even see any salsa on them. Writing this review, I am now unsure of why I didn't simply ask for salsa, but it almost seemed like an obvious thing to come with nachos that it slipped my mind.

The sliders were decent, but nothing to ride home about. The french fries were actually the most tasty things that I ate.

Overall though, I am still a fan of Yard House because of their massive craft beer selection. I will still be coming back and giving them another chance to wow me with some other food choice on their menu. I have my fingers crossed."}
{"text":"I liked it.  Great selection of beers and great take on the usual dishes with good flavor and not too oily or fatty.  My only complaint was that both meals we ordered had meat that was very tough and had grissel.  Good flavor, but not the highest quality of meats.  Everything else was good."}
{"text":"I've been to Yardhouse several times. I like that they have so much beer on tap. My wife enjoys the Rose Gaarden (a mix of framboise and Hoegaarden that is really honestly delicious) and I usually go with the Rogue Hazelnut brown.

The food has always been solid. The (mac + cheese)^2 is usually good, the hawaiian poke stack is always tasty (their tuna in general is pretty nice), and they can cook a good burger. So why the three stars? 

Well, we brought some guests here and found ourselves sort of embarrassed. To be fair, it was a Saturday night and they were very, very busy, but our waiter (Ryan) stood out as rude enough that our guests actually commented on it afterwards.

Lest you think I'm being unfair, here's specifically what went wrong, in order.

We had a party of six and were seated at a round table set for five. The host said he'd have us an extra chair in \"just a second,\" after which I saw him speak to our waiter. Our waiter looked at us and then, presumably, went off to find a chair. I stood there, waiting, for five minutes while I saw our waiter serve drinks and food to other tables, patiently waiting for my chair. I finally had to flag him down and ask for a chair, again, before I got one. This kind of set the tone for the evening, but I didn't know it at the time.

Finally sitting, we ordered drinks. One of our guests ordered a framboise. That's pronounced \"fram-bwahs\" due to the final E. This is important in a second, so hold on. Our waiter replied \"that's framb-wah.\" My wife, looking embarrassed that our waiter had just corrected our guest, told him that no, it's pronounced fram-bwahs. I know this sounds like a silly thing, but 

1. she's right, and
2. she's had people try to mansplain at her that she's wrong before, which is exactly what this dude was doing. 
3. furthermore, in what universe does a waiter correct a guest's pronunciation, even if they are wrong (which she wasn't)?

Our waiter gave her kind of a funny look when she said that. Okay, maybe he's just tired or just had a rude table or something. Not going to let it bother me.

Hold on, because this is where it gets weird.

That's when he started blowing us off. We had to ask for silverware twice after our food showed up and sat there, cooling, with us unable to eat it. He passed our table six times (six times! yes, I counted!) without even offering to refill our drinks until I finally had to flag him down. When he did bring refills, he brought them for everyone except my wife.

Explain that. I'll wait.

Look, bottom line, I'm still going to go to Yardhouse. In fact, we went back a couple of days after, if only to wash the bad taste out of our mouths. I'm not going to let this one dude ruin it for me. But if I get sat in his section again, I'm going to ask to be moved."}
{"text":"We started off on a bunch of appetizers and thought we'd be able to eat an entree... however we were stuffed from the food before. Yard house always has an awesome ambiance, loud good music and nice food! Our waiter was Andy, and he has been here for quite a few years, I've had him each time. So he is always taking good care of his customers. Nice place to get out of the house and have a drink, listen to good music and hangout."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 stars, just for their 'take out' counter for beer lol.  Located right in the LINQ leading to the High Roller, so quite convenient to get a $5 beer, priced just right to go.

Didn't find their larger size for $11 in a cool tall shape worth it, but hey, it's in a touristy area lol."}
{"text":"A friend & I had an engagement at Town Square, so we decided to stop here first and grab some grub.

Fortunately, the pizza was tasty. And the calamari were done well. 

Oh, and the beer list! They have one long beer list. And they seem to carry all the good labels.

I'm originally from OC, so it was nice to experience a little taste of \"the homeland\" here in Vegasland."}
{"text":"Edit: I'm a terrible person, this update took way too long. A manager reached out to me and made the situation right. I've been back a couple times since and had good experiences. I do love beer, so it's hard to not love Yard House. 

-

It's overall a meh experience. Service can be good or poor, food is OK, happy hour pricing is pretty good. The selection of draught beer is really impressive, and worth coming for alone. 

It's a typical sports bar/grill type setup, large bar in the middle of the space, lots of TVs. It's a fine place to catch a game, but you'll have better luck with food, service and price at a few other places around town.

Last time I was here for HH, we had a table of probably 12 people, with napkin setups for about 9 people. Someone who looked like a manager walked by and asked if everything was going well. I asked for a few napkins for the people at the table that didn't have any (including myself). He walked away and brought back 7-8 tiny cocktail napkins. That was weird, not to mention unhelpful, and a pretty good way for me to sum up my experience there."}
{"text":"Horrible food !!!! I wasn't satisfied with any items that I ordered.. Lacks of tastes.... No flavored.... I'm not going back..."}
{"text":"We come to this restaurant frequently. We like the food, and the service. Usually come for lunch but today we're here for happy hour which is always great. The nachos are very big and tasty. Great selection of appetizers to copse from and all delicious."}
{"text":"No star. The goblet happy hour price is upwards of $6 and would be considered a healthy wine pour (about 6/8 ounces) . Yard House is a business that takes short cuts to get your money and they do an excellent job at it. Btw $9.50 for two Bud Lights. Good job yard house."}
{"text":"Excellent. Excellent. Excellent. Great service, fantastic food, AMAZING DESSERT (Kona coffee ice cream sundae) and a good price for all that we ordered. Super crowded and we has to wait for awhile to get a table, but totally worth it."}
{"text":"Waiter screwed up my order twice, was nearly impossible to flag down to correct it, and he never apologized. I end up leaving without ever getting the sides that were supposed to come with the entree because it would have taken too long, but I was charged for the whole thing."}
{"text":"Visited last night and had a poor experience. We sat at the bar cause there was a half hour wait for a table our bartender was Juan, after ordering drinks we ordered our 1st appetizer, boneless wings with barbecue sauce. What we got was wings in hot sauce so after waiting for someone to check on us they reordered the correct wings only to still come with hot sauce. Juan said at least we are consistent. At this point Jon took over and offered us a free round of drinks only find out at checkout he only gave my girlfriend a free drink and charged for mine. We didn't order anymore food after that. On top of all this an NFL game was on and they kept changing the station. Not cool for a sports theme at the bar. I work near Town Square and have lunch there at least 3 times a week, but I'll be taking YardHouse out of the rotation."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Great atmosphere, impeccable service. Food is so flavorful & fresh. Will definitely come back. Thank you Bobby, you're the best!"}
{"text":"We sat outside for drinks and dinner. Our server, Alan, was very friendly and attentive. The chips and guacamole appetizer was good but skimpy. The pizzas, burgers, and salads were terrific. The turkey burger was exceptional. The evening was very pleasant and I'm sure we will be back soon."}
{"text":"We went to The Yard House on Tatum yesterday and our server, Ryan, could not have been more pefect!  He was friendly and attentive, and... just nice. :)

Each of us tend to order our \"usual\" almost anywhere we go, so the Hubby and Sonny were surprised to find their favorites missing from the menu. Ryan asked the Kitchen if they would still make the dishes, and they did!  And they looked as good as ever. So kudos to the kitchen folks too.  Thank you, Ryan! We'll look for you next time we're there. :)"}
{"text":"Stopped by here on a Sunday night at around 11pm with my group of 5 and were surprised to be seated right away! They also had late happy hour from 10pm-close while we were there so that was a plus! My group ordered a bbq chicken pizza, mac and cheese, spicy tuna roll, poke nachos, blue crab cakes, vampire tacos, and truffle fries. I was able to get a taste of each and would have to say the food was good overall, but I especially liked the truffle fries! Not many restaurants have the skinny type of fries so it good. The poke nachos were also very savory and different. My friend also ordered a martini, but couldn't handle the alcohol so she asked the server and he gladly accommodated by offering her a replacement drink. Service was pleasant, which was surprising coming from a chain restaurant. Overall, would come back for more late night munchies! On a side note, parking could be limited here, but still manageable."}
{"text":"This is a standard yard house. It has a great beer selection, though it usually doesn't include super rare beers. This location had a beer from Utah, Uinta, which was cool. 

I shared the Poke Stack and Fish Taco Plate (includes rice and beans). The food was decent, though nothing exceptional. The Poke Stack had a light wasabi soy sauce and came between a couple wantons. It had a small serving of avocado that was fanned out. This made the avocado on the plate hard to share. The fish tacos were decent, but lacked the flavor I'm accustomed to in San Diego. It could have used something to brighten it up. Perhaps mango pineapple? At any rate, it was lacking that tang that makes fish tacos pop. The beans were also just okay, as was the rice. Actually, the rice was pretty oily. Maybe it was stir fried?  

The service was great: it was prompt, helpful, and polite."}
{"text":"Love the Yard House!  Been coming here since they opened for happy hour during the week. Only recently did I come on a non happy hour time and finally was able to try some other items on their extensive menu. I mean, with food happy hour specials so generous how can you possibly pass up those deals during hh?!  

First on my must try list was the duck wings. They came 5 to an order and were surprisingly filling. Duck is higher in fat than chicken which is why these tasted so good I'm sure! I am a wings fanatic and these were a very nice appetizer.  

Second time I found myself there off peak I tried the roast beef dip sandwich. I'm a beefaholic you see, I often times finding myself having burgers for breakfast and prime rib is my favorite of all steaks. Taste of a ribeye steak with tenderness surpassing filet mignon.... food crack beef nirvana you say?  I agree...so my obvious second choice from the menu phone book was this sandwich. (Crazy big menu)  

It was the best I have had in a long time. It's so tender that dipping into the au just can be messy so I always use a spoon to ladle the au just as I go when I get this sandwich. AMAZING and I'm going back for seconds today...pic to come if I can control myself!

In summary great food during HH and the roast beef dip is amazing...and I feel like I'm missing something.. oh yeah, they have beer on tap :-)"}
{"text":"Been coming here for many years and I can't believe it took until now to write a review. Their menu is crazy extensive ...duck wings, pig candy, bahn mi and more. They have something for everyone. Although they have a gazillion beers on tap their drink menu breaks them into categories and alcohol percentages. Although not on the happy hour menu the duck wings are awesome. You get 5 and they are quite filling since duck has a higher fat content than chicken.  Just took my son here today. He had the burger, i tried it too. Definitely holds its own again zinburger and the like.  They have a large kids menu and the dessert is a rice krispies treat with oreos mixed in. Wow."}
{"text":"Good bar for a chain alot of variety beers, the food is good! The firecracker wings was delicious and the truffle garlic fries is a must!"}
{"text":"It was a decent lunch for this Sunday afternoon. The service was good. It could have been a better experience if they would have refilled my drink when they stopped to ask how we were doing.

Ordered the Ahi tuna appetizer and the Korean BBQ short ribs with rice. Normally they have the jasmine rice on the side when I order this appetizer, but for some reason this time they put the BBQ right over a bed of rice, which I don't mind...however the rice was drenched with the sweet sauce and I had to try to eat the inside of it where it wasn't as drenched. 

The ahi tuna was a good size serving for one person therefore I was full after eating that and just the BBQ beef and small side veggies that was on the plate. 

We also ordered the classic cheeseburger and cup of clam chowder.  That was decent. 

The place was clean! The booth was nice and comfy and clean!"}
{"text":"This was a pretty convenient place to stop and get a bite in the middle of a gambling night at Red Rock Resort. It is very loud inside so I highly recommend getting a table on the patio if you want to have a decent conversation with your dinner guests. 

The menu is huge so there is definitely something for everybody. The beer selection is enormous, wine selection better than decent and of course a full bar to round out your libations.

I had the very tasty organic tomato bisque on my recent visit along with a New York Steak Salad. The salad was more than filling and the steak was cooked to order. The wait staff was friendly and service quick. Just what you need when you're itching to get back to the tables!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love Yard House! The environment is chill and fun. You can choose from a variety of delicious appetizers, entrees, and drinks. I have yet to try something I didn't like. 
It is kinda dark in the restaurant, which may bother some people. Overall, it's a really great for a date or group gathering. Also, at Desert Ridge, there are lots of other things to do after dinner -  you could sit and listen to live music or get dessert. 
Bonus: for beer lovers, you can see their brewing set up. It's really cool! Seriously, give YardHouse a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We came to Yard House after walking from Cheesecake Factory because they said it was going to be a 45 min wait. No thx. Well I'm glad that happened because Yard House was really cool! The environment inside was really nice and trendy. Lol I ordered a fried chicken breast with mash potatoes. It came with cream corn and it was good. We also ordered the lobster crab and artichoke dip and that was really good. I highlight recommend this place. Prices are affordable and it's really good."}
{"text":"There are a few yard house restaurants in la so I am familiar with this restaurant, it was clean service was great and was very nice and new! Will def be back!"}
{"text":"Great place for food. They have a lot of TVs. The staff has always been on point and the selection of beers is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"I went back to the yard house after recieving a gift card from my previous post. Not sure if they knew I was coming but I took the whole family for their happy hour specials. My daughters meal started with dessert first which was a frown since I knew she would not anything else. The fruit bar was great but I wish it would not have came before all the rest of the food. We ordered their massive chicken nachoes which were really dried out-glad they had lots of guacamole to go with it. The onion tower was amazing as always. The sliders were good but the fries were cold. My husband also got the boneless wings which had great flavor but were cold. To top it off I had food stuck to the outside of my glass so that was gross too. I appreciated the gift card because of my comment but I think it would be a bit again before we go back. So werid. Before we only had slow service, this was really werid."}
{"text":"My friends and I stopped in to Yard House last evening for a beer. The restaurant and bar were crowded, but we did snag one seat at the bar. We waited, and waited.....and WAITED, trying to catch the eye of one of the bartenders, to place an order. I finally caught the eye of a bartender; she was intent on the cash register and a pile of receipts in her hand. She looked me right in the eye.....then went back to her receipts -- no \"I'll be with you in a minute\" or even so much as a smile. Long story short, we left, without successfully tracking down a bartender who would take our order.  On the way out, we mentioned to the hostess that we were unable to get served at the bar. She said, \"Oh, sorry about that.\"  (Right there she missed her opportunity to make it right.)  There are MANY wonderful restaurants at Crocker Park with exemplary service -- but this isn't one of them. Customer service is the name of the game, and I'll not drop my money where the service is well below standard.  We walked over to Cheesecake Factory and were waited on by a lovely woman in the bar, and had a great time!  (As info, our group was three middle-aged, very nicely-dressed citizens!)"}

{"text":"House honey blonde is great probably one of my favorites if you like honey beers.  The service was gray they let me try two sample of wheat beer before I bought them.  Also happy hour is a great deal for Monday night football and regular happy hour 3-6pm"}
{"text":"We had a group of eight at ate here on a Sunday afternoon. We were seated immediately. Lots of seating with views of TV's for watching sports. We ordered the nachos for an appetizer because our waitress suggested it as a large appetizer. It was big and just enough for everyone to have some. 

They have a wide variety of beers and cider. They will also bring you a tasting sample if you want to try something. We all had or tasted the pineapple, pear, and raspberry ciders and agreed the raspberry was probably the best of the three. 

Quite a few people got the fish tacos and liked them. I ordered the Korean taco and a carna asada taco. The Korean one was very good. I would not recommend the steak one it was merely okay. 

The highlight of my meal was the side of Brussels sprouts and potatoes. If you like Brussels sprouts this is a must try. I will go back just for this dish."}
{"text":"Our server Cheryl was terrible and so was the hamburger sliders and fries. The bread was hard and the fries were cold. It's really hard to mess up a hamburger and fries which was why we ordered it. Our experience was awful."}
{"text":"Went with a big group last night. Food was very mediocre. Got Vampire tacos, weren't great."}
{"text":"We had a great and decent priced lunch of street tacos. Service was wonderful, our entrees (short rib tacos and vampire tacos) were delicious. Eat here! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Meeting up for a group luncheon. Excellent service by the staff. It's a little cold inside, and would have given 5 stars if it wasn't so cold. My entire table complained about it, but oh well, we just put our jackets on. They served our appetizers before the meal, which was good considering how hungry we all were! The food came out timely and nice and hot! Our orders were correct the first time around which is great because we had about 18 people in our group, so no one was left without. Great place for large groups!"}
{"text":"OK. this location seriously SUCKS. save yourself from going here. The service is absolutely HORRIBLE. I was here this past weekend 3/12 with a group of about 6-7 girls and our server was an older gentleman named \"Chris\". First of all, he had the worst attitude on this planet. We were waiting on a couple girls to join us (they were literally minutes away) and him and his boss (who I don't know his name) kept asking us if they were on their way, after several times of telling them YES THEY ARE PARKING they must of got the hint. It literally took them an hour to bring out our food, we hardly even ordered anything besides appetizers and drinks. My friend ordered a Lemon Drop martini and it was barely filled to the top WITH NO SUGAR around the rim. Was this for a kid, perhaps? Baby size Lemon Drop Martini. I think they finally got it right the second time around...mind you these drinks are not cheap but they sure are cheap as far as the amount they give you. So, we were on a time crunch and finally our food comes out. My pasta was absolutely DISGUSTING. It's like they took the pasta, chicken and threw in a can of some type of creamy sauce. Had no flavor to it whatsoever!! I always order this meal at the Yard House at Red Rock and it's always so amazing. NOT THIS LOCATION. Our server Chris, was terrible. His attitude was so rude, like he was rushing us but as soon as we asked the status of our order he seemed to have tude. It definitely seemed like he hated his job. Don't work in this industry or high pressure environment if you can't handle it. If you're going to work in the food industry and serving people make sure you fix your attitude or take your damn happy pills. This is not the first time I've experience terrible service here. I will never go to this location again. Save yourself time and avoid this place at all cost."}
{"text":"The lack of 1 star is NOT because of the food or help. It is because of the ambiance. 

I was invited here by some fellow foodie friends. The place, although beautiful on the inside, was just so loud. I could barely get a word in, and when I did, I had to scream at the top of my lungs. That's just not my vibe. I would much rather hang out at a more intimate spot where I can socialize normally.

The food and help on the other hand were legit. We had a bunch of different dishes from the menu. The fried macaroni and cheese bites were phenomenal, with the perfect crunch. Dip them in the porcini cream sauce, it's to die for. Some other favorites were the poke nachos (if you're a tuna fan), the onion ring tower (the presentation is super cool) and the Korean boneless wings.
 
It was overall a good experience. The food was fantastic, the help was efficient and friendly, but the overall vibe of the place will probably deter me from going there again any time soon."}
{"text":"Always a wonderful experience coming here. Service is awesome, good is amazing and the atmosphere is classy but laid back and relaxed. The staff remembers you and your preferences. We will always come back!"}
{"text":"Extremely overpriced for extremely nasty food. Great drinks and service but won't ever be back!"}
{"text":"Came in 10/27/2012. Great peeps in here. Wonderful selection of brews. I'll be back for sure. Go Niners!"}
{"text":"Our favorite go to place for Chicken Nachos & Beer.  

We always sit at the bar.  Serve is fast & friendly.  There are TV's everywhere & they will change the channel for you.  We like to watch the hockey games.  

Highly recommend going during happy hour.  They have a very large selection of beer & hard cider.  Their Chicken Nachos are awesome!  Large serving enough for 2. We also enjoy their tacos, chicken wings & onion tower."}
{"text":"Decent food, below average service and high prices. Welcome to Vegas! We sat on the outside patio which was nice, but the noise from inside was unbearable. Thought I should have gone and grabbed my hearing protection."}
{"text":"A beer mecca in the wastelands of Las Vegas. There must be over 100 taps, with every style of beer I can think of. The beer menu is also arranged by style, so that's a plus - I don't have to dig through all the cruft I don't like to find the beer I'm interested in.

Also had the lettuce wrap; it was as good as any I've ever had, anywhere! Good job, folks!

I'll be back next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Nice place.. wish there were bigger TVs.. but had a wide variety of beers on tap.. i even had the half yard glass (32 oz).. try the turkey stacker with the special sauce.."}
{"text":"Great Cajun Chicken Sausage with the Jambalaya!"}
{"text":"The craft beer, cocktail and wine selection is awesome! The bartender...not so friendly or overly helpful."}
{"text":"This has by far been one of the best happy hour menu's.  They have their sliders, pizza's, and popular appetizers at a low price.  Well, if you bring a big group or if you're sharing for 2.  You can get about 3 to 4 dishes for almost $13.00.  

The atmosphere of this place is ok, if you like that fast paced and loud noise ambiance.  It's tolerable, and I have yet to experience bad service.  The servers are quick to get your order, great with drink refills, and the food comes out in less than 20 mins.  (*QUICK NOTE: NEVER EAT HERE, NOT UNLESS IT'S HAPPY HOUR, otherwise you'd be paying $10 - $15 for appetizers and entree's*) 

Things to Order:  
- Chicken Lettuce Wrap - Ground chicken sauteed with diced mushrooms, onion leaves, and spices, served upon a fried wonton bowl accompanied with 8-9 lettuce wraps.  There are three types of sauces, I think regular, mild and spicy?  I'm not too sure on that, but the regular sauce is my favorite.  

- Fried Calamari - Nothing too special, but a definite must have for a vast mix.  The calamari is always fried to a crisp, tossed in a salt a pepper mix served with tartar sauce and a marinara sauce I think?  

- Hawaiian Poke Stack - For some reason the fish tastes very fresh, as opposed to other restaurants who try their hardest to execute a poke dish.  Yardhouse I'd say, prepares it well.  Ahi poke tossed in a Hawaiian style marinade, served upon two wonton crisps with soy & sesame oil bean sprouts and carrots.  

- Onion Ring Stack - An onion tower served with two types of sauces: ranch and chipotle.  I personally like the chipotle sauce.  The onion rings are fried to perfection, the onions doesn't slip out of the fried batter.  

- Chicken Nachos - MMmmMm, a huge plate of nachos served with the toppings of a mexican nacho.  The cheese sizzles when served and the chicken is quite succulent, although the pieces should be chopped up a little more.  

- Spinach Dip - My very favorite, spinach and cheese mixed together in a hot mix (not spicy).  Served with largely cut toasted bread instead of chips!  What's even better, they lightly top the bread with parmesan! 

This a definite must go to if you're having a get together.  The food is good, and so is the experience.  Another pro to this, is that after eating you can go watch a movie.  Since the movie theatre is in fact right across the building."}
{"text":"I use to come here all the time until I moved 30 minutes away. The food has always been great, the drinks are really good as well. Reverse happy hour prices are great! Stopped in today for a quick lunch, the server was amazing I think her name was heather but not totally sure. I was drinking my water very fast and she refilled it every time I was low (probably 4 or 5 times). I tried the clam chowder for a first and it was probably one of the best I've ever had! If you haven't been her defiantly check it out!"}
{"text":"My picks:
Pomegranate Press
BBQ Chicken Salad
Chicken Enchilada Stack
(Mac & Cheese)2

The Mac & Cheese has white truffle oil and applewood smoked bacon.

Their happy hour is the way to go.   Specials on on martinis, beer and select pizzas & appetizers.  Happy hour  from 3-6 p.m. Monday-Friday and reverse happy hour 10 p.m.-midnight Sunday-Thursday.

Consistently a winner.  Its great to take a group because they have such a large menu. Plus their music kicks ass!"}
{"text":"Server was great...  very attentive and checked in on us often which I appreciate.  The food was so-so.  We ordered the Chicken Nachos to start - just ok.  I don't know if I would order them again.  I ordered the Red Quinoa Salad with no brussels sprouts.  Came as I ordered, however, all components were separate in the bowl (not mixed together) so the salad was very disjointed.  It was hard for me to eat it...  just odd.  Server didn't ask if we were interested in dessert before bringing the bill...  we were thinking about it, however, when we received the bill, we just decided to pay and leave."}
{"text":"Seared ahi tuna sandwich was absolutely
Phenomenal. Shouts out to Steven from Queens, the man took care of our big party and did an awesome job. Would go back"}
{"text":"Best place ever! Absolutely love this place. Went there once before catching a flick and just had some beers. The drinks/beer menu is awesome! They offer like 200 different beers! With 2%-10% alcohol by volume! Definitely a fan. Went the second time to actually eat and was definitely impressed again! Their menu has a great big variety and tastes great! Super big fan! It's a bit pricey but well worth it. And my favorite part? They play classic rock music. Hell yeah.  I can def say this now one of my favorite places for drinks and food!"}
{"text":"This is a newer Yard House, a chain of restaurants in 9 states, with the predominate number of locations n Southern California and Arizona. 

Their self described formula is \"Great Food, Classic Rock, World's Greatest Beer Selection\".  

Their beer menu is great, but I doubt it is the best in the world. The Sheraton at LAX is at least as good, and they carry Monty Python's Holy Grail Ale, and the Yard House doesn't. But they have a lot of international choices and US micro brews, including 3 brews by the local AZ brewer from Tempe, Four Peaks. 

The menu is eclectic, and I would describe it as fusion in a casual food sense. The prices are reasonable, but the dishes try too hard and are over the top. I prefer authentic ethnic food true to their origins and regional flavors, not ethnic flavors mixed up with average American fast food ingredients stack high and made pretty as if it was some great inventions, They are not, and consequently the mish mash waters down the experience.  

Hawaiian Poke Stack $5.72. So so, Prefer the real thing. Spicy Tuna Roll $5.82. Again, trying too hard to make it unique. It comes in the shape of a cake. Ginger Crusted Salmon $22.65. Too many flavors and ingredients stacked high to mask mediocre Salmon. Grilled Romaine Salad $8.95. This was pretty good! Mango Sorbet $4.25, 2 large scoops, but low on taste. 

Rolled Dead Guy Ale $3.50. Nice tweener of ale and lager. Four Peak Kiltlifter $5.75, Tasty local version of a good Irish Red.  Gulden Draak $4.00, Another in the great tradition of Belgium beers. 

What the Yard House lacks in taste and quality, they make up in volume and price. In Glendale, this place is very popular, since there aren't many good choices of ethnic food, so this is a good substitute for those who don't care about authenticity, since they may not know it if they ate it."}
{"text":"Egg rolls were amazing.  I especially loved the sauce it came with.
Came here because people swear up and down that their mac n cheese is the best.
Well, not in my opinion. I ended up taking it to go and never even finished it."}
{"text":"The beer selection is amazing. The place is always filled with people . When I went there with my friends. There was 30 mins waiting . The waiting was woth it as they listed a wide variety of beers. The ambience is good.

Coming to food . It was not that intresting. I ordered a chicken dish which was very dry . The fried chicken was fine but not extraordinary."}
{"text":"Your staff is great, however this may be the last time here. What the heck has happened to your food? Ordered the turkey club and it was skimpy and dry. I heard the were big sandwiches, not, just had a bunch of iceberg lettuce to make them thick. Village Pub much better. You're serving a lot of visitors and you should want them to have a good experience with the food. 
Having said all that, your servers and staff are incredible. Our server Chris was phenomenal and everyone there is very nice and professional. I  don't even blame the chef/ cooks. They can only work with what they are given. Corporate needs to step up to the plate."}
{"text":"This chain is one step up from BWW. The truffle fries were under cooked. The guacamole was tasteless and the spicy edamame were not. You have to be drunk to love this place."}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour at Yard House! It's Mon-Fri, 3-6pm and Sun-Wed 10pm-till closing. Pretty good options for food and discounted drinks. Wonderful thing about it, happy hour does not only cover the bar area, it's though the whole restaurant. I love that!
During our visit we had: Four cheese pizza; buffalo wings; spicy tuna roll; calamari. 
The pizza was really good, like REALLY good! Fresh, super cheesy with thin crust. We really enjoyed it. 
The wings were all Mr's. I usually worry when he orders wings because he's pretty choosy. Well the wing nazi was left satisfied. 
The calamari was delicious, it came with two sauces and was in both circular shape and testicles. 
The least enjoyed pick for me was the spicy tuna roll. It's a big layered roll that has no rice and soy beans on the bottom. I did not care for it much because I felt like the tuna was not fresh. It seemed like the roll has been pre-made and left in the fridge for when ever needed to be served. 
The cocktails were great! I had a Hawaiian mule that had a delicious pineapple flavor and a black orchid martini.
The service was really good even though the restaurant was super busy. Our server was fast and attentive.  Our bill was super reasonable too. We had 4 drinks in total (the Hun's had Henny and coke) and 4 apps for about $60. Another bonus? They do not skim on the portions for happy hour! We really enjoyed our meal and will certainly return."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong eating and drinking at yardhouse. Our server was friendly and prompt. We came during happy hour and got the poke stack and the queso dip. The queso was so so goooood. Well made and cheesy :-) I love their happy hour! I go to yardhouse all the time so I'm a big fan."}
{"text":"The three is for the service. Food was a two. When we arrived at midnight on Memorial Day weekend they were already closing the kitchen....strange considering the location. The waitress was fantastic and said she would check to see if she could let us order from the appetizer menu. They staid open for us which was totally cool.... But the food was mediocre at best. The ceviche had almost no shrimp, the  tinga taco was not good, and the pork belly taco was flavorless. We also had a Gorgonzola and pear flatbread ... Again flavorless. Not sure how that happens with something having Gorgonzola. Bottom line, there are much better places for overly prices tourist food!"}
{"text":"We love this place. Always consistent. They always have the largest selection of craft beers and that's why we love this place. Food amazing...but the service is impeccable - way better than the Red Rock YH and the Linq. Although this one is closer to the strip, to me they seem to have a local feel than any of their other Vegas YH. YH is our \"to-go\" date night venues. Shout out to Ali the Super Manager and Marcos for such an amazing and always memorable service!!  WOHOOO!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love yard house and this is a great location inside of the red rock hotel. I have never had a bad experience at a yard house. I love there sliders and house salad a long with a hundred other things. 
They actually have a yard of beer you can order. I am currently sipping on a Cosmo"}
{"text":"Drinks were good. I decided since my cholesterol went up to try their pastrami burger.. A beef burger with pastrami. Bearnaise sauce. Swiss cheese and...an egg! It was pretty darn good. Hubby has Jambalaya and also, great choice. Try it you can't go wrong?"}
{"text":"I decided to give this place another try so when the bestie suggested meeting up for dinner I figured this would be the perfect time since she works right down the road.  We were greeted right away when we walked in and the hostess was able to seat us without any wait.  Our server then came over right away to see if we needed any drinks but he literally came over so quickly we hadn't had time to look over the menu so we just got waters to start.  Once I'd glanced over the menu I decided to go with the Sweet Tart Martini which was a concoction of raspberry vodka, sour apple pucker and tropical punch.  It's hard to go wrong with a mix like that.

For our meal we both decided that burgers sounded good so BFF got the Pepper Crusted Gorgonzola burger and I got the BBQ Bacon burger.  Right after we ordered my martini showed up in all it's turquoise colored glory.  First sip and I was in love.  This thing literally tasted like a sweet tart candy but with alcohol!  Somehow I managed to keep my composure and sip it like a lady rather than chugging the thing like I wanted to.

There was a little bit of a wait for our burgers but it wasn't too bad and we had a good conversation going anyway.  Once they did arrive I was pleased to see that my burger was actually cooked medium-rare as ordered.  I know I mention this a lot in my reviews but a lot of places don't get this right and I like my meat bloody in the middle so it makes me happy when a restaurant can accommodate me with that request.  I was in love with the garlic aioli that came on the side as well!  I was dipping my burger AND fries into that creamy goodness.  All in all I think Yardhouse definitely redeemed itself after my last visit.  The service was MUCH improved and the food was great as expected."}
{"text":"Took them two attempts to get our order right but it was good at the end. 4/5 for the food"}
{"text":"Flavors!!!!  Oh my. Poke Nachos. Spicy and full of flavor. Sashimi. Omg. I wanted to lick the coal clean. 
Fabulous happy hour."}
{"text":"They've got something like 130 taps to choose from so you really can't go wrong with the beer, no matter what your preference may be. The service was pretty amazing as well. The food was on par for what I'd expect out of a spot like this but a little pricey. Really great atmosphere for watching sports."}
{"text":"Darlene is funny and the best Server at this location.  Great excellent service.  She had a wonderful attitude and amazing attention to detail.  Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Awesome selection of beers!  Really great food.  Pricey but worth it!"}
{"text":"I went to the Yard House yesterday on the hunt for Yuengling Lager (out of Pottsville, PA)... Being from the East Coast, it's something you miss when you move out west. See, you can't get Yuengling anywhere west of the Mississippi... My sister swore to god they offered it to her here before... so I called to inquire... and wouldn't you know? They said they had it on draft!! Why didn't I think to check here before? This place features 100 rotating drafts! So my wife and I did some shopping at Fashion Square, all the while I've got this beer on my mind! Finally we sit down at the bar and order 2 Yuenglings! The bartender looks at me and says... \"you can't get that beer anywhere west of the Mississippi... Did you know that's the oldest brewery in America?\" YES I KNOW!!! 

Needless to say, still a cool place!! Still a little pissed I didn't get my beer... but I had a different beer anyway..."}
{"text":"Finally went here for the first time and I love this place.

The server was amazing. Whenever there was a problem she handled it perfectly. Three of the beers my fiancé ordered were out, but our server made sure he was happy and got a beer he liked. 

The food was amazing. Couldn't have been yummier.

The atmosphere was also great. We can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Good location just off the main strip. Pretty decent selection of craft and local draft beers. Limited bottles. The menu is quite expansive so hard to believe you can't find something here to enjoy. Staff was friendly for us on a busy Friday night with about a 15 minute wait. Looks smaller from outside but restaurant is pretty large. Easy to dine at without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"First time going and the truffle burger was delicious. It was also happy hour so got to taste some of the other appetizers like the sliders and the spinach dip. Quite delicious! Will definitely come back and bring friends."}
{"text":"We had heard from several people around town that this was a great place and it did not disappoint!! We decided to give it a try for a late lunch on Saturday. We opted for outdoor seating and were taken to a section completely to ourselves. We ordered the Duck Fat Fries with Bacon and Caramelized Onion Dip - YUM!! We wanted to order a beer but were overwhelmed by all the choices. Our server asked what styles we liked, made recommendations and brought us samples. We loved what we got. We decided to order a couple of appetizers instead of entrees since there were so many things on the menu we wanted to try! I got the Duck Wings and Hubby ordered the Calamari. Both were Outstanding!! I happened to mention that we were celebrating my birthday and our server brought me a Mini Dark Chocolate Souffle that was Divine!! We will definitely be back and next time I will be ordering the Pastrami Benedict!!"}

{"text":"I can't give 4.5 stars, so the food quality and service pushes it to 5. I think the fare is a bit too high priced for the quantity of food, but the quality was outstanding, and the service was excellent. (We were in here late - around 10:30pm on a Sunday night.)

The atmosphere was *great*, it was 101 degrees outside still, but they have those misting hoses around the patio area, and the inside is a beautiful bar, and my date was great!

I would definitely go here again.

Orders: tomato bisque soup, sweet potato fries, and coconut shrimp appetizer."}
{"text":"I ate here from out of town.  We met friends and family and definitely wanted to give this place a 5 star review.  It always seems like these chain places get poor reviews, but many times they shouldn't.  This one deserves a great review.

We had drinks and dinner.  2 young children and one teenager in the party.  They were able to sit us relatively quickly.  From food, drinks, dessert, atmosphere, to service.... all was good.

I would love to come back!"}
{"text":"Located in The Linq on the Las Vegas Strip. To be honest I like the Town Square location better and here is why; I had a coupon that had expired they would not take it, but they took it at the Town Square location. It would have been no big deal for the manager to take it, so I will not be going back to this location. life is too short for bad customer service. Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"Located in Town Square on Las Vegas Blvd. I am a big fan of The Yard House, but an even bigger fan of this particular Yard House. You can read my review of the one in The Linq. There is something on the menu for everyone.The Surf n Turf Burger is a must, it's a burger topped with lobster, that's right kids you read that correctly lobster. Also I should mention a vast array of beer. With reasonable prices great service and an expensive menu, you can't go wrong. So take a break from shopping and enjoy yourselves. Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"Yard house is bad if I could leave a less than one star review I would. One time they gave me a cold grilled cheese and the other time I threw up from food poisoning"}
{"text":"I have been to Yard House quite a few times now and this is the closest location to me. I've definitely had my ups and downs with the chain but my experience is more so on the positive side for this location.

For the most part, the food is pretty good. Majority of the menu (food wise) seems to be reasonably priced and you get what you pay for. I like how they have a slight variety in their menu but still isn't too large of a selection. 

What I ordered was the black truffle burger and chicken nachos. The chicken nachos were delicious! They're served hot on a large plate, have a lot of chicken chunks, and give you both guacamole and sour cream. It's definitely worth ordering for yourself or for the table. The black truffle cheese burger was very flavorful upon first bite. The toppings were placed sloppily and I had to scoop them up from the plate, but it was good! All burgers come with fries (truffle fries for an extra dollar).

The service I received was truly exceptional. I was able to sit exactly where I wanted, and change the channels for multiple televisions so everyone at the table could watch comfortably. The waiter we had was very attentive and was quick to ask if I needed anything. My burger wasn't cooked the way I asked but it wasn't that big a deal for me this time. The waiter didn't wait for a complaint; he asked me if it was what I asked for and didn't hesitate to offer a correction. I appreciated his hard work throughout the night and it made my experience that much better.

I'd be willing to comeback to try and overwrite any negative experiences I've previously had."}
{"text":"I came here w/ my girlfriend and my sister and had a few drinks, though we barely missed happy hour we had a great time. Definately try the bikini tini if you like martinis. I wouldn't recommend the bbq chicken pizza unless you like very strong bbq sauce. The calamari is good, very wide selection of beers. Is a little pricey but definately a great hangout."}
{"text":"A chain that we tend to stop by bc we know we will get an excellent beer. The service was fast & the atmosphere was very chill. We sat at the bar & didn't order food but the beer was cold, flavorful, & wonderful. We will be back again I'm sure."}
{"text":"Great beer, food & atmosphere. We love this place!"}
{"text":"Busy, busy, busy. When you finally get a seat, all is good. At the bar, its easier to ask for a tiny taster if you're curious about a beer. Very thorough beer selection. Bartenders amazingly keep up with the avalanche of orders, in addition to taking care of us.

In and outdoor seating. Can use station points to pay your bill."}
{"text":"Where you go to have a good drink list and good happy hour food. I had bad experience here today, it was once out of many great services. Unfortunately it's the one I'll write about.. 

When your server is inattentive, fine, for the happy hour I'm willing to take a minor hit on service because its so busy here. Then your server gets the order wrong, it's alright, mistakes happen. However, she comes back at the end of the meal still have the audacity to circle out tips to make sure her mediocre leg work is paid for.. Just wow..."}
{"text":"Food is great but the hostess Michelle was rude and not accommodating. It must just be her attitude because I heard her on the phone with a guest and she was rude to them as well.
When the hostess is rude right when you walk in it tends to ruin the initial impression."}
{"text":"Was just there a few hours ago with a friend in town. We sat outside on the upstairs patio and the view was nice, the staff was helpful enough, and everything we ordered was pretty good. (Ceviche, Hawaiian Poke stack, The Baja Fish tacos, and a burger.) 

We wanted something familiar but new so we chose The Linq location! Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Came with a party of 14 for dinner on a busy Friday night in April at 7:00pm. We had two servers, both were great. Ashley serviced our end of the table and she did a great job, we had three kids in our party and the other server thoughtfully took their orders first since the adults were chatting over drinks and appetizers. We were celebrating a birthday and the other server brought out the birthday cake our party brought and Ashley gave us plates and a knife to cut the cake and boxed it when we were done. I'd been to Yard House at Town Square before, and it delivered the same great experience - sports on the multiple tvs, packed restaurant and bar, knowledge staff and great service. 

I give it two stars because my dinner entree was incredibly disappointing. I ordered the cilantro lime shrimp with tabouleh salad and will be honest, I was expecting a more substantial portion for $16.00. What I was served however, was five shrimp, a smear of hummus underneath the shrimp and a large scoop of tabouleh salad over two mid-sized romaine leaves. The (luke-warm) shrimp was very tasty and the chilled salad was fresh, but the five shrimps on the plate were not prawns, they were medium-sized shrimp and I was not expecting there to only be five of them. I was famished and this was not the dinner entree I had expected. 

Quite frankly, I would have expected such an \"artful nouveau\" $16.00 rectangular-plated item at a different type of restaurant, not at a loud sports bar type joint. (See my picture)

Next time I will stick to their large Cobb salad or Turkey burger with a cup of soup. 

Or I wont come hungry or skip the appetizers."}
{"text":"Tons of beers on tap and bottled. Yes, it's at the mall and the patio consists of watching the valet people, but the amount of beers and tvs do make this one of the few larger sports bars in Old Town.  The food is good and there is a huge variety.The only annoying thing is they play music during games instead of the audio for them."}
{"text":"Always a great place to watch a game or meet friends for drinks and bites. Party of 2 we got sat immediately and they took our order. Service was great and several people served the table all on top of refills and checking on our food. The pear cider was crisp and paired well with their carne asada street tacos. You can get the meal or do a la carte up to six. They are a good size and two was enough."}
{"text":"I. LOVE. YARDHOUSE. One of my only few favorite chain restaurants (the other being Cheesecake Factory). I have not ordered anything here that I did not like.

My usually go-to is their truffle Mac N Cheese. Awesomely gourmet and cheesy. Comes in two sizes (reg and large), go with the regular. Will fill you up just fine.

Good news for vegetarians: an abundance of veggie options here! They even offer a tofu-based meat substitute \"chik'n\" in pastas or sandwiches. One of my fav veggie items are the CHIK'N WINGS - offered in three sauces. Opt for the Jerk sauce! A yummy, tangy, Asian dip!

Heads up that their Asian dishes will be very \"Americanized\". Example - their California Roll is NOT your ordinary sushi roll. It is one giant cake! I have ordered this dish with the rice slightly hard a few times, so I don't take my chance anymore. 

One of Vegas' better elections of beer. Everything from wheats, amber, IPA, ciders. Truly something for everyone! My favorite? Watermelon Wheat.

Lastly, no cell connection here!! I dunno if this is a clever way to get people off their phones as they dine. They offer a Yard House guest wifi but it's as good as no connection at all. Couldn't even check into Yelp in here!"}
{"text":"We came here this Friday night for happy hour and from start to finish, the experience was great. They were packed full at 5:30 but we found two spots at the bar. The bartender was great! I can't recall her name but she had reddish hair and think it might have started with a \"B\". Right from the start she started asking about our daughter and to see pics as she saw our screen saver. Super sincere and then helped us out with the menu. All of the cocktails were good and she was happy to get us a taster of the beer we were looking at. On top of being prompt what impressed me most (as a previous restaurant manager) is that when we ordered our Bbq pizza she reminded us that it came with onions and cilantro and confirmed that would be okay. It's Such a simple question but those are such common items that get dishes sent back, she was smart enough to be proactive and ask. We like them both but just the question impressed me. Food was all great, especially the poke nachos, but service made this experience stand out."}
{"text":"Very friendly wait staff!!!!!
Really good drinks, with a very large beer selection
Great atmosphere 
Lots of tvs with all sorts of sports on
The downside....
     The food!!!
Very, very small portions at very high prices for what you get!!! There were 5 of us, we each tried something different,  but I know at least 2 of us stopped at McDonald's on the way home just to fill up!!!  I could go through and give you what was wrong with each of my friends orders but I will save you time by stating we all left hungry, and none of us will be back except for drinks and games on tv...."}
{"text":"Great customer service when at table, but unfortunately really long waits on the weekend- luckily, lots of beer on tap. Food is all fresh and delish. Truffle fries, enough said."}
{"text":"This is the best Yard House location I've been to! Amazing service, great food, and such a fun location. Great stop at the LINQ!"}
{"text":"Chicken nachos were pretty good. I like the Mac & cheese."}
{"text":"This place redefines what to expect for bar food. The first time my boss suggested this spot for a work lunch I was disappointed. Vegas has so many great options. Why would I want to eat bar food? I was wrong because the food is good, not just average bar food.

The lunch specials are very tasty and accommodate a lunch hour at a reasonable price. My favorite combination is the 1/2 Roast Beef Dip with a salad. Diet splurge meets healthy. My favorite appetizers are the Onion Rings and Chicken Nachos. When we come here for work dinners the Mac & Cheese with truffle oil is a favorite for several of my coworkers. The burgers are also really good, loaded with toppings and very juicy.

The menu is huge and has something to accommodate all tastes. Great spot to take a picky friend. This is obviously a great spot for beer lovers since they have so many beers on tap.

This particular location has a lot of outdoor seating which is a great option on a nice day. The patio is in the center of the shopping center for plenty of people watching entertainment."}
{"text":"I always think of Yard House as more of a bar, that it is easy to forget how amazing their food is!!

My whole family went for dinner the other night and were overwhelmed by the amount of choices on the menu! Seriously, definitely something for everyone here, no matter what food-mood you're in.

We ended up with an assortment of different types of food - salmon, pineapple chicken, pork burger, fish and chips - and honestly everyone was super happy. Really fresh and delicious. Plus lots of drink options for those of us not driving! 

We will absolutely be back!!"}
{"text":"Always great service, great food and an amazing beer selection. You can never go wrong with the Yard House. Gwen is an amazing server , ask to sit in her section! Try the surf and turf burger, it's amazing."}
{"text":"I use to come here all the time. I won't be back. Tonight a girl was saving 4 seats at the packed bar while she was waiting for a table. Her friends never arrived before her table was ready. We tried to explain we were actually going to eat at the bar but the bartender and management didn't care so we took our business elsewhere.

Hope it was worth it losing out on paying customers for friends that never showed up."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food, and great service. I got the lobster and crab dip which was amazing and then for my entree I got the southern fried chicken which was absolutely delicious. I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Good food and service. Great place to eat at with friends and family. Fast service and a great place to watch the cavs play. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"My favorite Friday night spot. Love the food, especially the Gardein options, great variety of beers, and excellent service."}
{"text":"Everyone should know that this reatruant does not honor the hotel advertised specials or discount cards. They say they are not owned by the hotel. After the Mgr heard I was Yelping about tho he came over and honored the discount. Not sure if you will receive the same treatment. Ask first. Food and service was good."}
{"text":"After walking up/down the promenade, riding the high-roller, we wanted to grab a drink and some food.  This place was the closest, so we stopped in.   The place is huge, and didn't seem crowded.  We sat in the bar area, at a big industrial table - very cool.  

Amazing beer selection - amazing!  

Food portions were large and better than average bar food.  Price was average, service was friendly.   I'd for sure go back."}
{"text":"Do not go here if u r a local. No late night Happy Hour. Even though they do have them at other locations. And the management does not seem to care about us locals. 
Go to the other locations instead of u must. 
And the bartender didn't even know what beers he had on tap that day. Isn't that what a preshift meeting is for. I guess they don't do that either here."}
{"text":"I have never had a worse Sunday lunch in my life. Every facet of this establishment is lacking. Server made me wait 25 unapologetic minutes for a basic tap beer. My chicken tenders are an absolute disaster. I'm sad to say that I'm never coming back."}
{"text":"Stopped in to get a QUICK appetizer, unfortunately  there was nothing quick about it. Waiting 15 minutes for someone to scoop some hummus in a bowl is a little more than I wanted to wait. While our sever kept checking to see where it was our drinks were empty. I had to cancel the hummus even though I was starving only to have the sever show it to me on my way out and asked if I still wanted it. I did still want it! Where would you like me to eat it if I'm leaving????! I have served tables for a while and I would NEVER let this happen. I WON'T be back."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere. Might see a local celeb. Great chicken strips and beer selection. Try the rasberry lambic blend beer. Mmmm"}
{"text":"Came here for a show in Vegas and was glad to have stumbled upon this place.

If you are looking for a buzzing gastropub in Vegas, don't miss out on the Yard House!

Pros:
- Ability to accommodates large parties (we had about 20 people)
- Good selection of alcoholic drinks and brews for beer lovers
- Tasty assortment of finger foods and small plates for sharing
- Opens late so great place for hanging out 
- Centrally-located off the Las Vegas strip opposite to Caesars Palace on the Flamingo-LinQ-Harrah's side
- Good service, attentive staff and reasonably-priced fare

Cons:
- Extremely noisy and lively environment (could be a Pro)
- Expect long wait time (We waited for about 40 min before being seated)

All in all, a good place to come when in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place was really good I have now been twice and both times service and food did not disappoint. The first was date night on a Saturday night it was really busy but great. We had ahi nachos and they were so good after dinner we had to have a second for dessert. I ate the filet it was really good. My husband had a few different tacos no bad either. 
The next trip we took here included 9 of us 5 kids and 4 adults. We had an increasingly waiter and the food was great. This time we had ahi steak it was wonderful. The only complain was my husband got spicy rice and it was not very spicy.
I tried the Tahitian Moonshine drink. This is what came in it. 
Firefly white lightning moonshine, licor 43, citrus agave, fresh pineapple & strawberry, ginger ale, orange bitters
I'm not a huge drinker but this one drink knocked me on my butt. Tasted great."}
{"text":"Very crowded yet very fast service. Chicken avacado sandwich was great. Beer prices a rediculously high."}
{"text":"They serve fun beers and happy hour is nice.  Good beer, lots of tables and late. 

The food is really high in calories I am not sure they have any healthy options.  Every thing seemed to be 1000 calories half your intake and honestly their food is not work half your daily calories."}
{"text":"how many beers on tap again? WOW!

--anyplace that takes 75 feet to enter, walkway flanked on one side by windows looking at keg after keg of beer on tap, the other side by open view of the kitchen has my vote. i don't care that it's a chain. get me some of that!
--very very busy at happy hour and in evenings.
--great service. always friendly, efficient and few details missed.

Don't miss:
--spicy tuna roll
--steaks (send it back if it's not to your liking, it'll be RIGHT the second time)
--beer samples
--grilled cheese; ask for avocado and basil.
--great french fries!"}
{"text":"X Mas Dinner with the Broken Dagger tattoo Crew. The best bartenders ever. Love being a regular here. Shoutout to Nate, Kat, Dave, Andrew, Clarence and everyone else! Brett is a great server as well!"}
{"text":"The Yard House is a chain, and most Yard Houses have decent food, but not all Yard Houses have Kilkenny beer! Not since I lived in Strasbourg, France, and frequented The Irish Times bar, where I would often drink this tasty brew, have I seen Kilkenny anywhere. I've been searching for it on US soil for years, and have come up empty handed. Not for lack of trying, mind you. Distributors just don't sell it here. But the Yard House on Charleston, at the Red Rock Casino has it! It's a miracle. I've been to other Yard Houses, with no luck. This is the only one. So if you've been searching for this beer, like me, this is the place for you to go. Plus the food is pretty good, and the Red Rock Casino is one of my favorites in the valley. Go play a game of Bingo. It's one of the best deals around!"}
{"text":"HAPPY HOUR. If you're looking for happy hour just stop reading and start driving now. I've been to their happy hour twice now after loving the food the first time. Initially I was going to give 4 stars for amazing deals and food but a continually missing waiter. The second time I went I probably had the most pleasant waitress I've encountered in years so now Yard House is golden in my eyes. I believe her name was Nicole? 

She started off by asking us if we had been there / what kind of beers we liked / if we had tried any on the menu. She then asked us if we wanted her to pick out two samples she thought we might like which I thought was such a nice gesture. The two she picked for my roommate magically happened to be two of the ones she had been wanting to try so she's apparently got a knack for reading people. She was the perfect amount of attentive yet not overbearing and genuinely friendly instead of the creepy \"what can I get you honey?\" *rests hand on shoulder* thing I hate. 

We ordered the chicken nachos and spinach dip. Honestly the nachos are MASSIVE and only $7. Best. Deal. Ever. Both were delicious and, as much as I want to try new things, they were so good I can't not order them. Struggles. I'm usually a snob against chain restaurants but Yard House is worth a try. (Additionally they have a round up for charity option which melts my heart.)"}
{"text":"Despite being a chain, I am a huge fan of Yard House. Specifically at the Town Square location, which always seems to be busy, because of the best atmosphere. There is option for outside seating which is perfect for summer nights and is often times accompanied with misters to cool you down. 

YH is always a safe choice for an outing location because the food does not disappoint and neither do their drink options. They have a very large selection of beer (if you like cider or just don't feel like drinking a beer/cocktail, try the ace pineapple cider or Stella cider) and even better -- they have great happy hour times! 

Their daytime happy hour is 3 to 6pm. Late night happy hour begins at 10pm until they close. Happy hour here includes a wide range of both food and drink options for a fraction of the price. Unlike some other restaurants, Yard House's happy hour food options are desirable and the portions/prices are reasonable as well. 

Give Yard House a visit if you are looking for a drink and a small bite, or just a full on dinner! This place is versatile. :)"}
{"text":"What a great atmosphere they have and their food is also affordable. We love going there on weekends. A great place for locals too and also a good place to watch a sports game on their tvs"}
{"text":"Went here for a work dinner and had an enjoyable time. The atmosphere was relaxed and comfortable and I enjoyed my cocktail and fried mac and cheese appetizer. I'd rate higher but the 4 cheese pizza I ordered was bland and unsatisfying."}
{"text":"My husband and I did a date night here. The drink selection is amazing here. However, the mixed drinks were way over priced. They were prices comparable of an airport and that was disappointing. The food was ok but definitely nothing extraordinary. We had pizza and a Cobb salad. Again, so overpriced for what it was. The atmosphere is good but it is confused to whether it's a bar or a higher end nice place out. I felt more as though it's like Applebees, a little nicer but way more expensive. We definitely won't go out of our way to come here, but I am open to going back if I'm in the area. It used to be one of our favorite places but with the price spike it's just not worth it."}
{"text":"When we found out that the movie we wanted to see at camelview was sold out and it was another hour before the next showing, we decided to hit up yard house for a quick beer and maybe an appetizer. 

There wasn't much of a crowd so we sat at the bar right away. We ordered our beers and the bartender asked for our Id's (which I don't mind) but this guy literally leaned across the bar really really close to look my wife in the eye and compare her to the photo on the ID, it was really uncomfortable. He even stated that it was fine but continued to give a suspicious look. Now I have a job where I look at Id's all day long, some people don't photo well but she looked the exact same on her id as she did sitting there. After that he demanded a credit card to start a tab, since we were in a hurry we just asked to pay for it now so that we could leave when we were finished and when we put down cash it just seemed like it wasn't good enough for him. He was just a strange man. 

We also ordered the chicken tenders, and I just wasn't that impressed with it. I have had the pastrami sandwich there many times and love it, but the honey mustard tasted funky and the chicken just tasted like the oil it was fried in, almost no flavor. The food was fine though we ate it and still made our movie showing. Just the experience with the bartender made it an awkward experience."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere so-so food.  Service was very good and attentive but the meals didn't live up to that same standard."}
{"text":"I likey truffle fries.  Otherwise it's a little to bar sceney for me. Very loud.  The food is good though."}
{"text":"I was always kind nervous to come to yardhouse. In my mind I kept comparing it to millers which is pretty basic. I got a gift card for my bday and decided wth. They have a huge selection of both drinks and food. The food is American but they do put a twist on almost everything on the menu. My hostess Brittany was so funny and sweet. Got me and my lil family into a booth with close to the patio view. James our server was super patient and checked in with us regularly refilling my water, God knows I'm thirsty, and making sure everything was kosher. We ordered the chicken nachos and holy guacamole. Literally. unless there is 5 or 6 of you prepare to share your next meal, the nachos are huge and I wasn't lying there is guacamole, a good ol' scoop right in the center. My man got the Cali rueben which he had to take to go lol. The nachos were so huge. And I had the lamb burger which was amazing. I only ate half and I'm actually eating the other half now. My step son got the kids pizza. Loaded with cheese and with fries. He ate half. He was also full from the nachos. Lol"}
{"text":"I don't drink so I can't comment on the beers....that being said the porcini crusted halibut was out of this world. The halibut was firm and the porcini mushroom sauce complimented the halibut and Parmesan smashed potatoes. Not fancy but delicious!!"}
{"text":"My friend brought me here for dinner after we went on the High Roller which it is right next to. I don't eat a lot of meat, but I really wanted a filet mignon for dinner - pretty much the only meat I order if I'm going to have dinner at a nice restaurant. For the price of around $22 for a petite filet mignon I wasn't expecting much, as I've had more than my share of filet throughout the years.

I'm a weirdo though liking my meat well done, but after hearing a million people say you can't do that to a filet, I've been ordering it medium-well for close to 10 years.
Appetizers & salads were great, service was prompt & my friend had her water glass refilled about 5 times haha. They were very accommodating with substitutions for sides and bringing us extra lemons for our water.

The first time my filet came out it was barely medium, so it was sent back & when it came out the 2nd time it was very well done. Although I was disappointed in this, they took it off my tab & I ate it. I could tell it was a very high quality piece of meat, even though it was well done. Definitely much better than I was expecting, & rivaled meat quality at places I'd paid twice as much for.

I barely had room for dessert, but if there's one thing I love for dessert it's creme brulee, which they had. It was different with chocolate on the bottom & candied bananas on the top, but very delicious. Everything else about the food & experience was wonderful and I will definitely plan on coming back & trying again the next time I visit the area. :)"}
{"text":"First visit to the Yardhouse on a non-home game Sunday...

Surprised at how much business they had at 3 in the afternoon but also encouraged by it.  This must mean the place is pretty good, right?

We started with two beers out of the 120+ they have on tap.  I had one of the Oktoberfest selections, the Beirweisen, which was light, earthy, and very tasty (especially with a squeeze of lemon).  The Main Man simply had the house Hefeweisen and reported it to be nutty, full bodied, and smooth.

We sampled some nachos (of course we did, the MM has to have nachos if they are on the menu) and they were very good, just about like we make 'em at home!  Momma had to dive in and swim around in the lobster, crab, and spinach dip... So much so that she cordoned off half the order and declared it would be placed atop her order of (Mac n Cheese)2... And really, I can't blame her, it was good shit!

You know what Momma ate for lunch and all I can say is that she gave me her rolling eyeballs and strange chewing smile that I think might be the same face she gives up during an orgasm.  So while its nice to know she enjoys the food, it's disconcerting at the same time.  

MM had the burger with green chili and pepper jack and it was very, very, very good!  How can one go wrong with a whole, firm, grilled Hatch green chili sitting atop lean Angus on a fall day?

I had the Surf n Turf burger sans bun and I think I'm happy I eschewed the bun.  The asparagus is the perfect compliment to the full sized chunks of crab and lobster sitting on the Angus like a beauty queens crown!  

Our server was friendly, warm, and polite.  She made sure we never wanted for anything... Thank you!

Unfortunately, we were too stuffed to even ponder desert, but we will be back and their molten lava cake is firmly in my sights!"}
{"text":"I just wanted to express my gratitude for Trés. He is hands down one of the most brilliant waiters I've ever been served by. He took such great care of my wife and mother in law. He truly wanted to make our dining experience memorable. I was particularly struck when my wife and I made a joke about not liking cilantro. After taking our order, he came back a few minutes later, remembered that I had said I hated Cilantro and told me that he had told the chef to not include cilantro in my dish, without me even telling him. Thanks so much Trés."}
{"text":"Usually the only time I ever come here is if I'm waiting for friends to arrive to watch movies and I decide to grab a drink and appetizers or during happy hour.

Food: The foods alright, yard house isn't really known for their food mostly for their wide range of beers. I've never eaten and entree but this place is pretty pricey. I usually grab a snack like Shrimp Ceviche or chips salsa and guacamole.

Drinks/Beer: Yard house is known for its alcohol, I've never tried one of their specialty drinks but I'm not much of a mixed drink girl. BUT the BEER oh the beer, wow they have a lot to choose from every time I go I try to get something different. They even have yard house craft beers. 

Customer Service: The service was nice our waitress was sweet but the place was kind of rowdy. Even for afternoons or evenings, so if your planning to have a romantic dinner don't go here. 

Happy Hour: The happy hour here is pretty decent, its from Monday - Friday 3pm - 6pm Sunday - Wednesday 10pm - Close half off pizza's and appetizers are the best part and the drinks"}
{"text":"Yard House is one of my favorite restaurants. The service is great and their food is very delicious. I love the atmosphere of the restaurant. Would highly recommend to anyone looking to enjoy a good meal without missing a sports game. I recommend getting there early since it gets really busy. Sometimes the wait time can be anywhere from 25 minutes to 2 hours. But trust me when I say it's worth the wait. Call ahead to see what the wait time is!"}
{"text":"We ended up at Yard House because the silly Blue Martini Lounge does not allow camouflage shirts. Frankly, I am glad we ended up at the Yard House because they are one of the most consistent chain restaurants in the business. Plus, they have a 100+ beers on tap which is pretty darn cool. The staffs are usually fast and attentive. 

If you like a menu with a lot of variety I definitely think you'll like this place. The menu offers American food, Mexican food, Italian food and some Asian Fusion selections. I ordered the chicken enchiladas and it was very delicious. The combination of the green and red sauce on it was amazing. The street tacos there are also fun to eat and share as an appetizer. I also recommend the beer sampler. 

All in all, the food is also consistent along with their customer service. It's also a great location to catch a game or if you just want a quick drink at the bar. I will definitely be back for another round. Thanks, Yard House Town Square."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. I don't care for chain restaurants - and you'd never know Yard Houses are affiliated with the same company that manages Red Lobster.

Great beer selection, food options, and service. I love that you can eat late here - great for Vegas hours.

I have so many favorites here. Clam chowder, duck fat fries, jambalaya, Miso sea bass, orange chicken, Turkey pot pie, macadamia nut crusted Mahi Mahi, all of the street tacos, medium rare rib eye with broccolini, many of the Asian dishes with bok choy and jasmine rice - and plenty of desert options too! 

I'm not sure I've been to a restaurant where I can choose from so much and be pleased with every option."}
{"text":"Great experience! My food was amazing , I ordered the Lobster Garlic Noodles. The portion was huge and full of seafood! The service was great, Nick was our server who offered great customer service!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for beer selection + happy hour, this is definitely the place.  You really have to get here early for happy hour b/c after 5 or so it gets REALLY hard to get a table.  The app and drink specials are good.

We've been here a few times and feel so-so about it.  We were looking for a cheap HH close to home so we went to try some new things.  Upon walking in, we saw a couple sitting outside with a little wooden stand holding 6 samples.  We asked our waiter about it and it's their \"six pack\" which contains six samples pre-chosen by them for about $9.  We tried it and I liked more of them than my husband as he generally likes lighter beers and I tend to like amber ales.  I would order it again - it's fun to mix it up and try some new beers and ciders.  Plus, they give you a sheet with the name, origin, and brewery of each selection.  I asked for two samples of other beers and my husband asked for one.  We didn't really care enough for them to order a pint.  

We also had the egg rolls and jerk wings.  The egg rolls were good, but not great and the wings were a little disappointing.  You know what's even more disappointing?  Getting the bill and seeing a $1 charge for each sample that we asked for.  Seriously?  For a few sips to try them out before ordering a whole pint which would have been in the ballpark of $3?  Our server didn't even mention it when we ordered them.  It's really just the principle.  Not cool Yard House!  They should take a lesson from Papago Brewing where they gladly will give you a free sample to help you decide on a brew."}
{"text":"We are huge fans of YardHouse. This was very disappointing. The food was cold and lacked salt. We usually always go to the TownSquare location and thought we would try it at the Red Rock location instead. The fries were cold twice and the rice bowl my husband got needed salt and the rice was over cooked. We will go to YardHouse again just not this location."}
{"text":"Horrible experience here. I came with my husband and friends after have no a great time the previous night. Tonight we came as a party of four. We had 3 drinks among 4 of us. At the end of dinner service our server came to take our card. While waiting, another waitress (not our server) said we had to leave because \"I was sleeping\" at the table. (I was not sleeping at the table.) Seriously out of  four of us, only 3 of us had drinks (one each) in 1.5 hours time; she accused us of being drunk.  It was extremely insulting. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Everyone needs to know about the red quinoa salad. Add blackened shrimp and it's literally my favorite meal in the world. I'm a salad lover so this is saying a lot for me! My server today was Todd W. and he was exceptional! I took up a booth to myself and he didn't seem to mind at all. He was attentive to my needs and checked if the cheese was pasteurized (it was not, so that was helpful) thanks Todd!"}
{"text":"Yard House is a solid upscale sports bar chain.  There are dozens of TV's around the restaurant insuring that there's a view of whatever game you'd like to see.  I've had nothing but great service on every visit.  The food is good, albeit a bit overpriced.  Also; with more than 100 beers on tap to choose from, the alcohol selection is unbeatable.  On general principal, I have never had the same beer twice at Yard House.

The service really does set the place apart.  On a visit sometime last month, the turkey burger my wife ordered came out as turkey sliders and covered in some bizarre she didn't want to eat.  After taking it back and making countless offers for more fries or anything else to hold her over while she waited for another to be cooked, the turkey burger was unexpectedly taken off the bill.

Yard House is perfectly located in the \"food court\" area of Desert Ridge.  It's just a few convenient steps from the AMC, making it a good spot to eat before or after a movie.  It feels like a bonus if I'm seeing a movie at time that lets me take advantage of its happy hour.  The only things I don't like about Yard House is the food is a bit pricy for what it serves.  It's really just fancy sports bar food and some standard american restaurant meals.  Yard House also gets packed quickly.  Arrive during typical dinner hours (especially on Friday or Saturday) and you better expect a long wait."}
{"text":"125 beers on tap is awesome.  Not putting the prices of said beers on the menu is not.  The food is also really good, but food prices are also very high.

That aside, Yard House is a pretty cool place to grab a drink or a meal.  It's big and spread out and rarely feels as crowded as the rest of the bars in Fashion Square Mall. There's also dozens of TVs set up around the place, making it a good place to catch a game.

We had a send off for a coworker on Saturday night.  It was a big group, and the servers did a great job.  We took up a big table and three or four booths.  The solution...  They arranged a letter and number system with each of us, which allowed us to order drinks and food separately throughout the night, and it gave us a stronger guarantee that there wouldn't be a mistake on our tabs.  It was the letter of our waitresses' first name, and the order which we were served.  They wrote it down for us on piece of paper.  Even the drunkest person in the group couldn't get it wrong."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite chains.  This location is super busy based on location at the casino.  The service was descent.  The food was a bit below what I have had at other locations.  And my biggest minus of a star is we never saw the same person at our table to wait on our table twice."}
{"text":"Great location with multiple options for seating. Have bellied up to the bar, ate on the patio and also inside at a table. Biggest plus, as with any Yardhouse,  is the extensive draft list. There is also an abbreviated selection of beers at a walk up window outdoors. Food is above average. Service was quick and attentive. Great place to pregame prior to concerts at the Brooklyn Bowl."}
{"text":"Yardhouse never disappoints me, no matter which city I am in. I had the poke stack and Korean short rib taco for an amazing late night dinner. Just the right amount of sweet and salty.

The fresh and skinny cocktails are also delicious, especially the juniper fusion. 

The best night to come here might be Tues or Wed...this location gets new beer on Tues, and the late night happy hour is Sun-Wed (10-close). 

As far as service, our waiter, Celal, had the timing down perfectly."}
{"text":"Went to Yard house with my visiting mother-in-law, she's a little \"direct\" sometimes so I'm always a little worried how the server is going to react. Seth was our server and I have to say I have never had a better, more fun server since living in Vegas! Even with the mother-in-law laying it on a little thick, he was extremely accomidating and pleasant. Actually wanted to let the manager how good this guy was. The food is always good but the service was outstanding!"}
{"text":"The food is kind of pricey.   Beer selection is excellent.  I like the patio but the tacos made me sick.  Don't think I'll be going back for food just drinks..."}
{"text":"It's an okay place for lunch if you've been shopping and want something nicer than the food court. I'm guessing it would be a fun to head there for game day or a late happy hour too.

Obviously, the beer menu is huge and most of them are pretty good. There are a lot of food options on the menu - I LOVED that any of the burgers could be ordered as a veggie burger. My boyfriend and I each had really great veggie burgers (I got a classic one, he got a fancier themed one and said it was good) and a ton of French fries. The food is pricey, but it tastes like it is worth the quality. 

Here's where they lost stars: 1, the inside of the restaurant smelled like something I can't even describe. Like sewage, but worse. I don't know if they were having a plumbing issue the day we went or what. If there hadn't been an outdoor table available we would not have stayed. 2, we had a waitress who was training another girl, and they were not the most efficient team. We had two servers, you'd think at least one of them would have remembered a side we ordered or brought us our check without us having to ask for it after they cleared the plates and seemed to forget us. I know training can be difficult, but they seemed to be slowing each other down. 

I'd go back, but I would sit outside again (just in case) and pray to the restaurant gods for a solo veteran server."}
{"text":"Came in on a slow Thanksgiving Eve afternoon for a few beers and to watch a game.  Jocelyn, my bartender was very friendly and attentive.  Enjoyed the Woodchuck Pumpkin Cider as well as their House White Ale and a Hoegaarden.   Lobster dip was also good, with plenty of pitas and chips to dip.  So why only three stars?  Unfortunately it is due to poor customer service from management. 

I politely asked Jocelyn if I could have the tv above the bar turned to a college hoops game as there was no one on my corner of the bar.  She was happy to ask the two managers working on the tap system to change it for me.  They both told her they were busy with the taps and \"she could do it if she wanted to.\"   I'm not a brewmaster so I have no idea how many white shirts it takes to fix a tap system but I am familiar with proper customer service and that's not it.  
I politely waited 40 minutes (the entire first half of the game) to inquire again.  Jocelyn apologized saying she had thought management had gotten to it.  She asked once again and 30 minutes later....still nothing.  I eventually just moved to a table in view of a tv showing the game.  Not a huge deal but certainly annoying.   Hence the minus two stars."}
{"text":"Amazing selection of beer not to mention the bar staff. Very very good. Truffle fries are worth it. Highly recommended - look for Kelsee or Alison the bartenders."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed Yardhouse in the past, however, my most recent encounter with one of the managers, Leo, has really affected my overall experience and opinion of this restaurant. 

Leo informed my group of friends sitting at the bar that one of my friends would have to leave if she couldn't sit still. It was her birthday and I will be the first to admit she was slightly intoxicated... I would understand if my friend spilled a drink, broke a glass, screamed obnoxiously, or literally fell over in her chair which she did not. She. Did. Nothing.

My friend was a little tipsy and the manager was quick to judge. I understand that if someone at a bar seems intoxicated it is a liability issue, however, I feel there could have been more professional and polite verbiage used to relay that message. This was not the the case. 

Leo was cold and came off rude. The group I was with were all surprised and shocked because as I said earlier, the friend we were with by no means was acting obnoxious or creating a scene. I asked for the man's name who happened to be the manager and he told me it was Leo. He also tried to grab his business card and realized he didn't have one with him. He didn't offer to retrieve one for me either.

... I get it. Working in the restaurant industry I know there are a lot of difficult and intoxicated guests to deal with (I've been a server back in the day myself) however, there is also a thing called empathy and delivery which goes a long way. I don't work in the restaurant industry anymore but I do work in guest service management. The manager could have asked politely what he would have liked to occur, but that didn't happen. I hope Yardhouse management improves because I actually really liked that place. My interaction with Leo really bothered me (still does). 

Mitch, a bartender working at the time tried to defend Leo and didn't show empathy as well. He event spelt his name out for me because he was very confident in defending why I was wrong to feel offended with my interaction with Leo. Not sure if Mitch understands what the interaction consisted of. He sure was quick to make me feel like I was in the wrong.

Unfortunately this recent experience has really affected my overall experience with Yardhouse. I will not be recommending anyone to this restaurant nor I will be returning. Being a large chain as they are I hope they improve in customer service to retain some loyal business."}
{"text":"I wish there was a Yard House closer to LA within a thirty minute radius, because for sure I will be hitting that up for AMAZING Happy Hour deals.  I can't really comment on the menu outside of HH, but this was enough for me to give this joint 5 stars.

Over 100 beers on tap that really make it both a challenge and a goal to try each one.  During Happy Hour the place does get pretty busy, but service wasn't the least bit slow for me while I was over.  In fact, our server was constantly attentive and made sure we got all of our food and drink orders in.

I ordered a Miami Ice Martini ($6) and my friend and I shared some buffalo wings and seared ahi sashimi.  The drink was strong, the wings were bangin' (much better than the Hooters ones) and the sashimi was fresh and tasty.

Definitely a great start to an evening of drinks and fun."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place. I have found heaven on earth for my pallet. Food was freash and delicious. Great choice of beers. Staff was awesome. Thanks for the great date night. Well done Yard House!!"}
{"text":"Great food.  Major beer selection.  Great service.  Our go to when we have people or in town."}
{"text":"Yard house is always a safe choice when my family has no idea where to go for dinner. They have a variety of foods to choose from, something for each of us. I don't think yard house has ever let us down! LOVE the happy hour on food, can't go wrong there! Aureese seated us and she was great, such a sweet heart. Our waitress was also very nice. She got our drink orders right away and our appetizers and can tell we were ready to order our entrees as well. She made sure not to bring our appetizers, soup and entrees out at the same time thank god. If you arent sure what type of cuisine you're in the mood for yard house is deinitely a go to next time you're out shopping at downtown summerlin."}
{"text":"Amazing food and don't get me started on the beer. The house honey blond and the petrus aged red beer are some of the best tasting beers that I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"AWESOME service/staff, BEAUTIFUL location/setup, DELICIOUS food/drinks. DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED!!! You will NOT be disappointed! Honestly, best YardHouse I've ever been to."}
{"text":"I've been to Yard House quite a few times. I often frequent this place with friends or bring out of town guests here because the menu is extensive and there is something on it for just about everyone. Plus the beer selection, as well as the wine, and mixed drinks have the ability to please every palate. 

Recently I brought my sister and brother-in-law here based off of those facts. Three people with probably rather different tastes is kind of a hard combo to deal with when choosing a dining spot. Luckily, Yard House did the trick. 

There was a wait when we arrived, but it was only about 10 minutes and we were seated in a large, comfy booth, although next to the kitchen and a bit noisy, it was okay as we could all still carry on a conversation without yelling to be heard. 

The run down of the food went as following -

Grilled Artichoke Appetizer - delicious! The artichoke was grilled perfectly and served with a garlic dipping sauce. We ate every bite and then tried to eat more. Baked potato chips were also served with it, the perfect appetizer.

Seared Ahi Steak Sandwich - Okay, this was just about the best thing I've had to eat in a LONG time. The ahi was seared perfectly, somewhat cooked around the outside, and deliciously raw on the inside. The pairings in the sandwich were perfect- spinach, Swiss cheese, tomato, and caramelized onions. It comes on a rye bread and with shoe-string french fries. Honestly, this sandwich is worth every penny. 

Cuban Roast Pork Dip - My sister ordered this sandwich and it looked very good. It came with a BBQ au jus and shoe-string french fries. 

House Salad & Clam Chowder - My brother-in-law opted for this. The soup came out piping hot and he said it was really good. My sister declared it to be good too. The house salad was BIG, much bigger than I was expecting, so kudos to YH on the portions. 

Overall I have to give it up to Yard House. This most recent visit was definitely a 5 star affair. Everything was cooked well, service was good, the wait wasn't long, the noise level was decent, and  we were in and out with zero problems."}
{"text":"The best food in Las Vegas hands down. Also kegs and kegs of beer on tap..... enough said. Why waste your time anywhere else."}
{"text":"Loved the Moo Shu Egg Rolls. On happy hour they are $5.00. Our waitress Stephanie was great..Enjoyed a bottle of wine and the food was great. Tons of beer if thats what you are looking for with I think over 140 beers on tap.. Candlelights flameless were put on the table at night..Happy Hour menu was a great  deal!!"}
{"text":"Nothing I hate more than waiting as multiple bartenders browse past me while I have no drink and they refill the beer, wine and water of those around me. 

The only reason I can't give a review of 3 or less stars is because the hostess' give an accurate wait time which as someone who has been one, that is important. Also, the food is just good! 

I really hate bad service, I have been here for nearly 10 minutes and yet, no service! I shouldn't have to make eye contact. I should be served. Headed to the table now. Every time I
Come here the bartenders tends to be egotistical and don't care. 

Went to the host stand and they didn't smile! It took a second person to finally bring on the happiness! After a second wait, I was taken to a bar table!? Wtf!? Did I ask to be set at a high top? No! I  wasn't asked and I have an elderly person with me. This establishment has really gone downhill."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants of all time! This is one of the places where pretty much anything that you order will be delicious! They also carry my favorite beer: The House Belgian Amber Triple! Delicious if you like a darker brew with a soft after taste. I highly recommend the BBQ Salad and their garlic fries! Mmmm! I probably go here once a week!"}
{"text":"The burgers are awesome.  Fries and poke were good.  Calamari sucked, overcooked the first time, sent it back and then second time just bleh.  The place seems too big - which makes it super crowded, super slow.  Though they take reservations for more than 10, they don't do it on friday/saturday night.  They do call ahead, but even with calling ahead 1 hour in advance they said there was a 1 hour wait after we got there (Party of 7).  It's super loud, maybe I'm just old!  
We'd go back for burgers if we were in the area, but for sure not on a friday/saturday night."}
{"text":"Happy we finally got to try this place. We hit up happy hour early (around 4 pm) since it gets so crowded later. We tried four different apps: Kung pao calamari, California roll, the vampire taco and BBQ Chicken pizza. All were awesome but I really liked the California roll the best. It's served uniquely in a jumbo, cake-like presentation. I'm super pregnant and was drooling over all the potential craft beer choices and can't wait to come back post-baby to try some IPA's. Our super nice waitress (Lilly) hooked us up with a celebratory mini creme brûlée dessert in honor of our soon-to-be baby. What a nice surprise. Highly recommend this place. Good food, good service and potentially good beers (TBD-but lots of options at least)."}
{"text":"We left the Cardinals game early so we could get a good seat and i am glad that we did. We had Josh as our waiter and he really knew his stuff and had a great personality. As always the beer selection was overwhelming but thankfully you can never really go wrong with a good waiter. I had the Cuban Dip, the sweet tomatoes and the pickles beautifully were beautifully complemented with the Au je sauce. My boyfriend got a half rack of ribs that literally fell of the bone with the first bite. The BBQ sauce was very tasty. But i think the best thing about the meal was the creme of corn. Neither one of us were a fan of creme of corn but this was magical. ;)"}
{"text":"On Tap: this location has 130 tap handles! We were so impressed with the huge variety. They've got tons of  local and regional beers, some of which were featured in their \"chalkboard series\" of rotating drafts (Fat Head's Holly Jolly, Great Lakes Brewing Co's Christmas Ale, Willoughby Brewing's Nut Smasher, and Founders Brewing's Backwoods Bastard). They keep their (hundreds) of kegs in a glass-enclosed room upstairs that is visible from the bar area, and the bartender said they check their tap lines on the reg. 

The vibe: Swanky, yet not too downtown feeling. Wide open spaces, dark & shiny surfaces, plenty of funky art and fabulous music. All three times I've been there, the playlist has been great. Of note: the bathroom door has an automatic opener, so you don't have to touch anything after washing your hands- LOVE that!

The eats: I've been delighted with all the food I've tried! What's been best includes the Gardein menu's \"chickn\" and avocado sandwich, Garden buffalo wings, Gardein orange peel chicken (ask for the fried rice as a sub for the brown rice, which is TOP NOTCH), and the Gardein \"chick'n\" BBQ salad. Also worth trying are the Hot & spicy edamame and hummus. My husband LOVED the pineapple chicken (from the specials menu, located inside the drink menu- not in the regular menu).

The service: all three times we've had awesome service. The 2nd time we were there, we had a large party of 7. The manager walked us around the restaurant to find the best table. He made sure we were happy with our seating. That was impressive. 

I work less than 5 minutes away from the new Westlake Yard House, so will definitely try their lunch menu soon."}
{"text":"If you're a beer lover (and a bit adventurous) this place is amazing. One review said most of the beers are North American, which seems they don't know beer. EXTENSIVE beer list and the only place I've found with Chimay. 
The food is expensive but so worth it. The mac & cheese is amazing and their onion rings are among the best I've ever had. 
If you're into seafood, you MUST try their crab crusted swordfish with wasabi mashed potatoes. Again, the only place I've found that serves swordfish. 
They are really busy because of their location so I would recommend reservations. 
It's the best meal you'll find at Westgate. Trust me, I've tried them all.
One star off for the service. It's good but not great."}
{"text":"Super Bummed!!! They changed the menu. New ownership? I'm afraid this is my last time eating at Yard House. It's been a staple for me from the very beginning. Same thing happened to Claim Jumper and I haven't been back since. Feeling nostalgic and super sad."}
{"text":"Overall... Good food, wide beer selection, and great service (thanks Shauna!)

The Wait: 1 star This place is still New and Hot... And really popular!!! Especially on a Friday night. I was with a party of 4 and we called ahead 1 hour and we still waited 40 mins after we showed up... And the bad part is that there is not much of a place to wait except right by the door which is cold in the winter.  So in summary... Call an hour ahead and be prepared to wait. 

Food: 4 stars Tacos are mix and match so you can try multiple with 1 order and the Chicken with Penne was above average. Overall, the food was above average but nothing to write home about. 

Beer: 5 stars I am a beer snob/ lover so the fact that they have over 100 beers on tap, made me like a kid in a candy store. My favorite part is they let you try little samples of beer for free. So you can try the weird beers that you are not sure if you are going to like or not. 

Service: 5 stars Our waitress was Shauna and she was awesome. Our appetizer didn't come out before our meal and she comp'd it. Very knowledgable of the menu and knew the beers well even though she admitted she wasn't much of a craft beer drinker. 

Atmosphere: 3 stars This is getting really picky but the lighting was annoying. Spot lights down onto the table made it difficult to even read the menu. There was a lot of ambient noise so it was a little difficult to talk to each other. We sat at a booth which was very comfortable and roomy. Our table and the booth was clean. 
Also parking was a pain. Took about 20 mins to find a spot. Not sure how much valet was, but I might consider it next time depending on how cold it is outside. 

Price: 3 stars It was $50 before tip for 2 people, 2 normal entrees and 2 drinks. I thought it was a little on the high side for the type and quality of the food. The price for the beer was about right. Most \"speciality\" beer was $6-$7. 

Overall: Good food but great beer selection. I would wait to go to here till the hype of this new restaurant dies down, or go during week so you don't have to wait 2+ hours to be seated."}
{"text":"It's okay, but I would rerecommend walking down a ways to the whiskey Rose! Outside patio is very nice and the service is great! And the view is fun. Just having drinks but it's a great way to spend the afternoon!"}
{"text":"The food is good, and they really do a great job offering a lot of vegetarian choices.  They also have a lot of really good beers.  Nothing too out of the ordinary though, and I wish they'd put a little more effort into seeking out new beers.  They have a few seasonals they rotate in but even they are pretty mainstream - Sam Adams Seasonal, etc.  

I also think it's pretty expensive. 2 people who eat and have a few drinks can get up to $100.

But they do have a lot of TV's for sports.  All in all, a pretty good place."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere!! Amazing menu... So many choices. Had the queso for an appetizer, delicious!!! For dinner I had the chicken advocado sandwich but their menu is very impressive! Great beer selection... We were very happy with our meal and cannot WAIT to be back!"}
{"text":"Great food! The atmosphere is awesome!
Me and my gf had the lobster,crab,artichoke dip and it was on point! We also like the classic sliders! Cook medium rare so they're juicy.! And of course u can't forget about the variety of beers they have on craft! I recommend it if ur down in Glendale area! West gate is a great little oasis of entertainment here In the canyon state!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Really good food and delicious craft beers from all around the country.  The place is also packed with eye candy for the ladies...whoever does the hiring here definitely selected some good looking men (thank you!).  The wait staff is also very efficient and plentiful.  You'll never have to search for someone to help you out.  
It's a good mixed crowd for happy hour and they have some decent booze/food specials if you happen to be there during those hours.  I've had the steak salad, fish tacos, and a burger on my visits and they have all been delicious.  I like the open air kitchen that you can check out while waiting for your food to be prepared too.  I love fruity beers and Yard House has an entire section for me to choose from.  I've had the blueberry, pineapple, and peach ales and really liked each one.  For those of you who don't like that type of beer, I guarantee there is something on their menu you'll be excited to try.    
If you are looking for a place to go on a Friday or Saturday night that is fun but not crazy and outrageous (like Sandbar), give this place a try.  I've always found the vibe to be laid back and they play some decent music inside."}
{"text":"I love the Yard House!  Until I moved to PHX, I can honestly say that I was a total anti craft beer snob.  I always felt as if drinking a craft beer would magically transport you to Hipsterville and I'd be forced to listen to obscure music while riding a tricked out bicycle wearing a beanie hat in the desert.  Well guess what, people?  It doesn't happen!  Rejoice knowing that craft beer is DELICIOUS and won't make you a pretentious snob. ;)
The restaurant is always packed and for good reason.  Their food is awesome, and ranges from salads to burgers to steak and everything else in between.  I've tried many options on the menu and have never been disappointed.  The staff is well versed in their offerings and will be more than happy to provide you a recommendation on their tasty food.  I also like the open air kitchen...if you don't want to watch sports on their seemingly endless number of televisions, you can watch the chefs hustle throughout the kitchen working their magic.
Beer?  They've got it.  The beer menu is just as long as the food menu and doesn't disappoint.  They've done less saavy drinkers such as myself a solid and broken down the beers into types and flavors.  For instance, if you're looking for a fruity ale, just go to the fruit beer section.  It makes selecting a drink you're bound to love a breeze.  My two favorites are Four Peak's Peach Ale and San Tan's Mr. Pineapple.  You've just gotta try those if you like fruity beer like I do.  Mucho delicioso!  
The Yard House also has a pretty solid Happy Hour with deals on drinks and food.  The clientele ranges from kiddos to businessmen and has a fun, lively vibe.  Definitely check the Yard House out if you want good food, good drinks, and fun."}
{"text":"We went for lunch on a Sunday afternoon for my friend's birthday.  I've never been to a Yard House.  They were located  on Las Vegas Blvd at Town Square in Las Vegas.

We shared an order of Fried Calamari.  It came with tartar and spicy tomato sauce.  There was a good amount of tentacles and body breaded in a heavy cornmeal breading.

My friend ordered the half order of Ahi Crunchy Salad which had 4 pieces of seared rare ahi, field greens, asian slaw and crispy wontons tossed in soy vinaigrette.  The full order had 6 pieces of seared rare ahi and more field greens.

My other friend ordered the lunch portion of BBQ Pizza and a Classic Ranch Salad.  The salad was just iceberg lettuce with shredded carrots, cucumber, and tomatoes.

I ordered the lunch portion of half a Roast Beef Dip and a cup of Clam Chowder.
There was not a spoon on the plate, so I had to track down our server.  The Roast Beef Dip was tender and the creamy horseradish was really good.  Next time I would order a whole Roast Beef Dip which comes with fries.  i had also ordered a side of french fries.  They were warm, not freshly fried.

The server brought out a complimentary Mini Lemon Souffle with fresh raspberries and house made whipped cream with a candle for my friend's birthday.  It was very light.

I will be back."}
{"text":"Good food, beer, and service.  The place is packed after 6:00 pm so you'll have to wait for a table."}
{"text":"I was so excited to bump into the Yard House.  I was going to see a movie at the AMC at the Town Center plaza, but had an hour or two before the show, and decided to pick up lunch.  The Yard House is huge, yet surprisingly cozy.  They have a whole menu of vegetarian options featuring Gardein brand veggie \"meats\".  I had a \"chicken\" burger with some yummy fries.  I enjoyed it so much, that I came back for dinner after the movie and had the fried \"chicken\" strips.  The salads off the regular menu are also good.  If I ever come back to Las Vegas, this will be my first stop after picking up my rental car."}
{"text":"Our first time here was met with good food, good service and an all around positive experience. We were seated fairly quickly because the place is so large. We live about an hour and a half away, so there was no booze for us, unfortunately. 
Our chosen dishes:  pizza (which was very tasty, but the olive oil on the pizza tin made the crust very soggy and hard to eat), fried chicken sandwich (with a little seasoning, it could have been perfect) and a roast beef au jus with added griddled onions (excellent and highly recommended).  Our server came over quickly, refilled our drinks quickly and was very helpful in menu selections.  
JR (of the Cleveland Cavaliers) came in to eat with his family, so I guess if it's good enough for him, it's good enough for the rest of us mere mortals, right?
We will definitely return when we're in the area and if you're around there, you should stop in, too."}
{"text":"I asked our waiter if they had an gluten free beer besides what was on the menu.  He said no and then asked me if I needed their gluten free menu...a whole gluten free menu!  As far as gluten free goes they have a great selection of menu items.  I chose carne asada street tacos.  He informed me that I could not have the original rice that came with them and gave me choices of white or brown rice.  I was seriously impressed with this waiter.  He then let me know that he personally talked to the cook and the floor manager so that everyone was aware that my plate was gluten free so there would be no cross contamination.  Wow!  

My beer was Ommision Pale Ale and the Lager.  Both tasty but I preferred the Pale Ale.  The tacos were so yummy!!  The meat was so tender.  

I would go back in a heart beat!  There are still many items on their menu that I want to try."}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended by a hotel employee. I asked her where I could get a delicious steak and she did not hesitate to recommend this restaurant. She added their prices are also very reasonable. We entered gave our party information and went to order a drink from the bar. The bar was nice, clean and the lighting was good. We were seated in12 minutes. That's fast. And there were 5 parties ahead of ours. We ordered appetizers and entrées. The food was great. The steak was prepared to my picky specification. I like my filet mignon just a bit over medium well. 
It was served above a nice serving of mashed potatoes and a delicious cream sauce. There were sliced carrots on the plate decoratively placed. It was plenty of food for me. And the filet melted in my mouth. My friend had a seafood Bisque. She said it also was delicious. The service was great. From entering the door til well after our meal and conversation were over, we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. And yes the price was very reasonable. Overall it was the best filet mignon I've ever had. And I've tried alot."}
{"text":"I love the Yard house from their food to their drinks and let's not forget about the dessert it's a must have. We always get the brownie with vanilla ice cream and it's amazing."}
{"text":"Yard house is amazing. The place has a very warm atmosphere every time I go.

All the employees I have dealt with were very professional and friendly. Service is above satisfactory.

With a big beer selection, you will definitely find the right beer for yourself, my favorite is the Rose Gaarden.

Food is awesome, there isn't anything there that I have ordered that I didn't like. I recommend the seared ahi sashimi appetizer if you are like me and usually go for the drinks but still want to have a small lunch/dinner."}
{"text":"Great variety of appetizers, interesting menu choices and wine choices. Beer variety is unbelievable!! Has TVs for any sporting event.... my only wish would be that it be less noisy"}
{"text":"Pet Peeve 1/100:
When the waiter/bartender calls you \"Boss.\" Not sure why it makes me so upset but definitely doesn't sit well with me. Don't call me boss. Also, why close out my tab after I just ordered food? What's the rush of my payment? Makes me not want to order anything else. Giving 3 stars because I love the food but loses 2 because he was unsettling. *shrugging shoulders emoji*"}
{"text":"My favorite Yard House in town, not only I'm a fan of their happy hour but the staffs here are welcoming and friendly! 

Shouts out to Derick and Jennifer! Whenever I come here with my boyfriend and family I always ask for them. They would come to our tables to check up on us and ask if we need anything even if they were busy"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my brother. Very good Bloody Mary's, a little pricey at $10 but they were good. The food was adequate, regular restaurant fare. The service was good and it was perfect for the weather on the patio. Overall we enjoyed the food, service and atmosphere. Did I mention that the Bloody Mary's were great, bacon stirrer."}
{"text":"It was time to use some of those points I've been accumulating, so we decided to go to Red Rock for a nearby dinner at the Yard House - and also get in my last nights donations to the casino before my exile to New Jersey.

It was pretty crowded for a Tuesday night, so it was loud.  Very loud.  I'm not a big fan of loud restaurants, and this was no different from the Yard House in Town Square.  It didn't help that there was a huge table of guys right next to us; it was better after they left, but just a tad.

I had the Blue Crab Cake Hoagie, which came with bacon, avocado, swiss and tomato, with a cajun aioli.  I remembered to ask the waitress if the crab cake was mostly filler, but forgot to ask if it was fried.  So of course, it was.  Deep fried crab cakes - just the thing to stick between two big hunks of break.  I have to admit I liked the crab cakes a lot - I just don't like to eat fried food.  But the bread, which I expected to be crisp 'cause it was toasted, was woefully soft.

My husband had the Parmesan Crusted Chicken Entree, which came with garlic mashed.  He liked it just fine.

Service was good, but overall, I'm not quite sure why this place is so popular.  It must have something to do with me not being a beer drinker!"}
{"text":"I like their selection of beer and their food is good. Also a nice restaurant atmosphere. Definitely a place worth revisiting with good company."}
{"text":"Some friends and I decided to try this place today. I think everyone was happy with their lunch, but overall I wasn't that impressed with the experience.  Here are a few things I didn't like. 

Seems like a bar trying to be a restaurant.
Therefore not a god place for lunch.
My Caesar salad with nothing on it was eleven dollars...it wasn't that big!
Entrances are very confusing. 
Interior very dark....once again like a bar. 

They have a very large menu full of American favorites, and I could see this place as a good spot to meet some friends for dinner. For families and lunch this spot may be weird. For drinking and eating...probably the best bet."}
{"text":"The food, drink selection and service was outstanding! I highly recommend the street tacos! Will be going back again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here late night about 12am so we didn't want to go overboard on the food. I don't know if the snack menu is a new concept for the Yard House because I don't remember seeing it before. I liked that idea a lot because we were able to order a couple of different things to taste. 

I had the Shrimp Ceviche that were served with four filled spoons. If you are hungry don't order this because it may just piss you off. I wasn't that hungry so it was just right! It had little bits of Mango in it which was a nice twist. 

I also ordered their salad that came with Avocado, Mandarin Oranges, Strawberries, and Candied Pecans. It was really good some people don't get the fruit in salad combo but I really enjoy it. It just makes it more satisfying for me. 

We also snacked on some good old chips in salsa. You can never go wrong with that. 

The multiple snacks kept us alert and satisfied to play for a few hours at Red Rock. It was a winning night all around!"}
{"text":"The food and drinks are always great and the beer selection is wonderful. Probably one of the few places worth visiting at Westgate."}
{"text":"Why do hostesses always seem to place me with the new servers?  No worries, though, because while Nicole A. needed manager Simon's assistance from time to time, she still remained friendly, upbeat, and positive, and served up good vibes the entire time!  

After the usual questions regarding my most common allergies, I decided on ordering the Spinach Dip and Margherita Pizza, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=x4wwwCcZ6KrR3fugBRSf6A&userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA half-priced during HH, and the new Mayan Mule, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=h7txU1EsWwm_2kCMPAm-CQ&userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA made with ginger beer made in-house, with manager subbing soda water for the corn syrup-laden ginger ale, minus the strawberry skewer (yep, strawberry allergy, too).  Simon was able to steer me away from the Onion Ring stack (corn syrup in the beer batter) and two of the Mini-Dessert Trio (the Chocolate Souffle Cake and Apple Crumble both come with ice cream that contain corn syrup!).  Next time, I know to try the Fried Mac n Cheese WITHOUT the porcini cream sauce, which usually comes on the side.

All three of my selections were delicious!  Loved the salty and creamy spinach dip, and the crunchy parmesan-topped fried pita crisps that accompanied the app made it so much fun to eat! https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=YmiR5j64Y8Y4N9Ave9iXfQ&userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA  Simon came around and asked how the food items were, and I said they were both great, with the pizza not being as crispy as I'd liked, but still great, and he offered to have it crisped a little more.  OK!  Awesome service from both server Nicole and manager Simon-- thank you!!

LOVED seeing the caloric counts in almost every menu item!  (Alcohol beverages, with the exception of beers, had caloric counts.)"}
{"text":"Yay! I'm a fan!
My pescatarian sister, husband, and I had dinner here on Friday night. The location was perfect because we needed to hit the Microsoft Store (and who doesn't love to visit the Tesla store, huh?!).
I did research about food in the mall before I went to see what restaurants. Picked this one based solely on location, menu selection, and a few reviews. While online I could tell it was nearby (but unsure what floor it was located on), it was super hard to figure out on the mall directory. It wasn't on the directory's list of food but it was listed on the map.
There were plenty of choices, so many that it was hard to decide. Even my sister had a hard time, and quite often there are so few options for her that she's the first one to make up her mind.
Host Staff and waitress were super nice. Service was quick. Everyone was super pleased with their meal. We ordered the Truffle Fries with shredded parmesan and herbs = Yum! I had the small portion of Mac & Cheese with chicken and bacon and LOVED IT! (Thank you to restaurants for realizing that there need to be more than one portion size - because that was PLENTY of food for an adult's portion, especially if you order an appetizer)
The gal we had as our server was wearing a shirt that labeled her as a Trainer - if the new folks follow her lead they'll be successful in the business."}
{"text":"Love that they have angry orchard on draft and I'm obsessed with their happy hour. Nachos, pizza, egg roll and pretty much everything is yummy. Oh I really enjoy the calamari. They have panty of tv's to catch the game on while enjoying a child one with friends. I definitely keep coming back and so do my friends. Staff is friendly and usually pretty good. I had my last birthday here and the bay desert is yummy, has a little candle and has a design that says happy birthday. It was great. Definitely cove check it out if have not been before, they have a lot of great options."}
{"text":"The Yard House is an amazing place for great food and awesome service! Our drinks were never low and the house was packed. Our server was enthusiastic and helpful in not only picking drinks but food as well. They were also awesome in helping make sure one of our meals was safe because of a food allergy. We will definitely be back, the \"pub\" far exceeded our expectations."}
{"text":"Loved Yard House at Red Rock Casino!  The Thai Chicken Noodle Salad was amazing! 

They have an area outside where you can eat, which is nice on those refreshing winter nights.  I would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"Consistently Good.Been to several around the states and never been disapointed.Great beer and beer selection.Both the food and finger food good also.Im usually get appetizers only and focus on the beer."}
{"text":"Over 100 craft beers on tap?? Ok!  Have amazing food and one of the best happy hours in town, then I'm really in!

Well I've been to this yard house at West gate as well as others in the area and nearby states and have always liked them. Great concept serving craft beers while listening to classic rock. I love coming for happy hour as they have an excellent selection of food and beer specials. Plus their hand crafted Martinis are on special. 

I've eaten several items from the main menu, favorites are mac n cheese (sounds simple) but with truffle oil it's amazing, plus the lobster noodles. Heck anything is really good here. The only thing it can get pricy but I don't mind paying for quality once in a while.  

Yard house is one of the few places that will earn my business even if there isn't a sporting event at Westgate.  I love coming here and I'm sure I'll be coming here for years."}
{"text":"Food is good sometimes, but this place has changed. Their delivery service, grubhub sucks. Waited 2 hours for food and it never came. I order the same thing all the time and it tastes different here and there. They really need to deliver their own food. Worst experience ever. People are nice there, but not consistent with delivery."}
{"text":"What a great place for lunch before a movie at Regal Cinemas across the way. I had a fab grilled cheese sandwich with avocado and tomato bisque.  Nom nom, so yummy and simple after all that Christmas food!  Service was good. We barely waited for a table. No beer today but they have many many many taps on hand if you so desire!!!!  Friends enjoyed their burger and Nashville Chicken....spicy!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and amazing beer! Still can't believe how much draft they have. Thanks to our server Andrea for always providing great service!"}
{"text":"The holiday season will soon be upon us, and that means one thing.
Shopping for the ones you love.

Matching the right gift to that special someone is always a challenge, but it doesn't need to be. Not anymore.
May I suggest the Yard House at Fashion Square?

Start your shopping here with some of Yard House's spectacular IPA flights, enough to insure you're buzzing like a high-voltage power line. Now it's time to get started with that shopping.

Take the short stroll to the information booth inside the mall, its just a few short steps away from the Yard House. This is where they sell gift certificates redeemable at any of the Fashion Square shops.

Next, inquire that the clerk run your card through the thingy to see what its limit is. Once you know the available limit, your judgment, sufficiently impaired from pre-shopping activities, will allow you to throw caution to the wind as you go balls on your loved ones. This is how I never fail to match the right gift with that special someone.
But here's where it gets tricky.
DO NOT max out the card. 
I suggest leaving at least a hundred on it for your immediate return to the Yard House, where you''ll find refuge from all your holiday shopping madness.

Once safely at the Yard House, finish off your holiday spree with another couple rounds and some delicious chicken wings, again, being prudent to not max out the card. 
Leave at least twenty bucks for the cab ride home.

PS. If possible, don't go shopping the same day as your wife. This will allow you to safely sneak out the house with HER Visa card."}
{"text":"I don't know if the Yard House at Town Center is typical of other Yard House locations... but my first impression of the one at Town Center is \"Wow! The largest Bar / Sports Bar I've ever been to!\" The Bar must have been forty yards long with a circular seating arrangement... that's almost a football field length of seating just to consume liquor or watch your favorite team on one of the LCD TVs. Don't feel comfortable at the \"Bar\"? ... well there's dimly lit table seating around the extremities of the interior of the Yard House, as well as outside seating under a covered patio.

If you're not consuming your liquor at Happy Hour here at the Yard House... you have a lot more money to spare than I do, or you're just being extravagant for no rational reason. Lindeman's Framboise at only $4.00 a glass! Raspberry Cider, also at the same price! And, the Happy Hour extends late into the night...

As for the food... specifically the Appetizers... the menu needs work...

  Spicy Thai Chicken Pizza (*) First of all, it's a thin-crust Pizza.. a 
      negative already! Carrots, Green Onion, Cilantro, Mozzarella, 
      Macadamia Nuts, and Firecracker Sauce as a topping... essentially 
      very, very close to a Vegan Pizza. Prior apologies to all Vegans... 
      Yecch!
  Chicken Lettuce Wrap (**** 1/2) Stir fried, smoked tofu, pine nuts and 
      green onions with three dipping sauces with a meat choice of either 
      Chicken, Tiger Shrimp, or Shiitake and Portabella Mushrooms. Very, 
      very good. 
  Onion Ring Tower (****) Beer battered and dusted with Parmesan 
      Cheese... served with Chipotle and Ranch Dip Sauces. And... I don't 
      even like Onion Rings... that's saying a lot for the perfectly made 
      Onion Rings!
  Chicken Nachos (**) Thin, and I mean thin Tortilla Chips with Cheddar 
      and Jack Cheese, Tomato, Cilantro, Onions, Guacamole and spicy 
      whole Pinto Beans. Chips were deteriorating as we sat. Word to the 
      wise... consume this appetizer quickly, or it just turns into mush. 
      Definitely, not as good as one of the many cheap, late-night Taquerias 
      you can find around Las Vegas.
  Fried Calamari (**** 1/2) An appetizer which I never order because most 
      restaurants usually over-fry the Calamari where it becomes 
      super-tough and chewy... but not that night when we consumed it! 
      Served with spicy Tomato and Tartar sauces.
  Spicy Tuna Roll (**) Definitely, not a favorite at the table. Not enough 
      Tuna, maybe? Or it could've been the odd mixture of textures with an 
      almost crunchy Edamame. Seared Ahi Tuna with Avocado, Edamame, 
      Cucumber and Wasabi Soy Sauce.
  Classic Sliders (***) Nothing special here. Four mini Burgers made from 
      Naturewell Natural Angus Beef served with Cheddar Cheese, House 
      Special Sauce, Fries and Pickle. Preparation of the Fries were better 
      than the Sliders!

Do you know what it takes to transport all the Liquor over to the Bar area? As I was looking around Yard House to take some pics... I noticed the shiny pipes running along the ceiling emanating from the entrance area of Yard House heading off in the direction of the Bar. There are, literally, dozens of pipes that feed liquor to the bar stored in an Orange-hued room ( http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/uxe7CbaX8_9H82ljSg2Jxw/l ) ( http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/a1UfHHYUMxC145fLbNcyLw/l ) to the left of the entrance as you walk in. Moving that much Liquor takes quite a bit of technology!

Liquor @ Happy Hour (*****)
Appetizers (***)

Dessert? Not tonight. Went back to my son's house for Guava Cake ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/akis-bakery-san-jose#hrid:NKSpkOhHHESYQkF1WN_nOg ), which I brought over from San Jose..."}
{"text":"Very busy!!! This restaurant is located at the Town Square Mall.  It is near Gameworks.  It was just after the holidays so everyone was still going to the mall.  The parking lot was very full but was lucky enough to find a parking nearby.  I parked by h&m which isn't too far from Yardhouse.  They do have happy hour from 3p-6p which I sadly missed :( 

As we walked into the restaurant, there was a lot of people waiting.... It was very crowded inside especially because It was too cold to wait outside.  We waited for about 15-20 minutes which isn't too bad.  There is open seating at the bar but we had kids so we got a nice booth in the corner.  Once we sat down, we were handed menus. Our server came to us in about 2-3 minutes to take our drink orders.  It did take a while for our drinks to come in but understandable.  We ordered 3 kids meals and they each come with a drink, entree with 2 sides, and a choice of dessert for only $6.99! My friend got the gumbo and I decided to get the Margherita pizza and truffle fries.  

The 2 adult orders surprisingly came out before the kids meals.  The kids ordered Mac n cheese and teriyaki chicken.  The kids juices also came after the meals because they told us that the bar was backed up.  Everything did taste great though!! The pizza was very hot and delicious.  Cheesy just the way I liked It.  The truffle fries were awesome!!! I'm craving some right now.  I also had the kids Mac n cheese which didn't really have much flavor.  

My tab was maybe about $20 which isn't too bad for a whole pizza.  I would come again but would like to come for happy hour!  Oh! And they are also vegetarian friendly!!"}
{"text":"Ordered food from here few days ago it came faster then I was told it would. Food was hot tasted amazing."}
{"text":"The crispy brussel sprouts and ripped potatoes were awesome.  I loved the atmosphere and service was great.  I will return next time I'm back in Vegas."}
{"text":"I have been here a number of times and have never been disappointed. On my most resent visit I had the Turkey Cobb Salad. This was by no means a traditional Cobb, it had radishes, corn, edamame, carrots, in addition to the regular bacon, egg, bleu cheese, avocado, tomato, and greens. It was very good and the lunch portion was very filling. 
Some other honorable mentions that are on my favorite list here is the Mac and Cheese add Cajun Chicken, The Chicken Sandwiches.... both the Nashville Hot and the Fried Chicken Sandwiches are great."}
{"text":"I was let down to find out there was no yard inside the Yard House at Westgate but it was still a good time.  I came here last night with my family for my Wife & son's birthday.  We started off with a California roll & artichoke for appetizers.  We weren't too impressed with either but ate most of it, the roll was a gigantic piece of sushi packed with rice (should have taken a picture) so it was not the kind of roll you pick up with chop sticks.  The artichoke didn't seemed cooked all the way but most of it was pretty good.  Then I ordered the chicken enchilada stack and it was pretty good and I had a cup of the white chicken tortilla soup and that was the best I have ever had.  We also ordered the shrimp Caesar salad and a shrimp enchilada stack and everyone seemed to enjoyed it.   The atmosphere is great here with 2 beautiful patio areas and the bar inside has what looks like is about 100 draft beer selections, several flat screen TVs throughout.  The booths and table are very comfortable and the whole place has a nice dark warm feeling, great date place for dinner then grab a movie or show nearby.  We went out of our way to eat here for a reason, it is consistently great food, great service, & great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Always enjoy meeting friends here for lunch or dinner.  Good food and a large selection of beers."}
{"text":"Please set up a reservation for twenty-people in advance of their arrival. Don't have them waiting forty minutes after their time of reservation because you failed to launch. Please bring us our drinks before fifteen minutes have elapsed. Don't have us waiting for thirty minutes to even place  our order. Please have at least three servers assigned our large-party-table. Don't stiff us with just two. Please have the music on level five so we can still have a conversation without yelling. Don't have it on level twelve so at the end of three hours we are nearly deaf. Please step up your service, even on a Saturday night. Don't make us have talk to the manager or have to Yelp you."}
{"text":"Several great vegan options and an awesome outdoor patio!"}
{"text":"Food was extra oniony, then shrek came and interrupted our meal. Then shrek saw Prince Charming and yelled and challenged him to a fight to the death, charming would not let shrek tarnish his honor and accepted. Shrek used his karate skills and choked out Prince Charming and won. Otherwise the food was bland."}
{"text":"Really good food here. Their Buffalo wings was really good and I love their jambalaya plate the sauce was so favorable! Guacamole and chip dip was great and there onion rings is stacking lol service was very slow. I'm not a beer drinking but they have tons of beers to choose from!!"}
{"text":"Beer selection is fabulous. Being a Stout/Porter guy myself, I loved looking at the menu and seeing a section completed dedicated to those dark beers. Yard House does a fantastic job at giving patrons a chance to find something they like, simply because of their wide variety. 

The atmosphere in Westgate is fun, giving everyone a chance to have good conversation, the chance to listen to live music, and eat/drink. 

The only downside to Yard House is the outdoor seating. During the hotter months in Phoenix, they've had continued trouble with the system that sprays mist. Without the mist, there's no point being outside and you'll end up losing the cool vibe of Westgate. 

Overall great food, great beer, and a great part of Phoenix to socialize in."}
{"text":"If you are having trouble deciding where to eat this is the place for you! Nice calm atmosphere, wide variety of food, great staff. It was my first time here and I will be looking forward to going back again. My son loved his salad and chicken. I had the seared ahi which was incredible!"}
{"text":"First time here. Hubby says we have a new spot. Great atmosphere, great service and great food!!"}
{"text":"I've been to several Yard House's around the country and love them all. I like the Ahi tuna appetizers, mushroom lettuce wraps and carnitas street tacos to name a few. This time I tried the Strawberry fields martini and WOW! Must try. We sat on the patio and it was nice! Husband loves all the beer selections they offer."}
{"text":"Yard house is hands down my favorite restaurant of all. Happy hour from 3-6pm and late night from 10pm to I believe midnight. Great appetizer deals and drink specials. We get the ahi poke stack, sliders and pizza every time. Service is always great. Aside from happy hour, their regular entrees are great too, like the Mac and cheese squared and truffle fries."}
{"text":"Love Yardhouse. The food is always great and service never disappoints. This was my first time to this location and I wasn't disappointed. They have a really nice outdoor area directly underneath the high roller. I'll stick to the yardhouse close to home just because driving all the way to the strip is a hassle but if we're ever in the area I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Hungry while shopping so stopped in here for a bite to eat.

The good: Surf and Turf Burger.....who would have thought to put lobster and asparagus in a burger....surprisingly it works and if I were reviewing the burger alone I would give it 5 stars.
Beer Selection...AMAZING....I think I read somewhere it has the most beers on tap anywhere in Phoenix and judging by what I saw this has to be correct! ..... Correction... just viewed their website and they claim to have the World's Largest Selection of Draft Beer!...pretty impressive.
Music....classic rock....very nice
The service....very fast and friendly

The not so good: Pork Sandwich...not tasty at all....too much Pork....and the combinations just don't really work
The fries.....pretty hard to make tasteless fries....but they are here

We still plan on going back as the menu has some original ideas....and am very curious about them.

This does seem like a very popular spot too....looking around halfway through our meal we could not see a single empty table. So maybe once you know what to order it is not such a bad spot.

*****Highly recommend the Scottish Ale that my husband ordered....definitely a five star Ale"}
{"text":"Been a fan of the Yard House for a while now. Now that there is one right by the house, we no longer have to go to the one on Town Square. Love the Mac & Cheese and Jambalaya. Burgers are not bad either. If you are a beer fan, they have an amazing selection on draft."}
{"text":"I was in the Yard House yesterday March 19, 2011 in the morning.. I have been there before and didn't care to much for it.
A friend of mine invited me to go since I have been visiting from out of town during the spring training. 
I have to say that this time around was so very impressive. My server went on and beyond the call of duty just to help us enjoy our meal. .I ordered the macaroni n Cheese squares. Very Good!!!!! 
 My servers named was Brandon, tall young man with blue eyes and dark short hair. He really new the menu and his job. Very pleasurable to talk to and always a smile, and willing to make sure we were happy.. Never asked for any refills nor did we sit with dirty dishes.. I being a server many years ago, I look for certain things.. I have to say I was very impressed at the way we were treated on this day.
I'm not sure how your server's are trained, but I really have to say you did a great job with him.. He is a great asset to your company, I just wish more servers were like him.. They are very far and few anymore..
It was a great time and great food!! Will visit again in the future and hope to have him as a server!
Thanks so much for jobs well done!!!!!"}
{"text":"stopped in last night because we were starving after playing bingo.....urrggh I was waiting on the cashball...that's for another story :(
So gram, dad and gram's bff came in around 9:15 for a bite to eat.  HAPPY HOUR PLEASE....although all we got from the HH menu was the onion rings.  WOOOWEEE.  Dallas was our server.  She was very awesome and patient with my soft speaking grandma and her bff.  
We all got burgers, gram and Ms. S got theirs w/ the mixed fruit and dad and I got the French Fries.  Everything was super good except my bun was cold.  I wasn't expecting that and kinda threw me off but the burger and fries were piping hot.
Ive been to Yard House several times but I think this is my first review.  Great place and tons of selection for beer.  Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Excellent meal, great dessert, and so many beers.  I wasn't even mad when they were out of my favorite beer that night, because they had 10 other similar beers on tap, and several house brews/blends to try."}
{"text":"There are two parts to this review. One for the restaurant and our meal itself and the other for our server. 

We came here while walking the strip before our scheduled show. It's an awesome location by the high roller observer wheel and a pedestrian walkway that isn't too overly crowded. We were pleasantly surprised to go in and have it have tons of space and nice big booths. Our food was amazing. We all started with the add on ranch salad. Not only was the portion very generous the taste was amazing. We got the vodka shrimp pasta, California roll and orange chicken. Everything came out hot, delicious and again great portions. This was a definite hit and we walked out very happy with our choice. 

Our server (Felipe) receives a 2 stars at most. He seemed nice at first meet. But once he explained the drink menu very excited only to have none of us order alcohol his mood quickly switched. As ladies who don't drink especially one of which being pregnant our excellent service shouldn't depend on if we do or do not order alcohol. From this point on we were minimally checked on, he would barely make eye connect and seemed in a rush to get to any other table but our own. The final scratch on our tally for him was when we tried to help by clearing our plates and placing them at the end of the table. He came to collect and rolled his eyes and gave us a good lesson on how \"servers don't appreciate stacking your plates because it looks like they aren't doing their job.\" Truthfully he wasn't doing his job to the best of his ability and we simply wanted more space on our table. But thanks for the lesson and not the refill on our drinks."}
{"text":"Celebrated my birthday here last Friday night with my girlfriends. Had to book in advance for a larger group, spoke to the manager and he even called me an hour before to confirm we're coming. Our reservation was for 430 and we got sat right away. Our waitress, Robyn was so attentive and sweet. Even the happy hour menu was killer!!! Thanks for making it a memorable experience, Robyn!"}
{"text":"Great place for the whole family. There is a Wide variety of incredible food choices including vegetarian and vegan selections. Our server Derick was amazing. We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Have been here once, but would definitely go back! 
Went on a Saturday night and they were PACKED! Wait wasn't super long though. They have 100s of beers on tap, and I'd never seen a place have anything like that before! Great selection! Their signature cocktails are super delicious! I enjoyed the food a lot as well. Ordered the calamari, truffle fries, and sweet potato fries to start out with. The sweet potato fries came with a  creamy maple-bacon aioli, which was very interesting and delicious! Everyone at the table enjoyed their entree. Burgers, mac n cheese, BBQ salad, and my spinach salad. There were so many choices on the menu, many of which caught my eye, so I need to go back soon! Our waitress was a little odd and it almost seemed like she was on something. She would ask if we were ready (which we were), took one person's order then walked away! We all kinda stared at each other like 'did that just happen?' I can let that go though. Nothing a few good beers can't cure!"}
{"text":"Enormous beer selection. Chicken tortilla soup and bbq chicken salad are very very good. Service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"I always come here either with my friend or family, You can never go wrong with this place. The happy hour is phenomenal! We all order dishes and share with one another. You will be leaving this place stuffed!"}
{"text":"My family and I had an amazing lunch here!!! It all started with the welcoming hosts and hostesses. We let them know how many and a host(in training I think) led us to our table. On the way he let us know about their very special location. For instance The Linq location is the largest Yard House location in the company! AND the only 2 story location. I've been to a few different Yard Houses and always marvel at the room next to the entrance FULL of beautiful kegs. Well this location does it waaaaay better. The kegs are above the bar! The layout is simply beautiful! 

After we were seated our AMAZING server James came and said hi. We knew we wanted to try some beer but had no idea which kind. We told him we needed more time. After he left we needed to get the kiddos situated(I have a very energetic 2 year old) and when he came back we still weren't ready(our fault!) he was SUPER patient. We decided on a watermelon beer and a tangerine beer(this ones better.) we stared with shrimp ceviche and shrimp lettuce wraps and both were tasty. I love the sauces with the lettuce wraps!! For the main courses hubby had the surf and turf burger while I had my go to Mac n cheese, large so I could have leftovers lol. I never had seen their kids menu and it's pretty impressive lots of mains, lots of sides, comes with a drink and choice of dessert. Choices! My kids shared the pizza with edamame as the side and fresh fruit for dessert. Everything put on our table was fantastic 

Now back to the service. As a yelper in the food service industry I tend to nit pick over service. I never make a fuss to anyone save my husband.  And presumably we eat out....too much. Service is rarely great, let alone damn near flawless. So when I enter a chain restaurant I don't have high expectations. James was PHENOMENAL he was kind, attentive, patient, and conversed the perfect amount and at the perfect times. I will always ask for him and I recommend you do the same!!!"}
{"text":"This place has always been a good place, good food, good service and the atmosphere is always a fun one.  This place is always busy which says a lot about this place.  If you have never been here, the menu has a wide variety selection, they even have a Vegetarian menu if you do not eat meat or fish.

I like this place and highly recommend this place to anyone in the area.  On days that there are sports on TV, expect this place to be crowded.  But I can tell you the food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"We were told someone would call us on Monday, today is Wednesday and no call or contact from anyone there.  Even though the girl we talked to knew what the issue may have been, still no apology, no offer to repay any of the $100 plus we spent and never got consumed.  Reading previous reviews now it looks like over the past month there's been issues.  We have never had any issues at any of the other locations in town only the Town Square location.  Oh well, many other good places in Town Square that care."}
{"text":"Every time I'm in Vegas, I make a trip to one of the yard houses. This one is in a really good location. Great beer menu and delicious food. I wish there was one in Utah, but it will never happen ever."}
{"text":"Top notch restaurant in Westgate. Be prepared to spend a little money but the food is worth it. The worst part is deciding what you want because there's more than a handful of things that sound and ARE delicious. Also a great place to just come and have a couple drinks and some bar food."}
{"text":"Stopped in the other night after doing some shopping. Server was great and on top of everything. My mom always orders the chicken tenders and sweet potato fries and they never disappoint. I ordered a caesar salad to start and the Four Cheese Pizza. Salad dressing was really good, not too fishy and pizza was excellent. I can always count on Yard House to deliver a good meal!"}
{"text":"First time here, our waiter, Duane, made our evening such a joy. Service was excellent, food was served as ordered, came hot and my wife's coffee cup was never empty. 
We will be back. Ed and June"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time, food is horrible and manager seems like she is on meth. I don't typically splurge and order filet but on this occasion I went for it, ordered mid rare and received a well done steak. They didn't even comp it for me and service took along time. Not going back."}
{"text":"Thank you Yard House for making my birthday special. I booked a table for 15 for family to celebrate my birthday. They told me that there is a 30 minute window to accommodate such a big group. I told them that would be fine. When we arrived the manager, Hope, told me they were almost ready. Just waiting on one table to clear to extend our spot. We waited a bit but the table just wouldn't leave. We went ahead and sat down anyway to start the celebrations. Shortly after appetizers the table finally moved. The waiter quickly set up our extension and we had plenty of room. Then Hope sent over complimentary dessert for our patience. She was great. Totally on top of it. Thanks again. Great place to eat."}
{"text":"Hubby and I met some coworkers here a few Fridays ago. It was around 7p and, needless to say, it was mobbed. We had about a 25 minute wait for a table for eight. But once we sat down, service was quite fast! At this late time in the evening I was starving and ordered immediately - I wanted the loaded Nachos with fries instead of chips. The waitress said it was no problem at all and there was no upcharge!

The plate that arrived had to be at least a foot long and it was piled high with Fries and a very generous amount of toppings! My empty tummy's dream come true!! For some reason the other people at the table assumed I got these to share....it was heartbreaking to do it, but I knew I needed to seem like a nice person and not show my inner fat self. Sharing with my husband is hard enough and has taken years of practice. But I stilled enjoyed them immensely and would certainly return to eat these specifically!!

We also shared a salad and I'm glad we ordered a large because they don't run quite as big as the loaded fries."}
{"text":"After picking our friend up from the airport, Ms. G suggested we come here to share some appetizers and dessert. It was a Friday night around 6:45p. We were told it would be a twenty minute wait, but I'm pretty sure it was more like ten. Our waitress Nancy was super friendly, but it seemed like she was stretched pretty thin - I think they're understaffed. 

Here's what we tried...

Deviled Eggs - a classic deviled egg covered with a sweet tomato sauce and topped with bacon. SO GOOD! 

Egg Rolls - solidly delicious, but probably nothing different/special from anywhere else. Basically, it made me happy because I love egg Rolls. 

Chicken Fingers - just like the egg Rolls, pretty much like what you'd find anywhere else. It's well done and can hit the spot. Also, they come with Fries which can be upgraded to truffle Fries. 

Truffle Fries - Awesome! You can actually taste the truffle flavor, unlike at so many places. The Fries are skinny cut and pretty drench in the oil. But they have enough Crunch so it didn't bother us. 

Short Rib - meh. Great flavor, but too chewy for me. Also, it was accompanied by sautéed spinach that hadn't been seasoned at all and simply tasted of the oil they'd been cooked in 

Burger - my friend Mr. P ordered this. While he enjoyed his burger, he made the mistake of getting a side of veggies instead of fries. The veggies seemed to simply be steamed and not seasoned - no good. 

Butterscotch Pudding - awesome! Definitely my favorite dessert! 

Coconut Ice Cream - much better and more exciting than most coconut ice creams out there. Not only was it full of toasted coconut shavings, but it was bursting with flavor! It almost tasted like a Samoa cookie without the chocolate. 

S'more Brownie - fail. Wouldn't get this again. While it was a generous portion, it was wider than it was deep. I was hoping for a deep dish, warm, Gooey Brownie. Instead, it was only a little thicker than a cookie and very dry. No good. 

I'd love to go back for happy hour to try more and pay a better price!"}
{"text":"A good experience. Lots of vegetarian and gluten-free options. Nice outdoor area. Friendly and knowledgable servers. If I'm in the area again, would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my meal at Yard House.  I was glad to find out it was a chain and that they are soon opening one in my area.  There are plenty of drafts and cocktails offered and specials are ever running.  The menu is diverse and has something for everyone.  Stopping in late night while on the strip was a good choice as we were able to get good food with decent portions at a reasonable price.  Service was also quick and friendly.  Can't wait to try it out again once its opens closer to home."}
{"text":"I was so sad when I went to dinner here last night and learned they no longer have their shoestring fries. It was the first thing I'd order every time to get the meal started! WHY YOU DO THIS DARDEN?! Bring back the fries please!! Service was good last night but it's usually just ok, even at the bar top... but I come here for the fries so i let it slide!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and over 130 beers is awesome! House white ale rocks and jambalaya was yummy! My date choose wisely."}
{"text":"Great for weekday HH! I went here with three of my girlfriends and we were all able to split the chicken nachos and spinach dip with plenty to go around for everyone. Just make sure to get here early since this place definitely fills up fast."}
{"text":"I've been to a few yard house locations around the valley before, but I do have to say this is probably the nicest. The location is great for some good old people watching and also reasonably priced food and drinks for being on the strip. 

On my most recent visit my boo and I shared the lobster, crab & artichoke dip along with the truffle burger. The dip was good, but definitely not proportionate to the chips and flatbread provided. As for the burger I loved it. It was cooked perfectly and I loved the unique flavor. It was just the right amount for both of us to share too. Oh and of course I can't forget their beer selection, tons on tap and three sizing options. My personal favorite was their grapefruit sandy, great for any citrus fans like me."}
{"text":"This location is definitely the busiest of them all. I came here on a Saturday night for my friends birthday party of about 15 people. She called and wasn't able to make a reservation prior, but we were  still seated within about 45-60 mins which was still pretty quick for peak time. 

The service was pretty good. Our waiter was trying very hard to make sure we had everything and constantly checked on us, but the bar was pretty slow with getting our drinks ready.

Food wise I love so many options here. This time my bae and I shared the calamari and the classic ranch salad. The calamari was pretty average, but good. The salad was a bit disappointing dressing wise, if it's called a classic ranch salad you would think I should certainly be able to taste the ranch, but not the case with this one. I recommend trying the grilled cheese or lamb burger here. Those are typically my go to options. 

Overall another great yard house location located in a central part of the valley. It's a great spot to grab dinner or a drink after a afternoon shopping spree."}
{"text":"Always good food and vibe really good happy hour food prices. If you don't go during happy hour expect to drop 25-30 dollars for a burger and a beer. Very expensive for what it is. I wish the prices weren't so crazy for this type of restaurant."}
{"text":"Food is always good. Amazing happy hour 1/2 price apps.  Try a BBQ pizza here. Hamburgers are really good."}
{"text":"Everything was yum here. Server was attentive even with a heavy crowd. 
Woodchuck was on tap. We splurged here in an over eating extravaganza.
Worth mentioning: Artichoke was hot when I requested it out quick. Now you think this would be the norm, its not. Usually everywhere ends up waiting til its cold to serve you the artichoke at least luke warm. 
We also had the mac and cheese (squared?) vegetarian style and it was really good!  Truffle fries: YES. Calamari was a hit, and my darling date enjoyed gardein chicken strips. 
My daughter (18mo) enjoyed her grilled cheese, fries and a cherry lemonade. 
The whole mean was yum. Glasses stayed filled. 
We will be back..."}
{"text":"There's not much to say here. Everybody knows about Yard House. The food is a bit overpriced unless you're taking advantage of the Happy Hour specials and I usually go only during Happy Hour. There are good choices in there: the poke nachos, onion ring tower, chicken nachos, and my favorite classic sliders. Best sliders I've ever had. It's just too bad they changed their fries."}
{"text":"I will say i have never been particularly impressed with yard house but this experience turned me off so much that i got a yelp account! 

I would like to start with the positive and say that the old 43 is an incredible drink. It is simple, boozy enough, balanced, and delicious. Also the lettuce wraps, while not the best ive had, were satisfying with flavorful sauces and the elaborate wonton bowl aspect. 

However, the service we received at the bar left a really bad taste in my mouth. Sorry to use such a hackneyed metaphor, but in this case its stale nature is fitting. 

Our bartender josh didnt start off terribly (but made no attempt to be friendly) but when it came time to pat our bill he took our cash and then disappeared. When i pointed this out to another bartender, she tracked him down and he made a big fuss about how busy he was, clearly bothered and blaming it on other guests saying how weeded he was. I am sorry but i work in the industry and this is textbook how NOT to handle being slammed.  You dont say that to a guest!

Anyway after he left to \"go get our change\" i overheard him complaining about us to another employee (!!) making exaggerated annoyed gestures in my direction and blatantly rolling his eyes. Then, when he finally came back, he asked me how much money id given him. How can you take someones money, lose track of how much they gave you, and still have the audacity to make them feel like its their fault?

The icing on the cake here was that when he  finally managed to give us our change  he said \"easy fix bro\", with no apology or eye contact, immediately giving us an annoyed cold shoulder. How insulting! 

Overall, decent food that is not worth the trouble of the bad service."}
{"text":"I like beer. I like light beers, dark beers, imports, domestics, blondes... I don't discriminate. So this place, naturally, is high on my list of places to visit when I feel like a cold one. 

Except only kinda. 

My problem is that despite the enormous collection of beers they have, which is an awesome sight, I invariably end up with the same two or three beers. So, what good is 100+ options on tap when I just need three of those? Also, this place being not near my house, how many beers can I really sample when I have to drive back in the hood? 

Still, this place is kinda cool. I'm always impressed by the amount of beer these guys must to serve on a nightly basis, and I'm impressed by what some of the bartenders seem to know about beers. On more than one occasion I've walked in and said \"Surprise me\" and gotten a delicious beer. (I've also gotten gross ones, where I drink it because I'm too cheap to waste it). 

In terms of the food, it was good. It wasn't amazing, nor was it the kind of food you get at your local dive. I had a burger, which was pretty good. My date had a salad, which didn't seem too good from where I was sitting. I wouldn't come here for the food selection, which seems fair given that this place is known for beer over food. 

All in all, I will return. I will not really go out of my way for this place, but I'll come back when I'm on this side of town."}
{"text":"Catrina was a very rude bartender. We never asked for specials, ( happy hour or discounts)  she treated us like we were trash. She needs more training behind the bar."}
{"text":"Short wait for a table, insanely huge menu.  My husband and I both got tacos, which were highly recommended by our waitress.  The rice that went with the meal was teriyaki flavored - not at all what you would expect with tacos.  I might go back to try a few more items before giving up on it completely - but this definitely would not be my first choice place to eat in Crocker Park."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great food.  Had the truffle fries, out of this world.  Pumpkin BEER very good, not too sweet."}
{"text":"I like this place. I love the bartenders. I love their knowledge of beers. While I love love love Mac-n-Cheese, I can say with an authoritative voice that \"I will pass on ordering it again.\" It was pushed on me by the staff when I had a moment most patrons have where you ask \"What do I want to eat?\" In a valley with Mac-n-cheese competition, I'll stick to my number 1 choice for this comfort food. The Yard, so so for food thus far (and I've sampled a good variety). But the beer? The beer!!! Superb!  Definitely worth visiting again and again just for the great beer, but next time I'll eat before."}
{"text":"We happened upon this location when meeting a friend for dinner.  When I showed up there was a line of about 20 people ahead of me.  i asked them to put me in first available and they said 15-20min and then 45min for a booth.

Ok, I'll wait.

Our friends showed up and my girlfriend had asked if there was a spot at the bar we could sit in the mean time.  We were there for about 10min already.  That's when she said to us. \"Your table inside is ready\"  she walked us right there and we were sat.  WOW!  that was quick!

We ordered drinks and food.  I got these jerk chicken wings for an appetizer and holy cow, they were delicious.  For my main dish I ordered a garlic noodle dish.  It definitely hit the spot.  My only beef would be that it was hard to talk with so many people inside.  I wont let that affect the rating though.

Awesome place!"}
{"text":"Ordered BBQ chicken salad. The chicken appeared uncooked. Let server know and she took it back was very nice. Manger came over said he looked at it with a \"glove\" and it was in fact cooked. Although he apologized it was nasty looking and ruined meal for others that also had chicken in their salads and were too afraid to eat theirs. Manager could have taken salad off the bill or at least given some kind of free item to make up for the incident. Won't be ordering salads with chicken if we ever go there again."}
{"text":"Go here for a good happy hour, their menu prices are pretty good and good drink options. Their nachos, pizza, and onion ring tower are my fav!! They also have the Gardin options for vegetarians which is nice"}
{"text":"I have yet to have had a bad meal or experience at YardHouse Bar n Grill. My go to place, especially when I am craving a late night meal on the light side...or traditional bar eats. Food, drinks & service have always been on point at Town Square location."}
{"text":"Like the pompous ass that I am, I generally have a no-chain-dining policy. However, I was thoughtfully presented with a gift card to Yard House by someone who knows that I love beer, so I bellied up to the bar. The beer list, as I'm sure you know by now, is a mile long, so we took a few minutes to peruse the many, many taps. It's a thoughtful beer menu, divided into various styles for ease of use. As for food, we went for a selection of 4 appetizers, sampling the Brussels sprouts, crab dip, moo shu egg rolls, and coconut shrimp. All were tasty and properly prepared. The thing that stuck with us most, though, was the service. I would be remiss if I didn't give props to the folks who stopped by frequently to make sure that we were happy. I don't think I'll be a frequent flyer here due to the many local options in the area, but if you visit, expect a good experience."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here. I had the jambalaya, our table had burgers, fish and chips and a lettuce wrapped chicken taco. Food was good and everyone was happy, our server Nicole did a nice job."}
{"text":"I honestly can't believe I haven't written a review for the Yard House at Westgate, yet.  Hubby and I have been here dozens of times, and have yet to not enjoy our meal.  The servers have always been friendly, the atmosphere is cool, the booths are comfy, the music is fun and the food has always been good.

We've had a lot of different things, so it's hard to pinpoint what we liked the best.  Hubby's main go-to is the Chicken Enchilada Stack or the Fried Chicken dinner with gravy.  I have liked the pork loin, the burgers (turkey, lamb and sliders) and the grilled cheese with tomato soup.  We also enjoy their hummus starter...tasty and just enough to get us going while we wait for our entrees.

They're open late, which is always a plus...and the place is huge, so even when it's crowded, it's nice."}
{"text":"Thing I love the most is all the beers on Tap.  Huge selection of beer.  Also huge selection of food.  Most of the things I have had were pretty good.  Their sushi rolls are definitely something different from what you are used to, more like a stack of what would be in a roll.  I used to love the food, but I find each time I go I like it a little bit less."}
{"text":"Decent place for the area, but overall very average. I would say think about going here if you're in that neighborhood, maybe for a conference or concert, because I'm sure it is about the same or better than the places in that area. However, it's not really anything special. 
Pros: There were plenty of food and drink options, so would be good for a large group. Walkable from many of the attractions there. 
Cons: Environment isn't unique. Overpriced. Food is average. The lobster Mac and cheese and crab spinach dip both  had shells in them, which was not great."}
{"text":"Ohhh I how I loathe reviewing another chain.  I have eaten here so many times and had an okay experience.

However, yesterday I was there for happy hour with a small group, and we had our share of issues.  First - for whatever reason, the waitress stacked like 7 or more menus on the table, and never picked them up.  As people came to join us outside on the patio, we had to keep moving them on top of the planter divider things that separate the patio from the sidewalk.

We ordered different flavored teas.  The waitress brought separate ice cups and was very slow to refill tea.  She also never brought the limes my friend asked for twice, until we flagged her and reminded her - she had to write it down.

For happy hour, they make the chicken lettuce wraps half off but not the mushroom - weird.  So we opted for chicken...and out they came, with the nastiest lettuce cups I have ever seen - completely brown and pink, looking rotten and absolutely inedible.  Since the waitress disappeared, I had to wait like 15 minutes before showing her and asking for new lettuce.  Quite a while later, she brought a plate with nastier, browner, pinker lettuce.  I told her no way, and she took that away to show her manager.  She took that off the bill and replaced it with another item, and luckily the protocol is to have the manager come out.  The manager apologized for the \"bad lettuce shipment,\" but I explained to her that under no circumstances should anyone in the kitchen allow nasty lettuce to be served, especially not TWICE.  I told her I strongly recommend that they do not serve lettuce to another person that day.  I hope she took my advice.  Kinda turned me off....would rather come back for beer than food now."}
{"text":"Very busy, sat at bar and ordered lobster noodles. Tasty and a large portion.
Great bartender Mitchell.
Will go back and also try in other cities"}
{"text":"Best burger I've had in my entire 25 years on this planet! (BBQ cheddar burger) 

Plus: ESDIN IS THE SHIZNIT!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"To start off, I will confess...I am already a big Yard House fan. The main reason is it's spin on comfort food and enormous beer selection. That being said...Town Center Yard House gets the fourth star rating because of it's proximity in relation to everything around: shopping, movies, and bars. 

Here, Yard House is the perfect addition to a night out at the mall. 
- Gone shopping? Get a beer. 
- Seen a movie? Get some dinner. 
- Headed to the Blue Martini for a Natural Vibrations concert? Drink here first.

The ambiance here is always great: kind of like a dark SUPER SIZED PUB full of beer selections from around the country, hell even the world. 

The food is as I said before, comfort food (or it could be the only things I decide to order). My usual order consists of either the Mac and Cheese Squared, Turkey Pot Pie, or Grilled Cheese (with bacon and tomato)/tomato soup. The M&C2 is perfect, what more could one ask of pasta, cheese, bacon, chicken, and truffle oil...brilliance in every spoonful. Turkey Pot Pie is an entire plate of turkey, cream sauce, and veggies covered in a flaky fresh crust. And Lastly, the grilled cheese is the perfect accompaniment of a cold day...or cold beer. Speaking of beer, try the sampler. Daily, the beers of choice switch up so enjoy the variety. 

Service is quick with the drinks, courteous, and fun to be around. 

Yard House in Town Center exceptional. Beware, place gets crowded pretty quick. Give it a try and see how new age comfort food is made."}
{"text":"Everything is always JUST OK every time I go. Nothing to complain about but nothing to rave about. Service is usually a little below par as expected with Yard House and nothing really knocks your socks off food wise. Beer selection is great but not a huge deal since you can get that elsewhere. Eh."}
{"text":"We started the day with a very unpleasant experience at our first attempt to dine out. That was all redeemed when we showed up at The Yardhouse! Once seated we were greeted by Kasandra, our server who turned our whole day around! She was pleasant, knowledgeable and patient. The menu here has something for everyone! We ordered drinks, I had a half yard of Anderson Valley Wild Turkey Bourbon Stout and my girlfriend had a Pineapple Express cocktail, both delicious! We started with the chicken nachos, really good, they used poached chicken, kinda weird, but still delicious! She had the lamb burger and I had the blackened chicken torta sandwich! Both equally awesome! If the food and service wasn't good enough, the manager, I assume based on his outfit, stopped by the table to check on our experience! Level 5 service right there! I highly recommend this location here at Town Center! We will definitely be back! Thanks again to Kasandra and the manager and the whole team who made this a great experience!"}
{"text":"Kinda nice food. Just had tacos. Prices are cheap. I guess people will compromise with eating mediocre dog shit these to save a buck. The foods good, but I like Capitol grill much better. Mannequin kept harassing me out front to buy pretzels. Took us about 3 hours waiting for our check on a semi busy Monday around 7pm. Fiddle sticks"}
{"text":"Very dim lighting, yet busy and lots of TV'S like a sports bar. The food was a bit pricy but flavorful and a very good presentation. The waitress and our group got off to a rocky start because of her use of an offensive word she used (r word) it was in a casual way but not needed. She did eventually slowdown and pay more attention to us. Overall the food was good, the service needed work but I liked the place"}
{"text":"Delicious food nice and attentive service . It was a nice find while traveling as my husband had yelped this place before prior to our vacation. The Ginger Salmon with wasabi  mash potatoes was delicious as well as the other dishes including Lobster noodles. I would recommend this place to family and friends. The portions are large so check with waiter in case you may want to share a plate."}
{"text":"ok for you beer fans!!! 

the yard house is on POINT!! if you want it you'll most likely find it. 

now the food is good. but then again when i went in i was starving and i think the south end of a north bound bull would have been just fine with me. 
The tender was really helpful and had a great knowledge of the selection. But i was a creature of habit, and went with a Guinness! wings, and football on saturday afternoon.."}
{"text":"We've been to this location a few times. Love the food and don't think I've ever had an issue with it. Service has been good as well. I love their burgers! We've taken our 1.5yr old with us twice but think we'll keep it as a date-night only place. Food takes a little bit to come out and she gets hangry! I don't think it'd be good for groups unless you sat on the patio, it tends to be a little loud in there. Still, it's one of our favorite places to go!"}
{"text":"I love yard house I have eaten just about everything on the menu and the only thing I didn't like was the pork belly tacos...they have rockin happy hour specials and the selection of beer especially my favorites by STONE are great. The staff is always super friendly and very knowledgeable of the beer and menu although I do always sit at the bar.  The atmosphere  is very up-beat and it was a great place to watch the super bowl or any game I guess."}
{"text":"Located in the middle of the pedestrian walk, under the High Roller is The Yard House. The night we went it was a bit crowded, but what place isn't crowded on the Vegas Strip.  We waited about 30 minutes, but during the wait, I meandered over to the street side bar and had a cold one. Very convenient, but that too can get a little backed up.  The menu had a variety food options. I had a craving for fried chicken, so I ordered it. The plate presented well, but I was on the fence on the chicken. When I see fried chicken on a menu, I anticipate a crunchy outside and tender inside...and a bone. Dang this chicken was boneless. Totally ruined my salivation. But oh well. I gave this place a 4 only because it's an awesome place to visit. The atmosphere is typical of a bar/restaurant scene. The beer, OMG so many taps of so many kinds of barley. Perfect place for beer drinkers. I would definitely come back though."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. The staff here is very friendly. I like the fact you don't have to walk through the casino to enter the restaurant. This Yard House location is at the North side of the Red Rock Casino right next to Lucille's. They have a huge dining area that includes outdoor seating. There is also a nice sized bar with a great selection of beer and cocktails.

I have been there several times and I have not had a bad experience ever. The burgers, apps, steaks, and salads are all very good. I was actually surprised how good the NY Strip was the first time I ordered it there.

I definitely recommend stoping in to the Yard House."}
{"text":"Great food, and I was told the beer was amazing. I think they have over 60 flavors. When you walk in you see all of the kegs. I was in town for a business conference. Had dinner one night, and lunch another. The food was above average and they had a nice unique menu."}
{"text":"Went on monday at 6, nice decor with tons of taps, cool bar. Ashley served us, she was excellent. I had mojitos with BlackBerry and yuzu, sugary but good. The crab roll and 2 tacos, pretty good too. Our server even brought us complimentary apple pie cobbler. That was really tasty. I will go back!"}
{"text":"Food was great! Had the quest dip & mini dessert. Very tasty! Great service- nice and accommodating. TVs all over for sports games. Nice patio. Very reasonably priced, especially by Vegas standards!"}
{"text":"Quite an array of beer selections. Being a avid beer drinker I greatly appreciate the variety Yardhouse has. 

Their menu can at first glance be a little overwhelming but having a pretty decent description of their dishes certainly eases the anxiety."}
{"text":"Can you say \"Happy Hour\"

3-6pm you can't beat the selection of beers on tap and the appetizer menu is killer!

We have gone there twice this week and might be going again."}
{"text":"Even though the Yard House is always crowded the food is great, drinks affordable and service pleasant. They have these fried duck legs appetizers very crispy and worth the try."}
{"text":"Cuban Pork Sandwich = tasteless and not worth the calories. It looks really good, but this tastes like it could have come from Chili's or Denny's.

I do have to hand it to them for the number of big screens showing the various sporting events and of course the healthy selection of beers."}
{"text":"I have never been as impressed with the level of customer service at Yard House as I have been with Angelica today. The drinks and food were great but the experience was that much better because of our server, Angelica."}
{"text":"I love Yard House because of the atmosphere, the quality of food and the service! It's usually always busy on weekends but that's totally fine I don't mind waiting 20-30 mins because I love their Mac & Cheese squared! It's the best! You get chicken, bacon and mushrooms! YES!!! Oh so yummy!! 

PLUS!! They always have some promos going on whether it's Happy Hour, lunch specials or cheap pints! 

AND!!! They have TVs everywhere and a huge selection of beers! 

From the huge selection of beers and food, to the quality of service and presentation of food; Yard House is a foto spot to just enjoy a nice evening and watch some sports! It's causal but it's a nice place for date night too!"}
{"text":"They have like 200 beers or so! and at happy hour we all pig out! The best thing on the menu is the sliders w/ sweet potato fries. The crab artichoke dip is good too. Usually packed on the weekends and at night time but food is worth it."}
{"text":"Literally no complaints!  Even the super picky hubs was pleased. Poke nachos were spectacular!  I had the pork burger with candied bacon and blueberry jam. It was amazing. The hubs had the blackened chicken sandwich that he says is the best sandwich he's ever had.  One of our friends got the lobster mac that had HUGE chunks of lobster and he said was great as well. Friendly service. Crazy long beer list. Highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Great Service and food. Bartenders/servers are very tentative and there is never a wait. Food is out withing 10-15 minutes of ordering. One of my favorite neighborhood restaurants to grab a bite to eat and a drink."}
{"text":"I love happy hour at the Yard House! Everything on the menu is so delicious! Save room for s'mores brownie for desert. It's a winner!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this restaurant chain mediocre simply because the last time I was there, I ordered a burger and it was the worst burger I've ever eaten. The meat was tasteless; cardboard would have more flavor, but that's what i ate, I ate cardboard. The bun was dried out and the top was flaking due to freezer burn. I'd rather of ordered a burger from McDonalds and would of enjoyed it more. C'mon Darden...this was a decent restaurant before you took it over, don't screw it up!"}
{"text":"Just as good the one in Scottsdale, AZ. Great bartenders, lots of TV and lots of great beer on tap."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go for reverse happy hour! They have good food (ahi poke, wings, sliders) for a great price and a LOT of beer on tap."}
{"text":"Yard House has a cool atmosphere that I love having a beer or two in. The happy hour is awesome and the selection of beers on tap is amazing.

I like to sit at the bar because the bartenders are very attentive to your needs.  I really enjoy that they have the option of \"shorty\" glasses to try a couple new beers that you've been curious about.

Food wise the chopped salad is impressive. The seared ahi steak sandwich is really good, so much so that I've ordered it several times instead of trying something new.

Yard House is priced accordingly for Town Square, so I'd advise to hit up happy hour for good deals on food. Definitely check it out though anytime for a beer or two."}
{"text":"I'll start with the positives first (there aren't many). It's an impressive looking place and it is clearly very popular in the early going. Ok, now on to the bad stuff.

The food was bad. Granted, I ordered takeout and some food just doesn't travel well. But still, it was extremely disappointing and some of it was just inedible.

My wife ordered the Banh Mi. Specifically, I asked for the bun on the side to avoid soggy bread and the hostess doubled checked my order as I paid. When I got home, the bread was soggy and nasty. There was a nasty mayo sauce of some sort on the sandwich. The short rib was all fat and and had no flavor. Gross. Nothing good about the sandwich, and the coleslaw on the side was very bland and flavorless.

We ordered a chicken Caesar kale salad. Also bad. It's supposed to come with pistachios, raisins and Brussels sprouts. I counted two sprouts and there was nothing special about the chicken. Also, I asked if the ranch (yes I ordered ranch for my Caesar salad) was homemade and the hostess told me it was. Sure didn't taste that way. 

Finally, we had the chicken with wild rice. Once again, no flavor and very uninspired. There wasn't any sauce either.

All in all, for $37 I would have expected a lot better. We will not be back and wouldn't recommend the food. Maybe I'll stop in for a beer sometime."}
{"text":"I would have to say this was probably the best restaurant we ate at the three nights we were in Vegas every place else was mediocre to say the least. The only complaint was the waiter did not hear my husband say he wanted the ribeye with shrimp so instead he just got the ribeye without the shrimp, no big deal. We had a view of the highroller which we rode on after dinner. The lobster mac & cheese was delicious I could not eat all of it.  Prices were fair which is not what I could say for most of the other dining options on the strip."}
{"text":"Wide selection of alcoholic beverages!!! This place was beautiful and clean! I can here with a friend to have some drinks to celebrate my graduation!  The music wasn't so loud so we weren't yelling at each other.  The customer service was absolutely amazing!! The chicken nachos was definitely more than plenty for a party of 2 and very filling.  These people are not shy on the toppings!  Would definitely recommend this place for a nice dinner date or celebrating with friends!"}
{"text":"We are staying @ the Red Rock Casino in Summerlin, Las Vegas. We were so hungry and went in to the Yard House in the casino for happy hour. We ordered California Roll, Spicy Tuna Roll and what a surprise. It wasn't a roll, instead it looked like a dessert. I was hoping it was tasty, but I took one bite and almost spit it back out. We also ordered Boneless Chicken Wings and Egg Rolls, and what a big mistake. Chicken was so salty, I couldn't eat it, Egg Rolls were so dry and not very tast at all. We didn't eat much, & bartender asked if we wanted a box. Me and my boyfriend looked at each other, and said no. We were so hungry, and we just couldn't eat the damn food. Awful experience ever. How do they stay in business?"}
{"text":"Tom T. Hall said it best it best when he said \"I like beer. It makes me a jolly good fellow\" - this place claims to have the world's largest selection of draft beer, and while I have not completed the research (would love to start), it had an impressive selection. The menu had 2 full pages of beer...that being said, I had water...I went with a friend for lunch before the University of Phoenix graduation ceremonies on Friday. Right around lunch time and with the early graduation already out and the afternoon starting a few hours later I figured it would be busier. Not the case. We went with a selection of various products from the menu - starting with the lobster, artichoke dip. Can you say yummy? That really hit the spot. Next we enjoyed the mixed greens salad, which really, well, it's a salad...and I try to avoid salads, but it was good. Next up was the prime rib French dip sandwich. The size was impressive - bigger than the one a few weeks ago at the Phoenix Greyhound Park and fairly tasty. The server was maybe just a touch slow. He was there at the beginning, but then as the time crunch hit, nowhere to be found. Typical. We unfortunately had to leave without dessert -but I would give it another go."}
{"text":"ate here for the first time. i a grilled cheese and tomato bisque....grilled cheese was to die for. the soup was salty but i dont salt my food too much so that is normal. would eat here again. server was very nice and attentive."}
{"text":"I came here for a double date last minute since our restaurant of choice failed to come through. Though they were pretty busy, they managed to accommodate us and service us quickly. I had their teriyaki chicken with pineapple and brown rice. Needless to say, they nailed it. The chicken was cooked to perfection and was not overtly sweet. This is a great place to just hang out, have a little celebration, or a last minute date arrangement."}
{"text":"Typical yard house with great beer selection (which Wih yard house I like they focus on large domestic beers in addition to craft - too many of these large brew pubs frown on the domestics - yard house caters to all) 

Food was good and service was excellent.  Lots of tvs making it a good sportsbar as well. 

Definitely a good consistent go to place to start off the night."}
{"text":"Went to the yardhouse for the first time yesterday and was disappointed. Our waitress was very nice and the seating was fast, however I could tell she was reiterating a script about how they're known for their beers, it came off as very nonchalant. However our drinks were never empty and she did make good suggestions as to what to order. My boyfriend ordered a burger medium rare, and it came out very far (wish I had a picture) the fries also seemed very bland and as if they were Mae for little kids. I ordered rib nachos which sounded and looked better than they tasted. It came with what they call \"red sauce\" and just seemed like they didn't fit the platter. Also they arranged everything on the plate into piles I.e clumps of cilantro then a clump of red sauce. The rib strips were cut very huge to where one rib couldn't even fit on one chip. Honestly I could make these tacos at home which is why I would not return here, paid $10 for tortilla strips and shredded cheddar cheese."}
{"text":"This has been the friendliest Yard House I've visited. The service was on point when I came for lunch. I was given an option to sit outside and I'm glad I did because it was a beautiful day. I ordered the 12 oz steak that came along with lightly salted, crisp green beans and mashed potatoes, I also got the onion ring tower. Everything was cooked just right and although my medium cooked steak appeared to be almost well done (I like to see a bit red in my steak), it was tender and juicy. What I loved about my meal was Yard House's homemade butter and steak sauce, everything paired well together. I will come back for the pork belly tacos!"}
{"text":"Love Love Love the poke nachos.  They are always busy because they are in the mall.  Expect to wait for a table on the weekends. The food never disappoints and the service is always good.   They have a large menu and large beer selection. There's something for everyone!"}
{"text":"Food? Rough. Like real meals are not the best. On par or worse than Applebee's. Made me super sick to my stomach. Had to ask for salt for my fried chicken. The drinks are bomb. The waiters are nice. Food is gross. My apple cobbler was not good either. The beer and drinks were good. The atmosphere was good too."}
{"text":"This place has quality food all the way around. I love the crazy amount gardein options they have. My only complaint is that they don't have any vegetarian options on the lunch menu."}
{"text":"The beer and food were amazing! Had a slight problem with my food, but the manager was so amazing I am completely bought in to this place. Great atmosphere too!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time for happy hour recently and all I can say is.. wow. 

I'd give the server 5 stars.. he was extremely busy but was able to give us plenty of attention and fit everyone's orders in before happy hour ended. He had excellent menu knowledge and gave good advice on food and drink selections. Don't know if every server there is similar but if so, then this place is gold. 

My favorite was the chicken lettuce wraps. FAN-tastic. We ordered plenty of food... 2 different pizzas and crab cakes. The crab cakes were \"o-k\" and the pizzas were what I expected.. but wow those lettuce wraps. I highly recommend them. They have beer \"tasting\" flights, which 2 of our friends ended up ordering. If you are a beer drinker, this place is heaven! I didn't care much for my martini but I think it just wasn't for my taste. 

I've had a bite of my friend's take-out turkey burger from here and that is definitely a 5-star turkey burger! I can't wait to go back and order it next time :)"}
{"text":"Service was excellent but it took forever to get anything after ordering.  I felt that the food was \"meh\" at best.  Place was packed and definitely a popular spot, but for the money.....I won't be going back here anytime soon.  The Buffet at this place is amazing and totally affordable with a ton of choices!  My business is going back to the buffet in the future!"}
{"text":"Excellent selection of beers on tap. I would highly recommend coming here during happy hour, which is currently between 3pm and 6pm on weekdays and 10pm until close on Sunday through Wednesday. I believe most of their draft beers and many of their appetizers are half price. Otherwise, prepare to spend quite a bit (for my taste anyway).

I've really only been here a few times. Each time, I've been able to find a beer that has been really enjoyable. On my most recent visit last night, I had a Delirium Tremens (a Belgian Strong Ale) and an Alaskan Amber (also an ale). I believe I once had the Delirium Tremens at the Freakin' Frog and it was almost $10. Here it was around $5.

Honestly, I've always liked the idea of Yard House, but it's not a place I go to often. If it's happy hour, I definitely recommend it, especially if you want to try a new beer."}
{"text":"I love the vegan/vegetarian options!  Always great service & drink options"}
{"text":"If you are a beer lover this is the place to go! they have a large selection of beers...
If you like a light and easy beer you can't go wrong with the Kona Longboard. They also have happy Hour special on appetizers from Monday - Friday 3pm - 6pm  and 
Sunday - Wednesday 10pm - Close"}
{"text":"Best thing about the Yard House is the beer selection, which is great.  I had the Kung Pao calamari app and my girlfriend and coconut shrimp and both were pretty good.  She had mix and match tacos which were pretty uninspired. I had salmon with wasabi mashed potatoes. Nothing to complain about, but not real memorable."}
{"text":"Really 3.5 stars.  

The food is alright but its  overpriced.   The service however was wonderful.  They were kind and quick.  They forgot my friends order but they apologized and made an effort to fix and redeem themselves.   I don't think ill be coming back but its a good option for the westgate area."}
{"text":"Close to Scottsdale fashion square. Great late night hours. Yummy fish n chips! The staff is all very nice."}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times and I've never had anything but a great experience.  Service and food is always fantastic.  Check out happy hour, you can get some fantastic drink and food specials.

Last night we went for Happy Hour before heading over to see a movie, had the Margareta pizza (half off on Happy Hour special) it was delicious.  Service was quick and friendly and the outdoor area is super comfortable.  I especially love the outdoor lounge seating, not just tables.  It's nice when you're just grabbing some drinks with friends to not have to sit at a dining table.

The beer selection is amazing, but so is the rest of the menu.  Also they have an entire vegetarian section of the menu now which is great, my only complaint (which is a preference thing more then anything) is that I wish they didn't all contain Gardin products, I wish a few of those items were just veggie items.  But you can also find meatless options in other portions of the menu."}
{"text":"Went last night to yardhouse and had delicious chicken nachos and Parmesan crusted chicken and it was wonderful. But the highlight of the evening was my dinner was soraya. She had a great smile and great personality and had excellent service skills. I would say she is 1 of the best food servers I have ever had. Her knowledge and expertise were wonderful and she gave a great experience. She deserves 10 stars!!!!"}
{"text":"They have good happy hour specials from 3-6. $2 off of domestic pints and a \"yard\" 32 oz beer for $9. I think there were a couple other specials for wine and well drinks too. Amazing selection of draft beers here. The service was attentive. There are also happy hour specials on food. I tried the tofu lettuce wraps and they were amazing. They even offered to bring out more lettuce cups when I was on my last one but still had more tofu, which I really appreciated."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere of this restaurant are perfect and blow my taste buds away.  Most of the staff stopped and smiled, however, the waitress that my family and I had went above and beyond for us! Very sweet woman; however, her name escapes me! I definitely say eat here!!! Classy!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Last year for my birthday, my homies and I went to this restaurant right before we went on the High Roller! I had a VERY delicious steak and my bestie had a pasta dish with soy chicken. He did let me try some, and it was so good! The service was wonderful and the whole atmosphere was very relaxing and fun! Great birthday experience!"}
{"text":"Servers are friendly, great beer selection, and a lovely vegetarian menu."}
{"text":"Great happy hour and beer selection. The food is above average which is very hard for a large selection menu. The happy hour prices are spot on and you get large portions. I have been here several times and the service is always fairly good."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and staff. Expect a wait - but well worth it! Food comes out fast and most importantly - as ordered. Flavor is average but very tasty - choices are many. Great bar as well, with an unbelievable beer selection."}
{"text":"I have heard many reviews on this place but I have finally had the opportunity to go myself. I ordered a burger, medium rare, and it was cooked perfectly. The array of burgers that they had was very different, I like the variety. They had my favorite beer as well. I think they were a bit high on their prices but for a nice splurge on a good burger, its worth it. The restaurant itself was very nice as well, lots of windows and the staff was very polite."}
{"text":"Good. Really good. Really, really good! A little pricey and worth it. THE place to eat and drink at Town Square!"}
{"text":"I came , I saw, I drank that was pretty much it. The place is loud, not good to converse and get to know someone.  Happy hour is good!"}
{"text":"We always go to yard house
We order chicken nachos 
But today the nachos was not good the chips was different a lot of salsa with little cheese
Even the slider didnt taste good , did they change the cook???"}
{"text":"I've been here plenty of times, so this post is pretty specific for the burger i ordered tonight.

Came here tonight unexpectedly but as part of my burger rampage week, I decided to order the gorgonzola burger.  I actually enjoyed it a lot.  The burger came out really hot and it burned my mouth since i took a fatty first bite.  It comes with mushrooms and baby spinach which i love and the size of the patty was nice and thick.  I ordered it medium and it was perfect.  Sometimes when i order medium rare it comes all too soft and the burger ends up falling apart.  

The only downside to this burger is that the bun is a little tough and its a little pricey.  Other than that, it was goooood."}
{"text":"We always have a good time at this location! The food is always tasty and the service is great!"}
{"text":"We went to the soft opening. We didn't have reservations and thought it was actually already open for business but the staff accommodated us and everything was great. We went again for the OSU/MSU game and although it was crowded in the bar the staff was great. They work well as a team. Our bar tender checked on us anytime we had an empty glass. We ended up staying for dinner and to our surprise when the manager came to check on us he told us our meal was on him. We have been impressed both times we have been there and it is definitely our new favorite spot. I personally don't like \"chain restaurants\" but this doesn't have that feel. The food is made from scratch and tastes like it is. So far I've had the Nashville hot chicken and one of the chicken sandwiches. Both were great. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place great ambiance, great food options, and great drink options. 

A place to check out! It's level of variety is of that of Cheesecake Factory where there are options galore. The quality is pretty awesome, better than I expected! 
The ambiance is awesome as well very much like old light rocking roll music playing. 

I would say it's definitely a place to check out when you are tired of the usual. I would not recommend if you are starving as portions are medium to small but not everything is like that.

The lobster spinach dip was awesome and you get a good amount. My boyfriend order the southern chicken with the sweet potato cakes (can't remember exact name) but his portion was smaller than mine. I order the southern chicken that came with potatoes mashed and baked beans I had leftovers."}
{"text":"so yeah i've passed by yard house a million times and well for the first time in years my friend wanted to eat so we walked in got a table ordered and i must say this place was really bit of a let down ..got steak sandwich...steak had zero flavor i would come again but next time i'll try something else"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, we sat outside. Our server Vincent was great. The fried chicken was so delicious, the truffle Mac n cheese was ok would not order again though. You have got to try the brownie you order it baked just the way you like it."}
{"text":"I have been going here a lot lately. Here is my take. This is one of the best bars with food in Vegas. There is a ton of beers on tap & the menu is one of the fanciest & most diverse, that I have ever seen in a bar. I am not saying that this is the best restaurant, even though it is better than most. In  the Red Rock Casino, there are many places to eat, for the price, this is one of the best & better than the Cafe by a wide margin. 

The downside: Yes, it is loud. It is not a good place to bring kids. During peak hours, you may have to wait to get a table. They only have shoe string French Fries. Portion size is on the smaller side.

The Pluses: Great menu. BEERS! Very friendly, attractive staff. Open later than most of the Red Rock other restaurants. Not packed with kids like BJ's Brewery across the street. Reasonable prices, for the quality of food that they serve. Fast service."}
{"text":"*PLEASE NOTE: this is not a review of the quality of food or staff overall, but solely TODAY'S dining experience with a particular server. Maybe she's new, who knows?

Patience run thin here today. Which I don't understand, because it's usually my favorite Yardhouse location to come to in town...

Came in 10 before 3 (it's 4:10 as I'm writing this) as I'm writing about this, for reference and it wasn't busy for it being the start of happy hour. I get sat quickly enough, but my server doesn't come to even take a drink order for 10 minutes. Ok, whatever. No big deal.

When she arrives, I ask for a Grey Goose martini extra dirty and water. The water arrives and so does my meal, a small ahi crunch salad, but no martini. I watched it get made at the bar from my booth and sit at the bar while my server grabbed other drinks for her tray (maybe there wasn't enough room?), walk between the server's POS station and the host stand, take the order of the table next to me, AND serve their drinks. In the midst of all of that, I stopped another server to say that I think that drink at the bar is mine and she told me she'd inform my server.... my server comes back to apologize for the wait and she's just waiting on the bartender to actually make it to bring to me... walks over, picks up the SAME martinis and brings it to me. And it was extra dry, not extra dirty. Go figure.

But wait! There's more!

I ask another passerby server if I can send it back and have it remade, and they again informed my server who came to ask what was wrong with my order and I explained politely but ended up not wanting a drink at all. I asked for my food menu back in the interest of ordering sliders to go and that took another 15 minutes so I decided against another food order and requested the check, which has just been presented to me. It's another table's check, for a bunch of happy hour cocktails and fries, etc... remember how I said I only had a small ahi salad? I deducted another star by the end of this review."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times in the past 9 months and the food is GREAT!  I actually work in Town Square and will definitely be coming back more often.  The first time I ate there I sat at the bar, ordered the lunch special Margherita pizza with a ceaser salad. It was GREAT!  The second time was last Saturday and I ordered The grilled shrimp and was Very disappointed at the small amount of food I got on the grilled shrimp plate (for 15.00) but it was very good.  I went back the next day, ordered Chicken nachos for 12.00 and the plate was HUGE. The food tasted very fresh and every bite was delectable!  Their beer selection is incredible and I can tell they clean their taps often.  The waiter experiences were good 2 out of 3 times.Its hard to find good food that tastes fresh in Vegas and this is my new addiction"}
{"text":"This use to be one of our favorite places for dinner and drinks. But each time we've gone, the food quality has gotten worse. Last time we went, almost each person in a party of five was so dissatisfied with their dinner. Finally, someone from our party made a complaint. They sent someone out and simply asked if we wanted to have our table cleared. No apologies or anything. And yes we paid for everything from the drinks, appetizers, and bad dinner. And of course fully tipped our server even though we'd had to wait for a long time just to get refills. Maybe they need to stop experimenting with their menus so they can keep up but also need to keep in mind their repeat customers and provide better customer service. Definitely will not be our go to place anymore."}
{"text":"Willie was very knowledgeable & happy to suggest samples to try. He knows his beers. Comfortable patio seating. Good for people watching."}
{"text":"BAM! this place pops.  Had the chicken wings and some drinks.... Man those wings were perfect.  Great place to bring the friends for lunch and have an overall great mental get away... Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We have Yard House here in Denver and like to go there for a decent, sit down meal or a good happy hour. 

We ate here on our last day and couldn't decide where to go, so we went here cause we knew it would be good. 

Service was good. But seemed long time periods between checking on us. 

We both had the 1/2 salad, 1/2 sandwich. He had the french dip and really enjoyed it. I had the Roasted Turkey Club. Thumbs up. 

We love the Onion Ring Tower. When we do happy hour drinks and apps, we ALWAYS get that one. 

Lots of TVs for sports. Large booths, high top tables, large menu, TONS of beers to choose from."}
{"text":"Normally like this place. Today we asked for the brussels without potatoes. The reply was \"we can give you Brussels-only but we will just take away the potatoes, you won't get extra Brussels.\"  Seemed very rigid. Also, very warm beer today. Yard House is too expensive to get sub-standard fare and poor service."}
{"text":"The rudest staff I've ever been around, took my service animal and a few friends there for lunch and probably the worst experience ever.  It started upon entrance when we told one of the 3 hosts we wanted a table at the bar and she said animals weren't allowed in the restaurant,  reluctantly she pointed us toward the bar which was around the corner and down the hall.  We sat down at a booth and a bitchy waitress came over and told us we needed to see the hostess and couldn't sit there, and animals weren't allowed in the restaurant.  We explained we just talked to the hostess and she told us it was open seating, the bitchy waitress rolled her eyes and walked away.  Then the manager came over and told me my service animal which is a 3.8 pound dog couldn't sit in the booth with me and had to be on the floor.  The same bitchy waitress then came back to take our drink order, 10 minutes after she took the order we still hadn't received our drinks.  We got up and left, won't be coming back.  It seems like the biggest issue was my service animal I guess yard house doesn't want people with disabilities dining in their restaurants."}
{"text":"Wandering around on my final day in Vegas I happened upon there great happy hour deals at this place.  They have quite a few discount food items and drink specials but, I was just here to partake in some food.

I took a seat at the bar and was quickly greeted by a bartender.  The menu is huge in addition to the happy hour deals.  Another bartender came up to take my order and I ordered calamari, egg rolls and the shitake mushroom garlic noodles.  The bartender looked at me and said you do know that they are full size orders for happy hour?  I said yes I do, um I like food and we both laughed.

Some nice tourists from Utah sat next to me and we had some great conversation before my food arrived.  The shitake mushroom garlic noodles were my favorite part of the order.  They were light with a hearty full flavor sauce that stuck to the noodles well.  This was probably enough to fill me up in hindsight.  The calamari was a 4 star dish but, the egg rolls were just ok in my book.

This is one of the better happy hours on the strip for pricing vs. food quality.  The bartenders were spot on with their service and I would definitely stop back by the next time I am in town."}
{"text":"I'm only giving this place 3 stars because of their beer selection. It was the only saving grace to their mediocre food. The carnitas enchilada stack was not hot and the meat tastes reheated. The steak salad had more potato chips on it then lettuce and wasn't really the healthier option it appeared to be. Lastly the calamari is cut way to thick and is super chewy."}
{"text":"After and independent of a UYE, when I join my Yelp friends for socializing at the Yard House, it becomes the Yelp House. The Yard House is a fun place for groups of friends to hang out over beer and good food. The restaurant does a commendable job accommodating large groups. Both times that I went to the Yard House we had no problem getting a large table. The service is precise. And when it is time to pay, we had our own checks. Substitute Yelpers for a gathering of general friends, or a date and the Yard House is everybody's social house.

  The Yard House is my choice chain restaurant for beer selection. The Yard House is to beer what Baskin Robbins is to ice cream. Whereas Baskin Robbins features 31 flavors of ice cream,, the Yard House features approximately 600 flavors of beer (I counted the beer listed in the menu). If I were to go to the Yard House one Friday a week to order a flavor of beer, according to my math it would take me 12 years to done this. Or if I were to go to the Yard House everyday to try a flavor of beer, it would take me 2 years to do this. Some of the beers may have been listed under a couple of different headings. The deal is that the Yard House selection of beer is as good as it gets. 

  There are eleven series of beer. There is the chalkboard series. The cider series is the seasonals. The light beer is less than 5.8% alcohol content. This series includes many of the name brands such as Michelob and Budweiser. There is the Honey Fruit series which includes BBC Strawberry Blonde and Blue Point Blueberry. There is the wheat series that includes Blue Hawaiin Hefeweizen. The Malty series includes Bass Ale and Alaskin Amber. The Dark series includes Big Sky Moose Drool and Bison Organic Chocolate. The bitter series includes Anchor Liberty and Blue Point Hoptical Illusion. And there is the Strong and Effervescent series. The menu lists the alcohol content. Unless I overlooked something, the Allagash Curieux is the strongest at 11% alcohol content. There are three sizes of beer. I went for the middle size which is the pint. For the record I greatly appreciated the Firestone.

  This very Yard House features a Happy Hour and Late Night Specials. The Happy Hour is Monday-Friday 3-6 pm and Late Night Special Sunday-Wednesday 10-close. They include domestic pints from $4.25-$5.75, well drinks $4.27-$4.75 and wine by glass $2 off. If you are up to food there are half price appetizers & pizza.

  The food is good but I've tasted better. My complaint about the roasted turkey club is that it was layers of sandwich instead of the sandwich I am accustomed to. The classic cheeseburger was a good choice. The fries are these skinny things that remind me of potato sticks. I feel that the Yard House ought to expand their fries selection to include steak fries and just thicker fries.

  When I socialize at a restaurant, I am big on the music that is playing. I was won over by the music playing. I heard great music from Led Zeppelin, the Rolling Stones and classic rock era.

  The Yard House excells at their selection of beer. Whether it is my Yelp House or social House I intend to return. When I return I plan to try the Blue Point Blueberry beer that is brewed in Blue Point, NY; 5 miles south of where I lived. Gotta be patriotic to my home town.

{"text":"I used to love that place. Very disappointed about the service. Came for celebrating a friend s birthday. From the beginning the waiter was really unpleasant. Took forever to have just 4 drinks on a Tuesday night with a restaurant half busy, one of us order a salad to go with his burger, got the salad before the burger and even before our drinks. Then finally after a while got our food, 3 of us order burgers and fries (2 of us got fries not really warm but for the 3rd one he didn't even get his fries because they were not ready, so he got his burger without fries, only once we finished his burger the fries finally came).
And top of the top, we were still working on our food for some of us and some we had finish, the waiter brought the birthday cake without even paying attention we didn't finish to eat or thinking to clean the table a little !"}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour! Drinks are really cheap for what it usually costs to drink on the strip, and the happy hour food is really good. We usually split items from the happy hour menu and make an early dinner out of it. 

Our favorites include the cheese curds, pizzas, and wings. But if you're only going to get one thing, get the cheese curds, you won't regret it. They are delicious with the honey and ranch dipping sauces."}
{"text":"Walked in at 11:36pm. Host ask, r u here for drinks? We were like, no! We want food coz it said that restaurants open till midnight. FYI, last call for foods at 11:30pm. We just left. They should let people order if they get in before midnight. Why last call 11:30? Maybe change the restaurant hours to 11:30 closing not midnight then. False advertisement!"}
{"text":"Outstanding! Took entire family there and everybody got something they loved- Steak sandwich was outstanding per Dad! My vegan burger rocked! Hundreds of beers to goose from and descent wine list.  Great value- cheap for what the give you.  Definitely go here and you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"This is a standard, yet always dependable place to meet friends and have lunch or dinner. they have some really good food and always consistant on the flavor and service. I will always come back!"}
{"text":"The perfect place if you want to over pay for crap food, service, and an atmosphere so loud you walk out with a headache.

We waited for nearly 20 minutes right next to the table we would be seated at.  The best part, it was empty the whole time.

Food came out cold, even if it were hot, it wouldn't be that good.  Way over priced although the one redeeming factor which makes it a two star was that coffee ice cream dessert.

Go to BJ's across the street!"}
{"text":"What a 180 degrees from my last restaurant.  Service was excellent, thank you Jade! The food was great. Had the Pork Belly and Short Rib Street Tacos, while the Pork Belly could have been been spicer, it was still tasty.  The rest of our party were equally satisfied.  The only down side is the noise, but then I am old.  I will go back."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar last night (Saturday)  and ordered a prime rib dip. The sandwich was horrible. The meat tasted and looked like rubber.  (Just a couple small slices tucked in were edible.)  I would have liked the chef to come out and taste it in front of me AND  I should have returned it for something different but I was needing to get home quickly.  My dogs enjoyed it however."}
{"text":"Seriously I have 17 checkins here and never wrote a review?  What is wrong with me?! We'll it's about time. Last week for happy hour my wife and we had a sweet server named Julia. A very upbeat girl with a very pleasant smile and great attitude. She took our orders and away she went. I got the sliders and my wife gets the same thing every time. Lettuce wraps. I always get the leftovers so I'm glad she gets them. Our drinks arrived quickly as well as our meals. I had a Samuel Adams, wife, glass of wine. With 17 check ins we've never had a bad or even average time here. Service is always amazing as well as the food and atmosphere. Its always one of our \"go to\" places when we have a hard time agreeing where to go. I'm sure we'll be back in a week or so."}
{"text":"A little more upscale then my typical bar, I opt to come out here for a happy hour. What a steal. From 3-6pm, there's a great deal on their drafts and a wide variety of food. Many of their foods can be sampled for less than half their normal priced. 

Out of the few times I've visited here, I normally end up trying their chicken nachos and a pizza between a table of friends. You can get well-fed and obtain a decent buzz for relatively cheap. They've got a huge assortment of beers on tap and they're willing to let you try a couple for free if you ask.  

This is a new spot in Crocker Park over the past few years and it's definitely worth checking out if you're in the area. During the summer time, the patio proves to be an excellent spot to soak in the good weather and try some new beers."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, and sitting outside was definitely the way to go for a gorgeous Arizona evening in March. Our server was kind, patient, attentive, and took great care of us.  The main problem with this place is the food. While some items on the menu may be delicious, no one at our table of six loved anything.  I found myself staring longingly at Buffalo Wild Wings across the way as I gnawed on my $12 sandwich.  Go here for the beer, not the vittles."}
{"text":"Love Yard House! This location is busy, but the wait time is not too bad. The food is always good, the drinks are great, and the wait staff is always kind. Highly recommend visiting this location."}
{"text":"Late night happy hour bar menu... pizza was just okay... draft beer could have been colder. Staff was great and super friendly. Atmosphere is awesome... very cool vibe. I had already closed out but was still drinking my last beer... but Exactly at 12 midnight, the lights went up to full bright which was their way of saying, \"Get Out\". A little rude, I through. Most places just let you sit, while they are cleaning up, to finish your last drink. I basically left a half of beer since they never called, \"last call\", I didn't know we were going to be pushed out. I will probably go back to try something off of the regular menu."}
{"text":"I really liked my meal at the Yard House. I had a turkey cheese burger, and it was phenomenal. However, when the meal prices and appetizer prices are the same, there is a problem Houston. I am sorry but apps should be WAY cheaper than the actual meal. And honestly the food is good, but not that good. Even the burgers were at least $12-15 price range. I do not think that is fair, especially for what is a chain restaurant. I am not saying that I would never go back, but it would not be my first place of choice to go for a meal. Again if I am going to spend this much the food better be phenomenal. The service was not bad, the food came out in a reasonable amount of time as we had an extremely large party. Really, there is no reason for their sandwiches and burgers to be outrageous. I don't like beer but I always think breweries are very cool, and most of the guys that I was with drink beer and seem to like it. Food was good but I was not blown away. Spend your money wisely kids! You could have had a four- five star review if this was more reasonable. Good food does not need to be over priced, Amen."}
{"text":"Okay, yes - this is a chain. But, you guys...it's like going to Starbucks and knowing that your pumpkin spice latte is going to be exactly the same every time you go. Yardhouse is great consistency.  Their food is solid and their selection of beers is massive.  

I've been to this location several times and it's much better than the one in the Linq.  It's a good vibe and not ridiculously overpriced.  Last time I went, I had the cobb salad (basic, much like the pumpkin spice reference, I know) and it was great - it had a couple things (like edamame) that took it up a notch as well.  

Things that are great here: sweet potato fries, basically all the appies, and of course - the beer.  If you're looking for a great sports bar or a nice lunch spot, Yardhouse is legit."}
{"text":"Love this place. The food and service is always great. Just found my new favorite here which is the Nashville hot chicken. It's so delicious!!!"}
{"text":"The newest restaurant at the Red Rock Casino, that delivers! I'm not usually a big fan of chains since I want to support my local businesses, but this place deserves a lot of credit. However, like all new restaurants this place does have some pitfalls. 

@ Parmesan Crusted Chicken - Chicken was cook perfectly with a nice crusty exterior. The chicken wasn't the least bit dry like Hash House A Go Go. While the sun-dried tomatoes and 3 mushroom sauce was delicious, it felt kind of heavy and a little strong of a sauce. The mash potatoes did help to drench this strong taste. The mash potatoes was also delicious, much better than the stuff at Lawrys, but Cheesecake Factory is still my favorite. 

@ Salmon Entrée - I got to taste the salmon someone else in our group ordered. The salmon was good, however, it was seasoned very heavily. Almost overpowering much of the flavors of the salmon. If they used a little less seasoning, this dish would have been perfect.

@ Lobster Garlic Noodles - Someone else in our group got this. The lobster had a sweet and fresh taste. Like my parmesan crusted chicken, it was good, but the sauce was a little too heavy and they seem to salt the dish a little too much. Everything tasted good, but they need to go easy a little lighter on the sauce and seasoning. Maybe they want you to order more beer?

@ Crab Crusted Swordfish - Another person in our group got this. The swordfish was very tender and delicious. Like the other dishes, they went a little season crazy on this. The crab was very salty. 

@ Macadamia Nut Cheesecake - You may be thinking you get cheesecake, with a small top layer of macadmia nuts on top. Its actually the opposite. You get a layer of cheesecake, composed of a rich base of macadmia nuts, drenched in a puddle of caramel. This desert just didn't work. The cake was very sweet, and I have a sweet tooth. They need to drizzle the caramel, instead of drenching it. Sticking to a traditional cheesecake with a cheese base and macadmia nut topping would work much better. 

@ Crème brûlée - This desert was good. The only issue is on the menu they claim topped with chocolate, but its actually on the base. At first I was eating it without the chocolate. Then I noticed the chocolate base and got it with my vanilla custard and notice a big improvement. This dish really needs the chocolate flavor to work. 

In the food department, everything was good. There are some major concerns over the seasoning of their meats, but this could be fixed. At least nothing tasted bad. The portions is also just the right size, not like the big plates you get at Cheesecake Factory or Claim Jumpers. No leftovers for lunch tomorrow, sorry.

There is some service issues with this place. First our waitress April is a very friendly waitress, but she seem a little flustered and didn't have communication with the people bringing our food. She would come to our table to check if the food came, but it didn't come. This happened numerous times. She forgot our drinks once or twice, she dropped the forks on the ground, and came out numerous times to give us more unnecessary utensils and plates. I think she was having an off night. 

The only other issue with this place is the location of the doors. If you're coming through the casino, you're actually going through the back way. While you're greeted by someone, but it seems a little odd to have to go through the entire restaurant just to get your table. The other issue is the person greeting us told us about the wait time 30-45 mins. This was no where near as accurate as they say they were. They need to work on some better communication to better accurately give an estimation. This is just really a bad, confusing, and inefficient layout with many patrons going through the backdoor to be directed to the front just to get a table. We're in the digital age of information, they should be able to seat people from the back or the front of the restaurant. The easier solution would have been to plan ahead for issues like this.

The newest restaurant at a casino that doesn't suck and is overprice. Shocking! This place does have good food, but needs to tweak the dishes just a bit. For a place thats been open for a couple of days, I'm impressed by how relatively smoothly the restaurant is running and how pack this place was on a Monday night. This place could easily be one of my favorite restaurants to go to."}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday night after having a decent Poker outing me and my wife sat outside in the exterior part where they had the heater and it was kind of hot however we had the greatest waiter ever a mark told him that it was a little warm so he shut the heaters off he came to our table took our drinks and our orders very prompt on the drinks...
We got our food from one of the runners my girlfriend had the pot pie which look like a 16 inch pizza and I had the angel hair pasta I noticed however it didn't look the same as before but I haven't been here in quite a while as we begin to eat I did notice that the angel hair pasta seems a little spicier than normal I would notice this is I have acid reflux my girls food however it was wonderful pot pie was cooked to perfection nice light fluffy crust big thick chicken and vegetables as we're eating our way to mark came over and asked us how are food was he knew exactly the menu items we were eating explain to me that the angel hair pasta had changed and know exactly about my girls pot pie I must say this was one of the most attentive waiters I have ever come across he never let my t ever get close to being out as he gave me three and my girls t as well being it was close to 11:30 closing time I figured that this gentleman would be a little upset I don't know very attentive to our table and kept making sure we were happy and if we wanted the desert he brought the check I wish I could have tipped more I only give them 11 dollars however but he was so worth the money I give this review 5 stars because of Marc the waiter....I like the pasta the old way"}
{"text":"Labor day weekend was definitely booming on a Sunday night over here. Havent been to yard house in a few months so we decided to grab a drink and small food while shopping. Rob was a great server! He was attentive and had a great sense of humor. Only downside about our experience was that the onion rings came out cold so they weren't very appetizing. The beers weren't extensively cold either- in between cold and lukewarm. It was overall kind of frustrating but we had a good day so nothing bothered us too much. Will go back though...on a crowdless day perhaps!"}
{"text":"Good place from time to time. Decent customer service. Overpriced for the most part for what you get, but I suppose your really paying for atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went to this place for happy hour and found they had some great drink and food specials. The food can be expensive but its good. The beers are good but I would not recommend getting the tasters. All of the beer taster were American beers you could find at any bar in the valley. My recommendation is to try the hefeweizens if you you like Belgium beers and with a pizza. But by far the Yard House has one of the best selections of beer in valley. 

If you are beer enthusiast you need to stop at the Yard House."}
{"text":"$12 for grilled cheese? Really! That's what my friend ordered and I had blackened swordfish tacos.  

There was more salt within one bite than half the menu at Olive Garden.  It was tough to taste any other flavors and there wasn't much fish either.  I will give them credit for presentation because it was a beautiful layout of food. 

Service wasn't bad considering how busy the place was. 

In any case, it's a good place to hang after a long day to grab a drink because they have a large variety of good beer, but definitely not worth eating there."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I did not feel comfortable eating here.  I use a wheelchair, and unfortunately, all this location has is high tables and booths.  The hostess offered to take out a piece of flooring at a booth so I could pull up to the table, but the table would have been chest height.  This would not be a comfortable way to enjoy my meal.  I was very disappointed as Yard House is one of my favorite places to eat when I go out of town."}
{"text":"Angel Hair had too much garlic, but considering that's what it said in the description, it was good. Mashed potatoes were awesome. 
We waited like 30min. Our waiter was pretty cool and came by to ask how we were doing with our meal a lot.
The atmosphere was dark and a little crowded. It was a Saturday night, however. Football games were on every umpteenth HD big screen. Which makes for a great football hangout... I don't like football."}
{"text":"Made another trip out to Yard House last night and had a better experience. It was pretty hoping for a Wednesday night, but we were seated right away. Our waiter was very attentive, our food came out at the same time, our order was correct and everything was good! This time I ordered the Caribbean chicken, it was nice and spicy, full of flavor with lots of different peppers. My friend ordered the Fried Chicken again and that was of course still delicious (recommend this dish). My original review wasn't bad, I just know that sometimes things happen, so it was nice to know that I was correct that things happen every now and then and this is not Yard House's norm! Definitely redeemed themselves! Good food, great staff, nice place!"}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant... food delicious (especially great happy hour)... Dave the Mgr. and Jay also a Mgr. made a bad experience we had at a different Yard House a great experience at the Yard House at Red Rock.  Our waiter David was all smiles and such a great waiter, checking back on us and making sure everything was great.  My thanks to Dave and Jay and David as well.  You turned a bad experience into a positive experience.  Food is terrific because the management cares what leaves the kitchen and we really had a great dining experience.  However the Yard House at the \"Linq\" and the one at \"Town Square\" need to improve in food preparation and food quality.  If you are a Yard House kind of person...... go to the Yard House at Red Rock and you will have a fantastic dining experience........ thanks guys for a great time.......Theresa"}
{"text":"It was a Saturday night in Vegas. However we got seated in 10 mins. I ordered my usual,  the prime rib dip with tartar sauce for my fries.. The design of using brioche cheese paired elegantly with the meat and the au jous. The tartar sauce had a awesome hint of jalapeño. My server was amazing had our food in time for us to enjoy with enough time to get to my movie."}
{"text":"Two of us came for Thanksgiving lunch.  Had been to Yard House before but this location has a little different variety.  Ryan is a great waiter; friendly and courteous. Ordered Poke Nacho, Lobster Mac N Cheese, and Parmesan Crusted Pork Loin based on Ryan's input.  Everything was delicious and cooked correctly.   Highly recommend the Poke Nachos and Parmesan Crusted Pork Loin.  Lobster Mac N Cheese was good too with a whole lobster tail of meat.  It just wasn't my style of cooking mac and cheese.  Had enough leftover for another meal."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot. I LOVE the shrimp lettuce cups! Drinks are a little pricey and not that great. Restrooms are clean, and that is important. I will keep going back."}
{"text":"150+ beers!  Appetizers are awesome, make sure to try the Poke Nachos!  To die for!  

To top it off, ask if Paul is available to be your server - beat customer service EVER.

Good beer, good food and great service!"}
{"text":"Woah..SO good! This place is huge, the wait isn't bad, the prices are good, and the menu is spectacular! Great for small and larger groups alike!

I went to LV for the first time last weekend and some local friends took a few of us non-local folks out for dinner Saturday night and boy did they pick a great place! We had a group of 6 and the wait wasn't bad for a busy/packed restaurant. They said it was their favorite spot and I'm sure glad we went off the strip to grab a bite to eat because they were right, this place really is great!

Their beer selection is huge, the food all sounds great and I definitely had a hard time trying to narrow down what I wanted. If only my tummy could consume as much food as my eyes could! We got several rounds of drinks, some appetizers (the sweet potato fries with sauce are soOoo tasty!), and then I chose the Crusted Parmesan Chicken with sun-dried tomato and mushroom sauce. I don't really even like mushrooms but I was a member of the clean plate club here! My husband got some garlic noodles and they were amazing! Mmmmm!

The server was super friendly, helpful, quick, and fun! We watched some games on tv's, laughed for a while, and had a great time. I wish that my hometown had this restaurant! The prices are great, the food presentation and quantity is awesome, and I would highly recommend checking this place out. 

Cheers!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times. My most recent visit was a pretty good dining experience. 

I ordered some grapefruit beer (it was probably ale) and it was aaaamazing! I usually go for ales since my taste buds like those better. I also ordered the vampire tacos. They were good but really heavy. I probably wouldn't order it again because of how heavy it is. I'm pretty sure it's supposed to be like that though. 

The server was really nice. She let us taste different beers before committing to one. You're only allowed to taste 2 different ones though."}
{"text":"Mel was our waitress for our first of what we hope to be many visits here.  She was awesome!  Helped us make some great choices from the plethora of options we were offered.  The staff was outstanding and everything came out super fast even though it was quite busy tonight.  We got Mac-n-cheese, Fried Chicken and the Enchilada Stack and we were amazed at how good everything tasted.  I can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, friendly service, and beautiful outdoor seating. I ordered the spicy edamame and tofu lettuce wraps. My friend shared who said he wasn't hungry and also did not like tofu, I looked down for 5 secs and when I looked up the tofu and mushrooms were demolished I was only left with the lettuce haha. It's okay I will be back for more tomorrow :)"}
{"text":"After the USA won against Venezuela on Saturday, we headed to the Westgate center. Originally the plan was to go to McFadden's, but there were about 100 people in line. We also tried Calico Jack's upstairs, but it was too loud and not conducing to conversation. I had previously bookmarked this bar, and so, we gave is a try. FYI, in case Google Maps tells you you're 0.2 miles from Jimmy Buffet's Margaritaville (like it did for me), you're actually right next door if you go towards the back of the center and to the right of Calico Jack's.

At about 11:30PM or so on a Saturday night, the wait time was 30-45 minutes for a table inside (keep in mind there was a hockey game too), but we were seated immediately at an outside table. Even though it was quite cold, there are heat warmers hanging from the roof. I ordered the French Onion soup, and I was pleased to note it was made properly with a slab of cheese on top, followed by a layer of bread, and the soup underneath. It is a pet peeve of mine when French Onion soup is made incorrectly (like at La Madeleine). My friend had the steak, which he said was delicious, but I think the star of the meal was the garlic french fries. They're thin, like at Smashburger, but REALLY delicious! I probably could've just ordered a side of fries and been totally satisfied. I can still remember the taste of them, two days later!

For a hot cocoa, bowl of soup (more like a mini crock pot of soup), tip, and tax, I think my portion of the bill was about $12. The waiter was attentive and friendly. He voluntarily brought water after I'd finish my hot cocoa, even though I didn't ask for it (much appreciated). If you want some great food, relaxing conversation, and interesting people watching, this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"Beer 5 stars. Food 4 stars. 

Beer selection is great. Even for beer snob standards it's a bit pricey though.  I tried several beers I have never had which is hard to find for me.  

I got the Hawaiian poke for an appetizer which was good and the New York steak sandwich which was very good. It was massive and delicious.  Decor is nice, like an upscale sports bar that takes pride in their food and beer.  The big problem is the crowd.  This place gets packed and becomes a bit disorganized. Also, some of the clientele tends to get unruly. Go here for lunch during the week or another \"off\" time and you will enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"Came to grab some food after a concert and was disappointed in the quality of the food. It was Happy Hour so we decided to order a bunch of appetizers: pepperoni pizza, margherita pizza, calamari, sliders and boneless wings. This was shared among 4 people so I got to taste a little of everything. Nothing was appetizing at all. The food was bland. The only reason why I was able to eat anything at all was the fact that I had a cold Blue Moon to wash it down. We didn't finish our food and did not take any leftovers home. Next time, I would probably stop in for drinks only."}
{"text":"Very good. Have been here before but in another state. My Nashville got chicken sandwich could have used more sauce. Tasted plain but chicken was very good. Lettuce wraps were awesome and the nachos were huge!!!!"}
{"text":"Great new selections like the \"snacks\" and there are indicators for Vegetarian and \"under 600 calories\" meals!

Another restaurant that I have frequented quite a few times since it first opened In 2008 and have sampled most of the menu. It's been a while since I've visited, but I decided to keep it simple and go back to my favorites.

SPICY TUNA ROLL: They'll warn you EVERY time - it's not really a sushi roll. It's a beautiful stack of chopped cucumbers and edamame, layered with spicy tuna, and topped with avocado. A little sriracha, sesame oil, and sauce around it to add some flavor. Delicious and light!
ORGANIC TOMATO BISQUE (WITH GRILLED CHEESE): You don't have to get the grilled cheese, but you haven't had a grilled cheese sandwich until you've had this one. Crusty, oily artisanal bread with four fabulous cheeses and tomato oozing between their slices. With the hearty tomato bisque, crazy good.
FIRECRACKER WINGS: I'm not crazy about wings nor do I order this often, but the \"firecracker\" sauce is just damn good. Zesty, spicy, sweet, and very flavorful! Give them a whirl to get away from the boring hot, medium, or wild wing sauces.
PEACH APPLE COBBLER: It's just really good. Not much to explain. I tried it the first time in the Trio Dessert Sampler and I ended up liking this one better than their soufflés. The \"cobbler\" part is really great.

There's H/H in the middle of the day (M-F) from 3pm-6pm and at night after 10pm (not Fri and Sat), so that's a great time to go for great deals on their appetizers and alcohol. I'm not a big fan of their martinis (not sure why, but I've tried several on multiple occasions and they are really terrible), however, there are people that love them. May just not be my style."}
{"text":"I was surprised that this Yard House didn't really \"wow\" us.  It's in a really cool spot tucked back by The Linq and the Linq High Roller.  

We are huge Yard House fans and have been to many from Irvine-Glendale-Orlando.  I was surprised when we were there this was one of the least impressive one's yet next to the Costa Mesa location in California.  

The bartenders were alright and friendly enough.  What was disappointing was the time it took to get a drink and the food.  We went with the Moo Shu egg rolls for an appetizer.  Those were pretty solid, as usual.  I had the fried chicken sandwich and it was the worst one I've had at any Yard House.  The garlic fries were cold and the chicken sandwich was in 2 pieces!  It was crunchy and way overcooked and I could tell it sat a while before it came out.  Whatever, I ate it.  But it was not very good.  

Maybe it gets busier in here at night or during events but it was sooooo slow when we were in there.  Maybe it's the tucked away location but it was surprising to see a Yard House that wasn't very busy.  I remember when we used to frequent the I-Drive location in Orlando and it was busy from the minute they opened the doors until bar close.  I just assumed the Vegas location would be steady.  

Overall it was below average for a YH.  Might give it another chance next time around."}
{"text":"This is a great Yard House.  My first experience at a Yard House was a few years ago at the one in the Scottsdale mall, and well, that was obnoxious.  Not so much the Yard House but the people.  Anyways, moving on...

This Yard House has a great vibe about it.  There's plenty of seating inside but the selling point with this location is the outdoor seating that wraps around the restaurant with plenty of heat lamps.  Being that it's tucked behind Margaritaville, it's a great place to sit and people watch at night.  I had the Mac and Cheese, which is to die for and probably the best adult mac and cheese on the planet, and then I headed inside to the bar for a whiskey.  Of all places in Westgate, the people I ran into here were super friendly and easy to talk to.  The bartenders were really friendly and I ended up staying a couple hours as the patrons at the bar didn't have the attitude as some of the neighboring restaurants and everybody was chatty.  It was a fun experience.  The lighting is a little dimmer inside than some restaurants but it sets the tone for the place and it works.  

The Yard House in general has some of the absolute best food around.  If you are in the Westgate area it's a must stop for dinner or drinks."}
{"text":"We are regulars at Yard House Town Square but had an excellent experience this past week at this location.
Our server was on point and so was the food of course. 
We always get the deviled eggs (topped with bacon, I always give my bacon to the bf) and almost always go for the Gardine wings (buffalo style). 
I am in love with the Ace Pinapple on tap but decided to try something new, a Strawberry beer...It was flat. I hate complaining but our friend insisted he say something. Our server was great about it and immediately switched me back to the beer I love, the Ace. 
Our friend had never been to YH, we couldn't believe it, and of course he enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"We come here almost weekly and sit at the bar. 
Never let down by the service and the food. 
I'm obsessed with the Ace Pineapple on tap, SO refreshing! 
Things to indulge in:
-Deviled Eggs
-Gardine Wings (buffalo style)
-Pizza, any kind
-Spicey Tuna..not an actual roll but incredible 
-Poke and/or regular nachos 
-Brussel-sprouts 
...And pretty much everything in their menu has been excellent."}
{"text":"The yard house is one of my all time favorite restaurants! The pepper steak and porcini crusted halibut are amazing! The reason I gave this place 4 stars is the wait staff are horrible! The last few times my food has came out cold while I've seen my waiter/waitress just sitting around talking."}
{"text":"First off great tasting food, really top flavors...wait staff fun and professional. What keeps the stars down is the amount of food to your dollar...not worth the higher prices, so good but my fish tacos were as small as Jack in the box tacos...and the fantastic beans came in a small cup the size of the ketchup cup...beans are pretty cheap to buy. Rice was great, amount and taste.
The second star knocked out was due to the Noise! Not the place for a romantic dinner. What I call SHOUT TALKING was going on all around us. Table right next to us , the trio was sitting back in their chairs so they were more screaming than talking...heard every sorted detail of their week. Turn down the music and move the tables apart might help keep the screamers down"}
{"text":"I met up with some coworkers on Saturday before the Coyotes game for drinks and dinner here. My drink of choice was the Raspberry Cider, and for my meal I decided on the Spicy Chicken Breast sandwich with fries. The sandwich was a nice thought but it had some flaws - the flat bread was good, but too thick/fluffy to handle all of the insides. Also, the seasoning on the chicken was more salty than spicy. Either way I was starving so I sucked it up and ate most of it. The service was good and they have heaters on the patio which was nice."}
{"text":"Wide selection of beers. And if you are confused, you can always taste one before getting. I tried their house honey blend and loved it. Highlight of the food there was onion ring stack and the side of the Spanish rice which came with the tacos. Tacos themselves were very mediocre. Turkey burger was very moist and tasty. Overall a very nice hangout place for a Friday or Saturday night."}
{"text":"It's a sad state when there are two people sitting at the bar and the manager has to come over and take 50 percent of the orders. This tall, male bartender on duty on Sunday, May 15th in the morning is constantly terrible. I've been coming here for years and it always seems like he purposefully ignores me, while moving at the pace of molasses. It's no wonder he gets this terribly terrific shift. I would mention his name, but after being half heartedly served by him on multiple occasions, I can't recall a single time where he smiled at me and told me his name. Normally I would give this place a solid 4 stars. Their food is great and when you get a server who isn't writing it in, every single time, you tend to have a pleasant experience. But this time they, and by they I mean the unnamed bartender, get one star. Good luck with that, Yard House."}
{"text":"I was so surprised that there were a lot of beer. I enjoyed several kinds of beer. I took Korean bbq, caramari and word fish tacos. Tacos was spicy but it suited my pallets. About 40$ per person. It is reasonable restaurant for the people who like beer.i will come back again."}
{"text":"Nothing to be excited about anymore. Yard house has become so huge over the years, that It feels as if their standards have lowered since they are so well knows these days. They're at almost 400 reviews, so that can say a lot about a company. High volume of business can lead to neglect of customers such as myself. Repeatedly, it never fails that my drink sits empty before being refilled for at least 5-10 minutes. Every time. Without fail. Food quality seems to be lowering, due to the success of the company. No need to win over customers anymore. Management even walked right by our table, seeing my empty glass along with my husbands and did not even blink. Fries were cold, asada tacos cold along with rice and beans. Mercadito next door is a hundred times better."}
{"text":"Great service!! The drinks and food were amazing! Our pregnant waitress was so accommodating and had a great attitude. She definitely knows what customer service is all about."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of 21 people before riding the High Roller. Yard House did a great job seating our large group together and bringing our food out at the same time, which is not easy with a big group!
My husband and I shared the duck fat potatoes. Oh man, I am still thinking about how good they were! Crispy, salty, savory slices of potato with two dip options - one creamy, one ketchup-based. This is not to be missed!
For drinks I had a refreshing pineapple cider and my husband had an IPA sampler.
For dinner I had the summer salad and he had tacos.
The future bride and groom in our group were given a free dessert that said \"congrats\" on the plate, which was really sweet of Yard House.
I highly recommend checking out Yard House if you're near the LINQ!"}
{"text":"Love yard house! Shrimp lettuce wrap is a must try! That's always my main dish along with clam chowder! Christie was our server on a Friday evening, even though they were busy, she was very attentive, professional, checked on us several times. Mind you, I was here with 2 kids by myself and she knew it was a small Check with two kids meal, she was still very genuine and courteous. Hard to find this kind of service nowadays!"}
{"text":"Yard House is totally reminiscent of BJ's but with better service & a lot more beers on tap.  The wait isn't as long as BJ's, we waited after 8 for a table for 3 for about 20-30 minutes.  However, the prices seem a little higher than BJ's.  My friend who lives out there took bf & I to dinner here since her & her bf eat here all the time.

Though parking was kind of difficult, I love the location of the restaurant in Town Square.  Town Square reminds me of The Grove in LA without the snootiness.

I loved my Cuban Roast Pork Sandwich!  The pork was moist and the pepperjack cheese was melted nicely.  The au ju was a perfect accompaniment...even though the sammie didn't need it because the meat was not dry at all.  It also came with a mountain of crispy shoestring fries.  Oh god, I just looked at the site's nutrition facts for it....luckily I saved half of it for the next day.   Bf thought his BBQ Chicken Pizza was okay.  And my friend always gets the same pasta dish that she enjoys."}
{"text":"This place rules.  Four friends and I crushed the happy hour menu with drinks for under $100.  We ordered enough to make everyone stuffed... pizza, sushi, queso, wings, chicken wraps... all of it was delicious, and the service was pretty good, too."}
{"text":"Good vibes, good, and beer before heading into the casinos to gamble. 

This place is overpriced but so is everywhere else on The Strip. The beer selection is really impressive and I enjoyed the half yard I had. The food menu is very extensive and both the lamb burger and carnivore pizza I had were excellent. Our server was charming and everyone was very friendly."}
{"text":"Great veggie options! Most of the food in this area was pretty bad, but this place is PHENOMENAL comparatively! Only 4 stars because we waited foreeeeever for coffee (after several bloody marys). Also, the bloody mary details weren't on the menu. Mine showed up with bacon in it and I'm severely allergic to pork. They were quick to fix it though."}
{"text":"After having brunch buffet, we were stuffed and come dinner time we just wanted a snack to share.  At the Linq near the high Roller Ferris wheel is Yard House.  Happy Hour starts at 3PM and they have a selection of good eats.  I chose the pepperoni and mushroom pizza which is good for two or even three. Good place to unwind and stop by the shops."}
{"text":"I always think of the Yard House as a bar with good music and decent burgers. But I've been really impressed with this location, both from the service and food standpoint.

As I said, the burgers are decent, but I've tried some other menu items, like the stacked chicken enchilada, and they been pretty tasty as well! What I really like is that the quality of the food they're using is excellent.

Another interesting thing to note about the Yard House, at least this location, is that they have an excellent kid's menu. This hadn't been a concern to me in the past, but with a 9 year old stepson now, I find myself sometimes seeking out places that are kid-friendly. Who'd have though that the Yard House would be one of the best options for kids? Not only do they have a huge selection (for a kid's menu, relatively speaking), but they offer decent portion sizes and, of course, good food quality.

Perhaps I'm biased because I go way back with the Yard House. I remember when they opened their first location (and I loved the concept at the time). And I remember when they began to expand. Though I'm not necessarily a big fan of chains, the Yard House deserves its success, and I'm glad to see them maintaining great quality.

If you're near Red Rock and looking for a good place to eat, the Yard House won't let you down."}
{"text":"My server Darek(Derek?) was awesome and so nice. Definitely knowledgeable and helped us out with everything we needed/ any questions we had! He was just super friendly and made this experience well worth it! I've only been to yard house a few times but this time was memorable!"}
{"text":"Excellent! Food was great but even better was the service. The teamwork that the entire staff showed blew me away. It was like having 5 servers not just one. I will definitely be going back soon."}
{"text":"Great restaurant in the awesome LINQ Promenade. Dark comfortable atmosphere, great service, great food - by far the best restaurant in the area (skips the overrated casino restaurants!) 

Very extensive menu - something for everyone here including vegan/vegetarians - they have a whole section (12 items!) of Gardein entrees. Prices are in the reasonable range for being so close to the strip. Also have a huge selection for the craft beer drinkers too.

Started with a Classic Ranch salad, BF had the mixed greens - both were lovely side salads. Ordered a Margherita pizza - it was very large (I thought it was going to be an individual flatbread style - nope, it's a medium size traditional pizza - excellent too). BF ordered the Cuban Roast Pork Dip and it was phenomenal - the mystical mojo dip had us wowed ;) 

Definitely would revisit in LV and checking their website for locations near me!"}
{"text":"Yardhouse at Westgate, didn't disappoint.  First, the hostess placed us in a booth away from the noise of the sports games and music, very considerate!  Second, the ceasar salad was the best I've had in a long time, chrispy roman, great tasty dressing, yummy.  I usually get the Mac and Cheese which is always awesome and went with Sirlon with Portobello Mushroom, Mashed Potatoes, and Grilled Tomato, it was worth it, and had it with a pretty good glass of beer with it..yum.  Server was really nice and allowed us to linger at the table after dinner for awhile.    Tasty meal for a cool winter Phoenix night!!"}
{"text":"I believe there are 3 yard houses in Las Vegas and I have visited all of them this is more suitable for tourists then locals but I have eaten at this particular yard house about four times I definitely love the lobster noodles and the sea bass 

Yard House is hard to complain about
Never had any bad experiences at any of the locations."}
{"text":"You have to try the ahi nachos. And their beer selection is outstanding, personal faborite the peanut butter stout. And our server Evan was really helpful and attentive. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour and we ordered calamari, traditional Buffalo chicken wings, onion ring tower, BBQ chicken pizza and blue crab cakes. All of that for 2 people, we were out of control. 

Buffalo wings and the BBQ chicken pizza were very good. We asked for more Buffalo sauce though as the sauce was too dry on the wings. The pizza has thin crust, which I like. Definitely would order these again. 

Onion ring tower is just above average, in my opinion. At first, I thought we would only get 5 rings, but they actually gave us A LOT. They came with two kinds of sauce. Their sauces are super duper good. They brought the onion rings to another level. I don't know how they make their sauces, but I wish I knew their recipes. I'm not even a fan of sauces, but I like those. 

Calamari and crab cakes were just mediocre. I wasn't too impressed. 

Apart from happy hour menu, I usually come here for lunch and get the lunch specials or Korean pork tacos - LOVE these tacos!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome selection of beer and food is good and consistent. Not what I would call a cozy restaurant, but service is still good. Good fish n chips to go with the beer."}
{"text":"My husband and I were going to the Camelback 5 to see a movie and decided to have dinner at the Yard House.  I must say that the staff and the food were both wonderful.  I ordered the vodka shrimp pasta and it was delicious.  My husband ordered the clam chowder and the blue crab cake sandwich.  Although he said that the sandwich was very good he could not stop talking about the clam chowder (and when it comes to his clam chowder he is very picky).  I did taste the chowder (actually I did more than taste it) it was very, very good!  The beer selection was amazing...we did get to check out some yummy beer.  I have nothing but wonderful things to say about the Yard House.  We will be going back to the Yard House again."}
{"text":"I was thrilled to find a whole section of Gardein options! In addition to the Gardein section, the menu consisted of other items marked \"V\" for vegetarian. 

I ordered the Gardein BBQ Chicken Salad. I was not disappointed. This really reminded me of a high quality bbq chicken salad that I would have enjoyed before I became a vegetarian. 

We visited on a Saturday night, the place was PACKED. Still, the wait was only about 10 mins. Our server was great, super friendly and attentive. The food came out quick. 

Overall, a great dining experience. Will definitely be back to try other Gardein menu items."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever!! Hostess was rude and clueless. 
We changed the amount of people that were going to show up and the hostess punished us by allowing people that just arrived to be seated, as we waited for 35 minutes.
We arrived on Friday October 10, wanting a table for six, then eight and then down to four. She was huffy, impatient and extremely condescending.   I told her she was the worst in customer service and we would never come back and she replied \"Never? Aww\" mockingly. 
Besides that the food isn't that great. Just went to be social. Never will I step foot in Summerlin Yardhouse."}
{"text":"I have only ever been here for Happy Hour, and that has been at least a dozen times.  I certainly can't speak for anything on the menu aside from their appetizers, but everything that I have eaten has been excellent (and not just because I had downed multiple assorted beers).  The tap selection is unparalleled, which is great for people like me who like to see choices that go far beyond the basics like Sam Adams and Fat Tire.  They have scores of beers on tap that I haven't seen at any other bars in this city.  The only bad thing I could say is that they require 80% of your party to be present before they will give you a table.  That can be frustrating when you know that 10 co-workers are going to show up, yet they won't give you a big table because you only have 6 people present.  No matter, we usually just put in for the table and wait at the bar for everyone to show up.  Obviously I'm not too upset about it, because the great prices on Happy Hour appetizers and the ridiculous beer selection are what make me give this place a resounding 5 stars."}
{"text":"Checked this place out on a recent trip to Vegas so glad we did the food was really good. We ordered the spicy jambalaya, crusted pork lion with sweet potato mash which was AMAZING, maui pineapple chicken with steamed Jasmin rice and the southern crispy chicken which was really good, honestly you can not go wrong with anything you order here the food is so fresh and flavorful I definitely plan on coming back here on my next Vegas trip."}
{"text":"Took my dad here for Father's Day lunch. I ordered the white fish tacos. I was not a fan. I took two bites to make sure I was correct. The fish was bland. Tortilla tastes like it came right out of the bag. Without having even seen a toaster or griddle. The side of rice had been sitting in the plate so long before the rest of the food. It began to harden on the outside and became stiff. The only thing off of my plate I could stomach was the black beans. Those were decent. 
The waitress cared almost none about what was on my plate. The manager stopped by apologized and offered a different menu item but at that point I had lost my appetite. 
Not the best location. I prefer desert ridge's location, the food quality standards are set higher."}
{"text":"My place to go at Town Square. Got this essentials ahi poke stack and the chicken lettuce wraps. Kung pao calamari with jasmine rice is too die for! I love their selection of beers. Gulden Draak is one of my favorite beers. Staff is on point. Yard House is one of the best joints in town!"}
{"text":"We hit up the yard house before a Cardinals/Bears game.  

When you first see the line out the door you get a little discouraged.  But we had come early enough to suck it up and wait.  The line outside the door is just the wait to get inside so they do not go over capacity.

Once inside you can put your name down for a table, or go to the patio/lounge, or hit the bar.  We put our name down for a table, then hit the bar.

Surprisingly they have a decent system here, that works.  They have roped off areas where they do not want people standing in order for the servers to get in and out.  And that is actually super helpful.  We were able to get up to the bar and order drinks, step back, and watch TV while waiting for our table.  They said it would be an hour and a half wait for a table but I think we were seated after an hour.  It really wasn't that bad.  And once seated, service was really good and quick.  No problems at all.  

Definitely recommend it before a football game, but be prepared to wait a little while."}
{"text":"Headed here after a early movie for the start of HH. I always order the same things..seared ahi sashimi and garlic noodles. And it was perfect as usual. I love my take home box of the noodles for later! The prices for HH are soooo affordable its amazing!
My bill is 11 something..leave 15 and Im outta there with a full & VERY happy tummy."}
{"text":"Exceptional customer service experience!!!!
This review is in regards to the amazing customer service we recieved by Kayla!!!
I Came with a friend that highly recommended the vegan burger here, so I had to try it.
First of all,  let me just say, Kayla went above and beyond and even exceeded our expectations.
We ordered drinks, my friend asked for something that wasn't normally offered and Kayla made it happen. It may not have been a big deal to her but the fact that she took a few extra moments of her time to do what she did, really spoke volumes to me and about her.
 I used to be a server and this would totally have been something I would have done!
She was so sweet and came back several times to make sure everything was okay.
The Vegan burger was delicious!! It wasn't dry at all. There was a vegan cheese on it that tasted great as well, and the size did not dissapoint. We ate it with fries and they had great flavor that complimented the meal. 
Yardhouse has always been a good choice for food or drinks. It had a been a while since I last ate here, but Kayla really shined yesterday and I thought I should take my own moment to make this review. 
Thank you so much Kayla for being so awesome. You made a great night, even better, just by being you. You are a superstar!!"}
{"text":"Decent place with ok food and drinks, good neighborhood hangout but nothing special. Great beer selection but the TV's are not suitable for watching games, sound was super shirty too."}
{"text":"Friendly server/bartender each time we have gone. The onion rings and poke nachos are the best"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here after the International Motorcycle Show which was being held nearby. There was about a half an hour wait even though they didn't seem too busy (but the space is pretty huge). The hostess was nice and friendly but our server not so much. We kind of got the vibe that our server just didn't want to be working. She didn't give much feedback about the menu, checked on us maybe once, service was slow and she couldn't even crack a smile. Her attitude seemed to be the same with the table next to us so we didn't take it personally but it was a turn off.
The presentation of the food was great but the taste was eh (nothing too exciting). After this experience I won't seek out to go to this restaurant but I wouldn't oppose to it."}
{"text":"This was the second time I've been to a Yard House.. The first time was in San Diego.  I love the selection of beer and when you go you HAVE to get your beer in the half-yard glass. It's a must. The best/worst part about it is when you get towards the bottom of your beer the glass acts more like a beer bong. The liquid just shoots down your throat. I guess it makes the experience more fun. 

The food was good. We just got a bunch of appetizers. 

Sliders: Theses were okay, not out standing. 
Asian glazed chicken wings: YUMMIE! They were my favorite but a bit spicy. 
coconut shrimp: You get like two shrimps.. okay maybe three and they weren't that good. 
Mac and Cheese: Yummie! I liked it but I couldn't really taste any truffle oil. 
Pear and walnut salad: I liked this dish a lot. Almost finished all of it myself.
Chicken Lettuce wraps: Ehhh... like any other wrap. 

All in all go for the beer. I'm sure they'll have your favorite!"}
{"text":"I don't drink beer but I love the food here.

Everything on the menu, and I mean EVERYTHING is great! 

I especially like that they have \"Gardein\" vegetarian selections.  I have friends that are vegetarians so it is nice that  we can go somewhere and they are not stuck with just a salad or a baked potato.

The service is spot on, and the wait staff is knowledgeable of their menu and can answer any question.

I make a stop here every time I'm in the valley."}
{"text":"Consistently good food! Great for meeting up with friends. Outdoor patio very inviting. We all had the Kung pao calamari, chicken lettuce wrap, chicken nachos, pastrami sandwich and mahi mahi...all good! The cocktails were good except the margarita...it was very tart. Have been 4-5 times."}
{"text":"Great experience here today. Ordered the chicken nachos and the pepper crusted Gorgonzola burger, both of which were delicious! Got the truffle fries with my burger and they were very yummy as well. My sister ordered the vampire street tacos and loved them. Our server Isla was wonderful! Will definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"This was brought up in conversation due to having great reviews thought we should go check it out... Slightly disappointed I must say.  The burger was solid but the fries were bad to say the least.  They did have a great beer selection but they don't brew their own so my ratings won't reflect that.  
Beer Na they don't brew their own
Food 6/10
Ambiance 6.5/10"}
{"text":"Favorite place to go for dinner and drinks on a Saturday night! Chicken Nachos Appetizer is the bomb! Spicy jambalaya, is fantastic I literally order this every time I come here! And if you enjoy a good mai tai then definantly submit an order for that too!"}
{"text":"We were starving and were wandering down the street toward the High Roller when we saw a restaurant we recognized - Yard House. It was my boyfriends first time at Yard House, but I have dined here before - just at a different location. 

It was rather slow, and we were seated in a large booth right away. The host was very friendly. Our server came by after a few minutes and went over the beer list, which neither of us drink, so we just had water and a soda. It took awhile to place our order, but when we did we got the BBQ Bacon Cheddar Burger and the Roasted Turkey Club. 

Food took a little while, and came out missing the side of dressing we ordered. Everything else came out correctly. The Turkey Club was a large portion, served with fries. I'm pretty sure they just cut up one slice of bacon and put one tiny crumble on each piece of the sandwich, there wasn't very much. My boyfriend said the burger was cooked great, but lacked in flavor. When our server finally came by to check on us, we asked for the dressing again, and it took about 5 minutes to get it, as she stopped and refilled drinks and brought bar drinks out to all of her other tables, before looking over and suddenly remembering she forgot our side. She never asked how the food was or offered if we needed anything else, but she was very consistent with all of her other tables - that happened to be having alcohol. I understand most people in Vegas are there to drink, but that doesn't mean you forget about your other paying customers as well. 

Overall, it was just okay. We will probably not return and will go elsewhere on the strip for lunch."}
{"text":"Excellent food, service and atmosphere.  Have eaten there with my family probably 5 or 6 times, one time being a large party in Kansas City Kansas, and It was just as good in Kansas as it has been at our local spot in Scottsdale. In fact we have NEVER had a bad experience or food or service. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great selection of food, and never have been disappointed with what I have ordered. Incredible beer selection on tap!! Only criticism is I think that the lunch menu is overpriced.. Very little difference in the lunch food and the dinner food prices.."}
{"text":"Ate here at lunch, restaurant was half filled.  Had three street tacos and two different ciders.  Excellent.  Great draft beer and cider selection.  I have been here twice with no service issues once at dinner."}
{"text":"I live in this side of town so went to this place with a friend. It's a burger, pizza, chicken place. American fair I'd call it. The food is good. Pricier than I like for the type of food but maybe their rent is high. It's one of those place for me where it's okay to eat if you are in the mood for something tasty but nothing special. It's a bar after all. It's pretty much analogous to an In n Out for me only it's a bar/restaurant not a fast food place. Oh I have been to the Town Square one too. They are like clones as far as food is concerned.  I went to that location first. We had a meetup and that was just a place that was not cheap but not too pricey but they have something for everyone. A $20-25 bill kind of place for a meal, for one that is."}
{"text":"Yardhouse is my absolute FAVORITE restaurant. The first time I ate at yardhouse was in vegas and I fell in love! They have a really good selection of vegetarian food so it's a great place to eat if you have a group of for both meat eaters and vegetarians. They're happy hour is a huge plus for me as well. I tend to order the wings as an entree but the wings are part of the happy hour appetizers which means I get them pretty cheap."}
{"text":"I have come here multiple times and I've always enjoyed the food. It's nice if you can sit on the outside patio if it's not too hot outside. The servers have always been very nice. My favorite dish is the Shitake garlic noodles. It's an appetizer but works well as a meal. Also the onion ring tower is a winner with the parmesan cheese. One consistency I've noticed is it takes awhile until your entree is served. It doesn't seem to matter how busy it is."}
{"text":"Good service. Food ready fast even though it was packed. Great ambiance outside. Delicious food. Sydney was awesome. Try it out"}
{"text":"I really like this place.  The food is all consistently good, the drinks are good and the service is great.  I love the atmosphere outside and find it very relaxing.  Prices are decent, given it's location in Westgate.  The only negative I have is that while one can smoke cigarettes while sitting outside, cigars are prohibited.  To me this makes no sense whatsoever.  The manager came out and asked us to put out our cigars.  So we did that, finished our drinks and went to an establishment that was more cigar friendly."}
{"text":"Everyone keeps comparing this place to Cheesecake factory....I didn't see the similarities except for the vast array of dishes.  Differences weren't bad.  In fact, it was a relief that they weren't alike because Yardhouse doesn't have an occupancy in Illinois.

Stuck to the appetizers, and by far, these are winners.  There were no mixed reviews on appetizers, as people young and old enjoyed them during happy hour AND after happy hour.  That's a tell tale sign that they would pay full price for them 

Dining companion and I shared the chinese garlic noodles, bernaise beef sliders and the Korean bbq beef. Each appetizer could have surely passed as an entrée.  Chinese garlic noodles were buttery, savory and irresistible feel good food.  Bernaise sliders came in 4.  They meat was a little on the dry side, the bun a little too soggy.  Korean bbq beef was great.  Nice texture, not too chewy, and very well seasoned.  Accompanied with it was fluffy-ish white jasmine rice.  

The dining area was Hu-Mongo!  Located in the Red Rock Casino, they didn't skimp on details with making everything giant sized,. Andre the Giant and The Rock could set next to each other size by the side in the booth and still have plenty of room for another Expendable."}
{"text":"If you know me, you know I love a good happy hour and Yard House delivers exceptionally well in that department. More on that in a sec. 
Basics:Food is very good. Area is well-kept, well-decorated and has a wonderful outdoor seating area. TVs are in view regardless of where you sit and the restrooms are clean. Wait staff and hostesses are great.
Good stuff: The beer selection is tremendous.They have over 100 beers to choose from and the beer menu helps guide you to what you are most likely to enjoy.
The happy hour here applies every weekday (including Fridays) and runs 4-7pm. Pints are $2 most beers or $4 off a 'half yard', which is basically a bit less than two pints, so just go with the pints. Cocktails are also handsomely priced for happy hour.
They have a large happy hour menu of food and you can't go wrong with anything. My personal favorites are the chicken nachos ($7) that will feed 2-3 people alone. The pizzas are also very good for the price. My single favorite item on the happy hour menu is the poke stack for $8. 
Yard House is the best west side happy hour. I love stopping after work on a Friday, having a couple of great beers and some apps with my wife and friends in a great area."}
{"text":"I recommend the truffle fries they were delicious. The buffalo wings were good. The staff was friendly. It was superb! Everything is always delicious and the staff was very attentive."}
{"text":"Meh so disappointing for a Thursday slow bartenders a trainer at the bar in some waiting movie lookalike uniform silly and didn't appear to do much food was disappointing and took quite a while wouldn't waste my time here again when thirsty lion is next door and 100 times better"}
{"text":"This is one of my all time favorites!  The beer selection is amazing, the food is always delicious, and the staff is very customer experience focused. Great date night choice or happy hour with the girls!!  WestGate is such a great area especially during Cardinals or Coyotes games!  And Yardhouse is a perfect stop after a day of shopping at the outlet mall or catching a movie at WestGate. I take all of my out of town visitors here and it will be crazy during the Super Bowl and Pro Bowl!!  If you have never been to the Yardhouse at WestGate, you should put it on your list!!"}
{"text":"If I had not had a gift card to eat at Yard House, I would not have come here. I have been here several times, but it is not my first choice. Ever. I think people think its cool because it has about 100 different beers on tap. Personally I think it is way overpriced and the food is only so-so. I got the steak salad which had a few greens, a couple green beans and sliced steak, but there was nothing special about it. I prefer the one at Outback. The steak was not very well seasoned. My husband got the NY steak sandwich and he complained about how gristly it was. He had to pick a ton of gristle off. But I enjoyed the sweet potato fries :)."}
{"text":"We were a large party celebrating a birthday. Lynsey started us off, then Amina took over when her shift ended. They were both friendly and accommodated all of our needs. Amina split the checks for our party. She was very attentive and the service was great!"}
{"text":"I've been here a million times and never yelled before food is always good but today I had the holiday special pork chop with Apple honey sauce and Brussels sprouts and it was phenomenal!!!!! So freaking good!!! If it remotely sounds good to you....GET IT EVERY BITE WAS AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"I came here once and I was sold! I ordered the lobster garlic noodles and it was delicious! They weren't too selfish with their lobster, the noodles were made to perfection, and the overall dish was enjoyable. 
The location is convenient and there are a lot of restaurants to choose from but if you are looking for lunch and dinner this would be your place. I recommend Yard House to locals and those visiting. I will certainly be coming back."}
{"text":"For $60.00 I could have feed five people at the Golden Coral & would have gotten better steaks. 
The waitress laughed at me when I used my cell phone to illuminate the plates. Seeing as the lighting was too dim to even see the plate. My date's steak has so much fat he had to re-carve the darn thing with each and every bite. He left more than half on the plate. The steak I ordered was old, not aged. I had sat in the cooler far too long. The edges were cooked well but the inside of the meat was gritty and worse than burnt meat. The tomato garnish was so bitter and sour it turned my stomach.
The iced tea was weak. The potatoes were edible compared to the steaks.
The music was good."}
{"text":"I honestly love this place. .great drinks great food staff is friendly. Will be returning love their drink list lil of everything."}
{"text":"Everytime I eat here I always have fantastic service and delicious food. Last time my husband and I went out to eat we had a table in no time even with it being busy. Our waiter was very nice and fast. We had ordered drinks which were at the bar. Even with it being packed we got a drink in like 5 mins which isn't bad. We ordered our food my husband and I got the boneless chicken wings and the truffle Mac and Cheese if you have been to a yard house you know they our amazing. Our food came out quick and was yummy. We got on check fast and we were on our way full and happy."}
{"text":"My husband and I really enjoyed this restaurant!  He had the Turkey Pot Pie and he said amazing!!  I had the Lamb Burger and it was delightful. 

We are looking forward to going back. They had a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"The truffle fries are deadly! I love this place and eat here every time I'm in Vegas. Delicious food, the drinks are great and the service is always good. Plus it's dark and the AC is icy. A nice break from the sweltering promenade!"}
{"text":"I usually come to Yard House with my family for dinners. Came here for lunch with my mom. The customer service was awesome! Our server, Darlene, was very funny. Interior was big and open, it felt nice and comfy. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection, their vegetarian options were almost all Gardein brand stuff I can get at the grocery store. Everyone in my group loved everything they had... even my super generic veggie burger was good, mostly due to the toppings and beer"}
{"text":"The fries. Get the fries. They are long and stringy shoe fries and crispy just like they should be. Everyone raves about the mac n cheese, worth a try. I probably wouldn't get it a 2nd time around but it's worth knowing what all the hype is about-bc it is good! The restaurant is set up with the bar in the middle and seating around the edges. Loud environment! Good food."}
{"text":"Th place is our jam! They have a huge menu including smaller shareable plates. The service is most often great. We love the atmosphere and the menu."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places. Truffle fries and boneless firecracker wings are awesome ! Get a mule to go with every meal. Will never regret going to this place."}
{"text":"Pricey. Nachos were pretty aweful. Ranch salad was underdressed. Turkey club is ok. A coke is 3.25. Really? Always busy though."}
{"text":"Met some friends for late lunch and we rolled into happy hour.  Just great place to met for happy hour.  Good food, 100+ beers on tap, some nice outside covered seating.  Waitstaff was attentive but did not hover.  Great place."}
{"text":"Expect a hefty price tag, but the food is delicious and high quality, great service. I enjoyed the outdoor seating area. Greatest beer selection of any restaurant of course!"}
{"text":"I had outstanding service today and the food was amazing!! I definitely will be back. My server Eduado gave me a great suggestion and was super friendly."}
{"text":"Seth is the best!!!! We always sit in his section. 

After trying some other places at town square this place never fails. Staff is always great and pros at their job. Food is fresh and is always delicious. The Kitchen's game is alway on! Kudos guys! Beer prices are a little steep for me even during happy hour I don't like paying $6 for a beer when a six pack at Lee's is $11. But overall great place. I always make it my go to stop at town square. Thanks y'all."}
{"text":"Food is good, most of the time. Beer selection is amazing. This place does get packed at times so service takes longer than someone would want. I have honestly had great and horrible experiences here, but still go there every couple of months. Good place to watch a game. Happy hour during football games is great."}
{"text":"A few years ago I would rate YH four stars. Today I'm lowering it to three because the food has gone downhill a little. Still a great selection of beers, and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Had the Korean spare rib tacos and they were delicious, couldn't have asked for better. The garlic fries were some of the best I've had. I ordered the El Picante cocktail, not only did it have jalapeño slivers, but it came with a half roasted jalapeño and was amazing! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I always love going to Yard House. They have a wide variety of food and drinks, with a growing menu. Whether here for a a special occasion, or just for good eats, you are sure to find something you like. 

One of my favorites is the cheese curds. The sauce that comes with it, not so much, but the curds are as close as a Wisconsin cheese curd, that I've found in the desert. Their street tacos are delicious too. The food is always fresh and comes out nice and hot! 

This is a great spot for happy hour as well. You have nice choices of what to order, and the menu is not skimpy like other happy hour menus around the valley. Drinks $2/$3/$4 off depending on what you order. 

Service in here is always good! I love when I go to a restaurant and the server has a sense of humor. It always makes the experience better."}
{"text":"Beer selection is no joke, but I've been to a few places with a few more obscure choices. I didn't get the same sports bar vibe as a few of the other reviewers, but my friend and I didn't actually get there until about 10:45 on a slow Friday night, so maybe the frat house crowd had already cleared out.

3 stars became 4 due to the excellent service we got. Very attentive and friendly, my partner in crime and I wanted for nothing. My suggestion is to get a seat at a table outside with a friend or two, grab a beer/drink and an app, and make fun of all the drunk douchebags leaving Margaritaville."}
{"text":"Went here today because I was craving sushi so badly and the place we were going to didn't have what they advertised on the website. I got the california \"disc\" and it was good until I bit down on a piece of shell from the crab. Ouch. Talked to the manager, he took it off the bill. I don't like complaining, but I don't want this to happen to other customers. BF got the bbq pizza which was quite tasty. This was a last resort pick, besides Jack in the Box, but I had dressed up too nicely to not sit down in a restaurant. 3 stars because the bill was around $10 with tip."}
{"text":"Great selection of beer.  This chain restaurant claims to have the most biggest beer selection and while they do have a lot, I doubt they have the largest.  The calamari and nachos were just okay.  I had a beer flight that was great.  I would go back just for the atmosphere and beer.  I also would like to try more of the food."}
{"text":"If your a craft beer lover like me this is the best place for craft beer.  They have the biggest selection on the strip atleast that I can find.  The food is really good to.  It's a great spot if your look to grab some beers and not pay a fortune for drinks like all the other places in Vegas."}
{"text":"Typical chain restaurant.  Portions are huge, great beer selection.  Our waiter was very good.  I had the chicken tenders and they were just alright."}
{"text":"My wife and i came in to share an appetizer and have a beer. Lots too choose from of course. Prices are pretty high we ordered a pizza and it was very greasy. Cheese fell off by just picking it up. Clam chowder was good. 26$ for a tiny pizza, clam chowder and 1 beer since i was deiving i got a lemonade. Id say come during happy hour prices are better."}
{"text":"Great service, great atmosphere, alot of space for everyone....everything i ordered was plated beautifuly, and tasted amazing...can't wait to eat there again..."}
{"text":"Beautiful location. Unfortunately because this area is so busy and on Vegas strip they don't have Happy Hour or Happy Hour food specials. Waitresses are friendly and have lots of energy. Great night life late at night for people watching while you eat and drink. Enjoy."}
{"text":"My wife loved the Mac and cheese but my chicken rice bowl was bland. Unquestionably awesome beer list. Great outdoor dining spot but our diner was rushed. Entrees arrived 2 minutes after salads which arrived 2 minutes after appetizer. Incompetence or trying to turn the table?"}
{"text":"I really enjoy Yardhouse-I've been to this one twice now and went to one in San Antonio awhile back.   

It all starts with that huge selection of draft beers.  The house IPA is fine, but I liked the Deschutes Fresh Squeezed better.   The house White Ale was good, per my wife.

Hits in terms of food were the truffle fries (well worth an extra $1), and I had the Cuban Pork Dip, which was great.  Thin sliced pork on a roll with good veggies and condiments and the red mojo dip on the side was the perfect amount of heat and spice.

The atmosphere is relaxed and the food and drink menus have just about anything you can think of for lunch, dinner or happy hour."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Sometimes there's a long wait, but I am willing to go because I like the food. I've gotten a sandwich and fries. One time I got a burger and I wished I would have gotten something more unique."}
{"text":"Used to love Yardhouse until one happy hour evening.  The bar was quite busy as usual, we asked a bartender if she could let us know if someone is leaving soon as we'd take their seats. We were informed that they could not do so as it was \"First come, first served\" service. Fair enough. As we could not find 2 seats by the bar, we were looking for someone leaving soon. After 10 minutes we finally spotted a couple getting ready to leave, we immediately jumped there. Once we sat down, another bartender came to us and told us those seats were reserved for another couple that was waiting. Hmmm didn't another waiter has just told the opposite??? We were quite upset and were not going to leave since there were no reservations taken for a bar and we were the first to spot those vacating seats. The bartender called a supervisor who yet told us the same thing that a couple was waiting before us and those seats were reserved. She was quite rude about that too. 

We were sooo angry, we called up a regional manager who took 20-30 minutes to arrive; he did, however, straighten the situation but we were way too pissed to enjoy a meal and drinks. We left shortly after. The experience was qite bad, I will not be visiting Yardhouse at Red Rock again."}
{"text":"I found out that Yard House is not as fun when you're sober and eating with your inlaws. I'm gonna have to come back here when I can enjoy a beer.

Appetizers were seared tuna, crab cakes, and coconut shrimp. I love the wasabi sauce, crab cakes and shrimp were ok.

Seared scallops over orzo pasta. Not bad, uneven sear on the scallops but they were still tasty and not overdone. Orzo pasta was nice and slightly al dente."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to visit.  I am always in the mood for Yard House.  Exiting appetizers, awesome entrees, great beer on tap and good music keep me coming back.  This a great place to get flame grilled, blackened or macadamia nut crusted fish.  I'm addicted to the pure flavor of the flame grilled Monchong, when available, accompanied by that delicious mango/papaya chutney.  Reminds me of the seafood I love back home.

My beverages of choice when I'm there are Greatness and Eclipse."}
{"text":"Love this place. Delicious food and drinks. Service was great. No complaints. Will come here again in the future. A+"}
{"text":"Our waitress Ashtyn was very attentive; providing excellent service.  The spicy jambalaya was \"spicy\" and flavorful."}
{"text":"There is vast selection of food choices. Burgers to vegan. We chose to order a Brussels sprouts and potatoes appetizer, along with a truffle cheeseburger, with truffle fries. Both were delicious. Also drinks were well crafted, and the beer options were fantastic."}
{"text":"All I can say is beer for days! They have a very large list of different beer plus they have their opwn signature beers. If there's a beer you've never tried , they are more than happy to bring you a sample. Out of all the food my favorite is their lobster burger, it is served with a regular burger pattie but then topped with lobster chunks. Also they have skinny style fries, very good. 

If you are feeling extra maughty the brownie cake is great. Its hot brownie baked into a skillet topped with ice cream."}
{"text":"My cup runneth over with beer. Yard House is to beer what Cheescake factory is to cheesecake. Sporting an impressive amount of beers on tap with a few rarities rotating in and out, Yard House is a beer lovers dream.

Alongside their massive beer selection is a suprisingly delicious selection of food. Ranging from Korean BBQ to Jamaican Jerk. I have never tasted a dish I did not enjoy at Yard House. My personal favorite being their (Mac + Cheese)2. Take your typical mac n cheese, replace the elbow macaroni with some campanelle pasta, throw in some chicken, bacon, truffle oil, mushrooms, and breadcrumbs, and you have the makings one of the best mac n cheese dishes I've ever had.

It can be a bit pricey at times and it is almost always busy (I've seriously never seen this place have a slow day), but good food and a great beer selection keep me coming back"}
{"text":"I love Yard House! I ordered the Caribbean Chicken and Penne, and it was awesome! I would definitely go back and order this again! The service was good, too!"}
{"text":"Awesome food great service  definitely coming back when we're here next time.   Thank you for suggesting blacken chicken torta.  Thank you Tiffany and Aaron !!"}
{"text":"Service was super slow which would not have been a big deal if the place was packed. It was a slow afternoon here, and I sat out side with a buddy to have a couple drinks and lunch before catching a Cactus League game at Camelback Ranch. The food was awesome I must say. The beverage selection plentiful. They just need to step up the service. I understand waiting on food, but waiting on a drink is a bit frustrating and unacceptable."}
{"text":"So many options, vegan too. I highly rec the quinoa salad for vegans (so unique and filling) and the vegan burger for when you want heartier less healthy food! Whole Gardein (vegan meat brand) menu! Such a good idea. Expect a wait. Mexican options are mediocre/\"bar food\"."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. I went for a friends birthday. Upon arrival, we were seated promptly and greeted by our waiter. We ordered drinks and were given time to fully look over the menu without being hounded. Our drinks arrived and we placed our orders. The atmosphere was relaxing but keep in mind this place is popular so there were several people around us. Our food came. I had the roast beef dip. It was fantastic. The sandwich was full of flavor and the fries were crispy. The waiter came by and offered my friend with the birthday a choice of mini desserts. The dessert came on a decorated plate along with a candle. It was a nice gesture from the restaurant to celebrate birthdays. I liked how it wasn't over the top: no parade of waiters and no singing. Perfect if you're looking to celebrate without a big event. Overall it was a great experience and I'd go back again just to enjoy a nice meal."}
{"text":"Had some friends in town and wanted to take them to town square area to experience the night life. They chose Yard House so it was our first trip here. They were pretty busy so we had about a 45 minute wait time to get seated. We took a quick stroll around the area and when we returned we got seated shortly thereafter. We were quickly greeted by our server who was knowledgeable about the menu. We placed our drink order and began looking over the vast choices in the menu. We then placed our order and received our food about 30 minutes later which was surprising given the amount of people there. The food was excellent and really hit the spot. I would have loved for the prices to be a little lower but overall I think it was worth it do to the customer service our waiter gave us."}
{"text":"I use to go to Yardhouse all the time and I would eat the Ahi tuna.  This time, I walked in and ate it and immediately got sick.  We notified the manager and then went to, literally, throw up.  I threw up the ahi and went back to the table and felt completely fine.  The manager told me that it takes six to eight hours to get symtoms, but it clearly was the tuna."}
{"text":"gave yard house a second try and it was much improved!!!! I love how many options they have. I got the tofu lettuce wraps and the sauces were amazing. I also gave the ahi salad a second try and although I was so full, it was incredible. My favorite ahi salad around!!! I'm really happy I went back. My date also loved his chicken noodle soup. the pineapple mule was good but you have to love pineapple. It wasn't super sweet which was nice. Thanks yard house!!! Will be back"}
{"text":"Very pleased! Ordered the French onion soup...it was a little cold but my waiter was quick to get me a new piping hot bowl...it was gooey and delicious! Ordered the pastrami sandwich with the jalapenos! Yum-oh!!!"}
{"text":"I love everything I have ever tried at YardHouse. The only reason I can't give them 5 stars is because they no longer serve Lindemans Framboise, my favorite. For food I would recommend the Spicy Tuna Roll, Garlic Noodles, Chicken Enchilada Stack, Turkey Burger Sliders, Lobster and Crab dip and I can go on forever.  I've never tried it, but I hear their Mac and Cheese is amazing. Their food is delicious and they have an extensive beer selection. They also have a great happy hour!"}
{"text":"We picked this place based upon the rating. Let me first say that the service was excellent. We had a great waiter and always had a full drink. There was three of us dining for lunch and my husband and I ordered the grilled chicken avocado sandwich. The third person order the cheeseburger. My rating is based on the time it took for our food to come out and the ratio of food to the price. The piece of chicken on the sandwich had to be about three ounces max for a $14 sandwich. It was good but I wouldn't order it again. The burger seemed to be the best value since it looked to be about 5-6 ounces of meat. In the future I might just visit for beers."}
{"text":"Awesome service. Being a vegan it's hard to eat out and Isla made sure my food was prepared for my eating lifestyle multiple times. That's really hard to find! Awesome place!"}
{"text":"Too expensive.  A beer, after tax & tip, is $7+.  that's just too much.  Four peaks beer is $6, while same beer at the actual 4-peaks is $4.  

The atmosphere is great.....and the food is pretty good.....but give 3 stars because both food & beer are just too expensive compared to similar joints"}
{"text":"I really, really like this place. It's good for any occasion and just about everyone can find something they'd like to eat or drink on the menu.

My parents were in town and we were exploring the Linq, and we wanted something good that wasn't going to break the bank. I suggested the Yard House and so glad I did!

I had the house IPA, which I really liked, and my parents had a watermelon beer and a tangerine beer, both unusual but good. For dinner, I had carnitas street tacos and my dad had the Baja fish tacos. We both liked the tacos a lot, but I didn't care for the rice on the side. It tasted like overly spicy Rice A Roni. However, my dad liked his. My mom got the lamb burger. She really liked it and said it was one of the best burgers ever. I really like lamb burgers but didn't try it due to the feta.

For sure I will go back again, to any of their locations. I always have a good time and leave generally happy with the food and service. This is a great restaurant group and hope they keep up the awesome."}
{"text":"Once in a blue moon, the gastronomical stars align, and my fam and I have a truly great, fun dining experience.  Our first trip to Yard House was such a time!  As soon as we walked in, we were pleased by the timeless classic rock music being piped through the establishment's speakers.  2 thumbs up!  You could easily tell the 50 and over crowd by the way some were mouthing the lyrics (myself included) and 'bobble-heading' to Elton John, Pink Floyd, Journey, Kiss, and Led Zeppelin, just to name a few great bands playing.  There were also ample HDTV screens interspersed throughout the place as well to rock your jock.  The environment was loose and lively, and our server Bre was exceptional.  We ordered the blue crab cakes (comes with passion fruit buttery topping on the side), and the hummus with Kalamata olives, which were excellent.  I had the seared Ahi tuna steak sandwich (got it with a side of honey dijon mustard) which was delicious.  Our 10 year old was happy with her chicken strips (they have a kid's menu too) as well.  The grand finale was their delectable, mouth-watering salted caramel butterscotch pudding.  OH SO GOOD!  My only criticism was that the menu is on the expensive side, compared to other national chains we frequent.  That said, we had a great time, and will return soon.  Very cool place."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to go to when we have friends or family in town when we can't decide where and what to eat. They have a vast variety on their menu even for picky and health conscious eaters. You can order from small plates to share or you can even have it as your meal. Did I mention they have an extensive list of beers.

Every time were here, the service is consistent whether their busy our slow. They do get very busy!"}
{"text":"They have a vegan section on their menu!!! Love this place. Love that they have the golden knights on every tv when they play."}
{"text":"One of my biggest pet peeves about restaurants is when you're served and then a table that came 10 minutes after you already has their drinks&food before you even received your cocktail. Umm, yeah that's going to kinda make me a little upset. 

I've frequented this location NUMEROUS times, but today was probably a weirder experience. Our server, Jenn seemed very excited to get a nice hefty party of 8 at the table next to us! They seemed like a nice crew, beers and appetizers all around, you know the gang just talking about workflow drama. Our server was definitely more interested in the energy from that table, rather than the quiet somber table of two we had. Don't blame her, make your money girl. I just wish she wasn't so monotone, we are here to get a head change and she's killin the vibe a bit! I couldn't take her recommendations of food seriously because she didn't seem enthusiastic about anything she was naming. 

This used to be THE happy hour spot, but lately I've found other hot spots to hit up! The portions have definitely changed over the last few months, which I should have asked if that was a major difference on the menu since my last visit. I enjoyed some skinny margaritas, because I've taken months off of drinking to focus on my fitness so I didn't want to drink my calories in alcohol! They were okay! I definitely felt a buzz but I just wish the drinks came at a consistent pace to keep the vibe going. Other than that, the lemon drop was alright but the skinny cosmo martini is one of the better ones, in my opinion. 

The appetizers have changed so much, I'm sure the other reviews have pointed that out as well. I enjoyed the Hawaiian pizza and spinach dip(to die for!) The poke nachos & fried calamari are on such a big plates, I'm not a seafood eater so I felt bad my poor date had to chow all these seafood apps by himself. 

Other than that, I feel sitting at the bar provides you the best service! 



UPDATE: 10/2 I just checked my credit card app & it looks like my lovely server Jen changed the numbers on my tip to leave herself a nice $21.46 tip! Man, was I generous or what?! HAH! good thing I caught this talking to my friend about credit cards and debt and stuff haha. Wow, I feel betrayed, however the manager Allison definitely took charge on this one. 

I'm still in disbelief that someone changed the numbers on something I AUTHORIZED to an amount they DESIRED. I'm very sad one of my favorite locations would employ someone that could potentially do this on a regular basis. Please double, if not TRIPLE check your receipts before leaving! I'm still in shock. I'll be doing a survey, contacting corporate and going down later this week to verify my signature and speak with management in regards to this. 

Wow..."}
{"text":"Excellent food....a bit noisy to carry on a conversation.
I had fish and chips and it was delish,  with fries so crispy.
Hamburg for hubby. Big and yummy..."}
{"text":"If you are a tourist looking to take a nice break from the Sports book to watch a game, this is a great place to head!! They have a ridiculous variety of beer and their food is great. I personally enjoy people watching on their patio over some sliders. They have a large menu, so even the healthy people in your group will be satisfied. Nothing beats their happy hour!"}
{"text":"If you like affordable prices and great bar food you should check out the Happy Hour at the bar. I have a pretty predictable order. I like to get a few pints of angry orchard, the nachos and the poke which are all part of their happy hour promo. 

The bartenders at this location are all very friendly and easy to chat with. The only downfall is that despite the bar being HUGE it can still be a challenge to find a seat or two at the bar at times. I try to avoid this place mid-games because there are never any bar seats open."}
{"text":"Love this place. This is great for large groups of friends. Excellent beer list with over 100 to choose from. Food is not bad but a little expensive. The atmosphere is loud and fun filled. TVs on showing sports and lots of laughter. They don't take reservations though.I recommend this place for the drinks and people watching."}
{"text":"I've eaten here probably 5 times, a local to the area. I came in on a Tuesday night, sat at the bar (as usual) had a new bartender, whom seemed to have so many other things to do than simply take my order. He finally came over and I ordered a blue moon with a splash of peach schnapps. I finish my drink and proceed to pay my tab. The bartender had charged me for a 'shot' of peach schnapps that had cost $7.25. My beer however cost $6.50. I had asked the bartender and he was no help. I then asked the manager, Francis, why my splash of peach schnapps had cost more than my entire beer. He responded, \"sorry, that's how much it costs.\" He was absolutely no help and didn't seem to care a guest was upset. Things like this go to show the lack of care management has at this particular establishment. I will be happy to never dine there again."}
{"text":"Even if you're not big into beer - the food is delicious!! Started off with the organic tomato basil soup which had cheese sprinkled on top. Then ordered their signature Mac & Cheese dish which had portabello mushrooms, shredded chicken and bacon. Mmmm it was soooo good I had to force myself not to finish the whole thing so that I can have room for the desert I saw on the menu. We ordered the mini creme brulee that had bananas as a garnish and chocolate on the bottom. (I added a picture of it.) Great place to go to if you have the munchees!! Great service as well - you won't be disappointed.

**Side note - I was wearing my mom's watch which fell off and I didn't even notice until the hostess came and asked us if anyone was missing a watch. Thank goodness there are still honest people in this world!!!  Thank you, Yard House!!"}
{"text":"We had our first experience with Yard House in Hawaii and it was great. This location, not so much! My wife had the French Onion Soup which she described as bland, overly thick and just so-so overall. She also had the Ahi Tuna Salad which was equally as uninspiring. My Son had the Caesar Salad which literally had two croutons and some lettuce for $6.95. The Turkey Burger was overcooked and just kind of blah. I had the BBQ Ribs which were unusually tough and barely room temp. The creamed style corn was made with fresh corn. I know because mine was soupy, way too sweet and it was full of corn silks, corn husks and little pieces of corn cob! The BBQ Beans were way over-seasoned with cilantro? Just tasted bad! A GENUINE COLOSSAL DISAPPOINTMENT!"}
{"text":"New training please. Asked for house wine they called it cheap wine. Silverware taken away then we were blamed. Four people talking and rushing the whole order. No one rushed to take the plates and we just worked around those. We didn't take away tips and will return but we can do better."}
{"text":"We waited in line to get in after the Coldplay concert, but the line moved quickly. Once inside we did a lap around the bar, packed. On our way out, we asked the hostess \"How long's the wait?\" Hostess \"None\"

We were immediately seated and our waiter was very friendly and attentive. The food was standard bar fare. Burgers and the like, I had the sliders and they were good.

The beer list was big. I'm from Portland and we love our beer up there and it was nice to see that many unique and hard to find beers on one list. 

My only fear with a beer list that great is how long they keep beer on tap. Meaning, I order some fancy pants euro brew, has that keg been tapped for a week or 6 months?"}
{"text":"Superior Service by Dave getting our group of 16 seated in a timely manner, also your bar staff is awesome! (Las Vegas) Shout out to Chris & Ryan excellent service!"}
{"text":"My wife and I joined our community's monthly dinner group outing and we are glad that we did decide to go. 

Although a little dark, the restaurant has a very sleek, modern look. The bar looks amazing and there are lots of TVs.

The beer menu is the largest I have ever seen. I had a Brooklyn Lager and later a coffee/peanut butter porter, both of which were very good. 

The food menu is equally impressive. There are plenty of appetizers, entrees and sandwiches (including a selection of faux chicken sandwiches). 

My wife and I ordered the queso dip w bacon chorizo appetizer, which excellent. Our friends ordered an onion ring tower and enjoyed this as well. We each ordered a burger. I had the pepper jack and she the BBQ bacon burger. They are very large and the bun was fresh. Her burger was served warm, at best, but she didn't return it since we were dining with a group and didn't want to hold things up. My burger was served hot and was excellent. I substituted clam chowder for the fries and the soup was also very good. One of our friends ordered the Parmesan crusted pork loin. The portion was large and he enjoyed it. 

The service was excellent!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came to this Yard house for my birthday.  We had such a great experience and a great time!  The waiter named Brenden was so awesome and attentive.  He made my birthday extra special! Thank you!"}
{"text":"The food was good we had the jambalaya linguini and vampire tacos. So good! The waiter was nice and manager gave my fiancé any beer on the menu on the house because they were tapped out on the beer he wanted."}
{"text":"I work nearby, so I've been to this Yard House location a number of times over the last few years. We've even had some work functions here, going away parties and the like. Realized I hadn't put up a review, and since I just happened to be back earlier this week, I figured it was about time. 

If I had to sum up all my experiences here, I'd probably use the word mediocre. I've tried many of the appetizers and a handful of the mainstay lunch items, but nothing has ever come close to striking me as above average. Whatever I've eaten here, I can and have had better somewhere else. I guess that's forgivable in some places, but for the price they charge and the all hoopla, I'm disappointed that nothing truly stands out. 

Another gripe I have, that keeps me from giving more stars, is the ridiculous size of the menu. You literally get a tome handed to you, weighing about five pounds and, to quote our server, \"we change our menu pretty often.\" Yeah, just so you're clear, that's not a good thing. What's the issue, you can't find some stuff you do well and stick with that? Sarcasm aside, I seriously wonder if that's what's up. 

Like the taste, food quality is so-so here on most of the meals and appetizers that I've had. Buns are usually stale on the burgers, or toasted to death so they crumble apart when you try and eat the thing (one of my pet peeves). Burgers requested 'well done' typically gets you a hockey puck. The tomato soup, which I had on the visit earlier this week, was mid-grade at best. I've actually had better tasting out of a can, and that's no joke. I ordered a turkey club sandwich as well, which comes with avocado slices. To put it lightly, they weren't edible so I yanked them off. The stuff was too mushy and nasty, even for an avocado slice and the texture was just grossing me out. Definitely not fresh cut. Bread on the sandwich? Yup, semi-stale as expected. Seeing the pattern here? 

Service is another thing that's just hit or miss, and often times simply mediocre. I see so many more staff running around and talking to each other than I see at tables and helping diners, but I can never understand why. Servers have often seemed disengaged here, either they don't care about tips or, in the extreme, they've been just plain rude. I don't recall a single visit where service has been exceptional, however. Why is that? 

As I've said of other places I've been dragged for work related events, I'd go back but probably only if someone else, or the company, was paying for it. I wouldn't warn anyone away from this place based on my own experience, but I don't think I'd really recommend it over anyplace else either. They're OK, but that's about all I can really say, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Happy hour, Thursday 5ish, party of 3, restaurant was fairly empty, first timer, sat on patio, we ordered pomegranate and strawberry margaritas, rose garden beer,  marguerita pizza, deviled eggs, and chicken nachos, *mind blown* the deviled eggs were the best thing I've ever tasted. The chicken nachos were huge and worth every penny, the pizza was good to one. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Got the ribeye mega delicious, mashed potatoes spinach and grilled tomato. Got seated pretty quick. Will come back here again."}
{"text":"Awesome! Mac and cheese was amazing. Pot pie was soooooo fresh and delicious. Can't wait to come back and try everything else. Our waiter Benny was awesome!!! Suggested some awesome stuff and kept us happy from beginning to end. A new regular spot!"}
{"text":"Now that the crowds have mellowed after the opening, it is not quite so crazy on Wed night when I am at Red Rock.  

The food has been better than at the Town Square location and the atmosphere is a lot nicer.  You see a lot more families here, and of course tourists, but that's ok.  

Still it's all about the beer, and that is why I visit frequently.  The great selection of half priced appetizers during happy hour doesn't hurt either."}
{"text":"AWESOME spot! Bartenders are very knowledgable about beer selection (as they should be) food is good, not the best, but good! Friendly and fast service."}

Not the best experiences ordering but they are always taking care of things.  


Great huge selection no one can hate"}

{"text":"The one star I give this establishment is for the bartenders Oz and Kyle. I met my husband here tonight at 615. The manager on duty( some guy- didn't get his name cuz he didn't talk to me) decided to tell my husband that he had 2 drinks ordered within 30 minutes and basically cut him off. My husband wasn't causing trouble with anyone or acting out of sorts.  He was not intoxicated. Then someone from behind the bar took my glass and did not ask me if I wanted another. Oz came by and took care of me but for my husband- the bartenders couldn't do anything without the managers permission. Also- my husband had 3 appetizers more than 1/2 eaten when I got there. The manager came up and asked if we needed a box. I WAS OFFENDED- I worked in restaurants , I felt like he was trying to get rid of us. Corporate letter goes out tomorrow- if you drink more than 2 drinks beware! I will gladly take our business elsewhere"}
{"text":"I'd had the best Cobb salad in a Yard House in Hawaii last fall, and I was really looking forward to a great Cobb salad again from my local Phoenix Yard House. I wasn't disappointed. 

My party of four did not make a reservation but were seated right away in a booth close to the door. I'm not a beer drinker and really you should be when you come here because there were yards of beer choices. There were also several cider choices, and I chose a pear cider. The option of a \"shorty\" was also very much appreciated for those of us who don't drink a lot.

I ordered the Cobb salad with shrimp, no egg and no ranch dressing. I had requested oil and vinegar instead, but when my salad arrived, I had to ask for the oil and vinegar again. No biggie, really. They were busy.

The shrimp on the salad were very flavorful and the rest of the salad was also perfect. I little different from the one that I had in Hawaii, but that may be because they use seasonal ingredients? I loved it all--the bleu cheese, edamame, bacon, and I ate it all (the large size) minus that one bite my hubby ate. Of course, that meant there was no room left for dessert. Oh well, maybe next time."}
{"text":"I had brunch today with my mother and we had a great experience! The food, the service and the pricing are excellent. I am NOT a fan of chain restaurant and I never recommend them...this restaurant is my exception! Lunch! Awesome! Bring your friend and enjoy a beer or cocktail before heading back to work!"}
{"text":"Yard House seems to be everywhere I go. It's undeniable that their plethora of options makes it a desirable place for lunch or dinner. I wasn't feeling a majority of the items and decided to order the Korean BBQ beef appetizer since it came with a little bit of veggies, grains, and meat. The entire meal was great until I discovered a raw piece of beef on my plate (see attached photo). 

Hope they aren't serving all their guests raw meat!"}
{"text":"I'm baaaaack. We gave YardHouse another try and our experience was definitely better - but the Santana Row location will always be home. 

We decided to come for lunch and since the weather was beautiful we decided to sit outside. I have NO IDEA why YardHouse does this but they sit people when their servers are at lunch. The logic makes NO SENSE to me because how is there supposed to be service at a table when the server assigned to it is off the clock. Right? I'm not sure either. This happened last time and it happened again. Thankfully the server wasn't on lunch for a godly amount of time and we were actually able to get our order in in a timely manner.

The food seems really consistent location to location and you can't get me away from their french fries or  BBQ Ranch chicken salad but seating your customers in an area that won't get any service needs to change. Until then, this place is still just \"ok\""}
{"text":"One star Ann down there must be smoking crack because this place is awesome! Took my fiancé here for dinner and we both had a great time. The staff was incredible, we had multiple managers check in on us and other waiters refill our drinks, they really worked as a team. As for the food, it was also incredible. I had the baja tacos and they were the best I've ever had. Will be returning again soon!"}
{"text":"I am giving yardhouse 5 stars for the awesome Valet that is right outside the door (let me keep my truck parked over night so I could get home safely by another means) ; the awesome Thai pizza we tried, the excellent service we received, the crazy busy environment for a Friday night gathering and just an all out good time had by all. Try the Gummy Bear shots here. Nick makes them awesome but wont tell me what is in them. Will be googling to see if someone has the \"Secret\" recipe :-)"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place with a girlfriend and have some dinner and drinks. I've heard a lot about the place and I work really close to it, although I didn't know exactly where it was. 
It is really confusing getting there when looking at GPS. You kind of already have to know where this place is to go there. Whichever, we found it. 
I had the spicy chicken breast sandwich. It was really good. My french fries were cold when they came out. A bit disappointing for how pricey a sandwich is. I told my server and he ran straight back and got me some hot fries. My girlfriend had the chicken tortilla soup. I tried a bite. Oh, the flavors in this were amazing. So good. She also had an asada street taco. Smallest taco with the biggest price! It was too spicy for her until she took the peppers off. But otherwise, she thought it was pretty tasty. 
The beer, oh the beer. I love beer. The beer menu and the beers on tap is the amazing part of this place. Over 130 beers on tap! Love it. I was feeling fruity so I tried a Four Peaks Arizona Peach and a Sea Dog Bluepaw Wild Bluberry. Both were very good. My girlfriend got a House Honey Blonde and a House Belgian Amber Tripel. Both of those were delicious as well. That is the best part of this place. 
They did have sports going on, but I'm not into basketball, so that didn't do it for me at the moment. Maybe if it was some hockey going, I would have been into staying longer. 
The service was excellent. Our server was always there asking if we needed anything else. Totally on top of it. 
Too highly priced. A sandwich and 2 beers for over $30 with tip is too rich for my blood. I'm sure I will visit again. It was a pleasant experience. Great beers, good food and great service, just way too expensive."}
{"text":"The service here is excellent. I came in last night for drinks with a friend.  I told Lauren, the bartender, what kind of beers I like and she had plenty of amazing recommendations for me.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of macaroni and cheese. Yard House has (Mac Cheese)2. You gotta love macaroni and cheese squared. They put chicken and mushrooms and bacon, yes I said bacon in the macaroni and cheese. That would make shoe strings taste good. Then, you have all those choices of beers. I chose Spaten because I love German beer. I'm not sure why my husband picked a bacon and cheese burger. I guess he just wanted something to munch on while drinking the endless variety of beer. Ok, the burgers are good, too.  I'm just giving him a hard time. I don't think I've had anything I didn't like at Yard House. The service was excellent and I had a fabulous time there. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I eat more often that my wallet allows me too. It's worth it, though. Awesome servers and bartenders. They treat you as you should be treated. I'm thinking I might go back today, in fact."}
{"text":"First let me say I have visited yard house locations around the country and have always enjoyed them, but based on my first visit to Westlake I was very disappointed.

They use a different recipe for the jalapeño tartar sauce with fish and chips and I'm pretty confident it was out of a grocery store jar. 
Ordered French onion soup to go for my husband and they put the bread in the broth. by the time i got home He only had a tiny amount of broth left and a soggy piece of bread and a lump of cheese, pretty disappointing.

I did let them know via my receipt feedback and must say they were very responsive and sent a gift card for my trouble. 
That earned brownie points but I will need to go back to see how much the food/service improves.

My son enjoyed his pork chop and said he'd order it again."}
{"text":"I sit at the bar so service is fast and the bartenders are friendly sometimes even funny. ;)"}
{"text":"Mmm~  I love their strawberry beer Try it with your dessert! 
Servers are very knowledgeable with the menu, and  their happy hour deal is very good:)"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME! Great food selection (literally a little bit of everything!) and 145 beers on tap! Amazing happy hour as well! Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Yardhouse dozens of times here in Las Vegas, and while I usually avoid chain restaurants with so much incredible food options in our valley, I've always made Yardhouse an exception. They have an excellent beer selection, which is the primary reason I keep coming back. 

A buddy and I hit the Yardhouse for dinner this last Saturday before the UFC fight. The wait was fine, and we were seated a nice corner booth. The young lady who sat me was super friendly and attentive. Once my buddy arrived, we had to wait far longer then usual for our waitress to grab drink orders and refills (which were beers). 

The calamari appetizer was on point. I ordered carnitas and pork belly tacos, which comes with a side of rice and beans. When the food arrived, it was cold and I was to hungry to send it back. The carnitas taco was flavorful, but the pork belly (which was a micro portion of meat) was bland, and the fatty part was not crispy, which is how I've always had pork belly served. Couple that with being cold, and I spit the fat out into the napkin. Gross. Maybe the pork belly bao at Fat Choy restaurant has ruined me when it comes to pork belly. 

My buddies fish & chips were good, with a healthy serving of fries. I hope the food issue was just a bad night for Yardhouse. In the past, I've always enjoyed the food. I hope they get it fixed, especially with all the close by competition in Town Square. Cheers!"}
{"text":"We love the Yard House! Always get consistent quality in the food and the beer is ice cold! My wife loves the little 8oz shorty beers ( she is not much of drinker ). Great place every time!"}
{"text":"Yard house is one of my favorite chain restaurants. Love their Rose Gardens and all of their apps. I really enjoyed this location in Scottsdale fashion square as well"}
{"text":"We come in here too often for the same exact thing every time. Kim has got to be our absolute favorite there, she is always on top of her stuff and extremely friendly. The food is great as well as their drinks. Can't ever go wrong with the sweet tart martini or mango mojito."}
{"text":"A friend suggested we all go here Sunday night. She loves this place and said everything is great. I had soup and salad. The tomato basil was good, however it was  lukewarm. Soup should be hot. My sister had the mac & cheese which I tasted and liked a lot. My friend ordered the parmesan fries with truffle oil which also good. My hubby got the fish special not sure the name of the fish, but it was a blackened white fish with 3 dipping sauces. The fish was fresh and seasoned well.

Overall, my meal was good not great. Good enough that we'd return in the future. Btw, it's really loud in there."}
{"text":"It's the yardhouse...Hello BEER! Yummy. My husband and I sat down for a beer after going through that huge mall. We love the beer selection however still have to try the food sometime."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful early dinner. St Louis style fork ribs were fall of the bone tender and delicious. Didn't care for the bbq pinto beans too much.  My husband got the oven roasted turkey melt  from the lunch menu and it was a very large sandwich.  It very tasty. We also ordered tortilla soup, it was excellent. 
I was glad to see all the vegetarian options. Next time,  I'll be able to take my daughters to enjoy a nice vegetarian dinner"}
{"text":"Great place for date night, we usually come here on a Friday or Saturday night service is fast drinks are good, you can even sample the different beers here until you find the one that you like . we love this place"}
{"text":"I am not at all a bar food person. I would call the Yard House upscale bar food, and I have liked everything I've ordered here. Their food is very solid. Their steak and ahi tuna salads are great, and I also like their burgers. I could seriously eat their fries and aioli until I throw up, so I deduct a star for tempting me to indulge in bulimia."}
{"text":"Four thumbs down to the Yard House at Desert Ridge in Scottsdale, where we dined last night before seeing War of the Planet of the Apes at the AMC Theatres.

Positives: they have a very extensive beer list, and the wait staff is polite and attentive. The negatives, however, far outweigh the positives:

* Super noisy. The tables are close together, and you can barely make yourself understood. The music is blaring. Everyone is yelling. All you can hear is yelling.

* I had a four-cheese pizza (fontina, ricotta, mozzarella, parmesan), and it was the third-worst pizza I've ever had. Crust was chewy, not crisp. The cheeses weren't melted properly. It simply didn't taste good. Bleh.

* Carole had the Maui Pineapple Chicken (marinated, grilled with a sweet soy pineapple, vegetable fried brown rice). The chicken was over-cooked and dried out. Huge chunks of vegetables (she's not sure what kind) and the rice just didn't seem to be cooked properly; too hard. On the plus side, Carole reported that the pineapple was tasty.

For the price (not cheap), it was a terrible meal."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday afternoon for a football game. One of the best bars at Westgate. There is plenty of space, TV screens, and the food is perfect. I had the Nashville chicken in a sandwich. They also have good list of craft beers. I had a few IPAs like the one pictured which is by Odell Brewing Co. This is definitely the place to come with friends for some drinks after the game."}
{"text":"Eclipse was great. Blue moon and guiness always hits the spot after a hot day. The poke and sashimi was an added plus."}
{"text":"Way better service than I received at the other location even though this place was packed and the other location wasn't. Food took awhile for only having salads. But it was really busy so I didn't care.   I'll be coming to this location and not the town square restaurant from now on."}
{"text":"First time I've had a bad experience here. But wow was it bad. Asked two bartenders 4 questions between them. Got nothing but nodded heads they couldn't even give a verbal yes or no. Which is funny because they were talking to each other a lot. More than they were talking to any guest, no wonder they are working the day shift. Fries were really cold chicken was hot though.  They didn't put out ketchup for me and none of them paid enough attention to see my hand wave at them. So I ate without.  When I was five I waited 13 min for someone to take my cars that was sitting there. And it wasn't even the two bartenders that were serving my side of the bar... It wasn't even that busy.   No real upsides. So one star."}
{"text":"usually go to the yard house at town square, but we were kind of in the area and figured we'd stop in for happy hour.

service was great and food was great, as always. 

we ordered our usual:
poke stack
moo shu eggrolls
garlic noodles (soooo good!!!)
sashimi
california roll

and of course, leinenkugel (i never spell that right), black orchid and the bf had 2 blue moons.

our server, jessica, was awesome!!! happy hour is usually busy, but she always made sure to check on us when she made her way around our table.

if we're ever in the area, we'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"I live in Chicago and was home for a visit. My sister, her boyfriend and I went here for lunch. We sat down and it took kind of a long time for someone to come over. I work in food industry so I know how it can be, especially on a lazy Sunday. I went over to the host stand and asked if someone could come over. Trisha came over got our drinks out right away which was nice. Ordered our food, wanted our soups to come out first. They came out with the entree instead which was fine and the food was really good!!! I got the chicken schnitzel sandwich it was delicious! Trisha apologized for the soup mishap, offered free dessert and then bought our soups!! So nice! I work somewhere that does stuff like that so I really appreciated it! Really recommend, very diverse menu and laid back atmosphere. Awesome beer selection!"}
{"text":"Soooooo tasty!!! We decided to get off the strip with a local friend who suggested the Yardhouse. I've tried the one in San Diego which is OK so I didn't have high expectations, especially since this one is in a big mall. Well, the food and service were excellent. We had a couple of salads, the lettuce cups, ahi sashimi, mac n cheese and the beef dip. All excellent, but that shashimi won over 2 non-raw-fish eaters at the table. It was really outstanding. We will definitely be eating here when we're in Vegas again!!"}
{"text":"Visited for lunch on Saturday and it was a good experience overall.  The menu has many varied options, that's a plus.  We had the chicken nachos, Ahi sashimi and California roll (deconstructed).  All the apps were excellent.  For entrees we had the Shrimp and Calamari Diablo, which was outstanding and very spicy, and the Nashville Hot Chicken, which was also very good.  The service was prompt and professional.  They lost a star for one of my pet peeves; the apps, salads, and entrees all ended up on the table at the same time.  They were not able to time out the courses correctly, so we had about 13 plates on the table at once.  We will return."}
{"text":"Went for Happy Hour on Friday and it was great.  The half price apps were giant and the service was outstanding.  I highly recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"I love yard house :) Professional staff and delicious food. For happy hour, i recommend pizza cheese/ham, garlic noodle, ck wrap, sear ahi sashimi. Calamari, ck fries sth, blue crab are kinda ok. Anyway lot of good food :)"}
{"text":"I've been to Yardhouse (Town Square) pretty often for work lunches, which are beerless, and at a beer bar like Yardhouse that is a small torture. I've also been to the Red Rock location several times for post work pints, which are less torturous.

Yardhouse is a chain, and the two locations are largely comparable. No miracles here, no surprises, no shocks. The beer list is pretty amazing, and so if I'm going here in a small group, it'll be for some sort of weird belgian quadrupel. 

Where yardhouse shines is the \"middleground\". It's a great place to go with a fussy group, or if you can't decide. There's pretty much an option for everyone- vegetarian, carnivore, no carb, the works. The price point is a little bit high, but if you've been dragged along, there are affordable options, as well as the \"impress the date you don't know at all\" sort of pricing. The food is actually shockingly good for a chain, most of the time, too. I have a had a few \"yep, that was a formula. bluh\" meals; the avacado, pepper, dry chicken and corn flatbread. That was a flavorless mess of huge chunks of slippery veg. I really don't want to feel like I have to cut a pizza-again to eat it.

But the fries are fantastic; probably one of my favorites of all time. I have no idea why. It is simply so. The soups are always spot on. The tomato bisque and the French onion are perennial favorites, and the lunch soup and salad/sandwich combo is a pretty affordable meal."}
{"text":"The first time we ate here in June it was excellent - 5 stars.  I had a sandwich that was awesome.  This a great place to watch a game as they have several TV's and ask as you check in which game you would like to watch.  We recently went back in this month and were not so pleased.  I and the fish tacos which would have been good if they weren't so overwhelmingly breaded and fried. The taste of the fried breading over powered the fish and made an otherwise healthy dish less so.  The rice and the beans that came with them did not taste good and should be reworked.  Our recent visit was 3 stars for an average of 4."}
{"text":"I have eaten at the Yard House before but this one was a new one for me. This Yard House is one of the new ones located in next to the ferris wheel where you can find lots of bars and restaurants. With it being a busy day my family decided to eat at the Yard House. I love the beer menu and I love to try the sampler where you can try a variety of beers. I enjoyed the service I received and was happy with the food."}
{"text":"Great lunch and happy hour spot .. always something good to eat.. food is consistently good.. 

At lunch time they do a good job of getting you drinks and food quickly .. on today's visit we ordered from the lunch section on the bottom of the menu .. the 1/2 sandwich, salad or soup combo is perfect size for work week lunch (no food coma from too much food)

The roast beef sandwich was good, ranch salad and some yummy crispy shoe string fries .. 

Happy Hour and the long drink menu (pomegranate, watermelon, margaritas, martinis all a must try ) makes this the perfect spot to meet up with friends before a movie, concert or sporting event."}
{"text":"Great place to dine-in and take a break from the casino. Everything tastes delicious, both food and beverages. 
I ordered the Mediterranean Seared Scallops with roasted pasilla & spicy hummus with a brown rice sun-dried tomato tabouleh; and the Mini Creme Brulee, with vanilla bean custard and chocolate topped with caramelized bananas."}
{"text":"Usually love the Yardhouse.  Went for dinner to their West Glendale location after the Cardinal's game.  We were enjoining sitting outside as it had finally cooled down enough to pleasantly dine out on the patio.  After our salads arrived, two couples came outside and all lit up cigarettes and were puffing away at us.  Not being used to this, because where we live, there are more healthy and respectful policies, we alerted our server.  She surprisingly informed us that the entire patio was a smoking zone.  Although they quickly moved us inside because this induced my asthma, it was disappointing that they allowed bar patrons to come outside and smoke next to us when this is not typical for most cities in Arizona .  When paying close to $30 per entree, I would expect a lot more class from the Yardhouse or at least a designated smoking section.  We were moved inside by the manager to a table bordering the kitchen and were harassed by staff and other patrons for sitting there.   Ok Yardhouse, get with the times...if CVS can quit smoking, so can you!  Until then, we wont be back!"}
{"text":"After pulling in after a long day of driving, I wanted to treat myself to a good meal not to far from my hotel.  I had bookmarked this place before I left Detroit because Yard House is on my short list of places to eat for a variety of reasons.

For starters, the place has a nice feel to it.  You can bring your family here, along with dates or just eat alone depending on your situation. No weird bar feel after hours!  I came midday and was seated immediately.  My server brought me a HUGE drink list which I scoured as hard as the menu in regards of what to eat on their menu as well.  Fortunately, the server was nice enough to show me their lunch specials that they have from 11-5 daily (not sure about weekends) and it was right on point for my appetite.  I went with the french dip half sandwich and French Onion soup which was right on point for hitting the spot.  

Even though I passed on booze, this is the place to go if you want drinks.  They have these huge glasses that are dam near the size of my arm if not bigger.  I didn't need that much booze, but the alcohol selection here is top notch.  Food was delicious and my service was really attentive and right on point. I love eating here when I can, even though it's on the pricier side when I'm dining alone.  But, coming here is a treat for me since I used to go here semi regularly when I lived in Phoenix.

They have happy hour specials, but since I was there to early, I wasn't sure what the specials were.  They also have a great patio area with plenty of tables to sit at and enjoy the weather when it's nice.  Plenty of TV's throughout the place with different sports games on depending on where you're sitting.

Overall a great place with lots of offer in regards to ambiance, food selection, beer options and service.  I enjoyed my experience here and will try to return before I go back to Detroit!"}
{"text":"I love Yardhouse!  TONS of beer and alcohol selection, great menu and wonderful service. I hate here today after shopping at the new outlet mall across the street, and decided to stop in at the last minute for a quick meal.

I went with a cheeseburger, fries, Dr. Pepper and french onion soup.  It came out really good, and I had a really good time here. I wish I would have been able to get something to drink, but I felt like noon was a bit to early to start drinking, plus, I didn't have anyone to drive me home, so I passed on getting an adult beverage.

I love how this place doesn't feel like a traditional bar. It's nicely decorated, and the service is always wonderful.  They offer patio seating here as well, and I wish I was closer to a yardhouse as I would probably spend more time here enjoying their huge alcohol selection.

This place is worth the shot, and I always have a really good time when I come here."}
{"text":"I can't believe I waited this long to come here, and regret not having been in sooner.  My friend Austin went to the Yardhouse recently, and said it was good, so we went today for some lunch and what a great time we had!

Upon entering, it has a really nice open feel.  Clean, well decorated, with great staff.  HUMONGOUS beer, wine and alcohol selection! OMG!  They seem to really have it all here for just about anyone!  Austin ordered a huge beer, and we split a pizza with french onion soup.  The food was tasty, and we both walked away satisfied.  What also impressed me was the staff.  We were always getting checked on by someone, weather it was a server, the manager, or the bus boy taking our plates.

Yard house also has a lot of TV's for your viewing pleasure.  Ample space to sit and watch, weather its at the bar, table or booth.  Open space, with lots of elbow room.  No one's sitting on top of each other.  Love it!

I will be back in the future, weather its to this location or another one.  I was really happy with my time here at Yard House, and will gladly return with more friends in the future."}
{"text":"Outstanding beer! The service however left alot to be desired. I found myself being judged for what I ordered. The food took a very long time to come out as well. I ordered the wings to go alongside my beer and they came out really well! Overall I enjoyed my trip and I will likely return hopefully to a different wait staff."}
{"text":"Yard House is such a great place to eat and get a drink. This location is in the Desert Ridge Marketplace, which is in a very nice spot, nestled in the middle of the shopping center by the AMC theater. Inside of the restaurant is large and open. Definitely, can accommodate lots of people, but they have a nice outside seating as well. 

I've been to this location several times and the food is consistently good and fresh tasting. I come for their lunch specials usually and get pizza (pepperoni) paired with clam chowder or a sandwich and fries or a salad. Lunch combos run about $10 for the two items. This doesn't include a drink. Everything I've had at YH has been so good. Try the truffle fries, they're amazing!

Wait staff are always pretty friendly and accommodating. Last time I came, the waiter I had I think was new as he didn't seem to know the menu, as well as most people, do. Plus he didn't know if certain items could be replaced by something else. He was however very pleasant. I've never been here when it get's too busy, so can't comment on that. Will come back again!"}
{"text":"No Reservations available after 5 o'clock which totally sucks. They have no phone charger station which sucks. The waitress was phenomenal and extraordinary. But had to deal with a new bartender tonight who took forever to make dreams because he was new. Outside of the waitress I will not be back here again after 5 p.m."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience today 
I had the seared ahi and the Halibut
Both were incredible along with top notch service from my waiter Greg
I will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for my moms birthday last night and service was amazing!! Armando was our server and he made sure he went above and beyond for everything!

He recommended the lamb burger and it was spot on amazing!! We traded the fries for truffle fries and couldn't be happier. 

Note: bring back your artichoke (corporate read this) seriously the only reason we came to yard house"}
{"text":"Yardhouse is awesome! Either location is always good food, music, people watching and oh yes...sports!!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and had only good experiences so far. They have a huge selection of beers, several micro brews, and  lots of great food items. 

We were a party of 6 last night and we sat out the patio. The service was very quick and friendly, although the place was mostly empty. Our waiter was a bit of a low talker so it was very hard to hear him throughout the meal. 

We sat outside on the patio and I ordered the BBQ chicken salad which was excellent, little spicy but oh so good. This place is a great place to have a nice meal and a few drinks, while watching a game on TV. 

Def will be back for more."}
{"text":"Let me say this first. I love the Yard House. I been to Vegas, Palm Desert, Newport Beach and I love it. Until Denver . . .

After eating there on the 11 of October with group of 40 friends, 5 of us got so sick that some of us needed an IV from dehydration after the runs for two days.

The manager was sympathetic and promised gift cards, but they never came. After speaking to another manager tonite, I am compelled to write this review. He was dismissive and questioned whether any of this even took place! I tried to reason with him for 20 minutes, but to no avail. No apology was offered until requested and he questioned if we should even receive gift cards- AFTER WE WERE LAID UP FOR 2 DAYS OF OUR VACATION! Poor customer treatment."}
{"text":"Great place. The place is hard to find and is usually packed. If you like beer this place has alot to choose from all on tap so many choices for anybody. Food is kind of expensive but worth it. Very good food and great atmosphere with many people. If your looking for quite not the place to go. One bad thing is they don't have military discount which would make it even better but it is a great place if you want good food and great beer with many selections."}
{"text":"I really, truly, honestly wanted to give this place five stars.  The vast selection of beer is mind-boggling.  Beer after beer after beer...beers you have never heard of, eagerly waiting to be sampled.  I came in with my family for a late lunch (3:00 on a Saturday) so there was no wait.  The service was great.  I have two complaints, though.  First, the beer sampler is mediocre at best.  It was your typical six 5-oz glasses, but the choices were already set.  Whoever picked the beers for the sampler must have been feeling very uninspired, because they had two Gordon Biersch beers.  Gordon Biersch is a good beer, but I feel that with the huge selection available, it is definitely on the JV squad of beers.  If you go to Yard House looking to try something new and exotic, not just the microbrews they sell at your local grocery store, you would be better off convincing your dining partners to purchase a few different pints rather than relying on the sampler.
Second, the portabello burger was unimpressive.  The bun turned mushy and fell apart when I tried to eat it by hand.  Maybe it was meant to be eaten with a fork and knife and I am some uncultivated country rube unacclimated to the proper use of dining utensils.  But I think the primary purpose of going to the Yard House is to drink beer; having food available (even lackluster portabello burgers) is a consolation prize."}
{"text":"LOVE THEIR VEGETARIAN MENU!  I had the \"chicken\" and was pleasantly surprised!  It was delicious!  I'm not 100% a vegetarian, but I try to be when I can!  Their sample beers were great too!  Just enough to decide if you love or hate the samples.

Would go back again to one of their many chains, no doubt!"}
{"text":"Service was slow and not overly friendly. I ordered the ahi salad and it tasted as if the veggies had not been washed. My friend ordered the shrimp pasta and the shrimp was over cooked and the pasta was undercooked. I'm glad I had a gift card and didn't spend my own money."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite restaurant because the staff is phenomenal! Abe Abrams, Julia and all the staff are always exceptionally attentive and friendly. My husband and I both think the food is great and the staff is simply the best so we go here a lot."}
{"text":"I'm a returning customer and still very pleased. Each time I come here, the food is prepared fresh, the staff is friendly and location convenient to the strip. There is never a wait...at least every time I've been. I'd recommend going for happy hour, if you're looking for a deal. Otherwise, be prepared to pay for the typical Vegas-strip restaurant prices. Oh, and if you like beer, then you have to order the giant \"yard\" glass! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Great service. GOOD variety of Food on the menu. Food was great. Maui pineapple chicken was awesome. Only issue was the fried rice. Never had fried rice that had mushrooms. If mushrooms is something You like then You will like it.  You might want to let people know that there's mushrooms in the fried rice. You could get  someone allergic to them. I did look at the menu I asked the waiter what he recommended and took the recommendation he gave. But overall great flavors and customer service. Thank you"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Food is amazing and staff is friendly. Chopped salad is the best!!!"}
{"text":"Pleasant surprise. We were looking for a lunch spot between soccer games. Nit in a rush, but also did not want to wait with kids a long time. Seated right away here. I think it's still catching on.

Tons of beverage options and nice selection of light lunch options."}
{"text":"I came in with my friend after work and I was satisfied with this experience except the first half of our visit . When we got here we had Brandon as our server. We came in after working a double at our job and just wanted some good dinner. Brandon seemed very annoyed of our presence. I tried to brush it off as I am a server myself and tried to question and get his opinion about the menu item and asked him how the edamame is (mainly because I'm picky about my edamame) and he rellpied \"its edamame\". Ok so he didn't sell me there but I decided to get the hot and spicy edamame anyway, which was good-just wish he seemed more enthused about our presence. Not only that but he was very weird when he brought our drinks kind of just slid them at us and walked away. Especially when I was sampling wine he just set it there and left right away so I had to wait some more for a drink order. Anyway the last straw was when he walked up with another server and just said \"I'm leaving\" we looked at him confused \"she'll be taking over\" (Gwen) and pointed at another server who was next to him and started walking away. We did end up handing him a tip but he didn't seem to care. Needless to say we wish we had Gwen the whole time, she was great!"}
{"text":"3-1/2 stars. Sometimes they get it right, sometimes they don't. I go here because it's conveniently located in Red Rock Casino, which is 2 blocks from where I work.

- (Mac + Cheese)2: didn't smell very appetizing. After I ate it, I kept thinking I was going to get sick. I don't know if it was the wild mushrooms, but definitely not getting that again!
- Spicy Jambalaya: It was just ok, but nothing beats a Jambalaya with fresh ingredients

Service is usually good, and it's easy to fit a bunch of us into a booth. Of course we'll be back - we're regulars here and come here when we don't feel like thinking of where we'd like to eat."}
{"text":"It was my first time going to this place it was very nice the service was absolutely good talking about food it was a little pricey but I like I I liked the food. There is no good signal inside if you trying to do something with your cell phone."}
{"text":"I love beer.  I acquired my taste for beer recently (within the last two or three years), so I feel like I have some catching up to do.  Not in the \"I'm on my way to becoming an alcoholic\" kinda way, but in the \"I want to dry a different beer each time I go out\" kinda way.  That being said, this was a great place to do that.  We were looking for somewhere to just grab a quick bite to eat before we headed to the airport and this was a great solution.  The food was easy (the generic menu that you'd expect--my burger was just okay) and there's plenty of grease to go around.  The service was fast and efficient, though not overly friendly.  The decor is exactly what you'd expect from a place like this--a bit loud with way too many televisions.  

However, you can't ignore the fact that they have more beers than you can count and the waitstaff actually knows enough to recommend beers based on what you like.  I'm not sure I'd ever head back for a meal, but appetizers and beers are a definite go.  My recommendation:  any kind of wheat beer and the tower of onion rings.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Dining at Yard House
Lunch vs. Dinner.
Which do you prefer?
 
I've had two dining experiences at this restaurant and they are completely different from another. One enjoyable and one not so much. So I asked myself why. Was it the atmosphere, or maybe the time frame? 

My first time dining at the Yard House was 3 years ago around 7, maybe 8pm. Let's just say cocktail hour. Haha. I couldn't stop drooling over the huge selection of craft beers. Again this was 3 years ago. Other restaurants didn't have such a variety at the time which made their beer list quite impressive. I tasted ever beer at least once and some a few times. :-)    
I ordered the crab and artichoke dip as an appetizer and fruity cocktails for my main dish. I was on a date so I appreciated the dim lighting. I think the candles were even scented. Or Maybe I was just buzzed. Either way I enjoyed my evening.

My second time was yesterday about 2pm. In my opinion this restaurant was to loud and lacked intimacy. I was disappointed. Due to slow service I only had time for 3 cocktails. It's a brewery for goodness sake. I felt like I was in a school cafeteria. I didn't know whether to eat my food or start a food fight. I was terrified. Kids were running around everywhere. I was waiting for the servers to get trampled. 

I will never step foot in The Yard House before 8pm."}
{"text":"This place is usually better than two stars but when I was there two days ago I wasn't really impressed.

The food was good but I wasn't happy with the service. 

Our waiter messed up our order and charged us for wrong things. He went back and changed it but I just wasn't too impressed with the service. He just seemed out to lunch and not really paying attention to our needs. On a busy Friday night you need professional waiters who know how to do their job."}
{"text":"First time eating here and it was delicious. The California \"roll\" is different but really tasty. And the street tacos? YUMMMMMMM. Kudos to Rosie our server, she was awesome."}
{"text":"My girl friends and I wanted to meet up for happy hour tonight and one is vegan so she suggested yard house being that they have a small vegan menu. Yard house has never really been a go to place for me but we had to meet in the middle. This location in town square was really nice. They have outdoor patio seating which is always a plus. They offer happy hour everywhere inside not just the bar area. They have a lot of options for happy hour not just a select food like most places.  I asked our waiter which sangria she preferred and she suggest I go with the red which a little sweeter and mixed with Hennessy I loved it. I decided to go with lettuce wraps they were good I liked the 3 sauces it came with. My friends ordered a Caesar salad and calamari, the calamari was ok nothing special. My vegan friend got the \"gardien\" wings which looked like boneless chicken nuggets. I'm personally not a fan of substitute meat so when I tried it, it tasted funny with a nasty after taste. The service was decent nothing special to write home about. I would like to come back and try there entrees."}
{"text":"Yard House is always good, they have a big menu and large restaurants. It was a Saturday during dinner time and we were seated in less than 5 minutes. Our waiter was Angel, he was very attentive and quick. The only reason for a missed star is because another waiter, Stephen, dropped off our food and I asked him for ranch. He left before my mom could request blue cheese. When he came back with the ranch my mom said, \" I'm sorry, may I get blue cheese,\" and he looked off with an annoyed glare and said \"okay\" with a tone. When he dropped it off, he just walked away quickly. I understand he wasn't getting our tip but he doesn't need the attitude."}
{"text":"The food is always good, beer list is great, music is excellent. Our server, Nancy, was friendly, quick, attentive, and knowledgeable. We really appreciated her and how she went above and beyond to make us happy."}
{"text":"Typical middle class fancy dining. With that being said the food is delicious. They have killer nachos that are enough to share with the table. They also have a huge beer list which always goes over well with me. It's kind of loud but it's a huge place with a lot of seating."}
{"text":"I ate at the yard house in Las Vegas about three years ago and everything was delicious. I was excited to find out that a yard house opened up closer to where I live. We ate there this weekend and we were not disappointed. 

For an appetizer we got the Grilled Korean pork belly tacos. They are very tasty, they come with rice and beans that are equally tasty.  I haven't had anything quite like them before. We also got the Lobster, crab and artichoke dip, which was OK. It tastes good, but is nothing special and the portion is small. 

The main course is what will keep me coming back:  pepper crusted filet served with Brandy shallot cream sauce, mashed potatoes, carrots, and asparagus. the steak is tender and flavorful, and one of the best steaks I have had at a restaurant. Paired with a brandy shallot cream sauce, the steak is over top amazing. I bet the other entrées are good but I will never know.... Because I will get this steak every time.

We had a Mini cream brûlée for dessert, it was just as good as everything else. 

The restaurant itself is very loud and noisy with TVs everywhere which I personally don't care for but the food is great."}
{"text":"Modern look, lots of live plants and great lighting. The menu is fantastic and we have been frequent flyers to this spot."}
{"text":"Went there by myself Monday night.  They gave me a table not far from the door where you could feel the cold wind blowing in from the main entrance.  I immediately told the hostess I did not want to sit there, that I might as well sit outside.  

At my new table Joseph C took my order and then came back to tell me he was going on a 10 minute break.  My meal was very good, but I quickly ran out of water.  Joseph C finally came back and did get me a refill of water.  Then he disappeared again.  I finally had to walk up to the side station and get my own water.  Another waitress came over and helped me.  She asked if I needed my waiter and I said no, I've been ignored my whole meal, why would I need him now?  

So now Joseph C shows up from behind me and asks if I want some more water.  I said no, just the bill.  I love how he brings me the bill from behind so he doesn't have to face me again.  The restaurant was busy, but was well staffed.  I wouldn't show my face either if I had done such a terrible job ignoring one of my guests.  There was no reason to have such poor service.    

So overall while the food was great, the front of the house staff really dropped the ball, leaving a bad taste in my mouth.  But with the money I saved on the no tip for Joseph C, I had some great ice cream at Ben & Jerry's."}
{"text":"Always busy, reservation required.
Good appetizers and drinks.
Should have a little more sides."}
{"text":"Food is amazing, service on the other hand is terrible. Our waiter Steven was extremely rude. Maybe we were just unlucky..."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the Yard House! They have great food and customer service. I have been to this location twice and have not been disappointed. I have tried the truffle fries which are delicious, the chicken nachos which are a great size and very tasty. One of my favorite dishes is the Ahi Crunchy salad. Most recently our server, Jesse, was great! He said he was new but you'd never guess it. So confident and very attentive! Can't wait to go back and have some more good food and good service!"}
{"text":"We went to enjoy the draft beer on tap. They have an amazing draft variety. They had great food and great service. The assistant manager, Daniel Hadobas as very helpful and I would welcome anyone to come here for food and beer draft!! The managers helped us through the entire process. Come to this restaurant for great service, food, and drinks."}
{"text":"The Yard House -- what happened to your yarders man!  You used to be cool, but now you submit to the man!  Darn you!  Anyways, Yard House has always been my favorite spot to try new beer.  I really do miss the yarders.  Now they have the footers (yah....)  It'll still get you whacked up for sure.  I like this Yard House for one thing - the nice rides parked in front.  Feel like a kid every time I walk by (Oh that's my car!)  Reverse Happy Hour at this place used to be the place to be, but with Kona Grill stealing all the attraction it's hard to compete.  However, if there's a game on; forget about it! :)  Appetizers here are the best order a few and share with your friends - (spicy wings are really spicy - youch!)  If you don't have friends to share with -- well that's why I miss the yarders :) - enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great food. Nice service. 

Had the ribeye wish garlic mash. So good. Also the crab artichoke dip! Walked in on a Wednesday after our flight and we were seated right away! Restaurant has a nice ambiance."}
{"text":"Tons and tons of beer here. It's pretty much the same format as compared to other one's I'm used to. But this place also has some nice seating outside as well. And for a relatively cool evening in September, the views were much better from the outside.

Besides the views, the beers came a close second. Had 3 different ones on this evening. Sea Dog Bluepaw Wild Blueberry, Pyramid Apricot and Papago Orange Blossom. Yah, I wanted to make it a fruit themed beer evening.

For food, I chose the full rack St. Louis ribs with fries since my co-workers ate all the appetizers. And I was a bit hungry. Yes, this plate is huge, however the meat a bit dry. They did include some extra barbecue sauce, but you definitely needed more. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/RtnTbhWYw4QjKhoTBV37OA?select=DNj4vVlJ1eD9XjT8ZlYGLQ

They accidentally gave me some beans and corn as well for whatever reason. So they just piled on more food for just one person. It was like a feast. And again the views from the outside was great. It's like a mall here so you see everyone walking by visiting other restaurants or do some shopping here. Plenty of free parking too."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite place in the Phoenix Metro area right now.

They have a really great happy hour, an extensive tap beer list, and a life changng veggie/vegan menu!

I am absolutely addicted to the Gardein Veggie Buffalo Wings. Beyond amazing. The tofu lettuce wraps are delish as well.

I'm really glad to see major restaurants catering to all sorts of dietary varieties versus leaving us veggies with the option of a side salad or plain pasta!

Chances are you will see me here at least once per week with a Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA and two orders of the Buffalo Veggie Wings ... sometimes twice... so if you have been waiting for that perfect moment to make contact with me, well, I suggest you hang around YH each night about 530."}
{"text":"Killer happy hour here,beats any one else! Little pricey for the quality/service at regular price but great selection of beers. Me gusta!"}
{"text":"Not sure how I didn't have a review up already...this Yard House was my very first bar when I turned 21!

Totally worth it. First of all, the beer selection is MASSIVE. You will find something you undoubtedly like. Ditch the domestics and shoot for a rare brew you're not gonna find anywhere else on tap. This is absolutely the most extensive draught selection in the West Valley, with everything from the sharp Green Flash IPA to the sweet Blanche de Bruxelles. 

Need some food to soak that up? Don't worry, the menu has got ya covered. Especially during happy hour. This place has one of the best app menus you'll find. The wings have just the right amount of heat. The pizzas are a steal--I recommend the Thai BBQ Chicken. For my vegetarians in the house, there are some options for you, too, whether it's mock-meat or straight up mushrooms and veggies. 

A small criticism I have would be the entrees, which never quite seem to hit the spot. Like the seemingly unseasoned burgers. I can't really endorse the several choices I've made outside of the app menu (well, besides their famous mac 'n' cheese). This place masters bar food, but can't seem to tackle the sit-down restaurant realm. 

Overall, I'd recommend this place for a date, or to chill out with some beer snobs and have a quick nosh. Patio seating is a blast!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Always a great place to eat or grab a drink. The staff and management is great but Garin is an amazing server. Sit in his section and he'll make your visit great!"}
{"text":"The Yard House is pretty much a typical brew pub.  Like many it is housed in a clean high-ceiling but completely sterile building.  There is no warmth or personality at all.  On the positive side, the Yard House has a huge beer selection.  But the negatives outweigh this single high point.  For example, high prices (except during happy hour).  For example, indifferent food - neither the pizza nor the pastrami sandwich was better than barely acceptable.

If hungry, in the neighborhood, and not concerned with your wallet, you might go here.  I won't return.

Hint: At lunch they have a lunch special tucked nearly out of sight at the bottom of the menu.  You get a soup or salad, plus a small sandwich or pizza at a decent price."}
{"text":"We spent Saturday night off the strip, and I liked this place! 

It's in Town Square, which is a suburban ped-mall with bars, restaurants, shops, and a movie theater, not too different from, for you Chicagoans, Streets of Woodfield or the Glen of Glenview.  

They have an excellent beer selection.  I shared the tuna sashimi and vodka sauce shrimp pasta with someone.  Both were very good!  The food is good quality and the menu varied.  

No, this isn't a big Vegas restaurant, and it's not too dissimilar from a beer/restaurant that you'd find at home.  But that makes it comfortable, and they do a good job."}
{"text":"I like that you don't have to go through the casino to get here because they have 2 entrances.. Yard House is on my list of places I frequent for only Happy Hour but not their regular menu.. haha their regular dinner menu is a bit over priced for a bar with average food but it doesn't matter because I only come for HH~!!! I've been here on several occasions for Happy Hour, late night Happy Hour, on the cusp of Happy Hour lol 

Things that I enjoy:
-Chicken Lettuce Wraps- or you can get them with mushrooms instead of chicken mmm
-Hawaiian Poke Stack- watch out sometimes the tuna is not that fresh though lol
-Spinach Cheese Dip- so bad for you but so good
-Chicken Nachos- quantity over quality.. huge portion; great for sharing
-Pizzas- pretty tasty 
-Leinenkugel's Sunset Wheat - tastes like Fruity Pebbles
-Light Lemon Drop Martini- low cal; tasty; strong
-Spinach & mushroom salad appetizer portion (not on HH) but it's delicious and cheap!

Service has always been friendly and fast. One time my boyfriend and I barely made it for the last seating and the server wasn't rude and didn't rush us! Even though this Yard House is located inside Red Rock Casino it is not owned by them so they don't accept any of the mailer coupons from the hotel~ 



HOT TIP: Happy Hour:  Monday - Friday 3pm - 6pm 
                                      Sunday - Wednesday 10pm - Close
                                      Last Seating: 30 minutes prior to close"}
{"text":"I had my wedding dinner reception for 50+ people and was a great experience here. Food was great!Management and servers were very patient with us considering it was a large party. I would like to thank servers Celal, Natalie, Eddie and manager Debbie."}
{"text":"On the last visit i came here with my wife for a mid day birthday lunch. We both had bacon burgers with blue cheese that were very good and made exactly to order. Drinks were average priced.  The half yard was a good deal tho, and definitely did the job. Always a good place to hit for a burger and beer. Go check it out if you haven't already. Perfect location too."}
{"text":"I like the ahi appetizer  yummy -"}
{"text":"I stopped in for a work lunch today and noticed that they have changed some things on their menu.  There are these little U's next to menu items that are under 600 calories, and to my pleasant surprise, they had a 5 oz. turkey burger with a salad with cirtrus soy dressing with a U next to it.  Fan-effin-tastic!!  I ordered it, despite thinking of every dry, tasteless \"healthy\" burger I've ever eaten.  My expectations were low.  Granted, I've never ordered anything at Yardhouse before that I didn't like, but the pessimism from my experience with healthy non-beef burgers trumped my consistent satisfaction with the food from Yardhouse.  

Our meals came quickly and my neat little plate of burger and salad (with dressing on the side, which I didn't even ask for, thanks server!!!) actually looked quite delicious.  Upon my first bite, I was in heaven!  It was juicy, tasty, delicious goodness in my mouth.  It came topped with roma tomatoes, which I think really sealed the deal.  At 5 ounces, I finished my entire plate and felt perfectly full, unlike most of the time when I go out to lunch and overstuff my face.  I was so happy that I promptly forgot about the annoying sales rep I had dealt with at a meeting earlier that morning. I was ready to go back to work with a renewed pep in my step.

The service at Yardhouse is always fast, efficient and friendly.  Although, I used to have this one server that would always try to upsell shots and drinks during my business meetings.  It was quite awkward, but I haven't seen him the last few times I've been, so maybe he quit when he realized the lunch crowd here was not exactly his demo.  We've always been able to get a table quickly for both lunch and dinners.  I also love sitting at the bar sometimes at night and trying new beers from their vast selection.

Yardhouse is just an all-around great spot!"}
{"text":"This is supposedly the biggest Yard House in the country, and it's pretty big. We were having my boyfriends birthday dinner here so we were a group of about 12. They don't take reservations but we were able to get seated right away upstairs. It was Monday, so maybe that's why. 

They gave us two servers, who were both really nice.  The food at Yard House is always great, so no complaints there. They even let us bring our own cake and they brought it out for us. The only issue I had was that we bought a bunch of candles to put on the cake, and they brought it out with 3 candles. 

They were also kind enough to split all our checks, but somehow there was a mistake at the end and they gave someone the wrong bill, but she paid it. We never figured out if the other girl paid her own bill as well, or paid hers. Either way, it wasn't a big deal especially since we had a large group. 

We had a great view of the observation wheel from upstairs as well."}
{"text":"50 min wait. Got seated at a table near the door in December, so kept my coat and scarf on the whole time and still froze. So loud, I could barely hear our waitress when she was right next to me. Ordered the Carnitas Street Taco meal. Flour tortillas?!?! Yuck! Tiny overly spicy sides. We won't be returning. The only reason I even gave 2 stars is that my husband actually liked his burger. He got the Black Truffle Cheeseburger. And even though I couldn't hear her, our waitress was really nice and kept our drinks filled."}
{"text":"Large and varied menu, with plenty of beers and TVs for sports; outdoor seating, too."}
{"text":"love the atmosphere at yardhouse, we always have a good time, when going here. Beer is great, they have the best selection."}
{"text":"I always have the worst luck at Yard House. They have an awesome beer selection, but the last few times I've gone, they were out of the beers I ordered. They have great happy hour specials. I didn't like the chopped raw salmon built in a pastry ring, it kinda looked like it was chewed for me before it was served. 
I love that they play classic rock. The servers are pretty friendly."}
{"text":"The Cuban sandwich is so ridiculously good! I HAVE to order one to go at least 2 times a month!!! I always sub a salad for fries and it's 2 days worth of food!!!! Love it"}
{"text":"My friends and I go here often and everything is usually awesome, so when my family came in town, I figured it'd be the same. Sadly, I was wrong. Our waitress was TERRIBLE. I had this drink a couple weeks ago and loved it, so my sister in law and I ordered one and it sucked, so we asked if we could have something different. Her demeanor immediately changed. \"that's why I told you (some ingredient) was in it.\" I told her I knew, and had already told her I liked it last time, it was just wrong this time. Her attitude sucked after that, everything she said from that point was with a sneer, she was totally condescending, and every time she checked on us after that, she didn't bother to even stop walking while she asked if we were good, and didn't make eye contact with any of us. Sucks, because I totally loved this one before. Still two stars because our food was good, as were our second round of drinks... Just a huge disappointment! Last I checked I was allowed to change my mind, especially if something tastes like shit!"}
{"text":"My whole experience at Yard House was amazing. From the waitress who was well informed and intelligent; to the food... Which is amazing. They have over 130 beers here! Anyway, I'm not a big beer person so I had more of a fruity beer, the Stiegl Radler Grapefruit. Which I enjoyed, I love grapefruit though, Lol. The calamari are a must have and the lettuce wraps are A-mazing. I ordered the penne with chicken dish, under the house favorites as well that was good. For dessert I had the trio sampler which consisted of creme brûlée, peach cobbler, and chocolate cake! So yummy. Anyway, I will be coming back."}
{"text":"They have the most extensive menu possible. There are options for different dietary needs but unfortunately no GF buns for their very tasty burgers. They do have lettuce wraps but I was missing the hamburger experience sans bun. The guacamole and chips are delish as was the hummus. For the beer conoiseoire this  place is undoubtedly heaven. Food was good, ambience was quaint and drinks were generously poured which makes for a good time."}
{"text":"This is a great place for crowds, the bar scene, outdoor seating, indoor seating and bar seating.  Great to watch sports and also to hang out.

1.  Beer - The selection of beer on draft is amazing.  Who knew about a yard glass of draft could be what the doctor ordered.  Not the cheapest beer, and a bit slow to make its way to your table.  However, very nice selection.

2. Food - A very large menu.  Plenty of Vegetarian dishes, Gardien substitute dishes as well as your Hamburgers, Pastas, Meats/ Fish, Pizzas and plenty of other items. 

3.  Service - Great service, attentive and friendly.

4.  Music - Kind of loud atmosphere.  A little too loud to have great conversations, however,  you can cuddle up tighter if need be!

5.  Waiting time - Takes a bit of the food and lots of time for the alcohol to come out and served.  Also, why not serve the food together rather than waiting 10 minutes for food to dribble out and then some getting cold?

6.  The price - Very pricey this place is.

GK says, a great place and you will pay for it!"}
{"text":"David and Rochelle make the best martinis in town. Sit at the bar and they will take care of you. Try the vodka lemon martini with shaved ice and a lemon twist, you won't be sorry.  David had been making my martininis for years now and has trained Rochelle well. You wont be sorry."}
{"text":"We've been to YH severals time but this was first time visiting at this location. I have never had bad experience at YH. 
I love their Mushroom Lettuce Wraps, Hawaiin Poke Stack, Calamari, and Spicy Thai Chicken Pizza. The food is absolutely fantastic but even better was the service. Our waiter was amazing.
 I would recommend this place to anyone and would definitely be back."}
{"text":"The bartenders make Yard House shine . . . then there's the beer . . .

There are 135 beers on tap.  There's everything from Bud Light to Belgian Trappist Ale and Double IPAs.  If you can't find something you like then you don't like beer.  In addition to a selection of seasonal brews, Yard House offers rotating beers on their Chalkboard List.  These limited run beers are available until the keg is kicked.  Then they are replaced the following Tuesday with a new label.  Be sure to ask a bartender for the current list.

Speaking of bartenders, the bar is where to go if you want quick and attentive service.  The floor servers do their best, but they handle several tables, run drinks, pile up at the service bar, etc.  Cut the line, order directly from a bartender. You'll save time and get better service. Not to mention you get a great view of the TVs . . .

If food is on your agenda, check out the street tacos (pork belly, carne asada and swordfish are top picks; white fish tacos if you're calorie conscious).  On game days, the traditional or boneless buffalo wings are a must.  Go for the chicken nachos if you're feeling indulgent (bring a friend; the dish is big enough to share).  The burgers, sandwiches, and pizzas are what I classify \"upscale bar food\".  The dishes fill you up and satisfy, but they won't win any awards."}
{"text":"The food, service & atmosphere was great.  The food  menu was extensive & enticed us to go back.  The beer menu was impressive & the half yard of beer was fun too."}
{"text":"Walking around the promenade, I stumbled upon Yard House and was pleased to see that it wasn't overly busy. 

2 words: Happy hour! I love the selection of their happy hour: 1/2 priced apps and $2 off cocktails is a great deal considering it's Vegas. Sat at the bar and service was great! The bartenders are great at what they do and are eager to keep you satisfied. The food was good and the atmosphere wasn't too loud. 2 thumbs up."}
{"text":"What a great experience today! Our server Creighton was one of the best we've had in Vegas. Good food GREAT service today,  thank you!"}
{"text":"I was staying at the hotel right next door so this place was very convienent haha Just wanted to have some drinks so the job was done! Haha I didn't have an appetite due to a late lunch so I didn't get to try any food :-( But I can tell you that I don't think I've seen a beer menu as large as the one they have lol 

Three pages of fine print all dedicated to beers! So Definitly stop in here if you're looking to have a few cold ones. The staff was very friendly and very attentive. Prices were very good and the place is huge too. Plenty of places to sit. The atmosphere was great as well- nice and lively. No complaints at all! 

Next time I'm staying in the area- I'll have to try their food!"}
{"text":"Love it, they have a great happy hour.  The spicy tuna is killer not your typical roll it is layers of tuna avocado and is just fabulous"}
{"text":"My sister and I met up with our other sister and her hub for dinner. I have never been to Yard House before. And didn't think nothing of it. I did however check out their menu online and was intrigued by the ahi poke on the menu. I love raw fish. 
So we all meet up, geez this place was super packed, and it took about an hour to get seated. Our server/waitress was very friendly and courteous. The atmosphere is like the inside of a normal sports bar.. so it was very loud. 
I would rate our server/waitress like a 10... she made sure our drinks were refilled, especially after we paid our tab.  NORMALLY once you pay for your tab.. your server disappears on ya. Well she didn't. So kudos!
They brought our main entres first.. oops. They apologized for that and the apps that we ordered were on the house.  Thanks! The ahi poke that I ordered was very tasty! It had a kick but it was soooo good. The fish and chips was good. The portions are kinda huge.. so I took some of my fish home. All in all my first exp there was amazing.  Thank you Yard House for making my first exp something to remember. I'll be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Food was ok.  I didn't know the ahi burger was a patti and not more of a filet and the server was less than ideal.  The server seemed like he didn't want to be there and took it upon himself to make me an americano and he had no knowledge of how to make it, self admitted."}
{"text":"This place is exciting.  Always vibrant and busy, which only means that people keep coming back. The food is good most of the time and the service excellent  

The fish and chips I had were pretty good, though not great.  And Ashley, our waitress, was 
 awesome and down-to-earth.  

I'm not a drinker, but my friends ordered a Shiner Bock and Shock Top. These things were 18\" tall.  Quite interesting.  They loved them.  The calamari was very good also, but the Spicy Thai Chicken Pizza, they said, was not good.  Ashley offered to replace it with something else, which was very generous, but we chose not to.  Our meal had pretty much ended by then.

It is worth visiting this restaurant. But I would suggest getting there early, it gets very crowded."}
{"text":"Beautiful & Amazing Atmosphere!!
Ellen & Seth are awesome bartenders and can recommend anything from food to drinks.. 
I went for Happy Hour and they have many choices! 
Recommend Moo Shu Egg Rolls & drink- Fat Head Blueberry. So good!
Great time."}
{"text":"If this were rated on prices, this would be a 2 star. 

I love the calamari. It costs like $11. Its way more than i'm willing to pay for that stuff, but do everytime. 

So the story goes: they have hundreds of thousands of beers on tap....yadda yadda yadda..."}
{"text":"The Fried Chicked breast with beans and corn was to die for. The waitress recommended it to me. Mein, it's so yummy. The chicken was juicy and still had that fried brown crust (not burnt) on the outside. I've never eaten corn as delicious as this one. It's as if they mixed the corn in milk, and some kind of cream...no clue what it is. what I know for sure is that it was great. The mashed potatoes and beans and the sauce...everything blended together. And it's not even that pricey. It's about $18 not including tip of course. The server was very friendly and kept checking on me and refilling my lemonade. I recommend this place with no reservations at all."}
{"text":"Mitch was my server, and he was the best ever.

I came here the other day while I was on a short family visit.   My mom was looking for a dress in Town Square, and we decided to lunch at Yard House.  Generally I am a difficult person to eat with because of my dietary restrictions, but thanks to Mitch my life was made easier.

Yard house, a veggie/vegan portion of the menu that has mock meat dishes.  This basicall means, you can can get most the items with meat on the menu, with veggie meat instead.  

I had a grilled spicy chicken sandwich on sourdough, with fries.  It was good,  not huge (which is good), and it came with Fries...The yard house fries are so good, since they use truffle oil.  YAY!  At the time i ordered my server wasn't sure if everything was 100 percent vegan, without having to ask he went out of his way to make sure I was eating no animal products. (THANK YOU!).  Having a server check with out asking is amazing.  No one ever does it, and nothing spoils a meal like hidden animal bits.  

I will come back here again, especially when I am with family or other meat eaters.  A great place for non adventurous eaters."}
{"text":"Dined here on 9/19/15 arrived at 8:15 PM. Hostess area still a waiting people to be sat so, put our name on the waiting list & we were told we would be seated in about 20-25 minutes. To our surprise- the hostess station was able to seat us all fairly quickly. Taken to our round \"table\" (seated 5, we were a party of 3 including a child). Came to find out \"WHY\" we got seated so promptly!! It was the worst location, right on the busiest corner of the bar area, tables are all located in the middle of the main floor & booths to the side walls of the restaurant. Asked our hostess if we could possibly have the \"open booth\" instead (that was directly across from it) & she claimed it was for another party, that she couldn't offer us that table or accommodate us: as there were many reservations made as well & that table was awaiting another party. My husband was getting us a drink at the bar ( which was basically right behind that table) & when he saw us right behind him being seated -he told the hostess that two others parties before us declined that table & were seated elsewhere, she said AGAIN that was the ONLY table available, so we were \"stuck with it\"! Soon after a couple (2) was seated in that booth. This table we were given, we decided that we all had to sit to the inside ( nearest the bar area) so that the high traffic flow wouldn't hit, bump or spill anything on us walking by the table.
Our waitress was great ( so it kinda made up for things). Michele was our server. She was attentive, sweet & went out of her way to be accommodating / especially to our daughter. When we had ordered our girls Shirley Temple @ the bar it came with zero cherries. Asked Michele if she could add cherries to the next one and she brought extra to make up for the \"first go round\". Come dessert time Michele made sure our child got her ice cream after she ate her kids meal. BTW-The Chicken Teriyaki is a great kids meal they offer. 
Beers on tap- tried the Dogfish Pumpkin Ale: it's okay. House Honey Blonde is tasty! Hubby's favorite: Hoegaarden White.
Wings yum!
Clam Chowder is always good! 
Tried the Pork Belly Bahn Mi & instead of the bun I asked for it with lettuce to make them a \"lettuce wrap\" ( no carbs) which they did. It also was suppose to have a side of slaw, which came on the side in a small white ceramic cup. It was just \"raw veggies\"  & it came with a side of very plain mayonnaise (?). The meal was average, but for the price of $13.45 & only receiving four thin strips of meat with all kind of veggies it was a little pricey!
Classic Cheeseburger with a fried egg: Gooey, Goodness. *Add Garlic Fries to top it off!
Although our service was good: couldn't deal with our seating situation: way to much traffic, patrons & staff coming by our table constantly & or having to touch the empty chairs, move them to get by, passing over the area with bar trays, meals etc. that's why only three stars!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here yesterday @ Noon. No wait & we were seated right away!
Our server was Christian. He was great. Attentive, professional & accommodated our party extremely well.
We were a group of 6 and were sat by the pleasant hostess in a long extended booth that satisfied us all very comfortably. 
One of our guests ordered the Asada Street tacos & tried the new Vampire Taco- really good! Their Street Taco's are a \"very popular menu item\" & with many different offerings in flavors: \" that you are bound to try one you'll really like\"!
I had their lunch special for $9.95. Got the Margarita Pizza which was kinda average in flavor cause I believe they used canned stewed tomatoes instead of fresh, which I didn't really care for! This came with a side salad, it was ok. It had the dressing mixed into it & veggies were chopped up, so it more reminded me of a slaw than a salad. Blue cheese dressing was very good though.
Hubby had the BBQ burger with a fried egg on top! Garlic fries are always tasty! Our daughter had the kids meal chicken teriyaki & french fries. One of her favorites. It comes with a side of sauce to dip your chicken chunks in and the fries are always crisp & delicious!  
Great experience over all."}
{"text":"Outstanding experience for my sons 21st Birthday!

Lyndsay was our server along with an assistant.
They were on top of everything. Incredible service!

3 orders of wings for a party of 12. Korean, Firecracker & Buffalo.  All excellent!

EVERY burger ordered was cooked to perfection just the way they were requested. Kudos to the cooks! The Lamb Burger & Truffle Fries are a \"MUST Have here\"! 

Fantastic selection of beers, over 130 Taps! Lots of mix drinks options too!

Vegetarian dishes are offered along with over 100 meal choices makes it suitable for large parties or as intimate for two!

This location has treated us great every time we've dined here.  They are trained well! 

I want to thank the entire staff \"again\" for making my sons Birthday so memorable!

See you soon:)"}
{"text":"We stopped here over the weekend.. Nothing fancy just a quick bite for lunch.
I ordered a med-well burger and it came out blood red. Not a big deal - send it back and get a new one right?  Mind you - I had cut into my burger before I noticed how rare it was... When the \"new\" burger came out I noticed it was the same exact burger as before (remember I had cut it) needless to say it was disgusting. And what a classless act on their end. Who takes the same burger, throws it back on the grill and then serves that to the customer?  As a result, I will never go back to this location.   Honestly Burger King has more class.."}
{"text":"I have been going to this particular Yardhouse for almost 2 years and have always been satisfied.  I recently went there with my mother in law and everything was great.  I wanted to surprise my future wife with her favorite soup for when she got off of work at midnight.  I asked for a cup of clam chowder.  A few minutes later the waiter brought over a paper bag and said it was in there and ready to go. I got home and realized it was only a couple of spoon fulls. I was shocked.   In the future  they should take it out of the bag and show you.  I also realized,  I need to take a look as well."}
{"text":"The Gardien Menu is the best!!! I love the sliders with no cheese and no special sauce.  I also love the boneless wings, garlic & shitake noodles with no chesse, margarita pizza with no cheese.... I just love the whole Gardein Menu...especially during happy hour!!  Great for vegetarians and vegans :)"}
{"text":"One word... Yummy! There's something for everyone on the menu! The portions are very generous, and you'll never leave hungry! The wait staff is out of this world anytime of day! From appetizer to dessert, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I remember coming to this place about 4 years ago and was at the time satisfied with my dinner. Since then I have become a vegetarian and am always looking for places to eat. Well this will be in my top 10 in the southwest region. They have a whole section that is devoted to vegans and vegetarians.  They even have a nice selection of beer on tap. This will be visited often."}
{"text":"Always enjoy being here, Bri is always nice and polite she review the order with you to make sure it's all good as well as checking on you every a few min to make sure everything is the way it supposed to be. 
Good job to y'all"}
{"text":"Yelp most definitely doesn't have this place pinned on the map correctly. But!
This is a yardhouse review, so here it goes..
Whether you're craving something completely different than what your date is craving, when you choose yardhouse, she/he won't get upset at you for secretly choosing something you're craving for over what they want. 
Ambience is cool. 
Tons of beers on tap. 
Food is an upscale version of bar food. 
And it's good most of the time!
ProTip: add ice cream to the s'mores brownie. 
You're welcome"}
{"text":"A recent visit to celebrate a friend's birthday, Yard House left me feeling disappointed.  We had a large party, about 14 people at the table.  During our visit, we even had a shift change, where our original waitress was kind enough to let us know she was leaving and who was taking over.  

Although the rest of our table had appetizers, The Husband and I arrived in time for entrees:

* New York Steak Salad \"green beans, roasted peppers, avocado, crispy potatoes, red onion and baby lettuce tossed in a gorgonzola vinaigrette with beefsteak tomatoes and pickled egg\" ($16.95) - A generous and flavorful salad, loaded with the ingredients listed and a tasty steak.

* Cuban Roast Pork Dip \"tomatoes, pepper jack cheese, pickles, dijon and garlic aioli on french bread grilled with bbq au jus\" ($12.65) - This was The Husband's order and I had a bite.  It wasn't that great, especially when I recall my previous experience with a Cuban sandwich.  The fries were good though.

My concern was more with service.  The waiter asked the birthday girl what kind of dessert she wanted (out of three choices), and she went for the Chocolate Souffle Cake \"mini serving with vanilla ice cream, served warm\".  When it arrived, there was no candle which surprised us all.  (How are you supposed to sing happy birthday without a candle to blow?)  And he only gave us one spoon, which reminded me that he never brought back dessert menus for the rest of us.  At this point, we didn't bother ordering dessert since the birthday girl already had hers.  That part made the experience disappointing.

The other waiter was able to do a split tender on the check, which was helpful.  (Although he put the costs wrong on my receipt, oh well.)  I usually think Yard House is on top of things, but I guess they weren't that night."}
{"text":"We used to go to this location all the time used to have great service and good food. Couple of years ago was so so. Hadn't gone back in awhile. But family came to town and wanted to go. Service was good but food was not good, husband had a hamburger that came raw had to send it back. Sister had California rolls that were stacked like a cake not really a roll and had cherry tomatoes strange. Managment did take off the price of the bad meals. We won't be back plenty of other good restaurants to go to."}
{"text":"We visited again today (we usually come about every 2 weeks). This visit was very poor. Our server Andrew minimally checked on us and was not friendly. The girl he was training, Raven, was actually very nice. We will be back but we hope we never get Andrew again!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this Yardhouse! Everything I order is always amazing. This time I enjoyed the hummus. I love that they serve half yard beers!! I got this blueberry beer that was simply delicious. I love the music and laid back atmosphere. The servers and hosts are always so helpful and nice. I will always be a return customer!"}
{"text":"Super over-priced menu. The food and drink selection is ok. The atmosphere is dark and moody. They have a couple TVs but depending on where they seat your group you may not be able to view the sports you wanted to watch. I came in on a Sunday during football season and the TVs in my area were showing hockey and golf... no football!?!?"}
{"text":"Nice big restaurant. Although I like smaller restaurants a bit better. But the food is great. And the service super friendly & young & handsome:) The portions are huge. So 2 people of us shared and we were both full. We had the turkey potpie which was very yummy. The Blue Crab Cake Hoagie was very delicious too. I would come again."}
{"text":"This is part of a chain network, belonging to Darden (same company who owns Olive Garden)

Service was very good, with a huge draft beer selection.

Food was also good."}
{"text":"Everyone loves Yard House. If you don't then you're probably always sober or constantly DIE-ting while joining with a friend to catch up during happy hour. 

Both the beer and food selection is great. I always find myself trying out a new beer and appetizer/entree every time I drop a visit. And for a franchised restaurant? It's pretty darn good. Their take on classic bar food exceeds expectations with a touch of quality for the price that you're paying.

The ambiance is great too. The energy's always there making it effortless to have a great time regardless of what the occasion might be. Everyone's in a great mood eating good food drinking good booze while socializing like there's no tomorrow.

Knocked off a star since the times I do grab a table, I realized that I would much rather sit at the bar after receiving slow service- but I do understand how chaotic this place could get. Aside from that, I still love you Yard House. Always and forever."}
{"text":"Great food. .. Great atmosphere... GreatMusic. .. And Most important Great service from Candice"}
{"text":"I came here to have a quiet dinner on my birthday. It was already a very sad day. As soon as my dinner came, a drunk man \"Ray\" came into my space and proceeded to tell me how I would look if Picasso had  painted me, the entire time I was eating! As soon as I finished, he waved at the bartender who said, \"thanks Ray!\" Then he looked at me and said, \"I bet you just wanted a nice quiet dinner.\" At this point I was in tears. I am back tonight to see if my experience can be better. So far, so good. One bartender does not a an entire wait-staff make."}
{"text":"First, let me say I congratulate on your selection of beer selection. Nicely done. And the music. again, most excellent. Great atmosphere, comfortable patio seating round out the experience. The staff are friendly and accommodating. Now the reason for 2 stars. The food. Its like they've given up. I tried 3 times and was disappointed each time."}
{"text":"Solid food and service. The beer list is obviously first rate. We ordered the onion rings as an app which were great, so were the dipping sauces. My DogFishHead 90 minute IPA washed them down perfectly . I had the short ribs for my main course which was very good. My wife and I usually share entrees and tonight was no different. I didn't enjoy the Lobster Garlic noodles. The lobster was a bit bland and the sauce didn't compliment the lobster well. Some spice and perhaps a stronger Samball or Sichuan kick would have been nice. 

The patio was very comfortable and we got to watch the NFL draft too which was nice. We always come here when catching a movie. Parking is never too tough here too which is nice."}
{"text":"I ordered the clam chowder & YUUUMMMM. Michelle our waitress was prompt and friendly too! Great experience."}
{"text":"I love Yardhouse! And especially love this one in the Linq district! They have the yummiest dessert if it's your birthday  (which it is mine) try a bottle of the rose"}
{"text":"Street  tacos and truffle fries... amazing. Plus pineapple  cider yes please! Sit at the bar to avoid long wait times, the bar tenders are fun and funny!"}
{"text":"We came to the Yard House after a church function and they save a tale of 13 people pretty fast, especially since it was a Saturday evening. Took about 25-30 minutes but we were all together as a family, so we took that time to catch up.

Service was good at first, once we got the food, service slowed down, greatly.

The poke nachos are out of this world, so many flavors and textures and I highly recommend ordering this.

My wife and I ordered the chicken penne and it was bland, no flavor, we sent it back and still got charged for it, VERY disappointing. We ordered dessert and it took WAY longer that we expected.

The reason why I'm giving it 2 stars: didn't remove the bland dish off the bill, didn't even ask us if we wanted a different meal to eat with the rest of the family. Lack of customer service once the food was delivered to the table.

It was a party of 13 so a tip obviously was going to be big for a $325 meal.

Server didn't know much about the alcohol/beer either. Shame shame."}
{"text":"I went into this place and have come here several times. I have not been treated so rude in my life and a friend of mine felt the same way. One mistake the tall black dude behind the bar is so mean, hateful and rude towards me every time I go in here and ignores when I am wanting a drink like he has a personality conflict with me and I use to come in here  a lot. Then when I ordered food,  they brought me my food all old, cold, and hard. Dispicable. Middle finger up to this horrible place. I am sick of this place mistreating me by f******* up my food, service, and not staying on top of making sure I have my drink. Didn't even offer me a water.  The black dude and white dude with black glasses were very arrogant, rude, and lied to my friend about what he ordered and told him he couldn't order what he wanted. So he ordered something else and he was not too impressed with his gum tasting ass steak.  The rude short arrogant white dude with black glasses. He definitely is a new face from when I started coming in here when Westgate was first built but this Westgate crap has turned into a war zone waiting to happen with all the police waiting to beat and hurt someone probably. Very uncomfortable environment at night. A bunch of unnecessary mistreatment going on here for sure,  and I am sick of it.  I can't stand Westgate anymore. Don't waste your valueable  money or time here.  Go to Scottsdale, at least you pretty much know what your going to get up there.  Same shit. Same treatment. Better environment of a crowd. No police waiting to beat you down either."}
{"text":"I have been to this location several times and everything has always been great. The menu has great food and one cannot talk about Yard House without mentioning the beer selection.

The only reason I dropped down a notch was because last time I was there with friends for Happy Hour we were at the bar, great service, and then once we moved to the table all service went down the toilet. It took forever to get our drinks and it was so dead with multiple waitress on duty. 

My advice, if your drinking stay at the bar. It's worth spending the time getting a bar stool."}
{"text":"CORPORATE!!!  If you don't mind a cookie cutter stale place with zero personality or charm than the Yardhouse is a good place.  However if you want something with personality and charm go elsewhere. Food is sterotypical california cuisuine.  Lots of beers on tap, a lot of mediocre beers but a few good craft beers to satisfy craft beer junkies like myself. Servers are ok but no very little about the beers."}
{"text":"Had dinner at this resturant last night ,
I guess my standard has changed since I started watching the food Chanel , the service was good but the food was not good , ordered a Caesar salad that was served without dreasing , huge chunks of lettuce, it looked like they were rushed to push this out of kitchen, then a tuna roll that looked more like a pie and supper salty and spicy.
I will not go back there but the place was very busy and crowded."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! We always love taking visitors from somewhere else to The Yard House at West Gate in Glendale.Lots of energy with great seating inside and outside. 

Food menu's breadth and depth equal's Cheesecake Factory! 140 beers on Tap. Are you f...... kidding me!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, long wait times. Nothing on the order was delivered correctly. I will never go here again."}
{"text":"The yard house is a a great place to eat and drink. Lots of good beers to choose from and a good American / bar type food menu. The location in Vegas was legit. Food was good. I had the Jumbalaya and it was really good.  Definitely worth it. Its in my list as a great go to spot for good food."}
{"text":"Love the beer selection. I like to use try the flight so I can try it all. Will always recommend  this place to anyone. Food is also great but I like to try their beer."}
{"text":"Greeted as we came in, very polite hostess! Was told 45 minute wait, no biggie, it was Friday night! Waited 15! Perfect! 
Sat in the side room on the left, it was dark! Finally they opened up the shades to see outside, it was nice and much brighter! 
Ordered food, got the BBQ Chicken pizza, spot on! Ranch salad was awesome! 
Only was here one other time for lunch but this out beat that time! Only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is you see a lot of servers look miserable! No smiles at all! Very different from the hostess stand girls! A smile on a face goes a long way! With all the hatred recently in the country, at least we had a server that was friendly, happy and had a smile always!"}
{"text":"When I found out that this place was a chain I was even more impressed. This place has the largest amount of beers on tap I have ever seen. They even had a northern California Belgian that I love called Brother Thelonius on tap, which I thought was unheard of.

I had the Tuna Poke for an app, basically it was tuna tartare, came mixed with avocado, it was very good. I also ordered the Surf and Turf Burger. The lobster/burger combo was fantastic, it may not be the best burger I've ever had in my life but I would say it gets an honorable mention. I ordered mine with sweet potato fries that came with a maple bacon sauce, can't go wrong there. I also had a bite of the Garlic Chicken Noodles, it was also great."}
{"text":"Although Yard House is known for its variety of beers, their food is not to be overlooked. 

Spinach Cheese Dip ($11.85) - Feta, Jack, Parmesan, Cream Cheese, Crispy Flatbread (This dish is Vegetarian) 
This dish came out hot and ready, it was not too cheesy and the portions were equal from flat bread to dip. 

Ahi Crunchy (starting at $11.95) - Seared Rare, field greens, Asian slaw, crispy wontons, soy vinaigrette. (Under 600 calories) 
This dish is my mothers favorite because the ahi is seared perfectly and seasoned just right. The vinaigrette is not too over powering and blends very well with the freshness of the fish. 

Miso Glazed Sea Bass ($29.65) - Bok Choy, carrots, edamame, jasmine or brown rice
Best dish in the house by far!! If you're a fan of seafood, this is prepared to perfection! Though the glaze was a bit overwhelming, we will be sure to get the glaze on the side next time.

Lobster Garlic Noodles ($22.85) - Shrimp, Crab, Lobster, shiitake mushrooms, spinach, parmesan. 
Only a few pieces of lobster with some shredded crab and whole shrimp, this dish was very delicious. I had wished the noodles were a little more powerful in the garlic flavor, but that is just my personal option. 

Mini Crème Brûlée ($4.85) - Vanilla bean custard, chocolate, caramelizes bananas. 
Presentation caught my eyes first and you know what they say, you eat with your eyes first. After indulging in this dessert, I found happy surprises of chocolate chips at the bottom of the ramekin. Delicious! 

Also! Thank you to our waiter Gary for providing us excellent service, he had made our dining experience all the more enjoyable."}
{"text":"Came here before a concert, great place to hydrate and eat.  They have over 50 beers on tap and their cocktails are amazing. The restaurant is a place for fun. You're right next to the High Roller. The best seats are on the patio upstairs. You're surrounded by locals and tourists enjoying a night out on the town. You can hear loud music being played directly in front of the restaurant and I haven't heard a bad performer yet. The restaurant does tend to be loud however this matches the atmosphere of the restaurant. 

On this visit I was at the bar and I was served by Kelsee T, who was on it!  The wait staff have always been pleasant and helpful. The menu is long and broad: from jambalaya to pizza you'll never leave hungry. The menu is so long that it does take quite some time to decide. The portions are huge. The food isn't amazing, but it's good, I had the Ahi Poke Nachos (B), and the Boneless Buffalo Wings (B).  However, the beer selection is amazing.  Cheers."}

This was our first time coming to this location and we had great service. Candle was our server and she was fantastic! They're food and drinks are great reasonable prices and they have a huge beer and wine selection. Great spot for family or just friends... if you haven't been you gotta check them out!"}
{"text":"Would have been a 5 but there doesn't seem to be a place without a draft in the whole bldg. 
 The food was really good, right temps, atmosphere perfect for catching up with two friends.
 Our server checked on us regularly, even got me a soda to go when he found it was first soda in 8 months! Lol
 Try the Garlic Lobster Noodles."}
{"text":"Great service. Good beer. Good food and apps. What more could you ask for. It's so fun to people watch here on the weekends as a local. You get a lot of large girl group parties , prom type outfits, slut wear, and casual people mix. I could drink, eat and watch people here all day... Maybe I'll even apply for a job :)"}
{"text":"- Nice location (just a touch off the Strip so you avoid the insanity)
- Spacious
- Not too noisy
- Friendly service
- Ok food (tacos, guac and chips), except for the deviled eggs, which are delicious!"}
{"text":"Horrible Horrible Service..
Asked for a table on the patio (counted 6 open on the way out).
They told us it would be a few minutes, that's fine but then they just forgot about us and sat two other parties on the patio while we waited. Then when I asked about our table. The brat at the hostess stand said they didn't have a table yet.
We finally ended up just leaving and again on the way out there was plenty of outside seating.
They have no organization at the front which would say it's as bad or worse in the back.
Will not go back"}
{"text":"Yard House is always a great place to eat. Yard House was the first restaurant I ate in in Vegas and I loved it. I literally couldn't tell you how many times I've eaten here since.

The vibe is awesome. Good music. Great seating. It also has an outdoor patio with TVs. 

The service is usually good and food for the most part gets out in a timely manner. 

I've gotten several things to eat here and it's all been great. 

Happy Hour is week nights 3pm - 6pm.

Great hang!"}
{"text":"I went here as there were many choices for my vegetarian husband.  He got the veggie burgerburger which he said was interesting and he liked it. I got the spicy tuna roll and a Baja taco. I was concerned about the spicy tuna roll not being enough for a full meal however it would've been plenty. It was beautiful to the eyes but could have been more flavorful. The Baja taco was good. My greatest disappointment of the meal was my margarita. At a cost of $10 plus it was mostly ice with a little bit of margarita. Not worth the 10 bucks as there really was nothing special about it and it was gone after I took three drinks . I do give high marks on the service . It was a busy night. We were told a 10 minute wait but it was more five.  Very friendly staff  and the food came out quickly."}
{"text":"Went to @YardHouse tonight, after seeing Robin Hood.

Had a Chimay for the first time. Not really impressed.

Ordered the bearnaise sliders.

WTF is up with that bearnaise? Not a traditional bearnaise. Not bad, but not great.

Fries were good.

Music was a bit loud; had to almost yell to be heard two barstools away.

Been there before. Will probably go back again, since they do have a nice selection of beers and ales."}
{"text":"Welcome break from the Vegas hustle and bustle.  Tomato bisque was fantastic!  140+ different beers available.  Accommodating to special food requests and the meal had excellent flavors.  Would make time to return!!"}
{"text":"This is a hard review for me to write. I even have taken a couple days to write this. First off I love this place. It's actually good solid food and beer. Also 8/10 you have OUTSTANDING service. Tho this was not the case the other day. For the most part. 

We came in and got sat with Seth. Food was awesome. Except the Thai Chicken Pizza. It was so soggy that when you picked up a slice everything would fall off. Now I would say toppings but no. EVERYTHING. That is where my only issue was until.

So Seth was busy yes. Though the other three tables around me, he stopped and had a full on conversation. My partner and I, were taking our niece out, and wanted to show her a restaurant that is more than your basic Chili's. I got a gift card from a family member, so why not use the opportunity. Teach her real table manners while you eat out. Now I literally sank in my seat with what happened next.

The Pizza was either under cooked, or they put too much sauce all over it. What ever the case, after flagging down Seth, and just asked for the pizza to be taken off. As I didn't want a new on at that point as everything else was eaten. 

I asked Seth if he could split the check and CHARGE me for the Onion Rings. My exact statement was. Can you split the check and put the Onion Rings on one check so I can pay with a Debit card, and be able to tip you. You can't tip off a Gift Card. 

He literally stoped and looked at me and was like \"Yeah, I mean you better tip me.\"



No. No way. So we still just continued to pay, and I went up to ask for a manager. After waiting and speaking to a manager she did reverse all the charges, and asked to come back again. I did return and had a much better experience at Red Rock. I have a review there too... I recommend staying away from this location, as other reviews state, they have problems with regulars. Though they don't realize they could have a regular also if they wanted to treat everyone like that."}
{"text":"For a semi chain this place has pretty good food.  The Mac and Cheese Squared dish is really flavorful and delicious.  
However, some of their other food doesn't quite live up to that standard.  Burgers are ok, but not great.  Sandwiches are ok, but not great.  
All in all though it's a fun place to hang out and drink beers and eat decent food.  Kind of heavy on the douchebags on Fri and Sat nights but honestly that goes for most of Town Square.  What's with that?"}
{"text":"Great location at the linq, from our booth your could see the high roller spinning. Came here on a Friday night after 9, the wait wasn't too long for the two of us, about 10-15 minutes. 

Ordered sweet potatoes fries, pan seared ahi for me, fish and chips for the bf, and a piece of macadamia nuts cheesecake to share. The sweet potatoes fries came with a side of maple bacon dip, it was delicious and the perfect condiment to the fries. I didn't know how the tuna would turn out, since yard house isn't known for its seafood, but it was amazing! Came with a side of asparagus and brown rice, the only thing that could have been improved was that the sauce was a bit too salty for my liking. 

And the entire time it was entertaining for us because our server kept looking at him funny, batting his eyes, like he was trying to hit on him. It was hilarious."}
{"text":"Always delicious. The staff is super nice and super helpful. I am vegan, and I know a lot of the staff is knowledgable about their vegan menu. I have taken my friends just to make them try the vegan burger!"}
{"text":"Ate here for dinner. Great service and ambiance. The ahi tuna burger was kind of dry though. Deviled eggs were great. Lots of selections for everyone."}
{"text":"NOT the best place for vegans despite their Gardein products."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday because this is one of the few locations outside the strip that can accommodate a party of twenty. Service was good and they sat us at the table immediately. We made a reservation beforehand. 

We ordered a bunch of stuff so I got to try a little bit of everything. The sweet and sour \"chicken\" off the vegetarian menu was so good!  It's made out of soy but it's crunchy sweet and sticky. I also enjoyed the texture. I got to try the truffle burger and garlic fries. Liked it both. It was good, nothing really special but definitely a solid burger. The fries are cut thin and they were generous with the garlic. I got the angel hair pasta with all kinds of vegetables and olives in the half size. Portion is a little small but I wasn't that hungry so it worked out. I enjoyed it but it wasn't my favorite dish. I kept eyeing other people's food. I think there's too many olives in it.  I also liked their Korean steak dish with rice. It came with sautéed spinach that were delicious. 

Since it was a birthday they were nice enough to give the birthday girl a free dessert. Ice cream and a brownie. They also split the check for 20 people. That's amazing!  Love it when places can do that so you don't have to worry about calculating it and splitting the tips and tax. Saved us the headache!  Will definitely come back for their happy hour."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a number of times and never fail to enjoy myself. The service is always terrific and the food is tasty. You MUST have a California Roll which is very non-traditional with the same combination of flavors. The lettuce wraps with chicken are another favorite, and today I discovered the Wisconsin Cheese Curds which I cannot say enough good things about. Give this place a try on your next visit to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Dined in on 1/11/16 around 11:45pm. The kitchen closes at 12:30am and we barely made it and was starving. We got a very friendly server of Asian decent (i forgot his name) he was quick to get us drinks and was so nice! We started with jerk chicken wings around $10.00 and got lots of big wings with yummy jerk seasoning and side of jerk bbq sauce and it was amazing. For entree, I got the porcini crusted halibut that comes with Parmesan mashed potatoes and porcini cream sauce with white truffle oil with asparagus and bok Choy. The fish was melt in your mouth delicious. It was so tender but firm and seasoned perfectly. The mashed potatoes accompanied the fish great, so did the asparagus. The bok Choy was ok but I'm not really a huge fan of bok Choy in the first place. It was around $25 and very worth it considering the quality of the food. The portions are pretty on point even though it was sooooo good I wanted it more lol. Boyfriend got the two tacos (you can mix and match two taco combo at a fixed price) he chose the Korean bbq short rib taco and jerk swordfish taco and it came with Mexican rice and refried beans. He loved the Korean bbq taco and the rice. The tacos were pretty small which was the only con through the mean and He didn't really like the fish tacos because it was too bitter and too strong flavored. Overall, it was a great experience and will be back again. I also love how variety the menu is. Everyone can find something they will like at a great price. I love how you can get $10 burgers to $40 steak. Drinks looked great too."}
{"text":"We came here on a Wednesday for the farewell dinner of a friend. We were 12 people in total and got a nice round table to sit in a corner near the kitchen. It did take a while for us to get seated as the table wasn't ready on time but that is not really a big deal.
From beginning to the end, the service was great,. Our server ,April, was extremely helpful when it came to queries about the food or the drinks on their menu. The service was fast. I did get my 1st drink wrong though, maybe because the noise inside the place made it difficult for the server to get the correct name. 
They have an amazing and vast collection of drinks on their menu. Every guest got 2 samples to try before ordering anything. I tried a couple of their in house beers on tap and they were nice and crisp. Most of the other people went for their tried and tested favorites. 
The food menu was elaborate too. We ordered 2 chicken nachos and the portions were huge. The vegetarian folks got the same thing without chicken. We also ordered onion rings, fried mac and cheese, a couple of types of chicken wings and everything met the expectations. 
A friend then developed a craving for some chocolate based cocktail and we got chocolate martini for everyone and that was tasty :) 
The ambiance of this place is loud and they have a lot of screens playing different matches. 
It is a nice place to hang out with a bunch of friends.. 
Cheers."}
{"text":"The staff are really nice here, the service is prompt, and the booths are roomy and clean, but I wouldn't especially want to come back. While the menu is gargantuan, there was very little that sounded appealing. It took me a long time to figure out what to order because everything sounded so oily. Not what I want, only a few hours after getting off a plane. However, it was highly recommended by a hotel employee, so I thought it'd be worth a try.

Finally I decided on the margherita pizza. It was terribly salty and not much else. However, the creme brulee was really good. Good thing it was shared with two other people because it was very rich! 

Can't vouch for the alcohol offerings, but as far as food goes, it was overpriced and trying too hard to be fancy/trendy. So glad our friend's expense account was covering it because I couldn't feel good about throwing that kind of money at mediocre food. 

The big smiles beaming from the workers were big perks, though. Seemed that they all really liked their jobs and the customers!"}
{"text":"We were in town for a Taylor Swift concert and the University if Phoenix Stadium is within walking distance from here so we decided to have a early dinner(got there at 3:30) Their was a good 10 people ahead of us to be put on a wait list. They had a packed house. It seems we happen to pick the Cool Place to go pre concert. Anyways the services was great. I seriously expected the worse because of how many people were their. Our food was served hot and really good. This was mine and my girls first time here and appetizers happened to be half off. (We came during happy hour) so we took advantage of that order their chicken fingers their onion rings stack and their mozzarella cheese bites. All really really good. I have to say that I would really recommend this place. Can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"They have the best happy hour in town! Huge variety of food. So many to choose from. Everything was so good but my favorite one was chicken garlic noodles. It's a Bomb!! Happy hour menu is very cheap too! Keep up with good work guys!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant at Westgate and it makes me reluctant to try other places--the food is good and reliable (I just know never to come here before a Coyotes game because of the crowds). My son is autistic and an extremely picky eater; he'll only eat tortilla chips in restaurants. Yard House offers good chips and is always willing to serve the toppings on the side. That's greatly appreciated.

I love their ahi crunchy salad and I've had several of their flatbreads, too. I like that they have the nutrition information online. It makes it easy for me to choose foods that are healthy and yet still an indulgence!

I recently took my parents and brother here while they were on a visit.  My brother raved about the (Mac + Cheese)2, and he's pretty difficult to please with food. My Mom enjoyed her roasted turkey cobb salad. My dad had a cheeseburger and liked it, though the fries were thin for his preference. Can't please everyone!

When my husband is able to come along, he loves Yard House for their beer selection, too. I've had cocktails here in the past and enjoyed them."}
{"text":"Watching basketball game at bar.  Didn't drink but service was great anyways.  They refilled my ice tea without asking. Had the pasta and chicken plate. Was ok. Bland.  Got the \"dinner size\". Wow. Not sure how much smaller the lunch size option was. Otherwise not a bad place."}
{"text":"Great beer, good food, and one of the best places to go before a Coyotes game. The vampire tacos, and the house honey blonde are maybe the greatest things the baby Jesus has ever invented. Get there early before games because this place gets full as a mofo."}
{"text":"Wanted to go with something light for lunch so we went over to the yard house.  We split a salad (I thought it was the chopped salad).  Good service and food came out reasonably quick.  My only beef is with the layout of the Town Square.  It is incredibly hard to find places in this area unless you already know where they are.  We drove past the Yard House twice because the main entrance is not on one of the streets.  And when it is 105 degrees out, you really don't want to wander around on foot."}
{"text":"Great service, nice food, we are using happy hour on Sunday, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a place with reasonable prices, varied menu and kid friendly.  The Yard House ticked all those boxes.
The Pros: friendly staff, not a super long wait, menu for everyone, yes even a kids menu (rare on the strip)
The 9 year old had the hamburger and fries..he cleaned up the plate. The 32 year old had salad and Mac and cheese which she said \"was to die for\"...it was creamy and had truffle oil? She loved it. We old folks...well he had the pepper crusted filet and salad. He was very content..he didn't rave but he said was flavorful. It came with masked potatoes, asparagus and a house gravy that was good. He wasn't blown away but felt he got his money's worth. I had the southern fried chicken breast..it came with mash potatoes, BBQ beans, cream corn and gravy. Mine was off the chain. Delicious.
Apparently they have an enormous beer menu..we did not partake but daughter says it was impressive list.
The only real cons: LOUD..not just the music it's the clanging of dishes, scooting chairs...TVs it was not a place to try and have a conversation. Lol
Service was a wee slow but seems that was a common theme in Vegas this particular week.
I Highly recommend this restaurant for the food and it does have a lively atmosphere and a great view of the Linq and High Roller.
It's a short walk down the Linq from Las Vegas Blvd."}
{"text":"Did you know this Yard House location has 38 TVs? THIRTY-EIGHT!!!!! There isn't a table / booth in here that doesn't have a up-front-&-personal view of live coverage of the latest events. THIRTY-EIGHT!  

Friends and I stopped in for Happy Hour a few days ago before a flick and felt cool, cozy, well fed and well educated (we watched a segment of the Spelling Bee) on the two TVs that were practically on our table. 

Happy Hour food was good and servings were generous. Next time I am looking for a place to see my favorite teams play, I will look no further than Yard House - Scottsdale. I know there isn't a bad seat in the house . . ."}
{"text":"Yard house is my favorite restaurant, their vegetarian menu (gardein) is incredible. I got mad the first time I ate it because I thought it was meat. I eat here almost weekly and recommend anything on the menu. They have a huge beer selection and the service is great."}
{"text":"We had a party of 18 celebrating birthdays at the Yardhouse on a Friday evening, we had a little bit of a wait due to them not accepting reservations but it was well worth it.  The service was the best we have had in Vegas, thanks Tim and the food was awesome!   We will definitely be return customers."}
{"text":"Terrible Service all the way around.  

While dining there a few weeks ago I was completely shocked at how bad the service was. At first they messed up our drink orders.. we shrugged it off.. no big deal.. Then they bring half the table their food and just never came back with the other half. After having to get up to find a manager we still had to wait 15-20 minutes for it. Then they bring out the completely wrong food.. So we send it back.. then another 20 minutes goes by and the first half of the table is done and ready to go.. Then finally they bring out the food. Two of which items were burgers that were ordered medium rare and came out burnt.. To make matters worse the server never came back for drink refills and we eventually had to find someone to do that for us as well. It was embarrassing especially since I made the recommendation to go there (having been there only one time before just to drink)  Just about everyone at the table who was a first timer said they would never be back, and I dont blame them."}
{"text":"I had heard good things about Yard House and considering it was always full we figured this must be a fantastic place to eat. Unfortunately I cannot agree with this. We waited and sat outside. We have our kids and it was a beautiful night so we figured why not? It is also fairly loud inside, so outside was best for the kids. The tables inside and out are extremely close together and I felt like the ladies sitting next to our table should have just joined us because we heard everything they said (or they could have just been being really loud, but we were very close). The service was only okay we had to practically grab our server's arm just to get refills. The food was pretty good, but the selection of items were not fantastic. Not to mention I felt the pricing was much more than similar restaurants. While the food was good we probably won't be back because there are other places just as good with much better pricing."}
{"text":"I was here a couple of weeks ago for a staff dinner.  The place is a lot bigger on the inside than it appears on the outside.  Also, we were there on a Tuesday night yet it seemed really busy in the main dining area.  Our private dining area was ready to go by the time I arrived (I was the first to arrive).  A server immediately came up to me and asked for me drink order.  We had about 18 people in our group with 2 servers attending to us.  I have no complaints whatsoever.  The servers seemed really organized and hospitable.  Our appetizers and main dishes came out in a timely manner.  They kept our glasses full and seemed really patient with all the questions we had about things on the menu.  I liked that they had a little bit of everything on their menu from beef to chicken to pasta to seafood.  I think the prices were a tad pricey but not by much.  I had a coconut shrimp appetizer which was a little heavy on the coconut but still tasty and sweet potato fries.  Everyone else seemed happy with what they ordered as well.  I really appreciate that our meals all came out in a timely fashion. It was a good atmosphere, I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love the Yard house! This was the first I ever went to and I nearly fell off my chair when I saw there was an entire vegan section! Vegans and carnivores now have a meeting place, where all the goods are equally good - the food, the beer, the drinks, the ambiance - I am a die-hard fan for life. Great place for any occasion."}
{"text":"Glad we happened upon this place. We were looking for a burger and couldn't have chosen better.  We had the Black Truffle Cheeseburger and the Lamb burger, truffle fries, onion rings and beers. The burgers were cooked to order and delicious. They also have a huge draft beer selection. I will definitely return on our next trip."}
{"text":"After a short hike this morning at Calico Tanks, my friends and I decided to come to Yard House in Red Rock for lunch.  I've been to the Yard House in Town square, so I know what kinds of food options they have.  I typically visit the Yard House for their happy hour specials, so this lunch was going to be kind of a new experience.  

One thing I've noticed about this location is that it's much bigger than the Town square location.  It was super busy, yet we got sat super fast which was a plus.  Our server was super attentive and really tried her best to engage with our party.  I really liked her personality, I wish I had remembered her name, though.  Blonde hair, maybe Breanne.  She was super awesome, whoever she was.

For lunch, I started with the Cupcake Sauvignon Blanc for $8.00.  As stated on the menu, it's from the Marlborough, New Zealand region.  I just started drinking Sauvignon Blanc recently and I thought this glass was a little to dry for my taste.  I probably should have just stuck to the Pinot Grigio I was thinking of getting.  Ecco Domani Pinot Grigio is usually a great glass, but that's what I get for trying something new. 

For my entree, I got the half sandwich and cup of soup lunch special for a little less than $10.  I also added a bowl of shoe string french fries for an extra $1.80.  The half sandwich I chose was the grilled pastrami sandwich on a toasted sub bun.  The pastrami was a little tangy and was accompanied with mayo.  The bottom of the sandwich was lined with jalapenos.  Not spicy at all, I think they may have been grilled.  This sandwich was great!  As for the soup, I decided to get the clam chowder.  The day was a little brisk so I thought it was a good decision.  I didn't necessarily think the soup was the best clam chowder I've ever had.  Seemed process for some reason, maybe it was the ingredients that made it taste that way.  This soup was garnished with chopped chives.  

The experience was great at the end of the day.  I wouldn't mind returning for another round after another morning of hiking.  The next time I come, I'm for sure getting the Spicy Tuna Roll on the appetizer menu.  I think it was for about $13.  My friend go this and it was sooooo good!  Seared Ahi, avocado, edamame, cucumber with a soy sauce and looked like a little sriracha.  I had the amazing opportunity to try this dish and I fell in love!  If you haven't been to a Yard House, you're missing out.  So many options, so many beers!  Get your butt down and try it out!"}
{"text":"Birthday party on a budget.  Happy Hour half off appetizers and drinks after 10pm, Say What?!

Last night, I joined two of my friends at the Yard House to celebrate one of their birthdays.  I've eaten at the Yard House many o' times  and love the beer choices.  The experience/food is not the worst, but it's not the best.  It's great for happy hour and I'm sticking to that!

For drinks, I just got the Fat Tire pint for about $5.  Although I appreciate the 130+ beer choices, I'm partial to my Fat Tire/Newcastle beers.  For food, we got a few appetizers which were all half off:  First, the  Jamaican Jerk style boneless wings.  Came with a sweet hoisin type dipping sauce. The chicken was tender and the batter was delightful.  Next, we had Moo Shu egg rolls-chicken, chili cream cheese, carrots, green onions, cilantro, spinach with apple ginger plum sauce.  The chicken was a little dry but was redeemed with the sweet plum sauce.  Lastly, we got the chicken nachos-spicy pinto beans, cheddar, jack, red & green sauce, tomato, cilantro, onions, guacamole, sour cream.  It's a huge serving, but just your average bar nachos.  The cheese was a little hard.

I did appreciate the great service that night.  The manager came over a few times, because a drunk lady invited herself on our table and then asked for us to pay her bar tab.  She was a little loud but somewhat funny.  Our server was cordial, but not to impressionable.  

The Happy Hour will continue bringing me back to the Yard House.  It isn't busy and we got a table right away.  There's typically a younger crowd which offers a hip vibe in my opinion.  Let's just say that overall, I wouldn't necessarily wait longer than 15 minutes for a table unless you're crazy about beer."}
{"text":"Good place to go before/after movie at Town Square.  Friendly staff, lot's of TV's for watching whatever game is on.  Decent menu, had the fish tacos which were pretty good.

Was taken care of by Juan at the bar, he was really attentive, check-in with us, despite the place being pretty crowded.  

Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Been here twice now and was not disappointed either time! The hummus dip is truly one of the best ive ever had. I also got the French Onion Soup and a Blackened Swordfish taco with no pico de gallo Vampire Style. The French Onion soup is the best ive ever had as well. Nice hearty broth with the crouton on top still fresh and crispy with nicely melted/crisped cheese. Every bit of it was delicious but i did get a bit too much of a spice on the taco since i have a very sensitive tummy, had to make that note for my plain palate peeps! My boyfriend had the Poke Stack and just inhaled it because it was so tasty. The raw marinated fish was very tender and seasoned spot on. Was plated beautifully as well! 

We also had a few special drinks, i really really really enjoyed the Pineapple Express! It was the perfect balance of sweet and tang with the pineapple, combining it with the mint just made it so fresh and light. Made my boyfriend wish he would have ordered my drink, it was so good! He has ordered the Hawaiian Sunset martini and it was good but not my favorite. Had undertones of what reminded me of a fruity vitamin or a gummy worm lol. All in all it was really delicious and worth every penny. We left very happy customers!"}
{"text":"Even though I had a terrible service on my birthday with a reservation back in September, today's experience definitely redeemed that. Our server was Jordan and he was aweeeesomeeeeee!!!!! Our food was amazing I got the shrimp lettuce wraps, surf and turf burger on lettuce and bf got the ahi salad. Everything came out fast and was cooked to perfection. Jordan was very attentive and a plus was we were seated immediately despite how busy it was during lunch time. We also got the dublin mule which was fantastic! I recommend it:)  I will definitely be back for you yard house! My favorite town square restaurant."}
{"text":"Price = Expensive.  I know, I know, it's on the strip and it's in Town Square for crying out loud.  But their beer menu has no prices.  Be wary, regular glasses are $6.  Their Bernase (spelling, I can say it, can't spell it) sliders are awesome but you might want some extra sauce on the side.  French onion soup is okay.  The parmesan sprinkles threw me off, but it was tasty nonetheless.  I had a BBQ bacon burger and it was okay.  Husband had a gorgonzola peppercorn burger...which was lacking in peppercorny flavor.  On tap Anchor Steam is delicious, as well as the on tap Blue Moon."}
{"text":"For anyone who knows or was part of a large group by the bar today, Sunday July 18th that showed up around midnight- part of your party needs to learn some manners. Yeah, you're at a place that is a dining establishment as well in case you didn't notice it isn't a club where standing room is expected. 

There is a long bar with empty seats so there is no need to have a circle like we're at fucking camp bunched around 3 people already sitting at the bar. I am calling out particularly a guy with a  white longsleeved shirt depicting a archangel religious scene holding up a British flag- thank you for invading my boyfriends dining space and making him feel really intruded upon. I glared and made eye contact with you and the girl even to know that you aren't appreciated and it goes unnoticed. One of your party (thank you greyish? shirt guy) pointed  to our table and pointed out that you and your girlfriend in a purple-ish, blue-ish tank were in our space- you didn't listen to your friend proves you guys were class A people, A- hole class that is. A few of your friends did it too, but then when they actually touched the back of my boyfriends chair appologized and moved out (mohawk guy with a white shirt and tie thanks). If it wasn't for my levelheaded boyfriend I would have gone to the middle of the group and told them off to notice that they aren't the only ones here. 

The waitress was okay. I think as a persons dining host, the comfort of your guests is of importance. I learned from hospitality that seeing the party hover so close our table that it's courteous to ask if we are okay sitting there or to ask the people if they would like a table or a place set up for them at the bar to keep them away from diners. We ended up reseating ourselves when it took a while for her to come back for us, far the fuck away from the bar in a different section. We took our drinks and plates of food to a booth with the help of a different waitress. After we move, guess what happens? They spread out a bit more properly to a table and part of the bar...of course it happens only after they irritate people. 

A beer wouldn't make up for it, but it helps my mood. They did not have Goose Island Matilda on tap today which I wanted and I settled for a random pick I haven't seen around Vegas- Petrus Blond which was not balanced with it's malts and underwhelming. Fuck, couldn't even get a decent blind pick beer today.  Our food was good (garlic noodles, turkey sliders, crab cake) , but not good enough to level my mood. 3 is being VERY nice and only because I love YardHouse."}
{"text":"Lets preface how I even ended up here: 

I was having a bad week (I got sick with a stomach virus, sick boyfriend, dog got sick from ingesting cat litter pellets, water heater broke, fought with my mom on her birthday call, neighbors stole my trashcans, my iPhone broke) so the Yelperazzi got together to try to turn things around. It's a real Yelp success story....We came as strangers and discovered friends. I mean I adore a lot of people on Yelp, but I'm particularly lucky to have met Jieun L, Anthony M., Elnino F, and Andy T who cared 
enough to get me out of the house and get me out of my birthday funk.  My BF reads my reviews and he also turned everything around with the small things. Thank you guys and I love you all. 

Beers are here so I have a hard time not liking this chain...with the circumstance above though I was in that kind of mood to almost hate everything because I'm reserved to being \"done with\" today. It's extra kudos to the Yardhouse reliable brews, decent food and our server that I still enjoyed the restaurant. Yeah there are setbacks like any spots but drink selections make me happy so it was a good choice to turn around any bad day. Our server (Mitch) was pretty good in service, had good beer recommendations and he also brought me a happy birthday brownie sundae (yay!). Nachos were pretty good and loaded with stuff. Sweet potato fries maple bacon sauce was delish that I want to pour that on just about every breakfast item. Ceviche spoons were fresh and light. Chicken garlic noodles- good but go for the plain garlic noodles. There was chicken, tofu, mushrooms, edamame, asparagus, chives, garlic, cheese and it's too much at once. Simple is better with garlic noodles.

BF found a favorite beer worth mentioning- Rogue Dry Hopped Red. Smooth with a bit of hops...a good choice to baby step into the IPAs and DIPAs. He liked it much so that we went back 4days later to order this beer again...we never order twice since our goal is to drink down the whole list (past halfway). 

A few drinks and plates in we were laughing so hard that I was snorting. I mean, I like never do that unless I'm really fighting hard to stop laughing. Anthony has awesome one liners. Jieun makes funny beer faces. Elnino is a violent funny drunk. My BF coined some T-shirt worthy terms at the table. Andy is just a G and always for a good time. 

I expected to go home from work, eat lunch and stay home alone until my BF can get off, head to dinner and go sleep and forget about the day even being my birthday. 

Everything is alright when you have good company to make you smile."}
{"text":"FOOD was AH-MAZING! My brother came down to visit his first trip to Vegas and he wanted to go to one of the best restaurants. Needless to say I brought him to this Yard House location because I love it there. Our server was GREAT & very attentive. The manager on duty also stopped by to make sure we were happy with our service & selections. Comfortable atmosphere & excellent vibe! I will definitely be returning & my brother was beyond pleased!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed there amazing Happy Hour yesterday and were impressed by the food, & especially the service. I am a big fan of sitting at the bar and interacting with the bartenders. The two that were working that day, and who gave excellent service, were Sydney & Lisa. We especially liked Sydney. She was cheerful, professional & sweet as pie. Her recommendations were on point and she was extremely personable. Lisa came in later so we didn't interact with her as much, but she was also awesome. Do yourself a favor and come here for Happy Hour, and definitely hang out at the bar. They were first class and a lot fun!!!"}
{"text":"Everything here is MONEY!  As in SO freaking good!!!  I had the burger with blueberry ketchup (last one on the list), and their sweet potato fries with the maple bacon dipping sauce.  If you go, be sure to be seated with Michelle!  She's the best!!!"}
{"text":"I go to the Town Square Yardhouse on a regular basis, so I was really crazy excited when I heard this one was opening up! 

Let me just say that The LINQ is off the hook! It is easily going to become one of the most popular spots in Las Vegas. I can best describe it as a shopping/dining/nightlife area. It's really cool, classy, and unique~!!! 

Yardhouse is definitely in that same area of classiness! I attended the Grand Opening event where they offered people with an invitation free food samples and 2 drink tickets (21+). It is a huge, two-story restaurant with a ton of workers. WOW it was so much fun! The waiters and waitresses were funny, attentive, and really wanted you to taste the entire menu that they had going around. 

My favorite dishes were: the Southern Fried Chicken, Margherita Pizza, Chicken Tinga Tacos, & SUMMER SALAD!! (Best Salad Ever)

My absolute favorite \"girly\" cocktail is the House Tropic. I used both my drink tickets for 2 of those ;) 

At the end, they even served out a banana and chocolate creme brûlée!! It was an amazing night with great service, and I just cannot wait until they really open. Watch out, Vegas! YardHouse is coming out, bigger and BETTER than ever before!!!"}
{"text":"I always go here for a quick bite! I love the Ahi Poke appetizer and the classic sliders. Also, the 21+ drink selection is quite large, me and my friends always try something new every time we visit here in Town Square. 

Also, the restaurant is in a prime location so that if you sit outside, the sun will not be glaring at you :) Our waiters are always helpful, friendly, and talkative--my favorite type of people! 

Yet, even the small dishes are a bit pricey, but it's just...worth it. I suggest that you open up the day with the summer salad! If you love healthy, that salad is to die for ;)"}
{"text":"This is Yard House NOT YARD BIRD....I but the review on the wrong business ... my bad. 

There are tons of seating options-
Booths
Tables
Humongous bar
I think there's an upstairs

We got - 
Lobster dip - it was tasty and creamy but almost had no lobster in it.  It appeared to be served in a large crock but it was barely a quarter inch deep. It was the first time I've ever ordered a dip in a restaurant that had more chips/ bread than dip. 
Salad - I recall the salad being a large and tasty but nothing too memorable. 

With so many options of places to eat in Vegas, I'm not sure that I'd be back unless somebody highly recommends what needs to be ordered on my next visit."}
{"text":"While the Yardhouse is basically a restaurant for adults, it's also really great for families.

I'm a huge fan of the Yardhouse, and even though it's a chain (there are locations all over the west), it has really great food and probably the best on-tap beer selection I've seen in any restaurant.

As for the food, I've tried all kinds of dishes and I've never been disappointed. My favorites are the garlic lobster noodles, the surf and turf burger (a hamburger with asparagus, lobster and a bernaise sauce) and the \"Spicy Tuna Roll\" which may be the best appetizer in this type of restaurant in Las Vegas. It's basically a deconstructed spicy tuna roll that looks like a birthday cake  - with layers of endamame, cucumber, tuna and avocado. It's awesome, and even my kids like snacking on the endamame before the entrees arrive.

The beer selection is immense, and it used to be perfect, but I have to take points off because they recently removed Tetley's (one of my favorite beers). But honestly? Any place that has both obscure Belgian ales AND Pabst Blue Ribbon on draft can't be bad.

As for the kids menu it is what you'd expect, but all the food is just a little better quality than you normally get in a similar restaurant. In fact the mac and cheese is so good (I'm pretty sure there's some truffle oil in there) that your kids might not like it. Though, you'll probably enjoy it the next day for lunch.

I can't vouch for the service in other Yard Houses, but the service in the one in Vegas has always been outstanding. And in the very few instances where we've had a problem, they've taken money off the bill and rectified the situation immediately.

I can't say enough good things about this restaurant, and if you find yourself shopping in Town Square and need a quick place for lunch, it's really the best."}
{"text":"The menu has a great variety of food but the food is very average. My family loves the Mac and cheese and the beer selections. If you're a tourist it's a great place to stop and have a beer!"}
{"text":"I have never had a bad experience at this place. I used to come here on the reg because I used to live at San Marin Apartments down the street. The parking is sometimes a little rough because it is right next to/inside the mall. But I would 100% order the gardein boneless wings as an appetizer and get them as a meal because they are heavenly! I also had the surf and turf with the turkey burger and that was great as well. The service is also great here, all the servers have always been really nice every time that I have been here. Whenever I have come here and friends have ordered something else, they have always loved it. They also have a good happy hour and like a million beers on tap!"}
{"text":"Working near town square I would always go with my coworkers atleast 2-3 times a week. This past week, there was a hair in my pizza and the server had the audacity to tell me \"that's funny, there's no girl cooks in the back\" Then he asked me if I wanted another. Because of this little incident I will no longer go there ever again. The hair was baked inside of the pizza and it was a happy hour pizza so trust me, I wasn't trying to get it for free. I had ate one slice as well. I was extremely disappointed that no manager came to say sorry. My coworker paid for her bill and we left. I left two stars because I've had great experiences before but this time sealed the deal of me not coming back."}
{"text":"Great service!! The management is awesome I just arrived and got my first beer at the bar waiting to be seated....on my way to our table I dropped my beer:(:(...they were quick to make sure I was ok and cleaned it up super fast!!! They did the nicest thing ever and gave me a replacement beer:):) super happy Thanks so much... Coming back for sure!!"}
{"text":"OMG...Why didn't I know about this place!  They have like 1000 beers on tap!  Well not that many, but a lot!  I love there menu!  We got the pastrami sliders! And it came with fries!   It was so good!  Not sure what beer we got, but I really, really liked it a lot  It was a little more expensive than what were use to paying!  It's all good though, we will splurge here from time to time! They had this raspberry beer!  SAY WHAT!  Yes, rasberry, it taste like a soda!   It was interesting!  Anyway, I will be back!"}
{"text":"Yes, i drank the whole thing! On my last visit here, the Franziskaner Hefewezian was recommended and it is now my all time favorite beer ... its that good. The servers here really know thier beer. They are the reason i give a 5 star rating. Happy hour is just that ... pretty awesome! Looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"I never get disappointed with the spicy tuna roll, and the delicious chicken soup, the service a bit slow for me."}
{"text":"Excellent service. I haven't been to a Yard House in years and I'm glad we decided to eat here. It was Happy hour (Thursday at 5pm) and we got the Bleu crab cakes and Poke nachos for 7 bucks. Then we also order the crab and artichoke dip. It was so delicious I could hardly get out of my chair. Our waitress was really nice. Overall good experience. I will definitely be back again soon."}
{"text":"Ordered the bacon bbq cheddar burger and man was is unsatisfying meal for $15. Meat was good but small for the price. Cold fries and it seemed like they gave me one bacon and it was cut in half. I was still hungry after I finished my plate. Service was great and when I explained how sorry this burger was to my waitress she did comp a dessert. Don't get the burgers if your hungry. Could have went to in n out and got a cheaper meal and been more satisfied then yard house. Don't know when I will be back if I do it will probably be for the beer on tap?"}
{"text":"Yardhouse is a great all american sports bar / restaurant.. Yardhouse kinda reminds me of an upscale applebees but way better!

They have hundreds of beer selections.

They also have a great happy hour where appetizer's are half off from 4-6pm and in the evening 9-close

The only part i did not like about this place was they did not take reservations. A person like me who hates to wait because I lack the luxury of free time m would like to make reservations.

Overall the staff is friendly and their food is good.

This place is LOUD and it is hard to talk with other people without scremaing.

So if your dining here make sure your ready to scream you conversations..

We had the spinach and artichoke dip which was so freaking good and their poke, lettuce wraps and their bbq chicken salad.. 4 people actually shares all this asian style and made us all full.. If your into sharing and tasting all kinds of foods i suggest ordering appetizer's or sharing your entrees..  It's a great way for everyone to taste the food.."}
{"text":"Was here Sun/15 June about 9:45 pm:
- Seated us quickly in a booth (opted out of the patio since it was too windy).
- Had draft German hefeweizen (wheat) beer, my favorite.
- At 10 pm happy hour kicked in so had the 2 different fish apps (Hawaiian Poke Stack and Seared Ahi Sashimi) which were about $6 ea (50% off apps for happy hour).
- My friend had the World Cup/Rio themed beer/cocktail, which she liked."}
{"text":"This was my first experience at a yard house! I really enjoyed how they had so many taps for us to choose from! We had a very large group and the bar tender did a great job of taking care of us. I would head back for food next time!

I have to update my review as I have been for Lunch now! I enjoyed a club sandwich with sweet potato fries!! They were so yummy. For an appetizer we got the crab and artichoke dip which was good."}
{"text":"Always a great experience. Extremely friendly, helpful wonderful staff all around! Great food and drinks and a wonderful atmosphere. Can't go wrong with the Yard House."}
{"text":"Located in Town Square, their food menu is diverse. I recommend the steak salad or the chopped salad. There are over 100 beers that stay consistently cold. The serve is good but doesn't really stand out. This place is great for large or small groups."}
{"text":"The best surprise in Phoenix this summer, other than my nice new job, was the discovery of the Yard House's expansive beer selection, delicious food, and friendly service.

Last week a bunch of us came here to try it out, mostly because there wasn't anything else around that sounded good. I arrived late and opted for a wheat-and-banana draft beer and chicken strips and fries, a nice staple. The server took my late order in stride and had it out in what seemed like a few minutes. The beer was delightful, the chicken strips flavorful and fresh, the truffle fries crispy and tasty. I walked out for just over $20 very satisfied.

Tonight we went back, a smaller group than before. Once again I arrived a little late (do we sense a theme here?) and once again the server made it work and got us all seated and ordering. He made some great menu suggestions for our little group and gave us enough time to decide without wasting time. I landed on a grilled pastrami with pickled jalapenos that had a nice zing to it and sweet potato fries that were as light and crispy as any I've ever had, and moreso than most. The rest of our little band's food looked beautiful and tasted great, from the round of drinks that started us off to the last-minute dessert of creme brulee.

One minor disappointment - I suspect that the Yard House would make a fine Reuben sandwich, but not finding one on the menu surprised me. I would have liked to try their take on a Reuben, one of my personal benchmarks for a good bar-and-grill. Sadly, the grilled pastrami is the closest they have to it.

Even so, the Yard House's extensive beer selection, unique menu, and reasonable prices make it a place worth visiting more than once. Maybe next time they'll have that Reuben for me."}
{"text":"Eine große Auswahl an Bieren und richtig leckere Pastagerichte. Freundliche Bedienung und angenehme Atmosphäre."}
{"text":"Large menu selection. Food was average. Service was average. One thing that was notable was the beer list. They had dozens of beers available on tap."}
{"text":"I am not a big beer drinker, so I can't attest to the many different options they have in that area, but I can tell you about their martinis.

They have a huge menu of specialty martinis and other cocktails that are all pretty darn tasty if you ask me.  My friend really liked the chocolate something or other martini, I had a pear one that was delicious and another pal really enjoyed the pomegranate press.

The food is pretty good or I was buzzed.  Or both.  We had the cheese pizza and an onion ring tower (both half-off for happy hour).  Which, by the way, truly is a tower of onion rings.  And then the waitress brought out a free piece of cheesecake for my birthday.  It was a great time had by all. 

But the best thing about Yard House is the location.  It's right by Kona and Z Tejas and if you start right at 3pm, you can hit happy hour at each location and then take the free trolley to Giligin's. Yes, I did this on Friday and it was TONS of fun. Try it."}
{"text":"We visited early on a weekday morning, just as they opened for lunch. With the time difference, we were ready for lunch when it was AZ breakfast time. We were starving. Thankfully the portions at the Yard House are fantastically huge. 

I ordered the Tuna Poke nachos and a soup and salad combo.  I really didn't need the combo, but it seemed more civilized to have a a little something else before descending on a plate full of sashimi tuna, avocado, green onion, jalapeno, with a drizzle of sauce-amazingness, on top of wonton crisps.    

The Poke nachos were better than I ever imagined. You. Must. Try. Them. 

My husband had the bacon breakfast sandwich with a side cup of fruit. He said it was really good. It looked like something I would order if there wasn't Poke nachos available. 

The staff is sparse and needs either training or an attitude adjustment.  I hope our waitress  was an outlier. I really like the Yard House. 

Place was packed by the time we left. Glad we got in early."}
{"text":"Went here last evening and it was super busy. Waited about 15 minutes to be seated and then we were placed at a table which was right between the bar and some booths. Which were both packed.

So it was super. Fucking. Noisy. Which was great for my anxiety!

Food wise, we got the macaroni and cheese which I thought was really good. And we also got the thai chicken pizza off of the Gardenia menu. I was pretty impressed with all the things on the vegetarian menu, and they even have little V's next to the food names to indicate it is animal free. The thai chicken of course was not real chicken, not sure what brand they use and forgot to ask, but it was really amazing.

The waiter was cool, and frequently came back to check on us and brought our food out pretty fast despite the amount of traffic there was.

The only I recommend is, if you hate people, don't come here!

 It's super loud, you'll have to shout out your waiter to get them to hear you. By the end of the night I wanted to cry cause the sound was unbearable. But that's just cause I'm a weirdo! Everyone else seemed to be having a good time."}
{"text":"I had stopped going to the Yard House's across the valley after one particularly bad encounter with a rude waiter at the Red Rock location, but cruising the new Linq area (which my hermit ass had yet to explore) I gave this place another try. Mostly because it was the only place open and decent enough to eat at.

It wasn't very crowded, probably because it was later in the evening, so service was quick and attentive. My favorite thing about the Yard House is their extensive vegan/vegetarian section. Compared to most places that either leave you with just a house salad or some shitty microwaved Boca burger, the Yard House actually uses some tasty meat substitute and incorporates it into their existing dishes. 

The selection is vast, anything from pizzas, orange chick'n, and penne pasta with chik'n. (chik'n as in not real chicken, not as in I can't spell mmk)
This is one of the main reasons I even agreed to give this place another shot, most places don't give a shit about vegans/vegetarians/or anyone with food restrictions and it's one of the few places I've been to that have had a wide variety of vegetarian options without actually being a named vegetarian restaurant. 

And what is a Las Vegas restaurant without a vast selection of beers to choose from?
My favorite mix to get is the Black Velvet, because if you don't like Guinness you're wrong. But if you don't, worry not, there are many selections of dark, red, brown, pale, ciders, and other beers to choose from, as well as an extensive wine list, and of course, spirits for the super lonely.

Prices are relatively the same here as their other locations, reasonable but not exactly under the definition of cheap.

The service was great here, and I hope it's a trend at this location, I definately want to come back more often."}
{"text":"Dinner at Yard House.  We had a 35 min wait.  We went to the bar and the bartender greeted us and took our order as we stood two deep.  The chicken pot pie was large and the crust was light and tasty.  Would recommend."}
{"text":"***YELP 100 CHALLENGE 15/100***

This has always been one of my favored spot for casual dining. We used to frequent the one in downtown LA. Now that we've moved, we go to the location at the LINQ. Everything I have tried from this chain have been pretty good like the lobster, crab and artichoke dip, fried calamari and ahi poke bowl among others for appetizers. The pasta is great as well believe it or not, BUT I always revert to my favorite Seared Ahi steak sandwich, I'm hooked! I mean what's not to love, it's seared perfectly on the outside and raw inside, with the addition of the caramelized onion and peppercorn aioli? It's the perfect marriage. Try it, you wont be disappointed. Their menu is extensive so it'll take several visits to try most of them. It's a cool and fun place to hang out, chill vibe. They have something for everyone, be it beers on tap or girly cocktails, whatever floats your boat basically. As far as desserts, I love the chocolate soufflé and macadamia nut cheesecake. The smores brownie was pretty good, decadent even but it's a tad too sweet for me."}
{"text":"I go here all the time. Funny, because I always get this really nice girl named Blair as our waitress! She is very timely and very good at suggesting some awesome food! I love the beer selection! The reason I'm going back on a star is because it always takes forever for the food to come out. Overall really good experience (:"}
{"text":"This location has the same great menu as all he other Yard House locations.  They really do have something for everyone, and the quality of their food and drinks seems to be consistent across all locations.  What makes this location special is the view.  At night, you can watch the High Roller Ferris wheel go around, and from some spots you can get in some great people-watching, which is always entertaining in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Yardhouse is somewhere I can go and know the food and drinks will always be good. They are consistent everytime I visit and is my go to spot in town square.  Last night was pretty busy, 30 minute wait for a table but I headed over to the bar to have a drink while I waited and before I knew it the 30 minutes were up. I had the peach martini (highly recommend )."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOOOOOVE Yard House!  When we first moved to Vegas (about a year & a half ago) the only one in town was at Town Square - we were STOKED when the one at Red Rock opened up last summer in our neck of the woods!

How can you go wrong with amazing food and a fantastic beer selection?  Where else can you get a Young's Double Chocolate Stout and a Leffe, both on tap, at the same place?  I also like that I can try a new beer w/o having to pay for a whole glass.  They do tasters ($2?) that are a few sips, definitely more than a shot.

My favorite item on the menu (well - it's actually the ONLY item on the menu I've had, I ordered it my first time there, and can't bring myself to order anything else since) is the Blue Crab Cake Hoagie (hold the bacon) with fresh sliced avocado, tomato, and some really good remoulade/aioli dressing with shoe string fries.  mmm mmm mmm.  My fiance DIES for the rare Ahi Tuna sandwich - again, he ordered it the first time there and can't help but continue to order it every time we go.

We're actually planning on going back tonight, because it's hands down our favorite LV restaurant.  L O V E IT!

Oh and for my fellow vegetarians out there (yea I eat seafood - sue me), they have a whole section on the menu that they make w/ Gardein products.  While I haven't had any (can't say no to the crab cake) I have friends that have enjoyed it very much!"}
{"text":"I met a blind date here. It was a convenient location that has dependable beer and pretty good food. Never can find my car."}
{"text":"Everything was going good until my food showed up 2 bites into my soup my entree showed up & sat on table till I finished my soup. Needless to say entree was sent back cuz it sat there. Ugh just got check & really they don't even comp to the 3$ soup or a glass of wine for the inconvenience"}
{"text":"I love the Yard House. Always classy. My first date with my boyfriend was here... We still go when we need a quick spot."}
{"text":"Well,if you are Beer Lover you should definitely go to Yard House !!! Location is very good ,nice and clean atmosphere,excellent service. Prices are reasonable. Food is good. I will be back again and again :)"}
{"text":"Service was great, food was good. Pricey, but busiest place at Westgate"}
{"text":"The server was great! The food was subpar, we went to YH for my birthday which was supposed to be a special occasion. The management was inept. There were sooo many problems the manager came to our table 4 times over a 1 hour sitting and she didn't do anything to remedy our problems."}
{"text":"I heard really good reviews about this place but unfortunately my experience wasn't the same...it was okay...I went here on a date...if I could leave a review for him...he would have been -3 stars...lol but on to the food...so the vibe, atmosphere, Ambiance or whatever you like to call it was excellent it was a little crowded but the wait wasn't too bad. I ordered... correction I attempted to order a chicken-less chicken burger with cheese and avocado which was on the menu but I personally don't like the chicken-less chicken so I just wanted extra avocado, cheese and whatever else came on the sandwich. How so ever the waitress said that she couldn't do that (remove the meatless patty) and I asked why and she basically said they are not made for custom-order....?? So I said I'll pay the same price just toss the petty she still said no she didn't go and ask anyone she didn't go talk to the manager or the Cook or anything she just said it couldn't be done so I just said okay moving right along... so I ended up ordering Buffalo cauliflower bites in truffle fries...my \"date\" (using that term very loosely...lol) ordered a pulled pork with bacon burger? It looked REALLY good...but y'all know ya girl doesn't eat the meats...lol when my waitress brought his Burger she also brought me cold cauliflower bites and cold truffle fries I sent them back the manager came out and apologized because they were cold and said they had to me make me fresh food and once it got there it was delicious but I ended up waiting 20 minutes to sit down 20 minutes to wait for my food to come the first time and then 20 more minutes for to be redelivered order I only ordered sides basically so it was a bit taxing...
But let's not throw away the whole experience! the Truffle fries were amazing if you are in the area- try the Truffle fries...they are delicious the burgers looked good as well and they also had many vegetarian options All in all if I had originally ordered the Truffle fries and buffalo cauliflower bites I would have given them at least a 4!  but because of the wait and the poor customer service from our waitress I gave them a 3.... #trufflefriesforlife"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday evening with my girlfriend on Memorial Day weekend. The beer selection is absolutely amazing, 125 beers on tap and the drink list has them organized by flavor properties (light, fruity, malty, heavy, etc.) and they offer small glasses for about $3.50 so you can try more variety of beer. Got the chicken nachos for an appetizer and honestly it was enough food for 2 people to share and not need an entree, it tasted very fresh and I enjoyed it a lot. We both got different burgers and they both looked and tasted great. The fries are thin so they get cold rather quickly but they are also very good. Looking to go back very soon to try their Moscow mule because they use a house ginger beer. Also brought home street tacos which are also worth going for. Our waitress Nicole was super helpful and insightful on both beer and food items. Will go back often! Only complaint was loud music but it got quieter as business died down, it might have been to drown out the loud children."}
{"text":"This is a regular spot of mine. Happy our deals are great! Good beer selection and service is always good. Sometimes hard to get a table (very busy location) always a good hang!"}
{"text":"I'm not really familiar with what food they serve here.To be honest I come here once in a while to catch a basketball or football game.  This location can get really packed during Thur-Sun night and being located in Town Square that's fairly common with the establishments they have here with the exception of Kabuki.

They have a big selection of beers on tap in Yard House.  But with the way I am I don't  take advantage of trying out other selections. I'm a Guinness and Bud Light guy. The setting is like any other Yard House and the pretty friendly crowd.  No complaints here except at times its hard to catch the Bartenders attention.  If you're not looking to party but just want to hang out with friends to drink, eat, and watch sports, Yard House is the place to be in Town Square."}
{"text":"Dear Yard House,

Myself largely being a patron of independently owned eateries, you tarnish my semi-conscientious restaurant going habits by luring me into your chain establishment. Over and over again.

Had you not so many varied and delicious ales, stouts, lagers, and lambics on your taps, were your onion rings not served in a veritable ring toss of obscene heights, did your happy hour not make me quite so happy, then maybe, MAYBE I could resist your heated/cooled patio so perfectly poised for people watching.

Alas, your Cuban pork dip sandwich begs to be shared. Your chicken nachos beckon me softly. Even your sliders (regular, turkey, or Korean BBQ) sing out my name in a trio of tiny voices; I cannot resist their siren song.

I am a ruined woman.

Unfailingly Yours,
Lori 

Pros: Great happy hour, M-F, 3-6, reverse happy hour S-Thur, 10-midnight. People watching patio (I like to guess what movies people are going to see based on appearances), friendly service, unmatched beer list.

Cons: Wait can be lengthy at prime times, service can be slow when busy. Chain:("}
{"text":"Lettus wraps were great, and pear and gargonzola flatbread was AWESOME, st louis style bbq pork ribs were large and in charge but good, really moist, not dry at all meat fell off the bone practically...  i found a new beer which is big for me since I dont drink lots of beer, but I will try them...  Petrus Ages Red... really good! Also Peroni (italian beer). The plethora of options you have with beer is endless and they carry international beers as well.  There is a screen dedicated to beers that scrolls all the specialty and in season beers, along with nice tvs and good music."}
{"text":"My favorite restraunt bar none. Every time I come here I get the same GREAT service, the same GREAT food, and the same GREAT beer and cocktails. I don't eat meat and they have a whole section of their menu that caters to that. They also remember me when I come in and treat me well. Everyone always brings up the price point (which isn't bad at all when you look at it) but when it comes to great food, beer, and service, wouldn't you pay top dollar for that? We are talking $10-15 plates, and $5 craft beer.. That sounds normal to me? Either way I have been here more times than I can count and it's better every time I come. Yard house is simply the best."}
{"text":"Meal was a BBQ chicken salad and a bacon cheeseburger. Cheeseburger was pretty good. Salad was okay I liked the shoestring crispy fried onion rings served atop the salad."}
{"text":"I go to yard house quite a bit. It is my favorite place to eat. The one at the linq is the best! They have great service with nice employees. They also have a great vegetarian menu!"}
{"text":"Ok I've been here more than enough times to finally write a review. \"...for a chain\" is a pretty cliche comment. Well regarding the Westlake location, you can remove that sentiment and know that this is a great experience, period! The beer options are plentiful and the bartenders are very personable. The rest of the staff are just as friendly. The spaciously modern interior is impressive and whoever selects the music playlist keeps the vibe loose and casual. 

I can vouch for the cuban sandwich but what I've recently come to appreciate is the Happy Hour, which is from 3-6pm on weekedays I believe. Drink and food specials are tiered, depending on the size/type of drink and the same can be said of the food. The fried chicken strips though? Nom nom nom! Tender chicken with fries accompanied with honey mustard and ranch dressing (which is unreal by the way) is a steal for $6! Go get a taste!"}
{"text":"Fun place to go for drinks and good times with friends!  I agree that the Happy Hour from 3-6 pm is definitely pretty sweet.  Can't go wrong with 1/2 on appetizers and drinks.  For appetizers, we tried the Onion Rings, California Roll, Fried Chicken Strips, Fried Calamari, Spicy Tuna Roll, and Blue Crab Cakes.  Onion Rings, Fried Calamari, and Blue Crab Cakes were all nice & crispy.  Fried Chicken Strips came with fries and were good as well, but nothing out of the ordinary.  The California Roll and Spicy Tuna Roll were interesting, in that their presentation was unlike that of those you see in a sushi restaurant.  They actually came as one huge, cut sushi piece, kind of like a cake or a tart.  The presentation was pretty unique, but the taste was also good but nothing really special.  If I was really craving sushi, I'd probably go check out normal sushi places like Osaka, Sushi Club, or something along those lines.  For drinks, I've tried the Mangolicious Martini, the Malibu Peach Martini, Blue Moon beer, and Wyder's Raspberry Cider.  I'm usually not a huge beer drinker, but the Wyder's was good...nice raspberry taste! Of course, looove the martinis!  And to top it all off, we all shared a Kona Coffee Ice Cream Sundae, which was to die for!!! I would definitely be hitting up Yard House a lot for Happy Hour with different groups of friends in the future."}
{"text":"Super impressed with their tacos and the spicy rice. The fish tacos are delicious and just the perfect portion size to leave room for another beer."}
{"text":"Their Happy Hour deal was an affordable and tasty option in the area. The chicken tenders were surprisingly moist and flavorful. The recommended poke nachos weren't exactly my cup of tea, but I can appreciate the aim behind the dish. Yes, I ordered a gin cocktail at a beer hall but it was well mixed."}
{"text":"This place is to die for! This place has the yummiest food for being a chain in Las Vegas! The atmosphere is very classy and upscale. During the day there is a nice family vibe, and when the sun goes down it has a thriving night life of it's own! The place is always crowdy but the service is great! 

When I usually go I always get their classic sliders and it comes with a side of fries. There are four little burgers on the plate and a mount of shoestring fries. So yummy and everything you could want in a classic mini burger! Although they're small they are surprisingly filling!

Next time you want to enjoy a night out with your friends or a lunch date with your family.. This is the place to go! Not pricey and very good! :)"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and centrally located at Desert Ridge, which I am there nearly every day having a meeting at Starbucks. Great lettuce wraps during Happy Hour. Tons of big screen TV's with all the sports playing on them."}
{"text":"First time we went, took an hour to get an extremely overcooked burger. We left disappointed but gave them a second chance. Second time the burger was seared and raw on the inside. Service was good and the beer selection is excellent which is the reason for 2 stars instead of just one. Maybe just get some super overpriced drinks and eat elsewhere"}
{"text":"The staff was friendly and helpful ( printed us directions to a nearby mall that had a Dick's Sporting Goods). The food was all outstanding...we had chicken nachos, the BBQ sauce they used on the nachos was really tasty. I had the Poke Stack which was fresh and the wasabi/soy sauce had the perfect amount of kick, my wife had a summer salad with grilled chicken that she said was excellent. I sampled 2 draft beers, a local brew (Four Peaks Kilt Lifter) which was pretty good and an always reliable Smithwicks."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner and great service while dining on the patio here. Tasha and Kim did a great job handing off service when Tasha's shift ended. We received our food and additional drinks seamlessly. We arrived around 5 p.m. and were promptly seated on the patio with the heater over head. Tasha was great about turning it on and off if we got too hot. 

We ordered the Pepper Jack burger with roasted pablanos and a fantastically tasty garlic aioli. The fries were awesome. I am not a fry person and will typically leave them for last. I am so glad I ate them first because they were some of the best fries I've ever had a perfectly seasoned shoe string fry. I love super thin cut crispy fries.

Ironically the first few beers I mentioned Tasha were not on the menu such as Franziskaner Hefe-Weissbier. Tasha was able to point out a couple of other suggestions but I ended up with my other favorite, Tripel Karmeliet. After living years in Milwaukee I have tried a lot of beers. Yardhouse is great for finding things I haven't had in awhile. 

They make a mean turkey club with fresh ingredients the only low note of the dinner or should I say blah moment was the seared ahi tuna that we had for an appetizer. It wasn't bad nor was it great. It was pretty middle of the road and a forgettable part of the evening amongst the great beer and sandwiches we enjoyed. 

We will definitely be back several times for the patio atmosphere, great fries and wide selection of beers and drinks."}
{"text":"Love the Yard House! Have a great time each time  I'm here!!  I enjoy sitting outside no matter if it's a  out or cold out, so much seating outside! Try it out. Seth are waiter, very good and fun! We have humor and we all fit in well. It makes Seth's job better and our experience awesome! Onto the food, have to be honest, the lettuce wraps- not so good, they are blah . The boneless chicken was excellent, firecracker flavor!"}
{"text":"The duck wings and the lobster, crab, and artichoke dip were very tasty. I really enjoyed the bread that came with the dip. My husband ordered the baja fish tacos that came with the rice and beans. It was just \"alright.\" He barely touched the rice and literally took 2 spoons of the beans and then was finished. My garlic lobster noodle dish was great. It had perfect portion of seafood and noodles. I ended up getting full from the appetizers however, so my husband finished the rest of my plate. He found it tasty as well. We ordered the chocolate souffle, which was just okay. I have had better.
It would be 4 stars, but I took off a star because our server was not friendly at all. She seemed to be mad at us, when we were not being difficult. I work in a restaurant, I understand how annoying it is to have difficult customers. She was not very friendly and was not helpful. I don't know if Jessica was having a bad day, but I hope she doesn't treat all customers like that."}
{"text":"I love Yard House. Whether you want to have a nice sit-down dinner with the family, pound a few beers at the bar with your boys, or have a relaxing Happy Hour hangout, Yard House is the place!
The crusted Swordfish is amazing.
The layered beers are awesome, I like trying a new one each time I go, but I seem to wander back to the Eclipse (Half Guiness/Half Blue Moon).
They also have Boddington's Irish Cream Ale as one of their over ONE HUNDRED draft beers, and that's one of my fav's.
Sushi rolls are really cool here, too. Not like the small rolls cut into 6 or 7 pieces like you normally get; it's a huge one piece roll, that you can cut slices out of (almost like a pizza), or just dig into. The Ahi is great & the California is even better."}
{"text":"I came here for a couple drinks and appetizers with a group of people while staying at the Red Rock.  If you like beer and enjoy trying different types of beer, then this is the place for you.  The beer list on draft is quite extensive and good.  Our waitress was very nice and knowledgable.  I had the sweet potato fries appetizer with maple bacon dipping sauce, and it was delicious.  The fries were perfectly fried and the sauce was an interesting combination with the sweet potato.  I recommend it.  This place was a good choice."}
{"text":"Walked in and sat down the bar. It was dead as hell. Four bartenders working there and we were completely ignored for 10 minutes, not even a \"hello, or we'll be just a second.\"  Walked out without even ordering a beer. I will not be back or ever recommend this location to anybody."}
{"text":"Great food. Awesome happy hour. A little loud... But love it!"}
{"text":"A frequent hangout spot with friends.

I wouldn't come here just for drinks, or just for the food, or just to eat....come here to eat good food with a huge selection of fairly priced drinks, and plan to be here for a little while.

The service is pretty quick, and a refill of any beverage doesn't take long.  They move around a lot, so it is easy to grab their attention if needed.

The beer selection is one of the best in town, if not the best, and there will be plenty to choose from.  I typically like trying new beers, so I order small sets or their tasting sets to mix the palate.

The food is good...it is not outstanding, but it is good.  Like I mentioned before, treat it like good bar food.  It is good, but I wouldn't come here just to eat...not that noteworthy IMO.

The vibe and atmosphere is cool...a good place to burn a short few hours with friends!"}
{"text":"I go to the Yard House a lot but I went for happy hour for the first time. The happy hour prices are really good and it's a good selection."}
{"text":"Had a great time here!  Sat at the bar and both bartenders were the perfect balatof friendly and attentive without being intrusive.   Also the chicken nachos were amazing and the margaritas were perfectly made."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! My husband and I went here only because someone gave us a gift card. It's not a place we would normally have picked but I'm soooo super glad we went. The view was gorgeous from the upper deck. The atmosphere was very comfortable even slightly romantic. The service was great with friendly attentive waiters. The price was really good I thought. I had the Ginger Salmon, my husband had an excellent sandwich (I forget which one sorry) we both had drinks and two appetizers all totaling only 82 dollars!! Normally we would spend 200 dollars on a dinner with excellent food so this was a pleasant surprise! I don't really think you could go wrong with any dish on the menu. We would highly recommend going here and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Good option for (a long) lunch.

Been to Yardhouse three times for lunch.  The variety of sandwich and soup/salad combos are really good, as are the two personal pizza options.  With a drink, the meal is moderately priced at about $18 with tip.

Knocks are the overall lags between ordering, getting food, getting check(s), and getting payment receipts back.  It has never taken less than an 1:40.  Staff is really nice, but they really need to tighten their game up.  Noise can be an issue as you'll likely be hoarse when you leave-- you don't notice how much you yell to talk to the people around you.  The place also has more appeal if you like a sports bar setting.

I'll give them four stars instead of three when they learn to shorten turnarounds.  Regardless, it's a good option for tasty food if you have the time to spare."}
{"text":"Something happened here. They started out strong since they opened but their service has dwindled. For some reason the servers seem somewhat distant from their customers. They were great to deal with for so long but now it is not enjoyable. Sure, the micros are great but there is an abundance of great microbrews in the area to enjoy that have great service. I hate to say it but it is typical of established operations to fall into this comfort trap. I hate to see it happening to the Yard House but it is happening. Hope they can turn this around."}
{"text":"If the goal here was a great place to hang out, eat, drink, and have fun, it could nary have been executed better.  From the bachelor-pad-sheik decor and numerous large flatscreens, to the cute and friendly waitstaff, and who could forget, the wonderful food and huge beer selection, this place is a winner.

I'm not sure what problems some other reviewers had with the kitchen at this place, but they were on top of their game the afternoon I dropped by.  The Korean BBQ appetizer didn't have as strong a garlic flavor as one would expect, but the meat was perfectly cooked, and the flavor of the meat shone through well.  The rice could have been stickier, though.

The burger I ordered medium was perfectly cooked, and wonderously tender and flavorful.  It certainly goes down as one of the better burgers I've ever had.  The fries were light and crispy, but could have been more numerous.  My friend ordered a very tasty upscale mac'n'cheese which came adorned with perfectly cooked and juicy chicken breast pieces.

The servers were very attentive, and made for a very nice overall experience.  This is definitely the kind of place for you, if you're looking for great food and a relaxed, fun enviornment, but a touch more upscale than that little local hole in the wall.  Whether the goal is after-work unwinding, weekend playtime, or just a nice meal in a comfortable place, the Yard House delivers."}
{"text":"There is no way to be classy and drink 1/2 a yard of ale, so forget it and just do it.

My favorite combination? A Shandy and the spicy tuna roll... super fantastic.

When I am in town here I love that I can walk from my hotel to this hot spot. Great staff, good food always consistent. I would like it if they added a meatball dish however but that is minor when you are considering a full menu of beers on tap.

Sometimes after I leave here I have drank far more than I ate... and... well... that's ok."}
{"text":"Hit or miss. I always feel like crap when I leave (usually because I over-indulge in sub par food). I only go during happy hour- if I stick to the ahi and a beer I am fine. Not a place I recommend if you want good food."}
{"text":"Yard House was always one of my many favorite spots around town. The food was always pretty good, and lets be honest, the beer and dining menu is so extensive, there's honestly a little something for everyone.

Last night I went to dinner here with my fiance and his family, since his aunt was leaving Vegas for a while to stay with her daughter on the East Coast. Since we had a bigger party, I understand that things happen and sometimes there's an issue or two with someone's food, but not to the extent that we experienced. It truly was a series of unfortunate food events. Yikes. 

Here's the combined list of what happened:

- My fiance had ordered a roast beef dip sandwich, which looked delicious at first, but when he went to pick it up, there was hardly any bread on the bottom and it was soaked in Au Jus. Would you want to eat a soggy sandwich? 

-My fiance's mom had ordered a shrimp appetizer, which ended up being undercooked. 

-My fiance's brother had ordered a beer, which never arrived.

Now, despite all the issues the customer service was extremely attentive. They made up for each of the mistakes, but they just kept on happening which ended up making the experience less enjoyable. While we did appreciate the great service from the manager, I'm not sure that we will be making a trip back there any time soon."}
{"text":"I'm only giving them a second star because I know the food is great!! I called the Yardhouse at the Linq, in complete awareness that they don't do reservations after 5, in hopes that I can get good advice from a manager on how to get a table of twenty in there after 5. The manager I talked to said to come in early, about hour early, at they could hold it for 8PM. 

When I got there at 7 I had a frantic manager tell me it would be at least 3 1/2 hours. I told her we didn't want to go to Chayo's because of the horrible reviews, and that we're only going there because they take reservations after 5. I also told her I called and talked to management notifying them I was coming. She still was relentless in telling us it would be a three and half hour wait. If that was TRUE, they would be closing by the time they called us. That's insane and just not possible. I understand an hour/ hour and a half wait, but three and half hours?! The woman I talked to on the phone was so nice, but the woman I talked to when I got there had a SERIOUS attitude problem. Shame on the management."}
{"text":"Always the best food. Late night service can be challenging as they run out if food often."}
{"text":"Beer selection is great! Service was awesome! Food was fabulous! Music couldn't be better! So why only 4 stars you wonder??? Well it's because there were a lot of small children. I get that parents like it here. But it's a BAR hence the selection of 120 beers... the food is great and I get you want to share it, but it isn't cheap...why would you bring small screaming children into a bar, with loud, rock music????? It made it really, really loud and annoying! I will try another day, because really everything else was spot on!!  Hoping parents leave their small children at home next time..."}
{"text":"Fantastic place!
From the drinks to the food, it is a great place to eat and enjoy sports.
The variety of drinks is great. There is also a decent amount of vegan/vegetarian dishes that is offered.
The ambiance is dark ,but cozy. Our waiter was friendly and attentive.
The wait was a little long, but worth the wait.
If in the area, it is a must try!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to hang out, watch sports, and drink beer. And, oh yeah, a great place to eat too. 

The last time I was there, had some sliders to go along with Hoegaarden and Framboise beer. It was Excellent!"}
{"text":"Okay, so I'm not a fan of the food at all. There's nothing wrong with it, I'm just a vegan who gets grossed out by all fake processed meat, so that's my bias. WITH THAT BEING SAID, this place sets the bar for service. I mean that with all my heart. From the moment I was greeted by the host, to the moment I left the restaurant, ALL the staff treated myself, and my party like pure gold. Authentic, helpful, knowledgeable, accommodating staff ALL THE WAY. Can I emphasize that again? The staff here was so absolutely amazing, it literally restored some of my faith in humanity. I'm so impressed, keep up the awesome service you guys."}
{"text":"This review is all about service and quality.

I ordered fish and chips.  Very good. Nice and crispy.

My wife ordered a medium well hamburger with pepper jack cheese. What she received was a medium rare burger with cheddar (or american).

Waiter sent it back and manager came out and apologized. Second time around the burger had the right cheese but was still blood red in all placed except the edges.

They need a new chef to cook burgers.  The place was not even that busy.

They did remove the burger from our bill.

Felt sorry for the waiter. The manager did not come back out after the second screw up."}
{"text":"We just moved to Phoenix and this was the first restaurant we decided to try and I'm glad we did. We started off with the California roll and it was a perfect size to share. I ended up getting the ribs, and they were incredibly tasty. My wife got one of their burgers and she claimed it was one of the best burgers she's had in a while. Huge thanks to our waitress Jen she was very sweet and knew everything about the menu! We will definitely be coming in again."}
{"text":"Always a winner. Always go here when I want great quick food. Great value for money. Huge portions and really laid back atmosphere. Their music is always on point and a good selection of sports on the TV. Open late too!"}
{"text":"I had dinner for the first time here a couple weekends ago.  I was with a party of 14 and reservations. We got seated right on time (actually a few minutes early!) and the whole experience was great. The food was awesome (highly recommend poke nachos as an appetizer). We had 2-3 servers since it was such a large group and everyone was very on top of things.  Can't wait to go back :)"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the customer service is horrible.
Took us 10 minutes to be seated with 50 seats being open.
Then once we sat down no waiter or waitress was anywhere to be found.  
Just a horrible way to start of this lunch experience and we haven't even eaten yet.  Wish us luck , step your game up Yardhouse or at least this location"}
{"text":"A close hotel recommended Yardhouse to us... omg so good we had lunch and dinner here during our 48 hours in Vegas. The place is clean, contemporary, and offers great food & beer.
The vampire tacos were life altering. You HAVE to tey these. 
Dinner was much busier tham lunch, however we ate at bar and were super impressed with the way service was managed. Everyone on staff seemed to enjoy being there and each other- speaks.volume of the operation.
Talked to manager who told us they had a location in Chicago, so hoping it is just as great.
Seriously, vampire tacos and any beer you can dream of....definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Busy, Noisy. lots of Beers, Friendly great service.   Hamburger was outstanding, and fries were OK.  The wait for a table was less than the promised time, Nice.
My friend liked her lettuce wrap."}
{"text":"My husband had lunch today at the Yard House and his experience was unpleasant.  He kept getting the wrong order and when he mentioned it to the waiter he corrected my husband (implying my husband did not know what he ordered...really????)
This happened several times in one seating. This is unpleasant, unacceptable and unprofessional!!"}
{"text":"This hip location is a wonderful place to meet for a quick drink, a nice meal or a delectable dessert. The Yard House has always been excellent when I have gone and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"What a great restaurant located right in the heart of Las Vegas Blvd.  We came down here to do the High Roller and enjoy a nice Friday out.  

We came here and got a table at on the patio.  Our servers Alex and Joshua were super cool and very attentive to our food and beverage needs.  

We got the spicy edamame, wings, lettuce wraps, sliders and kale salad.  Everything was great and we will definitely be back.  

Oh btw they have like over 150 beers on tap."}
{"text":"Chicken tortilla soup and turkey melt was great for lunch"}
{"text":"Went there before and after the Packers v Cards playoff game.  As Packer fans in AZ we were very welcomed and treated well.  The bouncers were very nice while waiting in line.  The bartenders were extremely friendly and did well under pressure in a very busy bar.  Rochelle was on bartender that helped us often.  She remembered our round every time we ordered.  Drinks seem a little high but I'm from Wisconsin and not used to theses prices and It was game day.  I still give it a good rating as the drinks were poured fairly and great service. I did not order food but sampled some other people in our group and was very good.  I will go here again when in town."}
{"text":"This place has some good food and awesome atmosphere. 

Watch out for the floors though. They wax them extremely too much and saw 6 people take a nose dive while I was there."}
{"text":"We had the special, the lunch special at was a ranch salad and a pizza for $10 wow what a deal
It was so dang yummy
Our waitress Vicky was very good also!
I'm going to get that lunch sometimes to go. They said I could just order and stop in and get it so that's cool'"}
{"text":"Yard House provides a great atmosphere. I like sports but like that there's no audio. That makes way for some hip music which is 'there' but not THERE if that makes sense. Service is immediate. I gave them 5 stars and am willing to overlook the potato chips in my salad. Yes potato chips. Yes salad. What no jelly beans?"}
{"text":"First. If you can get passed the overwhelming selection of food, this placec is worth it. 
I've only ventured as far ass their Vegetarian Selection, and it is always fantastic. (Go Gardein Fake Meat for the Win!)

Second. Beer Selection - Amazing... They even have Beer cocktails now. I am very excited to start tasting all of these.

Third. The only reason that I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the service is sometimes subpar. But definitely go in.. I may ahve gotten a waiter on one of their bad days. Nothing against the place.

So definitely go here, bring a big group.. it is an awesome place to eat at, and they have reverse happy hour!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed! For what you pay and what the Yard House is supposed to live up to it was just not there for me. The food was greasy, bland and seriously lacked 'care'. Just slapped on a plate!

This review is from July of 2013 LOL. I never finished it, so who knows. Things may have changed by now."}
{"text":"Ahi Steak sandwich WOW! Love it, Halibut amazing, apps are great! The beer can't beat it!"}
{"text":"Such a nice day out we had to sit on the patio for dinner. We had great service from the very start with our seating host. We had 3 adults and a toddler and had our high chair ready in no time! We had a very attentive server named Kelsea T. She was fantastic! She got our Wisconsin cheese curds out at the same time as our son's dinner which was perfect for us! The food was delicious as well! All around 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I visited the yard house while on vacation and I have to say it was a great experience. 

As you walk in the door they are greeting you and even leaving was pleasant. My server Sara was fantastic and much better than the service you receive on the strip.

They have such a great craft beer line up on tap. It was really tough to choose from. But the server was quick to suggest things and talk craft beer. 

I had the Calamari and spicy thai pizza and both were great. I mean it is pub food so keep that in mind. But still good.

So do yourself a favor and go check this place out and take a break from the slots and overpriced Budweiser. Happy hour is from 3-6 so that means cheap pint's and food. I look forward to returning on my next trip to sin city."}
{"text":"Stopped here after thoroughly exploring red rock canyon; we were famished. Okay, okay...maybe not famished but stopping at a place that boasts the most draft beers in the world caught my eye, plus it was connected to the red rock casino, double win!

The draft beer selections lined the center island of the bar all the way around with many of the boring bar regulars but with more craft than anything. The 3 page list of drafts were really impressive and it was nice that they offered 3 different sizes for pours but it was absolutely dreadful that they didn't offer the ability to create our own flights which made them lose a star in my book. The next star was lost because they really didn't have any hard to find specialty brews.... A large selection is nice but ill take a smaller selection any day for better quality.

We decided a small snack was called for so we decided we would split an appetizer between the three of us. The chicken nachos were mouth gobbling good, it was a hearty portion of multicolored chips that stayed crunchy even with the two different types of sauces, guacamole, sour cream, pinto beans, and obey gooey melted cheeses. Yum!! I was impressed with all the flavors and that it wasn't greasy in the least. 

I'd go to this chain again, but not without checking what beers are on tap."}
{"text":"No place like the Yard House to come and unwind before the start of crazy work week. Here in Phoenix for the week and cold beer with great food will sure be a great start :)"}
{"text":"This was my first time dining at the yard house aside from a party that a friend of mine had there when they first opened. It was an excellent experience. I was there with a party of six and with dinner and significant drinks the total came to nearly $300. That includes three appetizers. We started with hummus, calamari, and crispy brussels sprouts. Their pomegranate margaritas go down smooth-maybe a little too smooth! And the vodka refreshers were very much appreciated by the ladies at our table. Our server, Otto, was on point. It's not often you get a server who really just impresses you with their friendliness and great information about the menu. He was all that. At our table we had the coconut shrimp, The grown-up grilled cheese and soup, and the lobster garlic noodles. It was all amazing. I love that I could call ahead at 5 o'clock and put in not a reservation, but at least call and seating to make sure that we had a table relatively quickly when we arrived at 6 o'clock. I appreciate when restaurant to do this, and especially when it works the way it supposed to, as it did here. I highly recommend that you take advantage of that service as well."}
{"text":"As far as \"bar & grill\" type restaurants go, this one is pretty good. Tons of different types of beer to pick from. And surprisingly, a large selection of vegan/vegetarian options. The burgers here are good and great clam chowder soup too. The patio is nice, but if you sit inside when it is crowded, the noise is deafening. Just don't plan on being able to talk across the table."}
{"text":"We liked this restaurant!
Husband had the lamb burger which was really really good.
I had poke - also excellent.
We shared a onion ring tower - too much to eat though.
Service was good, ambiance was good.
Only downside is it was super noisy - seems to be a trend at some of the restaurants in Vegas though.
We'd go back.
Check it out!"}
{"text":"shitty service. the hostess was fooling around, the waitress took 15-20 mins to ask my husband and i what we wanted to drink. once she finally came around and asked us, it took half an hour for us to get our drinks. mind you, haven't even ordered our food yet. one of the worst experiences i've ever had."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorites. I know its a chain but if you want hip go rent Wim Wenders and read your Noam Chomsky. This place is for beer lovers!
with over 100 beers on tap your pallette is never deprived and the knowledgeable, friendly staff that appreciates a good brew.
The menu is not typical bar food. They got this sushi app that can be a meal. 
Usually busy yet still quick service and your mug will stay full for your needs.
Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! My husband and I were in Arizona on vacation and I wish there was a place like this in NYC or NJ!

Thanks again!"}
{"text":"Our favorite place in Las Vegas...go on every trip.  Love, love, love the selection of beers and the bartenders are very knowledgeable in helping you pick the one that fits your tastes the best.  

Brought a large group for dinner and everyone was very satisfied.  Yes, the prices were high, but the food was outstanding.  

Looking forward to visiting again when we return in July."}
{"text":"Great beer selection and awesome service! I've eaten at a couple of the locations around town and they always have great service. The food is good as well. I love the appetizer plates of korean bbq beef and the chicken strips! I recently tried the chicken-rice bowl and that was very good also. I would definitely recommend coming here for a quick drink or meeting people for a nice meal."}
{"text":"This is my third time being to a Yard House and I really enjoyed myself. I have 5 stars because this place deserves nothing less than the stars they earned. Our server Robert had amazing customer service. I felt comfortable and my impression of the establishment was good.

Pros: GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE
Nice environment
Great music
Lovely and trendy interior
Food was out of this world good

Cons: There aren't any! ENJOY

What are you waiting for? Go to Yard House on Las Vegas Blvd!!! Ask for Robert for a server"}
{"text":"Woah. Easily the best and biggest happy hour menu we had come across during our trip to vegas. Located right on the strip in the Linq shoppes heading toward the highroller, we stumbled into the Yard House curious to see the menu. 

Wow. The bar area is huge with plenty of seating as well as plenty of high top tables. We chose to sit at the bar. It took us a little while to figure out what to get because the choices were beyond overwhelming- but this is not a complaint! Everything on this menu looked incredible. We finally decided on poke nachos, california roll (which is like a california roll style tartare rather than a sushi roll), spinach cheese dip and fried mac and cheese. We also ordered a margherita pizza which we took to go for our midnight snack! 

Everything was out of this world, but the fried mac and cheese. AMAZING! I could have ate here every single day that we were in Las Vegas. I also ordered a pineapple cocktail which was delicious as well! If you are in LV- this happy hour is an absolute must!!! Really great service as well. I highly recommend and this was by far the best happy hour we had attended out of our 7 days in town."}
{"text":"Great location, great food, great service!  Casual but classy environment, great variety on the menu."}
{"text":"My wife and I recently visited Las Vegas. Because my wife is vegan, we choose the Yard House for their vegan options. The service was good, the atmosphere was nice, the menu was impressive. I ordered the mac and cheese with truffles. As simple as that dish may sound, it was absolutely delicious. Too bad there isn't a Yard House in Charleston, South Carolina. If there was, I would make it one of our regular places to dine."}
{"text":"Arrived at yard house around 4:45 pm. Ordered a beer. Waited. Reconfirmed my beer order. Waited. Finally the server came back and said they are changing out the taps it'll just be a little while longer. Then my server came back and told me the beer was tapped out. So I ordered a different beer. Waited. Finally received a beer at 5:30. So I waited 45 min to get my first drink and sat there while all my friends drank one or more of their drinks. I have never had a bad experience at this place but after this I'm considering not coming back."}
{"text":"We walked in at 6pm on a Saturday and we had friendly attentive service by all the staff. Bravo !  This is how a restaurant should operate!"}
{"text":"So I frequent this yard house sense it is not that far from my house, I have great service at the tables every time, but when it comes to the bar. All the bartenders Tyler the girl and the black guy that is bald avoids making I contact and never greets.   It a very negative vibe  like they just don't care about hospitality. Tyler fine came by and handed me a menu, the neglected to return to see if I'm ready to order or sample, finally when Tyler returned  I asked if I can sample the house honey blonde. She grabs a goblet instead of the sample cup so I had to informer her that it was just a sample and that's when the attitude started...  I decided  to get a miller lt and when I received it, it had 2 inch of foam so I waited to show her  to ask if she could top it off and when she came  it was deflated. She informed me that she could not do that cause I could have drank some which I hadn't. I told her I never touched it because of that reason, she rolled her eyes and went to fill it.  I thanked her and was going to giver her a tip but after all that forget it! I am a bartender as well  and hospitality is key with a smile..  Hope this will get to management and vouching will be in order.  Thanks"}
{"text":"Great restaurant, a lot of vegetarian options which is great for me. The Gardien orange peel chicken is my favorite. Great place to have food and drinks!"}
{"text":"Came on Friday night we were asked if we would prefer inside or outside. There was a table available on the outside patio so we took that. We were greeted by a friendly energetic server who was fairly helpful with the items on the menu. The drink menu (beer selection) was so vast that extra time was necessary. I eventually went with the house IPA in their halfyard size which is a whopping 32 ounces. The drink was delivered in a glass that was literally a half yard. So that was pretty cool. Even though it was cumbersome at times to pick up and drink, but nothing too serious. 

I decided to order the Classic Cheeseburger and side of fries to go with the my house IPA.  I ordered my burger medium well. The burger was slightly over cooked I am pretty sure it was well and not medium well so you may have to go with just medium. The burger overall was fine nothing special but filled me up just fine . The Fries were great! 

This place has an epic list of beers on the menu and offers a nice atmosphere with good service and pretty good food. I would recommend and especially recommend to beer advocates."}
{"text":"The service was great but the food was not.. I guess cooks don't like to cook 3 hours before closing. Expected better."}
{"text":"This is a review of one thing and one thing only: the turkey burger. Walking around Town Square on a Friday evening with a pal seemed like something different to do (at least for me). 

Honestly, I don't adore Town Square, and I don't really adore any of the limited culinary experiences I have had at Town Square. I do like the relatively pedestrian-friendly space it provides to roam about and window shop. And, I had remembered reading a glowing review of the turkey burger here, so I wanted to give it a nibble.

Let me be upfront and say that if you care about being healthy, you should probably skip this turkey burger. It was frickin' delicious, but I just knew there had to be some bad things in there to make it taste so good. I checked out the nutrition info on the Yard House website, and this mamma jamma has 2810mg of sodium, plus a lot of other large numbers in unhealthy columns. Wow. I should be swimming laps and doing jumping jacks instead of writing this review. At least I substituted the fries for a salad, right?

Just browsing around their nutrition info, I get the impression that the secret to their tasty eats is salt, salt and more salt. Be warned. The California Roll has 3415mg of sodium. Now, how does that happen? I know fish comes from the salty ocean, but... this crab must be dating someone in the Morton family.

So on pure taste, that burger was definitely in the 4 to 5 star range, but I probably will never eat it again.

Despite being absolutely slammed, the service was great. Our waitress didn't even try to rush us off, which really impressed me.

I think I am seriously going to go swim some laps now."}
{"text":"Very good food, beer, and service. We grabbed a quick dinner after the Linq ride and before the show."}
{"text":"I love coming here. The food selection has something for any mood I am in. The drinks are refreshing and quick to be brought out. They have GREAT happy hour prices as well. I brought my best friend here for her 21st and the waiter was amazing! She was excited to try a peanut butter beer and he even brought out a few mini tasters for her to decide what she likes for next time! We were both sold and can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Everytime I come here I always enjoy all the servers! First it was nikki & she was very helpful with recommendations & gave us a greats overall experience. Mike was just as great very friendly and helpful. Today we had Joe & I'm glad to say amazing just like everyone. Food is great I love the vegetarian options. Great gradein buffalo wings were amazing,mushroom spaghetti very good aswells, and drinks are always amazing. My friends have tried the tuna & it was great. However we did not like the cobb salad my friend had he tried it with the chicken & we will not be ordering again but Mike was very nice & took it back & took it off our bill. From the lovely service, to the amazing drinks & food I'll definitely will continue coming here!"}
{"text":"Best meal I've ever had, such a wide variety for vegetarians!!! Esdin was killin it as our server!!! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Good late night dinner here. 

Great pasta with lots o shrimp and bits of lobster.  Great beer list.  Good wine list.

California Reuben sandwich was stringy, shmeary, and salty.  It disappointed.

Friendly staff and nice decor."}
{"text":"Wow. We sat on the patio and watched the 'high roller' go round. Very nice patio. I had the healthy ahi Caesar. Was tasty and not too heavy. Everyone at my table loved the food. Service was a touch slow but they were busy. My friend asked for no cheese on her salad and 3 different folks came out to make sure that the croutons (that have cheese baked  on) were ok. Great follow up!!!"}
{"text":"Mmmm love the poke stack! That's my meal right there, it's an appetizer but it's my meal itself, if I have to order 2 then I do:) nom n nom. Service is great too! Mmmm except for the host, as I came in and went straight to the desk he saw me and rather than saying \" I'll be right with you\" just looked at me and went to continue to blabber with someone else. I was actually going to reach for my compact mirror just to double check if was invisible or turned vampire because I didn't have reflection :/ .. Heheheis it's all good here tho' so it's all good still :)"}
{"text":"Anytime in Vegas...this is a must! I finally ordered the yard of beer. And man was it taste! Huge menu of food and even bigger menu of beer. Just WOW that is all I have to say. When you first walk in and look to your left and see the keg room. You know your in a beer drinkers paradise. As a group of 4 we all ordered different things. And everyone at the table enjoyed the food. I had the Cuban sandwich, which I am very particular about. It came with a spicy au jus for dipping. It was one the best things I have tasted. I can say try anything here and it will be done right. 

And for the sports fan. They have more then enough TVs to cover any place you sit."}
{"text":"The wait staff was very courteous and attentive. They also gave us great recommendations for food and beverages on the menu. Personally I would recommend the kale Caesar with salmon"}
{"text":"I love this place. Vast menu of great food, incredible beer selection, great mixed drinks. Service was outstanding and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Las Vegas Yard House:
Great idea, poor execution
We sought out Yardhouse by their reputation for loads of beer choices and sports on TV.  Our waitress was great, but she was working with a flawed system.  Literally 50% + of the beers we asked to taste from the menu were unavailable:(

As a work-around my wife walked to the bar to taste then\"available\" beers, but alas she was never waited on in her 10 minutes at the bar.

We persisted...
We successfully ate appetizers and watched the TV basketball game of our choice on the closest TV, and drank the beer that was available.  

Overall great wait staff, poor mgmt and design of printing the beer menu.  One solution would be to adopt a set of chalkboards or beer screens behind the bar to show customers what beer is grueling available at any time, and avoid the false hopes of asking for some great beer only to be told it was out... a second time... a third time... a fourth time... and so on... and sooo on.. and so on."}
{"text":"Yard House is one of my favorite restaurants in Los Angeles so I was so excited to see it in Westlake just about a mile from where I live. There are a few appetizer dishes like the California roll (old style) I especially love and i love the honey blonde beer.  The lobster noodles are also super yummy.  The atmosphere is young and fun so if you are ready to party this is the place to go."}
{"text":"This was my first time, and I've always heard good things!  And I must say the food was great as well as the service.  Servers were very attentive and didn't allow much down time before checking back with us.  I had the vodka shrimp pasta with angel hair noodles.. I'm sure I set a record for eating it the fastest.  I also had their version of an old fashion, which was extremely tasty but kinda pricey. I definitely would have ordered another one if it were a little more reasonable.

Other than that I can see myself coming back here for a nice dinner.  Or watching some sports at their huge bar!"}
{"text":"We were invited to the soft opening of Yard House and we're excited to try it. My hubby and I had never been to one. They offered us each 2 free drinks and had servers delivering an endless array of dishes from their menu in bite size portions. 

Blackened sword fish taco - delicious with great flavor and a little spice

Shiitake mushroom pasta - great flavor and texture

Thai pizza - tastes exactly like what you would think. Amazing flavor and texture with peanuts, chicken, etc.

4 cheese pizza - which I would have had a full portion to taste the cheeses coming together.

Pepperoni and mushroom pizza - really good

BBQ chicken pizza - really good

Firecracker chicken wings - okay, a bit spicy for my liking

Burger - pretty tasty with cheddar and Swiss cheese and a salted bun

Gardein- their vegetarian \"chicken\". This was super tasty and caught me off guard. I honestly couldn't tell it wasn't chicken.

Spinach and artichoke dip - good, but just your average

Chicken and penne pasta - good

Chicken, pickle and pancake - seemed super odd, but was super tasty

This is definitely upscale bar food with a wide array of options of different cuisines.

We will be back!"}
{"text":"I decided to wait for mi amigas at the bar, so I waited...waited...and waited for the bartender to acknowledge me...and it wasn't even busy!  After a good 10 minutes, I finally got my drink and, at the same time, mi amigas showed up ready to eat.  As crowds started to pile in for dinner, my very bright red disco-light pager thing went off. We were seated in one of their very long booths, that can take forever to get out of if you're sitting by the wall.  We had the pleasure of having a waiter who was training a newbie (shadowing).  It's cool to train new staff, but it seemed like our \"veteran\" waiter had difficulty multi-tasking with serving, remembering small stuff, and training.  Other waiters were gracious enough to help out.  
 
The large selection of beers, happy hour, and the fact that it's located in the new Town Square mall, away from casinos, inspires me to come back.  My new favorites at YH are the mouth-freakin-watering Ahi dishes (ahi crunchy salad and seared ahi sashimi appetizer), lettuce wraps, and the lobster-crab-artichoke dip.  Mi amiga's grilled rib eye steak was not cooked to her specs, so she returned it.  Next thing you know, the general manager personally serves her a new rib eye steak done right...on the house.  Now that's the way to do it!"}
{"text":"Come here quite a bit, especially when I'm visiting friends. Love the outdoor seating here. Great beer menu (obviously) and everything I've tried with fish in it is fresh and delicious. I think that says a lot about the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Lately ive been huge into yard house. The pok stack is sooo godd as well as the spicy tuna roll. that was no exception at this location...food tasted good coming in. However, coming out diffrent story. I have thrown up both through my mouth and ass and i know that it was from this place. I wouldnt come here again beware"}
{"text":"I took my friend here for her birthday and we had a great time. When we walked in we were greeted very nicely and sat in a timely manner. Our waiter was very kind and prompt with drinks. I come here regularly due to the great service."}
{"text":"Really good food and one of if not the best selection of beer between here and the next closest Yard House.  The Happy Hour prices are even better."}
{"text":"We only popped in for a quick snack after doing some hiking.  It was my first time, but my boyfriend really likes their Seared Ahi Steak sandwich.  I didn't try it, but it's his usual, so it must be good for him to keep ordering it.  I had two varieties of their Street Tacos, Blacked Swordfish, and Baja Fish - I couldn't decide.  Both were outstanding!  It made me wish we weren't just there for a snack.  I would definitely go back to sample more of the menu.  Service was good as well."}
{"text":"Right from the very beginning, there were many loud cackling sounds coming from the bar. We could barely hear ourselves over the obnoxious noise, let alone each other. Our server caught us staring, as I asked if the bartender was drunk. Her response, \"our manager is in with her friends and she is just having fun with them.\"  They were disrupting the entire restaurant and at the expense of their own ignorance, did not notice the many people staring at them. The obnoxious behavior lasted our entire meal.  Thank you manager and bartender. 

On top of all that, the food was mediocre at best. My boyfriend and I have been up all night with stomach pains. Crap food + stomach pains = a ruined a date night.  Thank you manager, bartender, and chef."}
{"text":"Good food. Bad service. Took 45 minutes to place our order and another half an hour to get our food. Our server was MIA for the bulk of our time there. And making a pregnant woman wait for food is a no no. Not impressed. Service bypasses food quality for me."}
{"text":"The beer selection is good, but the real reason to come is the street tacos. Their ability to fuse the flavors rivals most taco establishments and with additional choices on the menu, everyone in your group will be happy. The only problem is the price is a bit higher than you would expect for the foods, but, good food sometimes comes at a price. Overall, great place."}
{"text":"Despite the recession.. this place was still packed to the gills yesterday (Thursday) night. The wait for a table was over an hour for 2, but luckily we were able to score a couple seats at the bar and just ended up eating there. 

Love the upscale sports bar vibe thing they have going on. Tons of TVs, great, varied menu, and obviously TONS of beer. 

The highlights:
*They offer 6 packs (6 shots) of beer where you can try mini portions of a few - that looked fun, I'll have to try it next time
*A sports bar with healthy food! HELL YEAH. 250 calories for their Crunchy Ahi Tuna salad. It was tasty and satisfying.. and guiltless ! I paired it with a light beer for a great dinner.. yum.
*as many have said - hot clientele! And from catching passing glances of the IDs flying around it appears most people are locals. 

** - 1 star for the sub par service. Even at the bar it was hard to get a beer."}
{"text":"Good food, very busy , way too noisy, decent service, prefer the Yard house at Town Square."}
{"text":"Had a great late lunch here with Andrew Jason, the happy hour specials are great, we enjoyed ahi tuna, chicken strips and calamari all of it was very tasty. Service was great, Emily was one of the best.
Also the selection of beer and cocktails will never disappoint anyone"}
{"text":"My friends and I often come to this location when we are hungry and wants to hang out.  The food is pretty good, it looks good, smells good and taste good, and feels good in the belly, but I have to say the portion size is not too big.  We never had to box anything up.  The staffs has always been friendly, and service has always been quick and prompt.  The atmosphere of this place is quite lively, and the restrooms had always been clean.  

Overall a good place to chill with friends and enjoy some food.  I'm sure we'll be back many more times in the future."}
{"text":"WHAT? I can't hear you!
Grace? Died 30 years ago!
Good luck conversing.

I don't review many chains, but I am going to take a stab on this one.  Been meaning to check out a Yard House ever since Josh A's glowing endorsement on the Talk boards awhile back.  102 tap beers sounded right up my alley.  Didn't think I had ever been to one before, but it was pointed out to me that I was at one in San Diego in the Gaslamp Quarter a couple years ago.  Remember really having liked it.  Probably would have gone 4 or 5.  Low 3 on today's visit.

The music was blaring loud this evening.  I'm sorry, but Matchbox 20 was not meant to be played that loud.  They are not even that good as background music.  I thought the waitress was going to kiss my mother on the lips as she was leaning in so close to hear the order.  Do they really think people like the music that loud?  Most of the customers were either parents with kids or gray-haired snowbirds.  No one was rocking out to it. 

Had two Uinta Hop Notch's which I have never seen anywhere else before.  Quite tasty.  The menu is very extensive both on beer and food.  Got the Mediterranean flatbread as an appetizer.  It was not good.  No sauce whatsoever, just toppings on crust.  Would have also been much better if the tomatoes were sun dried.  Would not get it again.

The blackened swordfish tacos were pretty good.  Little light on the fish, but excellent flavor with a healthy dose of guacamole.  I would definitely get these again.  Also had a couple bites of the Vodka Shrimp Pasta.  Think I will get that the next time I go when they open at West End in St. Louis Park.  Hopefully, they will use the volume dial on the music more prudently."}
{"text":"Just a few points about why this yard house is the best, from the 9 (my brothers, our sons and a son in-law to boot) of us who make our way from the Flamingo every time we pop into Vegas. The last paragraph is for all the guys who read these reviews.

First of all, this place is some what low key and pretty much draws the crowd who likes to drink a few really great brews (sorry gang, no 3' Eiffel Tower frozen slurppies here). The tap list is huge with over a hundred different beers of almost any style to choose. If by chance you would happen to be hungover (I'm not saying you would be but if) and not in the mood for a beer, you can get a fantastic bloody mary with a nice fat slab of candied bacon besides all the other garnish.

Then, the food. We've always had great food here! The menu is huge. The onion tower, cheese curds, queso dip for starters are all delicious! We've only eaten sandwiches and burgers here but have never had anything that wasn't delicious. Make sure you get the truffle fries as a side.

All of the bartenders and severs here are also friendly and know their beer. But, if you happen to get Chris, you've hit the jackpot! He's a great dude and he readily puts up with our crew of 9 and this has been for multiple trips! Always a pleasure Chris! Thanks from all of us.

Okay, lastly, and ladies you need to go no further unless you want to pass this to your significant other. The urinals in this place are the best!!! Let me explain. Firstly, there are like 8. The have high walls to keep the peepers at bay. You stand on a rubber mat! Who does that!? Then, inside the bowl itself, there is a mat, like a golf tee off mat. This is the genius part. There is no blow back!  No splashed knees, ankles, or shins! And, the whole time you're doing what you need to do, there is this minty fresh smell wafting through the air.Trust me guys. This will stick in your head if you stop!

So, if I could give this place an 6th star I would!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour, great sliders, great selection of beers and a variety of mixed drinks.  The sliders: bearnaise, Ahi tuna were great, even better at happy hour to keep the cost down.  
I also enjoyed the onion ring tower, but it is a huge amount of onion rings: share it wih someone.  Also the sliders come with fries and for a little more sweet potato fries....  If you are looking for a large plate of food, maybe you are having happy hour with a group of friends the chicken nachos will be enough for the whole group.
great seating outside, if the weather is fair.  Being centered at Westgate it is a great place to hang out with friends.  When its hot out I enjoy the booth seating here."}
{"text":"Been coming here for a long time and this visit was nothing special.  The pizza was undercooked the lobster dip was dry and over cooked. The only thing that was good was the beer."}
{"text":"I can't even begin to tell you how bad the service was! Our server literally walked up to the table, stared at us for a minute and then said drinks? Are u kidding me?!?! No hi, hello, nothing! It was a Monday night, and the place was half empty. He returned with beverages, and just stood there. To break the akward silence, I began to order for my parents and I. He never asked us how our food was, did we want refills, would we care for dessert!!!! I honestly don't know if he was high or just a terrible server. I of course didn't get a name, but he was about 5'9\" with dark hair and a full beard. We had tickets for the high roller, so we were too short on time for me to request a manager. We will never go back!"}
{"text":"Did you know that Yard House has a whole menu section for faux-meat? Well, they do - a fun fact that I learned the last time I went there for food not just drinks! Really, this place is quite veggie friendly!

The Pro's:
-- Extensive number of vegetarian options. My favorite was the onion rings....so good!
-- Extensive beer menu - they pretty much have anything you would want on draft or in bottles.
-- They have an all night Happy Hour for Monday Night Football. You really can't go wrong there
-- For serving a group of 16-20 people, they did a great job refilling drinks and getting our food out.
-- There is plenty of parking and other things going on in Desert Ridge. Great location.

The Con's:
-- This location can be loud...but that can be a plus too.
-- I didn't love my Veggie Spicy Chicken Sandwich. I'll have to try something else out.

I'll definitely be going back to the Yard House."}
{"text":"I really want to give this place a higher rating because I was looking forward to it so much! I've always heard only great things about this place but after stopping on Saturday, I'm torn. I really want to like it, I really want to give it 5 stars but I just can't. 

The reasons why I liked it is because of the atmosphere or options. The atmosphere is great, very open and a really like the decor inside. The bar is huge, though space can be very limited since this place is always packed. Their beer selection is unbelievable. I have never felt more overwhelmed by all of the beer selections. Their food was pretty good as well, we both had the lunch combo. I had the field salad which comes with balsamic dressing and a cup of their chicken tortilla soup. He had a pastrami sandwich with a cup of the chicken tortilla soup as well. 

Now the reason why I just don't feel right giving it 5 stars is because of the service. We sat at the bar and our bartender just seemed annoyed. We asked for her opinion on beers and she seemed pretty uninterested to help us. I mean there are about 3 pages of beers, give me some help girl! We both got a very weird vibe from her, like she didn't want to take care of us or that we were a burden. After we received our food, we ended up having to ask a different bartender for condiments because she wasn't around. 

All in all, I would try this place again and I just hope the service is better. We live right down the street and I really wanted this place to become our new go-to place. I won't rule it out for now, but if we continue to have the same type of service we might venture to other places."}
{"text":"A little expensive but the food is not as good as the price we maid.  Environment is very nice with patio sittings of your choice, with music."}
{"text":"Ask for crystal! She's an amazing server I had her two months after my first time eating at this location and she remembered my boyfriend and I and our drinks! Wow! She's such a doll! 

Crab cakes and calamari are amazing. The spicy jambalaya is mind blowing too!"}
{"text":"Popped by here for lunch recently. 

The place is absolutely huge... \"largest selection of beer on tap in the world, etc...\" 

I was presently surprised. The food was good. Had the Mac-n-Cheese with chicken, bacon and mushrooms... (it was loaded with mushrooms), and a club sandwich with avocado. The fries were thin and crispy with a light seasoning. Service was quick and friendly.

Didn't have a beer, but I intend to come back in the evening soon and give it a go..."}
{"text":"Food is good, you get your food fast also. Great environment. Also many beers to choose from."}
{"text":"luckily i had a gift card to use!  i usually have a great experience at yardhouse but this time not so much.  i ordered a blond (beer) and it didn't come out until my food came to the table.  i ordered the hummus and wedge salad.  the bread that come with hummus was super hard so i didn't really care for it.  loved the wedge salad and ate the whole thing.  altho the restaurant was mostly empty it was super loud inside.  don't think i'll be back to this yh."}
{"text":"The service started out good until 45 minutes into our lunch my colleague still had not received her entree which left her with 5 minutes to gobble down what she ordered. We asked the bartender about the missing order and she quickly went around the corner to see the food sitting there. I guess no one had notified her that it had arrived. Despite our lunch being overpriced and late it was still decent food. 

An hour later after we had departed I started to feel very sick and nauseous. At that time my colleague texted me and said she felt horrible and had been in the bathroom since she returned from lunch. Long story short I had to leave work early and go home because I am feeling absolutely terrible from what I ate.  I have been sick for almost a whole day now. I don't think I will be going back."}
{"text":"I've been here before and forgot to review it. I would have rated it probably a 2 at that point. That was probably due to the fact that we just stopped in for a beer or 2, sat at the bar and it was just so loud that we couldn't have an effective conversation about their beer offerings (there's a ton of them) with the bartenders. Beer drinking at a level this high usually involves people wanting to discuss it. #JustSayin

SHORT ANSWER; Service was par excellence, food was great and cooked as requested, beer list is mighty impressive and fresh tasting. Booths allow actual conversations to take place although the ambient volume level is still loud.

LONG VERSION: This time we stopped in for dinner about 5pm on a Saturday. It was still loud, but the place wasn't even 1/2 full so we were immediately seated at a nice booth in the back. Plenty of TVs showing sports. Our hostess was very polite and friendly, as was the girl who seated us. Our server \"Molly\" promptly came over to see if we wanted water and drinks. With an entire page of specialty cocktails, and 3 pages of beer to peruse - we asked for a minute and she went to retrieve 1 water for us as requested. Upon her return, we placed our order for a Sculpin and some chocolate porter that I don't recall the name of. After we chose our entrees and salads she scurried off to make that happen. The beers were fresh tasting and so was dinner. I opted for the pasta with shrimp, crab, and lobster. Pasta al dente, seafood not rubbery and very tasty.  GF's steak was cooked a perfect rare as ordered but her mashed were cold. We notified Molly and a minute later a manager came over and said he was immediately rectifying that situation and if he could do anything else, let him know. Excellent customer service, as hot, fresh potatoes arrived within 2 minutes much to GFs delight. As we pushed our salads to the table's edge a gentleman (didn't catch his name), stopped by to whisk them away at which time we asked for a dessert menu and he stopped to offer some ideas for desserts that would pair well with what we were imbibing or intending to imbibe. At that point, I had polished off the Ballast Point and moved onto Basil Hayden's which Molly told me I was the first person ever to ask her for and she was unfamiliar with it. Soon enough, our other delightful cocktail server was back with the BH.

As we finished up on our plates, Molly delightedly grabbed them and put them in some fancy to-go containers and bagged them up. We decided to go with our beer guy's recommended dessert and settled on some appropriate beers to pair with them. We paired up some Belgians that were weighing in at 11% and they went well with the chocolate banana creme brulee option. Good pairing by that guy. GF was driving, since it was my b-day so she only sipped some of hers, which was the case with her first one also, as it just wasn't as tasty as the name made it out to be although it was only like 4.7ABV.

By that time, there was a line out the door waiting for tables so we headed on out so that they could turn our table in the now maxed out dining room. I'd go back."}
{"text":"Forgot how affordable and how much I love this place.  Happy hour prices you can't beat"}
{"text":"To my surprise they handled my group of 12 people very well. The waiters and waitresses that assisted my group were on point with service. Although there were a few hiccups with a couple forgot items they made it up by apologizing while taking them off the receipt and still giving it to us with perfection. Thanks guys for a nice birthday dinner.

The poke stack, marinated raw ahi, crispy won-tons, avocado, wasabi soy sauce, was very enjoyable. The spices and textures balance with each bite.

The poke nachos, marinated raw ahi, avocado, cilantro, serranos, green onions, nori, sesame seeds, sweet soy, sriracha aïoli, white truffle sauce, crispy won tons is perfect for four people to share. The flavors are creamy, spicy, sweet, and zesty. 

Overall: Woohoo!"}
{"text":"It's about beer, food and service.  All were 5 stars.  Great IPAs,"}
{"text":"My friends and I were starving and looking forward to some serious grubbing. When we sat down we waited for almost 10 minutes to get greeted, when we finally were, the server walked up and just said \"do you want something to drink?\" Not so great of a start, it was shift change and we got caught in the middle of it. Got a new server, who was very nice, Amalie?? Anyways,  we ended up asking for a manager 30 minutes later because our food was taking over 30 minutes.  He was very polite, made the situation right, got our food out and everything was AWESOME.  Not a good start but things happen, not a big deal. Definitely appreciated the manager, didn't catch his name but everyone and the food were all excellent.  Highly recommend:)))"}

{"text":"This was my first time at Yard House. 
I have to say a great experience. Got seated quick, wasn't too crowded. The waitress was really nice and attentive. She was sweet and was even nice enough to take the picture. 
My food was delicious too, literally one of the best meals I've ever had. Definitely would go back again, no doubt!"}
{"text":"I've been to Yard house. It's a fun atmosphere here at this particular location at Westgate. Service is quick. I arrived at 5:30 on a weekend, probably in the midst of happy hour. I was told that I would have to wait a half hour to forty five minutes for a table. It was fifteen minutes. Nice job. Our waitress was fantastic and very attentive. I never had to ask for refills. The food came hot and very tasty. I had the turkey club sandwich and onion rings which were delicious. My friend had the lobster Mac which looked yummy. All and all a great during the week at a busy location."}
{"text":"YardHouse is the one positive about west gate. Food is pretty good. Great selection of drinks and beer. Staff is always very nice. Call me a regular here. There are better restaurants and there are better bars but this is a good mixture and is close to home."}
{"text":"Normally I love going to Yard House and would just stock up on appetizers but this time I decided to order an entree just to try it.

I ordered the \"SEARED SEA SCALLOPS\" which comes with a description of \"orzo pasta with wild mushrooms and white truffle sun-dried tomato sauce\".  Sounded great but was a disappointment when it arrived.

First off, you were given 4 scallops.  Two of which must have been bay scallops and two of which must have been the larger sea scallops.  So the first thing that you noticed was that you received 4 scallops which were not all of the same size but seems to have been cooked for the same amount of time.  Any one that has seared a scallop or eaten a perfectly seared scallop knows that you want a middle that is still slightly translucent.  The two smaller scallops were completely white and over cooked.  The sear on one side too much and the sear on the other side not enough.  With the two larger scallops, it was closer to a perfect sear.  However one scallop was falling apart (bad prep) and almost white on one side receiving no sear at all.

For the orzo pasta, the description indicated wild mushrooms.  I am a huge mushroom fan and love almost every kind that I've had the opportunity to try.  However, I feel that I (as well as most people) probably do not think of button mushrooms or shitake mushrooms as wild mushrooms.  

I know that most sun-dried tomatoes are kept in oil to keep them moist.  But when they were added to the sauce, far too much of the reserve oil was added to the sauce.  If I tilted my plate, bright red oil would be able to leak onto the table below.  It was a far to heavy sauce for such a tiny pasta as orzo.

Now I do realize that I am at Yard House and not a celebrity-chef named sea food restaurant, but I would have at least hoped that their entrées would have been as good as all of the appetizers that I've had.  That a chef there would still be able to provide equally sized scallops for one plate and that I would not receive overly greased pasta.

All in all, this will not detour me from returning to Yard House for some apps or a beer but it will detour me from ordering an entrée again."}

{"text":"I WISH we had a Yard House in the Bay Area!  It's soooo good!  First off, they have every kind of beer imaginable on tap.  Seriously, I think they hold a record for how many different kind of beers they have.  Don't let that sway you, this place isn't some local pub or anything.  

It has a really posh, sophisticated atmosphere.  The menu is BEST PART!  They have a range of things to order from your favorite kind of burgers and sandwiches to amazing asian/latin fusion dishes! Happy hours are a great time to come for apps and cheap drinks! Cheers!"}

{"text":"Usually very good. Tonight...not so much. Waitress is not attentive at all. Slow, ala mode apple/peach dessert was cold, twice. Had to order side order of veggie meat. Generous salad before, not tonight. Not a good experience. Usually a nice treat for me. Not tonight. Won't be doing this again for a while. Will look for the good waitress next time."}
{"text":"Came in during lunch and it wasn't busy at all. My friends and I ordered poke nachos three times because it was seriously that good. They added more poke than I ever had during my other times I ate here. Our server was nice and attentive, the only thing is, he mentioned that they don't usually give complimentary bread? I guess no one asks for them anymore or he just started? I swear, the town square location comes in clutch with the bread since they're busy most times I dine there. It's whatever though, he ended up giving us some anyway. The host/hostess were really welcoming and friendly. The place is always well-kept and clean, I guess I prefer this location for times I'm super hungry and since it's closer to school. I haven't been here in awhile for happy hour so I'd like to come in in the near future for that!"}
{"text":"Liked this place ALOT. Food was an excellent mix of old and new. Had the late night monte cristo pops which were neat and a good appetizer. Others had the onion ring tower and the sweet potato fries, all good.

For dinner we had a wide selection of dishes that all came back with positive reviews. I had the grilled pastrami sandwich with fries, which was good but could have used a mustard as it was a bit dry and lacked a kick. Wife had the coconut shrimp which she enjoyed. Others had the BBQ chicken pizza, fish and chips, blu cheese burger and the pastrami hot dog.

The real draw to the place is the beer selection, unbelievable. Ever selection of beer (except my favorite, sours) was well represented. 

Overall the food was really good, location was awesome, patio was great even on a chilly windy night. The food is really good for the price."}
{"text":"Met a friend here for lunch last Sunday. I decided on the BBQ Chicken Pizza (no onions), the lunch portion, with a side of French fries. When the food came out, there was a small amount of fries, but the server said he would bring me some fresh ones. They were OK, but of course the fresh ones were better, especially with some parmesan cheese sprinkled on top. The toppings on my pizza tasted good, but the crust seemed tougher than I remember. For dessert, we shared the S'mores Brownie. It was bigger than I expected and came out in one of those pizookie pans. And it was scorching hot! You really had to blow on the marshmallow so you didn't burn your mouth. It was a VERY sweet, sugary dessert. We only ate about half of it before calling it quits."}
{"text":"I was excited to celebrate with family here after a big event but was very disappointed with the zero vegan options. I was looking for a fun dinner experience with large menu diversity and many beers on tap. It seemed that yard house fit the bill. I glanced at the huge menu on line and figured I could find something to eat. I am a vegan but my entire family isn't so I wanted a big menu and I could make it work right a soup or a salad ? Nope I asked the waiter if they had any vegan options he told me \"we are not vegan friendly not even close\" I asked what about salad he stated no we make all our dressings in house none are vegan milk or cheese in everything  except what I ordered: 
I ordered Gardien orange chickn with vegetables and brown rice it was disgusting horrible sauce I took a nibble and sent it back it was so spicy and tasted nothing like orange sauce. Gross

Vegans be aware don't go here they don't want your business easier if you stay away they don't care


Sadly I had a beer and a few onion rings then  later found out the deep fryer is not vegan 


I won't return"}
{"text":"Not a good place to have a conversation because it's very loud. However the food was very good! I ordered a gardein thai noodle salad (small,  less than 600 calories!) and an ahi toke bowl (300ish calories), both were delicious. My only complaint is that they use a bit too much NaCl in their food.  Prepare to drink gallons of H2O when you go home."}
{"text":"The Yard House at Town Square is packed like sardines! I have always liked Yard House because they have an entire Gardein section (fake meat dishes) on their menu that I just go nuts for. I started hyperventilating the first time I went to Yard House. I always end up ordering the Spicy Chicken Gardein Sandwich, which runs me about $12-$13. For some weird reason the Spicy Chicken Sandwich is not on the menu but it is online. Regardless, the waiters know exactly what I'm talking about when I place my order. The portions are always overwhelming, which takes me to my happy place.  

The menu and beer section at Yard House is ridiculously huge. I think that's why Yard House is so popular - it's great for groups! The vibe at Yard House is great. People are buzzing and if you don't mind talking loud, you'll be fine. The dim lighting makes everyone prettier too lol. The prices sneak up on you though. It's one of those restaurants where you get the bill and you wonder how it got so high. Sneak attack!!"}
{"text":"This place is at desert ridge so literally you can spend
The day here with or without the kids . Also they have live music in the eves on weekends . Food here is good and all around pleaser for atmosphere food n drink and entertainment ."}
{"text":"My family and I had come to this location last night and the service was impeccable! Our waitress, Marz, was super helpful and overall did a great job. She had noticed that it was taking a while for our order to be done so she had notified her manager  Jenn. Jenn then came to our table and apologized for the wait and promised we would get our food very soon. Less than 2 minutes later our food showed up. Jenn and Marz then came over when we were done eating and offered us free dessert for the table! Extremely pleased with the great customer service we had received from both Jenn and Marz! Thank you guys! The food was also quite amazing! We had gotten the spinach dip, truffle fries, tacos, orange chicken, and the berry banana crumble and they were all to die for! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Went here for a quick bite and a beer before catching a movie. Requested to be seated outside, that was not a problem we were seated immediately and advised our server would be right with us. Ten minutes later a different server asked if we had been taken care of, we hadn't, so she proceeded to take our orders.Took another how many minutes or more to get water, got beer a few minutes later. Finally the food came and of course the order was wrong. Rather then send the food back and take another 20 minutes out of our lives we requested the check, ate what we could and left for a better experience at the movies. Maybe they were having an off night but I expected better."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place based on the recommendation of a friend as we were in town on business.

Location & Aesthetics - Located in Glendale off the 101 highway on W. Coyote Blvd.  The restaurant is nestled among other restaurants and there's plenty of signs for it.  You can dine inside or outside if you desire.  If dining outside, there's mister's when it's hot outside.  
There's lots of parking but it's not close to the restaurant.  There's small streets between the various restaurants and whatever parking spots they have usually full up quickly. 
The restaurant is large and immediately when entering, you're not only greeted by staff but in front of you are large screened TV's and a huge center bar with plenty of lights.
The place can get a bit noisy as we found it but it wasn't bad that we couldn't hear each other.

Menu - Their menu is large and can be intimidating as the first couple pages is reserved for their large variety of beer.  Seeing as we were new in town, we just wanted to try a softer drink and had to ask the waiter where those can be found on the menu.  The rest of the menu is straightforward and clear.  

Service - The staff was very friendly!

Food - I ordered the ribeye steak with mashed potatoes and green beans.  The beans tasted as they were just picked and they were verdantly green and crunchy and lighted buttered.  The mashed potatoes was equally tasty and delicious.  The ribeye was done just the way I asked and was soft, tender, well seasoned, and juicy.  I did however find that the food portions were on the small side (-1)

Rating - 4/5.  Definitely will worth coming back for the ambiance, atmosphere, their large variety of beer, and to try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorite restaurants in the Phoenix Metro area.  They play a steady stream of good music and there isn't a bad thing on the menu.  

The service has always been great.  Although a bit pricy, the atmosphere can't be beat. 

I can't say enough good things about this place."}
{"text":"No complaints.  Friendly staff.  Comfy environment.  Went during noon hour and didn't have to wait abnormally long for drinks or anything.  The mac n cheese is AMAZEBALLS.  It has chicken and bacon and is so tasty.  I am really picky about my mac and I couldn't have asked for better.  Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Had a good lunch. Great service at the bar - numerous bartenders making sure we were covered. Food was very good."}
{"text":"Been coming to yard house for years and it's always been great. There have been some inconsistencies but I'll get to that. My boyfriend and I always sit at the bar, they have the nicest bartenders at this location! Sometimes I'll order a beer or a martini. I LOVE their martinis.. BUT if you're going to charge as much as you do for them; buy a better strainer!! My martini always has a ridiculous amount of ice in them. Not just one cube but like 10 little mini half melted ice cubes so you cannot avoid chewing one every time you take a sip. I also love ordering the ahi sashimi. One of my top favorite things to eat in the entire world! It comes with a soy vinaigrette that I just want to bottle up and drizzle on everything. There are some inconsistencies here as well though. I think it depends on what part of the tuna I get when I order because the shape of the sashimi is sometimes really nicely cut and the perfect size and other times very jagged and somehow just doesn't taste the same. Maybe it's not as fresh and that's why it looks weird and tastes different? Anyways moving onnnn... I also order the chicken tofu lettuce wraps a lot! They taste wonderful and come with three different sauces for you to mix and match and find what combos you like best. Another inconsistency though is that the chicken and tofu normally come in a sort of crispy bread bowl that tasted so good as well but last time I ordered it they just put it into a normal bowl and I was kinda bummed.  but even after all that I keep coming back so I know they're doing something right! They've got pretty much any beer you could want and the service has always been great!"}
{"text":"Great beers on tap, their happy hour is ridiculously fun [with appetizers and drinks half off, hellooo] and their food alone is sooo good. Even the pizzas. 

Their service was EXCELLENT! I wanted a Bailey's milkshake for dessert, and the server was nice enough to make one up even though it wasnt on the menu. How sweet is that? Love it here!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.

The food portions are great, the staff is extremely helpful, and the prices are reasonable.  

There is a lot of space inside and outside for seating.  No cons at all.  Just great food and great service."}
{"text":"So yardhouse sent me a gift card for my awful experience and I appreciate that. This time around the food came out good and in a timely manner. Our waitress though was a little snobby but at least she did her job with a smile."}
{"text":"First time here, since I m from NYC and really impressed with food selection and craft beer selection.  I'm a big fan of drinking quality obscure IPA's you wouldn't find anywhere else and this place came through.   The food was also solid.  Service was friendly , quick , attentive.   Definitely a good spot for a good bar food and quality beers at a great price."}
{"text":"I usually come in twice a year.  Chain places have never been my thing (unless it's those Golden Arches and I need those fries).  
It's busy, but doesn't mean it's A+.  I've been seated in the patio, at a table inside or at the bar.  Service is always mediocre, as well as the food. 
That's all I can really write about it. It's simply just there. As for this location in Town Square, I gravitate more towards that whiskey place across the way:)"}
{"text":"First time eating here last night  and had one of the best experience. I loved everything from the beer, the food, the service(so so so) , and of course the company I was with. 
Can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"Wonderful meals. Great options if your vegiterian, and even if you're not!!!! Staff is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Beer Selection is insane.  Food very very good as well.  The only thing I can recommend is to get seasonal beers from small breweries and producers instead of large breweries."}
{"text":"Yard house is a very reliable choice if you are at Town Square. Town Square is one of the more popular malls off the strip in Vegas and it attracts both tourists and locals in roughly equal amounts with an abundance of shopping, entertainment, and restaurants. Of all of the restaurants I would say Yard House is the one I attend the most.

Environment:
The interior of the restaurant is rather large and spacious and you can expect that it will almost always be reasonably full. However despite the busy atmosphere I have rarely had to wait more than 10 minutes to be seated. They have both inside and outside creating as well as a rather large bar, however I usually opt to sit inside taking in account Vegas' weather. My only qualm with the interior would be the lighting which is very dim.

Food:
The menu can be considered as American but they do have influences from many different genres of food. Asian, Italian, and Latin influences can be found in the menu so you can enjoy sashimi, pasta, and tacos at your leisure. Some of my favorite dishes are:
Poke Stack: The cubes of Ahi tuna are very fresh and the sliced serrano peppers give it a nice spice.
Vodka Shrimp Pasta: Very creamy and flavorful with a hint of spice and good helping of shrimp.
Fried Calamari: I love calamari and whenever I get it here it is crispy without being overly breaded. They also include both the legs and the rings which I appreciate and a lot of lemon too.

The drinks are also good, whether it be their extensive beer menu, or my favorite cocktail, the Yuzu gin cooler.

Service:
Service is typically good, albeit a little slow. However due to the busy nature of the restaurant the waiters try their best to be attentive but they get some slack too.


Overall I would definitely recommend Yard House to anyone at Town Square, they are open late and have a great happy hour too!"}
{"text":"I give it three stars b/c after my last experience I don't think I want to go back. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the vegetarian options but what I don't love is finding bacon in them. Every time I went I ordered their Greek salad. It SO good - BUT, last time I ordered it I got a nice surprise, a bacon inside of it. I brought it to the waitresses attention and she replaced my salad. The manager came out and apologized. I figured they wouldn't charge me for it, but, they did. I just thought it was odd. Any other place I have gone to wouldn't have even charged me for it. I mean, am I wrong here? I don't know. If you go and you are vegetarian just look carefully! Otherwise it's a good restaurant."}
{"text":"Stopped in to Yard House for lunch recently. I had never heard of this place, but was pleasantly surprised with our meal. The service and food were excellent. I ordered two fish tacos and a beef taco and they were delicious.  I really liked them.  They were served with curry rice, which was also very delicious. I loved the meal and I would definitely eat here again.  Everyone else also enjoyed their meals.

It was lunch, so we didn't drink, but they had over 100 beers on tap, which I found impressive. There were quite a few wheat beers too, which I loved."}
{"text":"When I walked in the young lady with the short reddish hair at the desk was somewhat short. However, Joe took us back to our seats and he was so personable and made us feel welcomed! 
Then we met our absolutely wonderful waitperson BRE! She really made our evening memorable! Management you should consider yourselves fortunate to have someone as BRE waiting on your guest, she was welcoming, informative, knowledgeable most of all she had a contagious smile and Servive with grace. So what's not too love! The food was amazing the service superb! Thank you to BRE for making it all possible! We will be back!! Great new place for the Crocker Park Area!"}
{"text":"We have been here several times and have never been disappointed. The servers and service are always good. The variety and quality of the food is great. When it's busy it can take a little while to get your food but it is always great. It can be a little pricey depending on what you order but the quality is worth it."}
{"text":"Ok! this is my favorite spot ;-) I am not much of a clubber (obviously), so this is my spot when I'm in Vegas. How much better could it get?? All of those beers on tap, just make my mouth water. I make it a point to try a new beer (or two, or three) every time. In my short week stay in Vegas a few weeks ago, I went there quite a few times, and I'm not ashamed to say so. The bartenders were very sweet & talkative and always made sure my glass was full, there was a limited douche bag status (I didn't have any drunk a*holes falling on me, and spilling their beers on me), and I LOVE the music selection (I usually end up playing drunk air guitar, and mouthing the words at least once or twice). I just love this place, and I WILL be back ;-)"}
{"text":"Our last night in town for the Phoenix Comicon Fan Fest we decided to splurge a bit and go to the Yard House. We'd been eating on the cheap for most of the trip because when you go to a comic book convention you want to spend most of your money on silly crap you don't need, not food. But I'd been craving a good beer or two the whole time and the Yard House is a great place to go for that. 

This location is right in the upscale shopping area near the stadium. You know things aren't going to be cheap just by the decor. We had tried going here on Saturday night but there was a hockey game going on and it was absolutely packed. I can't imagine what it's going to be like for the Superbowl. Things looked busy on Sunday but we had no trouble getting seated right away. 

I got a burger and my girlfriend got some kind of chicken sandwich. The food is a bit pricey and a little on the greasy side but it is good. We also got chips and guacamole. The guacamole was freshly made which is always cool (until you make guacamole yourself and realize it's not exactly rocket science, then your appreciation for guacamole preparation goes down a bit) but they gave us a giant heap of the green stuff and seriously like a dozen tortilla chips. Yes, it was the cheapest appetizer on the menu but come on. They aren't made of gold. 

The main reason to go to the Yard House is the amazing beer selection and in that area they didn't let us down. My girlfriend got a shorty of cider and she said it was great. I wasn't driving so I got some porter with vanilla bean in it (I couldn't taste any vanilla but I liked it) and something that I think was called La Trappe Quadruple. I got it because I saw it on the lighted sign over the bar and it said it had 10 percent alcohol by volume. Yes, that is entirely the reason I ordered it because that is a crazy amount of alcohol for a beer. It was some kind of quadruple bock I think and if you've ever had them they don't really taste like beer at all. I don't know how to explain the taste. It's like if you could drink flowers made out of booze. I challenge anybody to drink more than one of those and not get alcohol poisoning. 

The Yard House is good and I'd give it three and a half stars if I could. Four stars for the beers but minus one for the overpriced bar food. All my reviews have been four stars so far so I've got to give something lower to balance things out. Sorry about that, Yard House."}
{"text":"We keep coming back.  Consistently good family environment.   And the food is great and priced right."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar with my husband on a Thursday night. We had drinks first, then dinner. Standout service. The bartenders, David, Jose, and Kyle were all very attentive. David even defended my seat while I was in the restroom. 
Food was good...my husband has the jambalaya with spicy rice. It's his favorite dish in PHX. I had the chopped salad with blackened chicken breast added. Very fresh, but a little heavy on the cilantro for me. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Yardhouse is where you go when your Americana family comes to visit and the wildest thing their tastebuds have encountered is ketchup. This restaurant is the middle ground. It's your safety choice. The food is OK. Sometimes your dish will be hot; sometimes it'll be on the warmer side.

I suspect there's a correlation between the perceived quality of food and the amount of drinks imbibed."}
{"text":"THis place has great beer to choose from and happy hour is great. I got the half yard glass with a free buzz at the end. It gets busy on the weekends so come in early."}
{"text":"I had the Nashville hot chicken and I would recommend this to anyone. It has a little kick to it and was delish! The potato pancake that comes with it was cold and and it didn't taste good to me. I didn't like the syrup for it either. Mom had the shiitake noodles and it was amazing! My niece got the deep fried Mac n cheese and she loved it. Huge portions for both being an appetizer. Dad had a veg. Burger and he liked it too. Will definitely come to this place again if I come back to Arizona."}
{"text":"I always have a great experience at Yard House. Nikki is an amazing server! Very bubbly and accommodating. I will definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Yardhouse has had some of the best fish and chips you could get anywhere, for probably a decade. 

They've apparently changed the sourcing on the fish, and changed the presentation.

I thought they had accidentally brought me the kids meal from Denny's.

The service is still pretty good. Two stars for that.

$16.75 for this new crap is way too much."}
{"text":"We show up with 9 coworkers to have dinner n drinks, the place was kind of empty, they wanted to split us up to 2 tables we said no, the reason is seat down and enjoy  with all my coworkers plus the our company was paying for the food n drinks, because is business trip, they told is was going be a over 30 minutes for a table when the place was kind empty we walked around and seen so many big tables empty, we we left and end up at Tilted Kilt pup & eatery we we're seat it right away we spend over 700 dollar your lost Yard house thank you to your manager for not handing a party of 9 the proper way."}
{"text":"Great food good atmosphere.  The service was very quick even though it's so busy.  Oh and the desert was three different things on a plate we all shared it so yummy.  I plan to go back soon."}
{"text":"Had great service and great food. I love that they give choices for vegans and  vegetarians. The patio was clean and perfect weather to fine outside."}
{"text":"This has always been a favorite restaurant of mine. I was looking forward to seeing the new Linq. It didn't disappoint. It's very dark in the restaurant. Something that I don't mind. The server was very nice and sweet. I ordered a side salad which was very good. It was big and could be shared. My friend ordered clam chowder and said it was excellent. I ordered a ham and pineapple pizza. It was very good. I love brick oven pizza. I was a little disappointed at the fact it was my birthday and they didn't give me as much as a cookie. The view from you table is awesome. You are right under the High Roller. I would recommend this restaurant. Just don't expect anything for your birthday."}
{"text":"Yard House is one of my favorite places to eat, drink, and relax.  The front desk and servers are always nice and friendly and provides excellent customer service which is as equally important than the food and drinks.  As a manager in the service industry, I take pride in not only ensuring my customers are treated well, but also my employees.  We are all human and make mistakes and as a manager I know I have the responsibility to hold my personnel accountable, but there is a time and a place to do so and in front of customers in never the time nor the place.  While dining, one of the managers was reprimanding one of the front desk persons for something done incorrectly.  I get that businesses strive for perfection but that incident was inappropriate and unprofessional.  I love coming to the Yard House and enjoy going to this location but if this ever occurs again when I am there I will take the time to go to the other one in Red Rock.  Please make sure this doesn't happen again and let me give you all the extra two stars!"}
{"text":"The place has so much potential. We walked over from the convention center to grab a late lunch. We were starving and ordered our food with the server. He was either new or just forgetful. We had to constantly had to grab other servers and managers for their attention. After placing our order, we waited almost an hour for our salads. The food was great either that or we were starving. I had an order of deviled eggs and it never came with our entree. We also specified to them to bring everything out as it done. They changed servers on us once the food came then I informed them about the deviled eggs, they said they were whipping them. Ok, it should take only a few minutes. 30 more minutes pass, we were done with our food and they said they were still working on it???? Just say you forgot to enter it in. Finally got them after we got the check. They were good just ridiculous how long it took."}
{"text":"I love the yard house they have my favorites on tap San Adams cherry wheat , our server was so helpful I forgot her name but she was a petite blonde extremely friendly, my boyfriend got a bar sting on our walk on the strip and I read honey was good home remedy so she got us honey for his finger. We ordered the chicken quesadilla it was really goodand filling,for being a saturday on the strip it was great we didn't have to wait for a seat . It was a great Start to our bar hopping saturday."}
{"text":"The service at the this particular yard house was exceptional! Ryan our server was professional, attentive, genuine, and had extensive knowledge of the menu! He is friendly and courteous....he made some key suggestions about the selections! He completely nailed it! Thank you so much Ryan for helping us tonight and for making our experience so great!"}
{"text":"I had a bad experience with Chelsea (asian ), one of the girls by the reception. She just kept rolling her eyes at the customers. It's like she hates what she's doing.  She needs to have customer service training!"}
{"text":"We discovered this place when we drove over to see how the Margaritaville Glendale construction was going. What a sweet find! First impression is that it's so comfortable and inviting looking! There is great seating on the outside patio with really comfortable chairs, and the seating inside is also very comfortable. You notice the many, MANY, tap handles that circumvent the bar! I tried the Lost Coast Great White specifically because of the very cool tap handle! I was not disappointed! The music playing is awesome and really sets the atmosphere. How I wish there was a Yard House in the East Valley as it would be a great place to meet with friends on a very regular basis. The food-WOW FACTOR OF 10. I have the same thing when I eat there as it is unbelievably good! The Jerk Chicken with Shrimp Stack. Such delectable mouth watering goodness!!! The waitstaff have always been so friendly. We haven't had long waits any of the times we've been there."}
{"text":"Had dinner here a few days ago.  Food was excellent and decently priced.  The beer selection is always great and the atmosphere was very mellow.  Dim lighting was nicely done."}
{"text":"Recent visit to The Linq, we ate here a couple times.  I had the mushroom pepperoni pizza the 1st visit and the Penne Chicken the 2nd time.  My Husband had the Lobster Garlic Noodles both times, absolutely LOVED the food.  Will definitely eat here again!!"}
{"text":"As a Town Square employee.... and even fellow bartender.... we come here very often when all the other spots are closed. Late nights often take us to Miller's or Yard House. Unfortunately, there aren't many good* experiences we have at Yard House. Bartenders aren't very hospitable here, we rarely have an experience worth coming for. Kat is literally the only warm bartender we enjoy who has ever been nice to us and not waited like 10 minutes to greet us.... even just give us coasters + acknowledge us! I hate being so quick to judge when in the industry, but when MORE THAN 3 strikes have been given because \"we understand\".... no, that's just unacceptable. Especially when, and don't take it as we're cheap by any means, we're paying about $11/cocktail-- that's an awful lot for cheap service. We'd so much rather go to Miller's for a $4 drink and get better attentive service.... especially from those you KNOOOW are going to take care of you. Many people tell us that the staff at Yard House comes across as awfully snooty and as if they're \"the shit\"-- alas, I understand their point of view. Too bad they have freakin good food and late night happy hour haha we will still come, it's just a matter of what kind of service we're in the mood for and if the food is worth that kind of service haha. Food, Yard House will always win. Drinks, meeeehh.... can't get a friendly bartender here =/"}
{"text":"This is my first review so I'll probably keep this fairly short.

The Yardhouse is my favorite restaurant/bar for trying different drinks so far. I've only been 21 for five months but haven't found a single bar yet that has a selection quite like them.

The pints aren't usually an excellent price, but the diversity of drinks is too good to pass up. The service is good 3/5 times I am there. Last time I was there I was with a large party and the waitress never came back with my drink order. Another waitress came to take my order and she didn't show up either. Finally someone came and delivered my drink after a half hour. By this time most my party was ready to head into the movie theatre across the way and was only able to drink one beer. 

Like I said, the service is usually great, but they can get swamped and forget about you.  Unless there's a huge sporting event on they're always willing to change the channel for you to a different sporting event. If you go a little later when the bar isn't swamped the bar tenders are all really chill and will tell you if a beer isn't really that good. 
The food is average quality. Nothing to go raging to your friends about. The streaky service and decent food is what kept me from giving it five stars."}
{"text":"yard house, I love it.  never had a bad meal, service always on point and the vibe in the restaurant is full of energy.  always clean and never too long of a wait.  in love with their lamb burger and truffle fries.  lamb is cooked to medium and it is melt in your mouth tender.  fries are super crisp, hot and salty from the parmesan."}
{"text":"Decent tasting food, with the exception of the fries, that arrived lukewarm, it was the music that ruined our evening.  Early dining on a Wednesday and the only person you could talk with was the person sitting right next to you.  If you were sitting in a booth and were the farthest from the server, you could not hear what they were saying.....and when I mentioned to him I could not hear anything he said because of the music AND pointed to the speakers, he just smiled.  I'm assuming he could not hear me either.  I guess if you are eating alone and enjoy LOUD music, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come to YardHouse in Town Square every now and then and we REALLY enjoy Derrick (G) service. He's always SO happy to be there and ensures we have a great time. He recognizes our faces when we come in and we always have a good laugh. We've started to request him as a server. It's servers like this that keep people coming back to locations. Thank you YardHouse for ensuring  your employees are HAPPY. Customer service starts from the inside out. Almost every interaction we've had with employees here has been a good one. Cheers to good business."}
{"text":"Awesome service, awesome food, this place has renewed my faith in the franchise. We will be visiting more YardHouses because of this experience..."}
{"text":"Happy Hour is the best! Great food, great service, nice ambiance, clean atmosphere. We will always be back here when in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Ever have such a horrible experience somewhere that you think.... Hmmmm... Is this a hidden camera show? Yep, me too. Except I wasn't, it was just a really bad experience at the Yard House. 

I wish I could give it zero stars. Our waitress was named Amanda. Not only did she not bring us our drinks, she described the food as Panda Express-like (gross, I don't eat there), and she also never brought us our food. Instead, she rang in our order and had it delivered to the vegan table next to us. When our food finally arrived, BOTH OF OUR DISHES HAD HAIR IN IT. And my boyfriends order was wrong. And Amanda didn't bring us our food either. She actually only took our order. Then she never said a word when she dropped off the check, or when she picked it up. I was mortified at the whole experience. Please, DON'T eat here. We also mentioned to the manager on the way out how terrible the service was, and he just mumbled an apology. Oh, and we told him this while he was outside smoking. This was just a TERRIBLE experience!!!!"}
{"text":"We had lunch before the hockey game service was good our server Ciara went the extra mile to ensure we got out in time to get the the arena.
  The food was good overall one of the better places to dine before attending a game."}
{"text":"First and LAST time I'll ever go to Yard House

I went on a Monday night around 7:45 pm, the wait wasn't bad 10-15 minutes or so. The restaurant also wasn't super busy and our host even said that this was nothing compared to weekends. Our server was a woman who as she was taking our drink orders, said she was leaving and bringing another guy over to take care of us because she was being cut. That's fine and they said they were slow so i understood. The drinks were extremely syrupy and flat so I switched to water. The guy server was probably the least interactive and slowest waiter I've ever had. He was polite but we wouldn't see him for 10-15 minutes at a time. We had to flag him down for refills or sugar for tea. My table ordered spinach and artichoke dip as an appetizer and we were thrown off by the plate. It was like 10 pita chips with Parmesan cheese on the chips with a bowl of warm spinach. I felt like I was eating straight up soggy greens. I ordered the grilled chicken avocado sandwich and a cup of tortilla soup. The soup was good but the sandwich was incredibly plain, messy, and tasted charred. I only at about 1/3 of the sandwich and didn't bother taking the left overs home. My friends got burgers and a French dip, they said it was alright but definitely not worth $13-$17.  It took ages to get our checks. I've never paid $40 bucks for a messy sandwich, water, and dip before so I was really annoyed at the price considering the taste and service, but whatever. I didn't have the exact amount so I paid with larger bills expecting my change back. The server came back and didn't even acknowledge me and only handed my friends their check because they paid with card. I felt too awkward to ask for my change back. I had planned on tipping him the standard percentage which would've been more than what he kept. I thought it was rude that he didn't bother asking but i didn't wanna cause a scene. I felt like if I was an older posh woman he wouldn't have been so hasty with the service. I didn't feel welcome from the get go and I definitely didn't feel good leaving. 


Bleh food, poor service, weird music, fix your soda carbonation."}
{"text":"Our group of eight had to wait quite awhile to get in because of it being a Coyotes game night (Go Jets!), but it was really worth the wait. I had the Chicken rice bowl which was good, and probably healthy, but after seeing some of the other plates, I wished I would have picked differently!  The fish and chips were delicious with crispy, tasty fries and lots of battered fish. The French dip was reportedly very tasty with those same crispy fries and the penne with chicken also got a firm thumbs up. There are lots of choices on the menu, an extensive drink list and the waitress was friendly and efficient. Great choice!"}
{"text":"Great food for the price. Just off The Strip. I have been here before and will be back. Large selection of craft beer (I had the Octoberfest today, very hoppy). After a full day of shopping we wanted comfort food. So both my wife and I ordered burgers. They were cooked to perfection. We had a side of fries that were julienned so they carried a lot of flavour and were extremely crispy. Can't wait to go back. Next time I am not driving so I can sample a couple of different beers."}
{"text":"Another \"GREAT NIGHT\".

In my D.j Khaled voice \"anotha one\" one of our favorite family restaurants to go to. Packed as usual we had to wait for about 20 minutes but it was worth it!

Our service at the yard house is always great,
Our food and our servers did a great job also. 
we ordered appetizers first I got boneless buffalo hot wings .

The wife got calamari and blue crab cakes of course it all came on time and was very good!

Now for the main course:

NY STEAK SANDWICH- comes with swiss, fried onions, tomatoes, garlic aioli and brioche of course I got nothing but Swiss and the aioli on the side aka (naked). 
The wife got hers with everything.

PIZZA- the kids got pepperoni pizza they destroyed it and ate some of our food too! 

OVERALL the food was great! We will continue to visit the yard house to celebrate or just to enjoy the happy hour as long as we can.

I'm very pickey when it comes to food but this is definitely a place that I keep in my line up when it comes to a solid menu."}
{"text":"Get the Brussels sprouts!  So many beers on tap and great service. Will be back next time I am in Vegas"}
{"text":"Don't know how many times I passed this restaurant by as a (relatively new) local, but no more!  I went here with a friend recently, and the experience was - for the most part - great.  Being a vegetarian, it's always awesome to find an entire portion of a menu devoted to vegan- or vegetarian-friendly items; but Gardein??  Love love love.  I got a Gardein chicken sandwich, and it was delicious.

The only problem with our order was with my friend's sandwich.  She has a sulfur allergy, and requested one of the toppings be held from her order; though the waiter Did, in fact, input the order correctly, there was a miscommunication somewhere and the offending ingredient wasn't removed.  She realized it as soon as she bit into it, so not much harm done, but if it were a life or death allergy, this would've been serious.  They remade the sandwich for her, and both our waiter and the manager came by to personally apologize for the incorrect (and in this case, hazardous) order.  Though, of course, we would've preferred the order be correct to start with, we're just glad the situation was rectified.  The service we received made up for the error.

I definitely plan on returning to try more of the wondrous vegetarian and vegan options.  If you're on the Strip looking for good options as a healthy eater, this is the place!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times since I first went in December, and I've enjoyed it every single time.  I love love LOVE the vegetarian options available here.  I've been to their other locations in town, but this one has the added benefit of not being on the Strip, and it's closer to where I live.  The service is always great, and the food is always delicious.  I've tried different things on the menu, and can vouch for everything I've tried.  I've never had one of my friends not enjoy what they had, either.  This will be a frequent haunt, and I'll be sure to bring people (vegetarian or otherwise) back to enjoy one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place is a lot like your local BJ's, with more beer and crappier food. I only give this place such a favorable rating because they've got a beer for everyone and they've got it on draft. Holla."}
{"text":"Great bar-opt to sit outside on the promenade if you can. 

Menu is extensive-it is almost too hard to narrow it down!

Great place to go in between shopping, movies, or before or after a game or shopping at the outlet mall nearby."}
{"text":"I have to agree with another reviewer that this place is great for one reason: beer on tap. The food is classic bar food but dressed fancier. However, it wasn't as flavorful and exciting as expected. It ended up being our most expensive dinner in Vegas with only ordering one burger, one sandwich, and a pint of pineapple cider. The price doesn't quite match quality. Biggest plus was the garlic fries (shoestring) and cider, otherwise it was okay. Our server James was very nice."}
{"text":"Loved our server Jake tonight! He was super funny and gave me some tips on how to be a good server since I'm training to be one soon! Food was amazing and came out fast so we could catch our movie right after!!"}
{"text":"Love Yardhouse. Been to the one in Honolulu and San Jose as well. This restaurant is dark and loud but what can you expect with a restaurant full of TV's with NFL or NBA games on. I always get the Poke Nachos and Chicken Wings. Also, happy hour is where it's at. The deals are . I have also tried a few of their pizzas and they're pretty good as well. This is my go to restaurant when I'm in the area.. great place for big parties!"}
{"text":"Went in tonight with a couple of friends to find it very packed. The wait was only like 15-20 minutes, so we signed in. After we're seated, they took our drink orders and we placed an app of spicy edamame. They weren't as flavorful as we would have hoped but they noticed we were kind of picking at it and came back with a flavor packed order. Super yum. Our drinks were strong and the gossip flowed. The atmosphere is always nice and lively. Our food came and plates were nicely portioned and cooked correctly. My steak sandwich was so good. The brioche bread was soft and the meat cooked medium. The sweet potato fries we're crisp and not greasy. Everyone was satisfied with their orders and we were happy to at yard house. Regulars for sure!"}
{"text":"First off, busy Saturday, 6 guests, sat us in 5 minutes. Second off, our server Janine was a pleasure!

ok to the not fun part.  $30something dollar Lobster Mac and Cheese, well the lobster was a very chewy and had more an off fish taste than lobster. The Mac and cheese was so over oiled, it became a match of keep it down or throw it up later into the night. It came back up. This was only 6 bites or so of the dinner. The rest is in the fridge for my roommate today.

The fish and chips. The breading tasted like cardboard, the fish tasted stale. I feel like malt and tabasco are the only thing that helped me get this down. I don't drink so there was no masking the crap quality of what I was eating. I gladly shared with the table so I didn't have to eat it or complain on a 2nd dish of food we ordered.

Brussels sprouts and potato, well they got this right... you can't really messed up quick frying with a dash of salt.

Aside from the horrible food a glass of house wine is $16. Was not fun to see our table not knowing had ordered 6 total glasses of wine. $96 on wine at a chain place known for beer?  anyway. mistake was made, this place can have your hard earned $. Won't be getting any more of mine. There are tooooo many way better places in town for way less $.

Over all... this will be a happy hour visit from now on. As you don't feel like you wasted $96 on cheap wine, $60+ on food for a bad taste in your mouth and a puke later in the night."}
{"text":"We ate at The Yard House at our last visit to Vegas and it was very good good service good food good beer one of our better meals there no complaints we shared a couple different variety of wings between a few of us and somebody got the Teriyaki rice chicken bowl so it was very good definitely go back there my next visit"}
{"text":"Ate there Thursday nite.   Jade, our waitress was so attentive.   Food good.  A bit noisy."}
{"text":"Ok, Yard House...I guess it's supposed to be upscale. Supposed to have a bunch of beers. And I'm sure it's both, but unfortunately, my one visit (so far) wasn't to pick a \"high-end\" chain or to partake in alcohol. Maybe, when I have a DD and when I have some a little more well-off than, well, me paying the tab.

This is not to say this wasn't a good place, it's just that I might not have the best view of what it's supposedly known for. Regardless, I will do my best with what I observed.

I met a old college buddy that I haven't seen in 16-17 years - hey now, I'm really not that old - and while at Westgate, I blindly picked this place, not knowing ANYTHING about it. We had a blast. The waitress was wonderful - she let us sit there for practically 3 hours chatting, or catching up, that is. Granted it was a Monday night, football night and the restaurant was 80% empty. Still, I appreciate someone not pushing me out the door - like when I do, in fact, have too many beers. :-)

I digress, we both had iced tea and they apparently have multiple varieties. I'm a non-conservative old-fashioned mate who simply must stick with regular tea. In addition, I ordered a pizza. Very affordable and equally delicious.

I'm not a big eater, and even the 10\" pie looked too much to not ask for a doggie bag, or Styrofoam container. Patting myself on the back, I finished it and it was great. Just plain old pep and mush...remember: old-fashioned.

The ambience was nice, big bar, the staff well dressed, mannered and polite. It's a little pricey, but I haven't tried what requires an AMEX Black card yet. I'd recommend it, if you happen to be at Westgate and have some generous buddies or (OTHER.)"}
{"text":"The floorboard under my table was loose, almost causing me to fall. Several tables have removable floorboards, so be careful. The food was really good, and they have half-price deals before 6pm. I recommend the jambalaya with spicy rice, and the carnivore pizza."}
{"text":"Consistent taste every location you go; Five star service in every scenario, especially if you have any dissatisfaction with your order; Speedy and non stop services. Strongly recommend the ahi crunch salad and truffle fries to start."}
{"text":"My family and I recently moved to Phoenix and Desert Ridge has become our spot for fun and shopping.  My kids love Yard House, so we've been here a few times.  The menu is is huge, but tonight, our server, Shay, was SO helpful and described all of the items that we asked about and never got frustrated with all of our questions!  My kids can be very picky, but she talked to them like their satisfaction was just as important as ours.  By the end of our meal, they wanted to move in with her!  The filet was cooked perfectly and the fish was very fresh.  Shay brought the kids ice cream sundae's and convinced us that we needed to try the three mini desserts, and she was right!  - we go out to eat often, but the service we got here was the very best I can remember having anywhere. There was a family at the table beside us and they seemed to get the same level of attention as we did.  I'm excited to come back during happy hour, now that we know about the half priced appetizers!!  Everything came out hot and fast and our drink glasses were never empty.  The only time our kids were disappointed was when they found out that Shay couldn't go to the movies with us! We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, food and service ... Kinda loud but nothing unbearable would recommend to others."}
{"text":"Was invited to this place by a friend of mine and I enjoyed it a lot. Now, I am not much of a beer drinker, but this place carried some of the most diverse drink menus I have ever seen. Not only did they have a large selection of conventional beers, but they also carry rare flavors such as honey tangerine, blueberry brew and chocolate... all of which were tasty and refreshing. Don't know much about beer? Have no fear! Their staff seemed welcoming to all our questions and recommended some great beers based on what our preferences were. 

After having a few cold ones you can enjoy some of their awesome appetizers. We got the chicken nachos and they were delicious and their portions were huge. I will definitely return to this place next time I am in the mood to hang out with friends and get drinks."}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING!! Tre? was our server, and he was great, personable, and knowledgeable. Go here when he is working!!"}
{"text":"4 stars is for the food alone. Between ordering sliders (pastrami, burger, ahi), orange chicken, chicken nachos, sweet potato & truffle fries, coconut shrimp, ahi salad, and jambalaya, I have never gone wrong. Service rates between fair and good. Always appears clean."}
{"text":"love that they have a whole section of Gardein foods.  the Gardein buffalo wings and BBQ chicken pizza were so good.  service was great as well!"}
{"text":"Great place to have veggie bar food!!
Lots of beer options.

I am not sure how the none veggie food is but any place serving so many options for vegetarians is my kind of place."}
{"text":"Yeah, I know...why would we go to Vegas and eat at a chain restaurant, right?  Because it was in our hotel and we were starrrrrving, that's why!  

We found 4 seats at the bar and ordered food and drinks.  The pomegranate martinis were excellent and my ahi salad was delicious.  The service was quick and friendly, but the only slight \"quirk\" was the fact that they made us run a tab and closed it out after each round.  And they made us pay for our food as soon as we ordered, like before it even came to the table.  I think my friend and her husband ended up doing 3 separate transactions, one round of drinks of her credit card, cash for their food and another round charged to their room.  

It's a busy, busy place and there was a bit of a wait for a table, which is why we chose the bar, but I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Well the food is pretty great for bar food, the menu is extensive. The beers? Incredible. I never know what to order for beer and the waitress always makes an incredible reccomendation. The fact that you can't make reservations on weekends really makes me mad though. I had a party of 15 and they couldn't do anything for me on a Friday night when I called the day before. Really? Seems a little rediculous."}
{"text":"Thanks to another review we tried the Poke Nachos and they were delicious. The combination of the ahi, avocado and jalapeño was delightfully balanced. Perfectly paired with the Rose from Spain which not sweet but accompanied them beautifully. We are regulars to the Yard House at home and when we travel but had never tried the nachos before. We will be having them again!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  The toughest thing to do here is pick a beer and food.  Everything is so good!  Thankfully the bartender was knowledgeable and had some great suggestions!"}
{"text":"This is a quality chain restaurant with something for everyone. While by no means would I refer to it as a culinary experience when trying to please a group it is a good default. They have a wide variety of beers on top, a solid wine list and obviously cocktails since it is a full bar. They have a range of foods from classic American burgers to poke and have good vegetarian menu options. I have had the vegan burger here 3 times now and would definitively recommend it."}
{"text":"Came here on Monday after a previously rough experience a few weeks back and we had a great time. Hope, the manager came to talk to us and made sure all of our items were up to their high standards. The service is always great every time we have been. This time I tried the chicken nachos they were quite large and had a good flavor but I love beans so next time I'm gonna ask for more! Had some deliciousness called a Sonrise sangria yumm!the cheese  curds are fantastic but definitely wait on them if they tell you they need more time you'll be much happier with the taste."}
{"text":"Thumbs up to the Yard House! We had reservations for a party of 12, which they lost? However they took excellent care of us and quickly put a table together, outside on the patio; which was fine as the weather is beautiful out. The servers were outstanding! So all in all they scored big points!! Thank you Yard House...we were the Miller Party of 12 Wednesday night 2/12/14"}
{"text":"This was my first time at the Yard House.  My friends always go and like it but I was really disappointed.  I had a bowl of the French onion soup, a baba fish taco and a beef short rib taco.  The soup was okay but the tacos were awful.  The family liked the fried calamari appetizer but the lobster, artichoke dip was not good.  We also had the chicken penne pasta and the Vodka shrimp pasta.  Not great.  The best thing the whole night was the Moscow mule!  Definitely get one of those.  I won't come back for the food but the drink was really, really good!!  My son ordered a Shirley Temple and didn't drink it.  Too sweet.  Try some where else.  The food here is not memorable or even worth the money."}
{"text":"Great food, decent prices for the food you pay and in the heart of Town Square. Definitely busy so you may be waiting a while for your food. Had to change seats at the patio because sun was shinning directly in our faces and the blind retractor for our area was broken and wouldnt come down. Minor issue not a big deal. Surprisingly, it was kid friendly and they have kid menu/activity pamphlet with crayons. Overall happy with this place."}
{"text":"When I'm hot, I just want a cold beer. No wine. No liquor. Just beer. That's what Yard House will get you. This place must have at least 100 beers on tap. The selection was overwhelming!  I really wish I had ordered a flight instead of a yard. 

They have food here too.  The fake chicken app we shared (two friends are vegan) would have fooled me. It tasted like chicken and even had the same consistency. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality. 

Service was well coordinated. We had multiple bartenders checking up on us.  Usually, multiple servers means slow service but that was not the case here."}
{"text":"I never really enjoyed their food at any yard house I have been to.  

We went on a busy friday night, so we expected to wait at least an hour (which we did). 

Ratings: (out of five)

Food (3): We ordered two different taco and a shiitake garlic noodles.  The tacos were good, but not worth the $2 something price tag that comes along with it. The garlic noodles were okay, sometimes I just feel like I am eating noodles with lots of garlic powder on it. 

Service (4): Our server was friendly and she kept checking up on us.  It was a very busy night and I believe there was a party of over sixty people that they had. But she was always there and constantly making sure everything was good.

Atmosphere (3.5): Just down to earth and very laid-back.  

Overall (3):  I never been impressed with yardhouse, but I do like their selection of different beers that they have and they do have a variety of food selection.  However, each time I ordered something different, it never taste any good.  If anyone can recommend me something that they love at yardhouse, I would love to try it! :)"}
{"text":"The food was amazing in here, same for the cocktails. Went here twice in three days... service was pretty good and the food didn't take too long either to come out either."}
{"text":"Boy is Yard House pricey. Good thing for the invention of happy hour. They hold theirs Monday through Friday from 4pm-6pm. My group got there at 4:45 and racked up most of the damage before HH ended, but the last few items boosted the check up by a third. 

The well drinks run for four dollars and change, while the beers cost around four to six dollars. All the appetizers are half off and a great deal. If you are like me, a few of them makes for a better meal than any entree. 

We got the chicken nachos, fried chicken strips, seared ahi, classic sliders, hummus, a pepperoni and mushroom pizza, and chicken wings. If you come during the designated time, then all of these except the hummus are half off. It is a great deal, but I would reconsider if it was at full price. They are generous with their portions. Both the sliders and chicken strips come in an order of four with fries. This was perfect because it matched the number of people at our table. Both dishes would be worth it at the regular price. The ahi tuna was cooked nicely, but the sauce was too salty. It definitely did not need soy sauce, but I used up all the wasabi. The chicken nachos were nothing special. It is a generous portion, but the salsa looked more like marinara, the chicken was on the dry side, and the guacamole lacked the tang and spice. They were also bountiful with the wings. Asking for them to be cooked extra crispy and having the sauce on the side guarantees for perfect wings. The hummus was packed with sodium and tasted a little bitter. The pizza came out quick, bubbling, and beautiful. Too bad, I was too full by that time, but my friend liked it.  

If you ever wanted to try a new beer, but afraid you might not like it, come for happy hour. At worst, you are out a few dollars. At best, you might meet your new best friend. 

Another thing worth mentioning, the staff were on their game tonight. It was not that busy, but our server was awesome. Crystal was funny, sassy, and full of energy. 

The only reason why I gave them three stars is because I worry about the amount of salt they use in all of their dishes. I know people complain about MSG at Chinese restaurant, but I drank five glasses of water while dining and am still guzzling it now. It was tasty, but my taste buds are on over drive and going nuts."}
{"text":"I've been to the Town Square location lots of times. And love it!
This was my second visit to the Red Rock location. It's much quieter, doesn't look like a party is going on like the Town Square Yard House.
Both restaurants have friendly staff, great atmosphere and a plethora of drinks to be had.
My favorite dish is the Miso Glazed Sea Bass. I got it on both visits to The Red Rock locale, the first time it was perfect...this time it was smaller and a bit dry, don't know if it was an off day for them or if their quality has dropped. I'll know next time I go which one is the case. So I'm giving them a pass this time.
My husbands favorite is the Pepper Crusted Filet,(I don't blame him, it is delish) this time it was a little dry also.
My mom got the Caesar Salad and Clam Chowder...both were average, nothing special about either.
No complaints about the drinks though..."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Yard House, it's one of those place you can go and you know you'll eat good food.
I always seem to get the Sea Bass or the Pepper Crusted Filet...both are delicious.
We were adventurous, and just wanted a small bite so we got the New York Steak Sandwich, it was so good...I just wish the steak was sliced on the roll after cooking to make eating easier. I wasn't fond of the sweet potato fries, they were missing something. I also tried the clam chowder, it was okay.
Drinks are great, whether you get beer or cocktails.
Staff is always good."}
{"text":"I don't like to be a pain in the ass vegetarian, so I rarely will oppose a restaurant suggestion because of my meat-free diet. If my omnivorous friends want to go to a steak house, I always know I can- at the very least- enjoy a salad or french fries. 

The Yard House was suggested for a business meeting, so I agreed, not expecting too much and just hoping their fries were good.

I was pleasantly surprised by the \"summer salad\" option on the menu, and it did not disappoint! It was one of the most flavorful, delicious salads I'd ever had. We also all split a desert- and the Peach and Apple cobbler is ridiculously good, too.

I never had to ask for a refill of my iced tea, and our adorable server was in a really good mood. 

Overall, I was impressed with this place and am looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of this place!! The only thing is the price could be better.."}
{"text":"I really like Yard House in general, and this location is no different. However, I wish they took reservations! Well, maybe they do but when I called an hour before arrival they were unable to put our name in for the quoted 30-40 minute wait. But luckily when we arrived we didn't have to wait for a table when coming in for a late dinner. I had a delicious turkey burger with sweet potato fries and they both really hit the spot. I washed that down with a couple pints of Guinness and it was a great meal! Our server Zachary was excellent, super knowledgeable and friendly. Another great experience at Yard House."}
{"text":"Beer flights are awesome and a great deal. Happy hour is great. Most of the food is very good, more low calorie options would be very helpful though. I usually order and like the Hawaiian Tuna Poke Stack, so tonight I tried the Spicy Tuna \"Roll\" but that was underwhelming. Having a few Sangrias on the menu would be another suggestion. Also a discount for Las Vegas locals."}
{"text":"Good burgers, cold Beer!  Awesome time and the service was good too!

The only thing missing, REDDS Apple Ale!"}
{"text":"Nice central location on LINQ Lane. Great selection of beer in bottles and on tap. The crispy ahi tuna salad was fantastic! Servers are very friendly & well versed on the menu items."}
{"text":"Not sure what's more embarrassing: the fact that the other day before going to see the Master at rave (two thumbs up!) that I spent $120 on dinner for 2 at Yard House, or the fact that I thought it was worth every penny.  This is not to say that the average opinion on the Yardhouse is low, but I do think it's typically thought of as a place to grab some cheap happy hour appetizers and some beer and not a place to spend $30 on entrees.  Well I did that, and I was damn happy with the results.

We arrived shortly before happy hour ended and I started with a Black and Tan and we also ordered the seared Ahi Sashimi appetizer which I was pleasantly surprised to find half off on the happy hour menu (which also discounted the price on the beer a bit).   I've had the Ahi appetizer here several times and it's almost always a winner.  I'll venture to say it's the best of it's kind among chain restaurants.  For entrees my dining partner got the Pepper crusted Filet Mignon and I ordered the Ginger Crusted Norwegian Salmon.   Both were accompanied with Wasabi mashed potatoes which I've always enjoyed for that slight hint of wasabi in every bite.  My salmon was a little masked with all the toppings (namely carrot strings, the ginger crust, and the sesame vinaigrette).   Usually I would find this to be a negative, but I''ll be damned if all of the ingredients really work together here.  I've been known to sneak a bite of the salmon on it's own from time to time anyhow and found it to be nicely cooked.

The one issue with the entire meal was the filet which was ordered medium was a little inconsistently cooked.  Some of it seemed cooked Medium well (little to no pink) while some of it did seem cooked as ordered.  I was able to taste a little of both sections and found them both tasty, though the one with some pink was more to my liking.  

Service was great throughout and we ordered several jack and cokes once happy hour ended and they were constantly being refreshed.  When we informed the waitress we had a movie to make she made sure to bring the check to us quickly.  When the check first arrived I was slightly taken aback by the price (and the amount of alcohol we'd consumed), but realized it had been worth it.  It also made me appreciate that I could go into the Yardhouse and make a choice on whether to have a great $30 experience of a couple of drinks, an onion ring tower and a sandwich, or go all out and have a great steak or piece of fish for extra.  You can't do that (or much of anything else) at Applebee's folks!  

Later on in the theater while everyone else was fleeing for the exit midway through, we sat content.  I initially blamed this on poor movie taste by the others, but in retrospect perhaps it was the contentedness of the meal beforehand that transferred over to our cinema experience."}
{"text":"The Yard house has been a primary meeting location for me around the valley.  I'm not sure why?  As I'm writing and revising I realize why.  All locations have prime real estate at malls - so there is immediate availability for pre and post activities.  This Scottsdale establishment has the best location I think.  

Blackened Swordfish Taco and Baja Fish Tacos I recall being decent.  However, I have sent back a seafood entre plate (Phoenix) - I don't think its on the menu anymore, had a bad shrimp appetizer (Scottsdale) and some of the Tacos weren't that great for me (Glendale).  Burgers are ok.  I have eaten here a lot and really nothing amazing unfortunately?  Hmmm.  Your taste may be completely different than mine.  So this is not a great food review for the Yard...

Its been a good meeting place.  I'm not reviewing the drinks though I've spent many hours at the bar with company.  Bartenders have been decent, food service has been decent.  Some people really seem to like the drink selection.  Ladies have told me this is not a good date place - so just a heads up on that lol."}
{"text":"Yard house was great! Our appetizer was the queso with bacon chorizo (i love chorizo) For my entree I had the baja street tacos with rice and beans....nice spicy kick! The rice was mehh and Service was great!!They have over 100+ different beers I'm not a beer drinker but tried the Lindemans and it was great!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the first places I ate at when I moved to Vegas and it still reigns as one of my favorites! When going out to eat in Vegas with there being so many options it's rare that I go to the same place more than once, especially being new and wanting to explore. But I crave this place so I keep going back (to the one in Red Rock or the 2nd location in the Quad) It has a cool bar vibe with tons of beer options, which is where I was introduced to my new favorite, Leinikugal (however you spell it) Sunset Wheat - it tastes like Fruit Loops! The wait staff has consistently been friendly and the menu is as big as a book...and that's my only complaint, narrowing it down to what I want to order feels like trying to make a life altering decision. Ok it's not that dramatic, but I do have to keep going back to try all the different things on the menu that made me salivate just reading. The food tastes like fine dining quality, without the stuffy restaurant ambiance. I can't sing this place's praises enough and hope I get a coupon or something for this heart felt review, cause I still have about 20 menu items I need to try  :)"}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere of yard house but the food isn't amazing.  It's more on the vegetarian/vegan side, not basic american staples like you'd expect from a brewhouse.  They didn't have american cheese, odd.  There are tons of beer options, but the food options seem strange to me.  I'd suggest sitting outside, it seems nicer out there and less crowded."}
{"text":"The one star is only for our waitress and that's only because she didn't make us wait long for our check. I ordered the lobster artichoke dip I would say it was nasty but i couldn't taste anything! No crab no lobster no artichoke it was tasteless with chunks of cream cheese at the bottom. My husband ordered the crab cakes the sauce was amazing but the crab cakes were overdone and tasted like my moms salmon croquet patties. The spicy shrimp jambalaya was also tasteless with big chunks of red and green bell peppers that was very crunchy. My husband said his burger was average. I would say you get what you pay for but Forget that I spent $80 bucks on trash should've listened to my husband and went to Flavors of Louisiana. This place is trash!"}
{"text":"I usually try not to hit too many chains in Vegas but it was the day of the 5k and we needed lunch ASAP. For a chain this is about as good as it gets, lunch was tasty and served fast even though the place was packed and were a pretty large group. The BBQ chicken salad is worth a try and even the small size was plenty of food. I didn't try any this visit but they have a huge beer selection and happy hour specials that seem worth checking out."}
{"text":"I have to say that I frequent this place for at least one happy hour a week. My favorite beer of choice is the 'blend' Rose Gaarden. It is bright red and tastes like a full-bodied fruity beer. The half price apps are a marvelous deal! The crab cakes are delightful, a little bit heavier than I prefer, yet tasty nonetheless. The spicy tuna roll is my standby because it is consistently delicious. It is a deconstructed roll of course and it's enough for 2 to share. Another favorite is the Chinese garlic noodles. It's egg noodles sauteed with garlic, butter and shitaake mushrooms, YUM! The poke stack is also delectable. They also honor the lunch specials until 5pm. I tried the lunch portion of the mac and cheese, as it came highly recommended by a friend of mine. I found it to be too heavy. The flavors weren't bad, it just left me feeling like I had a bowling ball in my belly. I think the mix of the chicken and the mushrooms and the cream sauce are just too much.
 
The atmosphere is loud here, as it is a bar. The outside dining on the high tops is much more reticent. The weather in the afternoons lately has made it a perfect spot to nosh and enjoy a beer."}
{"text":"First time trying the creme brûlée here and it is delicious. Always friendly servers. Definitely worth the wait times and definitely a bargain if you come during happy hour! 

I have been to this restaurant several times, and have tried various entrees on the menu in multiple locations. If you want to play it safe come during happy hour for pizza and wings.

Only give it a 4/5 because some of the items on the menu I've tried tasted weird. The Mexican food items are on the more \"modern side\" and some of the other entrees I've tried either weren't cooked properly or were bland.

I always come back and try something new. I don't have a favorite entree. I would say I mostly come here for the vibes. The ambiance and music is very laid back and this is a chill place to drink. Furthermore, this place will always have my business."}
{"text":"Came in with some friends Monday night. Place was super cool and waitress was awesome. We were very loud and I'm sure annoying as we were there to watch and bet on football so they were great. Food is always great at YardHouse! Beer and food is cheap during happy hour. Would highly recommend"}
{"text":"Had dinner and drinks at Yard House in Townsquare last night. Heard nothing but great reviews on this place! It did not disappoint!! Our waitress Nancy was the sweetest! We were celebrating my sisters birthday and she surprised her with a birthday dessert!! The drinks were great (el picante was my fave), the food was even better!! Thanks for an unforgettable night!! We'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Happy. Hour. Poke. Nachos. 

That's all you need to know. Go for happy hour (3pm-6pm) and order the poke nachos. They are AMAZING. Anything off their menu, honestly, is delicious. They have a great selection for their happy hour menu as well as alcoholic beverages (obviously)! 

The staff is great, I haven't had a bad experience yet. The only thing bringing them down a star is the ambiance, I guess you can say. It's definitely on the darker and louder side, but I can't complain too much since they have TVs around the restaurant playing any game you can think of. 

But other than that, the food is great, the staff is great! I highly recommend going here!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing! Our server, brandy was out standing! Leo, the manager on duty, was very attentive and quite helpful in helping us choose a menu item. I highly recommend this place! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Yard house doesn't like to be called a sports bar because it's really a quality restaurant that happens to have TVs everywhere for game watching. Service is always top notch, the food is very good, the beer is cold, and the game is on. I come here every time I visit."}
{"text":"Being from New York, we don't have Yard House so my family will go there when we find one on vacations. This is the first time we went to this location and we had great service and great food. We started off with the onion ring tower and lobster,crab, and artichoke dip. Both were great and  we were happy they gave chips and pita with the dip. We then shared the mac n cheese with chicken (no bacon) and the miso sea bass. We were very cautious because Phoenix isn't exactly near water, and asked our waitress, Brooklin, if the fish was fresh. She assured us it comes in every morning. We wound up loving it. It was cooked to perfection and it had amazing flavor so we were happy we got the dish. The mac n cheese was also amazing and I would recommend either. Let's not forget the beer! They have many different options for anyone's palette. We all wound up getting flights to try a bunch. We also indulged in the dessert trio which was banana crème brûlée, peach apple cobbler, and a chocolate soufflé cake. It was all delicious and barely even mini. Great bang for your buck. Brooklin was an amazing server, and since my family is from Brooklyn we hit it off from the start! Highly recommended for anyone!"}
{"text":"I cane here for dinner. I'm from Chicago, so wanted to try something local ! This place was nice ! Our staff, holly, was wonderful and gave great recommendations. I got the onion ring tower and chicken rice bowl. Both were fantastic. I ate outside and it was a cute little set up outside being able to watch all the people walking around the mall area. Come check this place out and give Holly a holler!"}
{"text":"I went with a few coworkers for happy hour (3- 6pm) and will definitely be back.  I got the grapefruit IPA ($5) and the margarita pizza ($6) with marinara dipping sauce.  The sundried tomatoes and roasted garlic on the pizza were phenomenal!  We sat at the bar and the bar tenders were very nice to chat with.  Shout out to Zach!"}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of the Yard House, and was happy to see that one had opened up in the new Linq area in Vegas.  If you haven't been to one before, it's a great place to have a drink and watch a game.  As a bonus, they have really good food as well.  The staple of most Yard House restaurants seems to be a large bar in the center of the restaurant, with what appears to be a zillion beers on tap.  

Most Yard House locations are huge, and this one is no exception.  My wife and I decided to come here on a weekday for lunch since she had some gift cards.  The restaurant wasn't too busy, but more and more people seemed to be coming in throughout our meal.  They have a big menu, so you shouldn't have any trouble finding something you want.  They have anything from a burger to a steak or nice piece of fish.  I ordered a BBQ Chicken Pizza, while my wife ordered a fancy version of mac-n-cheese.  We both agreed that our meals were very good, and that we would definitely come here again.  We received good service throughout our meal, despite our server taking a break and passing us to a different server for part of our meal.

I know there are a lot of choices when it comes to eating out in Vegas, but don't hesitate to give Yard House a shot if you're looking for a casual, more affordable meal."}
{"text":"I try to not review in fits of anger but, I am so pissed!  Took a group of four here after a movie and it was a disaster!  Unfortunately, no amount of beer can ever make up for such a crappy dining experience.  Waiter kept touching all of us in that overly friendly/concerned relative sort of way.  Food not cooked properly.  Food dropped by wait staff.  Manager bait and switch.  Not fixing the bill.  So bad I considered a dine and dash.  Decided to bitch to corporate and cancel my card transaction instead.  Beware, chains don't give a crap about the customer!  I will remember to spend my money at small private restaurants with good health ratings.

...By way of follow up.  Corporate did contact me.  Through Yelp only as their complaint section of their website does not work.  Good luck if you have a bad experience there.
-------
June 17th follow up:  Decided to finally give them a second try.  Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me.  The experience may have actually been worse.  Just skip this place and go spend your money at one of the 10 other places nearby.  Big deal they have the hockey game on.  Bet that if you asked the bartender at Gordon Biersch to change the channel the would.  Also, at least they know what is going on over there."}
{"text":"Good selection of beer. The food is ok. I'm not crazy about the asian/hybrid cuisine but everyone I know loves it, so maybe it's just me. I work at westgate...the sandwich lunch specials are good."}
{"text":"The food here is really good! I had the Hawaiian five o, which was really good :) definitely get the tuna roll! Yum! 

The service however wasn't very good. We had Olivia. She had 5 tables and we only got her attention ever 1/2 hour or so. We were at the restaurant for about 2 hours for a friends b-day party. But it isn't even her fault that I am giving the service a negative review. It is the fact that we had 3 servers walk by while we raised our hands and tried to speak with them to get there attention. These servers only serve their section. That's it. The only one we were able to get her attention was the training lead. Unacceptable. 

Hopefully this was a one time fluke..."}
{"text":"Really good food and an awesome selection of beer. Especially like that they carry Deschutes brews.  Could be 5 stars but its noisy and they suggestive sell way too hard.  I would still go back."}
{"text":"Good happy hour and great section of beer. Chicken nachos and their pastrami burger is awesome."}
{"text":"This restaurant was huge! Two stories! Suprisingly still had to wait for a table but not too long. Menu had a great variety of options, same with their beer and alcohol selection as well. Modern/contemporary environment. House Cocktails were way too expensive though. Some cost near what my entree did!"}
{"text":"Celebrated a birthday for the second time at this location in the last two months and find it to be mediocre to say the least. 

Cold fries with a side of dry pastrami sandwich on a stale bread.

Flavorless drinks and a hair in our Mac and cheese. Sure you take it off the bill but how can I forget the hair? How do I continue to celebrate on an empty stomach, Since you didn't offer me another meal option?

Service was lacking genuine interest because the staff was busy discussing their Sunday football tickets. Parlay this and buy points on that... Thanks for the pointers but can I get my drink refilled and these empty plates off the crowded table?! 

Wouldn't rush to go back any time soon. My suggestion is try another restaurant in town square."}
{"text":"Especially considering the other gut bombs like McFadden's, this place is unbelievable.  Great beer.  Great food quality.  Price is fair. Great atmosphere
Good tap list
Sound and ambiance as well"}
{"text":"I think this is my first 1 star review. I usually wouldnt leave 1 star, but this visit was the worst Ive ever had.

Ive been to this yard house a bunch of times in the past few years as well as many other yard houses in the southwest. Ive never been so dissapointed before. I usually get the bernaise sliders but this time i wanted to try something new. I tried the monte cristo but it wasnt good at all here. im surprised its even on the menu. We got a few other things and it was just okay.

Service wasnt the greatest, it was very slow, but the real reason this place gets a 1 star is because of the manager. I was meeting a few friends there. 1 of them was there when i arrived and we got the table, the other came in a bit and we all ordered. The last person was just coming to meet up and she arrived either close to closing time or maybe a little bit after closing. But we were still eating. She wasnt going to eat or anything, just meet up with us and hang out till we were done. My friend went to get her and the manager came up to us and said something like, you cant do that, we're closed. We told him that she wasnt ordering anything and that she was just meeting with us until we were done eating. He said a few other words and while im eating this horrible monte cristo im thinking, are you serious right now?? Shes not ordering anything, we are all together, we are gonna finish up eating and then we are all leaving together. Does he expect her to just sit outside and wait for us?? I would NEVER expect this at all from any restaurant and the worst is that it came from a manager. Yard House should send this guy to a customer service class. Not sure if i'll return but hopefully that manager learns how to not piss off his customers."}
{"text":"I will admit I was slightly skeptical of this place before we arrived since it wasn't on my list. First, it was right next to the LINQ Ferris wheel that mimics the London Eye and I had no clue there was an entire boardwalk and shopping area right there. SO cute and might be my new favorite part of Vegas.

The restaurant is at the end of the boardwalk and you can see everyone loading and unloading onto the LINQ. So it's pretty close. They have outside seating which is my first choice in a sit down, but majority rules and we sat inside. But the balcony was so nice and has a great view.

I ordered the Tacos which came with a side of rice and refrigerate beans. I devoured my Baja Fish Taco. It was SO good and I recommend everyone tries it. I also got the pork Taco with grilled pineapple and it was also very delicious. He portions were big and I was completely full from my platter. The refried beans were in a small soup dish and were baked with a layer of cheese on top. I've never had them this way and now I will be sad if I don't in the future. 

Highly recommend for parties and lots of different opinions. They have a large menu and can accommodate any appetite."}
{"text":"I was SUPER excited to find out they had Gardein products, but only the burger is vegan. That's no problem because it's DELICIOUS. Everyone's really friendly here, too."}
{"text":"Brendan behind the bar is awesome!  Slow Sunday or busy Sunday this guy rocks it! He is full of knowledge for the menu as well as the surplus of beers. He is friendly, and all around provides great service. The French dip, sweet potato fries  ( with the maple bacon dipping sauce) and french onion soup is all amazing...Thank you for the enjoyable dinner!"}
{"text":"Second time here, after a Sunday evening at the movies, decided to return to Yard House for dinner. I had the blonde house Ale and that came fast and cold! I was thirsty and this hit the spot. 

For an app, we had had the onion ring tower once before and my husband ordered it again. It was just like our previous version, just fried onion rings served with dipping sauce, it was just okay. 

I wanted to try the french onion soup and I could add that to my pastrami sandwich. The soup was really good, served with deep rich flavors of the beef broth and onions all covered with melted cheese and under cover, the french baguette bread. Very good soup. 

My pastrami sandwich was served with pickle and fries and had a fair amount of meat. It was served on fresh bread and was a decent size, my husband had ordered the seared tuna sandwich and we decided to trade off, he took half mine and I took half his. I do have to admit, my pastrami was better. The tuna was lightly seared and seemed fresh, but I like my tuna sashimi style without any bread! 

We did enjoy the meal, however, I guess it's not an impressive place for eating. Since their focus is on the over 100 beers served, this is more of a drinking place."}
{"text":"BEST experience I've had in a while. Awesome service (thanks Duane!), awesome beer selection, and awesome food. We'll definitely be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"It was decent. Love all the selections of different beer but the food wasn't that great and the fries were cold when they served them. Probably won't go back because it's overpriced and wasn't that good. The waitress was kind of rude too. Reason why they are getting 2 stars is because at least they had a lot of beer selections"}
{"text":"Manager was great! Very accommodating with the dog and that really made the difference"}
{"text":"Great Lunch or Casual Dinner Spot

Great Service
Good Food
Great Value
Awesome selection of beers.
We have taken friends and family from out of town here and everyone has enjoyed it.
what more props could you give a place!"}
{"text":"I will always love the Yard House. Each time I have been here I have had a great experience. I have been here multiple times, all with my family and this place cannot get any better. They take reservations which is great on busy nights! The place is huge and there is tons of seating inside and outside. The staff is all super nice friendly and helpful. The menu is huge and everything I have had here is so good. The prices are fair for the large meal portions you get. It can get loud and is a little dark inside at night but besides that I have nothing bad to say about this place!"}
{"text":"I love Yard House! We got here a little after opening on a Tuesday and were given the choice of indoor seating or outdoors either on their downstairs covered patio or uncovered patio upstairs. We almost chose the covered patio but the tables there looked better suited for having drinks rather than full meals. Sitting upstairs was out of the question since it was over 100 degrees that day! So inside we sat which was fine as most of their seating is booth seating, which I prefer. Very spacious booths at that :)

Our server if I recall correctly was Rosa. She provided awesome customer service - friendly, courteous, and attentive. I got my usual - small (but filling) portion of Mac and cheese without chicken. Delicious! I had a couple bites of my dining companion's ahi tuna salad and it was quite good! We had to end our meal with their salted caramel butterscotch pudding. It's soooo good we each got our own this time. Very reminiscent of the shakes at Gordon Ramsay Burgr which are topped with the most delicious butterscotch pudding.

Excellent meal, awesome service, comfy booth seating, nice ambiance - quiet since it was just after opening on a Tuesday but plenty to keep myself entertained. They've got plenty of tv's of course, and we were seated by windows looking out to The Linq so there was people-watching for my entertainment. I really like the layout of this location too - booth seating surrounding a long bar in the middle of the restaurant.

To sum it up, Yard House, you're (more than) all right with me :)"}
{"text":"Five stars mainly because of our awesome server (so bummed I forgot her name!) and their amazing salted caramel butterscotch pudding!!  Our server was so sweet and friendly and paid us just the right amount of attention during our meal.  Then there's their pudding -oh my goodness their pudding!  I'd have to say it's the second yummiest thing I've ever eaten, only behind the salty caramel macaron ice cream sandwich from Ginger Elizabeth in Sacramento.  I shared the pudding with someone on this particular visit but not next time! :p  If you are a caramel lover like I am get that dessert for sure!  For my entree I ordered their mac and cheese which you can't go wrong with.  I love that they now have a smaller less expensive portion of the mac and cheese which I still found to be quite a bit of food!  I've enjoyed drinks and other entrees at a Yard House back home in Northern California and I think it's safe to say that their food is consistently good from one location to the next.  I definitely enjoyed my meal here and our server made the experience that much better!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and excellent food!!!  Had the chicken penne and loved every bit of it!  Came in to watch college football and have some drinks and food and it was a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"I'm a bit torn as to how to review Yard House. The food was delicious, the atmosphere upbeat, and the staff was really friendly. We came on a Thursday evening (730-ish) and there was no wait for a table inside (nice!). We were seated and we requested to watch a specific channel (NBA playoffs were on) and they were very accommodating (even changed the channel for us). We placed our appetizer order and got our food fairly quickly. The poke bowl and the garlic noodles from the snack menu were divine!!! We ordered our meal and waited almost an hour... Still no food. The waiter came by and apologized and said he would check on it. Took another 15 minutes for the food to come. Given we were there to watch the playoff game, it really wasn't that big of a deal. The manager came by (very nice) and apologized and said she would give us dessert on the house (awesome!). So we placed our dessert order and waited. Another 30 minutes passed and still no dessert! To sum it up, there was a glitch in the system and the kitchen wasn't receiving orders coming in from our table! Oddly enough, it was only our table that was falling through the cracks in the system (although it was weird that we got our snacks in a timely manner).

The food was delicious though and the prices were just right (especially for being on the strip). The staff was very nice and did apologize profusely. The manager comped a few more items off our bill in addition to the desserts we ordered. But I can tell you, if it wasn't for the playoff game, I would have raised more of a stink. I guess it worked out... We saw the entire game (yes we were there for three full hours) and we got some other items off our bill comped. Although if I was the manager, I would have comped the entire meal (it's all about customer service) and who knows what will end up on Yelp, right? :)

As for the food, the onion rings were great, sweet potato fries cooked just right, although a nice aioli sauce would have been a nice accompaniment. Steak sandwich was delish... The dessert looks good, but was a bit disappointing. We ordered the s'mores brownie and the trio. None were impressive so I would probably save room for dessert and head outside for Ghiradelli or Sprinkles."}
{"text":"I've only been to the yardhouse when I lived in Hawaii and I have to say this one is pretty amazing too! 
One of my girlfriends was having her birthday and she wanted to go to a coyote game, however, we started the night at Yardhouse. I have to say this, their Mac N Cheese was BOMB! I don't think I've ever tasted anything that good in awhile. I am definitely going back for it. And the mixed drinks were hella good too. 
BTW, the vegetarian menu is to die for. You wouldn't even know half the stuff was vegetarian."}
{"text":"Decent quality food but overpriced. Duck wings were average. New York strip sandwich was nothing special considering the $ 18.75 price tag. Although I don't drink beer, I was impressed by their incredible selection of beer on tap. Menu is huge and probably has something for everyone. However, I don't feel that this is the place for me."}
{"text":"this place is too good. i always fall in love with restaurants that offer tons of options because let's face it, we all have days where we find ourselves being picky.

this was my second time dining here in vegas, and the first time did not spark anything for me and i cannot tell you why but this time i fell in love. the menu is huge, you can find anything to eat for the pickiest eater. they have plenty of appetizers from wings to dips to onion rings (which are delicious by the way). we chose the crab and artichoke dip, it was so good and had so much fresh crab in it!

i spent almost 30 mins trying to figure out what i wanted because everything sounded so good. they have nashville hot chicken which is all of the rage these days. my fiancé ordered that as his entree and it was the best i had ever tasted. perfect amount of heat, and the sweet potato pancakes add the perfect touch. i chose the southern fried chicken and i was in heaven. the chicken was seasoned perfectly and the spinach mashed potatoes were buttery and smooth.

not to mention our waitress was totally patient with how much time i was taking to order, and i was so grateful for that! she was also open to explaining the menu and the best items they had on the menu. i seriously wish we had one of these in michigan!"}
{"text":"Visited this location the other day and had horrible service. Normally this place gives pretty good service, considering it's in a touristy spot, but Saturday just wasn't their day. When we arrived at 6:30ish we were told that inside seating would be a 20 minute wait for two people, but outdoor seating was open immediately. We opted for outdoor seating since it wasn't too hot. And this would had been fine if it hadn't taken our waiter 15 minutes just to bring us water. Once we finally ordered, the wait staff seemed to not be communicating with the hostess. First, we kept getting all the food that the table to the left of us was ordering. Then, the table to the right of us was getting our food. It was super frustrating because the table kept accepting our food, and I had to tell the waiter it wasn't theirs - which was awkward. After we finally got our correct food, our service was slow and subpar. I went inside to use the bathroom and there was a hoard of waiters just standing around talking, and I had to say excuse me multiple times to get by. I was really upset and sweaty since our water kept going unfilled and we were seated outside. The people behind us got their water, but we did not. At one point I'm pretty sure we could have walked out without paying because we got no attention from our waiter. I'll be visiting a different location from now on, until this one gets better."}
{"text":"Service was good, food was good, my Nashville hot chicken sandwich with not so Nashville or even hot for that matter. I'd definitely go back but I'd order something different. My girlfriend always orders the gardeen chicken sandwich with avocado she hardly can put it down once they bring it to the table."}
{"text":"I'm pretty anti-chain, but Yard House has avoided my chain restaurant black-list. They have a wide variety of food and beers on their menu. I had been with friends several times and hadn't found any dish that stood out, then I went with one friend who suggested the turkey burger.... Jackpot! Turkey burgers can sometimes be kind of bland wannabe burgers. Not this one at Yard House. It's seasoned really well and comes with a delicious roasted tomato, melty mozzarella cheese and garlic aioli. I don't even particularly like tomatoes or mayonaise-based products, but this burger is delicious! 

Yard House has a little something for everyone on their drink menu. They serve Lindeman's Framboise (a total girly-beer), somewhat of a rare find at restaurants, so it's a special treat to go have a glass."}
{"text":"Never a good choice.  Always feel Too rush and pushy.  The food is good but the atmosphere is soo negative change."}
{"text":"This restaurant is toward the top of my Vegas restaurant list. It has some pretty good food that is hard to find in Vegas. 

We got the fried calamari and the poke nachos to start. The calamari was pretty good, but the poke nachos were amazing. As our entrees we got the [Mac + Cheese]^2 along with the vampire taco and the blackened white fish taco. The mac and cheese was very disappointing. The tacos on the other hand were very good. 

Everyone else loved their meals. I was impressed overall by this restaurant and would come back again."}
{"text":"Always a solid choice to hang out here. Came here with a group of buddies to watch a game and enjoy some grub and beers. What I really enjoy about YH is the consistency in the establishment other than the host staff it's a great experience.

 Beers are always on point with a great selection although they could put some more thought into them and use some local Vegas breweries versus the mainstream and it would add more local flair to the place.

 Food is always decent but never great at least you know what you're getting when you go here. I had ordered truffle fries (no truffle oil flavor rather tasted like old dirty fryer oil) and a chicken and avocado sandwich (menu nor the waitress lacked to inform me that it was a bland purée of avocado. I would have preferred just sliced if avocado and called it a day) which lacked any integrity in making such a simple sandwich.

Needless to say I don't goto YH to be wowed by the food but at least try a little bit harder to have a decent pallet.

Service was great and the waitress was on top of her tables. She was super friendly and really open to any suggestions and answered all our questions to the best of her knowledge."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of Yard House mainly for their exceptional beer selection on tap. If you want to step out of your regular beer bubble, this is the place to venture out of it. This restaurant is more open and spacious compared to the Town Square location. If the weather is right, I would recommend sitting upstairs on the patio with excellent views of the promenade and the High Roller.

Food from the large and diverse menu, consisting of some Asian inspired selections, while not mind blowing, has been consistent with every visit. I had the pan seared ahi on my last visit. The Chinese black bean sauce was heavy and overwhelmed the perfectly seared tuna. As far as the rest of the menu, I would not recommend the mediocre steaks or average pizza. I was pleased with the street tacos and maybe having a sampling of the appetizers with your beers is the way to go.

The beer is what I come to Yard House for and I was satisfied with my tasty lineup of four pints of darks: Brooklyn Brown, Anderson Valley Wild Turkey Stout, Deschutes Black Butte, and the Boulder Nitro Shake Chocolate Porter. If you like bourbon and stout, the Wild Turkey stout is an interesting combo that I've never had.

There have been no complaints with service on any of our visits. Expect a price point of $$ to $$$ depending on how much you drink. There's no doubt I'll be back if hanging out around the LINQ."}
{"text":"The unmatched draft beer list is something that always draws me to any Yard House. We used to flock to this location for happy hour at the bar after work. The perimeter of the center bar was roped off like it still is now and we would stand in this roped off area crammed butt to nut, with the entire area around the bar lined with people three deep not able to move or hear any conversation while everyone still tried to act cool.

Nowadays, I just go with my family for maybe a beer or two and for dinner. We came on our most recent visit on Saturday night with about a five minute wait. We sat inside at a booth with a ten top table next to us and an overall very noisy restaurant. Quarters are much tighter in this location compared to others.

We were served by Victor who did a fine job despite being busy, but also taking time to make my daughter and her friend laugh along with bringing the entire table water without request. We started off with the shrimp ceviche and nachos. The nachos were a nice portion and loaded with plenty of chicken, beans, cheese. I wasn't that pleased with the ceviche as the mango papaya salsa was too sweet and overpowered the dish hiding the traditional tart flavor of a ceviche.

For entrees, I ordered two tacos, fish and pork belly, which I preferred the pork belly. And also ordered were a chicken Cobb salad and mini creme brulee for dessert. The Cobb salad was nice sized portion with plenty of ingredients and big enough for my daughter and her friend to split. The bananas topping the custard on the creme brulee were also hit by the torch giving them a bit of candied texture also.

The menu is large at Yard House with some items done well, but nothing exceptional. This location isn't as family friendly as other locations due to the louder environment and with a clientele that favors groups that are there hopping between other bars in Town Square. I would come back to this location with my friends during one of the early or late happy hours to sample the discounted beers and while munching on some food."}
{"text":"Yard House is always a great place to eat at during anytime especially for Happy Hour during regular 3-6 or late night!

I've been to all locations in Las Vegas. This one is tucked away in Summerlin at Red Rock Hotel & Casino. Great ambiance and spacious atmosphere. 

I've tried a variety of foods that were all great from here from chicken nachos, salads, turkey sandwich, calm chowder, bbq chicken pizza, poke nachos- new favorite, poke stack, spicy tuna, & my recent try of gardein fried chicken strips- which was my not so favorite, I liked the regular version better. 

They have great choices for drinks and you can always ask for a sangria since they have enough wine variety to make it even though it's not on the menu."}
{"text":"This review is two fold-

The beer selection is awesome. Lots to choose from in the realm of craft beer and cocktails. 
The staff is super friendly and was always open to helping with anything we needed.

However...

The food was not on par. I tried the hot chicken and a friend friend the southern fried chicken and hubby had the seafood omelette. We all shared the lettuce wraps. All of our food was cold ... My hot chicken was not temperature or spiced hot... The taste just felt it was missing something...

For happy hour I've heard it's worth a deal but our meals at dinner were not worth $16+ a pop... Womp womp."}
{"text":"Found this place only because I had a gift card.  WoW, was I happily surprised!  We sat inside/outside which was wonderful.  Got the feel of being outside but you were still covered just outside a mall.  The menu is extensive and it's difficult to make a choice.  We had the brussels sprouts and \"ripped\" potatoes, which were to die for!  Each of us ordered something different, not one of us were disappointed."}
{"text":"I frequent this place a lot, at least once every week. Of course my favorite is to come during happy hour for the cheap appetizers. The food is great, the atmosphere is fun, and I've experienced great service every time I'm there! Lettuce wraps are my favorite, washed down with a pear cider! Yummy!!!!!"}
{"text":"I went here while visiting family in the area on a recommendation.  I was super thrilled with the service and tap list.  The Poke nachos were awesome and the truffle fries were pretty delicious too.  They handled my young niece like a pro with all of the whimsical demands of a smaller child.

I actually wound up skipping the beer list since I was still working off a hangover, but went for the lobster mac 'n cheese since I'd heard it was good and my vitality was picking up after the appetizers.  After eating about 1/5 of the mac 'n cheese I decided to take the rest home since my stomach didn't seem up to the task (from the hangover, I thought).  My stomach churned a bit the rest of the day, and I felt a little sick until the next morning.  I figured I'd finally hydrated enough and I felt great all day until I went to the fridge for a late dinner... I ate half of the remaining mac 'n cheese and felt not great within 30-40 minutes.  My stomach churned again the next day...

I know it's tough to pin down a bad meal and I didn't get serious food poisoning or anything, but it is tough to say the mac wasn't to blame.  All of my other meals for the weekend were shared and no one else had any issues.  It stinks because the mac 'n cheese looked really good with big chunks of lobster and I've really enjoyed the Yard House in other cities before, but feeling ill can be tough to overcome.

I know I'll be back for a beer next time I'm in town, but it might take some convincing to add lunch to the schedule."}
{"text":"Really good food and service. The list of beers is phenomenal. You won't have any problem trying to pair a beer with your meal because the have everything covered. Imports, domestics, crafts,  dark, light, amber they have it all. The only issue is having to restrain yourself from ordering all of them lol. All beer is on draught which is amazing. The food is really bomb too. I ordered a roast beef dip sandwich which was really good. Also tried the artichoke dip and that was also good. Would defintiely come back to take a date. Prices are reasonable and a good happy hour."}
{"text":"Staff is the worst of all time I've had better service by my dog and he doesn't even know how to talk, write, or speak. That staff seems like they don't care about making money. 

But 4 stars because the food is amazing and love the happy hour"}
{"text":"Always a favorite. This place never disappoints. It is a favorite in our house. Great location, food and service.."}
{"text":"Had a great time as usual at the Vegas Yardhouse. Our server Brittany was amazing.
Fantastic, attentive and knowledgeable. Food, drink and atmosphere  great. Sit outside if possible and enjoy the beer selection."}
{"text":"Good food and Great service from Sara on my Birthday for lunch. Next time I'm in Las Vegas I will be sure and return to Yard House"}
{"text":"The beer selection can not be beat, but besides that the food is just OK.  I have had several dishes there and none are memorable.  The pricing is a bit high, but the place is always clean and has a great vibe.  The service is OK, but again, nothing to \"write home about\".  I much prefer BJ's if looking for good food with a wide selection of beers."}
{"text":"Well here's a good one. I ordered the skirt steak and eggs but I was told the eggs only come scrambled. After an act of congress the waitress informed me that the eggs can be fried eggs but the final decision on the egg temperature will be made by the chef. So, if I want over medium he can serve me sunny side up and it's not open for discussion. I spoke to the manager and I was told that the chefs have not been trained on how to cook different temperature eggs. Yep, instead I ordered sea bass. That my friends they can cook, but eggs over easy... Well... That's an entirely different advanced coarse at the culinary school. The management staff informed me that eggs with the steak is new and they are still fine tuning on how to properly cook the eggs. This is why the only option was scrambled. I informed the manager I will be more than willing to hold an advanced class in the kitchen right now free of charge on how to cook an egg over easy. I was not taken up on this offer. I then informed her if more than one chef would like to sit in, again... Free of charge. No go.  Go for the beer, not the food."}
{"text":"This place comes up as dog friendly when searching on yelp. I went ahead and called anyway, just to double check. The woman I spoke with on the phone said that they did allow dogs in the patio area, I even repeated it back to her and she said confirmed again. We drove about 25 minutes to the restaurant and walked in through the patio. We told one of the servers that we just walked in through the patio to avoid walking the dog through the restaurant. She told us to go ahead and sit wherever we wanted. After sitting down, another woman walks up and tells us that we need to move to the other side of the patio and put our dog over the fence and outside of the patio. Seriously? Get your act together and retrain your staff!! Thanks for wasting our time. Headed to McFate Brewery instead, we love that place..."}
{"text":"Came in while I was visiting family in Vegas. Having been a bartender for years I almost always sit at the bar, I am way more comfortable there. Torrey was my bartender and she did an amazing job. When i come to yard house I like to always try something different since their beer list is so expansive, and she was really amazing about going through the list with me and helping me pick out a few different selections, her recommendations were totally on point. I will definitely be back next time I come for a visit."}
{"text":"My fiancee' and I were in town for Super Bowl and decided to check out Yard House, because  we've had good experiences at their Temecula, CA location. All Yard House's are not created equal. I had no problem with the 30 minute wait or the beer selection and my jumbo shrimp were exceptional. I had three issues that left me charred. My medium ribeye was overdone, still edible, but overdone (a little chewy), their wine list was as narrow as a yard glass, and my waitress was not really very good. Their is a bar set for a certain priced steak and it was just not even close. You expect \"prime\" beef at that bar and I couldn't say if it was even \"choice\". If I didn't have the gift card, I probably would of went elsewhere. Probably wouldn't be bitchin'. Probably wouldn't have to see a therapist."}
{"text":"This is for bar service only! I have never been taken care of at a bar better than this. 140 beers on tap and I wish I could hang here every night. All the the bar tenders are amazing & look after all the customers. If you are a beer fan you need to check out this place!!! It's awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Always great here.  Unlimited food selection, everything is always spot on.  The tortilla soup is a must try.  They will sit you near the football game you want to watch also. They ask ahead of time which game you want to see."}
{"text":"Fries are super, calamari usually soggy     Big beer selection, but too much money  But the I am 68"}
{"text":"Nice selection of beers on tap. Outdoor seating is the way to go on a cool night after a game, movie or shopping. Great for people watching. very pleasant staff."}
{"text":"Came here last night for my birthday dinner. Our server was pleasant and quick. We ordered the onion ring tower off the happy hour menu - yummy! I had the Spicy Jambalaya and my husband had a burger. We both really enjoyed our meals. I docked two stars because my husband puked out all of his food this morning at 2AM - he's thinking maybe the burger wasn't cooked well enough. It was REALLY pink. Another star off because - even with happy hour - my (house) vodka cranberries were $10 each. That's pretty pricey."}
{"text":"120 beers on the tap, 120 beers, take one down, gulp it down, 119 beers on the tap...you get the idea. The Yard House IS beer. But they also have 24 appetizers. 14 different starter salads and soups. Oodles and scads of burgers and sandwiches. Endless lists of steak and house specialty entrees. It makes The Cheesecake Factory menu look like a freakin' pamphlet. We arrived with a group of nine and were greated and seated by a friendly host staff. We opted for a table over a booth, cuz I ain't gonna be the bastard squished in the middle, drinking beer and having to get out 3 or 4 times to pee. We had just come from the Shamrock Foods show at the U of P stadium and had grazed on all things fried and anything you can stick a party toothpick in. So I was ready for a black and tan and perhaps a salad. Black and tan, both of them, went down quickly. I ordered the turkey cobb salad. And I got exactly that. Turkey was a tad dry, of course, when isn't it, and at $13.45, kinda pricey. Others had the mac n cheese, which was overwhelmed by the mushrooms. A BBQ chicken salad, that was, described as \"Meh\" (and no I was not with Pierre)...apparently though \"Meh\" is catching on like my current year motto \"Make it great in 08\"...well at least mine rhymes. Best dish on the table, not at the table, cuz that woulda been moi, but best dish on the table was a Korean rib appetizer. Server Christa was fantastic although frustrated as the runners delivered our meals and \"auctioned\" them off even though she had ordered them by position number. Music was all things 70s and 80s...The Outfield! What the hell happened to them?Located in Glendale this House is not in my back yard and that's OK with me."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the Yardhouse.  We frequent the one in San Diego, and decided to try this one while we were in town.  The food is consistently good; I usually get an appetizer and the \"side\" walnut pear salad (which is the size of an entree - not so much a side salad).  The beer selection is awesome; they have over 100 beers and various sizes so you can try as many as you like.  

The quality of the service at the bar left something to be desired; there were eight to ten bartenders present, none of whom noticed that they had not taken our order.  We waved and called out to them for a few minutes, while they all walked by, oblivious.  After we finally resorted to tapping our glass on the bar, they took our order - but not without a snotty attitude.

I will say, however, that the waitress at the table was much more polite and attentive.  

I'll go back, but I'll probably steer clear of the bar since good service can make or break your experience."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour... just before 3... was seated promptly... drinks brought out quickly... ordered several dishes off the happy hour menu... tried the seared ahi, poke stack, spicy ahi roll, sliders, and crab cakes... everything brought out right away... everything was good except the spicy ahi roll was a little different.  Our server Christian was super friendly and efficient... will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Place is great.  Beer is awesome. It DOES have a menu much like Cheesecake Factory, there is anything you can think of on it.  We sat at the bar had some lunch.  Ordered lettuce wraps to start, they came out with our meal, no biggie.

Bartender was attentive and the place was very clean.

My only issue with this place is the nutrition.  Unlike Cheesecake they do not have a low-cal section of their menu. I was remiss to find out their Turkey burger, yes turkey, has well over 70 grams of fat.  If you go to their homepage you can find the nutrition facts.  They have several meals with over 100 grams of fat, no kidding!

They also have a nice lunch section of more moderately priced items."}
{"text":"This place, in my humble opinion, is a notch above Chili's. It's got a lot of beer, a lot of tv's, and is a good place to watch football. Save for the fact that they don't have chicken wings :(

I got the steak and shrimp...steak was tougher than shoe leather. Didn't finish it. Shrimp were cooked right and the green beans were good. 

Mom got grilled cheese & tomato soup.  Hard to mess this up but I'm sure someone can. She was happy. Tomato soup there is really good.

Dad was the winner, he go the turkey pot pie. Thing was amazingly huge and was very tasty. I'd hate to see the calories in the thing but he was happy.

Lobster mac-n-cheese is amazing there.  Another friend got the thai chicken pizza, it was ok, but was lacking flavor in my opinion. I mean, it is Thai after all."}
{"text":"Always a good place for happy hour and beer. Love that they have a late night happy hour. Good selection of menu items. Tons of different beers and cocktails. My favorite items are the vampire tacos, spinach dip and the seared ahi. Service is average and I usually get the awkard servers every once in a while."}
{"text":"The happy hour here is bomb-diggity! 4-6 and 10-12

There are SO many beer choices on tap (my favorite being the st bernardus abt12) and the appetizers that are half off during happy hour are delicious!
 I usually stick to the gardein wings and sometimes get a pizza or onion rings also.The seared tuna is a standout from the usual bar fare and offers a flavorful tuna steak with wasabi that is really good!

The atmosphere is nice and the place is clean and smoke free. People around the bar there are usually super friendly as well, so dont be shy! Strike up a conversation while indulging in great beer and enjoying the game(s) on a  multitude of televisions over the bar"}
{"text":"First let me start out with our server Shay! AMAZING! The atmosphere here is great. This is our first time in and everything looks amazing. As our food sales pitcher Shay would say she doesn't have to try very hard when the food is amazing. Wow is she right. We ordered everything from Nashville hot chicken to the shiitake garlic noodles. Think we found our new hangout. Sports bar setting with a finer dining feel. Ok so after devouring our whole meal the consensus is beyond ridiculous! Right down to the darn pickles as a garnish. Pub/bar yes food way above that."}
{"text":"My friends love this chain, so we decided to eat here for dinner before the Saturday night Divas show in the LINQ Theater. After a 40-minute wait, we were finally seated. It's the usual restaurant-with-bar atmosphere -- loud chatter and big screen TVs everywhere.

Two of the people in my party ordered the HUGE turkey pot pie, one ordered a salad, and I ordered chicken tenders with fries. The shoestring fries were delightfully well-seasoned and crispy! And, the chicken was moist and cooked just right. The breading seemed airy and light, so it gave me the impression that it wasn't as cholesterol-laden as normal chicken tenders. I'm sure I'm wrong. The pot pies and the salad were devoured, so I'm guessing my friends really enjoyed their meals as well.

Our server was friendly and made sure we had everything we needed. Near the end of the meal, she had to take a short break, so she introduced us to another server who would take her place. Our replacement server was nice as well. Overall, it was a great experience and I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Awesome hang out with lots of tvs,  good music and really large selection of food/drinks. Nice place to unwind with friends.  Pretty much everything on the menu is good. I would highly recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"An extensive menu of very fresh food. I had the chicken bowl with jasmine rice. Small size was filling and the vegetables were fresh and sauce perfect. The avocado chicken sandwich was also very good as was the Caesar salad. A modern and light filled restaurant with a well informed staff."}
{"text":"Best Yard House yet! When I eat out I modify like crazy (nutrition is my job) and the staff here are very accommodating.  I'm a local who lives on the strip and will be back repeatedly. Great staff, great service, great location, great looking restaurant. I posted a photo of the chicken avocado sandwich on the menu. I modified it to come with no bun (along with several other modifications) and it came out better than my expectations. The effort behind the presentation and customer satisfaction is obvious."}
{"text":"Been coming here off and on several years and is always satisfied with Service  and Menu choices...would recommend this location to locals and visitors alike....Two thumbs up  !!!"}
{"text":"Last night some friends and I went to dinner here. Everyone loved their food and the service was incredible. 
I ordered a meal and then a side soup and when my soup did not come out on time with all the other food, my waitress apologized, the guy who brought my soup out apologized, and even the manager came to the table to apologize. Then, without even a complaint on my end, the soup was taken off my bill. This situation was handled perfectly and even a little too apologetic (but that's better then nothing). 
Also, we came at a weird time so our waitress was changing shifts. Before she left she introduced our new waitress and thanked us for coming and how it was \"nice to meet us\". Most waitresses and waiters just leave and don't tell the table/ leave us with someone new. 
The service here was better then service I have received so far in the Phoenix area, and it was greatly appreciated.  Plus, the food was awesome! No complaints!"}
{"text":"Alright, so I went here for the first time with a huge group of co workers, and I got here early because they do not take reservations, and every time my co workers have come here for shin-dings they have had to wait a ridiculous amount of time. But this time I was seated quickly and we were served very fast, in and out.

So this review is based mostly on the fact that they have a very good vegetarian menu that even meat eaters love. I am talking about the most amaze-balls buffalo tofu wings I have ever eaten, ever. Some of my co workers even got some for themselves they taste so bloody great. Their veg menu is much more than salads and veggie burgers, they have fish 'n chips, chicken wings, fried wings, and even meatballs. 

They also have some very good truffle fries and a California rolls app that is one huge circle of rice, fish, and ginger. And for those who like alcohol they have a huge selection of draft beers and wines. HUGE.

Down sides are that they do not take reservations, lighting is very dim, especially outside, and wait staff can be slow at times. I once had my water filled all over twice after I told them to just bring me a bunch- I am eating buffalo wings for cripes sake! Anyways, other than a few hit and misses this place is a good place to come with a bunch of friends, but it is pretty pricey considering."}
{"text":"I thought I had written a review from my visit in March but I guess not lol. My brother and his wife live in Arizona, so this is where we went right after I landed and our waiter was fabulous etc etc. I give it two stars for my first night experience, plus I love the company establishment etc. I would give it a one star or even none if I could for my second experience here. This rating is solely based upon my experience and not the establishment itself, because I am a fan of the Yard House. I had a horrible snobb stick up his a** waiter! He seemed like life was miserable. I mean everyone else, including the manager was amazing so I am sorry to give such a low rating, but like I said, it is solely based on my experience with this one waiter. I only wish I got his name, so I could warn everyone not to get served by him! lol. He seemed as if he was so miserable and he was taking it out on us. Let's see, i'll describe him. Black or dark brown spiky hair...caucasian, light skin, and snooty!"}
{"text":"I added one star because I only gave it two stars solely on the 2nd experience my friend's and I had there. Thanks to the owner for a nice respectful response and the manager was pretty friendly here. The establishment is wonderful, plenty of choices of beer, a full bar as well as many many selections on the menu!"}
{"text":"We frequent the Yard House at Town Square and Red Rock pretty often, but last night was the first time we had the new menu. There were 4 of us and we decided to order several appetizers and share. The chicken nachos are soooo good. Possibly best nachos ever. There are 2 sauces...a green and a red, beans, chicken, guacamole, sour cream and CHEESE! Real shredded cheese, not processed cheese sauce. There goes the diet. 

I read a few reviews on yelp and several people raved about the searing ahi so we tried that, as well as the hummus, garlic noodles, shrimp lettuce wraps & mushroom lettuce wraps. The hummus was ok, but on the salty side. The tuna was disappointing to say the least. The last piece I put in my mouth had such a repulsive texture I had to spit it out immediately. I guess its a good thing the texture was so fowl because if I had swallowed it I probably wouldve gotten food poisoning. It seems like the tuna is previously frozen (and possibly artificially dyed bright pink) and wasn't great overall, but that one piece was absolutely disgusting.  I didn't have any of the lettuce wraps, but my friends said the mushroom ones were super salty...bordering on inedible.  The garlic noodles were decent.

We really like Yard House, but I think it tries to have a menu to please everyone instead of sticking to what they do really well--bar food.  The bf loves the giant selection of beers and the service is always very good. I'm going to steer clear of the Asian menu items and stick with my favorite bbq chicken salad...or when I want to splurge, the chicken nachos."}
{"text":"I am a fan of yard houses in general but this one is great.  As with all yard houses, the menu choices are expansive and varied for all appetites. We tend to go there for the beer menu  which gives you many choices to explore. This review though is for their service. In a time when service is very hit or miss, this restaurant team is excelling. On several occasions, it is the service that will dictate your dining experience. Here , the staff is well educated in their menu, beverages and protocols. During one of our visits, we even had to compliment our server to the manager...that was how good of an impression he made upon us. Well done to the management and staff!"}
{"text":"So, Ashley is amazing. Food is great and the beer selection is out of this world. 120+ beers on tap plus a great food selection. In other words, it's Yard House. I've never been disappointed and this time was the norm. Great food and service and being able to sample the beers was perfect. I selected a Shock Top and a Papago Orange. Plus there is a gluten free menu. The selection for lunch was fantastic and the service is great. On top of which, this location is at Westgate, so you can window shop, grab a movie or enjoy the day."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for some drinks after some shopping and was SUPER impressed with the beer selection at this place! They have a HUGE selection; you are bound to find something to fall in love with here. I love going to places and being able to try a new beer that i have never had before and even better they had one of my favs that is really hard to come across...double score!!

inside and outside seating, bar seating as well. Did not eat during this visit but i did look over the menu and they had a lot to choose from and some things did catch my attention.

i will be back !"}
{"text":"GARDEIN WINGS!!!!!!! the Thai pizza, the noodles, just the whole gardien section is amazing. It's crazy how the wings look like it's actually buffalo wings. But it's not. 

gardein is a chicken or beef substitute made from soy, wheat, pea proteins, vegetables and ancient grains. Yard House offers a variety of menu selections made with gardein that do not contain meat, fish, poultry, shellfish or product derived from these sources, but may contain dairy or eggs.. this is not a vegan friendly environment. Sorry mina."}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal here. Kale Caesar salad is one of my favorite food items there. Big beer selection and the location is great right outside the Linq promenade. Menu has tons of great options"}
{"text":"You can't get a better view of the High Roller and the Linq project, than from here! We ate on the upstairs patio, Tim, our waiter, was fantastic! Huge beer selection of beer, burger, truffle fries and clam chowder were great! ps- from the time we came through the front door, every employee was courteous and seemed to be genuinely happy!"}
{"text":"I normally come here for happy hour and I usually order the chicken lettuce wrap, cheese dip, nachos and Korean beef short ribs! 

The last time I was here our chicken lettuce wrap was a little too salty. But other than that I love it here!"}
{"text":"The food is good and there is a large selection of brews. Being in this area, there's always a lot of fans. The two times I've been here we've had the same waitress and the service was extremely SLOW. When ordering beer it came long after our food was done as we were ready to leave. The service is the only thing that turns me off from this restaurant."}
{"text":"Love their happy hour here! Every time I feel like having a drink I usually go here and sit at the bar. The servers are very friendly and they are very good at giving suggestions when it comes to their drinks, they will even let you sample on beers. My favorite is their poke nachos, it's very flavorful, has a little bit of spiciness to it because of the sriracha mayo on top. The serving size is big, two people can share it but I can finish everything myself. One time I thought I try something else so I ordered their pepperoni pizza. The flavor is ok, nothing special also it was super greasy. Check his place out especially during their happy hour. I personally wouldn't go here on their regular hours unless I'm craving for their Ahi Crunch, which is really good too."}
{"text":"Management needs training....
I ordered the Mediterranean Vegetable sand-which and a salad with lemon wedges on the side. I asked for the lemon three times before I gave up. Then when my sand-which was served to me it was cold. I sent it back to the kitchen, the server than came over and made a joke about it. Once the new one was brought over to me it was warmer but all that hot however the rest of my party was almost done dining so I choose to keep it.
Debbie the manager on duty came over to check on me, which at first I thought was a wonderful touch. At which point she stated to me that the dish was grilled then kept cold and MICROWAVED when ordered and served. I was shocked to hear this, all would have been acceptable with her apologizing but to further explain to me that the meal was microwaved was just beyond me.
She did not charge me for the meal but it was too late to save us. The food did not come out in order, one of the members of our party received her meal prior to her appetizer and another member did get the sweet potato fries that they ordered. 

Will not go back if I don't have too...."}
{"text":"Went there for my 21st birthday...was terribly disappointed by the food that we ordered. Everything was extremely greasy. The only plus this place has is the beer. But if you're looking for good food, there are plenty of other places around. Also, service is sub-par, with the waitresses not knowing much about the menu and not checking on the table as often as they should."}
{"text":"Went last night with three friends to sit at the bar for happy hour.... Ray and Josh were my bartenders and awesome!    Had a great night and I forgot how much I loved YARDHOUSE at Red Rock!  Thanks guys...."}
{"text":"If you are a lover of good beer or a vegetarian, this is THE spot....

I've been coming here for years with my baseball buddies, and it just gets better and better... 

Our group of 20 stormed the place starting at happy hour... amazing prices on craft & unusual import beer! While they have the usual bar apps, you really have to try the unusual such as the portabello lettuce wraps...Hawaiian Poke Stack & the Garlic noodles! 

Unlike most chains, they have a full vegetarian menu that covers apps, main courses & salads. They use a vegetable protein mix that truly does mimic the taste & feel of chicken and beef. All the taste, none of the moo, oink or cluck!

Service: Most chains it's hit or miss... with our huge party, the bartenders were awesome! Smiling, helping us choose our beer... a nice surprise. The wait staff after we sat down were just awesome! 

In a nutshell, there's something for everyone here... and you won't go broke in the process!"}
{"text":"Great food..   Certainly NOT cheap, but good.   Portion sizes were a little small for the high prices, but it was very tasty.   Really good location.   Would go back maybe just for a drink and appetizers."}
{"text":"This is a big place and when you walk in it seems like a big \"mill,\" a very commercial atmosphere.  I guess their claim-to-fame is that they have more beers on tap than any other restaurant.  My girlfriend and I had salads and they were good enough, but what really was the best was the incredible service.  The manager seated us and he was very friendly and had some suggestions regarding their beer samplers.  Our server Marc was absolutely the bomb. He was one of the best waiters I have ever come across.  Extremely attentive, very engaging, and very focused on the guests.  When he talked to you, you felt like the most important person in the room.  My best buddy from Sweden was with us and he can be very demanding, but Marc handled him perfectly and made some great recommendations when it came to the different beer samplers.  We did a testing where we rated the beers and Marc seemed genuinely interested and checked back with us for the final results.  Before we left we asked another waiter to get the manager (the same guy that had seated us) and we took on a stern attitude as he approached the table and he later admitted that he was getting ready to be complained to, as that's usually the case when he gets called.  We however, only had positive things for him."}
{"text":"First time here and will definitely be returning, we sat on the patio and the ambiance was amazing.  Our server Nathaniel was on point, always checked on us and consistently filled our water he even recommend beers and drinks along with food, if you go here you may order the POKE NACHOS they are to DIE for.  The manager even cane around and had a conversation with us ensuring everything was ok it was a nice touch, will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Blackened chicken torta.... Spicy n delicious..  Thanks Gina your service was immpeckable!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Ive been here like five times since moving here so its obviously the place to go for regulars. The first few times I went I ordered their Chicken Caesar Salad, Chicken Rice Bowl, and an Ahi Tuna dish. The salad is veryyyy tastey so I kept ordering that the other times. The third time I came here I was ordering vodka martinis and they were made perfectly. So funny story, I started noticing that on the third drink, the bartender had given me three olives so I was like lol.... Then the fourth one he gave me four olives so I was really laughing at this point because the drink looked ridiculous. I asked the waiter what the hell the bartender was up to and at first he thought I was complaining but it turned into a big laughing session. Thank you for making mine and my date's night Mr. Mysterious Bartender. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Was there with friends on Friday. The meal was okay. I ordered the ahi tuna sandwich. Was it supposed to be room temperature?  With onion soup which was slightly warmer than room temperature.   The flavors were underwhelming. The sandwich didn't really have much flavor. The onion soup was okay, but too much salt. 

The service was okay - lots of up selling attempts. No mention that the soup was not an even swap with fries, but shrug. At $20 with tip, way too much for me for a return visit for what I got.  

Ambience is noisy bar, shrug, if the food was better, it'd be worth it."}
{"text":"If you like beer then this is definitely the place for you! They have over 50 beers on tap you can try and the food is yummy too! I ordered the street tacos which were very flavorful and yummy, the only thing I found odd was that they were on flour tortillas instead of corn. I also ordered the Kale salad which was really good too. My husband ordered the Mac N Cheese, which if you like Mac and Cheese I would definitely recommend getting it. 

The service was quite great as well. The server was very attentive to our needs and came around quite a bit to check on us. All in all this is a great restaurant and I would definitely go back here again!"}
{"text":"Wow! What an awesome place! With 64 beers on draft and over 140 food options there seriously is something for every one here! 

The alcohol menu is large and beautiful. It's broken down by type of alcohol (vodka, rum, tequila, etc) and then there's the glorious beer list that is also broken down by styles so it's a really readable user friendly menu with something for everyone even those who are not too sure about different craft beers. 

The staff is amazing and they were very knowledgeable and helpful making recommendations based upon our likings and things we may have not considered but ended up being great. 

The food is also amazing. The appetizers are a bit pricey but are shareable portions so splitting an app is a great way to try different things without breaking the bank. 

They offer an awesome happy hour menu Monday through Friday and I already have plans to go back for happy hour! 

Another awesome and unique thing about this place is they offer about 7 chickein options for vegetarians (not sure how they are or if they are vegan but still there's good options) 

The atmosphere is fun and the music is nice. It's a great place for a date night or time out with friends. I'm really excited about this find and can't wait to go back for more! Y"}
{"text":"Straight up happy. A definite \"will return\" when in the mood and in the area. Place is clean. People are friendly. Service was on point.

Not 5 stars because I do believe some of their menu items are a bit pricey and may be better when purchased during their generous happy hours.

Pepperjack burger and enchilada stack both really tasty and well portioned.

Huge beer menu that could take hours to study.

Awesome dessert sampler for a very fair price. Best value on the whole menu, IMO.

In my opinion, \"brew pubs,\" and \"sports bars\" can fall into the same kind of competitive back-and-forth that a lot of burger joints do. You like what you like. And, you don't like what you don't like.

There are the \"breast-araunts\" where you can go and goof off like googly-eyed teenagers while old enough to drink. If you like that, then go there - there are a couple name brands in the area. There are some that seem to be all about the \"craft beers\" and almost act like Napa Valley wine snobs for those that aren't all that up to speed about beers. And, there are sports bars that are really more about the booze and the endless TVs than the food or service quality. Those are great for groups that want to get plastered and whoop it up!

Thankfully, IMO, Yard House is not any of that. I think of them as pretty high end (for what they are) yet casual and laid back. I imagine it can get loud when there during a big game, though."}
{"text":"I'm two for two this weekend. Nine people for lunch. Forty minutes after we ordered, our food came. One person ordered a burger medium rare. It came well done. She apologetically sent it back. When the burger returned we were finished eating. And the new one was well done. The beer was good (Boddingtons on tap) but by the time the food came it was nearly time to order the next meal. Nice enough people, but really awful service. What has happened to customer service? There wasn't a crowd, there seemed to be plenty of employees. No offer was made to discount the burger. I swear. So I've decided I'm posting at every restaurant I visit, often 5 or 6 a week. I would encourage you to do the same. If the service is subpar, let 'em know."}
{"text":"The last night I was in Vegas my friends and I spent several hours shopping. By about 9:00pm it had been a long time since any of us had eaten, and we were getting very hangry. We were struggling to decide on a restaurant, and ended up going to Yard House by default: there was no line or wait, and it was right in front of us. I don't think I would have chosen it otherwise as I try to avoid chains. It's basically a slightly more upscale bar. They carry about a million (okay, honestly like 50?) beers on tap, and their bar is basically the whole centerpiece of the space. The food style is pretty much your basic American, maybe leaning a bit toward comfort food/(not fancy) steakhouse.

When we entered we were immediately greeted by the hostess, and brought to a pub table. Not my favorite, but we weren't going to complain, we just needed to eat. They were also surprisingly super busy, and there weren't any booths (my preference) open anyways. Within a few minutes a waiter came by and took our drink order, returning shortly thereafter for our food choices. We went with the following:

Cheeseburger and truffle fries-I didn't try the cheeseburger (my friend loved it), but they were very generous with the fries, which were thin, crispy, hot, and DELICIOUS.
Steak Salad-My friend ordered this and did not care for it. She felt like the steak was chewy, not a quality cut or cooked well, and that the salad was very oily. It did seem like it was drenched in dressing. The various vegetables and toppings were colorful and appealing, so if you are interested in trying this maybe dressing on the side is the way to go?
Blue Crab Cakes-Featured two small-ish crab cakes, the cakes themselves almost completely crab, but then breaded and fried. I've never had crab cakes this way, but I was into it. The passionfruit sauce and tropical fruit salsa both complimented the crab perfectly.
Kale Caesar Salad-They offer a plain Caesar, and this one, which is maybe a dollar more. I expected it to consist of kale entirely, but it was maybe 2/3 romaine and 1/3 kale. Still, a nice basic salad. Not too much dressing, and I really liked the larger shavings of parmesan. I ordered the smaller size, and along with the crab cakes it was a well portioned dinner.

Prices, especially for Vegas, were decent at around $12-$20ish for entrees. Our server was a bit odd, but not unfriendly. He checked on us often, so no complaints. This wasn't the best meal ever, but it was surprisingly good, and I'd visit again, although probably wouldn't go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"Great service friendly environment, went during lunch busy, still was able to get a table, it's a bit of a walk, so don't expected front row parking, unless you use a uber"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. The bar is always staffed with fast and friendly bartenders. The servers are always on top of your order and make sure your drink is always full. The manager Hope is very attentive and always makes sure your dining experience is up to par."}
{"text":"Always have a good time at Yard House. The beer selection is the winner, the food is definitely more so-so across the board. The best meals I've had here are the Cuban sandwich and the Prime Rib dip sandwich. Garlic fries also very good."}
{"text":"The beer selection is fantastic, and the happy hour makes this place a reasonable deal. They also have my favorite beer (hoegaarden w/lemon- if you like hefe-weizens, you should try it).

It can get overly crowded, and there's usually a long wait for tables. The food is good, but the bar crowd will definitely spill over into the dining section.

For the most part the staff is friendly, and more down-to-earth than the average vegas place."}
{"text":"I will recommend this restaurant to EVERYONE!
Management & staff - Outstanding!
Their Gluten Free menu is BOTH SIDES!
More than just a salad!  
We WILL Be Back!"}
{"text":"If you like a big selection of beers, both micro and major brands, than you'll like the Yard House. Located on the bottom of Fashion Square, the Yard House has great atmosphere. It looks very modern and hip which matches the surrounding fancy mall very well. It is an actual nice restaurant and not just a bar making it an appropriate place to bring children. The type of atmosphere they are aiming for, the prices and selections of food remind me a lot of a BJ's Restaurant. The portions are generous but unfortunately, the food I had didn't really impress me."}
{"text":"The food is average while the decor is contemporary. The main selling point of this place are the multiple flat screen that play sports games and the various selection of alcohol at their bar. Service is pretty good and friendly. The lunch menu is available from 11:00a.m. 5:00 p.m. every day. Happy hour menu with almost 1/2 price appetizers are available Monday through Friday from 3:00p.m to 6:00p.m. The price is excellent where you can get a whole pizza for approximately $6.00 or $7.00. A great deal!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick drink/snack last night. We were in a rush, so we didn't have enough time to order actual food. When our server, Sean, asked if we wanted anything besides the beer/wings, I let him know we didn't have enough time to order. I wasn't telling him we were in a rush to speed anything up-we ordered what we knew we could finish in our short window of time. Regardless, he asked what time we needed to leave by and ensured we had our appetizer in time to actually eat it and cashed us out just before our \"deadline\". :) Being a server myself, I honestly get irritated when people tell me they are in a rush (if you don't have time to wait for full service-get take out), so I really appreciated that he offered to speed things up with us without ever being asked to. Great service!"}
{"text":"Everything I've had here has been great.  The Crab, artichoke dip is always a tastie snack and tonight's Mac & Cheese w chicken, and bacon was great.  Though I seemed to have kept eating and it never got smaller so I had to take it home to have it again..  Bummer!  :)"}
{"text":"Okay, so anyone following my reviews may know that most of them are 4 or 5 stars. This is because I tend to only review places I like, rather than become a complainer and taddle tale on my bad experiences. With that said:

The Yard House is by far the best place to find gourmet beers and gourmet food under the same roof in the West Valley. Their selection of beers is staggering, and the bar tenders know their stuff!

The food... well... I wish I had a thesaurus handy because every dish I've tried here surpasses my vocabulary involving deliciousness!!!

I would not only recommend the Yard House, but ask you please to visit."}
{"text":"Yardhouse has always been a favorite of mine once I first tried it out in Marina Del Rey, CA.  They have an outstanding variety of options to choose from on their menu and heavily American cuisine oriented.  Their Firecracker wings are out of this world good as well as their Lobster Artichoke Dip.  They also have a chipotle ranch for dipping on the wings and other foods including fries and onion tower that you want to make sure you get.  I have never had a bad experience at any Yardhouse and coming here in Scottsdale was no different.  Secretly Amazing Menu Item You Wouldn't Normally Buy At A Restaurant:  Grilled Cheese and Tomato Bisque.  Do it."}
{"text":"My friends and I found this place on our last day in Las Vegas. Hostess staff was friendly and we had a choice of inside or the patio, we chose the patio and it was a great decision! 
Our waiter (Paul) was fabulous. He gave us suggestions on food and drinks, which we took him up on and it turned out to be the right decision. 
We had the queso with crunchy pita chips and hot & spicy edamame. Both were very good! I order the vampire tacos and the Parmesan crusted shells were amazing! My friends all loved their food as well. 
Paul was very knowledgeable on the beer they offered and I took him up on his suggestion of a Modelo with spicy Bloody Mary mix, a splash of Tabasco, and a lime and wowza! It was so delish! Can't go wrong with choosing to eat here!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to hold a UYE based around the Angels vs. Dodgers baseball game.  I don't know too many places that is central to the Valley.  After thinking it over for about a week, we decided to go to the Yard House at Town Center.  Now, I have been to a couple of Yard Houses in So. Cal. and I liked the idea.  So, I called and made a reservation for the 10 of us.  Here is my experience:

Like I stated before, I called to make a reservation.  And, I talked to Bo, one of the managers.  He was extremely helpful as I told him my needs.  Which were, a table to fit all of us and a T.V. to watch the game.  He hooked us up and explained up front that there was to be an 18% automatic gratuity added to our bill.  Which is policy for groups over 7.  We were fine with that as I'm sure we tipped out more.

Our waiter and waitress were awesome.. they were friendly, attentive and speedy.  I should have gotten their names but, I forgot.  They truly made the night.  

I saw food and drinks come out and everything looked good.  I don't think that anyone had any problems.  I can only comment on the Pizza and beer that I ordered.  I was really happy with my order.  I can't complain at all.

So, I give Yard House 5 stars because we all had a great night with great service, great drinks, great food and even better company.

Side note: The Angels won! and that was just the icing on the cake."}
{"text":"The food was good but neither of our dishes was actually hot off the stove. My jambalaya was luke warm (still tasted very good though) and my boyfriends chips part of the fish and chips were cold. They never brought us our water we asked for at the beginning of the meal before appetizers. When they brought my bf his beer they gave him a dirty glass with literal dirt rings around the bottom of it and it wasn't chilled at all. When they brought me my cocktail it had rotten brown mint leaves in it.... honestly the young kid who seemed to be training to be a server did a better job at assisting us than our actual server did. Maybe next time we'll try the yard house in town square..."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and beer!  They have my favorite beer on tap (Newcastle) and I love drinking yards of beer!  I recommend all the food items marked \"favorites\" I have had them all and the are great."}
{"text":"I have been the Yard House many times and there are very few things I don't like.  The spinach artichoke dip wasn't the best but I really like their pizza's and deviled eggs.  The service is always great too!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place since I know everyone else has found a way to. Our waiter was slow. I got the Halibut and asked for it without Bok Choy...it came out way overcooked and was served on top of Bok Choy. I don't understand why so many of the dishes at Yard House come with Bok Choy...it's not an exciting side and has no flavor the way they serve it."}
{"text":"My friends raved about this place....saying it had great food/beer and super fast service. The hubby got a chicken and avocado sandwich with fries and I got a shrimp caesar salad. His sandwich was good and his fries were fun because they're so tiny. My salad was drenched in dressing (that tasted like mustard, not Caesar) despite asking for them to go light on the dressing and for $16 it only had 4 shrimp...one of which was not cooked through. The beer came to the table by the time my hubby had finished his sandwich. I just wasn't impressed and wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying I've been going to the Yard House for nearly a decade now. When I lived in North Scottsdale, we'd trek over to the Desert Ridge location, but now I just make sure I have lunch at the Fashion Square location anytime I'm spending a day at the mall. I love their Gardein meat substitute menu - when I first found out about it, I was *so* excited and it's never let me down!

A few days ago, one of my best girlfriends and I had lunch there and I ordered the Gardein BBQ Chicken Salad, my favorite. The food came out super quick, but I noticed my food was definitely incorrect - there were noodles and the smell of soy sauce and sesame oil. I asked our server if maybe the order had come in wrong, that this looked (and smelled) like the asian pasta salad. He apologized, quickly took it back and came back to let me know that the order had somehow gotten lost in translation. No big deal! He was very apologetic and told me my correct salad would be out shortly. I said ok, no worries! A few moments later, their head chef came out and apologized and let me know that, because of the mess up, they would be taking care of my lunch for me. I was shocked, in a really great way. I hadn't made a scene by any means (I've worked customer service for 9+ years, I know mistakes get made and who cares? I was enjoying a leisurely lunch anyway), but they really had amazing customer service and I was so thankful for their genuine level of caring about the mistake made, even though I wasn't upset at all! My salad came a few minutes after that, while my girlfriend was still only halfway through her meal! No harm, no foul. 

Basically what I'm saying is, for amazing customer service, awesome beers, and tons of options, Yard House is tops. I always *have* recommended it, and now, after that amazing and unexpected experience, I will always continue to do so."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner last night. Overall experience was poor... at best. I've been here for lunch once before, it was fine. Came here for dinner with somebody who was in town and the music was just pumping. It was super loud.  It was fairly early in the evening, around 5pm, when we arrived and there were a lot of people in the restaurant, mostly families and people just trying to have a conversation over dinner. I asked the waitress if there's any possibility of turning the music down slightly as it was almost impossible to have a conversation in the restaurant and she indicated that they would not do that. That was their music level and that's where it was going to stay. She wasn't rude about it, but certainly as you looked around the restaurant most people were having the exact same problem. I understand if it was a later crowd and maybe more of a bar crowd but this was absolutely families and people having dinner.  

The second issue was the service. Food came out at a relatively reasonable pace however they forgot my French fries to go with my sliders, another member of our party ordered chicken fingers and they were way, way over cooked. They really didn't seem to care whether they were overcooked or not and nobody really ever came back to check on us. So my two star review is because it wasn't exactly consumer-friendly, service wasn't great, and anybody could have, should have, noticed that the food wasn't prepared properly. French fries are pretty standard item on some of these menu items and over cooking something as simple as chicken fingers.... I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"This yard house location is great.  I was hesitant about trying it out, because there are very mixed reviews about it, but we had a great time.  We came on a week night, so it wasn't too crowded.  There didn't seem to be too many tourists, which was nice.  
This time around, I tried the Tangerine Wheat, which was really fruity, and refreshing, but I expected it to be a little more tart, and a bit less hoppy.  
My second choice was the House Honey Blonde, and I loved it!  It was very light, smooth, and had a lovely honey aftertaste.
My boyfriend told me that I would probably like Boddington's, so I tried that as well.  It was very unique, and super tasty.  It's kind of like Guinness, but it's light.  It has a creamy feel to it, very enjoyable.
The bartenders were very friendly, attentive, and experts at pouring pints.
Overall, I think if the price of the Yard House experience isn't a deterrent, then you should definitely stop by.  If it is, stop by during happy hour.  There are drink specials, and the appetizers are half off.  The chicken nachos are a personal favorite."}
{"text":"Great happy hour specials.  Couple of glasses of wine (or beer for those beer loving friends) and sharing a couple of the apps is a great way to spend a few hours.  The service is good during happy hour (it gets a CRAZY on a Friday or Saturday night).  Seared ahi is a yummy delight."}
{"text":"Update: I am downgrading my rating from 5 stars (!) to 2 stars!
I used to eat at Yard House at least once a week because of the GREAT GARDEIN menu, but this will unfortunately change as of today: Apparently they no longer serve any Gardein Burgers which is a huge BUMMER! Their vegetarian burgers were super delicious and didn't taste any different from the real one...
I am really disappointed as I thought of Yard House as a progressive restaurant which is open minded enough to incorporate the conscious vegetarian trend..."}
{"text":"4 stars for service and my beer 3-3.5 for food.....

I have come to love Yard House for their beer selection and variety.  I mostly have come to love many of their beer blends.  

I had an old favorite there which was a Wyders Peach Cider mixed with Pyramid Apricot Ale.  Oh man soo good.  On my most recent trip I discovered they don't carry the peach cider any more and I love a light summer fruity beer for lunch especially.  So as a lover of Lambics I decided on the Rose Garden a blend of Framboise and Hoegaarden White.  Ahh I had to stop at 3. Although I could have had more they were light tasty and refreshing without the sweet richness that the Framboise alone can be. 

The food...it's good....not great but there is surely something on the menu for everyone.   
It can be a bit pricy my friend and I had 3 beers each and lunch and it was $67 without tip. Averaging about $6 per beer and $15 per entre.  [He had the steak sandwich and I had the poke bowl appetizer and edamame]"}
{"text":"I've been to various Yard House restaurants now, and even though it's a \"chain,\" I can't seem to get enough of them!

This location is located off the strip in Summerlin, which is more convenient to get to.  Red Rock Resort is also a great spot to visit along with the mall nearby. Good food, friendly staff, and a great selection for all types of palettes. Love the beer and wine selection too. This past visit I had the pork burger (no bun - which they're happy to do) and the side chopped salad.  Good stuff!

Can't wait to go back when the weather warms up to sit on the patio."}
{"text":"Okay, so I know Yard House is a chain restaurant, but it has to be one of the best chain restaurants out there.  I'm lucky enough to have one at home, but the one at the LINQ is great.

The location is newer and seats a good amount of people, so the wait was only about 5 minutes.  I started out with a bottle of rose, which is quite perfect (only one on the menu).  I tried the pastrami benedict burger (omg a fried egg on top... yes, please), and my friend ordered the BBQ chicken salad.  Both were amazing.  As a complimentary birthday dessert, my friend received the mini chocolate souffle cake and vanilla ice cream with specialty cocoa to dip it in.  YUM.

In my eyes, YH can do no wrong.  Keep on keepin' on."}
{"text":"Last night we went to yard house to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. When we arrived we did have to wait about twenty minutes to be seated (which i didn't mind). 
The atmosphere is very relaxing and my waitress was good. They have a large alcohol menu for those who would like to indulge. 
I would recommend the penne chicken dish! It is delicious!"}
{"text":"This was another stop on our pub crawl and I only had one drink here so I don't have too much to go by for rating, but they had a nice selection and the cider realler hit the spot.  They had a nice big patio outside that accomodated a ton of us and when the birthday boy was ready to leave, the waitress tallied everything up nice and quick."}
{"text":"I wish I had been able to sample one of the many beers on tap, but since we only stopped in for a quick lunch I passed. They do offer lunch specials. I had the bbq chicken pizza with ranch salad. It was ok. The crust reminded me of a frozen pizza and was surprisingly light on the chicken. I think it had 2-3 pieces. I would skip the ranch salad next time. The croutons were soggy, lettuce brown, dressing seemed lacking, and the amount of corn surprising."}
{"text":"I had a decent cheeseburguesa here, and the beer selection was second to few, but these fuckers know nothing of rock and roll... It pisses me off to no end when fucktards like whomever owns this establishment bill the place as a rock and roll hangout and then play stuff like jill sobule and some sacklless fucks trying to cover beatles and stevie wonder songs. Stevie wonder covers??? Really??  Fuck you. the yard house does for \"rock and roll\" what fox news does for \"fair and balanced.\" but yeah, the food was decent."}
{"text":"We were very impressed with the selection of beers, and the prices weren't bad either. The place was packed, even though I could tell it was a \"slow\" day."}
{"text":"Definitely like the outdoor area here over Town Square's.  Grand Cafe was closed at Red Rock which made this place a no brainer around 11pm.  Same menu, same times for happy hour!  That makes the value pretty phenomenal for what you can get.  I was already fairly loaded when we walked in so we just split pizza and wings which were more than enough.  All for less than $12 before tip!  Yes!!"}
{"text":"So I was here w/ a few friends watching the C's/Lakers game a few weeks ago and I'm drinking a 1/2 yard of Pabst.  Well..we're about pretty much done w/ our 1st round of beers and looking to order some food when I accidentally tipped my pretty much empty 1/2 yard glass over shattering it on the table.  4 staff people hurry to the table like there's a virus on the loose and clean everything up in 45 seconds...AND THEN they offer us a free round on them because they're worried about glass in the beers.  

Wait..didn't I break the glass??  Weren't our beers pretty much done??  How are we getting rewarded for this??  Ummmm..ok..SURE!!!

So 5 stars for the service!!  I guess if you're hard up for cash and want a free round that you could intentionally break a glass there...."}
{"text":"I usually like this place well enough but this location must not put much effort in team morale. Everyone looked miserable and we felt like a complete inconvenience for our whole meal. We were first greeted by a girl that dropped menus but informed us she was off so our actual server would be over shortly. A decent wait later she came back to say \"I guess i will be your server so what can I get you?\" I ordered a beer and she just blankly stared at me for a while so I assumed she needed my id and started digging in my purse which seemed to annoy her (in her defense I am only 25 so I cut her some slack there.) We put in our order but when the spinach dip appetizer came out the chips provided looked burnt and definitely tasted so, so we had to wait for our server to stop talking to coworkers in the kitchen (we had a clear view from our booth) to gesture her over and ask for a new batch that weren't nearly black. (Again, gave her slack on this because she didn't run the food to see the chips before they landed on the table) but then she must have forgotten our request because we didn't get the chips until our actual meal came out. And they were plain tortilla chips, not the same ones we originally received. She again sat in the kitchen talking to other servers, probably annoyed she had to take more tables since it was fairly slow (as a food server I am fairly positive she only had one table as we were seated that had paid before our meal came, and one other table of three men ordered a beer each as we ate our food). Only making note of that to say there's no way she was just very busy. I get bad days but this girl hates her job and just wanted to get out and made it very apparent that she couldn't do that until we got out of her table. For very \"meh\" food that wasn't great or terrible, the server is the deciding factor to make or break the experience and Veronica made it a definite bust. Won't be back- and if I am I'll make sure to sit at the bar top where the working staff can't hide."}
{"text":"I usually go to Yard House once a week for the past few months. I've never had a problem until a couple days ago when I came here with a friend.

Came here for happy hour on a Wednesday night. First of all, food was great, like always. We ordered a pint of Heineken and a cocktail for drinks. For food, we got a onion rings, chicken wings, bbq chicken pizza, and mushroom lettuce wraps. Everything was tasty. The only reason Im giving them 2 stars.

However, that day was far by the worst service I've had. I'm not sure what the guy's name is, but I found him very rude. After we ordered, he didnt come by to check on us once. While we were still eating, he dropped a few to go boxes and the check without even asking if we even needed it or if we wanted dessert. We had like 6 slices of pizza , over half of the onion ring tower and a couple chicken wings left.  We felt so rushed. I would have understood if they were getting ready to close, but it wasn't even 11 yet. It seemed like he didnt want us to be there at all. 

I honestly hope that will be the only awful experience I have here because the food is wonderful."}
{"text":"I hate to do this, but I totally give it a one star. The first time I was here it was great and then I came here a few day ago and I had a horrific experience. I came in after 5pm with my friend and I asked the waitress if I can customize my meal and she says yeah of course. So I told her that I'm a simple person and I just wanted angel hair pasta and grilled chicken. I order a beer as well, and of course the beer comes first. So we're drinking having a good time and then the food comes and my dish is filled with vegetables and just completely wrong and not what I wanted. The waitress apologized and admitted she misunderstood what I said and I had no problem, it's okay it happens. At this point I was kinda upset because my friend started eating and I haven't even received my food yet. 8 min later my food comes out and by the time I picked up my fork my food was cold and in all honesty it was our fault that we chose to sit outside when there was a breeze, but my food was very cold. After that I realized there was no Alfredo sauce and it was solo dry so I asked if they had any Alfredo sauce and she said they don't. I asked her for butter at least and she brings me frozen butter which won't melt on a cold pasta dish. So I was stuck eating butter pasta with cold butter stuck to each noodle. I found a piece of broccoli in my dish and a random noodle that wasn't angel hair as well. I'm almost done eat and my second beer hasn't arrived, so I flag a random waiter and ask him if he can cancel my beer because I'm done eating already and my second beer hasn't come yet. By the time he leaves our waitress comes with my beer. Ugh! I tell her I cancelled it and she says it's on the house. Eventually the manager came and talked to me and I explained to her what happened and she didn't charge me for the pasta. Thank god I didn't have to pay for that because I make better pasta then that. Pasta is pasta how do you mess that up? You can tell the chefs didn't stir it because some noodles were stuck together. I mean cmon I'm not asking you to make me lobster. It's just pasta. I don't think I'll be back and if I ever get forced to come here I'll sit inside and come on a not so busy day. :/"}
{"text":"Food is always pretty good. Cold beer and tons of different options for beers. This is one of those places you get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"I went there for dinner one night with friends and ordered the mac and cheese dish with chicken and bacon in it. It came out very dry and I did not enjoy. I am sure that my experience was not a common one as the place was packed so I will give this place a pass and give it a 3."}
{"text":"Rob was an awesome server.  We just came off the high roller and we were looking for a drink and snacks with a 2 year old.  Got seated right away in booth big enough that he had room to play, awesome.  Bloody Mary was awesome it comes with a shot of beer that went well with the bloody.  Never tried it that way but it was tasty along with the bacon.  Ordered the bowl of onion soup and chicken tortilla, amazing and huge.  Then onion ring tower, great taste but a lot.  The the chicken nachos.  Holy moly, a lot of food came out but delicious.  Kids hamburger was dry with no tomatoes or anything but taste of the meat was great, my boy ate half of it with fries.  All that for $52.  In Vegas thats cheap and well worth the taste of the food.  Beer people this place has a list you would be happy with!"}
{"text":"I'd give this a zero star if possible. I came here on 11/21/15 around 10:30pm and the bouncer here was so incredibly rude. He let me in immediately and harassed my boyfriend until we didn't even want to visit the yard house ever again. The bouncer made me extremely uncomfortable and I'll never visit any yard house again. I'll definitely be calling the manager."}
{"text":"I've been here no less than 10 times (a pertinent fact for this review). Prior to my last visit, this was always a 4-star place for me. They are very veg*n-friendly, and offer numerous veggie options, as well as Gardein options, which is a popular and yummy vegan protein manufacturer.  It was a great place for taking family and/or friends because there is something for everyone. 

I suggest going during Happy Hour: M-F, 3pm-6pm; M-Thur, 10pm-close.  You get 1/2 off of certain appetizers (and it's not just a few; there's a nice list from which to choose) and discounts off of sliders and other items.  Otherwise, it's over-priced.  
They have drink specials too, but I don't drink so I'm not familiar with those offerings.

My favorites are the Gardein Firecracker and Buffalo \"wings\" and the Gardein sliders (all available during HH). My order is a constant rotation of these three things; always.  When we visited this past Friday night, we ordered the Gardein Firecracker wings, Gardein Sliders, and there was a new appetizer that I decided to try: Crispy Brussels Sprouts and Potatoes.

The Crispy Brussels Sprouts were uneven in their preparation. 1/2 of the Brussels Sprouts were quite undercooked; the other 1/2 were delicious and melted in your mouth, but not crispy, as the name implies. The potatoes in this dish were indeed crispy (and flavorful). 

My Gardein Firecracker wings came to my table and did not look like Firecracker wings at all.  They were sauceless pieces of Gardein with a side sauce.  I tasted the sauce and I didn't know what it was.  It took a while before our server returned.  He said he'd written down Jerk wings, which I've never ordered. Ever.  I advised him that I wanted Firecracker Gardein wings. His face went a little sour, but he took the plate back for a re-do. 

My Gardein Sliders came out with cheese.  This was my fault. I hadn't been here in a few months and had forgotten that they come with cheese because it is NOT listed in the description on their menu. Our waiter took this plate back as well to be remade. They really should revise their menu to include a thorough description of their food items. 


The Firecracker wings come back and some of them seem to be shaped a bit differently than the normal Gardein wings.  I bit into one and it was weird... I inspected it and found that it was real animal flesh.  After having already complained too much for my own liking, I flagged down the waiter and advised that I had been given real chicken instead of Gardein.  He stated that it was Gardein because of the special stick that was put in the dish, and that their Gardein is surprisingly chicken-like.  His assumption that I didn't know the difference, or that I was a Yard House noob angered me even more. 

THEN he proceeded to bring over a different waiter, saying that the new guy would be taking over because he had a plane to catch at 10pm and he had to go.  1 - it was already almost 10:15pm (as my DD immediately pointed out).  2 - When we were leaving, @ 45 minutes later, he was still there.   My conclusion: So he's a habitual liar?

I didn't ask for a manager.   I didn't ask for the items to be removed from my $50 bill. I didn't stiff him on a tip (although it was substantially smaller than I would've normally given).  But I won't return to this location.  I'll proceed to the Fashion Square Mall or Glendale location when I need my Yard House fix."}
{"text":"First of all, I'm a major Gardein fangirl, so when my omnivore family wanted to go to a pub that had an entire Gardein section in its menu I was all in.

They have a Gardein burger and sliders (omit the cheese and special sauce), which comes with fries. They also have Gardein \"wings\" in a variety of different flavors. The sliders & wings are on the Happy Hour menu, so from 3p-6p, M-F, they are nearly 1/2 off.

They have pasta options as well but I've never tried those. They've also added more veggie appetizers, like a cauliflower dish & a Brussels Sprouts & Potato dish. I don't know what sauces these are cooked with (haven't tried them) so make sure you inquire with the chef or manager (not the waiter) before ordering.

Food was fresh, yummy, and nicely presented. We had good table service. It was perfect for a pre-concert dinner. (Gila River Arena is only @ 100 feet away.)

If you're shopping or headed to a concert in this Westgate area, there aren't many options for vegans. Yard House is a solid choice, particularly when dining with omnivores."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Yard House in the valley. Located at, but not inside, Fashion Square mall, next to Crate & Barrel. It's large and spacious. The staff is always pleasant. On my last visit, our waitress was extremely personable and borderline comedic. Loved her!

There were only 3 in my party, but we ordered a ton of food. It was Happy Hour, so we took advantage of the slashed prices. 

My non-veg*n peeps ordered Chicken Nachos (a huge portion! 2-3 people could easily share), Chicken Strips, Blue Crab Cakes, and a Pineapple Pizza. They loved everything they ordered. 

I got my usual: 
Gardein Sliders (hold the cheese & sauces). You get 4 sliders and they come with fries.

Gardein Firecracker \"Wings\"
Gardein Buffalo \"Wings\"

Everything was beautifully presented and delicious! I especially love how they give you the same portions at Happy Hour that you get during any other time. 

The restaurant is always clean, restrooms included. TVs galore, for you sports enthusiasts. And I personally love their music selection. Lots of 80s rock = mucho booty-shaking-in-my-chair-whilst-stuffing-my-face. This will continue to be my go-to Yard House."}
{"text":"Love their happy hour! Service is always pretty good, but the food can sometimes be inconsistent. Other than that I love coming here for a late night hang out."}
{"text":"A good place to watch games and drink good beer. Not the greatest prices in the world but average for an upscale place. Pizzas are good. Burgers are ok because most of the time just well done no matter what you ask for."}
{"text":"Yard House is just basically a Cheesecake Factory menu but with better beer.  I would normally say this place is too trendy for me but there were huge families with tons of kids everywhere, which just didn't seem appropriate and weird.  Who the fuck would want to take their family to a place that serves so much beer and the music is so loud you can hardly hear yourself speak?  I don't get it.

There's nothing good about going here, from the hour long waits to just get a table and then another hour to be served the overpriced food.  My husband and I, only ordered an appetizer, a dinner, and 3 beers and paid $60 with tip.  There are so many other places that serve the same food in a more timely manner, cheaper, and without the loud music blaring that I'm not sure why people go here.  And what is with making people enter from the outside and not from the casino?

There's no way in hell I would return."}
{"text":"I've been to the one in Pasadena many many years ago so I dragged husband in because I loved their beer selection. 

Beer as usual is awesome.  We both thought the food was pretty good, the prices weren't great but they weren't crazy bad either.  I actually loved the way they cooked the chicken in my chicken caesar, so much that this one was probably the best caesar (and I order a lot of them) I've had since we've moved to the Vegas area.

Wouldn't come here regularly because it's in Town Center, which is too crowded for my tastes.  Plus there are so many other choices to try to come here regularly.

Oh the music they play (mostly classics) is very  very loud.  It didn't bother me, but my husband was really annoyed by it."}
{"text":"Consistent better than average bar food and great service.

Fast service and food delivery.  My wife and I are not big sports fans but always something good going on to watch.

Our first Yard House visit was a blast pulling our boat up to the restaurant dock behind in So Cal."}
{"text":"I used to rave about this place. Crab cakes are great and the California roll superb. Bar boys ruined that...lazy F\"5k$. Wasn't even busy and it took 25 minutes to get 2 beers. I guess they were too busy talking about hair products."}
{"text":"They have an extensive and high quality set of vegetarian options. They prepare the various Gardein products (Chick wings, sliders, etc.) in a traditional meat version fashion including buffalo and hot/spicy chicken wings with dressing and celery on the side. Naturally their beer selection is unparalleled.  Every time I've visited the food has been great and paired easily with just about any beer you can imagine."}
{"text":"I'm not usually a fan of chain restaurants but a few items here have me coming back. Their Tuna tower is SO GOOD. Also tried truffle fries here for the first time and loved it!! All the other plates I've tried have been good. Service is always great."}
{"text":"My husband and I have tried probably half of their really really long menu. We love pretty much everything. My current favorite is the chicken lettuce wraps and my husband loves the Surf and Turf Burger. Large variety of beers on tap. The Old 43 is my favorite mixed drink they have. My son loves the large selection of vegetarian options they offer. We eat here quite often."}
{"text":"Went out for dinner with my dad not expecting much, but the service was amazing! I had the enchiladas and the Crème brûlée, both to die for!! Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Food was OK, but not outstanding.  This review is more on the negative side due to the expectations of a  \"gluten free menu\" and lack of delivery.  We had a guest in town with a gluten allergy and found that they advertise a GF menu. Excited to find some place to take our guests, the menu and excitement quickly faded. Their GF menu lists a burger (and sandwiches), but it wasn't really a burger. It was just the patty with a side of lettuce, tomatoes, onion and pickle. That's not a burger, then fries were not an option (oil is used to cook battered onion rings, chicken, etc). So burger and fries, became a patty and salad. Why bother with a special GF menu? You can order the same way off the regular menu, by skipping the fries and say no bun. Other non-GF plates ordered were pretty basic. Wouldn't go out of my way to go back here, especially if our food allergy guest comes back. If you have a gluten allergy, skip this place and go to the Chesesecake Factory in Henderson and get a real burger with the bun and fries...all GF."}
{"text":"Finally reviewing my favorite chain restaurant! Read below for reasons why it's my favorite..

The service is always near perfect. The hostesses are super friendly and always smiling. The waiters and waitresses are prompt with orders, refill your liquid very regularly, and when sitting at the bar, the drinks are poured strong and fast. The bartenders are even great at fake laughing to my horrible puns and observations.. 

The atmosphere is amazing here. They have huge, comfortable booths, outdoor seating with heaters/mist-ers, and normal bar/table seating. Plus people watching is great if you're single. So many hot/pretty girls and good looking dudes to look at and flirt with (well, for me, the girls). Haha. It's a very hip, modern, FUN place whether you're 21 or 51. Not recommended for he families with kids, though..

The food is the reason I keep coming back. The Ahi Tuna nachos, cheese curds, Tuna Poki Stack, Beranaise burger sliders, salads, soup, and basically everything here is awesome tasting. My only gripe is they switched their awesome shoe-string fries to average, unoriginal typical fries. 

Pro tip: Get the Coconut battered deep fried cheese curds. Holy crap, they're great!"}
{"text":"Poke bowl always a must! GREAT beer selection and specialty beers.. Very knowledgeable staff! Everything on the menu is delicious!! Happy hour or not.. Place is always packed with a great atmosphere!! Have become a weekly regular!!"}
{"text":"Great place for happy hour... They have soooo many items to chose from..... 

Affordable..

Plenty of staff... they were great at refilling the water... getting teh food and drinks..

Lots of beer options on tap...

Food was ok.... filled us up.... Nothing fancy...... No one got sick....

We will go back..."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, if you can get one.  Services is among the worst I've seen. Bar tenders spend more time socializing among themselves than service.  Literally had 4 bartenders chit chatting in front of me for 5 minutes before one finally made eye contact and asked if I wanted something.  Duh. Isn't that why people come here?"}
{"text":"My mom and I had lunch here recently while I was in town visiting.  I had the SHRIMP COBB SALAD - greens, kale, tomatoes, edamame, carrots, radish, egg (I held this), bleu cheese, corn, bacon, avocado, ranch.  This is one of my favorite salads.  So much good stuff in it, different from a regular Cobb salad.  And you can't beat avocado, bacon and blue cheese.  

My mom had the half sandwich/soup lunch combo.  She had the pastrami sandwich and tomato soup combo.  She liked both items and the portion size is good for her as she does not eat large portions.

The server came around often and refilled our drinks regularly.  Always a good, casual lunch spot."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time for my best friend's 21st birthday. I couldn't really tell who our server was because there were so many people helping us out (that's because we had over 10 people with us). 
Our servers were very patient because some of our guests wasn't able to make it to the restaurant on time and we wanted to wait for most of us to get there before we order food. The food came out at expected time. I ordered rib eye steak. It was amazing but I couldn't eat it all. I still don't think it's worth $30 for a steak. Over all a good experience.
Would definitely go back on special occasions"}
{"text":"This was the MOST disappointing Yard House that I've ever been to before!

We arrived and the host said to follow her to the table. A few minutes later, she finally decided to walk towards it after she was done chatting about things that were absolutely not work related.

Once at our table, our magnificently pathetic server didn't even bring the 4 of us waters for a solid and literal 25 minutes. I did however get my beer in the meantime. 

We ordered food, and while we were all eating and drinking, the waters still never got refilled but once over a 4.5 hour time span. The waiter went out of his way to avoid our table because I think he acted as if we were way to demanding. I know that getting drink refills and taking food orders is a tough gig, but that's your job.

We asked for our bill to be split between the 2 couples, and ours came out about half correct when he brought it out the first time. Then 5 of my buddies friends walked in the door and stood around to say hi because they'd not seen each other for years. When our waiter came back, I asked him to correct the bill and supplied my card to be charged the correct amount while my friend paid him cash for his portion. When it came back being delivered by another waiter, I'd been charged an 18% gratuity for a tab from a party of 9 (because of the standing friends), and my buddy didn't get anything back!

The waiter had left because the place was closing, that's what he charged, and I was basically told that they didn't have time to remove the gratutiy and that they could charge it even if there was not a group over 8 people, and my friend was out $14 in his change because the guy just kept it.

I'll never go back here again. They were terrible service, and terrible people. If you just did your job correctly in the first place, you wouldn't have to go out of your way to steel your tips from people."}
{"text":"Don't mind waiting here! While we had to wait for our table, they have a bar on the street and plenty to look at and roam around with the buzzer. 

Meal was affordable--I was just with another girl and we split 3 of the smaller plates and each had a glass of Rose for under $60 total. Some of the menu items are a little confusing (they don't actually serve sushi rolls, it's more of like a tuna tartare), but all in all it was great service. Perfect place to catch a game too with a bajillion TV's. One of the more kid friendly areas of Vegas too."}
{"text":"Very impressed with the service on a crowded Friday night. The wait to get a table wasn't bad, the wait staff are always there when you need them. The food was excellent. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Yes, it's loud and expensive, but it's all about the location and the \"yard\" glasses of beer. I mean c'mon, where else can you get an obscenely tall glass of alcohol, besides Vegas that is?

The atmosphere is nice and the service was a little slow, but to be fair they were near capacity and at least the servers were making an effort. What I can't stand is when the place is near empty ( see my Blue 32 review ) and still takes for-ev-er.

The food was nothing that memorable, but the kids and wife had no complaints, so I would say its at least average for the area. 
Definitely a good place to spend some time before or after a movie night."}
{"text":"The location is stupid, it is in the middle of a weird mall type place with a patio underneath an overpass. It reminded me of Las Vegas. The beer list was alright. The food was decent for the price. The hostesses were nice girls. The waiter had some beer knowledge. I still felt like I was in a weird place though. Something about it. Like a BW3, but nicer."}
{"text":"I haven't had a bad experience at either of the yard house locations I've been at. The service is good, the food is great and the atmosphere is decent. 

They have good deals on the lunch specials if you dont mind going there during the week. I will admit, however, that I've only tried tree things on the menu. The Mac and cheese2 is my favorite. Don't let the name fool you, it's more of a carbanara of sorts than Mac and cheese."}
{"text":"A friend and I were hungry after we finished our shopping. Scottsdale mall closes at 9 so we forgot to book an appointment at a restaurant around this area because usually everything's fine dining. If there are no reservations we would have to wait over an hour just to dine. Luckily, I found yard house and called them. I asked them how long is the wait for 2 people to dine and they said no wait. We came in around 9 30 pm . Our server Dylan sat us down to our table and served us the whole entire evening. What I loved the most was that he welcomed us, asked what we would like to drink, and when we ordered our dinner, he kept checking back on us to see how were doing or if we need anything else. He was a great server and people like him makes us customers want to come back to places like this.. Thank you Dylan for a great service and dinner with my girlfriend. We enjoyed it here very much. We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"For my first time at a Yard House, I was very impressed. It reminded me of BJ's, but it was more of a college/older crowd place rather than a place you can bring your family. 

We went here during their happy hour, 3-6 pm Monday-Friday. Appetizers were 1/2 off, as well as beer/martinis. I tried the Pomegranate Martini, which was excellent! I love pom juice, and this drink didn't make my face squint. I couldn't even taste the alcohol! By the end of the night, I had my Asian glow face after a few sips from my glass. GEEZ! It was that good!

For appetizers, my friends and I had an array of different foods: blue crab cakes, ham and pineapple pizza, firecracker wings, buffalo wings, chicken lettuce wrap, garlic noodles, sliders, and spicy tuna roll. All of the appetizers were pretty good.

I was also able to try their Raspberry beer, Lindemans Framboise. It was mighty tasty, and again tasted like juice. I also found out you can make floats out of the draft beers. Maybe the chocolate stout with vanilla ice cream? YUM!

I definitely would come back here and bring another group of friends. 

BTW, you can call ahead Thurs-Sun to get a table."}
{"text":"We met friends and family here for beer, cocktails and dinner.  We sat near the bar area, and had a cool view of their endless variety of beers on tap. My hubby had the House Hefeweizen beer and I had the Bikini Tini - cruzan banana rum, malibu pineapple rum, pineapple juice and dekuyper pomegranate.  The cocktail was so yummy, and I can't wait to try their other fun and tasty cocktails!  For dinner, I had the Ahi Crunchy entrée salad - seared rare with field greens, Asian slaw and crispy wontons tossed with soy vinaigrette.  The salad was fresh and delicious.  The ahi was seared perfectly and tasted amazing.  My hubby had the steak and shrimp dinner which he enjoyed very much.  We had a great time at Yard House.  We loved the service and fun atmosphere, and we'll definitely come back again soon."}
{"text":"Great food,  great service,  and an incredibly extensive beer menu... 6 pages of beer?!?!  No wonder happy hour is so popular here.  It does get quite crowded on Friday and Saturday nights,  but is some-what low key during lunch hours any day of the week.  It's also a great place to stop in and catch a game on one of their many tv's."}
{"text":"Yard house is always a great place to go for good food and good drinks. They have a pretty awesome menu and they have a lot of options, from seared ahi tuna to BBQ ribs. And we can't forget about all the endless options of beer! I'm actually not a huge beer fan but they have like some 200 different types of beer to try. And they have a pretty good wine selection too. I do enjoy their cocktails. Most of them are on the sweet side though annnnnd could use a little more alcohol, I tend to like fruity-sour type of martinis. But nonetheless, I definitely go back for the food, their nice waiters and their awesome truffle fries. Mmmm..."}
{"text":"Let me start this off by saying our server Veronica was one of the best servers I've ever had. She was incredibly sweet, attentive, and made our experience here what it was. 

Yard House is located in a prime spot with plenty of shops and tourists - right under the High Roller. There's outdoor and indoor seating, and they give you a buzzer that lets you walk around (with boundaries) while you wait to be seated. We didn't wait long. 

The menu has an array of items in each category, leaving me indecisive. I finally ordered the Nashville Fried Chicken Sandwich with sweet potato fries, and a Bahama Breeze to drink. Girly? Yes. Intriguing because it had banana flavors that were potent and delicious? Also yes. 

Anyways, I inhaled what was on my plate. And it was glorious. 

My boyfriend ordered the salmon entree, and loved it despite having an upper respiratory infection. He wanted to enjoy himself but the only thing he could muster up to drink was a Hot Toddy, which we were luckily able to order!! 

All in all it was a wonderful dining experience, and I would absolutely recommend eating here if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Eh overall.  I usually love the yeardhouse, but this did not quite do it for me. Started out with the hummus, which was a little tasteless and the pita was very chewy.  Next we got the margarita pizza, when really was under par.  Tasted very dry and bland.  No real flavor.  Overall was disappointed with the food.  Add 1 star for the great beer selection.  Not sure if I would go back here."}
{"text":"Still enjoy the food here and that they donate free kids meals to the schools to give out with awards.  However, check your change closely. The other night one of the waitresses kept .33 cents change (total bill $19.67, gave a hundred and got 80 back.).  This is stealing.  It also forces you to alter your tip amount to give either a low tip or a high tip as the change can make the difference between 10% and 18% on a low bill like this one.  Not to mention for people like me who give the change to my daughter to save in her bank, it is very disappointing.  Word to the wait staff here.  You don't have a right to receive a tip, it is up to the customer to determine if you earned one and how much.  I usually give 20% or more but next time, if you take my change, that is your choice of what tip you deserve and I will not give you any more.."}
{"text":"This is my second time here and again I am not impressed. Maybe I'm not ordering the right things??? My first time I ordered the chicken lettuce wraps, I think my problem was I was expecting it to taste like pei wei lettuce wraps. They were ok but pei weis are better. This time I got the beranise burger, thank goodness they put the sauce on the side because I was not a fan. The sauce was cold and was lacking flavor. The burger was good but not impressive. The highlight of the meal was the shoe string French fries. I ended dinner with the creme brulee, I loved that they put bananas on the top but then I was disappointed with the chocolate chunks on the bottom, it just threw off the flavor and texture. I don't know if I will be back. I love the idea of the meals on the menu, they are just not executed out well."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this restaurant. Truffle parm fries, margarita pizza, steak 'n shrimp, cheese burger, everything came together in a timely manner. We also got to sample a few items from the huge beer list. The place was packed solid, and yet we still got great friendly service. Will go back again!"}
{"text":"Everything was amazing, including our server Kimberley! Such a sweetheart! I love the spicy garlic edamame here, and now I'm addicted to the ahi tuna poke bowl! Being a server/bartender myself I was really impressed with Kimberley! Always smiling and really friendly (reminds me of me LOL)! Defiantly when in Vegas, I'm always craving yardhouse! And their honey blanc beer has me always coming back for more! Favorite beer ever!"}
{"text":"So I know there are yard houses everywhere, and I do like the San Diego location better, for a good reason.
When we showed up for drinks at the bar, they're known for having \"100+ beers on draft\", but when sitting at the bar I swear every third tap handle had a \"sorry were out\" sign hanging from it. 
Things I do like about this place : 
1. It has descriptions of flavor for each beer and alcohol content. Just because those are usually my two deciding factors when choosing a beer. 
2. I like that the beer is organized by type soooo.... Wheat, Belgium, hefes, IPAs, etc. if you know what you like, it's easy to narrow it down.....even with this HUGE book of options. 
3. So many IPA's! Thank you Jesus! Finally a place that appreciates good beer and not beer flavored water. 
4. The beer flights, they have a good selection of them. I would suggest the IPA one, obviously.
5. The seasonal beer is always changing and usually a great try. For the summer months they seem to get a bit sweeter, so if you aren't into strawberry-wheat-whatever I would use this for one of your free samples.
6. Yes. They give you two free samples.
7. The truffle fries. OH MEEEEHGEEERD. just try them. You won't regret it. Plus, it's enough to split between two people as a snack.

As for the rest of the food, I can't say I've tried it... It does seem a little on the pricey side for bar style food, but it must be good cause they restaurant side is always busy!"}
{"text":"Food is always delicious. My favorites are the boneless wings (amazing buffalo sauce) and the shiitake garlic noodles. Our server Jake was super attentive and helped us decide on a great beer by sharing his favorites with us and letting us sample first. We love yard house !! Will always be back."}
{"text":"Since its conception, Yard House has always been a safe bet.  I primarily go here for their vast selection of craft beers.  Yet, the grub and half bad either.  

I tried almost everything on the menu and can't go wrong with the Chilean Sea Bass.  The bad boy is one of the priciest items on the menu though.  There is also great appetizers from poke to street tacos...good for complimenting your choice of beer.  

The Yard House in the Town Square is always bustling and nearly impossible to get a table without some sort of wait.  The happy hour menu is pretty good as well.  I usually just take up the standing room along the bar.  

The countless screens should cover all your sports needs, and if not, the helpful staff should be able to flip the channel to your desire.  

Still, the main reason I come here is for the beers.  My favorites include Delirium Tremens, Chimay Cinq Cents, Trois Pistoles, Gulden Draak and a special offering of Firestone Sucaba (limited offer).

I have visited the other location at Red Rock and noticed that they seem to be less packed.  Either way, they are perfect for pre-funking, dinner, or whenever you get thirsty.

P.S. put the waitlist buzzer pager in your pants to get an unexpected surprise!  Never gets old..."}
{"text":"I usually don't go for corporate run places like this, but they seemed to do a good job on this place with out trying to hard.

It is a huge place with a the bar in the middle.  They have a ton of beers on tap!!  We lucked out and got there at happy hour.  I can't remember the names of the beers, but the brown ales were right on!  I tried the Irish Creme Ale (I think that was the name of it.)  Being half Irish I wanted to get back to my roots... : )  It wasn't my favorite but it was still good.  

Tried some sliders with a side of bernaise sauce,  they were tasty.  

I was pleasently suprised with this place.  I think getting there at happy hour may have made my experience that much better."}
{"text":"I would stay away from this place on Friday/Saturday as it is crowded and even if you have table reserved they are weird about when your group/people are coming and you cant be at the bar and the table?  I went on a recent Friday night and I can tell you I was in no mood to be told where I could stand, sit, etc.  I have no plans on returning due to this experience (with a reservation).  There are other places for me."}
{"text":"So... this place is NEITHER A YARD NOR A HOUSE... how deceiving!  But what it is is a great spot to hangout with friends (or family if that's your thing) and eat delectable food and drink beer (or other drinks... again, if that's your thing).  

Good HH specials... and I believe that every appetizer includes that most important of ingredients -- LOVE!    

I would give Yard House 4.5 stars if I could, but I can't.  The only bad thing is the terribly deceiving name.  Lol."}
{"text":"Food is good- but not as nice as it is priced. Extensive draft collection, which happy hour was longer and the service more attentive at the bar.

{"text":"A delightful, fun place to enjoy a meal. I love this place. They have a new spin on every plate that they serve. They pay attention to flavor and design. Try it, you will never forget this place and have plenty to take home to enjoy."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved my dinner here!  So much so, that 2 days later I ordered it for take out, before our long drive home to California. I had the Ahi Tuna Salad, and it is excellent!!! :)  The day I had the take-out version of the salad -- it seemed the portion of salad was smaller, than when we were eating at the restaurant.

The night we had dinner here, we ordered shrimp off the appetizer menu -- which was \"good\" -- but definitely expensive for what you get.  Three pieces of shrimp (sure they are large, but shrimp only gets so big ;) - for $12.95 -- yikes!!  Sweet potato fries were good, but arrived on the cold side.

We ate dinner outside -- great ambiance, and a beautiful Arizona summer night.  Our waitress was friendly, service was fairly fast.  Overall a good expereince.  Prices just a bit too high on some of the selections."}
{"text":"If 3.5 stars was an option, I would have opted for that instead of 3.  Our server was spot on and very friendly.   The food was decent but the portion sizes need some work.  I ordered the rice bowl which was undersized as a dinner entree.  Another in my party ordered the ribs which was a huge pile of food.  

We sat outdoors on the heated patio that really could use a few more heaters.  Out table was between two units and it was a bit too chilly with the breeze in this particular evening.   I would add more heaters with the option of throttling them back than not having enough.   

Beer on tap was a bit pricey for a brew house but there is a wide selection to choose from.    I am pretty non-committal about a return visit to this place.   There was nothing memorable about it in a town full of memorable eateries."}
{"text":"This place was not bad.   It was typical bar food and nothing sang out as amazing or a must have.  

The service was decent. 
The food was decent.  
The time to delivery of meals was decent. 
The pricing was decent considering we were at the Linq.  
Not a beer drinker so can't comment on the alcohol. 

Nothing bad to say.  Nothing amazing to say.   It was exactly what you expect to have at a Yard House.   You won't be disappointed eating here but you will hardly remember the experience a month later."}
{"text":"Normally you would never catch my Yelping about huge corporate giants. I don't think I need to add to their marketing scheme, but I couldn't resist adding a review. 

My review is completely based on this location only. I come to this Yard House a bit too often during their happy hour. I love it because of their late night happy hour. After a long day of school and work, I'm usually done way after the normal happy hour ends. Fortunately, Yard House caters to the night owls out there and starts at 10pm on Sunday-Thursday. 
Now, I'm sure none of this is new to anyone, every Yard House in the nation offers late night. 

Here's why I love this location:
The bartenders here are the best in town. I have come to love the 6 main guys that work the later shift. I usually have one of them pick out my beers for me, and he's always spot on as far as my cravings go. The bars on the strip could really learn a bit about service from these guys. I wouldn't recommend sitting at a table. SIT AT THE BAR! No wait and better service."}
{"text":"Don't know why this is getting only 3 stars - our happy hour experience was great! Loved the Tuna Tartare appetizer, the pizza came out bubbling with oodles of cheese, fried mac and cheese was just okay and didn't care for white sauce that came with it; the tomatoe/red sauce was good. Fried chicken tenders and fries were as expected. That said prices were great and everyone got what they wanted with wide variety menu w free refills on soft drinks. Defintely would return for a happy hour at least"}
{"text":"I loved the mimosa and the filet was a bit burnt but I can't complain I was starving. I didn't feel welcomed when entering the establishment. I got side eyes and unanswered questions from the women working until a kind young gentlemen assisted me. I will return and the next time I get rude service I will take to the manager"}
{"text":"I don't know how many beers Yard House has on tap, but it's a shit-ton. More than I've seen at any other bar. And the servers have as complete a knowledge of them as you could ask for.

Although the actual food and presentation are terrific, I find the menu a little overpriced since many of the dishes come in smaller portions.

Hot Tip: Have your business partner's friend from Florida call during your meal to admit he has elephantitis from falling down in the street. This made for great entertainment for us and the surrounding tables (hello, speakerphone), so I imagine it would for you too."}
{"text":"I love Yard House. No matter what I order it is always great. I usually go to the one in san diego. But I was in vegas with my family. It was 13 of us so I took them to Ellis Island Casino and restaurant for cheap food, but they couldn't take our group. The manager giving us all kinds of excuses. So I called Yard house to see what they can do they said no problem. Food was great as usual It was a little hard to find in the huge out door shopping area but we go there, and it was great. Would definitely recommend to any one. Especially beer lovers, they have many beers on tap. I love the big beer section in the menu."}
{"text":"Awesome draft beer selection and food was good.  Our service was very friendly and attentive.  My only complaint is the restaurant is very noisy, so not the best place if you want to chat."}
{"text":"The food, amount of different drinks, and service is pretty good. I had a seared tuna steak which seemed to be a pretty good portion. Everything tasted pretty good. I also had a spicy mango caipirinha which was only ok. I think a normal caipirinha with lime would have been a better choice but the picture in the drink menu looked good. The server was pretty attentive and refilled our water glasses several times and checked on us. The food here is pretty pricey and the two of us getting meals and one drink a piece was around $70. This is probably one of the best restaurants in the Westgate area but I still think it is a little too pricey."}
{"text":"Yard House is struggling with a serious identity crisis; it doesn't know whether or not to pretend it isn't a chain restaurant. My major issue with Yard House is that is tries to cleverly hide its corporate roots, but doesn't accomplish that task in major areas. Sure the decor is hip and they have craft beer, but there are three major drawbacks for me: an overly large menu, overpriced food, and striving to please too many demographics at once. 

The menu is overwhelmingly large, and while I enjoy the super big list of beers, even that became intimidating. I'd prefer a more condensed menu, especially for food, so I didn't have to spend an hour with the menu like a 90-year-old woman at Applebee's. I know other people really enjoy the super long beer list, but I was hoping for more beer flight options with such a variety. I am not a large beer snob, so having to pick one beer out of 100 is quite a task. 

The food isn't bad, but it definitely isn't worth the price tag. I ordered the pork dip sandwich that came with fries and a red pepper au jus. The sandwich itself was alright, but the fries were horrible. Imagine Steak-N-Shake fries, but without the delicious seasoning and pepper sauce to drown away your sorrow. With a $14 price tag, I expected better than frozen string fries. My SO ordered the cheese curds appetizer, and while they weren't bad, I've had better at fast food restaurants. 

Lastly, what is this place? A chain restaurant that caters to families, a sportier Cheesecake Factory, or hipster date spot? I think Yard House needs to stop trying to please everyone. The interior of the restaurant screams upscale, but with TVs blasting and children running past tables, it felt like more like a sports bar. Overall, Yard House isn't a bad option if you're in the area, but it just isn't worth the price or wait time."}
{"text":"If there's more than 5 stars rating, I'll give more...my family was there last Sunday around 11pm and we are so happy that's it's happy hour! the waiter or the workers there are super nice. the foods was very refreshing good. i really really dig the nachos! it's abit spicy from the fresh cut jalapeños. fresh fish. fresh onions and veggies. truffle fries are my next favorites. there are more items on the happy hour menu but i can only remember those two dishes cause i really enjoyed it. the rest of the family members also enjoyed their meal. we will definitely be back! happy hour or not, I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! I recently was in AZ for spring training with my boyfriend and we decided to go here because of all the great reviews. 

I ordered a skinny margarita and he got some unique beer; they have a HUGE drink menu with plenty of options. You should know that if you go here in the evening, there is probably going to be a wait. We probably had to wait 30-40 minutes. I recommend sitting out on the patio - it's lovely!

For dinner I ordered the kale and Brussels sprouts salad with grilled chicken. I know it seems boring but let me tell you, it's one of the best salads I've ever had in my life. I was practically begging to go back the next day just so I could order again. 

We also got an order of the truffle fries which tasted like magic on my tongue. So much flavor! A little bit greasy but nevertheless delicious! 

My boyfriend got a burger and he didn't seem to impressed. He considers himself a burger expert but I'm not sure about that. 

Anyway I loved this place! Would definitely return."}
{"text":"I write this with a lot of frustration. I have NEVER posted on Yelp for two reasons one- I am not a  big complainer and two- I really don't have much time. I slept on this overnight and woke up still extremely frustrated with my overall experience at the Westgate location Yesterday Tuesday 3/14. 

We arrived at the Yard House at 4:21 pm. We were seated right away, it was Happy Hour and my wife and two Children were exited. The waiter who I understand may have been busy took 15 minutes just to acknowledge us, then says, he will be right back he has to take an order for another table and he'll be right with us. Not only did we wait patiently we allowed him to take the order then took another order for a table that was seated 15-17 minutes after we had already been there and still couldn't get a water... Now, I am getting frustrated I told him we already knew everything we wanted to order and also advised that we were seated long before the other table had gotten there. He did apologize and said he would put our order in first. 

After another 10 minutes and still no drinks I decided to walk up to the front and let someone know If someone could get us our drinks, my kids are younger and here we are at 4:51 with nothing to drink one of the Hostessess said she would let the Manager know and they will make it right another waiter came up and said those same words that the Manager will make it right. I was excited to hear that the care so much and said all the right things. At that time when they are walking back with me the drinks finally came. I said that's the table and she said ok, A manager will be there shortly. 

After the drinks came everything started coming out. Calamari came out with a Chicken finger on the plate and soggy chicken wings. Now at this point the waiter started delivering more plates, the manager came to assist him but never addressed the concerns nor did he say he was the manager just didn't seem like he really cared. He didn't say he was the manager but I knew he was based off the hostess going up to advise him of the situation, I thought under the circumstances he would've asked us or apologized about the overall experience. He didn't apologize He just said is everything ok?  I said now it's fine but he also had the waiter with him and I didn't want to light him up in front of his manager after already telling the waiter to his face. I was very surprised when the bill was full price with not even the tea or soda covered at this point I was over it with The Yard House. I paid the bill and instead of tipping the gentleman my normal 20% I gave him 10% even though he deserved 0%. That kind of tells you a little about my character. 

Take my money and give me a terrible experience but I will never go there again!

{"text":"Bernard aka Tree was an awesome server.  Very polite and had great knowledge of the menu and his recommendations were delicious.  I highly recommend this yard house to locals like myself and to tourist. Ask for Tree and u will have a great experience. Also the music was rocking :)"}
{"text":"Happy hour ! Are my favorite words when it comes to restaurants. So we definetly had to go to Yardhouse. Pretty much everything we ordered was their happy hour menu. Big portions of food was really with the price. My favorite is their stack of Poké for about $8. Came here with a couple of friends after playing a game of golf. 

Ordered some drinks and I ordered the Mango Mojito (I know it's a girly drink). Yardhouse will always be my favorite spot in Vegas for late night meals. The server was very nice and recommended a bunch of things for us to try. Not to mention I met a famous basketball player Aaron Gordon from the Orlando Magic eating here for NBA summer league."}
{"text":"I would normally give this place 4 stars however for an afternoon lunch it took over 2 hours not very happy the service, but the beer was cold!"}
{"text":"Took my friend here for his birthday. They were very friendly and even though it was very busy our food came out fast. Because it was his birthday they even brought out a dessert with the words happy birthday sprinkled in cocoa powder. Very impressed."}
{"text":"Love this place! The layout is nice, service was awesome and the rooftop seating is the best! Especially when the weather is just right. All the Yardhousr restaurants have the same delicious menu and happy hour and late night happy hour. My fave things to order are is the grilled artichoke, kobe bbq (appetizer but huge enough to make a meal), and the moo shoo eggrolls. As far as beer goes, take your pick! There are many! Great place to watch a game as well."}
{"text":"We had eaten here a few times, and none of the food has ever been that good.  This time all  had no real flavor or taste.  My wife and I only ate half, and just left the other half.  Atmosphere was wonderful on the patio, however our waiter seemed like he did not want to be there.

We sat down, and had 2 others join us a few minutes later.  We ordered our drinks first, and he brought the others, and never bothered to ask the other 2 if they wanted drinks.  Every time we wanted something, we had to ask, he was never around.

When it came time for dessert, he just brought our checks.  We had to tell him we wanted dessert.  He was pleasant, just not a good waiter.

It will be a long time before we return."}
{"text":"Ate here before going to a Saturday afternoon movie, sat at the bar. Had been to a Yard House in Vegas but not Scottsdale. Unbelievable choice of beers on tap, just about the best I've ever seen. The bartender, Angela, was perky and very friendly. She even gave me a couple of beer ideas and a sample of one (which was great!). 

My wife had the grilled cheese and tomato bisque. Excellent, thick bisque and fantastic grilled cheese, definitely a buy-again! I had the grilled chicken with avocado on a poppy seed bun. It was good, would have been a little better if the bun was a bit larger as the chicken, lettuce, tomato, & avocado slid off. If it had been grilled a little more, didn't seem like it was above an open flame, or if it had been marinaded, perhaps it would have been a little tastier. Had a cup of french onion soup which was good.

Angela gave great service, even kind of lifted our spirits with her enthusiasm. The prices aren't the best, but they aren't outrageous, but I don't know many places that serve some of the beers they had or that has such a great breadth of a menu. 

We would have given 4.5 stars if we could of, but for what we ordered and the service we had, it is more deserving of 5 stars versus 4."}
{"text":"Awesome food and tons of great beer to chose from. I am a big fan of this restaurant and have frequented the restaurant many times, and haven't ordered something I didn't like yet. Everything tastes amazing, but one suggestion would be to get something other than the street tacos... they are generic and not worth the price in my opinion. Other than that everything is great and I really recommend trying the Firecracker chicken wings."}
{"text":"Way overpriced and over rated, but that pretty much describes everything at Westgate.  Customers are pretty snooty, and the staff is OK, but always seemed under staffed each time I went there, due to the long wait times."}
{"text":"Was exactly what we needed when we needed it. We are vegetarians, which can be incredibly frustrating when looking for a decent meal that's not overly priced. Yard House was perfect for our Monday night walk though Vegas. Took a little time to find, but was definitely worth the walk. Service was great, food was tasty and the bill was half what I was expecting. Definitely worth another visit next time we are in town."}
{"text":"We came on a Tuesday night a few weeks ago, with vegan/vegetarian friends visiting from out of town. Their \"gardein menu\" items are all cooked on the same flat top and in the same oil as all the meat, as the waitress informed us. The hostess also seated us at a table near the bar, next to a 12 top of extremely drunk and loud women. I asked her to reseat us at a booth and she flat out said no. We asked for the check after the drinks as our friends were disgusted at the thought of consuming meat juices. The waitress practically threw the check at us and stormed off. Luckily when I complained on twitter about the whole incident, a woman from the yardhouse corporate office did her best to rectify the bad experience. We may be back with non-veg friends..."}
{"text":"Last night my partner and I tried this place for a late night dinner. We both decided to order hamburgers since it was our first time eating here. For our snacks/appetizers we ordered hot wings and truffle fries. The wings and fries were great, our main course however wasn't. The bun used for the burgers looked like they were bought from a grocery store. The kind you buy for 99 cents. It wasn't toasted. I ordered the pepper crusted gorgonzola. It was suppose to have caramelized onions but believe me, they weren't. Simply sweated down and placed on a bun. My hamburger was certainly pepper crusted but it was not seasoned properly. The dish was missing salt, none on the hamburger or the fries. The choice of bun, with not being toasted and mushrooms, greasy onions and cheese made the bread soggy. I ate only the fries. We ordered dessert and got the mini trio. This place loves it's mini concept. The apple peach cobbler was delicious but the chocolate soufflé cake was very bitter and the lemon soufflé cake was liquified. It seems like they made the recipe for mug cake and not a soufflé. I gave my review 2 stars because of the apple peach cobbler, the fries, hot wings and beer. The St Bernardus was awesome!"}
{"text":"Great service - busy location but very attentive staff. Brussels sprout salad was divine and I loved my generous serving of my Beet/Quinoa salad.  Finished the meal with an Irish coffee"}
{"text":"The Shrimp lettuce wrap here was better than the one I had at Yard House at Town Square. You gotta try the dessert, it was delicious."}
{"text":"Great place catch happy hour and the street tacos!"}
{"text":"Great and pleasantly overwhelming beer selection! 
Food is pretty good. The House Mac n Cheese is pretty good.
Also, you cannot go wrong with the Street Tacos; they are all good;)"}
{"text":"Great reverse happy hour...

It's no secret mall employees like..errr need to have a few pau hana drinks so the reverse happy hour here is excellent. With tons of local and non local beers and ciders on tap, they even have some rarities like sam adams utopia.

Personally,  a discounted goose on the rocks with lime, along with the $6 uber crisp chicken strips with a $1 upgrade to sweet potato fries is a no brainer. By the time the second goose goes down I've all but forgotten about the daycare that is Scottsdale mall.. and after I blow in my breathalyzer app to ensure sheriff Joe doesn't have me putting in OT, I'm off to other adventures..

Note: Shawna? She is an excellent bartender if you get the pleasure, but I think she has brighter plans in her future so catch her if you can!"}
{"text":"Why is this place listed on Yelp twice?  Oh well, guess I'll just cut and paste my review from the other one-

How do you not love the Yardhouse?  Their menu is vast  with many great choices on pizzas, sandwiches, salads, appetizers, burgers, and some other entrees as well.  Their beer selection is HUGE- so many you won't know where to begin.  Luckily they sort it into different categories for you.  Service is usually decent as well.  You can sit on the patio and people watch or sit inside and watch the TVs.  I wish they had a better TV set up, but nobody's perfect."}
{"text":"Food was good, beer was awesome, REALLY dark though at the bar."}
{"text":"So.... this place is ridiculously overpriced. I went last night with the Bf and a couple friends. We wanted to get a couple beers and have some food. First of all, they do not list any prices for beers.... I think they should probably do that considering how ridiculously expensive their beer is. We asked the server for prices and she said 'They start around 4$ and then go up from there depending on the beer with an average of around 6$' Well... that's not really so helpful. I ordered the rose gaarden which is hoegaarden mixed with framboise lambic... it was good, until I found out it was almost 9$..... for a beer? What? That is the most expensive beer I have ever had. Our food was alright, but also ridiculously priced. I got the summer salad (strawberries, avocado, romaine, mandarin oranges from a can and balsamic). It was fine, but pretty small for a 9$ appetizer salad. Oh and if you want chicken on it, it's an extra 5$ or so.... that must be some amazing chicken. You can't get an entree salad or sandwich for less than 10$. I did get a cup clam chowder too, and it was not great and kind of luke warm when I got it... meh. Everyone else got sandwiches and said they were fine, but nothing special. I feel like just because the place has a lot of beers on tap does not mean they should charge double what anywhere else sells the same beers for. So anyway, for a sandwich, a salad, and 5 beers, our bill came out to about 65$. That will never ever happen again. I could go to a nice local non-chain restaurant in the valley and get better food for that kind of money, which is what I suggest everyone does."}
{"text":"I found the secret (or not so secret...) thing about this place! Happy Hour! I got the rose gaarden which is framboise and hoegaarden and it is wonderful...usually 8$, during HH it is 5.25. I went here yesterday with a group of old friends and we had a good time. The service was spotty, with us waiting for long periods of time to order...so much so that although we got there at 5 and HH is over at 6 we could only order one round of drinks before it was over. Pretty lame. I had the four cheese pizza (which was half off) but it wasn't anything special. This place is a serious ripoff generally, but the HH makes it tolerable."}
{"text":"Brought the family in last night around 5:30pm before our movie.  I believe our server was Shaun.  He was fantastic.  Attentive, polite, thorough.  He made it a very enjoyable visit.  Food was good.  Only negative was being told that there was a 10-20 minute wait with so many empty tables.  There were about 8 parties waiting to be sat.  No exaggeration, at least 30%-40% of the dining room tables were clean but empty.  Maybe short handed, I don't know.  Only reason why not 5 stars."}
{"text":"Great place for dinner. Large menu and nice decor. We ordered the Margarita Pizza, which was so good, we ordered A second . 

Prompt service and comfortable seating ."}
{"text":"I dig those nice, middle-priced bars/restaurants where you can reliably go every week, and they are consistent in quality and service. Yeah, I have to deduct a point because during busy sports seasons like NBA Finals or Football playoffs, the servers tend to not be as diligent, and the food portions get a little too small. Plus, the take-out service is lacking. I came one time and did not get my food promptly because the hostesses are more concerned with paying attention to the tables.

But enough of the negative. Good vibe, cool music, not too loud. Come at 3-6 for happy hour. I usually get the Pepper-Crusted Gorgonzola or the Fish and Chips. Appetizers are amazing, but be careful: Calamari is pretty small, but the Chicken Nachos are huge."}
{"text":"The hottest bar in Las Vegas is....The Yardhouse

B/f and I sat at the bar and each ordered the Belgian SIx Pack.  Six delicious beers, even if the somewhat mentally challenged bartender didn't put them in the order on the card and on the tray.  Like I can't taste the raspberry Lambic?  Hello???

Anyway, the beers were awesome. So many on tap and so many ways to try them. Loved the Belgians as well as the three cream ale shortys I tried.

Had wings, ribs and burger, as well as sundae and brownie for dessert. All the food was good.

If you can get Jon as your bartender at the bar, he is super awesome, nice, smart and funny.  Loved him!  The others were okay and I won't give you my opinion of CJ.  Let's just say it rhymes with \"bouche\".

In sum, loved the Yardhouse, loved the beer, loved the food. If you don't go there, you're clearly in need of serious help. For reals."}
{"text":"My hubby and I ate here before The Cardinal's winning NFC Championship Game.  No surprise that there was an hour and a half to two hour wait.  The big surprise was the complete organization and professionalism of this establishment!  Despite the throngs of customers, all hyped up for the game, the service and food were excellent.  We had to carb load to have energy for the game (ha!) so indulged in the gargantuan Chicken Nachos and the Sliders and Fries.  Our fries were lukewarm-but our server Christian immediately came back from the kitchen with crispy hot fries, before we could blink our eyes.  He was calm, cool and collected amidst all of the gazillion customers.  My only suggestion regarding the food is to season the chicken in the nachos.  It appeared to be steamed and unadorned.  Also serve with a side of salsa.  I sought out a Manager to compliment the restaurant on its efficient handling of the customers during a busy time.  Score a big win for the Cardinals-and The Yard House!"}
{"text":"We went to visit the Sprinkles Cupcake ATM & spotted Yard House so we decided to have lunch.  The food was great!  It was our first time eating here.  The waitress, I think her name was Ruby?, she was friendly & great.  The only negative was that my beer was warm...being that it was 106 degrees out, it would have been awesome to have a COLD beer!"}
{"text":"125 beers on tap and add boneless wings well you just got me coming back here for more"}
{"text":"I love yard house! Their food, the service and the beers are amazing! I haven't had a bad experience at any locations! Although it is on the strip, the restaurant is huge and a wait is very minimal. Maybe it's because I came on a Thursday night but everyone knows that any restaurant on the strip is always busy. I will definitely come back here and all other yard house locations"}
{"text":"It's very nice inside, open and inviting. If the noise from the Tv's weren't so incredibly loud it would have been much more pleasurable.  I left there with a headache because of the noise from the tv speakers and trying to have a conversation with my aunt. 

The food was quite good, I didn't order anything exciting. Tried the fries, salad and French onion soup. All three very good. My son got a pizza and it looked and tasted like a frozen pizza or at
Least cheese that had been frozen. I did take a nibble and it wasn't the greatest pizza. He didn't eat very much of it because he didn't like it much.  

The service was awesome considering they were hella busy and the facility was incredibly clean."}
{"text":"Absolutely awful food, 2 stars only because the servers tried so hard to accommodate. The shrimp vodka pasta inedible (how do you ruin pasta?) and the kale salad arrived mostly romaine with boxed croutons. We had been to the Yard House before and reasonably satisfied. It is now on the never again list."}
{"text":"Great food, extensive beer menu, comfortable vibe and a whole Gardein vegetarian / vegan section of the menu!  Lettuce wraps, turkey burger, gardein chicken sandwich and sweet ff were all top notch.  Amazing customer service. I told my waiter about my food allergies and everyone was so completely thorough about not only checking for the things that would make me sick, but making sure the dish worked without them. The manager came out and spoke with me for at least 15 minutes. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"The patio out front is really cool. You can enter the restaurant from inside the hotel or from outside. The patio is off the outside entrance. There are TVs outside and fire elements along with heaters. We sat here and had good food and service. We started with one waiter who ended up being sent home  early because the place was not busy. Our replacement servers of a waiter and a trainee were very friendly and helpful as well. We shared the summer salad which was very good. I also enjoyed the jambalaya. With this dish you are given the option of three types of carbs for it to be based on - I chose brown rice. This is a beer lovers place - lots of drafts in big glasses."}
{"text":"At least I'll always this clogged artery. 

My tummy is rumbling at me as I think about what to write about the Yard House. But I daren't go back there. It's too tempting. Too good. I can't go without gorging. I happily order three or four dishes, just because I can't decide. 

Yes, I'm raving. Yes, hyperbole is never attractive. Yes, it's just that good.

First, a warning: Alphabetically working your way through all 100+ draft beers may sound like a good idea. All of my friends and I have independently decided that this is a briliant plan. It is not. Man was not meant to sample that much beer.

The menu could go toe-to-toe with War and Peace. It's epic. It will shatter any prejudice you may have had about restaurants that lack a focused menu. It has executed every meal perfectly. Perfectly.

The service is top-notch. I've tried to hire away a few of them to work in sales (none of them took the offer, which just goes to show they're smart, too).

I'm really stretching to find the negatives. On the weekends, there's a long wait. The servers don't know beer very well, but usually have a few recommendations. They turn the music up too loud after 11PM or so."}
{"text":"When I crave a cold brew, this is the place I go to! I love all the variety of beers to choose from mild ales to dark tasty stouts! The bartenders are very friendly and fun! The Hawaiian Poke Stack is the best appetizer around! I have been to all the locations including the Long Beach one and my favorite is at Red Rock Hotel! It is close to home and convenient to all my other favorite places!"}
{"text":"Probably the fourth time I have gone to this Yard House. Service continues to be excellent.  Our server was Alex and he was great and completely knowledgeable in the menu and more importantly could rattle off about 90% of the beer selection.  I had the beef dip and a cup of chowder.  All good stuff. 

The menu has a great variety I options so it has a broad appeal. 

Really though. It's about the service.  Lots of good people."}
{"text":"Went here last night for dinner to try again after my last visit. I have to say the service was prompt and our drinks came out almost immediately. Tim was our waiter first (then it changed to Heather later in the evening). 

I ordered the California roll for an appetizer, and it was superb. The food took a little time to come out, but honestly the place was packed so I understand.

For dinner we ordered the Mac and cheese and the applewood smoked bacon burger. Both entrees were piping hot, and delicious, which satisfied my disappointment over my last visit. Heather took great care of us, and because of her I will be back."}
{"text":"This place is freeeegin awesome. Not only does it have my favorite Jamaican Jerk WINGS! But this place brews some yummy beer, like my all time favorite Snake Bite! Food here is awesome. Although, this was my first time and I really haven't got a chance to taste the menu, I still recommend coming here. In fact, there is a Yard House that just opened up back in San Jose and I'll definitely being going there for sure. 

Me and the wifey shared a meal, we had the Jambalaya with rice. It wasn't as spicy that I expected, but boy was it yummy. What was kind of ehhh was my sons food, he ordered the Mac N' Cheese and it tasted a bit weird, maybe it's because I'm use to eating Mac N' Cheese from the box or Yard House's Mac N' Cheese was just odd. It had a weird texture to it that I really wasn't comfortable eating. My son also had clam chowder to go with his meal, that was good, but I still rather goto a warf to getting chowder.

I seriously need to try more off their menu (poki, ahi, sushi/sashimi looks yummmmy), and this place just might be my all time favorite restaurant to eat at. This place does get packed at night on the weekends and when I say packed, I really mean it gets PACKED! So I wouldn't recommend coming here around those times if you're really hungry.

JERK WINGS + FRESHLY BREWED BEER = SATISFIED!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place when staying at the LINQ. Walked right in and was prompted seated. The menu can please everyone in your crowd. So many different options ranging from asian, to BBQ, to Spanish, to your typical American fare. 

We started with french onion soup which was tasty. For meals, we ordered a BBQ chicken salad and an Ahi Tuna Sandwich.  They have two size portions for the salads. I thought the smaller size was the perfect amount of food. It wasn't overly dresses either which is hard to find. The Ahi tuna sandwich was pretty dang good. The tuna was thick and well prepared. It came with fries which were soooo good. And they came out HOT! which is something so simple but something that rarely happens which dining out. 

I also thought the menu items were fairly priced. The interior of the restaurant was also pleasing as it is very open and still lets you see the hustle and bustle on the strip. Recommend!"}
{"text":"You'd be surprised how much is closed in Vegas on a weekday night as far as food options. Living here, it's amazing how few choices there really are for late night food. Luckily, reverse Happy Hour happens late at night, which is why on my most recent visit, I was here with Justin G. (6/18/14.)

I've been here before for dinner and this place is pricey. Happy Hour is definitely the way to go if you wanna try this place out. While I won't go over what I've had here before in detail, I will say that many of the entrées are quite bland.

Justin and I ordered a pepperoni and mushroom pizza, garlic noodles and chicken nachos. It was a HUGE amount of food and came out to $18. 

Pizza - according to Justin, \"I feel like pizza is pizza. It's hard to get bad pizza anywhere.\" 

Noodles - terrible. Would not get again. I asked them to not put tofu in the noodles, but didn't notice that the noodles were covered in edamame. These were not only covered in toxic legumes,  they were bland and had no garlic taste whatsoever. Skip for time and all eternity. 

Nachos - good. Too many beans. Would definitely order sans beans (uggggh) and would have been better with hot sauce.

Place is very loud and very busy. At 10:30 PM, there was a line to get in to be seated. That either speaks to how good this place is or how few options are in Vegas on a late Wednesday night for food.

Edited to add: They do not have good Ranch. They need to get their dressing game on lock because it is shameful."}
{"text":"This location is great and they have covered patio seating. They also have two stories, which I haven't seen at any other Yard House location. This is probably my favorite one out of all the ones in Vegas. I didn't have to wait at all for a table and the service was incredibly fast. I got the sliders and lobster crab artichoke dip from the appetizers and it was really good. The dip is amazing! I could just eat a huge bucket of it with my bare hands. If you come here, be sure to sit on the patio. It's the best spot to people watch and enjoy your beer with some great food!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is in Town Square, as I'm sure you can tell by the name. The food here is really good and they have a large variety of beers and ciders. I love the fact that they have about 8 different cider choices. I'm a big cider fan and get annoyed when all restaurants serve is Angry Orchard. They also have cocktails here that are delish! 

I ordered the grilled cheese and tomato bisque. It was not my first time ordering it and won't be the last. I like to dip the grilled cheese into the bisque and it's perfection! My husband ordered the cuban sandwich and it comes with a delicious broth you dip your sandwich. Although it is not your traditional cuban sandwich, it was still really good. The service here is always very fast. I've never had to wait long for my food. The prices are reasonable and they have happy hour here Monday through Friday. It's the place to go if you want to watch sports, relax, get a drink and grub on some yummy food."}
{"text":"Every time I come to this yardhouse the service is great. Sometimes there's a small wait but it's expected for a place like this. Swordfish tacos are delicious... Always recommended. Beer selection is wide obviously. Can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Would give it one star but the beer was good food sucked paid $20.00 for overcooked chicken breast mashed potatoes and two small nuked sides very dissatisfied and my $3.50+ ice tea although I did like my dinner salad. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Hands down the best resturant. I have been to other locations within the chain, and they are packed. This location did not have a wait (on a Sunday night), and the waiter was on top of things! Great drinks (Pineapple Express is delicious), amazing food (Chicken nachos), and really great people. Just an excellent location from a great chain!"}
{"text":"The best customer service started as soon as we sat down at the bar! The manager Jeff greeted us at the bar and went over the changes on the menu (items taken off and added) and the bartenders Jason and Tory were very attentive. Answered our questions about the menu and beers. Checked up on us frequently. Friendly people! I had the house honey blonde and of course it was refreshing!"}
{"text":"I used to go to the Yard House in Newport Beach, CA, often and loved it - the food, drinks and atmosphere. We came with a party of 10 and had to wait close to 30 min just for them to tell us how long the wait would be for our party. We finally decided to split our party into two groups so we could be seated faster. Our table ordered several dishes - lobster macaroni and cheese, pasta, pork rib appetizers and salad. Overall, nothing was very flavorful or tasty. The food quality has definitely declined which is a huge bummer. I would not rerun to this location."}
{"text":"Love YardHouse happy hour! appetizers are to die for. The service is always outstanding."}
{"text":"Yep, I'm done. 

First, the dude that hosts late night (Vince?) seems completely and totally miserable. He's been like that several times now, even when my outgoing husband has tried to engage him in a convo, it's just not happening. That dude either hates life, people, his job, or all three. Not a fun way to start the night.

So we ended up there Thursday night just because I wanted the Dunkelweizen. Waitress says they don't have it, they're phasing it out, says she'll bring me a tester of a similiar one. Ok. 

Comes back with another dude who says they're not phasing it out, he thinks they're just out but maybe they have an untapped keg in back. He'll go check. Next thing I know a different guy drops off a pint of some other beer. I take a few sips and it's fine, but not the dunkel and I am confused why it was given to me. 

I figure I'll ask the waitress and in the meantime our apps are dropped off by yet another guy. Truffle fries tasted fine, but were cold. Hummus was weird. Couldn't figure out if it was old, over-seasoned, or had been dropped in a dirt pile and scooped back into the bowl. Kept finding weird super dark patches, so that's a no.

All this time while we're sort of eating,  I am taking sips of the beer because 1. I'm thirsty and have nothing else to drink and 2. Our waitress has pulled the famous Yard House dissappearing act. She finally shows up and I ask her why I have this beer \"Oh, that's the one I was telling you about that tastes like the dunkel\" I said, I thought you were bringing me a tester? Blank stare from her...I say, I wouldn't have ordered this one...She says \"well, I can take it away?\" I said I've already had half of it while waiting for you to come back...more awkward silence and finally she says I can charge you for a shorty? I say sure, fine and she leaves

Keep in mind we never ordered dinner, and when she was at the table our fries were gone, we are not eating the hummus and she proceeds to dissappear for TWENTY minutes. We sat there, not eating, I'm not drinking (husband was drinking soda which was getting replaced by a busser, I think) and we are desperately staring down every server in the place trying to telepathically beg for the check. That is when I added my not so favorable check in because I was pissed. We finally spot our waitress and practically yell out for the check and she seems genuinely surprised (REALLY?!?!) so I guess she was super clueless about us not having an enjoyable time. 

Luckily we had cash, so we could bail without waiting another 20 minutes for a credit transaction, and have vowed to never ever ever go to Yard House again."}
{"text":"Good service and food. Big selections of draft beers, but their beers needs to be more cold maybe around 32*-29 degree.
All in all good place to dine and have a drink."}
{"text":"Having finished up with a few errands and hunger took all decision making skills from the wife and I, we settled on Yard House, as we hadn't been there in a while and the food seemed good on previous visits.

We were told it would be 15-20 minutes for a table in the very packed restaurant, no problem, we will enjoy the padded seats for a bit. By the time we sat down and got comfortable, our pager went off, and to the table we ventured.

Weaving through groves of people, we arrived at a table toward the back of the restaurant, furthest from the kitchen. I think the host was trying to talk to us during the trip, however, it is so ungodly loud in there, that I couldn't hear a word he was saying.

Flipping through the menu, neither of us remembered it being that expensive and of course, our lack of decision making skills due to hunger kicked in again and nothing looked good.

I, for the second time in the night, settled and chose the four cheese pizza. One type of food that I had expressly stated I did not want prior to arriving. Oh well, can't win them all.

It seemed to take forever for our server to bring two glasses of water, almost as if they made her go to Lake Mead, fill a jug with water, bring it to a purification center, then make some ice cubes and finally, deliver filled ice water glasses to our table.

Our orders were taken and again, it seemed like an eternity for the food to get delivered. It was an OK pizza, about what you would expect from a non-pizza-centric establishment. I did find it odd though, that the crust was soaked with grease or water or something, and was as flimsy as a wet noodle.

Finishing the food, the service seemed to pick up, plates were cleared almost the instant they were clean, the check was dropped off, a moment later, was picked up, with our payment. Then... the waiting began again. I think Yard House makes the staff bring the credit cards to the issuing bank to extract their funds.

Once we were able to reclaim our card and head to the exit, the wife was almost bowled over by an employee that was on a mission. Escaping into the very windy night, we both agreed this was our last visit to Yard House for the foreseeable future."}
{"text":"Customer service is OUTSTANDING! after a complaint, The Yardhouse pulled out all the stops, and to top it off, I had an absolutely superior meal.
Strongly recommend the Yardhouse..........Thanks Kristie and Carrie! This will be my goto place in Vegas from now on."}
{"text":"This location is HUGE!

I was here on a first date recently - we just met to have a couple of beers and get to know each other (as you do on first dates!). This seemed like a good location for us to meet....

Parking is easy, if you park in the large lot near the High Roller. There was lots of seating, both in the bar and restaurant. We sat at the bar, which was crowded, but not packed (surprisingly crowded on a Wednesday).

The service was friendly and they (of course) had a lot of beers. I have never really been much of a fan of the selection at Yard House - it's always seemed like more quantity than quality, but it seems they've made some adjustments. There were some local beers available, and I was also able to try a few IPA's I'd never had before.

Prices are high, which is to be expected. I didn't even notice if they offer happy hour like other locations, and we didn't have any food, so I can't comment on that.....

Overall, a good experience and if I am in the area, I will stop by again!"}
{"text":"Strike 2 against Yard House.

My last review wasn't exactly positive, which is to be expected when you get moldy bread on your sandwich and don't notice (due to your hunger) until after devouring HALF of the thing. Yuck.  After that experience I received an e-mail from the manager apologizing and offering a free dinner.  I never responded and hadn't been back since.  I don't want free things, I just want your kitchen to send out non-moldy bread!

Anyhow, my Mom and I were in the area and decided to stop in on a Sunday night for dinner.  It was pretty crowded, but we were sat immediately and approached by a friendly server, who took our drinks/appetizer order.  I have to add....if you know anything about beer, the list is nothing but long.  There is really nothing exciting about it.  Anyhow, our beers came out quickly and our server took our order.  I figured our app should be out any minute, but instead we sat there waiting and waiting and waiting....until BOOM! Our entrees came out.  We told the food runner that we never received our app, and he said he would be happy to take our food back and have our app sent out, or he could just make sure we aren't charged for it and leave our dinner.  Uh, no....we are hungry and ordered an app, we want it.  So he takes our food back and I start worrying that I am going to either end up with moldy bread again, or our entrees were going to sit under a heat lamp until we were ready for them.....I saw our server talking with a Manager, who then came over to our table to apologize for the error and that our crab/lobster/artichoke dip would be out momentarily and that she would ensure our meals were made fresh. (Also that the app would be no charge) Once we received it, the dip was really good and it disappeared quickly.  Our entrees were fresh when we received them, and I did not have moldy bread. (WHEW!) Our server also apologized and said that it was his error, which I know isn't easy.  Now, all of this may not seem like that big of a deal, but after my previous experience and having not returned to the restaurant in over a year after the moldy bread, it is just really disappointing.  I used to go to Yard House almost every Sunday with a big group of friends, and we loved the food and service.  Now it seems like both have gone downhill and I am not sure if I will find another reason to go back.  It was very generous of the manager to comp our app, but I am not looking for free food.  I just want my order to come out correctly, in a timely manner, and without mold. Is that too much to ask?  Apparently so.  Unfortunately, I think that Yard House has gotten lost in the shuffle of getting tourists in and out as quickly as possible....

Just an FYI....I was a server in college and I understand that mistakes happen.  Our server still received 20% tip after this debacle, as I only thought it was fair to tip based off what the check would have been, if the appetizer would've been charged."}
{"text":"REALLY REALLY busy on game days (Cardinals).  Get there early or you will be in a long line.

Luckily, when we arrived, there was no line.  They were checking ID's at the door and you had to be 21 to enter? Or they were helping their staff by checking ID's and giving wristbands so you could just order once inside.  Either way, no sweat.

It's a typical Yard House - extensive beer selection, but nothing particularly \"unique.\"  The food is standard and consistent and the service is fairly fast and friendly.

This entire area is extremely crowded on game days, so be prepared to wait or get there early!"}
{"text":"It reminds me of cheesecake factory except it's a sport bar version of it.

Food is decent. I like the happy hour, come for happy hour!!! Well, I just eat food at happy hour so I won't be able to comment as much about the drinks.

I do like the pomegranate mojito though but I don't think it's on the happy hour menu.

I ordered the onion ring tower. Yum. So much foodddd - share it, share it, share it! It's pretty good. Some people who doesn't like onion rings really like this one. 

The poke on the happy hour is good too.

Ahi crunchy (the salad) is delicious as well, the tuna is fresh and I love the freshness of the veggies and the sweet/sour of the dressing. I want more of it!

Yardhouse is the perfect place to come to enjoy beer on tap and watch a sporting game or just hang out with friends. It has a casual, fun, sporty atmosphere and the wait staff does their best to be accommodating as well. Great for large groups!

...free Wi-Fi as well!!!!

Note: Not bad for a chain restaurant, not bad....(nodding head in approval)"}
{"text":"Love this place!! The food is great along with the service! I love the chicken lettuce wraps and the truffle fries are amazing!! Pretty much everything there is wonderful! They deliver too which is awesome!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by two weeks ago on a Sunday for lunch. Service was great as the place was pretty empty. The food, however, was the worst we have ever had. This is my husband's favorite place to eat so it was very disappointing. The entrees were so cold it was like they were from the day before. We should have said something but didn't."}
{"text":"Yardhouse is always solid. Good food and great drinks. Doesn't fail no matter which one you go to. I just had the first ever Yardhouse blended mule cocktail from their outside walk up bar. I tried the Hawaiian with Skyy Pineapple Vodka. Delicious."}
{"text":"My man flew me out for a day trip to Vegas
so I could watch the Super Bowl with him and his friends. After winning four bands at Red Rock the couple we were with suggested we head here for dinner. We were seated right away in a large corner booth. 

Service was good. Ambiance is great. My petite filet was OK, his jambalaya was spectac. The mini creme brûlée was Ah. Maze. Ing."}
{"text":"Popped in here for a late night second dinner. The ahi tuna salad was incredible! I usually don't go for \"Asian\" salads (my people don't eat salad so idk what that is) but the price was unbeatable for seared tuna. I also ordered their house white ale, which was great, and their beer selection as a whole is immense. My host and server were both super sweet. Good music."}
{"text":"Pricey, but the food is pretty good. It's a nice place to go for dinner with family or friends. They even have outdoor seating, which is great for when the weather is nice and you feel like people-watching."}
{"text":"My honey and I went here around 9:45 PM on Thursday (8/11). I wish I could remember our server's name but he was lovely. The inside was nice and cool so we sat in the dining room. Our server had to run back and forth for the people who chose to sit in the nasty heat outside. I told him that I had my teeth worked on so I couldn't eat anything too hard and he suggested the veggie mac n cheese. It was good but not as good as I remember it, which was a little disappointing. Maybe it was just an off night. I hope. He reminded us that happy hour was just around the corner so I got a beer on HH.
I wanted to write this review mainly for our server who had a good attitude and gave us great service."}
{"text":"Love their vegan options (especially their vegan BBQ chicken pizza) and their Moscow mules! Great service and fun atmosphere"}
{"text":"The more times I visit my son, the more sports bars I get introduced to in the phoenix area. If nothing else, I know my son doesn't go to dive sports bar. This is another upscale sports bar he introduced to mom and dad. We went to lunch on A Saturday 01-07/12 around 1pm.

The restaurant was not crowded, a light crowd on a sunny beautiful 70 degree? Phoenix day. My son was meeting some people in the area, so my wife and I had a light lunch and he met us afterwards. 

What we had

Lunch size Ahi Crunch and french onion soup with salad and Iced Green Tea.  That was it for my wife and I. Total plus tax $23.70.  We weren't very Hungry this day.

As others have said, if you want beer, lots of variety and want to come back every day for for two years and never repeat your beer order, this is the place to visit. 

If you want to have a party for the football season, or any type of sporting event, have it here, they offer a good variety of party platters, and it's not your regular wings and potatoe skins and fried veggies and cheese thingys.  Party platters offered:

Moo shu egg rolls,    Seared Rare Ahi Sashimi, Thai Chicken Noodle, Penne with Chicken and Peach apple cobbler just to name a few items. 

A place like this, I could get use to going whether or not there's a sporting event going on.  

I read there is at least one in Denver Colorado area if not two. I will definitely check it out.

Our server was very friendly and it was very relaxing to sit out on the patio for lunch.  We will definitely come back to the yard house, whether it's here or in Denver to see further what Yard House has to offer"}
{"text":"We keep going back.  Because the food is fabulous, the service is awesome - and Floyd, the manager we have met several times, well, he is fantastic!  It is nice to have someone making sure you are pleased with your meal and happy to help if things aren't going just right.  LOVE LOVE LOVE this restaurant!  I guess that is why we keep... going... back...  :)"}
{"text":"Whenever i feel the need to add some extra lbs, clog my arteries, and work on my beer gut I come here. So obviously i try to avoid this place like the plague for my own sanity. But when I have one of those \"ah screw it\" moment I get the mac and cheese squared. I think it only has 398,000 calories which 397,456 are from fat but how can you resist? Different types of cheeses, chicken, bacon, mushrooms, truffle oil. I think i may be bold enough to say its one of the best macaroni and cheese dishes you may have.

I think everything I've had here has been decently good, when i try and eat healthy I'll order their chicken and veggie bowl. It probably has enough salt to flavor a sunflower seed factory but for it being somewhat low in fat and full in veggies, its pretty good. All in all not too many complaints, bad for my cholesterol levels and liver but hey we can still be friends Yardhouse."}
{"text":"It was my first time at this location and we came just in time for happy hour. We ordered and shared poke nachos and ribeye with shrimp skewers. Everything was delicious and their drinks are strong! I tried a watermelon drink, can't remember the name of it but it was great. Our server checked on us a few times and he was very friendly."}
{"text":"Second time here and I wasn't disappointed we sat outside and it was a good choice. We ordered calamari, chicken nachos and poke nachos big portions and also got the seared ahi sandwich.  There was no happy hour tonight it's only Sunday through Wednesday 10-closing.  And they also have one during the day time."}

I had the French Onion Soup ((perfect) and the CHICKEN GARLIC NOODLES - chopped chicken, asparagus, spinach, shiitake mushrooms, smoked tofu, parmesan & edamame - AMAZING. I can't wait to go back. The menu is large & diverse. I wanted to try so much. We were there for lunch on a wednesday and it was not crowded and the service"}

Brother had the Old Fashioned"}
{"text":"Over a hundred beers on tap but I could only make my way through three of them. Most unfortunate, I will have to return.

My waitress was really cool with me taking up a table for three for two hours because my friends apparently don't know how to read a clock very well. While I waited, I had a \"snack\" sampler of Hummus which was excellent and loaded in garlic. The beers were nice and cold, if perhaps a little spendy at $6+ each.

Nice restaurant to hang out and to meet up with friends. I really enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"Everything about this restaurant is great. I am surprised that the yelp page says it is not wheelchair accessible. As a lifetime user of one, I can assure you that they have gone far beyond what I have seen in other establishments in regards to accessibility. Other restaurants should follow their example. I love the way the tables are adjustable to suit a person in a wheelchair. I don't know how many they have in each franchise but if they have one available they will do their best to make sure a person who is best served by sitting at this table does so. 
The food is awesome and affordable, especially for the location. I look forward to going here again during my next LV trip in a few weeks. I am really only writing this review to mention that it is DEFINITELY wheelchair accessible, contrary to what the Yelp page says."}

I had a super tasty NY steak sandwich.
Staff was really friendly, place was clean with TVs for almost every viewing angle.
Music was good if not a tad loud. Awesome beer selection. I would not hesitate to return....actually, I wish I lived closer."}
{"text":"This place has earned our repeat business. 
Got here at 557pm, and we snuck in with happy hour prices before the 6pm deadline. 

This place is hoppin'. Although the ambiance might be a bit loud for some, we came here with our five year old and it was absolutely fine.  

TV screens abound with sports, although I gotta say that the draw for us is the food.  

We have been going to BJs around the corner for 7 years, and never have this a shot.  That's changing going forward.   

The service is prompt and efficient.  And friendly, too. 

Try the calamari. Two sauces accompany this appetizer.  Both are great!

The street tacos are what are going to keep me coming back. I had the Korean short ribs, Korean pork belly, chicken tinga, and skirt steak.  All winners!

The blackened swordfish tacos are also winners. 

Of course, the draw of this place is the variety of beers. But a nice little surprise with this particular location is the quality and caliber of the cuisine.

If you are looking for a nice weekend meal with a family with or without kids, this is definitely a good and worthy choice."}
{"text":"The food is not good & everything is overpriced. You're paying higher prices because it's Scottsdale. 
 The only good thing is that they have a larger selection of draft beers than most places."}
{"text":"Just like their other locations the Happy Hour (3-6pm) is great & well worth checking out.  You get $1 off beers and select half price appetizers.

We had the firecracker wings and the turkey burger sliders - both were very good.

We shared the salted caramel (or it might be butterscotch) dessert which was also great.

Can't wait for my next visit to a Yard House & continue to wish they would open a location in NM."}
{"text":"Went here for Happy Hour (3-6pm) which gets you cheaper drinks and some half price appetizers.

There were three of us and so we tried the firecracker wings (which I had eaten before and are fantastic); onion ring tower (they honestly were kind of soggy) and the pastrami sliders (they were decent, but the pastrami had no spice/flavor really).

The draft selection at this restaurant chain is crazy - always too many to pick from.

I would definitely go back to try some more of the appetizers and maybe the other 100+ beers I have yet to try!"}
{"text":"I arrived just in time for Happy Hour (3-6pm) - finding this place from inside the Scottsdale Fashion Mall is a tad tricky, from the outside it is a little easier.

I ordered the Firecracker Wings (traditional) and they were excellent.

I also had the salted caramel butterscotch pudding which was very tasty.

The happy hour deals on food are excellent and I would encourage any of you to check them out (at all Yard Houses).

Maybe one day we will have one in ABQ :-("}
{"text":"Amber, you're the consummate server! Thank you!! We had a great time at YH. Merlot really packs a punch ! The steak salad was fantastic but pricey. They don' t offer a lunch size. Of course I had to order some of their delicious g fries. It' s dark inside and very cozy. The seating booths are comfortable and very ample. This was a special BY for 2 of us and Amber didn' let down us down with beautiful desserts that were complementary. Nice display of \"birthday\" in brown sugar. Awesome! 1 star less because the manager came over and told us someone complained about  our loudness and language. Why were 2 small children and mom seated nearby? It was nearly empty with most people outside. We're an exuberant bunch of ladies not intintended for little ears.  It put the kibosh on festivities."}
{"text":"I don't usually review chains because well they are chains and they have a million reviews what more could I say?  However I felt like my experience was worth it, for what it is.  We were staying at Red Rock and needed a bite to eat before a movie. It happened to be Happy Hour and we ordered three things.  Hubby ordered queso dip and fried Mac n cheese and I ordered a pepperoni and mushroom pizza.  Absolutely no complaints.  Service was fast and efficient and food was good. 

The fried Mac n cheese I was like NO don't get because well how addicting are they. And it came out presented so cute and sure enough I'm like get an order to go (we didn't) but still - be careful with those things.  

Solid place to go especially for Happy Hour- many options offered at half price. Can't say anything about the drinks because we didn't have any.

Also we sat outside- nice covered outdoor area!"}

{"text":"Perfect Friday night in Vegas.  As a local we avoid the Strip usually.  But the LINQ/WHEEL area is so nice, so easy to go to with convenient valet.  We love the Yard House: whether we sit outside, at the bar, or on the roof balcony.  Food great choices.  I love the appetizers: Hummus/pita, Edamame/spicy, Garlic noodles and new to try this time- Kale Salad full of so many yummy additions.  My Red Sangria made to order without Honey and not too sweet we sooo good. My guy always finds a nice Dark/thick beer.  Thanks for being consistent in the food and service.  This is one of our 'go to places'!"}

Service was outstanding. Shout out to Cheryl our lovely waitress. 
Bonus, they have restrooms! 
It really is a sports bar craft beer place but again, my drinks were good.
It just missed a perfect rating due to noise level. It wasn't full when we went and we had to shout to be heard. But hey, that's really on me, it is a bar.....
Bottom line, I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great customer service! Great food. I never had to wait when I had went, but if I ever had to, it would be worth it. Food did not take long to come out. It is a little pricey. Overall, a nice experience. Would definitely be going again."}
{"text":"I go here nearly every other week with my friends, it's our go-to lunch/dinner restaurant! So many delicious options. Love this place!"}
{"text":"We had a party  of about 12.  Someone in our party let the hostess know that we may need one additional table as we have some unexpected guests.  The hostess seemed bothered and annoyed that god forbid we have more people to come in and spend money.  My apologies sweet heart!   Ordered drinks first and after 15 minutes of just sitting there I got up and found a \"manager\".  I wanted to enlighten him on the wait so far just for drinks.  He looked at me with the most puzzled look on his face and said these exact words \" I am sure they will be out soon\"  I guess 15 minute wait was acceptable for him. Drinks finally showed up and after the long wait, Paige our waitress informs my girlfriend they do not have the type of beer she ordered.  She then just asked for a Blue Moon.  Wow! just wow!  I got out of my seat and went to bar to buy the blue moon myself.  This is ridiculous! 

The table ordered appetizers which included Calamari, wings, some sort of spinach dip.  It all came out at the same time, Great right? Maybe now we can just let the rough start go.  Apps were dropped off and everyone looks around like \"who's going to eat calamari with their fingers?\" No app plates were brought and everyone just had to scoop the food with there hands since there were no plates to serve our selves.  

I am usually not one to write such bad reviews.(look at my past reviews) but this place was absolutely ridiculous!"}
{"text":"I loved this place the first time I went.  I went for Happy Hour (half-priced beers/appetizers, 3PM-6PM I believe) and it is a beer drinkers heaven.  Over a hundred beers ON TAP.  I had a Spaten Optimator, Guinness, Black and Tan, a Dark Castle, and a Warstein Dunkel.  As you can see, they've got a great selection of dark beers.  $3-$4 each, which is great.  Also, my wife and I shared a pretty big appetizer pizza that was, like, $4. 

The atmosphere is standard bar/restaurant fare.  They play good music (classic/alternative rock) and it doesn't get too loud.

Make sure you go early to happy hour, or you'll wait for a seat."}
{"text":"While I have not tried the food here, I cannot comment on that. I have although tried many beers here. Excellent and numerous beer choices on tap to suit anyone. Atmosphere at this location at Fashion Square is great."}
{"text":"Noisy, packed, typical chain. Hard to talk and enjoy conversation over the din.  Food was fine, had the poke nachos - different and tasty. Might come back, but will go to the one at Red Rock; it's not as loud...have been back to the stove Center location, this time on a Saturday. Wasn't as noisy. Got the pole nachos again - were better this time for some reason (???). Hostess tried to sit 3 adult women next to a table with a bunch of little kids...really? We asked to be moved and she got flustered. Great waiter (darn-it, I wish I could remember his name) funny and personable. Still the same star rating but a much more enjoyable time spent at yard house this time."}
{"text":"I dont like writing reviews on chains-but this is different. In the linq on the outdoor patio the view of the high roller is awesome. Nothing like sitting outside on a warm vegas nite with one of the delicious brewskis from the huge selection in your paw. And while the food is ok-nothing to get fired up about-the service every time we go is great. They are busy yet service doesnt suffer. Much props to the staff. So with a great view-awesome beer selection and great service, this location definitely warrants 4 stars!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I waited so long to write a review (it's been a month since I was there). We stayed at the Linq  and was looking for a place to eat.  I researched beforehand because my bf is Vegetarian. Heard that Yard House serves Gardein dishes. A little skeptical because my boyfriend doesn't like a lot of food and sticks to the basics. Also, I will say I was being a little selfish...I wanted to try their Truffle Burger (me no vegetarian). 

Our server was really bright and cheerful (I'm not great at remembering names). She took our drink orders and kept them coming throughout the whole meal. So, my boyfriend ordered the Gardein Grilled Chicken and Avocado Sandwich with fries (I was still skeptical). And, I did order the Black Truffle Cheeseburger with tomato bacon jam & fries.  Oh my gosh!!!  They were both mouthwatering!!!  So scrumptious.  My bf said I found a winner. And, he does not enjoy a lot of different foods.  You do not know what this means. 

Of course we came back the next day to check out some other dishes on the menu. Our server was a guy today (still did not remember names, sorry). Same thing, bright & cheerful and kept our drinks coming. 

This time I ordered the Sweet Potato Fries with Maple Bacon Cream Dip (ask for more if you run out of dip). Oh my gosh, these were the best tasting fries ever and I could eat the dip all day long!!!  Phenomenal. Also ordered the Pear and Gorgonzola Flatbread. Said it was in the Snack section. Was bigger than snack portions. And it was amazing. My bf ordered the Chopped Salad, Tomato Bisque and the Mini Peach Apple Cobbler. He loved, loved, loved his order as well. So much so that he called the Manager over and told him how much we loved both visits, complimented both servers for both days and explained how much he loved the meal. I mean...this is big with him because with him being Vegetarian, not a lot of great choices out there.  Coupled with the fact that he is finicky. But, he was so impressed with this restaurant. The manager asked us where we are from (L.A.) and let us know there's some here as well. WE WILL BE FREQUENTING THEM. And, also will be coming back to this location as he is a Poker Tournament player and we visit Vegas often. 

So happy to have found this place. Thank you all at Yard House."}
{"text":"Food was good.  My husband particularly enjoyed the Korean pork belly tacos, he said the flavors were right on.  He spent a year in Korea so he would know.  I had the jambalaya and it was good, but not amazing. However, they were out of the appetizer we wanted, and we waited FOREVER for everything!  They were busy, yes, but it's a weekend so they should expect to be busy!  I also thought the portions were small for the prices.  The shoestring fries were a pathetic phoned-in effort, and my son said his spaghetti tasted like a cheap school lunch.  For dropping over $80 on LUNCH for 4 people, I expected to be raving.  I'm not.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"I'm right here seating at the bar, I've been here for 15 minutes and Christian the bartender in training keeps ignoring me every time I try to order my drink. He's just talking to his co-worker doesn't seem to be so busy."}
{"text":"Amazing experience here.... I use to work for the one in Rancho Cucamonga but the one here In Vegas is awesome. And I probably would have to owe all the credit to Bernard our server who was polite, knowledgeable, attentive, and just a delight to talk to! You are awesome!!! From one server to another stay awesome! 

And the food is always good and drinks as well! Had to give the yard house credit!"}
{"text":"We always get great service, the food is always delicious, and the atmosphere is bubbly.  Know that during peak hours, you may wait a bit for a table, and the drinks are PRICEY, but it's worth it for the consistency."}
{"text":"Yardhouse is the cat's tophat! Monstrous selection of beers on tap and tasty eats. 

Las Vegas is a really terrible beer city, so this place is an oasis. Drinking delicious craft and localish (west coast) beers out of a 3 foot tall glass makes me feel like the president.

It's usually pretty dark inside, but they have a great patio seating area so you can choose your preferred ambiance. 

The food is upscale American dishes, but not snooty. I would strongly recommend the freakin SOUTHERN CHICKEN BREAST....also have had the roast beef dip sandwich, chicken with penne, and burgers. All very good and the fries are small and skinny like a baby's shoestrings and are money.

Only thing to avoid is the margherita pizza. It made my girlfriend emit garlic from her pores for two days afterwards and she lost a job because of it.

Just joking on the job, but the smell was very real and pungent."}
{"text":"Nice location at the Linq Promenade. Very loud establishment! It's hard to have a conversation in there. Not a good date place.

The people that work there are super nice and attentive, and always checked to see if we needed anything, that's Key!

The food was ok, not the best. The guacamole we had to send back as it was brown and not tasty. The second one we got was fresh but still bland, we had to add lots of salt and pepper to get some flavor. 

We went at Happy Hour, so nothing really to complain about, as the prices are really decent. 
Nice place to visit if you're in the area.

Me go back? Ahhh, maybe, if I was cruising that area and was hungry, but wouldn't go otherwise."}
{"text":"We have been to the other locations and never had issues until today. This was my second time in this location. The first time I was here the service was very slow. 

Today:

1- our food took forever! When it finally got there, my husband's Gardein burger was cold. Not warm... Cold! All fries on all plates were not even warm. 

2- we ordered our little one a grilled cheese and it was nothing but grease. I get it that we order a sandwich like that but I can make a better and healthier option for my child. 

3- our server took a break during our time there which is totally understandable but communication seemed to be lacking as when the other server dropped the check they charged my husband for two portions because they had to make him a new one. Then we had to get a manager to adjust it. 

4- we ordered a kids meal for our daughter which came with a choice of drink, choice of side and choice of dessert. We never got anything more then fries for her. No drink and no fruit. 

It wasn't even busy! In a location like this they should be better equipped to handle small mishaps like this one. Thank God the beer was cold. 

It definitely left a bad taste in my mouth with as many managers that were standing around. 

I'll stick to my regular location at Town Square."}
{"text":"Great happy hour!! They have en entire Gardein section of their menu for vegetarians. Great food, great drinks and a great ambience. I love the one at Town Square. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I love this place. I mean, how could you not? They have great food and the best selection of beer. They have all of my favorite beers on tap, even Paulaner Hefe Weizen, which I never would have expected. They also have a great gluten free menu which is huge for my fiancé and I because she has a severe allergy. Very relaxing vibe and they play all the games. A regular spot for me to come to with my friends."}
{"text":"Love coming here. Our server tonight, Janelle was kind, knowledge and attentive! It was refreshing to see the management team helping wherever needed to make sure the shift ran smoothly!"}
{"text":"The first time we came the food was alright, so we decide to try it again because we were hungry after a day of shopping and just thought this was close and convenient. We all got four different things, penne with chicken, southern fried chicken, Cobb salad, and a turkey club all of which were terribly bland!! How could all four entrees be so bland and flavorless! I will say the drinks were decent but not worth coming back for. Service was bad too, friendly but sooo slow. Won't be coming back!"}
{"text":"Super, Super COOL! I walked in and saw 125 beers on tap! WOW, I think I could be there all day - pass out and make another day out of it! Not that I would ever do that, but the thought just briefly passed through my mind. 

There are loads of craft beer and then some of our old favorites, so something for everyone. What I liked the most is that there are two flights of beer to choose from - the normal flight which includes several IPA's, Ales and what not - I don't care for IPA's so I skipped this one!!! But woo hoo! They had a Belgian style flight - which is my total favorite!! 

My flight had Goulden Drakk - Tripel Karmelite, Frambouise and a house Belgian that is made my SILLI! Too cool! 

I was there with my husband and a friend of ours and we ordered a California roll and a spicy tuna roll! They are HUGE! These are not served in the traditional roll but it looked like a round layer cake! There was plenty for three people and some left over! 

This was great fun! The music is always great at the Yardhouse with the great beer and food - Just a fun time waiting to happen!!! 

See you soon Yardhouse!"}
{"text":"The draft beer selection makes this place far above what the food does. The food is good, but normal. Nothing bad, but nothing amazing, besides the beer. Loved it, and I'm not even a beer fanatic!
Dave"}
{"text":"Good food. The pizza was kinda bland but the French onion soup was good. I had the lunch deal. The place is nice, service is kinda slow and I had to ask for refills of water and for salt. (Not on the table.) I would possibly consider coming back if someone specifically requested we go, but other than that it was just okay."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. Ate lunch there and sat outside. The trees dumped seeds into all our food. When we complained to the manager, she rolled her eyes and asked to remake our food like we were an inconvenience. The general manager walked by and did not even address the issue. $70 worth of food and drinks in the trash because it was in all our food, including the 4 year olds fruit. Even when we attempted to cover our food it was on everything because the waitstaff would walk through the blowing seeds and then when they put it on the table it would go into the food even more. Is this not a health code violation? Why wounldn't you move a family when you noticed that they had the coaster on top of their drinks? Why would they seat someone in this spot if stuff was falling from the trees?? #notgoodservice #wasteofmymoney #horribleexperience"}
{"text":"We stop by for a few drinks and just people watching. They have plenty of drags for you to try.
It's not a place place to try if you sit on the
Patio."}
{"text":"Yard House is simply one of the best restaurant/bars around Vegas. Simply for one because the beer selection is plenty and abundant with all types on tap plus bottled. 
Food menu is never ending with many options from burgers, chicken sandwiches, nachos, steak, fish.. i mean it offers lots! Plus deserts! 
While its always busy they have a great staff and it never seems too long to get taken care of and served. 
The atmosphere is always a little louder simply because theres a lot of people. 
There are many TVs around the restaurant with sports always playing. 
I've always had great experience at Yard House and it keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"TONS of BEER, good food, and great atmosphere.  Some say its over rated but you need to give it a shot because this place bolsters on a lot of offerings. 

We started off with Lobster, Crab & Artichoke Dip which for the price was a little bit of a disappointment but had some brews.  With so much to pick from, it was difficult but I started out with the Flying Dog Pale, good finish, then kilt lifter** get it!

I have found the food to always be good, I have been there when they have actually ran out of things particularly because their menu is a decent size.  Since I have been there a couple times I really have to take down a star because the service is so unpredictable.

Then the meal came, I got the Jerk Chicken & Shrimp Stack...you guys need to try this.  So much flavor with the peppers and the red chili sauce had a bit of a kick to it.  I fully enjoyed this.

Note:  From around 3-6 every day, they have a pretty sweet Happy Hour. With $3.25 pints you can't go wrong with their over 200 types of beer.  To follow that brew they have half priced appetizers."}
{"text":"Our waitress was friendly and good. My friend really enjoyed her Parmesan crusted chicken. I loved the fries, the sliders were okay. The reason this doesn't rate higher is because I had to use the flashlight on my phone for us to be able to see the menu and what ever menu i looked at online did not match what was in the restaurant. Had i seen the one from the restaurant we would not have gone. What kept the total reasonable was the happy hour price on the sliders and my friends choice of dish."}
{"text":"The Glendale Westgate District is as mainstream as it gets when it comes to delivering dining options. I am a deep believer in not going to places when I'm out of town that I could enjoy within the proximity of my area. But Glendale left me no option.

You know what you're getting at the Yard House. It is a level above your Chili's and TGI's. Decent bar food, okay happy hour, half yard drinks, and then you let the service dictate the rest. 

The service here was okay, they had a server shift switch but I am glad it happened because our 2nd server was much better. Their only slip up was them leaving me waiting for water. If Bobby Boucher can serve up high quality h20 why can't you?

The facility is well kept, restrooms are spacious, their TV game is lacking a bit from what I'm used to from the location in Oxnard, of all places. 

The Yard House is quite predictable. If you've never been to one I suggest you do, just like me, you won't mind it for when there are no better options."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible waste of time! 2 hours without food or an explanation. Don't seat us if you can't feed us! Plus the one plate that came out with a salad on it after one hour was filthy!"}
{"text":"Food is always good and service has consistently been impressive. There are long waits so it helps if you can get a drink from the bar to make the time go by!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I really do. Everyone there is great - there was an occasion I took my mother there back in 2009 that wasn't so pleasant and slightly embarrassing due to the poor service- I boycotted them for a while... But, after some time away, I don't know if they've had a management change since then or what, but the customer service is amazing. The atmosphere is great. It is literally my most favorite place to go, eat, drink, people watch, have great service!  It has it all really.... it is slightly expensive, but I don't care. I am more than willing and eager to pay for the great experience I get there. 

I recently got a new job and after my friend just kind of blurted it out to the waitress she congratulated me and I thought that was that, but no it wasn't. She came out with a plate that said congrats in cocoa and a little brownie a la-mode.  It was so sweet! The waitress was great! I wish I remembered what her name was... sigh. I'm sorry wonderful waitress. 

Anyways, this place is always a place I go to whenever I get the chance!"}
{"text":"So I think American Barstaurants should just quit trying to make Asian fusion stuff... If it's not good and they make perfectly fine American/Western dishes, why bother?  But I'll not let that deter what is always a great time at this chain restaurant/bar with fine service.  I've been to several locations of this joint - Pasadena, Irvine, 2 locations in Vegas - and they are very consistent in what they have to offer.

I was in Vegas over the weekend to catch up with my friends and see if my brother is keeping the house in shape, and the gang of us decided to gather here for lunch.  I honestly cannot remember everything we ordered here, but off the top of my head: lobster crab artichoke dip, seared ahi, california roll, and sweet korean bbq beef for apps, and fish & chips, thai chicken noodle salad, grilled pastrami, and a couple of burgers for entrees.  I tasted all the apps and my fish & chips.

Ahi - good, a bit bland
Artichoke dip - good, a bit bland
California rolls - interesting shape like pie pieces, but tasted pretty standard
Korean bbq beef - meh, my main complaint about the Asian fusion thing
Fish & Chips - great fish, great chips
Pastrami looked really good, as did the burgers.

As I said great service up-and-down, sufficiently noisy for lunch for vibrance, and the absolute best thing - Boddington's on tap!!!!

Table-for-1 Factor:  It's big enough and bar is absolutely huge with lots of TVs, so I think it should be fine.  Maybe except on weekends..."}
{"text":"I have yet to find something on the menu that I didn't like and not even mentioning all that tasty alcohol! Great place, great food, good times."}
{"text":"you must come here during happy hour. half off on some 100+ beers they have on tap. go and explore. don't be scared to try out beers you have not heard of. you'll thank me for sure. they have an outside area if you wanna drink a brew in the heat. the inside has t.v.s where you can watch any sporting event going on. it's a definite hit up spot if you're in the area"}
{"text":"Outstanding experience here last night. Amazing, attentive service. Food was inventive, fresh and on trend. Highly recommend any of the appetizers, especially any of the poke items (stack or nachos). We had a large group that they were not only fully prepared for, manager thanked us for being there. I was very impressed!"}
{"text":"November 10, 2017 Friday - 8 PM for dinner again later for more beer
2 Adults/4 Adults

Atmosphere - 5 stars
Food - 5 stars
Service - 5 stars

Background - Visiting family that is staying at the Flamingo and it was time to get some dinner.  So we walked the \"street\" to the High Roller Ferris wheel.  The second visit was so another family member could eat.

Atmosphere - .Modern.  Basically a long bar to handle all their beer taps.  Then along the walls they had their booths.  They had a few high top tables.

Food
  Drinks - Beer of course.  The beer menu is very large, but nothing special.  But the second time we sat near the bar.  I saw a TV that had beers listed.  I saw some that I did not see in the menu.  Instantly I knew I had to find out more about it.  I found out they have a \"chalk\" board list.  These beer are more of the seasonal beers and/or they only received one keg.  My third beer was off this menu.

  Dinner -I had the pepper jack burger.  Yes there is pepper jack cheese but this is not what gives it the heat.  It was the poblano pepper sitting on top of that medium cooked burger.  They do ask you how you want it cooked.  That burger and beer hit the spot.

Service - Nailed it.  When I ordered my wife gluten free beer it set of a series of questions which included if she needed the gluten free menu and follow up questions to make sure things were handled correctly by the staff.  Substitutions in the meal were made.  Our waiter instilled a lot of confidence in skills.

Future - Yes as I went twice in the same night."}
{"text":"Service here is iffy, but the food is pretty good and no doubt they have a great selection of beer. My absolute favorite here is the grilled cheese and tomato soup and Peroni on draft."}
{"text":"Great beer, great music, great service, and great food. Yard House is always a hit. They have a huge beer list, ensuring that there is something for every taste. The food is always great. Every time I have been there it's been delicious and freshly made.

Their burgers are on point and I mean, who doesn't love those skinny fries? The servers are friendly and if the weather is nice, the patio is perfect. I love that the restarurant is located in the middle of Westgate so you get to see the action all around you. The only downside is the wait time on a busy night, but who can blame them?"}
{"text":"The food is excellent, and the bar staff is extremely friendly especially our bartender Brendan. He was very attentive and polite. Love this spot! Definitely recommend it if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Decor is outstanding.  Everything is nice.  Flat screens all over the place.  Place is bumpin' with music.

Service was excellent for our party of 8.  Hostesses were really nice.

Server memorized our large order.  Impressive, because if you're gonna pull that stunt off, you'd better get it 100% correct.

Apps were onion ring stack and chicken nachos.  Nachos were good and hot.  Can't complain about that at all.

Had the jumbalaya and it was delicious.  Lots of meat and the sauce was tangy enough, but not extremely spicy.

Beers were cold.

That's pretty much it.  Yeah, I'd come here again."}
{"text":"I was truly blown away by this particular yard house inside the red rock Hotel in Las Vegas. The first thing that stood out was that even though they were in a gambling casino they did not give priority to high rollers and even though I am a highroller I love the fact that they were so cool about that and handed me a beeper and said it would be a 20 minute wait.

Instead of waiting we found two seats at the bar and they were able to make me an ice cream drink with vodka Kahlúa and cream de coco and only one in 20 bars will do that for me. And it was perfect.

The Caesar salad and guacamole and chips were awesome and came promptly to the table. My best friends meal was great and my turkey pot pie could not have been better

Even though the place was packed we were not rushed and were able to hang out for about 90 minutes at the bar chatting with others and just having a good time.

The vibe at most Yard Houses I have visited is high energy and very loud but this one was a lot more sane.

I would strongly recommend you give it a try when you are in Las Vegas because they don't allow smoking and as you know if you eat in a casino your clothes smell like smoke for weeks."}
{"text":"The amount of beers on tap alone is enough to make me want to come back. I expected that the food would be your typical bar-type fare (burgers, wings, etc). But the food was incredible. I had the tacos.. both those and the rice accompanying them were so delicious. Everyone (group of 5) that I was with raved about how good their food was as well. I was extremely impressed with this place and will be returning (hopefully once the new restaurant craze dies down)."}
{"text":"Yard house is one of my family's favorite restaurants and I would say we frequently visit this location. Generally the service and food are great, but today there was a fluke with my dish. I don't think this reflects on the restaurant really as we come here a lot and I've never had a problem, every business has their off days. I'm picky about customer service and the manager on duty who took care of my check provided me with great customer service and spoke very well and for that a Yelp review is in order. Too bad the dish wasn't the best, but I respect the friendliness and professionalism of the staff."}
{"text":"The wife was raving about the place for a while so I decided to give it a go, we were a party of 5 on a weekday early night.
Food menu: at least to me it was somewhat plain (yet overwhelming with choices) and I couldn't find anything that attracted me so I went for an old favorite, buffalo wings (more on that later)
Beer menu: huge and somewhat confusing, browsing it can take some time and apparently that is not to the liking of the wait stuff, but more on that later.
We had some soups, onion and creamed tortilla- xlnt, had some salads- very good
the wife had sliders, fairly plain and tasteless and 3 out of the 4 went home in a doggy bag, the wings I ordered were ok but some of them were pink in the middle and I had to send them back while lecturing about salmonella- not a good thing.
Beer: while the micros are good the prices and quantity are not worth the entry price (imo) paying almost $9 for what looks like 7 ounces of Belgian pirate ale is a bit rich for my blood, further more those tall \"yard house\" glasses while they look cool are completely impracticable, drinking out of them is painful and  uncomfortable, wish there was an option of a traditional stein instead.

All in all I found that its not as spectacular as describes and there are better options Vegas wide for like (concept) places. lets just say that I expected more then received."}
{"text":"Hey LV yelpers!

Brought my boyfriend here last night for dinner/happy hour.
Been to this location twice for happy hour :)

I would only recommend coming here for happy hour because yard house is on the slightly expensive side food wise. Since I don't drink alcohol, I come here for the food. The happy hour menu selection is great! I love the lettuce wraps, sliders, pizza, crab cakes...

Only reason for -1 star... the wait for the food took almost an hour to get to us! I think that's really long! Hopefully if I ever come back under 30 mins would be nice.

Our waitress mentioned to us that during footfall season, monday nights is happy hour all night long! that's good to know!

If you like beer, food and watching sports... come to yard house!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. 
The chicken nachos are delicious... good flavor and not a dry piece of chicken in the bunch. Great amount for 3 or 4 ppl to share. 
The traditional Caesar salad was perfect... right amount of dressing and not a single soggy leaf. The addition of golden raisins were a pleasant surprise. 
Did not care for the spicy tuna roll. It's not a roll. It's more of a cake or sculpture. The tuna was inconsistent in texture. Sent it back.
Did not care for the calamari. The red sauce was good. The calamari was bland and overcooked (rubbery). Sent it back. 
The manager was super nice. I guess he was concerned when the second dish went back. Gave him my feedback. He offered to pay for another chance.
The shitake garlic noodles were delicious. I would definitely order this again.
Everyone (the hosts, the servers, managers, etc) was very kind (especially, considering how busy they were). 
I would definitely return."}
{"text":"We visited on a Thursday evening around 6:30 PM. Called ahead to get our name on the seating list. Only had to wait maybe 5 minutes to be seated (there was a 30-40 minute wait for walk ins). This place is huge and it was packed! We were immediately greeted by Chloe, our server. She was absolutely fanatastic! My husband and I both ordered drinks from the bar and they arrived very quickly and were delicious. I ordered the 4 Cheese Pizza and my husband had the BBQ ribs with pinto beans and creamed corn. The food came out quickly as well and it was delicious! We saw the table next to us had ordered a desert that looked good so we asked Chloe what it was and she said we just had to try it. It was a Smores Brownie and man oh man was she right! We never order desert at restaurants, but I am sure glad we got it! AMAZING!! We also met Ed, the man in charge, who we had a nice conversation with. Just really great people here. 
This was just a really enjoyable experience.  The food and service were top notch and we will definately go back next time we are in the area."}
{"text":"Good food and good service. We sat outside and the weather was perfect. We had the new vampire quesadilla which is a cheese crusted tortilla with carnitas! Bomb! The sangria was strong, but good. I had the beef dip which i Love and my husband had the lobster shrimp pasta which he devoured so quickly! He loved it! Our waiter was really nice and because it was my birthday he brought me a complimentary brownie with ice cream which was really nice!!!"}
{"text":"I would love to give this a five, but the food. It stopped me. To start my partner and I had guacamole with tortilla chips, tip, if you make guacamole never forget the Lime/lemon; the plate was very bland due to sodium in the chips and guacamole. My partner ordered the vampire tacos, the beans weren't prepared well (they tasted like Bush's baked canned beans), and the rice was not zesty and flavorful as you would expect assuming it's a \"mexican\" dish, little seasoning would have made a big difference. The vampire tacos, I'm not sure where putting Bacon with Guacamole in one bite sounded appetizing but it wasn't, the plate was not finished but put aside instead, but then again who orders tacos from a Yard House?!! I had the Pene With Chicken, I originally wanted Chicken parm but they did not serve it so I got the pene instead. My chicken was dry, the Pene was very brittle, my chicken too over cooked and the plate had very little sauce which made my plate bland. I instantly had to bring my imagination to the plate and asked for Marinara with cilantro and pour it over my Chicken Pene and INSTANTLY my plate came to life, it was just flavorful and made the plate a house classic, I wish I could have recommended for it to be on the menu. But before I finish, I must say what made our experience so great was Justin, he was our server and he made sure we were taken care of when it came to our needs and that's what matters when you leave a restaurant. Came for a late night dinner and couldn't have left more fulfilled. Thank you Justin and tip to the cooks, sit the chicken on low fire, cheers."}
{"text":"Thank goodness for later hours of operation since they are few and far between in Az. I really enjoyed the southern fried chicken, mashed potatoes with spinach( mixed in) red beans & creamed corn. The servers were very efficient and energetic even at the late hour!
An all-around enjoyable experience!"}
{"text":"Now, this is a chain and we typically avoid chains when we are visiting somewhere new. That said, Vegas can get exhausting and going to a place like this was just the break we needed. It's on this little \"strip off of the strip\" area behind the Linq which has some other nice places (check out my review of Sprinkles). I loved this little area because it was much calmer than the main strip but still active. Apparently it is just out of the way enough that the obnoxious drunks wander past.

We had the grilled cheese and tomato bisque combo and the street tacos.  All of the street tacos are great. Very fresh and light and they hit the spot. My girlfriend was making a face while she ate the grilled cheese that I wish she made when we did \"other things\" together. Moving on...

We sat at the bar which we tend to do in most places. If you're visiting Vegas or anywhere that is busy, make sure you check the bar if you have a small party (no kids). We skipped a pretty big line by going to the bar here and the same thing at the Hash House a Go Go.  You also have your server right there whenever you need something. In the case of the Yard House, we had three very attentive and pleasant bartenders that took great care of us. 

The beer list is expansive, great atmosphere which is just \"clubby\" enough to keep the Vegas momentum but it wasn't annoying.  All in all, a good choice."}
{"text":"I've read & heard so much about the Yardhouse that I couldn't wait to eat there.  

Hawaiian Sunset Martini & Bikini Tini were very good, as were the Parmesan Crusted Pork Loin & Maui Pineapple Chicken.  Kudos to the Chef!

Sitting @ an outdoor table was a plus.  Great Atmosphere & Service.  So many things on the creative menu that I want to try ~ I must return again & again!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch date with the hubby, we were seated within about five minutes and were quickly greeted by our server who quickly took our drink order. The menu is extensive and has many option to choose from. They have an enormous choice of beers many of which are on tap, so if your a beer drinker with simple or complex tastes there is something for everyone.
it was a busy saturday so we exptected to have to wait which we did so we decided to order an order of truffle fries which were amazing. The pork sandwich with au ju the hubby was very happy with but after cutting into my turkey burger i discovered a problem.  I discovered the burger undercooked in the very middle. My husband called over one of the other servers that was closest and he immediately apologized and said he would take care of it immediately, within about a minute I had our server and the manager at our table apologizing for the mistake and reassurance it would be rectified immediately and it was. We finished our meal everything being perfect from then on so good job Yardhouse we'll be back agai"}
{"text":"Love their vegan options! I usually get the vegan chicken sandwich or spaghetti with marinara. Sometimes theres long wait times, however I have always enjoyed all my food. Good salad selection too! I believe they use gardein meat substitute."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this Yard House for almost ten years.  For a chain restaurant, I think the quality and selection is great.  This doesn't just apply to the beer selection either.  They have a ton of great food options as well.   

You can come here for many a different occasion from a huge group of people to a date.  I remember one year we came to do a holiday gift exchange with my co-workers, with no problem at all (and half of us didn't even eat or drink anything).  Just remember if you are bringing a date here, it can get a little loud.  

I like to come for happy hour as the food is very discounted.  You can get a lot of different items that are all the same size and quality they would be outside of happy hour.  

I've tried quite a few things on the menu but I do notice that I tend to get the same thing all the time.  Poke stack and ahi crunchy salad.  This salad is something I'd probably want on death row.  Must have it.

Sometimes I do find that my mixed drinks can be a little hit or miss but my favorite cocktail is a Moscow Mule and with their housemade ginger beer, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"We came here for some appetizers before going on the High Roller across the street (see my review.)  Like any Yard House location, the food is wonderful, crowd lively, & plenty of great music playing.  Our waitress, Stephanie, was very friendly, bubbly, & attentive.  We started off with drinks; I ordered a Yard House Honey Blond which was light & refreshing on a warm Vegas day.  I ordered the cheese curds which are crispy with a smooth cheese filling; perfect with the hourse radish sauce which gives them a kick.  I tried one of my mother's coconut shrimp which was crispy & suculent with the perfect amount of coconut.  Weather you dine inside or on the padio, you cannot go wrong.  So, for some wonderful American food at reasonable prices with friendly service, Yard House cannot be beat.  Keep up the good work guys."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch one day, I got the cuban dip. The idea is better then what it really was. I like that you can get soup and half sand. for a pretty good price. I guess I am just more of a fan of BJ's brewhouse across the street. Service was pretty good. I would have liked it more if my sandwich wasn't as sweet."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting. I have gotten food poisoning here so if you must go to this money trap serving FROZEN food, make sure you don't get any fish at all. The last time I was here, I dealt with extremely incompetent and sloppy managers. My food came out totally wrong and when a manager came to the table she was rude and uncaring. She also had a strange odor... A general manager was sent to the table who seemed to have the social skills of a pebble... he was very strange and I just wanted him away from my table and my kids...he gave us a strange vibe. Although he was apologetic, the next time my food was brought (this time a Smores brownie and some ice cream,) I found plastic in the dessert ! A few little pieces of hard plastic!!. Darden has really gone downhill. From the food they serve to especially the managers they hire. Since we were near a computer, I overheard a few servers talking about how miserable they are working here. Something about how managers purposely don't listen to employees availability, how servers get written up for the smallest things. I used to be a food server so when I go to restaurants I am always aware of how busy my server is, what they are dealing with etc. I've never had a problem with service here it seems like morale, management, food and overall quality is just down. It's a hard enough job for these servers why make it harder on them? Especially when you can't even do your own job. The cherry on the sundae was when an older manager came to the table as we were getting ready to leave. She looked stressed out all wide eyed and stated \" your burger will be right out I am so sorry.\" Uh... we hadn't even ordered a burger I told her. Damn, these managers better get it together, wouldn't you know your own tables at a restaurant you're managing ? If you're into happy hour checks that go above 50$ for you and one person, then this over priced chain dump is for you. Make sure you don't go in the summer, you'll be visited by some cockroaches for sure. Yummy !"}
{"text":"WAY over rated...

Let's statt with we get put at a tiny 2-seat table against a window to the inside of the restaurant smack at the aisle leading in so everyone walking by us to leave and to arrive.

Couldn't even hear each other so either we didn't talk or we had to really talk loud just below a scream - music was so freaking loud!  So all there had to be loud too so whole patio yelling at each other.

Skip the blue cheese and the ranch salad dressings, they only taste like sour cream with no flavor.  The balsamic was good though.

Food...Had the Stack Carnitas Enchiladas and absolutely no flavor, bland & tasteless.  Wife had the Nashville Hot Chicken which was a small & flat pretty over cooked breaded chicken (the hot sauce with the ranch sauce was the only saving grace to it), hard to cut through sweet potatoe pancakes and that was it.

Server was great though and even commented on how loud it was as he was having a hard time taking our order.

So bad experience to say the least for $110 for 2 people with 2 side salads, 2 dinners & 2 beers."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times since it opened, and the food has always been very good. The service is lacking at times though, even at less than busy times.  The location in the Red Rock casino is what keeps me coming here, if it was someplace else, I'd probably go to another restaurant."}
{"text":"First and last visit to any Yard House location. Server was all over the place. She wasn't even sure that she gave us the correct beers. My husbands Club sandwich had to be redone 5 times, by the time they had got it right my tasteless Steak Sandwich was cold. Fries we're served cold and tasteless and salad was served with no dressing. Manager payed for our sandwiches only . We still had to pay for the side of fries and our beers that may have been the right ones? Keep in mind this was my 40TH Birthday lunch. Thanks Yard House"}
{"text":"Met some friends to catch up. Had good service and they kept the drinks flowing. Good time."}
{"text":"Took the family here for dinner. Good sized portions and quality food. We enjoyed it. With a young kid it was cool since its loud."}
{"text":"I've been to Yardhouse during happy hour and regular hours! I personally would rather go during happy hour, prices are of course cheaper and they give generous portions. I've ordered three to four plates during happy hour and it cost around 20 dollars! Now during their regular hours I've spent 50 dollars on four plates. Sitting inside the restaurant can be very loud, I've found myself yelling across the table so my friend could hear me. Outside seating wasn't as loud but since it's Vegas it is hot! Customer service is great! They're always nice and I love how they check up on you!"}
{"text":"First time here. Took my kids. Ordered the Jambalaya with white rice. Super delicious. The kids ordered a bacon cheeseburger which she absolutely loved and Fish and Chips - sooooo good btw. Service was great. Will return and get the full plate of Jambalaya this time."}
{"text":"A pretty poor experience - from the slow and inattentive service to the bad meal, I wish I had eaten dinner elsewhere in Vegas. I came with a party of 14, which they seated on a booth area. Pretty good that they were able to accommodate us all, with only a 30 minute wait on a Friday night. 

The service was super slow though. Every step of the process - ordering, getting our food, getting the checks, took ages. I ordered the Korean Short Rib Kalbi street tacos and heavily regretted my decision. 

For $15+, you get two quite pitiful and tiny tacos. Literally so small - they fit easily in the palm of my hand. And the filling...to call it Korean Short Rib Kalbi is a bald faced lie. This was some random cut of beef, stir fried to oblivion, and drizzled with some strange sweet sauce. It was dry and crispy in a bad way. To add insult to injury, there's like two small morsels of beef to each taco, which can be eaten in 2-3 bites. The tortilla came cold and brittle. They try to supplement the meal with a small cup of beans (which were fine) and rice (which was cold), but I was actually starving after this. I ate off my friend's plates, who ordered much better dishes (like the Lobster Garlic Pasta or the Shrimp Scampi)."}
{"text":"Love Yard House no matter what location I've been too! Frank was our bartender and he was beyond great. So often as a tourist service staff can be complacent because \"you're not coming back\" anytime soon but he was great. We talked sports and had everything we needed. Truly a perfect dining experience! Go Frank!"}
{"text":"Best damn restaurant/ Bar/ menu/ quality and consistently great food and Beer ever. I spoke to God and she told me there is one in Heaven!,, by the way did I say the bartenders are the best"}
{"text":"I would've rate Yard House a 3 stars based on previous visits but decided they are a solid 4 stars based on my recent visit. This particular Desert Ridge location is set up so that the hostess station is located in the middle of the restaurant. Nonetheless, they are efficient and friendly. 
Over the years, I've noticed they added many new entrees to their menu. We all decided to try something we haven't before, so we ordered Vodka shrimp pasta, Lobster mac and cheese, and spicy Cajun Jambalaya. The pasta was really creamy and delicious. The lobster mac and cheese was also flavorful without being overly cheese or greasy. The jambalaya was very spicy! Did I mention it was spicy? Don't order this dish if you can't take the heat! We love spicy food so we loved it. All of the dishes were perfectly seasoned, not salty at all which I often find dishes at restaurants. 
Overall, we had very nice meal and the waitstaff were very friendly and helpful. Looking forward to going back soon."}
{"text":"I've been coming here and other franchise locations for many years. They do a great job on their beers a little pricey for what they have but they also do a great happy hour only Monday thru Friday 3 to 6 and late night reverse happy hour send the clothes. they have a very large selection on their food menu and some pretty good stuff."}
{"text":"First time ever eating at Yard House and so far very pleased. The waiters here are very professional and helpful. They have such a huge selections of beers and wine which they are known from have. I ordered the classic sliders which their presentation is very nice and it's just an appetizer. Definitely  be coming back"}
{"text":"We come here all the time! 

The menu is huge. All of the soups and salads are our favorite things to order. My husband likes that there's lots of beer choices. I like all of the vegetarian options, even though I'm not a vegetarian, they are delicious. 

You can enter from inside the casino or the front from the parking lot. The bar area is really big if you just want a drink. There are lots if TVs to accommodate the sports fan. Great music is always playing. There's a nice outdoor seating area with shade, misters, and heaters, so no matter the weather, they can adjust it by a few degrees. It's family friendly, so little kiddos are always welcome!"}
{"text":"Ok so went to yard house for my buddies 21st birthday and had an amazing sampler of local beers and the best moscow mule ive ever had! Amy Coronado and kendal were amazing at makimg sure we were happy and taken care of. The vibe is unreal when the people serving you actually care and have fun with ya. Would give this place more stars if I could. Amy is definetly management material!"}
{"text":"This is one of the new millions of beers on tap concept restaurants. The food was great, the staff friendly and professional and the atmosphere smart casual. I had the shrimp Cobb salad that was fresh and tasty, and I appreciated the availability of a half portion so I could try the soup. The chicken tortilla soup, is a must try. This is a good solid classy bar with something for everyone."}
{"text":"I have to say thar for someone who considers herself a foodie - I'm almost surprised by how high I'm rating a chain like this. Yet there is no denying that my experience has been nothing but positive here. Food, beer and staff have been terrific and consistent. Because we are football fan wannabe's without actually possessing the ability to watch a game at home, we like to roll over here for our sports fix. And there truly isn't a bad view in the house, though I've never strayed from the bar.

The beer selection is of course...impressive. I love trying new ones and the bartenders are very patient with doling out samples for an indecisive patron such as myself. On that thought - the bartenders are pretty awesome. Always friendly, always attentive and insightful on both beer and food. While we pretty much always order the same thing (deviled eggs and truffle fries anyone?), I've like most things I've tried on the menu. This is a great place to accommodate the meatless crowd (self included) and even those that live sans carne get cravings for buffalo wings - mission accomplished here! Thank goodness for Gardein."}
{"text":"Yardhouse is renowned for the selection of beer they have. To my shock and excitement, my favorite German beer (which just so happens to be Warsteiners!) is featured here for only $4.50! The beers here are magnificently cheap, depending on which you order of course, but its definitely in an affordable range. If you're looking for an adventure to venture away from the general beers of Bud Light and Corona, they have a variety of different beers from different countries... on tap. Yes, you heard me right. On tap. 

I only tried the ahi and the flatbread with artichoke dip, which wasn't that bad (flatbread and artichoke is beginning to be a little more redundant for an appetizer meal nowadays, but the ahi was seasoned and seared deliciously!) It was only a Wednesday night and the bar was crowded and lively. This is definitely my place in town to where I want to go for beer that's from different countries and you don't need to feel like you're getting ripped off like you would at other places on The Strip."}
{"text":"My first visit and I was impressed!  It's a great space...roomy...great for a happy hour with friends...and fantastic for a late dinner (the kitchen is open until 1am on Friday & Saturday nights).  I started off with the Lobster, crab and artichoke dip...hot, cheesy...great with the accompaning chips for slices of pita bread.  I drank my dessert...that is, I had a half and half...Youngberry Chocolate!  Half raspberry beer...half chocolate stout...it was a fantastic melding of flavors in my mouth!  The beer list is extensive, so I definitely have this on my list for my next trip to Vegas!

For dinner, I had the grilled cheese (three cheeses on sourdough bread) and organic tomato and basil bisque.  WOW!  That was a fantastic combination of cheeses and soup...the fried basil leaf on top was the perfect accent.  Along my main course, I ordered a side of truffle fries...these were divine!  If you've read any of my other reviews, you'll know that I LOVE anything with truffles...this definitely didn't disappoint!  Perfectly fried shoe string fries...sprinked with fresh herbs, salt, black pepper, parmesan cheese and truffle oil. YUM!!

This meal definitely didn't disappoint...my only regret is that I don't live closer!"}
{"text":"I love the Yardhouse.

On a typical Saturday night, the wait can be a bit crazy --- nothing like some Coldstone to help pass the time.  Although the prices are a bit high, the food is delicious.  I mainly go there for some appetizers, booze, and some dessert.  I don't think I've actually tried any \"real food.\" Try the beer float. It tastes like a SweetTart. This place also has a boatload of craft beer for you beer drinkers.

Regardless, great place to go with some friends!. The ladies and I love this place."}
{"text":"This place has tons of beers on tap but sadly the majority are very mainstream beers (Stella, Harp, Sierra Nevada, etc.). Good beers but I would like to try some beers I've never had before. I don't think there was a brewery on the list that I wasn't already well acquainted with. 

I got a chicken sandwich that was pretty good so no complaints with the food. The French fries are teeny-tiny thin...which sounds fun but you get bored eating them because you never get anywhere they are so little!"}
{"text":"Pleasant experience, classical American slightly upscale restaurant. Their menu is full of options from burgers to pizza, seafood and Mexican dishes. My friend and I sat at the bar and were greeted by Tiffany. Good personality, very attentive. 

We started with a clam chowder, good, but a bit too salty. My friend ordered the Halibut with Porcini mushroom sauce...a real exquisiteness!! I wish I ordered that too. Unfortunately my ginger crusted salmon was too salty as well. 

We ended with the banana and blueberry cobbler. I'm not a big fan of cobbler but this one was to remember. They also have a good selection of draft beers, to try samples next time! 

Concluding, it's an almost 5 star review, too bad for those salty dishes."}
{"text":"Went here only once, but it left a fairly strong impression.  I'd recently discovered Yelp and found myself taking notes through the whole thing about things I wanted to say - then I threw that away and decided to go w/ my gut.  I mention that, because it feel like that's what this place is like - someone originally had this list of the detailed things that needed to be included, then they just sort of scraped that and did something in between.  It wants to be upscale (to pay the rent and bring in the chicks) but in the end it's a bar with tons of beer and upscale bar food.  When it comes to food (this is where the list comes in) they have everything - burgers, sandwiches, pizzas, seafood, chicken fried chicken, mac & cheese, rice bowl, steaks, ribs and a bevy of desert options.  I mean - really?  What made you decide you needed to tackle a menu that big?  Trying to compete w/ Cheesecake factory?  Pricing is about the same as well - but serving sizes are not. These are smaller.

I'll be honest - the food was pretty good.  Our server was particularly helpful in helping the guys plow their way through the beer lists.  They didn't sing for his birthday (BIG plus!) but they totally respected that it was a special occasion dinner.  As the night went on, my brother's only complaint was that for a place that specialized in beer, the bathroom shouldn't have been so far away from where folks sit - located by the front door.  I thought that was a noble observation, even if he was slurring a bit as he mentioned it..."}
{"text":"For once, I'll be honest.  I went to the Yard House because I wanted to drink yards of beer.  There's something about drinking from a giant glass beaker that makes me feel like a mad scientist of beer, which is enjoyable.  To my pleasant surprise, the food is actually quite good.

I don't remember exactly what I ordered because I got drunk and the police tasered me.  If you must know, that's why this place doesn't get 5 stars."}
{"text":"Great selection of beer on tap. Great ambience and great selection of foods. Ribs was great as were the burgers we ate. It was cooked according to the way we asked. Prices were a little bit on the high side as it was just off the strip and the location of this restaurant in a new alley was very hip and live bands and performers in the area made it very lively. 

Will go back again as the food was worthwhile and the service was good"}
{"text":"No mark-up prices! 

We were staying nearby at the horrible, horrible LINQ hotel and our group of 14 needed a place to eat together without breaking the bank. I found Yard House on Yelp and was surprised to see that their prices were the same as outside of Vegas. Meaning we'd pay normal price for food! We were seated after a few minutes cause we came a little early in the day when they just opened, but WOW. Service was consistently great. Food was great. We got all sorts of food. Pizza, Tacos, Nachos, Chicken, Burgers, etc. we shared almost everything so I couldn't tell you specifically what IS good but I don't think you'd be disappointed! Our dining experience was 5/5! We all left full of good food and happy smiles. 

I definitely recommend stopping by Yard House to everyone who has a large group to feed, or is just looking to dine without breaking the bank in Vegas."}
{"text":"Pretty disgusted with the service I received here this past weekend. We came for a friend's birthday and about half our group arrived 20 minutes before the other half so the waiter took our drink orders until the others arrived. About 4 out of the 8 ordered drinks and it took him 30 minutes to finally return with 4 beers - this is no exaggeration. Once the other half arrived he got them their drinks and then we didn't see him for a long while and had to flag him down to order our food. Luckily the food was fast, but that's because our waiter had no part in that. He never once came over to check on us as see if we needed anything else like drink refills or ask if the food was ok. The busboys cleared off our table when we were done and once again we sat and sat and sat waiting for our waiter to come over and bring the check. Once he was done flirting with a group of girls at the next table over he finally stopped by to ask if we wanted the check. After that it took another 20 minutes to finally get the check. I understand we were a large group of people, but it was a Thursday night and it was not at all busy. And I'm sure he had it in the back of his head that he was getting his 18% auto gratuity due to the group, but he could have made a lot more if he stopped by to get people more drinks. 

The food however was good and everyone was happy with their selections. I just can't give this place more than 2 stars because of the horrible service."}
{"text":"This was my second time at a Yard House, and I guess I'm just not a fan. I just find the food completely underwhelming. 

We started out with the grilled artichoke appetizer, and it was practically raw. It was nearly impossible to scrape the meat off the leaves, and even the heart was tough. This also came with chips and ranch dipping sauce. Kind of an odd combo now that I think of it. 

For my meal I had the pastrami sandwich. It was okay, but I wouldn't go back to order it. The meat was a little tough, and the pickled jalapenos were pretty scarce. It was supposed to be served on a garlic bread, but the bread didn't taste garlicky at all. The fries were probably the best part of this meal. They were thinly cut, and perfectly crispy. 

If this was purely based off the food, I'd give it 2 stars, but the beer menu boosts the rating for me. There's a crazy number of beers on tap, so there's really something for every taste! This is a nice location in the Linq, so if I'm in the area I'll probably stop by for a drink."}
{"text":"Not sure what this place is like in other locations-- but the one in Town Square here is amazing. We've gone here almost every Monday since we moved here and love it. You cannot beat the half-priced appetizers or drink specials that last ALL DAY on Monday's for football season (I think on Sunday's too?)-- my husband and I usually share an onion ring tower and a pizza (which is full sized-- no skimping just b/c it's happy hour!) Great food, great service... worth the wait..."}
{"text":"I've been to this Yard House numerous times. 

Derrick's attentive and personable service is why I'm finally writing a review!

Ask for him and you won't regret it.

Besides Derrick, other noteworthy things to mention is there sweet happy hour! Try the Margherita pizza,  Mushu eggrolls and calamari!

Favorite dish hands down would be the Spicy Jambalaya w/ linguini! (Not on HH)

For dessert you can't go wrong with either the mini creme brulee or the berry rum macadamia nut crumble."}
{"text":"I have been her before, but didn't return because the music was so loud that we couldn't hear anything our table mates said. 
Friends wanted to eat hear so we joined them.  Kudos for turning down the music!
Now the food...we ordered several appetizers.  Pizza was good, but nothing spectacular.  Korean boneless wings were flavorful with a tasty dipping sauce.  Jerk boneless wings had good flavor with a kick.   Traditional wings were just normal.   Egg rolls would have tasted better, however were over cooked and try.  
Now the chicken lettuce wraps!  Ugh...just nasty.  When they were brought to the table, we thought they forgot the chicken.  The chicken was pulverized and looked like brown sugar.  It was flavorless like sawdust, and tasted nothing like chicken!  Server said it was mixed with tofu. 
Service was good.
We are in no hurry to return.  Mediocre food at best."}
{"text":"This place has an impressive tap list. My wife and I were at Red Rock earlier this month and decided to grab a quick drink around 2 in the afternoon. So, we walked in and the place was pretty empty as you might expect on a work day. There was no one at the bar - not a great sign, but ok. We came in and were quickly greeted, given menus and a chance to look. I did not count the number of beers they have on tap, but I stopped looking as soon as I saw Delirium Tremens on tap. I ordered that and wifey had something like Boddington's. Mine was perfect, her's was good. (Boddington's was better.) We didn't order any food as we weren't hungry, but it looks like there is plenty of good choices. 

I liked this place, but it's clearly part of a chain. It looks and feels like a chain. I tend to like the one off places a little more. 

Will I be back? Yeah, I will."}
{"text":"No complaints. Food always comes out delicious and quick :) . Great selection, friendly staff."}
{"text":"I haven't visited any of the other Yardhouses but I love this one. I have only had a problem with their staff once and that was a long time ago. Every other time i have been here there service has been amazing. 

Last time i went there i had a million special instructions on my meal and felt like a jerk but I am trying to eat meat so I needed to substitute a few things. The server was amazingly accommodating and came back to check if I could have different items since they had meat stock or to inform me of different things just for my order at least 3 times. If i were serving the table i would have been annoyed but he had a smile and was genuinely nice every time he came to the table. 

I can honestly say that i have NEVER ordered something that i didn't like at this place. They have a huge selection of food to pick from and offer everything from Chinese to Mexican to amazing deserts. 

The restaurant itself is very clean and well maintained and I have never had a problem with parking literally there are like 3 parking garages within a 100 foot radius of the restaurant plus they almost always have valet available. 

Great place, great food, great service!"}
{"text":"There needs to be more of these everywhere. The wood the atmosphere all incredible. I had there steak sandwich with sweet potato fries. My mouth is watering as I type. The waiter was great with explaining there beers. I can't wait to eat here again."}
{"text":"As a Beer lover (craft Beer) this place fits my needs, great selection of Beers to choose from neatly organized in the menu. The food is pretty good so far from the items I've ordered. My only complaint is there's no Beers from Stone Brewing Company and my other issue is that the Beer selection never changes other than your typical season release Beers. I'd love to see the beer menu change every three Months to keep things fun and fresh, other than that the atmosphere is great here!"}
{"text":"I went there during lunch time. They offer lunch specials from 11am-4pm and happy hour starts at 3-6pm M-F. I am not much of a beer drinker so I was appreciative of their full bar. I recommend the pineapple Moscow mule (pineapple vodka, ginger beer and lime with a pineapple mint garnish). It was very refreshing. Aside from their rather large selection of beer and full bar, they have several items on their food menu (mainly American - a variety of sandwiches, pizza, tacos, wings, fries, salad, soup, fish and chips, salmon, chicken and much more). I like their truffle fries and sweet potato fries. The staff was nice and very attentive. I like that they provided the condiments before our meal came so we didn't have to ask. They also were generous with the limes after I had ordered a vodka tonic with extra limes."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are here at least once a week. The waiters recognize him and remember his drink order now, haha. So glad they have vegetarian options and serve Gardein dishes! Haven't had a bad experience with food or wait staff yet, so we'll keep going back. :)"}
{"text":"Loved yard house back a few years ago, haven't been for about a year and today just made me decide I will never return. The food was not what it used to be. My husbands pizza was soggy and my tacos were very bland, our server was great and she got me to out three stars instead of one."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places to enjoy Happy Hour...no matter where you are in the city!

They have specials on just about everything on their drink menu, from wine to beer to cocktails. And a huge range of munchies. I recommend the marghertia pizza and the artichoke dip with pita chips (yum!) but I can't say much for the mooshoo egg rolls...they had a pate texture I didn't much care for. 

Our waitstaff was friendly and consistent and we loved having a big ole' booth to sit and chat in. 

The closest parking is near Guitar Center and most locals know this, but the meters aren't actually maintained, so don't worry about feeding it - I promise, you won't get fined!"}
{"text":"Hostess was very nice, got seated immediately. Our server Amber was great! Awesome attitude and very knowledgable of the menu. Ordered a ribeye with shrimp, but the shrimp were undercooked and still cold. I told Amber who was very understanding and she took it back to the sous chef. We were at a table that could see the kitchen and I watch the sous chef stick his bare ungloved hand on my steak and shrimp, then gave it to the cook to reheat. I told Amber what I saw and if she could just remove the plate from our tab as I lost my appetite seeing that. The sous chef continued touching everyone's food after wiping his head, touching his hair, and went was handling everyone's food without gloves. The manager came to talk to us about what happened and I told him what I saw. He quickly went to the kitchen and the sous chef put gloves on immediately (which were hanging right in front of him). At the end of our dinner the manager had compt out whole ticket (which I did not ask for but welcomed it lol). He gave us a 25$ gift card to come back but I think this is our last time. I just want to make it clear our server Amber was GREAT and did everything in her power to rectify the situation. I applaud her for that and the manager for stepping in to handle the situation. It's clear their kitchen needs work but the front of house is TOP NOTCH and the reason they got 3 stars instead of 1."}
{"text":"First time here at the Yard House. Have buffalo wings, clam chowder, and the ribs. Very good.

Service was excellent. 

Highly recommend. Good job Yard House keep it up!!

Love Nelly!!!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch, chipotle chicken tacos were ok. The draft beer was served to us in warm glasses, asked for a chilled glass and they don't have them. Warm beer for $6 a glass, nope! Not worth the money at all."}
{"text":"Amazing service and delicious food. They have some great veganizable items and they were so thorough and considerate to me regarding the fact that I'm vegan. Great menu and beer/cider list! Love!"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant at Desert Ridge last week with a friend and had a great experience AT LUNCH with a good waitress.  However, after going back (mostly due to the good kids menu that my toddler will actually eat) tonight for DINNER, I need to revise my original feelings about this restaurant.  It was loud, the waiter (Justin) pretty much sucked, and the manager was \"ok\" at trying to resolve our issues.  Our issues: let's start with a 45 minute wait for our food.  After the first 15 minutes, the waiter stopped by to say our food would be out \"in a minute or two\"... 15 minutes later, we got a refill on tea, but no update on our food.  After 15 more minutes, we flagged down our waiter who clearly forgot to enter our ticket and asked him to actually go check on our food after he, once again, said \"it should be out in a minute or two.\"  Not too convincing. The manager came over (clearly without discussing anything with our server) and said, \"Hi folks, how are you doing?\" Our response, \"HUNGRY!\"  Luckily, my husband checked into Yelp about 10 minutes after our arrival b/c the manager told us that we couldn't have been there long b/c our ticket was only entered 9 minutes ago.  Yelp showed my husband checking in 23 minutes prior.  Plus, my toddler had finished her meal long ago.  So - long story, they didn't really take responsibility for the forgotten ticket.  They did comp us the 2 sandwiches (slightly overpriced, but very good when they finally arrived).  The manager asked us if there was anything else he could help us with and I nicely asked him to bring out my toddler's ice cream (kids menu).  That was forgotten, as well.  I had to ask our waiter (Justin) 3 TIMES to bring it out.  I finally asked him if he could go back and get a spoon and put a scoop into a little dish with a spoon - not rocket science. He brought out the ice cream (miracle) and said he'd bring more ice tea. Great, thanks!  10 min later he arrived to say he'd bring our check in a couple minutes and \"is there anything else I can get you?\".... uh, how about that tea you said you were going to get 10 min ago?  From beginning to end, this night sucked.  The food was good, but it was a total cluster.  If you're thinking of going here for dinner - take my advice and go to BJs Brewhouse - it's got a similar menu (probably better food, in my opinion), better prices, WAYYY better service, and managers who actually take their time to listen.  Lesson learned."}
{"text":"Rogue Hazelnut Brown chilled and ready to be served? Well, that's worth 5 stars right there, especially since you can't really find a Rogue Ale in just any bar. It's true. I've become somewhat of a beer snob. I also admire a place that proffers variety, building on the boring ol' domestics that many people seem to enjoy (don't ask me how). 

The Yard House is where I went to drown my sorrows. After a hard day at the office, I wanted a beer. And I wanted a good one at that. My friend and I scurried over to Yard House to partake. I even tried a Honey Ale (from another Oregon Brewery) and chatted up my friend who enjoyed her pilsner and ale. 

The menu has good happy hour selections. The service is just alright. Weird, I'd say, meeting several jaded and bitter bartenders. Ours was not too shy about broadcasting his \"woe is me\" stance to us. He turned out to be a Cancer. Figures. In any case, he served us beer, even if he seemed a bit impatient when we were debating on what to order for our last round. I stuck with the tried and true - the Hazelnut Brown. My friend went with her fave, Blue Moon. 

There was no frenzy to kick us out, even after happy hour passed. The bartenders poured us generous amounts of water... and even seemed to be a bit flirtatious with us. Could have been my non-sober imagination, though. We ordered a couple aps - the poke and crab cakes. They were okay. A bit hard to eat, I'll admit. Never in my life would I imagine seeing a $12 Spicy Tuna Roll on any menu, but the Yard House makes no bones about it. If you want sushi, you'll have to pay a hefty price for it. Then again, sushi at a bar like this? You're better off ordering the spicy thai chicken pizza. I hear it's really good.

Inside, the Yard House looks and feels like a typical restaurant/bar. Sure, you see alot of beer selection when you mosey up to the bar, but nothing really wowed me about this place. If I could give it 5 stars just for the variety of beer it has, I would. BUT I happen to think a little thing called \"atmosphere\" is important, too. That's why you'll find me elsewhere, like at The Lost Leaf, where I can partake of my fave Rogue ale, as well as many others, including Hobgoblin from the UK."}
{"text":"I love Yardhouse's happy hour. In general, the food is pretty good and they have lots of beers on tap, including my favorite cider.  It's also a great place for big groups.  I have gone with a group as a big as 25 people and they gave all three birthday people a complimentary dessert for each!

My last visit, my boyfriend and I got these:

Pomegranate Margarita  $7.25- Alright, they put sugar instead of salt on the edge

Fried Chicken Strips  $4.92 - Good, but not amazing

Wyder Pear Cider  $4.50 - So delicious!   All my girlfriends and I always order this when we come here.  It's so cold and fresh due to coming from tap

Spicy Tuna Roll  $6.42 - My top favorite item here.  It's no ordinary roll, it's basically a spicy tuna cake that is covered in a layer of avocado with cucumber, beans, and carrots and the tuna is marinated with a special sauce.  All my girlfriends and I who are big sushi eaters love this dish as it makes a big twist on a spicy tuna roll

This place can also be great for a date as they the lighting is dimming and when there is those awkward silences, you can watch the several tv's throughout the place and talk about that. ;)   Afterwards, you can walk around the mall as it is connected to fashion square."}
{"text":"If you need a nap in a dark empty place, this is perfect. I could barely see the beers, 5 pm on a Tuesday doesn't need the ambiance of a jazz club at 1 am."}
{"text":"My recent visit to the yard house was a true disappointment. To start our server took 5 minutes to come get our drinks (it was 4PM on Sunday, so it was slow) and when she did come over she was rushed and not very friendly. The food was blah and didn't have any flavor (wings and tomato soup for appetizers and Cuban sandwich for dinner). Also they never brought my daughter fries and they were out of vanilla ice so my kids didn't get any dessert. The only bright spot was the blood orange IPA which was delicious! 
I know Yard House is a very tempting choice in Westgate but there are plenty of other option to choice from that are so much better."}
{"text":"I am frequently in Yard House for to go orders.  The staff is always nice even when they are slammed and crazy busy.  And that is often.  This place is usually packed.  I want to especially give a shout out to Hiclay and Zach, as they are the ones I see most often .  Hiclay is always so nice and she even apologizes if the wait is more than a couple minutes. These two, and others, make it nice to go into Yard House.  I don't get that same feeling in many of the other restaurants in Desert Ridge."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday during. Brunch. The wait to be seated was quick. But The food is way overpriced for such small portions. Our wait for the food to arrive was not good. The burgers were lackluster."}
{"text":"Undoubtedly one of the best Happy Hour specials in Las Vegas, when considering quality and price. Sure, you can go to the neighborhood bar and find $1 beers on tap at odd hours...but the quality offered by Yard House is seldom seen in combination with their prices. Expect to pay $4-5 for a delicious imported beer, $4 wells, or $5-6 for one of their signature martinis and cocktails. 

On top of that, their food is delicious. And by delicious, I mean I've never eaten anything there that wasn't. Generously portioned half priced appetizers will undoubtedly keep you satiated to the tune of $6-7, or you can enjoy their sliders or pizza selection for similar pricing. 

I rang in my 21st birthday here in 2009, and my friends had a blast exposing me to all sorts of fun delicious drinks - I can give Yard House some credit for the eclectic taste in spirits I have now. Take me seriously when I say, they have beer for EVERYONE. If you hate beer, THEY HAVE BEER FOR YOU. If you love beer, they have 250 of them! If you think beer is tolerable but haven't found one you love yet, get in your car *right now* and go to Yard House. I'm serious. My personal favorites are Goose Island Matilda, a Belgian style pale ale that tastes a little bit fruity with a lot of kick, and Stone Ruination IPA. They always card - ALWAYS - which I also enjoy ;)

The reason they lose a star isn't even really their fault, but it does deserve to be said - cell phone service is RARE. I've received many angry text messages and voicemails after being unreachable for the few hours I spent enjoying my Goose Island Matilda and Ahi Poke Stack. No bueno. However, although Yard House doesn't provide WiFi as stated on this page, Town Square does and I have been known to bring my laptop with me for a working lunch here. 

With both afternoon and late night happy hours - you can't lose. Unless you hate food and alcohol and prefer to live in a cave chewing on cardboard. In that place, you should probably get off Yelp."}
{"text":"I've been going to Yard House happy hour for a while now. Great prices, great food, even though the ambiance is always a bit too loud.

On a previous visit we got there at 5:55pm and asked if we could still take part in the happy hour which ends at 6pm. They said it was fine, as we had arrived before 6pm and they would be seating us in a few minutes. At 6:05pm they seated others who came in after us. They forgot about us, which wasn't a big deal, and got us seated right away with the happy hour pricing once we brought it to their attention. 

Fast forward the year end, and we go at 5:30pm and the wait is now 15-25minutes. The people in the front won't guarantee happy hour pricing, and when told that it was done for us in the past, said we would have to ask the server we get. We waited maybe 5 minutes as we stewed on...\"Why the heck should we wait almost half an hour for a pricing we may or may not even get, which is why we came in the first place???\"

To the front people: Call the manager if you don't know or aren't sure."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this Yard House.  I was pleased how fast Diane and I were seated, given the multitude of diners in the vicinity of this rather dark and cavernous place.  And our server was friendly, and rendered excellent service.

Deviled Eggs topped by bits of bacon were creamy, and Chicken Lettuce Wraps contained moist chicken, except I would have preferred that the meat not be formed in cubes.  On the other hand, a Roasted Turkey Club, accompanied by serviceable French Fries, was a solid choice for comfort food.  No pressed turkey meat here!

The only negatives encountered on this night were a really loud noise level inside the dining room, and successive waves of circulating cool air that caused hot food to lose its heat rather rapidly. 

3-1/2 stars overall!"}
{"text":"Yum! I don't get here very often but when I do it's yummy. I love the tomato bisque with grilled cheese but today I decided to try something different and went with the Vodka Shrimp Pasta. The shrimp was perfectly cooked but could use some seasoning for flavor, the vodka sauce was also good but again some more seasoning is needed. Our server was great!! He checked in on us periodically and was on point. I wish I would have gotten his name but I didn't."}
{"text":"150+ beers on tap. Need I say more? 

 ALL KINDS of good beer. TONS of good beer. Come for the beer. 

 The food was actually pretty good as well. Got some seared Ahi Tuna appetizer and my main course was some jamaican jerk chicken of some sort that had a bunch of shrimp in it as well. It was damn good. 

 Staff was friendly and even though the place was packed I got seated right away. 

 They have these 32 oz beers (maybe 24 oz) that come in these super tall 3 foot glasses. There a pain in the ass to actually drink out of but there the most beer bang for your buck I believe. 

 They have outdoor seating with all these water spigots spraying all over the place but I didn't exactly want that all over my food plus I love the AC so we ate inside. 

 I got some Spaten Bock and a few other beers I can't remember but they were all good. 

 I love this joint and I'll be back for sure. The long hallway / fridge with all the kegs you can look at is like a dream come true. You gotta check it out., it's to the left of the front door right after you walk in."}
{"text":"The place it's nice. I will give a 4 star for the interior, 4 star for the food and drinks, and 2 for the service. It takes forever for the servers to approach and also forever for the food to be served. Btw feels like they need a dishwasher or a new dish washing machine. If the owner it's reading this review ( please hire few more servers ) I like this place and it feels that every time it's getting worst. 

I will recommend this place for a friend"}
{"text":"A friend of mine wanted to meet for lunch around the Westgate Entertainment District so we decided on trying the Yard House.

Quite please with how quickly we were able to be seated considering it was during the normal lunch hour.

The menu offered a nice selection of foods including many more healthy options instead of just your usual bar-fare.

As for drinks, if you are a beer drinker they offer a very large selection of beers.

I tried the house IPA which was not bad, but tasted more like a pale ale rather than an IPA (low bitterness and lack of hop profile).

Over the services was very good with friendly staff but receiving items we ordered including drinks was rather slow.

Outside of that the Yard House is certainly a nice place to consider especially if the weather is nice since it offers a large patio with plenty of seating."}
{"text":"Smaller portion than it in the town square. More rooming but long wait to get the food"}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is SO SLOW. If you have time to burn then this place is a great option because you are definitely not getting out of here in a reasonable amount of time. I'm not sure if it is because they are under staffed or what the reason but the service was inexcusably slow. The food is yummy but a little pricy, however, I think that this place lends itself to a certain clientele. So the higher price is kind of expected at a place like this."}
{"text":"The portions are so small for the high price and the food was less than mediocre. 
Got a dinner scallop meal and there were only 4 small scallops but 2 huge useless lettuce leaves taking up the plate"}
{"text":"Great food, REALLY SLOW service (do NOT come here if you're on a tight schedule). To be fair, we came with more than 10 people, but incredibly it took them 20 minutes to bring us water, another 10 minutes before they even took our order, and an additional 15 minutes after that for drinks to come (if you do the math, my first sip of beer took 45 minutes). Luckily for Yard House, I really like white ales and the house white ale was smooth and refreshing - I also got a half-yard so I was happily buzzed for the rest of my meal. I got the Nashville Hot Chicken and was actually blown away by how flavorful and juicy the chicken was. The waffle was a 5/10 but I could eat that chicken every day for the rest of my life. Highly recommend getting this dish if you like fried chicken."}
{"text":"This place is alright. It's large, and has a ton of large TVs which I think would be good for watching a football game. The beer selection is large, the food is average, and the service is good. I'd go back, but probably just for drinks to watch a game."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Yard House at Red Rock Station Casino. We met some friends visiting from Scottsdale and their friend from Florida. We started with the hot and spicy edamame and fried Brussels sprout and potatoes appetizers along with our drinks. The edamame was so well received that we ordered a second. Since appetizers were going so well we decided to make a dinner out of them and ordered: grilled Korean BBQ beef, Buffalo wings, Wisconsin fried cheese curds (one friend is from the mid-west) and coconut shrimp. All the dishes were well prepared and flavorful with the Korean BBQ beef being the top choice. Served with a choice of brown or Jasmine rice, spinach, daikon radish and green onion it was outstanding and would easily be an entrée dinner next time we go. Our server, Dallas, was friendly, attentive and all around great. All in all it was a wonderful first experience and it won't be long before we return."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. I cannot fault it. It's typical pub grub, but with some other variations too. But for me, the real highlight is all the draft beers that have their own menu. Over 100 on tap if memory serves me correctly!

If you're ever in this part of Vegas, eating and drinking here is a must!"}
{"text":"My buddy like to go here for the beer selection. And that is good! But the last time we went and ordered food from the happy hour menu, very disappointing. Sliders were dry hockey pucks, onion rings all greasy breading, hardly any onion, everything poor - mediocre at best. No plans to return."}
{"text":"I come to this place every time I'm in Vegas because it's just that good. I love having a huge selection of craft beers. The happy hour prices can't be beat with half off appetizers and the food is amazing! I always get their version of a California roll. They have just about anything you can think of on the menu from tacos and pizza to burgers and truffle fries. The bartenders have a lot of knowledge on both the beer and food selections."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: The \"3 star\" rating is for certain aspects of my second visit.  My first visit rocked. I really hope to edit this post after one more visit.

I've been to other Yard Houses in Las Vegas and Cincinnati and I loved my experiences!  When I heard about one coming to Crocker Park, I was very excited.  This is definitely my kind of dining/drinking establishment because of the selection and quality.

My first visit was definitely a 5 star experience.  We stopped on Sunday for dinner and were lucky enough to squeeze in at the bar.  The place was packed with several parties waiting to be seated.  The female bartender that took care of us was phenomenal.  She had extensive beer knowledge and offered suggestions based on our tastes.  I'm not sure of the exact number of draft handles they have, but I'd venture to guess there are at least 100.  I had a White Rajah from Brew Kettle and an Anti-hero from Revolution.   Two of my favorites.  

The food is impeccable.  I sampled the truffle fries (the best in the area), the lobster, crab, and artichoke dip, and the garlic noodles.  I know it sounds like a strange combination, but I wanted to try something from different areas of the menu.  Everything we tried was outstanding.  Even on my second visit, I have to commend the chefs on providing excellent food.

So, about the second visit........it was laughable!  I couldn't believe how \"night and day\" the service was considering it had only been 2 days since my last visit.  I always go out with work friends on Fridays and the days before a holiday.  It was early and the place wasn't crowded at all.  We easily found 4 seats at the bar.  However, there was nobody in sight to take our drink order.  After several attempts to flag someone down (15 minutes), we decided to move to a table.  We were seated promptly and greeted by a waitress who told us she would be right back after she dropped off some checks.  It was at least 10 minutes before she came back. My friends always order long islands.  Literally, that's all they drink.  So I'm comfortable with their critique of this particular cocktail.  Another 10 minute wait for the drinks.  I could see the frustration on my friend's faces as they had to wait after a long day of work.  Then, the \"long islands\" arrived and the frustration turned into sadness.  They looked watered down and more like lemonade instead of the usual color of a long island.  We are now 30 minutes into the visit, and now they have drinks that taste disgusting.  They were immediately sent back.  Then the waitress said they can fix it by putting it into a smaller glass or more alcohol can be added with an additional charge.  What?  How about just making a long island correctly!  They just ended up switching to Moscow mules. 

The frustration was calmed after a couple of mules and delicious appetizers.  We started to have a good time and laugh about the day's events when our waitress provided an absolute buzz kill by her request.  She let us know that she was leaving and wanted us to settle up our bill so she could go.  Ugh.  I eat out quite a bit, and this practice is one of my biggest pet peeves.  It was magnified by the fact that we were finally having a good time after the mistakes and long wait times.  So I gladly agreed to settle up our bill.  We all received separate checks and 2 of us paid and 2 didn't.  The server station was next to our table and I noticed the waitress STARING at me because I hadn't settled up yet.  As soon as I put my card in she snatched it off the table.  I signed the credit card receipt and wrote in zero for tip because I like to leave a cash tip.  As I was reaching into my wallet for the money, the bill was once again snatched off the table and poof, she was gone.  We were planning on staying for a few more rounds, but we weren't feeling it after all of the debacles of the visit.  I left the tip on the table, and who knows who ended up with it.

My friends won't be coming back, but I'm determined to give them one more try."}
{"text":"this place blows.  management came to my table to blow smoke about the amount of head there should be on my beer. The Turkey pot pie had only 4 pieces of turkey in it and so much salt in it, it raised my blood pressure. frys were cold, scallops were the size of nickels. I have eaten here 3 times before and never had this bad service or food. I am VERY disappointed in the service and management that thinks every one just fell off turnip truck.  very sad Will stick with the LINQ location.  They seem to understand that if \"you don't take care of the customer,  someone else will\"."}
{"text":"I dropped by on a Friday night, and was told there was a 25 minute wait, even though there were 19 (I counted) empty tables and nobody in front of me. Management? You need some serious help.

But I went back on Tuesday, because I was lured in by the sign. World's largest beer selection, it said. And I like beer. I would not be deterred. I would come back. 

Sadly, it was a bald faced lie. They didn't have *any* of the beers I could think of. And I went through a lot. You know, guys, there are other countries besides the U.S., and they make really good beer. If you're going to advertise yourself like that, you'd better deliver. And you didn't come close.

Anyway, I turned my attention to the food. It's a pretty large, diverse menu, from a (chain?) restaurant in the middle of the desert. I really wasn't expecting much. I hate chain restaurants. But I was already committed.

Then, Vanessa recommended I try the tacos. Thank you, Vanessa. You single-handedly redeemed the entire experience.

The short rib taco and the pork belly taco were truly amazing. And I've had tacos freaking everywhere. Seriously, these were worth the trip. They were incredible. I'm tempted to call a cab just so I can come back for more. Skip the rice and beans. Just get the tacos. Lots of them.

And say hi to Vanessa for me. She's smart, sweet, and gorgeous, even though she wouldn't go to the movies with me afterwards. Cheers!"}
{"text":"The place is clean, and well run, and the food is pretty good.  We happened to eat here during a happy hour special and everything we ordered (appetizers and entrees) were all half price.

A nice variety of food at a resonible price."}
{"text":"WoW. 1 word to describe this place. Let me start by saying there was no wait during a busy saturday. Service was incredible for a busy place. Food is delicious. A must try. Thier spicy adamame is probably the best i have ate to date."}
{"text":"Seriously great food (and amazing service). We popped in here for some grub after a day at the pool at the Flamingo, and we were taken care of by Tiffany who was super pleasant and helpful (as well as enthusiastic about celebrating our 3 birthdays with free dessert). The poké nachos are GREAT! I also enjoyed the margherita pizza. My friends had the vampire tacos and enjoyed those as well. One of my friends has celiac disease and the staff went out of their way to accommodate her needy needs (haha!). This is a solid place with a variety-packed menu. I recommend it!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere sitting outside enjoying drinks and appetizers. Our waitress Samantha was very nice and accomodating!!! Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Good but pricey food, hard rock music, 100 taps of beer that are mostly craft, and decent service too.  Booths are nice and large.  No real wait at the bar during lunch hour.  Gardein vegetarian items are tasty."}
{"text":"Great outdoor seating area for good weather months, and there's a lot of people watching to be had from these seats.  Service & food quality are the same as the other Yardhouse locations in the valley, but this location is a little less rowdy (which I consider a plus).

Beer selection is great but not so great.  If you're a beer enthusiast, you've already tried at least 90% of the beers.  If you're not a beer enthusiast, you probably won't care that there's so many beers to choose from.  I think they missed the mark by having tons of widely available beers at one place rather than having a lot of hard to find beers that people will like to try for the first time.

Prices are too high - $6 pints, $10 for Spinach dip, etc.

Kona coffee ice cream dessert and homemade brownie are nice desserts."}
{"text":"This is the worst of the Yardhouse locations in Phoenix.  The parking is a royal pain, there's often a wait, and this place gets annoyingly loud during popular sporting events.  Somehow this semi-yuppified place manages to attract all of the thugs who would normally go to a sleezy sports bar and scream at the TV there when their team is losing.  This Yardhouse is in a shopping mall, please go somewhere else.

{"text":"This place is great! The reviews on Yelp are accurate, good food, nice ambience and amazing selection of beers, including Omission gluten free lager and ale!

They have a \"gluten sensitive\" menu, which is unusual, in that it's a version of their regular menu but  with instructions on what you need to REMOVE from your order to get it gluten-free. However, they are at pains to point out that their kitchen is not a gluten free environment, so it may still not be suitable if you're celiac.

I'd definitely go back, but be warned we went mid-week and it was BUSY!

{"text":"when I heard that my friend wanted to spend her birthday dinner at Yard House, I was less than enthused only because the one here in Hallendale was such a disappointment when it came to the food. But the Vegas location was such a treat! The restaurant is casual attire but it had a sophisticated, classy feel. We took an elevator to get to the top floor and passed by the outdoor patio and peep-through kitchen.  Our server Ron was sweet and attentive.  For food, I had the calamari, clam chowder and a cesar salad...all very good and made my initial thoughts of Yard House having bad food go away. But no matter the location, Yard House has great drinks in addition to their extensive beer menu.  My favorites were the moscow mule and the sparkling raspberry cocktail made with my favorite beer: framboise.

We enjoyed it so much that not only did we eat there a second time on our trip, we have decided to make it a tradition on all of our Vegas trips from then on. My only complaint was that there were no restrooms at all upstairs."}
{"text":"Thank you Johnny for recognizing our excitement with our friends who just bought a house and we just bought a car! Johnny surprised us with a treat. Food & service is always exceptional!"}
{"text":"This is where I want to come when I die.  I LOVE beer and you cannot beat all the varieties of beer they have on their menu here.  I shed a little tear each time I walk by the keg refrigerator and see the hundreds of kegs of beer in there.  It's just so beautiful.  Some I've never heard of, some I can't pronounce, yet others leave me scratching my head as to why they are even on the menu.  Why, with all of these great beers out there, would you have PBR on draft?  But I digest...

The food here is better than average with a large variety to choose from.  As far as food options go for happy hour, this place takes the cake.  It seems like half of their menu is on special during happy hour, all for a very good price as well, which is nice because the food here is a bit pricey.

You could honestly make a meal out of some of their appetizers, which stand out from the rest of the menu.  Great sliders, good wings, and a huge seared ahi sashimi plate.  The rest of your menu is your standard pizzas, burgers, sandwiches and so forth, with a few notable exceptions:  jerk chicken with shrimp stack and the mac & cheese are wonderful.  If you are not full from the beer, they have some of the better desserts that I have seen.  There are plenty of large screen TVs here for catching the game, and some pretty good music piped in all the time.

Service can be a bit slow, especially when it is busy, but the servers know a lot about the beer and can easily recommend something new to you based on what you typically drink and like.  They do have a full bar, but I think they should reserve the right to throw you out of the place if you order some foo-foo cocktail at a place with some of the best beers out there.  But that's just me..."}
{"text":"Before heading to the Rave Motion Theater to watch a movie, headed to the Yard House for dinner. This place is huge and there bar is enormous to say the least. Being that it's a huge establishment, wondered how the service would be... right off, the hostess was friendly, helpful and attentive which channeled all the way to the waitresses as well. For being quite crowded, service was quite outstanding.

The meal - Order the NY Steak and fries... yes, I am predictable! For not being an actual steakhouse, the steak was quite flavorful and tasty, more importantly cooked to order. Not bad at all. Patricia order the Malibu chicken and that looked great as well. Great in a sense when you see someone elses plate, one remarks 'man, I should've ordered that!' LOL

For appetizers... recommend the Chicken Nachos.... ah there very good.

Overall, great dinner and service and wonderful environment. Again, a place definitely worth revisiting!"}
{"text":"I love the Yard House.  (I used to live in LA & the Yard House located on the pier in Long Beach is my absolute favorite place to lounge with friends).  The Yard House @ Westgate also has great ambiance.  The bar is always a fun place to sit and outdoor seating is enjoyable especially when the weather is nice.  Outdoors you can choose to sit in comfy patio chairs with cocktail tables or at regular tables that allow you a view of the center fountains.

Service--I've always had great service from the staff, even on a crowded night.  They always seem friendly and fun.  They do their best to accommodate and make decent recommendations when you're not sure what to order.

Food--The spinach dip is wonderful as an appetizer.  I usually order the thai chicken or walnut pear salad which I always get with the dressing on the side, in case I don't finish. I tried the roasted turkey pot pie once, which is HUGE and could feed 2 easily.  It held up well and wasn't half bad reheated....Beer is ALWAYS good.  I've never had a beer there that I didn't like and a while ago, you used to be able to buy a whole 'yarder', where they served you a beer in a yard long glass.  My out of town guests loved ordering the 'yarder' b/c it was a unique experience.  

Cost--I do have to agree with some of the other posters--the prices could be better but I enjoy it there so much, that's just the trade off."}
{"text":"Amazing selection of beers in a cool place inside Red Rock Casino. Was quoted 30 minute wait but closer to an hour before we were seated. We sat outside on a big table which was great. Ordered Tomato Bisque , Lettuce Wraps for appetizers . No complaints , really very good. Mains were Crab Crusted Swordfish , Turkey Burger & Orange Chicken . The fish was very slightly overcooked & a little chewy , burger was fine and the Orange Chicken was delicious . Full Sail Amber beer was a delight & wifee enjoyed a Chardonnay. Varied crowd included families , couples and groups . Observation; guys wearing  flip-flops , it's not the pool WHY???? 
I will be back but will try to avoid weekends , wait is too long and should be accurately communicated."}
{"text":"Amazing food! everything we tried over the last half dozen visits was worth it. The filet was amazing!"}
{"text":"The food at yard house is delicious.  High ratings on the lamb burger. I ordered the Mac n cheese with no mushrooms. My meal came with mushrooms and the waiter was quick to make everything right."}
{"text":"Love yard house. Always consistent with the food. We like to pop in late night for a cocktail And light snack. I always get the tuna sashimi and it is always spot on. The bar staff is friendly and outgoing. It's a great neighborhood stop! They make a great Moscow Mule if you're a Fan."}
{"text":"Place is great for happy hour. You get full portions versus Iate night bar portions. You can't beat the Happy hour prices. We always leave here with extra food and only come during happy hour."}
{"text":"Wanted to make a reservation for my boyfriends birthday and they wouldn't accommodate on a Saturday. Had to take my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Yardhouse does not disappoint. I'm typically not a big fan of chains like this but Yardhouse delivers consistent gourmet bar food with a great lineup of beers on tap. There are a bunch of TV's and outdoor dining which is a plus as well."}
{"text":"I end up coming here for any celebration and most of my date nights. I always leave this place full and satisfied! The staff is very considerate. It is a high energy environment. And LOUD, but in a good way. The music is fun. Their menu for both food and drinks is HUGE!! you could spend an hour just trying to figure out what you want. I always start with the Hot and Spicy Edamame! It is a must try! 
They're also open late. I believe they close at 1am. I would recommend getting there around midnight just in case they take a last seating."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to a Yard House in years but when your lady friends tell you that there is a bomb happy hour, you listen. 

I was stoked to see that they have the new Angry Orchard Rosé on tap so I went ahead and ordered myself two of those. Our server, Eric, was a lot of fun and took care of four grown women and five kiddos with ease. As a former server I know that this can be a daunting task and he was rad. We were a handful and he was a true gentleman. One small snag was lipstick on my water glass but he swapped it out for me quickly once I brought it to his attention.

Their happy hour menu really is legit. We pretty much ordered the entire menu. A few highlights for me were the sliders, because I'm sucker for a tiny burger, and the onion rings. I wasn't a fan of the poke nachos like the rest of my crew and the poke stack was overkill.

I would go back for the rosé cider alone, in fact, I just might."}
{"text":"We tried yardhouse for the first time due to receiving a coupon in the mail. We are new to the area so that is helping us find our new spots. I have to say, the food was pretty great. Service was quick and very friendly. The only negative  was I ordered the chicken lettuce wraps and they came with some pretty large chunks of tofu, which I didn't know would be in them. The waitress even said she has never seen any chunks that large. I hate tofu, but did my best to pick them out. My S/O ordered the poke nachos and they were exceptional."}
{"text":"Fantastic pepper filet, the beer selection was impressive. Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"On our last night in Vegas,we wanted to get a drink outside of our hotel. This was the best bar experience that I had out of the 3 nights we were here in vegas. I asked our charming bartender Allie what local beers she could recommend me (coming from Florida I wanted to try some favorites out West) she was very helpful and offered me samples of what sounded interesting to me and also made suggestions. I ended up LOVING what she suggested (Alaskan Amber) & her attitude was so refreshing because all the bars we wandered in our hotel (the Delano) were HIGH priced drinks, I'm taking PBR tall boys for $9, with unfriendly bartenders who were not genuine to me at all. THANK YOU ALLIE FOR GIVING US SUCH A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE!!"}
{"text":"Went here last month with coworkers while we were visiting one of our properties in Glendale. The one in Scottsdale was excellent, so I was hoping this one would be the same. Glendale did not disappoint! 

Appetizers: 
Onion Ring Tower - I'm not a big fan of onion rings, so when my coworker ordered these, I was thinking \"maybe I'll pass\". However, they were actually quite good, especially with the chipotle and ranch dipping sauces. 

Blue Crab Cakes - Love crab cakes! These were pretty good! Liked the chutney that accompanied it. 

Main Course: 
New York Steak and Fries - I wanted MEAT and I got MEAT!! I finally broke down and ordered it \"medium\" (I've been a \"WELL DONE\" customer forever). It was juicy and flavorful. With a little A-1, it was filling (I'm sad to say I still had a few bites left I could not polish off )! 

Dessert: 
Kona Coffee Ice Cream Sundae - I swear I thought I was full! Of course, you only live once, so I went for it! Everybody, and I mean EVERYBODY, watched my dessert as it came through the door and to our table! Holy crap! HUGE!!! REALLY HUGE! Guess what? I ate most of it! Here's the description: 

\"java chip ice cream topped with Oreo cookie crumbles, macadamia nuts and chocolate sauce. served with macadamia nut cookie\" 

I didn't eat until lunch the next day! So worth it! 

Atmosphere: 

Eat outside! Let people be envious of what you order here! 

Bathrooms: 

LOL! We all agreed the bathrooms had really nice fixtures. Seriously! By the way, it was clean! 

Can't wait for my next visit to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I know many people don't like Yard House because it's a chain, to corporate blah blah blah... But in all honesty, they are consistent no matter where you go, the food is always good and they have an amazing selection of beers that seem to vary from time to time. Also, no matter how slow or busy, their service is always on par and deserving of a four star Yelp rating. 

On my most recent visit for lunch, our server was solid and the burger I ordered came out just right. My only gripe against this place is the lack of real french fries. Sorry, I don't count those weird shoe string fries but they do offer sweet potato fries if you so fancy. Overall, when all else fails and I am hungry but do not know where to go for dinner or lunch, Yard House always fits the bill. Plus they have a great happy hour also!"}
{"text":"Yard House is a pretty solid place when it comes to good food, good drink and a great place to meet up with your friends or watch the game. I mean where can you go wrong when a place has more beers on tap than you can really think of? Unfortunately, the beer selection does vary a bit state by state but you should be able to find something you enjoy. 

Some of my personal favorites include their clam chowder, the seared ahi and the sliders. Granted, I do my best to vary it up as much as possible because their menu is so vast. 

Make sure to call ahead on busy Friday and Saturday evenings as this place does get packed and the wait times can exceed one hour."}
{"text":"Went for a lunch for a friend's birthday. It was my first time here and I loved it. I had the sweet potato fries which came with a maple syrup dipping sauce - amazing! I also had the thai chicken pizza - this was sooo good. Love the crunchy crust.

Our waiter took very good care of us and when he noticed my Australian accent he introduced me to their server who was also Australian. It was really nice to chat with her and I appreciated that personal touch.

We also got a delicious chocolate soufflé to share for my friend's birthday. Came with a happy birthday message written on the plate in cocoa - nice touch.

All in all a great experience and delicious food. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"So many amazing beers on tap and good service Francis is the best expo ever can't wait for him to be a server so i can come back"}
{"text":"This is a fun place with great food, huge variety of draft beers, amazing happy hour!!  It was even better a couple of months ago before it got too crowded to even get a seat.  I guess that helps explain how good it is (or, wait, I think it is just because of Town Square).  

I just liked it a lot more initially because it was a chill local place to go, but now its just like all the tourist places - packed and unwelcoming!!  I may still go there though for the good late-nite happy hour, only as long as they continue to accept reservations."}
{"text":"Food is good and happy hour is better but the service leaves a lot to be desired.  Staff turnover is often, you will never see the same person twice.  Last time I was in it was slow at 4PM and I sat for 15 minutes at the bar, couldn't get attention if I set myself on fire.  Then a couple came in next to me and got a menu in seconds!  While this was going on, the manager was standing around the cashiers area yakking with 3 of the female servers.  This happens often.  But it is a chain so we expect this. You should if you eat here too.
I also was working for an undercover business who hires spies to go in and evaluate the food and service and when they offered me this place to do a report on I couldn't wait. But the job was cancelled because  Yardhouse HQ said they didn't want anyone over the age of 50 doing the report.  And after all the $$ I have spent here over the years!!  Well Yardhouse if you don't think that people over 50 are suitable to evaluate your business then you don't need my over 50 money either.  I am boycotting this place and if you are over 50 I suggest you do too."}
{"text":"I only placed an online PICK UP order (I thought it would save me time since I had work to do!) and was shocked when the wait was going to be 55-60 minutes. Once I got my food, not much further impressed when I had no salad dressing. I also ordered street tacos (I think they called them,) the pork wasn't bad but the Kobe short rib I wouldn't recommend... the meat was pretty tough."}
{"text":"The steak and shrimp were amazing. Service was good. Appetizers were tiny to the point our table of 7 laughed and made jokes about how miniature they were. My mashed potatoes were supposed to be garlic mashed. WOW, I had a hard time eating them they were so garlic infused I was scared for my next appointment. My friend to the left of me asked me to box them up quickly because her eyes were watery. Good found, they would have earned a 4 star if the potatoes were not so garlicy, a 5 star would have happened if the appetizer portion was bigger. We were considering deviled eggs but was informed that we would get 3 - 1/2 eggs. Again we laughed at the portion sizes!"}
{"text":"Excellent food at Las Vegas reasonable prices.  Great selection of dishes and drinks. Service was solid.  Five stars but for problem with reservations"}
{"text":"It saddens me to give a poor review because I've been going here for years and love the menu. Significant other and I stopped in after hockey game. Ordered a couple appetizers and some chowder....none of it was edible. Lobster/crab dip looked and tasted like carrot paste. Spinach/cheese dip was black and looked like they forgot to put cheese in it. Chowder was tangy, luke-warm and old...clams were un-chewable. So disappointing.
When waitress came to table after food was served, you could see the look of horror on her face as she glanced at the food. She insisted the manager come to the table. He did, and removed items from our bill; however, instead of acknowledging how the food CLEARLY appeared awful, he told us how we were the only ones to complain that night. Really.
I sense the issue in the kitchen might not be the only one here....think I'll take a break from this location for a bit."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service! Ordered the sliders off of the appetizer menu and they were pink on the inside. The server went to make them again. The manager came over right away to apologize and offered me some french fries while I waited for the food. The server brought out the second plate and the burgers were practically raw. I told the server. The manager immediately came over again and told us she would take it off the check and offered a free dessert. Even though the food was not that great, the customer service made up for it. Will definitely be coming back in the future; I just maybe won't order the sliders again."}
{"text":"If you are looking for good taste/quality beer, that's the place! The food is good as well and they even have a delicious lemon suffle with raspberries and home made whipping cream."}
{"text":"It is very hard to find something bad to say about this place. I have been to the location at town square and this one at the Linq. The one I will say is that the customer service is great. The servers are very attentive and accommodating. The food comes out pretty quick and the drinks are really good. I ate outside on the balcony and it was pretty cool to people watch and eat. The temp was around 75 so it wasn't crazy hot. 

I have not had a bad item on the menu at all. I recommend if you are with a group to order many dishes and share. 

This is the perfect combination of great service, great pricing, and great food. 

Pros -  Location, price, drinks, food choices, atmosphere, staff

Cons -  Parking"}
{"text":"Very extensive menu with a large beer menu.  Love trying out different items each time we go and have not found much of anything I would not order again.  Just stay away when there is a sporting event nearby, the staff is overwhelmed and the lines are long, Live and learn,   go when there is not a sporting event."}
{"text":"Nice friendly staff.   If you been to one it's all about the same. Service is Excellent!!   Great choices of beer!!  Lobster noodles were very good and full of seafood, chicken nachos was piled high and great taste as well, vampire tacos- crunchy with a splendid taste.  Food came out very quickly."}
{"text":"Great food. Cheap price. Specially on happy hour.
Half off draft beers and appetizers. 

Appetizers are very large portion. 

Restaurants kind of cold and dark.  
Excellent service.  Good vibes."}
{"text":"Good place for beer. But horrible management and there are so many open tables it's ridiculous.  The food is good too but like I said, lack of proper planning with clearing off tables and sitting people!?!!?"}
{"text":"Great food for a chain restaurant. Had the Poke appetizer and Pineapple Chicken special. The chicken is served with a brown rice-edamam bowl that was nice. Waivers are friendly enough but not as attentive as I would like. Had to flag them for the check and again to take it. Overall though a nice meal."}
{"text":"I've been to Yard House many times and I've always liked everything I've ordered. There isn't one particular item I would recommend but I would suggest their happy hour! Lots of great things on the menu for a reasonable price.  

I've always had great service at all locations I've visited. 

Restaurant has low lighting, so if you like a  bright place, Yard House isn't for you."}
{"text":"***Appetizer: Pineapple Poke!

I have actually dreamed about this dish- that resulted in me returning just to savor the delicious tuna creation.

Both times I have gone I have just shared an assortment of appetizers... because they're so good! I'm looking forward to returning in the near future. Perhaps I will advance to an actual entree??!

My BF loves the assortment of Micro brews on tap and they're served by very personable staff-complimentary.

There is ALWAYS a wait after sporting events so I'd recommend sneaking out of the game early to grab a spot or weather the wait while sipping your favorite cocktail at the bar and hope to snag someones spot."}
{"text":"As an experience Yard House customer, this place is bottom of the barrel. Or bottom of the keg, if you really want to joke about it.

Went here for happy hour with friends. Horrible pours. Substandard. See my post a picture."}
{"text":"I went for takeout on a packed Thursday evening. I didn't see any signs for takeout, so I went in the back to the host stand where I assumed it was. Upon asking to place an order, I was informed that a \"takeout specialist\" would be summoned.  This is ominous sounding if you think about it, and that didn't distract me from the fact that no one seemed to be designated for takeout orders. 

After waiting for the \"specialist\", I ordered the skirt steak salad, which was $17.45. As listed on the menu, the salad should have steak, peppers, avocado, asparagus, chips, onion, tomato, pickled egg, gorgonzola vinaigrette. Mine had no avocado and a few small pieces of tomato, which I discovered after I was home. No wonder it was ready rather quickly. For $17.45, leaving off even one item is f#c&ed up.

I expected a big salad, and this one had plenty of steak but needed more lettuce, as well as all the ingredients as listed. Instead of using asparagus tips, the pieces I had were pretty bland tasting. The red peppers were pretty good, and the pickled egg was OK. The dressing was mostly gorgonzola chunks. There were quite a few chips, which are very garlicky. I liked them. The salad was presented to go nicely, with the steak in a separate container & dressing on the side. They got that right, for sure. No bread, however, maybe they forgot that too???"}
{"text":"I'm not a beer person. Not at all. But my girlfriend is and wanted to go there. So we went. Happy hour is the best! The ahi poke, and poke nachos are AMAZING. The cocktails were amazing. And the staff was all super friendly. I regret I don't remember our bartenders name, or Id give him specific credit as well. Overall its great. 

Don't miss the poke nachos."}
{"text":"Ate there for lunch on a weekday. Service was very slow, which during lunchtime is unacceptable because people need to return to work. 

I had the traditional burger, fries were delicious, burger wasn't spectacular and pretty charred on the outside, but wasn't inedible either. 

Our server was very nice and apologized for the long waits for food. Maybe as a bar this place is better for customers but I wouldn't go again for the food."}
{"text":"So I came here on my birthday and I've never had a problem with this location. Well first off we were seated with no silverware and was told we will get it soon. So we order our drinks, appetizers and main courses. We actually got one of the main courses first, it was a pizza so we just brushed it off and waited for the rest. After that my jambalaya came out and get this, STILL NO SILVERWARE!! Half of my rice was overlooked and was like eating plastic. The best part is we got our appetizers last. One single plate of cheese curds. Needless to say I will not be returning and my birthday dinner was a bit of a let down /: 
Didn't even stay for dessert..."}
{"text":"The food has always been good and the drinks are always large and well priced. My kids like the kids menu and I've never been disappointed. It is always busy and you do have to wait but it's worth it."}

{"text":"Thanks to a Las Vegas talk thread on Happy Hours, we ended up at the Yard House for what else? Happy Hour! HH is not common in Canada and it's one of the things I love most about the USA! While ironically not a fan of beer, YH had $4.25 Well Drinks that were very boozy! Of the huge selection of 1/2 priced pizzas and appy's, my partner and I tried the Pepperoni and Mushroom Pizza, Buffalo Wings, and the Fried Calamari over two wonderful HH's. My favorites being the Buffalo Wings and Well Drinks! For the price and value of HH at the Yard House, I have no complaints. This will be one of our regular stops in the Vegas area!"}
{"text":"This was our first time at Yard House and maybe my expectations were higher than they should've been.  The place reminded me a lot of BJ's restaurant, although this place had more of a different twist to their menu.  They also serve a ton of beer!  The display of all of the beer kegs right when you enter is quite impressive!  Since I'm not much of a beer drinker, I opted for the fruitier belgian drink called the Lindeman's Framboise.  It's seriously an alcoholic juice...very dangerous!  

As for food, I think our eyes were hungrier than our stomachs!  We ordered the Truffle Fries (shredded parmesan and herbs) with a hint of garlic.  It was delish!  Then we ordered the Ahi Poke Bowl with some fried wontons that were also quite tasty.  Then we ordered Pastrami sliders which did not meet my standards.  I have had better pastrami burgers and this one was on the salty side.  The hubby also ordered Moo  Shu Egg Rolls (no good) and Chinese Garlic Noodles.  Maybe I was delusional to think that the garlic noodles would come close to Thanh Long's.  

All in all, if you want lots of beer variety and a good atmosphere, then this place is for you.  Just don't expect them to excel in the food department."}
{"text":"I went today and wasn't super impressed. The service was very slow and it took forever for our waitress to take our orders- good thing we only ordered appetizers. I can't imagine how long it would have taken to order food.. She seemed like she had no idea what she was doing. I'm typically a fan of Yardhouse and have never had problems with it before but this experience was average. Maybe it was the time of day or maybe it was just the server. I don't know.

I'd give this location another shot just in case it was just a bad server. I'm not going to let this bad experience hinder my view of Yardhouse."}
{"text":"I've been searching LV for good beer choices and Yard House has to be the best one yet.  I FINALLY found a good bar/restaurant that serves Kilkenny on tap!  Thanks Yard House (I hear you have great food to go with great beer too - what a concept).
The bartenders were busy (Sat night and the place was packed), but still got to me for an order quickly."}
{"text":"I have been to several Yard Houses across the country and am typically a big fan of their beer selection. Yard House usually does a good job of mixing standard craft beer offerings with harder to find, local stuff. 

Well... I was a big fan until I came here.  Unfortunately, the beer selection at this location was lacking. They only had one or two local IPAs on tap and most beer on offer was from companies purchased by In Bev. True shame but what are you going to do? Yard House still offers a solid selection of beer for the strip.. AND you can bring the beer to go. This in itself is awesome and makes the place worthy of a visit. 

The menu was the same as all the other Yard Houses across the country. The food wasn't overpriced for being on the strip but it certainly isn't worth a trek either. I would come here to get a beer to go, but nothing more."}
{"text":"Amazing place . Delicious food , bazillion types of beer and great service ! We eat here at least once a week and I'm always looking for it!"}
{"text":"You will have plenty of televisions for your sports viewing pleasure.

My buddy and I ate here three times in two consecutive days.

The food was decent if not fantastic. 

The first time, I had the BBQ Bacon Cheddar Burger, which was decent, as was the service.

The second time, I had the Southern Fried Chicken Breast over spinach-corn mashed potatoes.  The breast was a bit meh, but service was decent.

The third time was the service from hell.  I arrived at the restaurant around 8 PM and were promptly seated.  We were also told that there was a large party, so we may have to wait for our order, which we understood.  The waitress quickly takes our order.  Around forty minutes later, the waitress returns and reminds us that there is a large party and our order may be delayed.  We get a little suspicious.  The waitress had forgotten to put our order in!!!!    But it gets better.   After another fifteen minutes, our order arrives, but it is not what we ordered.  The manager comes by and apologizes and comps our meal.  At least we did not have to pay.  I had the small portion of vegetarian angel hair pasta, which was pretty small.

I could have given them one star, but the first two times was decent."}
{"text":"I'm upset with myself that I didn't discover this place sooner as I'm ALWAYS at the Red Rock Casino. I've eaten here three times within 2 weeks and have been pleased each time. It's always busy, wondering if the entire Summerlin is eating there, but despite the volume of people they handle everything extremely well. The ladies upfront that you check in with are always pleasant and attentive. There's normally always a wait, but the wait is worth it and they normally buzz you earlier than they tell you the wait is. I recommend happy hour which has an amazing appetizer called Poke Nachos. I also love the mushroom lettuce wraps. Aside from the amazing food, they have one of the best waiters in town. He provides excellent service each time, that I request him when I go in. His name is DERICK and he's consistent with being attentive to where you never have to ask for anything or flag him down. He''s always watching the table no matter how busy it is. I highly recommend trying DERICK as your server as you wont be disappointed, along with the amazing food Yard House has to offer. Excellent Service+ Excellent food=THE BEST!

P.S. Not a place to take a date. It's really loud and you won't be able to have a conversation."}
{"text":"The service was great and the food was definately above average but the two Kale salads that were ordered literally had no Kale in them so the server had to get 2 bowls of Kale to add. Lots of good beers on tap and a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Stephen is awesome! We've been to this place over a dozen times and have never had service like we had last night. Would have gladly paid double the menu price of it meant he was our server. It's safe to say we'll be back for another dozen times. I'm sure it helps that they have such a wide selection of brews and food, too!"}
{"text":"This place is what I expected.  The beer selection was extensive and the servers were knowledgeable about the beer menu, which I liked.  They offered many local options as well as other expected beer choices.  The appetizers were reasonably priced and good.  For my entree, I had the pork cuban sandwich.  It tasted good and service was great as well.  Good outdoor seating. I would recommend."}
{"text":"My review is specifically for Super Bowl Sunday when the Seahawks were playing the Patriots at the Phoenix Arena. 

To start, this was one of the only places around that was NOT charging a cover to get in. At 10AM the line to get in wrapped around the place and it was at least an hour wait. At some point they reached maximum capacity and were no longer letting people inside. 

Once inside, I had friends at both the bar and at a few tables. Given how crazy busy this place was ALL the bartenders, servers, employees did an excellent job of making sure everyone was getting everything they needed. 

They have a HUGE selection of beers on tap. All the food we tried here was good too. The truffle fries are a must try. The pizza is good, and you can customize the toppings. We ordered wings, an order in every sauce and my favorite was the Jerk. We also had an order of the chicken rice bowl, and the flavor was very good."}
{"text":"Like their many other locations, this Yard House has an amazing beer selection of international, domestic and even local brews.  I've been to the Roseville and San Jose locations in CA as well as the one in Waikiki.  

They are consistent and always seem to deliver great service and pretty decent food though I'm usually having appetizers and beer.  My favorite food items are the tacos of which the Korean one is my favorite."}

My friends and I can't get enough of Yard House's happy hour. They serve delicious food and for a great price! Their servings are pretty big! I always go to happy hour with a group of friends and we all end up sharing everything at the table. 

Buffalo chicken wings- Yummy, tasty, and has a little kick! Served with celery sticks and ranch.
Chicken lettuce wraps- Healthy and crunchy. They give you about 5 or 6 lettuce cups and three different sauces. So the flavor choice is all up to you!
California roll- Don't be fooled by it being just \"one\" California roll, but it's HUGE. It's a jumbo California roll!
Calamari- Crispy and cooked perfectly! Squeeze some lemons and dip it in the spicy tomato sauce and it is TO DIE FOR.
Spinach dip- Delicious!! Comes with chips. And it's A LOT.
Classic sliders- Comes with 4 mini sliders. They give you mustard and ketchup bottles. It comes with a pickle slice and fries. The fries are skinny, crispy, and leave you wanting more!
Ahi poke- Though it could be a little bigger of a portion, it's really tasty.
Onion tower- They stack a huge tower of onions, fresh to eat!

I've been coming to Yard House forever now and they always have great service and good quality food for their prices."}
{"text":"It was SO busy, we decided to take outside patio dining. It was super cold but there were some heaters a few feet away. Still didn't really help. Our server would come by every so often. Their calamari wasn't as great as the one down in Vegas. Not that crispy and not as big of a portion. I asked for the penne pasta with no mushrooms and it came with mushrooms. That bothered me because what if I were allergic?! Good thing I just don't like mushrooms, I gave them to the honey. He got the wings and the next morning was feeling sick to his stomach!!! That's never happened to us from a Yard House so, 2 stars goes to you for a very unhappy visit. Saddening because Yard House is usually the best hot spot."}
{"text":"The food and service are just average but this place has a great vibe and it is so much fun getting to sample items from the huge beer menu. If you are a beer lover, you will feel like a kid in a candy store. If you are lucky enough to get a knowledgeable server (hit or miss) they can even recommend combinations of beers that can make the experience even more interesting. Same concept as ordering a Black and Tan or Snakebite... but the flavors can get even more complicated if you are adventurous. Its best to go with a large group so you can all try each other's drinks if you really want the full tasting experience. 

This place also has great options for lunch when you are at the mall and they don't seem to get busy until happy hour time. But for me, it can be torture to come here and not be able to drink since I am still \"on the clock\"."}
{"text":"Big shout out to the manager and wait staff for seating my family, 21 people in all and we didn't have to wait forever! Thanks for working with us. Food and drinks were great like at every other Yardhouse. I really liked the BBQ chicken pizza (my cousin ordered it)! Yum! Service was great. Having two waiters and multiple staff delivering food and drinks help tremendously. We were all really hungry and thirsty. I will be back before I leave!"}
{"text":"Cold food. messed up order twice. Ended up not eating because everyone else at the table was done.  Not worth it"}
{"text":"Crispy duck wings with mint, cilantro, red onion, and hot green Thai peppers are amazingly good! Try the flights of beer to get a good sampling of the many beers on tap. The onion ring tower, truffle oil French fries, duck fat potatoes, and excellent cocktails make this place a must at any time. But wait, just when I thought I was happy enough, there's a happy hour! Woohoo! Get over here and try it for yourself. It's good for groups or individuals. People are nice and staff is attentive, especially at the bar. This place rocks and it's only 25 paces from the poker  room at the Red Rock Casino."}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday and were seated on the patio.  Lots of open tables, but the service was a little slow. I do like their food though.  We had the southern fried chicken complete with creamy mashed potatoes, corn and beans.  It was a delicious treat.  We also ordered the nachos, and the kale caesar salad.  All very scrumptious.  Had to wait awhile for refills on drinks and we waited longer than we should have for the bill. A little pet peeve of mine is when businesses suggest a tip or give you a tip guideline.  If I made it to your restaurant and I ordered, believe me, I can figure out an appropriate tip."}
{"text":"This place is always crowded when I go. Even after happy hour has ended during the middle of the week!  So if you are planning a get together, call ahead and make a reservation. Even then, there might still be some additional wait time for the tables to be cleaned up and reset for your party.

The biggest draw for hitting up Yard House is probably their beer selection.  Because the food is just alright overall with highlights here and there that I have discovered. For arranging parties when you don't know where else to go, Yard House is a safe bet.  Everyone in Vegas that goes out even occasionally will know about it.

Love watching sports and paling around with friends or near by strangers?  This is a good spot, if you are willing to wait for an open table or vacant chair at the bar.  There are plenty of flat screens to occupy your attention.

Looking for a quiet intimate and relaxing place to chill and grab a bite?  The noise alone will get this place crossed off the list.  But you are also not going to be spending the kind of money you would expect to pay at a restaurant with nice tablecloth and illuminated by real candle lights.

The service is okay to way above average.  What I do love about coming here with a large party is that the waitstaff has been trained to keep track of who ordered what, so splitting the bill at the end of the night is as painless and effortless on the customer's part as it is going to get.  Uber kudos for that alone!

I would almost give this place a 4 stars, but for that to happen the food has to be better."}
{"text":"Love the Yard House! A great amount if beers on tap. Good wine selection. 
Great food and good lunch option with a choice of salad and soup or salad and a sandwich. 
Orders the turkey club with a house salad. So good, large portions."}
{"text":"Their Beers, burgers, and shoestring fries is what makes Yard House stand out. Beers to try:

Chimay - caramel, dark
New belgian 1554 - coffee like, dark
Raspberry cider - sweet, fruity

Their lemongrass skewered shrimp is good as well."}
{"text":"This place really impressed me with their service. We got seated during a shift change and somehow we had been forgotten about. I grabbed a waiter to let them know we haven't been see and within 2 minutes a manager came to our table to apologize. After the manager we had 3 more waiters and waitresses stop by to help and to apologize. 

I went during happy hour and some of their appetizers are half off!!! That's amazing!! We ordered a cheese pizza for the kids and I have to admit I stole a piece because it looked so great and it was. I also ordered lumpia, chicken lettuce wraps (which I would definitely order again) and the queso dip. All of the above were great for everyone at the table to share. I was very satisfied with the food and the prices of the happy hour. I will be back to the Yard House.

Bonus they have all Linenkugel seasonal shandys on draft!!!!!"}
{"text":"Yardbird Thieves ! Went to pick up my cup
Because I was told it was there.  When I got there, it wasn't to be found.   Inside thief. May 11 Wednesday I left it. Today is 19 th"}
{"text":"I am not a huge chain person and prefer to shop and eat local. However, I've been curious about YH being the newcomer to Crocker Park. 

A friend and me stopped during our holiday shopping tonight. The wait wasn't bad, about 20 minutes. We were seated in a booth close to the bar, but it seems all tables are close to the bar.

It is very loud so would not recommend if you wanted to have quiet conversation. The beer list is extensive so if you are a beer lover this is the place for you. 

The food is good, but nothing special. I was expecting more after reading reviews. Our server Mikaela, was attentive and offered some great beer options as well as her favorites for food. The brussels sprouts and potatoes she recommended were very tasty and I would order again.  The chicken tortilla soup was good, but a bit spicy, plenty of chicken though.  My friend got the ribs with creamed corn and she said, again, they were nothing special.

I would return if shopping in the area and was hungry and thirsty for a good beer, but not sure I would go out of my way to eat there again. I just am not a fan of that \"chain\" feel."}
{"text":"How many beers on tap? Amen.  Come here to expand your horizons and then hit Lee's for your supply.  Tahi chik wings are $$$  I still havent tried the mac & sleeze to this day, mostly because im afraid of having a heart attack on the spot, but it's definately on my bucket list.  Actually everything on the happy hour menu is pretty darn good.  Poke stack, and thai chik pizza are my fav."}
{"text":"First time here, very nice environment. Our waiter Ricky was very helpful with selecting the vegan appetizers which were the mushroom lettuce wrap, which to me tasted like a lettuce egg-roll and truffle fries, which they were both very tasty. We also ordered 2 vegan burger and some chicken strips substituted with Gardine chicken (Vegan) The chicken strips tasted like actual chicken strips and the burgers was decent tasted like a plain chicken guacamole burger definitely would switch the buns."}
{"text":"Jeriod and Darin rocked the bar Monday night. Was greeted and had a drink in my hand within 60 seconds of walking in.  Had the Enchilada Stack which was great. Wait time on food was on par with any other restaurant with comparable menu.  Thought I might be on the set of \"Cheers\", because both Jeriod and Darin were spot on with everyone's name at the bar. First time at Yard House.  I'll stop in next time I'm in the area. Pricing is around $15-$20 for an entree, around $6-$8 for a pint of beer. The movie theater is next door so you can wait out the booze while catching a flick.  Figured it was $10 for an Uber or $10 for a movie."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the better sports bar I've eaten at. We first came for lunch with about a dozen people and the service was great...we had food and beer coming at us from all angles.

I ordered the Grilled Korean BBQ Beef, which I was impressed to even see on the menu. I thought it was pretty tasty, although I have to admit that I had a more flavorful version elsewhere the following night. To drink I ordered the El Picante, which was absolutely perfect. The giant charred jalapeño on top imparted such a nice smokiness...best drink I've had so far in LV. I also inherited a friend's pineapple cider, which was very good.

Lunch was such a success that we came back for a quick dinner before leaving the hotel for the night. This time I ordered the Carnitas Taco, and it was flawless. The pork was juicy and flavorful, and the pineapple chunks provided some much-appreciated sweetness. 

The only miss of the entire day was the creme brûlée, which was topped with bananas, something I'd never seen. There were a couple of bruleed pieces of banana on the side, which I thought was interesting, but topping the ramekin with more thin banana slices left the custard underneath without its characteristic sugar crust. The custard was also rather bland.

I don't want to end on a bad note though, bc this place really does a lot of things well!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite of the Yard House restaurants and not just because it is on my side of town.  The food always seems to be done just right and my husband and his sister enjoy the beer.  Would have given one more star but my husband has yet to find any food item that makes him want to go here over some other restaurant.  Since I just can't seem to get enough of the grilled cheese and tomato bisque soup it is very disappointing that he doesn't want to go."}
{"text":"We had a company dinner here, and i can't complain!  Nice variety of food for a limited catering menu, and they were even flexible because i didn't like the vegetarian selection they had picked.  Cute little area by the sports arena, I would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"The Yard House is a nice sports bar, but you don't need to be dressed to the nines to eat here. The menu is quite varied, and I've never had anything I didn't like. My favorite is the Penne with Chicken and the Mac 'n' Cheese dish -- both are fabulous. 

Numerous flat-screen TVs abound, inside and out -- sit inside or out on the patio. The bar looks cool, though I haven't sat there. 

If you're shopping at Scottsdale Fashion Square, this is one of the better places to grab a bite."}
{"text":"145 kegs tapped ... What's your next question?

The menu is eclectic and well done too.  Fun in evenings."}
{"text":"I like the food here. They have a great menu. Some of the items aren't so great and they also aren't entirely consistant with preparation. They are very very accomidating though, so if they screw up they will do it over for you or take it off the bill. They also have tons of beers on tap. If you like beer - it's a great place to go. 

They recently removed a bunch of bench seating in favor of tables and chairs... I wasn't a fan of them doing so, but it's no big deal... it just means it's now more likely to see other people there. Before, it was easier to just eat your meal with your friends in isolation - now it's more open and you have to be subjected to the douchebaggery that huddles around the bar.

It has become a bit of a hangout for the snottsdale crowd it seems. No big deal really - if you like that, you can hang out there and be seen. If you're not into it, at least you can check out a few fake boobs while you down a pint of fancy imported beer.

If you like beer, but hate this atmosphere - head south a bit to Papago Brewery. 

Yardhouse gets my approval only because of the food and comfortable booths and great beer selection and accomidating service."}
{"text":"Service good!! Food terrible!! I mean not even worth spending your hard earned money on! Was there for less than an hour, indulged in a drink for $12 with zero booze...pure sugar. Ordered crab, shrimp, artichoke dip... I think? It was a burnt smallest of small portion of what I think was cheese, not sure what it was, wasn't enough to figure it out!! Got snack of deviled eggs, it had this weird cold marinara... why?? All and all spent $70 for gross food, and crappy drinks!"}
{"text":"I've always loved yardhouse, it's by far one of my favorite restaurants! This one doesn't beat the one back home in long beach but it's close enough! I love their happy hour menu and the huge selection of beers! Their chicken lettuce wraps are to die for! Always always Great food, positive atmosphere and amazing service from the host staff to the servers and even their bussers!

However, the only negative thing being a hospitality major and all is I didn't see any management walking around tables talking to guest. It's not a big deal to most people but it can really make a guest's experience go from an 8 to a 10."}
{"text":"We came here for drinks after the Pacquiao fight. We didn't eat anything, but Yardhouse always has a solid selection as far as adult libations are concerned. The servers are cool. Pretty on par with other Yardhouses, although this one seemed to be pretty packed."}
{"text":"West coast chain finally makes it over to Cleveland and it's a winner! It's only the second location in Ohio, the other one being in Cincinnati.  Yard House is run by the same company that owns Longhorn Steakhouse, Red Lobstah, Olive Garden, etc. Yes, it's a national chain, but I'm diggin it!

Yard House has a large menu with a lot of unique offerings. There seems to be a lot of Asian inspired dishes, so Yelpers should enjoy that! ;) Their California Roll and Spicy Tuna Roll aren't what you're used to having at your local sushi joint, rather they come in a neat ring-molded stack of umami deliciousness! The Kung Pao Calamari and wings are excellent. Their sandwiches are loaded with meat and won't leave you hungry. Every appetizer and entree I've had has been loaded with flavor and beautifully plated. I haven't checked out their desserts yet though.

Their beer selection is immense! Along with the common domestics and imports, there's plenty of beers from around the U.S., as well as local brews from GLBC, Platform, Fathead's, etc.

The decor inside and out, is clean and modern, with plenty of seating and TVs all over. Bathrooms are clean and they have a motion sensor to open the door when exiting, a germaphobe's dream! There's a nice patio too, but I haven't sat there yet.

The service at Yard House has been spot on. Servers are attentive and friendly. Lily in particular, was fantastic! I suggest asking to be seated in her section if you can.

Prices are very reasonable and the Happy Hour deals (3-6pm and late night) are some of the best around. Yelper Greg D is a big fan of the late night deals.

If you're out in Crocker Park, check out Yard House.  I think you'll be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Great lunch today so nice that they do lunch specials on the weekend.  Great Variety on the menu.  LOVE the chicken tortilla soup I had today for the first time.  Always have had great fast friendly service"}
{"text":"I always go to this restaurant because my girlfriend works here. The food is fairly good and isn't too expensive. The atmosphere is chill and they play great music all of the time. The service varies depending on who you end up with when you dine. Request Jessica if you're dining on a weekend."}
{"text":"Great place, Lucia was our waitress and she was very attentive, polite and on point with our food.. highly recommend this place..."}
{"text":"Again :) yard house does not disappoint. I missed the happy hour on their half off appetizer but it was still delicious. 50$ for 2 person and we were both pretty stuffed. Service here was very fast and friendly as well. It's in a great location cause we just took the monorail over, plenty of sight seeings to do and still be able to walk around."}
{"text":"Impressive!
I've been to the Pasadena Yard House and aside from the excellent beer selection and crazy wine choices the food was mediocre.  Las Vegas kicked Pasadena's ass.  srsly
A diabetic can find some sweet(heh) friendly menu items.  
I ordered the Roasted Turkey Cobb salad but I was inches from ordering the Tomato Bisque w/Grilled Hearts of Romaine....and I totally should have.  My lovely Mom ordered that instead and I stuck with the crispy bacon, bleu cheese & hard-boiled egg (mmmmmm).  
So I tried my nieces NY steak and it was heavenly. Tried my nephew Trevor's steak dinner and it was equally as delish.  I tried my Mom's Grilled Hearts of Romaine & I am impressed by the champagne vinaigrette .  A biting experience.
All in all an impressive display."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times in Florida and here in Vegas but in a different location. It never gets old! Great food, ok prices (after all, we are on Las Vegas strip), Happy hour specials till 6 pm. Try their California roll! It's very particular, not your usual California you get at your local Japanese sushi place. This time I tried Fried calamari. It was an appetizer, but for me it is a real main dish! They also have a variety of sophisticated cocktails and martinis. My server Angel helped me to choose the most delicious one. The service is fast and everybody is super friendly. Can't wait to come back for their clam chowder."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Atmosphere is rocking, drinks are always cold and the service is excellent !"}
{"text":"So many beers on tap it's a beer lovers paradise.  I don't know what they do to their Magic Hat #9, but it is the best tasting Magic Hat I've ever tried.  Whatever they do, they do it right.  Awesome atmosphere, sophisticated but relaxed. Great for business happy hours, or hanging with friends."}
{"text":"Pretty inviting atmosphere!  Tried one of their Rueben pastrami sandwiches and it was tasty!"}
{"text":"Try the giant California roll it's great! Lots of happy hour specials on the appetizers although I have yet to make it to one."}
{"text":"This place is great for meeting up with friends and catching up with food and cocktails. Happy hour gets a little crazy, so if you come during this time be prepared to wait for a table. The food is solid. Not amazing. Not bad. The service is always consistent, haven't had a bad experience yet. 

I like that the menu has a little of everything, no matter you're mood you'll find something appetizing. Typically I come here with friends and we order a bunch of appetizers and share. I usually get full from just that. 

The onion ring tower is a must, nachos, and spinach dip. There are a variety of beer and cocktail options, there's something for everyone."}
{"text":"Went there Friday night and was very disappointed.  I ordered the Ahi Tuna and what they gave me was shameful.  They soaked the tuna in Soy Sauce and that's all I could taste, the meat was stringy and difficult to eat.  The server didn't know the menu very well and was hesitant to provide me with low carb side dish alternatives.  This was my second and final visit as both visits were disappointing."}
{"text":"We tried this location.   We used to love the yardhouse but lately something is off.    My onion rings were cold and my wifes bbq chicken salad was dry.     The 5-15 min wait was closer to 35.    All in all it was not the best but it is still a great place to go.    The menu has a huge variety and the portions are healthy.    Our waitress was a lady named Dallas.   Drink service took a while but honestly, she hustled to get to everyone and worked extremely hard."}
{"text":"You really can't go wrong with this place since their menu is so extensive.  My favorite are the steak sandwich and the angel hair pasta with shrimp in vodka sauce.  The food is plentiful and reasonably priced.  They are also open late.  I hear the beer is great, too, but I'm not a beer drinker."}
{"text":"I really like this place. It has the feel of fine dinning and great atmosphere and the prices are pretty good. Love the Nacho's. Great Happy Hour specials too. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Decided to eat here for dinner with my friends and family. We all really enjoyed the food. I got the BBQ bacon burger and really liked it. My step dad tried some of the beers and said they were great. All of the food got ate, except for part of my mom's club due to the fact that it was huge. The server was great and was knowledgeable of the beers and such. When I asked everyone what they would rate the yard house,  they all said five stars. If you are looking to eat then consider going here."}
{"text":"This particular Yard House is just as good as any other Yard House you would find in the line of chains, with the typical good food, service and drinks, with one added bonus... location, location, location. 

Located in the Linq area with a great view of the High Roller and a beautiful double-decker outdoor patio area, this is a must do happy hour (once they include a happy hour) and meal spot while you're in the area."}
{"text":"I love me some Yard House. 

They have great food and lots of variety, which I'm a fan of. Add alcohol and a great atmosphere and it's perfect for groups or even a date night. The outdoor area is my favorite. It's not as loud out there and there are heaters if it's too cold.

When I'm in Town Square it's one of my favorite spots to frequent. I'm a big fan of the Wyders Raspberry Cider they have on tap. I almost always get that lately. So many beers are available too. 

Definitely a good deal for the location."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and attentive waitresses. My mom ordered the hit pastrami sandwich and loved the tenderness of the meat. 

I ordered their chicken pasta with sundried tomatoes and slices of fresh asparagus...it was served perfectly with a smooth, tasty white sauce. I loved it! I would definitely recommend dining at this restaurant and give them business.

Their clam chowder was also a delight to compliment my pasta dish."}
{"text":"We are obsessed with this place and have come here for every major milestone this year: valentines, meeting family, getting engaged and getting married! Consistently good food and drinks, lively atmosphere we love this place. I always get the lamb burger it's so delish. My husband loves the truffle fries"}
{"text":"Their menu is HUGEEEEEE.  You can go here every week and get something different.  Fun atmosphere.  You can do sports fans, business, families... it all seems to work.  Great service too.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"A solid location for this chain.  Great food, great wait staff, and great atmosphere.  I sat outside and you have the baseball game on TV looking one way, and the beautiful Town Square center looking the other.  A great place to enjoy yourself and relax, especially with nice weather.  The Town Square location is exceptional and reminds you more of Scottsdale than the normal barren wasteland of Vegas.  This just adds some freshness to this Yard House location.

Update: I've been back since and the service was still great.  Got to watch Kobe's final game and the place was locked in on the TVs.  Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Amazing service at this location, which really goes a long way.  The food was really delicious as well and the portion was huge.  I brought it home and it was great as a leftover too.  Despite being super packed and busy, the wait staff is always on top of their game.  Very impressed."}
{"text":"I went to this location with a group of friends last night and once again, it was a great experience.  The food was delicious, the wait staff was friendly and funny, and even the valet outside of the restaurant was super speedy and helpful.  I usually don't go to this location but I would definitely head back.  The atmosphere was great and yet we had no problem hearing each other in conversation.

I went again for a business lunch and it was great again.  Good for both business and groups of friends.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"This was the place my friends and I would go every time we went to a movie. The service is good, friendly. The food is amazing. I usually got the french dip and loveddddd it. Good portions, good food, good vibe. Decent prices."}
{"text":"Love the \"Jambalaya\" in this place! Usually come in here for dinner before catching a movie. However, just hanging out to have a drink works too when you're avoiding the loud bar or club."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Super friendly and knowledgeable staff. Huge selection of craft beers, reasonable pricing for a steak house. I had the jambalaya with shrimp, crawfish, sausage with spicy rice. It was amazing! My girlfriend had the Pork tacos which were also very tasty. Thanks for the good food and friendly service yard house, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I would normally give this place 5 stars but tonight our service really sucked.  It is a Friday night and busy as expected but we found a couple spots at the bar. Usually the bartenders are on point and more than willing to serve, but not tonight.

When we sat down the bartender asked if I wanted a drink (as she should), but when I said I needed a second she had a little attitude. I was also waiting for my wife to join me and she returned a few times with no drink order yet. After that it seemed like she wanted nothing to do with us.  

We ordered some fried cheese curds (which were delicious), but took nearly 40 minutes to arrive. When it came time to order food I made it blantely obvious we needed something and no one came to help. Finally tracked down a bartender who said \"I thought you ordered already\".  Our 2 salads took another 30 minutes to get. 

May have to rethink when I want yard house again which is sad because I generally love this place."}
{"text":"The food was just ok.  They have a chicken pot pie that had zero gravy and was so dry it was inedible.  The Jambalaya was good, not great.      

Beer selection was as advertised, with several local brews that were very good.

Our waitress was terrific.  Despite being very busy, we had everything we needed.  

They are right in the middle of the plaza and offered outdoor seating.  Definitely made this more than it was."}
{"text":"This is a pretty cool place, especially if you are a beer drinker, which I am not.  If we are at Westgate for some unknown reason, we will usually choose this place over the other offerings in the plaza.  The Happy Hour here is usually pretty decent, with a fairly large offering of appetizers for cheap and cheap martinis as well.  Always a good thing.

I've had a couple different things from the menu here and I have always been happy with my selections.  I have had the Beef Dip sandwich and it is quite tasty.  However, if you are looking for really thinly sliced beef, do not get this sandwich because they slice it rather thick.  I have also ordered their Mac and Cheese here and it was delicious.  A good standby.  

If you are looking for gourmet food, don't come here because that's not what you will get.  If you are looking for traditional but yummy food then this is a good place to try.  Overall, a great place to eat, talk, and drink.  Doesn't get better than that."}
{"text":"If you are into good beer, this is a great place.  We went for happy hour and got their biggest size (an embarrassingly large glass) for a great deal - and the beer was delicious.  The menu was extensive.

If you are into great food, this is not a great place.  We ordered 4 or so appetizers and nothing was special.  It almost felt like we were eating at an applebees.  

I'd be most likely to check out another place in the mall before going to Yard house again for dinner, but now I know where to go for a truly refreshing fancy beer."}
{"text":"We had Ernie as our server tonight after the Cardinals game and he is FABULOUS!! He is my absolute favorite server here! (I've always had great service at this location.) Ernie is so personable, friendly and is on top of his game! We'll definitely be back and hopefully we'll be sat in his section!"}
{"text":"Best customer service ever.

Our food wasn't what we expected so we sent it back and the manager was nice enough to let us order an appetizer.  They comped our food and we just had t pay for the 2 drinks we ordered.

By the way, the new order they brought out to us was perfect! 

The server was such a sweetheart.

I'll be back :)"}
{"text":"This is your typical \"fancier\" chain restaurant. It is in a very popular location and is usually fairly busy. They have a huge selection of draft beers and the food is always good. 

Our favorite time to go is for happy hour and sit at the bar. Although that is always a busy time and finding a seat can be challenging. If you are not going during happy hour, I'd say you are going to pay about $15 per meal on average. 

I have had inconsistent service here. Sometimes it's great, and at others, it lacks, but it always a good stop if you are in the Westgate area."}
{"text":"I don't five star a lot of things but this place is great. I've been on more than one occasion and never a dissapointment. The drinks are great and the food...omg. 

Just go check it out, enjoy the rest of the promenade on the way. And if you chose to do the observation wheel -  ride in the open bar one, you'll thank me later.

Order the poke nachos and a mojito from Stephanie, she was fun and attentive!"}
{"text":"In a gorgeous new part of Vegas! Lots of standard beers, a few unknowns but not too many. Service was great. The outside patio was beautiful and very clean. The food was pretty tasty and the beer was also very good. I had a chocolate shake porter on nitro and it was out of this world. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"This is my FAVORITE place in vegas.  Im a visitor from NY and I asked one of my co-workers where their favorite spot in vegas is.  They told me here.  That person did not realize the impact on my life that he made when he said the words \"Yard House\".

This place is located in Town square which is a huge maze.  I have no idea how to navigate around this area, so be prepared for that.  Anyways, we walked in to a lively wonderful atmosphere of people enjoying themselves and just a fun vibe.

We were seated and were amazed by the beer selection.  This place is like an ale house where they must have like 100 beers on tap.  It was awesome.  The first time we came here we sat in a booth with a really nice waitress.  She was quick, interactive, and knowledgable.  I started off with a beer. The first beer I got was 9 dollars and the second beer i got was 6, so I assume that the prices of the beer vary.

We tried the asian thai pizza  - which was amazing.  I think asian thai salads and all of those asian dishes taste the same.  The pizza was amazing and extremely flavorful.  It was like 16 dollars or something.

Then we ordered the Bisque and grilled cheese. It was ok.  Average.  Not the best gr cheese and not the best bisque. 12 bucks or so. (The menu w pricing is easily accessible online)

I ordered the Turkey club which was moist juicy and saucy, which i love.  Bottom line - food is amazing here.  

One final thing of note - My girlfriend is a vegetarian and they have a GARDEIN menu.  This has changed my life forever.  It is a soy protein that tastes JUST LIKE CHICKEN.  I now know gardein exists and its amazing.  Thank you Yard House

There are tvs all over the bar and are clear as day.  Great place to watch games and anything.  It was awesome."}

{"text":"Since we usually visit the location in the LBC we went here expecting good food, and that's exactally what we got! They actually exceeded my expectations. I had the best steak sandwich I've ever had in my life!  It was a little more cooked than I had asked for ( I ordered med-rare and I got medium toward the well side), but nevertheless delicious!  And the steak was so succulent and tender I really can't complain. My hubby had the seared ahi sandwich, which was mouth watering delicious. 

The service was good even if the waitress was a little bit too fake, but everyone in Vegas is working on tips so I can't blame her. She did let my beer go empty one time though!  Shame on her.

Unlike the location in Long Beach this one seems to be very family oriented, there were tons of people here eating with their children.  Hardly anyone at the bar, go figure.

We'll definately come back next time we're in town."}
{"text":"Location: its located in the Scottsdale fashion mall. The restaurant is dark in the inside, clean and spacious. It has a huge bar as well as dining area with lots of tables and booths to choose from. Overall, it was a great atmosphere especially if you are looking for a place to take out for a date. 

Service: hostess and waiter are friendly and courteous. However, I did feel bothered by the constant interruption of my conversation with my friend. I feel like they were trying to rush us out the door. Ok - u r done with the food now. Do u want dessert? If not, here is the bill. Goodbye. Wow! I didn't feel like I could spend more time hanging out a bit after I am done eating. 

Food: I ordered the Rib eye and it was just ok. There isn't much of the flavor to it but it was cooked exactly to my liking (medium rare). We ordered the crab cake for appetizer. That was very juicy and delicious. The enchiladas dish that my friend ordered was a bit greasy but tasty. 

Rating: I'll come back to try something else - maybe"}
{"text":"Great selection of beers, nice ambiance, but a little cold inside and the bar seats are really uncomfortable. Also the food is not that great, mostly average. This place would be perfect if the food was a little closer to phenomenal and the bar seating actually comfortable. Too bad because the beer selection is awesome. 

Will return, but still searching for that one menu item that will leave me craving a return trip. Also, this place gets busy, especially around holidays or weekends. I recommend calling ahead to ask for the wait time and putting your party on the list before you arrive."}
{"text":"Awesomeness!!! My husband and I loved our dinners. Tim had the Lobster Garlic Pasta and I enjoyed the Mediterranean Salmon. We are looking forward to eating here again. Dariah was our server and she was first rate!"}
{"text":"Went During happy hour we pretty much sent everything we ordered back-to the kitchen 
Crab cakes were terrible no fault there though Im very picky with crab cakes
Queso was cold
Chicken nachos were extremely dry
Wings were edible but not the best 
Scared to order anything else really sad
I hear a lot of good things about this restaurant maybe it was the location but ......
Won't be back !
Drinks are good though"}
{"text":"Bbq bacon cheeseburger, ordered medium , brought it well done three times.  Need a new cook before I go back."}
{"text":"We party of three.  I ordered the club salad with blue cheese dressing.  This salad had grilled chicken on top. Salad was really good.  Dressing was pretty good.  I would order this again.  Servers were kind of slow. Wanted to order more before happy hour ended but served never came back."}
{"text":"Overall, there were good food and not as good food so in the end it was a 3.  Specifically, the ratings were:  Korean beef 4, seared ahi 4, deviled egg 3, pork street taco 2, chicken penne 2, pastrami sandwich 2, French onion soup 3."}
{"text":"I have been to three Yard House locations: this Camelback location in Scottsdale, AZ, one in Phoenix at Desert Ridge, and in downtown Denver. I am always impressed with the consistency in great food and helpful staff. There is an overwhelming  variety of beers and cocktail selections at each location.  I always eat at the bar and advise others to do the same unless you are with a large group or you don't imbibe. Their bartenders are eager to serve and help you order just the right food and new beer to try. I have found some new crafts I really like this way. A great example of their bar staff is a guy named Sal, who was a humorous and enjoyable lad behind the bar today at the Camelback location at Fashion Square where my daughter and I stopped in for a light lunch and a beer. Sal gives great food service, and pours a decent beer with a lot of pizazz and remembered to bring the extra lemons with my clam chowder."}
{"text":"I always come here for the happy hour. And always order the fire cracker wings and tower of onion rings its soooo good.. Awesome wait staff"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good food and service. Add the vast array of home brews they have and you've got a winner."}
{"text":"Like a ga-zillion beers on tap, but it's the Yard House...you should know what a yard house is by now. I have been here a handful of times. Service is good, well, good for I'm still in college and waiting to get off of this shift so I can get stoned service. The food is good, some of your typical but better than average bar food. The poke stack is yummy, and the french dip is tasty.
A happy hour menu and TV's for sports...I'm still waiting to try the chocolate stout ice cream float."}
{"text":"Yard House usually delivers consistent service and food. This time around, I'm not sure where their consistency went.... perhaps it was because it was incredibly busy but our server forgot about our table and food took 25+ minutes to arrive. Oh, and I forgot to mention that it was appetizers as well. 

The restaurant itself is very nice, simple decor. There are plenty of screens and even an outside patio. 

The appetizers were good, great value especially if you visit during happy hour."}
{"text":"Love their 3:00-6:00 weekday Happy Hour specials on both food and alcohol.  YUM!!Nice variety and good size portions too.  My only complaint is their music is too loud!!!   I thought it might just be me, but then I overheard the customers next to us asking the server if he could possibly turn down the volume.  He said he could not. Thus, only a 4 star rating. :-("}
{"text":"Like any other yard house, there's nothing special about this place. Only reason it gets a 3 star, my waitress screwed up on all of our drinks. SAD!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the Yard House. As far as chains go, this one is definitely far better than most. This one is right near the High Roller. The service was very friendly. There are a ton of tables, a huge bar area, and a fantastic craft beer menu. If you are a craft beer fan, you won't beat the selection here anywhere else in Vegas. They also have a great bar food menu with a variety of options. I will say that I felt that the food at the Miami and Chicago locations was a bit better than here. Perhaps a quality control issue but I was less impressed with the food here. Steak sandwich and fries were very greasy and the nachos were just ok. Certainly better food in Vegas BUT if it's beer and sports viewing you are after, this is your place."}
{"text":"I've heard and read great reviews about the Yard House, so the stop my group made a couple weeks ago was a bit disheartening -- but I will try it again so that I can update my review; but as for now?  Well, no hockey this night (1/25) so the place wasn't wall-to-wall crowded which was nice so we could enjoy dinner as well as drinks.  Our waiter seemed distracted and didn't bother to write down our orders, thus missing one of the appetizers our group ordered... and when we asked for it, blamed us as if we had not ordered it - sorry, don't think all four of us were wrong.  Not attentive service at all, and that is surprising considering I am aware that this place can be 'crazy-busy'.... food was a bit above average but nothing to 'write home about'.... Hey Yard House, maybe I'll give ya a try the next Coyotes game I get a chance to go to - it may have been an 'off' night for you!"}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour for one of my friend's birthday. We were such a big party and I really like how all the servers were very attentive because we had so many requests. Of course we all got something to drink to celebrate our friends birthday and I chose to get a Moscow mule. It was strong to say the least and I enjoyed it. We did get chicken nachos which were not my favorite and the tables either since that was the very last thing to be finished. Our absolute favorite were the poke nachos! We enjoyed it so much we had to order a second one after we finished the first. Overall, I had a good experience with such a big group and I comment the server for remembering all of the things that were being shouted to him from across the table."}
