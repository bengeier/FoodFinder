{"text":"Great Hotdogs! Went there with my girlfriend cause we live nearby, will definitely be going again soon"}
{"text":"I've been back twice since I found this place last week, and I'm planning to go back for lunch again tomorrow. The bacon one was easily the best hot dog I've ever had! The owner is a super nice guy- greets everyone personally when they come in, and when they leave. Definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"Looks like they have way more than just dogs! Nathan's hot dogs, Burgers, ribs, fish and chips and chili cheese fries. Also serves beer!"}
