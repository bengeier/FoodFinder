{"text":"Having had Chinese food in India while growing up, we went with a lot of anticipation. Amongst the ten of us, we ordered some twelve dishes, including hakka chicken and shrimp, chicken 65, chili garlic noodles with chicken, garlic pepper chicken and shrimp chop suey.  The Chicken 65 was very good, with slightly tangy pieces of boneless chicken that had a crunch on first bite, garnished with red and green bell peppers. The chili garlic noodles were tasty, but we initially thought there was a mistake with our order since we could not see any chicken in it.  On close inspection, we noticed a few miniscule pieces of chicken... The shrimp chop suey was about average, although the few shrimp were rather small. The garlic pepper chicken was neither garlicky nor peppery, instead swimming in a pool of watery gravy. But the biggest disappointment was the hakka dishes, which are a signature Indo-Chinese noodle dish.  These were completely bland, and we had to resort to adding more than a few dollops of the 6 sauces at the table to pretend we were having Indo-Chinese cuisine.  We wished the portions were more generous, like we get at most Chinese restaurants. We had to order a couple of extra entrees since some of us were still hungry, whereas we almost never can finish our food at other restaurants.  The service was competent bordering on perfunctory. One of us was curious about Nasi Goreng on the menu, but our server could not describe how it was prepared, instead steering us to a couple of other choices on the menu.  Our receipt invited us to share our experience at a \"Talk2us\" link, which only produced a \"survey error.\"  Having had great Indo-Chinese food in Calcutta, Vancouver and Houston, we are still waiting for a comparable experience in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Food was great, service requires a lot of work. Next time will just do takeout.  Chinese behl is a must!"}
{"text":"This was my first taste of Indo-Chinese food after coming to the United states, so there may be a possibility that my opinion is slightly biased. Firstly, the ambiance is definitely worth mentioning. I wasn't dining in and so cannot comment on the service, but the lady who took my order was very courteous and welcoming. They even accepted my yelp coupon and gave me a 10% discount. The food (dinner order of a starter, rice and curry) was sufficient for 2 people easily. The starter (chicken 65) was excellent. The rice too was pretty spicy and good. The chicken curry (I guess it was chilly chicken) could have been better. The pricing was definitely not cheap, but again wasn't too expensive either. So, considering I have this place less than a mile away from home, I don't think I have any complaints."}
{"text":"We will never return. We called in a pickup order on Monday night. They quoted us 15 minutes and we got to the restaurant around 20 min later. Upon arrival the waitress looked up our order then called over the manager, they whispered to each other then disappeared for about five more minutes. When the manager came back to the front we asked where our food was and he said he thought they had told us, but they had given our order to someone else but not to worry because the called the previous customer and asked him to drive back to the restaurant to return our order. As a customer I would not welcome a call like this and drive back because they made a mistake, they should have simply remade the order. Another 10 minutes goes by and the other customer returns with our food. The manager tells us that the food will be on the house and they will also throw in a soup as well. Through all the wait and lack of communication we would have chalked it up to a bad experience and possibly try it again, but upon arriving home they had given us the completely wrong order anyways. Instead of chicken entrees we had dumplings with \"kung pao chicken\" written on the box. Worst experience we have had at a Chinese restaurant and the food was not even very good."}
{"text":"First time here. Just stumbled on it. Walked in and liked the atmosphere and the friendly hostess/server who greater us. The menu was pleasing and well laid out.  That's where the liking ended.  -understaffed: lots of empty tables and patrons waiting when they should have been seated.  -soup was cold and gelatinous (pretty sure it wasn't supposed to be that way;-)  -entrees less than mediocre. I got the \"Crispy spicy eggplant with honey\" -It wasn't crispy. Quite soggy actually.  -There was no honey but it was extremely sweet with a thick, artificially colored \"sauce\" that was thickened with something that was far from a natural ingredient. -there was at least twice as much breading than eggplant. Couldn't finish it despite being very hungry. I ate the rice....  Short take: They have the foundation for a great place and are clearly cutting corners.  Or had a very bad kitchen staff that night.  Too bad...."}
{"text":"We went there for lunch on our visit to Phoenix. We were a family of five with two kids 5 and 7. We ordered food and it took hours to come. The service was incredibly slow and the restroom was dirty. They should spend more money on their service and restroom instead of fake ambience. They charged a gratutity of six people even when we were five. Beware of what they charge you, we had too pay way above what the food calls for."}
{"text":"Inchin's is my go-to place for a few specific dishes on their menu. If you like spicy mustard, definitely try the Spicy Mustard Paneer appetizer, it is a very innovative paneer appetizer, the presentation and the taste are super yummy! Lat Mai Paneer is another great appetizer option.  Try Chili Garlic Noodles - Another favorite.  Desserts - Give them a miss, not impressive.  Ambience is fun, low-key."}
{"text":"Went for a team lunch. The waitress was kind of rude... and they no longer provide any sauces which is a definite bummer. There is NO point in visiting this place again ever."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a fantastic place for someone looking for Chinese food that we get in India. An apt fusion of Asian n Indian food. Chilli Paneer and chili chicken are fantastic here. It's a decent ambience as well with overall food quality being quite good. The staff is quite attentive but could still improve. The only drawback is the long wait times if you don't start early dinner."}
{"text":"We have not gone there for last 6 months and lot seems to have changed. We used to go here very often for last 3 years but today they were overwhelmed with guests full of restaurant and seems short staffed so quality of food and accuracy of food order got compromised. Previous manager Jay is also not there. I thought maybe this is a one time bad experience, but now couple of months later visited again  and it was not busy, later at night but food taste is still questionable especially Hot N Sour soup was watery, Hakka noodles were like a thick blob, Gobhi Manchurian was all watery, Devils Choice Vegetables was little better, too much vinegar in Chinese Behl, chili fried paneer and burnt garlic rice were good. We used to enjoy their tray of 6 different kind of Sauces but now they only have 2 diff kinds and that too they don't bring it to your table unless you ask for it. Also they brought out one item at a time to the table, even the plain rice came separate from the curries. The guest WiFi was again not working - I am sure they don't want to offer it but too shy to admit it. Female Mgr was trying to train a newer employee but had a horrible attitude. Kanabar Bhai - please do something. We do not have many Indian Chinese Choices in town."}
{"text":"Pretty awful asian - con - fusion food. Had the peking lamb and it was a huge plate of shredded lamb of of a quality below what is put in kebabs.  Loads of salt and nasty sauce with overcooked rice on the sides. You get a collection of bottled sauces with your meal and they are all manky, even the soy sauce was somehow nasty. Would not have eaten a bit if I wasn't extremely hungry at the time. Had dumpling starter that not terrible and service was not memotably bad."}
{"text":"Whenever we think to dine outside then only we thought for Inchin bamboo garden.  We love all dishes here. It is really wonderful all the time. The service , food n sauses are awesome..specially the sweet chillysause."}
{"text":"I had very bad experience with this place .... We went on Friday eve, it was not that crowded then also staff were behaving like they are extremely busy person and no one even showed up to take orders  We waited for 45-50 mins, after requesting several times a guy came and took Oder   We ordered for soup and one non veg starter, it was so spicy and full of green chili, when we complained about bunch of chilies in soup, attendant was shamelessly laughing , it was like he does not care ...."}
{"text":"So here's the deal with Inchin Bamboo Garden - the service on weekends is meh, partly because of the Indian mentality of not turning a guest (in this case a customer) away. American restaurants are very upfront about waiting time and solid about reservations, but Inchin on weekends? Not so much. I'm not sure if it is because they are brand new and trying to build a customer base or if it's a management problem. Either way, they should fix it soon because THEIR FOOD!  OMG! I think the Indo-Chinese food at Inchin might even be better than some that I have had in India. It was so good that we didn't even mind the can-be-better service. It was worth every minute of our wait. We got Veg Manchurian, Chili Chicken, Hakka Noodles and Burnt Garlic Fried Rice, and LOVED IT! In fact, we went this past Friday and I'm already craving their food. We might go back this weekend.  The place is worth checking out. If you are not up for a wait on a weekend, go on a weekday, but do go. Also, do let them know about the spice levels, just in case. Our food was spicy but we were okay with that."}
{"text":"I would like to thank the manager Dominica and her staff for all the arrangements made for us to host Diwali party at the restaurant. My family and friends appreciated all your hard work and consideration. We had an amazing evening. Thank you so much for taking such wonderful care of us during our visit. You and your staff were so very accommodating and informed. The  food was exceptional, we enjoyed every meal. It was fresh, properly prepared and a great value for the price.  Once again THANK YOU SO MUCH for everything! We had a wonderful time and you and your staff helped to make it that way! we'll definitely be back!  Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Just coming out after waiting for 15 minutes and no one showing up to seat me. Is there a negative star which I can give them??? Under staffed they seem to be. Have experienced very slow service earlier. Just came coz the food is good. But I guess this is the limit !!!"}
{"text":"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that any foodie from India must be in want of good Indo chinese food. And Oh I have waited for that in Phoenix for the last 6 years I have been here. I have finally been rewarded.  We had a good dining experience last Friday when we went for dinner. The sweet corn chicken soup, drums of heaven and salt and pepper shrimp were all quite comparable to what you get back home.  For entrees, we had the chicken manchurian, chilli chicken and chilli shrimp. Unfortunately, all of the gravy, while tasty, tasted alike. Would have probably given a 3.5 star due to this but am feeling generous. The burnt garlic fried rice and hakka noodles was very good. They also have their sauces on the table so you can customize as you want. Serving size is decent.  Service and decor is very nice.  TIP!!!  Please make reservations prior to going here, they either overbook on the reservations or are really busy. We walked in without a reservation and had to wait almost 40 minutes to be seated.  Will return whenever the craving hits again."}
{"text":"Great food if you like indo-chinese.. The timings on yelp are wrong though.. It closes after 2.30pm on sundays and opens again at 5.30pm"}
{"text":"Indians would love it! This one definitely owes a review, knowing how rare it is to find a good indo chinese place in US. And this has all the ingredients: food quality, taste and ambience. Though service could be further improved on, i am still rating it high because of the food taste. I went there once for dinner and was glad to see the mouth watering menu and topping over the cake was that it almost tasted like a good chinese restaurant in India, what else can one hope for! I just loved their spring rolls and chilli chicken. They could further work on their soups though as the hot n sour i ordered had a strong flavor of something that dominated my entire experience which was not that good. Overall, a great place for indo chinese cuisine, if thats what u r looking for. Would definitely want to go again."}
{"text":"Great Chinese food in Indian style. I and my friends were dying to eat indo Chinese food from a long time and we are glad to find this place. Chicken schezwan and American chopseuy were amazing. Would recommend to all Indians."}
{"text":"I had Pad Thai delivered from the UberEATS app.  It had almost no sauce on the noodles hence almost no flavor as well as being very dry.  I ordered the chicken but asked that tofu be substituted.  The chicken came, dry and almost inedible.  My husband had the shrimp and it was overcooked.  We will NEVER order from them again or go there.  Just plain bad food."}
{"text":"The staff gives wrong information that they don't put garlic in their dishes while the food was laden with it. Someone with food allergies should avoid this restaurant as they provide misleading information. Good ambience but Too much grease in the food.   Upon reading the review, The management was kind enough to enquire about what happened and accepted their mistake. They sent a gift card to be redeemed at next visit. Would give them another chance for sure."}
{"text":"One of the worst restaurant experiences ever!! I mean they are sorting out napkins and spoons while we are waiting at the table. And for the money they charge, the food is really bad.   Very inhospitable!! Worst food!! And very rude!!  Don't ever go here."}
{"text":"Wow where do i start, the only good thing about this place is the decor, very nice setup and outdoor seating, if only the food didnt make me sick and send me to the emergency!!! Horrible customer service. Seems like everyone here hates there job. I did get my food on a timely matter however, not the best tasting at all. A big problem i had ( heard this from an employee ) was the fact that tips weren't given to the emplyees... NOT ALLOWED TIPS?? Should let customers know this so we dont tip. Where r those tips going????     To all those who plan on eating here, beware... got really sick."}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night and the place did not disappoint! We were a big party, but were lucky enough to get one of those big booth tables, and got some privacy from the rest of the hall.   The food was delicious and the best Indian Chinese I've had in the US. My personal favorites are the Chili Chicken, Chili Potatoes, and the Basil Chicken Rice!! So good!  Our Server was pretty good too! Yes, it takes a while for the food to get served, but hey have you seen how busy they are on weekend nights!? We waited for a bit, but the food was definitely worth the wait! Oh btw, while you wait, you can always read up on Chinese signs and pick on people at your table ;) haha!  Definitely Recommended!"}
{"text":"Tried the American Chopsuey, tad too much sweet sauce for my taste. The fried rice was spiced right"}
{"text":"Great food!! Service could be more proactive.   We got the 'Drums of Heaven' to start with. They were very well seasoned and full of flavor. For our main course we had Chicken Manchurian which was decent but the Cauliflower Manchurian was definately a better dish. Hakka Noodles, american chopsuey were decent as well. Overall it was a good experience and I will be dining there again.  Also, it would be nice to have some outdoor seating"}
{"text":"Tasty food and great service. All dishes were delicious. Our favourite dish is chicken 65. Bit costly. Can go occasionally and enjoy the food!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a goto place for an indo chinese food, i just found this place this month, have already been there a couple of times. Everything we ordered was at its best taste. We didnt feel that food is not upto mark. it might be good if they also add Buffet for lunch."}
{"text":"Updating from my previous review.. Have been here couple more times and the service has been great! The taste of food is excellent and the service provided has improved leaps and bounds. Great improvement all together."}
{"text":"not the kind of chinese you will expect in india....someone needs to teach them on manchurian recipe... :( ..paneer chilli seemt o be something whats not actual recipe looks like  ...soup were gud...3 star for being only Indo chinese place in phoenix..when u r just tired of cooking chinese at home :P..nothing exceptional in recipes..to come back to place"}
{"text":"I had a pretty bad experience here recently. This has been one of my favorite Chinese place till recently, but looks like the popularity and patronage from Asian clientele has gone to their head. Went there on a Sat afternoon, thinking that there would be less of a crowd to sit through,and was surprised at the level of mismanagement this place has. To start off, while the place was mostly unoccupied, i did book a table in advance just to be sure. As soon as i entered, i could figure out the place was not completely ready though it was already 130pm, a good couple of hrs from their opening time. Booking didnt seem to make any difference as the restaurant crew were not interested to know if i had one! The Air conditioning sucked like anything. With peak summer temp of 115F outside, the least you expect from an eating place is a breath of cool air. But probably the Bamboo garden folks were trying to save some $$ on their power bill. The food preparation tasted Ok but the presentation was bad. And for some reason, the staff seemed to be in a hurry to wrap up the table and make us move out. Dishes were being removed while some of us were still eating, tables were moved while we were still sitting. It felt as if the management would be happier if people paid upfront, boxed all stuff and went off quickly. To top it off, my bill included a 18% gratuity for a party of 6...which included 2 kids...1 being infant!!..Ridiculous!. This place is definitely avoidable now and out of my list of favorite places for food."}
{"text":"Today my husband and I came back to give Inchin bamboo garden a second chance. We were not impressed the first time we came here but today in a hurry we took a wrong decision.  The food was cold and barely had any flavor despite the menu describing the items as spicy. The appetizer was very expensive: it consisted of sautéed onions and hard dumplings. We were too hungry to complain after a long day of work. First time we came we experienced the same thing but we thought of giving them another chance. Clearly it was the worst choice for a Friday evening.  The table next to us complained about the food being cold as well, at least they had the patience to send the food back (the server gave them the worst look). NEVER coming back here again.  The only good thing about the meal was refresh wet towelette and the green sauce in the pic below."}
{"text":"(This restaurant has multiple locations throughout the U.S. This review is specifically for the Inchin's location in Scottsdale, AZ).  We had party of 12 people that went to this restaurant, The taste of the food was so spicy that my son started throwing up.   One dish was super bland and the other dish curry based (Chilli panner masala) served in a plate really hard to even pick up without spilling everything around.  And the chilli was so high even back in India they dont put so much spices like this.   I really wanted to try this place. Overall had a bad experience."}
{"text":"We had food here served years ago and the food was really good then . Not sure if the management changed but they are rude, when they mess up an order they argued and we had to talk to the guy for 20 mins to convince him he messed up . Coming to the food , very very average , we asked for spicy and nothing was spicy. The food seemed like it was made a while ago , tasted quite awful. Overall a bad experience with both the management and the food . Would not recommend this place anymore ."}
{"text":"The food was great! Esp...the ku chow chicken recommended by our server Julie, who by the way is great!! Awesome customer service and delicious food recommendation! We'll definitely be back again soon and we would recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"The waiting was 1 hour. So the food might be good. There was no one to guide or help us with adding our name to the waiting list. And pretty rude behavior of the staff when we asked them about the time it would take in the waiting."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch few days ago, very disappointed with the food.   There was very little chicken in the spicy chicken noodles. When I asked the waitress she didn't bother asking the chef or taking it back to the kitchen. 8$ for very little chicken .   My friends also got shrimp noodles, that wasn't cooked properly . And the dumplings were not properly cooked either."}
{"text":"Wish I could give a negative review. Worst service, no respect to customer's time. An year ago we waited for 2 hours for a dine in. After a year, thought things would have changed n ordered a to-go. I was told to collect in 30 min. Order wasn't ready even when I arrived  45 min later. Had to wait an extra 1 hour with constant excuses. Eventually had to cancel my oder n order. Should not operate a place if you cannot provide even average service."}
{"text":"Apart from the extremely \"garlicky\" and \"ketchupy\" appetizers (Szechuan wantons and Chicken 65), the entrees I tried (cauliflower manchurian and chili chicken) were good."}
{"text":"Had really high hopes - it's really close to home and menu sounds delicious.  Unfortunately the food was almost inedible."}
{"text":"I went to the location in Round Rock, TX for many years and loved it. Would have given it 5 stars without hesitation (check my old reviews on the tripadvisor site). Last week I tried the Scottsdale location and was very disappointed. The pot stickers were nothing like the same menu item in Round Rock, these were rock hard dumplings that seemed to have been frozen and heated up. The drums of heaven were just pieces of fried chicken, not the stir-fry sauteed item I was used to from the other location. The two entrees were better but still seemed sort of overcooked and without texture. I was really disappointed after probably 20 visits to the Texas location I assumed this Arizona location would be the same."}
{"text":"Tried chicken 65 and momos which were great. In main course we had chili chicken(okay), schezwan lamb curry(bad) and shrimp Manchurian(okay). In general the main course was not that great so ordered chocolate sauce cake to forget the taste of the lamb curry."}
{"text":"Amazing place.... the first place i liked that actually serves indochinese food... Their schezwan chicken and burnt garlic fried rice are remarkable.. Also, they are quick with service and quantity of food is worth what you pay for... All in all great place!"}
{"text":"I really liked that they have a separate gluten free menu. The manager also had them prepare GF dish that was not on the menu. Received excellent service and food suggestions from the manager. The pan fried chilli fish was delicious! Best indo Chinese cuisine in phx area!"}
{"text":"Had to give 1 star as no negative stars allowed i am here waiting for the food for 1 hr and no avail the servers are rude as if we are asking for free food...  I think they should go out of business now if they can handle the guests like guests and treat them like homeless people asking for free food"}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time coming to this hidden gem in the last couple months, and it's quickly becoming a regular for me. Everything I've ordered has been delicious. I highly recommend ordering the cauliflower manchurian, the fried baby corn appetizer, and the lat mai paneer appetizer."}
{"text":"Great place only if you are craving the indo Chinese food. Food is good. We ordered a tomato ginger soup- great taste but you get a small cup for the price you pay.  fried cauliflower- well balanced and yummy devils choice vegetarian sauce - this came with a side of rice but too many chestnuts in the sauce.  Pan fried potstickers- again expensive($10 I think)  for 6 small rounds with no dipping sauce! They expect us to eat the sauces from the bottles on the tables!  Hakka noodles were good! Nothing spl about it.  Since we came half an hour before the closing time.. everything was wrapped up and the cheque was on the table while we were eating.  I would surely go again as this is the only place I get my indo Chinese fix :D"}
{"text":"We are usually satisfies with the  food here,but yesterday night  we ordered chicken in hot garlic sauce which was horrible..what came out totally different..it chicken in some kind of v tangy sauce ..close to  buffalo sauce."}
{"text":"I like Indian Chinese and simply loved the food here. :) Would defintely visit again :)"}
{"text":"Concur with the theme of the previous posts.    Pros: Indo-Chinese food that is more than passable.  Not as good as Mumbai (what is?) or NYC/SF, but still pretty darn good.  We like their fried rice and noodles more than their actual meat dishes.  I think their noodles/fried rice are 4-5 bit their actual meat dishes are 3-4.    Cons: service.  Horrible, horrible, horrible.  Did I mention that the service is horrible?  And this means all types of service, takeout and eating in.  In fact, we will not dine there anymore because the service is so bad.  So we stick with takeout.  But they have missed their promised time by more than an hour once before.  And that my friends, takes true effort.  If you get your food within 15 min of it being promised, consider yourself lucky.  These guys want to be so authentic, they are actually on IST (Indian Standard Time for the non-desis reading this).  That being said, it's something we put up with because we do like the food.  We order from here at least twice a month.  It would be more, and we'd also dine in, if there was any semblance of decent, timely service.    I hope the management can fix the service issue, because if they can't, they are going to frustrate otherwise loyal patrons."}
{"text":"Awful service tonight, so freaking disappointed on the eve of thanksgiving night. Came here with the family to have good time and good food but seriously disappointed. Just simply awful"}
{"text":"Appetizers especially the paneer and chicken were top of the world.  Main course sucks.  Deserts. Are normal.  Would advise on easing off the excessive egg taste in your mousse. Unless your main course improves this place is not worth the price."}
{"text":"We went for diner with friends and we ordered chilli fried paneer and chicken lat mai tai for appetizers.both were tasty.paneer was the best crispy and delicious.i would highly recommend. For main course we ordered chili hot garlic noodles,Burnt garlic fried rice and chicken chilli hot garlic.noodles were good.burnt garlic fried rice was ok.chixken was tasty too.had mango Lassi for drinks n it was good.i would  defiantly would give another try n go again."}
{"text":"The food was great.  Was little oily but tasted really good. The service was also fast. I felt it was little expensive especially the gratuity they added themselves for a party of 5. On the whole a must try place."}
{"text":"Best indo chinese food in phoenix.  I would recommend this place if you like spicy food. Must go"}
{"text":"Food was o-k! Service was less than ok- the server seemed to have an attitude. The food came out on time.   The place is very nice."}
{"text":"We went to this place and I am compelled to write this review. We have been to this place a while back and we liked the food.  We order same food, Chili chicken and chicken 65 extra spicy. Today couple of things happened. One, The food came out cold and tasted like cardboard. No flavor at all. Not sure when you can see so much sauce on the food yet no taste. Two, a couple of tables down, we saw a couple change their kid's diaper on the dining table. It was an absolute turnoff. When I told the waiter, he just ignored and went on with his business. We will never go that place again."}
{"text":"We were visiting friends in AZ and went here for lunch on a weekday  as well as dinner on a weekend. The ambience is very nice and the décor is classy and the place is kept very neat and tidy. The staff was very friendly and attended to our needs.   There sure was a faster response time when it was less crowded during the weekday lunch compared to the fully packed weekend evening. Nonetheless, we were blown away by the food when it came. My favourites were the Chicken 65 and the Paneer in the Appetizers section. There were enough quantities and the presentation and the taste were excellent. I would definitely eat from here again on my next visit."}
{"text":"Service was absolutely horrible and the menus and sauce bottles were filthy dirty! I didn't even want to use the sauces because the bottles were so crusted and dirty!!!"}
{"text":"This place is getting repetitive on my list for my husband. This is because the items here taste like Indo-Asian fusion and more importantly their sauces are awesome. On this visit, I noticed a rack full of sauces and noodles for sale with pretty ok price 3$.  However am not a fan for Indo Asian but yes their chilli chicken and fried rice are unbeatable. And for the crowd who feels this is a pricey place - try their HAPPY HOUR."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend and had excellent service and excellent food. We had the Mongolian Beef and the Lobster Butter Garlic and both were delicious. The pomegranate coconut martini itself was worth the trip! We will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Horrible. Ordered them through a good delivery service .  Instead of calling they just decided to say they didn't have 2 out of the 3 items so they wanted me to pay $20 for crappy soup. It was disgusting and overpriced. I could have made a better one with the instant packages for 1.99"}
{"text":"Lacking. Not much flavor, not much hospitality.   Perhaps it's bc it was take out or perhaps high expectations that this must be the best Chinese food I'm ever going to have because I've never heard of 7 Chinese dishes in small boxes enough for one European serving costing $187.  However, what I found offensive is that I asked if I had everything to complete my order and they verified but when I got home there wasn't any sauces and they gave me 4 fortune cookies. It's just odd that you can go to any other Chinese food establishment and you get two meals and they send you home with 12 fortune cookies & a fresh orange, yet this extravagant place is so cheap they give you 4 fortune cookies and no condiments, not even orange sauce for the spring rolls. Come on, that's what makes these tasteless cabbage fried sticks taste like anything haha. Definitely not recommended."}
{"text":"This place is Indo-Chinese. Very nice décor, cool atmosphere.    If you like Indian, Thai or Chinese food you will probably like this place. The food has a lot of flavor and spice to it. If you are Indian, this is like little India inside with all the clientele, so a great place to take your Indian parent who are SUPER picky.   One note, their apps are better than their entrees. I think they do dry currys the best but with wet currys they are not as good."}
{"text":"Ordered the hakkah fried rice Ginger chili tofu and the Curry noodle  The portions were tiny AND food was very oily. Would never order from here again"}
{"text":"Five stars coz there isn't anything higher than that!  Excellent food,  very professional service and perfect ambience.  Best place for Indian chinese food hands down!  We drive all the way from Gilbert for this food!  Great job!  Love their veg coin manchurian and lat mai paneer!"}
{"text":"If you have eaten Chinese food in India, then when you eat here you are going to have a quick flashback (guaranteed). Though the taste is authentic I found the chicken dishes only so so .. the coating/sauce was nice but the chicken itself was not up to the mark. Anyway below is the gist.. Best dishes: veg Hakka noodles, veg Hakka rice, crispy chilli potatoes  Authenticity: 9/10 Service: 8/10 (very helpful) Hygiene: 8/10 Ambience:9/10"}
{"text":"Love their food especially chicken Manchurian,chilli chicken and hot chilli garlic!! definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"We were already heading pretty far north in Scottsdale so we thought we would make a venture out to Inchin Bamboo Garden for dinner. We received very attentive service when we arrived (there weren't too many people) and also throughout our meal as it started getting busier. They offer a happy hour special during the weekdays of buy one appetizer & one drink and get half off on both, so we started off with a Mango Mojito, a Pina Colada, Crispy Chili Baby Corn, and Chicken 65. My mom and I both enjoyed our drinks and preferred the Chicken 65 appetizer, however my fiancé was a big fan of the Crispy Chili Baby Corn. While the Chinese Bhel was not part of their happy hour special, my mom wanted to try it out. It looked very tasty when it came to our table, however was lacking flavor. There were some sauces on the table which we added to the bhel that made it a little bit better, however we all agreed we could have passed on that.  My mom and I were actually very full after the appetizers but decided to get a main dish for the three of us to share. The Chicken Manchurian was my fiancé's pick and we all had high expectations since the chicken appetizer was really good. We got the entrée gravy based (versus getting the dry version), but it was underwhelming so we actually asked if they would make us the dry version instead. This one was a bit better however it was lacking salt. The manager was gracious enough to try to make things right by getting us another entree so we appreciated it.  They have a fairly large menu of non-vegetarian, vegetarian, and even vegan options (upon request). Overall, because the happy hour special was a good deal and the appetizers were the best part of our dinner, I'd be willing to go back."}
{"text":"Been here 4-5 times in last yr. Food is always good esp Hakka noodles..can't find this taste anywhere else. Service had been slow , order messed up since last couple of times. We were told the manager has left and not replaced. Will come again for sure.."}
{"text":"I wish we had read the other yelp reviews before we went here, because it perfectly described our experience: over-priced, highly mediocre food and horrific service!  PROS: the interior is quite lovely. Very nice design and beautiful b&w photography in the hallway to the bathrooms.   CONS: everything else that goes into a restaurant. We went in at 6:30pm to have some drinks/apps on happy hour and order some entrees to go. The signs say that they open for dinner at 5:30pm and that happy hour is 5:30-7:30pm. No restrictions listed. When we came in, the restaurant was completely empty, we were the only people there. When we asked if we could order some food & drinks and order some entrees to go, we were told happy hour is only for dine in. I've never heard this before as I've done this at plenty of restaurants so only assumed that she didn't understand that we were planning to have the drinks and apps in the restaurant, just not the entrees we were ordering. It seemed pretty self-evident that we can't take cocktails to go. The server was clearly pissed at our stupid question so stormed off saying she would ask her manager, returned immediately saying her manager said no and went about setting up the bar and doing something on the pos system.  Just seems like hospitality 101 to me that if we are the only customers in your restaurant and planning to order lots of food, you would give us the few dollars discount on some cocktails, but fine. My mom ordered a cocktail and I ordered a wine. Angry server walked off again saying she was getting her manager. Turns out the manager, who was actually polite to us, is the only one there who knows how to make the cocktails on their menu. It took her about 10-15 to finally get our drinks (again, we are the only people in the restaurant) because she had to keep running to the back to stock the wine fridge, to get ice, to get clean glassware, etc.  So basically, this place was open for one hour (according to posted operations hours) and no one has prepped the bar or set anything up, and they are basically pushing out the only customers in the place! I guess it was somewhat comforting to see that the nasty server seemed to hate all customers, not just us. Some of her high moments: ignored everyone who walked in, people who went up to her to ask for a table were told \"hold on\" with an epic eye roll, sneered at us when we said \"thank you\" as we left.   Final takeaway: the food here is not good enough to justify going back after dealing with such awful attitude, complete affront to the concept of \"service industry\"."}
{"text":"Yummy spicy food - reminds of chinese food in India. Really good food and  ambiance, service ok but can be better."}
{"text":"Terrible service and average food. Vegetarian food was awful and helping person mixed up our soups. Only good for emergency options."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times because this is the only option for indo Chinese close to where I live.  Service is terrible so make sure your have a lot of free time on your calendar.  Food is overpriced but okay.   I am giving them a 1 star because of the horrible customer experience .  I have a few incidents but this one stands out. I use the 5 star app ( lnchin's loyalty program). They sent me an offer for a free appetizer. I ordered food to go but when I reached there they said the offer is only for dine in.  NOWHERE on the offer was this mentioned . The a** at the counter did not even have the courtesy to honor the coupon considering that I had driven all the way at 9 PM in the night .  I will modify this review to add some more incidents when I have some time.."}
{"text":"Service was very slow and inattentive.  Soup was inedible.  Cashew chicken had a burnt taste.  We left without finished our meal with apologies from the waiter.  Never done that before and definitely won't recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Decent food. Terrible service. Tried calling for 2 days to place an order for a pickup and clearly they don't care about the fact that their phone doesn't work (or maybe the servers are too darn lazy)...... Sorry Inchin. Lost my business for good"}
{"text":"I went to order to go and after waited 1 hour I got my food. I personally like Chinese food very much so I came here coz there are very few option for Chinese restaurant. I ordered hot n sour soup, lat mai kai, chicken 65, egg Hakka chowmein, chicken Hakka noodle, sweet n sour chicken, chilli garlic chicken.  Pretty much huh!! When I came home I saw that the appetizers are really small in quantity and doesn't taste that good.i took these items before and I loved those.though I like the chowmein and sweet n sour chicken.n think It ll b better if I dine in here next time.:("}
{"text":"This is the second time that we went to this place. We were a group of 8 and each and every one of us loved the food here! Especially the chilli fish, chilli chicken, Baby corn Manchurian, Chicken Hakka noodles and burnt garlic fried rice. their fried ice cream was just awesome. For those looking to eat the indo-Chinese favourites, this place will be your go-to place."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is pleasant, comfortable, and extremely inviting. A real calming vibe is in the air at the  Inchin Bamboo Garden.   Fast and friendly service paired with good food.  Our server was helpful, nice, and gave us some good suggestions with our food choices. Honestly, besides are server 2 other employees can to ask us how are meal was and if the spice was right. A super bonus, they have a gluten free menu so you don't have to take a stab in the dark."}
{"text":"Great place for Indian Chinese food. I have been a regular. Great food and great ambience. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Why, why, why do I always have \"bizarre-o\" experiences at restaurants?  I am beginning to think I am cursed! Is it so hard that I receive a balance of good customer service, good food and a nice atmosphere?  Is it too much to ask?  Really?  Read my other reviews and you will understand what I am talking about.  Dismal one and two star ratings, of otherwise highly rated restaurants!  Well, on to this story.............  I normally try to not frequent \"chain\" or \"franchised\" restaurants.  I don't like them.   When I go out and spend money, I want a chef preparing my food, not a cook.  If I want a cook to prepare my food, I will cook it myself - at home.  I am a cook, not a chef..............    I visited Inchin Bamboo Garden on 8/1/2013 with a group of co-workers celebrating a birthday lunch.  The birthday person chose the place.  It was noon and the place was completely empty when our party of 9 arrived.  We chatted a bit and then placed our order.  We all ordered off the lunch menu which included soup, a choice of rice and the entrée.  One of my co-workers was worried about the spice level of the black bean sauce in one of the vegetarian dishes and asked if she could have the sauce on the side.  About 15 min after we had all placed our order, the waitress came back and said she could not get the sauce on the side.  Hmmmm, why?  It was just sauce?  So we asked to speak to the manager as we felt this was not an unreasonable request.  The manager, begrudgingly, came over and said they could not serve her black bean sauce on the side because they are a franchise restaurant and they use prepared powdered mixes and it reconstitutes as they cook the dish.  Oh yeah, that sounds yummy!  NOT!  Oh, BTW - That was the LAST time we saw the manager.  About 40 minutes into our wait, still no soup.  Nothing.  Then SOME entrées start coming out.   I got mine, and I said to the waitress, \"Shouldn't the soup come first?\"  She said, \"Yeah, usually\".  Usually?  OK, whatever.  Out of the 9 of us, 5 got entrees AND soup, the other 4 had nothing not even the soup!  One of my co-workers ordered the chicken curry and her teeny, tiny bowl was only a tad over half full.  I will attach a picture.  Yes it was so pathetic I took a picture, the picture time stamp was 12:41 PM - make note of this.  My portion was small, but at least I got my full portion.  I ordered the Sliced Lamb Hot Garlic.  It was ok.  The rice was terrible!  I ordered the fried rice; it was dry, cold and flavorless.  It was like it had been made the day before and thrown onto my plate.  The hot and sour soup was cold on top and smoking hot in the middle.  It was not very good either.  I wanted to eat, I was hungry, but as my 4 other co-workers sat soupless and foodless - I held off.  So we waited, and waited and waited about another 15 minutes.  Finally the waitress brought 3 of 4 soups but still no entrees, one \"lone\" co-worker still sat with nothing.  We all had meetings and had to get back - so we had no choice but to ignore etiquette and start eating.  Then magically, one more lunch was served from the kitchen-which ended up not being what she ordered, but she accepted it anyway.  And then there were three, one co-worker still with no soup OR entrée!  We asked the waitress what the heck was going on? The waitress then told us that all our food WAS ready at the same time, but 4 of the 9 entrees were delivered to other tables.  What other tables?  There wasn't anyone else there when we ordered?  There was now ONE other table of people, but did they really have our food?  What was the coincidence of them ordering the same items?  Finally, at 1:03 PM, the last 3 entrees came out from the kitchen-sadly one had to be in a \"to-go\" bag because she had no time to eat because of her meeting and had to get back to work.  The other two co-workers just ate fast.  At the end of this horrible experience, they did comp the 4 missing meals and after asking they took 10 % off my bill - geez thanks.  The waitress made mention that the manager sent her out to us to apologize and to let us know that 4 servers quit that morning and they had to use kitchen staff to help run the food.  Well there were only 2 tables of people TOTAL, how many servers do you need to wait on 2 tables?  There were other people I saw working there doing nothing.  And what about the manager?  Where the heck was he?  Why wasn't he helping?  Never once did he come over to apologize, but instead sent the waitress out to do that for him?  Isn't that HIS job?  All he did was hide in the kitchen.  Truly terrible experience.  Ironically, the girl who had to get the \"to-go\" order and never got any soup, is from Seattle and she says that she used to frequent the franchise located there and said that it was wonderful!  Hard to believe that is true with the comedy of errors at this place!  This is a DO NOT RETURN - DNR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Service is absolutely horrible!!! I can't emphasize that enough. Like many Indian restaurants, the restaurant has lousy service and appears understaffed in my opinion. There was no hostess. We waited 10 minutes before anyone greeted us.  Once we were seated, no one greeted us and just kept passing by us. Yeah, I mean no one took our drink order. Finally, we had to flag a waiter and yell at them that no one even approached our table. Only then did they stop to even take an order. The water at the tables is lukewarm. The bottle they are in appeared dirty. For as nice as the restaurant appeared in terms of decor, they really should invest in a hostess and about 3 more waiters and teach them basic service etiquette.  The food is decent in my opinion. It's good but nothing noteworthy. I've had better Indian Chinese in other parts of the Valley. If the service was better, I would have considered back here. But with the lousy service, I don't recommend dining here. If you are go to dine, I recommend a few things. Bring bottles of cold water. Based on my experience, I think there is a good chance your water and drinks will not be refilled. Our water was never refilled, not once!! Also any drink they bring you will be served lukewarm. Asking for ice was like asking for gold; it's a rare commodity here in my opinion and when they brought ice in drinks, there was hardly any in the glass. Dress lightly and bring some hand held fans. The restaurant was very warm and the ventilation was poor imho. This was winter, I hate to imagine what it's like in the summer here. Arrive here with the mentality that you are in Russia circa 1980's. Expect long waits! Maybe have a few alcoholic drinks prior to arriving here to mellow you out cuz you will be frustrated."}
{"text":"Went for lunch in Inchin's couple of times .. A good place for noodles and fried rice .."}
{"text":"UPDATE: From the management:  but I would like to point out that our fried rice does not have peas or carrots either  Classic. My photos clearly indicate your restaurant is indeed using frozen peas and carrots.   Indian? The only thing Indian about the place is the Basmati rice and the clientiele. On a recent Saturday night, the place was packed with Indian folks (and Indian babies yelling), but this is not an Indian restaurant obviously. If you don't have any NAAN, then excuse me, you are nothing. If your telling me that the six sauces on the table will make my food taste Indian, then your wrong again. The entire menu is Chinese and they can't do that right either. Take a look at my disgusting, tiny frozen shrimp and that is one indication. The singapore noodles were not bad, but the shrimp and grease from whatever else went into the dish made it pretty poorish. The \"fried\" rice doesn't have soy sauce, so that's not authentic and they use frozen peas and carrots in the rice as well. I did not notice many Indian apps, except for fried cheese, but if you order the $8 veggie spring rolls and the place knows you are going to split them, please give us four, not three rolls. Most dipping sauces will tear your tongue off with hotness as well.   How about tandori chicken Chow mein or Naan Moo Shu? This turns out to be part of a big chain and corporate folks need to make changes and my email has been sent about that poor excuse for shrimp. About $11 per plate lost tonight."}
{"text":"Very quiet over lunch hour. Was exactly what I was looking for too. However I hope they aren't relying on their lunch crowd for business, because it's lacking.   The food was great. $8.10 for soup, veggie egg roll and mixed veggies and brown rice.   Ladies working were super nice and I enjoyed their company while sitting at the bar.   I'll be back. Super spicy just the way I like it!!!"}
{"text":"Did not even get to a table, despite having called an hour before and asked for a table for 7 at 7! The female on the phone told me that they were not taking any more reservations but for us to come on in and they would seat us. Upon arrival there was no greeting from any of the staff. I walked up to the person who seemed in charge and had to get his attention as he was more involved with another (yawning) employee. I won't go into any further details but I see the common thread about poor service in all the reviews! I concur."}
{"text":"Great food and ambience. We ordered the spring rolls and lamb momos. The spring rolls were so crispy and the spicy sauce with it was brilliant! The American chopsuey and chilli fish were great entrees too. Highly recommend this place who love indo-chinese fusion food."}
{"text":"New management change has led to better food quality. Also, I think the prices have come down a bit. Was there a week back and really loved again the food. Last year, we thought the food quality was not as good. But things have changed now!"}
{"text":"Take your money else where cause they don't deserve it.  RUDE STAFF MEMBERS.  Subpar food for the price.  I would have been happy going to Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Tones of veggie and meat eater choices . The decor is open floor plan with Asian decorations. Wait staff is friendly. They are very helpful in choosing great tasting dishes for the mood you are in."}
{"text":"It was totally worth the ride. Everything we ordered was superb, over the top delicious. The place was crowded on a Friday night, and had a good ambience. I wish they had better service at the bar. I was dry with no water until the end of the meal. But the food was so good that it would take more than that to keep me away though"}
{"text":"The absolute worst. I should have trusted my fellow yelpers a little more. I was craving an Asian type food and this was the closest to me and I haven't been so I wanted to try it.  First of all. I was ignored for a minimum of 4-5 minutes standing at the front waiting to be seated. Stared at by 2 employees and never acknowledged to just be seated. Already set me off. I was never apologized to for the wait or anything. He also looked at me like I was an idiot when I told him I wanted to sit down to eat lunch. Mind you this place was dead and 3 other tables out of 50.   I waited another 5 minutes for him to take my order. I ordered the Szechuan Beef and I wanted noodles instead of rice. I just wanted to sub rice for noodles. And it was so difficult to order with this guy like I was asking for a bar of gold. So he takes the order. Then comes back and says do you want beef or chicken. I'm like bro, I just want noodles sub instead of rice. So I was so ticked and I just ordered rice and said screw it.   The meal was missing something. So me, myself had to go and get the sauces because the waiter didn't bother offer of get me any. He never checked on me once. The sauces made it better.   The service is garbage. The food was mediocre at best. Corporate needs to come here and revamp this disaster of an establishment. Not recommended and I won't be back."}
{"text":"Appetizers came the end of the meal, soup almost room temperature like,  chilli chicken too salty, lemon drop cocktail equal to bad lemonade.  Their excuses are lame like the bartender quit so as the cook. The restaurant open 2013 and they still didn't get the house in order. Bottom line everything just plain suck!"}
{"text":"Best ever Indo Chinese food in Phoenix . Best customer service , ambience and taste. Must try for special occasions. Very friendly service and good with big groups ."}
{"text":"Ordered things for kids menu... After waiting 40 min server told us that we did not order any such thing and kitchen is closed... After spending huge amount for table still have to look for McDonald to get kid his meal... Server needs to pay attention and repeat the order because she writes anything she likes... Also mixed up chicken corn soup to vegetable soup..."}
{"text":"This review is specific to the Scottsdale, AZ location.  According to me, the 5 stars in the review stand for: 1. Ambiance 2. Quality of Food 3. Value of Costumer - Reception and Service 4. Price 5. Value of Time - Waiting and Serving  in whatever order.  The two stars are for Ambiance and Quality of Food. We were not very well treated. And I would like for the management to take a look at their staff's work. I agree, we were late, we reached there only by 9:32 PM and they close by 10:00 PM. We really wanted to have food here and that's the only reason we came all the way from 15 miles. But apparently, their kitchen closes by 9:45 PM. Understandably they didn't want to serve us there. But, they were ready to give us a to-go. Now, we didn't come all the way just to take-out, so we 'requested' them to serve us there. This female, who was talking to us exclaimed - \"Are you guys serious, do you want to do that to the kitchen?\"  I really don't see as to why someone has to react like that. You could have very well told us that it was not possible. When we decided to leave anyway, one of the waitresses came over and told us it was okay to dine in. We sat down. All this happened before 9:45 PM and we placed the order well before they 'claimed' their kitchen closed. After all this drama, we see a group of 4 walk in, no questions asked, they are shown the table. And sitting where we were, I see the lady who was rude to us, enact the whole scene to someone, supposedly the manager for the night. I mean, how uneducated are you? You treat us like we are causing inconvenience and in front of us, you welcome others even after your kitchen is closed. I don't want to play down their service after we placed the order, but the way we were welcomed almost killed our hunger. We are NEVER EVER going to go again. Thanks to all the treatment.   It's interesting how Indians can be mistreated in an Indian Restaurant. We don't want anybody's job to be affected. With that attitude, they are not going to go too far, anyway. May be it's time for some introspection. Believe me, there are many options and you are not the only restaurant. People might forget what you served them, but please remember that they will not forget how you made them feel."}
{"text":"They have ruined indian chinese food. I only enjoyed the chilli baby corn and that's it. The soup came cold and it took very very long. They used to be amazing and now they have fallen. They had forgotten my order for soup and I had given up. I do not recommend coming here. Their price for the food is to expensive for the bad quality and taste."}
{"text":"If you love spicy food..this is the place to be.... the chinese food has indian touch to it which i simply love and die for... portions are little small for the price.. but thats all i can have with so many chillies added :)... washrooms have to be worked on.. have to be cleaner..and there was NO diaper changing table..which was a discomfort"}
{"text":"The service is pathetic and the food quality has gone very bad, compared what it used to be before. They also have stopped serving the special sauces without which the food is no good."}
{"text":"One of a few restaurants that offer Indianised Chinese food. This is as good as it gets. I came here skeptical, but left a fan. Everything we ordered was good and tasted great. The ambience is also very nice. If you have never tried this cuisine, I highly recommend that your try it here."}
{"text":"Fortunate enough to attend a tasting event and absolutely loved everything we had. Some new drinks to try out are the See No Evil with rum and blackberries. Spice Trader for the whiskey drinkers."}
{"text":"So freaking excited that we finally have an indian-chineese fusion place around here!  My wife and I love indo chineese... it's one of the fusions we look forward to on all our trips to india.  With these two countries neighboring each other it's not surprising the flavors are compatible and can cross pollinate so well.  The only real question is why hasn't it picked up more in the US.    That said, Inchin Bamboo Garden is a breath of fresh air in the relatively mediocre indian food options we have in the Phoenix area. Hallelujah!     That said, they're not quite into our regular rotation for a few key reasons.  1) The service needs some work.  Too often we found ourselves waiting for soda/water refills, etc.  This might be because the location was relatively new when we went there, so I'm willing to not slam them on this as much as I would a more established place.  Pick it up guys.  2) Some of the dishes seemed to err just a bit on salt/msg side common in some cheaper chineese restaurants. Again, they were new and were probably still dialing things in.    All that said, those draw backs weren't really bad enough to prevent us from going there again...   Because honestly the food is that much fun!  And vegetarians... EAT HERE!! LOTS OF NUMMY NUMMY GOODNESS for you :)   And protip:  Chili Paneer.   YUM YUM!! EAT IT!"}
{"text":"The food was good but the service was not good. The restaurant was completely empty during lunch. One of the servers was very impatient and rushed our orders."}
{"text":"Went to happy hour tonight and the salt and pepper shrimp and the drums of heaven were excellent. The server Soma was very nice and pleasant and the manager always says hello and checks on me to see how my meal is."}
{"text":"Food is really good. But the service is aweful. I don't understand what part of restaurant service they don't get. They have such good food and I hope they don't screw up with the service and drive away the customers forever. I may be one ov those if they continue with this type of ridiculous service ."}
{"text":"Excellent food, friendly service, relaxed ambience! We were in a large group, so had the opportunity to try various items across the menu...loved them all."}
{"text":"Did an uber eats. Amazing food!! Got the hakka noodles and the Chicken Schezuan. The noodles were delicious with chicken, lamb and shrimp mixed in. The Schezuan was so flavorful! Only downside, I think I ate too much. Cant wait to order again. Don't understand the bad reviews here, I thought the food was great!!"}
{"text":"Omg. I don't think I've have this good of Asian food in forever.   Chicken 65 on point  Manchurian DRY AND WITH GRAVY ON POINT  Staff was very accommodating for our large party that showed up right before kitchen was about to close.   Large portions!"}
{"text":"What a fall.  I am a great fan of Indo-Chinese food, and hence we went here often, though this place is about a 40mile drive.  Initially the food was great, the service was OK. Gradually the service went from OK to bad. On our as last two visits even the food was bad.   We ordered cauliflower manchurian, veg coin manchurian, and burnt garlic friedrice. Both the manchurians were only warm, as opposed to being hot. I don't think they were made fresh. The Veg coins were not cooked properly. The burnt garlic fried rice was good.   We also ordered veg noodles, and they gave us a bowl of noodles without any vegetables at all.   Since this is the only Indo-Chinese restaurant in the valley, clearly the owners got complacent, and there is not enough supervision. I will not be going there any more."}
{"text":"Amazing place for a info Chinese cuisine. HV been coming here for almost an year now and never been disappointed.  They also brought their sweet chilli sauce back!!!"}
{"text":"We were a group of 8 adults and 6 kids and wanted to tell this place. It was a saddening to see the level this place is de-graded since it was opened. We used to to try this place once a place around that time and it was ok back then.  Service: The person who takes order uses a 1x1 sticky note or note pad and write down the order eventually confusing himself and the ones who is placing order. We ended up getting wrong and missing dishes afterwards.   We asked if we can use the private area which was already vacant since we are a big party. They told the group need to have 10adults to use that. We were 14 with 8 adults and 6 kids. Good logic?!!  The guy who brings food is apparently very rude, he don't like us telling him where to keep the food on table and strike back with his arrogant comments. He is also busy flirting with the bar attendant, not that I am against it but when you do it during your service time in a very visible manner to the customers, it does matter.  The food!! Everything tasted same. Probably poured same sauce on all dishes we ordered. The schezwan fried rice is not even close to schezwan! Please check on what the chef is doing at kitchen."}
{"text":"(This restaurant has multiple locations throughout the U.S. This review is specifically for the Inchin's location in Scottsdale, AZ).  I have to admit, I never knew that Indian-style Chinese food was a thing until we ran across Inchin's while searching for a vegetarian-friendly restaurant for our fourth and final night in Scottsdale during our annual Spring Training trip! I'm very pleased to have made its acquaintance, especially as it turns out there's an Inchin's location in Sunnyvale, CA, not too far from our home near Santa Cruz!  We were attracted by the on-line menu, which has clearly marked vegetarian and non-vegetarian listings for each section, from appetizers through entrees, to rice and noodle dishes. I was also attracted by the fact that the restaurant has a full bar, as I do love a drink before dinner, and that's an aspect of dining that a lot of vegetarian-oriented restaurants tend to neglect.  The location in Scottsdale is in a strip shopping center on the northern end of town. When we first arrived we were concerned the restaurant might be closed, as it looked rather dark, but were reassured by the savory smells wafting around the entrance (my husband's first comment was \"something sure smells good!\"). We were there around 7 p.m. on a Wednesday evening, so the restaurant wasn't very crowded, and we were seated right away.  The dining room is very attractive: sleek and modern, with an emphasis on darker colors (Which may be why the place looked dark from outside. It was well-lighted inside). I have a feeling it might get noisy when it's very crowded, but it was quiet enough on the night we were there.  Our waiter was very knowledgeable, and helped us make informed choices from the extensive and mostly unfamiliar menu. We decided on spring rolls for an appetizer, with Szechuan Fried Rice (fiery) and Manchurian Cauliflower (mild) for our main dishes. I got my cocktail -- a HUGE Black Russian that was served in a water glass (generous bartender!) -- and my husband got his usual iced tea (guess who drove home that night!)  Our food came out of the kitchen quickly (I don't think we waited more than 10 minutes after ordering, if that). The spring rolls were lovely, and we especially liked the slightly tangy sauce that came with them (a change from the usual plum sauce). This dish was perfectly sized as an appetizer for two (might suit for three people, if they have light appetites, but for four or more you'd definitely want multiple orders). The two entree dishes, however, were quite generously sized (in fact, we ended up taking some of both back to the hotel and eating them for breakfast before heading out for Flagstaff the next morning!). I especially loved the fried rice, which was enthusiastically spicy, and so flavorful I could barely stop eating it (\"just one more bite!\"). The cauliflower was delicious too...nicely caramelized, with a good, garlicky flavor, and served with fragrant basmati rice.  All in all, a truly excellent introduction to a new culinary genre for us! Can't wait to try the location in Sunnyvale (and we'll definitely be back to this location next time we're in Scottsdale!)"}
{"text":"Nice food. some times too much rush.. so food quality will not be good. For veg. people you can try Veg-coin it is too good.."}
{"text":"Excellent food. We had been eagerly looking forward to its opening as we love their Atlanta branch. Food was spicy and very close to the Indian food we get back home. The kids loved the Gobi Manchurian appetizer. The chili chicken was fabulous and so was the burnt garlic fried rice. The hot and sour soup was meh. The quantities were perfect. So happy to have an Indian-Chinese place in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I came here to meet my close friend before I moved to California. My friend introduced me to this place and I love it so much. Food was great and nice ambience. We didn't check out the bar but I stopped by to take a pic of it because it looked so cool!"}
{"text":"I drove to Inchins on their very first day and without a doubt it was very crowded. I had to leave the place without any dinner because I have a 7 month old son and he would not allow me to wait for a long time. No complains there.  I came back on the upcoming Wednesday and the place had mild traffic. The service was terrific and we were served our food quickly. Service was very good and I commend the place for that. Not too sure how efficiently they would function in extremely high traffic.   Moving on to the food:  1) Not too spicy as you get it in India (but I dont mind that part)  2) Generous portion sizes  3) Good menu choices (vegetarian and non vegetarian)  4) Prices: Not on the modest side. $10 for a starter is a little bit high for me.  5) Additional sauces on the side are a big plus and improve the taste of the food.  Overall, I would recommend this place to anyone who would like to try out something new for a change. But if you expect spicy indianized chinese, this is not for you.  EDIT: Visited this location again. The staff was pleasant as usual, but the food is downright boring. The Chineese bhel was probably fried in used oil and the Chicken manchurian lacked any flavor. Not going back to this place. Boring...yawn!  EDIT 01/13/2017: Somehow I still keep thinking this place has improved, but it keeps getting worse by the day. Read the sauce bottles, as in, when they were manufactured. I had the chilli garlic sauce which was manufactured in Feb 2014 on the table (just a couple of days ago i.e.). Remember the funny Heinz ketchup ad's back in India..these sauces had the same consistency and would not flow in any direction. The point being, they were 200% expired and still were there. Had the honor of tasting Chilli Chicken main entree and guess what, there was no chilli in it. Not even a sliver of chilli hopes. Now I usually dont rant about a place this frequently, but paying 60 bucks for dinner (for 4 dishes) and not getting 1 thing right makes me really frustrated. If you are really craving for some fusion cuisine, try Panda express. They are lot better than this so called restaurant."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!! Not even fresh food.. cold severed food.. quantity was barely sufficient for 1 person. It is not same anymore.. dont go and waste your money and time"}
{"text":"My husband and i went for dinner at Inchin last evening. We arrived at 8 40pm and the place was packed, we were seated at the bar until we got our table. We had a few daiquiris and margaritas- nothing special there. For appetizer we had the fried chicken wantons. They were deep fried, as hard as rocks, i could taste nothing. We also tried the mixed fried rice, and scjezuan chicken. The rice was not too bad, it was un oily, which i appreciated. The chicken was  good too, reminded me of the Chinese fare i am used to from eastern India:) All in all, the food was ok, the place is a little un managed though. There were folks who were party of 4, seated at a 6 person table, thereby wasting two seats, those could have been pulled out to make a makeshift table,which would have reduced the wait times."}
{"text":"Wow, I'm glad I read the reviews after going or we might have passed all together. We chalked it up to them being terribly understaffed but by the sounds of all of the reviews, that's their typical MO. We waited to be seated, we waited for drink order to be taken and received (and although they have a full bar they don't make any drinks - including a simple martini- that aren't on the menu!?)- and needless to say, we waited for our food. When the lettuce wrap appetizer finally arrived, so did my husband's main course. Mine came 15 minutes later. We actually liked the food - and the server was kind and so apologetic for all of the service 'misses' - but we won't be back. Nearly two hours for a simple Asian meal is crazy! And if all of that wasn't enough, we saw a 'Larry the cable guy' type of customer use his TEETH to unscrew a stubborn lid on a table sauce bottle!!! Another review said a family changed a diaper on a table? What's going on here?? Do customers check their common sense and manners at the door?? Ugh ..."}
{"text":"Gave this place two tries and the food is just not good.  I've had the Chili Chicken, Hakka Noodles, Eggplant, Lamb Momo's and Hot and Sour Soup.  Generally speaking, the food is oily and flavourless.  The noodles were actually better cold (and drenched in sriracha).  The momo's are disgusting.  They are clearly not homemade, even though it says so on their menu.  You can always tell from how waxy the wrappers are.  The filling is so overground it feels like you're eating cat food.  The lamb had an overpowering gamey flavor - usually a sign of bad quality meat.  Also, they were 6 for $10.  This is literally a disgrace to momo's.  The hot and sour soup had SO MUCH black pepper in it.  EW.  HSS is usually flavored with white pepper so you get the heat without that much of the sting.  Also, it's not sour; wtf! Unless you like torturing yourself, don't order this soup.  Honestly, I don't understand the positive reviews.  The food here is really bad.  It's unfortunate because we really don't have any fusion options around here BUT I'd rather eat regular Chinese/Indian than deal with this sad attempt.  Hard pass."}
{"text":"So far the worst food I have ever tasted and service was even worst. The only reason I have given two star because I didn't died after eating their food."}
{"text":"I will never go back.  I said I would give it another chance (which I shouldn't have) after my last review and I did that.  More of the same.  Terrible service.  Took 5 minutes to even be greeted to get my take out.  Then the person behind the bar said and I quote \"yeah, it will likely be 25 minutes before we can even start your order\".  This is too bad, but three strikes and you're out."}
{"text":"Great place for Asian cuisine. If you order fiery, have a glass of water next to you - it really will be fiery! Overall ambience is very nice however the music killed the mood. It's a very warm, cozy next to the fireplace type of ambience with Rihanna playing in the background. It was out of place.  Overall great place for lunch and dinner with friends and family"}
{"text":"It has the best Indianized Chinese food in town. Both the veg and non-veg options are good over here. It might be a bit crowded during weekends for dinner or during weekdays for lunch. But overall good food great service and must visit place."}
{"text":"**Vegetarian Friendly**  I was really excited to try this place because of their indo-chinese selection.  They have a vegetarian and non-vegetarian, and even vegan menu! Love that they appeal to all types of diets.   Appetizer: Corn Soup and Chinese Behl Both were delicious, but I wish the behl was spicier. I was impressed how long the behl stayed crispy.   Dinner: Hakka Noodles and Manchurian The noodles were just as I expected, but were too bland for my taste. I was completely disappointed in the Manchurian. It was soggy and had no flavor.   TIP: If you like very flavorful and spicy food look for items on the menu that are \"tangy.\"  Overall, I'm sure there are hidden gems on their menu because the restaurant smelled phenomenal. I would give this restaurant a second change if I was in the area, but not go out of my way for."}
{"text":"This restaurant has actually changed quite a bit. The food was pretty good. We got our food very quickly and our waitress was pretty nice. We were overall happy with our experience, but one thing that should be noted is that more than half of our food seemed to be reheated in the microwave since the food came out a bit cold. The food would have tasted a lot better had it been served hot."}
{"text":"Ambience was great but food was very mediocre. The noodles tasted good. I didn't like the Manchurian. Food was very spicy."}
{"text":"Really loved their pan fried chilli paneer. My wife loved deir sweet chilli sauce. Wanted to buy 1 ;)"}
{"text":"I think this is one and only Indo-chinese restaurant in Phoenix area. Nice and clean place. Food was really good. We went on a Thu with reservation and was not crowded.   Try the Manchurian Chicken ... Tasty"}
{"text":"I ordered shrimp and rice because I figured that would be quick, easy and simple. I was a bit disappointed that the waitress told me it would take 15 minutes for my Manchurian shrimp, but I was patient. However, after 20 minutes of waiting and watching someone from the back come and talk to the waitress and shake his head, I became worried. After 25 minutes, she finally gave me a bag and I was too tired to check and went home. What I received was more of a shrimp soup. I will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"I wish I could give it negative stars. This place sucks big time. The food was edible until last year. It just kept getting worse. Indo-Chinese food is big time popular in India and there will always be new people who will keep trying this place and therefore this place will be in business and will keep serving substandard food. The most ridiculous part is the money they charge. You'd almost end up paying twice the amount you'd pay in place like Pei-Wei for similar quantity of food. PLEASE LOOK FOR ANOTHER PLACE FOR CHINESE FOOD. THIS PLACE SUCKS BIG TIME"}
{"text":"This place is amazing ... Very close to Native indo Chinese food ... I love the crispy chili baby corn and Mushroom as well. Also the fried rice varieties are awesome ...and of course the masala soda   Only disadvantage is they give very less quantity at times .."}
{"text":"Worst experience I ever had, in terms of service it was not up to the mark. I also didn't like food taste wise."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and made one attempt to get an event catered. This review combines all.  The food is good. If I could split the stars between food and service, the food would have got 4.5 stars out of 5. A ding of a star for portion size. It is small. In the overall review, the two negative stars above are for the customer service and portion size, specifically, when you try to cater an event. The portion size for the catering menu claims it can feed 10 people for $100 for a vegetarian menu and $130 for a Chicken menu. Our event headcount was 15 and we decided to order one of each, total would have been $230  http://www.bamboo-gardens.com/wp-content/themes/bamboo/images/IBG_cateringmenu_forweb.pdf    We attempted to reach the manager. We were told that he was not in the office and our contact info was noted. The guy did not call back. On the fourth try, we got hold of him.  The manager said that though the menu said 10, the quantity in the tray would not suffice ten people. It would be half of a half tray...( whatever that means). If it says 10, it should suffice 10 at least, if not more.   He recommended that we order 2 appetizer 2 entree 1 rice 1 noodle for $320. Delivery charge is $75. We asked why we could not order exactly as per the catering menu, only to be told that \"he did not work that way\" and also asked to place the order right then and now, since he had a lot of orders. It seemed that he did not want my business. Message taken."}
{"text":"Very Bad Service!!! Made us wait forever and food is not worth the wait at all! Bad hospitality!"}
{"text":"The food was not acceptable.  The guy who took order do not even write order and have a attitude problem. The food was totally different than other locations of same franchises in different states. Moreover the food was not tasty. Moreover it looks like the management is new and down not focus on customer satisfaction and quality service. Never go again."}
{"text":"I n my husband had been to inchin on sunday . we ordered tomato ginger clear soup and wonton soup it was awesome. Crispy baby corn Manchurian was yummy too . lastly we ordered fresh lichi ice cream it was soo good ."}
{"text":"Maybe we ordered the wrong dishes but this places food sucks and taste like we're at a Pei Wei  My hot tea was served cold The dumplings were cold  There's nothing Indian about this place.  The chicken 65 tastes like a spicy general Tsos.    Off night?  I won't be back"}
{"text":"I am posting a single star cause I couldn't go any lower. The services of this place has been the poorest I have experienced recently.   My friends recommended this place but I was so majorly let down. I placed the order for appetizers and it took more than 50 mins to get the appetizers on my table. And the communication level was minimal as to why the order was delayed.  The food was subpar at best, and there was absolutely no apology from the restaurant staff.   Wouldn't like to come back to this place."}
{"text":"Great place for Indo-Chinese food. We ordered Chili Babycorn dry, Paneer chiili, Chilli Garlic Noodles. Everything tasted pretty good. We reached at 9.30 and the restaurant closes at 10. My only complaint is that we were handed over the check when we were only halfway through our food. Table etiquette was totally missing which was a bit surprising for a restaurant of this stature. I would definitely recommend this place for Indo-Chinese lovers."}
{"text":"One of the best places in US that serves Indo-Chinese food. The other place that comes to mind similar to Inchin is the Chinese Mirch on the east coast. Out of the two Inchin wins in the food quality and taste and the options. Also it stands out pretty well in terms of the ambience and service.   The pan fried chilli paneer and 'drums of heaven' are the shining stars of the big menu. Schezuan fried rice and cauliflower manchurian fares out pretty decent too. If you are in the phoenix area, Inchin is definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"The service here is absolutely horrible. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because the food is decent."}
{"text":"Great food as always in every Inchins location same spicy level and good amount for lunch serving . Had crispy chili honey chicken with hot and sour soup and chicken fried rice taste will be mouth till dinner ."}
{"text":"How did we miss coming out to this restaurant. Food was delicious. Ambiance, service was excellent. We tried paneer chili, fish chili, vegetarian Momo, and, everything just turned out superb. Definitely coming back.   They have variety of sauces which can spice up your every bite."}
{"text":"I had so much hope for this place , but they are in need of more sites and waitresses please!    Also , the food took so long even complimentary iced water, due to lack of employees!   Shrimp chili entree lacked spiciness! 1/5 stars!  Momos were awesome , but I took a look at the garlic chili sauce with the others and there was some kind of expiration date I'm guessing? Not sure but momos 5/5!  Sczechuan chicken was a 5/5 !!  Chicken 65 5/5 as well!    The lack of stars is due to lack of waiters and food taking so long to come out !! And for getting my margarita order done wrong!!! How can a Mexicana like myself order a margarita with rum instead of TEQUILA !!?? No no no ! I had to order my shot and add it to my margarita myself ! Lol    I expected much more from this place"}
{"text":"Nice place  Always a pleasure to have food at this place   I don't miss the Indian flavor and I love their new menu   Keep it up"}
{"text":"It used to be a great place for Indo chinese food, but not anymore. Their service has disappointed me every time I have visited recently.  I was served a so called \"similar\" dish since the one I ordered was out of stock (of which I was not informed while I placed the order)."}
{"text":"Worst Management, the lady at the front desk  stopped us from having the fortune cookies from the waiter, inturn, she asked waiter to say they dont have cookies. She forced waiter to take the cookies back that waiter was getting for us. Very cheap!"}
{"text":"Excellent food!! I loved the Chili Paneer, drums of heaven, Chicken 65. They have an excellent Bar. Will be back again definitely."}
{"text":"The haka noodles and lunch deals are awesome and this is a come to for date nights and nice couple getaways."}
{"text":"Great indochineese food. Hakka noodles were amazing, and cauliflower Manchurian was good too. The service was slow and we were a bit disappointed when we were told that the kitchen closes at 9:55 when we tried to other another serving of Hakka noodles st 9:58. I wish the staff had informed us earlier. But overall I was happy and would visit again."}
{"text":"Loved the food and the service. ... sejal was very good server too!"}

{"text":"Very very bad service. On weekends you may have to wait up hours before getting ahead on a simple order. Food is pretty ordinary like. Nothing is special as such. 2 stars for the decorations thgh :)"}
{"text":"Very bad service and costly nowadays. On top of that huge gratuity. Service was pretty rude(a guy with long hair). Stay away. Quantity was also very less. Order was taken  in a paper which makes things very confusing. It used to be on an iPad earlier."}
{"text":"The Paneer Appetizer was amazing. Just loved it . Entree was just fine. Service was slow , Maybe we reached very close to the closing time. Ordered a Mango Mojito - which was basically Mango frutti ith a hint of Bacardi. In short wasnt worth it.  I would recommend it - as a one time visit , as it is the only Indo -Chinese restaurant around."}
{"text":"In recent times, the quality and taste of the food has gone down. We tried the Manchurian which was watery and bland. Chilli paneer was tough. Service was prompt."}
{"text":"This is the place to be for a sure shot treat for your taste buds!  Rice and noodles here are tender and thin, you eill"}
{"text":"This place is a revelation.Tasteful Interiors,GREAT food just sheer perfection. Any One who has ever had Indian-Chinese in India can understand how wonderful it feels when you find the taste of Calcutta in a restaurant in Arizona.  I would like to congratulate the minds behind this concept.A restaurant that caters only to fusion Asian cuisine is truly a bold move. This place makes me a little less homesick and judging by how full it is on a Monday evening further validates the fact that Food truly transcends all boundaries. Me and my husband have been aching for some Indian-Chinese lately and it did satisfy our cravings. We got Fried Rice,Chili garlic noodles,Vegetable Manchurian,Pan fried chili paneer (cottage cheese) to-go. My order was ready in about 15 minutes.  The only thing i would say is that the place is a little pricey compared to other Indian restaurants as my total was $50.Any how i'm going to frequent this place and look forward to trying all the items on their menu.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Absolutely, Meh, I've experienced better. I don't know what happened to them but they seem to get worse and worse recently. At our last visit, the Mongolian beef was under cook and very slimy. The water always taste weird and this time the rice was also so bad. I really liked this place before and it was our go to restaurant but my last two experience was just very bad in comparison to what you pay them. I'm still enjoying their noodle and chicken 65 but I don't think a restaurant has to be gone for only two menu items."}
{"text":"The chili chicken was delicious.  Reasonable portion size.  Good Indian/Asian beer selection.  Definitely will come back and try other dishes.  Quiet, attractive decor. On subsequent visits have tried the Chicken 65, honey chicken, pepper chicken. Lunch or dinner, it's all good. Consistently tasty"}
{"text":"Unfortunately the only Indo-Chinese restaurant in the valley area. Ambience and decor is good. Soups are good. Food is not spicy even if you ask for extra spice. Thank God they have sauce bottles on the table. Vegetarian dishes are better than non-vegetarian dishes. Appetizers are good, non veg entrees are so-so. Little on the oily and greasy side. definitely worth going if you crave indo-Chinese food."}
{"text":"By far one of the WORST dining experiences I have had.  Food tasted like nothing. They would not give us food that was on the menu even though they had it listed.  We ordered belvedere vodka and grey goose vodka and they did a bait and switch and gave us shithouse vodka that tasted like Assoline.  I have loved my Scottsdale dining experience until now.. this was HORRIBLE.  I see a night or two hanging over the toilet in my neat future :( One last issue.  If your child prefers chicken nuggets for dinner.. go to McDonald's first because that's what they serve there... True story!"}
{"text":"Really need 1/2 stars here, more like 3 1/2.  This is not a Chicago restaurant  but for dumbed down Scottsdale it is decent.  At least there are some interesting choices and the food is pretty tasty.  A bit heavy handed on the salt or soy I think, but some good flavors.  I chose the hottest dished available, and they were still not very hot for me, but I could add some of the table sauces and that did it.  My hsb likes blander dishes like the stir fried beef.  The chicken and beef were good quality, not grisly like some places.  Our service was fine, we had a really pretty Indian-American girl who was on the ball.  The place was 1/2 full Saturday when we came in at 7:30 then really got busier.  Most of the patrons were ethnic which isalways a good sign.  But most appeared to be of Indian heritageor that neighborhood, not Asian.  Anyhow, we'll try it again.  There is really slim pickings wth this type of food here."}
{"text":"New location near my office in Scottsdale. We ordered 3 items for to-go lunch, fried egg plant, Chili Chicken and Shrimp Szechwan style.  All 3 were swimning in gooey sauces.  Two of the sauces tasted identical.  Eggplant was good, but there were only few pieces and it was smothered in dark sauces.  Not sure why all are so soupy?    Reading from all the reviews here, I wonder if I went to the same Inchin's Bamboo Garden?  What's Indo-Chinese?  I went in with open mind to try new cuisine, may be Indo-Chinese isn't for me.  May try again, though.  Sunny Az"}
{"text":"What's today's lesson? Always give the ratings the benefit of the doubt.   Inchin Bamboo Garden has an average of three stars at the time of this review. After having lunch there, I say that's rather accurate.   I wish a raving review was deserving, because their menu looks wonderfully appetizing with the numerous vegetarian options. Five stars for the planning and thought that went into designing the menu. I wanted to order one of everything veggie. The descriptions were THAT good. Unfortunately the dishes were not as flavorful as their descriptions and a few of them were far too oily.   Usually my all time favorite appetizer is spring rolls. There's something about them that makes me want to snack on and on.   IBG's appetizer consisted of: 3 piece crispy spring rolls filled with mixed vegetables (no tofu) for $8. Side sauce wasn't served at first and when I requested some, a lightly sweet starchy gelatin looking sauce was brought out. Yuck! I ate the rolls plain.  There were several dirty bottled sauces on the table but I didn't dare try any of them for fear of lurking bacteria. Shouldn't restaurant workers know they're suppose to wipe down the table condiments??!  The best item: 6 piece vegetable tulips appetizer for $9.  Flaky crunchy shells filled with tangy and spicy mixed vegetables. What a knockout! They were like deconstructed spring rolls that moved on up to the east side into a deluxe apartment in the sky-high-yyy.  Also very delicious was the garnish that topped the   6 piece steamed dumplings for $10.  The hakka noodles were good, but not flavorful and I probably should have requested spicy. Hakka is a thin eggless noodle that tastes like lo mein. It came with shredded vegetables for $12.  Two items that could've been better: 1. Chili bean eggplant with onion and hot bean sauce for $12. Good, but not fantastic. Too bad they didn't drain off some of the oil. 2. Cauliflower manchurian with cilantro, onion, chili, and celery for $12. The seasonings fell flat in this dish and it relied on soy sauce for flavor. This was more oily than the eggplant and gave me a headache.   Two Disappointments: 1. Singing tangy vegetables mixed with tofu for $13. I don't know if they ran out of veggies or what because on the plate with the skewers were rice and fries. FRIES?! On the same platter as rice. Who does that? Also it sat in a pool of brown sauce. 2. Crispy chili potatoes for $9 were supposed to be tangy, spicy, potato strips with scallions. Crispy? Not. Tangy? Not. Spicy? Not.  So a firm 3 stars for IBG."}
{"text":"Inchin Bamboo, right when you walk in the doors the bars right there to your left such exquisite and  south Asian decor! I came to my first YEE tonight, service was wonderful food was awesome, nice family sized traditional plates. Drinks are amazing the menu is definitely fantastic. The food is a mix of Indian, Asian - inspired dishes like thai, Chinese etc. definitely get the Thai and Indian spice vibes which I loved of course. Started off with the appetizers really good chicken, there a spicy shrimp and the vegan and vegetarian options as wells. Everything is moderately priced as if you are in a group so definitely don't come alone and if you do come with an appetite, or I mean you can always leave with a bag of delicious leftovers! The dessert was really different but it wasn't it was very and slightly sweet if that makes sense but I loved it topped it off to a great night! So definitely if you're in the area come check it out in North Scottsdale, but for me I'll if it's a special night or I want to take my date here for a rewarding dinner of that sort, but other than that it's a very nice spot in Scottsdale! Good job guys stay hungry Phoenix."}
{"text":"I wasn't raised in the Eastern Hemisphere so i don't know what true indo-chinese food is supposed to taste like since I have no comparison. However, the stars is mainly for service. The food itself was ok at best. It was more like my mom making the brown people version of ramen noodles. The lamb the noodles came was pretty good, but it doesn't belong in noodles. The place has a hipstery feel to it which isn't big. I mainly went to eat and i wasn't impressed. Usualy give food places 5 star reviews unless the service was bad or if the food just wasn't as good as i thought it would be."}
{"text":"I have written this before, but will write it again that.. in Phoenix, an Indian restaurant would not suffer on Bad Service. An Indian restaurant will probably suffer on bad food only.   I mean all Indians loves the indo-chinese food, it is greasy, it is fried but still we love it. Inchin has a great variety for vegetarians, no problems with food at all. It is yummy. The soups and appetizers are great, the entrees are great too. I mean nobody else is serving this stuff, so of course Inchin has an edge over other Indian restaurants. The portions are big, so you would definitely pack some home for next day..   We have been here 2-3 times. One of which was the new year's eve, too many server girls moving around, we were taken to our seat as we had a reservation, the restaurant was not completely packed as yet, but this lady never returned to us with menus. The girls were just moving around in groups, just chatting away... not looking or going to customer's seats at all to ask them... whatever... I did not see any manager who would at least just tell them what was needed to be done... anyways we got our menus and ordered, the food took forever to come. Overall service is not that great, but not absolutely pathetic, so i go for 4 stars."}
{"text":"Took a chance to go here inspite of the bad reviews, and definitely didn't regret it. If you are craving for some info- Chinese food and aren't bothered by the high charge, I suggest you visit the place. Apart from that, the service was really good and the people polite. I think the bad reviews are because people were expecting American Chinese, so I suggest everyone to make their own judgement after visiting the place"}
{"text":"We ate dinner for Thanksgiving.  THe lights were so dim that we had to use the our phones to read the menu.  Food portions were large.  THe server clained it serving size is for 1-2.  She was absolutely wrong...was enough for 4-5 folks.  Bottom line is that we had ordered a lot of food based on her recommendation.  The server looked like she was high or just a ditz!"}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic.  Indochinese food is a unique type of cuisine you can't find everywhere.  The flavor profiles are interesting and complex.  Good decor and good prices.  Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Phenomenal!! Been here twice, it's about a half an hour drive from me, but IMO it's pretty worth it. I am not an expert on Indian and Chinese cuisine, but this fusion was just very flavorful and tasteful. They have this paneer cheese appetizer and it tastes so savory and the texture is perfect. It's a bit spicy, but I love the heat.   The first time I went, it was a Sunday evening and it was Soo packed and it really affected the service. It was understandable, and it looked like it was taking a toll on our server. But the food really outshined.  The second time I went was the following Tuesday, believe it or not. It was Soo much better and calmer. It was such an enjoyable experience. There was this server who brought the food out and really took his time to set the plates of food down equidistant from all other plates. It was strange, but pleasantly appreciated. The server that took our order was very friendly too and offered really great recommendations. I cannot recall the names if the dishes, but one of my favorites was a fish in a chili cream sauce.   I'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"Horrible! Worst Service! Bad Food!  It took 30mins for taking order and had to repeatedly check for the food, finally another 30mins at the end for check. Even Kids French Fries took 40mins inspite asking for a hungry kid.  Food was also not good as it was before, the quality has been ON&OFF and this time it was way OFF. In past have suggested this restaurant to my friends and even today had a friend, felt really bad for wasting his time as well.  It was very clear the staff were not good to keep track of orders placed and what had been delivered! Literally every table complained and few if I am not wrong cancelled their orders.  Hope the management takes appropriate steps to get better staff in place for making the dining worth the money and time."}
{"text":"Giving two stars only because the food was good. Not great, but good.  Pros:  Good food  Cons: Horrible service Late food. Took almost an hr to get the food.  Servers are not even bothered to ask once they take the orders  Our server took wrong order and then had to replace the food Server didn't even know how to place the food on the table(slams the plates all the time), chewing gums. No etiquette at all.  Is it worth a second visit? Only when I'm craving for a indo-Chinese food"}
{"text":"Parking - 5 stars.  We were able to find a parking spot up front.  Ambience - 2 stars.  Holy crap, they were putting silverware together at the table next to us (don't know why they didn't use the kitchen) and it was super loud.    Service - 3 stars.  They took a long time to just get our drinks and they weren't fancy drinks either.  I ordered club sofa and got regular sofa instead.   Appetizers - 5 stars.  We ordered a bunch of different appetizers and they were all very good!  Entree - 4 stars.  I would have given it 5, but they didn't have Mongolian beef so I had to settle for Mongolian chicken."}
{"text":"Soups taste like water, food is below average, place super dingy. Would never return.  Everything is fried, but it still tastes bad! Servers were very nice even though good is bad!"}
{"text":"cool idea, interesting food. Not sure it is my thing though. I will have to explore it more and update my review."}
{"text":"Since I moved to phoenix have heard quite reviews abt this place but have never been satisfied with the hospitality and ambience of the place. Food is ok..lacks presentation and novelty..it looks like a to-go place rather than dine in. Staff is rude and too busy to serve guests.  Even with food complaints they really don't bother. Overall an average place wd average food and overpriced bar ."}
{"text":"Main Points: -Unique cuisine with a great ambiance -Offers different sauces at table to customize flavors -\"Family style\" servings make it good for groups  Review: Inchin offers a wide variety of fusion Indian/Chinese food, with the focus leaning more towards Chinese cuisine.  I tried a few vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes, and all were appetizing. My group particularly liked the Crispy Lamb Peking! The ambiance was very appealing, modern Asian decor, great for a date when you're tired of the same old food/restaurant choices.  The \"burnt garlic chili fried rice\" sounded like it would be amazing, but there wasn't really much substance to it - just lightly flavored rice with a hint of chili spice.  Also some of the entrees, though they were different sauce choices, tasted almost identical if not for the different meats selected.  However, the tables come equipped with a variety of sauces, so you can customize your meal to your taste.    Definitely give this place a try, you'll be happy you did!"}
{"text":"Went to this place with a huge group of 13 people and i must say, we were served quite well. They got all our order right.  The veg  wanton soup was decent and the pan fried paneer starter was quite nice. I had the chilli garlic noodles on the waitress' suggestion and it was great. The veg coin in schezwan sauce was also lovely. Most dishes are priced $10 on an average and we got a bill of around $300 between the 13 of us which is slightly on the pricier side i guess. All in all, a great place if you are looking for some Indianized Chinese food (yes, its a thing)."}
{"text":"Food is very tasty.. Taste exactly matches with the Chinese we get in India. Indo-chinese cuisine. Desserts are awesome"}
{"text":"After initially coming here for a YEE, I've made my way back a few times.  I can honestly see why some people have an issue with the service here, but I can also see that at least of the servers are trying.  They have a designated vegan menu, you just have to ask for it, if interested.   I enjoyed their noodle dishes, but they, alone, never seem to satisfy. I always end up adding something to the dish. For example, I added the curry to the Hakka noodles and the result was delicious.   I was disappointed in the Gobi Manchurian. Every Gobi Manchurian dish that I have ever had has been a red color and full of spice. Theirs is a brown gravy, soupy dish. I did not enjoy it.  The Garlic Green Beans and Crispy Chili Potatoes are both excellent! The green beans are cooked perfectly, not too raw, not overcooked. However, it is a small portion of beans for the charge of a whopping $12! This is a $6-$8 dish, tops! Shame on them.   There are no vegan dessert options. Boo.   I agree that service can be iffy. There is one employee in particular who appears to be really trying; she puts forth an effort and it shows. Another employee, not so much.  The restaurant is hidden behind the CPK off of N Scottsdale Rd, near Shea, and cannot really be seen from the road. This may be a hinderance in attracting customers. Inside is large, warm, and spacious. They sell their sauces buy the bottle, along with some natural fruit juices. They are closed from 2:30pm-5:30pm, M-F, so sometimes they miss out on my business when I don't want to wait an hour for them to re-open."}
{"text":"Spur of the moment decision to take my elderly mom here because CPK was so busy. The emptiness of the place should have been a red flag I guess. Barkeep who kept saying he was 'new' finally seated us after several minutes. Once we had a look at the menu, we realized what they were offering was really overpriced. We decided to get a cup of chicken corn soup to share ($5 and it was literally a cup and lukewarm and very salty), some chicken spring rolls that were on their 'happy hour' special half off, and some vegetable potstickers.  The spring rolls were tasteless and despite the menu's description of fresh vegetables and chicken, they contained nothing but what tasted like day old leftover minced chicken. Horrible. The Pot Stickers were basically deep fried tortellini with spinach and onions in them. A bit more flavor than anything else we ordered, but not much.  My mom ordered an Orange soda and I ordered a gingerale. The 'new' barkeep brought my mother a short cylindrical glass of orange pop, and my gingerale in an even shorter highball glass. There was no ice, but instead a glass tumbler full of ice as he explained he wasn't sure how to 'make the drinks'.  The staff were pleasant enough, but when the bill came, we had been charged full price for the spring rolls ($9.00 for THREE) instead of the half price happy hour special we had been advised of, and my gingerale was charged as a 'sweet lassi drink' at $3.00. Total bill at this point was $36. I complained about the charges, the 'new' barkeep said we had to have ordered beer and wine to get the half off the spring rolls. (not what was said at the beginning of this ordeal). Fortunately a senior staff member came up to the cash and apologized, taking off the total charge for the gingerale and discounting the spring rolls so that the final bill was $22. He explained that the bartender/waiter was 'new' and didn't understand how to explain things properly.  We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Was here last night for dinner. 1st thing that struck me as I entered was the great decor and setting. The menu was extensive and I was very glad to see so many vegetarian options. Ordered for the wontons, chilli babycorn, vegetable gold coins in manchurian sauce and schezuan rice. Food arrived promptly and tasted amazing, something similar to chinese food back home. The portions was huge and more than sufficient for a table of 3. Only thing I could find which did not please me was that there was only waiting staff attending to over 7 tables and we had to wait a while to get the cheque."}
{"text":"Inchin catered my friend's party and it was excellent. Great rice, noodles, and curry chicken. Even the vegetarian dishes were tasty!"}
{"text":"This place totally reminds me of the Indo-Chinese food in Bombay.   The chilli paneer, Chinese bhel, chicken 65 (as per my non-veggie friends), crispy baby corn are great starters! I loved the hakka noodles and burnt garlic fried rice. The main course although tasty was spicier than what I'd expected for 3/5 level.  Great place, will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Went there on my Birthday in Feb and it's totally a disappointing experience.  We ordered items that are VERY basic for a Chinese restaurant -  1) Sweet Corn Soup               -- Good 2) Cauliflower Manchurian   -- Cold, Bland (no Spice or salt at all), felt like eating raw  3) Schezwan Fried Rice  -- Bland in spite of ordering Spicy, No Proper Salt, it's like   colored rice  I wonder how they cook other items if they cannot get even the basic stuff right!!!!!!!  I wish i could give a 0 star. Will never Visit again and will not recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"These stars are for the customer arrive I got from the manager Mr.JAy. He was extremely sweet n a wonderful guy!! Thanks for such a great service"}
{"text":"Interesting restaurant with a different take on Chinese Indian food. Paired together very nicely. The service was friendly and attentive and the food was on point. I will definitely be coming back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"I went to this place with a bunch of friends. Though overall quality of the food was not bad, Veg manchurian was little burnt. Fried rice and schezwan noodles were decent. chocolate mousse cake with ice cream was delicious.However my only complain is about terrible customer service. There was only girl that too without proper knowledge about the items on the menu."}
{"text":"Worst service!!.. Me and my friend went to the place for lunch on week day and it took forever to get our order."}
{"text":"Our family loves this new Indo-Chinese Fusion Restaurant!  One of our favorite dishes are the Mixed Hakka Noodles, Burnt Garlic Fried Rice, Crispy Paneer & their Garlic Eggplant. Their Mongolian Beef is the BEST!!  SERVICE was great! The head chef even came out to interact w/ our family. We really enjoyed our experience overall.  Definitely recommend this to a foodie like us!"}
{"text":"Ambience n service s nyc... But food is not.. Definately taste s nt even close to indo chinese"}
{"text":"Chef has changed and so has the serving staff, and the quality of the dishes has drastically declined. We loved this place for the authentic Indian Chinese fusion food, however, that has been lost with the chef leaving. I would not recommend it again."}
{"text":"Indo-Chinese cuisine is pretty popular in India especially in the South India. I've been wondering why there are so few of them here in the US when the Indian diaspora is increasingly south India. If you are expecting the American chinese or real chinese cusine, you will be very disappointed.. but if you know what Indo-Chinese tastes like.. this place is pretty close to what it should be.  Went here with a big group and tried almost everything on the Menu... loved their appetizers, and all their fired rices tasted similar. Their spice level is pretty mild and the sauces that they put on the table are very tasty. I am sure it's not the food you should be eating all the time being deep-fried and all but it's a great guilty pleasure if done once in a while.  The service was good albeit a little slow. The restaurant get packed so, having a reservation definitely helps."}
