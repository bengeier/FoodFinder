{"text":"The place is clean, smells nice, food is good, not overpriced, plus people are chill. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"I'm so sorry but I have to give a heads up to other cake lovers out there.  I'm pretty disappointed with their cakes.  Strawberry shortcake was really dry & when I bit into it, it crumbled.  Obviously the cake was a few days old, Albertsons would have thrown that 5 days ago.  So as the Napoleon cake.  The Nutella cake tastes good, a little too sweet and ... So if you're looking for a cake fix, this is not the usual bakery to go to. This is more for a specific market, since pretty much make their cakes baklava like."}
{"text":"Armenian heaven in west side of Las Vegas. Always fresh, good looking pastries,  bread and tasty lahmajoon. love this place."}
{"text":"Came because of reviews and the Yelp promo. Was going to order crepes from their menu but they don't make that anymore. Ordered eclair, Nutella truffle cake and pecan cake. Everything is dry, chewy and old taste. Don't seem fresh. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Bakery is absolutely amazing: fresh, beautiful,  delicious . I was a loyal customer for over 1 year, all my birthday, party cakes I got from there. I always advertised at my work, to my friends about their amazing deserts. But my visit ended up it all. I asked person about dairy- free product,  I have explained that person is allergic to milk based products. So she told me that packaged baklava is dairy free. I asked again, and she said it safe. I bought with additional lent products. Later I gave it to a person, and he got sick right away. Sales person shouldn't advise anything she is not aware. They used to have another lady there, and she was absolutely amazing,  caring and very knowledgeable. Unfortunately I will never recommend this place anyone.  I 'll looking for another bakery."}
{"text":"The most horrible customer service I ever received anywhere. Came in to order a cake, employee that worked there told me to wait when it was my turn while she help other customers. After is he finally get to me 15 minutes later, she did not know how much was the cake, she didn't know nothing about it, she was taking picture of it and sending it to her manager to ask for price. Than more people came in, she told me to wait AGAIN, until she help other people. I waisted good 30 minutes of my time and wasn't even able to order a came and I left. Didn't have any more patience with her. When I called back to speak with a manager, the owner answered so I was telling her about the issue, she didn't even listen , she kept telling me that lady from day before is her best employee. I can just imagine how other once are if she is the best. If you want better cake and service find a better place."}
{"text":"I came here based on a referral from a family member.  She gets her celebration cakes here and they have all been moist, delicious and not overly sweet! I enjoy my baked goods so indulged by redeeming a $5 for $10 Yelp deal.  I went over so paid an extra $5 and some change.  Pricing is reasonable.  I decided on a \"sampler\" of goodies so I tried the following:  Tiramisu cake  Brandy cake Apricot shortbread cookie Apricot crumb muffin Ponchik (Armenian donut) Meringues  I really enjoyed the first two- tiramisu was light and sweet & the brandy cake had a very nice buttercream with just hint of brandy (thankfully not overpowering).  The shortbread cookie was a bit dry as the apricot muffin was as well.  That might have been due to the hour I went...I think I went maybe an hour to close ( usually fresher in the morning, right?). The ponchiks were reminiscent of those one \"would get back home\" as my fianc√© put it (he's from Armenia- so I'll take his word for it LOL)  Also, I found the staff at the bakery to be very friendly, polite and eager to help.  That was definitely a plus.   Overall a 4/5 bc of the dryness of the cookie and muffin.  I'll update the review as I plan to give the bakery a try during a morning hour soon! I recommend trying this lovely bakery!"}
{"text":"Two words...Dessert Heaven. They offer almost every type of dessert you can think of and great customer service. I have been ordering custom cakes for every occasion from Manan Bakery and they are always delicious and always on time."}
{"text":"Ordered a custom cake for my wedding and they had great service and pricing. They were able to beautifully mirror the picture I sent to them and delivered a delicious cake on time to the venue. Response times were fast as well over email and was able to get a hold of the manager over phone very easily. I would definitely recommend using them for your next special occasion!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem the baklava is the best I have tasted in a long time and the service could not be better this is the place for pastries."}
{"text":"My first review.. I never thought that I would come up rating a place.. I've always been a user of yelp for years. I tried what other people recommend. I'm always open minded and taking chances but last night I took a chance of this place.. knowing in back of my head this place has some bad reviews that pastries are old. Anyways, after last night dinner out with the family, I decided to make a detour to check out the place. There were a few foot traffic and staff was friendly welcoming.. so I got more than a couple slices of cakes. First of the bird milk was good! And the rest was not good at all.. srry. The chocolate mousse was horrible even my 9yr.old daughter was like what is this?? Taste like nothing and old without me saying anything.. My family and I love love pastries every time we travel out of state we always yelp and look for pastries bake shops same as we go out of country. We don't expect a lot for this place but sorry to say I'm very disappointed. Hopefully they would improve freshness and moist and taste. (Chocolate cake lack of taste and moist and its old) Thank you hopefully this is helpful for both parties. God bless!"}
{"text":"Guess they bumped up the macaron prices to $1.60 a piece. Still, it's not a bad price if you grab one of their Amazon or yelp deals. Cheese piroshki and lahmajoon were pretty good too."}
{"text":"Huge mistake ordering my nephews birthday cake from manan. The whole family was disappointed on how shitty the cake turned out and definitely not what we ordered. The cake was splitting in half, cracked everywhere and when it was time to cute the cake it just feel apart. The cake was gross and just to thick. Good thing we had ice cream and cupcakes as well.(not from manan) my parents paid $135.00 for garbage. What a waste. Went straight to the trash. When I called they just made excuses. Very rude. Sam's club can do a better cake for just $20.00. Don't waste your time or money at manan bakery. They suck. You deserve no stars. My family and friends will never do business with manan."}
{"text":"This lovely place became a habit for me. They made my birthday cake. It was an amazing cake. Strawberry short cake with fresh cut strawberries.  Thank you Manan bakery for making this beautiful cake for me."}
{"text":"This is a new bakery and it is delicious!!!!! So worth the drive!! The prices are right and the owner is so nice!!! My new favorite bakery!!!!!"}
{"text":"Felt like having desserts for lunch so I placed an order for delivery from Manan and I'm pretty upset with what I've received!  I ordered 3 macarons - pistachio, almond and lavender.  I didn't receive lavender, almond was stale, pistachio was the only that was edible.  I also ordered black forest cake which was hard, old, stale and so nasty, I threw it away.  It tasted like it sat in the fridge, uncovered for days.  Now I'm left with tiramisu which I'm a little hesitant to try - just tried tiramisu and I'm really pissed off.  Are you f-ing kidding me?  I don't even know what to call it.  Worst dessert I've ever put in my mouth - old, nasty, disgusting, gross, it is a taste that makes you angry, the fact that they boxed this up and sent out for delivery, they should've been in the trash a long time ago."}
{"text":"Omg,,this bakery is my new favorite place!!! One of the best in vegas, huge selection, each desert is amazing!!! Service were absolutely high quality and everyone is friendly, & beautiful ladies!!! My favorite cakes are Omg, Chocolate ganache,,berry cake, fish tail, etc!!! Good job guys"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved our cake! Strawberry Short Cake too bad we were out of town and could not bring home with us, but it was beautiful and tasty.  Light not too sweet or heavy, and moist. Thank you Alex for getting the cake right for our special day!"}
{"text":"Yesterday i went to get some pateries and they were the best pastries i ever hadden i dont think there is anything better than manan bakery so go there now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   also the service was great beacuse the lady was expaling the asteries very well and more......................."}
{"text":"Amazing place with the best customer service!!!!yumyyyy so yummyy love your cakes very much!!!!"}
{"text":"We had Wedding celebration on February 28. I called Manan Bakery a week before the event the staff was very HELPFUL and PROFESSIONAL. They didn't have the style of cake we wanted but it wasn't a problem at all they made new style of cake as we wanted and the best part is it was very DELICIOUS! We stayed at ARIA it was delivered ON TIME! Overall EXCELLENT experience! Thank you very much Manan Bakery!"}
{"text":"I've purchased 3 dessesrts here to try and all 3 were very dry and almost tasteless. One thing i don't understand is how they are not embarrassed to display and even sell this days old stuff? That bakery will never see my money again and i will make sure to let everyone i know about it!"}
{"text":"The cookies are delicious, you can buy them by the pound.  Totally reasonable because they let you pick whatever you want so you can hit that pound.  The cakes are hit and miss though.  The service is the same.  I think the majority of their business is due to Shish Kabob next door since they don't really have a dessert to offer their customers."}
{"text":"The crapes are delicious.. However he pasties are mediocre.. I can taste that they are using too much butter.. But if you like lots of butter, than this is your place"}
{"text":"Manan did my wedding cake and it was absolutely perfect! So delicious and beautiful. Also they were so pleasant to work with and delivered right on time. And the price was quite reasonable. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I tried this little bakery in my neighborhood and found the best crispy napoleons in the region, if not the whole country. Their macaroons are a culinary revelation as well. I recommend it to everyone I know and always have it on hand if really nice people stop by. I'd only share my crispy napoleons or macaroons with the nicest and finest people, no one else is worth giving up a single bite unless they are willing to do something special for you."}
{"text":"I love this place ! Lemon bars, best macaroons and lemon bars ! And there crepes are fucking amazing. Excuse my language but it's the truth. Great prices also and beautiful cakes nice staff love it  go now like right now"}
{"text":"I was always driving by this place and finally decided to walk in. Very beautiful modern bakery with a huge display of variety of cakes. Great customer service. I took a box baklava, pound of coconut macaroons dipped in chocolate( delicious and just made, the lady was putting them in the fridge). I took also Pecan cake, kiev cake and the russian cake. They all were very good and fresh. I would definitely come back for baklava and to order a cake for my  daughters birthday couse I saw very beautifully designed cakes in the displays also."}
{"text":"Been in this place twice and so far i love every piece of cake i got with them. Their cheesecake is to die for :) hubby loves their tart aand tiramisu and my 4 yo love their assorted cookies. Great customer service too. Its my fave bakery in Vegas so far!"}
{"text":"We ordered the cake for my daughter's birthday - very bad experience. The cake looked totally different from what we paid deposit and what was promised to us. Manager (Armenian guy) was rude. Be careful when you order a cake for the special event from them. They are not reliable and responsible people."}
{"text":"OMG everything this bakery makes is soooo wonderful! I find myself coming back for their Lahmajoun and cheese puff pastry. Not to mention their sweets selection. I love their bird mil rolls and eclaires and teir fresh bread is to die for!!! Manan has really creative flavors that are perfect both sweet tooths and everyone else! Everything looks and tastes great and the packaging is super cute too:)))   I'd definitely recommend getting your hands on these treats :)"}
{"text":"Love Armenian pastries and this bakery offers a variety of them as well as famous American & Italian pastries. I will be a returning customer."}
{"text":"I have only been there one time, and the macaroons were amazing! My wife and I try many different places that have macaroons and this is easily in our top 3 if not the best... we have not tried anything else there yet though. The staff is cool."}
{"text":"I saw the sign for this little gem several times before going in one day. I was pleasantly surprised. They have a nice selection of cakes and breads at incredibly affordable prices. The desserts, admittedly I have only tried a few so far, are wonderful and not too sweet. The fresh breads are great and they have challah, which is a great  woven egg bread. The woman who takes care of the front of the store is lovely, helpful and friendly.     I recommend this to anyone looking for a good bakery on the west side. Please tell a friend. I would love to see them succeed as a small business so they will be around for a long time."}
{"text":"This place deserve 10stars not five stars. They have great costumer Service and great pastries/cookies/cakes. I go there all the time. Every thing they have is so traditional. I would recommend this place to any one who is looking for great pastries/ cakes and cookies. Great place to get birthday cake/ wedding cake and etc.....  Great place."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow Thank you so much Manan Bakery. We ordered a cake for our wedding. Perfect cake, perfect size, perfect color... pretty much everything. Outstanding customer service, very very impressed!!! Thanks again!"}
{"text":"OK.. where do I start with this place!  I drove by this place everyday for 6 years. I need to slap myself for the next 6 years!lol  Im in Love with this place..Russian & Armenian bakery kicking out dessert like no 1s bizness. Everyone was so nice here..now let me tell you I ate a variety of desserts the cheesecake is mutha effn bomb!!! This ish is like crack it sales itself. Triple or Double fudge cake is not even sweet like it looks nice & moist frosting is a lil creamy if u kno what I mean lol!!  Yelpers in Las Vegas get your A's down there & grab some desserts trust the mutha ain't no joke..on some straight gangster ish lol!!!  Thank you so much \"Irina\" for the great service blessings on your establishment!"}
{"text":"They have an amazing variety and the owner was really helpful and friendly. The quality and freshness varied a bit across the items; however, the pieces that were really fresh were delicious. I will definitely come back and try out some of the other pieces; it seems the cake slices held up better than the smaller individual miniature cakes."}
{"text":"They have such beautiful and flavorful treats here! We purchased a variety to sample. The mousse cup was fun, we tried a savory cheese type of croissant- delicious, fresh, flakey, and wonderful flavor, coffee is decent, and the raspberry shortbread cookie was perfect. We bought a loaf of the armenian bread, a fruit tart, and a baklava to go with tonights dinner/dessert.  Based on everything else... I'm sure they will not disappoint."}
{"text":"quick visit to Manan last week to satisfy a sweet tooth.  Sadly, I was let down.  Tried several items ( didn't write down the actual names so I will go with the \"Americanized\" names ) :  Brownie, chocolate cake, cheesecake and opera cake.  The brownie was very dense but lacking in chocolate flavor.  The cheesecake did not taste very fresh.  The opera cake was also old and the cake was very, very dry.  We didn't even try the chocolate cake.  The service was good - the lady that handled my order was very nice.  Unfortunately, none of the items I selected have me wanting to return.  pics included"}
{"text":"Great! Why wait in line at carlos bakery? This place is the best! Best cookies. Cakes. Very kind service."}
{"text":"Elegant pastries and very delicious cookies, for the holidays the cookies are great, they have a very wide variety  of cookies pastries and breads. Elegant and very warm establishment. Staff friendly and always smells like you would when you have a pot of coffee at home brewing"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I can't get over the rows and rows of desserts n cookies they offer. I've only tried a few of their offerings but let me tell you if there was one in LA I would be visiting on a daily basis.  Just writing about it is making me crave something sweet. Go there for their savory pastry puff filled with either meat, potatoes, or spinach!!!"}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday night, and honestly, when I walked in, I just gasped at how all the cakes and pastries looked so beautiful! But....  I really wish I didn't have to say - But.  I am no expert in Armenian dessert, but this is our take.   Kids and I got:  Chabbiet - filling too heavy and rich, too sweet. Baklava (pistachio) - hard Tiramisu - too heavy, rich Opera - gave up, didn't even try Napoleon (crispy) - alright, but also rich Fruit Tart - didn't try, but son gave it 4 stars Free coffee - freshly ground, 5 stars Free cookie - wide selection, and the one I got was hard and dry. Presentation/Looks - 5 stars.   Like another Yelper, my advice - get just 1 and taste test. If you like, then get another for another taste test. If 2 are good, then go all out."}
{"text":"4 stars for the macarons here but only 1 star for the cake items I've tried.  One of the vanilla cakes which looked so appealing tasted like it had sat there in the case for 3 days.  You can't sell people a product like that.  It's unacceptable.  Anyway, come for the macarons.  They're always fresh, thin crisp shell and soft inside, yum.  Also, priced right at about $1.25 per cookie."}
{"text":"My husband and I got married in May, and spent a week in Vegas the week of our wedding. We weren't doing any wedding thing traditionally...ceremony at a casino on the strip and reception at a different strip hotel room...food catered by a nearby Mexican restaurant...no bachelor/bachelorette party. But I was excited to find a bakery to make a wedding cake for us. I scheduled a visit to this bakery, not far from where we were staying, months in advance. When my fianc√©, at the time, and I arrived for our tasting, which we were excited for, we immediately felt awkward. They told us to sit at this small table in the corner to wait for the guy we would work with. We browsed through the booklet already at the table, getting excited and inspired, but when the worker who was to run our meeting arrived, he got right down to business, didn't even congratulate us on getting married or get excited with us about this great opportunity. No big deal. But he barely said anything to us and asked us what we wanted to try. We chose a cake to sample and he went away to grab it without a word. Immediately, we felt super uncomfortable. Maybe he thought we were looking for free samples and wouldn't make a purchase...which was wrong. I was determined to buy something if I was happy with it and someone actually tried to SELL me something. I was expecting someone to get excited with us and to give us a reason to spend hundreds of dollars for a cake, but instead, he dropped off our slice, we took a few bites, and offered to pay for the cake as we decided to leave. We had taken a 20 minute Uber for a 10 minute meeting, and left really fast. Do not come here for a wedding cake. Not sure if they get a lot of awful customers for weddings, but we were determined to be fun customers, amenable to any kind of suggestions, but they couldn't even give us that."}
{"text":"This bakery is outstanding. I've been here couple of times and each time I found something new. Starting from macaroons and the rest of their stuff are delicious( at least the ones that I've tried, I don't really remember the names sorry:)). Recently I found out they deliver and they do crepes.(OMG) We ordered crepes by the phone. The girl was very sweet and nice. I wanted sweet crepes with a lot of blueberries and ask to deliver to my house. Delivery was fast it took 35 minutes and the crepe wassss delicious. I loved it very much. Thank you guys. I will order again, next time savory crepe for sure. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, good bakery, but I expected more from this place, since I remember  the original taste of pastries, that they make. Nothing even close. For sure it's  better than american over sweetened pasries,  but nothing special,plus way overpriced!"}
{"text":"I've ordered cakes from Manan on many different occasions (birthdays, house warming, etc.) and they have never disappointed. Even after an evening of heavy eating and drinking my guests would always devour the cakes and compliment on the exceptional beauty and taste! Besides the cakes I buy a lot of bread and pastries from Manan and am yet to complain about any of their goodies. Couple the delicious goodness with warm European service and hospitality and you got a perfect little gem of a bakery!  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This is absolutely amazing bakery. Always big selection  and homemade quality. Workers are friendly and qualified. Thank you guys!!!"}
{"text":"First time here for the family. Overall, we enjoyed our treats. We got the following items: Baklava, sweetly sticky delicious. Fruited filled pastries with 3 different flavors, the pastry surrounding the fruit was flaky and buttery.  Macaroons, kids liked them. Got the passion fruit and chocolate. Chocolate Ganache, smooth, creamy goodness. Bird Milk Roll, I can taste the condensed milk and chocolate, yum. Kiev Cake, haven't eaten it yet, but I'm sure it will be great. Nutella Cake, flaky nutella goodness. Tiramisu Cake, tastes more like cheesecake with mocha, but still yum. Whole wheat bread, will make sandwiches with them. Prices are affordable. Great bakery with a wonderful display and helpful staff. I will definitely be back to try more pastries. Everything looks sooooooo good!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Ordered $100 worth of a variety of pastries.. whipped cream is solid and too rich, the cakes were dry. Mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Manan bakery has been on my radar for a while. I always pass by this place without a second thought, wondering if I would ever have the chance to stop in. Temptation had gotten a hold of me, not only when a buddy of mine recommended their macarons, but also when I saw the yelp deal.   Walking in, there are large display cases that fills the entire bakery. There is a variety of cakes, cookies, and desserts all over the place. I noticed that they also had a large assortment of middle eastern desserts available. That really perked my curiosity.  First, I redeemed my free coffee. Not \"mind blowing\" in any type of way, but serviceable. I ordered an assortment of macarons as well. Let me go on record by saying this, now I don't know if they make all their macarons in house, or if it comes from an outside source, but Manan makes some of my favorite macarons in town. The texture of the macaron is perfect, and the fillings are well balanced and light. This will be my new place to procure them.  Then, I ordered a borek with a meat filling. I've never heard of this type of pastry before, and the owner told me that it is popular in the Middle East. It tasted like a strudel, but inside was a ground meat filling. I liked the taste of the dough, it had a nice chew to it. The ground meat filling was well seasoned and tender all around. Definitely another favorite.  My least favorite item proved to be the pumpkin spice cake. I thought all the flavors were there, and that the cream cheese frosting wasn't too sweet or too runny. But the problem for me was that I thought the cake itself was kinda dry.  Manan will be my go to spot for macarons. I would also like to try some more Middle Eastern desserts as well, they were quite intriguing."}
{"text":"I tried their strawberry short cake the other day. Not very impressive, cake is watery and too sweet."}
{"text":"Sure they have black and whites to rival those at the Bagel Cafe, and their selection of fancy cake slices matches that at Patisserie Manon, but the piroshkis and bureks are only found here, on a covered tray above the pastry case. These treats are the best- flaky layers of pastry filled with your choice of potato, meat, spinach, or feta! Delicious, high quality, and oh so satisfying.   The lahmajoon \"Armenian pizza\" mentioned in other reviews is worth a try- took mine home to heat and eat, an easy lunch when paired with a  salad. Simple but solid flavors, adding Bulgarian feta kicked it up another level.  Grab a $5 for $10 Yelp deal while they're still up, you won't regret it. They have daily specials, like Monday's $1 cupcakes from noon to 5PM. If they ever have a mushroom piroshky to add to the rotation...  I might move in to the apartments next door."}
{"text":"Well, all I can say it's always great to find a place where you can get amazing sweat stuff that reminds you back home and all the good memories and taste regarding every single item in the store!! I appreciate their hard work and effort to bring this in to Vegas!!"}
{"text":"This bakery is amazing. My father-in-law recently had a birthday and I was chosen for cake duty. After trying unsuccessfully to find an ice cream cake that has been part of the family tradition for over 15 years that I have been included, I decided to try a cake from this bakery where I had previously had some of the best baklava I have ever had the opportunity to enjoy. I chose a simply chocolate cake that was decorated beautifully handmade edible chocolate flowers and chocolate pearls. The cake on the inside was perfectly cooked, moist and fluffy with the perfect amount of frosting in between each layer. After enjoying our cake, I apologized for not being able find the traditional ice cream cake to which my father-in-law replied that it was quite all right since this was far better. 10/10"}
{"text":"First time here, sooooo good, Russian, Armenian, and French bakery, all in one. Great prices, friendly service, clean store."}
{"text":"An Armenian bakery is rare - I had high hopes.  We tried Crispy Napoleon and Baklava, but to be honest, were unimpressed. The Crispy Napoleon had the nice crust, but the filling inside it was thick, dense and too much like cream cheese. Baklava was also mediocre. Especially when we've just experienced a fantastic baklava at Maza, the contrast in quality was rather stark.  My wife says 2 stars and I say 3."}
{"text":"I can't believe I found a great bakery here in vegas. They have everything. Starting from sweet stuff till crepes and breakfast. I went there with my friend the other day and tried their savory crepe with home made sauce Italian prosciutto and Swiss cheese. It was the best crepe I have ever had. I'm definitely gonna go back to try more stuf. Thank you guys for bringing nice nice gem to our town."}
{"text":"Shared a Kiss cake and lemon tart with my mom and both were very good. Neither of us like butter cream but this one tasted great. I would recommend them highly."}
{"text":"This is absolutely a 5/5 rating for this bakery. The deserts in the bakery are really good and the delivery is a huge plus. Very friendly workers, food is amazing. I am satisfied and the place itself is just great. I absolutely loved it the first time i went there and I will totally buy and order new and tasty desserts."}
{"text":"I have always passed by this place numerous times and I finally gave it a try, my oh my! Best decision I've ever made because I ended up loving everything! Especially the cookies that are like $7 for 1lbs of cookies, I was skeptical about them because I don't like hard cookies but these are the softest thing ever! As soon as I got home the cookies were gone in under 20 minutes, I kid you not.   I also bought every flavor of macarons they offer, they make it at the bakery and they are not overly sweet! I bought extra pistachios and they were probably the best ones I've had, no joke! After I finished eating everything, I was so tempted to drive back there for more.   If you're in the area or not, this place is a must try!"}
{"text":"Amazing customer services, very promptly and helpfully. I order a birthday cake to be ready for the next day. And it was!!! Plus, the design we choose was exactly. A beautiful violin and sheet music. Thank you Manan Bakery!"}
{"text":"Can't tell you how often I've driven past this plaza without giving it a second glance. Recently went to Shish Kabob House next door and saw the interior of the bakery through the glass. Curiously decided to step in and see what is inside, I was pleasantly surprised. This is a family operated Armenian bakery with delicious pastries, cakes, macarons, and BAKLAVA! Jackpot!!! Goodies that I love in one place.   Going to a good bakery usually makes me feel like a kid inside a candy shop and this is exactly what happened. There was so much I wanted to try and not enough stomach space even when sharing with others. This is the best kind of dilemma to have. My mouth is greedy but I ain't ashamed to admit!   There were many types of baklava and I tried the square pistachio baklava and the triangle baklava. I personally liked the square one more as it is more of a flaky pastry dough filled with chopped nuts like walnuts, almonds or pistachios. It is just the right amount of sweetness. The triangle baklava is a bit too sweet for my taste. It is delicious but not the best I've had. I would still eat it nonetheless. The Russian cake is great and not so sweet as well. I saved the slice of chocolate fudge cake for another day as I couldn't eat anymore, even when sharing. It is still moist and delicious even when it is a day old. Not overwhelmingly sweet or chocolatey, which I like, but given all the other yummy options I would skip this one next time.   I would recommend coming here for a try. I look forward to more baklava and trying out the other goodies in this bakery. I save quoting great words of the terminator for the rare few, \"I'll be back.\""}
{"text":"First time ordering from here online. It was pretty good. I got the house cake, chocolate cake, coconut cake and red velvet cake. My favorite was the coconut cake but the house cake was the least favorite. I would order from here again."}
{"text":"My family and I are regulars at this bakery. My boyfriend is never in town so he has macaroons ordered for me. And as far as family this is the only bakery we trust to make our cakes for any celebrations. Usually we do order them custom made however this time we went in a few days before Christmas just to pick up a cake that was already on displays. We didn't get the service we usually do because it was busy so that was understandable. However we specifically asked for any mocha cake on display. The lady gave us the mocha cake .... and well long story short when it was party time and we cut into the cake it wasn't mocha. It was vanilla. Disappointing."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I thought that it was finally time to write a review.    Their baklava was good but it was a little on the sweet side to me.  I guess I am picky as I make my own baklava. . .and their's just didn't seem to have  good balance in flavor for me which sucks. . .cuz I love to eat baklava and it's a huge long process for me to make it. . .=(  They do have this lebanese flat bread. . .which is like a tortilla with some ground lamb on it. . .that is da bomb!  I will definitely be back for that.  It was delicious.  =)  I have tried thier other sweets and really was not impressed.  And the cakes did not look all that great.  They didn't look that appetizing to me.  On the other hand their breads did look good though.  I am only saying that the appearance was good as I have never bought bread there.    But the kicker for me is that if you call yourself a BAKERY it is wrong that you are buying French Style Macarons and selling them as your own.  I was very disappointed when I saw this.  I guess I figure that if you are bakery that ALL baked good should be made in house.    Very disappointed.  I have moved and do not live close to his bakery anymore. . .so I might go back to get the lebanese bread but I don't think that I will ever drive here just for the sweets."}
{"text":"Ok so we very picky about where we eat.  Seen this bakery a few years now.  Today we tried their Tiramisu.  Omg!  Best by far.  Fluffy, gentle and a subtle hint of liquor.  Good job. : )"}
{"text":"You won't be disappointed. Amazing treats. Highly suggest. I liked the mousse cups and fruit cookies."}
{"text":"Randomly dropped by to see what they had and I am glad my girlfriend and I did! I got the taramisu cake and holy molyyyyy it was amazing! It isn't too sweet which I like. The cake was really smooth and just melted in your mouth. My girlfriend got the Nutella cake and we got her mom the pecan cake. Both cakes were good according to the both of them and Nutella cake had a nice flakey danish like texture to it and not dense. Make sure you check in on Yelp and they'll give you a free cookie! Prices range from 3-4 per slice of cake, but don't worry they're big!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The owner and her daughters lead a team of very friendly staff that are so warm and welcoming. EVERYTHING they carry is fresh - from the pastries to the savory, you must try everything on their menu. My most favorite part is they deliver, too."}
{"text":"We have used this bakery for some of our office birthday cakes and it is always amazing. They were incredibly helpful and accommodating and were able to make us a cake we needed within 3 hours. Not to mention, the cake is always delicious."}
{"text":"The best bakery on Las Vegas, no doubt !!! Everything here is so exceptional ! From the macaroons to the fruit tarts to the cakes we've tried so many things here and not a bad thing to say about any of them , everything has met our expectations plus some ! If you're looking for a bakery or something to please your sweet tooth this is definitely one of the go to spots ! They have locked down our business for good . The customer service is amazing as well everyone is so welcoming as you walk in . My daughter LOVED her birthday cake . I'm so glad I found this place !!!"}
{"text":"So far so good ! I personally did not eat it..I bought a Nutella cake for my friend for her bday ...we were in town for tears for fears this past weekend and it was her bday too...hello bday needs cake lolol....I bought a napoleon slice for my mother in la ....I drove it back and was eaten the next day my mother who is critical of everything said it was goood!!! Lolol I said it better be it was pricey. ..my bday girl friend said it was good too. Tho I didn't see her eat it ...would be back :-)"}
{"text":"Man do I love this place, simply addicted to their \"bird milk\" rolls. After buying the rolls, I let them sit and warm up to a room temperature after which I gotta say never had anything more delicious in my life. If, by any chance, I happen to stop by there before lunchtime, and, with some luck, manage to buy a roll before they go into the display fridge, they taste even better! I mean the family is more into pecan cakes and some other weird named cakes but let them leave their own review. Bird Milk rolls..."}
{"text":"The cakes are so fresh and yes so are the macaroons we had a birthday cake made from there and there also open late to which is good when you get off work"}
{"text":"First time I ordered: I ordered online from 24 hour eats. The crepe was incredible. The fruit was fresh and the nutella was on point. The strawberry short cake was dry but still okay. The fruit tart was lovey. They forgot my cheese borek so I call and they give me store credit. Fine, I can forgive that. Mistakes happen!   Second time I ordered: Looked at their website and saw that there's no delivery fee for under 5 miles. I think great! We're under 5 miles so I don't have to pay that $5. I was wrong, though. Apparently it's only free delivery if you order a cake. That's fine but they should specify that on the website. I ordered the crepe again, it wasn't as good as last time. They ran out of cheese boreks so they give me a meat borek. Fine. The two large eclairs I ordered were clearly defrosted and completely INEDIBLE. The bottoms were soggy, filled with water and the cream inside was not fresh in the slightest. Those two eclairs go in the trash. The 3 macaroons I ordered were FORGOTTEN. AGAIN. I call the store and they tell me they'll give me store credit again. Nope, I know how this works. You'll give me store credit so that I keep buying from this bakery but I'm done. Also, nothing I ordered today was palatable so I paid almost $30 for nothing.    TL;DR Don't order delivery from this place. They'll purposefully forget a part of your order and offer store credit so that you keep buying from them. Honestly, it seemed like such a cheap tactic and I didn't like their inconsistency."}
{"text":"Purchased a 10\" mocha cake recently, and I have to say it was not up to my taste buds. Some of my family members disagreed of course, but in over all the cake was pretty dry and customer service was just plain flat. They didn't bothered in helping you out to pick a cake that would meet your standards or show any professionalism.  Just a plain yes and no answer with a price here and there."}
{"text":"My friend and I came upon this place on Yelp looking for a cake for my boyfriend's birthday last minute. I was impressed with the selection of cakes and pastries they had. Service was great too. The girl who helped us was super nice and patient with us.   We got a chocolate cake for his bday and let me tell you, it was to die for! The cake was moist and perfectly sweetened, topped with Oreos and Ferrero Rocher chocolates.   We even got some sliced cakes to go as well. We got a Nutella cake, a Snickers cake, tiramisu, red velvet, and mocha cake. All great.  Definitely want to come back when I'm in Vegas again!"}
{"text":"Armenian sweets are foreign to me, but I will gladly educate myself at Manan Bakery. This is easily the most exciting and delicious new ethnic bakery to open in Las Vegas. The shelves are lined with fresh loaves of bread, savory pastries, mousse cakes, fruit tarts, baklava, cannoli, and so much more! The presentation of the desserts is on par with a high end resort pastry shop, except the prices are more affordable. I think I spotted a tarragon-flavored soda in the cooler, just for extra uniqueness points.  Several varieties of baklava tempt the senses, wrapped in phyllo, kataifi, or puff pastry made in-house. I took home a piece containing walnuts, and was surprised to discover three thin layers of puff pastry, two layers of nut filling, and a remarkably aromatic rose water soaking syrup. I also ordered a piece of House cake and a hot coffee to enjoy at one of the two tables in front of the store. The coffee was weak, but the house specialty with its towering layers of moist almond cake, chocolate mousse and orange-colored buttercream, was worth a special trip. I did a lot of pointing and asking \"what's that?\" and service was helpful and friendly. I know I'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"I walked in, saw macaroons, bought them, ate them, and LOVED them. They are so soft and flavorful. I really like their variety of little cakes and tarts, they're really cute and I can't wait to try them. Their mousse cups are also on point. The mousse is very fluffy and they come in cute little dark chocolate cups."}
{"text":"I'm so happy, now they make crepes. I ordered strawberry crepe today. It was delicious one of a kind. This guys impress me every time I go there. WOW. They are the best in town as I know. There is no single occasion without a cake from Manan Bakery."}
{"text":"After our brunch @ Rambo, we went here to try some middle eastern dessert. I only tried 3 things: Rolled baklava  Small Napoleon  And some kind of crunchy square dessert with custard inside. It also comes with syrup you drizzle on top the verdict.. I'm pretty impressed with he baklava and square thingy. It has the right crunch, nuttiness and sweetness in it. The Napoleon however is ok.  Its not like Ferrara in little Italy in NY. I'll go to the bagel cafe if I want any Napoleon fix! But for mediterranean dessert, this is the real deal!"}
{"text":"Found this gem thanks to yelp.  I was looking for a bakery with the best cake to celebrate my boyfriends bday in Vegas and this place came up with late closing hours. I checked in and received free coffee and a cookie. The cookie was so moist and the flavors we on point!  We also bought a bag of mixed chocolates to take back home and an assortment of cakes. So many cakes and cookies to pick from! Really nice staff and clean establishment. Thank you, we will return again when we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"We ordered the Russian hazelnut cake and the original Napoleon. Wow, they tasted so good. With the huge selection and affordable prices, we will definitely return."}
{"text":"Crispy Napoleon- so light, crispy and delicious! I ordered a huge assortment of pastries and cookies and promptly started on the giant box of cookies as soon as I got in my car. Sadly, these are not the kinds of cookies I like. They were all SOFT, as in like a cake soft. Cookies are supposed to be crunchy for the most part, or at least chewy, so I was very disappointed to discover that every single cookie was soft. They also didn't have much flavor and kinda all tasted the same, even the chocolate ones. And they weren't very sweet which some people prefer but I do not... I ordered 2 of each kind they had in the display and took a bite out of every kind once I was in my car, hoping to find one that was at least somewhat crispy but that was not the case. My husband doesn't eat cookies so it looks like these will all go to waste. I'm going to try to air them out and hope they will dry up in the next couple of days before they go to the trash =(   The cupcakes tasted good but were slightly on the dry side. I'm guessing because I went at the end of the week so hopefully next time I will get there on the day they were made. You also can't beat the prices. Most of the cakes and pastries were under $3 each!!"}
{"text":"I was born and raised in Glendale California, I know the Armenian culture very well, I speak the language, the music and needless to say I LOVE the food.   When a nurse that I work with told me about this bakery I was excited. Today I decided to drive down with my husband, but the 20 minute drive (so I thought) was worth the drive.   We arrived to the bakery and the gentlemen behind the counter was very nice. He asked me how I knew about the food and I explained it to him, he seemed pleasantly surprised.   I pointed out what I wanted and asked how much the Lahmajoon was.   He asked a girl in the back and she came out and gave the prices.  I continued to choose what I wanted and once I overheard the comments the chick was making about me being \"sev\", I just stood there and looked at her, waiting to interrupt in her native tongue.  The guy didn't hear her so well so he asked what he said, she looked at me and said \"hech\" as if she might have realized that I understood.  I paid, I left still more excited to have some of my favorite treats than annoyed about the stupid comments.  I get home the food was cold and the Napoleon was  rock hard and extremely stale.  I will never go back to that bakery ever again.   To the girl and her comments about me being sev AMOTA!"}
{"text":"Their products are not fresh waste of money!!! We couldnt eat all went to trash.My suggestion is dont waste your money even cost co customize cake is much better than here"}
{"text":"I was looking for birthday cake for my husband in Vegas .Seeing good reviews I ordered chocolate cake from Manan.It was not at all upto the mark .The taste  was really pale .I have had many chocolate cakes before.I had to throw the cake as nobody wanted to eat it .I really regret my decision ."}
{"text":"All the desserts in this store look so good! I wanted to try one of everything.    Then I remembered that swimsuit season is coming up and I should be dieting. Oops....so I went a little overboard today. It's nothing 500 sit-ups a day for the next 2 week won't fix. I can't believe it's taken me this long to find this gem.   Sorry, \"Jean Philippe\", you've been replaced. Patisserie Manon wins, in my book, because of the variety of pastries they have displayed and their resonable prices.  Keep in mind that there is no indoor seating and outdoor seating is limited and not very comfortable, so this is more of a get it \"ToGo\" place."}
{"text":"Simply put...you MUST have the crispy Napoleon.  Centrally located on Flamingo, it's a bakery to stop at!"}
{"text":"Went in with a Living Social deal. The presentation of cakes, cookies, and breads was overwhelming...everything looked great and the variety impressive. The customer service was top notch as the gal behind the counter was friendly, patient, and knowledgeable. Based on her suggestions, I selected a cannoli (my favorite), a slice of Russian cake, a layered tea cake (?), and a challah. All 4 were super...the pastries never even made it back to Henderson! The prices were very reasonable for the quality. I'll be back if I'm on that side of town to try some more."}
{"text":"Worth it. I tried every macaron this bakery offers. Many of the flavors I had never had before. They held their texture and form even after sitting for an hour in the car under the burning Las Vegas sun. Also tried the potato pie (perashki) which was highly filling but a bit dry at some points. The highlight of my experience was the crispy napoleon. I have no idea what it was but I have a love for crispy and flaky food...and this was in the form of a cake. Amazing."}
{"text":"Found here from yelp. Been here several times now. Their bird cake is a bit too sweet to me but the cream inside feels like eating ice cream after it melts in your mouth. Their napoleon cake is fantastic. It's crispy and you can feel like different layers composing a beautiful song inside your mouth!:) their baklava is not that sweet which is totally my favorite ! Eat with a cup of coffee! What a beautiful day beginning with sweets."}
{"text":"Great place to get birthday cakes! It was a last minutes birthday party, and Manan was the only open place around the Valley at 7:30pm. They had a cake ready for grab, which save my night. Thank you!! Taste and look were awesome!"}
{"text":"Got the chocolate fudge cake and the chocolate mousse cup......and didn't really like either.  It was not horrible but just seems to have a strange flavor.  Also, the cake was too dry or it's been sitting out too long.  A bit disappointed since I was looking forward to it."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped in after eating next door and what a treat! The display case is HUGE and full of something for everyone. There are many European delicacies that are not seen at standard run-of-the-mill bakeries. We ended up choosing the bird milk cake because she said we have never had anything like it, nutella cake, baklava, almond, pistachio, and caramel macarons.  We dove in to the bird milk cake first which is apparently made of sweetened condensed milk. Who doesn't love that? It was creamy and broke apart in my mouth similar to a tres leches without as much liquid, if that makes sense. It was quite good and I would order it again. The nutella, which was right next to the bird milk cake in the display ended up being almost the same, which I was slightly disappointed about. I could not really taste the nutella in it. The only difference really was that it was more of a mille cake with many layers.   The baklava was the best I've had! It was DELICIOUS. We got the cigar variety and they were perfectly crispy sticks filled with honey and nuts. I will definitely be back for the baklava. Lastly, they had a beautiful assortment of macarons. My least favorite would be the caramel because there was a strong coffee taste to it. I do not like coffee. My favorite was the almond. YUM! It reminds me of the way Jergens cherry almond smells. It was delicious. I will definitely be back to pick up baklava and almond macarons. Come here if you're sick of the standard bakery fare and are looking for something European. You may find a new favorite dessert. Thanks Manan. See you soon!"}
{"text":"for the first time i find this place  is awesome i have a coffee  and a cookie as a gift i like this place i will cam back for all desert and pastries  yes i loved."}
{"text":"So many selections.  We ended up getting the Napoleon, an OMG, and some French macarons.  The macarons were cheap. Price wise, not flavor.  I'd say half the price of the bakeries along the Strip, with the same amount of flavor.  The problem with a lot of local bakeries is that yes, their French macarons are cheaper, but you definitely can tell that you're getting what you pay for.  Not so here.  Their pistachio and chocolate macarons were perfect.  The Napoleon was also very delicious, as was the OMG.  The service was great.  As they have a large selection to choose from, we actually asked the girls behind the counter to help us choose what we'd get, and they were very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Best macaroons in town. But the lady at the counter had a hard time figuring out how to use my yelp offer. She almost bought another yelp offer instead of redeeming it."}
{"text":"So I've been here before and always the ladies and service is fantastic.  The pastries are good and so is the bread. I needed a cake for a friends bday. I asked for a caramel filing cake. The lady says this cake was caramel. The cake was $45. I must say I'm extremely disappointed in the cake. It's dry lackluster flavor and overall just not that good. For sure I couldn't have picked up a cake way better at the grocery store."}
{"text":"As usual, I tag along with my wife who has a sweet tooth. We just happen to be in the area so an obligatory stop was inevitable.  As you come in you see that everything is there in front of you in a wide glass case. You can see that everything is labeled along with the price. I like the fact that the nice lady behind the counter was very polite in answering all our questions.   With so much eye candy (pun intended), you can literally just close your eyes and point in any direction. What we or should I say the wifey ended up getting was a Waffle Basket ($3.49) and Cappuccino Mouse Cup ($3.49). We also was given a sample of their Napoleon which we almost got but I convinced my wife not to go overboard.   So we pay and as we start making our way out, we see that on the backwall there is a boatload of assortments of Baklava. I quickly take my wife by the hand and calmly say in a Barry White type of sexy voice, \"Next time baby\".   The taste? Well, originally we were gonna bring it home and share with other family members. Let's just say this trip to Manan never happened. Oh, that reminds me. As soon as this review is done, I need to go clean up the powdered sugar from the Napoleon off the dashboard. Hopefully none of my family members are reading this review as well. Hi mom! Love you!  In closing, it doesnt help that this place is literally a block away from our church that we go to all the time. I guess as long as im there to keep an eye on my wifey, we should be ok. Also make sure to take advantage of the 10 dollars for 5 deal.  Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #115 \"Keep calm and make sure to brush your teeth\""}
{"text":"I love this bakery!!!   Ok so this bakery is in a little shopping center. Nothing special from the outside but you open the door and you are hot with bouquet of sweet smells. And your eyes get wide by all the pretty cookies and cakes and baklava.   I have tried cookies, cakes, napoleons, baklava, twisted bred things, cheese cake, cream puffs and let me say I loved everything!!!!   First time I went here there was this older Russian lady working. I never got her name but she was soooo sweet. This time there was this young girl I think Arminian also soooo sweet. I have never had bad service. They get to you quickly to see if you are ready and if not the move on and come back to you.   The coconut cake is so good and sooo sweet it is not your normal cake. It isn't spongy it's more crispy and has 3 layers of sweet frosting. They have three different napoleons my favorite is the frites topped it has the most yummy filling. I like the pistachio baklava it's unusual in shape and big on flavor. Out of the cookies so far my favorite is the triangle one with apricot it's not sweet it's more like my grand made slightly sweet. The cream puffs taste home made and delicious. They have a fried doughnut that's filled with custard and soooo good. They also have a savory meat filled one. I noticed on the signs they make crepes too!!! They have French macaroons I suggest the coconut it's my favorite. If you aren't sure what you want ask for help and their opinion on what to get.   I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"There are so many appealing items in the case it can be overwhelming for a first time visitor to this wonderful Armenian bakery.  You should definitely try one of their excellent macaroons, available in more flavors than you can shake a stick at.  Definitely get a slice of the Bird Milk cake.  It comes in roll shape or layer cake form.  Just get both.  You won't want to share one of these.  Definitely get the Russian cake.  The Russian cake is quite dense, two people could possibly share a slice.  Get a couple Bird Milks, a slice of the Russian, and a random third slice of cake and you're going to have a damn good time.  Last week I tried the sausage lamajoon.  WOW!   The dough is impossibly tender and the perfect vehicle for the just-spicy-enough sausage filling.    As good as the cakes are here, and they are superb, I am just as excited about their savory offerings.  I can't wait to try all the other wonderful items they bake here.  Mikey C. says: Skip lunch.  Skip dinner.  Ditch your diet. Do whatever you have to do to get here.  It will be worth it.  If not for the sake of this review, but for the sake of your own piece of mind."}
{"text":"Poor customer service. I went to grab a birthday cake for my friend. I asked one of the girls upfront,her name is Anastasia about the size of the cake. I was looking for the smallest one they have because It's  for 3-4 people only. Not only she was rude when I asked but she turned to the other girl and start gossiping in different language. I picked a cake, ask for the manager's name and left. This used to be one of my favorite bakeries in town. But I guess I should stick with Jean Philippe, nothing bundt cake and Freed's."}
{"text":"I come here several times a week. I found all the best pastries here. Love this place. 5 stars for sure."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place the selection is huge didn't know what to have I had the Russian cake I was disappointed cause the cake was very dry"}
{"text":"My favorite bakery. Friendly customer service. I love the pastries here with my favorite latte."}
{"text":"While vacationing in Vegas we looked for a place for a b-day cake and found Manan Bakery. Check in got us a free cookie and a black coffee. Ordered 4 cake slices and then a canoli. If I stayed any longer I'd probably order more. Update after eating"}
{"text":"Nice while it lasted! The pastries were quite delightful (I had the Kiev cake and it was amazing and always my go to) however the girl working at the front may have been the most rude employee I have ever encountered. I understand that my rock n roll aesthetic may not appeal to your culture but she definitely did not mind swiping my Black Card. Definitely preferred the other girls that were working here before. I guess I will have to go elsewhere for my goodies."}
{"text":"I love this bakery I live close by, I came into look for a cake for my birthday. You can choose cake,filling and a frosting. I wasn't sure what Bavarian creme was so they offered me a sample of their kiss cake(yum) and I loved it, but realized that I wanted design on my cake so I opted for the fondant. I ordered my cake one week in advanced and had delivered to my home. I asked for chocolate cake with a layer of amaretto creme, I figured I would have two layers but when I cut into my cake I saw it was many layers! Which was amazing, better than I had imagined. I would definitely order anything from here again."}
{"text":"Be careful when you order a cake in here! We ordered a birthday cake in Manan Bakery using their catalog. The cake we got appeared different. I added pictures to this review so you can see yourself why I got so frustrated.  Moreover, the customer service was a disaster. For the first ten minutes lady was telling me that the  cake on the picture in the catalog and one they made looks completely the same. Then she changed strategy and told me she is not the one who took my order and basically it is not her problem. After all they asked me to pay extra and wait for an hour for them to redo the cake. I refused to pay extra and they redid the top figure. The result was even worse. So I finely gave up took the cake and left. Nobody ever apologized. By the way, the cake cost 110$"}
{"text":"Just had the last piece of my mikado cake..I WANT MORE!!!  The best place to gain some extra weight. Great customer service! The young man sure knew what he was doing. The pastry looked amazing and made me want to try every single one. The taste was just as great, best pastry place so far! Im going back and buying more!"}
{"text":"A great selection of pastries and cakes. Something for everyone. Quaint and clean and great service."}
{"text":"I ordered via Eat24 and delivery time was under an hour.  We got the creme br√ªl√©e, almond cake, dream cake and snickers cake.  They all had potential but it was obvious they were in the case too long.  They cakes were desert dry and had lost flavor.  The br√ªl√©e was ok but wouldn't order again.  Don't waste your time on this bakery as profits definitely outweigh quality."}
{"text":"OMG.  This place is amazing.  The pastries are delicious and the service is great.  These are the best pastries I've had since I was a little girl and I know about pastries.  I love the cream puffs, the kartoshka, the opera cake, the chocolate cake, and the breads.  Their wedding cakes and special occasion cakes are works of art.  I've never eaten one, but I've seen the photos and they are incredible."}
{"text":"Sweet tooth lovvvvve aawwww how sweet... Three kinds of Napoleons?  Darn I can't decide now.  Okay gimme all three.  Oh and throw in the one beside it Dulce de Leche, plus the one below that Bailey's something has chocolaaaaaaate (singing).  I needa brew coffee when I get home.  The box isn't full yet?  Alrrright!  Gimme a tiramisu and creme brulee.  YES it's all for me! (wink wink)  Your cakes are so prettyyyy I wouldn't wanna cut it.  Like if it's someone's birthday, I'd be like here's the caaaake!  :D but you guys don't eat this one, you get to eat the one from the oven with all the leftover frosting. J/K !!!  Customized cake design accepted.  Very cool.  Bring in your own design, draw one, create one, bring in a picture - whatever - the Chef will work with you.  You gotta call it in at least 5 days though.  If you're customizing I'd suggest earlier so you can discuss your specifics.  If I had to experience this I would consider a 5th star.  Not yet anyway but good to foresee.  French macarons too and all sorts of baklava.  I won't remember all the names.  There's a cream filled one comes with a syrup.  Oh myyyy yeah complete if all this is paired with a nice hot bitter mug of caffeinated coffee!"}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast with a friend.  We had hot chocolates, Madeleine, coffee Macaron, Cappuccino cup and at the end bought bread to take home.  Breakfast is the only time during summer in Las Vegas when you can seat outside before it gets too hot, so we did and really enjoyed that option.  The Madeleine was good but definitely didn't need the powder sugar they add on top of it ! The coffee macaron was very tasty, the ganache had a strong flavor of coffee, very good ! The Cappuccino cup is a mousse into a chocolate cup. The mousse is made with coffee and has the same texture like a usual chocolate French mousse. We ate it all except the chocolate cup because that was a little too much sweet.  The fridges were full of cakes; a tiramisu surrounded with Pirouline cookies, a Charlotte surrounded with lady fingers... and so much more !  Liked the sign that says :'Family is like chocolate, mostly sweet with a few nuts\" Do i have nuts in my family ? Yeah !!!!!"}
{"text":"my favorite bakery in vegas  im going to rate them 5 stars even tho i did not like the price at first i paid over 200 for this beautiful cake it was exactly how i wanted it. The taste was the best cake i have ever tried and strawberries were very fresh everyone at my daughters party complimented my cake and it finished fast."}
{"text":"Saw this while I was going east on flamingo and I saw it I yelped and saw that they had macaroons so I made a u-turn and went to it. We got coconut, strawberry, coffee, mango, and caramel macaroons. And my favorite were the caramel and strawberry!!! Coconut is definitely a MUST ALSO. Mango just had like a were taste to me.. But I definitely recommend them. If you check in on Yelp you even get a cookie and a coffee!! How great is that?"}
{"text":"Amazing! Great selection of beautiful baked goods.  We tried a few macarons and the Russian cake.  Each had wonderful flavors."}
{"text":"My first time coming here. The lady/ owner helping me gave excellent customer service from answering my question on the phone to processing my order when I came in. Was craving a chocolate cake and they had a variety to choose from. Most other bakeries closes at 6pm. Will definitely come again and try other pastries. Oh and free coffee and cookie with check in. Thank you Manan bakery! :D"}
{"text":"I ordered my friends baby shower cake here and it turned out beautiful!! The lady who took the order was so sweet and really understood what I wanted and even suggested some ideas!! The cake was delicious and tasted fresh and it didn't have that bitter after taste most bakery cakes tend to have. If you need a special order cake this is the place to go..."}
{"text":"Pastries was ok !! Rude customers service !! Never going back again !!! They need to used gloves when pickin up cake or any food !! Disgusting"}
{"text":"I went to manan bakery to have a cake made for my boyfriends birthday. They were super nice and attentive on the phone making sure they had everything that I wanted on it. I came in to pick it up and again, they were very sweet and the cake was beautiful! And huge! Not to mention that it tasted amazing. The whipped cream was perfect and the strawberries were fresh.  Even non sweet toothers in my family went back for seconds. Thank you manan bakery for making the most delicious strawberry shortcake I have ever tasted."}
{"text":"We went here to get some birthday treats for a birthday.  We were amazed at the selection!  They have everything one could think of and more. The prices were reasonable.  The display was full of colorful cakes,cookies and pastries.  They are open later to accommodate.  We'll definitely return"}
{"text":"This place is awesome if you're into trying ethnic sweets. That's my view anyways. Upon arriving I got excellent service. The lady that help me describe everything I asked about and some! They have a huge selection which is great. I'm also into trying ethnic foods, so this is a huge treat for me to be able to have such a great selection. I've been there twice already and will probably be back if I'm in the neighborhood (it's a bit far from where a live)."}
{"text":"Did I mention that this is my favorite bakery in town? Their chocolate cakes (ganache and fudge) is so sweet and tasty that I could have it everyday. I am on the verge of trying everything at least once. I should arrive at that accomplishment very soon. Hopefully."}
{"text":"Delicious sweets! My family and I enjoy stopping in and getting their pastries. I love the bird bread rolls.... Delicious!"}
{"text":"After volunteering at Opportunity Village Magical Forest, I dropped by Manan to pick up some pastries.   I was greeted moments later, but no biggie, it gave me time to peruse the so many cakes and bars Manan has to offer.  I ended up with the following; 1. maple cake - Both Earl and I are not too fond of this cake.  After two bites, we stopped eating it. 2. bird milk roll - This was delicious.  It's a balanced cake, with chocolate, condensed milk, and yellow cake. 3. Russian Hazelnut Cake - This was rich, but so good!   4. Strawberry Shortcake - Eh, nothing special.   Overall, I would definitely return for the bird milk roll and russian hazelnut cake.  I would like to try the nutella cake, and many more.  Service is quick and efficient."}
{"text":"I went to this place kind of by mistake, but it was a happy accident. They have incredible service and beautiful desserts.  I used the Yelp check-in to get a free small coffee (freshly made) and a rugelach (not my favorite, but it was well made). I ordered a piece of their Nutella cake. I think it was Nutella mousse? I ate it there and it was not too sweet and surprisingly light.  I could have gone for maybe 10% more sweetness, but it was good and I would go back."}
{"text":"The best bakery in town. I find myself here almost everyday. My favorite cakes are bird milk roll. Pecan cake. Russian cake. Friendly service."}
{"text":"I came here after buying the groupon. I was seriously shocked from the variety of goods here. Everything looked so good! Granted that I don't eat dairy, I came here to buy some sweets for some friends. They all loved it:)"}
{"text":"ETHNIC BAKERY TOUR #3-ARMENIA  We were still stuffed from our brunch at Manon, but we still popped in to have a looksee...I was surprised to see French, Italian, and Greek items here as well. The lady behind the counter was very nice and helped answer any questions we had.  We decided to try an item called Gata- baked Katafi(shredded filo dough) with a milk/cream cheese flavored filling which came with a rosewater syrup on the side. This had an interesting taste and texture, but probably not something I'd order again. I prefer crispy filo sheets rather than sredded filo which kinda tastes like biting into underbaked shredded wheat cereal.  Visit # 2 ...  Returned to Manan and they did some re-arranging...The Filo pastries are now nicely displayed off to the side and it looks like they added a few more selections...We also wanted to try a Lahmajoon, or what the lady refered to as Armenian Pizza, or Armenian Meat Pies. I would desribe it as similar to a crispy baked tortilla/flatbread topped with ground meat, onions, and spices. Not too sure of it was beef or lamb but it was pretty good. At a dollar each, its also a steal. We also tried a cinnamon-walnut flavored baklava which wasn't bad either.Looking forward to returning to try other treats in the future. I just like the fact that I can experience other cultures through their food without having to leave Vegas...ALOHA!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing Bakery. Delicious food, professional people and wonderful atmosphere. Love it."}
{"text":"I live right on flamingo and rainbow and have passed by this bakery so many times and have wondered about it. Well today after eating dinner by bf and I both wanted something sweet. I remembered the manan bakery we had passed by so many times, and since it was down the street we thought why not. I'm so glad that we went, because it's amazing!! When you walk in you are face to face with treat after treat behind the glass cases. The ladies working were very nice as well, and would tell us about each treat/cake we asked about. I settled on the Bird Milk Cake, my bf decided on the Nutella Cake and also some macaroons. We just got done eating our cakes, and we both couldn't stop making noises while we ate. It definetly pleased our sweet tooths, and we will definetly be back there for more."}
{"text":"I was really impressed with this bakery. They did a wonderful job with my daughter's birthday cake. It was very simple but they made it look beautiful. The flavors were very light and not sweet. I also recommend the macaroons"}
{"text":"I always stop in here for a sweet treat now and again and am never disappointed. I love their lemon bars and bar cookies filled with almonds and chocolate chips. I usually just buy a few of their cookies; they're light and airy and great with a cup of joe."}
{"text":"the baklava. oh lord, the baklava.  some of the best i've ever had. They have several different variations, but if you go here, you HAVE to try at least one of them.   Also, their red velvet cookies are great--moist and decadently rich"}
{"text":"Unicorns! Double rainbows! Where's the beef?! Touchdown! If you ever have a craving for sweets and are on the west side of town, do yourself a favor and stop here. There is a magical, yes magical, glass case that stretches the entire storefront that is filled to the brim with all sorts of pastries, desserts, chocolate and other fresh baked sweets. Be warned if you are in a 20 foot radius of the front door when it happens to be open the smell will draw you in like a sirens song draws in sailors. When you first walk in and that smell of fresh baked goodies hits your nose, its all over, be prepared to stuff your face. If I did not have a fear of diabetes, I am pretty sure you would find me here every day. Also, bonus points for the non judgmental, friendly and patient service when I can't decide what I want to get and spend 10 minutes drooling before i decide what I want to purchase."}
{"text":"I think it's the best bakery in Las Vegas , They have all Russian deserts that you can't find anywhere else, Everything is delicious and fresh , they have a big variety , you can always find something that you crave for , the only Thing that bothers me is the price , the prices are too high , it's very expensive , I think they over exaggerate ."}
{"text":"######1111111 they have the best cakes in Las Vegas very recommend this place to anyone who have parties and more  Grate customer service......... will be back again"}
{"text":"Cute, clean Mediterranean bakery with lots of options for your sweet tooth!  Got a $5 for $10 Livingsocial deal for my sweet cravings. I got 2 different types of baklava, 4 macaroons $1.39 each, a couple of sweet roll thingies, a chocolate biscotti, and a poppy seed croissant. I really like the presentation of the baked items, each was made beautifully. Some tasted delicious, a few tasted like flour and powdery. The baklava could use a bit more honey.   The lady at the counter was very nice and helpful. I will probably come back to try some of the other items, after I workout at the gym first for a couple of hours."}
{"text":"I can't believe just how amazing the goodies are at this place. The butter cookies were out of this world. They reminded me of my childhood - making cookies from scratch with my mom. The flavor is so intense. I don't get instant gratification from treats often. The Nutella cake was crispy and had just the right bits of everything. The raisin bread was fresh and delicious too. I can't wait to eat everything. It has taken me years to find a bakery like this."}
{"text":"Love this bakery! One word \"TIRAMISU!\"  They serve it in these cute little individual cups and dare I say it.... It's like S*X in you mouth! Lol. I swear it's the greatest thing I've ever had! They also have these cappuccino cups that are really good and everything is made to perfection. The red velvet cake is amazingly not dry and that seems to be impossible to find on any cost. I am a little spoiled from previously living in the south where it seems the only good red velvet cake is made but they have managed to please even my critical taste buds. There's so many delicious treats, too many to name!"}
{"text":"We buying our cakes and bakery stuff from this place last five years.  Quality remain unsurpassed and taste is better everyday we get our stuff. Owner and the staff very friendly and helpful. They carry so much variety to list on and everything they make is pretty fresh and natural. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Needed a birthday cake for 2 people. I saw a beautiful cake at the website so I stopped in late afternoon a Saturday. There were many pretty pastries in the case and a few decorated cakes waiting to be picked up. I picked the Very Berry cake and asked for the usual happy birthday writing.  I returned on Sunday and my expectations were exceeded. The website doesn't do the cake justice. Gorgeous fresh fruit (including currants!) topped the cake as well as leaves made made from chocolate and gold foil! A banner made from white chocolate topped the cake with the birthday greeting.  The birthday girls and all of the attendees were blown away. And taste-wise... The lightest cake I've ever had. So good!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down best bakery in Las Vegas. I always order my favorite Russian cake and quality is amazing and delicious . Really friendly staff and super welcoming. Love them"}
{"text":"I read some of the Yelp reviews and had Manan Bakery bookmarked for a couple of months,  Yesterday, I stopped in as I was coming back home.  The bakery is a small shop with two cases, but they are filled with delicious looking goodies.  There were many things with names I didn't recognize.  I asked the woman what some of those things were and she was happy to explain.  Instead of going with some of the newer things, I opted for two tried and true bakery goods--a chocolate mousse and a raspberry mousse.  I had the raspberry last night and it was excellent.  The light chocolate exterior that surrounds the mousse is very delicate and very tasty.  Chocolate and raspberry go so well together.  I noticed several items in the cases I'd like to try in the future, so I will  be back."}
{"text":"Thanks again everyone at Manan Bakery for the great customer service you never dissapoint. You are my one stop for anything sweet and delicious. All my orders always on time and fresh keep up the good work. Im a fan for life!"}
{"text":"This review is solely on their customer service. I was looking to purchase a cake for my nephew and wanted to ask for their pricing so I had a particular cake in mind. I felt as if the lady explaining it to me was a bit rude because I was asking a few questions. She felt so inconvenience that she had to explain it to me as if it's a freaking math question I can't get. Even the guy in there just stared at me rudely, no greeting whatsoever upon my arrival which is really awkward because they just stared at you. I was so turned off at the service that I just told them no thank you and didn't buy a single pastry which I planned of doing. There are other pastry places out there which are a lot nicer."}
{"text":"I want this store to be closed. Really good bye diet honestly!!! I am so use to this kind of pastry when I was growing up I just can't stop myself. Since a friend told me about this place I have been going there almost every day. I promise myself to just buy one and leave but all those beautifully made cakes scream my name and end up buying more. There baklava is one of the best in town. And there cookies is a delight to all. No worries vegans they also do vegan pastry upon order even when i am fating they can do the damage So I conclude this place should be closed bc it ain't helping me loose 30 pounds of excess fat."}
{"text":"We called ahead to verify that they had a chocolate mousse cake before we went and they confirmed they did and held the cake with our name on it. When we walked in we were so excited to see such pretty treats and decided to purchase more than just the cake! After going from display to display with my 7 yr old daughter she tells me on the last display with the macaroons, \"mommy, I need to use a bathroom\". Anyone with a child knows that when you hear these words they are mostly like in dire need because they've been holding it already for goodness knows how long! I apologize and ask if they have a bathroom she can use really fast and they say \"no\". I can honestly say I beg a little because I can see on my daughters face she has indeed been holding it.   Now, I get not having a \"public bathroom\" but we're spending money in your store and she's only 7. There were no other customers in the store. Just us and Anastasia who then chatted with some other woman employee who looked so embarrassed. Anastasia didn't budge and we left without buying the cake or any additional treats.   Where has kindness gone? Understanding. Compassion. Customer service. Not anywhere in this store to be found that's for sure. That's a fun thing to explain to a 7 year old. Sad.  I'll take my money to better customer service."}
{"text":"The cake was delicious and beautiful!!!!! Thanks to all bakery members!!! I will come back for more!!!!!"}
{"text":"Plus for delivery.  Ordered cannoli tiramisu napoleon eclair cannoli good tiramisu fair napoleon on and eclair not so good.  The eclair was overdone dry on the outside because of it and the cream was not smooth abit lumpy with no flavor.  The tiramisu obviously took sometime but it wasnt anything to write about. All in all I would go back to try other things but wouldn't order what I did today   Went again and everything was amazing!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Have tried quite a few of their items with my husband since we have a bit of a sweet tooth and they have for the most part been quite good.   However, the main reason I am writing this review is due to their awesome service recently. I currently live in Oregon, but wanted to send my mom something for her birthday. Being that she loves sweets too, I looked around for bakeries that deliver to her work.   Manan was one of the few places that would deliver to North Las Vegas. Anyway, I called them and spoke to a woman who gave me suggestions on what the most popular items were to send to my mom, and I followed most of her recommendations. I paid over the phone, but she sent me an electronic receipt by text which was great. Then, they texted me a link so that you can track the driver as he delivers the goods. So nice to see that a business is up to date on technology.   Anywho, my mom got a delivery of Russian cake, creme br√ªl√©e, tiramisu, chocolate ganache cake, and I'm forgetting the last two items. She said they were all great and was very happy with the present. Thanks for such great service and delicious baked goods Manan Bakery!"}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh pastries. Super nice staff. I had a lot of questions and the cashier took her time to explain desserts and wasnt bothered by it. They have a huge selection of bakery items, cakes, cookies, parfaits, tarts, bread, croissants, cannolis, etc The inside is bright and airy and clean.  The macaroons are amazing and reasonably priced at 1.79!! They have the perfect chewy texture, and fillings are potent and actually taste like the macarron flavor . The Armenian cake was full of vanilla flavor and moist. Fruit tart was cilled with ripe and sweet fruit, and the shortbread crust was buttery. The strawberry cake slice was a light and airy with just a hint of sweetness, super moist cake. Prices are very reasonable for portion size and quality. I will be back to try more!"}
{"text":"I was craving cannolis so bad so I googled \"best selling cannolis in the valley\" and Carlos Bakery was the first thing that popped up. I tried Carlos Bakery when I was in Hoboken, so I wanted to try something new so this was next on the list.   I ordered cannolis, a Napoleon cake, and a strawberry shortcake. The cannolis weren't the best though. The filling was really dense and it just made me really thirsty. I like Carlos cannolis better. Manan did have a better Napoleon cake though! The cream was really fluffy and the icing top wasn't too sweet like at Carlos. That's a plus at this shop.   The line wasn't ridiculous so I was in and out real quick. When you do a check in, you get a free cookie and black coffee. They do have cream and sugar on a station across the counter where you order from.   Overall it was pretty good. I probably would go back to try the other desserts if I'm within the area."}
{"text":"You have to try this place. Amazing!! We love the tiramisu, eclaires, cupcakes and everything really. The girl at the counter was really sweet and patient. We couldn't decide what to order! We will come back for sure!!"}
{"text":"So many choices!!!!! Fresh and delicious. We chose 3 different items and each had its own unique texture and flavour.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Wonderful selection of goodies and great service! The wonderful woman working the counter even gave my kiddos some free goodies. I'm not sure what's in the Fantazia or the Dream Cake, but ehrmergerd!! It's soooo amazing. We also had the coconut snowball and it was airy and perfectly sweet. This is definitely my go-to spot when I've got some feelings to eat."}
{"text":"Free cookie and free coffee is the only reason why theres two stars. The cookie we choose tasted good. Not so sure how i feel about black coffee. Customer service was kinda crappy. I asked the girl for how much macaroons would fit in different size boxes. However, she kept saying 40 even with the small sizes. Wtf? 40??? In a box the size of my hand would be 40? And both workers left me hanging while they were running around doing something else. There was no lines, no customers other than myself, a few workers, i only ordered like ten macaroons, a creme brule and a cookie. This shouldn't have taken 40 minutes. Especially since everything was premade in the front. Im just standing there waiting for absolutely nothing. I should have just walked out after 20 mins. -.- idky i bothered to wait such a long arse time for them go walk around, go to the back and disappear for like 20 mins.  At the end of the day, its about the food. The creme brule sugar was over burnt, the cookie was good. And all of their macaroons taste HORRIBLE. Super over sugared."}
{"text":"Came to Vegas to celebrate my friends 30th birthday. They were awesome enough to accept my order even tho I only ordered a day in advance. Also the delivery guy was patient and kept in contact with me. The cake was freaking delicious!!!!! My only problem was....my cake was lopsided :( I was very sad about this. The cake was beautiful in every way minus the cake being crooked :("}
{"text":"Amazing place.  Armenian pizza and all those pastries.  Really nice,  clean,  friendly atmosphere. If you spend $300.00 you get a $20 gift certificate... with all of the delicious goodies I don't  see a problem getting to the $300.00. Call ahead to order."}
{"text":"Best in town the lady's that work there are always nice and the baked goods are delicious and the baklava yes they have baklava is the best I ever had"}
{"text":"Starting from the lahmajun and finishing with the fruit tarts. Manan Bakery has everything.  The sweetest bakery i have been too. I used to work next door and would always run in for a treat after work. My favorite is the birdmilk cake. Even now i always find myself  going back to Manan Bakery with friends and family for my sweet tooth. They designed my friends daughters one month birthday with a beautiful traditional vanilla strawberry cake that just melted in your mouth. Thanks Manan Bakery, i'll be seeing you guys real soon."}
{"text":"Came in for the first time and ordered my Girlfriend this cake for her birthday. Not only I was taking care of promptly but how delicious the cake was and how everyone enjoyed it! Thanks to the wonderful staff, I would definitely recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"I bought 10 peaces of different cake. When I got home and was about to eat with my family it's was not edible. Cakes wore hard as a rock and old at least 10 days. 40$ went in to the trash. Do not go here!!!!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best cake shops in town. When it comes to birthday or special occasion I would always buy the red velvet cake, I received lot of compliments from my guest. Their French macaroons is my top favorite and last week just tried their Kiev cake,it is amazing and totally love it! Tiramisu is delicious as well as the chocolate cake. I'll be back for more especially this holiday season. Staff are also nice and very helpful."}
{"text":"Met group of friends for lunch at Shish Kabob and arrived early so walked into the bakery just to check them out - walked out with a box.  The 2 young gals behind the counter were very friendly and helpful explaining what some of the items were.  They have a large variety of goodies ranging from cookies, breads, and cakes.  I ate some of my goodies last night with hot tea and everything was delicious.  Am eating the rest right now w/coffee and am very surprised that everything is still moist!  I will definitely return!  Too bad they don't have the space to set up small cafe with coffee and tea."}
{"text":"A bakery full of all types of goodies. I got a medley of cakes (a total of four) and there were some highlights, and some that I wasn't too fond of. I highly recommend the vegas cake. There's a yummy, crunchy meringue in between the sponge, and tastes amazing. However, I wasn't too fond of the roll cake, snickers cake, black forest, and the napoleon (which is my all time fave pastry/cake) as it was soggy, almost as though it had been a few days too old.   Service was a bit slow as they are busy, but they were nice and friendly.  I'll definitely come back for the vegas cake!"}
{"text":"Manan made us an awesome wedding cake. It doesnt just look good but it tastes great too. The cake is moist. We ordered a 2 tier cake with vanilla and chocolate ganache and chocolate with vanilla filling. Thank you."}
{"text":"Best best best best!!!!!  Love their cakes and amazing desserts!  Not too sweet, which is the best part!  The decorative art and care they take on the details is so appreciated!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  The desserts are not overly sweet and the staff is friendly. This is my daughters favorite bakery!  She craves their mousse cup all the time!"}
{"text":"Every item in this bakery is DELICIOUS! We have tried every bakery on the west side of town and no one compares.  For many years now we have regularly stopped in to get a box of goodies to take home.  We also use them for every special occasion, their cakes are superb and their baklava is probably better than my greek grandmothers but I would never tell."}
{"text":"When looking at pictures of pastries from Manan it's difficult to understand a bad review but trust me, you don't want to waste your sweets craving on going here. I came here a while ago and completely forgot that I've been here when I went back recently, that's never a good sign.  My co-worker and I came on a Saturday and got some treats. Out of 4 deserts purchased (3 by me and 1 by her) none were fresh. The pastries tasted like they've been in the display case for about a week. Really sad considering that during our visit there was consistent foot traffic.  Needless to say, I learned my lesson: do not buy more than one until you've sampled the product.... UGH!"}
{"text":"Was craving sweets and dropped by this place to grab some. They had many options to choose from and I went with macaroons, cream puffs, and tiramisu. I wanted more, but I know I can't finish all these sweets by myself. Hehe. It's a cute small bakery. Their macaroons was good! I thought it would be hard and tough to eat but it was soft and flavorful. The cream puffs were good as well, my little doggie wanted some while I was eating it at home. I would come back to try other sweets here."}
{"text":"after driving past this bakery for weeks,  finally decided to give them a shot. Had to order cupcakes for a baby shower and the ladies were so helpful and sweet while helping me decide. Needless to say, the cupcakes were beautiful and a HUGE success. Love that this bakery is located very near to my home and will 100% recommend this place to everyone I know!"}
{"text":"Finally a bakery in Las Vegas that is worth going out of the way for.  There are plenty of sweets on offer, but I cannot comment since I did not try.  The breads were excellent."}
{"text":"I had a friend who found this bakery online and they delivered a birthday cake to me. The best cake I've had in my light. Moist, not overly rich or sweet. Seriously amazing."}
{"text":"Beautiful tasty treats! I want to give 5 stars for how good their desserts are but have to minus a star for unfriendly staff."}
{"text":"I really like this bakery huge selection,of cakes all sorts of macaroons and great baklava"}
{"text":"There was a time when I was really happy with this place Because they had fresh bread; I didn't mind the price even though it was in the pricier side but then I ordered the Lahmajoon-Armenian pizza and OMG!  that was overpriced! 15 for $23. Like really?! And the sad part is that they where greedy with the meat (practically no meat) on the Lahmajoon. Noticed more and more stuff are honestly overpriced. Come on Guys at Manan Bakery get realistic/Fare with your prices!"}
{"text":"Experience:  I was ordering some lunch for delivery on Eat24 for some friends, when I noticed a new bakery available for delivery. I thought it would be a nice treat to have some baked goods for after lunch.   Service:  the delivery time was about an hour, which is what they advertised. I live in a high rise and was a little disappointed when the delivery chic called me and asked me to come down.  I told her she needed to come up, because I paid for delivery and tipped already. Then she came up without argument.   Food:  I ordered the following items...   1. Coconut cake - very good, but a little sweet.  I prefer the lighter whipped cream frosting versus the thick, sweet buttercream frosting, but this was still good.    2. Baklava - they sent the honey on the side, but I tried it without the sauce and then later with the sauce soaked in. It was good, but not the best I've ever eaten. I guess it's not a fair judgement though, because I did spend 4 years in the Middle East.    3. Honey Almond cake - this was my fav of all of these choices. It was light, not too sweet and had almonds on it.    4. Cream puff - the pastry was dry (versus soggy like others are) and the cream filling good. If you are not big on super sweet sweets, this is a good pick for you.    5. Fruit tart - this was very close for first place fav. I love the crunchy cookie tart the pudding and fruit was in.  The fruit was a little sweet with the glaze, but it also provided some tartness from the berries and tangerines to counter. I really enjoyed this.    6. Manan cake - this was such a beautifully decorated cake.  It had white chocolate shavings on top died in various pastel colors. This cake had the whipped cream topping I would have loved on the coconut cake. My only issue was the actual cake was chocolate, which I don't like.   Overall:  each piece was like a work of art. It definitely pleased the visual side of my hunger. Most were delicious, but all were at least good.  I will definitely order again, and look forward to stopping in someday too."}
{"text":"This 4/5 rating is as high as it is specifically because of their amazing baklava. I have to say that everything else I tried either simply wasn't my style or seemed sub-par. But I can promise you that the baklava was on point. Now you should know that they offer baklava in three forms - in a roll, cut into a triangles and cut into squares. We tried the latter. It comes with a syrup that is meant to be poured on top. We didn't bother using that because it tasted so amazing just on its own.   I also enjoyed the \"cookie\" I tried. I put it in quotations because it's really more of a cookie bar - it has a pie crust and your choice of three different toppings. I went with the chocolate chips. There was a solid layer of those chips that were then covered with what I guess might be a baked layer of condensed milk. Pretty unique and yummy.   The other two items we tried were based on the girl at the counters suggestion, both apparently are their most popular. I wasn't much for either. Mostly because they were cakes with very little icing and I am an icing girl. If cake with little icing is your thing, I'm sure you'd love them.   Lastly, there was a Snickers Bar that was totally catching my eye. Unfortunately, it was pretty disappointing. There were layers of cake, a peanut butter buttercream and a meringue, all topped with caramel and peanuts. Sounds fantastic, right? Well, it failed mostly due to the fact that the cake was dry to the point of being crunchy. And the caramel and peanuts on top? Completely flavorless. Not sweet, not salty. Not anything. I have to say that the layers of buttercream and meringue were absolutely delicious! But is it work $4 and picking apart the layers? No.   I would definitely give this place another shot. I'd get that baklava again. But maybe try one of those chocolate mousses instead of anything cake-based."}
{"text":"Too many goodies to choose from! It offers ready made cakes and desserts but also offers custom cake ordering. I love the macaroon craze, and this place has quite a few varieties to choose from. My personal favorites are the coffee, mango, and coconut! I've also ordered a whole rum cake from here which was soo intoxicating! There's also free coffee, which is mild but strong on Mondays, but I also prefer the cappuccino. I recommend"}
{"text":"Super bakery, its got the real authentic Middle Eastern breads and pastries. 5 star all the way. The real deal."}
{"text":"Since I was in Vegas for vacay I was craving a good cannoli and this was on the way to my destination.  Nice bakery with a beautiful display with a huge selection of baked goods.  I ordered a cannoli and a golden key (a meringue type of dessert).  The cannoli only came in with the chocolate coated shell (I'm not a chocolate fan).  The ricotta filling was too sweet so it was disappointing.  The meringue cookie was good tho!  I'm a big fan of French macaroons and anything meringue.  It was a super size version of a macaron with a hazelnut/coffee flavored buttercream filling.  The girl that helped me was friendly. She placed my 2 selections in a nice box.  Next time you're in this area check out this bakery  as they have offer a huge selection which will probably satisfy your craving."}
{"text":"My imagination became a reality just in seconds by ordering a cake from manan bakery. The best cakes, the best deserts, the best sweets that you can think of, Manan has it all. Its always good to know that you will never be disappointed. Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"Got a birthday cake for my executive assistant here last week. It was a strawberry shortcake adorned with fresh strawberries with cream frosting and chocolate. It looked very impressive and it was the hit of the office that day. Light and moist sponge and very delicious.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"I had an expiring LivingSocial coupon so we ordered a slice of mocha cake (dry - 2 stars), tea cup chocolate mousse (so smooth - 3.5 stars) and chocolate ganache (chocolate yummyness - 5 stars) to go.   Based on our last 2 visits, I will never again order a pre sliced piece of cake from them."}
{"text":"We love here because we are impressed with the selection of baked goods. The staff is very friendly and kind. I didn't know what should I order the cake because they've lots of cakes and cookies and macarons also. Then she told me which is the best and her favorite.  So far my favorite is their cookies and macarons, Russian cake is great too. And if we using Yelp check-in, they give us delicious coffee and one free yummy cookie too;)  Anyway if this shop is close to my house, I'm going to be there everyday for sure.... Morning and after work...  dangerous!! But I'm already looking forward to go there in this week:0"}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed with my order & more so the level of customer service. Number one the cake on the left is clearly not the cake I requested on right. The world map bottom layer was specifically requested for my twenty year vow renewal as my husband and I are world travelers so the Cake spoke to our lifestyle. Instead I get a Cake with foil slapped on and lopsided with the top layer sinking in. I paid extra for delivery to ensure cake arrived unharmed. Well the delivery driver will only leave at door and not carry up to venue.  Had I known this I wouldn't have paid for the delivery. The owner didn't give a damn and only said she'd refund me the $30 delivery fee and nothing else to compensate for the misrepresentation of the cake. I'll never use them again."}
{"text":"Service is always good and their raspberry cookies are amazing. I mean I love all pastries I ever buy from them but I can never leave without the raspberry cookies and if they have their m&m cookies. These cookies melt in your mouth... Never had anything like it! Love coming here and getting my sweet fix. Make sure to give them your number for rewards!"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm within this area, I never let a chance go by without coming to this bakery. Each time, I grab something different because they always have something new in store..... That's on top of their already wide variety of sweets. Staff is very friendly and place is clean. Just not a spot to sit down and eat or hangout with friends. I personally think that some of their goods are a bit pricey but overall, the experience is still worth it. I'd come back over and over to satisfy my sweet tooth."}
{"text":"There is not a single occasion or event, that I don't order from Manan Bakery! Not only they have amazingly tasty pastry but they are always very eager to customize your order and outdo your expectations. It's a great place for all those who want to satisfy their sweet tooth."}
{"text":"Todos sus postres se ven y est√°n deliciosos el lugar y ambiente es muy relajado todo muy limpio y organizado, muy buen servicio."}
{"text":"I love this place, the cookies are fresh and delicious they bake everything in there. In my work they beg me for these cookies :) Also I see they have cakes and other things the prices are so good too."}
{"text":"Dessert heaven is beyond Manan Bakery's doors.  I live down the street, and that's dangerous as hell. Everything I've tried was delicious and was never disappointed.   Favorite of all time is the cr√®me brule. They take it to the back and torch the sugar. So much YAS. 5/5 stars  Tiramisu (cup and slice) - 4.5/5 stars  Bird Milk Cake - 3.5/5 stars  Kiss Me cake - 3.5/5  Fruit tart - 4/5  Madeleine - 5/5 (Get one free with coffee when you check in!!) Cappuccino Mousse . 3/5  Russian Brownie - 3/5 Cannoli - 4/5 Cannoli cake - 4/5 Berry Cheesecake - 4/5  Baklava - 4/5  Red Velvet - 3/5  I've gotten a birthday cake here for people and received one myself. Always great and beautifully prepared. Fancy smancy.   I like to come here for desserts to-go. Not many seats here and it's out side. 2 small tables maybe. It's a grab and go type of deal. The girls are always really helpful and patient too. Ask away if you have questions. Love it.   I'm a regular for sure. You might be one too once you try it!  DON'T FORGET TO CHECK IN FOR THAT FREE COOKIE AND COFFEE!"}
{"text":"No stars  This bakery is terrible. We went there to order B-day cakes for our girls birthday and while we were ordering we decided to have pastries. It took about 30 to 45 minutes to place the order for 2 6 inch cakes it cost $65 each cake. Ok , no problem. We gave them a month notice.  So the pastries we got we decided to take home and eat for dessert that night. OMG I have to tell you they were horrible tasteless and you could tell they were old not fresh at all. By the way $53 in pastries  All of it went in the trash.  So instead of canceling our cake order we said lets see how they could do with cake. Well another disappointment the cakes were very nice looking the way we ordered them with all the decor we asked for then when we tried them it was terrible my kids didn't like it either. No flavor. They went in The trash Instead of going back and complaining we just look at it as lesson learned. Beware people get a sample before you go here and spend you good hard earned money. I know I will not be going back."}
{"text":"So glad I found this place, I'm from California and needed a wedding cake in 4 days (Vegas wedding)I wasn't expecting much until my cake arrived and I was in Ahhh...the cake was BEAUTIFUL and delicious.Red velvet cake with ivory colored butter cream frosting was perfect! They even added fresh flowers to match the color scheme of my wedding party,we were so happy.I'll definitely be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"For right now I'm giving just an average rating as the only reason I come here is for their bread. I live close by so it's convenient.  They do offer a wide variety of ethnic desserts. (which I haven't tried)  Friendly staff.  I will be updating the review once I try some of the desserts."}
{"text":"Presentation was beautiful! Everything was still cold and not melted and gross. Everything tasted wonderful."}
{"text":"Greatttt. This place is a block from my house. My worst nightmare. Bye bikini body 2016"}
{"text":"This is the place where you can get the real deserts for any occasion. Taste amazing, look great and very friendly and helpful staff. Thank you guys keep it up!!!"}
{"text":"This has been on my list for a long while. I moved around all over Los Angeles, but a good chunk of my upbringing was in the Los Feliz/Glendale area which is a Armenian heavy area. I love the food and the sweets so I was excited to be able to get goodies like from home. If you haven't had Armenian treats, they're rather heavy on having layers,cream/custard, nuts/nut flavored cream, honey as components. Their offerings are wide though and have many usual kinds of cake too- shortcake, tiramisu, fruit tarts, etc so don't discount them simply as a ethnic bakery as their selection is wide.   I came with Sarah-Marie V. after dinner a few shops down.   One of my goals was to find this cake I used to eat as a kid that my aunt used to always get. She always just called it \"honey crumb cake\" which is pretty general, but if you look at Armenian pastries, lots have crumb or crush nuts on it which makes it even harder to identify this \"crumb cake\" among them.   I chose a honey cake as I felt that was the obvious choice first and she got bird milk cake to eat here, and we also took treats to take home as well. My honey cake reminds me of a napoleon and the layers were a cross between phyllo and graham cracker in texture with the layers and some nice honey flavored cream. She loved the bird milk and I should have gotten one for home as I took a bite and liked it.   At home I brought home this chocolate cream layered thing which was decent. I got the Russian cake based on the girl saying it was one of her favorites, and it was also on my list of possible \"honey crumb cake\". So when I took a bite of this Russian cake - this flavor is definitely the cake I was looking for! The texture is slightly different as the one I used to get had crisp layers, but this was it as I started looking around on Google.  To top things off, the prices are reasonable with most treats being around $3 and on top of that, they often have Yelp/livingsocial/groupon type deals.   I most definitely will be back now that I know where to get this cake! I think I need to order a whole one!"}
{"text":"This place is 2 doors down from where I get my nails done and I have visited several times now to warrant an updated review. They have been consistently good with their sweet offerings but I have yet to give their savory side another try. The people are always so nice and pleasant to deal with, on one of the stops, I asked the lady what was the deal with the sign: Yelp hates us! And she laughed and said it was a JOKE. I LOL'ed more because she was so amused by it. Personally I thought it was an odd joke and obviously other yelpers thought so too coz I saw a review where someone was offended by it. To each his own I guess. I will continue to support this local business because of their quality despite the weird sense of humor hahaha."}
{"text":"Just left this bakery...lots of goodies to choose from. Everything looked great and smelled delicious throughout. Reasonably priced. Friendly employees, snicker cake was ok. Coffee made fresh to order!"}
{"text":"Good stuff here and lots of variety at a fair price...awesome cream puff.   I felt the owner was nice and helped explain what items were.  Perhaps a couple of tables set up inside (as opposed to the one table exclusively reserved to discuss custom cake orders) would allow you to dine inside and allow you to enjoy a coffee etc...but maybe they aren't looking to clean tables and allow you to eat on the premises.  I got a coffee from my yelp sign in, but they forgot to make it, and I already had my food so I just left w/o the brew, but yeah, sign in through yelp and grab your free coffee.  I would come back and try more things here...had a coconut snowball, a chocolate mousse in an edible dark chocolate cup and cream puff...all excellent."}
{"text":"My new favorite place. Absolutely amazing. Everything is so fresh and delicious. Selection of baked goods is great. You can definitely find something that you will love.... So far I tried some cakes and I loved what I tried. There is great selection of cookies to try next time. Stuff is very friendly and helpful. Even though the place is kinda far but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Been here twice.  The first time was prior to closing since I was going to eat at Shish Kabob House and saw the bakery sign and just had to go in, because I love sweets and baked goods.  This is not the best bakery I've been to.  It seems average priced.    - red velvet cake: light and tasty, I actually enjoyed this a little bit more after refrigerating it since the cake was more dense.  Got this on both occasions. - macaroons: just not good flavor or texture.  I wouldn't even really recommend these :X  (Patisserie Manon in Summerlin has some pretty tasty macs) - creme brulee: not my favorite.  I'm biased in part bc I make a pretty mean creme brulee.  But what I didn't like about this was that there was no crispy sugar topping...perhaps because the dessert sits in the display case?  And like I said, I bought this treat before closing.   - Perot(?): not memorable enough for me to describe it to you  The ladies that work there are very friendly and helpful when asked to described the desserts.  The cookies look pretty good so I'd try those next.  Tip: Buy the Yelp deal, $5 for $10!  Totally worth it.  Didn't get the Yelp deal my first visit and spent ~$10 that time, then used the deal the second time.  Definitely not the tastiest bakery in town, IMO.  Servers are nice.  I would only go back to this place if I was in the area or with the deal."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best bakeries in Las Vegas. I appreciate the great quality of baked goods and the selection of bakery items for sale in their display case. I also don't appreciate the selection and quality because there is way too much greatness to select from!   The service received on recent visits from Megan were stellar. Manan bakery needs to employ more friendly and outgoing staff like her."}
{"text":"Everything here looked so delicious!  My friends and I were looking for a cake place nearby and found this place since it was nearby.  The lady who helped us was very sweet and helpful.  My friends and I were eyeing the strawberry cake.  We were told it was the strawberry shortcake.  So we went with that deal.  I had checked in and noticed there was a $5 off deal.  We bought that deal and even scored some candles on the house.  What a sweet lady.  The cake was a good deal also, probably because we were in Vegas?  Don't know, don't care.  In all, my friends and I were happy with our selection :)  I'd give this place 4.5 stars, but too bad I can't give a half.  Rounded up since we got a deal and some free candles lol"}
{"text":"Manan Bakery is one of those hidden gems.   I had seen it before, but hadn't really registered that it was more than a cake shop.   My fella and I decided to stop up for breakfast one morning this weekend, and I was really impressed. They were missing a handful of items, namely, the Armenian meat pie that I desperately wanted to try...they weren't quite ready when we got there.  Had we not been in a hurry, we would have waited and tried one.  Next time.  Even with a few things not being ready though, they had a huge selection of cakes, cupcakes, mousse, biscotti, and more.  I chose a Nutella cake (of course I did.) with chocolate covered hazelnuts on top.  My fella tried the baklava and a small pastry with apricot inside.    We also got a couple coffees:  I got a free cappuccino (with Yelp check in: one time only) which was tasty, considering it comes from one of those machines that does several coffee drinks in one.  My fella got a Mediterranean medium roast coffee.  The guy who helped us described it as Mediterranean espresso.  It was VERY strong, but delicious.  We put one creamer and a couple sugar packets in it to mellow it out a little bit, and enjoyed it.   So...the food was delicious.  Its so hard to find good baklava in town, and Manan has GOOD baklava.  They have several different varieties, so I can't wait to try the others. The Nutella cake was light, sweet, and airy.  It was really delicious.   The smaller pastry that we got was good too.  Flaky crust, and sweet fruit spread inside.   Everyone was very nice, and we were able to sit outside at a little table to enjoy the cool air, before it turned into a ridiculously hot day.    I like this bakery.  I like supporting local shops, especially when they have a quality product.  Next time, I'm trying the cheesecake, and plan to buy a loaf or two of their fresh bread!  Until next time, Manan!"}
{"text":"Amazing bakery in Las Vegas , usually go there to grab a breakfast and their Danishes are so yummy and fresh . You have to go and eat there"}
{"text":"Items Selected:  Red Velvet Cupcake Pistachio and Almond Macaron Crispy Napoleon Baklava Dream Cake - Walnut, Graham, Pastry Cream Bird Milk Roll - Condensed Milk, Chocolate, Yellow Cake  Described as an Armenian bakery by the lovely woman behind the counter, an encyclopedic knowledge of the country's baked goods along with those from Greece and Turkey, a Saturday afternoon visit at Manan Bakery would prove to be a rarity for me - a case of baked goods with more mystery than familiarity, and a delicious bit of education served in seven courses for a mere $14 after tax and a tip for such pleasant and patient service as I inquired about the origin, concept, and constituents of no less than a dozen items.  Playing on instincts and personal tastes but more than happy to allow the clerk to guide my hand it was with a few \"standards\" that I began and with the cupcake moist and dense beneath light buttercream while the baklava arrived crisp and intensely sweet the 'familiar' products would only get better from there, the macarons my pick for most Parisian-authentic in the city as a crisp bite gave way to a light crumb and filling that was ever slightly too thick, but nicely flavored and richly textured like that of Laduree at nearly half the price.  Moving on to more novel options, it was with personal interest and love for mille feuille that I ordered Manan's \"crispy version\" and with crisp layers divided by light cream before being rolled in fluffy icing and crunchy coconut-tinged flakes the Napoleon was not a bit soggy, just light, lovely, and perhaps the best non-traditional version I've experienced to date; an impetus for a later return to check out the 'standard' version which I'd venture to be equally delicious, particularly with seasonal fruits incorporated in the cream.  Focusing last on the two \"must try\" items suggested by my server, it was with the bird milk roll that I began and although good I personally found the cake to be a bit dry, my tastes instead trending toward the appropriately named \"dream cake\" whose Napoleon like crunchy layers of graham were divided by a lacquer of thick, nutty milk-jam while buttery crumble and light pastry cream added just enough levity to reign in the intense sweetness - a perfect complement to a good cup of coffee later that evening and something I'll absolutely return for soon, along with the Gata, Yojik, Manan Cake, Kartoshka, and Mikado...maybe the Smiling Cake, Nutella Napoleon, and Fruit Cookies as well."}
{"text":"Cake is good :) Nice customer service :) Reasonable price :) The only thing I don't like, the lady who help me hold the sample pizza (I think) without any gloves after she took my money :("}
{"text":"Great lahmajun and sweets. We order over the phone and it was ready when they said it would be. Clean, affordable and great taste."}
{"text":"This place is simply amazing, from their Paklava to the Laajouhn's to the ponchiks. Prices are on par with other Armenian bakeries outside of Glendale, CA.   Just wish the Crispy Napoleon was a bit more...crispy."}
{"text":"The BEST bakery in town. Everytime I go there I just want to buy more and more sweets.  This is the only bakery in town that offers the freshest and best pasties and cakes.  Im going to ask them to make my birthday cake this time."}
{"text":"Found this amazing bakery when looking for a place to buy Challah bread, and I am glad I did!  You can really tell this is a family owned bakery the moment you walk in. The warm and friendly service is the first thing you experience as you walk in the door, but it is really its pastries and other yummy treats that will have you coming back again and again. I am certainly a fan!"}
{"text":"Bought a birthday cake for my father and it was phenomenal to say the least! It was beautiful, delicious and well worth the price. I cannot wait to try their other delicious goodies that they have. Ive also been told the have lamajoun (armenian pizza) and xatchapuri (ajarsky). I really hope that's true because I plan on ordering some this weekend. The 2 young ladies in the front are sweet hearts."}
{"text":"I've been able to visit Manan Bakery twice now, and I feel it's a pretty decent bakery if you're looking for sweets in Vegas. They specialize in wedding cakes, but their storefront has a ton of baked goods that you can peruse. I believe they are an Armenian bakery and have items such as bird's milk roll, baklava, and napoleon cake.   I was actually browsing through Yelp to try to find macarons. Even though Manan does sell macarons, I would suggest going to Patisserie Manon for macarons and coming here for cakes, etc. They're located on Flamingo Road with a parking lot out front. Workers are not the friendliest, and can make you feel like you are wasting their time as you decide what you want to order.   They have a ton of individual baked good items for sale - most were pretty decent.  Macaron: I tried their salted caramel macaron, and for the price of $1.79, I felt like it was pretty good. Flavor was on-point, but nothing too special about it. I ended up forgoing the macarons on my second visit and trying out new items instead.   Napoleon (crispy): They have a variety of napoleon cakes here, but I opted to try their crispy version. I liked that it was super crispy and not too sweet, but it was a tad bit dry; however, I could taste the custard and layers of flakiness in that cake - which I really enjoyed. At about $4, I thought it was a decent price to pay.   Heaven roll: For $3.79, I thought this was a relatively decent price, but I wasn't a fan of the heaven roll at all. Out of all the desserts that we tried, this was the biggest let-down because of how dry it was. There wasn't much flavor and each bite just tasted stale.   Bird's milk cake: $3.49 - after Karina's, it's hard to find another place that can compare. And unfortunately Manan's couldn't either. The cake was definitely sweet, but it didn't melt in my mouth - instead, it also tasted a bit stale. Don't think I'd try this again.   Baklava: The best thing that night was the baklava - they sell this by the pound, but I only opted for one piece at $2.99/each. A great deal for how amazing this tasted. I haven't had good baklava since my friend ordered some from back home and had it delivered to New Mexico. This was amazing - crispy, tasty, fluffy - everything you could want in a baklava. It was hard not to scarf down the entire thing.   If you check in on Yelp, you also get a complimentary cookie and coffee. She said the cookie was nothing too special - tasty and simple.    tl;dr - Some desserts were a miss, but I did find some good baklava from here, which was a treat. If I'm in the area, I think I will definitely return to get some more baklava - I'll pass on everything else."}
{"text":"The cakes and cookies I got from here were good and the place had a great vibe. The prices were a little more than other specialty bakeries I've been to. I wish I could say that the service was great but it wasn't which is why I am only rating this place 3 stars, which may I point out is average, not a bad rating overall.    That being said there was a lot that annoyed me from that experience. To begin with the place had 2 people behind the counter and only 1 set of customers prior to us. One young lady said she would be with us in a moment but we needed a little time to review the menu. When we were ready the other person, I think was a manager or owner, started to attend us but literally in the middle of us ordering she answered the ringing phone without so much as an \"excuse me.\" She then walks away from us and leaves our half filled order on the counter.  We waited for maybe 5 mins before the other young lady came to finish our box of items. I said something out loud while waiting so I imagine this is what got her attention.  So we found this place through Google maps and I was unaware of the Yelp check-in offer until I got to the cash register and saw they had a note posted on their tip jar about it. So I went ahead and checked in. I showed the offer to the young lady and she even acknowledged it BEFORE she redeemed it herself. After having paid for my cookies, coffee, and slice of cake she said she'd get me my free coffee and cookie momentarily as other customers started flooding in.   So I look at my receipt and didn't even see free items on there so not only did I pay my full order which included a cookie and a coffee, which she could've just used the credit towards, now I had to wait again for her to help others while my order is still incomplete. I sit down and have the coffee we already ordered and even finished my cake...still no cookie or 2nd cup of coffee or cookie (there was 2 of us and each wanted our own but ended up having to share). I made eye contact with her twice and asked her for my items after patiently waiting but she said she'd be with us in a moment. We finally just left...  I doubt I'll be going here again."}
{"text":"I like to bring my friends and family here when they visit for the chocolate cappuccino  cup the people working here aren't very personable and there's no where to sit inside which sucks... But my family likes it ..."}
{"text":"The best place for cakes and cookies! Billion of varieties! You will not find a place better than this one! Their cakes are so delicious! This place you have to visit 100%. Clean and friendly staff :)"}
{"text":"Delightful, looking forward to trying all their desserts. Had the kiss me cake today. Yum, fresh raspberries and not too sweet. One thing that kind of turned us off from the place was the \"yelp hates us\" sign they have at the register. We actually left the first time we visited this place because of that sign. Why? Well, I am a yelper and it is sort of an attack on people who take the time to give a review. I was surprised that they weren't hated on yelp and actually have good reviews... so now I am confused... maybe they are out of touch? I'll be going here again and hopefully as time goes by they will better identify with their costumers as well as their yelpers."}
{"text":"This place is Awesome you guys! Best place for delicious cakes! If you have a sweet tooth then you musttt mustt try Manan Bakery ! 10 starts from me!"}
{"text":"Best chocolate cake I have ever had. I ordered through eat 24 too (delivery is a plus since I'm lazy lol)."}
{"text":"You really can't go wrong here. Make sure to ask the lady what her favorites are and she'll steer you in the right direction. She may not be able to describe what the dessert is made of, so she'll give you a sample to try. I don't want to embarrass myself by listing all the stuff I tried, but the things you should absolutely get: 1- Baklava - so cinnamon-y and the best I've probably had 2- Dream/Honey cake - the best thing they have...I'm sure of it. 3- Chocolate ganache - so rich and yummy 4- Spinach Perashki - puff pastry filled with spinach. This is awesome served warm. Don't go for the potato perashki...I got this but within two bites, it sucked any moisture out of my mouth and I just couldn't go on.  This place is awesome and deserves all 5 stars! Plus, the prices are very fair."}
{"text":"This place has the best treats ever. I bought a piece of the Nutella cake and it was flaky, crispy, sweet and delicious. It paired really well with the free coffee I got just for checking in! Also easily the best free coffee I've had in awhile.   The real draw of this place are the incredible macaroons. They are a nice mix of smooshy and crisp. I get them everytime I am in the area."}
{"text":"Been going for years price on birthday cakes have always been reasonable now they are over charging I'm very disappointed"}
{"text":"Amazing cookies and pirozhkix bred and coffee. they have a great customer service as.well."}
{"text":"They have so many different kinds of pastries (macarons, cake rolls, baklava etc) and even some middle eastern breads. The cashier was very nice."}
{"text":"We ordered my son's cake from Manan. I am sooo glad i did it. We dont like american style cakes, and we dont like dry cakes.  I brought few photos with me and they made exactly what i wanted. The price was cheaper than american custom cakes bakeries .  We got a 2 tier Micky Mouse cake- 1 tier was Strawberry short cake - it was yum, the bottom was Russian cake. It tastes sooo good. The best cake I had so far. The cake was 8\" and 10\" and it was big and heavy. Great quality, dont waste your time with american bakery that will offer you dry and super sweet and sugary cake.  A++++ Manan"}
{"text":"Delicious desserts.  Delicious desserts. Delicious desserts.  Nice people running a small bakery next to a great Mediterranean place."}
{"text":"Carb addicts, unite! Manan Bakery has been a bookmark for so long that I forgot about it until I was looking for some baklava to celebrate National Baklava Day today, November 17th.  I always try to celebrate any major holidays that involve sugar or eating, in general.  I dropped by last night and walked into a bakery that offers five different types of baklava, not to mention cases full of other sugary goodness.  Cakes, cookies, macarons, pastries galore can be found here.  I bought the five different types of baklava they had, the traditional, a pistachio flower-looking one, a rectangular one with a walnut on top, and two different rolled baklavas.  I tasted three of them and shared the rest with my co-workers today and the consensus was a collective thumbs-up.  If you love baklava, try Manan's.  If you've never had baklava, you should also try Manan's and see what you've been missing. Use your Yelp check-in for a free coffee and cookie, too.   Located on Flamingo near Torrey Pines, Manan Bakery definitely deserves another visit or three."}
{"text":"Got the tiramisu cake and everyone said it was the best cake they have ever tasted! It was so light and delicious, we wish we didn't live out of town so we could try more of their expansive selection!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Fantastic customer service. Outstanding cakes. I was looking for a place to deliver cakes to our office staff for birthdays. They have got our business!!  Most of our business has been through Yelp and eat 24 online ordering but I needed to check out in person. So I went to order in person and found a beautiful clean bakery with an amazing selection of sweets. I ordered another great cake and brought some treats home for the family. Manan cake and cr√®me br√ªl√©e yumm!!"}

{"text":"My husband and I were craving macarons but didn't feel like going to sambalatte so what did we do? Look for places on yelp, duh lol. Manan bakery came up and their macarons looked pretty good compared to others so we hit the road. Once we got there I instantly started to drool! I mean their display case is just filled with tons of goodies! When I saw the macarons I started to feel suspicious about the place. Why? Because they look EXACTLY like the macarons at sambalatte! Bought 8 of them to see if they were the same and well to satisfy our cravings. We also needed a cake for Easter and they had some really cute ones. there were chocolate mousse cakes and chocolate caramel. Of course we got chocolate caramel for those who were wondering. Service was friendly don't have any complains there. Anyways back to the macarons...tell me why it is the same EXACT macarons from sambalatte!!!! Now I can't help but wonder who gets it from who! Either way I'd go to Manan since they sell it a couple cents cheaper. As for the chocolate caramel cake it wasn't too sweet but it was flavorful except for the caramel part. The Carmel had no flavor and was just straight icing which wasn't what I expected."}
{"text":"Pros: great dessert and pastries  Cons: the worker ladies look like they DO NOT want to be working  Loved the variety of desserts they offer here and their cakes are sooo beautiful! I will definitely be picking up my friends bday cakes from here. We checked in and got a free pastry and the not so happy to be working lady gave us a free coffee to go along with it. Everything was great minus the lady seemed very annoyed when we asked her anything about the origins of the pasties.  Keep up the recipies but maybe work on that customer service!"}
{"text":"VARY RUDE! and Unprofessional! Which is vary disappointing, because I planned my appointment time a week in advance and came all the way from Los Angles. I arrived 10min prior to my appointment and they refused to help me and said that my appointment was for an earlier time. The cashier had to go to the back and tell the Manager that I was there and the cashier came back telling me can't help me and start to blame me that it's my fault for missing my appointment. I find the manager to be a COWAD for not telling me personally and had to tell one of their workers to tell me that. What a waste of my time!!! Will just do business some where else!!!"}
{"text":"I am soooooo satisfied! We found them online before we traveled from the Napa valley area. It was my 21st Birthday and I wanted a very special cake I showed my mom what I wanted and she ordered a beautiful cake! I was so satisfied with the customer service! The owner is amazing. My cake was delivered to the restaurant we had reservations at! Not only was the cake beautiful but it was soooooo delicious! The bottom layer was red velvet with cream cheese filling and the top layer was champagne cake with strawberry filling. Cake was so moist and yummy! I will order from them for the next birthday or special event I spend in Las Vegas! They are the absolute best!!! I was so nervous to order from them since I'm not a local but they seriously did an amazing job and I have 0 complaints!!! You guys made my 21st Birthday extremely special and memorable."}
{"text":"Manan Bakery is Amazing! They even half a Yelp check in offer for a free home brewed coffee and a cookie of your choice. The staff girls are so sweet and eager to please! A friend of mine bought a beautiful fruit cream cake to my Thanksgiving day feast shin dig and it was the talk of the night. I visited the store and bought a slice of strawberry shortcake and a bavarian napoleon dessert. Mmmmmm yum yes, a very sweet pleasure for my taste buds! The store is adorable and you could pretty much order anything your heart desires. They have a full bakery of fresh desserts, pastries, and coffee. The only problem you will have is deciding on which mouth orgasm you would like to buy. The dessert cases are full of Awesome treats! I will be ordering cakes and stopping by for a quick ready to go treat again very soon!"}
{"text":"Stopped by after dinner...So glad I did! My family and I tried the fruit tart, Russian cake and berry cake. All were amazingly good! The only thing that was horrible was the watered down coffee...Other than that I was a happy customer!!"}
{"text":"This is the BEST bakery in town no doubt. I've tried countless bakery's out with their desserts and bread but none of them come close to Manan Bakery! Their Macaroons are amazing, they just melt in your mouth. All birthday cakes for all my family and relatives are bought from here. They are perfectionists! They make exactly what you ask for and have it ready when you need it. Their bread is amazing. I stop just for bread about once a week and it's always fresh and amazing! And last but not least their Lamajun... it is the best I've ever had. Beats every place here and even in California. The staff is amazing and is always very welcoming. Thank you Manan Bakery."}

{"text":"We needed a cake for my aunt's birthday. I Yelped $ bakeries and came across Manan. We headed over and upon walking in my husband and I looked at each other and realized we had walked into an Armenian bakery! It was like being back in SoCal.   They have ponchiks and piroshkis here which are a  made of the same fried dough. The sweet ponchik is like a donut and can comes filled with custard or chocolate and topped with powdered sugar. The savory piroshki is more oval and filled with meat or potatoes. Being an Armenian bakery they also had lahmajoun which is like an Armenian flatbread. My husband was a little hungry so he ordered a lahmajoun while I perused the cakes. It was served cold... I prefer it warmed up and served with a slice of lemon.  We selected a Strawberry Short Cake which was super airy, light, fluffy and not too sweet. I would totally get another cake here again! I've been thinking about that strawberry shortcake for days!  When we got to my aunt's house we saw that they had piroshkis and ponchiks from Manan. I tried them all (for the purpose of this review... ya! That's why. Not because I'm a fatass) The ponchik was good, the potato piroshki was good too, but the meat one wasn't authentic. They had created a lahmajoun piroshki by just stuffing lahmajun meat in there. I guess that could be cool, but I didn't like it. Lahmajun meat is for lahmajoun! Maybe if I was mentally prepared to bite into a lahmajoun piroshki I would have liked it better?  The service was quick and I loved the variety of things you can buy here from pastries to nuts! Yup... nuts!"}
{"text":"The desserts/pastries are pretty good and the delivery service is a plus. They put some serious effort into the tiramisu, the eclairs are generously stuffed but the cakes... I am nowhere near as happy with them.   The cake was dry, the inside of the fondant was gummy and the filling was whipped cream instead of the lemon filling I had ordered. The cake was for my Great Aunts 80th birthday and it was the most disappointing food item and, unfortunately, the one thing everyone was waiting to have a piece of. All cake left overs were thrown in the trash after I listened to my aunt tell me how much she disliked it.    I hate to say it but I won't be ordering from this bakery again. Even if it was a mistake, this was kind of an important day so the let down was impactful."}
