{"text":"Really enjoyed most of the dishes here except for the pad Thai. I can't explain it, the pad Thai was so blah and wouldn't ever order it again.  The curries are really good though.  Only other comment is that the price is way too high for the portion sizes."}
{"text":"The food quality has gone downhill. For the price you pay, the size of an entree is not that big. Few pieces of chicken in my entree that costed $18. Have tasted better coconut rice elsewhere."}
{"text":"Seems like they slipped a little in quality. Our food was just OK overall - vegetables were overcooked, and the duck curry was a bit bland, too oily and mostly sauce."}
{"text":"I have dined at Chili Club Thai House for the past couple of years and have always enjoyed the quality of the food. The portion size, however, has always been a point of contention for us. Let me reiterate, the food is tasty. The value for money leaves a bitter taste in your mouth, though. On Friday evening, we ordered take out for the first time. When my wife paid and picked up the order, she seriously was looking for a second bag to our order. It was ridiculous, it was a paper bag comprised of four orders of coconut rice and accompanying four entrees. When we arrived at our destination, we were dumbfounded upon seeing the contents of our order. The entrees were literally in the size equivalent of small plastic margarine containers. We were incredulous; cocunut rice devoid of coconut flavour and tasty entrees that amounted to about five tablespoons each. I am cognizant it is Thai food in an overpriced restaurant market, but really, how much is rice, cocunut milk, and vegetables? The topic of conversation during and after dinner was how dissatisfied we were with the portion size, we were all still hungry. We will certainly not be ordering again from Chili Club. A true heartbreak."}
{"text":"Very good food if you like spice, however their pricing is highway robbery!  Seriously--$24 for a small portion of crying tiger?!!! 2/3 locations have closed down and this last one is soon to go if they don't adjust either their pricing or serving sizes.  This place could be a #1 hit if the owner started paying attention to feedback.  Great food, terribly expensive, and the WORST, most rude service when you call for take out or reservations. The owner needs to walk a bit down the street to the Himalaya restaurant and take some notes!"}
{"text":"Yes, it's priced on the higher side - although not as pricey as the crap hold called Ruan Thai - but definitely worth it.
Again, it;s hard going to a retaurant that serves food for 150 times what you pay in Thailand itself, but whatever. I don't think I'd make most of these items at home.
We ordered out, and ordered too much food for the 3 of us.
We started with the Som Tum, a papaya salad with prawns, not bad, but needed more fish sauce. Then we had the Coconut soup which was amazing, and spicy enough to cause my eyes to water after the first bite (I was fine after the first 2 minutes). 
Then the pad thai, again, mediocre, which I find in most Thai places, yet it's one of the most common and seemingly easiest dishes to make. The noodles stuck together and didn't have enough peanuts or other ingredients to make it really great.
Then there was the Crying Tiger marinated beef. It was less spicy thatn I had anticipated, but as good as well.
The highlight of the meal, the Panang Duck Curry. Oh my god! Oh my! Amazing. Duck is fatty, and therefore tasty, and the eggplant was so amazing, I would've eaten it alone. It was so spicy, yet didn't take away from the flavor of the food. You know when it's so spicy you can't taste anything anymore, and you end up just shoveling it down quickly to get it over with, with a glass of milk to help.
If you eat here, I absolutely recommend this dish. Next time I go, I'm ordering two, and not sharing."}
{"text":"I came to this place based on a high recommendation from a friend and I must say it did not live up to the hype. The food wasn't awful but at the same time wasn't anything to write home about. We ordered two of their most famous dishes, \"crying tiger\" and house noodle dish. Neither fish was great, and lacked flavor. Again, this wasn't awful food but I would never choose to go here again. On the plus side, the service wasn't too bad and the complimentary ice cream they give you at the end of your meal is delicious. The prices and food portions are both decent, not great, but decent. Overall just a very average restaurant."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai place, my wife and I went there once every two months at least.
The place is small, and busy. Make sure you have a reservation.
The appetizers are exceptional. The lettuce wrap, stuffed chicken wings, calamari, Tom Yum Soup ... all GOOD!
Mains are also delicious, we usually order a curry dish, duck or veg,  and a fried rice, after finishing 3 appetizers and soup.
The ice cream after the meal is a very nice touch.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have ordering from this place for years, and yes while it is on the pricey side it is delicious and worth the money! We love spicy food and have dined in and done take out MANY times. The outside looks like a dive and there is not alot of parking (you can park at the McDonalds) but inside is small and quaint. The service has always been good and we have taken others here for meals when they come in from out of town. The only thing I would caution is pop refills are NOT free (the pop portions are on the small side and usually have a lot of ice). The portions seem small but my BF and I usually do 3 dishes plus rice and have enough for 1 person to have leftovers the next day.

We have tried almost everything on the menu but our favorites are:
Green Papaya salad (very spicy),
Masamun Beef Curry, Sya Rong Hai (Crying tiger),
Panang Duck Curry,
Moo Dad Diao (Pork),
Swimming Rama (Chicken), Gai Bhed Med Ma Maung (Chicken), Kaeng Kheir Wan Gau Tua (Chicken)
Kao Mun (Coconut Rice)"}
{"text":"A good example of why I love small restaurants.

This is what I would call \"honest\" Thai food. Pricing is reasonable. If you want to pay more, you can find higher end fancier places that cost more. My son and I were stuffed with an appetizer we shared, two main dishes, and rice, plus tea for $68, including tip.

Good value, in my mind. And the food appears to be prepared and served by people who care about your experience.

It's kind of like visiting your Thai friend for supper.

I'll be back."}
{"text":"Once I entered the restaurant, I forgot about it being in the basement of the strip mall plaza. It was simply decorated and dimly lit for a nice atmosphere. One notable difference is that I heard no typical elevator asian music. 
Started with the fish cakes and they were about as good as I imagine they might be. For the main course I had beef massumun curry, and ginger chicken with asparagus. The curry was fantastic! No pieces of fat, and just a delicious overall flavour. This dish was rated 2 out of 3 chili's for heat but for me I think I'll have to go 3 next time. The ginger chicken with asparagus was a real treat and reminded me of a more authentic Thai dish (from my travels). 
So great food and a decent environment and I will go again for sure. The prices are a little more than a few other Thai restaurants I know but not by a lot. The quality of the food justifies it though."}
{"text":"After reading Sylvie C's review of this place I was excited to re-visit this place.  I had take out from the restaurant awhile ago and remembered it being really good.

I was there with a friend recently and I have to admit I was a little disappointed with the place.  First impression when I walked in was a nice little place.  There are about 15-20 tables with nice d√©cor and ambiance.

We were seated immediately and ordered the following dishes:
* Pad Thai
* Steamed Halibut with Coconut Sauce
* Asparagus and mushrooms with lemongrass and garlic
* Chicken with basil

Pad thai was good but I have had better.  4 dishes was just nice for 2 hungry ladies.  I was satisfyingly satisfied at the end of the meal.  One noteworthy dish was the awesome coconut ice cream desert that was served at the end of the meal.  

The dinner was good.  Not as good as I remember it to be but it was above average.  I love my spice and the chili numbering system in the menu was not very accurate for my tolerance of spice (the ones with 3 chili's supposedly 'blow your head off' spicy was just okay for me).

Would I go back?  For the price, I would probably choose to go somewhere different.  That being said I might have to go back one more time to try my yardstick dish, Tom Yum soup.  Everything I have tried so far was good but not fabulous."}
{"text":"After reading some of the reviews we decided we would try this restaurant.  We were sadly disappointed.  We ordered the Pad Thai and the House Special.  The Pad Thai was a poor imitation of the real thing with 90% noodles, maybe 4 shrimp and 3 small cubes of chicken.  It was hard to find a vegetable.  The Chili Club special was equally disappointing and rather bland.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Outstanding meal.  Visited as a pregame meal for 7pm Flames game. Service was excellent and the Entrees were amazing. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"My friends and I frequent Chili Club fairly often, it's one of our favorite go-to restaurants. It is a small restaurant, so you have to make reservations on the weekend or you'll never get in. The service is always attentive, though food takes a bit longer to come out on weekends. I always get the Swimming Rama (Peanut sauce, spinach, chicken. Yum! Can't go wrong), Pad Thai and their coconut rice. The food is always very flavorful, and I love the complimentary coconut ice cream and fresh fruit at the end of the meal. It's a nice touch. I definitely recommend this place. Yes, it's a bit on the pricey side, but it's a nice treat every once in a while."}
{"text":"Treated my family here for my dad's birthday.  We had A LOT of food...ordered like 10 dishes... curries...pad thai..fried rice...papaya salad.. a little bit of everything.  All the food was delectable!   Full of flavor and coconutty goodness!  We started with 5 bowls of coconut rice but ended up ordering 5 more..because it was so good.

My brother in law brought a homemade cake and they were very nice about it and surprised my dad with the cake with candles + sparklers and everything!  Not many restaurants allow people to bring in their own cake.  They also gave us complimentary mango coconut ice cream to celebrate my dad's birthday.  I was very pleased.   Highly recommend coming here.  Great ambiance for date night as well."}
{"text":"The worst Thai food in town. I've had better Thai food at the Chinook mall !!
They don't even butterfly their shrimp, they like to leave the poop vein inside.
As far as I'm concerned thats as lazy as it gets. Slice the back of the shrimp with a knife and take the poop out. 
Very quick and simple technique to make Shrimp taste 10 times better.....especially this far from the ocean."}
{"text":"It deserves 5 stars.  We usually get take out as it's a little cozy.   Every time we go back it is the same high quality experience."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Thai restaurant in Calgary. I've eaten here 6 times... last night would have made it 7 but I forgot to make reservations (Friday nights are just madness here).

Tip #1: Make reservations at least 2 days ahead. They are busy regularly, so if you want to dine here with no fuss, just call ahead :)

My favourite thing to eat here is their Red Curry with Duck & Eggplant; OMG if you love a little spice (well, you are going to a Thai restaurant after all) and want to eat some succulent duck and eggplant, order this dish. its #19! haha

Tip #2: Cancel your dessert plans and wait for a special treat at the end of your meal.

The second favourite thing about eating here is that you get free dessert! Coconut ice cream with those chocolate vanilla wafer rolls and fresh fruit! I want some right now! hahaha

Tip #3: Bring a date or a group of friends. This place is romantic and its fun eating all their delicious food.

I love Chili Club Thai House Restaurant! I'm coming for more soon!"}
{"text":"Excellent. Excellent. Excellent.

Beautiful thai flavours with dishes that range from flavourful to spicy and delect.

Favourites are the snap pea green curried chicken. Papaya salad, crying tiger beef.

Don't hesitate to visit this gem of a restaurant! We've been eating here for years."}
{"text":"Excellent service, great atmosphere and the food was as good as I have tasted in Calgary...Recommend this place highly."}
{"text":"I recently had a VERY disappointing experience at this location.  The week prior we ordered in from the NW location and were so satisfied, that we ordered in from the SW location the following week.  We ordered by phone and when my husband went to pick the food up, there were 2 young women working at the front - one was busy texting on her phone and the other couldn't be bothered to greet my husband when he walked in the front door.  Finally, a young man came to the front and helped my husband get his order.  The food itself was incredibly disappointing: the crying tiger beef was too chewy and we couldn't eat it and the prawns were mushy and nasty and I found a bug amidst the prawns.  I called the restaurant immediately to complain and was redirected to other location to find the manager.  When I called the NW location, I was told there was no manager but if I left a message I would receive a call back from the owner, Stacey,  the following day.  Its been 3 weeks and still no call back.  Easy decision for us - we won't be eating at Chili Club Thai House again."}
{"text":"Best and favorite Thai food in Calgary. Little spot, but has always had amazing food.

Favorite dish is Cashew nuts chicken, seafood curries and my husband's favorite is Crying Tiger dish... hot delicious"}
{"text":"So by now you know that I am a HUGE Thai food fan. Seriously. There are few types of food that make me as happy as Thai food. 

You can imagine how delighted I was when a friend suggested we have dinner at The Chili Club last night. She didn't have to ask me twice! 

From the moment we stepped foot into The Chili Club, we were whisked away to a remote part of Thailand where all that mattered was good food, exotic ambiance and exquisite service. Let's not fail to mention the impeccable imported statues that have been perfectly placed all over the place. 

We ordered a number of different dishes. Everything from The Chili Club's vegetable curry, the Pad Pak Ruam Mit, the Lemon Pepper vegetable curry, all the way to the coconut ice cream for dessert. Mark my words: Everything was DELICIOUS. 

From the spicy main course, to the creamy, sweet coconut ice cream, I couldn't have possibly left more content. 

I would recommend The Chili Club to all you Thai food lovers in a heartbeat; Every single one of your senses will thank me."}
{"text":"Not worth it for the price. I got the coconut rice which was tasty, but the other food was below average IMO. I had the crying tiger as my main course, and was very disappointed in it. It was too much sauce and the flavor was just too strong for me. Another thing I did not like about this location was how it looked from the outside... it honestly looks like an old 2 story house you are walking into. The inside is alright, much better than the outside, but nothing too special. Its a very small space, and was quite crowded.

Overall, I was not too impressed with this location and food and will not be going back here or recommending it to a friend."}
{"text":"Have been meaning to try this place out for a while and we finally did a week or so ago - and since then we have been back twice!!! Since we live close we just order pick-up and eat at home so I haven't really seen inside.. the food though is delicious! You will be happy if yo order anything off the menu because it's all tasty - I will say CAUTION tho - if you don't specify how spicy you want it (it doesn't give you the open when ordering online so best bet is to call in) they will over load your dish with extremely hot peppers. I like a spicy meal as much as the next guy, but the first oder when we didn't specify almost blew my f*cking head off! Over all great food and descent (if not somewhat impatient) service over the phone"}
{"text":"A reincarnation of a old space that once housed various Asian cuisines, from Chinese, Vietnamese and now Thai.  The restaurant is not apparently visible from street side as you have to enter through the office entrance and proceed downstairs to the basement.   Its certainly pleasing that time and effort was spent on refinishing the restaurant with Thai motifs, accents, dark brown finish from walls to chairs.  Even the utensils are bamboo themed.  

Being here on Sunday evening it was approx 30% full. 

Ordered the Stuff Chicken Wings with Shrimp.  - It was well done and hot.  Tasty.

Tom Yum Kung - Enough for 4 small bowls.  It was tasty as well and could be a touch spicier for my liking but then again, I like spicy. Plenty of mushrooms, a few shrimps and the lemongrass lime broth pulls through on a lighter note.  

Musuman Curry Beef - Tasty as well and its slightly spicier as indicated by the 2 chilis on the menu.  The beef 'chunks' are defiantly nibble sized and certainly would like to 'supersize' it.  

Chicken on a bed of Spinach - Um...yummy.  Again, nibble sized and it was slightly spicy as indicated by the one chili.  Peanut sauce was light and not thick and heavy .

Pad Thai - Yum. Again good without being over powering 

Roti - it was thicker than traditional roti.  It has a store bought feel to them? I say this because it tastes and looks like the ones I bought and make at home....lol.  Nothing wrong with them at all though.

Complementary Ice cream to top it all off was the proverbial 'Icing on the Cake' with Pina Colada flavours and fresh fruits.

Be prepared to order several dishes to fill your tummy with yummy dishes.  May try it next time with a little extra spiciness.

Theres a 'younger' server and Im sure hes a helping hand and understandably learning the 'finer arts' of utensil and dish placements.  lol...

Would I come back again? Certainly.  Finally, a good Thai restaurant in NW part of Calgary."}
{"text":"I ate here again last week and was happy to have returned. It had been a while since eating here so I was worried that my past review might have been over-glorified by my memory. I was happy to find that to my tastes, it was not.

Actually the last time we tried to go on a weekend night, it was far too busy to get a reservation! We were pleased to get in and even have a big table for the two of us.

The food was delicious, the atmosphere still intimate, the service still impeccable, and the dishes delightful. We ate the Lemon Peper Vegatable Curry, Stir fried Chicken and veggies, 

My only qualms with this place is that the plates are on the pricier side for the portions in comparison with other Asian restaurants. My fiance and I discussed this at length as he is most definitely a bang for his buck type of guy (in fact we both are), and like to get value for our money. Our conclusion is that the flavours are so rich and satisfying that you don't need as much!"}
{"text":"Great for pick up or to stay! The service is always friendly, and the food always surpasses my expectations. One of my family's faves, we always over-estimate how hungry we are, and order so much food, but it's great to heat up the next day. 

The. Swimming. Rama. Oh boy! Their menu marks which items are spicier than others and their selection is extensive and varied. Their take-out orders of rice are best for no more than 2 people, which can be good to know if you're ordering for several people. 

Prices are decent, and the food is fantastic, but beware of their poorly designed parking lot. Besides that, everything at Chili Club Thai House is wonderful!"}
{"text":"This was an awful experience!!! I know they are pricey but I just helped a friend move and we wanted some tasty food. I called in my order and was told it would be 30 minutes. I got there a minute or two early and waited, and waited, and waited. 15 minutes later she brought out my food, and low and behold 2 out of the four dishes were wrong, way wrong. Wrong enough I could not over look it and walk away. So she told me the new food would be 10 minutes, what a joke!! It was about 25 minutes later when she brought out the right order, I looked at the bill and asked why I was paying full price for food that took 40 minutes longer then it should. Keep in mind by this time I was pretty Hangry, you know, hungry and angry because of it? Well this is when I got mad, she looked at the bill and told me she took of the two dishes that were wrong.....well of course you did, I did not order them nor was I taking them home with me. So in fact she just charged my the proper amount. She then said she took take of the GST, I was mad. I asked if she remade all of the order or just the two dishes. What do you think she said.......? Oh that is right, she only had the two dishes made, so my rice, and my other two meals were sitting, by this point, for over 30 minutes in a bag. And she took of the GST?! So my Hanger got the best of my and I raised my voice a little, another server jumped in and took off the two new dishes and I was on my way. To drive home and eat very expensive cold food."}
{"text":"I love this place! Coconut rice, curry and pad Thai rule! Smaller restaurant so they do a lot of take out. But it's so good!"}
{"text":"This place is tiny and quaint. We ordered the yellow curry and the pad thai.  I would say that I enjoyed the yellow curry more. It was delicious.  The pad thai was quite standard - good but nothing extraordinary.

I love that this restaurant serves complimentary coconut ice cream for dessert. It's such a nice touch and is the perfect ending to the meal."}
{"text":"Dinner in last Saturday night with an out of town guest. We have eaten here over a dozen times in the last two years - not a bad meal ever with very consistent quality. However, if you are skiddish about spice heat make sure you tell them or you could have an inferno on your hands!

My favourites are: shrimp stuffed chicken wings, swimming rama and crying tiger.

When ordering take out it is typically ready for pick up within 15 minutes. Try it - yum!"}
{"text":"Great Thai food! I have ordered food here for pick up twice now, and I have not been disappointed! They make a really good duck penang, and they will even make it with chicken if you ask. Their satay and spring rolls are great as well.

Their pad thai isn't my favorite, as it has an almost BBQ flavor to it.  It's not cheap for sure, and their takeaway bags probably cost $10 alone! (but they are pretty nice).

I'll make sure to update the review once I actually eat inside. Until then, I'm sure I will be eating their food at least once a week. Giddy up!"}
{"text":"The food was very good. Minus a star for the slow service. I understand they were short on kitchen staff, but that's no excuse for the service staff to be so slow to take our orders and take care of our bill. The free coconut icecream was a perfect ending to a not so perfect meal."}
{"text":"I've been frequenting the Chili Club Thai House on 36th in the SW for years and Thai Restaurants in Vancouver when I lived there.  I love the food.  So when I heard a new Chili Club thai House had opened in the NW (and closer to home), I was elated and couldn't wait to go.

Since the Family does not enjoy Thai food I knew this had to be a solo adventure or one with friends.  And then a BFF came into town and the opportunity presented itself.

We made reservations and were promptly seated once we arrived.  The ambience was and is lovely in this new restaurant.

I typically always start with an order of crispy spring rolls. Yum.  And then depending on who I am with we pick a selection of at least 4 mains to share.  There are so many great dishes but to name a few: beef curry with string beans, sweet and sour pork with mixed veggies, sesame pork with cashews, cashew chicken with pineapple, peppers and onion, stir fried chicken with thai basi & veggies, any of the veggie dishes, any of the prawn dishes, pad thai and coconut rice.  Now my mouth is drooling just thinking about the food.

They offer wine by the glass so if you are not interested in a bottle you can enjoy a glass. 

The food is always tasty, hot and delicious.  I have no complaints with any of the Chili Club Thai House restaurants and I am never disappointed!"}
{"text":"Chili Club Thai House has been promoted to 5-Star status in my world!
They have consistently been good. The price, the service, the food, the ambience, everything about this little gem is lovely.
:)"}
{"text":"Yummy Yummy.  I had the -- shoot, what was it?  spicy pork somethingorother.  It was really very good.  Lemongrass Martini was quite good, but small and remarkably not very alcoholic.  Tasty though. 

I would *definitely* go back again.  

For those from places with lots of thai restaurants, the adjust your spicyness expectations down probably 1 notch.  Food is ranked from 0 to 3 chilis and 2 is supposed to be 'very spicy'.  I had a 2 chili dish, that I'd probably mark it as 'pretty spicy'."}
{"text":"I love that this place is close to our house, and I love the food!  The Crying Tiger Beef dish is spicy and delicious, and a must have every time we go.  I am also a huge fan of the Pad Thai, and the peanut vegetables!!

It can be kind of hard to find if you do not know what you are looking for, but it is worth the magical mystery tour.  Once you get into the restaurant you will be pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"This is one of Calgary's hidden gems that I would like to keep as a little secret for myself so that I can still get a reservation. There are some other major Thai restaurants players that get all the action in town but its the presentation and quaint nature of Chili Club that keeps me coming back. A small little place, with only a hand  full of tables. My favourite part  is coconut ice cream desert, a sweet treat that is served after every meal here."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the takeout is FAST - seriously I brought a book to read and ordered a tea but had to take the tea to go since my order came so quickly. Everything tasted great, hot and fresh. The prices are a little high for the portion size (main dishes are around $15 and serve 1-2 people) but the food is really great so it's worth it."}
{"text":"Nice decor, friendly service, pretty good Thai food. I ordered 2 Panang curries, one pad Thai and 2 orders of rice. It was the SMALLEST portions I have ever seen! Our 2 children and my wife and I were not satisfied! Very expensive for the teeny tiny portions.
I may muster up the courage to try in house. Hopefully, the portions will be adult size. Food was good enough for me to consider a second chance, and also because there isn't much choice here in the NW."}
{"text":"Have yet to have a dish we don't like. The appetizers of the shrimp stuffed chicken wings and the lettuce wraps are the greatest. We have made a meal of just the appetizers in the past. My husband's favorite is the chicken and spinach in a peanut sauce and I really enjoy the salmon filet and the halibut dishes. Then there are all the seafood and beef dishes that are excellent so ordering is often difficult.  They have the same dessert for everyone of coconut ice cream with fresh fruit that is light and so satisfying. The nice feature for me is that almost all dishes are gluten free which is so important for me as I'm a celiac"}
{"text":"So far this has been the best Thai food in town I've had. I've only had take out once from there (which seems much easier as they are CRAZY busy with no parking most nights) so it's definitely popular. 

I tried some of their signature dishes like the Lemon Pepper Vegetable Curry (under vegetable section) and the Chili Club's Vegetable Curry as well as Tom Kha soup. 

Everything was very unique and flavorful. It was a definite departure from regular Thai curries to have a lemon pepper curry but it had great flavor in itself and I can see why they put it on the menu. Definitely try it, it's so unique!

The Tom Kha was delicious, full of flavor and vegetables just the way I like it. 

The Chili Club curry was a little too spicy for me but my bf loved it. 

This might just be our favorite Thai place so far so definitely going to try them again. But perhaps try to make a reservation or go early, it's quite a small place!"}
{"text":"Love ordering take out from here! I have the pad Thai, and while it could have more kick, it is better than a lot of the other Thai restaurants I've tried in yyc. All of their curries are amazing. Dining room is tight space wise but the food is always good. If you love Thai food you must try Chili Club Thai! (& a reservation would likely be handy if you are dining in- they are very busy during the dinner rush!)"}
{"text":"Chili Club Thai House is  the best Thai food in Calgary - hands down. Before I went to Chili Club I was skeptical of Thai food and hated peanut sauce. When I met my boyfriend he insisted on taking me here and it's been our go to date night restaurant ever since. We always have a romantic evening and walk away raving about the food. 
The atmosphere is dim, quiet and romantic and the service is always prompt and extremely friendly. Most importantly the food is always fresh, the flavors bold and the presentation is beautiful. 
We recently took my boyfriend's mother here for her birthday and had a lovely time. We ordered the Beef and Chicken Skewers with peanut sauce, Green Curry Prawns, Cashew chicken, and Black Pepper Beef with Coconut rice for the table. Everything was delicious. We've tried close to everything on the menu from the pad thai to the jungle beef and we have never been disappointed. The best part of every meal is the fresh coconut ice cream with fruit that your served. It's the perfect way to cleanse your palette and leave on a  sweet note."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Always reliably fresh and delicious food.  The curries are delightful and I recommend the shrimp rolls.  Love the coconut ice cream for dessert!  I was part of a group of chatty ladies that stayed waaaay after this restaurant closed, but the server allowed us to hang out without making us feel like we were in the way.  A really lovely night!"}
