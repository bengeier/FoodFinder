{"text":"I really thought that this was the loveliest cafe. I had an iced coffee and they took it from the refrigerator and blended it with milk (you can also blend with gelato) and added a tiny bit of syrup and it was beyond delectable. I don't even know what they did to it exactly but it was one of the best iced coffees that I've ever had. I also had a delectable rice pudding that was completely smooth and was flavored with rose water and topped with ground pistachios. Again, just completely delicious. They are right across from an absolutely amazing summer concert series that takes place at the corner of Duluth and Laval. It's honestly the most Montreal experience that you will have. Folding chairs pulled up around world-class jazz musicians, Latin American musicans, etc. Paired with a delicious iced coffee and a sultry Montreal evening and you truly have an incredible experience that you can't repeat anywhere. Love."}
{"text":"Very cute cafe with a couple lovely people running it. Very English-friendly, very good coffee, delicate pastries and sweet, juicy fruit. Strongly recommended!"}
