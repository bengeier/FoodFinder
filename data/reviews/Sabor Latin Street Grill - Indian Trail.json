{"text":"I ordered the chorizo (made in-house!) nachos and they were fabulous!  Enough food for at least 2-3 people.  My husband ordered a burrito and it was really good too. We ordered chips and quac and were pleased with both.  Tortilla chips were freshly made and perfectly seasoned. Portions were huge and the manager was extremely helpful with answers to our questions and made menu recommendations that were spot on.  We will definitely be back to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"Very tasty. I really love Mexican food. Even though it was super authentic like grandmas cooking, it is pretty darn good. BYO burritos!"}
{"text":"We dropped in for dinner last night and had another great meal. Pattrick took our order and made us a couple margaritas that hit the spot!  We had a \"make your own bowl\" and quesadilla with grilled chicken. As always the food was delicious and served promptly.   Looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Great nachos that consume an entire pizza pan. Clean and fast service. Great sauces too!!!"}
{"text":"Quick and easy stop for a Latin food fix!  Many options for vegetarians all with an authentic taste.  Super friendly staff also. The plastic utensils are the worst thing about this location, the utensils seem small and are flimsy."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow!  I've been missing out and eating inauthentic Latin foods for years until we decided to try this place last night.  I could keep describing, but will just say again: \"wow wow wow\". We will frequent this place."}
{"text":"Great food and service, highly recommended! Daily specials and taco Tuesday, $1.00 tacos. Looking forward to trying everything on the menu."}
{"text":"Awesome food, more than enough food and VERY friendly service! Variety of sauces was a great adventure in flavor. One of our new favorites!"}
{"text":"A welcoming, casual venue - come as you are. Be prepared for some absolutely delicious Latin food! Exemplary service (Shout out to Jeremy!!!)  We thoroughly enjoyed the Nachos Supreme (what we originally went there for based upon Yelp reviews and photos) along with Chorizo, Barbacoa, and Al Pastor Tacos kicked-up with a cross-selection of their wonderful salsas from their self-serve salsa bar (beware ... the Habanero is quite fiery, yet entirely on the money). We complemented our \"foodstuffs\" with a couple of their very good Margaritas.  No nits whatsoever to pick here, and we are indeed picky people, especially when it comes to food.  We will return ASAP and plan to run through the entire menu over several near future visits (impossible for us to do all at once).  Most highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Food here 5*: cheap, filling, big portion and so, so tasty. The food is fresh, of high quality, and just a mix of really delicious flavors. Portions are huge, walked out with a food baby after just eating the taco bowl- no nachos or eating the taco bowl- just the filling.  Staff are amazing! So friendly and kind. Great service and cheap too. Sabor has 5 locations so there's no excuse not to try it out!"}
{"text":"I've been back MANY times since my initial review and this place is still awesome!!  The food is just delicious.  It's the best Mexican food I've had since moving to the Charlotte area.  My favorite is by far the Al Pastor Autentico Tacos...  topped with their Rosada Sauce, it is amazing!!  I've also had their Nachos and loved them.  This place just puts out awesome food at a decent price and I'm so glad it's close to home.  I've been back many times and will be back many more..."}
{"text":"Awesome staff. Food us really good too! I had the burrito and my friend had the nachos, which for the price was an insane amount of nachos. Had a great experience with both food and staff, what more could you ask for? Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is really good I enjoyed my meal. I got the shredded chicken quesadilla and a order of carne asada fries; both was really good. The only complain I have is that the fries get soggy and so did my quesadilla."}
{"text":"Food was great! Staff was friendly. Best nachos for the price, hands down! I was embarrassed to eat them alone...but I did! Will definitely be back:)"}
{"text":"The food is delicious. My husband hates mexican food but even he asks to eat here. We went to the hawthorne location but it was way to loud and busy. This location is not as loud and is much better for family dining"}
{"text":"Food here is GREAT the menu is full of yummy goodness. With anything you chose  to eat you will not go wrong, if you looking for beer and mix drinks they got you cover from Mexican beer to local beer. Best Latin food by far."}
{"text":"Sabor is our new favorite stop for a quick bite. The interior is lacking a bit in style and is very small, but the food makes up for it. Their daily specials can't be beat and their margs are made with fresh lime juice. It tastes like the beach in a glass. My favorite menu items are the carne asada fries, the nachos (which are HUGE), and the elote loco."}
{"text":"Tasted good but did not sit well in my stomach. Very clean location. If you have a strong stomach I would recommend."}
{"text":"Great authentic food, friendly staff, and a really good find for outside the Charlotte city limits."}
{"text":"Good food in a casual location.  The carne asada fries and Dominican Yucca Nachos were great!"}
{"text":"Disappointing versus many reviews.  Had the Carne Asada Fries and the meat was flavorless and a bit cold.  Wife's tacos w coldish meat.  And place was freezing and rather unpleasant.  Maybe caught it on a bad day, but won't be back."}
{"text":"We ordered almost the whole menu.  My favorite though, is the empanadas and quinoa avocado bowl with chicken."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb if you're looking for flavorful Latin American food-like food truck tasty!"}
{"text":"Excellent flavors, fresh ingredients, fast. Friendly people. One of our favorite places for lunch or dinner. Especially love the salads!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent and the portions were more than generous !! Good beer selection and $4 margaritas when we were there tonight! ! Definitely will go again"}
{"text":"Overall amazing, delicious experience!!!    Cheese Arepa- incredible!!!!  Mexican Corn- Amazing fresh taste!!   Yuca fries- crunchy outside, supple inside- yummy!!!"}
{"text":"First time yesterday ! We placed a to go order - very polite young lady took our order . My husband picked up our meal 15 min later. Oh man it was delish ! I had the quinoa avocado bowl and loved it ! Fresh and wonderful . My husband got a burrito & Gordita he also found it incredibly fresh & tasty. We will be back and glad we found you ."}
{"text":"I love this place, it's not expensive and the food is fast and amazing! My favorite is the quinoa avocado bowl with grilled chicken! Also the Guac is amazing, get a large bowl and the chips are free. They have some really good craft beers as well!"}
{"text":"Not bad but the quality seems to be slipping from our initial visits.   Could you get some decent plastic utensils, please?  These are unusable."}
{"text":"They fast friendly and clean. This is my second visit. Very close to Latin street food. I will be back. Empanadas my favorite the best!"}
{"text":"We ordered the Veggie and Chicken empanadas.  The Veggie empanada had about a tablespoon-full of vegetables, about 2 tablespoon-full of cheese and the rest of the empanada (about 80%) was empty.  The chicken empanada had a lot of cooking oil dripping from it and it was 25% chicken and 75% air.  I had empanadas in Puerto Rico so I know what they are supposed to look & taste like if they are home-made and made properly.  You pay at the counter \"BEFORE\" you see the food. They turn the cash register monitor around for you to sign AND the screen will show you recommended tips to add to the bill.  Of course you will feel compelled to add a tip even though you have not received any food or service. Both empanadas came on a single metal plate so we had to share the plate.   As a Hispanic, I was expecting some authentic \"Latin Sabor\" (flavor) but we walked out very disappointed."}
{"text":"The portions are huge, and super fresh ingredients. The pork is delish and is flavored with pineapple, highly recommend trying. Great prices for such large portions and if you buy a large queso you get the chips for free. Friendly and clean establishment. We habe NO made it a weekly staple."}
{"text":"Everything we have gotten at Sabor is so, so good. Our favorite is the nachos with steak. My daughter and I share an order and we can never finish them. The margaritas are also fantastic."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good for a chain restaurant but be prepared to spend a lot of $$ for little amount of food they up charge you for every thing and the size of the side are absurdly ridiculous !"}
{"text":"Latin street food off the street! Similar concept to Chipotle in dining experience and food quality, but for half the price. Authentic and fresh, this is one of the best places to eat cheap. I normally order online and pick it up in 15-20 minutes, which is super convenient. Chips cost extra but it's only $1.50 versus $3.25 at Chipotle. The salsa bar caters to 3-4 different levels of spice  like my Mom says, if it doesn't make you sweat, it ain't hot enough. They've got salsa that will spark joy (and fire) into your taste buds. If you haven't yet tried Sabor, I highly recommend giving any one of their tacos a try ($3 per taco isn't bad). The only downside is the size of the restaurant. Too small for the volume of business around dinner hours. However, it's a quick and easy way to please your family if you choose to order everyones dinner online on your way home from work."}
{"text":"All I can say is, it was an awesome find when my family stumbled upon this place. We were treated like family from the time we arrived. Food was prepared & brought quickly, fresh & hot. I'm a huge fan of fresh flavors, so having so many fresh herbs topped on the food was a plus. The fish tacos were perfectly prepared. The Elote was the perfect blend of sweet corn & cheese. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is the greatest. Really authentic, good quality food that is fast and well priced is a rare thing in the Charlotte and this place is fantastic!! Love the ease of ordering and the margs too."}
{"text":"This place caught me off guard. Doesn't look like much from outside and when you step inside it doesn't exactly scream \"you'll love it here!\" However, I LOVE THIS PLACE! The service is friendly, and the chicken arepa is ridiculously good. Love their sauce too! Keep it up, Sabor!"}
{"text":"Huge nachos! Huge burritos! So delicious! Can't wait to go back and try some other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Seriously could eat here EVERY day!  Great menu items fresh, tasty and healthy. This is my 4th time and I give 5 stars each time. Friendly fast staff. Weird but true..they have great tea, it is usually an indicator for me. I will be back....maybe tomorrow. Go NOW!!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location twice and pleased both times. Tasty food and fresh.  They also have a self service salsa bar with to go cups."}
{"text":"We order from here very often, sometimes a couple of times a month. Always the best and freshest food and I cannot talk highly enough about how great their burritos are!! Insanely good and I crave their fresh foods."}
{"text":"Love this place! Awesome $1 taco tuesdays, love the chicken quesadillas, love love love, come here at least once a week! One suggestion please add one in Matthews!! :) great value, great taste, good Service!"}
{"text":"Our first experience was great! We loved the food! Our second experience started out rocky but they made up for that with the wonderful service from Mr.Deal. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great food. Quick too. We had the carne asada fries....awesome! And corn w mayo, cheese and chili powder....fantastic and the burrito was almost the size of my head! They have a big selection of Latin American non alcohol and alcohol drinks too. Deff recommend!!!  They're opening one soon in pineville by the hospital. Can't wait."}
{"text":"We liked this formulaic local chain. Everyone liked what they ordered:  * Gordita (My complaint was that I couldn't get a bite that had everything - I had to eat the lettuce and cheese first; then the meat; then the beans. Other shops can build their Gorditas so everything's evenly spread out like in a burrito, just saying.) * Protein bowl * American tacos * Chicken tenders  About $45 with a 15% tip, which is what I usually add when it's not proper table service."}
{"text":"I was amazed at how good this place was. The only bad thing was the cold front Mother Nature sent through on the night we visited. Portions were nice sized and freshly made to order. It's a good change of venue in a place we need it most."}
{"text":"Read about Sabor from the Charlotte Agenda and had it on the list of \"to try.\" Went on a Saturday around 5:30pm. My husband tried the BYOB with grilled chicken and Mexican rice. He being a Chipotle fanatic wasn't swayed, but thought it was a solid alternative. The seasonings were the tie breaker. My daughter had the children's chicken taco meal with the half ear of corn. Nice hearty meal with shredded cheese for a topping. I had the shredded chicken empanada with yuca fries. My meal ended up being the family favorite. Perfectly crisp, not greasy or soggy. Another nice bonus is the free salsa bar ranging from mild, sweet or spicy.  Overall everyone was able to find something satisfying without having to try to navigate a huge menu that other Latin restaurants are guilty of. Kid-friendly with a solid kids menu, high chairs, and changing tables in the bathroom. Seating is limited, but food arrives fast so tables open quickly."}
{"text":"Fantastic food.  Street Tacos and Fried Yucca are phenomenal."}
{"text":"Local shop turned into a Region-wide chain, Sabor cranks out great food for a great value. I was headed back to Charlotte from Marshville today and on the drive back I was debating on what to get for lunch. As soon as I saw the Sabor sign from the edge of Hwy 74 my mind was made up.  Since I frequent the NoDa and Pineville restaurant, I have a good idea of what I want. I usually get tacos, Locos Al Pastor with a side of queso. Since today is national burrito day I decided to try something new and how could you go wrong with \"Sabor Especial Burrito?\" My girlfriend was with me and she got a Locos Taco and an Empanada.  We got seated and when the food arrived I was blown away at the size of this burrito. You get to choose your protein (I got Al Pastor Pork) rice and beans. I thought just getting one menu item was going light but they give it to you hot and heavy! Great seasoning on the pork, crisp veggies, wonderful rice. What a homage to the holiday!  I'm feeling a little under the weather so I opted not to steal a bite of Krissy's empanada, the fry on the outside and filling inside looked great and she had no complaints. The Locos Taco is exactly what I'd expect from any other location.  Fast AND friendly, the manager not only took our order but also served it and stopped by our table twice to see how everything was. I can dig it! What's better is that everything from the tables, to the drink station, even the restrooms were squeaky clean.  It might have been nice to have a special for National Burrito Day (they did have some special, as they do for every day of the week), but considering that they're going for authentic it's probably for the best. I'd bet my last dollar that this \"Holiday\" was created by some national restaurant exec who needed to sell sell sell more burritos.  It's always a pleasure to see a true local chain not only thriving, but taking root all throughout the area. I hear there are plans for more locations in the works and I'm all for it. Can't wait to see where I'll be eating delicious Sabor Tacos next!"}
{"text":"As a semi-regular of the location in Elizabeth near my home, I was very happy to see another one open closer to my work. Although with traffic on Independence, the one in Elizabeth wouldn't take much longer to get to. This place is brand spanking new and was nearly spotless.   The staff was extremely friendly, including the manager who stopped at my table twice to make sure everything was good. The nachos I ordered were HUGE. I would say they were piled high to almost the height of a basketball. And at $6.95 including protein, they were a a steal - had enough to take home for a second meal.   There's the reliable salsa bar with several good choices and my favorite which has pineapple in it. They don't have alcohol yet, but the craft beer and cocktails should make an excellent addition when available for those that go at night.   The other positive was the kitchen is a little more closed, so you don't end up smelling like tacos the rest of the day. Look forward to visiting again soon, when I feel brave enough to take on Union Co. Traffic."}
{"text":"This place never fails to amaze me. From the happy atmosphere to the delicious smells, Sabor has to be the best family Latin American restaurant on this side of the Earth. When we stepped in, we were greeted by smiling faces and a warm welcome.  The food is very fresh. One of the things I love the most is the flavor of their fresh cheeses. The food always comes out hot and it is prepared with care and lots of love. The flavors are complex and nuanced. This is more like a fine dining experience than a fast food place."}
{"text":"Avocado Quinoa Bowl FTW!!!  If you're insanely hungry, order the nachos. Giant portion size.   This place reminds me of a more personal, more original 'Moe's' type of restaurant. If you are looking for a new, unique experience when it comes to Latin food, this is the place for you!  Very polite staff and management-and clean, no frills atmosphere."}
{"text":"Straight up awesome!  Fresh ingredients,  great staff,  salsa bar,  way better than Moe's."}
{"text":"We were out running errands and just stopped in for a quick meal. I can't believe how cheap the prices are for such good food. Not only is the food affordable, it's delicious."}
{"text":"Thank you, Indian Trail, for finally having more locally owned restaurants with variety - some of us are tired of seeing the \"chains\" that are going up on Independence lately.  I truly enjoy this restaurant in the Elizabeth neighborhood and was super excited to see this going up in IT. The BYO Burrito was the BEST I've had in a long time - and hands down beats anything from Chipotle, Qdoba, Moes, Salsaritas, etc. Thanks for also offering a craft beer selection - good to see the locals (NoDa & Unknown) in there, too. The only drawback to the IT location is that the decor and atmosphere feels a bit stale - unlike the Elizabeth location. Keep slingin' awesome food!"}
{"text":"We really enjoy Sabor Latin Street Grill ever since we found it in Elizabeth.  This location has the same menu but it was missing a few things that we loved about the Elizabeth location.  The ambiance just wasn't the same which I think effected our overall enjoyment of the meal.  The location was very clean but it just felt more fast food vs the latin flair of the other location from the decor to the music.  The food wasn't the same (point for Elizabeth).  The flavors were similar but the presentation and amount of accompaniments were not the same (another point for Elizabeth).   The food just tasted and looked better at Elizabeth.  We will definitely go to sabor Latin Street Grill again, but we will go to the Elizabeth location as it is overall the stronger restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent food, fresh, hand made and a great variety of a la carte items. I hope they serve house red wine and not just beer. Women love Merlot more than Beer lol!! Can't wait to try the rice and beans as those are the true test of Latin food."}
{"text":"First time here and it was amazing! I had the carne asada fries and my daughter had the kids quesadilla.  The food was wonderfully flavorful and even my picky eater declared her food delicious! The sauces in the back of the dining area were yummy, accurately described, and tasted fresh.  Staff was helpful,  polite and quick.  I will be back."}
{"text":"This place has terrific and fresh food. They have great daily Specials including $1 taco Tuesday and kids eat free on Wednesdays. My favorite dish is the Supreme Nachos with grilled chicken and black beans."}
{"text":"Great food price is a little high but the taste makes up for that the people were really nice and the service was quick it have a very authentic feel"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants. I have eaten at uptown and south charlotte locations. Both spots are a 10."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place while debating on going to Firehouse or starving. Sabor is very good. I tried the chicken taco, beef taco and beef empanada. The tacos were the best I have had in Charlotte. What you expect in real corn tortilla tacos. The empanada was good, but not excellent."}
{"text":"if you like tacos made with corn tortillas ..then this is yhe place for you. awesomw tacos.   good price margheritas. great friendly vibe. lots of vegetarian options. cant wait to go back and try more things."}
{"text":"Food at Sabor is good. The staff are usually friendly, especially one little guy hat works there. He's always helpful with suggestions about the menu items and checks on you once you've gotten your food.  They could definitely use more seating or just a bigger place. It's too popular to be in such a small location."}
{"text":"One of our new favorite places to grab a quick meal.  Satisfies our picky eaters too.     The restaurant itself is small so it can fill up quickly. Service is great,  staff is friendly, and the nachos are amazing.  We've been there about 5 times in the past six months and have no complaints."}
{"text":"Food is decent but service is horrible.  Went mid day (3pm) and waited 20 minutes for an order of nachos.  There were only three tables with guests and 4 people behind the counter (one dishwasher, someone prepping for dinner, one cook and a cashier who was doing nothing more than pacing behind the counter).  The lone cook was preparing one item at a time instead of working a full ticket at a time or the same item from multiple tickets at the same item (all three tables ordered nachos that required nothing more than making three piles of chips and throwing prepared toppings on them).  The prepper nor the cashier pitched in to help expedite or prepare orders.  I can't imagine the wait times during peak hours.  This place won't be here long.  I miss Genaro's :-("}
{"text":"So delicious! I had the carne asada fries, yuca fries, corn, and shrimp tacos. I shared. No judgement lol. The people working were super nice and the food came out really quickly. I wish they had a chain closer to my house."}
{"text":"Very enjoyable! The food here is so very good! I had the quinoa-avocado bowl for a lighter meal and was very happy with every flavorful bite. My companion ordered one of the burritos and was impressed with the size of it and the quality of ingredients.  This place has order at the counter service and quick delivery to your table. The only drawback is that every time the door opens, a cold breeze travels half the length of the place. So sit farther back or go when it's warm, but definitely go. The food is delicious and a good value."}
{"text":"$1 taco Tuesday has become a weekly tradition. I live in an area full of your typical everyday fast food chains and its truly a breathe of fresh air when I have Sabor to eat at. Healthy opinions of great quilty food which I'm searching for right after working out. I would like to put some art in this restaurant. #saborislife"}
{"text":"Seven of us went to Sabor today for lunch.   We got 9 items to share.  All of the items were good.  My favorite was the empanadas filled with ground beef and cheese.  Carne asada covered fries were tasty.  Very quick to remove empty containers from our table."}
{"text":"Great twist on Latin food. Tasty and great staff. It is one of my favorite go to spots."}
{"text":"We go here probably every other weekend now and it's always great.  The staff is always super friendly and the service is fast whether you eat in or take out.  I'm a huge fan of the yucca fries as well as building my own bowl.  I usually choose steak, quinoa/brown rice mix and refried beans.  The chorizo is awesome too.  Finishing it off with a Mexican Coke is a must.  Sabor is one of my top 3 places to eat in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"If you like Hispanic food and you have yet to try Sabor, you are making a mistake!   Sabor has a combo of a few different favorites from Argentina, Venezuela, and Colombia. I personally really like the Empanadas. Build Your Own Bowl (BYOB) is also a great option. They have healthier options as well such as quinoa.   The thing Sabor does well is to keep the menu concise. One mistake made by many restaurants is to overload the menu with too many options. Especially being a newer restaurant chain, I think Sabor will continue to expand with a smaller menu.   This place keeps the food really fresh; I actually witnessed a supplier bring in fresh vegetables. The chips here are excellent and they have five different sauces. The green monster was spicy but delicious. I put it on my bowl and it was perfect addition."}
{"text":"Great food, VERY limited seating (approx. 8-ish tables). Food so good, worth eating lunch at 11am or dinner at 4pm!"}
{"text":"Do you eat your feelings? Do you have a LOT of feelings? Then, boy, have I got a place for you!  At Sabor, the food is inexpensive, flavorful, and comes in large portions. The employees seem to skew very young, but are always in good spirits and have provided pleasant service. The location is unfortunate, and without a proper vestibule, outside air blasts in every time the door is opened. If you're visiting on a nice day, it's not an issue, but in poor weather it can get uncomfortable.   You've probably seen Sabor's nachos on a handful of \"Best of Charlotte\" lists, and for good reason. I've tried them with shredded chicken and with ground beef; both come scattered atop a mountain of hot, crispy chips and are a real crowd-pleaser. And, really, bring a crowd. The amount of nachos you get for $9 is astounding.   The gorditas are messy, but they're tasty and filling. They don't make a good sharing dish, so get one all for yourself.   Sabor's tacos may be authentic, but compared to everything else I've tried, they aren't as packed with flavor. I've dribbled fresh lime juice and various salsas over shredded chicken tacos and they just don't stack up for me. If you're looking for a healthier option, these may be a good pick. If you, like me, are about sour cream and guacamole and cheese, skip these.   The plantains may not look like much when they're dropped off at your table, but they're always piping hot and perfectly sweet. Try 'em with a bit of queso fresco for a great flavor combination.   Are you still reading? If so, you've earned my best tip: get an elote. Get several elotes. All the elotes. They're the best kind of street food! Seriously -- don't fill up on the nachos. Get a smothered cob of corn and tear into it with reckless abandon. Have a napkin at the ready."}
{"text":"Its dollar taco Tuesday is truly a steal. The shredded chicken, ground beef, veggie tacos are all a dollar on Tuesday. My parents got the shredded chicken, beef and veggie tacos. My parents like the beef tacos better than the chicken tacos. All its tacos are very tasteful even the veggie taco. I tried its nachos before and it is huge and it was enough for two or three people. The fish tacos were good but pricey."}
{"text":"Was getting ready to give 5 stars until the hostess/cashier started spraying bleach on tables at 8:45 while people were still eating!  It was awful!  Please, do this AFTER your patrons leave the restaurant!  Protein bowl was great, salsa and margarita wonderful.  For a counter service restaurant, the food is top notch.  Hope the managers take note of the cleaning advice!"}
{"text":"this food is great! the fresh, made to order proportions are huge!  the manager is very attentive & the staff is friendly. we love everything on the menu! their daily specials are so good, dining here has become a weekly must!   try this place!!!"}
{"text":"Best nachos I've found in the Matthews/Indian Trail area so far.  You can customize basically everything, they have online ordering AND a salsa bar.  I love the salsa, but they make it fresh so heat levels can vary day to day.  Plus they have drink specials on many days, so if you sit there and eat, you might be able to get a $2 beer"}
{"text":"Ordered a burrito must of had a miss communication got a bowl no biggie food was a little bland there was plenty of it though"}
{"text":"I was a little hesitant when trying this place out. I'm a vegetarian and going to restaurants that are favored by meat eaters aren't always my \"go to\".   I ordered the veggie empanada and the quinoa avocado bowl. Both were extremely delicious and satisfying.  I will definitely be back, and you should all give it a try!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious and worth the price! The empanadas and elote were amazing. The staff were sweet and friendly. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Overall, it's good food. It's missing something, however, to make it great food in my opinion. It just didn't seem very fresh / flavorful.  We split the nachos (wow - what a deal!) and a burrito. We had SO MUCH FOOD! The portion size is ridiculous. We could have just shared the nachos and been full...but why stop there?  We chose two kinds of salsa from the salsa bar (pineapple / habanero, and another tomato one that was supposed to be hot). The salsa seemed flat and almost bland. We were expecting a lot of flavor after reading the names. If you are familiar with Flaming Amy's in Wilmington, this salsa bar and its contents do not compare.  The beer selection was decent - they had Belle's Two Hearted in cans and a pretty good selection of Mexican beers. They also had some local cans (NoDa's Cavu and two Unknown beers).  The atmosphere was ok - we were two of maybe six in there all together. It's small, you order from a digital menu board, and the staff was friendly. It's like fast food Latin-style, with beer.  My take: it was good, not great. I'm probably not going to be craving it any time soon, but wouldn't rule out going back there for a quick cheat meal (definitely the nachos). I'd recommend trying it for yourself, though."}
{"text":"I've been to two different locations.  Both places amazing!  After being impressed the first time at the Hawthorne location, I decided to try this location out before work.  I was craving nachos so I decided to order some with the carne asada.  I didn't realize how much food was given.  The nachos literally could feed 2-3 hungry people.  For the price, it was definitely worth it!  Can't wait to return and try some new things!"}
{"text":"At least it's named appropriately. Come here if you want something you would typically get from a street cart. The food wasn't absolutely terrible but nowhere near good enough for a repeat visit. In addition the place was dirty."}
{"text":"So delicious! I had the carne asada fries, yuca fries, corn, and shrimp tacos. I shared. No judgment lol. The people working were super nice and the food came out really quickly. I wish they had a chain closer to my house."}
{"text":"This place is amazing good!  Brought my co-workers here for the first time and they were blown away.  Everything is so good!  My kids also love the glass bottle Mexican Cokes.  The corn is so delicious.  Staff is awesome, especially Patrick who told us the specials and recommended some awesome dishes!  He has Sabornality!!  Will be back often!"}
{"text":"Shortly after opening, this was not my favorite of the Sabor locations - it seemed a bit cramped (and not in an enjoyable, street food dive sort-of-way). It was just \"meh\". But over time, they have come a long way. If memory serves, after opening, there wasn't much paint, and it had that middle-of-the-road feel. Now some fresher paint gives it a vibrant feel, and it's as if things are always hopping.  Staff is very friendly, and helps you through the menu. There is a cooler to grab a bottled drink, and of course you can get a fountain drink if that is your preference. Naturally you have the signature salsa bar as well, make sure you don't miss it. Food comes out fairly quickly, though it can be in spurts rather than the entire table at once.  Some of the food is smaller, if that is all you need (see tacos), some of the food is monstrous (see protein bowl or nachos). This is great as it can service you for your personal needs or fit different sized appetites. And while the food as it comes out may be a bit less than you prefer yourself, do not forget to visit the salsa bar!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Best tortilla chips ever, great prices, and fast friendly service."}
{"text":"Best burrito I have ever had! Their handmade margaritas are also spectacular! The salsa bar gives you the opportunity to try all of their options. We have already been here 3 times and it will remain in our dining out rotation!"}
{"text":"New favorite place in Indian Trail! Better than Chipotle! Superior service, fast, clean, fresh food, salsa buffet, and the cherry on top: queso!!!"}
{"text":"First time here, had our first experience in noda, which was perfect and on point.  This location serves waaaaaaaay less quality mexican foods compares t their noda location.  I hate their flip screen POS that pretty forces (default at) service fees of 20%.  For a fast food, really?"}
{"text":"Finally made it to Sabor and was very pleased! Tacos al pastor were our favorite, and I was super impressed with the chorizo, which wasn't greasy at all! They make wonderful arepas & great guacamole. Will definately be back soon!"}
{"text":"The Sabor Special Burrito is excellent and huge in size. I like the salsa bar they have as well (especially the pineapple habanero). They also have a pretty decent beer selection."}
{"text":"Always good-see my review of the Wesley Chapel location. The best nachos and quinoa bowl I've had down here. Very authentic and always have unique menu specials, written on a chalk board in front.   Serve Alcohol!!! Unique rum and tequila drinks and Latin beers.   Have a salsa bar you serve yourself that has some hot offerings-green monster-salsa verde with an extra kick.   Very casual, store front."}
{"text":"Food was good. I will be going back. I would like to try the carne asada fries. They looked delicious. This time I built my own burrito and because I was being greedy I ordered a taco too. lol couldn't eat the burrito..my eyes were bigger than my stomach. Whew! I'm full. Ohh and it was very clean. Took a lil longer to get our food but cashier was friendly."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time and got the shredded quinoa taco salad with black beans. It was absolutely delicious, tasty and filling! The employees were super nice and helpful with making recommendations. They even have margaritas, Mexican soda and a great beer selection. Will definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"This place is dope.  This is what Moe's/Salsarita's/Qdoba/Chipotle wishes they were.  Everything Ive gotten so far is great and the girl at the counter from Mexico is really friendly and knowledgeable.  My only knock is that some items could be cheaper, but we're not in Tijuana so I get that a novelty street food concept in NC can never be as cheap as real street food south of the border.  Props to offering real Mexican Coke in the tall bottle.  Stop here if you haven't already.  Be prepared for it to be busy any night of the week at any time.  YUM!"}
{"text":"Oh so good!  1st time there was today. Service was great and friendly. The food was awesome.  They finally got their liquor license and will be serving by next week. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"There is nothing like some Latin street food.  I could eat one of everything on Sabor's menu.  My standing order is typically a Gordita, Empanada, Yuca, and Elote Loca, oh and a Mexican coke - you know those tall bottles of Coke with the white label - the BEST!  Of course my eyes are always bigger than my stomach and I end up taking a bunch home as left overs.  If you have only had Taco Bell as your Mexican food experience then please don't argue with Sabor that their Gordita is not a Gordita.  Sabor has it RIGHT!  Think of a homemade corn masa cake that is cut from the top and stuffed with pure deliciousness.  The Empanada dough is crisp yet flaky and chewy, and drips of cheese.  The Elote Loca is an ear of corn lightly spread with mayo instead of butter, has crumbled cheese on top and then has seasoning sprinkled on top.  Sabor's menu is a la carte, but has a little something for everyone!  Is anyone hungry yet?"}
{"text":"I'm not big on reviewing franchises, but I got to give Sabor credit. This is a great street food restaurant and there is a reason new ones keep popping up all over Charlotte. I like the food, the price, and all the choices of salsa. I love their Elote Loco Street style corn, absolutely delicious & by far my favorite. I have also had their Gordita and Carne Asade, good as well, anyway I think that's what it's called. Special shout out to their pineapple habanera sauce, really spicy and very sweet. Every time I go no matter the location, I have had a good experience therefore four stars..."}
{"text":"My family visited Sabor of Indian Trail for lunch back in August. There were several families with children and the atmosphere was really chilled out. We ordered the veggie empanada, a vegetarian yuca nacho thing, and a meat taco for my hubby. There was MORE than enough food for the 3 of us and everything was delicious. The yuca was perfectly cooked and the empanada had a lovely cheesy interior (i wish there was more filling though). The nacho thingy was listed on the menu with sauteed cabbage, but ours was not sauteed and it added a nice crunch (but made it tricky to eat).   The only complaint I have is: part way through our meal the volume to the music got really loud in the restaurant which made it difficult to hold a conversation."}
{"text":"I Really! Wanted to like this place, seeing all the 5 stars, I was sure I was going to enjoy this eatery, alas it was not to be. I ordered the Arepa, Veggie Empanada, Elote Loco, Burrito, Yuca Fries and Drinks, of course. The Arepa was stuffed with chicken, cheese, and some ketchup tasting like sauce. The smell of the chicken just bothered me, idk might be the cheese/sauce combo, did not eat. The veggie empanada was, well I would not order again, the shell was tasty but the same weird cheese, saturated in cheese and bits of veggies, too greasy for my taste. Now the Burrito was ok...ish, too Salty, low quality in my opinion, 100% of all of us there prefer Chipotle. Now comes the Elote Loco, ugh, corn tasted old, dressed up with tons of mayo, cheese, chile to mask it, i feel. The yuca fries were, nice, pretty yummy. The drinks and yuca fries where why they got two stars if not 0. That's the way meow see's it."}
{"text":"Wow! What a great meal. So excited that Indian Trail is getting some good restaurants finally. This replaced a restaurant that had great tasting food but had the worst customer service. It is an authentic tasting Latin food. Has a similar feel to Chipotle, but do I dare say is better? I certainly like it better than Chipotle, they also have more choices and they have authentic queso! The prices are in line with Chipotle as well, which makes this our replacement since it's right down the street from us. Lastly, the customer service was great, very attentive to customers and eager to please. You have a new customer! Thanks Sabor."}
{"text":"This place is great! The nachos are huge! Way more than enough. Love the corn tortilla tacos. Much more of an authentic type! Great prices too."}
{"text":"If you enjoy authentic Latin flavors, you have to try Sabor! What the location lacks in seating, they make up for with friendly service & DELICIOUS food. My family & I have tried everything from the brown rice + quinoa bowl to the empanadas (huge!) to the elote loco to my personal fave, carne asada fries. The $1 tacos on Taco Tuesdays and daily from 3-5pm are great for a quick bite. The barbacoa is so good, it regularly sells out. Go getcha some!  I lived in southern California for 23 years and Sabor is by far the closest thing I have had to my favorites back home."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite lunch spot. The food is always fresh and amazing. The Nachos are some the best. Oh yeah, the Empanada is amazing as well. Every time I go I try something different and nothing has been a letdown. Great staff."}
{"text":"I'd recommend for a quick bite; however, I was not pleased. I lived in Houston for a few years so perhaps I'm biased, but I tried the corn and it was bland: there was seasoning; however, the mayo was piled high that you could hardly taste anything - even after I added more seasoning. Not a fan, I'll stick to the authentic Latin flavors found in HOU.  Update: I've tried the fries topped with steak, avocado, and a few other toppings... boy oh boy! It was yummy! The steal was well seasoned. Definitely a must try! Did I mention the drinks? Get that, too."}
{"text":"Great street corn and tacos, particularly the pastor with pineapple! Love the salsa selection and seasoned chips make for a welcome change from the standard taqueria fare. Chicken was quite dry and bland but with the salsa went down easy. Nice corn tortillas and quick service as well."}
