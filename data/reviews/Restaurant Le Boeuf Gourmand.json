{"text":"Il y a un restaurant, là bas sur Saint-Denis, qui me rappelle la maison. Un restaurant qui sent bon le pinard et l'accordéon, les croissants du matin et l'apéro des belles après-midi d'été. Un mélange harmonieux d'ici et de là bas. Des bons petits plats franchouillards qu'on croirait inventés pour survivre aux hivers québécois et une sangria miraculeuse, qui vous étanche le gosier lors des chaudes soirées de canicules...  

Radio nostalgie en fond sonore, on y fredonne du Piaf et du Aznavour en attendant la commande. Et voilà la patronne, qui vient elle-même s'occuper de vous et vous proposer ses petites nouveautés. Elle vous raconte sa carte des  vins et vous récite le menu comme un poème : coq au vin, buf bourguignon, assiette océane... 

Finalement, vous avez opté pour le fameux contre-filet de buf émincé et ses frites maisons,  et tout en le savourant vous ne cessez de penser au dessert que vous allez choisir: profiteroles au chocolat? Crème brulée? Mousse au chocolat? Aïe! Ce n'est pas encore ce soir qu'on commencera le régime! Tant pis, à la place on prendre un bon gueuleton bien de chez nous et on en redemandera!"}
{"text":"We found this place after buying grouping coupons.

The good:
 Started with entrees Cream of vegetable soup and a Salad.  The salad was great, nice presentation and tasty.. the soup was a bit bland.  so for entrees 1 out of 2.
For the main we had the special which was slicked steak in a rich buttery sauce... very good, which came with home made fries (a volonté)  It turned out to be alot of food.

Deserts were very good.

What needed improvement:
Decor was a bit iffy, the music was very old french Parisian, but some like that I guess.  I think that if they changed those 2 thinks they would do even better with a younger crowd...

Service was very good and personable.

All in all a pleasant supper out."}
{"text":"So...take a wild guest as to what is their specialty? Beef of course! I had moderate expectations for this restaurant but I ended up having a great night at  this family-owned French bistro! The owner was extremely friendly and very proud to describe to us their specialty: Grilled entrecote de boeuf (sorry, I don't know the translation... its a cut of beef!) with a sauce made with 18 secret ingredients served with all you can eat french fries.

I ended up having the specialty and my girlfriend chose the beef tartare as she's been having a craving for it for a long time. The owner made sure a few times that we were OK with eating raw meat.

Everything was absolutely delicious. My steak was juicy, tender, perfectly cooked and charred. The sauce was really really good as advertised. There must be a good dose of butter, parsley, shallots and white wine. I have no idea for the rest but the sauce truly elevated the flavour of the beef to a whole other level. The fries were delicious as well. 

But the best was by far the steak tartare: hand chopped as soon as the order comes through, the meat comes topped with a raw egg yolk. You then mix in all the other ingredients to your liking: onions, capers, parsley, mustard, mayo, etc). The beef was absolutely fresh.

My girlfriend and I usually share our meals when we eat out. We'll usually swap plates when it's half full. This time however, she kept on raving about how good her tartare was that I kinda felt bad about snatching the plate away from her. I only took a few bites and it was heaven indeed! We both licked our plates clean and that was the end of a delicious meal!

A solid 4.5 stars"}
