{"text":"Fantastic food, great beer selection and great service. The atmosphere is really good too. Prices are not low but you get a lot for your money!"}
{"text":"Oysters run out very quickly during oyster night; Prepare to be ignored by every waiter - service is subpar."}
{"text":"I love the food here. It's always fresh and delicious and I've never had a bad meal. The servers are friendly and the patio is awesome."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times and really enjoy it! Service is great and server was attentive. Nice to even have the manager ask how things were. Beer selection is broad. Had some nachos, which was a decent size platter. Some of the other dishes leaving the kitchen looked great too! One of my favourite spots to hit on an afternoon pub walk!"}
{"text":"It was my first visit. They have a great beer selection, including gluten-free options. The menu is diverse for a bar menu. The world burger is arguably one of the best burgers in the city. We enjoyed the shrimp tacos as well. The manager, Cory sat down with us and was very friendly and personable and you could tell he enjoyed himself there. My girlfriend was very impressed with the variety of gluten-free options. Our waitress was friendly and though it was busy, she never seemed rushed or frazzled. Definitely a louder place, great for a group of friends especially for sporting events."}
{"text":"That couldn't have been a more underwhelming experience.  First, let me say the service was fine. Our server was cute, bubbly and attentive enough.   The meal, however, was less than what I expected. I ordered the coconut curry rice bowl. It tasted like neither coconut nor curry, although there was some kind of milky liquid swimming around the extra large chunks of red onion.  The onion -- and large growths of cilantro -- dominated the bowl. After scooping out the grass and the onion, the bowl was edible but tasteless.   I let our server know and she was kind enough to offer to take it back for something else but I really didn't want to wait for something else to be made, only to have it fall short of expectations (which by now were low anyway). She ultimately gave me a 15% discount on my meal which I very much appreciate.  It was, however, my mistake to tempt fate and have seafood. I added prawns instead of chicken to my rice bowl and now I sit here with the telltale warning signs setting in -- disoriented feeling, searing stomach pains and deadly gas (worse than the dog). I'll be full out sick inside of an hour or so.   Thus, I can now cross prawns/shrimp off my safe list for seafood handled in Calgary restaurants. It was the last item on the damn list.  Please note: I am not allergic to seafood. I am a born and raised Nova Scotian who went directly from sucking on a bottle to a lobster claw.   One other note for the manager: it's all well and fine to have rowdy sports fans yelling at the TV and having fun. After all, I love sports. But when a guy is repeatedly 'motherfucker' at the top of his lungs, it might be time to settle the place down a bit ... you know, for the sake of your other patrons."}
{"text":"Love coming here!! Servers are always great! Uber friendly and we are always taken are of!! Food is amazing and the roof top patio is great for a hot summer day!!"}
{"text":"Discovered this place for brunch. Was expecting the typical two choices pub breakfast but was pleasantly surprised. The breakfast menu here is awesome. Huge selection. Food is great. And the service is amazing. (Not something you often get during late morning hours on a weekend in the bar scene) Definitely a new go to spot for weekend brunch."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, great beer list, good music and ambience.  We ordered various gourmet burgers; they weren't very good. Go for the beer!"}
{"text":"1410 has a great selection of world beers, but be careful, some of them are not all that great. We had some sort of orange peel inspired beer from the Netherlands or someplace that tasted like the worst kind of cough medicine you could find. And the place started to get crazy on a Friday night and hard to get service. But the food was good and most of the beers are delicious. It's worth going to, but don't be surprised if you're ignored when things start to get crazy. It just means you'll have to fight for your beverage...."}
{"text":"This was once a great place for food. However, today I ordered the Eggs Benedict with a side of arugula and tomato salad. The arugula was probably at its best about 4 days ago. The best leaves the 'chef' plated today were an anemic green to yellow, laced throughout with strips that had already rotted! I couldn't believe my eyes.  The staff were polite and responsive, but what the heck is going on in that kitchen? Are culinary schools really that bad these days? Anyone who would plate such rotting garbage obviously hates food, or people, or both. Surely there are unemployed chefs in Calgary with a passion for both food and people, who would love to show their smarts. Management needs to get to work."}
{"text":"Good beer selection, nice streetside and rooftop patio, passable food (used to be better), music way too loud to allow reasonable conversation, and bad customer service from both the wait staff and management.  I will not usually complain about a single incident in a review, since every wait staff member has their off days, but to have management make it worse is inexcusable. I ordered the special of the day, a pint of Liefman's (hey, it's summer!), while the rest of the table ordered various regular drinks. What arrived was a small glass of just over half a pint.  When I pointed this out to the waitress, she said \"that's how it comes\". I noted that I asked for the pint special from the menu.  Eventually we got the manager over, and he insisted it was a misprint, and that no one had ever complained about it before. He said he could not give me a pint because the stock numbers would be wrong (lame excuse if I ever heard one, especially as the Liefman's is on tap). My table mate pointed out that if they display it, take my order, serve me and charge me as they were, it was false advertising.  At this point the manager threatened to kick our table (two couples) out, and this was our first drink of the night! He eventually relented and brought me a Liefman's in a pint glass...topped with ice.  We used to go here fairly regularly for the very good food and drink specials, but their is a palpable sense of complacency here now. We won't be going back unless their is a revamp and a major change in management."}
{"text":"I love this spot!  They have a very wide selection of imported strong beers, my favorite.  If you like strong dark beers, you should try the St Benardus Abt 12.  The world burger is out of this world amazing, and the kitchen is very acoomidating to requests and allergies.  I have two favorite staff memebrs, both philipina ladies and they are amazing (have only ever had one of these two the many many many times I've went)."}
{"text":"I've never felt more devalued or under appreciated as a patron in my life. I've been to 1410 many times and have had nothing but great experiences--which is why it's always been my go-to as an out-of-town patron. The waitresses at 1410 used to take the time to build rapport with their customers--shaking hands and introducing themselves. This was my experience for the past 4 years. I was reminded tonight that all good things must come to an end. The service was terrible! Our waitress was standoffish from the very beginning. A guy who works for the pub (who took on the persona of a night club bouncer) came over to our table about an hour in and reminded my friend the dress code kicked in at 10:00 and that he would have to remove his hat. He didn't introduce himself--ask us how our night was going--it was simply \"take off your hat\". It was very evident we didn't fit into the night club atmosphere they were trying to create. In spite of the poor service, my friend and I decided to take the high road and leave a great tip (as our waitress still worked hard). She didn't even acknowledge the tip--or wish us a good evening (she simply walked away). I will never step foot in this establishment again. The personalities and genuine service is what made this place great. Both were glaringly absent tonight."}
{"text":"1410 is a pretty cool place... Most of the food is okay. The Greek ribs are really good & they have them for only $6 on Tuesdays!! On the other hand, the spicy luau flatbread is absolutely disgusting!! The line ups at night are ridiculous! You have to be on an invisible \"guest list\" to get in :l Fantastic outdoor patio with a DJ in the summer."}
{"text":"I used to be there a couple times a week but no more. They lost some super friendly (and hot) female servers and the service just got slower and slower. The one manager guy (bald and taller) at the door really irks me. He's a bit standoffish and arrogant, which is odd that they put him at the door to greet customers? He acts more like a power-tripping bouncer than a friendly person to welcome the patrons. I did hear they overwork their staff, so everyone is a bit grumpy sometimes. I like their food, quality is a little up and down but generally pretty good."}
{"text":"If you like little slot wait staff who giggle like little 13 year olds. And spend time tacking to tables of guys for half the day instead of serving. God forbid you interrupt them.   The beer is over priced. The food is sub par at best. The servers would better belong in a strip club where they're behaviour us expected. Not here. Whatever. If you like that shit, this is your place."}
{"text":"Probably the best food in all of Calgary! I've never really seen a bar make all their food from scratch. Everything is incredible on their menu, it blows me away every time I visit cow town! Their beer selection is the best I've seen at any bar in all of Canada. I hate going to bars where the best beers you can get on tap is crap like Coors light or Budweiser. 1410  has some incredible beers on tap from all over the world! Plus they have Trappist and Abbey beers which is what real beer connoisseurs drink. If you want to try a real beer order a Chimay red or blue, you'll be amazed! Unless you're a Bud Light champion drinker, then you don't really know what beer is and probably wouldn't like Chimay. Staff is extremely friendly, service is even better. Plus the best part is the fact that they have a roof top patio! I spoke to the bartender working up there and he loves his job! (Can you blame him what's better than being a bartender working outdoors and working with some extremely beautiful women!!) He is a Greek guy named Kosta, really good bartender and fun to talk to, he made my day just having a conversation with him! He convinced me to order a slush infused beer, which I had my doubts, but wow was it good!! Plus apparently their slush is made with vodka! what's better than that?? I wanted to order a small appetizer, and I guess him being Greek convinced me to get Calamari. I've tried Calamari twice before (not at 1410) and hated it. But he explained to me that their breading is what makes their Calamari superb plus it's cooked to perfection here, as well as the Tzatziki being a homemade recipe from the owners Greek mother. Wow was he right! That Calamari and Tzatziki was so good that whenever I return to Calgary that's the first thing on my mind! Best service/ food/ drinks in all of Calgary - bar none!"}
{"text":"When Jamesons is to full, the party goes here.   I love the Calamari. Its perfectly cooked, and the Taziki has so much garlic in it. Yum! Sadly though, I have not ventured anywhere else in the menu. So, this review is strictly for the calamari, service and drinks. Awesome."}
{"text":"I've never been to 1410 for more than a quick beer before but finally went in to watch the NHL playoffs tonight. Their beer selection is actually huge, and tons of great new beers to discover like Red Racer, Brewmaster, Rolling Rock,etc. I'll going to be back to see what else I can try.  Sitting near \"the pass\" was a good spot to see all the unique looking items and delicious aromas coming out of the kitchen. Everything we had at our table was awesome, especially the homemade soups. As I'm always looking for interesting new food & drink specials around town and I think theirs are quite good. I'll be heading back one of these Thursdays for the mussels everyone raves about.  Get there early because it fills up quick every evening and try to sit in Amanda's section. Probably the best service I have had in ages!"}
{"text":"Before this place was a pretty chilled place to grab a beer and some great food.  then the reno's came. and over the years the service has been lack luster.   Then the level of douche started to increase. The waitresses barely remember their sections so you can be sitting at a table waiting for a drink or even to be greeted for up to 15 mins.  They then have some tell me your name...i want to forget it as i type in your drink order wrong.   The food is now some \"special\" unbelievable Organic Menu...really...over priced under portioned food.  so after i manage to get the attention of a server who is eating behind the bar and ask for a manager. A manager comes over slightly intoxicated, and is trying to apologize while pawing at me.   \"Oh you beautiful ladies, just come back and see me and we can make this right\" ...excuse me mister manager as you are groping my breast....and dripping sweat on my table. No thanks.   Save your $$ and your patience, and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Second time here and still love it! Service was excellent, very inviting. Seated right away. Gluten free menu and drink options. You always get more than enough food, salad or soup, and a side with the sandwiches and burgers. I like the Santa Monica."}
{"text":"It was fairly loud in here. Went on a Thursday. I ordered a beer from the specials. It was good, generous serving siize"}
{"text":"1410 is an interesting place, though a bit bi-polar. On the one hand they do carry a number of rare beers from other countries which is ... I'll go with ...neat; however, at the same time it seems like they are trying to tap the sports-bar market as well. There are a lot of TVs inside showing the latest in the world of sports. Unfortunately, they have a small bar-to-dinning-area ratio in the establishment which is kind of discouraging to yours truly who just wants to watch the Bulls. Felt  a little cramped!   The Grayhound I had was ok, but nothing spectacular. The food is relatively well priced as I paid $18 for a full rack of ribs. Generous portions! However, the sauce was way too vinegary and sweet. Service was good considering how busy it was.  I kind of feel odd watching a game here by myself. 1410 feels more like a restaurant/drink-with-friends kind of place.  If a novel \"foreign\" beer is your fancy with friends or colleagues and while conversing you need a break to check-in on the latest score of the game, this would be an ideal place.   Interested to see their DJ nights!"}
{"text":"I went to 1410 lastnight with my fiance where we have been quite a few times in the past. It's always a great atmosphere, with friendly staff, and the food is great. Last night, we went for some beers and nachos at 1410 and when we were finished with the nachos, the server took it away. Five minutes later one of the managers came over and said \"I just saw the nachos you were eating and there was not nearly enough cheese, so I'm taking it of your bill\". I found this really classy and respectable and plan to go back to 1410 many times throughout the summer! Thanks 1410!"}
{"text":"I've been for drinks and nibbles before and thought it was ok but wanted to go for a full experience before reviewing it.  Perhaps I should have skipped the full meal experience, because now I will never ever go back.  Three of the four of us had bad food followed by so so service.  The veggie burgers were so dry they were hard to swallow and when we commented on this to our server her response was...\"Really?  You shouldn't order them again then, huh?\".   Every order came out with wrong sides and they made us feel like it was our fault.  As we were finishing up eating the server brought our bill and asked if we wouldn't mind settling up as she was going home...and another server would be coming to take over.  Needless to say after we stopped eating to pay we never saw a server again.    There are too many other fabulous places to spend my money and feed my beer addiction...so thanks but no thanks 1410."}
{"text":"Following a particularly grueling day at work on Tuesday (Aug 12/14), that evening my long time friend and I walked along tropically hot 17th Ave in search of a place to unwind and partake of some orally administered stress anaesthetic. We had no particular place in mind and we were enticed into 1410 Bier Haus because of the delightful indoor/outdoor vibe that their fully retractable windows have on the ground level patio, and everyone looked like they were having a great time.  We walked in the front door and noticed that there was a young female wearing black that seemed to work there (as she was holding menus) standing in front of us. The vacant stare in her eyes at a distant spot somewhere about two feet above the door was reminiscent of when a deer dashes out on to the road at night, and through the glare of your headlights is wondering \"Is that a Tacoma or a Tundra? From so far, the headlight positioning seem so similar. I will wait until it gets much closer to figure it out....\" Not wanting to scare the potentially stunned or inebriated creature, we approached slowly in order to establish that she worked there. After a very awkward silence standing in front of her, my friend cleared her throat and asked \"So can we just go ahead and sit anywhere?\". After a frightened moment of fleeting eye contact, and looking around in panic from side to side, she stared directly at us in silence. After the question was repeated, a flurry of flailing arm movements, she said \"Uhhhh. Yaahhhhh. You can sit anywhere, I guess\".  We walked in through the bar, leaving the bewildered girl and her menus behind us. I like to think that if I was bulemic and could read her mind, that she was thinking about how she wasn't like every other kid, you know, who dreams of being an astronaut, and that she was thinking about how she was more interested in, uh, what bark on a tree was made out of, just like Hansel. We finally found our own way to a table that was very near the open window set up, giving us a lovely breeze from outside, as well as enjoying a bit of the air conditioning from inside. We were greeted in a fairly reasonable amount of time by the server who dropped off menus and then disappeared. When she did come back, we ordered shots and a couple of beers. After about 10 minutes, she returned to inform us that they were out of stock of the beer we ordered, so we selected another. We then experienced a quick delivery of our selected options. Our server, while slow in service at first, made some stellar menu recommendations and ensured that our glasses remained full for the remainder of our stay. The pizza we ended up ordering was amazingly good, with a rustic presentation that had a thin, crisp, crust and fresh, tasty toppings. We noticed around us that the food that the really, really, riduculously good looking people around us ordered also looked extraordinarily delicious as well. The biggest surprise was that even though we had not said one word about the initial service to our server (or each other until after we left) that our bill had been reduced by 10% and when she presented it to us she apologized for the slow start to our service and had given us a discount. We would both definitely go back again, but I would never do it after a long day at work looking and feeling ragged. I would return as a destination for a planned night out as everyone was dressed quite sharply and looking their best. The four star rating was because of the great food and the impressive service recovery."}
{"text":"Food was great, service a little slow. I'll NEVER go back. Debit is the primary payment method utilized  in Canada. The fact that this business does not use debit for payment is repugnant. They force customers to use the $3 surcharge cash machine in the back, which they will typically get $2-$2.50 from each transaction. They are despicable business owners out to rape the public."}
{"text":"This is basically my favorite place in Calgary to come for the best beers and an good dinner (in that order).  I recommend trying Erdinger Weiss and Blanche 'de Chambly. They are in my opinion the best tasting, relaxing, and generally all around best beers you can get.  Food is really solid for a pub too, they even have some really tasty more healthy choices."}
{"text":"This place is *Great*.  The crowd is older (thank GOD), the DJ spins great tunes, the menu is appetizing, the drinks are plentiful, the ambiance is welcoming and the staff is extremely friendly!  We went down on a Friday night and it was packed, and totally happenin'.   Later on in the evening, a dance floor opened up in the middle of the bar, so it's the best of both worlds: Lots of drinking and lots of dancing!  I love that it's located on 17th ave - lots of free parking, and lots to do on the same strip.  This place is definitely one of my faves. I'm glad I was introduced to it!"}
{"text":"Changing my review from a 4-star to a 2-star.  Went with a group for the YYC Burger Week burger and service was abysmal. Waitress would hand out the menu, then disappear. When she appears, and people ask her what the Burger Week special burger is, she mumbles its the 'House Burger' and disappears. People continue searching the menu to find out what the heck is IN THE HOUSE BURGER, but no mention of it on the menu, Waitress comes again and takes drinks orders from someone and disappears. When I finally spot her again, I pretty much drag her back to our table and we ask what the heck is IN THE HOUSE BURGER. She goes off again to find this little insert that is supposed to be in the menu and hands it to our table. By this time, she doesnt seem to happy anymore.  We all order the burger, which is apparently the 'HAUS burger'. Doesnt sound phenomenal, but heck, apparently this is their competition burger, so it cant be that bad right.  I call the waitress over again and ask her what type of wines they have. Instead of telling me, she grabs the menu from my hand, opens to a page, and juts her finger to the section listed 'Wines'. And says nothing.  I ask for a glass of the white, and she disappears again.   The burgers finally come. It was meh at best.  I ate half and took the rest to go. The wine was okay, but the waitress looked clearly pissed off for some reason. Sorry we had to call you over a billion times because you were NOT AROUND and we had people waiting to order food and drinks.  A bit disappointed at both the food and the service. I've had much better of both, but this last time was not 1410's finest moment!"}
{"text":"I know my twitter friends are in love with this place, but I'm just not feeling it.  I previously had a bad experience and suspected food poisoning.    On my first trip there for a late lunch I shared an entire meal with my gf.  Both of us ended up with stomach 'issues' resembling food poisoning.  The rest of our friends that did not split our meal were fine.  It didn't last long, but was enough to make me not want to go back and very uncomfortable for the rest of the evening.    However, I gave it another go recently for brunch at the end of February and I am happy to report it was without food poisoning or stomach issues.  I didn't find the eggs benny I had to be anything to write home about.  Maybe I'm fussy. but I didn't like the ham and felt I was making myself eat it since I was paying for it.  The corn bread was good.  Our server was fine.  Nothing exceptional.  Perhaps it's because I'm not one of the regulars, but I wasn't feeling the connection."}
{"text":"Service was fast; mostly, I think because my friend was friends with the servers. They complied with his need to have 4 extra plates of rice with his meal without batting an eyelash. Solid house red. Clean bathroom too. Was able to carry a conversation amongst the busy Friday night crowd sans yelling. Can't comment on the food, since I only had wine, but I'll come back to try it."}
{"text":"Had an impromptu dinner at 1410.  Got treated really well (hint: follow them on twitter).  Had the burger and mushroom soup at Greg's (gm) recommendation. Both were amazing.    Will be back. Great local pub with great pub fare."}
{"text":"What happened!? We came in and the staff straight out ignored us for ten minutes before we had to flag someone down in the very sparsely populated bar. When we did receive a waitress she did not introduce herself or smile. She took our drink order, reluctantly, and returned several minutes later. My order was incorrect and I asked her to fix it, instead of asking what she could do or offering to help she told me that I was wrong and went to talk to her manager. When she finally returned another ten minutes later (she hadn't asked us about food yet) I asked her again to fix my order. She once again insisted that I was wrong and that her manager agreed with her but refused to bring the manager over. I pointed out the description in the menu and she remained certain that both the customer and menu were wrong while she was right.  All I can say is that I will never return here and suggest that you also avoid it at all costs."}
{"text":"What is up with this place?  Patio, yay right? Wrong!  The Yellowjacket wasps are swarming every where! 2 hanging traps and 2 sticky traps on the bar to try and catch the countless wasps buzzing around the Bartender trying to mix umpteen amounts of sugary flavored vodkas for slicked hair pretentious clientele.    The limes were sitting in their respective supposed to be closed holding tray, but had been so sun dried in the 30 degree heat by 5pm, I was able to squeeze out a few drops of lime juice.  I asked for a fresh lime in my next beverage and proceeded to see the waitress dig to the bottom of said tray and grab a lime screaming to be thrown out.  \"That's the best I could do.\"  Um excuse me Miss, that's the best you could do?  Your job is to cut those limes since you handle them throughout your shift, and should notice the obviousness of the once flourishing with succulent sour juices which gave all those earlier in the day patrons a proper drink.    Now for my meal ... I started eating the fish and chips which came much later than the previous people sat down after me whom got their dinner served before me;  I ate.  The chips were fantastic, but crispy and that sea salt made them absolute in the eye of any Brit coming from overseas just to try your chips.  But those oh so deceiving deep fried pieces of fish; very soggy on the bottom to where it almost became dough again on my plate.  Figure it out.  When my waitress came to ask how my meal was, I replied \"Ok.\" Her perplexed look on her face to repeat my words of Ok had rung through her head as if I said the most sinful tasteless word known to man.  At this point, maybe she should have asked why, or what could have been done to make it better; but nope, I was looked like as if I was the help.  Not given a second look to me (you know since I help pay for her after work drinks and all) nope, not a thing.  At Earls or the Keg, the meal would have been opted for another no questions asked, or comped.  All I got was a waitress ready to snicker to her fellow slicked hair colleagues of my okayedness toward my meal.    I noticed a playful group of workers with a bartender about to fill a water jug, look at my waitress and flirted to spray the water at her putting his right finger over top of the valve which would have caused pressure to spray water a great distance and douse that playful waitress of mine lol'ing amongst the group; so happy and playful they all are :) The bartender then filled that cold sweating silver jug of life's sweet nectar called water to the brim, and the waitress brought it directly to our table.  I paused as she filled my friends glass completely oblivious to what had taken place.  What exactly was on my mind at this time you ask?  ... Well what had that bartender who had just showed up to help the other bartender out doing moments prior to coming upstairs? Well I'll give you some examples: picking his nose, scratching himself, gone number two, digging food out of his molar? The point is I had no idea, and stopped my friend directly in his tracks to omit from ever drinking from the unknown right finger glass.  He may as well have put his entire hand in that jug, and stirred it around for what I had saw; the outcome would have been the same.    Will I return to 1410 after my experience? I told my two friends that if they wanted to come back here to just let me out of the vehicle and I'll take a cab home."}
{"text":"I've come here a few times, and I have always enjoy the beer list. It's a great place to go watch games at, but I'm not a big fan of their food. The last time I went, I got food poisoning from their chicken wings (Wing Wednesday). I will probably go back if a friend wanted to grab some drinks, but I would skip the wings."}
{"text":"Went to 1410 on a weeknight for dinner with my wife. Wife had the steak salad not bad. My lobster Mac and cheese was brutal. Total disappointment. It should be called \"Mac and kinda cheese with dust of something that might have been lobster\" needed a lot of salt and pepper to save it. Drinks were always full waitress was very nice.   Might be back but will not venture away from the pub standards for sure"}
{"text":"Don't come here if you're expecting quick service!  1410 has worked itself out of our regular rotation. The service has never been good, but this last visit was atrocious!  I ordered a Guinness and when the server finally brings it over, the head of the beer is 2/3rd's gone. Thats SLOW.   Our table of 6 ordered 70 wings. There were a bunch of different flavors. They brought all of the wings out on one big plate and the server guessed as to who's was who's.   Is there a plate shortage I haven't heard about?   20 or 30 wings of the same flavor? Sure, bring them out together. 70 in a wide variety brought out on one plate defeats the purpose of ordering flavors.  Our experience was just blah, unfortunately they wont get another chance to redeem themselves."}
{"text":"7/30 - Underdog Challenge  The 1410. The first time I discovered this place it was in a lounge club setting. They had a good DJ and the crowd was really enjoying the atmosphere. But like Classic Jacks down the street, it can get difficult getting into this place.  I finally had a chance to try their beer and food. The beer was ok as far as beer houses are supposed to go. How bad can a pint of Keiths go?  But their poutine was...suspect. I'm sorry but thats what was in my heart. It was good at the time I had it but let me tell you, no poutine has ever done a number in my plumbing like the poutine I had here. It was a miserable night and when it comes to first world problems, having a window open in the middle of winter is right up there."}
{"text":"Beer pubs are the new clubs! Why do Calgarians seem to want to party in the wrong kind of venue these days?   \"Let's go to a world beer house!\"  \"Yah! Because world beer!\"  \"Who cares about world beer?! There's loud DJ's, dancing, guys who put their 9-5 clothes back on to go to the bar and hot young mom's who got the night off so they can go get liquored!\"  So, that said... All in all, if that's what you're looking for, it's a pretty good time! It's a little confusing why this crowd has chosen 1410 to be their party central, but the bottom line is, they have.   And speaking of lines, if you go during party time on a Friday or Saturday, there will be one. But hey, if it's your crowd, you'll probably have a good time partying here - but when it's that packed I think it has more to do with the crowd than the venue.  I got there at about 9:30PM on a Tuesday and it seemed to be going through the awkward transition stage from dinner to NN-tss-NN-tss party time. The result is people sitting around casually drinking beers while screaming at each others faces in an attempt to be heard over the awkward mis-matched fades and tasteless record scratching of the DJ. Awww damn, I'm a DJ snob AND a beer snob now? Apologies.  Maybe if I got here a little bit earlier the music would have been a little more suited to the vibe of the rest of the place. Which really seem to have a lot going for it.  It's got a bunch of glass french doors along 17 ave so the entire front wall can open up to the south sidewalk-side facing patio. It's winter so I haven't been able to check out the rooftop patio, but I hear good things.  They've got a $5 local pint happy hour with my boys Village Brewery, Wild Rose and Last Best. Now we're talking! Much love. As well as a \"Holy Grale\" amber ale as their house beer brewed for them by Village - I'll be back to drink this!  Their world beer menu? Well they have beers from around the world... but kinda like how Taco Bell has Mexican and Pizza Hut has Italian. The choice pick on the menu for dutch beer is Heineken? The First listed on the Canadian section is Alexander Keiths? Seriously guys?? I'm a little confused.. Is there a more thorough list for the bottles that I'm missing. I hope so - because then I will love you.  Wait... Our super awesome and totally fun server, Samantha, was able to bring me 2 different kinds of non-alcoholic beers... That means you must have cooler beers in your American section than Bud Light Lime then, right? Please?!?  To sum it up: - Late night - good for partying, not for talking.  - Happy hour/Dinner - TBD (would bump this to a 4-star if good, though) - In between dinner and party time - Super awkward."}
{"text":"I went again last weekend, and the positives are still the positives: great beer selection, good location (17th Ave), pretty good food.   The negatives are still the negatives: Service is incredibly inconsistent. They have some quality servers, I must admit, but some (even those working the door) just don't quite live up to the \"quality\" 1410 is supposed to be all about. There is already a Moxie's on 17th, so as much as short skirts sell drinks, make sure they have the serving and personal skills to back it up.  I'm a guy- a straight guy - and even I find it a bit of a odd when a senior member of the staff comes up to my table solely to point out an attractive female.   Plenty of potential, but there is too much competition for them to be slipping on the very basics."}
{"text":"I went there about a month ago, and because of the service we got I went back at least once a week. I cannot remember the servers name on the first visit but she was outstanding, she asked my name, introduced herself, and was always close by to help with anything.   Tonite was quite the opposite. We arrived and got menus pretty quick, started off with water while we read the menu. Everything was going just fine until later in the meal. I ordered the world burger which meant I had a starter of soup, the soup was good, a bit more salty then normal but still good. We then got the rest of the food. My date enjoyed her fish tacos and my burger looked pretty impressive. That impression was lost once I bit into the burnt patty. The outside was so dry it cracked and flaked when touched. Needless to say the taste was not great. At some point the server came around and asked how everything was, I was mid sentence and had to say pardon since I did not hear her question. She then said \"great\" and walked away before I had the chance to say anything. At this point I had given my water to my date since hers had been empty for a while. (I did that throughout the night since refills were very slow, it was a Tuesday, didn't feel like drinking but would have liked water) My dates plate was taken away when she was done, I was still working on my food, the manager took the plate even though that goes against all basic server training. Not pleasant eating my food while there is nothing in front of the others at the table. The server came by once more and I quickly ordered dessert since she was not around much. A few minutes later the biggest, and worst plate food I have seen in a long time got to the table with two forks. No napkins were given or even a table wipe down. The dessert was either made out of house and frozen or made with no regard to flavour or presentation. It was nasty! We had a few bites and waited, and waited, and waited. After about 20 minutes the manager finally saw me looking around the room and came over. I told him I thought our server might have died or quit and I wanted the bill and he just laughed and told me she would be by soon. At no point did anyone ask why we hardly touched the dessert. We settled up and left, not looking back this time.   With all of the choices on 17th I think the owners need to put a little more effort into training of servers and cooks before it because one of those places people used to go to."}
{"text":"Came here to watch the playoffs. Turned off the large screen tv to give it to the DJ for his advertisements. Then shortly after they turned us to another tv then turned that off. We had to leave to watch the rest of the game, however I did have a chance to speak to the manager. He explained that they couldn't have those tv's on because it would \"distract the DJ\"... I will not go back during any sporting event, but reluctant to go back at all given the managers response. Home and Away was more than accommodating across the street and had the game on all tv's!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and perhaps I have lucked out, but the service has been great for me. Actually all of the service I receive from any of Group 933's establishment has been excellent. Maybe because I often stop in on my own or with just one other person and we're not rowdy or needy? Either way, that aspect is stellar.  Today, I ordered the soup and salad combo -- mushroom soup and the Greek salad.  Despite the slight mix up of the salad (which happens), was reasonably priced and tasty. Actually, the Mushroom soup was delicious - creamy and filled with chunks of mushroom. I will definitely go back for the soup alone. The Greek salad was nothing to write home about. Fairly standard and only had 3 calamata olives. 3 olives does not a Greek salad make, but that's the luck of the salad scoop I guess. I have gone in for their weekend brunch which was stellar - stuffed french toast, caesars, and great company and will most likely stick to that side of the menu.  There is also a roof top patio I wouldn't mind checking out (although I am spoiled by another fabulous rooftop patio in the deep SE that has set the bar). So I will be back."}
{"text":"I like the rooftop patio. I don't feel the food is anything special and is over priced."}
{"text":"I so totally enjoy this pub! Ever since their renovations back in 2009, this place has been bumpin! It is packed every single day/night of the week, it's actually quite amazing.  Personally, this is where I like to go on \"first dates\", mostly because of the vibe: upbeat, enjoyable, hip, and many other great things!    They have a pretty average menu with the usual specials like wing wednesdays. The food almost always tastes delicious. The drink selection is my favorite part about this place, they have so many beers and everyone knows I love a great beer!   Keep your eyes peeled for me on my dates at 1410!"}
{"text":"Haven't been to their rooftop patio yet but I have been to 1410 many, many times.  Food is okay. Place is nice and clean but loud. They have beautiful servers and management seems to stay on top of things all the time - this earned them their 4th star!"}
{"text":"Warm Beer, Lousy Service, Below Average food, and Loud.   If this is what you want in a place, then look no further, you've found a great place.   They have a fantastic selection of beers on their menu, not to mention a number of different beers on tap.  The food menu looks very good and it isn't your usual chicken fingers and fries type of pub grub.  Unfortunately, this is where the compliments are going to stop.  After this it really goes downhill.  The food was below average for the price and portions were small.  There are a number of TVs playing whatever sporting event you want to watch, but the music is so loud to the point that you can barely carry out a conversation.  Service is spotty and ordering any of the premium beers will set you back the cost of an appetizer (or more) and the one that I had ordered wasn't really cold, it was cool-ish, but definitely not cold.  Considering they call themselves a \"Bier Haus\", I would have figured they would know how to serve said \"Bier\".  Apparently not.    If you want a better experience, go to the liquor store, find the premium beer and pay for the corkage at a place that has better food/dining experience."}
{"text":"I wandered the city to find bar that had NBA playoffs on tv.  Even though my team did not win, the food and drink here did.  My wife wanted something sweet and the waitress suggested a sweet drink called Liefmans.  She loved the sweet berry taste.  We had the Thai chicken salad and found it to be very flavorful and cooked to perfection.  It was surprising and refreshing to find sports bar with really good food!  Crowd was good, locations of tvs were good, and atmosphere was great."}
{"text":"I've been to 1410 many times, I guess that alone says something. If it wasn't a decent place I wouldn't keep going back. I went again last week for some casual drinks with some friends, it's usually a pretty busy atmosphere so come a bit early if you want to secure seats, especially if you're coming in a group. We were short a couple seats so some of us had to stand and it was a bit squishy and it seemed we were always in a lane of traffic, nonetheless we made it work and enjoyed the evening.  One of my biggest draws to 1410 is they have a solid beer selection with some unique choices you don't find at many other places. Once again this was the case as I ordered \"Fire and Blood\" the Game of Thrones themed beer, very cool to see unique selections like this! They have much more including mini-yards, boots, etc. Another great plus is their specials are usually a decent premium beer, not the usual cheap domestic special you find elsewhere; it was Delirium on special in this instance. One thing I will mention is that the beers are priced higher than your usual domestic choices, more of a $7-9 beer place and not a $5-6 beer.  Our server Justine was very on point and accommodating, she even went as far to learn the group's names to make the experience more personable. Very nice touch that I rarely see anymore. Maybe she was a tad too flirty and pushy with drinks; I get that it usually helps with sales and tips but for me personally it wasn't necessary. Especially since a member in our group really should not have been offered any more to drink. That's just me over-critiquing though, overall great service, very satisfied!   They had a live DJ which is a nice touch, just wasn't feeling the playlist much other than a couple good throw backs.  One thing that we didn't get to experience on this particular night but is definitely worth checking out is their roof top patio. I got to scope it out last summer and was very happy! So drop by and give it a chance if you're a fan of beer and a more relaxed but still lively scene."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all.  Ordered the Charcuterie plate and perogies with our drinks, both were blah.  The salami had gone bad and we had to send back.  It stunk and literally tasted like crap.  They sent out fresh salami which tasted ok, but nothing special.  She ended up cleaning the table with a half eaten plate that cost us $23.  This was also on a Friday night when the flames were playing and it was dead which kinda surprised me.  Can't say I'll be coming back any time soon.  Didn't like the food or the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I happened to go here on St. Patty's Day, which means that the place was super busy, so I'll just leave the service side of this review out of it. There was one girl, unsure of whether she was a customer or a worker, but she managed to hit my boyfriend on purpose with a St. Patty's hammer or toy of some sort. That was a little annoying, but again, everyone was drunk that day. I was just exhausted by the time I got here so we enjoyed some Apple Crisp and that was alright I suppose. I don't know, not much to say about this place right now. It seemed.. clean?"}
{"text":"I have to give 1410 kudos for exposing the clueless to different beers from around the world.  The crowd is very corporate and often gives you the sense that outside of the Stampede, this is probably as exciting as they ever get.  Still, you can sit down and have some great beers, as long as they have it in stock. There's been many times where I've ordered *three* different beers only to be told they're out. And I'm talking my first three choices aren't available so I have to go with number 4.  Being bombarded with Top 40 music and multiple sports on LCD screens isn't exactly my idea of how to savour a good beer, but it works for the kind of people who think that drinking a \"weird\" beer somehow makes them different from everyone in the office."}
{"text":"This place is great for having social events and having some beers with some good buddies. The wigs are a little dry but the entrees are so far quite amazing. Parking is a bit of an issue unless you live downtown. All in all I would recommend this place for sure."}
{"text":"Wow what a nice lounge sports bar on 17th.  The exterior is even attractive, with very sleek wooden design mixed with urban chrome.  The one whole side of the bar has an open window concept and it looks like some parts of it slide open like a garage door to accommodate a patio setting in the summertime.  The day that I went the place was packed by tons of guys and as soon as sat down I could see why; the place is lined with huge LCD televisions and overly attractive wait staff.  This is obviously a place you can buy a good brew or two or ten, because many were enjoying the sports visuals and drinking an assortment of shades of beer.  The place inside is really modern, high stools, very streamlined and High-Tec and they have a fantastic menu selection.  My friend had some Chinese Potsuckers that according to her were spicy yet delicious and I dove into a Turkey Wrap complete with fresh strawberries and Brie cheese!  Included with my Wrap came two side options and I choose the yam fries and a Cesar, all this for 12, pretty reasonable I thought, and incredible tasty.  Service was great, the waitress and the host were very friendly and there is a nice casual relaxed feeling when you come here that really helps to enjoy your meal.  So not your average sports bar, more of an uber space bar... well worth the visit."}
{"text":"They don't book the patio and I think it's a bit overpriced, but 1410 is usually a crowded and happening place."}
{"text":"My 20 yr old little sister came to visit me from Moose Jaw, a small crappy town in SK. It was a sunny day outside, so i decided to show her the lovelyness of strolling down 17th, to people watch, shop, and grab a bite to eat.   We popped into 1410 to grab a bite. I have been there to 1410 several times before with large groups, and was never impressed, but for some reason 1410 has this strange following, and is always busy, so I figured it was just me.  We walked in and were greeted by the very friendly hostess man/manager?There were only large tables available, so he split one in 2 for us, and let us sit down. We then heard him go up to the server and tell her to pick up our table.   FOR THE NEXT 20 MINUTES WE SAT THERE AND NO ONE TALKED TO US. Our menues were clearly closed, and not one person greeted us for even a drink order. The server was just chatting to a table of good looking guys the whole time, she didnt leave! She refused to even awknowledge us. What was worse- the hostess man/manager didnt even seem to notice or care that no one had helped us. (we were sat at the very front near the entrace)  We stood up, and put our jackets on, and left, and no one even tried to stop us, or ask us what was wrong. I've never recieved service like this in my whole time living in Calgary. What an embarrassment, especially trying to show my sister a good time.   I will never return. What kind of PUB makes people feel this unwelcome."}
{"text":"You're up, you're down. You've landed somewhere in the middle. 1410, once upon a time I really did enjoy your surroundings, your staff and your offerings. But over the last year or so something changed. Your music got louder, you just seemed to have lost that loving feeling and opted more for a mainstream \"chain\" feel. Perhaps it's the competition from another chain in the area. But here's the thing, changing your digs so you're a lot like everyone else was what lead me to know enjoying you as much in the first place.  Where you do differentiate yourself is your phone service. I once called to inquire about a couple of types of beer I once knew were on your menu. I called at a busy hour, and I wasn't kept waiting long while the person on the other end of the phone checked on the availability for me. Not only that, he went on to inquire whether I'd be coming in soon and if I needed to make any reservations. Smooth! I didn't even have to ask.  Still, I avoid you during busy times because you just aren't an enjoyable experience. You're \"too busy\". I know, good problem to have, right? Or is it? I'm not sure. At any rate, I'm looking forward to testing out your new rooftop patio this summer... maybe it'll help win back a star in your favour."}
{"text":"The short version: Inconsistent, but a good time. Great beer selection.  The long version: I want to love 1410. I really, really do.  See, I like it. I like it a lot! They've got good things going for them over there.   But as others have mentioned, service is maddeningly inconsistent here, mostly dependent on what time of day you arrive. For example:  Weekday lunch? Great service! Weekend evening? Awful service!  The servers might creep the heck out of you the first time you come because here it's totally protocol for them to shake your hand, introduce themselves and ask your name.  Now, I'm guessing somewhere a study was done that showed that when a good looking waitress shakes the hand of a lonely male patron, her increase swells right along with his pants. And don't get me wrong, I'm a people person. I LOVE meeting people, especially cute waitresses. But this just feels really fake to me; an obvious ploy at faking me into believing the service was actually better than it was.  Well, try, try again 1410, because I'm on to you! Want to impress me, babes of 1410? Instead of shaking my hand, just bring me that drink I asked for within 10 minutes of ordering it. Also, write your number on my receipt with a winky face.  Too ambitious?   But I digress. The management here is actually great about meeting patrons and I've been treated to drinks from staff here a few times (thanks to who I was with), so it's tough to complain.   The food here is a highlight but can be just as inconsistent as the service, unfortunately.   Sometimes you get an incredible meal that feels like it was prepared just for you by some sort of European Oma in a bavarian kitchen. Other times you get the sense your dish was churned out of a puppy-mill style kitchen.  The flatbreads range from \"oh lord put this in my mouth and never take it away\" to \"blah.\" The meatball flatbread is just okay - their mexican one ruled my world. Burgers are great - nominated for best burgers for a reason. Sandwiches are delicious.   The beer selection is great; lots of great brews on tap and seasonals in stock. Not as good as Bottlescrew Bill's, but close - and with a livelier atmosphere if you're into that. I sipped an Erdinger Weiss, chatted up a neighboring table and watched the game.   I guess people dance here sometimes - I've never seen it. I didn't even know there WAS a dance floor. But if you're into that, I guess it's safer than shaking it on top of their highly elevated tables.  So all in all, 1410 just needs to step up their consistency to improve my review. For now, it's just too inconsistent to award full points."}
{"text":"Rooftop patio is worth the visit! Good service, food is average. The Poke Tuna was okay, popcorn chicken was average and the pizza was okay as well."}
{"text":"My second visit to 1410 was last night and not my choice.  My friend loves this place but I still think it's only worthy of 3 stars.  I was here with five others ladies and it was obvious we were the oldest women there, amongst a few other stragglers over 35 and 40.    Again, I met some great people and the music was decent, but it felt like a room full of sweaty conjoined twins.  The overcrowding can get ridiculous and for anyone with anxiety or claustrophobia issues, there's no way they could darken the door of this place on a weekend evening.  I looked like a drowned rat by the time I left.  I also had a hoarse voice and ringing ears from the loud music and having to scream over it.  Another bar fight nearly broke out and yes, it was after midnight.  I had fun, but wouldn't stand in line for this experience."}
{"text":"1. I love this place. 2. If you love beer or roof top patios, you will love this place!  3. Get the @villagebrewery exclusive brew: Holy Grale.  Local malt forward light cooper coloured ale. Thirst quenching seasonal ale mmm. 4. Needless to say I'm a regular and/or an addict!"}
{"text":"I gave this place three stars because I know they have good food. Although I did have the apple crisp recently and it was apples...without the crisp. Haha. There was next to no granola, but I do know a lot of the other things on the menu are good! The service is ehh though. I didn't feel as if our server cared too much, but then again what was I really expecting. You probably shouldn't expect much either. Haha."}
{"text":"Well played 1410, you're doing a lot of things right.  Yes, the servers still annoy me with their silly introductions, but I'm pretty sure that you're wooing me.  A lot of this has to do with your social media presence which you've elected to use as a customer service tool rather than just a straight marketing or sales channel.  You're listening to feedback, you're engaging in discussions, and you genuinely seem to care if my food and drinks are ok.  I've had a good time the last few times I've been here and the douche factor seems to have declined.  Way to get back in my good books."}
{"text":"This place is great for a Friday or Saturday night!!.. If you just want to have some drinks with your friends... Also, I think they have a D.J. From Montreal.. So the music is great... The service is not bad.."}
{"text":"You've changed 1410, you've changed.   While the changes over the years seem to have worked out great for the business they're not so great for me. Until Friday night it had probably been 4-5 years since I was last there. Then, it was a great pub to hang out, enjoy the great beer selection, maybe catch a game, and have some wings. They've since renovated and like many of the bars on 17th, they have moved to more of a club atmosphere.  The DJ on Friday was good. The crowd seemed ok, though I don't understand why people try to take a handful of drinks and shots from the bar by themselves just to spill half the contents by the time they reach their table; get a friend to help you people!  When I'm in town I'll probably be back, but this this really only because my friend can get us past the line and because other people I'm with like to go there."}
{"text":"Ordered calamari, sweet potato fries, burrito and Hawaiian pizza to share. Food is no culinary master piece but does the trick if you're hungry. Cocktail menu is limited, but to be expected since it's a beer house. Service was good."}
{"text":"Oh 1410, I laugh at the lineups of yuppies who want to \"club\" at your establishment late on Fridays and Saturdays. The lineups which are so long the line and the smoker gang take up the entire sidewalk, so as a poor pedestrian trying to get home,  you start to walk with your elbows out. I am sad you lost the marquee that advertised DJ FLATBREAD. I was really looking forward to some of his doughy beats.  But I don't come to you for this, I love you for brunch and getting together with a few friends after work for drinks and dinner. Brunch is so delightful as you can always accommodate us, and I really love your breakfast bowls. Also, Steigel Radler is the perfect brunch drink. Pretzel buns? Equal yum! And yes, you do have a lot of beers, a lot which are good, and some which are not so good. This might just be that I hate fruili with a passion.  Your servers are nice! Your rooftop patio though, does that seat 10 people? One day perhaps I will be able to snag a spot, but it will probably be in February.  Keep on trucking, 1410.  Review #23 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge"}
{"text":"1410 is noisy. The later, the noisier it becomes - my ears were generally deafened out after a couple of hours there.  1410 is inexpensive, with reasonable portion size and actually not bad a variety. Food quality varies, also, generally being around 3/5.  1410 is truly a \"world beer house\", there is a lot of beers to choose from! Though I was hitting the \"sorry we're out of it right now\" from time to time.  1410 is invariably packed - finding a table was always a challenge, and there are always people touching your back while trying to squeeze between the closely packed tables.  1410 is easy to find, and there is plenty of free parking spots just uphill - which is a good thing for the downtown pub.  1410 is one of my good friends' preferred watering hole, and though I don't think it may be \"my\" preferred pub, it is still perfectly ok to drop in."}
{"text":"Went in on a Monday afternoon for lunch.  Our server was very knowledgeable about the beers.  I tried to order a half stout and half WR raspberry but she says she'd have to charge me for 2 beers, so I passed on that.  I tried to order the Mill St. lemon tea beer and they were out.  My 3rd choice, a Pumphouse Blueberry Ale they did have thankfully.      Lunch was delicious, I had a grilled chicken with strawberry aioli and guacamole.  Very tasty.     Overall it was a generally pleasant experience.  No \"wow\" factor, but a nice place on 17th that is missing the snooty seventeenth server attitude."}
