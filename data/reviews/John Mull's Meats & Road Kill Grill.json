{"text":"Love this place.  My favorite is the brisket but we always get a variety of meats and sides.  Also the butcher shop is great. I love to go during the holidays, the lines are long and the place is packed to the gills but it is now my holiday tradition.  The best place to get a whole skin on pork belly!!!"}
{"text":"Been getting 'Q here for a while, but had not indulged in any sides as I like to do my own.  No more!  The mac and Cheese was some of the best I've had in quite a while...certainly the best I've had from any LV BBQ joint...and THE BEANS WERE INSANELY GOOD."}
{"text":"We were taking the puppy to the vet and used the DDD app, and found \"Road Kill Cafe\".  The staff could not have been more welcoming! They heard me mention it was my birthday and they had the whole staff and everyone inside the shop sing and gave me a piece of apple cobbler on the house.  Then we came outside to sit and eat and oh my god! This has to be the best BBQ I have ever had! Literally ever. We tried everything on the menu, or at least some of everything. The ribs and the brisket and pulled pork are necessary! The guys inside, Trey and everyone are amazing. The sides are phenomenal too! Definitely get the mac and cheese and cole slaw! It's a little bit of a trek off the strip, but 1000000000% worth it! Make sure you try the cobblers too!!!"}
{"text":"Once you figure out the system of ordering and getting your food, you are rewarded with some great bbq. We had ribs, sausage, tri-tip along with Mac and cheese, slaw, beans and greens. Nice smokey flavor, sauces are wonderful!  Did not like the tri-tip but they were out of brisket so I could have been disappointed. The corn bread is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I have always lived in the Henderson and the southwest side of Vegas . now that our family had bought a house in the northwest area I'm always trying to venture out and fine new places for us to dine at. This place I have to say was an amazing find, a little hidden and at first was a little apprehensive because of that but now that I look back on the dining experience there it just adds to the curiosity of the whole event.we had the pulled pork sandwiches, hot links,with green beans, mac and cheese,and an extra side of the macaroni salad . Everything was to die for amazing. I highly recommend the restaurant along with checking out on buying some meat to grill at home their prices are fantastic."}
{"text":"John Mulls is your one stop shop for BBQ and fresh meats! The atmosphere is just like you're barbecuing in your own backyard! You can enjoy a meal with your family and friends, even strangers. Their cured meats are amazing too! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"If you're in town and you have a car and you're in the neighborhood by all means stop by and eat at their roadkill chuckwagon.   However, if you live here and you want the best meat poultry pork in town this is your place. It's a butcher shop. You won't believe this place.   I went over today and got two ribeyes but they're prepared to cater for 4000 people.   If you're thinking about a Super Bowl party with ribs chicken brisket and sides this is definitely the place.   They are so busy the product turns over incredibly fast. It's incredibly fresh. And the ribeye I just ate was the best anywhere."}
{"text":"Did not see the episode of triple D, but I can understand why it was featured! A very strange arrangement of combo take-away restaurant and meat market. Both were equally busy although a line steadily grew as the lunch hour came and went on Friday. There is really only enough room for a handful of people to get inside. The line extends down the building in the burgeoning Vegas heat. Get there early for lunch!  Menu boards tell you all you need to know: one, two or three meat combos featuring typical smoked delicacies with choice of sides. Portions are large for the reasonable price. I tried the pulled chicken (awesome) and rib tips (savory), beans (exquisite - if that be said about beans) and slaw. Some of my compatriots tried the triple meat and were defeated. BBQ sauce is smokey or sweet-heat. Both excellent! Corn bread was good as well!  A couple of servers take orders and hand them in at the counter. Your name is called and order confirmed as it is portioned into a take away container. This process is actually smooth and efficient plus you get a chance to interact with the staff who all seem to have a great sense of humour!  Meal and drink in hand, head outside again to one of the covered eating areas and prepare to dig in!   As previously described, food was delicious and, of course, all together too much! Caution: Meat Coma Inducing!!  Worth the short drive from the strip! Get there!!"}
{"text":"Visited the location, for the first time yesterday. Ordered the three meat meal. The BBQ was decent. Up until i found a small strand of hair on my brisket.  Recommend Roadkill Grill get hair-nets for their staff. May try the place again.  Ribs were ok."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner tonight and it was to be desired. My boyfriend and I have been here before because he loves it however I will not be back after tonight.  1. I ordered 2 biscuits but was given cornbread instead. 2. I ordered peach cobbler and was given a mushy apple cobbler, despite the lid being labeled \"P\" for peach. 3. I was given a double serving of macaroni and cheese despite ordering a single serving of macaroni salad. 4. My mom ordered cornbread and was given no biscuit or cornbread.  It takes us 20 minutes to get to this place and unfortunately we didn't realize that the order was incredibly wrong until we got home and by then they had closed for the night. This was totally disappointing, it's not that hard to get an order correct. I will not be back nor will I recommend this place again. They only get 2 stars instead of 1 because my boyfriend still likes their barbeque."}
{"text":"First thing they ask you is how thick you want the meat to be cut. Its all cut just for you and not some plastic display packaging. Always best quality meats that taste good and cook well. I can no loger go anywhere place to purchase meat."}
{"text":"I lovvvvvveeeeee this place. Kind of hard to find, but worth it. Everything is sooooo good. I'm from the south, and this is the best BBQ I have found here!"}
{"text":"This place has the best BBQ in Las Vegas! The staff is 5 star as well but I wish they still gave out FREE beer :-) haha"}
{"text":"It's an experience.  One of the best bbq's ever. Guy was right. Staff was very friendly and funny."}
{"text":"Omg... Barbecue to die for. . I have eaten in the best barbecue joints in the country and the road kill rule is right up there with the best of the best.. I had the pulled pork and it was really good.the staff is friendly and when I first came thru the door one of the employees gave me a sample of the homemade sausage.... It was delicious.... I will return!!!!!"}
{"text":"When in Vegas, craving for bbq, this is the place to go to. Ribs, tri-tip, brisket a must have for me. So tender licking good."}
{"text":"After reading some previous negative reviews, I felt obligated to tell what a great experiance I had here. Yes its in an older area, but being a native to Las Vegas, there is nothing to be afraid of here. I found the people there friendly and super helpful. We recieved some fun tips on the meat we purchased....which was delicious...Beautiful bone in ribeye, some brats, and killer bacon.  SO YUMMY!"}
{"text":"This is one stop I have to do wile coming to Las Vegas and let me tell you I'm glad I did the food was  great the costumer service was amazing they make sure I was well take care off  also It was a hot day and they have Free bottle water for all the people wile we wait and they keep giving us rib tips wile they fill our order like I said great place great BBQ and A+ costumer service"}
{"text":"Amazing food. The lines can get pretty long but its worth the wait. The burnt ends and mac and cheese my personal favorite. I've also had their brisket, ribs, rib tips, and pulled pork. All of them were on point. If you make it out on a tuesday or thursday, they also serve tri-tip."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best BBQ place in town. Staff was very friendly and really nice. Props to Chuck who gave my brothers and I a tour of the place. Amazing what they do there! You would have never known a place like this exist in the neighborhood but it does! Despite the construction, we will be back for sure! Great food! Great people!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable I can't believe I didn't know about this place!!  Best barbecue in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Not bad but most of the food items are not cooked on the spot. The pulled pork taste better than the brisket in my opinion. Queue was relatively long given that it was already 130 pm on a weekday afternoon."}
{"text":"The best bbq in vegas! Overall great experience! Awesome ambiance for a bbq place! Love that its in the middle of no where. The spicy bbq sauce is super spicy but the food doesn't really require it. One downside, the brisket was dry but, Great service, excellent location and amazing food!"}
{"text":"OMG!  Made the Bbq place my favorite.  My husband and I ordered a 3 meat meal w/2 sides, portions were very generous, that one meal was more than enough for both of us."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about the meat the cuts the friendly staff and overall the only real butcher shop in Las Vegas, my family has gotten their meat here back when it was referred to as \"The Ranch\" by many locals the 60's and 70's. The meat is the best you can have it cut your way. Keep up the LV legacy Chuck & Nina"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this!!!! We came early to avoid the lines and it was above and beyond what I expected the food is delicious!!!!!! The ribs and brisket was amazing and the sides from the Mac n cheese to the cornbread is heavenly.  It started to get crowded and sharing picnic tables got a little wierd but I didn't care I was to focused on the food and when we were going to come back thank god I don't live to far!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!  I don't buy meat at the grocery store anymore because you simply can't after experiencing the incredible quality, the staff that is helpful and friendly and the fun atmosphere.  The butcher is an artist, really, you don't see people waiting and looking at their phones, they're watching a master at work, thank you!  The variety of products is endless, minus today's visit, my husband and I try and buy a new item each time. I can't emphasize this enough, you must go and buy your meat for your next BBQ, Monday night dinner or whatever.  We are forever changed! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for some bbq.  Went on a Monday right around 12.  Only about 5 people ahead of me in line.  The line moved pretty quick.  I had the 2 meat with brisket and pulled pork with baked beans and Mac n cheese.  The highlights were the brisket and the baked beans.  The beans were not the common recipe and had some kind of meat and tasted like green peppers as well.  It was a nice flavor.  The brisket was fork tender and had a good flavor.  The pulled pork was good but not my favorite.  The meat had a strong smoke flavor. Perhaps smoked with mesquite or hickory, not sure exactly.  There's plenty of outdoor seating but I opted to take it home.  They take cash or credit and are very direct but friendly."}
{"text":"If you are visiting Vegas, Rent a car, go here! DO IT!! if you live in Vegas, you are lucky to get to go here whenever you want. Best BBQ I have ever eaten. They know what they are doing on that pit. Sides are all home made and delicious! They sale their rubs and BBQ sauce too."}
{"text":"Well worth the drive!  Such a cool experience.  Being walked through the kitchen then exit to the smokers where you can admire the art of bbq done right."}
{"text":"Services was unfriendly.  No BBQ sauce on the table.  I ate my sandwich dry.  No where near true Texas BBQ."}
{"text":"We had a catered dinner for about 70 people. The menu included brisket that melted in your mouth, the best mac and cheese I've ever eaten in my life, and baked beans that I really, really enjoyed. It wasn't just me. Everyone enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"One of the best hidden restaurants in Vegas that was featured on The Food Network (wall is signed by Guy Fieri from Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives).  This place was highly recommended by locals when we moved to the area and we finally got a chance to check it out today. We found the spot last night, but it was closed and what a surprise!!  We thought the GPS was not working correctly since it had us in the midst a rural residential area complete with horses across the street and this appeared to be some type of ranch.  We decided to try it out for lunch and once again we were struck by the rural surroundings complete with a gravel driveway.  There is nothing fancy about this place, but it still attracts crowds (like a down-home bbq).  The lot was crowded and the \"Grub Shack\" (outside eating area with water misters..woohoo) was full! We ordered at the small inside counter / butcher shop area that was packed with customers as well as employees bustling around taking  & filling orders and our wait was still only about 15 minutes...the pulled pork (sauce had nice spicy kick to it) was the best I've had since coming to this area and the beef brisket was tender & juicy \"cooked to perfection\"; the mac & cheese had too much of something so I wouldn't order that again, but the portions and the inexpensive prices make this a spot that we recommend & will bring out of town guests to visit as well."}
{"text":"I love this place. I ordered catering for a party, and when I went to pick it up everyone was so friendly. The place smelled absolutely amazing. While they were packing my catering order, they went over every items with me twice to ensure I received everything I ordered.  I couldn't get over how awesome this place smelled. After my order was loaded in my car, I parked and went in to get some food to go. The smell did it. Let me tell you, it was heaven.  Meat seasoned and cooked to perfection. Side dishes were perfect. I am running out of adjectives! It's one of those places you have to try for yourself.  Btw- the catering  meals were top notch. I WILL be back."}
{"text":"Real deal down home bbq. The people that work here are laid back and cool. Yes, it was on DDD, and yes, Guy found a gem here. Us locals love it and so do many out of towners lately since the show aired. But we are all good with that! : )"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful! Pulled pork is definitely my favorite. I'm huge into BBQ and this food is comparable to food you'd find in Nashville, TN. I wouldn't go to any other place in Vegas for some slow cooked meats."}
{"text":"This was actually recommended to us by the Food Network on Diners, Drive Ins, & dive. . The food was pretty good I had the pulled pork. I ordered a 2 meat combo with the ribs & chicken. The sides were okay I don't really care for baked beans so I ordered some mac and cheese. The mac and cheese was very delicious. The pulled pork could have used a little bit more sauce but it was very tender and delicious. The chicken wasn't that great it was lacking flavor may be my personal preference. The ribs were very delicious I would definitely recommend going there. The staff is the reason why I gave it a 3 they are very unfriendly but I am sure it can be due to the high heat that they have to withstand waiting outside to take your order . It can get very very hot in Vegas so I would probably be cranky too working in hundred degree weather waiting for people to order food. If you're tired of the buffets in Vegas this is definitely worth the drive to head out for some BBQ ."}
{"text":"Drove out for some BBQ at a friends recommendation while visiting Vegas. WOW, the food is really really great. We are not BBQ experts but everything was superb and although I am not a mac n cheese person, the mac n cheese is outstanding. We will certainly come back again when in the area. This is a cool out of the way little place with great food"}
{"text":"AWESOME AWESOME  FOOD.  favorite BBQ place. My husband has know The John Mulls Family for years and they are such wonderful people."}
{"text":"Always the best choice! No matter whether the question is butcher shop or BBQ - just beware, Saturdays can get a long line going, so get there early!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this BBQ joint while in Vegas, loved the food! Portions were huge. The hot links & rib tips were excellent, loved the mac & cheese. If in the area I would definitely recommend :)"}
{"text":"It's a pretty good BBQ please the links are great but the ribs are smoked good taste I just wish they had options the staff is really nice and the owner is a great person in real life he will actually come up to you and ask how's your day going I recommend it to the people who love BBQ"}
{"text":"MAD MAD LOVE for this place. Everything is cooked just right. Sauce is very good, hot links are the best! The 3 meat plate is enough for 2 people unless you don't like sharing. Outdoor seating. So glad I didn't miss this place. I'll come back! Keep the grill hot!!"}
{"text":"Get the 3 meat combo with real mac n chesse.  Great potato salad and beans.   Get plenty of meat (taking extra home).  In residential neighborhood on an open lot.  Done outside under cover.  This is something to check out if you ate in North Las Vegas."}
{"text":"No food is worth that. Waited 45 min from the time i gave my order til i had food in my hand. And the meat is just sitting in pre cooked containers. That long to just tag and bag food is just wow. Can tell the guy bagging hates his job. I hate his job too. Food was ok but would never ever come back."}
{"text":"So I wanted to make short ribs and I checked out the normal markets and it was $10+ for not even a pound. So I decided to call three of the top butcher shops both charged the same $10+ a pound and I got a quote for $6.79 a pound the best deal I could find!   I didn't even know this place existed till today! They have all kinds of meats and cuts for reasonable prices, I'm def. Gonna grab some rib eyes next time.   Most of the reviews are for the bbq food (which I'm gonna try soon also) thought I'd post my review on the butcher side! The staff was awesome and you could tell the guy cutting the meat took pride in his craft!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! We came from Utah on vacation and saw it had been on triple D. And decided to try it! We were not disappointed! Good variety of meat and yummy Mac and cheese! A definite must if your visiting vegas and want to get away from the strip."}
{"text":"I'll preface this by saying I have never eaten at the Road Kill Grill side so this is just for the butcher.  We picked up a couple of rib eye steaks for our Valentine's Dinner this year and they were the most amazing steaks we have had in a very long time. The service was quick and helpful. I really appreciated being able to pick the thickness of our steaks as well. It's odd that it is in a residential neighborhood, I thought I was lost at first! But I really like having a real butcher here in North Las Vegas. Would definitely recommend them to a friend."}
{"text":"Great food! Went to this place for lunch today. I ordered the rib tips, with potato salad, beans, and cornbread.  I have had bbq around the country and this ranks near the very best. The employees were courteous and friendly.   I was in uniform and they  unexpectedly comped my meal.  Thank you so much for that.  You made my day and I will pay it forward!  I will be coming again!"}
{"text":"I agree with Mike m. Also service is on the low side, it seems they are big headed with their new found success."}
{"text":"Since this place was featured on Diners, Drive-In, and Dives and not to fare from my house I thought I would give it a try. I order the hot food and it wasn't all that. I've had way better!!!! I've had BBQ from Chicago & Texas this place isn't even in the same ball park. But I would say this is the best Las Vegas has to offer."}
{"text":"Best BBQ around in Vegas!! Larry and Celita were amazing! The whole staff was awesome. Very very impressed! Great great place! My new favorite!"}
{"text":"I have been trying to  get some fresh meat from this place. It was an ok place nothing special. Prices are ok!  We did not buy a lot and took forever!  but worth the wait because they are fresh meats."}
{"text":"Let me start off at, this place is awesome! Don't hate me but I'm the kind of person who doesn't really care for bbq. But one day my fiancé took me here after work for lunch and amazing!  We're from Hawaii and this place reminds us of home, how it's so laid back, everyone is friendly! They have their dining area outside. Now when you go in for your food it's a small place, it reminds me of standing in line for school lunch. The owner is very friendly, he made a plate of bbq spareribs and handed it to the first person in line and it went down the line, everyone tried it and loved it. It was someone's birthday and he called up one of the employees and they all just starting singing happy birthday. The girl that was working the register was hilarious, she was amazing. Making us laugh and just having fun.  I had the bbq pulled pork, polish sausage with the sweet potato and Cole slaw...and omg! It was ono (delicious) my fiancé had the bbq ribs, I believe roast pork, mac n cheese n sweet potatoes. We both got the corn bread, we wanted the whole bag they had. That was amazing too! We also had to get the apple cobbler, we loved it we want to go back just to buy the peach cobbler.  If you love bbq or just like me, who doesn't care for bbq, you have to, I mean have to, try this place out! It's in a neighborhood, which makes it feel homey. You're gonna enjoy it!"}
{"text":"The food is okay. We got rib tips and hot links. Nothing special. In fact I would call the food average and basic. Also we ordered some meat from the butcher. The service was terrible and unorganized. Won't be going back and I'm not sure why anyone else returns."}
{"text":"best of the best so far. i came here on the whim of wanting to try really really good BBq, and even though some people seemed to have such high expectations for such a small place i thought i'd ignore the negative people and go with my gut :).  and it did pay off, i was so in love with the cuts of meat and the sides that i didn't even care how hot outside was. the food was awesome and the workers there were very sweet. My dad meet the owner, the one that was shown on the food networks triple D, he was a real sweet guy and was enthusiastic about talking to all the customers.  what you should try is the pulled pork and chicken, the sausages  are really good. as well as the bake beans an the green beans.  give this place a go. i would suggest have a  GPS system because it would be difficult going on your own. BUT! eat here, it was worth it for me."}
{"text":"Don't. Waste your time, ribs were totally dry, like they were cooked yesterday, long wait, will say sides were very good!! Just tastes like ribs were massed produced not juicy not barbecued crust, not smokey flavor, the packaged ones I throw on the grill are much better!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The food and staff is so awesome! Everyone should make time to stop here. Every time we are in Vegas we will definitely stop here!!!"}
{"text":"Been twice, neither was as expected.   First time, huge wait as expected. Food wasn't ready. When it did come out thirty minutes later, it was all cold.  Fooled me twice. Went back today for a second chance. No wait, ordered a the meat mall. Went to pick it up, not ready. Waited over thirty minutes, got home and I only got half my order. Had missing sides and only two meats.   Not going back. Thanks"}
{"text":"Good food with good portion sizes. Either take out or can eat st picnic tables outside. I had ribs and pulled pork. Both were very good. The sides, mac and cheese and green beans, were also good."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in town and therefore it is busy! They move you through as fast as they can, and it's totally worth the wait but be prepared. I tend to get it to-go, but they have benches and people eat there. On the weekends they normally serve outside and during the week, they serve inside the deli area. Ribs are the best by far."}
{"text":"Delicious BBQ! I was here about a week ago, there's a bit of a line but it's worth the wait. Great selections of meat and sides. Great portions for the price. It's more like a to go type place, unless you like to sit outside in the Vegas. They offer a seated area with misters (light water sprinklers), and picnic tables and benches. Great customer service. We will be returning."}
{"text":"One of my favorite BBQ places in town. We have very few to choose from here, and this is usually at the top of the list.   I feel like the quality has been slipping a bit lately, but even so.. still one of the best.   Depending on what time you go, expect to wait in a pretty long line..  I guess this place isn't so secret anymore."}
{"text":"Awesome food and exceptional service. Arrived 3 min before closing, and when they ran out of what I ordered (1 customer ahead of me)...the meal was on the house."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about John Mull's!  The food is exceptionally yummy, the prices are very fair for the quantity and quality of food, and even the atmosphere itself is a really nice departure from the ho-hum chain restaurants we're used to in Vegas.  Summertime can be a little uncomfortable since all the seating is outside, but over the past couple of years they've done a really good job of adding more shade to the seating areas.   If I would knock them for one thing it would be the wait.  Since their food is so phenomenal, this place is very very busy, especially on the weekends... and they often only have 1 or 2 people serving up the orders.  They could easily use 2 or 3 more people doing that, to keep us from having to wait so long for our food.  But I won't dock them a star for that.  They still deserve 5 stars because by far, John Mull's is the BEST bbq in Vegas."}
{"text":"Went to this place to get my mule deer processed. While we were waiting around filling out some paperwork the guy gave me and my buddies 4 boxes of BBQ for free! It was so good I could see myself going there at least every week. If you're in the area do your self a favor and check them out!"}
{"text":"Some of the BEST BBQ I've had since living in Oakland, CA!! Soo much food! Love the Mac n Cheese--it's the real deal! You won't be sorry if you take a little drive to this little gem!"}
{"text":"This place rocked. My dad saw it on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives, and it was well worth the trip. Ate pulled pork, chicken, hot links and chorizo, and had mac n cheese, and the awesome green beans which were cooked with pork...so damn good!!! We bought pulled pork, hot links, chicken breast and salmon to grill..everything was tasty, and seemed fresh and clean. I asked a guy that worked there where they get the meat and he said various places, but a lot form Southern Utah. I don't know how the animals were raised (organically, hormone free) but intend to ask next time I go. They even give you two dozen free eggs with a purchase over $50 at the market. Great place!!"}
{"text":"I got the 3 may combo with ribs, pulled pork, and brisket with sides of Mac and cheese and potato salad. I was debating on getting the hot link because that is what I saw them make on diners drive ins and dives and that's what made me want to try this place. The pulled pork had sauce mixed in already which I'm not a fan of. I like to taste the flavor of the pork before sauce is added. The meat should be able to stand alone. The ribs were on point. They were tender with a good smoke flavor. The brisket was disappointing. I feel like it was cooked with liquid smoke which is like a short cut to smoke meat. The potato salad was good but to me the star was the Mac and cheese. It was creamy and I tasted like three different kinds of cheese. I wish I would have got a double side of it. They have tri tip on Tuesdays and Thursdays for anyone planning to go. I wish I went there on one of those days because I'm a East coast guy and you can't find tri tip any where out there. So whenever I get the chance I get tri tip wherever I go."}
{"text":"This place is a hole in the wall serving some of the best bar-b-que around. I have repeatedly had their pulled pork sandwiches and cheesy macaroni.  It's fantastic.  The ONLY reason that i don't rate it 5 stars is because the service is a wee bit slow.  It's originally a butcher shop - and remains so - with a restaurant business on the side.  They are however, great folks and chat you up while your waiting.    Go eat there, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Vegas, hands down. Good homestyle food, southern hospitality, very fair pricing. Come on down and you'll be back! So delicious. Any of these less than 5 star reviews are just trolls that are used to Famous Lame's BBQ, lol."}
{"text":"Although the location and set up at this place is unappealing, the meat is delicious. The sides weren't anything that blew my mind but thr Tri Tip sandwich was pretty good. If you are looking for mind blowing BBQ check out Rollin Smoke... it is to die for!"}
{"text":"Always shop for all my meat products here. N The food is absolutely the best. Tri tips are outstanding."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!!! Best brisket, great prices and fun atmosphere for lunch. Wish the hours were longer, but definitely worth the stop!"}
{"text":"The BBQ here is delish! I just don't like the seating very picnic like I mean if you don't mind eating outside in the dirt than its fine but what matters is the food and it's great."}
{"text":"Food is just AMAZING! Ribs tender and meaty everything is flavorful, Mac and cheese has down home flavor potato salad just as great!!! The staff is so warm and amazing!!! Can't wait to visit again on our next Vegas visit!"}
{"text":"My favorite thing to eat is the pulled pork. Thought he spicy barbecue sauce is not spicy enough to earn the name spicy. The mac and cheese has an amazing sauce. The best part was that they have a free sample. 5/5"}
{"text":"Without GPS you'd never find the place. Even with GPS I thought it was my first Apple maps wild goose chase until I practically drove past it. Why is this in a residential area?   But it was worth the \"treasure hunt\". Everything was good. Not over the top great...just good enough to want to come back for more.    The service was extremely slow. But then again, this is a butcher shop that sells some food. Its not really a restaurant. Which also explains why they close at six. Or is that because they are in a residential area?"}
{"text":"The press and TV this modest butcher shop bbq joint is getting is well justified.  I realize the hot links and ribs put chuck on the map but his pulled pork, roasted chicken and brisket are worth the trip as well.  Chuck and Nita run a great shop, they have added a grub shack outside for you to eat your food once you get through the hot line inside.  I enjoyed the sides as well it seems each side has a special ingredient thus nothing is just average.  i have watched chuck on the saw with the meats and also watched him grind his own gr beef, not to go to the supermarket for those pieces parts any more.  I plan on having Chuck supply the man cave for the football season coming up for sure"}
{"text":"Couldn't wait to come and try everything out. Everything was awesome! We got the brisket dinner with mac an cheese and baked beans, an the Rib tip dinner with green beans and mac an cheese. Service was friendly and fast. Only problem it was so hot outside in the sitting area we ate in the car."}
{"text":"The food here is always right. This is the kind of whole in the wall that you will hate yourself for not knowing about sooner. The service is not always stellar, their always busy so it's not the fastest either. However, once you bite down into the ribs you just dipped in their home made bbq sauce nothing else will matter. It's the type of taste that will make you close your eyes, and just hum good stuff, and thoughts. Always go with the corn bread, I also recommend their macaroni as a side. You must try the ribs along with everything else on their menu, I heard you can get by without the chicken so I haven't tried it yet but I will next time."}
{"text":"It's standard BBQ.  The pulled pork and the mac and cheese are the highlights, along with an excellent sauce (the spicy is just right). But, beware of dryness!   Both the ribs and the brisket were unacceptably dry, sure the sauce helped some, but not much. It may be because the brisket is so thinly sliced, but it made me drink a lot more water than I'd like.   Its fine if you live close, but don't make a special trip. If you work down by the strip like me, Rollin Smoke is a better, closer option."}
{"text":"We've yet to try the restaurant, but after a friend brought over some of the hot links we were hooked. The husband stopped and bought a bunch the next week. They're now always in our freezer and a go to for dinners."}
{"text":"Best bbq place hands down!!!! Ive been here twice I get the 3 meat plate with double mac its so much that I always have lots of lwdtover for later!  If you are in Vegas and love bbq THIS is the spot. There is a bit of a wait but totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Great staff, great food! Get the ribs and mac n cheese! Im not a huge fan of the brisket since I was spoiled with Central Texas BBQ but its not bad. Hot links are good too and the spicy bbq sauce is sooo good!"}
{"text":"Can NEVER go wrong at this place. Food is so good, meats are cooked right and the sides are great. Depends on what meal you get but it will last."}
{"text":"When you pull up to a restaurant and there are people standing in line around the corner in 110 degree heat... You know this is going to be something special.  This place is hands down the best BBQ I have had in Las Vegas and to be honest, better than most BBQ I have had in the nation. I have been working my way through the menu and have yet to find anything I didn't like.  Definitely the place to go if you are craving BBQ!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed with this place.  The sausage was good, but the potato salad was not.  The brisket was not really brisket.  It was oven baked roast beef that was not marinaded, rubbed, smoked, or barbecued, but was sliced blah and BBQ sauce poured over it after.  Lucille's and Dickey's are way better."}
{"text":"all i can say is go with a huge appetite.  the food portions are huge and priced right.  we had the 3 meat combo;  brisket, hot link and pulled pork with  mac and cheese and potato salad  yummy.  with extra sauce.  bonus!!!  saw this place on dinners drive inns and dives and had to try it.  glad we did and will go again to las vegas."}
{"text":"I'm from Texas so its hard to find any good brisket other than Texas but I think the road kill grill came pretty darn close! My husband and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Vegas, without a doubt. If you go at luncthime, plan to wait 30 minutes. Your best bet it to call ahead, order, and then sit at the picnic tables with your to-go bag. Very friendly staff also. They like to make fun of each other, so when you are waiting, it's entertaining."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Nevada. Brisket, rib tips, Pulled pork or chicken, and you MUST get some of the Mac and Cheese."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time and money!!!  were approximately 15 people in line waiting outside, took us almost an hour to get inside and ordered from buffet line. We ordered 3 meal combo: chicken, ribs and brisket, food was tasteless no smoking taste at all, meat was dry and chicken cooked in an oven, meat taste like was broiled in a water with some smoking spices added I had better BBQ food in a regular supermarket."}
{"text":"I'm from St.Louis Mo. I saw this place on Diners Drive Ins and Dives so I figured when I visit Las Vegas I would check it out. I put the address in my gps and it took me there . This place is not much to look at from the outside but the food is worth the trip. I ordered a combo plate with ribs and pulled pork. The ribs were meaty and tender and the pulled pork was very good. My sides were macaroni & cheese and baked beans both were good. Also had apple cobbler it was just like moms. Portions were generous and prices were reasonable. My wife and I both agreed the food was great. When I come back to Vegas I will make a return visit to Roadkill."}
{"text":"Was there last week.  Had the pulled chicken and brisket with potato salad and Mac & cheese.  Well worth the drive.  You have to eat outside so dress cool."}
{"text":"I love John Mulls food!  They have great meats, especially the ribs!  All the meat is delicious,  I love the sides too!  Yams, greens, those baked beans and that potato salad!  I drive way across town to get my fix on.#Fiya"}
{"text":"Neat place. Looks the part. Service was good, I didn't have to wait long, I assume because it was an hour before closing on a Tuesday. Everyone was helpful and friendly. No complaints there.  The sides were pretty good I guess. The BBQ was really bad if I'm being honest. I ordered 3 meat meal. Brisket, pulled pork, ribs. I also ordered a side of burnt ends.   Brisket: it almost tasted boiled with a smoke flavored addon.   Pulled pork: had a really strange and strong Vinegar flavor. Almost completely vinegar.   Ribs: they tasted good for the most part. Wasn't blown away by any means. They were tender  Burnt ends: these were definitely cooked the best of all the meats I ordered however they were too sweet for me.   Baked beans: awesome flavor. Nice hint of either jalapeño or green peppers but not spicy.   Mac/cheese: tasted like it had been sitting too long  Cobblers: cherry/Apple: these were ok. Could have used more crust. The filling tasted like it came from a can. Not a huge deal to me, just didn't feel like anything unique.   I feel the place has the look and service but lacks in quality.  All the 5star reviews just don't really make sense to me. I have heard after the fact from a friend that it use to be better. I have had better meals at chain BBQ joints at the same or less price. Doubt I will be back and definitely wouldn't bring visitors from out of town there."}
{"text":"Has to be the best quality,  taste and price BBQ in Vegas! Staff are so kind too... Thank you!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to this bbq place off the show Diners, Drive-in & Dives. We were excited as we had just had Rollin Smoke the day before. We were both left very disappointed. It wasn't awful but definitely was not on the same level or even close to Rollin Smoke. The sauce was not good and the meats had NO SMOKE FLAVOR. The brisket was in some sort of broth... what's that about? We are from Cincinnati and both love great bbq as we've had bbq 3 days in a row. I'm writing this review on the 3rd day sitting at Rollin Smoke ready to eat great food!"}
{"text":"I've been in Vegas for 10 yrs , before i found mull's meats , thanks to my fellow yelpers.  I've gone the past couple Saturday's . I have ordered the bacon which they slice to order and it is some of the best bacon I have eaten, it is very meaty,IMO taste more like ham not the chemical taste like some commercial bacon. I also got porter house steak cut at 1 1/2 inches , huge steaks it was very tender even though, I over cooked mine I like my steaks med rare, belive me I'm still sick about that. I also got 2 lbs of Korean style ribs it was very tender, I have to buy again too make sure it was not a fluke, I've made kal bi for years and it was never this tender . I got  a 5 lb shoulder clod to smoke and it was tender. I'm thinking this is the cut they use for roast beef and italin beef sandwichs , not much fat but tender might b good for teriyaki beef also. I also got a turkey breast  nothing special frozen commercial and hot links have not tried yet. Prices are reasonable, about the same price as chain grocerie store,unless there's a sale then chains win , but the quality not as good as John mulls. This place is out of the way for me , but it is worth the drive :) low carb heaven"}
{"text":"It's all been said. If you like BBQ look no further. Arrive EARLY or be prepared to stand in line.  Don't expect Atmosphere as there are Picnic Tables outside. But do go hungry or even consider splitting a plate with their large servings."}
{"text":"Stopped in Saturday and picked up a 11/2\" rib steak. It was extra special with old fashioned flex of fat running through it. It was very juicy and delicious. I also got some ground round and made wonderful lean and juicy med-rare burgers with it. They also make their own lunch meats.  I got a lb. of chopped ham sliced for sandwiches. It seemed lower on salt and fat than most, and made great sandwiches."}
{"text":"Awesome food! A bit unconventional, also a butcher shop (wish I lived here!). FYI, even the sides were incredible! I had combo with brisket and (pork) ribs, potato salad and collard greens...will have the rest for dinner tonight"}
{"text":"Ok. But a little to salty and tuff for our tastes. Long line up takes a good qhile to get served. Long drive from the strip"}
{"text":"The food was fine, good stuff..the staff was disinterested, not helpful, and rude. Because of the lack of a welcoming atmosphere and nice folks acting nice we won't be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited Vegas for our second anniversary and planned ahead to make Road Kill Grill one of our stops. We read various reviews and were prepared for all of the quirks which added to the charm and experience. We are not acclimated to the 104 degree temperature in Vegas so we planned to pick up the food and take it back to the hotel.  It was about 8 miles away from our hotel and worth the time it took to make the trip. I had a hot link and ribs with mac and cheese and green beans. The portion size is good and the food was really good. We will definitely go back next year. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I dropped off a deer on Dec 8.  The gentlemen told me it would be ready in just a few days.  I called back the following weekend and the woman who answered said it still wasn't ready.  Today, Dec 22 (2 weeks later) I called at 9 AM.  The woman this time told me she was too busy to even check and see if my deer was ready, and that I should call back at 3 PM.  How unprofessional?  I live nearly an hour away so dropping by isn't really an option for me.  I will not return to this business."}
{"text":"Picked up a two piece combo, the brisket and ribs, potato salad and Mac n cheese, and corn bread of course.  Again....nothing but perfection.  Also the service was so friendly and great, like always.  Here's the thing...in theory the folks here could all be horrible people and give the worst service and I WOULD STILL COME BACK FOR THE FOOD!!!  But the great people that work here are crazy nice and helpful, I dare you to leave here without feeling like your day just got a little brighter.  I also picked up a couple pounds of pork belly.  There isn't a better butcher in the valley with a greater selections of meats and great prices."}
{"text":"This is the place to get your raw meat. Steaks, ribs, chicken or hot links. This place is amazing. Call in your order & they have it ready when you need it(usually next day for me). Nita is efficient & super nice. This place is your go to butcher."}
{"text":"The BEST hot links EVER! If you love good BBQ, you have to stop at John Mull's Meats & Road Kill Grill just off the strip in Las Vegas. Casual outdoor seating under a patio with a gravel driveway - not much to look at but you feel like you are having BBQ at a friend's house. But wait - for me, it's all about the taste and this place kills it! Brisket, pulled pork, chicken - but no matter what - you must try the hot links in their homemade BBQ sauce. Don't forget to walk into the onsite butcher shop and pick up some rubs to bring that flavor home with you."}
{"text":"This place was amazing, off the beaten path and friendly staff! The best BBQ i've had so far in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"I heard about Road Kill on DD&D and since my favorite was Buzz's BBQ and they closed down.  I decided to try this BBQ. I got there on a Saturday afternoon about 3:30 and figured I could be out by 5 as I had an appointment at that time. I pulled in to the parking lot and saw a long line outside waiting for food. I decided since I had driving so far I might as well try it, so I waited in line for about 45 minutes and had to take the food with as I was running out of time. They were nice as they offered free beer on Saturdays and sampled the line once with food. The food was OK but not worth standing in line for, but would I go there again , no. ."}
{"text":"Yeah this back yard style smoked meat BBQ is consistently the best.  Knowing that John Mull is a butcher adds to the fact that he knows his Q.  Nicely smoked meats, tender fall off the bone ribs in generous portions, great side items.  Do not miss the peach cobbler, it will make you cry.  Sure you have to take it away, or eat outside on a bench.  Who cares, we dont need no stinking table service!  Be aware that you have to stand in a line outside, so bring your chill attitude, it can take 20 minutes or more on a weekend.  Oh and did I mention they have free beer Saturdays while you are waiting?"}
{"text":"O....M....G this place is awesome!!!! My husband and I shared the two meat combo pulled pork, ribs.. Mac and cheese and baked beans!!! Everything was awesome!! I don't know where to begin! The pulled pork was so flavorful, the ribs were huge! Generally the sides are just there at these types of restaurants but here the Mac and cheese was so good I could have had a huge helping of that and been fine! The baked beans were just as great they were a little spicy and just added that kick! The corn bread was sweet and yummy!!!! This place is soooo excellent I can't believe that it took me this long to try it!!!"}
{"text":"Best bbq in Vegas. My wife and I had checked out every bbq place we could find and hesitated to try John mull's because it's so far out of the way. Ribs, pulled pork and brisket are good without the need to add sauce. I'm not usually one to care about sides at bbq restaurants but the green beans, potato salad and Mac n cheese are all great. I also highly recommend the bacon from meat market"}
{"text":"Went there for a double birthday lunch. Food was prorated fresh,  staff was friendly,  prices are reasonable and line was out to the parking lot. Apple cobbler was yummy. Would bet nicer if wasn't all outside though. The wind kicked up and dust was everywhere. But the brisket was still very tasty"}
{"text":"The meat was tender and juicy every time I went to take a bite I just wanted to come back for more. It was amazing but a lot of people looked  at the group I was with and I was a little uncomfortable.I highly recommend the pulled pork sandwich that's what I had.It was sweet and juicy all the chefs and people we met were really nice and helped us out even one of my group members got a picture with a chef . I will say when you get there you have to drive by people and get it line it took about 10 minutes to get our food but it was worth the wait . Just make sure to wear sun screen you might have to eat it the sun . I have no words all that could be better is they could be open 24 hrs !!!!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ I've ever had at the best price! Long wait but totally worth it! Great service from start to finish. Definitely a must when in Vegas!"}
{"text":"John Mull's is the best butcher in Las Vegas.  Prime choice meats that are masterfully butchered by professionals.  You can place your order in advance, but I like watching the artful skills and technics.  While you are there, have lunch at the Road Kill Grill.  Yummy smoked meats and sides to choose from. Kick back and relax.   They do not disappoint!  5 star Quality and service.   Mary Ann"}
{"text":"Giving it 3 start because I waited 45 min to place my order an waited another 15 for it to be ready all while standing in the sun, finally got my order sat down, the brisket was very good so was the pulled pork and the pulled chicken the ribs were just ok they were not that tender at all, it was worth the wait but i don't think I'll be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"Saw this on Dinners, Drive-Ins and Dives and were really looking forward to it. The servers were the only non-nice people we encountered in Las Vegas - it looked like they are prepared to handle long lines, but there were four small groups when we stopped by and therefore there were no need to herd us with shouts.  The food was ok, definitely was not worth the drive the price they charged. The links Guy advertised were really good the rest of the meats were missing something. And the BBQ sauce was the strangest I have ever had."}
{"text":"This place is really really really good. Probably the best ribs I've ever had. The cole slaw had a nice zing and the collard greens were the bomb. Its the perfect outdoor picnic table seating. Saw the place on tv and had to give it a go. It was worth it."}
{"text":"The best BBQ in Vegas! If you are looking for flavor and authnticity, this is the place.  You can call ahead to place your order because I've never seen this place without a line.  The customer service is top notch and even when they are working through the rush they are efficient and always have a smile.  They also have cut meats you can order for cooking up at home and the quality is worth the price.  Highly recommend! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The portions are bountiful. I got the pulled chicken with mac & cheese and baked beans. The mac & cheese is rich and cheesy, no skimping on the whole-milk ingredients in their recipe. The baked beans are good and seemed to have ground beef or pork in them, not sure which, but I didn't expect that added item. Finally, the pulled chicken was good too, I just wished it had more barbecue sauce but luckily they let you take barbecue in little containers, so I was able to douse my chicken. Anyway, this is a great bang for your buck for the amount of food and overall quality."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in town and soulfood sides are better than all the soul food places in Vegas. It's a must try at least once!!i will be back"}
{"text":"The food is crazy good!  I wanted to buy a 28 inches suitcase to full it up with their food to bring home!  But I knew I couldn't.  :(.  It sits between some houses which I thought was a little odd.  On one side you can get the prepared foods and the other side you can order meats to cook yourself at home.  They were busy but were in fast taking the orders and moving the line along.  We will definitely go there every time we are in Vegas.  There is no indoor seating, just picnic style area benches with canopy."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Food is always perfect. We always get the 3 meat combo plus 2 sides and peach cobblers. They can get packed sometimes but definitely worth the wait. We've never been disappointed in any of the dishes and we've had all of them. Overall, we highly recommend this place to anyone who wants great barbecue."}
{"text":"Hands down the best BBQ joint I've ever been to before. Best brisket in the entire world. Make sure to stop by this place next time you're in vegas if you want a meal to die for. I'll be making this place a ritual whenever I'm in vegas. Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Located in the backyard of a residential neighborhood. Wait gets long - get there early or try another day. Not mind blowing barbecue just nice family style place."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for years. The food is always amazing and the people are friendly. Love mulls!!!!"}
{"text":"World class Ribs, Pulled Pork and Mac n Cheese. Must stop when in Vegas. As seen on Diners Drive Ins and Dives. 15 min from strip. BOOKMARK AND GO!!!!!"}
{"text":"It's a must to come to this place and look for Ricky.  Awesome guy. The best place for bbq"}
{"text":"Great food, super love it!  Real authentic BBQ the best in Vegas!  Thanks for the food"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 1 star because I can't give it 0.   I met up with a specical lady friend after seeing this place on triple d.  It was nasty.   I feel like I ate a cinder block.  I might as well eaten a bag of concrete.  The BBQ sause didnt' do anything justice.  My favorite part was the cashier that was hacking a lung into the food. The wait was ridiculous, I could have hunted, killed, skinned and cooked a racoon faster.  You can have better road kill from the road kill you can run over."}
{"text":"Finally got around to trying this place after hearing my collegue talking about it. I heard they were pretty popular cause they were featured on a food network show, so it means they have to be good right?  Well after waiting in line for about 30-40 minutes to place my order I didn't know what to get so I ordered 1 of every meat. I have to say they offered a pretty big selection of bbq meats, pulled chicken, pulled pork, rib tips, pork ribs, brisket, and hot links. Unfortunately none of it really stood out. I might be crazy but while waiting in line, people who received their food were yelling about how good this was and I dont know what they are talking about. I guess I'm spoiled to have had Franklin's in Austin, Tx multiple times, but this doesn't even come close and not worth the 40 minute wait.   BBQ meats aside, this place makes, hands down, the best Mac and Cheese I've ever had. I don't know what they do but it was sent from the gods. I'll probably go back for the Mac and Cheese, but for BBQ there's only 1 place in Vegas that reigns supreme."}
{"text":"The epitomy of great bbq. I had this catered for my grad party a few years ago and people still talk about how good the food was."}
{"text":"One word...YUM! Second time here, and just as delicious as the first. I'm fromTexas and it's amazing how hard it is to find really GOOD BBQ. This place beats all my expectations. The pulled pork and brisket are spot on and the burnt ends are delicious! Add in the baked beans, authentic mac n cheese, collards and cornbread...I'm a stuffed, happy camper!"}
{"text":"Have been there twice and I give 5 stars both times! Their food is so delicious and they give you so much food. We can never eat everything on our plate. We usually share a plate and still cannot eat everything. The side items are so yummy.  The location is off the beaten path but don't let that fool you, this place is a hidden gem! The people who work there are very nice and want you to experience great food. Just so you know, there is no indoor seating though."}
{"text":"My favorite Las Vegas BBQ spot. Awesome food with great service. Make sure to ask for a tour of the restaurant."}
{"text":"The hot links are amazing! I wish I would've came here fathomed but as they close @6 we HAD to stop. Come here HUNGRY!! I got the 2 meat meal, hot links and brisket; pack on the BBQ and make yourself a BBQ sandwich. Well worth the money!  Excellent customer service; very friendly and they will give you samples (the beans are amazing)"}
{"text":"Very tasty. Just a little bit too much grease/oil than my stomach can easily handle, BUT.... it is very delicious I will go back again and recommend it whenever I'm in that area. :-)   The staff were very friendly but they had plenty of time as I had just missed the rush. :-)"}
{"text":"This BBQ joint has never disappointed. It's not the kind of place your going to sit and eat unless the weather is good because of outside seating. It is also one of the only full service butchers I have found in North Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This is the 4th time we've been here. Since we're from San Diego, we only get to come a few times a year. This is absolutely the best barbecue we have ever had. The only hard thing is having to eat outside during the summer weather in vegas, but it is so worth it. Love the food the service is very friendly. Recommend it."}
{"text":"My gf was craving(bitching and moaning) over hospital food. I could NOT take the crybaby session any longer and finally went to John Mulls for a sandwich and peach cobbler for her.  I had not been there before and began to huff and puff over the LINE. I traded in the \"session\" for the \"wait\". During the \"wait\" I observed food, sandwiches, beef brisket, pork ribs, steak, chicken OH MY. The smells were irresistible. Everyone was eating while their eyes rolled up into their heads and groans of ecstasy escaped their lips. I had to try this John Mulls meats!  The service was pleasant. A young women walked the line and took orders, by the time I got to the register my items were there waiting for me. Honestly I was just going to bite into the sandwich to discover the sensation that everyone else was experiencing.  I couldn't put the sandwich down, one savory bite after the other with sizzling juices and sauce melting the bread to a mouth watering slow motion explosion of epicurean delight. No wonder gf was into a full meltdown of a \"session\".  I stop AT John Mulls now before the trip to see my gf.  I recommend this place to all MEAT EATERS! Yum!"}
{"text":"Incredibly delicious food, awesomely friendly staff, and what a value! Highly recommend the pulled pork, beef brisket, mild and spicy sauces, mac and cheese, collards and cole slaw."}
{"text":"Holy freaking tits this place is amazing!! I wish I could give it 10 stars and I'm not even exaggerating.   My boyfriend took me here and oh my god their food was insanely good! Like bring me a straight jacket with my meal cuz I'm crazy about their food. We went on a tues, it was tri tip day and i really can't say oh my god enough. It was so flavorful and the pulled pork was perfect. I honestly can say this place ruined every other place that serves meat for me because it will never be as good as the road kill grill. You also get two sides with your meal, I opted for the green beans with pork and a potato ball in the middle (bomb as shizz) and the Mac n cheese (supa cheesy). I am not a crazy big foodie but I know good food when I eat it and this place is on point, the cats meow and every other snappy way to say EAT HERE ITS AMAZING .   The people that work here are also really nice have good customer service and they talked to us about football which was really cool. You can also get meat(goat, deer, cow, rabbit) here, eggs, cheese and probably a bunch of other amazing things that I haven't even scratched the surface of. Ohhhhh they also do jerky and as a very big fan of jerky that right there just makes me fall in love with them even more. Me and my boyfriend could not stop eating even though we were full to the brim.   If you find yourself on that side of town (which I never do anymore) you have to try this place it's everything every place that sells meat wishes they were. And the prices are so reasonable $14 for two meats two sides and a roll and they do not skimp on their portions not by a long shot. I have fallen hard and madly in love with this place it's like if angels were in the meat business :) it's truly that good. 10/10 cuz 5/5 is just insulting."}
{"text":"Hands down the best bbq in Vegas. The meat quality is amazing. Good size portions.  Sides are delicious. The corn bread is amazing. A must try. Don't be scared. It's in the middle of a residential area.  Outdoor eating area.  Very clean. A must try when u visit Vegas."}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Las Vegas, my husband and I found our way to Road Kill Grill. At first we though we were lost because our GPS directed us to drive through a residential neighborhood, but once we arrived.. the line was long but everything was all good. We had the brisket, ribs, greens, mac and cheese, green beans, baked beans, and peach cobbler. Yummy food. Definitely recommend this place. Worth the drive. Will stop in the next time in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Thee very Best BBQ in Vegas!  Im very picky, and each time I had their BBQ I was impressed!! Soooo amazing I had them cater my pool party. Everything was perfect down to the delivery time. Trust me, you won't be disappointed. You will be a returning customer  as well. Great job!!!! Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing!  Just don't come during the summer - outdoor seating only!  Make sure you get the mac 'n cheese, the brisket, and the beans.  SO GOOD!  I would have given 5 stars if there were indoor seating."}
{"text":"I went to the Road Kill Grill a couple weeks ago with my grandson Christian. I had seen it on Drive Ins, Diners and Dives. It was as advertised, terrific. The ribs were out of this world. He had pulled pork and chicken. I had a combo which included brisket. Just tasty as all heck. The price is very reasonable as you don't pay for atmosphere, just great food. You eat at outdoor picnic tables and the patrons clean up after themselves. It seemed like customers were courteous about doing that. We went on a Saturday, and they offered free ice cold beer in a barrel. Can't beat that! Seemed like most of the customers I chatted with were from out of town. Hard to believe us locals have overlooked this place."}
{"text":"We have had the road kill and food from the the butcher and both are amazing . The meats are perfect . They brought our meat to us if we spent more then 100.00 I think . everything we have tried out of their butcher shop is delicious. . Melt in you mouth food and I got everything I would have got at sams club and spent about the same and got a free flat of eggs and didn't have to leave the house ... now on the grill WOW I haven't had anything that's wasn't delicious.  My husband has an addiction to their beans but my fave is the pulled pork ..... we lived in Texas for a few yrs and only had one n place comparable they also give you enough food to share or to eat for 3 meals  Thanks John mulls"}
{"text":"Having lived in TX for a long time I love my BBQ.  And the BBQ scene in Vegas is pretty nonexistent.  Enter John Mull's.  As you drive down towards the restaurant, you'll think you made a wrong turn, but eventually you stumble into a ranch which provides a fun atmosphere for your eating experience.  A great place to get your BBQ fixins'!  While it isn't as good as TX BBQ, it is about the best you are going to find in Vegas and very enjoyable nonetheless.  The best choices IMO are definitely the ribs and the tri-tip.  The pork is a huge serving and is guaranteed to fill you up, but I found the flavor to be lacking just a little bit.  All in all it's a very neat and unique place and if i would definitely recommend it.  They also have a butcher shop right next door so be sure to check that out."}
{"text":"A coworker and I were in town for a convention.  We stopped by Jon Mulls because I am a huge Triple D fan. Let me tell ya, I'm glad I did!  Portions are HUGE and the food is great.  Smokey pulled pork slathered in the hot sauce and sliced hot links were paired w baked beans and an incredible mac n cheese.  If you're in Vegas...just take the 20-25 minute drive from the strip and you'll be happy you did-"}
{"text":"My third visit last night, we always take our visitors from Canada for some real BBQ!  The hot food is amazing and we got to try the Tri-tip on Tuesday night which was to die for. Some of the best pulled pork and brisket ever as well. Larry was the best making sure we had a fresh serving of potato salad and generous helpings of everything. Kim on the cash was so helpful letting me know how to order dog bones for my 2 dogs as well. Make sure you try the Mac and cheese! It's so good you will feel guilty!  It was about a thirty minute from southwest corner of the city but well worth it in my opinion!  See you guys again soon!  Larry I told you I would write a review :) !"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to this place. The beans and Mac n Cheese were great. The meats were dry and tasteless.  The service was very friendly and the prices were fair"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a good old fashioned butcher?  I heard about John Mull's about a year ago from my husband's co-worker but never got a chance to go. I finally had to check it out and I'm so glad I did. We originally went in on July 5th for Korean Short Ribs.  I was sad to hear that they had sold out on the Friday before due to the 4th of July holiday... Duh! Of course, they'd be out. Everyone BBQs on the 4th, right? Well, everyone except me. Anyway, he said to come back on Wednesday since that's when they would have more. I placed an order for Thursday morning.  Sure enough, when I walked in on Thursday, he had a nice brown bag with my name on it containing 5 lbs of Korean short ribs. I rushed home to marinate them and was happy to see that they had great marbling.  Not too much fat. A little thinner than I like but I just know to ask for thicker slices next time.  I can't wait to try their other cuts.  I've got my eye on the 5 lbs of chicken wings!"}
{"text":"Everything tasted great and the only reason I gave a 4 instead of a 5 is because I prefer Louisiana style wet ribs to Texas style dry rub"}
{"text":"Definitely lives up to diners, drives and dives... The mac and cheese is excellent and the staff is superb."}
{"text":"Ok, I have lived in Las Vegas for 3 years and never been to this place (mistake). My wife and I went there on a whim on Saturday night.  We found it but it was after 6 pm, the staff was closing down.  We said we would be back when they were open, but they said \"come on in we can fix you something\" My wife got rib tips and I got brisket, and I must say wow! Some BBQ I have had in a long time.   The thing that surprised me was they had closed down register and they wouldn't let me pay.  I couldn't believe it, that something that I have not seen in a long time, reminds me of being home in the south. Needless to say I will be back on Monday to pay them back for their  kindness.  This shows me that there are kind people  in Vegas that can cook BBQ with the best of them."}
{"text":"The food was amazing!! Rib tips were so yummy, tender with just the right amount of smoke flavor. I had greens and bake beans for side also delicious! Now let's talk about their amazing melt in your mouth corn bread. Be prepared to buy an extra piece you will regret it if you don't. I did!!  Now the wait to get this amazing food is about a hour, but I promise it's worth it! Just wear comfortable shoes and sunglasses!!  Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food first a great price. Smokers are cooking out back, people are super friendly!"}
{"text":"I got the brisket dinner, and I wasn't impressed with the meat. It wasn't very tender and not really that flavorful...BUT I got the mac and cheese and yams as my sides and they were AMAZING. The cornbread was also good, though I've never had it prepared that way. It was very cake-like (but good!). I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Holy smokes I have died & gone to hog heaven, the BBQ is so good, no its HELLA GOOD!!!  My neighbor took my husband there for lunch yesterday and my husband came home w/ a container full of leftovers.  My husband was ranting & raving about how good the food was & how ginormous the portion sizes were, hence the sizable amount of leftovers.  I tried one bite of his hot links dipped in the mild BBQ sauce, which by the way had a really nice kick and is highly addictive & I was seriously hooked.  So hooked that I made him take me & my son out there this afternoon for lunch.  My husband prepped me about the place so I wasn't in shell shock about it literally being a \"Backyard BBQ\". You'll see what I mean when you get there but the food is so damn good you forget about the ambiance once you take a bite of their delicious tender BBQ.  We ordered the 3 meat combo plate, I picked the hot links, ribs & brisket and chose coleslaw & baked beans for my two sides, a brisket sandwich, a pulled chicken sandwich and 3 drinks.  Our total came to ~$36, which is super good for BBQ but the bonus is you get so much food that you have leftovers for later.  Honestly, the BBQ is so good it almost makes me not want to eat it so I can savor every piece but heck w/ the amount of food, you can dive right in & there will be plenty more on your plate.  We sat on the picnic tables and ate there this afternoon & I kid you not, every single person had containers of leftovers.  You get a lot of bang for your buck there.  Oh and two thumbs up to their awesome staff, just super friendly."}
{"text":"The best BBQ I've ever had. Its a little pricing but it's well worth it because they give huge portions and everything tastes amazing"}
{"text":"While in Vegas, we came here because it was on diners, drive ins, and dives. First, we got the combo plate with ribs and brisket. We got two sides:potato salad and baked beans. The meat was tender and good. Liked the mild bbq sauce. Baked beans and potato salad were tasty. Price was reasonable. 18.00 for one combo plate with two drinks(we shared),and was plenty of food. We gave 4 stars due to the service. Waited 50 minutes in a line. They needed help to put food in plastic plate. All the food was cooked and in cafeteria style set up.   Bottom line food was good, but service not so much."}
{"text":"Alright, so if you decide to come here, know off top that you are going to be waiting in a long ass line. Why? Because the food is that spectacular. Plus all that waiting just makes you more hungry for all the food that is about to come. The owner's son who gave us menus while we waited in line also took our order and was very apologetic about said wait. He had a great demeanor and was pretty easy on the eyes as well ;-) Now again, once you order, there is a bit of waiting till you finally get your food, but it is SOOO worth the wait. So when they say 'backyard bbq' here they are not kidding. Seating is outdoor picnic tables, folding tables and chairs, so wear sneakers/closed toe shoes to avoid looking like a tourist. I ordered the 2 meat combo with 1/4 chicken and ribs with mac & cheese and green beans. The chicken was seasoned perfectly and juicy, the ribs were fall-off-the-bone-melt-in-your-mouth DELICIOUS! You want some extra meat with your meat? Because there's meat in the green beans and it's the best thing to happen to green beans since melted butter. The mac & cheese was dabomb.com and the order came with a piece of soft/warm cornbread. Sodas are just $1 and besides the standards (Coke, sprite etc.) they also have Iced tea, lemonade, fruit punch and orange soda. Honestly I have not a single complaint about this place, they even threw in a piece of warm apple cobbler for free since we had to wait extra for our chicken to come off the grill and it was the stuff American Dreams are made of."}
{"text":"The brisket was awesome, the hot links were delicious with just enough spice, you cant go wrong with any of the sides,  and don't forget the cobbler,  the cherry is amazing!  Crowded yes but it is well worth the wait, and for $30 could have easily fed 3 people.  Going back for my meats for my next BBQ for sure."}
{"text":"The Road Kill Grill is now the official caterer of the Hump-N-Bump.  This year they served over 320 people for our 30th year event and everybody absolutely loved it.  The reporters from Off-Road Adventures magazine did a huge story on our event and said that our food was one of the best event meals they ever had.  That says quite a bit considering that these reporters travel the world covering events like ours."}
{"text":"The Road Kill Grill had a food truck/tent sat up at bike night at the Harley Davidson at Red Rock yesterday. It smelled so good that we had to try it. My friend and I split the \"piggy fries\" and they were delicious. It had pulled pork, french fries, nacho cheese and jalapeños. They were $7 and the perfect amount for the two of us to split as a yummy snack. The girls working at the tent were also super friendly."}
{"text":"I loved this place while living in Vegas.  It was truly a gem and the best spot to get lunch, or an early dinner.  I have taken countless people here for the first time and everyone of them raved about it.  The brisket and tri-tip are always amazing."}
{"text":"A must for any locals or tourists. Only problem with promoting this place is that there will be longer lines. Staff is incredible and always very friendly. Never disappointed."}
{"text":"Beat bbq in las Vegas by far. Iv been in las Vegas for 13 years and tryed every bbq place in Vegas big. Small, cheap and expensive. I go there every weekend. Great price for the amount of food. There hot links ans brisket are the best."}
{"text":"There should be 2 separate listings, because I had significantly different experiences between the Road Kill Grill and the butcher services, so I am averaging here. First the grill: Dirt lot, outdoor picnic tables and a non-descript entrance that had me looking around to see if I had the right spot all point to a great dive-style BBQ joint.  I went at a time I expected to be off-peak, but the line was still rather long and everything made me feel THIS was going to be a great meal.  However, when you go to a dive for food and the food isn't good, all of the romance of eating at a dive disappears and you realize it's really just a dumpy spot that is surviving on the hype. Maybe it was an off day, but my ribs were dry.  The meat had a nice smoky flavor and were still tender enough to eat, but they had been on the heat too long and lacked anything special. Both of the side dishes I chose were disappointing.  I ate the beans, but they were rather bland.  I tried both their spicy and regular BBQ sauce, but nether offered much help.  The coleslaw was unpleasant and after only two bites, thrown away.  And how do you ruin coleslaw?  I was surprised by that. While I was there, I did look at the selection of meats they offer from the butcher-side of the business and was very excited to see some offerings that are hard to find anywhere else in Summerlin.  By watching the action while I was in line, I was impressed.  The meat looked great and the guy handling it obviously knew what he was doing.  I picked up some random beef cuts for later and the flavor was excellent.  This kept them from getting only 2 stars for the food, because I would go back to use their butcher services in the future, but will never try the BBQ again."}
{"text":"Just got done eating barbecue dinner from Chuck's it was delicious as usual,thanks for making a great Saturday night. Good job tell everybody thanks for all their hard work."}
{"text":"If you eat so much it starts to hurt you're in trouble. That's EXACTLY what happens every time I eat here. EVERY. TIME.  Love this place, love the staff, love the food. It's literally in the middle of nowhere but that adds to the allure and craving, you know it's going to be a drive but well worth it! The staff is the most friendly bunch of people working in one place I've ever met. You're sure to be greeted at the door with a smile and a food sample. Meanwhile I love hearing the ladies call me, \"baby.\" \"How's your day going baby?\" The food is off the charts delicious. This is what the long drive is all about. I've made it my personal mission to sample the best BBQ in the country and Road Kill Grill is tops. Fill the car with gas, grab some waters and start your playlist you won't regret the drive! Bring cash to tip!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp.  Browsed the meat menu and was pretty excited!  I went with Christmas dinner for the family in mind... Prime rib roast!  I asked the woman at the counter (knowing the answer, but...) if all the meat on the menu was choice.  She said, \"no... prime.\"  I was amazed!  All this was prime!  Sweet!  The customer behind me said that it was not prime.  I didn't hear him.  The attendant let me know that, \"He says it isn't prime.\"   I decided to get a boneless ribeye steak and some top sirloin to decide if paying twice the price for my standing rib roast was worth it.  Smith's was exactly half the price, as were Albertson's and Von's.  They cut me an amazing ribeye and two really nice pieces of top sirloin.  We grilled them up, and I was sold!  That ribeye was the best steak I have had outside of a restaurant.  The sirloin was good as well.  Nothing to freak out about, but good.  They both had more flavor than the normal supermarket cuts we normally get.  I went back for my 'prime' rib.  USDA ratings be damned... that meat was good!  Ordered my roast... 6-7 pounds and 2 pounds of bacon because the man who told me that the meat was not prime, said the bacon was amazing!  I did not specify where on the primal my cut was to come from, but even at Smith's it comes from the small end... my fault, I should have been more specific.  I believed the premium price meant I would automatically get the small end.  I got it home and saw that it was the opposite end.  I believe it was larger than 6 pounds though.  I went with it.  I dry aged it for 3 days.  I used Tyler Florence's recipe for horseradish crusted rib roast, as I have in the past on supermarket roasts.  The roast was flavorful, but it was tough.  I was not impressed, but this may be how roasts at the larger end of ribeye are (tough at 130 degrees).    All 4 roasts I have prepared from Smith's and Von's have greatly outshined this roast.  The worst part... a customer came in for their order that included duck.  The counter said that they had not received the ducks yet.  They would arrive later in the day.  After the customer left, they got 4 frozen ducks and \"put them in water\" per instruction of the woman at the counter.  I believe this customer ordered fresh birds.  Why else would they not fill her order at that time?   I have no doubt that if you are a regular customer, you will get outstanding cuts of choice beef, pork and at times fresh poultry.  If you aren't a regular, watch your ass.  Supermarkets deliver consistent, as promised mediocrity at half the price."}
{"text":"A 9+ only because I prefer the bark on slow smoked ribs ( I make my own ) every thing else was exellent. A long wait that could be a simple fix. Use both sides of the service stand. There is no reason to wait for food that is already prepared. Realy there is no excuse!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing. Pulled pork is my fave. Only issue is that it's a little disorganized. They are nice enough to direct you if you look lost.  The cornbread is awesome and I love that they have a butcher in house to buy the bacon on the rind that I grew up eating. I'm also going to take home some center cut sirloin as well. Looking super forward to that!!!"}
{"text":"The first thing I can say is that I was immediately greeted when I walked in. It was around 11 a.m., and I was the only customer inside. Soon after, a work crew of big men came in. The hot links were good.  However, the brisket was dry, and I didn't care much for the chicken. The sauce had an overpowering tangy and kind of sweet taste. Also, when I chose chicken, I didn't think I would be getting the pulled type. I wanted it on the bone. The potato salad tasted store-bought, and the macaroni and cheese was at least better than what I've had recently. My biggest complaint is that the food is pre-cooked and placed in warming bins. I've been to real barbecue places where you see them pulling the meat off the grill and then serving that to you. That's the kind of barbecue place I love. The service wasn't bad, but the low star rating is because of the food. I could never give a place that serves pre-cooked food in warming bins a high rating. So I won't be back to John Mull's and don't see the big deal about this place. Also, it's too much out of the way--kind of in the boondocks. It's mainly residential, and I passed by this regular house--not a ranch--across the street  that had 3 horses in the front yard...say what! Now that was strange."}
{"text":"Good cuts of meat for a fair price what more can I say! I get my steaks and racks of ribs from here and they always do a phenomenal job"}
{"text":"Food is really good, I would advise to order out, the grub shake looks nice and would be a good experience except for the fact that the music choice is horrible, I don't know what kind of crowd they are catering to but north town comes to mind. It would have 5 Starz but the experience is just not there."}
{"text":"Very, very good barbecue. I had the rib tips with cole slaw and mac n cheese. Outstanding! Saw this place on DDD and Guy Fieri raved about their food and the freshness of their meat... I couldn't agree more. Perfect smoke flavor, the sauce had the right spice, and the mac was a perfect Southern side dish. I would definitely recommend this place for a nice, low cost bbq dinner"}
{"text":"First and foremost I'm in love with this place. I feel like I'm apart of the family. Star you are the best. Brian you are the best. Mama (Star's mom) you are the greatest. I'm going to miss you so much. Nita you are amazing! So let me tell you how the people of John Mulls treated me for the holidays. So, I didn't have a turkey a ham or any sides. I came to John Mulls and they made my Thanksgiving dinner possible. The owner, Nita melted my heart. Because of them, I was able to give my family a full meal. As a high school teacher and a mother of three, my time is so limited. My family came into town and I had no dinner prepped for all of them...so embarrassing. So, when I came to them they showed me so much love, I couldn't even believe it. So best believe my Christmas, Easter, Mother's Day, Fourth of July and Thanksgiving will be all John Mulls Road Kill. Oh by the way, all of Los Angeles has gotten the word because my mother has told everyone; the church, her co-workers, her neighbors and her little Facebook friends. I love this place and they will forever be my FAMILY and they will always have my heart!"}
{"text":"John mulls is great! The line outside was a little confusing as there isn't instructions but basically you wait outside the doe for someone to come take your order then wait again to be let inside to get your food and pay. It was a little wait but very worth it as the food reminded me of North Carolina and was delishious! You can call in your order in advance and pick up which makes the wait a lot shorter. The food and staff were amazing!"}
{"text":"We're huge BBQ fans- we really loved their smoked chicken and their hot links, which had a nice snap to the casing. We found the brisket a bit dry. Macaroni and cheese was delicious and collards were traditional and nicely seasoned. Our pick for smoked meat for sure in Vegas."}
{"text":"I spent Thanksgiving at my Aunt's house in Vegas and she ordered a 20lb. smoked turkey, the BEST turkey we have ever had, it's gonna be very hard to east any other kind ever again. YOU MUST TRY ONCE IN YOUR LIFE!!!"}
{"text":"I've had BBQ all over his great country of ours. This is too 5 places I've had. Meats were smoked to perfection, burnt ends were tender as hell with the right amount of bark.   Personally, I like my BBQ sauce more than this place, but man was it tasty!!  Eat here!!! With the wait! Come hungry because they don't skimp."}
{"text":"Distance is a factor... The drive when you got a real hunger worked up keeps us not getting back here. First timers flounder around a bit trying to figure the place out. food Network probably does more for hard to find dining spots like this than even word of mouth.  Meats were good sides too! Wish they had a location on the east side of town!"}
{"text":"I had my first taste of this place at a catered meeting. I finally made it out to the source a few weeks ago. Absolutely amazing! I think this is the best BBQ in town. I had a pulled pork sandwich and the mac and cheese.  The only downside is also part of its charm. Because it's a tiny place in a residential neighborhood they have to make some concessions to normal expectations for eating on site. There is usually a line outside and they call a few people in at a time to go through the line inside. There is no inside seating, just picnic tables. They are in shady covered areas so it was really nice when I was there but I can't imagine it would be very comfortable in August in Las Vegas. As long as you know what you are getting into and plan accordingly (I'm not going to take two kids there by myself anytime soon, but with the wife to order while I keep them outside would work well) it isn't a big issue.  I'll definitely be back when I'm in the area and its not 110 out or get it to go if it's too warm!"}
{"text":"BEST BBQ I have had. I'm so spoiled now I won't be able to eat at a normal BBQ restaurant  again"}
{"text":"This food is just damn good! The serving size is generous and everything is full of flavor. Oh and the desserts... Yeah get some."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I've been here for lunch and dinner a few times and never been disappointed. The staff are always courteous and the food is consistently perfect.  The portion sizes are big, usually my family of four can split two dinners and still have food leftover."}
{"text":"Awesome. Great sausage (the sliced ones in the BBQ sauce), brisket, ribs, and pulled pork. Friendly staff! The hot BBQ sauce is definitely the best and isn't too hot at all. Casual. Sit outside on picnic tables which on a day like today was prime - minus some bees flyin around :0"}
{"text":"This place is a comfort food hidden gem! Didn't feel like cooking for Memorial Day, so we were browsing Yelp for a good bbq spot... 4.5 stars? We were intrigued & started to head there! We were a little confused as we approached it. \"Wait, is it in a house?\" But in the middle of a residential area along Thom, we found what looked like a ranch.  We were surprised that it wasn't a traditional restaurant, but an outdoor \"hole-in-the-wall\" family owned country type ambiance. We fell in line, which we were in for about half an hour (don't forget it was Memorial Day though!)... You approach an area with the menus where your order is written on a ticket, then give it to the people in the food area who prep it, and wait at the the end for them to call you with your order.   Before we had even tasted the food, we were completely sold on the place. The hospitality and customer service was simply over the top and so friendly from start to finish! We were offered tri-tip samples, given free bottles of water... and they were even offering free cheeseburgers, hot dogs, and French fries for MDW -- which were delicious! Everyone at this place is not only hard working but extremely friendly!   We ordered the THREE MEAT COMBO. - BRISKET, RIBS, PULLED CHICKEN. - MAC & CHEESE, GREEN BEANS.  (also comes with a little cornbread!) Also ordered PULLED PORK SANDWICH.  The portions are generous, the prices are decent & the food has great southern flavor! We enjoyed everything & left extremely satisfied. It's a fun non-traditional place to eat since its outdoors (it was quite hot out but the seating is shaded -- might be a little TOO hot in the later summer months!) & the place stayed packed with a long line (per the girl at the register, it isn't usually that crazy)! Highly recommended... great food & great service! :)"}
{"text":"I am so happy I discovered this well kept secret! We feed our dogs a raw diet and he was looking for a place to get some inexpensive meet for them.  Well, he found a place for the dogs and us!  They have great prices and great food!  They also cater, so if that's what you're looking for it's highly recommended. The place has been open for over 60 years and the staff is very friendly!  They will talk and joke with you while you wait.  If you have never been to John Mull's Meats, you should definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"If you live in 'Vegas you're lucky to have a World Class BBQ in town. If you're from elsewhere...do make the trip for the amazing food. The Ribs, the Brisket, Mac & Cheese, Greens are the best I've ever had. If there's a line - and there usually is - wait because it's worth it."}
{"text":"Bomb.com! Ate here for the first time yesterday and my family and I loved every single bite. Every single thing we had was AMAZING. The Mac n Cheese is oh my goodness hollllly mollllyyy good. Next time I will be getting like wayyyyy more! We were sad when it was all gone. Lol. Loved the atmosphere and people. Such a good place and will definitely be back again and again and again. Will not go anywhere else for BBQ anymore!"}
{"text":"Best non-Southern BBQ I've had, thinking of it makes my molars sweat."}
{"text":"A friend told me to try it after she saw it on Diners, Drive-ins, & Dives.  My husband and I thought our navigation system was taking us to the wrong location because we went through a residential neighborhood.  But there it was set back across a gravel parking lot.  The food was good.  We tried the ribs, pulled chicken, links, and brisket.  We chose bbq beans,  green beans seasoned with turkey & potatoes, macaroni & cheese,  The mac & cheese was slightly creamy and seasoned well.  The bbq beans were delicious and had ground meat seasoning.  The brisket was our favorite when dipped in either of their tasty sauces.  The hot links had a smooth flavor with a kick.  The line was quite long when we arrived as it was a half hour before closing.  The building has these meat locker doors and some people aren't smart enough to not stand close to the door because other patrons will be opening the door behind them.  We almost took out this lady and her kid, and she was upset with us because we couldn't see through the big steel door and see her on the other side.  They were out of desserts so we didn't get to try their cobblers.  Drawback is there is no indoor seating to enjoy your food.  Since we are visiting from out of town, we took our food to a hotel because we couldn't take the outdoor seating where it was 106 degrees in the shade.  They did have misters, but that wasn't enough."}
{"text":"I love this place.. They're sides are the bomb I always get the brisket dinner w/mac n cheese & baked beans.."}
{"text":"We were disappointed especially after waiting an hour in line. Rib tips were quite dry, pulled chicken  was good. Love the BBQ sauce."}
{"text":"Great sausage and great ribeye steaks. The bacon here is the best I've ever tasted!!!! Try it \"thick cut\"."}
{"text":"My go to place for butcher. Great staff and highest quality! The BBQ is one of the best in town! Cannot go wrong with their food."}
{"text":"This place is no joke. Fresh smoked brisket, pulled pork, tri tip (on Thursdays), chicken and hot links. Everything made in house. In house smoked bacon, and they process your kills. These guys are experts at their craft. Multiple smokers on site and their own kill room. Homemade spices and BBQ sauces. They even do cheeses. This place is tucked away and looks rather small, don't let that detour you. It is worth the trip!! You can also get raw meats on site or delivered to you.."}
{"text":"This was the second time I ate lunch here.  I'm from out of town and it was a great choice again.  I know I wanted the ribs but was unsure of my second meat so I asked the lady who works there for advice.  She told me to have the burnt ends but I would have to wait for them to be ready.  I agreed and it was definitely worth the wait.  The ribs were good but no comparison to the juicy tasty burnt ends.  After I order I was walking out to eat but I saw one of the guys doing the bbqing so I asked him if he would show me his Bbq pits.  He stopped what he was doing and said \"sure come on out back with me.\"  I started asking him questions because I love to Bbq and before you know it he opened up one of the pits with pork shoulder and pulls one out grabs a knife and cuts a piece off and says try this.  Wow it was so good,  next we went over to the tri tips and once again he cuts me off an end piece and let me taste right off the grill.  He answered several questions and gave me some great Bbq tips to try at home.  I told him thanks.... That made my day in Vegas!!!  Coolest guys and I definitely know it was worth the drive out to their place.  I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Cashed in a Groupon at John Mull's last week that ultimately aided in having a epic barbeque this weekend poolside.  I would have to say that their Top Sirloin Steak was one of the best Sirloins I've ever had!    There location was a little strange, tucked back in a ranching residential area.  But, it was worth the drive across town!    I'll be back when they open up the barbeque shack.  By the way, they should have had the barbeque restaurant open  before they ran the Groupon Promotion.  They would have generated a lot of revenue."}
{"text":"I have never written  a review before but I read about John Mulls yesterday and just happened to be around the corner from there today so I stopped in. To say this is a hidden gem is an understatement. The meat is fresh and cut to order, but its the people that work there that make the place. They are knowledgeable and friendly, plus the prices are great! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I got the chicken meal. The beans and corn bread combo with the chicken is so good. I ordered white meat and also macaroni & cheese. Everything together was so yummy!! I will definitely return here when I'm in Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"one word ...... \" hurry \"  this place is awesome excellent food !  large portions  great food  staff is very nice Larry is one Cool Cat and Richie is the bomb I even thought he was the owner until I asked the owner for his boss's name !  lol. inside joke"}
{"text":"Great food looove the corn bread. Mac n cheese is amazing and it doesn't matter how long the line might seem they get u in and out omg did I say I love this place"}
{"text":"A++++ Take all my visitors here. Cater for employee lunches as well. Make sure you are hungry when you go to eat! A lot of food!"}
{"text":"This has to be the best BBQ meats in Vegas !!  They have also catered the annual Vegas Valley 4 Wheelers Hump N Bump In Logandale NV. for the past couple of years. They bang out awesome food to the massive crowd in record time efficiently and friendly top notch !!..check them out .."}
{"text":"Hands down best pulled pork and best mac n cheese I have ever had. They are also the only butcher in town that will get my business. Friendly faces from all of the employees. A definite must try."}
{"text":"I'm from the Deep South.  John's has the best pulled pork I've ever had. Tender and moist with just a bit of sweet.  Ribs were a bit fatty.  Chicken was chicken. Appropriately cooked. The red sauce went great with it.   Awesome cornbread. Just the right size portion and extremely light. Came individually wrapped.   The baked beans were out of this world. So many different flavors while at the same time both hot and sweet.  And this was delivery.  Can't wait to get stuff from them again."}
{"text":"Saw this on diners drive in and dives and the very next day I was standing in line in 100 degree heat to try some BBQ.   Be prepared to sweat a bit even though they offer free lemonade while you wait! The \"restaurant\" is more like an outdoor BBQ. You order and pay and they pull your order from the grill and call your name.  It's pretty simple really.   You can buy Tshirts if you wish, Or order cuts of meat from inside. It's a small room and kind of dungeon like but a lot of people were ordering so it must be good as well. The butcher is right there for you to watch.   We shared a 3 meat combo...ribs which were super tender, brisket that melted in my mouth with flavor and the hot link. Man oh man the hot link...I loved it. Perfectly cooked with a kick that keeps you wanting more.   We had Mac n cheese and potato salad for sides. Both were fresh and very good. The Mac was so cheesy!   It's located in a neighborhood and it's close to is so we will be returning when we get that BBQ craving. It's a must if you are visiting!!!"}
{"text":"First place we went to when we first got to Las Vegas. The service was good. The food was amazing. Just melted in your mouth. Can't wait to go back and eat more. Brisket was my most favorite. Loved it all."}
{"text":"Portions aren't as big as they once were but still great food . Definitely worth the drive when I want good soul food ."}
{"text":"Iv never left this place happily. I order my food for pick up every time to get home and be something completely diff, iv gotten phones calls after the order was taken to till me they were out of what I wanted. Today was the worst ever I spent 31 dollars to feed my family to get 18 fucking pounds of lean brisket when I ordered 3 meat combo meals. They will automatically substitute meats if out of one kind with out your consent. Supposably I have a comp waiting. If you want good bbq I would suggest Rolling Smoke bbq. Everything is much faster and they are open late and my fav they have sweet potato."}
{"text":"Angela told me she saw this place on Diners and Drive-Ins.  I'm amazed there isn't more reviews for this place after getting a spot on that show.  On this note, Angela had told me this was the 2nd place she had gone that Guy had recommended and didn't think was amazing.  We're starting to think that dude just doesn't know what great BBQ is.  Overall, was not amazed by the BBQ but it's solid BBQ.  Angela and I ordered a good variety of almost everything and was only really amazed by the baked beans.  They're damn good.  Definitely get this as one of your side orders.    The people who work there are really friendly.  Like Southern hospitality friendly.  And the outside seating is surrounded by a mister so that was pretty nice considering it was 100+ degrees that day."}
{"text":"Best BBQ IN VEGAS!!!!! There meat melts in your mouth. Doesn't matter which one you order! So much flavor too! There Mac n' cheese is the best I've ever had! Can't get enough! There green beans are amazing! So much flavor!! Bbq beans are good. The people and atmosphere is pretty awesome and unique! Good prices!  ITS A MUST GO TRY KIND OF PLACE FOR VISITORS! And a every chance I get place for me since I live here!"}
{"text":"Long wait time because this place is so good!  I got the ribs and chicken plate with coleslaw and potato salad. All so savory except the coleslaw, it was pretty bland.  The service was really friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow. Stayed in N. Las Vegas at an Air BnB and searched Yelp for some dining. We have traveled all over the US for BBQ and THIS IS IT.   Normally at other BBQ joints we really either like the sides or the BBQ but never both. Wasn't the case at John Mull's...every aspect of the meals were fantastic. I am pretty sure we tasted every meat available in their combo plates. Between 4 of us we picked up 7 combo meals and ate for the whole weekend. Even when we felt full, it was still the best BBQ. Mac and Cheese, Sweet Potatoes, pulled pork, brisket, ribs, omg every single thing was amazing.   We arrived right when they opened and there was already a line so get there early. They also have a butcher shop for all your other meat needs, which opens earlier than the cooked food side."}
{"text":"So we made the trek to Road Kill, and it was pretty neat to see, but not much was spectacular.  The staff was, while polite, very impersonal.  Almost like they're trained to keep a distance. At least on the BBQ side.  The meats side sounded like they were a little more in tune with the customers.  Girlfriend had the tri-tip sandwich, which she said was very good. I had the three meat combo with brisket, pulled pork and hot link.  Sides were potato salad and baked beans.  Brisket- was cooked well, but didn't have a lot of flavor. It tasted like run of the mill roast beef.  Pulled pork - pretty good.  Again, cooked well, just didn't jump out as something special.  Hot link - easily the star of the show.  Wasn't really interested in it before I got there, but when I saw them, knew I had to try it, and I'm glad I did.  Hot, tender and juicy... And the spices were just amazing.  If the other meats would have had a bit of kick like this, wow...  Baked beans - couldn't figure out what was in them, but I don't really care...  They were awesome. Great flavor!  Potato salad - mehhh....  Tasted like it came from a food service pack.  Just another potato salad.  All in all, a fun place to visit, if for no other reason than to say we went."}
{"text":"Location/ambience: 3 Staff: 5 Food: 4 Likeliness to return: 3 Likeliness to recommend 3  After a morning of hiking at Mt Charleston, we were ready for some protein!!!  The location: Ranch-like space within residential area.  We ordered in a small cramped room and seating was outdoors. Luckily it wasn't too hot outside.  However, the tables outside were clean and the bathroom was also very clean!  Staff: Friendly, helpful, and keeping busy. Excellent!  Food: We were pretty disappointed everything was in warmers.. it was 2:30pm, we weren't sure if it'd be different had we come in the morning?  Flavor of the rib tips, brisket, and pull pork was excellent!! However, being in the warmer made it dry and doesn't visually look fresh.  Collard greens also had great flavor. Chili was too watery, my Coca Cola was not cold (that made me really sad lol) but I normally don't like BBQ sauce and I really enjoyed their spicy tangy jam like consistency sauce!  Likeliness to return: We live in Spring Valley, the experience isn't enough to make a trip, but if we're in the area.. maybe? If nothing else around the area interests me. Cuz for $16.99 we got a decent amount of food  Likeliness to recommend: I would recommend, if someone's in that area, if they're less picky with experiences and just want some decent food to fill their stomach. But not if they're super hungry, though we got lucky, I saw other reviews mention the long lines."}
{"text":"The bbq was good but I've had better & the guy who served it up inside store was not friendly & very annoyed even though i came in knowing what I wanted.  The hot link sausage was the reason for my trip & is super good. I bought a bag to take home. I will be making the trip out when I visit vegas for the sausage since its too expensive to ship to CA.  The store was 15 miles from our hotel but took an hour roundtrip from traffic on freeway but worth the trip. It's in a residential area which was strange but whatever."}
{"text":"First day of a week long vacation in Las Vegas and hubby insists on going to John Mull's.  drove straight from airport.  Should have listened to the other customers!  We each got the two meat platter.  Enough food for 5 people - easily!  Brisket, hot links, chicken, baked beans, mac n cheese - each bite better than the last.  Friendly staff added to the great experience!  Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"The tastiest BBQ in the strangest location ever! Chuck and his crew are the bomb! Super friendly and helpful. Our 2nd visit to John Mull's - here in town for EDC as our son was an artist on Saturday night. We've been dreaming of baby back ribs , cornbread and beans since our first visit!!  We ordered (3) 3 meat dinners and barely made a dent in our meals before feeling so full and satisfied. We will be enjoying our midnight snack at the hotel!  See you again John Mull's BBQ and crew!  Nom nom!"}
{"text":"Super delicious bar-b-que. Trina-tip currently served on Tuesday and Thursday -best thing they serve in my opinion. Only thing that could be improved is the checkout process-taking the order was very fast but a bottleneck happens at checkout. Side dishes are delicious - very traditional southern side dishes-Mac n cheese, collard greens, beans, green beans --dinner comes with cornbread or white bread as well Desserts looked amazing too"}
{"text":"The links are where its at.  I can't speak for the other stuff. If you want to know about the hot links then baby, this is for you.  The hot links are juicy. plump & juicy. the skin crisps up just right. when you fry them you dont even need to add oil, they will sizzle in their own juice. the hotness isnt too bad. the size is right.  A haiku i wrote:  Hot link O hot link i cannot live without you You make my tongue dance"}
{"text":"ANYBODY CRAVING SPOTTED DICK?!!  If you've seen King Ralph with John Goodman, you know what I'm talking about.  I stopped by this afternoon to use my $40 groupon. If you haven't heard of this place, you probably would never have found it. It's a hidden gem in a residential area.  I picked up 3 Ribeye ($11.99/lb) and 2 lbs of Korean Style Ribs ($5.49/lb). You can have the steaks cut to the thickness of your liking.   I had the Ribeye for dinner tonight and it was so much better than the Ribeye that Wal-mart sells for the same price.  Both ladies at the counter were very friendly. I will mos def come back to try some of the other meats."}
{"text":"The Road Kill Grill is a guilty pleasure.  All the food - especially the smoked meats - are delicious and the portions are filling.  All seating is outdoors in shade.  Take-out is available if seating is crowded.  As another reviewer said, nothing fancy here; but the food is terrific."}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ great food awesome sides Simple they BBQ and it comes out delicious. Staff is fun. Simple outdoor picnic setup  Love it"}
{"text":"Great food. Even better prices and the staff is super friendly. Enjoyed sitting outside in the \"backyard\" on a beautiful day in Vegas."}
{"text":"hands down one of the best BBQ's in town and great service.  Only downfall the line for BBQ can be an hour or two wait.  Ribs are definitely worth the wait!!!  I love the Mac n Cheese, Ribs, Pulled Pork and Brisket. Everything else is good to."}
{"text":"These guys make the best BBQ in vegas ! I brought my dad visiting from CA out there, and he says \"why are we going all the way out here \"... and then he had some. Ribs- outstanding (I'm not a rib guy). Pulled Pork... excellent.. the Brisket.. THE BOMB ! the place is obscure, but the food is excellent, and I've heard the meats are great too... albeit a bit pricey. Outside seating ... so, just take it home. My wife and I cannot  eat the 3-meat lunch with two sides. They feed you ! Thanks Guy Fieri for turning us onto this one !"}
{"text":"My honeymoon dinner was spent here....wedding party was skeptical but as soon as they Sat down and tasted the food...........it was a hit Best Bbq brisket, ribs, and chicken ever....best in LAS VEGAS.... staff was very nice and helpful....must go in VEGAS."}
{"text":"Best BBQ I've ever had!  No frills place with outdoor seating and great food.  Ribs, hot links,  and Brisket are incredible.  Mac and cheese is a must try!  The opposite of the box stuff mom made when you were 5.  Lines are usually long, but they move fast."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant based on a friend's recommendation and found it to be an authentic BBQ experience. This place looked good. It's definitely off of the beaten trail, a hidden gem indeed. There was a line when we arrived, but everyone was so friendly...you just talked to folks while waiting. We went for lunch and sampled the chicken, pulled pork, collard green, potato salad and beans. Beans were a too sweet, pork and chicken moist but not super tender. Big disappointment was the beef rib which turned out to be something like smoked London broil, there was no bone... The ambiance and service was OK, prices fair, but don't go if you have ever eaten good Texas barbecue. Not bad, but not great either..."}
{"text":"Long and unnecessary waits plus good (not great) BBQ equals a three star rating. Despite being far from the strip and located in a bad residential area, this place has all the right elements for a legitimate four star BBQ joint... But they screw it up with bad service.   They make you wait outside in the heat for more than an hour and finally you get inside the tiny kitchen only to find the long wait is only due to their mismanagement.   They take your order while you wait in line and for some unknown reason (over an hour later) they ask you again while ONE GUY fills your order. The other guy is only the cashier and peach cobbler scooper, as far as I can tell. The server guy is so busy with his comedy Schtick and small talk with tourists that the line wraps around the building. I suspect they think a long line makes them seem more appealing and creates a false sense of demand.   There's plenty of seating in the covered area... They just make you wait for the Schtick... \"Hey buddy, where you from... Your first time? Whatcha doing in Las Vegas... Awe buddy, you look hungry pal... Here, try a sample.\" By the time we sat to eat it was too late to have a great BBQ experience. I was visibly pissed and he did not bother to BS with me.   There's plenty of great BBQ in Las Vegas. If you want great BBQ and comedy, skip this place... Get some Great BBQ on the strip and see a real show while in Las Vegas.  Instead of serving great food with great service, they are riding their hype from the Diners Drive ins and Dives show... All hype."}
{"text":"I only tried the staples that I judge most BBQ. Brisket and sausage. The brisket was a disgrace. No bark or fat. Both had been trimmed off. They pre cut it and leave it in a broth until ordered. The sausage was salty with the sauce poured over it regardless if you ask for it or not. Can't speak for the rest if the menu so I gave it 3 stars. My meal was NO stars."}
{"text":"I order from this place for my family reunion and the food was amazing. Their service was also amazing! I wish I lived in Vegas so I could order from them again."}
{"text":"Hands down best BBQ in Las Vegas, macaroni and cheese is out of control. If your in Vegas and want BBQ this is the place"}
{"text":"Don't write reviews generally, but this place is so \"off the chain\" good, if there were 6 stars, they'd get them. If your looking for the place where dress-up is more important than what they're serving, you have ventured to the wrong place. When your in Vegas now-a-days, eating has become stupidly expensive and rarely lives up to the money your throwing down. The Roadkill is not dirt cheap, but is very affordable, considering the served portions. Love BBQ? Then don't miss this. Vegetarian stand clear. This is the place to put on the \"Carnivore Feed-bag\"! Well.. what are you waiting for ? Bounce over there ! The ONE meal we hit up every time we're in Las Vegas !"}
{"text":"Mediocre food from the rudest group of employees I've ever seen.   We walked inside and were rudely told to go wait outside while the woman took the order of the group who came in AFTER us. There was another group waiting outside with us. They were just as confused as we were. After standing outside waiting for about 10 minutes with no sign of the order taker, my husband went in to see if they were ready for us, she yelled at him to get back outside. Again, no one ever came to take our order or invite us in after the line died down. We finally just went in anyway and she eventually took our order.   After finally placing our order slooooowly getting to the cashier, the employees started yelling at each other because too many customers were coming in from outside. The lady behind us nicely tried to explain our confusion and offer help to get people to wait outside like (apparently) they're supposed to. The cashier started SCREAMING at the poor lady! We had just paid or I would have walked out.   We had planned on putting in a meat market order but couldn't wait to get the hell outta there!  Got home and they forgot one of our sides. Food was ok but not worth the hassle at all. There are much better BBQ joints with nice employees to help you."}
{"text":"Good food, but long wait, errors in the orders, and no seating. Good service. My family loved it."}
{"text":"A MUST visit for anyone that loves spicy but sweet Q.  Cooks throw down and don't disappoint. Outdoor sitting picnic style only so order to go, kick back, and enjoy. I ordered a smoked turkey for Thanksgiving but it was a little dry but good flavor. I'll go back to my husband's fried turkey next year.:-)"}
{"text":"I saw this place on tv a few years back and finally got to try them the food is what you are looking for in bbq. This is that country dirt road type if down hom bbq! The food was bbq just right full of flavor and the sides brinf you back to when your family has a reunion and the elders put their soul in the food! The ribs were tender and fell off the bones the brisket and links were delish! The mac n cheese had the right balance of cheese to noodle ratio. The yams take you back to thanksgiving dinner. The baked beans and potato salad made you wanna do a happy dance. My only dislike was there was no place to eat in doors and it was over 100 out but i guess its not traditional if ya eat it indoors. And to me if the only complaint is no indoor seating they are doing something right"}
{"text":"Excellent! Food is sooo good. Had the ribs, brisket, pulled pork with Mac & Cheese and greens. Delicious! Be prepared to wait in line if you come at lunch time but it is worth the wait."}
{"text":"If you had one last meal to eat before you you died, this would have to be the place! Driving up it doesn't look like the greatest food ever is inside... But it is! Fresh smoked meat and some huge portion sizes! I know BBQ and this definitely is the real deal!"}
{"text":"This is by far my absolute favorite place for bbq in all of Nevada! The service is great, always! The meals are very well proportioned and never let you down. I try my hardest to call in my order during the week days and if you're visiting on a Saturday, just bring your patience. It's well worth the wait, you might even meet a few new friends with a similar interest for BBQ. I am truly thankful for this location, the BBQ ribs and hot links are soooo good! Oh and I can never forget the baked beans and green beans too  please give them a shot !"}
{"text":"Three meat combo will fill up most anyone. The ribs, and pulled pork were 4 stars in my opinion. The brisket was 3 stars at best today. It was dry with no flavor. Potato salad was very good as the baked beans were also. I eat a lot of barbecue all over the country so I might be more critical but I still give them 4 stars and I would go back again."}
{"text":"Ok  I went to  roadkill grill and let me tell you  it tasted like the name roadkill lol. I drove 48 minutes  from my house in Henderson too be disappointed. Now everything  wasn't  bad, the service  was  good. Jermaine was a pretty good  host. Now Im from  Texas I know  how bbq should taste and this place isn't it. IDK why this place was featured on the foodnetwork.But let me tell you 30 dollar's and 48 minutes  later I will not come back."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place because I'm always looking for good BBQ and it was on The Food Network. Sadly, I was disappointed. The brisket was very thin and didn't have much flavor, the ribs were okay (not great), the cornbread was too sweet (tasted like cake not cornbread) and the Mac & cheese was yummy. So only one thing was actually good. While we were eating I was thinking \"well at least the Mac & Cheese is good...it wasn't a total waste\" but then...my upset stomach began. My stomach was messed up all day and into the evening. My friend had the same reaction. I'm so disappointed.   If you do decide to go here, I wouldn't go in the summer unless you plan to take the food home because the only seating is outside on picnic tables. Luckily it wasn't too hot the day we went, but it still wasn't comfortable."}
{"text":"I was so excite to try this place, so cane in ordered the ribs combo with mac and cheese and potato salad. I was so ready to eat then i took a bite into one rib and they were cold omg it was 108 degrees outside, how is it possible that my ribs were cokd, i was very disappointed. I give it 3 starts because the sides were very good."}
{"text":"We got the 3 meat combo and loved it.  Their sauce is very good, definitely homemade.  We didn't care for the string beans, they were a little bland."}
{"text":"This place was a total disappointment. A good friend recommended it and as I trust that person when it comes to food, I expected much bore than what was served. Everything without exception was horrible. Not even one edible dish, and we sampled quite a bit. Imagine that my kids didn't even want to eat the Mac & Cheese. When your kids says no to Mac & Cheese you know its really bad. How can you screw up Mac and Cheese? Well these folk can and did. All the meats were dry beyond description. The sauces were terrible, the sides were just as bad as the meats. We moved from dish to dish, meat to meat and couldn't find a single item we wanted to take another bite of. The dessert cobblers (we samples 3 different ones  Apple, Peach and Cherry) were no better. There was enough sugar in them to give you a cavity just by looking at them, 2 of them were under baked so it was like getting a spoonful of raw flour /batter in your mouth, gross.  I wish I could find something good to say. My friend really spoke highly of it, and I see many other good reviews. Perhaps we caught them on a \"bad day\"? Should such an excuse even exist for food you paid almost $100 for? And how do you screw up every single thing on the menu? that goes far beyond just \"bad day\". I cannot speak of service, since we did takeout. If I have to try hard to find something good to say, its that the portions were generous. But if the food is all inedible, what difference does the portion size make anymore? $100 worth of food all went in the trash that day. Painful."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Huge delicious portions for a great price & to top it off the staff is beyond friendly! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Saw this on Triple D with the guy with the outdated hair cut that needs to change it. The BBQ was priced at $16 for a 3 way combo which I'm CA cost a lot more than that. You get a big amount of brisket, 4 ribs, and 1/4 chicken, this is what I picked. The brisket was super dry and even putting BBQ sauce on it didn't help much, the chicken was whatever nothing special, and the ribs were actually good. The Mac N Cheese and Potato Salad in my opinion were the best part of the meal. It also came with corn bread. I think the staff were nice and the line moved rather quickly. Would I come back here? I wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"Basic and simple: comfort food. BBQ and all the sides. It's good but I'm also used to Chicago BBQ joints. I like my rib tips juicy and sauced. Theirs are smoked, a little dry and come to you with sauce on the side. I enjoyed the mac and cheese and the green beans w/potatoes. I tried a slice of my wife's hot link and it was decent. All-in-all, it was a decent meal."}
{"text":"This is a must-try. The hype is real and the experience is unlike anything else. The cornbread is amazing too."}
{"text":"This is not a restaurant, it's a meat market with prepared foods and a place outside to (pardon the pun) pig out.  It's located in NW Vegas, in a residential part of town.  If you're looking for a MCB or Famous Dave's kind of place, this isn't it.  The only thing you'll find here is down-home BBQ and a meat counter, both with excellent value for the money.  Couple this with a staff that treats you like you're family and you have one heck of an experience.  Where else are you going to find side pork, frog legs and goat?"}
{"text":"I had this place bookmarked for a really long time, and finally had my chance to check it out. I was not disappointed. We waited in line for only 20 minutes around 3:00 pm on a Saturday. I will say the line got a lot longer while we were waiting, but don't get discouraged, it is worth the wait! Every employee went out of their way to make sure everyone was having a great experience and making sure everyone was a happy customer. Very welcoming. My husband got a 3 meat combo and I got a two meat combo with high hopes of incredible leftovers. Between us both we got the hot links, brisket, ribs, pulled chicken and pulled pork. The Hot links were the favorite by far, but everything else was also delicious. The cole slaw was ok. I wasn't impressed with the beans. They were very onion-y and full of ground beef. Neither of us are onion fans. The mac and cheese was tasty, but I am a Wisconsin girl and used to the best cheese, so it is hard for me to be impressed with mac and cheese anywhere else. I guess you could call me a cheese snob. Had to throw in some Peach Cobbler too even though there was absolutely no room left after all that food. It was pretty good. We had such a great experience here, and cannot wait to return to get some more hot links and check out the butcher shop!"}
{"text":"Awesome BBQ and Exceptional Service!  Enjoyed the Burnt End, Brisket pork ribs with Mac & Cheese and Slaw! Delicious!"}
{"text":"The best barbecue in town nice staff they even have a customer appreciation day where they give out free food, the macaroni cheese is my favorite the baked beans cook perfect nice sweet with a buttery flavor to it I would recommend this to anyone that love barbecue"}
{"text":"Great BBQ!   Seating is outside and rustic.   There was a long line but it moved quickly.   Service was fun and friendly!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best barbecue in town! I first heard about this place on Diners, Drive ins, and Dives. So we decided to check it out. I fell in love at first bite. Everything that I have had from there has been excellent. My favorite is the three item plate with rib tips, ribs, and extra rib tips with macaroni and cheese, and the delectable yams. The portions are extra large and great to have leftovers. Oh, and I can't forget the peach and apple cobbler! Sometimes they have cherry cobbler. Everything is made fresh and in house. The staff is very friendly, happy-go-lucky people."}
{"text":"I can't begin to explain the goodness that comes from their smokers and grills.  The brisket is one of my favorites!!  Love the mac-n-cheese as well as the baked beans for the side.  You just have to try the cobbler as well."}
{"text":"Sadly nothing special. this makes the third locations I've seen on DDD that has let me down. It's nice that you get corn bread with every meal, and the mac and cheese was alright but I was just sadly dissapointed the chicken was surprisingly dry, and even for my sweet pallet the sweet potatoes were too sweet! Something I've never said in my entire life. I think this will be the last time I drive out of my way to head to a knew spot from food network."}
{"text":"WOW......the food here was AMAZING!  I have been thinking about it since.  The mac and cheese is the best I have ever had.  I also had the beef brisket sandwich and the meat just fell apart....it was super tender.  I really loved the bbq sauce.  All together it was a great meal and I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in town. Extremely friendly staff. Was taken on a tour and given the history of the restaurant. You can go in the back and watch the smokers and grilling in live time.   Brings the whole family. Portions were very generous and the prices weren't bad at all. Had the ribs & brisket which were excellent. Cornbread literally tasted like butter.  A++"}
{"text":"I thought my GPS was sending me on a wild goose chase. Ended up in a subdivision in the middle of nowhere, but found heaven. The ribs were fabulous, and the brisket was almost as good as mine (of course I'm biased). The employees were great...Nice, courteous young men."}
{"text":"After watching this restaurant on DDD, I knew the next time I was in LV that I had to stop by and try it out.  I was very pleased by how nice the staff was, since I had a few questions when I walked in.  I decided to try the ribs, brisket, and hot link, with a side of mac & cheese and potato salad.  I was thinking that there would be an inside area to eat because lets face it, it was hot outside.  There was no inside seating, but there were a few benches on the outside which had misters.  I could tell that majority of the locals who came in just picked their food up and left, but since my hotel was on the strip and that was a 20-25 minutes drive, I didn't want to wait.  This is the type of place that I enjoy going to, since it worked as buffet line and you would inch you way closer to the exit by the time you received your food.  I will come back to this place whenever I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"If you love BBQ this is a must in Vegas. Definitely the best BBQ I've had in this town hands down!   Ordered the 3 meat combo to share with selection of two sides, we chose: Brisket (super moist and flavorful) Ribs (smokey and rich with that fresh off the BBQ taste) Pulled pork (sweet and savory) Mac and cheese (definitely for a cheese lover) Potatoe salad (two thumbs up) Corn bread   It was a little bit of a drive for me since I live on the south end of town but I will definitely make the trip again for this gem."}
{"text":"FIRST TIME HERE  LAST WEEK !!! OOOOOOOWWWEEEE it is amazing, and everyone that works here is sooo nice and they all have smiles, I was absolutely taken by the chicken and the mac and cheese! one of my top 5 places to eat now man !!! and the price is awesome !"}
{"text":"If you have a car in Las Vegas, this is a great spot to venture to if you are super hungry for great meat.  You can order raw meat to take home and cook yourself or enjoy a hearty meal on site.  The pulled pork was juicy and the sliced brisket tender.  Each meal came with two sides and choice of bread.  The cornbread is awesome!  For sides, I couldn't get enough of the mac & cheese and the baked beans.  The potato salad was also very tasty.  The \"Dinner\" meals are A LOT of food, and can easily be two meals.  The combos could be shared or eaten as 3 meals!"}
{"text":"Kinda of confusing as to where to enter and which line was for what. But after the mini maze it was well worth it! I had rib tips and my hubby the 3 meat combo. I had baked beans and potato salad, it was delicious! Hubby had brisket, hot links and rib tips and yams and potato salad. He said the yams weren't real sweet but he liked them. Meat was well seasoned, tender and we both liked the bbq sauce. Don't forget to order your drink like we did lol"}
{"text":"Great BBQ, great people who work there.  I can't say no to a beer while I'm waiting in line for BBQ.  Pulled pork, ribs, brisket, potato salad, and macaroni and cheese was GREAT!!!!!  Eat here!!!"}
{"text":"When the hubs was going to LV for his bachelor party weekend, I suggested that they stop by here to grab a bite to eat before they get to the strip. He said that he and his buddies had a great, filling meal and that it was an overall great start to the weekend.  So when we planned a Christmas weekend in LV, he wanted to take me to Road Kill for a meal.   We ordered a three meat plate and it was more than enough for the two of us to share. The hubs liked the pulled pork and the sausage; I fell in love with the rib tips and pulled pork.  Make sure you get the rib tips with the spicy BBQ sauce.  The cornbread was delicious, and DON'T FORGET TO GET THEIR MAC AND CHEESE AND BAKED BEANS!!!  I think I could have eaten a bowl of their mac and cheese and baked beans and been happy...  Well, maybe some rib tips on the side wouldn't hurt..."}
{"text":"Every time we go to Vegas we always so in to eat at John Mull's. This time was extra special. I walked outside after i got my food and Ritchie gave me the royal tour. He showed me how all the meat was processed and introduced me to the employees. I have never had brisket as tender and most as this place.  Don't forget to bring home some sausage and jerkey when you go. It's great."}
{"text":"I heard about this place from my dad, who saw it on Guy Fieri's \" Diners, Drive-ins and Dives\". So I figured it was good. Sadly, I was disappointed. The brisket was overcooked, the pulled pork was too salty and covered in too much sauce. The only thing I liked was the green beans and cornbread.   On a more positive note, the butcher side of the house was great! I bought a 3lb tri-tip, 5lbs links and 4lbs ribeye all for $82. Such a great deal and fantastic cuts of meat. I would definitely still come here to purchase meats from the butcher shop."}
{"text":"I have been looking for this place ever since I left Chicago 35 years ago ... hands down the best rib joint in Las Vegas, this will be my new home worth the 35 minute drive"}
{"text":"There has been a whole lot of chatter in the work space recently about what was initially called the Road Kill Grill but what I now know is John Mull's Meats & Road Kill Grill ( not even gonna abbreviate this one).  I mark this day 09/26/13, a day of BBQ spiritual revival when several weeks of talk became a reality.  Not knowing what to expect, I listened to veterans prepare me as we went to all place, McDonalds. What the hell does Mickey D's have to do with this review?! I will tell you.  It was to pick up cheap beverages  prior to our arrival.  John Mull's Meats & Road Kill Grill has beverages allows you to bring whatever you like to drink.....more on that later.  I picked up my partner and he and I while driving north bound on Rancho, made a left on Gowan, and then a left on Thom to arrive at the Eden of Flame Cooked Protein.  You can't miss it from there.  As we pulled into the gravel parking lot, we both said to each other...\"What the F#$& is this place?\"  Surreal given it's been around since the 40's,, and who knows how many animals have given their lives to making meat eating people happy.  The group rallied up and we went inside.  The inside is a combination food line on the left and butcher shop on the right.  Given the atmosphere after seeing a stuffed coyote and and skull with small antlers ...Garett A. later said and I quote \"It's a man cave of meat.\"  With that said, you don't eat in the man cave, you dine outside.  On this particular outing, I ordered up a three meat combo consisting of the following:  Meats: Pulled Pork, Brisket, Tri-Tip (Tuesday & Thursday). Sides:  Baked Beans & Mac & Cheese.  When I picked up and paid for my chow ($20 w/ tip), I sat and ate in silence, trying to eat everything while it was still hot.    The meat was outstanding.  My favorite was the Tri-Tip.    The sides were outstanding.  Mac & Cheese was so damn cheesy.  The baked beans were hearty and not like the commercial grade can beans you get in a grocery store or someone's backyard BBQ.  The word around the gravel parking lot is John has free beer on Saturdays.  Nothing would be finer to complement the fantastic grub on a Saturday this a few barley sodas!  It is 11:11PM and I am still stuffed/satisfied from a truly glorious lunch.  I can't wait to go back.    Check it out!!!.... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tE6pyR2Tl5U   It starts at 11:01"}
{"text":"I ordered the brisket but was graciously given a single rib to try for future reference. Wow, definitely worth the rib they gave me, because I will DEFINITELY go back and order the ribs. Super tender, beautifully seasoned, and not doused in BBQ sauce for flavor. I am not even sure I would put their delicious sauce on my next order of ribs because the ribs were so great by themselves. Oh and back to the brisket, it's easy to forget anything when thinking about those ribs. Brisket sandwich was HUGE, and delicious. My buddy ordered Pulled Pork and that was great too. Service is top notch and I will gladly drive back to North Town for more!!"}
{"text":"Been living in vegas for 20+ years and have heard about this joint - finally got over here -- so cool - the real deal - some of the best bbq in vegas.  Ok here we go - tried lots of items. Best of the best: Rib tips Burnt ends Brisket Hot links Chicken Baked beans - best ever period Corn bread  Also good: Ribs Green beans Yams Collard greens Mac salad  Better at other places: Mac & cheese Cole slaw  The vibe at this place is great - so authentic - outdoor cooking and picnic tables under tents - wish I tried this place 20 years ago.  Too much bbq calories wasted on Mephis, Dickeys, and famous Dave's-- Rollin smoke is still getting some of my treasure.  Check this place out!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  The rib tips were amazing! Good amount of meat and it comes in a full plate with a side. Husband loved the pulled chicken.  Spicy bbq is just right.  Not super spicy but just right. Now im craving this place like crazy."}
{"text":"This was delicious! Had the tri tip sandwich, they didn't have brisket, and it was perfectly seasoned. I tasted my husband's links & those were yummy too. *tip* you can bring your own drink or buy a bottled water or canned soda for $1.00. I liked the peach cobbler but for the size,  I didn't think it was worth $3.00."}
{"text":"My family and I go here often to get good bbq.. The ribs are tender and the rib tips are tender and full of meat. I normally get the mac and cheese and potatoe salad but dont think that's the only thing that good. I've tried all the sides and they are all good. Also cant pass on the peach cobler yum"}
{"text":"Everyone knows the legend that is John Mull's and if you don't.... get here now! This is a true working mans barbecue joint. It's what BBQ is supposed to be. Not fancy, but slow and steady cooked delicious fare that warms the soul.  They accomplish this in every point. My only qualm is the indoor building is not at all setup to be a takeout place. The door and the line just don't gel, it makes for a very confusing and annoying visit sometimes. I'm sure there is nothing that can be done about it but it is what it is. I've recently been turned into the butcher side of things. Good lord the steaks here are high quality and extremely well priced for what you get. You pay half here what you would at a restaurant for the same steak. All you have to do is cook it! Thanks John Mull's."}
{"text":"This is the spot. Period.  Except for the tasteless road kill name, this place is perfect--a true gem. In the city of sin, box chains, and strip malls, this BBQ post provides the ideal escape for some soul satisfying Americana. They have the best mac n' cheese and the best pulled pork this boy eva had... and I've been through KC and Texas a few times.   Take a trip up north to the rural side of town and I promise you will return again and again. Oh, and there's a varietal of free domestic beer on Saturdays. See you there."}
{"text":"Road Kill grill  is by far the best and I mean BEST bbq I have had in my 20+ years of living in las vegas nv... It was so good I had lunch here on Wednesday just to turn around and come right back on Thursday and please believe me when I say that I will be back on Friday! On top of the food being delicious, the staff is what adds the umph, very hospitable and makes one feel more like family rather then just another hungry customer...Kim, Delilah, and Larry and everyone else @ roadkill  KEEP UP THE FANTASTIC WORK!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food. The meet is definitely the star but there sides very close second that macaroni and cheese the BBQ beans o my god. The only reason I would give them a four star is because sometimes you have to sit outside in the dust and wind sucks, if it's a nice spring day 70° with no wind this is the spot. Well you can always take it to go And eat it in The comfort of your home. So Nobody sees your dirty hands in the barbecue sauce all over your face."}
{"text":"Great BBQ especially the burnt ends! Quality meat and sides.   Great service!  Brenda is awesome!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Vegas  great friendly staff consistently quality pulled pork and chicken are amazing. Mac and cheese is flavorful!"}
{"text":"I really really wanted to LOVE  this place and was super excited after reading the reviews. But honesty is the best policy!   We ordered the 3 meat meal- pork ribs, brisket and hot link sausage. The sausage (wet) was good! The pork ribs and brisket were a let down. The Brisket was bland and the pork ribs had little to no flavor. The BBQ sauce made it all better! The sides were good: the potato salad, beans and a side of greens and corn bread. The corn bread was a tad sweet, but balanced a little when eaten with the greens.   Service was good and fast! I'm really happy we got to try it! Of course, this is just my opinion! You have to try it to find out! ?"}
{"text":"Don't get scared of the line! It's so worth it! The hot links are fantastic, and the green beans are done so well even a veggie hater will eat them."}
{"text":"I've had some pretty bad BBQ in Vegas and have only one restaurant I frequent and was afraid to try something new, but my hubby has been wanting to go here for quite some time. We decided to go since we had family in town who wanted to go here as well.  -Chicken soggy bland and seemed like it was sitting out a while  - hot links (I'm indifferent. I tried it but it was drowned in sauce.   - brisket 0 stars. Dry dry dry.   - pork ribs - these were my favorite of all the meats, tender and flavorful but not the best pork ribs I've ever had.  -rib tips - very dry  - beef rib (this was the only meat they actually grilled and brought to us) and it was not as tender as I had hoped for and was drowned in BBQ sauce. It was ok nothing I would want to come back for.  My favorite part of the meal was the Mac n cheese, collard greens, yams, and cornbread.   The other sides we got mac salad and green beans were nothing special.   One thing I noticed is that all the meat is sitting already cooked and sliced and in metal containers/warmers. I'm no expert but I believe that's what is causing the drying out of the meats.  Unfortunately they fell short for me and I am back to my regular spot."}
{"text":"Excellent food great people trey and Larry helped us very friendly will come here every time were in Vegas portion size is huge you will not leave hungry"}
{"text":"This place is a must eat! I didn't expect a place like this to be in Vegas, I felt like I was on a small town ranch. The meat was perfectly smoked and tender and full of flavor! The portions are huge and inexpensive."}
{"text":"You will NOT leave this place hungry!  I'm a Food Network fan, so I had to check this place out when I saw it featured one evening on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives.  Don't let the location frighten you, as your GPS will guide you into a combination residential/commercial/farming/ranching part of Las Vegas not far from the strip.  My wife and I, along with our two teenagers were blown away by the quantity AND quality of the food!  Everything is homemade here.  The mac n' cheese is unbelievably delicious! Not-to-mention the brisket, ribs, chicken, pulled pork, green beans, baked beans, macaroni salad...and cobbler for dessert.  They make their own BBQ sauce used for dipping (both regular and hot).  We tried it all, and will definitely be back!  The eating area is all outside on picnic tables.  The owner made his way around the tables to greet everyone.  We went during a week night (he mentioned Fridays and Saturdays are the most crowded).  This place is an outstanding value for BBQ.  It will definitely be our first eating stop when we return to Vegas!"}
{"text":"We live in Green Valley and were on our way home from Mt Charleston and were craving BBQ so we looked up this place and before I even start, YES it is in a random housing neighborhood NO your gps is not wrong NO you will not regret this trip. I got the pick two with tri tip and brisket and I have never had BBQ this good in all of Nevada. This has become our new favorite spot oh and we struck up a conversation with the cooks on our way to the bathroom and they gave us a tour around and everything was being cooked and prepared completely fresh and the meat smokers were the most heavenly things to smell. You have to come here. No matter how far you live"}
{"text":"Oh! How I love this place!!! The hotlinks are pretty much a staple of mine! A definite must try! :-D"}
{"text":"My boyfriend tells me we are going to a BBQ place so of course I'm game to go! He takes me in so old neighborhood of homes then BLAM in the middle of it is some restaurant with picnic tables outside. All I see are people walking out with all of these crates of eggs! I'm thinking \"what the heck?\" If he took me at night no way would I have left the car!! So we proceeded inside because I'm in love and trust this man with my life for some strange reason. You order your combination plate and move down a line like a soup kitchen. Then once you pay you are ushered right out the back door. We sat at one of the picnic tables outside since it was a nice day. Man O man! This was some awesome grubbage! I'm still having dreams about the macaroni and cheese! My guy even snuck back on another day just to buy himself a jar of the BBQ sauce! Don't let the exterior fool you. This is the main place to go in Vegas for some BBQ!"}
{"text":"Get name tags! Have a cocktail waitress serving drinks in line. We were sooooooo thirsty waiting in the long line. I'll be your cocktail waitress, there is more money your business can make. I will go back for sure! The boiled-smoked ribs were flavored perfectly but this was the first time I have ever had a chewy rib and couldn't pull it off the bone. I boil bbq chicken than grill but you cant do ribs this way it gets chewy. The coleslaw needs more seasoning, like celery seed. The chef needs to lay off the onions, there is way too much onion in the coleslaw. I love coleslaw and I am always shocked when restaurants can't get this right. They also didn't have fries. Good coleslaw and fries are a major necessity for BBQ restaurants. The onion is balanced in the Mac n cheese, which was outstanding, but I would never add chunky onions to Mac n cheese. Shred with cheese grader or use powder. I hate leaving a restaurant and tastin garlic or onion breathe. The hotlink was ok,  thought it would be spicier. The cornbread or as I call it corn sugar cookie was one of the best things I ever ate! I am requesting these corn bread cakes for my next birthday. I think they would save money if they didn't let you grab sauce in styrofoam & lid. Have it in a large pump like McDonald's but a larger sauce cup. This place is half great and half ok. They need to fine tune all the dishes (log & analyze your comments from yelp or comment cards, then track your repetitive issues and fix it) They should shop for investors and move locations. They are in the middle of a neighborhood and not the best part of town. This is a unique place reminds me of restaurants in the Caribbean. So the location and non formality of it is charming and rad! Good luck and see yah soon!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. .The mac -n-cheese is to die for. ..The green beans are so yummy...we have been here a few times and never a disappointment"}
{"text":"By far the most consistent and best BBQ in the South West. I'm from the Midwest Omaha NE. & I have had the best from KC, Chicago, Omaha, Austin, Atlsnta etc. And I was astonished to find out the neon desert could compete in the BBQ arena now. Hence Roadkill Grill! My only gripe is that I live on the opposite side of town, but either way its always well worth it. 5 stars all day."}
{"text":"Worthy of the hype. Wait for Saturday lunch wasn't too bad just after noon, line itself isn't that long but goes a bit slow. Employees are working hard with smiles on their faces, though.  But you come here for the food!  The three meat plate is the best value, and the portions are huge- this is easily split between a couple, add on a dessert if you dare. The HOTLINK is \"easily one of the best I've had,\" says the BF. We both thought the RIB TIPS were amazing, and were both a little pickier than necessary about the BRISKET- blame our time in Texas for that, but it's still lightyears better than most other versions here in Vegas. The sides are pretty solid, too: the COLLARD GREENS are seasoned well with meat and onions mixed in, but the MAC AND CHEESE wins all the awards here- it's one of the best versions I've had outside of someone's home. The CORNBREAD and PEACH COBBLER also were really good, and clearly homemade.  Menu is small, but everything we tried was really well executed. Location has some limitations, but I like the down home style. I'll definitely be keeping it in mind the next time a barbecue craving hits."}
{"text":"Have known about this place for a cple of years and everytime I'm in Vegas I never get a chance to get there for one reason or another.... Until today and I have to say it's a love/hate thing going on.   Love- Food was excellent, there were 4 of us and we decided to all get 3 way combos so we could sample all the meats, and it was all VERY GOOD, great flavor and very generous servings (go Ritchie! ), sides were off the hook and don't even get me started on their cornbread!  I've had good and bad BBQ all over the country and this place holds its own with the best, hands down!!!  Staff was very friendly and when you finaly make it inside, they only let 5 orders in at a time, there's  Ritchie dishin it up, huge portions and a great attitude, he was great, made the long wait enjoyable. Larry was also very accommodating, and Chuck was the chill guy at the register. Oh, btw, prices I think on the low side for what you get...   Hate- the fact that it took me this long to get there...   A MUST GO TO SPOT WHEN IN VEGAS!"}
{"text":"just writing this makes me want to go back!!! I had the best brisket ever, nice and tender. Generous portions and it was all sooooo good. You have to try it."}
{"text":"We did not eat at the Road Kill Grill instead we Came here to pick up my 5 bone standing rib roast. It was good, but it wasn't great. Didn't have any more flavor or tenderness than a supermarket brand and it was expensive."}
{"text":"When you can smell the BBQ from down the street...  The location is a bit unusual as it's in a residential neighborhood but you can't miss this place because the aromas will lead you there.  Things to note ~   Only outdoor seating Don't skip on the beans (the best I've ever had) Lines can get long because this place is popular Store & butcher shop on property  The service was extremely friendly and they were kind enough to let us sample some of their sides because I had a hard time deciding what to get.   We loved the beans, mac & cheese, corn bread, pulled pork and potato salad. The pulled chicken was a little too heavy on the sauce and the ribs weren't as tender as we like.   We'll be back to sample some of the other offerings for sure!   It's a fun experience because you eat outside at a picnic table and you get to smell what's cooking from start to finish."}
{"text":"Was craving barbecue and decided to give this place a try. I wasn't disappointed. Was a little shocked that you had to wait outside to place order and receive food. But I quickly got over that once I was hit with the wonderful smell of barbecue smoke. The line was not long, however the family of six in front of me had some issues deciphering the menu. The young lady took my order and I was on my way to rib heaven. I order a slab of ribs with the baked beans. I waited until I got home to eat, as there is no dainty way to tear into ribs.  The ribs were moist, tender and divine. They put all the other chain barbecue restaurants to shame. The baked beans were delicious as well. They had ground beef in them and a smoky sweet flavor. I will be returning when I get another rib craving."}
{"text":"This restaurant gets better every time I go (3-4 × a month)! Staff and people are super fun. John and his family are so humble and he often speaks to people with the patrons even taking photos. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I have been living here for 11 years and just recently became active regularly on Yelp. We just happened to be in the area and I was not a fan of Vegas BBQ mainly because I didn't see beyond the chain restaurants (not a fan).  The place looks like someone's back yard and smells of smoke, wood, and Meat. You walk in and the lines are long and there is a bit of a wait. So worth it! Everyone was very friendly, cracked jokes, laughed, and made everyone feels at home.  We had the yams - delightful, collard greens - amazing, Mac-n-cheese - made me dance, macaroni salad - pretty good, sausage - WTH, rib tips - TASTY, ribs - phenomenal!!! I see more trips there in my immediate future. I can't wait to take my family when they visit.  I absolutely love it."}
{"text":"Best beef brisket and bbq chicken i have ever had! Very affordable and awesome owner."}
{"text":"Amazing beef ribs. Very tender and well seasoned. Pork ribs and sides were great too.  Definitely a must try."}
{"text":"Definitely a place to visit if you love BBQ meat. Brisket is soft  and moist, ribs are very juicy, it has a good seasoning and the meat falls off the bone, hot link is good and moist inside the spice is just enough to give you more appetite to eat last the pulled pork  i don't usually eat pork but man i was drooling for some more after my first bite"}
{"text":"I usually come here once a week and recommend everybody to try their food . Well today i had the 3 meat combo . The ribs was real tuff . The rib tips was all fat . The chicken was mediocre . Their mac n cheese which is my favorite thing to get isn't my favorite no more it was so bland .. After today i wouldn't be returning."}
{"text":"Tasty Mac n cheese, tasty cobbler. Brisket was not what I'd expect, flavor didn't do it for me, rib tips very fatty.  Kitchen area looked dirty to me, butchering area in the same room.  Eating outside with the smell of the farm was a bit much for me (even growing up raising beef). I marked this one down as a total tourist trap getting WAY more business than they deserve due to some TV time."}
{"text":"So Yelp sent out this email talking about the Dibs on Ribs.  Being the day before the 4th of July, we were definitely in the mood for good BBQ.  My friend \"O\" remembered this place as being a great meat market and I recalled the triple D episode on it, so we faxed our order in.  O said she got there early, just before the rush!  Our pork ribs were da bomb, tender and flavorful--very generous portions of thinly sliced, tasty brisket, too.  Mac-n-cheese was nice, but the star side order for me was the green beans, with ham hocks and potatoes and spot-on seasoning.  We were so achingly full after the ribs and all, but still dug into the desserts.  OMG, the warm peach cobbler was almost orgasmic--seriously.  Anyway, great lunch for us, with enough leftover for dinner!"}
{"text":"I've never had better in Nevada. I've been to a lot of different joints and this place was hands down the best."}
{"text":"This place is a bit off the beaten path and you're going to wonder if it's at someone's residence but it's not.   Get the burnt tips, they are insane! Ribs were awesome and potato salad was great. I didn't like the coleslaw, it wasn't sweet at all.   Best bbq I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I ate the best pulled pork sandwich I've had in a very long time. My wife ate the brisket, and she said it was perfect.  This was easily the best BBQ I've had since moving to Vegas.  We had sides of mac & cheese, potato salad, green beans & taters, and baked beans.  The mac & cheese and green beans were amazing.  The potato salad was pretty standard fare, and the baked beans were not what I expected (but still not bad)  The portions were huge, and we both left with leftovers.  They only had cans of soda to drink, and (obviously) no refills.  When eating spicy BBQ sauce, I would love more than 12oz. of soda to cool off.  If they had refillable fountain drinks, I would easily give 5 stars."}
{"text":"After hearing so much about the bbq here I finally had to check it out for myself. I was not disappointed. I had the ribs, tri tips, and hot links. Also shared bites of the pulled pork, pulled chicken, and brisket. All absolutely delicious!! The guy inside taking orders was very friendly and helpful ... being first timers and all. Make sure you grab a side of their spicy bbq sauce for dipping when you pay. Plus, they let you bring your own drinks! And he said \"ANY\" type of drink. Hint hint. I will surely be exposing friends and family to roadkill grill. It's that good. Oh!!!! The baked beans!! I dont even really care for beans, the beans here were incredible. I am now a loyal customer. The only question I have now is why did it take me so long to go here?! 5 stars."}
{"text":"My sister and I were driving around increasly getting \"hangry\", we asked a gentleman if there was a little hole in the wall resturant that had good soul food. He pointed us in the direction of John Mulls Roadkill Grill. \"OMG\", this place is amazing. There was a line outside the door because you couldnt possibly fit anymore customers inside. To the right was cold meats where you place your butcher order, everything from bacon, pig jowls, and even deer meat in the fall. The people knew the customers by name, and if you spent $60 you got a free flat of eggs. We ordered rib tips, brisket, and pulled pork, with potatoe salad, and baked beans, and also peach cobbler. The food is so amazing, I would even consider trying the deer meat in the fall, when the cooks are this good why not? The customer service is like great customer service used to be when owners cared, and employees were happy. I could go on and on, but I'll just show let the pictures wrap this review up."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in the world of meat. The woman behind the counter was very friendly and helpful. The meat is excellent, and you get a free flat of 30 eggs with a minimum purchase."}
{"text":"We were in Vegas for a conference and a coworker say this on food network so we decided to try it out. Bbq was very good. Ribs are fall off the bone tender & the chicken is perfectly seasoned. I highly recommend the Mac and cheese, the best I've ever had. Get there early because the line does start to get long and the building is both a butcher shop and restaurant."}
{"text":"Wowowee! This word would be an understatement had a great amazing experience. This place is nothing fancy who need it anyway. By far the food are amazing had the 3 meat combo our favorites is the smoke ribs and chicken with mac/ cheese and beans great flavor. The flavor has a deep smoke taste that could be eating all day long LOL. The cashier/server great personality happy and bubbly they really want to create a wonderful experience just be nice as always  This would be my weekly hangout if I could help it and my stop over when my out of town guest come by in Las vegas, it would not disappoint. They also have a meat market for all kinds of meat and seafood.  Great discovery in Northwest Las vegas!"}
{"text":"Fantastic BQ you can smell them cooking for miles. There's also a fantastic Butcher Shop on the property, Best mouth watering steaks in Las Vegas, fair prices but the quality is so much better than what you get in your local supermarket."}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous. The ribs are always meaty, flavorful, and tender.  Good portions also. The ribs actually taste like they've been grilled instead of baked.  The baked beans are great as well. They're made with hamburger and green pepper.   You can call ahead on weekdays, and that is highly suggested. On Saturdays you're going to wait at least an hour in line."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for about 4 years now. I really enjoy it. The atmosphere is fun and kicked back. Reminds me of simpler times in Northern California. They still butcher game and it's neat to see it. The food is delicious. I always get ribs and hot links. Whole hot links for me, but friends love the sliced links in sauce. Mac n Cheese is great, macaroni salad is really solid too. The place seems very clean and the employees all seem proud of the place. I only wish they had fountain drinks, but that's a small price to pay."}
{"text":"When I found out, this place was in someone's back yard, i don't think words could express my disapproval. however  to my dismay, this place was amazing. Moreover, it's a must try when in Vegas."}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ!! The sauce was just the amount of spice and the BBQ was tender and perfectly grilled. A little out of the way in North Las Vegas, but worth the drive."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!! The most amazing. Ever. Fresh cut delicious meat and all the sides are scrumptious. Not for health buffs, but great for anyone who loves happiness. Highly recommended. I eat here at least once a week!"}
{"text":"Me and my husband when here because we saw it on diners drive-ins and dives with Guy Vietti and it was really good you only thing that I didn't like was the apple crumble or apple pie or whatever it's called because it had the weirdest texture (in definitely a texture person) but tasted alright."}
{"text":"Awesome BBQ. All meats I have ordered over the past year have always had great flavor, and don't forget the cobbler for desert."}
{"text":"OMG *faints* 2 1/2 yrs in Vegas and this was my first time coming here which I wish would've been waaay sooner. I just left from here and I guess it gets pretty busy on Saturdays so be prepared to wait. I believe I waited around 45 minutes-1 hr but boy was it worth it! The prices were actually pretty cheap compared to other bbq places and they actually give you your money's worth. While waiting in line they gave us cold bottles of water and when we got our order we got an extra free peach cobbler for the wait. This food was by far the best bbq I've had in Vegas. I had the pulled pork dinner with mac & cheese and baked beans with peach cobbler for dessert. Everything was sooo fulfilling and scrumptious and the portions were BIG.  Everybody was friendly and I enjoyed the classic r&b songs they played while we were waiting. I'll definitely be back to get my fix in the future."}
{"text":"The best BBQ in Las Vegas. After moving to the area from Virginia...my search for the best BBQ in Vegas has ended  After a drive through what looks like normal neighborhood..you'll find John Mull's. 1. When you get to the entrance, the meat counter is on the right and the cooked food is to the left. 2. Tri tip and ribs with collards and potato salad were delicious..but really order whatever your BBQ craving heart desires and you won't be disappointed. 3. Ask for extra sauce at the end when you pay 4. No cups for water..buy a bottle for a $1. 5. Outdoor seating only. Be ready to get your grub on 6. Do not skip out on the cobbler...i just wish they had ice cream."}
{"text":"Some of the staff are lovely. Some of the staff think work is beneath them. Some of the staff want you to know they hate you.    But that's fine, I'm not expecting five star service at a butcher's shop or an open air BBQ cart.  What I am expecting is my order to be correct.  Not close enough, not what we've decided to give you. What I order.  My first experience was not great. My order was just a couple things and the quality was not that great. But everyone said give them another try so I made the mistake and did.  I thought maybe I got the wrong things last time and widened my order. And didn't get my order, because a full half of my order was wrong.  I don't know about you but when I order two steaks cut two inches thick, four steaks cut one third of an inch thick is not acceptable.  When I order ground pork, I do not want bulk house sausage.  And of course, because everything is wrapped where you can t monitor it, you don't find out until it is too late.  Their prices may be fine but the quality is grocery store level and at least the grocery store gets my order right.  I will stick with other butchers in town. They may not provide some of the cuts I want and refuse to do custom orders, but at least I won't be wasting my money."}
{"text":"You guys ROCK when it comes to MEATS, BBQ and SERVICE!  This is hands down the best butcher shop/catering in Las Vegas!   We love the jerky, meats and BBQ Ribs.  We have tasted many things on their menu and it is all very good.  Nita & Chuck make it a very friendly place to visit!  Thanks again, for being in our neighborhood!  Nat & T"}
{"text":"O-M-G!!! Any bad review from this place is an absolute joke.. I read some chick say \"I think Famous Dave's is better..\" ROTFLMAO right, and McDonalds is better than In-N-Out & SmashBurger too huh?"}
{"text":"So my cousin, who's from Texas and recently moved to Vegas suggested that we go this spot that's been on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.  Certainly Guy would know, right?  Good location and the awesome aroma of barbecue... I'm in.  After our 45 minute wait, I was excited even though they ran out of pulled pork.  So with my two meat plate of ribs, pulled chicken, mac & cheese, collard greens; I was ready.  Welp... I was not impressed.  I just kept thinking, \"I could've done this at home.\"  It was mediocre and did not stand up to its rave reviews."}
{"text":"MUST HAVE every trip to Vegas. I am NOT a fan of mac & cheese, yet I love it here. We have friends who demand us to bring them this whenever we go as well. Meat is tender and fabulous. Mac & Cheese is amazing! I love the friendly service everybody always has here as well. Don't let the fencing or outside table bother you. THIS place puts any in Hollywood to shame. We love it. Definitely worth a try. Of course we follow it up at our favorite bakery, but that is another story."}
{"text":"Love it is all I can day.  Great food, great employees.  It's a pleasure to be a customer."}
{"text":"This place is by far one of the best BBQ places I have ever ate at. The baked beans, brisket, ribs, mac n cheese were incredible. The portions are huge and delicious. I live across town and do not mind driving over here to eat. The eating area is outdoors which is the only drawback. It's just too damn hot in the summer here in Vegas to be eating out doors. Besides that, the food is great and I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The BEST BBQ in Vegas!!  You can't go wrong with this one!  Everything is delicious! Larry is the best!  We love this place.  Make sure to try the hot links and pulled BBQ chicken!  Also the brisket is the best!  Desert?  He'll yeah!!  The cobblers are fantastic too!  My favorite is the peach!  They really are the best!  Very low-key.  Come as you are!  Try it all and go home full, with left-overs for the next day and you'll still be daydreaming about the next time!  Their BBQ is like drugs......ADDICTIVE!"}
{"text":"Best Barbecue ever! It threw me off being in the middle of a neighborhood, but that's what makes it awesome."}
{"text":"A city runs through it.  Las Vegas grew around this place, originally a game dressing shop.  Chuck Frommer has expanded it into the best butcher shop I know of."}
{"text":"As someone from the south, the Las Vegas BBQ scene has always been a source of disappointment. Most BBQ places are comically bad, both in terms of the meat itself and oftentimes more so in terms of the sides. So I went to the Road Kill Grill with pretty low expectations.   My expectations were greatly exceeded- the food here is definitely passable and I think this place more than earns its \"best vegas BBQ\" reputation. Before I get to the pros let me explain quickly why I took off two stars:  1. Only outdoor seating. In Vegas. Let me tell you something about the average BBQ eater- they are fat people. When its 100 degrees outside they go into hibernation like a grizzly bear. They don't want to sit outside when eating their BBQ.  2. The service was pretty slow. There were only 3 people in front of me when I got in line and getting the food still took about 25 minutes. I don't mind a wait, especially when the food is good, but this delay was clearly due to under staffing/inexperience as all the food was ready it just needed to be dished out more efficiently. The design of their service line leaves much to be desired- a little rearranging so that more than 1 person could get involved and this problem would be instantly solved/service would speed up 10x.    The food  I got a 3 meat plate. The highlight was definitely the sausage in BBQ sauce which was very flavorful. The ribs were definitely a little on the dry side but still quite good for Vegas. The brisket sits in a vat of liquid so it was moist but a little tough/needed to be slow cooked longer. The mac and cheese was very decent but the baked beans were way to vinegary for my taste.  I will definitely be going back, although maybe in winter, and checking out the butcher products as well."}
{"text":"The brisket and hot links are delicious. I loved all of the sides but the Mac and cheese is my favorite."}
{"text":"Had tri-tip and ribs with macaroni salad and yams. Meat was super tender and flavorful, best barbeque I've ever had. Sides were great, too."}
{"text":"Arrived at 2pm on a Saturday- a busy time no doubt but we'd been here before and enjoy the food. We were told they were out of brisket. After waiting in line about 35 minutes we placed our order- 5 two-meat combos- all pulled chicken and tri-tip. Once we got to the counter for them to fill our order they then told us they were out of tri-tip and that it'd be a few minutes for the next batch to be done. They put our ticket aside as we waited. Tri-tip was done- but then they proceeded to fill singleton orders that came in behind ours, forgetting about our order. So now- no more tri-tip... again. Then they said brisket would be ready in a few minutes- we waited. After another LONG 45 minute wait, we were once again told that they were now out of brisket. Are you SERIOUS? I sighed and the man (\"Slick\" they call him) behind the counter could sense my frustration. He began to try to make light of the situation saying things like \"aww don't get mad Erin.\" (Your name is on your ticket order) And proceeds to turn to the others behind the counter saying, \"we done made Erin mad.\" I don't know about you- but after an HOUR AND TWENTY MINUTE WAIT- you're right. I'm mad. And chastising your PAYING customers for your mistakes isn't the way to earn my business or my money. We asked for our $87 dollar refund and got the hell out of there. We won't be back."}
{"text":"This is probably the best BBQ I've ever had, and it's literally in someone's backyard. I got pulled pork, mac and cheese, and cornbread. It was phenomenal! The service was also really good. I can't wait to go back and try more of what they have."}
{"text":"Yasssssssssss baby come through I've had the meat from here at a my brothers bbq but which he cooked it himself  and it was some damn good stuff but I've just been craving bbq  couldn't risk it so I asked around all fingers pointed here and let me tell you nothing in the city can compare in my opinion I had the three meat platter including ribs brisket hotlinks macaroni greens potato salad corn bread man I was beyond pleased let's call this yummmmmmmmmmytown to say the least I really felt out of the city here the people who worked were so kind and nice especially that good looking tall hunk of chocolate LOL but seriously even small spot with a lot of love put in to the food I just can't wait to have more lol my mouth is watering just thinking about it"}
{"text":"Omg. if you have never eaten here you are missing out Road Kill Grill is the only place I go for BBQ. Ribs big and tasty. brisket  cooked all day for a very tender tasty treat. Chicken rocks but my all time favorite is the Tri-Tip  Tuesdays n Thursdays only. The backed beans are loaded with meat a sweet sauce. The Mac n cheese is the BOMB. corn bread muffins to dye for.  You need to go its a wonderful date night out."}
{"text":"We come to Vegas every year and always try new bbq joints. What peaked our interest with this joint was that we seen it on Diners Drive in's and Dives a few years ago so we decided to take the trek across Vegas to go there. The place seemed pretty authentic and all although I was not very impressed with the overall quality of food. The beef brisk tasted like boiled meat the rib tips were cold and tuff as rawhide and here we are 8 hours later and I am still burping up the sausage which is actually really gross. My fiancé got the quarter chicken diner and it was seriously cold. The only positive thing about this place was that the place was clean and the staff was friendly. In the future we will most likely go to the Rollin Smoke BBQ located conveniently right off the strip by approx 1/2mile."}
{"text":"Just to echo all the rave reviews, this place is awesome. Only got the tritip, but I will definitely be back for more"}
{"text":"Gotta say was in Vegas awhile back and stopped here for BBQ it was amazing there an awesome restaurant and meat market just thought about them recently and am ordering there amazing hot links on line"}
{"text":"A bit out of the way and a super casual place. All of that doesn't bother us but rating is reduced due to overall lack of friendliness and guest service by those working. It wasn't very busy and we basically were ignored while we tried to figure out where to order, how to find utensils, etc. We never found the barbeque sauce either which might have also improved the rating.    On to the food, we split a three meat combo with brisket, ribs, and pulled pork with the cornbread, baked beans and potato salad. We ate there at the covered tables near the misters and even at 3 pm and 100 degrees, it really was very bearable to eat.  The ribs were well flavored but only one was super tasty, tender. That one definitely earned rave reviews. The brisket was tender and meaty but no real smoke or barbeque seasoning. Maybe sauce would have changed our minds but least favorite item on the plate.  The pulled pork was great, small amount of sauce mixed in and was tender and flavorful. As for the sides, cornbread was good, slight sweet; potato salad was mild and creamy and tasted good, best side however was the beans, slightly sweet with good amount of sauce and meat.   The food is good enough for us to go back again but would love to see a bit more friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Huge portion sizes, great prices, delicious food. I went with a large group, and we all left full, happy, and with leftovers. The chicken I got was moist and flavorful, and the service was quick and friendly. The wait time was a bit long (again, I was with a large party, and this place is so good that of course it's going to be busy), but it was well worth it. I can't wait to take my barbeque-loving friends to this hole in the wall."}
{"text":"The first visit is a little confusing - it appears you are pulling into a somebody's driveway and parking behind the house. There is plenty of parking however. Make sure the weather is good because all the seating is outdoors. Since this is Vegas, it hardly ever disappoints.  My wife and I ordered the 3-meat plate with tri-tip, rib tips, and the pulled pork. The two complementary sides we ordered were the cole slaw and the much regarded mac-n-cheese.  Let me start with the rib tips since that is the reason I came. If I could eat only these, I would be a happy man. The meat is tender, seasoned perfect, and cooked perfectly as well. The tri-tip (which is served only on Tuesdays and Thursdays) was thinly sliced, tender, juicy, and much better with the sauce. The pulled pork was a close second to the rib-tips. It was tender, juicy, not too much sauce, and incredible flavor. The mac-n-cheese is not your run of the mill pasta and powdered cheese sauce crap from a box. It is giant pasta, real cheese, meat, and pretty decent flavor. Not bad, but then again, I'm not a mac-n-cheese fan. Finally, the cole slaw. You can really tell whether a BBQ joint is serious by their cole slaw. Sadly, we found a long hair on the first bite and I just couldn't bring myself to try any of it. We ended with the peach cobbler which was outstanding.  I really wish I could give this place a higher rating, I can still taste those rib-tips. Unfortunately the hairy cole slaw just can't be shrugged off. If I return, it will be for the rib tips, and not for any sides. But, they do have other meat selections that I would like to try. After all, this is a butcher shop and it appears they do know how to prepare meat."}
{"text":"I'm from Texas and I was raised in Mississippi most of my life. I was raised on a charcoal grill and with Southern Baptist church potluck soul food. I have been very reluctant and hesitant about trying barbecue out here in Las Vegas because it's so near and dear to me, and it breaks my heart when people do it wrong. Suffice it to say, all of my concerns have been put to rest and I am a fan for life!   I ordered brisket, hot links, and pulled pork (they were out of burnt ends which did disappoint me, but I was in the back of a very long line later in the afternoon) with a side of mac and cheese, collard greens, and some peach cobbler for dessert. Brisket had great flavor, hot links were perfectly spicy (I'd call em about a 6 or 7 for white people lol), pulled pork had great texture, collard greens were a smidge bland (maybe I'd add some hot sauce), and the mac and cheese had a great sauce and melted cheese on top; they were delicious!   The peach cobbler was amazing too; the only thing that was missing was a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. I immediately felt like I was back in the South, especially with the warm and friendly staff. I could hardly have enjoyed the food or my visit anymore; I will be returning and bringing as many people as I can with me!"}
{"text":"Heart of the south barbecue in urban Las Vegas.  Brisket and Ribs were killer and southern style green beans had a surprising kick...we suspect jalapeños.  Mac and cheese is a must and peach cobbler was Georgia sweet.  My favorite (besides the ribs) the corn cake!  Thank you John Mull and staff!"}
{"text":"So overated. I really wanted to like it but this place blows. You can't BBQ with plastic forks, the line is insane. I didn't get sick from it."}
{"text":"The taste was too strong for me.  Maybe need to go back to reevaluate since my friend liked it so much."}
{"text":"They just catered the wedding we attended this weekend! Yummy! I will be looking out for them in town. Brisket was cooked to perfection... The pulled pork sandwich was everyone's fave and the barbecue sauce has just the right amount of kick!"}
{"text":"In a nut shell, we were craving bbq,so we drove from Southern California just for this bbq... what's good you ask?! EVERYTHING!!! Hospitality,like there food is second to none."}
{"text":"They have been here for years and are the absolute best in Vegas. We lived a few blocks over and still get turkeys after moving far away.  :( They have everything you could want!"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying we've been doing the Triple D food tour of Vegas.   When the first 4 restaurants we tried blew our minds, we added days to our vacation to try a few more, including John Mull's.    So worth every bit of hype!!  Like many of the reviews state, this place is smack dab in the middle of a residential neighborhood.   Lots of rustic picnic tables, and a gravel/dirt drive way.  We happened to arrive right before the lunch rush - our service was prompt, our cashier was friendly and funny, and we got our food immediately after ordering.   I can see how this place might get super hectic/chaotic when busy - but it was well organized when we were there.    We ordered the 3 meat combo to share - and got the hot links, pulled pork, brisket and a double side of Mac.  All three meats were perfectly cooked, tender and flavorful.   The mac n cheese was super delicious, like homemade with melty cheese and awesome flavor.   Between the two of us, we had almost half of the food left when we tapped out.    This little gem is worth the drive outside of the city - for less than $20, we had an awesome, filling meal, and it definitely beat the flavor and quality of SoCal's (questionable...) favorite Phil's BBQ."}
{"text":"Best butcher i have found in Las Vegas! Friendly, fun and fantastic quality meats! While waiting the very short time for my custom order I was offered samples of the cooked BBQ behind me. Burnt ends are my favorite and they are out of this world at road kill cafe. One note if it's near a Holiday, don't wait get your meat a few days early. This is a very popular spot, and the line can run out the door through the parking lot and onto the street!"}
{"text":"I experienced bad service today. Came in for my usual rib dinners but unfortunately, they ran out. No problem, I ended up ordering 2 rib tip dinners and a brisket dinner.   1. The skinny black server was wearing shorts hanging halfway down his butt. Not very appetizing while dishing out food.   2. He took my order slip and after helping out the 2 ladies in front of me he then proceeded to fill the orders of 2 ladies that were behind me in line.   3. Then he had the nerve to tell me to move because I was holding up the line.   4. As the empty pans are being changed out, they are dripping pan condensation water all over the other food.    The food is still good but their employees need to be monitored because their attire, service and food handling need upgrading."}
{"text":"This establishment has definitely become an institution especially with Guy Fieri's feature on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives that everyone seems to keep talking about!!  Location is quite tricky being situated along a narrow street between housing neighborhoods as if you're going to someone's backyard barbecue.  Even for a person like me who has been here multiple times still gets lost trying to find this place.  The restaurant itself is outdoors which can be a huge downside with the blistering summer heat.  They've actually added more seating from my initial visit so there's plenty of room for everybody even with a fairly large group.  I usually go for the three meal combo which comes with two sides.  Rib tips, brisket, and sausage drenched in their BBQ sauce is the way to go!!  Meats are usually tender and perfectly seasoned.  As far as sides, their mac & cheese and baked beans are also quite tasty especially since they appear to be homemade and not your store bought kind.  Overall, John Mull's Road Kill Grill serves up one of the best barbecues in Las Vegas.  Too bad I live at the other side of the valley so I can't eat here as much as I'd like to."}
{"text":"The best BBQ in Las Vegas! Never will disappoint. Taste like a home cooked meal. The Mac & cheese is my favorite."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try The Road Kill Grill for a long time.  Finally thought about it today and stopped for lunch.  It definitely didn't disappoint! I got the links, brisket, pulled pork, Mac & Cheese and baked beans.  Some of the best bbq I've ever had! Definitely a must try place!"}
{"text":"I just didn't have the same experience that other people did.  I ordered the link, the brisket, and the ribs.  All three were dry.  I'm enclosing a picture.  I saw DDD and Guy holds up one of the links to the camera to show the juices coming out but mine was nothing like that.  Most reviews say the food is moist so I'm guessing that I got a bad batch.  A couple of less than average reviews say the meat was dry so maybe I was one of the unlucky ones.  One thing I noticed right off the bat was that the food is kept in warming bins, which was surprising.  When the server took off the lid to the links they just didn't look very appetizing.  I noticed from other reviews is that a lot of other people ordered items that had sauce in it, like the pulled pork or the cut links.  Maybe if you get 3 items that have no sauce there's nothing there to give it moisture.  The mac & cheese was good; I don't usually like since it never really lives up to the promise, but this serving did.  Very good overall.  The staff were friendly.  I arrived at 11:30 and avoided most of the rush.  I was the 2nd person in line when I ordered, but when I got outside the line was out the door.  I arrived earlier to try to get more \"fresh\" product but that's just not what I got."}
{"text":"The only reason I paid a visit is I saw them on Triple D. This is by far the best BBQ I have ever had from a restaurant. Service is more like standing in line for a lunch truck but you get to meet the people in line with you. The staff is friendly and offered water to customers while in line. Just the ladies that is lol. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Service: was excellent.  Samples were helpful and delicious.  They recommended how much to buy, which was perfect.   Food: We loved everything!  Greens were flavorful not bitter.  Yams were tender and sweet.  Cornbread was shaped like a pancake and moist.  Brisket, ribs and chicken were tasty, tender, and finger licking good. Meat would just fall off the bone.  Hot link wasn't too spicy but had enough kick for my taste.  Both the regular and spicy BBQ sauce were good.   Price: Very reasonable. 3 item combo with two sides, plus a side of hot links came to about $25 and could feed 3-4 people.   We missed the tri-tip, which is only served on Tuesday and Thursdays. Next time..."}
{"text":"Maybe it just me but personally I think this place may be overrated.  Saw it featured on TV about a week ago.  Decided to give it a try since I work around the area this weekend otherwise, it would be too far to drive from my house to go since I live in the Southwest area of town. Got to the place and there was a long line which we expected it.  After waiting about 20 plus mins someone came and took the order while we were waiting in line still.  Another 20 plus minutes went by before we finally got to the front. Don't know why people say it was a friendly service.  We didn't get that.  The girl that assisted us with our food was No Hello No Smile not friendly at all in my opinion.  Perhaps she's only friendly with the usual everyday customers that she knows.  She was talking to some guys behind us that she knew instead.   We ordered the 3 meat Combo with potato salad, green beans and another side of baked beans.  The sausage and brisket was ok but the Ribs was totally dried.  I mean, with line like that the food should be fresher and meat should be nice and juicy because of the constant replenishment they have to do.  Nope!  Ribs were dried like it has been there over night.  Overall, my favorites were the side dishes.  I like the green beans and baked beans better although,  not much of a bean person.  That's pretty funny!      Even though we didn't like the food quality the price was alright.     If you're around the area I guess you can give it a try.  Might get better quality of Ribs than we did.  Will not go back. 3 stars is what this place is.   Food not very impressive.  Definitely had better BBQ."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited this place after watching Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.....  As a native of Las Vegas, I cannot believe that I have missed this true hidden gem!   I have had lots of BBQ from Texas to Memphis and hands down this is the best BBQ in Las Vegas....I'd honestly compare this to true Memphis BBQ (Not the Memphis Championship BBQ here in town - which is crap), if they competed in Memphis in May, they would give some of the other BBQ guys a run for their money - including some of the restaurants like the BBQ shop and The Commissary !!   The meat is well prepared and has a true smoke flavor and the portion sizes are generous. The BBQ sauce has a bold flavor and the sides are just to die for!  Myself, I had the 5 rib platter with two sides - the ribs were so tender that they easily fell off the bone! I did double baked beans for my sides and were just off the hook! The flavor had a kick to it - not too hot nor spicy.   My wife had the rib/pulled pork combo. I ended up trying her pulled pork and it was just right! Not too tuff nor chewy - it honestly melted in your mouth! She did the baked beans as well as potato salad along with the Apple Cobbler....needless to say it was also as good as everything else!  I am not 100% sure where the one recent reviewer who rated this placed two stars is from but I have to strongly disagree with her review. I have spent time in Texas, Georgia, Florida, North Carolina and Tennessee...with my wife being from Memphis, we are also frequently visiting some of the BBQ joints.   As for the meat market - I will review it later, we did pick up some ground beef to make burgers.   I am looking forward to visiting this place again soon!"}
{"text":"Beautiful Saturday and Beautiful people. The line was worth the wait as always. The owner John brought the guys round back to check out the smokers and the grill. We ordered some of everything pulled pork, brisket, ribs, rib tips and burnt ends. The greens and Mack n Chee's was epic. The cornbread is like cornbread and cake had a baby. Best BBQ in Vegas."}
{"text":"Amazing food.  Everybody is so friendly,  the meat is so juicy and flavorful. I keep going there every weekend.   OMG THE costumer appreciation day was off the hook!"}
{"text":"Best food ever! We had our wedding catered by John Mull's because the food is so delicious! We had brisket, pulled pork, baked beans, Mac n cheese, rolls, Mac salad, potato salad and spicy hot links. We got so many compliments!! Everyone went back for seconds and wanted to know where we got the food. Best kept secret in town! We served 125 people (many had 2 or 3 plates of food!) for just under $1,000 which is a steal! We have leftovers too! If you have an event coming up, do yourself a favor and get the food from John Mulls, they'll deliver your catering order for $25. We are customers for life! My husband has them process his meat after hunting and has always been happy with it. Oh, they sell eggs too!!!"}
{"text":"Never had the bbq. I go here for the butcher block. Their catfish is awesome. Hot links unmatched, and all  the other meat I buy from here is great quality. Tastes great once I pull it off the grill. I can say I have purchase their baked beans... All I can say is OMG! Get there already."}
{"text":"Everyone and I mean everyone talks about this place as the must try! I love all types of food but there's a special place in my stomach for BBQ. After living in Vegas for 18 months I finally found an opportunity to give it a try!   I went with the 2 meat combo with brisket and hot link, collard greens, yams and cornbread. And because fellow Yelpers said I had to, I also got the peach cobbler.   A few things that kept it from being 4 or 5 stars for me:  1) Portion size- I have a pretty major appetite so it's kinda hard to fill me. But I still felt like the little scoop of each side, and the amount of meat was subpar. A friend who was with me told me the serving plates they're using now are new and that they're filling these up but the old larger plates they used had them delivering bigger portions.   2) Spill Over- I only carried my platter outside to a table. It's not like I transported it home. The juices from the collard greens was all over my brisket, hotlink, and yams. I don't like my food to touch, as it is. So this was a killer for me.   Good things: cornbread was really good, sauces (I tried both hot and mild) were very good, peach cobbler (also very small portion but it was only $3 so little was expected of the size)   Don't get me wrong, very tasty. But for me it did not live up to the overwhelming hype. After having tried, I can now say that this is not my favorite BBQ place in the valley. But I still recommend you give it a shot to judge for yourself.   If you want to know the best BBQ place in the valley, message me"}
{"text":"Great bbq place. Even better pricing. I went twice during my short stay with about 8 people both times. Can't say any of us tried anything we didn't like."}
{"text":"I had heard of this place for years and been told it was the best bbq in town but I have been disappointed since I moved west of the Mississippi in terms of bbq so I always just ignored the recommendation. Luckily John Mull's was one of the vendors at the Spartan race and I got a chance to meet the owner and try some bbq. When I was complimenting him, he gave me four free dinners to come up and try it out. I can say 1000% I will be MORE than happy to come back on a regular basis and even pay.  A friend of mine and I went last night and I also ordered two extra dinners to bring to my parents' house for lunch today. This gave me an opportunity to try the pulled pork, ribs, chicken, greens beans, coleslaw, baked beans, and yams. I can 100% attest that EVERYTHING was amazing! Even reheated the meat retained much of it's moisture and the flavors are spot on. This place goes on my list as not only the best bbq that I've had in Las Vegas but the best I've had west of the Mississippi. Chuck (owner) definitely knows what he is doing.  I loved the outside venue and since it was such a nice day, it was nice to be outside. We brought beers with us and were able to enjoy them while we waited in line and chatted with the folks around us. There are tons of picnic tables where you can sit and eat or you can take it with you.  The only thing I think some people might see as a negative is that it's in North Las Vegas but I would tell anyone that it's worth the drive. Honestly it's not really that far out. For anyone looking for amazing food from a great guy, I'd recommend this place any day"}
{"text":"This is where i wish i could do half scores. This is a solid 3.5. Not quite a four but better than 3.   My wife and i split the 3 meat meal. This is pretty common for us at bbq places and we both left relatively satisfied. We got the tritip, brisket, and ribs. I think the ribs were a hair dry but i attribute that to being the end of the day (30 mins before close). The rest of the meat was great though i am a fan of thicker cuts of meat.   For the sides we got the mac and cheese and the baked beans. The mac and cheese was amazing!! Perfect richness and flavor. Typically i am not a fan of baked beans, but these were a hybrid between baked beans and  chili and i loved them. The one weird note would be the corn bread... It wasn't bad but was definitely too sweet. Tasted more like cake than corn bread. My other note would be the hot bbq sauce, it just wasnt hot at all. It was still good just not perfect.   Overall pretty great bbq. Not the best but far from the worst. I would go again if i were in town. Price was solid for the amount of food and the taste was pretty solid."}
{"text":"After seeing this place on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives, I decided to give it a try.  Guy F. was raving about the place.   Ask any BBQ pro about boiling ribs and they will look at you like you just stole their elderly mother's life savings.  John Mull's boils their ribs before finishing on the grill but Guy stated \"this is competition meat\".  So I make the trip there, really strange looking neighborhood and place.  Tiny on the inside, luckily it was not crowded.  I ordered a 2 meat combo.  Ribs and links, I told the young man preparing my plate that I wanted my sauce on the side, he said they don't put sauce on the meat, sauce is over on the counter.  Good sign.   I looked around as he was preparing my plate then went over to put some sauce in the little containers.   All set, got my food and headed out the door.  Not really any place to eat there except for some picnic benches outside but it was far too hot to be outside so I decided to head to the nearest covered lot and eat in my car.    Finally got to a hotel parking structure and was ready to feast!  Opened my tray and found that this idiot kid covered my ribs with the links that were swimming in sauce!!!!  I literally wanted to scream!  I told the idiot I didn't want sauce on my ribs yet he proceeded to put the cut links and sauce on top of my ribs.  Anyway, started on the ribs and they were not very good at all, tender but no flavor at  and the sauce sucked!   The links tasted like hot dogs.   Overall not good Q.  Thanks Guy!!!   I was at another restaurant and the owner claimed that Triple D requests a fee for them to visit your restaurant.   I believe that.  Have you ever seen Guy say \"that place was just OK'??"}
{"text":"Food was good, I had the ribs, brisket, hot links, beans and Mac salad.  The ribs were outstanding very well seasoned and tender.  I would have given 5 stars if they would have given me white bread with my meal.  How am I supposed to eat links and brisket without white bread? Instead they gave me corn bread, what am I supposed to do with that, didn't make sense.  Anyway, I would definitely recommend this place just pick up some white bread on your way!"}
{"text":"We came here because it was recommended by my husband's co worker. My husband is a HUGE bbq fan while me, not so much. As we pull up we were a bit confused because it was kind of in a residential area but once we saw the sign we knew we were in the right place. I knew it was going to be good because \"hole in the wall\" restaurants usually are. And of course I was right! The staff was very friendly and the food was MORE than enough so be prepared to take some home or come VERY hungry. I suggest trying the brisket and Mac n cheese. Seating is outside so make sure to bring or buy water because it can get hot here in Vegas."}
{"text":"I grew up down south, and BBQ is a way of life to us. I consider myself to be a pretty good BBQ chef and connoisseur. I grew up Qin' weekly, and have cooked almost everything you can cook on the grill. Due to my profession I travel frequently, and have eaten BBQ in Memphis, Texas, Georgia, St. Louis, Louisiana, California, South Carolina, and the list goes on and on. I was a bit skeptical, and apprehensive I must admit, when I went to road kill grill for the first time. Due to the fact that I had tried every other BBQ joint in Vegas, and had been disappointed so far. It was a bit cramped coming in the door because everything is cafeteria style and you stand in a single file line to order, but it moves rather quickly. While you stand there and wait they do give you free samples of the meats which is very nice, and it also helps you decide what to order. Everything is hot and fresh, and always available. I've tried everything on the menu, and have never been disappointed. The portions are huge! I always bring home leftovers. The BBQ sauce is exquisite with the perfect amount of spice. The price is good for what you get. The only thing I would change about the place is the ordering system. The food is hands down the best BBQ available in Las Vegas! I would recommend this joint to anybody who wants awesome BBQ!"}
{"text":"Thank you Diners, drive-ins and dives! Would have never heard of the place otherwise.   Potato salad and baked beans are outstanding... hear me loud and clear- they are OUT-FRIGGIN-STANDING!!"}
{"text":"Very generous portions, decent prices, and most importantly great barbeque!  Yes, the lines are long. We got there a bit after 4pm on Saturday and there were probably more than 40 people in front of us. We actually got out of there within 40 mins, so actually not that bad, considering each order would take about 1-2 minutes each. Now the reason the lines are long... the guys here are friendly and talkative. A bit too much so. It keeps the lines moving slowly as opposed to fast service but no interaction. So what would you prefer? The guys offer kids free cornbread samples, gave lots of us free cold bottled water since it was hot, and even offered people towards the back of the line a whole rib each!  We ordered the three meat combo for $16.65 that comes with two sides and cornbread; brisket, rib tips and ribs were our choices, and sides of baked beans and mac and cheese. The servings are big! More than enough to share with another person. A two meat combo is $2 less so why not get the three meat. We got five slices of brisket, 3 large ribs and a heaping mound of rip tips.  The ribs were boxed separately bc it would not all fit in one. The brisket is sliced thin and kept in its juices. It's cooked well done but still so tender. The ribs and rib tips were very meaty and juicy. The rib tips even had this nice crunch on the outside but yet still tender inside. They offer two bbq sauces, and they have piles of the mild ready to go, but you have to request the spicy. And they let you take as many as you need. None of that charging extra bullshit.  As for the sides, I didn't think the mac and cheese was really all that. I'm very picky about my mac and cheese and don't like the noodles too soft. They were too soft for my liking. But there was plenty of cheese, too much even. The baked beans bf felt too sweet but I thought it was alright, but just barely. A pinch more sugar and it would have been a dessert for me. There were chunks of bacon and ground beef in there too. I loved the corn bread. I didn't find it too sweet at all, but would have liked a bit more crunch with more corn meal.  The star here really is the meats. We even got another side of mac bc everyone raved about it, and at $3 for a 6oz container, it's overpriced. I really feel they make their money back on the sides and not the meat bc bbq takes to much time and energy to make and they just don't really charge that much for how much they give you. The guy packing our order got a big pile of brisket for us, and decided to put some back. Then ended up getting more anyway and putting it in the box! The sides on the other hand, very cheap to make and high margins.  Make sure to ask them for a frequent diner card. After the 10th one, the 11th is on them. Apparently not many people know about this. The people behind us were long time customers and didn't know about it. When asked when they started doing it, he replied \"A long time ago!\""}
{"text":"This place is so amazing. Best BBQ and friendly service. Fun out door seating when it's not so hot."}
{"text":"Today I went to the Road Kill Grill and I was shocked at no paved parking lot and no disabled parking not good. I was forced to wait in line for almost an hour to get my food, and what upset me was beer was free but not the Soda's and at a $1.00 per can that is out ragous stupid especilly for the Designated Driver's. The food after waiting in line for almost one hour was lukewarm and nothing to howel about. The seating left mutch to be desired as the table was located in the gravel and in the sun this is not good for someone who has mobility issues. If the place wishes to be called a resaraunt locate it in an Air Condishiond building with comfortable seats and servers who take your order and serve it on a real plate not in a styrafoam box and plastic utensils and most important of all Disabled parking. If you want BBQ food find a Famous Dave's they have all of the accomodations that Road Kill Grill doesn't."}
{"text":"Besides having a great pulled-pork BBQ, they had the most magnificent bone for my VERY LARGE DOG.  They were so kind to cut it into 5 pieces and he is thoroughly enjoying 1/5 at a time.  So, if you get the opportunity to visit t his delicious grill, do NOT forget the friend\" you may have home!"}
{"text":"Really awesome!!! Had the three meat choice to try everything. The tri tip was tender with lots of flavor. Pork rib soft with awesome smoke flavor and the brisket great flavor. The sides baked bean and collard greens made it well rounded wonderful meal. From Hawaii the portions awesomely alright!!! Going to be a regular visit for us"}
{"text":"So I went to John Mull's meats and road kill about a month ago.  I had the ribs, brisket and sausage.  The food was very good but it did not react well that night with my stomach. Probably not their fault so I did want to give them another try.  I was waiting in line for over an hour which I was fine with.  When I was about to order they said they were out of ribs.  While I was standing in line for the hour they could of informed us they were running low or out of ribs.  The first sign of them telling us they were running low on ribs was about an hour of me waiting in line and I was next to order.  This was very unprofessional.  So note to everyone , if you go about an hour and a half before they close your probably going to have to wait in line and not get ribs and not be informed about it. They seem like they are a well run restaurant because they are expanding, however they should be able to predict the amount of food they can provide to paying customers."}
{"text":"Outside of the strip, but not too far. The food was sooo good, especially the pulled pork! The green beans and macaroni were to die for. We got 4 of the 2 meat plates for four people and we had sooo much food leftover. When in Vegas this is a place to visit! The whole eating outside in picnic style tables was nice, since it was such a beautiful day! Everyone was super friendly :-)"}
{"text":"Probably one of my top 5 \"Best BBQ\" restaurants ever! If ever in the Vegas area make it a point to visit John Mulls Road kill grill which is maybe 15 minute drive from the strip? They're very generous with the portion size! Go now!"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of visiting the John Mull's BBQ campus last week!   I loved the layout of the place and even though I had to wait a while for my white meat chicken, the service there was excellent!  Actually, the service was more like hospitality as the employees made me feel at home as I waiting on my order.  To top things off, the food was delicious!  I look forward to visiting the next time I'm in the Vegas area."}
{"text":"Yuck, the line is long, the people who box the orders are slow as molasses, the cold items like potato salad and drinks were warm, the orders were all wrong and items left out, all the food slopped in the boxes....not much shade to sit and biting flies everywhere......... The boxes where such a mess I didn't even want to take them home in my truck....."}
{"text":"#1BBQ IN TOWN I have lived in North Las Vegas for 18 yrs. and just drove by this place yesterday--smelled wonderful.  We went and ordered 2 3 meat combos with pulled pork, tri tip, ribs, sausage and chicken breast.  The sides collared greens, pork-n-beans, potato salad and Cole slaw.   The food is EXCELLENT.  I will be back.   #1 BBQ IN TOWN"}
{"text":"John Mulls.. Our families favorite spot for over 10 years since we first started getting our smoked duck. You feel like family as soon as you park. You can't touch the service and quality of products. A must go. Why 4 stars? The last three times out BBQ and sides were not hot but warm/cool 2 minutes after handed over to me. Slowly getting worse.. John you got this!"}
{"text":"Long wait times, ordered ribeyes...  tasted a lot like New York's.  Not impressed... not for the price."}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ!! So fresh, moist, delicious and great prices. We got links, ribs, brisket and trip tip, Mac n cheese, such delicious corn bread, green beans and really tasty macaroni salad! Everyone was very nice and even gave us sample rib tips! MUST try."}
{"text":"Friday afternoon I purchased two slabs of back ribs at $2.29 per pound.  We decided to smoke ribs on Sunday and when I unwrapped the two slabs of ribs I discovered two slabs trimmed of most of the meat.  Not wanting to serve these ribs to guests, I went to Smiths and purchased two additional slabs for $1.99 per pound.  I cooked all four slabs and found that not only were the John Mull slabs excessively trimmed, but the meat was extremely tough and seemed like commercial or utility grade beef rather than any consumer grade.  After ten years of periodic patronage (mainly because they are about a mile from my house) I will drive a bit further and go to Larry's.  Their staff has always been friendly and I cannot rate their new hot foods as I have not tried any."}
{"text":"Every time I come to this place it's always so gooood!!!  A great barbecue fix, just like a family event. The people are always friendly, and sometimes the line can be outside the door, but it's well worth it!"}
{"text":"Today, this place was featured on diners dives and drive ins. It almost looks like I'm driving up to a ranch with dirt parking and ranch like structures. Then, on memorial weekend, there's a 25 minute line. Totally expected. The line is shaded and there's seating there with various memorabilia along the path that gives something to look at If you don't have anyone to talk to. Thought it might be worth mentioning. The wait goes pretty fast because everyone is excited and it's a nice relaxed atmosphere.   I ordered the rib tip dinner. It came with two sides. They were out of chili. Bummer. I got the baked beans and macaroni salad. Both were excellent. So, you might be wondering about the rib tips. I will let you try for yourself. They did provide spicy and regular sauce. It was useful. The spicy could've been a tad bit spicier but was still very tasty and complimented the meat perfectly.   Would be perfect for a picnic or just chilling at a jazz concert in the park."}
{"text":"This place was awesome and gives plenty of food. I went there for lunch and now eating more for dinner now."}
{"text":"One of the better BBQ places in Vegas, however, its small space doubles as a butcher and a restaurant. They smoke the meats outside and then bring them inside to the serving area. They have quite a selection of meats and sides, although the pricing is a little steep for a hole in the wall joint. The food is good though, especially the ribs, green beans and mac & cheese, which are my favorites here. If you come during the lunch rush, be prepared to wait in a line so be sure to arrive early if you're in a hurry! If you choose to dine in, there's an outdoor patio area next to the parking lot where you can sit down and eat. I come by here every once in a while when I'm craving BBQ. You can also order raw meat from the butcher or bring in your next fresh kill to be butchered by the pros"}
{"text":"who knew there was a bbq place in town that wasnt a famous daves or lucilles style restaurant. this reminds me of of the rudys i went to in colorado springs.  its a meat shop thats been around for a few generations that has a bbq part in the meat shop.  theres not indoor dining area, you get your food and walk outside to an eating area. its neat i like it. cold in the winter and probably hot in the summer but i like that its not a typical set up.  i got the 2 meat combo.  pulled pork - very nice seasoning and moist brisket - sliced a little thin but had good fat and moistness to it slaw - not super sweet but just enough baked beans - surprisingly really really good. not think or too sweet. nice chunks of pork. spicy bbq - i like it  i couldnt finish half of it. the portions were really good."}
{"text":"This placed appeared on Diners, Drive-Ins, & Dives, so we wanted to try it. It was definitely worth it! Great tasting BBQ and very good prices as well! We had brisket, pulled pork, & ribs, along with sides of collard greens, green beans, Mac-n-cheese, & baked beans. My wife also had the peach cobbler. Everything we tried was excellent! The portions are large. The service was great & the staff very friendly! The only drawback is sitting outside when the temp is 111 ! They have misters buy still very hot. It's in a neighborhood, but google maps was precise in getting us there."}
{"text":"So amazing! Love the way this place is set up. The food is so good and we are extremely lucky to have this place in Las Vegas! Brisket and pulled chicken with that spicy BBQ sauce... I could eat it every day!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food!!! Always love going here for a quick lunch when the weather is nice or for take out"}
{"text":"Best BBQ ever!  I, like everyone else, discovered this hidden gem on Food Network. The next day I was there, and it has since become a favorite.   If you're going on Saturday, wear comfortable shoes. I have waited as long as an hour and a half. During the week, you should be in and out pretty quickly. The portions are insane! I am an eater, and a three meat combo lasts me about 3-4 meals.  Meats:  Brisket: I don't like brisket. I order brisket from Kill Grill every time. It's tender, juicy.. simply divine. A must.  Tri Tip: Better than the brisket. The only con is that they only have it twice a week. If they have it, get it.  Pulled Chicken: Pass on this one. I don't know what it is, but it just isn't good.  Pulled Pork: It's good, but not my favorite. Don't get me wrong - compared to other places it's awesome, but they have better options in my opinion.  Sausage: A favorite. I usually get them cut up and drenched in sauce. They're a little bit spicy, but they're packed with flavor.  Ribs: Great flavor and extremely tender and juicy. You literally won't want sauce.  Sides:  I won't go into great detail, but I have tried the beans, macaroni salad and mac and cheese. They are all pretty tasty, but the mac and cheese is probably the best thing I've ever put in my mouth. It's a must!  Cobbler:  I've tried all three flavors - the cherry is really sweet. I prefer the apple.  For the amount of food you get, the prices are extremely reasonable. When they're really busy the service can sometimes be lacking, but they try. They usually will pass out free water if you've been standing for awhile. This is definitely one of my favorite places to dine in Vegas. Go now."}
{"text":"First the good.   -The service was quick and friendly enough. -The menu is simple and has a fair variety of choices. -The brisket had a good flavor to it, despite its shortcomings (more on that in the bad) -The ribs were well cooked. -Good snap to the hot link. -A lot of food for the money.  Now, the bad.  -The pulled pork was DROWNED in sauce.  I mean, an unbelievable amount of sauce.  Great BBQ should let you taste the meat...even sauce based BBQs don't put that much sauce.  Also, the sauce was not that good. -The hot link was also drowned in sauce.  See above. -I did not care for the ribs.  I found their flavor to be lacking.  They were, as I said, well cooked, but the flavor was mediocre. -The brisket is sitting in a steaming vat of au jus, which overcooks it.  When they served it to me, it was solid gray, and super hot from the sitting the juice.  The taste of the meat was better than expected, but the meat itself was way overcooked. -The sandwiches are served with the super hot meats straight from their steam trays, and then packed into a Styrofoam container, which turns it into a bread based sauna.  By the time I walked out to the benches to eat it, the bread was a soggy mush. -The peach cobbler was WAY too heavy on the nutmeg.  I shared some with my two friends without saying anything and both said \"too much nutmeg.\" -Canned soda.  Seriously?  How about a soda fountain.  On the PLUS side, the cans were only $1 which is not too bad for a can in a restaurant.  However, I still hate getting a can in a restaurant.  Overall, the food was decent to mediocre.  Prices were very good, but I would rather pay more for food that makes me want to overindulge to finish every last bite, not throw away half of what is left because I don't feel like it would be worth the calories."}
{"text":"I cannot even begin to fathom all the great ratings this place has!  I'm a fan of BBQ and have had great BBQ from all the great BBQ places in the states.  Memphis, Texas, the Carolina's.  Made a special trip to this place while in Vegas because of all the great reviews and the spot on Triple D.  Guy wouldn't steer me wrong, would he?  Arrive at about 1:30 on a Monday to a crazy long line.  The smell was intoxicating and I don't mind waiting for great Q.  Was told it would be about 30 min, so ok into the line I went.  Could not figure out for the life of me why the line moved so dang slow, but about every 15 min it moved a few feet.  30 min go by and we are not even close to the magic door where they let 5 people at a time in to order.  I'm intrigued by the set up, I must see what's going on inside that door that could possibly make this go so slow!  30 min turns into an hour, turns into 90 min, turns into 2 hours.  I thought about leaving several times, but I was hungry, and the smell, and those reviews kept me in line!  Finally get inside the mystery door to reveal another line of about 10 people still waiting to place their order!  Are you kidding me?  Seriously the most inefficient set up I've every seen.  While all the employees are very friendly and make small talk with each and every customer, I really would prefer a quicker experience.  One guy in charge of the meats and sides.  another guy desserts and ringing you up.  That's it--2 people working the line.  Had there been 1 guy doing meat, 1 guy doing sides, 1 doing desserts, & 1 ringing people up the wait would have been reduced significantly.  Guess what?  Serve more customers, make more money?  Serve more customers who don't wait 2.5 hours for mediocre food, you get return customers which means even more profit.  I guess this place just doesn't care about that sort of stuff.  On to the food.  We order a 3 meat combo--brisket, pulled pork and rib tips.  Sides of Mac & cheese, potato and mac salad and baked beans.  got all 3 cobblers to try.  Rib tips were dry and chewy and could barely get them down.  Pulled pork was ok, but I prefer to sauce my own stuff.  If I don't like your sauce, then I want it without.  The brisket was presliced and sitting in brisket juice?  It had a unappealing brown texture and pieces that we got in our order had been sliced with the grain.  A big no no when slicing any kind of meat like that.  The taste wasn't bad, I just prefer my brisket freshly sliced from the whole brisket not presliced.  The smoke flavor seemed like it was not from the wood, but from a liquid smoke.  Sides were just ok.  Mac & cheese was my favorite but we got the last of a pan of it and it had been sitting for a while.  Potato & mac salad don't taste freshly made.  Cobblers are made with big cans of pie filling.  How hard is it to slice fresh apples for a better product?  All in all disappointed, threw most of it in the garbage.  Can't recommend and won't return.  I'm mad at you Guy Fieri!"}
{"text":"Who knew BBQ would be so so delicious!  Portion sizes were very generous. The baked beans were full of flavor. The macaroni and cheese was good and cheesy. The collard greens were ok. Not as much flavor as the other sides. We ordered the 2 meat combo and the 3 meat combo. Oh my my my. The ribs fell off the bone and had a deep smoky flavor. The brisket was flavored full and not dry. The pulled pork with the BBQ sauce was a perfect duo and the hit links were super tasty. I will be back for more."}
{"text":"Quite a bit of hype but only sub average overall. Very friendly and courteous service but we came for the BBQ. Ribs were tender and lightly seasoned with rub but had no smoke flavor. Rib tips were seemingly also grilled rather than smoked and had quite a bit of chew. Brisket was moist but non descript. We wanted to like this place but probably won't be back.  Guy Fieri is just baloney, he says everything is 'out of bounds'."}
{"text":"The food here is SOOOOOOOO GOOD but the customer service and communication is TERRIBLE. Excuse me not terrible because the 2 guys working the register and taking orders was amazing. So my order was taken and everything was fine then I got to the grille and was greeted with a hand out (no verbal greeting or smile) then asked to step around to receive my food. So automatically my mood switched because I would never allow my employees to act in such a way I coach those behaviors as soon as I see them. Then on top of that the lady got the order wrong stating she thought it said something that it wasn't. I'm not sure what the issue is but I've been here SO MANY TIMES and the customer service is always welcoming and that is how John is ALWAYS. I don't know but customer service is huge for me especially in this heat but the food is amazing as usual."}
{"text":"So good. Green beans and mac and cheese so awesome. My husband and I both love coming here."}
{"text":"After several trips to Vegas my wife and kids are sick of the usual hotel... Strip food. What a great experience this was, food was fantastic ambience was great. Staff was super helpful in explaining their dishes.  One quick word of advice, as soon as you sit down asked for extra napkins.  Lip smacking"}
{"text":"Went in for dinner and had an excellent meal.  Great atmosphere,  great service and great good.  This is a must goto place.  I will be visiting this restaurant frequently."}
{"text":"I have been eager to get here.  This place was busy, I'm talking more then 15 people in line today.  The girl took our orders, and the line moved really fast.  Food was really good!"}
{"text":"So far best BBQ in town! We had the brisket,ribs and sausage. It's definitely good! Reminds me of when we had bbq in Texas. Peach cobbler was also amazing! We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Not too bad.   I had Rib Tips, Ribs, sliced Brisket & Links. Mac & Cheese Potato Salad & Beans   The best part was the Ribs & Beans.  I got a lot if food for the price.  The staff was real courteous"}
{"text":"I'm in Texas frequently, so a bit spoiled when it comes to BBQ, but Road Kill Grill did a bang-up job with their brisket. Tender, not dried out, just wish a little more smoky flavored. Generous helping. Mac and cheese was ok, but will probably go with a different side next time. And looking forward to trying some other meat(s)."}
{"text":"I tried this out yesterday and man the flavor is great! I had the tri tip with cornbread, green beans and yams. The trip tip has a unique flavor with a bit of a tangy-ness to it and the yams were so good and felt like it was melting your mouth. It was President's day and this place does a great thing for their guests by putting a separate grill on for free hot dogs, burgers and fries for anyone who wants something to eat. next time I go I want to try the pulled pork."}
{"text":"Out of the way but great food, and, John Mull's is a HUGE supporter of our American Legion Riders Post 149 veteran assistance fundraiser events so vets get out there and support Kill Grill when possible. And, I've gone there long before joining the post and would say the same thing about the food!!"}
{"text":"I loved it i eat a lot usually but the portion there are very hudge that i had to take it to go and that was so delicious the staff very good and organized!if i did nkt have Yelp i will not know about this place because its kind of hidded!!i definetly gonna go back to that place with my friends who loves meat like me to show them!!"}
{"text":"This has definitely been on my Vegas Eats bucketlist for quite some time. The reviews have always been great, but it's a long ways from my Henderson digs, so I hadn't had a chance to test out some Road Kill Grill. Good grief was it worth the wait.   Rather than enjoy the best BBQ in Vegas alone I decided to bring an entourage. It was just before the Christmas holiday so I grabbed all of my closest co-workers to enjoy a fun holiday lunch with one another. I'm pretty sure between the entire group of 6 we ordered the entire menu. Personally, I went with a 3 meat combo that included ribs, chicken, and pulled pork. For my sides I went with a double load of mac n' cheese. That was an excellent choice as their M&C was off the hook. The ribs had fantastic flavor. I do like them to fall off the bone a little more, but they weren't tough at all. The pulled pork was the best I've ever had and they give you a mountain sized portion. The chicken was my least favorite as it had a little bit of a gassy flavor. I think it might have been a bit of smoke overload, though it was incredibly tender. Next time I would probably drop the chicken and go with the brisket or a hot link since those looked so good. The icing on the cake was the corn bread you got with it. Sweet and the perfect complement to a great meal. The 3 meat combo was literally enough food to feed 3 people, so be advised that you will likely have leftovers if you go this route.  The seating area is very informal. Picnic style which is great for a large group. Only warning I would give is that it's all outdoor seating, so weather could be a factor. They do have heaters that keep it relatively warm on a cold day.   I'm definitely looking forward to my next visit to John Mull's Meats & Road Kill Grill. Next time I'm definitely planning on visiting the butcher shop to load up my freezer. Great stuff!"}
{"text":"There are only a couple of butchers worth going to in Vegas...John Mull's Meats is one of them.  Their customer service is incredible...even at hectic holiday times!  Great quality meats!  Together that's everything I'm looking for!"}
{"text":"Can not believe how amazing my experience with this meat market was today. I got there and walked in and was instantly greeted and asked what I wanted. My order was placed and I am just looking around when they bring out my slab of meat. I got 2 really fine looking 1 1/2\" beef rib-eye steaks and 1 pound of bacon. All the while the meat master behind the counter was talking to me and we had a few laughs.  So unfortunately I have never been good a grilling steaks. My father-in-law has ALWAYS been the master. Now I have award winning ribs,and pulled pork but the steak has always eluded me. Well today with a little salt and pepper on the steaks I placed them on the grill and hoped for the best. After 7 minutes on each side I pulled them and put them on the table. My son said over and over again how good it was. Even said they were better than Grandpas steaks. In my opinion? Yeah, they were fabulous. was it my grilling prowess? Maybe, but I am more apt to give the credit to John Mull's Meats and the amazingly fresh and better than any supermarket steaks.  Will I ever go back? YES! Because they have a full selection of hog,beef,and goat that they do,and I am hungry for more!!"}
{"text":"The tri tip is only on Tues and Thurs which is my favorite, I love the ribs and rib tips too, along with the best Mac n cheese I've ever had."}
{"text":"Probably the best bbq place i had so far.  It is located in a neighborhood and the service is fast and friendly.   I really enjoyed the q here and will be back again definitely."}
{"text":"Best bbq we have ever had.  Always make it a point to stop when we're in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"My husband and I moved to vegas almost two years ago and he wanted to stock up our freezer. We chose John mulls meats as our butcher because the prices were very fair. Not sure how much we paid but it was a good price for half a cow's worth of meat. These guys are great, the food (at road kill grill) is phenomenal and the day we came in to pick it up we had to wait awhile since there were so many customers there and they still found a way to make it up to us for the long wait. I love this place and I will come again. The wait was worth it. Be aware that there are many ppl here to pickup catering orders around the holidays and especially at lunchtime. I've been here three times and there is always a long line of ppl at the road kill grill."}
{"text":"Best bbq place hands down. The long line at times may seem intimidating but people are waiting there for a reason."}
{"text":"Absolutely outstanding taste!  First tried this at an event a friend hosted they ordered $200 worth of food the portions were perfect Everyone got to take food home and still had left overs!! I will be placing an order soon!"}
{"text":"This is the best BBQ you will have in Las Vegas. A bit of a drive off the strip, but it's definitely worth your time.   There is nothing fancy here. For meat lovers only."}
{"text":"The Road Kill Grill combines two things that I love ...  Dives and BBQ.  The RKG pulls off divey without the \"I'm scared I'm going to get shot\" divey feel we don't like.  The brisket and pulled pork are tender and smoked perfectly.  The ribs fall of the bone and are full of juicy meat.  The meats are served dry with sauce on the side so you can control how much sauce you want on it.  It's like  a \"we trust you with the sauce\" approach, which is nice.  All in all, very solid food and a fun place to eat."}
{"text":"The environment was unreal so amazing everyone was so friendly it felt like I was around family. The food was just as good if not better. The meat was so tender and the flavor was perfect. The ribs were so good!"}
{"text":"Delicious food!! I wish I lived closer so I could eat it all the time!! I haven't had BBQ so good since I lived in the south! I live that they have a small shop at the shooting complex as well!!"}
{"text":"I've been craving good BBQ for weeks, and have been meaning to come here for months. You order outside, you eat outside (or take it home.) It's down home, on-a-ranch style atmosphere. There was a line, but I probably didn't wait more than 20 minutes. This is around 2:30pm, mind you. I've seen that wait times can be upwards of an hour around lunch. Don't wait until you're starving to go.  I ordered the 2 combo meal with pulled pork and brisket, green beans, and mac and cheese + cornbread. First, get the cornbread. Always get the cornbread. Hands down, best cornbread I've ever had. It tastes like a cakey Nilla wafer. It's basically a small corn cake. Delicious.  The mac and cheese used bigger noodles than your standard Kraft fare. I'm not sure about the cheese. I think it's just personal preference, but the cheese flavor doesn't really do it for me. The green beans looked like they're cooked with ham pieces, and they're smokey.  Now, the meat: the brisket is super tender and the fat melts in your mouth. The pulled pork is also super tender and has been marinaded in the one of the best barbecue sauces I've tried. It could be a bit bolder tasting, but again, personal preference. I'll be back for the chicken and the hot links (which seems the be one of the most popular items.)  It's worth the wait, regardless of time. I barely got halfway through and I was already full, but my mouth continued to water. This is definitely a new favorite."}
{"text":"If you have not tried this place your missing out !! Everything on their menu is DELICIOUS. I have been coming here for years and even had catering done for a few events. The Mac n cheese and brisket is my go to, but like I've said I've pretty much had the entire menu . It's always crowded especially around lunch time on the weekdays and the weekends just remain busy. The staff is ALWAYS very friendly you feel welcoming everyone greets you. I like the fact that over the years I pretty much see the same staff working their, some new faces which is normal in a work place. You definitely have to try this place don't bother with famous Dave's or Lucille's this place is better !!"}
{"text":"Being from the Midwest and whose family built their own smokers and smoked their own meat, I am pretty picky about my BBQ.  Had the pulled pork and the brisket and they both were incredible.  The side dishes were mac n cheese and baked beans and they both were great as well.  The bbq sauce was good but the meat was so moist and juicy that you didn't need any sauce.  I only wish they served beer, but besides that I have no complaints.  Thought Lucille's was decent bbq but this place kills Lucille's.  Definitely plan on going back and taking friends."}
{"text":"Between five of us we ordered everything except the pulled pork...and I must say it was off the charts good...tenderest brisket I have ever had.  Even the kids LOVED the green beans and ribs. We tried a little off of everyone's played and found nothing that was short of fantastic...the staff was attentive and really nice to all of us"}
{"text":"What can be said about this place that hasn't been said already. It is by far the best place to get BBQ in Las Vegas. Everything is phenomenal. I highly suggest the brisket and ribs but you won't be disappointed with anything you get. As far as sides go you can never go wrong with the Mac N Cheese or beans, but again everything is good. This is one of my favorite spots to eat."}
{"text":"I had the 2 meat plate . Ribs, hot link and mac and cheese, greens and corn bread. Everything was so good. Even got a peach cobbler. It was worth the 45 minute wait. I couldn't leave the parking lot with out tasting something. Must try!! And everybody is so friendly."}
{"text":"Nothing like Good ol' BBQ. We tried hot links, pulled pork and beef brisket. All were delicious and succulent. I am Usually not a pulled pork fan but this was too good to pass. They also have beef ribs which I love. Their ribs were already off the bone and able to eat it with a fork. Hands clean and delicious! Service is very friendly and pleasant."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm making a special recipe, I come here for the meat. LOVE the short ribs! Call ahead and order for pick-up so you don't have to wait. It gets pretty busy in there. Right now, I'm looking at a line outside for their barbecue. I've brought friends here to eat and they've enjoyed the food. I still haven't found the best barbecue, you know, the kind you crave and drive many miles for? But, for the meantime I'm good with John."}
{"text":"So many wonderful choices of Grilled BBQ goodness. The service was A+, the food was so delicious and fresh. The meat was moist and juicy. The BBQ sauce is a wonderful addition and compliments the meats. A must try to all locals to bring family and visitor from all over the world to enjoy.  I will return and bring my friends and family."}
{"text":"Great customer service but food in my opinion was average nothing too good nothing too bad"}
{"text":"I read about John Mull's some time ago in the LV Weekly, but somehow I got sidetracked, abducted by aliens and taken to Area 51, or maybe fell into a wormhole or something.  How did I miss this gem right in my own back yard? This place is simply amazing! As you pull into this wonderland of meat it feels like you are a guest of J.R. Ewing's in South Fork or something. (Not that I have been there...but I did watch the show) You get out of your car and you're walking on gravel....classic!! The wonderful aroma of pulled pork, ribs, and brisket immediately fills your nostrils and makes a bee line to your head massaging your medulla oblongata ( Not that I'm a neurologist....but I did watch Quincy back in 1983) I know ...Quincy was an ME, but now you're getting sidetracked. Back to the road kill. I ordered the 3 meat combo with brisket, ribs, and a hot link. My sides were mac n cheese and slaw. It's unlawful to not get some peach cobbler as well. Let's start with the slaw. It was incredible. It had a creamy consistency with excellent flavor. I'm finding out a lot people don't like slaw...I feel sorry for you folks. The ribs were good, could've been just a little more tender to reach that \" fall off the bone status\" you always hear about. Mac n cheese was ridiculous. Brisket-ridiculous. Hot link-ridiculous. Cobbler -double ridiculous. BTW ..ridiculous means Great! Don't leave John Mull's Meats & Road Kill Grill without trying the peach cobbler.. you may be arrested... because it would be a crime. I loved the open air-in somebody's backyard feel to the place. It's very comfortable. I couldn't dream this place any better. Shout out to my cousin Big Mike for telling me how good this place was. I'm adding The Road Kill Grill to my list. I think I can hang out here."}
{"text":"Found The Road kill Grill 10 years ago were from Bakersfield and say let's go to Johns and maybe we will stay the night and go again the next day !   We really come for the food ! Were tempted to relocate just so we can eat here more often ! Nothing in cali compares to it ! This food is in a class by itself. Everyone is so friendly! We had the ribs, three meat combo, brisket, pulled pork Links best ever! High quality make sure one of your sides is Mac and cheese it's from another planet  cheeseatopia ! The deserts cobblers take some home and add ice-cream. The cornbread taste like cake.  If you live here and have never tried this place you are missing out. Our food was up fast it was a Tuesday at 5 and the patio outdoor dining  The kids loved that. three high schoolers! This is a ten Star  The food has stayed at the highest level and been consistently great last 10 yearswe will definitely be back tomorrow LOL"}
{"text":"By far the best BBQ joint in Vegas Would highly recommend to anyone Plus their servings are humongous"}
{"text":"I love this place the food and service is superb! I would recommend this place to anyone interested in eating some quality food!!!"}
{"text":"So delicious!! This place is great. When I went there was about a thirty-minute wait, but it was worth it! They have great customer service and food, so what's not to like. The ribs are super tender, the pulled pork is juicy and flavorful, the brisket is delicious too. I love their collards and coleslaw. I highly recommend this place! It's kind of in a residential location, we almost left when we drove up, but I am so glad we stayed! We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Some of the best BBQ in Vegas hands down!!!!   This hidden little BBQ oasis is very far from where we live but we love to meet friends there on the weekend.  It is so much fun and they often times have entertainment outside while you are eating.  We ordered the 3 meat combo with pulled pork, brisket and links.  It was amazing and the cobbler dessert was delicious as well.    We have also used them so smoke a turkey for us.  It was amazing tasting.  Would highly recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"I'm from Texas and been trying to find good bbq here...this is hands down the Best BBQ in Las Vegas! We thought we were in the wrong area when our GPS took us into a neighborhood and then we found it...the holy grail of bbq!!! For meat we got the brisket, hot links and rib tips. For sides we got the collard greens, mac n cheese, green beans, potato salad and cornbread. The portions are ridiculous, they definitely do not skimp!! Everything had such good flavor from the bit of spice in the green beans to the sweetness of the moist cornbread. The brisket was tender and the hot links had just the right spiciness. I can't say I could tell much of a difference in the hot or mild bbq sauce, but both were good. The line was a bit long but it only tells how good the food is and it was lunchtime on a Saturday, so we didn't mind! We live in the south side of town but I can foresee many more trips here in the future. So glad that we found this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Super super delicious !!! My fiancé is in love with this place !!! Baked beans are delishhhhhh and cornbread  highly recommend everyone to try these meals"}
{"text":"As my quest continues I ventured to John Mull's. I had several co-workers tell me about the place and the reviews are positive. Sadly it is on the other side of town from me but I was on that side and the opportunity was there. When I got there the place was packed. I looked over the menu while I waited. The line moved really fast and when it was my turn to order I got the 3 meat combo. I got ribs, brisket and pulled pork. My sides were mac and cheese, potato salad and beans.  The meats were amazing, very tender and flavorful. The only thing I didn't like (for my taste) the ribs had a bit of a spicy kick to them. The brisket and pulled pork were fantastic. The mac and cheese was the best I've had in along time. The other sides had way to much vinegar flavor to my liking. I will definitely be back but only if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Best barbeque in Las Vegas that I've tried so far, lines are sometimes crazy, but what else would you expect for food this good!"}
{"text":"Excellent Barbeque! Lots of food per order, will always be back for more! Would love to see them open on Sunday's, if you happen to go on a Saturday make sure you arrive early to avoid the long line. Did I mention the best Barbeque in town?"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I am from the Deep South.  I moved here from the Mississippi Delta (just south of Memphis) four years ago.  With that being said, I happen to know two things in life- good food and good people.   Today was the second time I have picked up a catering order from Road Kill for my office.  I am currently still in a euphoric state.  Pulled pork, brisket, collard greens, Mac n cheese, Cole slaw & peach cobbler is what we picked up today.  The food is on point and everybody at work agrees.  Shout out to Rita for helping me place my order and ALL of the staff for their friendly disposition.  There is nothing sub-par about this place.  They have THE BEST barbecue this side of the Mississippi.  I HIGHLY recommend doing business with John Mulls/Road Kill Grill."}
{"text":"I am not a big BBQ eater when I go out to eat.  All of the chains I've been to just don't live up to a good home BBQ'ed meal.  I am pretty sure their motto is \"skimp on the meat because they can't taste it through our 'award winning' BBQ sauce!\"  John Mull's puts these chains to shame and lives up to any claims about being as good as home BBQ!  The place itself resides on a small ranch and has that Old Nevada feel to it.  As a native to this state, I love that about the location.  A dirt parking lot and old wooden fences/structures make me feel like I am on a Nevada road trip.  There is a small out door seating area, but I prefer to take my food over to the Tenaya Creek brewery and have a nice IPA with my BBQ... SO GOOD!  So far I have had the brisket, the ribs, a little bit of pulled pork and chicken.  This place has the best brisket I have ever had!  The stuff sits in it's own juices all day, and is incredibly tender and juicy.  \"Wow\" is all I can say about the brisket after hating this cut from other places.  The ribs are fall off the bone delicious.  Just amazing stuff.  Same goes for the pulled pork and chicken, although the pulled pork is a bit on the salty side.  The BBQ sauce has a thick, lightly sweet quality to it.  I prefer the spicy one (it's not that spicy).  But you really don't need BBQ sauce at all.  That is how good the meat is.  The dry rub kicks the crap out of every place I've been to.  All of the sides are amazing as well.  The only thing I am not a big fan of are the desserts, but that doesn't matter to me because the \"dinner\" portions are so huge that you won't have room for dessert anyway.  Really the dinners are enough for two maybe even three people with that brisket.  Folks, seek this one out.  Take it from a guy that doesn't do Generic Dave's Memphis Subpar BBQ, The BBQ is outstanding here."}
{"text":"I've been here far too many times to count! They never disappoint! I've tried nearly everything on the cafe menu! All the sides are delicious also! The staff is very friendly and will recognize you if they see your face more than twice .. John hires the best of the best! If you're in Las Vegas and looking for amazing BBQ, I highly recommend droppin"}
{"text":"The food is great. My favorite is the bbq chicken all dark meat. The employees are cool. Be prepared to wait in line. This place is always packed."}
{"text":"OMG!  What else can I say?  Yummy!  Delicious, tantalizing, delectable, unassuming, a bang for your buck. GREAT!"}
{"text":"Ok. It is literally just a BBQ shack in the middle of this dirt lot. But the food is amazing. Like amazing. Worth waiting outside in the horrible Vegas heat to get it good. The place also gets points for giving free bottled water to patrons as they wait to go order and get their grub on."}
{"text":"I love this place. I go here for lunch all the time. If your visiting vegas this is a must. This place is amazing."}
{"text":"I love turkey wings & the fresh ones are very hard to get! John Mull stocks them. They are frozen, but with nothing (like salt) added! So, i traveled quite a distance to get some. The employees there are very nice and the butcher offered to cut the wings down to make them easier to bake. However, I'm not sure that I like the flavor or freshness of the wings! They are very, very large &, I think, not that fresh I'd love to give John Mull 5 stars, I really would, but bottom line, if the wings aren't tasty, then every thing else fails"}
{"text":"Worth the drive, worth the wait, super delish!  My husband and I had been wanting to try this place for over two years since we relocated to Las Vegas from Southern California.  We never could think of a reason to go out of our way.  Boy oh boy was I wrong to not go sooner.  My best friend was in town visiting and she had mentioned trying something new for lunch.  We had some time on our hands so we drove up on Veterans Day.  You might get lost, it is in the middle of a horse zoned residential area.  There wasn't an item we didn't try, between what I got, my friend got and what we brought home for my husband.  We had chicken, brisket, hot link, ribs, rib tips, mac salad, potato salad, mac n cheese and beans.  My #1 side is the potato salad, don' t be fooled it is one of a kind.  The hot link was pretty much blow your mind.  Sauce or no sauce this is REAL BBQ."}
{"text":"Having moved from Kansas City, I wasn't hopeful on finding quality local BBQ. However, this has entered my top 5 favorite BBQ spots of all time.   There will be a line, so plan to wait. The workers are great. The building is located in the middle of the neighborhood. So, if you blink you'll miss it. It definitely lives up to the branding of a \"dive\".   Ribs, brisket & sides were enough to put me out! Great spot that I look forward to going back to!"}
{"text":"The food here is always amazing and reasonably priced. We have catered a few parties from here and everyone has loved it. There are never any left overs!"}
{"text":"Oh yes. #100 review for 2017!!! :) woot!  We were in town and met up with a friend and he brought us here. Foodies, he said, loves this place and now we love it as much! It's a bit off the strip, but it's worth it. The location is a little strange, it's in the middle of a residential area. But from talking to our friend and the employees here, this area used to be a ranch with lots of land.   Lines can be long, especially on a hot summer Vegas day, but people are nice and the workers try to get you out as soon as they can.  What we ordered: 3 meat combo (16.99) pork ribs, brisket, and pulled pork Beef rib dinner - can take about 20 minutes tho Sides: collard greens, chili (new!), beans, and mac n cheese Sodas and water $1 Mild or \"hot\" bbq sauce.   Yup everything was good. Sooo frigging good. It is our point to come here EVERY time we are in Vegas.  You are soooo in for a treat. Love this place.  Huge parking area.  $$"}
{"text":"I am disappointed...I am disappointed in myself that I have not been to this place before. Being the only omnivore in my family of vegetarians my BBQ adventures are limited even though I enjoy it do much.   The Road Kill Grill lies in an odd part of Vegas protected by rural land use laws in a neighborhood west of Decatur and Gowan. This place has to be grandfathered in by zoning laws that would not allow this business to operate by today's guidelines.   Anyways, I had the 2 meat combo with sliced Brisket and pulled pork. Comes with two sides and bread, I chose green beans, potato salad, and corn bread. All we're very good, my beans were well seasoned. I usually judge a good barbecue place by their potato salad and this I would definitely get again. I also tried the baked beans which were meat and had a nice smokey flavor on this visit. Brisket was cooked and sliced perfect as well as very tender. The Beef was the highlight here with the absence of rubs and smoke ring. The pulled pork was chewy at times which can happen when sitting in a hot well prior to service. Overall good experience. Several other meat choices are available.  It was busy and the line was moving slowly. No big deal because the staff was friendly and happy to make conversation. The property is really cool and would be great for a private event. They have several tents and picnic tables available for seating. Catering is also available as well as full service butcher shop. If you need someone to process your deer from your fall hunt John Mull's will do that too.   Once again I am disappointed I have not been here sooner. Especially since it's very close to the house. I will be back often."}
{"text":"This place is perfect! Friendly service and delicious bbq. The sides are all great too. No complaints here."}
{"text":"I skipped the Road Kill Grill and headed straight for the butcher shop. My order was taken quickly and the young woman that took my order was knowledgeable. Once the order was in we stepped back and waited, it did take some time but it was worth it. The meat that was ordered was very high quality, wrapped with care and the prices were beyond fair. Everyone was friendly especially the owner.   If you decide to order a bone in chicken breast don't expect a small rubbery grocery store cut. You will be pleasantly surprised. Normally I cannot be bothered to eat left over chicken but this was the exception.   Next time (and there will be a next time) I will likely call in my order ahead of time so it is waiting for me but even if I didn't it is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Well, we came here for lunch on a Tuesday. As we pulled into the gravel parking lot it brought me back to the time I went to the Salt Lick in Texas. If you get lpst, just follow your nose. You can smell the delicious meats smoking.   We had my friend's dad order for us. They have been coming here before they were a restaurant. I trusted his judgment. He ended up just ordering three 3 meat combos that we shared family style at one of their picnic tables. He ordered brisket,  hot links, and ribs. I tend to stick to my favorite kind of BBQ which was the brisket.  I also tried the hot links which I will also get the next time we go there. The sides we had were the mac & cheese, baked beans, cole slaw, and the macaroni salad.   First of all, the brisket was so tasty and tender. The hot links weren't too spicy. I like the snap it had when I bit it. I preferred the spicy BBQ sauce instead of their original. It isn't too spicy, but it does give you a little kick heat which went well with the food.   I guess I'm a creature of habit and only tried the mac & cheese and bread. Both of which I devoured. I put the brisket and hot link in the bread and made a little sandwich of BBQ heaven.  I don't regret that I didn't try the other sides because I was completely content with what I ate.   I will definitely be back. It was well worth the drive over to the other side of town from where I live.   Okay, well I do have one regret. I didn't take any pictures of the food because I was so hungry. Haha"}
{"text":"Johnny mulls is just the most delicious bbq ive ever had. I ordered the 3 meal combo should of ordered extra corn bread. But this place is a must go if you want the best bbq im town."}
{"text":"I moved to Las Vegas back in mid-August and saw this place on DD&D and decided to give it a try. I ordered a 3-meat combo of brisket, chicken, and a hot link with a side of mac and cheese, potato salad, and cornbread. The brisket was easily the best I ever had, with a really good smokey flavor. I also enjoyed the chicken as well as the mac and cheese and the potato salad. I didn't really enjoy the hot link too much though. I found it too salty and the fact that they cook it on one side made it tough to bite through. Also the cornbread was essentially pre-made and wasn't very good as well.   Overall, though, I would gladly come back if given the opportunity. The food was good and the staff was nice and friendly. Just, if you can, eat inside your car if possible. The venue is outdoors and I got chased back to my car by a few bees that liked the food I had as well."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Vegas hands down. After you come here once no need to go anywhere else. It's all good Mac and cheese brisket everything."}
{"text":"This place is great! Wonderful beef brisket and tri tip sandwich! The hot BBQ sauce had just the right amount of zing. Lots of outdoor seating. Excellent food and fun people!"}
{"text":"Ok don't all attack me at once... I'm not a big fan. I spent years in the south with some great bbq so I have yet to find good bbq outside of the south I truly love. So that's my comparison for stars.... The ribs were good but not as flavorful and fall off the bone as should be. The pulled chicken didn't have balance of flavor and the Mac and cheese was too runny. The little one didn't want anything to do with it. I tasted the cobbler but this is not good cobbler as barely had flavor, and cobbler probably is one of my fave desserts!  The line wasn't bad but we had big group so rather than everyone specializing on a meat to make really well, each group had a chef and our order took a really long time. Not good when have kids waiting! Not a big fan of tables in parking lot with dirt kicking up in my face from the wind either. Sorry just will wait to go back down south! I might try the butcher though as an alternative.... Seemed to have an extensive selection..."}
{"text":"I attended a party (#Amerex) in Las Vegas and Road Kill Grill did the catering. I have heard of this place and it lived up to the hype. The pulled pork was some of the best I have ever had. The beans, mac and cheese and corn bread were also amazing. If you have the chance to eat here, do it."}
{"text":"Driving across the US is part if my job. I stop in big cities and small. Prior to my visit here, a Texas joint was my favorite BBQ in the nation. I'd guess I've tried 40+ joints across the US. I have a new top favorite now and its right here. Im not sure what I like most. Ribs, brisket or sausage. Haven't tried the chicken yet but if its liks the rest of their BBQ....It's on my list to try."}
{"text":"Okay so i'm sort of mixed on this place and that's why I gave it 3 stars and i'll tell you why in a second. So I want to make clear i'm not reviewing the Butcher Shop i'm reviewing the Road Kill Grill. So I only ever really come to this place once in a blue moon and I've had really good experiences and really bad. The food is great and the service is fast, they really get you in and out in a jiffy. However it sort of depends whose working the food counter. I've gotten sick from their Mac & Cheese before and ended up getting food poisoning but I've gone back and had great meals. This past meal that I had was fantastic, fresh, well prepared, and delicious.  I guess it sort of depends on what time of day you go. The time that I got sick I went close to closing (they are only open till 6pm and I went around 5pm) and the time that I went when I had a great meal was around lunch time. I guess it just depends on when you go. Otherwise a decent restaurant for a decent price."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and they also act as a butcher. I'll never buy meat from a grocery store again. I saw feed my German shepherd because she's allergic to all that processed garbage everyone offers."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place for while now. I had the combo plate with ribs and brisket. The ribs fell apart they were very tasty. The brisket was smoked just right very tender. The sides were even better try the potato salad and cole slaw. I will be heading back soon."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! My parents always come here (literally every weekend). They always bring leftovers and its delicious. So I finally came to try it out my self....amazing! Love this place and their food is delicious!"}
{"text":"The Roadkill Grill was featured on Diners, Drive-In, and Dives so I knew I had to stop by and try their barbeque grub. This little spot was definitely hard to find! It's hidden away in a residential neighborhood and the grill itself is located in a little butcher shop. Bascially the butcher shop set up a little cafeteria-style barbeque service where you go through the line and they scoop what you want into little styrofoam take out boxes and you go outside and eat at little pinic tables. I was skeptical at first, but boy I was definitely glad I went out of my way to try this place.   They have a variety of BBQ fare ready to order like: hot links, brisket, ribs, pulled pork/chicked which can be served with a side of baked beans, mac & cheese or potato salad just to name a few. Everything was really delicious and packed all the flavors of what awesome BBQ should be.   The hot links were featured on the show and now I know why! They're made fresh in the shop and have the perfect amount of spice. And I can not tell you enough how good the baked beans are! I must have licked my plate clean!  Bad thing is that you have to eat outside in the Vegas heat. However, they have fans set up with misters, which helps somewhat. Or you can take your order to go and enjoy in the comfort of your own home. I'll be back, that's for sure."}
{"text":"This is my favorite barbeque place in Vegas. We have ordered from here numerous times now and have never been dissatisfied. The ribs are tender, the brisket is to die for, the hot Links are delicious, the rib tips are wonderful, the tri tip is tender. I don't eat chicken but my family members who do enjoy that too! My daughter always asks for the Mac n chéese and even though I am normally not a fan of beans, I devour the baked beans. So good! Friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. Best BBQ I've had. The employees work their butts off in the hot sun making great food and still are super friendly. They also give free water and have misters everywhere so it's not too bad sitting outside. Mac N Cheese is homemade and super cheesy. I think my favorites were the ribs and hot links, but everything was superb. The best part of Las Vegas."}
{"text":"The best BBQ in Vegas. Corn Bread is sweet and meat is so tender!!!! MMMM GoOd!!"}
{"text":"This review is for the Road Kill Grill section.  Looking for this place off of Thom Blvd, you can easily miss it if you are not looking hard enough. What's funny is that they have two decent sized signs and I still almost ended up passing them. You are actually in the middle of a neighborhood and all of a sudden you see several small ranch style buildings. It kind of looks like a western setting for an old cowboy movie.  Once you find the dirt/gravel parking lot, make your way to the building that says John Mull's Meats and Road Kill Grill. When you come in, the bulk meat ordering section is to your right while the hot food section is to your left. You tell the attendant behind the hot food counter what you want and they will put it in a to go container for you coming from pans that are already prepared.   What I ordered was the 2 meat combo for 14 dollars. The 3 meat was only 2 dollars more but damn, I know for sure I am not gonna finish the 2 meat. Meat choices were Hot Links, Brisket, Ribs, Pulled Pork, Pulled Chicken, 1/4 Chicken, Rib Tips, and Tri Tip on Tues and Thursday only. I chose the Brisket and Pulled Pork. Comes with your choice of 2 sides which were Potato Salad, Macaroni Salad, Baked Beans, Green Beans, Cole Slaw, and Mac n Cheese. I opted for the Potato Salad and Mac n Cheese. If you refer to my picture, its a lot of food!  So when you pay towards the end of the counter, you have a choice of regular or spicy barbeque sauce in a little to go cup. I sampled both and the spicy was better than the original. Not make you sweat spicy, but just that little flavor kick to get you going. What's pretty cool is that they have the sauces in warmers so you get it heated.  Once you pay, you have the option of going home, staying in your car, or look for one of several tables outside to sit down and eat. Remember, the building you came from only houses the butcher meats and hot foods only.  Service is decent. From my assumption if the place is packed you will definitely have to wait a while. Of course you can call ahead and pick up also.  Some random info. Their bathroom is literally in the back where all their pits and smokers are so if you need to go you can probably catch the cooks in action. I suggest getting the 3 meat combo to share cuz its a lot of food and you can save money! The roads leading up to their place is all 25 miles per hour. On certain days, cops like to meet their quota by hanging out around this area so watch your speed!  So overall, they have some decent barbeque here. I just wouldn't make an extra special trip just to eat here though."}
{"text":"Started as a butcher shop, but they do an amazing job on the BBQ menu. Cannot get any more of a rough diamond than this place, plus it is located in the middle of a residential neighborhood. The only set up the outside service on Saturdays, otherwise you have to go through the VERY cramped little building to order menu or butcher shop items. They concentrate 100% on the food, are very friendly and helpful, but dining is on picnic tables in a gravel parking lot. This place is a true to life urban legend."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this spot, I saw so many awesome reviews, yet wasn't overly impressed. My bf ordered the two meat combo with ribs and hot links, his sides were Mac and cheese,and yams. I honestly think this meal  was just ok, the Mac and cheese was great texture wise, but lacked so much flavor! Bland to say the least, the hot links were good no issues with that , yams were basic nothing to go back for more. As far the ribs, they were very little, and we did wish they were cooked more, we  love a nice charred taste on the outside. Next we had the pulled pork sandwich, pork was great but def needed cole slaw, which it doesn't come with, but they were all out to order a side of it. The portion size was huge which was a plus, for my sides I got the Mac and green beans, as i said Mac was bland and the string beans were WAY TOO SALTY! Coming from someone loves flavor!  The beans should of lended some salt to the Mac! LOL!   **I will add that the prices are very reasonable, and I would probably give it another try, just not worth that long line they have every weekend!**"}
{"text":"This place of off the hook!!! The barbecue is the best I've had in Vegas love it I will always go back there when I can because the food is incredible. The service is always top-notch the people are friendly and you can tell they love their job. M"}
{"text":"My friend Evan and I decided to try this place while visiting New Frontier Armory. We were not dissapointed. The line took a little bit to get our order in, but the owner came out with samples of chicken and beans, it was awesome. The order area inside only holds about 12 people so they come take your order in line and you pick it up then go outside to eat it or take it home. We both ordered the 3 item combo, I had chicken, brisket and a hot link, sides included some awesome chili beans, Mac n chese and sweet potatoes. I had corn bread. THAT WAS OUR OF THIS WORLD AWESOME. It was a desert in itself.  You owe it to yourself to try this place and make it your new favorite. I will be driving over an hour away to eat here."}
{"text":"I came here back in May And the food was so amazing. So I knew this visit back to Vegas this place was on the list of things to do... The fact that they gave me a sample was BOMB because it sold me on buying three dinners when I originally only came to buy one!!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best restaurant food I've ever had. The smoked links, brisket, and burnt ends were tender and flavorful. I could've just eaten a plate of side. The greens and baked beans have chunks of meat in them and were cooked to perfection. Best mac n cheese I've had at a restaurant.   They only have to water and soda. But they said you can byob."}
{"text":"This is by far the best BBQ around. We had the pulled pork, brisket and hot links. I can't wait to go back to try the chicken, tri-tip and ribs! The Mac and Cheese is the best I have ever tasted.... I could eat a whole meal of just that. The beans are cooked with meat and are also great. This will definitely be a regular meal for my family!"}
{"text":"Best barbecue I've ever had in this town... In my life! The macaroni and cheese is to die for, the hot links are amazing, the coleslaw is a different flavor yet excellent! The staff was nice, very old school place. Puts Memphis BBQ, M+M soul food cafe, all other BBQ spots to shame. We will be back!"}
{"text":"It's 109 outside.. I'm eating the best mac n cheese I have ever had. The roll for the pulled pork could have been made a week a go but the pork inside is great.  I would come again for an I V bag of the mac n cheese."}
{"text":"Great for BBQ different meats and sides a great place to get BBQ while in town or if you live here. But if you want food on the weekend you need to come early due to long lines for a high demand taste."}
{"text":"On Saturday, 9/10 i threw my husband a surprise birthday party...we are from CA and my nephew recommended you guys...I cannot have picked a better place to order the best BBQ in Vegas! I had not even had your food before so I was strictly going based on my nephew's feedback plus all the reviews here on Yelp....What can I say....everyone was so polite from ordering the food over the phone to the actual delivery by bob....very friendly and it was perfect.    I ordered for approx 60 people and there was so much leftovers, we had a 2nd party the next day! We ordered the Ribs, Rib Tips, BBQ Chicken, hotlinks and mac salad! everything was sooood and everyone kept asking me where the food was from! Thanks Road Kill Grill!.....i highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"After we were directed to this place by Maps, I thought we weren't in the right place. It's in an actual ordinary neighborhood surrounded by ordinary houses. But once you pull up you automatically see the long line that has formed.   We came on a Saturday afternoon, which you can guess is their busiest time of the week. We waited in line for 1 hour and 10 minutes. I honesty think the line wasn't THAT long. I thought we'd be in line for 30 minutes and not 1 hour 10 minutes. I definitely developed a big appetite by the time we got to the front of the line.   I ordered a 2 meat combo w/ collared greens & Mac n Cheese. I chose 1/4 chicken and ribs as my meats. I also ordered a peach cobbler. I picked the HOT BBQ sauce which was the perfect kick. The meats were on point with the moistness and flavors. The Mac n Cheese was to die for. Probably one of the best I've tasted. Now the peach cobbler tasted like it just came out of the oven it was so delicious.   The portions are pretty big. I barely even dented my meal. I had to save it for later. They aren't cheap with their food, for sure.   One thing that bothered me was.. They took a deer or some sort of animal out of the trunk and carried it to the door. It was dead and i think it was skinned! I gasped and turned around real quick! I mean I know I'm eating animals but I sure don't want to see how you make it, kill it, or cut it!   Staff was nice. I suggest coming on a weekday early in the morning so you don't get stuck in the line for hours. And order and eat at home if you didn't travel far because they only have outside seating and there are flies everywhere."}
{"text":"Top notched BBQ!!  I had the the pulled pork......BOOM!!  This sandwich and the sides rocked.  Next trip I am all over the pulled chicken sandwich.  Oh yeah....... You can get your deer butchered there too."}
{"text":"I went to the restaurant today the flavor was good, but the meat was not tender. The Mac&Cheese and the yams were great, they need to work on the customer service skills with the server. Poor customer service can cause the company to have problems."}
{"text":"Best bbq in Vegas, I come here often and also purchase my meats here when I'm feeling fancy. I haven't come across a better bbq joint here and I've lived here my whole life. Will continue to go!"}
{"text":"tldr  This place was very comforting and generous. We went during Memorial Day weekend and they were cooking up complimentary hotdogs and burgers that were surprisingly very savory. Staff was incredibly friendly and a good family destination with an authentic feel.  Got: -three meat combo (brisket, ribs, pulled chicken): came with mac and cheese, green beans and cornbread. The brisket and pulled chicken were  great!"}
{"text":"As far as BBQ joints go this is by far the gold standard for Las Vegas. I was almost fooled when my GPS took me down a residential street and slowly guided me towards a big red farm. Then the wind shifted and smell hit me... Biggity bam ....just like that, I instantly knew we were in for a treat. The inside is small, crowded, and packed from corner to corner, my kind of spot. Once we got the food, the plan was to travel 30 minutes back home then sit and enjoy. I'm happy we didn't wait because I absolutely wrecked that plate....yelp then I turned around went right back inside and ordered some more. BBQ coma!!!   ...Did I mention that they have peach and apple cobblers. Why must you be a 35 minute drive from home!?!"}
{"text":"Let me say that my brother watches the foodie shows and when we moved here, this was HIS FIRST choice for us to try.  For 3 1/2 yrs, we were at least, once a week guest, sometimes twice a week.  February this yr. I had hip replacement surgery and haven't been able to get here as frequently.  HOWEVER, you want to know just how much they appreciate their guest ~~ first each person is treated special ALL THE TIME, but yesterday, they went O. V. E. R. THE TOP!! First week back to work and yesterday, what was I craving ~ but ~ I had forgot they closed at 6. I don't get off now until 6 now, so I'm DEVASTATED!!  But I got there yesterday say about 6:07 ~ another woman arrived at the same time. Of course she could move faster than me and by the time I got mid way to the door, she was walking back. I'm like oh no, please tell me they are not closed. She was like yep, sign says 6. I'm like, no, did you try the door {in my very desperate voice}? She says no, let's go try the door.  Yep clossssssed  BUT, the Angel owner sees us, and let's us go in.  Now, his TEAM, was tired and trying to clean up and go home. You'd never know it. Those same smiles, that same politeness and being helpful ~~~ ALWAYS THE BEST!! I LOVE  YOUR TEAM SO MUCH!! And guess what, I'm back!!!"}
{"text":"If you want really good food, this is most definitely the place to go. The location is a little jarring & will probably catch you off guard the first time you go- It's located in a 'not so nice' residential area in the middle of a dirt lot. But, if something little like that bothers you enough to not eat amazing ribs, then, so be it! But just know that you're missing out on some of the best BBQ I've ever had. Highly recommend the brisket or the hot links! Also, their mac n' cheese is probably the greatest gift to earth. All in all, the location is a good 30-40 minute drive from where I live but if I'm craving some good BBQ, it's totally worth the drive."}
{"text":"This review is for Road Kill Grill... The ribs were tasty enough but very dry & overcooked as was the brisket. The mac & cheese was forgettable just like the potato salad.  The spicy BBQ sauce was the best part about the meal. I also do not like how you have to wait in the same damn room that they sell the butcher meat in which is already an extremely small place & the door is constantly bumping someone in the ass. This place is WAY OVERRATED. I have eaten from their truck before & for some reason it was better. The sad thing is that since that Guy Fieri said it was good on his Drive-Ins & Dives show every sheep in Las Vegas can't think with their own tastebuds... either that or BBQ has some really slim pickins in Sin City."}
{"text":"I would say this gets 4.75 stars and I round up!   The good: The food is OUT OF SIGHT! At least as good as I have ever had and a few items that are off the CHARTS good! The two items that come to mind is the mac and cheese and the brisket. Both are the best I have ever had. The portions are HUGE!!! I love that as big as I am (6'5, 260) I can easily make two meals out of their 3 meat combo. The service is great and they really make you feel at home. You feel apart of the family and I love that type of experience!  The bad: There is no indoor seating. The drive is LONG if you live in the south side of town."}
{"text":"My dad sends me orders to take home the hot links whenever we are going home.  We stopped by on Veterans Day for lunch and they were giving away free lunch to celebrate the Day.  These are amazing business people folks and have our business for sure!"}
{"text":"WOW everything is good EVERYTHING  Service OUTSTANDING  Food DELICIOUS  We haven't had good greens since we left chicago, but this place can make greens that scream excellence  The cornbread is REAL cornbread not some dried up muffin caked in honey LOVE LOVE LOVE  Thank you so much for restoring my faith that people can still cook! We'll see you soon!!"}
{"text":"So good and huge potions. Got there on a hot Monday right at noon and there wasn't a line at all. Got the food to go and ate back at the hotel. Ordered 2 2 combo plates and it fed 3 adults and 2 kids. Favorites pretty much all-hot links, brisk it, pulled pork and pulled chicken.  Sides Mac and cheese was everyone's favorite and kids devoted the green beans. Excellent service great prices excellent food!"}
{"text":"Of the pulled pork, my man said \"if that fell on the ground, I would still eat it\". Fantastic. Burnt ends, ribs, brisket, all amazing. Indifferent to the Cole slaw, great baked beans. We sat down starving but couldn't finish it all"}
{"text":"There are some places that treat you well and there are some places that treat you right. This food joint treats you right.  I love this place! I caught Guy Fieri's Drive Ins, Diners and Dives and I took my family to test the offerings. My order was a rib combo with tri-tip, baked beans and mac & cheese. To get this combo, you have to be here Tuesdays or Thursdays. It's not served any other days. The baked beans they were to die for! Great taste and right amount of sweetness and BBQ you'd want in the baked beans with a bit of meat lurking in there. These ribs are the best in town: great chew, meaty, fall off the bone-type stuff and not slathered with too much sauce. Most of the flavor comes from the prep where they vacuum seal it into the meat in prep for hours. Genius! The mac and cheese is equally a crowd pleaser. I could have that for days. The price is right and we will be back to test the fabled brisket and peach cobbler. I can't wait!  Speaking of waiting, we waited a while. So get here before opening if you don't like lines. I say 10:30 am is about right these days. But if you're in a line, no worries! I don't know if this is normal but it seemed normal so I'll report it. I already walked away with my order when I saw this. The line was a good 200 feet long or more. people were going to have to wait because when you get to the pick up area people hem and haw a bit. I know some of these people are standing in line for about a good  1/2 hour already and it's about 12:30 pm. So one of the cooks comes out from the cooking and has one of those trays/containers you see that they put in the food warming cart to keep things hot and ready to eat. And he goes to everyone who hasn't seen the cashier yet and gives each one a rib to tide them over until they can get their order in. How cool is that?!?  What's my bottom line? Give them your money and eat their food. This is championship quality BBQ at great prices. My actual rating is a 4.7 stars..."}
{"text":"I got the two meat combo, brisket and burnt ends...yams and Mac and Cheese....everything was on point! I didn't even need sauce the meat was so good! I received good sized portions for the price! My only go to now! Took a min to get my food and pay because they are so busy but it was well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"So, I had been wanting to try this place for quite some time and finally got around to it. The line took just about an hour to get through. You order, then keep moving through the line to get your food. When it was our turn to get our food they were out of pulled pork and said it would be about 15 minutes. I was kind of tired of waiting so I asked if they could just double the brisket and they were happy to do so. I did notice that after we were done and leaving, the people behind us in line were still waiting for their pork. The hubby and I shared the 3 meat combo, but ended up with just the brisket and rib tips. Both were great. The baked beans were AMAZING and the coleslaw was just ok. It was more than enough food for the two of us. The only bummer here was the line."}
{"text":"Wow, totally bought into The Triple D review hook, line & sinker. Guy you really need to taste this BBQ before film it. Damn one of the 2nd worst BBQ experiences  I've ever encountered. It tasted like they really do serve road kill verse BBQ.  First off trying to find this place is a joke. It's in a neighborhood giving the indication your going to someone's backyard BBQ. Once you get there you enter this overcrowded room to order your food. People are climbing all over each other to order, and I was hit but the door at least 6 times because of overcrowding. Now while I'm waiting I watch some lady handling food with her dirty hands, BARF!   So after witnessing health hazard 101, I finally get to order.. It's lunch time and I order a Dr Pepper with my meal. But guess what, these idiots don't have any chilled. Most business's have a cooler but JOHNS  BBQ blunder team just sticks the cans in ice, Except at lunch time.  The food is really a 5 star disappointment. The ribs were not moist or very meaty an overly spicy to boot. Someone went heavy on the pepper rub which just added to why the ribs just sucked.. If your a rib joint then act line one and serve quality ribs. However I remembered the boil & grill their ribs verse smoke them slow & low....   You may wanna rethink your BBQ trip. Don't say i didn't warn you."}
{"text":"I am hardly ever in the mood for BBQ but when I am it better be the best, and this place satisfies any BBQ craving I have, and then some.   First seen on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives I remember placing John Mulls in my memory banks for a later date. I think 2 years passed by and they ran a re-run of the episode that featured this BBQ heaven. \"Oh yeah!! I totally forgot!!\" A few days later after we saw the episode for a second time. we proceeded to satiate our BBQ needs. I was thrilled to find that this place was like a mile away from my house and it was easily accessible. We drove down the residential street, unsure if we were headed in the right direction and sure enough there was Mr. Mull's property...love shack and all.   We stepped into the butcher shop where it was very no-nonsense, \"soup-nazi (Seinfeld reference)\" type of ordering. There was chaos and an assembly line of sorts but the employees putting the food together were so nice and John Mull himself came out with MORE food and was extremely personable himself. I ordered a two-meat combo which included a huge portion of chicken (yum), a huge portion of pulled pork (more yum) and two sides. OMG the box the food came in was so heavy. I know now that the next time I go, bring someone to share it with...it isn't the cheapest but you totally get your monies worth. Just a warning...The seating is pretty primative. Once you get your food the only available seating is outside. A few picnic tables under a shack with misters. Thankfully it wasn't too hot and we were able to enjoy our meal outside. In the summer I will most definetly be taking this to go...to my house. Did I mention I live right around the corner from it? (Angels singing)  Writing this is making me crave BBQ now, uh-oh."}
{"text":"This place really hit the spot after a track meet!  I knew this place was off the beaten path, but i was surprised how it's a gravel driveway in what looks like a one story home!  I had the pulled pork sandwich with mac and cheese.  The BBQ sauce had a little kick to it and the meat was slow-cooked and well done.  My southern friend approved (and he rarely approves of anything in Vegas) and everyone in my group is looking forward to my next meet (or excuse) to come here.  I plan on buying my meat from here for my next pool cookout, I only wish this place was so far off of the 95..."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  The food is some of the best I have ever had and the people are super friendly!  We got a little bit of almost everything on the menu and absolutely every bite was delicious!!!  I will never come to Vegas again without eating here."}
{"text":"They have great food!! I absolutely LOVE their Mac and cheese!!! It is the best I ever had!!"}
{"text":"This place is crazy good. I was expecting a decent meal but this place out preformed my every expectation. I bought the 3 meat combo and after 20min of eating I fed 3 other people in my office. The food was so good I had to take pics and send them to my wife. It looks like this is where I'll be having lunch tomorrow"}
{"text":"They are the type of BBQ I've even looking for out here in Vegas. Totally got it down to the tee of what BBQ experience.   It's in at resilience but ranch style all the way. They cater to the total BBQ fanatics like myself and to hunters who wanna bring their kill \"deer, elk ....etc\" so they can cut it up and prepare it for the freezer for eating later. I love this place!!!!"}
{"text":"WOW!  What a fun find in the middle of a neighborhood!  Go early on the weekends if you want to have lunch... get there by Noon otherwise there's a HUGE line for the grill.  Lots of yummy choices on the grill.... sandwiches and plates...  Here's the link to their menu (picnic style):  http://johnmullsmeats.com/image/data/pdfs/John%20Mull's%20Road%20Kill%20Grill%20Menu%2008-15-12.pdf  Plan on outdoor eating... they have some tables under shade... some are not.  So, it's wise to wear a hat, sunglasses and sunscreen.    Their area is gravel/dirt so dress appropriately. They have 2 parking areas on either side of their grill area.  The Meat Market/Butcher Shop is AWESOME!   You can get all kinds of different meats and cuts.  You can specify the thickness of the cuts you order too.  And if you order over $50 ... you get a FREE flat of farm fresh eggs.  (Did you know a flat of eggs is 24?!)  We didn't realize we were getting this and we were unprepared for it.  Oh well... got home safe with all eggs in tact.   For lunch I ordered the Brisket Sandwich.... it's brisket on a roll.  I should re-phrase..... LOTS of brisket on a roll.  I took 1/2 home.  The meat is super moist and tender and flavorful.  Not salty tasting.    I also got a side of mac salad.  It's pretty good.  It was made with the little round macaroni pasta noodles.... not the elbow ones.... it was a little mayo-y and sweet for me.  I prefer the kind that has some mustard flavor to it.  But still this one was solid not store bought.  The husband got the 2 plate meat... it came with 2 sides... he got brisket and hot links with cole slaw and potato salad.  The cole slaw was a bit runny and I didn't care for it.  I like cole slaw that is crisp and crunchy and I think because they have to pre-make so much of it that it sits in the dressing too long.  The potato salad was Really Good..... Get the Potato Salad.  :)  The Hot Links had a bit of \"hotness\" to it but not super spicy/hot.... they had good texture and great flavor.  I think these would make a Great Hot Dog.  :)   We will totally be back.  :)  Note: closed on Sundays"}
{"text":"I understand here are different styles of bbq but I feel you should judge good bbq on the brisket this wasnt even close to the best u can get in texas, the brisket wasnt cut to order asked for fatty didnt get it. The brisket was pre sliced and kept warm and moist in some very tasty juices from the meat perhaps. The sauce was good they had two kinds mild and spicy, the mild tasted brown sugerish. The potato salad was bland the beans were spicey. Id recomend the sauasage and mac and cheese thats about all i could say wad decent. The location is odd kind of in a neighborhood and no inside seating, you order inside and carry it outside to eat there at the picnic tables or Togo."}
{"text":"We drove from the other side of Las Vegas during our trip just to savor this supposed delicacy.  It was not only recommended by Dinners, Drive-in's and Dives but also by a good friend of ours.  We were very disappointed.  I ordered the 3 meat combo.... tri tip, ribs and 1/4 chicken with mac & cheese and baked beans.  They also include cornbread. The sides were awesome... well flavored, moist and enjoyable.   The corn was also very good, Then to the meats, The chicken was horribly dry.  Couldn't eat it at all The ribs were also very dry.  I guess you have to smother them in sauce to even eat them. If that's the case, why not serve cardboard. The tri tip, at least had some moisture and meat flavor. I will not be back and I highly do not recommend. Being from SoCal, we highly recommend Phil's BBQ,  a little more pricey, but much better BBQ."}
{"text":"Best BBQ I've ever had hands down!! I will be back and I will be bringing anyone who comes into town!!"}
{"text":"I visited John Mulls today for the first time. My boyfriend has been raving about it for months and finally got me to try it out. Our meal was worth the wait! This is the best pulled pork I have ever had! The mac and cheese was also perfect, and the cherry cobbler was delicious. The customer service was great, and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Yes, this review is being written by someone who has just started eating meat again after being vegan for 4 years, but I was not that impressed with John Mull's. Standing in line and then walking through a very small and cramped kitchen/office/prep area to pick up my food wasn't pleasant and it didn't seem very sanitary with that many people coming in and out. A large number of customers were stuffed into the pick up line and employees served up our orders in styrofoam containers. We added bbq sauce, drinks, paid, and went outside to find a seat. I ordered a two meat combo of brisket and rib tips with mac and cheese and coleslaw as my sides. Thank goodness we ordered sides of cornbread because it was as sweet as birthday cake and sadly the highlight of my meal. Dare I say that I enjoy Famous Dave's a lot more than I did John's."}
{"text":"Thought I put the address in wrong, but no, really good food. Worth the trip off the freeway."}
{"text":"Whoever wrote the 1 and 2 star reviews on this place are complete morons... I dare anyone in Las Vegas to name a better tasting BBQ place than john mulls... The whole beauty of the place is that  it's hidden away in a neighborhood and only the people that have heard about a great this place is can find it.. Someone actually wrote a negative review saying it was overcrowded... Hey idiot !! It's overcrowded because the food is so damn good!!  Use ur brain!  The Mac n cheese best I've ever had period. The meats to die for.. Best BBQ you will find here in Vegas period...."}
{"text":"Most of the food is pretty good. Mac and cheese is very good....BUT Miss Rita (the manager?) is HORRIBLE! The words \"customer service\" do not exist in her vocabulary! We called in an order for the DECATUR store. We went to the address listed in YELP. The address was COMPLETELY WRONG! We called to see where it was because we couldn't find it, and they said that YELP put in the wrong address, and they couldn't fix it. (God forbid they would have told us that when we ordered the food.) YELP also had ONLY 1 PHONE NUMBER for John Mulls. They told us we had to go about another 10-15 minutes out of the way. We FINALLY got to the restaurant and they said they didn't have our order there. To make this shorter, the counter guy called \"Miss Rita\" and she said we were LYING, and that we NEVER ordered it for the Decatur store.(We even called back to find the damn location!!) She was talking SO LOUD and was SO NASTY on the phone to the counter guy, that we could hear her over the counter! The poor guy was embarassed. The story continues...but basically we will NEVER give another dime to \"Miss Rita!!\" Quite frankly \"Miss Rita\" is a B!"}
{"text":"A buddy of mine decided to choose where to eat. Usually I'm a little hesitant but said hey why not try something different. He took us out in our rental car like 30 minutes out of the Strip. We were in the middle of nowhere. I initially thought we were completely lost. Rolls up in a residential area and to my disbelief we arrived to farm of some sort. Parked and saw over 40 people in line! A hole in the rough! I love how this place is tucked away from the unappreciative eaters.   People who travel THIS far for BBQ means that it has to be legit. Shared the 3 item combo. Ribs. Brisket. and Rib Tips. side of Mac N Cheese and the baked beans.   The dry rub on the ribs are bonkers. I haven't had decent dry rub on the west coast in a long while. Memphis is the KING to dry rub. The brisket was moist and the hot/bbq sauce is definitely memorable. Sides were gorgeous paired well. Best part that plate cost $19 to share for 2 people and we couldn't even finish it.   Remember, there are JEWELS in Vegas you just gotta find em. Don't let a billboard dictate your tastebuds ... buds."}
{"text":"Best BBQ I have ever had. And the sides are amazing. I usually get ribs with Mac n cheese and green beans.  The location is outdoor diining so be careful of the weather otherwise it's always great.   Btw I forgot to mention this place is cheap af especially for BBQ. $15 for the rub combo meal!"}
{"text":"BBQ varies from place to place, but in general sweet BBQ is kinda taking over and I'll admit it's not my favorite. The BBQ is great but not anything special. I'd come back again but wouldn't make it a point. Their sweet cornbread is delicious and my favorite thing was the Mac n cheese! Cobblers were fine, but I'd more cornbread vs those!"}
{"text":"Our favorite place for bbq. Once you order food here you'll never want to go to any of the bbq chain restaurants."}
{"text":"I love butchers.  I especially love a butcher shop run by a family who knows their meats, and John Mull's is it.  I've been to a few others around town, but this place is spotless, the entire building is like a walk in freezer (meaning fresh meat out of the back and stays fresh while cutting and bagging) and it's a simple set up.  You have the cash counter up front where you grab a paper that has this 2 page list of all the cuts you can get, and then the old man behind the counter -- who is totally awesome and very sweet -- helps you with thickness and cooking tips.  I cannot believe how many varieties of meats they have available, and what made me even more intrigued was their smoked bacon slabs, done right in the smoke house on site.  Oh yeah, baby.  Sweet lovin' bacon slabs, cut to order.  I grabbed 1.5 lbs of their smoked bacon (without rind cause they suggested it that way), two 1\" ribeye steaks cut FRESH from the slab, and 4 pork chops cut thick enough for pan frying cut fresh off the slab.  It was fun to watch, fun to order, and a shocker at the register.  All that meat, ALL that meat was 25 bucks.  WOW.  I freaked out.  I know that the pork was at least 6 pounds and the ribeyes were 18oz each, and then the bacon...all for 25 bucks?  I was happy as can be walking out of there.  Screw the supermarkets.  I'm buying my meats from John Mull's from now on.  They have all I need when I need it.  If you're looking for a butcher up in the northwest area, head to this place.  It's worth the drive, and was a well kept secret of the neighborhood until now.    PS: They cater, so if you want great bbq just ask when you get there.  You can also call and order things in advance."}
{"text":"We go here every time that we are in Vegas for conventions.  Tried chicken, ribs, tri-tip, brisket, and pork.  not one single time has any item been even close to bad.  Portions that could fill even the biggest of eaters for a VERY reasonable price.  I have traveled all over the country, and eaten at many different BBQ joints.  this is easily one of the top 3 i have ever had, and its CONSISTENT"}
{"text":"OMG...the most amazing BBQ place in Las Vegas...it was a drive for me but totally worth it....the Hot Link sandwich was life changing...the ribs and brisket are mouth watering good...and the sides are perfect"}
{"text":"Always delicious! Super friendly staff and the owner is a sweet heart. The food is always so fresh. There may be a bit of a wait since the food is sooooo good. Sometimes they will go around offering a piece of bbq rib while you wait in line to order. What a wonderful personal touch. Love this place! Great food and great people."}
{"text":"I am just in awe and still trying to come down from the high of enjoying this amazing meal!  I had some pulled pork, hot links, baked beans, peach cobbler, yams, Mac and Cheese, and corn bread! All of it was just amazing and delicious."}
{"text":"So, when we think bbq we think smoked meats.  If that's what you're  looking for this is not the place.  The brisket had no smoke ring at all.  It's like eating roast served in a bbq mop sauce.  Same description for the pulled pork.  The ribs had a rub and were served dry not wet.  They were not fall off the bone tender as we like them.  In our rating system this would get 1  for bbq.  That being said, if you just rated on quality of food and service, with bbq expectations aside, the rating goes up.  The food was good quality and tasted good and all the employees on the line were very friendly."}
{"text":"My family was in town, and my dad being a DDD fan, we had to try this place. It's in a residential area, so the drive there was a little strange, but that was soon replaced by great food. We got chicken, hot links, brisket and pulled pork with sides. The macaroni and cheese is the BOMB! I'm not a huge fan of bbq sauce, but I really liked the one they put on their meats. I had the hot link and it was delicious and spicy, but not too hot. The people that work there are fantastic and have great charisma and customer service. We visited the meat shop while were there and their products in there are just as good as their bbq outside. My husband and I will definitely return for more!"}
{"text":"One of the best BBQ I've ever had in the States.  We've been hearing about this joint and we've seen it on DDD (Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives on the Food Network), so we decided to check it out! Very friendly staff! Great customer service and the amount of food is enormous.  I must admit they were a bit pricey, but you get what you pay for.  Like I said, they amount of food you're given is alot.  You'll always have some left overs to take home, that's if you're not starving.  The BBQ is always juicy and flavorful.  Did I mention that they have the best Mac & Cheese I have ever had in my whole entire existence?  Then there's those heaven made baked beans (ahhhhhh)! Yes! Yes! YES!!!!!!  This place is a must! Go there........ NOW!"}
{"text":"slower than fucking molasses up in here..it's usually a bit faster in and out but who knows.."}
{"text":"Fouth of July Weekend and the place is packed. ..you know the secret is out when the line is out the door at 10:00 am.  Love that John Mulls!"}
{"text":"This was a fun little restaurant. The food was great. The mac & cheese was the bomb and I would highly recommend this restaurant to everybody. The pulled pork was really delicious and so was the Quarter chicken."}
{"text":"I saw this place on the food networks with guy fieri and thought I would give it a chance. It's about 20 min from the strip but thought it would be worth the drive. When you pull up the place smells amazing I was excited to try everything. The staff was super nice and courteous so my 1 star is on the food the staff gets 5.     I ordered the tri tip, ribs , pulled pork , chicken and a couple sides. I was expecting fall off the bone quality ribs with tons of flavor but what I got was a dry rib that wasn't good at all. The tri tip was tender but lacked flavor, pulled pork was my favorite and the cornbread. I don't know if guy fieri got there best ribs that day but mine didn't look or taste good."}
{"text":"Been here in Vegas for 3 yrs(originally from L.A.) and finally found a good butcher, this place is hard to find you will miss it driving by. Walked in front door and bumped someone on the other side was bumping elbows with customers. Awesome place person at counter takes your order and behind them is some guy cutting your meat. Real friendly staff while I was waiting for my cut they busted out a block of Colby cheese and sliced about 2 lbs to give to all of us customers to try wife and I bought 3 lbs of the stuff. I bought 2 tri-tip roasts, good cut of meat good fat amount took home and grilled Santa Maria style. I will be coming back for sure. I love to smoke meat will be getting my ribs both pork & beef, pork butt, & other meats, next time I go back will be getting a 14 lbs brisket. Forgot, prices are real competitive with super markets around town"}
{"text":"No need for a lengthy review.  Freaking outstanding!  Get the Mac and cheese, and an extra cornbread!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Highly recommended for great BBQ in Las Vegas. I waited in line for a lunch special, and was talked to like they knew me. A tight space with a lot of people, but for sure worth it. All their food from meats down to sides were delicious.  I also stood in line to get some meat from the butcher. Great prices for very nice cuts of meats. I have been going there for about three months now, here and there for my cuts of meat and BBQ. If I could give it more stars I would."}
{"text":"This is a very unique place. Yet it was so good. I ordered the ribs, brisket, Mac n cheese and green beans. The ribs where my favorite. The mac n cheese was very good too. My husband got the ribs, pulled chicken, Mac n cheese and Mac salad. I tasted the pulled chicken I thought it was average. Nothing special. But the ribs are the bomb!! The staff was super nice and friendly. When in Vegas go try this place."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better BBQ spots in Vegas which isn't saying much because Vegas does not have much of a BBQ scene.  As you drive down Thorn Blvd, you'll think you made a wrong turn but as your turn into the place you'll find a small ranch which provides a great atmosphere to your bbq eating experience.  You place your order and then walk to the BBQ station where they fill your orders...very cool.   I like the small bench setups....feels very Rudy's like (if you're from Texas)     The portions are very hearty.   I shared a 3 meat combo which consisted of 2 orders of ribs, pulled pork, mac n cheese, and green beans.   The pulled pork was pretty dissapointing - very sweet and tasted like rou song (taiwanese dried pork that you put on top of rice).   The star of the show is definitely the ribs.   Excellent flavor and very tasty with the spicy bbq sauce.   The texture was perfect and had the perfect bite....not tough and over cooked.   I prefer a little more char smokiness but overall taste and flavor was delish.  I hope to come back to try their Trip Tip, brisket, and bbq chicken.  The mac n cheese was really good.  Green beans pretty soggy but good flavor.    It's a very neat place and if i would definitely make the trek up for their ribs.  Be sure to check out the meat market next door to get some electic meats!"}
{"text":"Employees of the Road Kill Cafe were making ribs at the harley davidson store today and called me an asshole for how i parked. I had my young family with me and it wasn't helpful or appreciated."}
{"text":"Awesome place. The staff is super friendly and passionate about what they do. The food is killer and the atmosphere is perfect for barbecue; the place feels outdoorsy and has tremendous personality. Coming from a chef and restaurant manager, the behind the scenes is super clean and professionally run. (We got the tour because restaurant people bad together.) I loved that they broke down entire carcasses to make the pulled pork and brisket. Totally legit.  Richie and Chuck were the highlights of our visit. Richie was hilarious and friendly as hell, love seeing a fellow New Yorker around. Chuck struck up conversation quick and definitely made you feel at home. Anyone visiting Vegas must make the trip out to this place. I promise you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I love this place! I saw this featured at Food Network and me and my Fam decided to visit the place. Love the pork ribs soooo good! Definitely the best ribs in town."}
{"text":"We have been going to this place for meat for a couple of years and they have a great product.  Today we tried the Road Kill Grill and the BBQ was out of this world good.  The meat so moist, juicy and tender with an awesome flavor.  My husband and I tried the sausage links, pulled pork, pulled chicken and the brisket.  Our sides were the mac and cheese and green beans.  The beans were slightly over cooked but had a really good flavor.  The ambiance of wild west Nevada ranch is awesome.  It was very fair weather today so we ate outside at one of the picnic tables.  The staff in the butcher area and at the Road Kill Grill are extremely friendly, upbeat and helpful.  The portions sizes are huge and I ended up bringing home more than half of my meal."}

{"text":"John Mull's Meats is the premier butcher shop in Las Vegas. My family has been buying meat from John Mull's for over 40 years and the quality and customer service have always been top-notch. Chuck Frommer is a 2nd generation butcher and owner following his father and an uncle keeping the shop as a family run business since 1955. This certainly speaks to the consistent product quality John Mull's turns out. Chuck is on the premises everyday working in the shop as is his wife, making sure their customers are getting the best of service.      A lot of folks are gun-shy when it comes to purchasing meat from a butcher shop as opposed to the grocery store because they think the prices are going to be substantially higher. This is not the case at John Mull's. The prices at Mull's are very competitive with those at the supermarket and the quality of the meat and poultry is head and shoulders above the grocery stores meat. Checkout their website and you can compare the prices to what you find at your neighborhood store. John Mull's is also a game processing facility where hunters have been bringing their deer, turkey and wild boar to be butcher for decades.    John Mull's is also home to the Roadkill Grill which was recently featured on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. That's another review I'll be doing but this does give you the opportunity to try John Mull's meats as a finished product so you can immediately taste the quality of their cuts."}
{"text":"This place is in a residential area, when map quest said you arrived at your destination we were surprised. You could smell the BBQ right when you step out the car.  We got here right when they were about to close, when we come back we are going to come a lot earlier. Something tells me my four star will turn into a five star.   The staff was super friendly they gave out free waters. While we waited. Because they were about to close we got the last of the rib tips,  ribs & Mac and cheese etc. everything still tasted great. But not as fresh as I would like. For instance the potato salad I prefer to eat cold which I hope the second time we go, it will be if not I'll pass . The corn bread was so good I could eat a dozen of those. Also bonus if you are taking your meal To go there is a bag station where you can grab fork napkins and You could take extra bbq sauce mild or hot I personally love the mild sauce.  I almost don't want to critique on the freshness of the food or the quality considering we were one of the last customers. We look forward to our next trip , So to be continued.."}
{"text":"this place is amazing the food was incredible i ordered the chicken with bakes beans and corn bread. the chicken was perfectly cooked the corn bread was so good didnt even need butter. if your in the neighborhood definately highly recommend you stop by."}
{"text":"This is absolutely the best meat in town and the restaurant mmmm so good!  This place rocks and the employees are so friendly like family!  Thank you for being so wonderful! If you haven't tried it you better!"}
{"text":"So you think that you've had the very best BBQ in Las Vegas? Uh...nope! Prepare for your mind to be blown and your taste buds to be rocked! Road Kill Grill!  First off, when GPS nav'd us to the Thom location,  I thought for sure that \"she\" had finally given in to the stress of her job! This place is in the middle of a neighborhood, but don't be alarmed... you are in the right place. Pull into the lot, disembark from the ChalGal, and the aroma. You know that sweet smell of summer that you get from someone else's backyard that prompts you to BBQ? Yep... we were in the right place! If I was still in real estate,  I would promote the heck out of that neighborhood! Navigate our way to a plain door,  no neon lights,  no real sign... just people standing in line - salivating,  quietly in anticipation! Not knowing the haps, I'm thinking that someone comes out to get you and escorts you somewhere else? Uh no... the door opens and this small-ish area is filled with people! Butcher counter, food counter, sweet lady taking orders, a room filled with excitement!  We had already perused the menu (black diamond difficult choices), so knew what we wanted... then promptly changed our mind when we saw the pork ribs! It's a swine thing, I told ya! Staff was friendly, ordering was easy,  really the whole process was easy... until we waited mere minutes for our order! Time dragged... Pay and take our food out to a covered area with patio heaters. Dig in... First off, pleasantly pleased to see the corn muffin is a muffin top only! WTG RKG! Next, I cannot take a bite of the Briscuit Sandwich because there is too much sliced deliciousness on that soft roll. Fingers... meat... sauce - have to try it, sauce is totally unnecessary. Mind blown! Oh... and that sauce, by the way. This is no watered down, thin BBQ sauce. This sauce has structure,  it coats the back of the spoon. Not super sweet, just enough. It would be good on almost anything, but really unnecessary for the meat!  Next on to the pork ribs! These are not fatty and greasy,  these are meaty and have an amazing rich density to them. Make sense? Again,  no sauce needed.  Same for the pulled Pork, whatever the method... it is perfection!  Mac n Cheese - cheesy and hearty,  Yams were perfectly cooked and seasoned (nothing worse than \"baby food\" yams!  The Cobblers! I ordered dessert at the register. The gal goes to serve it, directly from the double door stand up \"hot box\" right behind her! Biggest pans of flaky-sugary crusted,  fruity,  bubbly goodness I had ever seen (oh my God, Becky, did you see the size of that Cobbler?) Everything about this meal was superb,  including the fact that we had plenty for a late night, post-casino-hopping dinner... and I do mean PLENTY! Bookmark this one, add it to the itinerary....You're welcome!  Oh,  and when the chef comes through with chafing trays of food (mac n cheese, sliced Briscuit, cobbler, BBQ chicken, etc...) tell him \"Thank You\"! You will get one of the biggest smiles - one of those ear-to-ear ones...and tell him \"Hi! from Sunshine\"."}
{"text":"My boss brought me here for lunch last week. And boy am I glad. This place has the best BBQ I have ever had.. place itself isn't much. But u come here for the food not the decor. The ribs were amazing and the hot links were killer. Try their Mac n cheese u won't regret it. And don't forget the corn bread just ridiculous how good it is."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in vegas ! Great bbq.Can't go wrong with anything u order , I have tried it all n its all amazing.  I also always get 2 filet 2 go from there butcher side there products are well priced and of great quality. I drive all the way from anthem to go there , its worth the drive."}
{"text":"Excellent place to please your craving for BBQ. I love the hot links, brisket, tri-tip (served only on tue and thurs), mac n cheese, baked beens and corn bread. You can place your food order over the phone from monday to friday. Saturdays you have to stand in line but it is always worth it. Their staff are very friendly and polite. They have free bottles of water while you wait. They also have live music on saturdays if you want to stay and eat there. I recommend this place."}
{"text":"I found out about John Mull's from Diner, Drive In's and Dives...it is now our go to BBQ place. Their cornbread is the best I have ever had and always tell people to get an extra like we do. When people visit or want to try a new BBQ place this is my first recommendation. There meat is always full of flavor, sides are super tasty and I haven't had anything I haven't loved!"}
{"text":"The search for amazing BBQ in Las Vegas is now ended as Road Kill Cafe is now over.    Don't be afraid from the look of the building.  Inside there is a cafeteria style line for your cooked order and also a butcher counter where you can pick up meats of all types.  This also can be ordered over the phone and by internet.    The cooked dinners are served in to go containers.  Dinners include a massive amount of meat and two sides.  As I love some soul food, I ordered collard greens and yams with my tender brisket.  YUM!   Secret menu item to be ordered about 1/2 day ahead: Smoked Beef Ribs.  As any lover of these knows, impossible to find on any menu.   There are picnic tables outside if you want to eat there.  It was 107 degrees the day we went so it all came home.    For 3 full dinners and some extra items we could not resist was $45.  Every dinner was enough for 2 meals.  Guy Fieri was there with his Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives show.  A very worthy location to choose.  We also asked to see the smokers which had some lovely chicken and beef cooking slowly for their guests.  Again, YUM!  Be prepared to wait in line but your faste buds will thank you!"}
{"text":"We visited John Mulls yesterday and the food is really good. The ribs are very tender and moist. This place doesn't disappoint. When you arrive, expect to be in line for about 45min to a 1hr. If it is a hot day, it will feel like it is longer.  I am not sure how it is on weekdays, but on a Saturday we were in line for about this amount of time.   The best things to order are the ribs, rib tips, brisket, and hot links. The meat is delicious and one of the Best in Vegas. If you are looking for some good home-cooked bbq, please visit this place, you will not be disappointed. It will be well worth the drive.   The location of this place is closest to Gowan and Thom which is basically near Craig Rd and Decatur, that is in the northwest area of the valley. You will know when you are there when you see a bunch of cars parked on the ranch. They have tables outside where you can eat and chill too.   However, if you order the chicken, order an additional meat or get the 2-3 meat combo because the chicken is on the small side for the amount of money you are paying. If you are trying to share a meal, or want to have leftovers, you will need to pair the chicken with another meat to do so. Moreover, if you get the brisket and rib tips combo, it will be enough for two or three days and it will also be more than enough to share with others.   The side dishes are plentiful when you get them with the combo plate. If you want additional sides, they are very small and a bit over priced. Even though this place is pricey, the food quality does average this out.   Overall, I give this place 4.5 stars because it is a good place to go for home cooked meals. Staff is nice and friendly. Very relaxed environment and family-oriented atmosphere."}
{"text":"Simply the best! The butcher shop has the best meat prices in town and the mac n cheese is a gift from Heaven"}
{"text":"This place is by far the BEST bbq joint in town!! My family and I went on a Saturday, they were pretty busy so expect to wait in line for about a half hour to 45 minutes, normally that would be a deal breaker but we ended up waiting and we are so happy we did! The food was amazing. From the ribs to the baked beans and everything in between. We pretty much tried most of what was on the menu ( it's a small menu) we loved everything but the peach cobbler. It wasn't great.  They also have a market where you can buy their meat. We are definitely making this place our go to for bbq!"}
{"text":"OK, NEVER, NEVER GO HERE ON THE 1st OF THE MONTH!  I made the fatal mistake of going yesterday to pickup a small amount of meat for a BBQ on Labor Day.  When I drove up I noticed so many people outside just sitting around. and I thought maybe they were there to eat, a party maybe?  When I got the door open the place was jammed, and I do mean jammed packed!  I should have left right then and there!  But being a die hard fan of John Mull's I decided with what I needed shouldn't take too long.  What I didn't know was that all these people were getting a month's supply of meat because on the first of the month the food stamps come through.  Dumb me thought they were just getting meat for Labor Day parties!  The orders everyone were placing were HUGE, and each order needed the meat cut, wrapped and boxed.  Some people said they had been there for over 4 hours!  Now, their meat is good, but to stand around in the heat for hours, it's not that good!  I thought how long could my measly order take?  So I waited, slid, and pushed my way to the counter.  Why they don't have a TAKE A NUMBER system I have no idea, but they sure could use one.    Anyway, when I placed my order instead of just wrapping the meat and letting me pay for it,  she wrote down my order of 2 items and put it in the pile with the rest of the huge meat orders.  I decided to get some sides to go with the meat so shouldered my way to the \"hot plate\" side of the room and got some potato salad, beans, and mac and cheese.  THEIR SIDES ARE AMAZING!  I proceeded to wait about another hour and finally said I'm outta here because that's a long enough wait for anything and I have a hard time standing with these legs!  The staff was working as fast as they could go, people waiting were really nice about the situation, but it still didn't help the fact that I couldn't stand there with my potato salad in one hand and my cane in the other!  Will I go back to John Mull's?  You better believe it - just never, never on the first of the month!"}
{"text":"The staff here are the nicest people ever!!  The prices are excellent.  The BBQ, heavenly.  I got there late.  They close at 6pm and we got there at 5:45 pm and there was still a huge line.  OMG - it smelled SO good.  At around 6pm, they announced that they were out of ribs and it would take another 20 minutes and if anyone wanted to change their order, it was no problem.  For the people that waited, they gave use a ton of rib tips (seriously, they handed me a box of rib tips - AWESOME!!).  Since it was so late, I wasn't able to check out the meat market, but I know I'll be back.  Geez, I'm getting hungry just writing this... I ordered:   Three meat combo with:  Brisket Ribs Rib tips Mac & cheese Cornbread  One combo for two people and we still had leftovers the next day.  Normally a \"combo\" is one box/one meal.  We got three full size takeout boxes and a half box of rib tips (for waiting).  Everything was cooked perfectly.  I really liked their Mac & Cheese and we got two sides of it.  Ha! Their hot sauce is really good as well.  The HOT is pretty hot.  I normally love spicy, but I had to use the regular...    Ok, now I've gotta look on Yelp to see about a BBQ place near me for lunch.  LOL"}
{"text":"When you want BBQ, this is the place.... Fast and quick service.  Good place to take the family  Once a year they even have a customer appreciation day where they give out free food!!"}
{"text":"Yummy to my tummy everytime and the people who work there are awesome with great customer service"}
{"text":"We ate here and enjoyed the food. I had the 3 meat combo consisting of hotlinks, rib tips and pulled pork. Loved the hotlinks and pulled pork. The rib tips were dry and over cooked though.  I wish they will add garlic flavor to their rub. The one that I like the most is their siding. I do t like beans but their baked beans are to die for. Loved the Mac n cheese too. For pet lovers, It's pet friendly as well."}
{"text":"Been looking for good BBQ here in the Vegas area. Tried this place last week and wow, I am a fan. One star off due to sitting outside with 100+ temps. It's worth the 25 min. drive from Henderson.  Not knowing the HUGE portions I ordered a 3 meat combo. Two sides come with it.  I got the brisket, ribs, and pulled pork. Sides were mac n cheese and green beans.  Ribs pulled off the bone, needed the bbq sauce provided at no charge. Pulled Pork was tasty, and the brisket seemed to be stored in a broth. odd..... I did love the mac n cheese, and the green beans seem to be out of a can? Served with a potato chunk. Got the apple cobbler and will try the peach cobbler next time.  YES there will be a next time. Will go on a tues or thurs so I can get the tri-tips."}
{"text":"Loved the country bbq feel to this place. Food was the best bbq ive had in Vegas. Pulled pork was tender and juicy. Been back 5 times already."}
{"text":"What a great place! What BBQ should be!   There are only a small handful of good BBQ joints in vegas, and this is one of them. Get there early to miss the lunch line and don't leave without the pork, spicy sausage, ribs - hell - everything on their menu.   I get my cold cuts there too. If I had four hands I would give it four thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Wow.  Great BBQ.  My first time there, and did not expect it to be smack in the middle of a residential neighborhood.  For the lunch rush, they had a long line of people.  A little bit of a wait as they were very busy.  Took the food back to the office, and couldn't wait to try my tri-tip dinner with green beans, baked beans (they add ground beef to the beans!), and cornbread.  They offered spicy or regular BBQ sauce...I opted for the delicious spicy.  All I can say is that if you want BBQ, you gotta check out this place!"}
{"text":"What a great value!!! The staff are wonderful and always friendly. The food is beyond delicious and everything I have tasted from this hidden heaven has been yummy. Great value as well. I have also heard great reviews about the butchery end of the business."}
{"text":"Mac and cheese, Mac and cheese, Mac and cheese, Mac and cheese, Mac and cheese.  This place is deeeeeeeliiiiiiisssssshhhhhh.  We come here everytime we go to Vegas.  It's about a 15 minute drive off the strip but it's worth it.  Homecooked BBQ - brisket, pulled pork, rib, tri-tip....  MMMMMMMMMMM.  I usually get the 2 meat plate with either ribs or rib tips and pulled chicken.  This comes with 2 sides, but I usually make both of my sides mac and cheese.  Why?  Because it's momma slappin' delicious!    If you want something different that the normal fare while on the strip in Vegas, then head here!"}
{"text":"I found them on a whim and needless to say... it was a great find. I like their food SO much we had them cater our Christmas party."}
{"text":"We recently came here for the first time, and the food was out of this world.  I had the brisket and ribs and they were both great.  For sides, I had the mac and cheese, and it is one of the best I have ever had.  Nice big tender noodles and great cheese with lots of good flavor.  Will definitely be coming back here many more times."}
{"text":"Good food as usual.  Ribs were different that normal, baby backs instead of spare ribs.  Smaller and less meat but good non the less.  Sides were also good, mac and potato salad.  Friends had mac and cheese, beans and coleslaw all good."}
{"text":"OMG! one if the BEST BBQ joints I have been to! A little off the beat & path but the GPS did not let us down, nor did the food. A no frills place....granted service was a little slow but well worth the wait! The Mac and cheese was out of this world! Definitely a do over when in town again!!"}
{"text":"We were in the area at a kid's baseball tournament on Veteran's day. The plates of food are HUGE. My husband and I shared a two-meat plate with burnt ends and a hot link w sides of Mac & cheese and collard's. Everything we had was really good. We were with a big group and also tried the pulled chicken (very moist and tasty), yams (mildly sweet and cinnamony). We didn't try the bean's but others in our group did and said they were delicious. Together burnt ends were still moist and tender, and he hot link was one of the best I ever had.   Normally when you go to a bbq place there are hit and miss on their items, especially on their sides. But this place everything everyone got was a hit. No one was disappointed with anything. The only thing I'll say is that they use a lot of black pepper - so if you don't like that you may not enjoy it as much as others. I could taste it most in the mac & cheese and hot link. But no one we were with minded it.   Also - Veteran's meals were free for Veteran's Day. Since both my sister and brother in law were vet's this was a really nice surprise."}
{"text":"Great BBQ here, you gotta try the bake beans and Mac n cheese. There is always a long line so expect to wait 20 min to get your food. They always give Samples while you wait do it makes up for the long line. I will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Wow! What a great experience, it was like a backyard barbecue. Everybody was friendly!It was like a get together in the Midwest. I saw this place on the food network show and then wanted to try it out, so one day I was craving barbecue and I thought I would give it a try.  I really had no expectations but this place just blew my mind!  I went on a Saturday afternoon and they were having an outdoor barbecue with picnic tables and free beer. The line was huge but is well worth the wait. Definitely go on the weekend."}
{"text":"So glad we found this place its awesome. We used them to cater our baby shower and everything was phenomenal. We got 20lbs of cooked BBQ for less than $100. What a steal. We well definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here most weekends for the BBQ restaurant and we never get sick of it. It is worth the wait, seriously. The hot links are my favorite along with the ribs, definitely try their mac and cheese because its the most authentic mac and cheese I've ever had. The customer service alone is enough for 5 stars, everyone greets you and is so incredibly friendly. You see them serving your order and actually grilling. Its feels like you're at a family BBQ, and if the line is too long they offer everyone bottled water to stay cool FREE OF CHARGE. That's a genuine gesture and that's why I love coming here- because everyone is so friendly.   I cant ever get enough of this place, and let me just throw out there that my boyfriend is INCREDIBLY picky about food and this is his all time favorite place to go. Definitely worth giving a try  Btw, their spicy bbq sauce is LIFE."}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ, had the ribs, hot links and the pulled pork, you can't beat a butcher shop with a BBQ pit next to it, the sauce was awesome, the meat was smoky and the rub made it over the top amazing."}
{"text":"Lived in Vegas for years. Finally went and tried it with my wife. The food was amazing! Best BBQ I've had and I've traveled a lot! A lot of food for the price!! We had a little of almost everything and was not let down at all!!The people there are VERY nice as well!! I'd recommend it to anyone! I'll go back for sure! Weather you live in Vegas or out of town you have to try it!!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ ever the Brisket was my favorite. Good atmosphere and Great Meat selection at the butcher shop."}
{"text":"Come for the food, stay for the experience.  Always go with the three meat platter, never disappoints.  Really hard to beat for a great lunch spot. The 'dining room' is all outdoors so visit befor the summer heat hits."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to go to John Mull's this afternoon for lunch. We have only been here once before, it was so good the first time we had to invite my mom and her husband. The first time we went it was during a week day. This time around it's Saturday! Oh my gosh the line was over 20 ppl deep! It took at least half hour to actually get our food! We decided to get the beef tips,with shredded chicken and they gave use two ribs on them. The sides we agreed on were, collard greens,macaroni and cheese and beans. BBQ sauce and corn bread comes with it. It was enough to feed two for 25bucks. Most definitely worth it! Not to mention how beautiful it was outside! Oh and don't let me forget, we even got a free sample of a rib they are testing the waters with while standing in line! I say go,go go!!!!"}
{"text":"What a great place!  Lots of good food and great, friendly service!  The chicken was so soft it fell off the bone!  Everything was delicious.  The best part though, had to be meeting the owner Chuck!  Wonderful!  I got so excited, forgot to take a pic of my food.  Suffice to say, they give a LOT, great tasting food!  A definite stop if you haven't been.  We are definitely going back."}
{"text":"Make sure you get there before 6pm.  What a find!  I have lived in Las Vegas for 12 years and have used John Mull's Meats for all of the food I cook at home.  Their prices are the same as a grocery store, but the quality is the best in Las Vegas.  I have been to many Las Vegas restaurants and have not found any steakhouse that serves a steak comparable to John Mull's.  I no longer go out to steakhouses because I can cook a higher quality, better tasting steak at home.  Ask for a whole prime filet mignon wrapped in a thin shaved layer of fat to cook on the grill.  The fat burns and flames, but it bastes the filet mignon as it cooks.  YUM! Cut the fat off, let it rest and serve medium rare.  What a treat!  Other meats we enjoy are pork chops, pork tenderloin, boneless or bone in chicken that tastes like fresh chicken, NY Strip, skirt, rib eye and porterhouse, to just name a few of our favorites.  Also they have homemade sausage that is awesome, free eggs with butcher orders over 50 or 100 bucks (we always get the eggs; they are farm fresh and delicious).  We use their ground beef for everything from tacos to burgers; really good freshly made ground beef.  That's just the butcher shop.  They also have a BBQ pit that serves awesome BBQ ribs, pulled pork, shredded chicken, the homemade sausages, beans to die for, peach cobbler, etc.  This place is part of our lives and is tucked away in a residential community that grew up around it.  For years John Mull's was alone in the north valley.  Chuck Fromm now operates it and I think he is the third generation to man the meats.  He is such a nice guy and will prepare ANYTHING to your taste.  We love Chuck Fromm and John Mull's Meats and the Road Kill Grill!"}
{"text":"Love to get the 3 meat combo ribs, rib tips,pulled pork and brisket are delicious. Chicken is okay and wasn't impressed with coleslaw but everything else is very GOOD"}
{"text":"Delish! A bit small inside..does not help when it's warm as well. But friendly staff and pretty quick service! Amazing Mac and cheese...I love it! Everything else is very good but the Mac and cheese is so tasty!"}
{"text":"Best customer service. Everyone in there was nice. They give you samples as you wait. Portions are a good size and the food is good. This was my first time there and I will be going back."}
{"text":"This place has great food but are extremely inefficient when it comes to service. The food here isn't made to order yet, the workers taking orders are walking around like they don't want to be here. Expect to wait about 45 mins just to order. Once you order its about another 45 to an hour. Anyone that has any common sense on how to run a business would find this mind blowing, but guess that's what happens when people see this place on DDD. Again the food is good but this is a sincere disappointment"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Bar-B-Q joint Good food and when I want to come and get some \"Chicken Patties\" for my wife and I this is the place"}
{"text":"Apparently John Mull didn't pay attention to the old adage \"location, location, location\" and if this place was judged solely on first impressions they may be in trouble. Located near Rancho and Gowan, smack dab in the middle of a residential neighborhood, the Road Kill Grill had me wondering as we rolled up into the dirt/rock driveway. It seemed as though I was thrust into the middle of  some sort of unsolved murder/mystery documentary. It just didn't seem right. Are they really going to serve us \"road kill?\" is the thought that kept running through my mind.  Just as we approached and entered, thoughts of normalcy began to take over again, that is until I spotted the stuffed coyote inside the meat shop/restaurant. I was with a group of people and couldn't let my fears get the worst of me and just run out. Besides, I didn't think I'd be able to find my way back to the main road.   We were greeted by a very friendly, knowledgable man who briefed all of the \"Road Kill Virgins\" on what exactly it was we were getting ourselves into. It's \"Tri-Tip day\" he exclaims. Okay, now I'm interested. As he's taking orders, I'm looking at the menu, but have pretty much decided on the Tri-Tip. My buddy orders a three meat combo. Not to be outdone when it comes to grub, I order three meats as well. Tri-Tip, Hot Links and Brisket with cole slaw and good 'ol mac n cheese. It was like I'd died and gone to a pic-nic in Heaven. The Tri-Tip was some of the best I've ever had the pleasure of consuming and the mac n cheese was some kind of tasty. The hot links were sliced up and smothered in bbq sauce and the coleslaw could almost compete with grandma's  (nothing ever will, but their's was pretty darn good).  The only thing that would have made the meal better would have been a huge glass of iced tea with lots of ice. The draw back here is that it's bottled water or canned soda, that's it. But hey, a regular showed up with a cooler full of his favorite beverage and nobody batted an eye. There is no inside seating, so good weather is vital. Or better yet, just grab it to go and take it home. It does travel well, too, as we couldn't finish it all and took some back for a co-worker. He was impressed as well.   Not that they would have to twist my arm to come back, but they offer free beer on Saturday. Maybe I have died and gone to a bbq in Heaven."}
{"text":"Pretty good BBQ. This place is right in the middle of a residential neighborhood. They have all the usual menu items that you'd expect a BBQ place to have. The hot links in particular are pretty good. Check out the butcher shop if you have a chance. Great cuts to be had."}
{"text":"At Road Kill Grill featured on Diners Drive-Ins and Dives.  Excellent food!  Even got the Tour from my friend Richie who is from NYC.  5 Stars!!!!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to go for a while. Decided to go on a Saturday afternoon. Waited in line for hour plus during which I'm thinking there has to be a better and faster way to move these people through the line. Got the order to go. On drive home was saying this better be good to justify me standing in line for so long. Got home and split up the two three piece combos between wife and son. It truly was the best bbq I have ever had. All three of us were blown away. How do they serve food this good just slopping it out of a portable bbq trailer? It really is incredible. Four stars just because I'm still a little miffed at having to wait so long. Food is absolutely 5+ stars."}
{"text":"Saw this restaurant on Food Network and decided to try it while out in Las Vegas on business...  Here we go:  Pro's: 1. Cool area to sit outside and enjoy your meal. 2. Relatively short wait for food 3. Extremely friendly and accommodating staff 4. Good tasty ribs,  5 Cornbread was awesome!   Cons: I . I am sure it is excellent brisket by Las Vegas standards.. Had no color, no bark, no smoke ring.. Not sure how it was cooked. 2. Pulled pork was blah..  I wish I could rave about this, it looks like the kind of place I would love..Sorry I can't ."}
{"text":"Love, love, love, love this place Best Q in Vegas no doubt!  Must stop for anybody in Vegas that wants some real cookin!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing Hidden Gem a great butcher shop and then a wonderful outside Roadkill Cafe the food at the road kill Cafe is amazing and the butcher has the best hotlinks ever besides being able to get almost any kind of meat you want cut to the way you want it perfection and let's not forget the friendliest staff ever"}
{"text":"Try a Lil bit of EVERTHING.  Share with family or friends"}
{"text":"The try tip (Tuesday/Thursday) is out of this world. Very tender, very flavorful, and an experience onto itself.  Order ahead or expect a 45 minute wait. This place is popular."}
{"text":"Visited the \"Road Kill Grill\", Great food and a great meat market. Met the owner Chuck, really nice guy and very helpful. Will go back next time I'm in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Kept hearing about this place and finally decided to give it a try. Everyone was so nice and helpful walking inside. Very easy set up and food was just simply delicious. I have found my new bbq place here in Vegas. Place is a bit hard to find but once you do, you will never forget it."}
{"text":"The food is great.  The way they process the customers in line is sorely lacking.   If you are hungry, pack your patience.   I was 10th in line and waited over 30 minutes.  The food is already cooked and the orders just needf to be packaged.  That's way too long to wait.  When you are waiting outside for room to become available in the building, make sure you get a order ticket or the apple cart is upset.  The girl writing out the order tickets outside, gave me a menu and never came back to me.  When I was able to enter the building I was asked 3 times if I stood in line.  Of course I waited in line.  I found that more than annoying.  I'll go back when I don't want to grill my own dinner.  My BBQ is off the hook but iit's time I don't necessarily have.   Hope they get the kinks worked out in their customer service because the food is very good."}
{"text":"Outstanding BBQ. Ribs, brisket, hot links all fantastic. The sides were great. I had macaroni cheese and the beans. Beans were some of the best I've ever had. Chuck gave us a tour of the facility. We learned out they bbq their meats. Very interesting. Not what I expected. They make their own spices there."}
{"text":"Yum a dee dum! Hidden in a residential neighborhood this feels like bbq at a big backyard party. Staff were all friendly, food was yummy. Ribs were our fav along with the cobbler if you can believe it. Corn bread is more sweet and cake like, the cut-up hot links are in a bbq sauce. Get there early because you might find yourself in a line. You get a choice of reg. or hot bbq sauce, both of which I found a bit sweet, but still good. The eating area is outside on picnic tables, and yes there is a nice breezing that goes by and it is covered, but the wind likes to take your plastic covers and bags away with it. *Tip - the 3 meat combo was enough for 2 people and we had left overs."}
{"text":"Had a pulled pork and brisket combo! Enough food for probably 3 meals!  I had potato salad and the best baked beans I've ever eaten.  Service is slow but worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Finally made it to John Mull's Meats and now I'm mad because all the other times I thought about coming, we didn't. The food was excellent and the portions were huge. The sides were perfect size too. I tried the 3 meat combo and I wish they had a 6 meat combo, I woulda got that! A must do when in Vegas! Prob the best BBQ in town!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is a small kitchen and butcher shop, with outdoor picnic tables, but the taste is outstanding - ordered hot links and briscuit, beans and baked beans, and hot BBQ sauce.  The highlight was the hot link - a juicy spicy polish sausage like you'd find in Buffalo's Polishtown - with a kick.  It was a hot windy day and our stuff kept blowing all over - the shop is nestled in a semi urban neighborhood - strange location - but all in all - delicious."}
{"text":"Wow! What an experience! Saw this place on the food network and decided to go check it out. It was like a backyard barbecue with picnic tables, friendly people, and free beer on Saturdays. Probably one of the best barbecue places in town. It's very family friendly place to go eat on the weekends, you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"We love to eat at this restaurant. Their barbecue meats are great I like to go to this place with my family. Everyone likes it."}
{"text":"Amazingly friendly staff, great service! Easily the best barbecue in Vegas! Can't wait to go back for more."}
{"text":"Been here approximately 4 times...very friendly & the assortment of meats well organized & to top it off they vacuum pak the meats as well. That is a great gesture that separates them from the other Butcher shops around town."}
{"text":"Yum.  I love ribs!!!  Like the outdoor only bench seats - you get to have a laugh w/total strangers and get messy w/food!!!"}
{"text":"Only thing is hours and location but the food is excellent and pricing is fair.  Also fresh butcher with meat selections that are truly out of this world.  I highly recommend the Mac and cheese they out a lot of different kinds of cheese and also the Mac salad and potato salad are amazing.  All the meat is very fresh and a lot of different choices or combos!!"}
{"text":"Awesome service! Best brisket and pulled chicken! Best bbq in Vegas....got to come and get some. A great day to spend on Memorial Day! Excellent apple cobbler. Great staff 5 out of 5 for customer service and food!"}
{"text":"Couldn't go to the original location so tried Road Kill Grill's second location at the CC Gun range during a recent visit to LV. he second location is a ways out there but worth the time and drive since we were visiting and really wanted to check it out. Three of us ordered a bunch of stuff so we could try it all out: chicken wings, ribs, brisket, pulled pork, hot links, beans, slaw and mac n cheese. Ribs were lean and meaty but a little dry, hot link was very good, pulled pork was plentiful and flavorful but a little dried out, chicken wings were tasty and meaty, but the brisket was underwhelming. Sides were all very good. Loved the beans and mac n cheese. Service was good.  Overall, the food was good but I wouldn't say great. Our impression was that it was due to it being a second location and probably not cooked on site. Might have dried out a bit on the trip from the original location. Definitely want to go to the main location and give it another try."}
{"text":"We read about on DDD decided to try out on a visit to see our son. It was more then we hoped for. We as a family had all the meats and sides and desserts. No complaints at all. Everything was impeccable. A lil far from the strip. But worth the trip."}
{"text":"OMG..this is one of those experiences that isn't supposed to make sense! Boiled ribs noo way! But John Mull's staff especially Chuck the owner have found the secret to great BBQ! It is worth the drive from Henderson! Not to mention there is the best butcher shop ever located there also, quality meats, great atmosphere, wonderful people!!! Rock on!"}
{"text":"Top notch meats, flavor was great! I had a pulled chicken sandwich, and that was really good to the point where you just wanna keep on biting into the flavorful sandwich without breathing! Lol I also had some baked beans and they were unlike any other beans I had had before, either A) I don't have them that often or B) they were interestingly good!    The reason for four stars instead of five was because I come from a family of hardcore grillers and when I tried a rib to see how it was in comparison... it wasn't. But hey the pulled chicken sandwich was killer and those beans  I also snagged a crum of corn bread and some macaroni salad and those were really good too.   If you have never been there I say go, it's a cool spot, not a place you're used to seeing everyday"}
{"text":"Wow, we came to the roadkill grill for the ribs and rib tips but we walked away falling in love with the beef brisket.  So juicy so tender.  Got a two and a three meat meal hoping that we would be able to take some home but my family polished it all off!!"}
{"text":"I seen this on Diners Drive-Ins & Dives!!! Hands down the best BBQ in Vegas!I would recommend this place to anyone visiting looking for some good ol' down home BBQ! Only thing the Mac N Cheese was very disappointing due to the fact they use sour cream! Gross!"}
{"text":"My fav spot to get BBQ! The best in Las Vegas! Also if you want fresh meat this is the place to go! Great customer service from Chris and the whole staff everytime I come."}
{"text":"you aint had bbq in vegas if its not john mulls and road kill grill.  Rhe meat is on point the sides are great and the customers service is excellent."}
{"text":"WOW!  This place is great.  The portions are large and everything is delicious.  They have the best baked beans I've ever eaten.  The hot links are fantastic & the brisket is very tender.  I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been by John Mull's Meats & Road Kill Grill in over a year and was craving some chicken, so I decoded to brave the lunch crowd for a cure. This place is in a residential neighborhood which surprises some, but I'm used to it from growing up in the neighborhood. I came here long before the Road Kill Grill opened when we would bring the deer my dad brought back from hunting each year here for processing. There is a decent sized dirt lot for parking, but just know that depending on the time of day you stop by might depend on you getting a spot or not. When I pulled into the lot this last visit, I was the only car and literally every single car that was behind me pulled in and there was no parking spots just that fast. That meant the line inside was going to get long fast, so I picked up my pace and headed in. I was greeted with a welcoming \"hello\" and then a girl came over and wrote down what I wanted. The guy behind the counter packed up my order and asked if I wanted any extra BBQ sauce. They have picnic tables in a couple areas outside if you want to eat out there or you can get your order to-go.   2 Meat Combo ($14.65) - I chose chicken and sliced hot links for the meats. All combos come with two sides and I chose baked beans and macaroni and cheese. For an additional $2.75 I also added a side of green beans. The chicken fell off the bone and had such a great taste! The chicken is worth coming here for alone and tasted just like I remembered. Chicken craving cured! I liked the sliced hot links, yum! I did like the BBQ sauce and liked that it was a sauce with actual flavor instead of just being overpowered by nasty vinegar. The macaroni and cheese here is hit or miss from what I have experienced and it's all about the texture that's different. There might be a time when the macaroni and cheese is creamy and oh so good and then there are times like my last visit where it's pasty and not so great. I enjoyed the baked beans however can do without whatever meat is in them. Bacon in the beans would be more what I'd prefer, but I have family and friends that love the baked beans just the way they are here. We all have our own tastes! The green beans were good and I liked the random pieces of pork mixed in. Oh yeah, you get to pick either a roll or corn bread to go with your meal. It's a lot of food and depending on your appetite it could easily be shared with someone. Just come by and try the chicken and thank me later :)"}
{"text":"The BBQ is incredible! The mac and cheese is heavenly! The food, coupled with the super friendly staff, make the long lines worth the wait! AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"A must visit for anybody in Las Vegas. Wild game processing (24/7 by the way!), cobbler second to none, general BBQ carry out. Custom cut steaks and much more. Go check it out. Would be 5 stars if not so expensive, but it's worth it occasionally, just not once a week."}
{"text":"Finally! I found my favorite BBQ spot in Vegas! Being from Memphis, I've been trying to find the right BBQ sauce and a place that bbqs their pulled pork shoulder correctly. They even have pulled chicken! Sometimes you just want to eat light. And the peach cobbler is to die for! This place is far from my house but I'm willing to drive for the best BBQ!"}
{"text":"Little hidden joint in the outskirts of Las Vegas, John Mull Meats is the best BBQ in town! Great for lunch, eat half, take the rest home for dinner. The burnt ends are my favorite, tender and flavorful; my husband's is the meaty succulent beef ribs. We also truly enjoyed everything else! They do great catering, as well, and it's reasonable , delicious,  and plenty of food@"}
{"text":"This is our go-to for a good bbq meal when I am in Vegas. (Or Famous Daves where the bf seems to enjoy more). It is kind of like a ranch in a residential neighborhood which charmed me! That, and the no nonsense service :-D as I am a no-nonsense kind of girl!   There is also a butcher shop to cater to our/your carnivorous cravings lol. We usually get hot links or a couple of ribeyes to bbq later. Always good.  The lines are always long. Whoever happens to be standing by the door has to stand holding it open lol.  There are picnic benches/tables outside.   I have always enjoyed coming here."}
{"text":"I have yet to have a bad meal at this place. The outdoor seating could be an issue when it's really hot out but I would probably suck it up."}
{"text":"My co-worker and I decided to order from here for our work luncheon after a unanimous vote from our team. So we came to place the order and it smelt so good, we had to buy lunch to try it out. OH MY GOD. We are so glad we did. Kim, Larry, and Delilah are some of the friendliest staff anywhere. They're personable and sweet. We came back 2 days in a row...and Kim remembered our orders! Although...there's a guy in the kitchen who was hating on my LA Kings Jersey...get rid of that one! lol.  In all seriousness...the food is PHENOMENAL, the service to top notch, and the outdoor seating is great even in the winter because they've got outdoor heaters. This is quickly turning into my favorite place to eat in Vegas.  Give it a try and see for yourself. If you like BBQ, you will love this place!"}
{"text":"Vastly over rated. They only get the third star because of portion size. Dry pulled pork slathered in a sweet sauce to mask the dryness. Dry brisket slathered in beef broth to hide the dryness. Possibly the most fattening mac and cheese on the planet. I think they use mayo. Potato salad was ok. Cornbread was way too sweet. This is unthought out bbq. Mistakes absorbed as knowledge. The old kind done by non-hipsters. The result is an inferior product redolent in every assertive element with no balance or subtly or excellence. This \"home cook\" level of bbq just doesn't cut it anymore. If they had options in LV maybe they wouldn't even have been on TV. And they are so slow filling orders. Hard to get to. Notice that everybody that loves this place has a common look (no frame of reference) and live in places that aren't known for bbq.. I live in the south. Ignore the Jersey thing. I was in Jersey when I signed up and they put that in. Didn't feel like changing it."}
{"text":"Love there cat fish.   It's frozen, so you have to cook it yourself. They don't have time to cater to you here.  Order what you need.  That's it!  But I love the cat fish and the hot links!  So I'm not complaining!"}
{"text":"Taste So Good Make You Want To Slap Your Mama!  I have to say my first impression of this place I thought that it was a little hole in the wall.  But once I had a taste of their BBQ I was impressed with the flavor and the size of the portion as well.  After enjoying my meal I  purchased their Hickory & Mesquite Rub from their store.  And I am glad that I did because I use it on just about everything like Beer Butt Chicken, etc.  To be honest you really wont be disappointed so see for yourself!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at many bbqs from KC to Atlanta up through the Carolinas.  I met Richy who was very proud to show me his smokers. I guarantee if I wasn't in a rush I would be helping in the next batch.  Don't ever think twice about going just go. Enjoy you will be stuffed."}
{"text":"Being from the South, its been hard for me to live without that good southern-style bbq until I came across John Mull's. The brisket is always so moist, the ribs are just fall-off-the-bone tender. The sides are full of flavor, if I close my eyes, it's almost like I'm back down South. Definitely my favorite place for BBQ in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with this place! Their corn bread, baked beans, and MAC n CHeese is so good!! My best friend and i love going here for Lunch, there is always a LONG line so call ahead order your food, go straight to the cash register and no waiting ! This is a must go t place, and everyone is so friendly, comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I've been toJM's , For Thanksgiving I had friends and family over for dinner and I didn't want to cook the turkey since I'm not a real fan of turkey so I ordered a smoked one from JMs.. OMG!! The turkey was the best ever... soooooo much flavor and super moist.. everyone loved it ... we picked it up Wednesday morning and the line for pick up was endless , no one seemed upset or anything cause they all knew it was worth the wait .... chances of me ever cooking a turkey again are slim to NONE!! Why???? When I can get the best tasting smoked turkey from JM's....."}
{"text":"John Mull's catered a BBQ for us at work today. My first time trying this place and I will definitely be making the trek to their restaurant.  -The meats we had to enjoy were the Brisket, Chicken, Hot links and Ribs.    The ribs and hot links stole the show for. Very flavor full, lick your fingers good!! -For the sides: Mach and cheese was legit but the baked beans stole the show. They has ground meat, bacon, jalapenos and other goodness.  Definitely a must try and a return to kind of place."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best BBQ in town thus far!!!  I'm never disappointed with my choices. I usually always order the two meat combo of brisket and rib tips, but sometimes I get gluttonous and get a three meat combo with hot links!!! I've pretty much had everything on the menu, so let me describe more in detail:  Brisket- tender, well seasoned, smokey,        juicy Rib tips- delicious! I eat the whole thing, cartilage and all! Pulled pork- flavorful and tender. Chicken- smokey and juicy Ribs- fall off the bone goodness!! Juicy and smokey. Hot links- spicy but not too crazy. Get them with out the sauce.  Potato salad- nothing too special but good nonetheless Mac n cheese- a lot of people love it, but I'm not too crazy about it. I personally don't like it with sour cream, but that's just me.  Green beans- flavorful and love that there's chunks of ham and potatoes.  Cole slaw- again, nothing special but still tastes good.  The sauces- there's mild and hot. I love them both, but I'm in love with the spicy BBQ!!! It has a nice kick to it!!  This place is usually busy with long lines, so come early. The wait isn't too bad as the food is served pretty fast. The staff is friendly and very generous with the portions. I usually like to get the 3 meat combo since it lasts for the following day. The prices are awesome too!!! It's also a butcher shop and they sell fresh eggs!!!  I'm just glad Vegas has a great BBQ joint like john mulls."}
{"text":"keep your eyes open! its not in a shopping strip...  it's a hidden jewel"}
{"text":"I have had the unique pleasure of dining at John Mull's Road Kill Grill for several years now and this past week I was lucky to be able to get there twice in one week.  I live about 559 miles away and it's a nine hour drive however it's worth it when I go to Las Vegas and I don't miss the opportunity.  This trip it was wintertime (January 19th) and although the wind was blowing and the temperature was rather chilly the Road Kill Grill had lighted heaters on the patio with covered seating and it was really toasty and comfortable.  The food is outstanding and both times this trip I had hot links, ribs and tri-tip with chili new on the menu as a side along with coleslaw and mac & cheese (not new, but excellent).  It's all terrific. The food is outstanding however it's the staff that makes you feel welcome and one of the family that puts the frosting on the cake (by the way the cornbread is wonderful and could actually be cake it's so good).  The people greeting you outside if there is a line, the cashier, the entire place is alive and fun to enjoy.  Each time even though it may be different staffers there it's always a fun time.  Thank you Road Kill Grill for the best time ever."}
{"text":"Wonderful stop!!! Owner kind enough to pose for a pic and staff incredibly nice!!! Food was incredible!!"}
{"text":"I was very impressed with he level of service despite how busy they were.  The long line went fast and the employees were attentive. The BBQ was damn good too. I also catered an event through them where they were absolutely amazing at working with me. I ordered the rib tips, peach cobbler and brisket...man oh man!"}
{"text":"So so so damn good, I can't wait to go back for more! The location is in a residential neighborhood which is a little weird but like I said the food is so damn good you don't care about the location."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time tonight, and all I can say is damn!  I arrived and the line was seriously long, but moved fast.  These guys have ordering down.  Ordered 3 item combo, and the amount of food that I received was monstrous.  I chose brisket, hot links, and pulled pork.  All three of them were fantastic! The brisket just melted upon hitting the tongue.  The hot links had a great taste with a kick of heat.  The pork was the perfect balance of smoke and sweet sauce.  And everything was just juicy, juicy, juicy!  Sides ordered were mac n cheese and potato salad.  Both were served in heaping portions and were perfect all by themselves.  Tonight was free beer night, and while I didn't imbibe I appreciated the gesture.  All in all the very best BBQ I have had in my life.  Awesome job guys!  Will be back soon for more!"}
{"text":"Best bbq in town! The have great catering options and even a butcher shop if you want great meats. Corn bread is sweet and a cake/corn meal mix."}
{"text":"In my opinion this place was just \"ok.\" I went with my family and a friend and between us, we tried just about everything on the menu and the general consensus was the same.  I have to give credit to the fact that most of the meat was at least cooked well and was tender, but it went south from there.  The pulled pork was swimming in sauce as was the sliced hot link.  I like sauce and this BBQ should have sauce but in the quantities it came in, it took away from the quality of the meat.  The hot link had good heat and snap of the casing, but drowned out by the copious  amounts of sauce.  The brisket was tender, but because it was being kept in a steam bath of Au Jus, it became over cooked and grayed out.  The brisket and ribs also lacked a good bark that is synonymous with quality BBQ.  The ribs were tender but good have been more so if the membrane on the bone side of the ribs had been removed before cooking.  The sides that we had were the mac n cheese, beans and potato salad and these may have been the better part of the meal.  The mac n cheese was homemade and had a good flavor.  The beans could have been a meal in themselves.  They had bacon, ground beef, greens and pieces of brisket in them and they were quite good.  The potato salad was also pretty good with a lot of ingredients and flavor.  At the end of the meal we tried the peach cobbler as they were out of apple.  The peach cobbler was a let down and not because of the canned peaches used, instead it was the amount of nutmeg.  By the third bite all you could taste was the nutmeg and it ruined it for us. Overall I give this place three stars for being mediocre, it is certainly not the best BBQ in Vegas, just another \"ok\" option"}
{"text":"Always 5 strategy Remeber faces so ill get treated like a friend awesome keep up the good work"}
{"text":"John Mull's is hands down some of the best BBQ you will get in Vegas. It may be a bit of a drive from the strip, but I swear it is worth it. MAKE THE TRIP if you are  wanting authentic bbq'ed meats and sides. The cobbler is pretty amazing as well!"}
{"text":"I wish they were closer to the strip. If you ever drive to Vegas, make a stop here before you arrive, or when you leave.  BIG portions, great staff, Good Food, and easy to order for beginners. Super friendly staff made the process nice. Big portions that I was not able to finish. I ate only 1/2 my food and I am the type that would do 4-8 plates at a buffet. Only person who finished their food was my Cousin Dewayne - 6'2\" 200 LBS man. - he just eats a lot."}
{"text":"The food is awesome.  The staff are awesome.  Go on Tuesday or Thursday and get the tri tip, you can totally taste the difference between tri tip and brisket.  The 3 meat combo is pricey but not when there's enough food in there to share between 2 people and still have some left over.  Pack your patience especially on weekends and during the lunch rush because there will be a line.  Also if you plan on eating in, be dressed for the weather because all the seating is outside."}
{"text":"John Mulls Is absolutely amazing. If you're in the Vegas area, and are looking for amazing BBQ and an off-strip experience, this is the place to come. Best pulled pork and brisket I've had."}
{"text":"this place is a must go!!! May have loved the employees just as much as the food. So much hospitality here! Hot links are a must"}
{"text":"Had the 3 meat combo with brisket, ribs and links. With greens, Mac and cheese and baked beans. So delicious. It's tucked in a residential area so we wouldn't have noticed. Glad we found it"}
{"text":"Wow, I'm at a loss for words, I went here for lunch and the brisket, ribs, and tri tip were amazing!  Not to mention the mac n cheese and cornbread.  I definitely left stuffed and was still full come dinner time.  Well worth it...I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I'm a barbecue connoisseur!!!  This is the BEST BARBECUE I EVER HAD IN LIFE!!!  SMH!!! If you don't come here when your in Las Vegas....you're definitely missing out!!"}
{"text":"A 4.5+ the meats were excellent the staff great, I love the outside seating. The portions are nice and large.   This reminds me a lot of North TX BBQ I live in South TX and  GA for quite a long time and the average BBQ there is better than here. BUT this is the best BBQ in Las Vegas that I have had to this point.   Over and out."}
{"text":"The best bar b q ive had in my 38 years on earth,that didnt come from a loved ones grill!  Straight up u get what u see& no frills fantastic meats. Links, ribs, brisket. I loved the sides, potatoe salad, beans!  In residential area but worth the drive & lack of atmosphere is not a thought while while sitting outside in the crazy heat & sweat dripping is still all good while getting your grubon...u can call ahead!"}
{"text":"Heard about this place from a friend after it was on Food Network.  You would never see this place off the road unless you knew where it was.  Its tucked into a residential neighborood which adds to the hominess feel of the place.  The restaurant is a no frills butcher shop, but the smells are enough to get your mouth watering.  I went for the 3 meat combo with ribs, brisket and puled pork with mac and cheese and mac salad for sides.  The ribs were a little dry but the flavor was very good.  The rub was excellent and great smokey flavor, could have just been a bad day.  They offer 2 bbq sauces so I put the spicey sauce on the ribs and they were just fine.  The highlight was the brisket, it was tender and flavorful with no sauce needed.  the third meat was a pulled pork sandwich and it was great, this is one of those dishes that your average joe who isn't totally into bbq would love or kids.    We ordered the hot link sandwich and was surprised to find that it was a hot link on a bun with a side of hot links smothered in bbq sauce and both were excellent!  You get a great sausage flavor up front and then the heat follows up shortly.    The Mac and Cheese was the highlight of the trip for reason that most mac and cheese you find at bbq places are bland.  Their version was so good, there were different fresh cheeses and a baked top for that nice crispy cheese flavor."}
{"text":"Where do I begin. We came here in search of a pick from Guy Fieri's DDD. It was a great experience. Ritchie gave us a behind the scenes tour and was so friendly. The food was out of this world-real bbq!!!! The ambience so unique, a good 'ol  western setting. What a unique and yummy lunch we had, big servings and soooo delicious!!"}
{"text":"Brisket is life and at John Mulls you get it every time. The atmosphere people and food are authentic. The line was long one day so they gave us samples! Wow. That is service par excellence."}
{"text":"I brought my family from Germany to his amazing place ! We all love this place and especially the atmosphere. The ppl are amazing and the food is the best bbq food we've ever had. Richie gave us a tour through the diner and its amazing. They make everything and fresh and you can definitely taste it ! We love this place and would recommend it to everybody ! Greetings from Nadine :)"}
{"text":"I must say that I was not impressed. Famous Dave's, Memphis barbecue, or Lucille's could have done better. With the exception of the macaroni and cheese, which was delicious, the hot links, rib tips and ribs were not good at all. The rib tips were tough. I will use their butcher shop, but will not be eating at their restaurant again."}
{"text":"This BBQ joint is on point! Reviews says it all but would like to add that the Collard Greens are the best this side of the Mississippi!   However, I did see a few people walk up and turned around to leave. Don't be discouraged by the long line. It goes by quick and more than worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"Please read below to see my first post regarding Service, not food quality (which has always been awesome and never in question!) I'm updating this review because it's the right thing to do and, hopefully, people will take it to heart and follow suit when necessary.  The once horrible experience detailed previously was pretty much completely erased from my memory banks thanks to Ms. Bianca at John Mulls. Not only did she personally reach out to apologize to me; she offered to re-cater another event for my office, free of charge. My faith in humanity sometimes wanes, but people like Ms. Bianca remind me there is still hope. When a business owner recognizes problems, acknowledges and accepts responsibility for their mistakes, and takes steps to correct them; well, let's just say it's a beautiful thing! I've been a big fan for a long time. Now I'm so impressed, I don't know what to say other than thanks!   Service is everything to me. I can look past a lot of minor inconveniences if the service is great but, my recent experience here was less than acceptable. I've been a big fan of this place for along time, even before the Road Kill Grill was conceived of, so keep that in mind.  If you order food a week in advance, and show up a bit earlier than you are scheduled; you would think the food would be out pronto. I had a group of 60 people waiting for me to return with our Christmas luncheon food. I was told to arrive at 10:15 ( which I did). You have to wait outside by the grills when you get your orders here. When I went out, there were about 5 groups of people waiting for their food. One guy ordered food for 200 people! A very rotund and rude woman arrived 30 minutes later; she too had ordered food for 200 people. Talk about getting in over your head on the catering orders! I waited for an hour and 40 minutes outside, standing in the cold, while one person attempted to handle the packaging of the orders, one person at time. I asked someone to get the order for an elderly lady standing next to me waiting for two pans of pulled pork. The big guy running the grill heard me and got her stuff or she would have been waiting for over two hours! You wouldn't believe the behavior of some of the people (who were rightly upset due to the long wait time) trying to cut into line ahead of others and using foul language, none of which was being addressed by the staff of John Mull's. A pity. I will never order a catered event from them again and recommend you look elsewhere, unless you don't mind standing around for a couple of hours while your guests wonder if they are at the right party."}
{"text":"Ate at John Mulls (3/23/2016) again, and their food is still very good.  I had forgotten how good the Baked Beans are.  The beans are the best I've eaten anywhere.  The place is  hard to find but worth the search.  I've eaten at John Mull's  twice recently (4-1-2014).  The ribs, tri-tips, sausage were excellent.  The Mac N  Cheese was very good and potato salad was good.  The portions filled the Styrofoam container.  The only complaint I have is the way this place is set up to serve the customer.  It is small, always crowded and takes more time than it should to get your food and pay, then either use  the back door to leave or weave through the crowd  back out the front door.  With all the money they seem to make, you'd think they would come up with a better system to make it easier to get your food and pay without the hassle.   There are tables set up outside to eat your order if you wish, but beware of windy days.  Prepare to wait and be a little confused  when you try this place but the food is good and it is what it is."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this butcher shop. From the moment I walked it, it was a fun and family/co-worker atmosphere. Everyone working was happy, joking, and having a good time, all while still doing their jobs efficiently. Outstanding employee's and very customer friendly!!!!  Quite a few customers inside, which was a good sign this place is a favorite to many people. I bought my order with a Groupon and added an additional $30.00 to my order. Enough meat for about 3 weeks. Everything was packaged perfectly, right in front of me. I love seeing my meat coming from being cut.   It's not hard to find and you get a great choice for a variety of meats. Give it a try if you can. Prices are excellent and it's worth the few minutes waiting for them to pack the meat for you."}
{"text":"This is my number two in Vegas for BBQ. I'm from Kansas City, so naturally I'm picky about my bbq. The meat always is done well and tastes so good. I am not a huge fan of the sides, but hey if Guy Fieri likes it it must be good. I also love the atmosphere. You literally drive through a neighborhood and so you feel like you're in someone's backyard. I recommend the brisket!"}
{"text":"Fantastic BBQ, have wanted to come here for a couple years but could not get to the Northside of Vegas.   After a morning of hiking at Red Rock Canyon we came for lunch and were not disappointed.  The spicey links are a must, the brisket was great too.   Decent value as well."}
{"text":"Saw it on Diners Drive-Ins and Dives, so the wife and I had to try.   I asked my wife to describe Road Kill Grill in one word. She said \"mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm\".  I love beef brisket and seriously this was the best I've ever had. But I am no barbecue master I admit that. The pulled pork, amazing!  Doesn't hurt that we live 10-15 minutes away."}
{"text":"Now...if you want great BBQ this is the place.  I have been coming here for the butcher services since I was a kid having my deer processed.  This place has a great selection and everything I have tried has been top notch.  The pulled pork was GREAT and the sauce matched perfect. I also suggest the hot links they were great size and flavor.  The mac n cheese.....was killer. Thick cheese and large noodles....(drool)"}
{"text":"My friend who's a recent local of Las Vegas brought my friends and I here because it's \"BOMB!\" After visiting Texas this previous year, nothing else compares to the BBQ there.   I came here on a Saturday afternoon, around 4PM? There was a line but I guess it wasn't as long as my friend has seen it. We got in line and quickly decided what we wanted. They also gave us free water bottles with their restaurant name on it, so we were off to a good start. I could tell you now that that was probably the highest point of the whole experience.  The people are nice here but they often talk too much and move at a snail's pace. All of the BBQ is already prepared and cooked. When you order, you just get a receipt and wait to go to the front of the line where there are guys who just scoop your food into a box (cafeteria style). After finding out that that was the process, the line should go by quickly because all they need to do is scoop right? But that unfortunately wasn't the case. It took a lot longer than it should've.   I ordered the 3 meat combo ($18.10) of brisket, rib tips and ribs with macaroni salad and mac and cheese. It also comes with corn bread. My friend had to wait 15 minutes for someone to get macaroni salad because they ran out. They even mistakenly almost gave away her box of food to another person.   When we finally got back to my friend's house, I opened my box and they forgot my brisket....   Really?   After spending that much time on my box, you still messed up? How about spending more time on doing your job rather than talk to everyone and sing/dance? In the end, I really only got the 2 meat combo and paid for the 3 meat combo... terribly disappointed.   The food wasn't anything amazing, it fell really short of it. I didn't enjoy their barbecue sauce either (both spicy and mild). My friend let me eat some of his brisket to try it (since I didn't get any) and I was quite disappointed.. it wasn't buttery and didn't melt in my mouth as it should. My other friend got the hot links which was probably my favorite thing out of everything this place has to offer.  Overall, I would probably only come back for the hot links but I guess it's good for what Vegas has to offer in terms of BBQ. I honestly I would rather try other restaurants in Vegas than coming back here.  Tip: CHECK YOUR BOX TO MAKE SURE WHAT THEY GAVE YOU WAS CORRECT!"}
{"text":"this place is a diamond in the ruff. I would have never known about this place had I not been referred by a friend. the location is in a very remote location (in a subdivision on a ranch). it is essentially a barn/shed with tons of picnic tables set up around with tents for shade. the food is amazing and the portions are very large. the price is very reasonable also ($15 for a 2 meat combo to include 2 sides and drink)"}
{"text":"This definitely has to be one of the best BBQ places in Las Vegas. The brisket, pulled pork, ribs, hot links are all delicious not even to mention the sides. The green beans and mac and cheese can't be beat and the cornbread is amazing. My wife and I will definitely continue to keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Love the ribs! Best Mac and cheese I've ever had. I've lived here for 22 years and had never heard of this place. Plan on waiting unless you call your order in ahead of time. Worth the wait!! Looking forward to checking out their new restaurant out on the gun range N Decatur. Nice staff... Always helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"This is the best mac and cheese I have ever tasted.   The brisket was nice and moist, just as it's supposed to be, but I like the taste of the pulled pork even more. The sauce that they use is vinegary and sweet and is just a great fusion of flavors.   The ribs are fantastic, they give a little kick and are great without sauce, so if you like just a dry rub, you are in for a treat.   The one thing I always do is I try all the meats without sauce first because if they use a great rub, it will only be enhanced with the sauce.  And for dessert, you just can't go wrong with some warm peach cobbler."}
{"text":"Excellent ribs!  I ordered the five rib plate and was pleasantly surprised that they were tender and juicy, besides being flavored with a not-to-salty bbq rub. The staff was friendly and fast. Their baked beans had a slightly sweet flavor, but it wasn't overdone. I wanted green beans but they gave me baked beans, it was my fault for using a cell phone with a bad connection though. Their collard greens could have had a tiny bit more bacon, but I always say that. Overall great experience!"}
{"text":"This was our first time there his past weekend.  I must say- the food was excellent.  The spice rub on the meat was really good.  The brisket was so tender.   The chicken and ribs were tender, well-seasoned.  The only thing - the potato salad was ok.  During my next trip to Las Vegas, this will be a must-visit restaurant."}
{"text":"I love this place! Best BBQ in town! Everything they have is amazing. Have used the butcher also. Always have a great experience when I go there !"}
{"text":"All I can say is, Hot Diggity Dam! The food is so amazing! We come from across town to grab our hot links and enjoy a meal. Came for the meat but the macaroni and cheese I cant get enough of! Its  chessy, gooey, stringy yumminess that explodes in my mouth! Besides the links the beef brisket is one of our favorites, smoky flavor, so tender you could feed it to a baby. The staff is always friendly and helpful:)"}
{"text":"Delicious meats, good food! Cornbread is one of the best i had. Mac and cheese is delicious. The brisket and hot links are my fave. This place is a hidden gem in the northwest of Vegas. We also order here for catering."}
{"text":"After being told to try this place, we finally went for dinner. Got the 3 combo plate to share. Even at 5pm, there was a line. We got brisket, pulled pork, & hot links with mac-n-cheese, baked beans, & corn bread. We got a side of hot & mild BBQ sauce to try both. Mild was very good, hot was ok. Pulled pork was our favorite, it was very tender, flavorful. Hot links were pretty good. Not a fan of the brisket. Just bland. Both sides were good. Baked beans were better, mostly because we got end of a mac-n-chesse batch. Might have been incredible if it was fresh. Corn bread was delicious! Service was efficient & friendly enough."}
{"text":"Always the bomb and good friendly people.  And don't for get to get some peach cobbler"}
{"text":"i was in Vegas for my honeymoon and had previously seen 3D on tv about Road Kill Grill and wanted to try it. well i got the 3 meat with beans qand macncheease, i wasnt disappointed. this was by far the best brisket I ever ate and the beans are to die for."}
{"text":"Finally got john's. everything you have heard is true. Best tri tip, brisket, and sausage I think I have ever had. notice I did not say ribs of pulled pork because I didn t get any. next time. it is what it is, a meat shop that serves lunch. most tender, flavorful meat ever. Better I say, better than tex by far and Memphis by long shot.like meat butter.  have to eat outside in the yard of a neighborhood house. Crazy stuff. good place for a ride too lunch.  BYOB.... Mac n cheese was great also along with meaty baked beans--killer! was $17 for 3 meat combo and I hadn't eaten yet and could only scarf down bout half....just couldn't stop eaten....so good.  sucks hrs are 1100-1800 for cooked food.  other than that they every conceivable meat product for sale from pigs ass to rabbits foot.  meats are a little on the high side but custom butchers are. great catering prices. I will use them for event soon.  deserve 6 of 5 stars. Thanks John."}
{"text":"I've had better food was cold and mac was a big blah . I think famous daves is better . I'm sorry just won't come again it's not real good"}
{"text":"The place is off Decatur heading west on Alexander then turn left on Thoms.  It is in the middle of a neighborhood about 1 block south.  You stand in line and receive generous portions of brisket, chicken, links, and pork ribs, etc.  We take it home to eat but they have primitive seating outside.  Their sides are excellent...have not had a bad one yet including potato salad, Mac and cheese, green beans made with smoked turkey, baked beans, etc.  Their cornbread is soft and yummy.  There is a line at lunchtime so call your order in early."}
{"text":"The best! Took home a couple of filets, they were perfect! Melt in your mouth. For a great sandwich or the best prime beef in town, this is the place!"}
{"text":"The absolute best BBQ in Las Vegas I have found yet! My go to choices are the Hot Links, Pulled Chicken, Mac & Cheese, and the Baked Beans. The burnt ends on the Mac is the best! The rib tips are pretty tastey too and I typically do not like that style of food. I love picking this  up on a cheat day and bringing it home since you can only eat outside here but the food is worth the drive. It is a must try if you have not had it yet. I will continue to always come back and the staff is always so friendly."}
{"text":"Favorite bbq place in Vegas period. Kind of out of the way to find but once you do trust me its worth it."}
{"text":"Roadkill.....so so good. Had the beef tips they were awesome. The mac and cheese was excellent as was the coleslaw. The only thing is they don't have indoor seating. Only outdoor which has misters. Ate in the car with cool air conditioning :)  Definitely will be back for some more!"}
{"text":"Flavorless, high school cafeteria style serving, small side portions, received wrong dessert and no sauce like I asked.  Extremely overrated. Pass."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Las Vegas. Be prepared to sit outside to eat and to wait in line for some of the best, generous portions of homemade sides, and BBQ that is outta this world!"}
{"text":"OMG is what had to say after one spoon of the Mac and cheese, never have I tasted such tasty Mac and cheese.  My first time there and I was sold at the first smell of BBQ. I had a pulled pork sandwich which was so tasty with flavor that it busted in your mouth good BBQ sauce. As I said best Mac and cheese and cherry cobbler for dessert that was like mama made. If you haven't visited John Mulls you must and I double down that you won't be disappointed.  BBQ in heaven"}
{"text":"This place is definitely a Las Vegas local spot to hit and if you are out of town you definitely have to go here all I can say is amazing food"}
{"text":"This was our second visit, but the first time I can review the food.  On our first visit we stood in line for about 20 min to order then another 20 after we paid when we overhead the grill cook tell one of the line prep guys that they were out of ribs, rib tips, brisket, and chicken.  Since we ordered three of the four, we asked for a refund and they were very nice about it and also gave us free meal cards for our wait and the inconvenience.   That helped us decide to make the 60 mile round trip journey a second time.  I was amped to try this great BBQ after all the positive reviews I read and am sad to say I was disappointed. The sauce comes from big Smart & Final jugs which is surprising.  Neither the spicy or regular sauce were very good.  The cole slaw had a very off putting sour taste. The cornbread was just okay, as was the pulled pork, but nothing I would come back for.  However, I very much enjoyed the hot link.  For me that was the shining star of my Styrofoam box.  The BF had the ribs and found those lacking as well as the mac salad, which was not very good.  I do not think we will be coming back to this establishment."}
{"text":"This hidden gem way off the strip is worth the trip! The set-up and floorplan is kind of weird but makes sense at the same time. The service is really friendly and offered samples for newbies and even offered other combos to help me get my most bang for my buck. The majority of seating is outdoors under a covered tent.  The green beans, cornbread and hot links are really good!"}
{"text":"Literally every meat and every side is delicious and you can tell it is made fresh and from scratch. They don't cut corners on anything when it comes to food. Now they've also upgraded their outdoor seating and added some outdoor heaters for cooler days and more canopies to hide from the sun on the hot days.  I love barbecue and I've tried finding comparable food closer to home (in the south) and I have not been successful. You also get a TON of food for about $15. To get this much food at any of the other BBQ places I've been to in Vegas, it has been more than twice that amount. There's a lot of good BBQ in Vegas but this is the best I've found, and the staff is always friendly. Definitely check it out."}
{"text":"Chuck and the crew are great.   They not only have the best BBQ and smoked meats ever but philanthropy is their second business.  When you go, don't miss out on the mac & cheese with any meal.  So good."}
{"text":"I used them for catering for a work event and we have nothing but good things to say. The food was great, proportions were very good for the prices, overall great experience. We will look to use them again for BBQ events."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Vegas! Check hours as they close early. Great prices and amazing food. Mac n cheese is amazing and the brisket is to die for"}
{"text":"Love John Mule meats and BBQ Is Great! The Owner is very nice and always greets you with a smile!!"}
{"text":"Visiting from San Diego && diners drive ins and dives did not lie!!! Awesome food, amazing customer service and great environment! They even have mist-ers to break the heat. Restroom was fresh, smelled amazing, was ventilated (much needed in the Vegas heat)"}
{"text":"this place is hard to find, but when you get there it's worth it, had the link, brisket, rib combo, was great."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time yesterday. It is in a residential neighborhood which surprised me. The seating is all outdoors. The service was excellent. Every employee I came in contact with was friendly and kind. They passed out water bottles, since we were standing in he sun waiting for our food.   I ordered the rib tips with green beans, macaroni and cheese, and corn bread. All of the sides were absolutely amazing and delicious as was the spicy BBQ sauce.  I would never order the rib tips again because of the overpowering taste of liquid smoke in the meat. I could still taste it three hours later. I will definitely go again, but I will order a different kind of meat. My friend ordered the brisket. She received a huge portion of meat and said it was delicious with no strong taste of liquid smoke."}
{"text":"One of the most amazing hideaway bbq spot in las Vegas it's a bit away from the strip but seriously worth it ! The place is originally a butcher shop but the family decided to start serving there amazing family recipes and there amazing meats cooked to perfection !"}
{"text":"Have to chalk this discover one up to Yelp.  Was a little hesitant to go in but I am glad I did.  Been here twice for some protein for some bbq action.  First time was a whole gaggle of baby back ribs, got so much they threw in a whole case of eggs.  I was skeptical at first when the ribs looked like they were vacum packed and I didn't see them slice them up in front of me.  When I got them home though I knew these were hand cut and no Costco rebranded stock.  Nice and meaty and they qued up perfectly.  Second time was for probably my most pricey meat purchase to date, a 4 rib prime rib roast.  All you have to do is check out the pic I posted and I won't have to go any further with my review.  Nice and friendly people.  They have everything you need for serious barbecue enthusiasts except the charcoal.  Lamb, Duck, Geese, Deer, all cuts of the hog and cow...I hear the bacon is good so I'll have to go back for that one of these days.  LOCATION! LOCATION! locations? Kinda hidden away in a subdivision/industrial area."}
{"text":"What can I say. Nothing other than, don't waste another minute and go try it. All the food was so good, I told a friend of mine that was going to Vegas for his Birthday. He loved it so much, he told me he had to ask for another plate to go so he could have it in the room. It is a distance away from the strip, but it is totally worth the trip. We had Brisket, Tri Tip, Ribs, Mac & Cheese, Corn Bread and Sweet Potatoes. This place is definitely on my list for my next trip to Vegas and probably for all my next trips to Vegas. The food was so good, I didn't have a chance to even stop and take a picture. This place is so worth the price. I thought I was going to pay more for my food."}
{"text":"My son & I set off on an adventure. Found John Mulls Road Kill Grill in Las Vegas. The original location is a bit off the beaten path. WORTH IT! BBQ was so good. Huge portions & no frills. Arrive early because the line was literally out the door. We sat on some old outdoor picnic tables and stuffed ourselves under a welcome Vegas sun."}
{"text":"I love BBQ food and I want to try it for the Guy Fieris recommendation. Now, is a small shack so I don't know how they do when is really busy.   We try the 3 meat combo with 2 sides and Hawaiian bread. The brisket was ok, the ribs where good and you feel that light flavor of hickory smoke. The chicken was good also but too dry. The mac and cheese was really good, the yams was like they put a big block of brown sugar and cinammon on it. They were extremely sweet.  I'll prefer to try other places but still deserve a 4 star for flavors."}
{"text":"First time ever Yelping here.  The customer service here was outstanding!!!  I inquired about the type of jerky they were making and he striked up a conversation and gave me and my lunch partner a free sausage stick to try.  We left out the back door where the smokers are and they gave us a tour and showed us the food.  The food was outstanding due to them utilizing real wood in their smokers.  Most places utilizes commercial smokers but not here.  This is traditional BBQ which makes it the best! I will return again soon and with more guests to have this great experience!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST BBQ!!! This place will definitely be one of the things i miss about living in Vegas! I can't say enough about how awesome the food is!! Some of our favorites...mac n cheese, potato salad, brisket, and hot links! YUM!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best pulled pork and baked beans in Vegas.   The pulled pork is tender and juicy. Combine it with their sauce and it is pig heaven. . . Pig heaven for the eater...not the pig.  The baked beans are also delicious. They cook the beans with pork, onions and I think green peppers. Whatever else is in it is just amazing. I could eat this with spaghetti noodles. (Call me crazy..sometimes I like to live on the wild side.)  Service is really friendly also.  Love this place.  Just FYI has outside seating only."}
{"text":"Seriously Best BBQ in the West. Located in North Las Vegas in a nice residential neighborhood John Mulls has a lot of room for families, and groups on their outside picnic tables. Went on a Tuesday and had the best tri-tip combo plate with brisket, Ribs and 2 great sides, the baked beans and the Mac n cheese Mmmm totally dreamy!!! Oink oink moo moo ;)"}
{"text":"We're fans of Triple D and this place has been on our radar for quite some time now.  We moved to the north side of town not long ago and I decided to go ahead and give them a try.  Since no one wanted to come with me, I ordered a bunch of food to take back and enjoy in the comfort of my own kitchen.  I ordered some ribs, rib tips, chicken, brisket, and cornbread, along with greens, and mac and cheese.  The greens were great! I don't usually order them when I go out because some places add apple cider vinegar to them for some reason.  I did double check before I ordered and was advised they don't cook them in it.  The mac and cheese was so so.  Not the best to be honest.  I make mine from scratch, but I don't mine others.  This was just bland and clumpy.  The pasta was overcooked as well.  The ribs and rib tips weren't bad, but could have been better and more tender.  The chicken was actually good, very flavorful; but the cornbread was way too sweet.  It tasted more like a cake then actual cornbread.  The brisket was tough and dry.  My husband didn't even bother finishing it.    Their service was good, very prompt and there was a ton of people lined up and already eating.  Overall they're okay.  Good BBQ is hard to find, but if I had to decide whether or not to eat out or make everything at home, I would choose to make it all.  But sometimes you don't want to do that, so we'll keep searching for that \"It\" BBQ spot in Vegas."}
{"text":"My hot link dinner with Mac & Chs & sweet potatoes was perfect!! Still have half left- so much & so good!!!"}
{"text":"When you first arrive to John Mull's Meats and Road Kill Grill, it looks a little sketchy. Do not be afraid because when you eat the food you'll feel absolutely AMAZING! :-)   FOOD: We got 2 Three Meat combos w/ two sides. The meats we chose were: Pulled chicken, pulled pork, brisket, pork ribs, beef tri tip and bbq sausage links. The sides we ate were: yams, collard greens, macaroni and cheese and beans. Both entrees come with either corn bread or white bread.   My oh my, where to begin. The corn bread is probably the best I've ever had! All the meats were tender and well-seasoned. My favorite meats was the brisket, which was tender, and sausage links (you can get the links cut up or whole and the sauce gives it a nice spicy kick). The ribs was easy to rip off the bone and the beef tri tips were small and tasty.   Now let's move onto the sides. I've never enjoyed collard greens or yams until I ate at John Mull's. The collard greens are flavorful and doesn't have the rough texture that normally comes with this side dish. The Yams is a bit on the sweater side, but is a nice compliment to the smokey BBQ meats. The macaroni and cheese and beans was tasty as well, but tasted like the usual sides you'd get at another BBQ joint.   We ordered the peach cobbler for dessert. The peaches were fresh, which is always a plus. However, it did not have the crumbly top that I usually like. Overall, that peach cobbler was yummy, but not my favorite part of the meal.   PRICE: All items were reasonably priced. For my entire meal for two people it came out to $41 and the leftovers lasted us two more meals since the portions were so big! I recommend if it is your first time to get the three or two meat entree so you can try a variety of items for a lower cost.   SERVICE: I was lucky to not wait in line too long. I arrived there at 2:35 PM and waited about 25 minutes to get my food and pay. However, when I left at around 3 PM there was already a line out the door! So I recommend coming here when it is not rush hour. However, if you do come when it's busy bring a book or have your phone fully charged to keep you busy while you wait! The staff was nice and sweet. You order your food inside at the counter and they serve you similar to a cafeteria style, then you eat it outside, but you can also take it home as well.   Overall, my experience at John Mull's was memorable and awesome. I can see why this place is highly recommended and may have the title of \"The Best BBQ in Las Vegas.\"   Happy Dining,   J Tran"}
{"text":"John Mull's is the best barbecue in Nevada hands-down you go there you'll never go anywhere else"}
{"text":"I don't care what anyone says, good barbecue is my sign of a good time. I'll wait here any time of the year, no matter time of day, uhh it's just that good. Seriously, try everything you won't be disappointed. I love the hot links, pulled pork, all of the sides are bomb. They have all of the comforts of barbecue perfectly done right. Flavorful, fresh, and straight to the point. They also have free hot dogs and hamburgers some days for those long waits! If I can wait here in 110+ degree weather for this deliciousness, so can you! Come on by!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday morning to get some meat for the grill. Picked up a bunch of filets and some beef ribs. OMG this place is amazing, the filets they show you and ask which ones you want, so fresh. Had one later that night and it was amazing. Best meat in town! Also if you spend $60.00 on an order they give you free eggs!"}
{"text":"I've had bbq from all over and this is easily in my top 5.  If you're an aspiring pitmaster then you've got to check their sides.  Fogettaboutit I had to rethink my mac and cheese and baked beans after trying theirs.  I can't wait until June for my annual Vegas vacation to get back to John's on Saturday night with my Dad.  I think my Dad's take on it summed it up quite well on the drive back to the Strip.  It's a few miles off the Strip and...just GPS it, it's well worth it.  I asked Dad, \"was it worth the trek from the Strip?\"  His reply... \"Hmmm...I suppose.\"  Lol.  That's my Dad's way of saying \"HELL YES!!!  I haven't had barbeque that good since I was a kid when my pop and uncles used to bbq.\"  I think I'll get two 3 meat plates to have leftovers all weekend.  Loves me some goooooooooood BBQ!!!"}
{"text":"Very tasty meat and the sides where amazing. I had the baked beans and the Mac and cheese. I got there right when they opened so there wasn't a line. I got it to go. Even cold it was perfect. Only bad thing and it was my fault was I didn't ask for more BBQ sauce. I will for sure go back"}
{"text":"By far the best BBQ in Town! The ribs are mouth watering good. Great for picking up dinner for the family at home like we did. All they need are some Fried Pickles and they would compete with the big boys in the south. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Thinking of Road Kill Grill always brings a smile to my face. Why it took me this long to review the best BBQ place in Vegas? Selfishness :).. Thanks to Guy Fierri, people come near and far to try the best Vegas has to offer.  This is a very simple joint. Outdoor dining only. Their brisket, links, pulled pork, ribs and tri-tip(only on Tuesdays and Thursdays) are insanely good. My little one digs their mac n cheese. Green beans, potato salad and baked beans are my favorite sides and their peach cobbler is very addictive.  We were lucky enough to enjoy their free beer Saturdays until it got scrapped not too long ago due to a complaint from some bar nearby losing business (boo!).  Chuck, the owner is very low key. You'll see him grilling or at the meat shop.  Just a tip...get there before 1145am. The line could get very long."}
{"text":"Some decent 'Que on my side of town!  I'll admit, I had to check out this place after it was featured on \"Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives\" on the Food Network.  But without this tidbit, I might have never knew the place existed!  Funniest thing about John Mull's is that it is basically located in the middle of residential homes.  Yes!  When you GPS the address you might think you're being led to the wrong place.  But keep truckin' because the BBQ joint is on property of what looks to be a ranch house.  John Mull's eating area shares the common space with what is essentially a butcher block.  Get a whole cow, some eggs, and then a meal of BBQ afterwards?  I don't see why not.  While the market has been around for some time, my review basically goes over the BBQ station.  It used to be just a shack when they first started, lately I hear they have a small food truck type deal to serve folks as well.  They need the help, John Mull's can get busy for lunch!  Typically it's take-out, but they do have a small seating area with about a dozen bench tables or so.  If it's full, eat it out of your truck tailgate like most folks do!  I am not an expert on BBQ by any means, but good food I can do.  Sure, you have your naysayers that go on and on and on about how their BBQ sauce is from a bottle (I can confirm I think it is), but really I don't care.  The meat itself is not artificially processed.  Trimmed in-house, and smoked in-house!  Flavor of the BBQ is what is necessary!  John Mull's makes some mighty decent 'Que.  Easiest thing on the menu to try if you're a noob to this place is just to go with a combo meal.  A 2 Meat Combo will run you about $14, and a 3 Meat Combo will run about $16.  When it's the wifey and I we usually opt for the 3 Meat Combo and share.  Be careful, it's a lot of food!  The 3 Meat Combo will easily feed a third person.    Combos come with your choice of meats and sides.  Meats include:  -Hot Link -Brisket -Ribs -Pulled Pork -Pulled Chicken -1/4 Chicken  Their strength lies in their ribs and brisket I think.  I like their pulled pork, but if I'm having their ribs (which I always do) I compliment it with the brisket.  The ribs are cooked just right, requisite pink ring around the outside, meat pulls off the bone (but not too easily), super moist and tender, finished on the grill with a slathering of BBQ sauce right before serving.  The brisket is flavorful, and just plain juicy, thanks to the lovely fat cap that surrounds each one before smoking.  OK, if you just say 'brisket' when you order your meat, you will most likely just get the lean end of the brisket.  Which is not dry, but not as near darn tasty as the fatty end.  So be specific on which part of brisket you want, lean or fat.  I will usually ask for a 1/2 portion of both.    For sides, Road Kill Grill has some options too:  -Potato or Macaroni Salad -Coleslaw -Baked Beans -Mac & Cheese -Green Beans  Unfortunately, no collard greens or black eyed peas!  But you can't have everything.  I will mention that the green beans are just mainly reheated from the can, so I mainly skip that.  The baked beans are very good, and their mac & cheese is actually pretty stellar.  I also enjoy their potato salad.  Combos and meals come with slices of white bread if you request, but don't forget to ask!  It won't always come with it included.  Also, get some extra BBQ sauce!  I know the sauce may be bottled, but they let it simmer on the side most of the day, so the flavor does concentrate nicely.  The hot BBQ sauce has a nice kick so watch out.  Kaboom!  It's overall great eats, just don't forget extra napkins and extra wet wipes!  It will get messy.  Which one of you city people eat BBQ with a knife and fork?  That's what the white bread is for!  Another item I usually order when we eat at Road Kill Grill is a sandwich.  They load these suckers nicely so you get a nice portion of meat and sauce to bread.  Basically a meal in itself!  I enjoy the hot links sandwich in particular.  This with extra hot BBQ sauce on top, and a side of coleslaw?  Classic.    BBQ can be a very picky topic, so you will see tons of varying reviews on John Mull's Meats & Road Kill Grill.  This is because depending on what side of the country you are from, you have a different taste of what BBQ should be.  Some like tomato based, some like vinegar based, some like mustard based, and so forth and so forth.  Some folks like more smoke, some folks like less smoke, Hell, some folks like their BBQ baked in an oven instead.  But no matter what, we all like good food.  And I think Road Kill Grill overall has good food.  Give them a try for yourself.  You might like, but then again you might NOT like.  Many reviews for this place are in the 3 or 4-star range, I tracked over to the 4-star area because I like it here.  In a place like Las Vegas it's difficult to find good 'Que that's not from a place like Famous Dave's or Memphis Championship BBQ.  Nuff' said."}
{"text":"John Mull's Meats, not to sure where to start...... this places is awesome in some many ways. I mean what's not to say about this place but great things. Make sure you beat the line before daily cooked bbq  Runs out !!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum!! Great food. Love the bbq for lunch. Ordered a thanksgiving fresh turkey. 32 pounds.  Was the vrry Best turkey ever!!"}
{"text":"Been coming to John Mull's butcher shop regularly since I was a kid. Lived in the neighborhood.   I always faced a dilemma, wait outside in the heat, or wait inside in the freezing cold, but now they've added the grill, problem solved. Food is delicious.   Quality Product and Quality Customer Service."}
{"text":"Visiting Vegas for our honeymoon from Fort Worth Texas, in 9/3/2016 we decided to try one of Guy Fieri's suggestions.......needless to say WHAT A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!! This is No Railhead Barbeque in Fort Worth Texas. I do believe Guy is either paid to review some restaurants or his taste buds are numb from all the places he visits.  This is not \"Barbeque\" this is boiled or baked meat. First of all there is no smoke ring, clearly this meat is not smoked AT ALL. I really looked forward to eating at this place...boy was I disappointed. It was dry, luke warm and expensive. I don't mind paying for good food, however I was robbed. I should have know when I saw the staff pulling the meet from a water bath.  How anyone thinks that this is Barbeque is sadly mistaken. We have a whole tray of food left and I don't even think I want to torture a homeless person with this terrible food. I would be doing society a favor if I just threw it away. Don't eat here, don't waste your money. I wanted to take my food back and get my money back, however my husband would not let me make a scene. Only reason I am giving one star is because they gave us free water and the cornbread was good.  Railhead in Fort Worth Texas YOU ARE TRULY THE BEST!!!"}
{"text":"I love ribs and these were some of the best I've ever eaten. Cornbread is damn good too!"}
{"text":"First lets me start by saying whoooooa! As soon as you walk in you can smell the meats, in the best way possible. The people working there are super friendly and the food.... Oh the food! I brought my husband here for his birthday, one because he loves good southern bbq and he's a Guy fan! I had the ribs, coleslaw, and mac & cheese. The meat was so tender and seasoned very well, and the mac & cheese was some of the best I've ever had, and if you knew me you'd know I don't joke about mac & cheese! The corn beard, oh my lanta, the corn bread!! Perfection. I did NOT even mind waiting in line for 45 mins, it was worth every single second."}
{"text":"This was a unique steakhouse. It carries all kinds of Americam foods and the meats that this eatery have are amazing. I am blown away too about how nice they are and try to educate individuals on the meats and how they are cooked and such. What is best and goes the best  with that and vice versa. My husband is a me at meat con a sure so he had to try here. We had prime rib and it is not to disappoint."}
{"text":"Wow talk about a whole in the whole.  it's in a neighborhood. Big lot almost looks like a ranch. Great food. We had the brisket it was awesome.  Great experience overall. All the seating is outside though.  Probably wouldn't recommend on day like today (high 111). They did have plenty of shade, misters set up and free water which made the heat bearable."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in las vegas, it's been a local butcher shop for years in my neighborhood. John takes pride in the meat and the employees always have a great attitude. The portions are huge so you'll have left overs and you must try everything! Mac & cheese is also GREAT! They also have free water bottles in the hot days as they have the BBQ tailgate outside."}
{"text":"How come I lived here for almost 2 decades and nobody told me there was a great BBQ place right up the street?  Ribs were great.  I loved the potato salad and baked beans.  The pulled pork was also really good.  No frills.  No bathroom for example, but if you don't mind sitting outside on comfortable, clean picnic tables no problem.  Seriously this is the most hidden BBQ joint in town.  If somebody doesn't tell you how to get there, forget it.  Of course with smart phones and the address above that's not problem.  Prices are about average for real barbecue meats and quite good for the generous sides."}
{"text":"Good bbq. Sauce are not the greatest. A little too sweet for my taste but an overall great experience. I will need to eat there again to try some other things."}
{"text":"Would you look at that?  If you drive to the Northwest and take a few lefthand turns, you end up in a stockyard in Kentucky!  Almost.  From the minute you get out of your car and see the line wrapping around the shed, you know you are in for a unique experience.  Get in line on the left for an awesome lunch or turn to the right to go into the deli and order fresh meat.  We chose lunch.    John Mull's is good.  Really good.  I can't go so far as to say it's better than Rollin Smoke, but I will say they are totally different animals, offering totally different experiences.  There's just something about ordering at a food cart and eating outside that adds magic to BBQ.  I had the pulled pork sandwich and stole a rib from my boyfriend.  The ribs!  So tender.  And the potato salad and mac n cheese were both incredibly good sides.  Apparently, they are only open til 6 p.m. so go early and go hungry.  Portions are huge!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The butchers are very nice and suggest how the meat should be trimmed and prepared...but will cut however you like. The ladies who take your meat order are friendly and helpful with cooking tips. Every now and then I get some eggs with my order as well. Order holiday turkeys early so that you can be sure to have a perfect bird."}
{"text":"Found this gem on Triple D a few years back, bookmarked it and had a chance to go recently.  It did not disappoint.  Really fantastic BBQ tucked away in a residential street.  I am glad I do not live by it because I would eat it every day!! I had the two meat combo; brisket and ribs with a double side of Mac n cheese.  The brisket and ribs were tender, juicy, smokey, and perfectly seasoned with their rub.  It was so good that you almost did not need their own freshly made BBQ sauce that comes in mild or spicy.  Their BBQ is dry rubbed and smoked, the sauce is more of a side condiment.  The Mac n cheese was some of the best I have ever had at a restaurant.  This place is super highly recommended and one which I plan on returning too many times.  They also do catering and have an exotic meat market where you can buy just about any cut of meat you can think of."}
{"text":"Straight up delicious food. Every single thing was done perfectly. The ribs and rib tips are glorious!   Arrive early to beat the inevitable line.   It's worth the wait.   I cannot wait to get back to that food ASAP!"}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't already been said.  This place has super good food and the staff is very friendly.  Get your BBQ on now."}
{"text":"I got a few friends telling me this place sucks and it's dirty but when I checked it out it seemed very clean and orderly. The staff was helpful in recommending cuts. Delicious food and the sauces are amazing as well. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"What a weird and wonderful place!  First of all, finding the place was a little weird.  You are literally driving though a neighborhood.  I don't know the history of the place, but it looks like a neighborhood lot was transformed into a small industrial meat smoking ranch.  So the place is rather busy at times.  It does take a while to order.  Everyone is friendly and just about everyone will greet you.  There is no place to sit but outside.  There are tons of covered benches with water sprayers everywhere to keep the place cool.  At times I actually felt like I was in Hawaii, getting hit with gentle drizzles of rain!  Bathrooms are also clean, and surprisingly air-conditioned!  Onto the food... For the price, you get A LOT of food.  Seriously, what a great value for your money.  I had a brisket & rib tip plate.  The brisket was soft and tender, though not my favorite type of preparation.  There was very little seasoning on the brisket, and it did need the BBQ sauce (which I might add was EXCELLENT).  I would have preferred a more smokey meat cut thicker with a bark, but all in all it was good.  The rib tips though were awesome.  Nice bark, not burnt, good seasoning and chew on them.  So good.  Rib tips by far were my favorite!  Sides were decent.  Cornbread, beans, and yams all pretty typical.  The star here is really the meats.  I will be back to try other samplings... Excellent and unique place.  Worth the drive, worth every penny!"}
{"text":"MMmMMMm I loved their ribs and hot link! Their Mac N Cheese was good also. Ribs were nice and smoky and fresh barbeque sauce complimented them well. I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Awesome and random. Approaching this place all I could think was \"I made a wrong turn\" however, given its random location, this place is a gem! Tons of outside seating, live bands and great bbq food! The yams were killer! This place is a must if you like BBQ!"}
{"text":"Place is so good! The food and service get 5 stars. I only give them 4 because we waited in a line outside for over an hour and think they can come up with a better process. I have worked in food and beverage operations management for over a decade and there is always a way to improve upon an operation. This is their only weakness."}
{"text":"Catering review:  Coming to Road Kill Grill is a treat in itself, but ordering catering is simply fantastic.  I had small party at home, so ordering bqq for around 15 people seemed an easy alternative to cooking.  Ordering: Brisket Pulled Chicken Mac 'n' Cheese Coleslaw  String beans and Potatoes  Everything was on time when we came to pick up. All food was hot and was amazingly delicious. All food was packed in containers that were not flimsy and were stacked into protective packaging that was easy to transport. Also when we picked up a gentleman came out and packed it in our car.   An easy breakdown is Food was awesome, service was fantastic and portion size was more than enough with an extremely reasonable price range. I highly recommend to anyone Road Kill Catering.  Overall Food: 5-5 Service: 5-5 Coming back: Yes"}
{"text":"Must try this joint. Very great food and friendly staff. Ribs and hot links are well worth the trip from the east coast.  For more details and another positive review check this place out on diners drive thrus and dives."}
{"text":"Nice people and the best BBQ in Las Vegas! The mac & cheese is hands down my favorite."}
{"text":"Well worth the drive, I took a trip to Vegas just to try their BBQ. The guys that work there are also really cool. I had their ribs and chicken with the sides of mac n cheese and their baked beans. When I go out to Vegas again I'll be sure to stop there again."}
{"text":"The ribs are Damn good but the peach cobbler, son-don't worry about eating it - I'll eat your share too ummm-mmm! Great place to take family for a literal night out. Get your supper and set at the picnic table let the kids run around - get there early it gets crowded quick. We usually take home a tray of ribs and cobbler."}
{"text":"Food is amazing but the cluster mess to order your hot food is annoying.  They try to organize it but fail miserably.  There is a very slow girl outside named Ashley that write tickets and controls traffic flow.  She made me wait outside and allowed people to get in front of me.  Then she looked at me like I was suppose to say something to the people even though she messed up.  I like the food but at some point they need to figure out a better process because service is terrible."}
{"text":"Went last Saturday expecting a long line. Must have been good timing cuz hardly a line. Had the rib tips with mac and cheese and green beans. AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!! All of it. A lot for food and very decent prices. Will be a regular."}
{"text":"I think John Mull's owes the Diner's drive-ins and dives show about 25% of their profits. If you are looking for the quick review on this place. SKIP IT. Not a good destination bbq joint. Hopefully I just saved you cab money from the strip. If you know what good bbq is then you will find out quickly that the only bbq that I had that is worth ordering was the ribs. Here we go.   Let's start off by saying I know great bbq and you can't find it here. Just check out the bottom of this review and you will find over 25 bbq reviews. I also know good bbq and you can barely find that here. Lets go down the order.   Brisket - Sitting in a broth pre sliced. This is criminal. They should not be allowed to serve brisket. Save it for someone who knows how to treat it. I got a sample in line and was glad I did. This was the 1st time in a long time I didn't order brisket at a bbq joint. STAY AWAY  Ribs - This was they highlight of the meal, but still nothing to brag about. If I had to go back this is the only thing I would eat again as they were good ribs. Pulled from the bone just right, but hardly any smoky flavor and the smoke ring was not very pronounced.   Pulled pork - The pulled pork was better than most. Really should have been bbq pulled pork as is had a lot of their sauce in it. It was good and maybe worth a try.   Hot Link - Not very hot and it was okay. Nothing to brag about or drag down.   Sides -  Mac and Cheese - stay away not any good looks can be deceiving here.  Baked beans - I enjoyed these but the were almost more like chili.   Dessert  Peach Cobbler - Almost the highlight of the whole meal as it was tasty. Though not the best I have had it was enough to make me forget for a moment about the wool that had just been pulled over my eyes.   THIS IS NOT GOOD BBQ - IT IS OVERHYPED DO TO Guy Fierri  Not sure how so many give this place 4 stars or more. Stating think most people have never had great bbq or maybe the standards are a bit lower than mine."}
{"text":"How is it that I am just now getting around to reviewing John Mull's?  Oh yeah, because I just could not decide on 3 stars or 4.  I am going to go with a 3 star rating because this place I found to be average.  It took me a while to actually get here because they close so doggone early.  They close at 6:00 and I don't usually make it to the area from work until nearing 6:00.  So I usally have to bypass it.  And Saturdays are just too busy.  Sundays they are closed.  I did make it in one time though right before closing time.  I placed my order for a plate of brisket with baked beans and macaroni salad.  The beans were good but not extraordinary.  The macaroni salad was really good.  I am not alway a fan of macaroni salad but I ate this and wanted more.  As for the meat of the plate, the brisket itself, it was good.  Tender.  Flavorful.  They gave me a pile of it on top of a dinner roll.  I was disappointed that it did not come with BBQ sauce.  I came home and put some sauce from The Bear Pit (see review) on it.  That made it so much better.  I saved some of the meat for the next day.  There was that much of it.  With the amount of food I received, I felt the price was fair.  The reason they don't get a 4 star rating from me is the operating hours (which I understand and respect given they are in a residential neighborhood).  And the food, while good, it not amazing.  I would like to go back and get some of the fresh meat (uncooked) from their butcher side of business."}
{"text":"If this is not the best barbecue in the Las Vegas area I would be completely shocked. We decided to hit Road Kill Grill yesterday right before heading to the drive in movie theater that's less than 2 miles away. At 5:45pm 15 minutes before closing time there was still a pretty big line that did not end until several minutes after closing time.  During the entire wait the staff of the restaurant and the awesome owner were gracious and kind to every one of the patrons. They took the time to ask and remember each of their names during the ordering process. They also inquired to where we were from and engaged in friendly banter. This is the kind of service you tend to expect living down south but in Las Vegas it was a rare treat. It was comfortable in the 90° plus Las Vegas heat because there were plenty of misters to keep us cool. Being from the deep south near Atlanta I like to think that I know barbecue. This place has the most authentic southern feel of any barbecue place I have been since leaving the south. Loving my piggy I ordered the two meat plate with pulled pork and rib tips with an order of collard greens and the homemade mac & cheese. The pulled pork was delicious with deep smoke flavor and a fantastic moist texture. After trying it dry I added some of the spicy sauce and it was palate nirvana I was NOT disappointed great flavor and spice while no single ingredient overpowered another. Next up was rib tips even though it was the end of the day the tips were still moist, tender and delicious. I then moved on to the collard greens without which were not only cooked to perfection they were also seasoned well with none of the normal bitterness you would find. Finally I moved on to the Mac & Cheese which was beyond fantastic creamy smooth and delicious. All in all I will be visiting this place over and over and over."}
{"text":"Out-of-the-way meat market/BBQ joint in North Las Vegas featured on Drive-Ins, Diners & Dives. I always try to search out one of Guy's joints. Search is the key word for this place, hidden in a residential area. The owner can usually be seen in the butcher shop showing off his knife skills. Full BBQ menu, I went with the hot link sandwich (a whole link on the roll and another sliced up on top), with a side it was definitely a meal. No inside seating but plenty of covered seating outside. Well worth the search!!"}
{"text":"Saw it on the food network and decided to give it a try! The line was long but completely worth it ! The beans were amazing! Corn bread was fresh and tasted amazing! I had a half a chicken plate and the chicken was very fresh and well marinated! When we arrived they were skinning an animal and it was great addition to the environment ! Employees were so kind and very funny! I would recommend it to anyone who lives or visits the Las Vegas area! Totally worth the drive off the strip !"}
{"text":"I just love the food at this place.  It bar far hands down the best bar b que i have had. Everything made fresh, and so juicy and tender.... mmmmmm"}
{"text":"I had the pulled bbq sandwich, cole slaw, and some of the sausage or kielbasa.  The black guy serving the food was super generous giving me some of the sausage to try even though I only asked for one piece to buy because I wanted to try it.  Love him!  The lady with him didn't seem as friendly but Ok.  My boyfriend had a brisket sandwich and macaroni salad.  The macaroni salad was pretty good but the coleslaw was weird- I usually like coleslaw but this was kinda wet or weak with little flavor.  I loved the pulled pork bbq though.  This was my first time yesterday and it was pretty decent.  I'm wondering what Food Network people had when they came here?  I wish my sandwich had more sauce or they gave me sauce on the side btw."}
{"text":"lol - If you're reading this.  To even contemplate a choice between this place and another - would be tantamount to trying to decide whether you should sleep in heaven's bed or on cold concrete flooring. There is no choice to be made.  Road Kill is second to NONE!!!!!    This place is the epitome of true BBQ.  There are no words in our vocabulary to describe the ecstasy your mouth will experience when your taste buds meet the pulled pork, tri-tips, ribs, chicken, sausages - Lord have mercy on your soul.   For sides - my favorite is mixing the beans with potato salad.  Dios Mio!  The only suggested change I have?  The bread - they need real corn bread.  Easy and inexpensive to make.    Otherwise - what are you waiting for!  Go!"}
{"text":"Brisket is PERFECT! Tender, tasty and ample portions. We had leftovers for 3 days. I serving could easily serve 2 people. The collard greens, baked beans and rolls were good too. The chicken is flavorful and moist to the bone, and the rib tips were flavored perfectly with an excellent chew. The male employees were cute too."}
{"text":"Excellent place to have bbq ribs and I love their hot links!  Affordable with big portions."}
{"text":"Some of the best BBQ I have ever had. The mac and cheese was also really good.  It may be a drive from the strip but well worth it."}

{"text":"My nephew and I haven't been there yet, but this certainly sounds like a road trip in the making!!! Can't wait, hope it's as good as Salty's barbecue in Bakersfield!"}
{"text":"This is a gr8 place to eat if you really want gr8 BBQ , My husband and I got to the place a little late but they where sooo nice to us the Servers where the Niceness people You want to meet . FOOD delicious , I highly recommend macaroni and cheese, Briskets mmmmm. The owner even took the time to come and meet us (Nice). If you are a local you need to really get there . Thanks for the wonderful experience we are Thankful and blessed"}
{"text":"Amazing. If you want real BBQ come here.  Everyone is friendly and always on top of things."}
{"text":"The nicest staff, newly renovated patio dining area, and huge portions.... but the food is what is so brilliant. Now they are serving \"Burnt End\" Ribs... and they are the most amazing meaty morsels you'll ever taste. This place rivals the great southwest Texas barbeque places I've been to! I must also mention that the macaroni salad is about the best I've had in my life. So many times a restaurant will use way too much mayo and it's \"soupy\" or it lacks flavor... this place makes it with the right consistency, flavor and texture. Just mouthwatering. The cornbread is also amazing...  and I am not usually a cornbread guy, but theirs is the best! I could go on, but you get the picture. Just go!"}
{"text":"The peach cobbler is delicious!!! Great service for great food.  I first visited the butcher shop and they were packed. They didn't have what I needed, but made a suggestion, which turned out right on. Then we purchased food from the stand outside. The peach cobbler was the BEST. The only place for the \"QUE\"."}
{"text":"Wonderful staff and they bend over backwards to meet your needs. From feeding my family to feeding my dog they pay attention to detail. It's best to call in your order but if you don't mind waiting and engage in fun conversation it's a good time."}
{"text":"The BBQ items are good, but the sides are excellent. Be prepared for long lines on the weekends."}
{"text":"This is possibly the most unsuspecting restaurant in Vegas.  It is smack in the middle of a residential neighborhood and looks more like a ranch versus a place where you can buy meat and great BBQ. When I got there the line was ridiculously long BUT they did have free beer to help the time go by (KUDOS!). John Mull's has the BEST BBQ in Las Vegas! I moved to Las Vegas from Tennessee a few years ago so I am well aware of what real deal BBQ should taste like.  This place definitely reminded me of Memphis BBQ and was, dare I say, even better than what you can get in downtown Memphis.  Everything down to the sauce was delicious. My only gripe would be to serve some type of Texas toast or cornbread versus a big roll of sandwich bread. I wasn't a huge fan of the cole slaw either but everyone else in my family loved it.  Try the pulled chicken and potato salad. They will change your life!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, it's like eating in your  friendly neighbors back yard. Employees were friendly and helpful. Food was delicious ! You get a lot for the price."}
{"text":"This was a hidden gem decades ago, now it is really busy due to the barbecue. Same family owns the butcher part. Still the best butcher in town I think. I have been going there over 15 years. They provide quality meat and product. Very friendly, many of the same customers go there and have been for many of years. This place is still a gem but most people go for the barbeque which is awesome but haven't realized this is an awesome butcher also. I really highly recommend this butcher."}
{"text":"We used them for catering a staff lunch a few months ago. I went to pick up the order and everyone was very friendly and it was an east process. We had brisket, pulled pork, beans, Mac and cheese and rolls. it was probably the BEST BBQ I have had in Vegas. I was surprised to find they also butcher there. I probably should have guessed but it was very interesting watching while my order was put together."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best BBQ places I have eaten at. The mac and cheese is the best I've ever had and could possibly be better than sex..... yes, it's that good. Lip smackin' good... that's what she said :)"}
{"text":"I'm no expert on what \"Southern BBQ\" should be. I only know what tastes goods to me.   Talk about fantastic food.   Baked beans with terrific flavor and a hint of spice/kick.  And excellent pulled pork and brisket.   Delicious food and terrific fun folks working inside.  Stop in and have a very casual delicious meal."}
{"text":"By far my favorite BBQ in town. The superb flavor of John's meats will make your mouth water and leave your tastebuds tingling for more. I took my fiancé here for the first time a few days ago and he couldn't stop grinning as he tasted every delicious bite. We each got our own two combo plate which was more than enough food to feed us and we even had leftovers to enjoy the next day. I recommend getting the hot links with the pulled pork. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"As a Las Vegas resident for some time and a regular patron of John Mull's Meats/Road Kill Grill I am remiss for not writing this review earlier.  Some time ago I was researching a place to cater a lunch for some co-workers.  After deciding that BBQ was in order I hit the yellow pages.  Found my way down to John Mull's Meats and gave them a call.  Even though it sounded like they were busy the helpful woman that I spoke to took all the time necessary to set up the catering.  Now some years later, and many, many excellent visits later I can heartily recommend this fine family owned business.  The owner and all the staff are friendly, hospitable, and seem to really enjoy their work.  Oh and the fruits of their labor are delicious!!!  I recommend any of the lunch specials, especially the hot links, ribs, and brisket.  I particularly enjoy the macaroni and cheese and the baked beans.  Try them out for lunch or catering.  You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ I have had since Kansas City in 2002. Came with the wife.   The ribs were outstanding. The smoked flavor of the meat was perfect and the caramelization was spot on. The brisket wasn't cooked enough and wasn't cut against the grain, which also made it tough, good flavor though. The hot links in BBQ sauce was awesome.  The BBQ sauce was a little chunky with onions which I really liked and had the perfect tartness. We also got a pulled pork sandwich.  The pulled pork had a lot of flavor.  The sides were also good. Cheesy Mac and cheese, good potato salad, and the baked beans had a lot of flavor as well as lots of bacon and ground beef. The coleslaw was okay, too much celery seed which made it bitter.   If you like BBQ this is a must."}
{"text":"Found this \"off the beaten path\" BBQ in Las Vegas via the DDD location guide (Guy Fieri) .  OMG!  The BBQ is tender and mouthwatering and simply fantastic!!!!  Had the triple meat plate: hot links, ribs and brisket. YUM! The spicy BBQ is tangy to perfection! Mac n cheese  and cornbread to top it off!!!! Had to go back in and buy more to take homeThe staff are friendly and helpful. We felt very welcome and will definitely return!!! Also a new item , the \"burnt ends\"---don't miss out!!!"}
{"text":"I cannot believe that it took me this long to try John Mull's!  I went to pick up some chicken breasts and pork chops on my lunch hour.  After I placed my butcher order, I got in the line for lunch.  I order the half chicken dinner with two sides and cornbread.  The cornbread was like a muffin top, sweet and moist!  It did not make it back to work.  The chicken was moist, full of smoke flavor.  I am eating the cold leftovers as I write this review.  Still delicious!  My first side was the collard greens. Cooked perfectly and not too salty, the greens were mixed with delicious pieces of bbq meat.  My second side was the green beans, again mixed with pieces of meat.  It also had chunks of baked potato - DELICIOUS!  I was offered mild or spicy sauce.  The spicy was smoky perfection.  I cannot wait to get home and cook some of the chicken breasts!  Definitely bringing the BF and my friends back here!  They have outside seating that I will be taking advantage of as soon as the weather permits!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! Every time I have their Brisket, Mac and cheese , it's just on point. If you are into spicy BBQ, go check them out , and try their Hot Links, you will not be disappointment! Their Mac is to die for, take it from a guy that dose not eat MAC and Cheese at home or anywhere else's but this place and this place only!!!"}
{"text":"My dad has an odd fascination with eateries he's seen on Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives. I found John Mull's Meats and Road Kill Grill on Guy Fieri's list of Las Vegas hot spots, and I knew it was sure to satisfy us both.  John Mull's is way out by the North airport, about twelve miles or so from the south end of the strip. Needless to say, this was not a cheap cab ride by any means, so I hoped the food would be worth the trip. Their \"dining area\" consists of canopy-covered picnic tables out on some gravel. I'd bet that gets a touch warm in the summer months.  Even at 1:15pm on a weekday, the line to order stretches outside the entrance door, and they only let people inside five or six at a time. It ended up taking about twenty-five minutes for us to get inside, and another twenty before we had food in hand. All of the meats were pre-sliced and sitting in metal warming trays for serving. It makes me wonder why there was such a long wait for food, since the plating involves minimal effort. The guy working the line was incredibly friendly and energetic though.  True to form, I ordered a 3-Meat Combo of brisket, ribs, and hotlinks. For my two sides, I rather brilliantly picked a potato salad/macaroni salad duo.  The macaroni salad had a high mayo content, which the southerner in me always appreciates. I also liked the plentiful pimentos. The potato salad wasn't very different from the macaroni, as if they just used the same base and substituted potatoes for pasta. Similarities aside, I liked the macaroni salad better.  My meat trio had the hotlinks right on top, so that seemed as good a place to start as any. The casings had a nice snap, while the meat inside was very finely ground. There wasn't any smoky flavor that I could pinpoint. Even more disappointing, most of the slices weren't spicy at all either, with just one slice that had any real kick to it.  The razor-thin brisket looked more like deli meat than barbecue. Looks can certainly be deceiving though, because this brisket had a great smoke level and was incredibly tender. The flavors I found were mostly natural beef, salt, and smoke, since they had cut away all of the delicious bark.   I saved the massive spare ribs for last. There was plenty of meat to go around here, that's for sure. The ribs were juicy and cooked just right, with only a slight tug needed to separate meat from bone. I tasted some smoke, but not as much as I expected. Smokelessness aside, the slightly sweet glaze was a great flavor addition.  Eating outdoors is something I'm rather accustomed to, but what I don't enjoy is having to spend the entire time fending off swarms of bees. I had to sacrifice my sugary soda just to get them away from me long enough to eat. My overall impression of John Mull's was that they're definitely lacking in terms of organization. Between the $100.00 worth of round trip taxi time (including tips) and the excessive and unnecessary wait for food, I don't think John Mull's is worth all the trouble."}
{"text":"This food is so good. Like God came down him self and sat at the grill, baked the corn bread,  and put his foot in the Mac and cheese -yes, it's that good, and I'm a very particular eater. I call this soul food because its right in line with how they cook down south.  Best bbq etc in Vegas. I wish I lived closer. I wished they were open on Sundays. You WILL wait in a line outside, it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Was in Vegas for a day business trip and informed my colleague that my only requirement was she take me to a non-chain spot for lunch.  She ended up taking me to the Road Kill Grill and I couldn't have been more pleased.  I asked a local for a recommendation and he said the rib tips.  I got that with the mac n cheese and baked beans....their sides are awesome.  We must have lucked out as the wait wasn't horrible...maybe 10-15 minutes.  The portions are large and food was excellent.  It's definitely worth a trip off the strip to hit up this spot."}
{"text":"Finally made it a priority when visiting sin city. For so long had this place bookmarked and realized Sundays the place is closed. Luckily the wait was not too bad or so I assume as I've seen videos of how busy this place gets.   The atmosphere of a ranch style picnic area for dinning gives a unique experience from any bbq joint i've visited. Although it was a chili afternoon the heaters kept us warm as we eat our dinner.   Everything was of my enjoyment, however the ribs and the cornbread are what really will get me to come back. The mac n cheese was good although I would have enjoyed a much more cheesy version as this one was more on a creamy side. After ordering I asked for two extra rib pieces and surprisingly I was not charged for those extra pieces. The staff here is very polite and friendly from the moment you walk on the premises. I will definitely be coming back when I am back in Vegas."}
{"text":"Brisket, Pulled pork, Ribs, Mac n Cheese, Beans and Corn Bread!! My usual favorites!!!  Got a 3 meat plate, was around 16$ with $1 drinks! Great price, fed 2 people and had left overs!  Overall everything was good with great flavors, I just wasn't a big fan of their ribs or corn bread. Don't get overwhelmed by the line, it's always huge, but it goes by fast. I really wanted to eat it there, so my food wouldn't get soggy or cold by the time I got home, however there were A LOT of bees outside, by the tables, they got inside my drink and were going towards my food :( Maybe it was bad timing. We had to leave and eat it at home lol Ahhh I'm craving it again!"}
{"text":"Got the 3 meat deal (rib tip, brisket, hit links) everything was good. The peach cobbler was ok. Will be back"}
{"text":"This is some good bbq!!!  The collard greens are amazing!!!  Be prepared for a long line though.  I haven't actually bought meat from them, but we had the pulled pork, the brisket, well everything.  It was all so amazing!!"}
{"text":"Having tasted BBQ from around the country, I understand what \"Southern\" BBQ is: cheap cuts of meat and cheap ingredients that the lower income population had available to turn and twist into something good.  I went here based upon several 5-star ratings, but I just wasn't excited about this place.   At around 5pm on a Tues, I ordered the tri-tip and pork ribs combo, with mac-n-cheese, can ice tea, spicy sauce, cornbread disk, about $15.93+tip.  The trip tip was a bit fatty, it did have a thin smoke ring, and maybe a 6oz portion.  it was cooked through, no pink.  Maybe it had sat for a while in the warmer, maybe not, but I was surprised at the fatty bits.  Usually, slow cooked tri tip has none or very little.  The three or four pork ribs were appropriately moist, but all the meats were bland enough to need the BBQ sauce.    The BBQ tomato sauce was ordered spicy, but needed more heat.  Thick, not watery at all.    Mac-n-cheese, looked like they're using a cheese that dries up after warming, tasted like they use Oxaca style, so not much cheddar or velveeta detected.  Noodles were done well, most were whole.    Cornbread was moist and buttery, needed no sauce or additional garnishment.    So, in reading so many recent 5 stars, I'll try again in a little while, to see if I just had a mediocre day or if I ordered the bland stuff."}
{"text":"Took my dad and brother here and they couldn't believe what it was when we showed up. right in the middle of a neighborhood and outside grill.  We got some brisket sandwiches and mac n cheese. Got a lot of meat with the sandwich and it was cooked perfect and tasted great. the mac n cheese was one of my favorites of all time.  cant wait to comeback"}
{"text":"All the reviews for this place are for the hot food.  Which is fine.  What you need to know is that the meat counter serves up some of the highest quality meat you'll find.    We will not leave LV without getting a couple of pounds of the house smoked bacon, and some bones for the dog.  The beef is great too.  We had some Ranchera style meat that grilled like a dream.  Get some BBQ, but don't miss the goods on the other side."}
{"text":"I write this quick review as I sit in the parking lot trying to not tear open my container, because it smells so good!  Food is fresh so fresh you might have to wait for certain meats but, its definitely worth the wait   I came at a good time so I avoided \"the line\" which came shortly after I placed my order..the inside can get a little cramped but orders move out pretty fast.   I'm sure I'll be back just judging off the smell I ordered the 2 meat combo tip/brisket mnc &baked beans   I had to have a quick taste of a rib tip ...I can no  longer say Vegas doesn't have a good place for Bbq   Perfect flavor and tenderness"}
{"text":"I LOOOOVVEEEE BBQ, LOVE IT! And John Mull's delivers the goods every time. I prefer ribs from another restaurant but I have some things here that I crave regularly. Their Mac N Cheese is ahmazing! I think I had it best when we ordered a whole tray at work and it was the best I've ever had. I usually order the chicken and double order of Mac N' Cheese and my sweetie gets the pulled chicken and hot links. The ribs are pretty good, just not my favorite and pulled pork and hot links are good as well. I also like their coleslaw and yams. Oh, be prepared to wait in line for a WHILE. There is usually a looooong line but the establishment takes care of it's costumers and you'll be offered cold beverages while waiting."}
{"text":"If you're no hungry when you pull up to this back  yard diner you will be  once the  aroma hits you!  Ribs and chicken a bit better than beef.  All sides  good. Be sure to ask for bbq sauce if you want it.  Patio seating only  When it's 100 outside  take it home."}
{"text":"I order 60-80 pounds of meat delivered to my house every month. Everything I order is wonderful. I normally prefer the beef cuts. The tri tip, brisket and top sirloin. I normally get the top sirloin as a twelve pound roast then cut my own steaks. The bone in chicken breasts are fantastic!. Vacuum sealed. Great value with a ton of flavor. As a thank you each month they tip me with thirty free eggs. I have been a customer for the past two years. If you need meat delivered for a reasonable price you can not do better than these folks."}
{"text":"I live in Spring Valley and I drove all the way out here to try this place. I needed to get me meat on this last weekend and I've been searching for a good place to source some harder to find items; suffice it to say I think I may have found it. I have to agree with the previous reviewers - this place kicks meat's ass. They cut my order right there in front of me and wrapped it up nice and fresh. Granted - I could get it cheaper at a supermarket but honestly you get what you pay for.  The smoked bacon is very good, by the way and if you spend $40 you get free eggs!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for quality bbq and at an awesome price, you have to visit John Mull's Road Kill Grill. A must every time I am in Vegas. I went here is this place was featured on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives. The food was hot and fresh. The staff was friendly. The line waited for you almost out the door, but I was in an out in under 10 minutes. I opted for the 3 meat dinner w/ 2 sides. I got brisket, pork ribs, pulled pork, Mac & cheese, yams and a piece of corn bread. All for $16! This was two meals for me with as much food as this was. Take my word, go here!"}
{"text":"Good effort..but not all that at all unfortunately. Ribs were dry. Workers were very nice, considering their uncomfortable working conditions outside 105 degree weather.   Presentation on food was not appetizing..I have to mention we did go at the end of the day. So maybe that's why the ribs and presentation we're no good."}
{"text":"My first review of this place was from my buying experience.  This update is for the meat.  Everything we have eaten from this place has been very tough and chewy.  Also, the Korean style galbi has tiny bone chips in it.  I don't know how they do it right at other places, but this place does it wrong.  Stay away."}
{"text":"Great bbq! Its a small place with amazing food! I've been here several times. Tried the ribs, tri-tip, hot links, pulled pork, and rib tips. The mac and cheese is cheesy and delicious. Potato salad, yams and baked beans are great too. And the portions are huge.  They also have a fresh meat counter that sells fresh meats thats great too."}
{"text":"Omg!!! The best BBQ place in Las Vegas hands down! There was a pretty long line but well worth the wait. I had the pulled pork dinner with corn bread and macaroni and cheese and potato salad for sides. The corn bread is literally the best corn bread I've ever had! The pulled pork has the best flavor and they give you A LOT! the macaroni and cheese and the potato salad were so delicious. Every thing was fresh and taste homemade but better! I also had enough food in this one \"dinner\" to have two meals. My fave, I'm hooked!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I'm not big on bbq but that probably comes from never having good bbq... Until now. I like that this place has variety and also side variety. The sides are delicious. One item doesn't over shadow another. Everything melts together but has their own flavor. I hope that made sense. It's about 20 minutes away from the strip. Yelp says that they're open at 9 but that's the shop, the road house grill is actually open at 11. The staff working there are also so sweet every time I come in. I never catch their names but 2 20 something year old women one with braces and the other one has a tattoo on her neck. Seriously, the sweetest ladies ever. It wouldn't be a vegas trip without stopping by John Mull's. You won't regret it.   P.S. ALWAYS GET THE SPICY BBQ SAUCE. ALWAYS!"}
{"text":"Last month we had a party for my Grandpa's 80th birthday in Las Vegas where he lives. We planned almost all of it from Phoenix which was a bit challenging. He loves Barbeque so we looked around entirely online for something good and affordable. We found that this place has great catering prices. We got pulled pork, pulled chicken and hot links, all for under 100 bucks (we made our own sides but they have those too). We called the order in a few days ahead of time and had no issues picking it up. You could tell it was a popular place from the crowd.  EVERYONE LOVED IT! We were continually getting told that it was amazing and people asking where it was from. There was a little bit left over and people were arguing over who got to take it home. I personally liked it as well. The pork was tender and had great flavor.  I wish we'd actually had the time to go there and sit down for a meal, next time for sure!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Barbecue!!!! I've waited an entire year to come back to this event and eat at this bbq stand!!! Some of the BEST BBQ anywhere!!!  I of course opted for the 3 meat & 3 side meal getting Ribs,Pulled Pork,Brisket plus baked macaroni and cheese and macaroni & potato salads. 3+3=$16 well worth it.  Bottled water & Canned Soda were only $1 too!!! The food is ordered at one end and served at another to keep it moving-other vendors have 30+ minute wait because of their disorganized service.  Immediately upon opening my order I noticed I had been given a leg & thigh of bbq chicken and NO pulled pork or Macaroni and Cheese. When I went back to explain they graciously provided me the missing items. and I ended up with an extra piece of chicken. Fair enough for the inconvenience;)  The food was really good. Perfectly cooked barbecue. The ribs falling of the bone tender and moist with a great bbq sauce on the side. The brisket -some of BEST ever!! Tender melt in your mouth sliced paper thin!! The chicken was smoked through but moist and tender plus it had a little kick to it. The Pulled pork was great but was already sauced(personally I prefer adding my own) The macaroni & potato salads were homemade and pretty good but the baked macaroni and cheese was a little overdone and mushy with no crunchy topping to indicate it being BAKED mac n chz and no real cheese flavor.  John Mulls Meats operates a butcher shop in NW Las Vegas and does event catering but this event is the ONLY time they come out during the year so get down to FREMONT and check them out before it's too late. Taste & Sounds of Soul goes on through February 21st!!!"}
{"text":"What a great experience! I love the feel of being right on the ranch. Sitting outside was wonderful. We shared the 3 piece Pulled Pork, Pulled Chicken & Tri tip with potato salad, beans & cornbread. My husband and I will definintely go back. I highly recommend this place if you are a BBQ lover!!"}
{"text":"This place always has what we need and after order in online its always ready for pick up when we get there. Awesome hot links as well"}
{"text":"It's so cool that this place gets what it deserves, and not that it's already been \"plugged\" by Guy Fieri and Diners, Drive-in's, and Dives, but delicious back yard BBQ! Tues and Thurs are Tri-tip served on top of the other choices! The only negative is sometimes your server will take so long getting your order that it almost ruins the trip to come. Very consistent food if you like BBQ ribs, chicken, hot links and great sides like baked beans mac & cheese! In a totally residential area, it really makes you feel like you're in a backyard party!"}
{"text":"I hit some girl opening the door! Not a bad way to meet someone if you ask me;)  Expecting to be in and out in 5 minutes, turns out i got out of there in 30. Which was half an hour before closing time. Met a lot of regulars and some of the workers who were very friendly. I have to give the Brisket and Tri-tips a for sure 10. Juicy and tasty, you just cant go wrong. But thats not all, the Ribs(7), Pulled pork(9), and Rib tip(7) were in my to-go box as well. For my sides it was their homemade Baked beans(8) and Macaroni salad(8).  Not only can you eat there, but you can also shop their Butcher shop for some fresh cuts. They pretty much have everything from beef to goat and lamb!"}
{"text":"I bought a small smoked turkey for $45 dollars here for my New Year party table.  When I got home and opened the \"aired sealed\" package I was disgusted by the rotten smell that immediately struck me. I should have questioned why the turkey was brought from the back in a box and not shown to me. Once I opened the box I immediately noticed that the air sealed turkey was not sealed properly. I am very disappointed by the quality of the meat that was sold to me here."}
{"text":"Excellent filet cuts and delicious tasting sausages. Chuck and his staff are friendly and helpful. Great spot for delicious tasting BBQ at Road Kill Grill."}
{"text":"Love this place. The meat market has the best cuts of meats. The restaurant is well worth the money."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Vegas! Friendly staff and very \"homey\" feel to it. Wish they were open later. Order the 2 meat combo with brisket or ribs with hot links and Mac n cheese!!!"}
{"text":"Best dang BBQ IN VEGAS! If you're here visiting you have to visit this place. I got the burnt ends and they were juicy, for my sides yams and collards greens! Very, very, very delicious! The hospitality was amazing. Super friendly and nice! Just visit this place."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a very funky experience - here is your joint!  It is literally like eating in your friends back yard.  Very cool!  The tables are picnic style and folding style.  The food service setup is something that you might expect to see at a fair - a cart with a hot table sort of set up.  The staff was so super friendly.    I ordered the Mac-n-Cheese and Green beans.  As a vegetarian I am not into BBQ but my hubby is and he said his rib tips were excellent.  Sometimes you just gotta go to a cool place for the experience :)  I did not eat the Green Beans as they had what looked like perhaps pieces of ham in them.  I did eat the Mac-n-Cheese and it was CRAZY GOOD! It was ooey, gooey, cheesy feel great food.  I also had the corn bread and it was awesome!  It was moist with just touch of sweetness.    I would go back and I would take friends.  It is such an awesome dive!"}
{"text":"This place is not your usual BBQ restaurant.  When I first heard of this place, I was really hesitant to go there but curiosity struck me and I had to try it and boy, was I glad I did.  The first time I went, I had a hard time looking for the place, the reason was because I was looking for a restaurant establishment.  This place was amongst the residential houses that surrounded them.  When I finally parked my car (dirt road),I was thinking to myself what kind of place is this?  To make a long story short, you have to try everything they have, from the pulled pork to their cobbler. Sausages and cornbread.  It is absolutely delicious.  I ended up having them cater to a few of my events.  Oh, they deliver too.  Lol.  Friendly staff and great food, that's what BBQ is all about"}
{"text":"A must for everyone who lives in this side of town or visitors to Vegas. Vegas seems like a bit transient place and lots of cookie cutter franchises and not a lot of unique and interesting local places. John Mulls is definitely an exception. It's got character, charming staff, interesting set up. Best of all, the meats are awesome, especially BBQs."}
{"text":"5 stars. Great food with great staff. Out of the way but you gotta stop in for great bbq...."}
{"text":"AMAZING !! make sure you get there on Tues or Thursday for the Tri Tip. Portion are HUGE and food is good"}
{"text":"Good food (a little to hot for our taste but most peoe will love it) wife says beat mac n cheese she ever had. You eat out doors at provided picnic table. Almost always a line because it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"This place is horrible , customer service sucks, people are rude and good luck getting your order. They took my order and gave it to somebody else.  How to wait for my order all over again"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! The food portion is enough for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Everything is so tasty and unique. I woild recommend anyone to go try out the experience, at least once!"}
{"text":"Brisket, try the brisket. Also, don't get white bread fool, get the corn bread. That is the quick review, and really all you need to know before you go.  Now for the long version. Follow the directions on your cellphone to find this place. Yes, it is in a neighborhood, not it is not sketchy and yes the food is great! I say this all from experience. We decided to roll out to North Vegas to get some BBQ that was featured on Triple D. We followed the map and were puzzled as to why we were driving through a residential neighborhood to find some BBQ. We get there and see a nice long line, it's hot outside, the food must be good is people are braving the Vegas heat to get some food.  Waited in line and could not decided what exactly we wanted. The menu is not large, but everything sounds so good. We went with a three meat plate: brisket, ribs and rib tips with sides of baked beans and mac 'n cheese, and corn bread.   The ribs were alright, I will admit I am not a huge ribs fan, but I did eat these and enjoyed them. The rib tips were nice and meaty, but a little redundant on my part for ordering ribs and miniature ribs... The brisket though... dear lord I think I fell in love. It was tender, juicy and full of flavor! They had ran out so I had to wait for about 5 minutes until more was available. They rewarded my wait with a nice heaping portion of brisket and it was worth the wait!  The beans were good as was the mac. I would get both again, but then again everything was real good!  Get the corn bread fool!"}
{"text":"Best bbq place in Las Vegas!!! And super hospitable staff, I will be back most definitely"}
{"text":"I had no idea this place existed.... and its not far from my house. It is also Crazy Good!!!! You def gotta at least try them once! Their hours are not usual for a restaurant so check before you make the trek! And check the weather.... they have outdoor seating or you can just take it to go like I did.  The line was crazy and it didn't really move fast...... It was worth it...   The Hot Link is great!!!! They serve it two ways, whole or cut up with bbq sauce. I didn't know this until after I ordered so I had ordered the Hot Link Dinner (two hot links, two sides and bread) The whole Hot Links were AMAZING! The best I have ever had! I will try the cut-up ones next time. My sides were Yams and Mac and Cheese..... THE BEST MAC AND CHEESE I HAVE EVER HAD!!!!! I would go again just for that! For some reason I had a brain fog and ordered the white bread and not the corn bread. The white bread is just a plain old dinner roll. The corn bread is home made and delicious! They also have brisket on Tuesdays and Thursdays....... Will have to look into this as well."}
{"text":"Strange out of the way Bbq joint. Friedly employees.  Large portions, good bbq and sides. Outdoor pick nick tables available but most carryout."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Always hot! Always friendly people! Very clean! Meats nice and juicy all the sides are yummy!"}
{"text":"Some of the best barbecue in Vegas if you have the chance to get here do it you will not regret it burnt ends hot links pulled pork rib tips brisket tri-tip you name it with a side of mac and cheese and baked beans with some cornbread you cannot go wrong top 5 tastiest food stops and they also have a butcher shop that delivers"}
{"text":"Hidden gem! We were craving BBQ and luckily a friend filled us in on this place. We came around 5pm on a weekday and initially thought we were in the wrong place because it was surrounded by residential homes and there didn't seem to be anyone around. But on opening the door to go in, the place was absolutely packed with people ordering! We then had a hunch we were in the right place for good food. A very friendly gentleman helped us with our order and we took a seat out in the shaded picnic tables to enjoy our brisket, hot links and ribs. I LOVED the baked beans, best I've ever had. We will definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"My family loves this place! We all eat like crazy when we head up north. We've been a few different times, even got lucky and it wasn't busy once!!! There are 2 more popular ways to order a 2 or 3 meat combo. Both come with 2 sides and your choice of dinner roll or corn bread. Here's what we LOVE: Brisket - this meat is so tender and flavorful! Ribs- delish and pretty tender. I prefer them with the spicy bbq sauce.  Chicken- you get to choose white or dark and you can't go wrong with either. The chicken is tender and has a great flavor.  Corn bread- ORDER EXTRA! I usually love honey on corn bread but theirs doesn't need it at all!  Peach cobbler- holy moly batman! I always regret not taking one home.   Is it the most convenient place to dine? No. However the food is fantastic and I've ran into more nice employees than those who aren't nice. The last time I went they were crazy busy because they had been on TV so the lines were LONG. They were passing out waters on the house. I highly recommend you go eat here, NOW."}
{"text":"Good, not great BBQ. The brisket was juicy, but the ribs were a bit dried out. Portions were very generous, so I didn't finish my meal. I might be back,  but I probably wouldn't drive out of my way to get here."}
{"text":"Basically the brisket is roast beef.  No smoke flavor   No smoke ring. Thinly sliced. Was visiting from chicago and made a special trip out while here to try this bbq.  Mediocre at best.   The potato salad and macaroni salad are excellent. So...."}
{"text":"While indulging in their amazing mac 'n' cheese, you might see someone walk up with a freshly killed buck.   Along with serving up total knockout barbecue, they also process deer carcasses that game hunters bring in.   It's another place I can thank Guy Fieri for turning us onto. We weren't interested in eating on the Strip and looked into places Guy had visited in Vegas. He (mostly) doesn't steer us wrong, and he often hits the best places locals love. John Mull's is located in the middle of a suburban neighborhood and therefore pretty tucked away. We wouldn't have stumbled across it on our own.   The food here is stellar. Best mac 'n' cheese I've ever had, and that's saying something. It's the nice big, soft noodles with just the right amount of tangy cheesiness. I absolutely love soul food mac 'n' cheese. Eat your heart out, Kraft.   I had that as a side to the pulled pork with candied yams (also quite delectable) and corn bread. Brandon D. had the brisket and hot link. All the meats were loaded with flavor and the brisket was wonderfully tender. It was a large portion of food and made for a great second meal the next day."}
{"text":"All I can say is delicious bbq!!! The ribs we're fall off the bone tender and the Mac and cheese was the best I ever had. My boyfriend was in heaven he said. We really enjoyed this place. Not to mention the owner was right there working cutting meats saying hello people!!  We will be going back again!"}
{"text":"OMG.....Everything was so good!  Tried to buy everything...they ran out of ribs....probably the best one.  They're BBQ sauce is soooo good...never tasted anything like it.  Oh, the Mac-n-cheese was sooo good, it screamed very homemade  and 'you should've bought more'.  All the meat, I mean all the meat I tried was sooo goooood!  Too much to say and it won't do justice to this place.  You gotta try it!    We're visiting my daughter and family, we're here for 4 more days.  We will sure be back before we leave.  We've tried many different BBQ places and it doesn't compare at all.    All you other BBQ places....GO HOME!!!!"}
{"text":"Super delicious BBQ in the most unlikely of locations.  We shared a full plate with my husband, me and my daughter and it was plenty.  The mac and cheese is amazing, the hot links are great, it is all super tasty.  We decided to have them cater our daughters birthday party.  PIcked up a couple party trays for a great price."}
{"text":"Came to John Mulls looking for great food, and we found it! We purchased two brisket lunches to go (awesome atmosphere) and some bison burgers for later (frozen patties :( ...but still delicious!) Will definitely have my business again!"}
{"text":"Awesome joint! Superlicous links and ribs!!! Get some! Collard greens and baked beans are fabulous also. Plenty of parking. Outdoor eating only... hella hot today... 110... freaking worth it."}
{"text":"Great BBQ!! Great portions for the price! Corn bread is amazing! We got here around 2.... Line was already long!"}
{"text":"I'm all about supporting small local businesses but I was lied to by John Mull employees about something I consider important.  I called once and asked if they carried grass fed, pasture raised beef. The woman who answered the phone said yes so I went down and purchased two steaks. I verified one more time before purchasing that the beef was grass fed and again I was told yes. The steaks tasted great, but grass fed beef has a particular taste.  Feeling skeptical, I called again today to see if they had any more in stock and to get the name of their supplier. The woman who answered the phone consulted with someone else and told me they don't carry grass fed beef, nor have they ever."}
{"text":"This place is some good bbq.    First of all,  this place is in the middle of a neighborhood so your not lost !  Second, parking can get full real fast.  It's also on dirt which you will get in your car unless your wearing booties ( this is why I took one star out ).  Prepare to wait in line,  I came once right when they opened and there were already 6 people in front of me.  Now to the food:  The sides are all good ! I love the green beans the best.  The brisket melts in your mouth and the hot links are delicious.  I also catered here twice on two occasions.  They do not cater on Sunday's so you will have to get a cold order but they give you heating instructions and it still tasted as good the next day.  They even inform you what to order and what not to order (if you do a cold order) which was very helpful.  Overall,  I like this a lot better than rolling smokes bbq (kind of different, but pretty much the same) due to the sides being just as good as the meats."}
{"text":"We went here seeing that is was the best BBQ in Las Vegas according to Yelp. We ordered brisket, ribs, seasoned green beans, BBQ beans, mac n cheese, coleslaw and peach cobbler. If you buy a drink, it's served in a can.  The brisket was tender and juicy, but did not have a smoke ring, and was served sopping in its jus. It was cut with the grain instead of against the grain. The ribs were great, cooked just about perfectly. I wasn't a fan of their mild sauce, but that's just personal preference, when I got some sweet sauce on the leftovers, it was better than the first round. We also had a sample of hot links - excellent!  The sides were great! Seasoned green beans, cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly, the best I've had! The BBQ beans were sweet and some of the best I've had. The mac n cheese had an edge on it and was hands down the best I've had! My husband said the coleslaw was good, but not the best.  We shared peach cobbler, and I found it a little heavy on the spices and the crust had almost completely degraded. Stodgy.  The cans of beverages - come on! Everyone knows BBQ needs big sips! BYOB! I found myself stealing sips from my son after mine was out.  It was perfect weather to dine al fresco, lots of bees though.  Overall it is good BBQ for the price. I think Lucille's is better, but it's also more expensive, so... But wth do I know about BBQ? I'm a CA girl."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff, service is orderly and organized.  Highly recommend.  They are also a butcher shop so don't forget that.  They have some specialty cuts that you may not find in regular grocery stores like turkey butts.  Didn't get the last star because the location is out of the way."}
{"text":"I LOVE going to John Mull's for my meats.  The rib-eyes are always fantastic, and the steak ranchera is always a hit at my BBQ's.  Great crew of people down there, THEY know what they are doing, before you do.  As far as the RKGrill...come hungry, the 2 meat combo puts me into a coma.  Get there early on Saturday's, the line get ridiculous for lunch and supper.  My fav's are the brisket and ribs, with the mac'n cheese and baked beans...don't forget to leave room for their desserts (I never have room...doggy bag). It's well worth it!  Reminds me of back home."}
{"text":"Awesome!!! I will start with the big negative part of my review:  LONG ASS WAIT TIME ! only reason 4 and not 5 stars- that is all for the negative. Positives: Mac N Cheese is the best in our solar system. If that is all you get from there you will be pleased. They offer briskett, pork, chicken-pulled/quarters, links.  There cold sides are sort of commercial- nothing special though. The cobbler is BOMB as well. You can call in your order but it still takes a bit to get it.  The employees are the same for the past 2 years I have been going there which tells me he treats his folks RIGHT!"}
{"text":"First off, this was the best BBQ we've had since leaving the Midwest. We've tried a few places in San Diego, but this really stole the show. We ordered ribs, rib tips, chicken, hot links, and all the fixings. It was really hot when we went and there is only outdoor seating. We got tired of fighting the flies so we took what was left back to the hotel. Love this place and can't wait to go back next time we are in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Best hot links in Vegas and their sides are on point. You can get good BBQ many places in town and each has their specialty. It's the side in my opinion that separates the different joints. This in my mind puts John Mull's meats at the top in Vegas"}
{"text":"The bbq here was unbelievably good!  We had ribs, brisket and hot links. Everything was wonderful, including the potato salad and mac and cheese.  If you come at a busy time,  you will probably have to wait a while,  but it's definitely worth it. The place is very small, so only a few people can go in at a time.  Make the time to stop here."}
{"text":"We have heard of this place and finally stopped for lunch.  Line wasn't that long but still took about 1/2 hour to place order and get food.  We got pulled chicken and pork both were moist but bbq Sauce was just ehhh, would have preferred a little more spice.  The brisket was tender but no sauce? Mac n cheese was pretty good my husband didn't like it tho.  Peach cobbler was soggy. We can now say we've tried it can't see us ever returning tho."}
{"text":"Huge Portions!!! Awesome Price!! And Delectable Food!!  It's in the middle of North Las Vegas but worth the drive!! I've raved so much about this place to people but they hate the road kill name...."}
{"text":"Great BBQ spot, food with lots of flavor. Ribs and brisket were like butter. My son loved the Mac and cheese. Nice outside Punic tables with mist to keep cool."}
{"text":"Today was my first time visiting John Mulls Meats. I ordered to go and I must tell you that when I got home  my taste buds were very pleased to say the least.  I will most certainly be back as I only live about a mile and a half from this fine eaterie. As you can see I only gave John's four stars and I'll tell you why. First of all, I was very impressed with the person taking my order. Very friendly smile, helpful, patient and was very knowledgable in the menu as I explained I was feeding two people. I could see the line of folks ahead of me waiting patiently for their order to be prepared. As I moved further up the line I could sense a strange calm but also a kind of tense energy. I felt as if I was at a wake. All you could hear was the sound of food being placed in the to-go containers. No talking, no smiles, no fun, nothing but a dull silence. I wondered why and I found out when I handed my ticket to my not so eager server. Every person working on that trailer should have been wearing a Tshirt that said \" I Am a Proud Member of the APATHETIC Club of America \" Not a hello, how are you, have a nice day, I hope you come back soon, tell your friends and not one smile.  \" Hey John \" you have a great thing going on here in Vegas and people come from far and wide to enjoy your cuisine, but please start hiring TEAM members who will hopefully understand that customer service with a smile will bring folks back. I really didn't like writing this review but I think I spoke for every person that was in front of me this afternoon."}
{"text":"Our mission in Vegas was to hit up John Mull's Meat because of the rave reviews and because we saw them on The Food Network show. The location was a LITTLE sketchy but once you seen that line you are determined to find out what all the hype is about. And LAWD that line can be brutal if you are standing out in that hot VEGAS sun. There is this adorable older gentleman that was handing out COLD REFRESHING water to the ladies that were in line. Sorry FELLAS!  After waiting in line for a good 20 minutes, we finally made our way to where all goodies were. The guys serving the food were just plain comedy which made that wait in line not as bad as it was because of their upbeat attitude. The food was just exactly how they described it on The Food Network show. Be sure to go there with an empty stomach because you will want to try everything on their menu."}
{"text":"The best meat locker in the area. I am from the midwest where we have MANY of these. This place hits home right on the head! The best brisket, ribs, chicken, lamb.. you name it, they have it! They also have a little restaurant outside where you can get cooked meals and hang out and eat. YUM!!! so worth the line for food :)"}
{"text":"Omg is all I can say! Ate here yesterday and it was AMAZING!!!! The baked beans are so good as well as the mac and cheese! All the meat is seasoned so good I didn't even need bbq sauce! I will definitely be coming back here again when I'm out this way!"}
{"text":"This was picked by a person in my group that watched the Diners, Drive-ins & Dive's episode in which RKG was featured.  Driving there you might think you are headed over to someones house to eat, as it is buried in a residential area.  But it is worth the drive.  The food was really good! I assumed, by the name, that they might have some off-the-wall meat choices in the Grill section to taste.  But, it was just your standard barbeque.   I went with a double meat and two side meal.  The pulled chicken, servers choice between that and the pulled pork, was excellent!  The hot links were good but would have been better, I think, just plain and not doused in sauce.  Disappointed they didn't have collard greens as a side, I chose the Mac-n-cheese and green beans.  Both were outstanding!  Everything was fantastic and the amount of food they serve you is over the top! Talk about needing wheelbarrow assistance back out to the car...  The one major downside is there is no indoor area to enjoy the food.  So, it can be overwhelming to shovel all that food down the hatch while sitting outside (on a patio with shade) in the sweltering heat. (They are nice enough to provide a water misting system.) Dress cool!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Came for the BBQ, was really great. Had the brisket sandwich and potato salad( ok and a hot link) all were super yummy! Will be back for more. Great prices and staff. Can't wait to buy meat from butcher shop."}
{"text":"I drove the 40 minutes from Henderson to check out what my bff raved about when she went there. I ordered two combos for variety; a 2 meat and a 3 meat combo. 5 meats and four sides later, my hubby and I are excited to get hungry again so we can finish the huge portions that fed three with enough leftovers for two+ more servings. There was not a thing about any of our meal that we didn't just love. I wasn't loving the BBQ sauce that's on the side but the meats were awesome and the sides were awesome so the sauce wasn't needed. I will be making the drive cross town again just to get more."}
{"text":"Great place to buy meat from a butcher. Meat is fresh and service great.   The cooked food is impressive as well. Ribs, hot links, baked beans, greens all yummy. Want to try something new?, how about rabbit, buffalo, goat, duck and   Also catering is good and prompt."}
{"text":"Tasty bbq in a pretty authentic outdoor setting.  Get ready to eat at an outdoor picnic table.  The food was easy.  Brisket tender and Mac and cheese gooey and cheesy.  The lower number of stars rated because ordering and paying was quick and efficient.  But when it came to standing in line to get my order filled, it took nearly 30 minutes standing outside, in the dirt with no shade in 115 degree weather.  They don't have their service line set up efficiently.  I've been to a variety of bbq shacks and most have better systems.  In addition while I was roasting in the sun waiting for my food to be plated, I couldn't help but wonder if their heating and cooling systems met health district standards.  I couldn't find a health district certificate/grade posted anywhere but I'm hoping it was at least a B. Good news, our party ate there over 8 hours ago, and no one has reported a problem.  I'll go back in cooler weather, or try their second location with an indoor area."}
{"text":"I have stopped by here several times when in Vegas.  Love the name, the quality and selection of meats. It is definitely worth the trip to find this hidden Las Vegas institution!"}
{"text":"Hidden secret that shouldn't be a secret. Some real good BBQ and great staff. Very old school and fun experience. I highly recommend catering from here"}
{"text":"For someone who only like BBQ on occasion, I am blown away by this place. The brisket and ribs were great (chicken was pretty dry, but didn't bother me) and the sides were THE BEST EVER. The baked beans had ground beef (I think) and were my absolute favorite. They also had the best Mac n cheese I've EVER HAD in my life and the only person who makes better pasta salad is my grandma.  I loved sitting outside on the CLEAN (such a big deal for me!) tables and benches, it really made me feel like I was back home, in the middle of summer, enjoying some home cooked bbq. You can see them cooking the meat in the back, on the bbq and in their smoker I cannot wait to go back or even order some special meats to go! As we were leaving I noticed that we can call ahead for speciality meats (chorizo and lamb to name a few). You better believe I want to try both of those!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, meats are tender and juicy and the environment is great, feels like your walking through your family's kitchen when you are ordering and eating outside in the picnic tables is like a family reunion, or take it home and watch your favorite show or football game,either way the food is amazing"}
{"text":"I'm from Kansas City where we are known for our BBQ so I'm always hesitant to try others.  Was taken here during my visit to Las Vegas and was blown away!  It inside isn't very appealing and rather confusing, but when I got the chance to taste the food, I was in Heaven!  The mac and cheese was the best mac and cheese I have tasted in a very long time. I also got the chicken and rib tips which were also very good.  I'm sure this will become a staple on my trips to Las Vegas and I will also tell everyone I know to stop by as well!"}
{"text":"best ribs in las vegas! the meat is packed with juicy flavour and falls off the bone.  I really enjoyed the pulled pork and Mac and cheese as well. I can't wait to return to try some other meats and sides."}
{"text":"I love how you can see your food before order it. I order the two meat combo links and rib tips. They still gave us fresh food and good customer service even though it was 30 minutes prior to them closing. They didn't have enough ribs ready so they immediately put some more on the grill.  Their ribs tips were good and meaty. Hot links were juicy and drizzled on BBQ sauce. The hot BBQ sauce was delicious. The mac and cheese was very cheesy. The string beans was cooked with smoke turkey and seasoned just right.  The only thing I didn't like  was the cornbread was cold and they didn't offer slice bread with dinners. You truly do get your money's worth. With left overs that taste even better the next day. I will be back again."}
{"text":"I've been to this place like 6 or 7 times. I was addicted for like 2 weeks, until I decided to get some help lol. I had to have it like 3 times a week. I'm happy the addiction is over because I've saved some money, but I'm also slightly sad because this place is really convenient, when I'm craving BBQ.  What I love about this place is that the guys that work there are really sweet. They make me feel so comfortable eating there. They joke and play with me like I'm family. I like that it only took 2 visits for them to know my name and face. I really like that they aren't as stuck up as a lot of people I come in contact with in these Vegas restaurants. I don't have a complaint with any of them nor have I had anything other than perfect service from there.  Now to the food. The very 1st time I stepped foot in this place, I was expecting some awesome BBQ. I knew that it was going to be good food because I had overheard a lot of people discussing how delicious everything is. I was pumped to taste some things.  The first thing I ordered was a 3 Meat Combo for 16.65. Included in the combo was 3 Meats (Hot Links, Pulled Pork and Rib Tips) and 2 sides (Mac & Cheese, Baked Beans). I was pissed when I seen that, although I was getting 3 meats, they reduced the serving size of the Rib Tips, so it was like I was really only getting half of the serving size. I wanted my other damn half, because I was splitting it with my friend, and I didn't think what they had on the plate was going to be enough to fill both of us up. I didn't say anything but I guess the server could see the disappointment in my face.  This is where they won me over. The server asked the guy that was starting the plates, to box another order of Rib Tips. I was extremely happy because it looked as if I had 4 or 5 tips originally. I wasn't expecting him to give me an entire order to make up for the lack of tips in the platter though.  When I made it to my car and opened my container of food, I had a full serving of Pulled Pork, a full serving of hot links and over a full serving of Rib Tips. Not only did we have enough food to fill us up, we had some for later. Can you say HAPPY?  Now to the taste. All of the meats were great. I liked the favor of the meats. The Pork was seasoned perfectly, the Hot Links were warm and spicy, just like I like them, and the Rib Tips were very meaty and delicious. It was all awesome. My friend and I both agreed.  Now, the sides, on the other hand, needed some work. The Mac&Cheese tasted like it had sour cream in it. A friend told me that he think that there's a bunch of different cheeses in it. For the record, it was cheesy, but I have never had cheese to taste as sour as it did. It wasn't good at all. The Baked Beans were really runny. I had mostly juice in the container. There were a few beans at the bottom of the container, and when I did get to them, they tasted pretty good.  I was addicted to that 1st experience, but sadly to say, no other visit, after that one, was as perfect. The food began to take a downward spiral. Every time I would go things would get worse. The Rib Tips became greasy and hard to keep down. The Pulled Pork and Pulled Chicken became really sweet. It had way too much BBQ Sauce in it and it was only lukewarm. As a matter of fact, most of everything was only lukewarm.  I'm very disappointed in the place because I was 85% satisfied with the food and 100% satisfied with the service. Now I have to find a new BBQ Joint. I know that anywhere else I go, the service will be nothing compared to this place. Before I switch BBQ places, I will give them another chance though. I'm looking forward to trying again after I've given them a couple months to cool off. I think I was going too often. I guess no one can be perfect every time...  I have added this place to my \"You Once Had Me, Can You Get Me Back\" List."}
{"text":"Always amazing and delicious. Worth every penny. The staff is nice and the food is always good. We've taken it to go and eaten there and it's been good both ways. They do special events too and that's pretty cool and the food is good too."}
{"text":"This was delicious I enjoyed my combo platter the best barbecue food I ever had I will be coming back for more. I had also preordered my smoked turkey for Thanksgiving."}
{"text":"Trying not to be a hater but I'll get straight to the point. It takes wayyyy to long to order and get your food their process is very inefficient I'd say it took me an hour to get in and out. Food quality is mehhh Rolling smoke in Las Vegas dances all over this place. One the bright side chicken was very moist green beans great but the ribs a little dry. If you want awesome bbq try Rolling smoke that's my opinion. Cheers!"}
{"text":"This place is soooo good. I haven't found anything on the menu that isn't bomb!!!! Meats are always delicious, just wish we lived closer so we could eat here more. We make it a must stop every time we come to Vegas. Just tried the burnt ends.......IS IT MY BIRTHDAY?!?!"}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped in yesterday, tue 17th 2018 april. I ordered the beef rib dinner and my friend ordered the 2 meat, brisket and pork ribs. Was rather disappointed after all i had heard about their bbq. My rib was tough and i found vey little meat on it. The rib tasted more like it had been  steamed vs actually cooked on the grill. I and my friend are from Texas and this just seemed to be sub par at the best. The brisket was ok but I have had better. My friends ribs were also tough and chewy. Just was not worth the money that was spent. Ribs should be falling off the bones, i should not have to wrestle it off the bone. On the plus side i ordered a brisket to cook for New years and it was great and value was awesome!!!"}
{"text":"It's a somewhat limited menu but they give you good portions. Don't go there if you're looking for a hot dog a hamburger, or a steak or even a beer. Side dishes are also very high quality.  For three of us, we dropped $52.  The hot link (got  it sliced) it was very good the burnt ends were very very tender. The cornbread is a special shape; it's very sweet and it's top notch; almost a dessert bread.  Typically we wait outside in line for between 10 and 45 minutes. You enter through the massive door into the stations where they fill your order . Then as you pass through you'll notice (on the right) you can buy eggs and various meat cutter products. I'd recommend trying there spicy BBQ sauce don't forget to grab a couple of waters and head outside and enjoy your barbecue. Some days they also have a food serving trailer which cuts down on the lines. It would be nice if there was a draft beer or two option to be ordered (as beer would really go well with this barbecue), but I understand that you can bring your own.  Watch the hours that they're open before you go and if you can't get there to the location on Thom, don't forget they have a location at the shotgun /archery section of the Clark County Shooting Complex."}
{"text":"Good barbecue for the seating area reminds me of a good old fashion backyard barbecue all definitely love to take my wife and kids there to eat"}
{"text":"I would give it NO STARS if I could because we never got to eat.  We We came early on a Friday, and waited in a line that did not move for 90 minutes.  A guy that took our order kept telling everyone the line would speed up shortly.  It never did.  Finally, we decided it wasn't worth it because after 90\", there were still 16 people ahead.  We ended up going to In N Out nearby, which never disappoints.  They must pay that clown on TV to say good things"}
{"text":"Awesome place. Great service.  Worth the wait!  Had a great service on Memorial Day. Check it out"}
{"text":"My husband both had an amazing dinner there. I had the pulled pork, he had the brisket and great sides. We also grabbed steaks to bring home and cook. The service was outstanding, food was awesome, and the meats were so much better than the grocery store ones. I will go back again, soon"}
{"text":"Whenever I go to Vegas, I always try my best to meet up with my WoW bro. To reward my effort, he usually takes me eating outside the strip and showing me the world is not just made of warcraft and gambling. This time, we were on a quest seeking THAT legendary BBQ in the hood (because we all know BBQ murlocs and gnomes are not edible)!!   This restaurant was definitely unique because it was hidden in the middle of a residential area. I would have never found this place if it wasn't for WoW bro. Apparently it wasn't that hard to find because Guy Fieri featured here on his Diners Drive-ins and Dives show.   The line wasn't super long but there was still a wait. They also had their merchandise on display to sell if you are a hardcore fan. They even branded their own water bottle.   Slave girl got 3 meat combo and I got beef rib dinner.   We picked brisket, pulled pork, and pork ribs for our 3 meat combo. It came with 2 sides so we picked mac n cheese and baked beans. Oh man, everything was so freaking good. I liked the brisket the most, it was juicy and packed with smoky flavor.  For my beef rib dinner, we picked collard greens and chillies as our sides. That chillies was sooooo tasty I could probably eat 2 more cups by myself! After about 20 minutes wait, my name was called to pick up the beef rib. I got this huge foil tray and I was like, huh what did I just order? Omg, inside was one single beef rib and it was literally the same size as my hand! The meat was tasty and juicy, I actually finished the whole thing even though I was pretty full already.  WoW bro, you did it. This was the best BBQ ever and I don't think I can have any other BBQs anymore. If you are in Vegas, you have to check this place out."}
{"text":"Well....been there...done that.....will do again when in Las Vegas. I watch Diners, Drive-ins and Dives regularly. This place was one of the stops. I have been waiting and plotting our trip since seeing it on the show.   First off - review is for the Grill portion (the meat shop was so packed couldn't get in to look around. Have to come back when its not a holiday)  Our experience began by getting out of the car and being lured to the counter by the delicious smell of BBQ. Once there we enjoyed a positive and amusing ordering process with the easy going gentleman behind the counter. He assisted us with choosing between tips and ribs with a flip of the coin. On to get the food and eating it.  The food: we ordered (2) three-meat plates to share among 4 people. we ended up with hot links, brisket, rib tips...and with mistake ended up sampling pork ribs. Green beans, Mac and cheese, cornbread were the sides with peach cobbler for desert. (we have to admit...we didn't finish in one sitting)  Brisket - on point, fantastic, melt in your mouth, perfect Hot links - not too spicy, good texture, firm (youngest, who is the pickyest eater, could not stop eating it) Rib Tips - good crust and fun finger food (my favorite) Pork Ribs - fall of the bone, melt in your mouth (wife's favorite) Green beans - yes, southern style with meat chunks, soft but not mushy Mac and Cheese - another hit with the family, even the picky eater Peach Cobbler - it was okay  Couldn't resist buying a t-shirt to take home.  Summation: You have got to go and experience. The smells, the positive and engaging staff, and the food!"}
{"text":"The Brisket and pulled pork were my favorite. Tried the ribs and cut up hot links in the sauce and it was not to bad. Huge portions and tasty baked beans. When I got home to dig into my Mac and cheese, I opened the plate to see Mac salad instead. I was pissed because the Mac n cheese looked so good. I drove kind of far and did not want to go back."}
{"text":"My fiance and I were in Vegas for a few days and we really wanted to go here after seeing the restaurant features in a rerun on TV a few days before.  It isn't as tricky to find as the reviews on here made us believe.  There are clearly marked signs of where to go, it's just kind of awkward to turn into someone's back yard to go eat lunch.  Anyway, the staff was very nice.  We had a good conversation with them while they prepared the food.  This was probably my favorite service while we were in Vegas.  As far as the food.  We got the 3 meat platter with sausage, brisket, and pulled pork.  For sides, we got mac n cheese and baked beans.  Sausage was as good as advertised, very tasty.  Pork was also terrific, little bit of spice and very enjoyable.  Brisket didn't tickle our fancy, but we aren't really brisket people.  Mac n cheese and baked beans were both very good.  The one platter was more than enough for us to share.  Seriously, the portions are huge.  Great value.  The main reason that I gave this place 4 stars was that they didn't make their own sauce(s).  I saw them using big jugs of Sams club BBQ sauce on the ribs.  There's something to be said for how good this place is despite not even making its own sauce.  I know, it started off as a butcher shop, so the main emphasis of the place is on the meat, not the sauce.  But sauce is a big percentage of barbecue.   Very good place to go.  If you've got a rental car and want to spend a little time off the strip, this is a really easy drive for some good food.  I definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best meat market in Las Vegas...  Except for the beef ribs.  Barely any meat on the slab we bought. Stick with the beef short ribs. They are the best we've ever had.  That being said, the bacon, steaks (all types), and sirloin burger are outstanding!   The crew is very friendly and accommodating with everything cut and trimmed to the size you request.  So glad we found John Mull's!"}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp,  we discovered this place and wow, we are happy we did.  When our fav BBQ place in town closed it doors, we were upset we'd have to settle for Lucile's for some brisket and ribs.  This place is way far from us, we live in Henderson, but it's worth the drive.  Real backyard BBQ feel, awesome friendly service and the food is amazing.  The mac and cheese is hands down the best I've ever had.  The brisket, tender  and amazing, potato salad, sweet potatoes you cannot go wrong.  The portions are HuGe and the prices are competitive.  We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Bomb....looks a bit seedy from the outside...it's hidden in a residential neighborhood...but it is fantastic....go on a cool day as it's outdoor seating"}
{"text":"I grew up down the street & never knew this place existed, but I wish I did!  My sister & I wanted to pick-up food for the family on a Saturday afternoon. We tried to order pick-up to avoid the line, but they didn't take phone orders on Saturdays.  This location is in a neighborhood & you probably wouldn't notice it unless you're looking for it, but you'll see the \"Road Kill Grill\" sign. You park your car in the dirt. You can see there is plenty of outside seating & it seems fun to eat your food there because it adds to the experience.  We went in line, which seemed to be very long. They were giving out samples of their ribs & it was SO good that we decided to wait. We were worried that it would take more than an hour, but it went quicker than I thought. We were given menus to look at & someone wrote our order on a ticket outside while we were waiting.  They were allowing a group of people in at a time inside & I noticed people who weren't too far ahead in line leaving with their food by the time we got to the front. Once you're inside, it's basically like cafeteria set-up. They take your ticket & put your order together while you pay at the end.  We got our orders for the family & brought it home! The combos gave us the opportunity to try more & share it, plus it seemed like a better deal! I thought it was a good price for what we got & everything was delicious!  A lot of people raved about the cobbler. I'm not into cobbler, but I think I'll try it next time!"}
{"text":"picked up a nicely trimmed cap top sirloin, few butchers know what it is nevertheless prep it, primal rib, and hanging tender.  the best part, after some hefty drinking, enjoying a hotlink sandwich at their patio under the misters in 106 degree weather!"}
{"text":"Came here again and things were much different than the last time! The line for food was outdoors and lasted an hour. However, the weather was nice and they gave out free water and rib tips. The food was amazing and they got our order right this time (: the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because of the wait time, but I knew it was worth it!"}
{"text":"While it can be hard to find good BBQ in Vegas, this spot is always a sure bet for good BBQ.  It has all of the meat selection that you would see at a typical BBQ joint; ribs, pulled pork, brisket, rib tips, hot link sausages, and chicken, among others. They also have a lot of the standard sides that would be at this type of place; cole slaw, mac and cheese, baked beans, potato salad, mac salad.   I mostly get the ribs, brisket, mac and cheese, and cole slaw. The ribs are always meaty, seasoned well, and juicy. The mac and cheese doesn't taste like it is made with velveta or some other processed cheese. You can taste the cheddar and it is both stringy, creamy, and exceptionally good. The cole slaw isn't overly sweet and it has a nice non-overpowering peppery taste to it. While I don't always get it, one of their cups of peach, apple, or cherry cobbler is a good ending to a good meal. Their cobbler selection isn't out of this world like you would get from a cafe or bakery, but it is coming from a BBQ joint and it does it's job of rounding out a good meal.  It doesn't matter if you get the single item dinner meals or the 2-3 meat combo dinners, they always load you up with your selected meats and sides. I almost always get their food when the grill opens up at 11:00 am, and I will stay full for the rest of the day.  My only minor grip is that their brisket is pre-sliced super thin and sitting in a juice/broth bath which makes it dry sometimes.  The word is out on this fine establishment, so expect a line when you get there almost any time of the day. Even with the line you will not be disappointed, and you will be looking forward to going back again for some more awesome food."}
{"text":"Just ate the best tasting brisket I have ever had. The helping was huge and the sides were nice and tasty. When it says picnic style, they mean it, as you sit at picnic tables on a dirt floor under a make-shift canopy. Normally, this lack of amenities would lose a star on my rating scale, but in this case I think it just added to the experience. When we starting taking a pic (since we only knew about it from a feature on it on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives), the owner came over and asked us if we wanted to take pic under the one of Guy - the owner was a nice guy himself. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars was because the line was a bit slow moving and we would have loved to be able to get a refill on the beverage - or at least a shorter line to buy another, but we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We came here with my parents on a trip to Las Vegas. Seen it on DDD. The bbq was pretty good. I especially liked the brisket. My dad thought the food needed more salt. We ordered the brisket, ribs, sausage & chicken. For the sides, coleslaw, potato salad, baked beans, collard greens & green beans which were all good.  It was a lot of food for the 4 of us.   On the way to the bathroom in the back is where all the cooking was done...by one man! He was so friendly and kind enough to open up all the grills and show me what was cookin'!  What made our visit here the most memorable was these big 4x4's delivering what seemed to look like fresh hunted deer being off-loaded right in front of the eating area!!!WAY COOL! (But so sad for the deer ) Fits the name perfectly!"}
{"text":"Alot of folks say this and that but this food is the truth.  These cornbread cakes are to steal for the meats were tender no sause needed. Super BOMB"}
{"text":"Some of the best BBQ I've had and I've had a lot from almost everywhere that claims to be great. Met the owner, talked for quite a while.  John is super and honest. Bring your appetite, I had the 3 meat dinner with ribs, pulled pork and brisket with mac and cheese and baked beans.  Way more than I could possibly eat.  Ribs are in the top 3 I've ever had.  Brisket was good, not great but good, pulled pork was very good. Baked beans WOW!!!!!  Wife had the hot link and brisket, hot links are amazing. Dining is outdoors, but clean and a great value for excellent BBQ.  If you want BBQ and are in Vegas you definitely need to make the short trip to Johns.  Saw it on Diners, Drive in's and Dive's and I was not disappointed.  Thanks to John and his staff for living up to the rep."}
{"text":"Best BBQ I've had in Vegas! Very rustic with outside seating. I was surprised that I had to stand in line, even though it was a scorcher of a day a lot of people were there. The food was soooo worth it. Misters are set up around the seating, it helps, but it's still hot at lunch time. The macaroni and cheese was among the best I've ever had. It's hard to find as it's tucked away in a residential area, but now that I've found it, I will return again and again."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Vegas. Don't miss the Mac and cheese. Well worth the drive. My mouth waters just thinking about it."}
{"text":"I saw the place on DDD and we just happen to be in Vegas, so I had to try it. It's not the very best BBQ i've had, but in the top 5. We tried everything, meat wise. My favs were the brisket and ribs. They also have the BEST beans I've ever had. The worst thing i had was the chicken. It was VERY DRY, don't order the chicken. This will be my go to place for BBQ in vegas. The only down side to this place is that it only has outside seating. Which isn't bad if you're not there in the summer when it's 110 degrees. There seems to be a lot of flies hangin around, which if I were a fly I'd hang out there too. The day that we were there it was windy and there was garbage flying around everywhere."}
{"text":"Over 30 years now & the food just keep getting better!!!!  The only thing I miss ...it's so big now, the staff (Anita) is so busy you can't get \"any\" personal time! Back in the day she would give my children bread to feed the rabbits. Those days are long gone! Most of the time we leave the family at home and grab some \"DELICIOUS\" food and eat for a couple of days!!!  It's worth driving 30 to 40 minutes or waiting inline for! You will not regret it!!!"}
{"text":"I'd give it 10 Stars if I could...I had the 3 Meat Combo of Brisket/Ribs/PulledPork and added HotLinks cause I didn't want to miss a thing! Everything was cooked/seasoned just right, the HotLinks weren't as 'hot' as I had feared they may have been...the cornbread was the best I've ever had bar none!  The staff and owner were very nice and took the time to talk to us as we're fans of Diners Drive-Ins & Dives and had been trying to get here for a very long time."}
{"text":"The Place seems like it's in someone's backyard. Service wasn't that good...too much going on. Food was descent but nothing great. If u have to go out your way to eat here......Don't!"}
{"text":"To me it's awesome here,the food is amazing. It's a very popular place but still has a mom and pops feel to it. The meats are juicy and the side are just as good. Prices for hot meal are good compared to the portions that they give. I placed an order from the butcher shop and while I was waiting I was able to enjoy some rib tips and mac & cheese. Don't forget to get some peach cobbler"}
{"text":"Truly a wonderful experience! My family and I traveled all the way from Texas, Georgia and California to sample a magnificent meal. Totallly exceeded our expectations. The hot links had the right amount of kick.  Greens, potato salad, green beans, pulled chicken,  brisket, burned ends and dessert were awsome.  My family enjoyed the BBQ and even met the owner."}
{"text":"Watched the episode on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives featuring John Mulls and decided on our recent visit that we'd make sure we ate there....EXCELLENT!  From the Staff/Manager being extremely friendly and helpful to the best brisket, sausage, and burnt ends that we'd ever tasted.  Nothing fancy just the best BBQ!  There is no doubt that on our next Vegas trip this will be one of the first stops."}
{"text":"Great food and even better service. Owner was friendly and welcoming. Had the tri-tip and hot links, Best macaroni and cheese I ever had. Great way to end a great Vegas vacation. Definitely will go back for the Mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Not bad but not great. Lots of Guy Fieri stuff all over the place. I wasn't impressed with the sauces, they kinda tasted like they were sitting neglected in a warmer over night and they added some water and stirred them up a little for the next day. Pretty good prices at the butcher shop."}
{"text":"What a great little barbecue place. The ribs were excellent. Mac & Cheese was amazing. The brisket was quite oily but very good. Definitely would come back!"}
{"text":"I'm an out of towner here on a business trip and was craving some bbq. All I can say is wow from the moment I opened the door.  Brisket was tender and juicy as was the chicken and sausage.  Collard greens were flavorful and so was the bbq sauce.  No roadkill on the menu Unfortunately...lol"}
{"text":"So let's just say I'm a huge fan . I saw this place on food network a few times last week and decided I had to come try it out ... I was able to see and talk to chuck plus I got delicious burnt ends and macaroni salad and the delicious Mac and cheese . The pulled pork and BBQ sauces are epic .. Most of all everyone I've encountered there is Always friendly and man oh man do they stay busy so I think that says a lot .  Our family favorites are the pulled pork and Mac and cheese like I said but I've gotta say I really enjoyed the burnt ends too..  This place only has outside seating but for the price you get awesome portions and a country vibe and delicious eats ..  Plus I am a little partial to this place since it's one of the few places my son will eat the food and ask for seconds"}
{"text":"I've eaten this place on several occasions.  Sever of the golf tournaments use this place for catering and I've gone and ordered food for take out here.  Never have I been disappointed by the staff or the food.  Great place!"}
{"text":"Still the best sweet Italian sausage in town.. perfect blend of spices. Nice people who wait on you. Great experience and I love those bbqed  hot links!"}
{"text":"This place surpassed my expectations. The line was very very long. The staff are great and very friendly. The food was great. Really enjoyed it"}
{"text":"Without a doubt the best BBQ so far and I've eaten a lot of BBQ of all stripes. Aside from the incredible brisket, mouth watering ribs, moist and flavor ridden chicken and the tasty links a special shout out to the cornbread and mac and cheese, must haves. Even the cashier Brenda made life livable with her bright eyes and quick wit.  As visitors from NY we were treated like royalty particularly by the Brooklynite  grill man."}
{"text":"The best in town. Very good food and supports veterans and there needs. He always help us out with our poker run."}
{"text":"New to Las Vegas and got a referral to come here. BEST BBQ EVER. I trade nation wide and have never had anything this good. It's a little different ordering and getting your food but very family friendly. I will be a regular to this place!"}
{"text":"As a native of Las Vegas, I am EMBARRASSED to say that I had never been here before. OMG, their food is delicious. The servings are big and if u cant eat it all, there's much leftover for later :-) The cornbread is very tasty!!! The owner came out to greet us. It was a great experience right in my backyard. Thanks to my sis, Ginger, for surprising me with a good wholesome lunch :-)"}
{"text":"One of our Favorite places to visit in Vegas! All the meats are cooked perfect, they have the best Mac & Cheese, Greens, Beans & Cornbread! My husband & I always get a  three and two meat combo... lots of food but we get to have all the sides we want. First time visiting on a weekend so there was a little line and very hot outside during this month but worth it. Always great service!"}
{"text":"So. My girl comes here every chance she can get when she is in Vegas. We came here for lunch today. Ordered the 3 meat combo and a hot link sandwich. Plain and simple this was some excellent Bbq. With or without the sauce I was impressed. The sides were good. Mac & cheese out of this world in my opinion. Customer service behind the counters great! Kudos to this Resturant. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I visited the Road Kill grill while in the area on business after seeing it on DDD. I had high hopes and sad to report that my expectation were not met.   I'll start with the good: I had beans and mac and cheese as sides. Both were stellar. Beans were nice and smokey and had some ground up meat in it. The mac and cheese was smooth and cheesy and very yummy.   The hot links were also tasty and I would get them again.   Now to the not so good: I also had brisket and burnt ends. The brisket was dry, grey, and tough. Missing was the smoke ring usually evident on smoked meats. There was also a slight flavor of refrigerator. Almost like the meat was from a prior day and reheated for the day I was here.   The burnt ends were served with a watery sauce that got all over my plate. I was expecting sticky and smokey but got watery and salty. These also did not taste fresh.   I would give this place another shot for sure based on the positive reviews of others, but I would avoid the brisket and burnt ends and try something else."}
{"text":"I've been here a little more than I should. If your craving good home cooked bbq but don't feel like doing all the work, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Off the charts.  Delicious.  How can a boiled rib taste so good!   Huge portions.  Really nice staff.  Thoroughly impressed.   A must eat local."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. It truly is a BBQ experience. When you first pull up you park in a dirt lot. Picnic tables all around. The line can get pretty long but the service goes fairly quickly. You give your order at the counter and then walk down to the grill. I love seeing everything being cooked. The smell is incredible. It is a lot of food. My husband and I split the two meat meal and it was more than enough for both of us. The brisket and the pulled chicken are great. The brisket has a great flavor and just falls apart in your mouth. The pulled chicken is smothered in a flavorful BBQ sauce. For sides we had cornbread, potato salad and mac and cheese, all of which were fantastic. I really recommend this place!"}
{"text":"OMG don't miss it!everything is so good no matter what you try you'll love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"No one has reviewed this place as a butcher shop yet. Kinda surprised as it's been around for a long time.   Two weeks ago I was on a frustrated bend to find a butcher. I'm from L.A. and had 4 regular butchers to meet all my odd cooking needs. This was the closest one to my house. It's on an small neighborhood street behind a house. Definitely an off the beaten path find that you'd have to know about and can't really stumble upon.  There is no glass counter- this is very old school meat factory feel. Its not much standing space and it's real plain industrial, but ambiance with a cute glass counter doesn't always equate to the better meats that I've learned though I guess most prefer \"user friendly spots\".  You have someone manning the counter and taking your orders, simple printout listing the meats available and behind them the butcher will bring out big slabs of meat and cut it up to your order. I LOVE that it's a fresh cut for me! We ordered 1.5 inch thick ribeyes for dinner. They are choice cuts, but was nicely marbled just not quite prime- close though. At $9.99 a pound, definitely a decent price for what I was getting- supermarkets charge about that much and you don't have control on the portion sizes and thickness like here.  Cooked those ribeyes up by first pan searing, then putting in the oven. Resting them was a hard time to not cut in and chomp down. Very good quality meat, fresh taste, tender and a nice amount of fat marbling. Liked them a lot- definitely quality is easy to taste that these were not supermarket bought.  They have beef, pork, turkey, sausages, hotdogs, deli meats, smoked items (turkey leg, pork chops, etc.) and also the odd parts of the animal.   When we were there, many of the people standing for their order were familiar with the staff and even with each other. To me this is a good testament of quality that there are loyals buying by the bunches. We had a bit of a wait as there was people before us and one butcher custom cutting, but it's very fun for me to watch the quality of meats everyone was ordering and all looked pretty nice. Someone got beef tenderloin/filet mignon and that in particular was fine quality.  I think this will be the go-to place for when the particular cut matters to whats cooking and when I want the no fuss basic meats. Butcher Block and the like are cool- but I'm not going across town for some good ribeyes that are precut, if I want aged meats or something of the odd family game meats I'll go but John Mulls is where it's at to get all the basic meat needs met AND it's cut just the way I like it. Summer BBQ's will be a whole different level.  UPDATE: Went in today and ordered 2 ribeyes (9.99 lb) and 2lbs of korean style rib (3.89 lb). He mentioned something about the ribeyes are prime and he's giving us free. I thought he meant he was throwing in a little extra meat onto the ribeyes for free- what he meant was our order of ribeyes were free. YEAH FREE PRIME RIBEYE.  We cooked them up and ooooo were they good. We left with maybe nearly 2lb ribeyes, 2 lbs korean ribs for $8.90.  That is the great thing about building a relationship with your butcher I'm not talking about necessarily getting just freebies, but knowing youre always taken care of and really appreciated. I had a great relationship with my butcher in LA nad he would tell me when something was particularly good, he wanted me to sample his new sausage flavors, we would chat about foods and he would give me great suggestions on how he uses the meats. This one seems to really remember and appreciate all their customers- again customers that were in there were on a first name basis and he asked about how we like the BBQ last weekend (See BBQ review) . We are sold that this is above Larrys Meats, Butcher Block and the like. Service, quality and customer appreciation goes beyond and we're definitely going to stop by the weekends for our cooking adventures meat needs. Thanks Chuck and Nita- you guys are awesome!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  They gave everything you need meat wise. I  Look forward to the barbeque everytime.."}
{"text":"Really unique place!  Basically set up in someone's backyard, and you gotta wait in a pretty long line but the staff is really friendly and the food is amazing.   I got a 2 meat combo with brisket and pulled pork. Green beans and cole slaw for my sides. Also comes with choice of corn bread or white bread. . I went with the corn bread and it was really moist and good.  Green beans were a little salty and the brisket was only ok. Everything else I tried was excellent.  I tasted my brothers mac and cheese & baked beans, both were amazing!   Next time I got to try the ribs!"}
{"text":"BBQ is on point and that Mac and cheese is so delicious! They cater our work events at Ed Bozarth Chevy occasionally and they're always a big hit!"}
{"text":"The BBQ is the best I've had since I left Chicago and came to Southern California in November 2013,and could quite possibly be the best I've had period,and I'm not just saying that because it was \"FREE\"on the day I was there on 4/25/2016.Got there 15 minutes before closing and it's an outdoor eatery only and it had been raining all day so I guess they decided to give the food away,the staff was awesome whatever you wanted on your plate or plates they happily gave it to you and each and everyone of them apologized for the weather,imagine that!! This is my new go to spot when I'm in Vegas from now on,hands down the best!!!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out today and we saw it on Diners, Drive-in's, and Dives on TV before moving here! It is in the middle of a neighborhood and has the feel of a family BBQ in your backyard. You sit and eat at covered picnic tables! I got the 3 meat meal with 2 sides (featured in my picture). I chose the burnt ends, brisket, and pulled pork. The burnt end were amazing! I got the Mac n cheese and potato salad that were phenomenal as well! We will DEFINITELY be back!"}
{"text":"Place needs security and a better ordering system at meat counter. I won't pay 15 a lb to be hassled by other customers again."}
{"text":"Great tasting BBQ in the middle of a residential area.  A real treat.  Friendly service and great food in a super casual outdoor setting."}
{"text":"\"Imma fixin to get me some good ole BBQ and was a wonderin if you'd like some too?\" announces my MIDWEST poker bud with a stupid grin on his face.  \"Umm, OK\" staring quizzically at him.  \"Aright then.  Let's get a move on\" he continues.  \"By any chance, did you walk face first into the glass door?\"  I say as I slap him on the back of the head.  And we're off.  Straight to it, John Mull's Road Kill Grill has been featured on the Food Network's Triple D.  Don't hold it against them.  For once, you won't be misled.   IMPORTANT:  This isn't BBQ.  Low and slow?  Nope.  This is grilling.  Marinades, not dry rubs, boiled, then finished over a high heat charcoal grill.  Understand this or be ready for disappointment.  That said, it's tasty for what it is.   The boiled then grilled ribs have a good flavor with a warm heat and pronounced black pepper flavor all the way to the bone.  Tender and good sauceless.  The tri-tip, cooked well done, still retains good juiciness.  Well seasoned and just fine without any sauce.  The chicken, taste like grilled chicken.  Fall off the bone with good flavor.  Alright but not special.  Hotlinks steal the show.  Beefy, juicy, spicy, good texture and a gentle smokiness. Finished on the grill for an even smokier taste.  I can see  why a fellow Hawaii yeep has to buy these by the case to bring home.  No complaints on the mac & cheese, baked beans, and green beans and corn bread, although all are completely unnecessary.  You don't see tigers eating sides when there's meat right?  Tip:  Tri-Tip available Tues / Thurs.    Service makes this place.  Very friendly and welcoming.  A plus when the line is long and they run out of your favorite forcing you to substitute or wait for the next batch.  (It's worth the wait, they will load you up for your patience).  In the end, a solid eatery serving solid food.  So it isn't real BBQ.  All good.  This isn't Texas, Kansas, or the Carolinas.  This is Vegas baby and as the song goes, \"I did it my way\"."}
{"text":"Wow!! What a find!! We heard about this place from our daughter who lives in Vegas. Much to our surprise Guy from the food network had been there as well!! We always look for places he has been cuz he never disappoints!! Lots of food for the price!! Was not expecting it to be in a residential neighborhood."}
{"text":"Really good BBQ joint, meats are very tender, staff very friendly, and the prices very reasonable.  Pretty close to five stars.  I have to say, it's a two star location, in the middle of a residential neighborhood in North Las Vegas.  Expect about a 45+ minute drive from the strip.  Is it worth the long drive?  Personally, probably not for me, but my wife loves the fresh sausages and it's really in my best interest to bring some back home.  For something comparable and a much shorter drive (minus the fresh meats), check out Rollin Smoke BBQ."}
{"text":"This for me is the best BBQ in Vegas!!  There are other places I have yet to try but this place will be tough to beat.   It's the farthest I've ever driven to any food place, I'm relieved it was worth the trip!!!  The food was insanely good, i never had pulled chicken until now, and it was the best thing I ate better than the Pulled Pork if you can believe that.    I ordered the Pulled Pork, Pulled Chicken, the famous Hot Link.  The BBQ baked beans, Mac&Cheese and corn bread were the sides. was awesome!!!  I never said this about any other BBQ place, but the I feel the sides were a huge complement for the main food even made it taste better. Based on my experience, from other establishments, I usually end up having great main dish/mediocre sides and vise versa thankfully that did not happen here.   I only had to wait a 25 minutes in line, so it wasn't to bad.  I would suggest calling beforehand just to make sure how busy it is especially on Saturdays. The price point ($18 for three meats and two sides) was reasonable based on quality.  I've paid that amount from other places and its not nearly as good.   This is one of those you must check out for yourself!"}
{"text":"What's not to love?  This bbq is fantastic and the experience pretty cool too!  Just be prepared - this is not indoor dining.  It's covered picnic tables outside - today is 107 - HOT and still worth it!!!"}
{"text":"On vacation from the UK and this is a must visit place for food - yes you have to drive away from all the glittery crap of the strip, but oh my it is worth it!  Food is fantastic, staff are all friendly and happy to help. We had brisket, tri tip and pulled pork with macaroni cheese, beans and cornbread. Delicious and you won't find anything like it at home!"}
{"text":"Show me the meat!   This is where you need to go in Vegas to get all of your carnivorous cravings satisfied. Yeah, it's a little off the beaten path, but follow Google Maps and you should be A-OK. Don't let the exterior fool you, either, 'cause this place is legit.  Walk inside and you'll be handed a menu and will most likely have to wait in a short line to give your order. Or call ahead and they'll have packaged and ready to go for you. It's basically a giant meat locker with a friendly staff behind a counter ready to chop, grind or whatever else you need them to do to your meat.   So many choices, too! We got several things, but what sticks out in my mind was the sweet sausage. Yeah, I said it: sweet sausage. Make all the jokes you want, 'cause I don't care. It was tasty."}
{"text":"Always get it to go been going here for the last few months. This IMO is the best BBQ spot in Vegas. Irony is there aren't many good ones famous Dave's is \"ok\" but here is good consistent food and service!! I just hope the quality doesnt deteriorate as the popularity increases."}
{"text":"Great Barbeque and UHH--MAAAYYY---ZING Macaroni and cheese! You definitely have to get here early to avoid the mass amount of people waiting in line. We got there and waited in line for about 30-40 minutes and when we got to the counter, the service was great. You can go NOT hungry and you will still order food! I have gone a few times and my favorite meats are the pulled pork and ribs.. but everything is delicious! The dry-rub, slow smoked ribs just melt in your mouth and take you to a happy place! It is kind of pricey, but you have have enough leftovers to make another meal or two out of it!"}
{"text":"Decent BBQ I Like That They Used Real Wood Smoke On There Pork Wish They Did The Same For There Brisket Which They Just Bake In The Oven Delicious Hot Links Ribs Could Use More Seasoning Priced Good For What You Get All Around Good Spot Just Wished They Seasoned There Meat More And Actually BBQ'd There Brisket"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. I think it deserves 4 stars for the food and 3 stars for service. I think the quality and portion size for the price are fantastic. The super stars were the burnt ends, yams and Mac and Cheese. I ordered the 2 meat/2 side entree: burnt ends, pork ribs, Mac and cheese, yams. I also ordered the peach cobbler. I waited in line to order, the line was long but they had their system down and got the line moving quickly. The cashier was super friendly and bonus, they had complimentary cold water for everyone. I thought that was great, especially during summer.   I waited in the second line to get my meal. This line was short but took twice as long - even though the food was already prepared. The guys serving the food were nice but oh boy, they were slow and got almost my complete meal wrong. When they finally gave me the container I took a quick peek while waiting for the cobbler (which I had to remind him about)- they went to dip it up and realized they didn't have peach so they had to wait for the kitchen to bring it. When I peeked at my food I first noticed they had given me macaroni salad instead of Mac and cheese. Easy fix, he gave me a container of Mac and Cheese and told me to keep the macaroni salad. Great, thank you! Then one of the meats was covered by tin foil and I thought, better check that. So I saw brisket instead of ribs. Again, I told him and he gave me a side of ribs and told me to keep the brisket. Super nice that I basically got a one meat entree for free but it was a hassle asking for the corrections because they had already moved on to the next guest.   The cobbler finally arrives and I'm waiting, waiting, waiting after I see them give a few people behind me their cobbler. They see me standing there and still nothing. So I asked an employee walking by and he couldn't do it so he had to basically ask the same guy that had already seen me there waiting and knew why I was waiting.  Either they just had an off day (my husbands meal only had one mistake- cornbread instead of the requested white bread) or they need to drink some coffee and get with it!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! The customer service is out of this world. They have a side where you can buy meat in bulk. Fresh fresh fresh. I had the burnt ends rib tips collard greens green beans and brisket oh sooooo yummy in my tummy!! You must go here. This is in North Las Vegas. You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"I don't recall if I heard of this place from Diners Drive Ins and Dives, or from Yelp itself, but I'm always hunting for a surprising adventure in dining and this served it up deliciously!  I was doubly excited when I asked the local bank teller if he'd gone there and he immediately broke \"business-like bank demeanor\" role play and broke into BBQ fanboy with the mention of their name.  Driving through the neighborhood, we were positive that our GPS was nuts, but then it suddenly appeared!  A tall telephone pole gate, like you would drive through to get into a Texas ranch beckoned us to drive through. There is tons of outside seating near the lot or on the side of the building. They were quick to turn on outside heaters if you asked.  In fact ALL of their employees from the order taker, to the server, to the cashier, to the guys loading, unloading, grilling out back were SO friendly, you felt like you were at John's house BBQing in the back yard.  We couldn't wait to dive in, but if you are more patient than me, you can order it to take home too.  When you get to the door, to the right was the meat counter and the cooked food was to the left.  Both were super crowded, but they are really efficient with getting people through then letting them out the back door.  The gal in front of me was ordering 15 meals and they got her through almost as quick as they got our 3 meals done.    My teen son ordered a brisket (or was it tri-tip sandwich). Doesn't really matter, it was layers and layers of amazing meat slices and so delicious that he wolfed it down!  He was the first one done exclaiming: THAT was amazing!  My tween daughter went straight for the ribs (despite having braces - the meat just falls off the bones!) with mac and cheese and green bean sides.  She silently worked her way through every rib and at the last one stopped midway exclaiming: I'm stuffed!  She never even tried the sides.  I went for the 2 meat combo with Rib tips and dark meat quarter chicken with the cole slaw and potato salad sides.  The rib tips were meaty and so tender that they were easy to sort through.  The chicken was so flavorful and tasty and also just fell off the bone easily!    I took it upon myself to take a few bites of every side.  Mac and cheese was really cheesy - if I got a smaller entree I'd go with mac and cheese because it's enough to make a meal.  The beans were tasty sprinkled with the glitter I call bacon. The potato salad and cole slaw are just as you would hope at a BBQ.  They're made to be a refreshing pause between meat courses both in flavor and texture, but don't distract from the main star - the meat!  Our Three-Thumb Review is 3 finger-licking thumbs up! My teen son loved the simplicity of the food served - just simply delicious!  My daughter dug their bbq sauce to dip her ribs in. It was as magical as the gum illy Wonka made for Violet with a variety of flavors that appeared the longer you chewed it! First sweet and smokey, then a tangy flavor tickled your taste buds which turned into a zing of fire... only the next bite started it over again! I loved the whole experience of the place, slightly scaring the kids with the name of the place, and seeing how many people really loved eating there as well!  TOTALLY worth it!  #ThreeThumbReviews"}
{"text":"Finally checking this bookmark off the list!   I was surprised to see a line waiting to get IN the building...and then of course a line waiting/paying for the food.    Everything is precooked, and sitting in trays waiting for order/delivery.  We finally made it through the wait (20-30min), and was pleasantly surprised to feel the WEIGHT in our food box!  Had to be a couple pounds of food here!  Eva and I shared the 3 Meat / 2 sides Combo ($16): BBQ Ribs, Brisket, Pulled Pork, Mac N Cheese & Potato Salad.  We weren't able to finish barely HALF of the food!  Ribs were excellent! Tender and full of smokey flavor, but ate them dry since we weren't given any BBQ sauce.  MAKE SURE YOU ASK FOR BBQ SAUCE!!!  The Brisket was served wet...just not very tender and missing the smoke flavor I love elsewhere in town. The pulled pork was ok but not mentionable.   However, they EXCELLED in sides! One of the BEST Mac N Cheese versions I've had, with lots of melted cheese and charred bits from the burner! I'd come here again for the ribs and mac personally!  Finished off with the Peach Cobbler...just ok. Kinda soupy/goey without any crust.  Pass!   Be prepared to WAIT!  But the Ribs and Mac will be WORTH the wait...just not the other stuff IMO."}

{"text":"Holy son of a cow...this place gets 5 stars. It was cold and windy today with a long line out the door- but what did John Mull do? They had a big ass bucket of free beers while you waited! We tried the ribs, brisket, pulled pork, mac-n-cheese, mac salad, beans and peach cobbler. I would have to say the brisket and mac salad were my favorite. The free beers while waiting is the 5 star maker :)"}
{"text":"The worst food I have ever eaten... The ribs were dry.. There were flies everywhere around the food while they were serving. I told them I didn't care for my entree and they said they were sorry but didn't offer to give me something else.. Please  avoid!!!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome!  In town from California for family vacation and stopped in. The pulled pork was the best!  Also went to another BBQ joint near Trump but my boys asked to go back to Roadkill because they said it was much better than Rollin Smoke. If you're in Vegas, spend the 10 minutes to leave the Strip and check this place out. You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"The beans are still the best in Las Vegas.  Make sure you sign the petition as the City of Las Vegas wants to move Road Kill Grill."}
{"text":"Outstanding! Went there for the first time yesterday afternoon to pick up some ribeye steaks. Was greeted by the entire staff on the way in, lady at the front of the butcher (didn't catch her name) was extremely friendly. \"everyday is a good day\" she said. I assume she wasn't a vegetarian.....   Chuck cut me two 1\" slabs of ribeye, which I brought home, seasoned, and seared. The result?!? Let's just say my mouth is still drooling from last night. Delicious!   Will definitely go there again and recommend it to all my friends."}
{"text":"I have been waiting in line for Over 1 HOUR. they have 1 person serving dishes and 7 other people walking around with no purpose at all."}
{"text":"Mull's has been on our list of must try places for awhile now. We finally stopped by yesterday, I surprised my husband for his birthday. I was well aware of possible long lines and that there is only outside seating.  Neither were a bother...arrived early and sat close to the water misters. We both ordered 3 meat combos. Brisket, pulled chicken and ribs for me and the hubby enjoyed pulled pork, hot links and brisket. We both got the mac n cheese and he got the yams and I enjoyed the green beans. Everything was delicious!  You can see a lot of hard work and love goes into preparing their food! All the staff were friendly and I can't wait until our next visit!"}
{"text":"Yummy, what can I say more,,, nothing like fancy sit down restaurant , but just a hole in the wall in the northeast... Yes the parking lot is gravel pit and they serve their food in styrofoam, but it is good old fashion bbq... Service was fast as it was after the lunch crowd and a weekday visit.. 2 combo meat meal was big enough for 1 person to have left over, the price was reasonable. The pork were  just enough seasoning, and can add a little sauce , as much as you want which comes on the side... Big chuck of Mac and cheese , and tasty potato salad. Seating is outside, but this time of yr, very comfortable.. Local get your frequent diner card, buy 10 combo meals get 1 free It was worth the drive and I live in summerlin..."}
{"text":"Great ribs and burnt ends but the brisket was watery without flavor. Brother in law had the pulled chicken and didn't like the sauce tasted like catsup. All sides were great having the baked beans and yams. Brother in law had the mac and cheese and said they were the best he ever had. The corn bread was sweet and tasty"}
{"text":"Favorite BBQ place in Vegas! I would come here just for the sides alone, but the pulled pork is on point."}
{"text":"I went here with three of my friends for the first time. They are like in the middle of nowhere, and we thought we were lost. The place itself looks like a ranch! (wait maybe it is a ranch lol) because they butcher their own meat. So you can count on the meat being extremely fresh! Now be forewarned, this isn't a place to come to with a large group of people to actually eat here. You are supposed to order your food and take it home as they really don't have much seating area.  As for the food, wow, I ordered just the hot links sandwich, and the sauced version of the hot links blew me away. The portions are large and the price is fair.  If you are tired of going to Lucilles, Famous Daves, Tony Romas ribs, and other chains, then come here and try this place out! True southern-like BBQ house. Oh and this place was featured on the \"Food\" Network for top BBQ houses in the country by the way!"}
{"text":"I cannot even with how amazing this place is!!!! From their ribs to their pulled pork and everything in between! Their mac and cheese is seriously the stuff dreams are made of! Magical deliciousness and homestyle food!!"}
{"text":"Wow...either all these previous reviewers are liars, getting kickbacks, associated with this place or they are numb to good food. This BBQ shack is anything but what I thought it was! It was featured on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives, so I thought it had to be good. Unfortunately...it is just a make-shift hole in the wall, that is part of a larger ranch style butchering operation in a residential neighborhood. The set up is rediculous too...it gets very crowded in the ordering area.  The employees were very nice, the prices were ok and the side dishes were right out of a hospital cookbook and the BBQ meats were absolutely tasteless. ZERO FLAVOR! No distinguishable seasonings, on anything! They give it to you in a styrofoam container and you eat outside in a wooden seating/standing area. They give you plenty but plenty of tasteless food is not BBQ! I am sorry if I have offended anyone but the ribs and beef brisket was void of any flavor! I can think of 10 BBQ places that are easier to find, more comfortable to enjoy the food and taste like a BBQ joint should."}
{"text":"Had Graduation/Birthday pool party for youngest son @ the Casa. Ordered all the meat and fixin's from Road Kill. Food was priced right and prepared hot and ready for pick up @ the chosen time. Very courteous, friendly and busy. Food was great and all our guests commented on how tasty the food was (most were from out of town). With a little help we ordered exactly what we needed to fill everyone up. Brisket, Pulled Pork, Pulled Chicken, Hot Links with Yams, Collards and Cornbread were all fantastic. Highly recommend to anyone who likes outstanding Southern style B-B-Que or quality meats. Will definitely be going back. Thank You Road Kill Grill."}
{"text":"A really great option for catering. We ordered the pulled pork, hot links, and brisket. It was a hit for our Mother's Day celebration!!"}
{"text":"Excellent real barbecue. No frills, just great barbecued meat. Everything is good. Outdoor seating with no added extras. It is in the middle of a residential neighborhood, so don't worry if you are getting close and think you are lost"}
{"text":"Wow! Who knew this place existed? Tucked away in a primarily residential area, I came upon it entirely by accident. Once you walk in, you are greeted warmly by the super friendly staff. It feels like there's a party going on! The guy behind the counter gave me a rib, so I could \"fill my mouth\" while he got my rib/chicken combo ready. And, by the way, it was more than awesome!!! Thanks to Clarence, who cooked up my food. Try the Mac n cheese and green bean sides too- you won't be sorry. Sshhhh.... Don't tell too many people about this place- it'll just be our little secret, ok?"}
{"text":"Good food, decent prices.  I like the atmosphere of being outside and getting my grub on.  Nothing fancy and if you are looking for stellar customer service, come on, this is outside BBQ food.  Once you get your food you can find a seat and get to eating.  Some people expect such perfection in every aspect of there dining experience.  The best baked beans I ever had.  The best mac and cheese I ever had.  Amazing pulled pork.  Im from the California Coast and have never tried Texas BBQ.  Some people prefer there Texan style BBQ better.  Maybe I don't know any better, but I thought it was really good."}
{"text":"Lunch rocks every time!  line guy will stop the serving for a few moments to clean his line of spilled food;  I really appreciate this!!!  Food is ALWAYS fresh and good!!!!  Butcher side is awesome as well!  fresh meats, fresh cuts!  LOVE this place!!!"}
{"text":"This place is out of the world. Best BBQ I've had since I was in Texas. Best part is it's close to my house. People are great, friendly, and knowledgeable. If you haven't tried it please do!"}
{"text":"This place always satisfy my craving for delicious authentic barbecue. Oh emm Gee!! The macaroni will make you slap ya momma!!! I love Road kill grill Dats it!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite bbq places in Vegas! The sauces are so full of flavor you could just jump for joy. The mac&cheese sends my tongue into at tap dance and the cornbread makes me want to sing opera. The meats on the other hand, well those are just to die for!"}
{"text":"I'm a Texas girl and was having the craving for some BBQ, in all the years I've lived here (over 20) I have never had any BBQ in this city that can come close to the best BBQ which in my humble opinion is from Texas. So I jumped on yelp to see what was out there, maybe just maybe there's a hidden gem in the city of sin. So after reading some reviews we decided to check out the road kill grill. The name alone sounds interesting, and it was featured on the food network.....so I'm not gonna lie we got a little giddy. Driving up it was very cool, it's ranch style setting, you eat outside on picnic tables and they are smoking the meat out there. It gives you that vibe of family reunion or family gathering on a Sunday afternoon, I dug that. Now the first red flag was they are smokin the meat outside but there was no delicious aroma of meat smokin in the air. I wanna smell that meat smokin, it gets my mouth goin! So the husband orders what he always gets when we eat BBQ..... Brisket sandwich. I decide to try something different so I ordered a plate of chicken with green beans and Mac and cheese. So we'll start off with the brisket sandwich. The brisket didn't look like brisket. Brisket should be brown and crispy on the outside and pink towards the center. It should melt in your mouth and flake apart. The brisket looked nothing like that, it looked as though they had boiled it, not smoked it. When he opened the styrofoam container that held his sandwich I thought they messed up on his order and gave him pork, because the meat looked like pork not brisket. There were no pickles, no mustard, and no onions which are what make a brisket sandwich. The BBQ sauce they provided for dipping I will say was delicious. Now onto the chicken. That was delicious, very moist and very juicy. The flavoring was excellent, and I think should be considered their best item. The green beans were full of flavor and scarfed up immediately. The Mac and cheese was really good as well, it was baked and didn't have an overabundance of cheese. Overall if I could give this place 2 1/2 stars I would, I can't stretch to a 3 just based on the fact that the brisket was so off. I'm still on my quest to find some delicious Texas style BBQ here in the valley. I'm getting kinda tired of having to drive all the way to Phoenix to have Rudy's just so I can have some good BBQ."}
{"text":"This was our second time eating at Road Kill Grill. The first time Was very good. This time the meal was EXCELLENT! It was the best BBQ meal I've eaten in Vegas to date. Had the ribs, beans and potato salad. All were exceptional. My wife had the chicken and brisket combo. I feel they slice the brisket too thin (like sandwich meat). BBQ Brisket is usually sliced 1/8\"-1/4\" thick. I love BBQ. Have been to Austin, TX many times and have had their best including Franklins. I'm not comparing RKG to anywhere in Austin but my meal was darn good. Since I'm not in Austin now, this is my new BBQ go to place. Can't wait to go back. BTW, we arrived before 11:15 and the wait was about ten minutes. After 11:45 the line was at least 25 peeps deep."}
{"text":"Just moved to Vegas and ran across this place....no pun intended.....their food is amazing and the staff are fantastic. In the mood for amazing no frills bbq? Get here quick...and often."}
{"text":"Boy oh Boy !! Great BBQ. Once you find the place and figure out the ordering process your ready for BBQ Heaven. We got the three meat combo and it was plenty for two, maybe too much. Brisket, Ribs, & Hot link. Also two sides, we got the Mac & Cheese and Beans, Killer !! Corn Bread was great also. With two bottled waters it was a grand total of twenty bucks. You can't ask for a better deal. Next time I won't eat breakfast before I head over there for lunch. You can be sure I will make this a regular stop when I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"This is the only BBQ joint in town that I will endorse.  Their hot links are made from scratch, which is a rarity in these parts.  My husband raves about their beef brisket.  Road Kill Grill even makes their own BBQ sauce and it's finger-licking good!  I hate  to admit it, but their macaroni and cheese surpasses mine.  Save room for some cobbler!  This down home place is legit.  Just take your meal to go."}
{"text":"I mean this is some mean BBQ in Vegas.  I am from the South and I saw this on Triple D which I must admit I have been less than impressed by some of the places I have been to that have been on that show.  This place is the real deal!  They have the biggest portions I have ever seen!!  I had the pulled pork, brisket, and burnt ends.  My cousins and I also order the hot links as a side which cannot be missed repeat CANNOT be missed!!!  Everything was spectacular!!!  The BBQ sauce was spot on, and everything was not oversmoked like some places.  My sides were mac n cheese (my go to) and greens (tender but not too tender, perfect in my opinion).    This place I must tell you is hidden in a residential area way outside the strip.  It is well worth the trip.  I am adding it to my must visits when in Vegas for great BBQ!!!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in LV, possible the Wild West coast!!!! I usually get the brisket. Had the apple cobbler once. Make sure to get the spicy bbq sauce and Mac n cheese on the side. Wish they really had indoor seating. But it gives a bbq picnic experience. I'm from Texas and this rates among the best I've ever had!!!!"}
{"text":"The food here was absolutely amazing!!!! I saw it on Diners Drive-ins and Dives and I am glad I invested in a rental car! The ribs were tender, juicy, seasoned well, and made me make a big mess with the sauce. The Mac and cheese was also cheesy and flavorful! Please anyone going to Vegas go visit this place..."}
{"text":"I love me some bbq!! Mmm mmm....when I smell that smoke and see the beautiful site of ribs, sausage and brisket on the grill I truly get excited. This place came highly recommended on Triple D, thus we took a venture to see what all the hype was about.   Let's talk about the location. It's located in the middle of a neighborhood which kind of caught me off guard at first. You see all these houses, and then WHAM....there is this house that has a huge grilling operation going on behind it.   The people that work here are very friendly. Laughing, smiling and helping you make a good choice for what to eat. I ordered their 3 meat combo which came with brisket, pulled pork and ribs (disclaimer: they don't offer burnt tips! That's a bbq no no in my book). For my sides I had greens and yams. The cashier kind of twisted my arm to get their banana pudding for a dessert.  After we sat down to eat, I first dove into the yams which was delicious. Good texture and nice and sweet. The greens were also really yummy as well. They also give you a cornbread muffin which was good, not the best I've ever had....but good. Not really sweet like I like my cornbread.   Now the meat. I saw no smoke ring on any of the meat I ordered, so I was concerned about how this was going to taste. I first bit into the brisket which was a little disappointing. I don't think the smoke got into it at all, and the flavor was just ok. The ribs were really good. Not very much smoke, but they have a great dry rub that packs in some good flavor. The rib meat was also a little tougher than what I would like, but it was still good. The pulled pork was really the savior. Great texture and huge flavor!  Now it was time for the banana pudding. This thing was amazing! Nice and thick pudding with big time flavor. The Nilla wafers were nice and crunchy, and the bananas weren't brown. I will say this is top 2 best banana puddings I've ever had.....next to my moms of course ;-)  Overall, I liked my experience here. Good atmosphere and good food. If you've read my other reviews about Texas bbq, then you know I'm a fan of how they do it in the south. This place is not as good as good as Texas bbq. Not enough smoke, and the meat texture needed a little bit of help.   If I had to break it down, I would give this place a solid 3 star on the bbq and a 5 star for the dessert and customer service.  Can anyone outside of Texas beat them in bbq? I'm still on the hunt!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of barbecue and was referred to this place by a coworker for the next time I was in Vegas.  My wife and I stopped by and were not disappointed.  Fantastic smoked meats, sides loaded with flavor, and loaded portions.  My wife and I split a 3 meat plate (comes with two sides) and were stuffed before we could finish everything.  You can get different combinations (1 meat and some sides) for 8-12 bucks, two meat plates are 12-14 I believe, and our three meat plate was 16.  If you're getting individual entrees, expect to pay 20-30 dollars.  My wife and I got by on 16 and were stuffed.  They have drinks and waters for $1 as well.  Depending on when you go, there may be one or two lines.  We had a line outside and a line inside the Saturday we stopped by.  Both lines get you the same grub, so be sure to pick whatever's shorter.  They have brisket, pulled pork, ribs, chicken, and hot links.  If you like some heat, the hot links are to die for.  Get them cut up and covered in sauce.  They have amazing sides as well.  We got the mac and cheese and the baked beans.  Mac and cheese was phenomenal.  Baked beans were good, but impossible to top the mac and cheese.  I've heard the desserts are pretty good too, but we were too full to try them out.  If you're in Vegas, check this place out.  A little drive from the strip (about half an hour with traffic) but it is more than worth it."}
{"text":"Over hyped by alot! Service here was atrocious. Took like 30-45 minutes to get food and pay and we were only probably 15 people in line ahead of us.  Food is nothing special. Guy fieri must be smoking something to think this is good BBQ. Their signature sauce was detestable. I will never be back here that's for sure. The only good thing was the cornbread. Literally, the only thing."}
{"text":"Very good. Pulled pork was my fav. Peach cobbler and mac were awesome. Tge corn bread is great too."}
{"text":"As a long time bbq lover and meat smoker I was excited to try this bbq.  I honestly felt it was just ok.  Not sure if it's simply overrated or just a lack of good bbq in Vegas so there is nothing else around to compare it too.   The hot link was my favorite.  And the next was the Mac n cheese. Which isn't even a meat lol.  The ribs were ok but not really smoky.  Fortunately the bbq sauce was incredibly good and saved it.   The burnt ends weren't great and basically tasted like boring roast beef.  The beans were great.  The collard greens were plain.  And the peach cobbler was just ok as well.   It wasn't bad.   I left full.  But not really as good as all the hype."}
{"text":"By the vest BBQ spot in Vegas... maybe even in the West Coast. I'm a local so I always bring someone here when they are in town. Looking for some good food come here."}
{"text":"Ol Rawhide dip shit...is full of sht! So what ever the dumb fkr has to say is also full of sht! He can't get from la to vegas since triple d was over and make his dumb asz remark...no way any way!!! just some fkn green freak!"}
{"text":"Based on seeing this place featured on DDD, we opted to try this place out.  First the parking lot is gravel, but that wasn't an issue.  We then had to get in line to place your order, then you stand in line to pay the order, then you take your order and stand in line to get your food.  All of this is outside in 100 degrees!  This process is very disorganized.  Although there were maybe 10 people in front of us it took close to 45 minutes to get our food.  Brisket was pre cooked, sliced and resting in juice wrapped in foil until it is placed on the service line.  We also had the burnt ends that where stew in sauce, they were better.  Ribs were dry, and did not fall off the bone, again disappointed.  Mac Cheese was okay, but the corn bread top was good.  Soda and water were sitting in melted ice, and it was not cold.  Did I mention it was 100 degrees!  No one seemed to care.  We were very disappointed, portions were big, but found the food bland and not worth the wait.  They ran out of styrofoam cups of BBQ sauce, and the folks working there seems uninterested in being efficient or customer focused.  I would not recommend this place based on the quality of the food, the excessive wait and the service.  Sanitation of how this operation is functioning also gave us great concerns.    I am very disappointed in Guy saying this is great BBQ."}
{"text":"We've ordered brisket for family birthdays and celebrations. The brisket stays moist even until the next morning! It doesn't dry out. Love it for next day breakfast. They package it for you nicely so that the meat stays warm and hot. The great thing is if it cools down you can throw it in the oven in the same container they gave it to you in. Mac n cheese was delicious and flavorful. Brisket is packed with good flavor and they cut it beautifully."}
{"text":"Interesting location in a subdivision and all outside seating. We went on an overcast day so it wasn't bad but there's no way in the summer heat. Tried the brisket (good), burnt ends (really good), hot link (really good), potato salad (really good), beans (really good), mac n cheese (excellent). We're divided on the corn bread. Hub loved it, I hated it. Tasted like a vanilla cake mix with cornmeal thrown in. He agreed but still loved it. Not cheap but big portions so sadly, I was way too full to try dessert."}
{"text":"We eat the brisket, the pork ribs and pulled pork.  We had all the sides and beans were awesome!   The best Barbeque in all of Nevada and could be the best west of the Mississippi.    You need to try it and you too will believe!"}
{"text":"Amazing barbeque. Will come back here if ever in Las Vegas again. It's really off the beaten and path.  Get there early because they run out of food fast. The staff was very kind and took the time to chat with us and get to know us."}
{"text":"Just moved to LV last summer finally went for first time today. It's hellaaa good. Good prices. The bomb! Closed Sundays."}
{"text":"Adding to the hundreds of positive ratings. Best BBQ in Las Vegas hands down. The line is always long but it is worth the wait. My family & I love their hot links, brisket, ribs, mac & cheese, potato salad...basically everything is great! My favorite BBQ place is The Shed which is down south...but this place is pretty damn good & will definitely do when that random BBQ craving comes around."}
{"text":"As seen on diners drive in and dives. The road kill grill has home made meats and sides. I try the beef brisket and hot links combo with a side of macaroni and cheese and potato salad. Everything was very good and the portions were appropriately sized. The only real complaint is that the workers did not have any sense of emotions and they were very silent and did not crack a smile. There is no seating as the building is set up where on building you order and then a little outdoor area which is only for seating and it has wood benches along with mist sprayers for those hot days. I would highly recommend this place as the food is very good.This place while being on TV, I feel that the quality has gone down as the customers got bigger. The food is good but the quality of BBQ and food does not compare with a comparable SNS Diner."}
{"text":"I was here on a Saturday and waited about 45 minutes in line outside to eat BBQ and it was actually totally worth it (they handed out water as we waited). On Saturdays you actually eat outside as well under a couple of covered areas with no reserved tables, it gets crowded so hopefully you can snag a table.    I'm very picky about BBQ and this place was as good as any down South. The brisket was leaner and more tender than most, you could cut this stuff with a fork. The green beans were definitely homemade with potatoes, onions, and lots of ham. The BBQ beans were likewise quite tasty with a bit of a spicy flavor and included onions and peppers. The pulled pork might have been the best of all, it was lean and tender with a BBQ sauce with a spicy, slightly garlic flavor. Oh and this comes with a large cornbread muffin too. The portion sizes here are MASSIVE, I was hungry and still was able to eat maybe 3/4 my meal at best.  This place is in the middle of a residential area so you'll think your GPS is steering you wrong but you're going the right way. I'll be back here as I enjoy no frills BBQ."}
{"text":"Looooong wait for hot food! I thought a Tuesday afternoon would be slow, but no way. I'll admit the food is worth the wait, but still they should expand or at least have a larger waiting area. My parents and I went for takeout during lunch time. We all ordered the 2 meat combo with 2 sides. The rib tips were delicious, perfect salty, smokey tenderness. The beef brisket was very tender as well. The portions are huge! For sides I tried the green beans and the maccaroni and cheese. The green beans were seasoned with smoked pork and surprisingly not overcooked. The maccaroni and cheese tasted like something I would have eaten at a \"pig pickin\" back home. It was wonderful, cheesy, creamy goodness. For the 3 of us for lunch, the bill came to $48, however we had enough leftovers for a second meal. If you've got a hankerin for some quality smoked meat, check this place out!"}
{"text":"This is my second time here. Sorry still TERRIBLE BBQ. At least the staff was very friendly this time. Last time everyone grouchy.  The mac and cheese and the cobbler is decent but not worth the 30-45 minute wait AFTER lunchtime. Over price underwhelming."}
{"text":"Pulled in and was a little confused. Walked up and was still a little confused then I saw the sign for where to order.  Food was amazing! I tried the pulled pork, Mac & cheese and BBQ beans. The pulled pork was delicious, best I've ever had. I wasn't too impressed with the BBQ beans. They have very reasonable prices and I will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Love, love, love the bacon!"}
{"text":"One star for the tri tip, and the other star for the Mac and cheese. This place really needs a new location to accommodate all the hipster/tourists that pile into this hut on a daily. I can't stand the wait time at this place, especially waiting behind a huge group of idiot tourists blah blahing about how they saw this place on triple d. STFU and order your meal I'm feeling claustrophobic in this place and might go postal!"}
{"text":"They have tents.  You no longer have to sit in the sun.   LOVE this place.  Expect a line.  I have never gone when there hasn't been one.  Travel across the city for Road Kill Grill BBQ!  You meet the nicest people in line.  I always order the three meat plates.  Sides of Mac and Cheese and Greens.  They make the best of everything.  You watch them cook it while you are waiting for pick up.  Portions are more than I can eat in one sitting.  Usually get a cobbler or two, for dessert at a later time.   BBQ at it's finest."}
{"text":"We came here for their BBQ Sauce and decided to share a 3 meat combo between the 4 of us as a \"pre-buffet\" snack. We chose the pulled pork, brisket, and hot links with cornbread, green beans and mac and cheese. Wow! I have a new standard for BBQ and it's John Mull's!   The pulled pork was my favorite: it wasn't fatty or greasy-- it was tender and well seasoned. Green beans had a unique flavor and the cornbread was just right. The experience was made better by how nice the BBQ staff was and the feeling of being at a backyard BBQ.   I will come back here whenever I'm in Vegas and recommend it vehemently."}
{"text":"Ok.  Finally made it here.  Brisket, Ribs, Rib Tips it's all good.  Actually better than good.  Excellent.  Collard greens , OMG.  Beans.   I can have collard green and beans all day long.  Don't even get me started on the cornbread.   Simple and basic at it's BEST. Will be my goto place for out of town visitors."}
{"text":"Outstanding BBQ and friendly staff at this place! Guy Fieri was right on! It's always a huge plus when the staff have fun and seem to love what theyre doing!!! The food is AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding! Old Vegas restaurant that's got plenty of outdoor seating. They'll also butcher whatever you shot earlier in the day. Sandwiches are great!"}
{"text":"Just for customer service alone, this place deserves 5 stars. After seeing this restaurant on Diners, Drive-ins, & Dives, my family and I wanted to taste some authentic bbq while staying in Vegas. Unbeknownst to us, we arrived at the restaurant at 6 (which is the time they closed on Wednesday's). The staff did not even THINK about turning us away (because they were closing), but surprisingly offered to serve us despite our late arrival! Even with their generous hospitality, we decided to decline the offer because we did not want to bother them further. They gladly referred us to their other location, which is about 8 miles north and closes at 9. And to top it all off, they gave us samples to try before we left: customer service beyond the norm. P.S. they have amazing bbq too :D"}
{"text":"The food was good. It really should be rated at 3 3/4. The burnt ends were not crispy, but were tasty. The brisket was a bit dry, lacked flavor and tasted more like the tri-tip. The sides were ok, I liked the mac n' cheese, the cole slaw was bland, yams were very tasty, the greens were good and the ribs were pretty good as well. I think the outside ambience is cool, but truthfully, I've had better BBQ."}
{"text":"That pig lived a good life! It was slaughtered, cut, delivered, marinated, cooked and enjoyed with a smile on my face :D"}
{"text":"My brother-in-law heard of this place on Diners, Drive ins and Dives. He called while I was in Vegas and said to try it! Well the brisket was soooooo good as were the yams. Others had pulled pork and they raved about it. The servers were really friendly.  Getting there was an adventure and it is located in a residential area. Don't miss out on this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Love the food. The brisket is tender the prices are reasonable. Be sure your okay with Bar-B-Q style dinning because there is no room to eat inside. They have a nice outside seating area and when the weather is nice this is the place to go"}
{"text":"Everything is delicious here. My job has this place cater to us at least twice a year if not more. My family enjoys this place a lot too. We fight over the Mac n cheese!! Definitely always happy when we leave here. The set up is also great and makes you feel like you're somewhere else. Sometimes people stop by on their horses! Don't pass this place up."}
{"text":"I ordered the brisket sandwich and it wasn't all that great. My husband ordered the pulled chicken sandwich and sausage with potato salad and Mac n cheese. His sandwich wasn't all that great, the sausage was pretty good and the potato salad was good.  He liked the Mac n cheese.  We also ordered apple cobbler which was deelish!!   We waited an hour and half to order and get our food.. Overall the food wasn't worth the wait.  Don't think we'll come back.."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for some BBQ boy have you come to the right place! Road Kill Grill has some delicious BBQ. If it wasn't for food network and yelp I would never have known about this place. Hiding on a little street between rancher homes you might pass this place up.   I had the 2 meat combo. I chose the brisket and pulled pork. That brisket was so tender and juicy. The pulled pork sauce had just a little kick to it and I loved it. For the sides I chose mac and cheese and coleslaw. The cheese is flavorful and the noodles were cooked just right. The coleslaw is just a little sweet. I like my slaw sweet but having the way road kill does it was nice too. The portions are generous! I thought I could eat everything but half way through my stomach was like no more, so I got some left overs for tomorrow.  I will have to buy some meat from the shop to cook at home next time. They have covered wood tables outside for you to dine at. If it's to windy or cold then that's ok take your food and go home it will still be nice and warm. This place easily has lines. I lucked out today and the line was not too bad.  I give Road Kill Grill 4 stars for the excellent BBQ that's super tender and for the friendly service!"}
{"text":"We have been to Roadkill several times when visiting family in LV and absolutely loved the food. Today, I am afraid we were very disappointed with the meats on our combo. The brisket in the past has been so tender you did not need a knife  to cut it while today it was tough and fatty; could hardly cut it with a knife.  It was also cold as were the ribs which also lacked flavor.  The collard greens, mac and cheese and cornbread however were delicious and the staff as usual were extremely friendly.  I hope that we just hit Roadkill on a bad day."}
{"text":"Dear owner! In all of my years on earth I have never had to wait so incredibly long for \"BBQ\"!!! This was my first and last time coming here for lunch. After about 30 minutes of waiting in line outside, I looked in the restaurant in order to see what the hold up was. The workers were moving like snails! Absolutely no sense of urgency."}
{"text":"Back again for another stellar bbq experience. Every side was perfect with added ingredients for flavor. Green beans have pulled pork and potatoes. Potato salad is perfect. Beans are so flavorful. Chicken had a perfect smokey flavor. They forgot my brisket so gave us a side order of brisket which was very generous. Ribs are delicious. Next time we'll order ahead the beef ribs but didn't want to wait 20 minutes today. Got the mild tangy sauce but nothing really needed it so used sparingly. Comfortable shaded picnic tables out back. Again, just as good as Austin and a perfect spot to take our out-of-towners."}
{"text":"We LOVE LOVE LOVE John Mull's! My favorite thing to get is their macaroni and cheese! It is super tasty and never have I had better Mac and cheese! They give really healthy portions so we Just split the two meat option. I love the pulled pork and my husband likes the brisket. Both are great. The people who work there are always really friendly even in the Las Vegas heat and are always hard at work. Be prepared for lines and a wait especially around lunch time. Keep in mind also there is only outdoor seating available, so if you are with someone who shouldn't be out in the heat, consider asking for the food to go. To be honest the seating/eating arrangement isn't my favorite. But the food is so good how can you pass it up. We also really like the Jonny cakes. I am pretty sure they are made in house and are really tasty too. John Mull's has a pretty big fan following as well as I have met people from California all the way to South Carolina that make John Mull's their must visit list when them come to Vegas. Whether you are from out of town or a local, it is worth a visit!"}
{"text":"I feel like something is wrong with me because I'm giving this place only 3 stars while everyone is obsessed! But, I've eaten bbq ALL my life...I have pictures dating from when I was 6 months old nubbing on some ribs so I kind of like to think I have a sense for it. Hahahha. Growing up with bbqd food, eating bbqd food elsewhere from someone else's home...our home...in other states, etc...I will say I've developed a strict taste when eating bbq food at establishments.  Husband and I shared the 3 meat combo. Pulled pork, brisket, and their links...had their mac n cheese and cornbread as our sides...I'm not a mac n cheese person but I thought it wasn't so bad. Their cornbread was definitely on point! I hate that I even had to share my bites with the husband. Should've bought extra. Hahahha. He ate the brisket and links while I just ate the pulled pork. If you're taste buds work like mine...safe to say it tasted like pulled pork with bbq sauce. Husband gave a thumbs up for his share. Although, he did share a disappointment it didn't seem to have tasted as fresh out the smoker as he imagined. We had come during the week around 12 and he felt like he was eating yesterday's leftovers.   During the week you have to go into the shop for food. Next time we come we'll probably brave the long weekend lines just to get that outdoor experience my husband wants to feel.  While John Mulls is good, it isn't anything amazing. You aren't going to get your mind blown like something out of this world. If you've starved yourself all day, you may distort your reality and think so. However, here in LV...we lack what John Mulls does. They're serving you meat straight from their shop they've butchered themselves. So with that in mind...I think they're good in that sense! I would come here for bbq food versus going to some \"Please wait to be seated\" establishment.   If you got a big family as we do...the plates are certainly shareable between kids unless you have kids that can chop meat down faster than a butcher can. However, my children arent too carnivorous so between my 9 and 7 year old...a 3 meat combo will do its job. Thank goodness because it isn't cheap eats to be buying them their own individual plate that they may or may not even like/finish.  No high chairs or anything. Love the ranch style eating with their picnic tables. Bring the kids and stroller too!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best BBQ I've ever had. Some of the best pulled pork, brisket, baked beans, mac n cheese, and cornbread I've ever had. It's usually a 30-60 min. wait on the weekends."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. I've never  been a  big fan of bbq but I would definitely go back. I ate ALL my food. Pulled pork sandwich, side of Mac, and Apple cobbler. The only thing that sucks is that you have to wait in a long line to order. Like 40 minutes and it's hot... Other than that A+!"}
{"text":"I never had macaroni and cheese that I dreamed about until I had their Mac and cheese !! I can't stop thinking about it ! The burnt ends and the brisket was tender and delicious! The greens were flavorful and not bitter ! I've gotten take out twice and can't wait to get my BBQ fix , luckily I live about a half mile away  Keep up the great work!!"}
{"text":"All I have to say is you have to try this place...oh and the Mac'n cheese was amazing!!! Stop searching and looking at all the Yelp reviews just go and find out for your self!!! If it was on DDD come on you know it's good!!!! The only thing I thought need some improvement was the customer service there was no customer service"}
{"text":"Loved the food!!! It was warm, and delicious!  Beef ribs fell of the bone, sausage was the best we've had by far!   Baked beans were unique and flavorful!  Mac and cheese was out of this world delish!  Next time we will skip the tri tip and order more ribs.  The value was excellent and my whole family left with a smile not only because the food was delish but because the service was great also!  Owner came out to greet us and offered us free samples of the food!   Worth the drive from the strip!!"}
{"text":"They good far are Meats all of its fresh , downfall they are a little slow , they bbq side not all that it's only famous from tripple d , but that's my opinion"}
{"text":"Worth it! Get the three meat combo, you won't be sorry. You'll have leftovers, even if you share. The portions are huge and the meat is tender! I've tried the brisket, ribs, rib tips, mac and cheese, cole slaw, and beans. The sides are just ok, but the meat is really good.  All the staff are really friendly and if you have a frequent customer card make sure you let them stamp it! Usually they will give you double stamps.  The lines are long. They don't move that fast. Just wait. It's worth it.  If you want the spicy sauce you gotta ask. But they let you take as many of the regulars are you want. They are all ready to go in little containers after you pick up your food."}
{"text":"This is a review for just the Road Kill Grill - not the butcher.  I assume Road Kill Grill should have its own listing but since everyone is posting here about it, I might as well do it too.  So - I read the story on John Curtas's site that Road Kill Grill never existed until DDD made it up for good television.  I'm confused as to why that would happen, but I think it's interesting.  Since I've had to be on the North - NW side of town lately I thought I would jet over and try it.  I wasn't mostly very impressed with anything I tried, the ribs were dry and the sides were forgettable and I ended up throwing all that stuff away after a few bites.  I also want to point out that there is literally not a vegetable based side on the menu.  However, I had the chicken and it was heavenly.  I will come back just for this.  It had a dry rub, and the BBQ sauce was in a self serve area on the side, which I got a little to taste and was fine.  But I prefer a more vinegar based sauce because regular sauce has too much sugar.  I did like being able to control whatever sauce I wanted to put on it, as I mostly opted to not have any at all.  So while I can honestly say there's no good BBQ in town, I really did love the chicken here more than others I have tried.  This includes Famous Dave's, Lucilles, Buzz, Memphis, etc.  I get cravings for it, and I wish they would sell it ala carte on the menu without all those sides."}
{"text":"Perhaps it's because the reviews are all so high, I was slightly disappointed and feel this place is overrated at 5 stars.  Don't get me wrong:  This place does have all the feeling that you're getting food straight from a butcher or some special place like that; but when it was all said and done, the BBQ was good, but I've enjoyed other places more, and isn't worth the near 30 minute wait in line, IMO."}
{"text":"Awesome food (hot link, mac and cheese, ribs, brisket and tried the cobbler too) service was great, loved the atmosphere, exactly what you want in a BBQ place. Went there because of \"DDD\" Diners, Drive-ins,..."}
{"text":"Delicious BBQ. Reasonable prices for the quality and quantity. And FREE SMELLS! Their Mac & cheese is also delicious!"}
{"text":"I've been to a couple of local BBQ joints in town and have hated them all. I finally admitted that the only place I could get decent BBQ is Lucille's or Memphis BBQ. I was talking to a coworker about the lack of good BBQ in this city and she mentioned the Road Kill Grill. She said that she lived close by and since I lived on the opposite side of town, she would stop and get me a plate. The next day she came in with a very heavy styrofoam plate and told me that the price had recently gone up to $15. When I got home, there was chicken, ribs, links, and brisket along with mac & cheese, and beans. There was a regular sauce and a spicy one. The amazing part of it all is that ALL of it was very good.  I was shocked. It was VERY good, only cost $15 and the two of us ate off of it for three days. What an amazing meal. I have only one regret. I live so far away from it. I'll definitely have it again."}
{"text":"I have been craving bbq for awhile and I found this place on Yelp. The setup doesn't look like I thought, everything is outside which had me a little concerned. It was our first time here and the employees were very  helpful and nice. I ordered the half chicken dinner with Mac and cheese and greens. When I got home I realized they don't put sauce on the chicken but after eating it I really didn't miss the sauce. The greens were good, I liked that they were cooked with smoked turkey since I don't eat beef or pork. The mac and cheese and cornbread was also decent. My husband ordered the link/rib combo with macaroni salad and baked beans. He didn't care for the links something about the taste but he did like the ribs. He also enjoyed the beans but said they were a little on the spicy side. Overall we enjoyed our food and will visit again since it's not too far from home. Oh the peach cobbler had a good taste but unfortunately my container had a lot of burnt crust in it."}
{"text":"This is THE best BBQ in Vegas. Everything is always great no matter when you go or if you place a catering order. The pulled pork and mac n cheese are to die for! Even if it is out of your way, make a plan to go!"}
{"text":"Big servings of yummy bbq! It lived up to it's Triple D rep. It's in a neighborhood location. Serving and eating are outside with tables under cover. We shared a 2 meat combo and it was almost too much food for 2 of us! This is a must-do next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"Our first butcher shop in the Valley, but after reading reviews this was THE place to go.  Got some soup bones for the pups, two steaks for us for dinner shouldn't have gone the sirloin steak as said 'was very good' next time will stop trying to be cheap and go with the good stuff.  Also got a ham slice that is the BEST we've ever had, can't wait to go back and stock the freezer with some more delish.  Maybe go back during the week when it's not quite so busy and standing room only."}
{"text":"I went yesterday with a friend of mine who was there to pick dinner for her and hubby. As we stood in line I started looking a menu (And i must say it all sounds amazing) I decided on the brisket sandwich and let me just say I was not disappointed by any means. This brisket was by far the best I have ever had and I can guarantee I will be back for more. This place is a 12 out of 10. I would highly recommend this place #bestbbqintown"}
{"text":"Great meat, one of my go to spots for sure. Lines are usually long, so be prepared to wait. You can also call in your order (not fs purchases though, you have to walk in for those)  But they cook fresh bbq there too. So you can eat some good food, while waiting for more good food to cook at home Lol Nice benches outside, some covered, some not. But it nice.  Check them out!"}
{"text":"I love bbq and I usually smoke my own.  BBQ here was just ok for me and not enough smoke.  Sauce was just ok as well.   Won't be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely the Finest Meats and Side Dishes! Very Good Desserts! You will Never be disappointed!  1st stop in Vegas after that long drive from San Diego! Make sure to bring a cooler to take some back home!"}
{"text":"I've been here 3-4 times. (Keep in mind that a Friday afternoon on a holiday weekend makes for longer lines.) The food is very good!  I have had brisket, pulled pork and hot links. All were very tasty. The pulled pork and hot links (sliced version) are covered, no smothered, in sauce. That's ok with me, but if you wanted less you could just ask.   I have heard good things from friends about the butcher side of the business, but have not purchased anything from the butcher yet."}
{"text":"WOW... Not only is the food delicious the customer service is amazing as well for an all around great experience. The brisket is by far the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"What a phenomenal family owned joint. It makes you nervous to drive up to a dirt lot in a non commercial area until you realize what a Vegas Gem this is! The hot food was amazing! I had a brisket sandwich and he Mac n cheese and it was standout! I ordered $50 of meat and they gave me a free flat of eggs...the Bacon is cut to order based off of your preferred thickness...Couldn't be any fresher!"}
{"text":"Really great food & friendly staff! It's not cheap, but it is really good. We ate our BBQ out on their picnic tables. Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing!! The sides were great, the meat was tender and the service was exceptional. It was pretty awesome for our first time visiting."}
{"text":"You want so much damn good BBQ that you'll leave food on the plate because they gave you so much? Well you're going to have that opportunity if you're willing to drive a few miles out of town. Yes, you'll probably be in a little sun (it's outdoors), but the seating is covered, and they have misters. It's a low cost out of the way southern style BBQ with wonderful food on clam-shell styrofoam plates.  We would recommend the hot links if you want something you can't get anywhere else. They're fresh, all natural, and cooked right there on the grill in front of you. Made the old-fashioned way, these hotlinks will take you back to your childhood (depending on your age),  The brisket melted in our mouths, and was full of flavor and spiced just right. You like pulled pork? Well it's piled on thick, and ready to be eaten just the way they gave it to you, but don't do it. Pour on some of their home-made BBQ sauce to give it the depth that will keep you satisfied for a really long time. The BBQ sauces are provided in little 2 oz cups and come in original and spicy. It's spicy, but not too spicy. Take both and let your palate decide.  The sides are just like grandma used to make. They're all good, and you can't go wrong with any of them.The only exception was the collard greens. Don't get me wrong, they're VERY good, but just can't touch Mable's ( a Louisiana-born collard green magician). Eat it with a piece of home-made corn bread, and you'll know the trip out here to North Las Vegas was worth every mile on those crazy Las Vegas freeways."}
{"text":"We have lived in Las Vegas for over 20 years and we've always wanted to try this place. Most amazing authentic bbq here in Vegas! We tried a little bit of everything. Ribs, chicken, brisket, hot links and rib tips. For sides we tried the coleslaw, yams, baked beans and green beans. Everything except for the green beans was outstanding. Green beans were nothing special. Delicious cornbread. The Mac n cheese looked yummy. Drawback, an hour wait in line, but totally worth it!!!!"}
{"text":"Super nice folks, got me the hook up on pork neck bones.  Nita was a delight to work with on a busy Saturday. Will be back for another visit."}
{"text":"Not only is the food amazing, so is the staff. This is a true family business where they take pride in what they do. This is a must eat kind of place, where you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Peach cobbler, Mac n cheese, pulled pork and hot links... Must haves. I just moved here and I live too close!!! Absolutely delicious and worth the wait."}
{"text":"I'm at John Mulls for the 1st time. The potato salad got me here..but these links..BAAABY!..the greens ain't bad, either..I'm full already, and I haven't put the sauce on my ribs, yet. Reminds me of my uncle Leon's ribs, no sauce needed! The gravy from the links is great with the corn bread..."}
{"text":"This place was really good it was a long line today memorial weekend they was giving out free hamburgers and free hotdogs why you wait in line!! But I like the place it's on a form house one side is a house and one side is a barbecue place not bad!! Just go a little early the line is really long and you have to wait outside and you know how Vegas is hot hot hot is no inside you eat outside or you could take it home.. So let's talk about the food the food was really good I got the two meat combo hotlinks and chicken and two sides potato salad and I had yams and those was really good it comes with a cornbread or a slice of white bread!! I like the idea of this place you could make money and don't even have to leave your house.. So I had to try it out because someone told me about this place so I am a Yelp girl so I have to give my honest opinion!!"}
{"text":"Lines are sometimes long, but that's Bc they're the bomb! I love this place, and my hubby actually just said he wanted some. Lol! Delicious food, quick service, and I love the outdoor setting. Also, I love that you can buy uncooked meat. Wide variety of meats! I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I saw this restaurant featured on an episode of Triple D. I made it my business to go there when I went to Vegas last week. The place did not disappoint. The ribs were tender and seasoned so well that you don't need barbeque sauce. The chicken was perfect. The sides were surprisingly good also. I had the macaroni salad, others in my group had mac n cheese, yams, and collard greens. There weren't any complaints. Please do yourself a favor a try the peach cobbler. You won't be disappointed. The staff is fast and friendly. Just be prepared to wait. It's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I love this place the chicken is great and the pork rib tips are my fave. Great place to go during the week days but stay away on the busy weekends when the lines result in dried out food."}
{"text":"This is definitely a unique set up the food is AMAZING very quick the corn bread is the best I've ever had. Pricing is reasonable I always split my order with my friend although some of my other friends do finish their meal on their own"}
{"text":"Worth every morsel of the 45 minute wait in line! You guys rocked it. Have a great 4th of July holiday!"}
{"text":"Best darn bbq in Vegas if you ask me. Brisket sandwich was phenomenal! Pour the BBQ spice all over it and it's perfect. I'm a picky person when it comes to potato salad; being raised in North Carolina will do that to you, and I have to say their potato salad is spot on! Greens had the perfect amount of seasoning to them even though I could have done with a little less run off and juices in the bowl. Over all a place I'll be heading back to time and time again!  Not to mention the staff there are amazing. Good vibe from the staff given the sketchy look of the interior. They do the food right people and that's all I care about. They have place outside, accompanied by a mister cooling line, that you can eat at. A covered portion with picnic tables and a nice area in the sun if you are there late enough."}
{"text":"I have lived in Las Vegas for almost 3 years and since Day 1 I have been told to try the Road Kill Grill for BBQ. I am disappointed in myself it has taken this long and considering the fact I live less than 3 miles from there, I should be ashamed.  From the moment you pull into the parking lot, you can smell the various meats being smoked. Every good BBQ joint has the smell meet you well before you enter the facility, it is no different here. On our visit, we stopped by for a later lunch and our mouths started watering immediately.   They have everything you would expect, so many tough choices. Karen went with the brisket dinner which came with a huge helping of sliced brisket along with two sides she picked (Yams and Mac & Cheese). Karen enjoyed every aspect of her meal, including the house BBQ sauce which she said had great flavor and a gentle kick.  I can never pass up brisket, but instead of doubling up entirely on Karen's choices, I went with the two meat combo. I did choose the brisket, but also the pulled pork. My meal also came with two sides and I went with potato salad and green beans. I loved the pulled pork, some of the best I have had. The brisket was good, but I wouldn't put it in the great category. I didn't quite taste the smoke in the meat that I usually like. The sides were really good and the meal was great portion wise. Unlike Karen, I went with the spicy bbq sauce and I loved it. The sauce is very important to me and I was super happy with what they have here. Both of our meals came with a piece of cornbread.  The service was really helpful and friendly. The interior is quite unique, but small. Be prepared for a possible line depending on when you arrive, but they do a good job of getting you through. We took our food to go, but there was plenty of picnic table space outside.  We will definitely be back again as there is plenty of food to try. The next time you are in the Northwest part of Las Vegas, you should swing in for some solid bbq."}
{"text":"Always incredible service and friendly staff here. Every time we go their it's like he first time with all the services they provide and outdoor cooking in the wknds. I highly recommend this place to locals and tourists!"}
{"text":"I ate there today for the first time.  Great meal.  I tried the ribs tips  which were great, the brisket which was very tender, just wish it had a bit more smokey taste and I had the pulled pork.  The pork was good but would probably stick with the other two in the future cause even though the pork was good, it wasn't my favorite.  As far as sides I tried the macaroni salad which I though was no better then store bought.  The Mac and cheese which was good.  However I tried two other sides which I thought were the stars of the sides.  They were the yams and collar greens.  I must admit they were fantastic.  The corn bread was like a desert and very sweet.  As I do cook myself I think I would tune down the sweetness a bit and put real corn into the mix to give it more of a country flavor and texture.  I would definitely go back to this restaurant.  The only thing I think that I can complain about would be the outside seating.  Granted it's part of its great atmosphere but the flies were attacking from all sides and there misters were on so high that it felt like I was getting hosed down.  Great food though a must try"}
{"text":"Great service, amazing food and super nice people. My team was working in the area and stumbled upon this place, what an awesome find."}
{"text":"The hunt for great BBQ in Las Vegas brought me here and in some ways I was thrilled and some ways I was disappointed.  Went during lunch on a Thursday, the service seemed slow but it was because the line was deceptively short (aka there were a bunch of people ordering 3 things). Probably about 20-30 minutes from when I entered the line to when I got my food. There is lots of outdoor seating so staying and eating is always an option.  The sides I got were:  1. Cornbread - This was definitely a highlight, really good, right about of sweetness and moisture. Left me wanting more  2. Green Beans - Average, I accidentally got a side of this because the guy misread baked beans. Definitely good enough to get if you like green beans but nothing to write home about.  3. Baked Beans - Very much on point. Good mixture of sweet and savory with the right amount of meat. Good enough to eat a bowl of on your own.  4. Mac and Cheese - Really good, especially for most BBQ places. They made theirs with shells vs elbows which I think was a great choice. It's incredibly cheesy and unlike other places they actually seasoned it (which is what makes it really good).  5. Cole Slaw - I'm very torn by their slaw, it's probably a little undersauced to your traditional slaw. But as a result it gives a very refreshing light taste to it. Steer clear if you're preference is creamy, but I imagine it's a refreshing treat during hot Vegas summers.  And to the meat of the situation:  1. Brisket - This was pretty mediocre. The meat sits in juice/liquid before serving which kept it moist but ensured the flavor was pretty bland. Definitely preferable to a dry and chewy brisket, but prepare to sauce this one if you're a brisket fan. (Bark is almost none existent and I couldn't find a smoke ring, but BBQ fans know that's not everything)  2. Ribs - I'll be honest, these weren't great. Borderline \"eh\". They do give you a good helping of ribs which is pretty good value for price paid. Their prep on the ribs before service is just reheating on the grill, which to me is why they aren't that great. Generally they are kind of dry, don't really fall off the bone, and lack a strong flavor. I would pass unless you're just looking for good value for your money.  3. Pulled Pork - Definitely a good pulled pork. Probably more sauce than I'd like, but oversauced is better than undersauced with pulled pork, IMHO. Texture was consistent with a good pulled pork, a little on the sweet side on account of the sauce.  4. Hot Links - By far the winner in the meats I got. They really had a good balance of heat and flavor, most hot links I have sacrifice one for the other. The preparation is a reheat on the grill, and then they slice it up, so the appearance left me thinking it was almost yesterday's leftovers. That being said, they tasted great and had a right amount of accompanying sauce. If hot links are even remotely your thing, you won't be disappointed.  Sauces - They had two sauces at the end, X for hot, and no X for not. Both are pretty good but not something to write home about. The hot isn't really that hot for anyone who likes spice, but that's probably ideal for your casual spice person.  Side Note - They have tri tip on Tuesday and Thursday, I got there at about 12:30 on a Thursday and they were out.  Long story short, hit or miss on meat, sides are very solid, service is what you'd expect."}
{"text":"January 31, 2015 Saturday - 12:45 PM lunch 2 adults   Atmosphere - 5 stars Food - 5 stars Service - 4 stars  Background - Working on hitting my Diner, Drive-Ins and Dives list.  Atmosphere - I really thought my phone app was taking me to wrong place.  We drive deeper and deeper into a residential neighborhood.  Yep very mixed residential, the business is the back behind a home.  Their neighbor across the street has three horses in the front yard.  Gotta love Nevada!  So how do I describe this place? It is like having a block party in some ones back yard.  Mix match of tables and chairs with picnic tables.  Food   Drinks - A can of Coke.    My Meal     Main Course - I want the tri-tip sandwich but they only serve that on Tuesday and Thursday.  I went with the rib tip dinner as my wife was going to eat two the sides which made for a better deal than the lunch.  So much meat!  It was so good, the smoke in the meat was fabulous       Dessert - I ordered an apple cobbler, I was not able to finish it as I too much of my lunch.  It was more a pie thrown into the bowl.  I love me some hot cinnamon apples so I did not care.  My wife shared hers, not by choice, with a bee.  She stopped eating it after that.  Service - So you get into a long line.  They take your order and you get your bill.  Then you pay your bill.  Then you take it to the serving station.  We had to wait for the rib tips as they had none at the serving station.  Then they forgot about us.  I was going to give then 3 stars for that portion but he gave us an extra apple cobbler.    Future - Awesome BBQ and would love to come back for that!"}
{"text":"I went here not to long ago with the fam, overall great experience. The staff was great, I went on a warm night so eating outside was not an issue. We got different platters so we can try a wide variety of things, the meats were pretty good I just wish there was more sauce selection. I will say the though, BEST Mac-n-cheese ever! Taste so good, made me wanna slap someone's mama!   Places like this almost make me feel like it's a curse to eat clean..."}
{"text":"Amazing Food! My BF seen it on tv so wanted to try it on our Vegas getaway. When arriving I thought I typed the address in wrong on my navi until you pull all the way in the dirt parking lot and see the big sign on the wall.. The staff was so sweet and gave us samples to help us choose our meats . Huge portions! Hot links, pulled pork, ribs, potato salad, baked beans, everything was so delicious. We'll have to make a stop here every time we come to Vegas."}
{"text":"Old style butcher shop, meats cut to order, great staff.  Incredible BBQ cooked and ready to take home!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, workers and atmosphere! I will definitely be back and bring every friend and family member who loves good BBQ. The staff were so friendly to everyone and made you feel like part of the family!"}
{"text":"Great barbecue spot in the northwest and worth the drive even if you're farther out.   Hot links, rib tips, mac and greens for me. Quality meat, delicious sides, and laid back atmosphere to eat. Cornbread was sweet and yummy and the two bbq sauce choices were fine. Theday we came it was hot out and the owner had out cold water bottles for all patrons for free to stay cool. Now that's great customer service."}
{"text":"If like a simple BBQ atmosphere this is the place! Large portions , BBQ is so good!! I loved the pulled pork, mac n cheese, potato salad and corn bread is delish!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here.  We got in before the rush and were lucky enough to sit under the cover.  The brisket, pulled pork and hot link were incredibly good in addition to the mac n cheese and baked beans!  Great place to try and we will definitely go back as the meat was so tender, juicy and good that we did not need BBQ sauce!  The only down side is when it is super hot out, it would be nice to sit indoors some where and not have to shoo flies.  The service line is slow so plan to be there for a while, but the food is DEFINITELY worth the wait.  HUGE portions and excellent quality! Finally a good BBQ place in Vegas!!  A Must Try!"}
{"text":"Great food! A must try, mac n cheese and green beans."}
{"text":"Walk off!! Best BBQ I ever had. Keep up the great work. Friendly staff. Amazing experience."}
{"text":"First off I would like to say the food is very good.  The ribs are spectacular.  The down side is that the way they serve the food is absolutely idiotic.   We literally stood outside the store for over an hour and there weren't 15 people ahead of us.  Then while we are standing there locals just keep walking in to \"go to the butcher shop side.\"  Then an incredibly obnoxious lady yells outside that the next 4 people can come inside, but our group had 5, so she then asked, \"can you people count.\"  Once inside you will notice that all of the food as is normal with BBQ is prepared and sitting in heating trays.  It still took another 25 minutes once we got inside.  This guy needs to learn how to SERVE and HOW RUN A RESAURANT.  Taste alone doesn't work for me."}
{"text":"Chuck (the owner and main butcher) is 'the bomb'.  The politeness of his Canadian heritage, the skill of a master...and he is so very good to all who work for him it makes you happy to do business there! Oh ya: the food and the meats (butcher chop) are hard to beat.  Have the Mac & cheese....just do it!  Your pant size may not appreciate it, but the rest of you will.  :)   All of the meats are outstanding quality and taste!"}
{"text":"This is the last Bbq joint of note to try in Vegas. Wow. I would definitely put it in my top 3 for Las Vegas.   The amount of food for the price, ridiculously huge!  I had the brisket, ribs, links and burnt ends. Ribs were meaty and tender. The burnt ends are falling apart and have a sweet undertone to them. The brisket looked like a roast until I tasted it. A different and pleasing texture than other briskets.  It stands in a Bbq jus waiting to be placed lovingly on your plate. The links are great!  Perfect SNAP to them.   I drove 45 mins to get here and I'd do it again!  Best part of the meal, John himself came out and sat and talked some shop with me. What a nice guy.  Total gentleman."}
{"text":"Chuck is the man.  A business owner who takes pride in his craft and customer care. Thank you so much for coming out in the middle of the night to take care of our butchering for us. You are a true Las Vegan a fantastic butcher and a downright good fella."}
{"text":"This place must be awesome- but I have no idea because the waits are so long we can never seem to get in/no matter what day/time you go- parking lot is s mess of cars and the lines wraps around outside. It's in a really shady part of town and we aren't comfortable enough to wait outside with little ones for a long time. Shame."}
{"text":"My 400th review.   So, this is a special one.   And, since lots of other people have already review John Mull's Meats, I'll make it short.     I thought the address was wrong because the place really is located amongst houses.   But it's a nice place.   There is plenty of parking in a private lot.   We found our way in to the grill.   It's just a simple block house building with the butcher side and the the grill side in it.   We studied the menu for a bit because it was our first time there.   The gals working the counter could not have been more patient and friendly with us.  We selected the three meat special for us to split.   We had ribs, brisket and the hot link with beans and mac and cheese for sides.   The food... well, wow!  It was great.   Everything was cooked well.  The hot link was not over powering but had a nice amount of warmth.  It was all so tasty.   We sat outside in the shade by a cooling mister.   That was pretty nice.   Thanks DDD!  Will I be back?  Heck yeah.   The food is delicious."}
{"text":"Meat market is amazing! Roadkill grill is the best BBQ in Vegas!!!  If you want a great meal or plan on BBqing this place is the best!"}
{"text":"Super great staff. Upgraded parking area with plenty of ada parking and when you exit your car you are doused in  the delicious smell of smoking meat and bbq. I  go for the butcher shop but I've had the bbq and it's on point. The butcher shop is staffed by friendly people who are kind if not busy and know their business. I regularly buy marrow bones for my dog for a great treat. I've gotten a trimmed brisket (uncooked but I've tried the cooked) and was pleased with the beautiful quality. *warning* if your ordering for holidays (they do fresh cuts of meat and even smoked turkeys) order early and pick up early. It gets really busy even the weekend or a few days before a holiday. Though, whatever the wait you'll leave happy and  excited for the meal to come.  The staff is extremely kind, though sometimes a bit busy but they always make time to listen to your questions regarding the butcher shop or the bbq grill.  Guy Fieri was not wrong to feature John Mulls meats on Triple D  it's first years."}
{"text":"There are many definitions of what American bbq should smell like, look like and taste like....after seeing YouTube reviews of Road Kill Grill.... I've wanted to try it for the last two years but something would get in the way of our dining plans...Las Vegas (off the Strip) has so many good moderately priced dining options....that choosing where to dine is a contest of what food experience do you want to try next?  .........And so at 1:30 pm on a warm Spring, Monday afternoon I found myself at The Road Kill Grill.......Wowee---plenty of parking---all outdoor picnic table setting with covered roofs.....  .....totally new BBQ experience for me.....you line up outside the front door entrance where they take your order and give you a yellow order slip that eventually you'll give to a food handler....(they do it this way because there's only room for probably ten people in the buffet serving line)......But...now here's the deal....when they let you into the facility---- you're hit by a blast of cold air!!!! WHY??    Only about 20% of the indoor facility is devoted to the BBQ buffet line----to your right of the customer food line is a delineated area for cutting raw meat---the day I was there---the owner of the place ( identified him from a YouTube video) was fabricating a sub primal whole raw beef brisket....behind the cutter the area was devoted to cold storage and probably dry goods storage and other work rooms----Consequently, because the hot food/cold food buffet line is part of a meat cutting zone--the whole room is kept somewhere between 40 deg to 50 deg Fahrenheit to preserve raw meat being processed for storage or cooking on the outdoor grill pits....  And that's what degraded my bbq experience; although the hot bbq foods are kept in buffet food warmers .....when I sat down outside at my picnic table the meat combinations were cold---and that's NOT tasty to me for food intended to be served hot I'm thinking that all that cold air and dry humidity in the buffet/meat cutting room----sucked the warmth and moisture from the pork ribs and brisket.....  ....The pork ribs tasted bland with none of the aroma of fresh hot bbq.....And the brisket was processed into uniform \"thin\" slices of lean meat---no sign of any juicy smoked and a bit of fatty brisket....fortunately they gave me enough bbq sauce to make the stuff palatable----we eventually took home 70% of what we ordered.....the sausage was scooped out of a deep buffet line food tray; already sliced and coated with a glutinous red sauce----I ate 3 slices and threw away the rest---absolutely cold with a taste of the unknown  .......the chili  was a mix of beans, mystery meat, and seasoned with lots of ketchup and crushed tomato-- The potato salad was standard commissary style that you can buy in 5 pound tubs from a Costco or whatever..  ...I've been to bbq places where three sides, cornbread and bbq sauce can be an awesome  meal.....sadly I had high hopes that this would be a \"go to bbq place\" for me, here in Vegas. It wont be for me....but as i said earlier, bbq is different for different folks---and it's probably why The Road Kill Grill has 4 stars         ......"}
{"text":"I don't usually eat meat but I was raised on a farm and it brought me back memories seeing the hunters bring in their catch to get them cleaned. I love the backyard bbq setting. I had the pulled pork it was amazing. I love their bbq sauce and especially the fact that they had wet wipes to clean my face and hands."}
{"text":"Omgee  I must say if you lookin for the best meat and bbq in vegas this the place to go they are so good and worth every bit of worlds finest meat you can't beat I always recommend it to everyone because you are definitely getting your money worth so anyone love great food should check them out"}
{"text":"This rating is no reflection on the friendly staff, they were wonderful and courteous.  The reason behind the two stars is the food.  I was not impressed and, moreover, a little disappointed.    I ordered a three meat combo with sliced hotlinks, pork ribs, and brisket.  The sauce was a little much on the hotlinks, the pork ribs were dry and seemed like they had been sitting for a few hours, and the brisket did not have any smoke flavor.    The portion of side orders were more than adequate, but one really does not come to a bar-b-que place for the sides, does one?"}
{"text":"I had the 3 meat combo... beef brisket, pulled pork, pulled chicken with 2 sides...mac'ncheese and baked beans...the beef brisket was by far the bast of the meats... the pulled pork and chicken were too much alike and I should have just got one or the other, but there was so much leftover that it was another meal in itself... the man'ncheese was very flavorful they use shell macaroni which had plenty of cheese... the baked beans had a great flavor and had chunks of meat in it....I will be sure to go back here the next time I'm in Vegas..."}
{"text":"OMG OMG can I just say OMG!   My Fiancé and I had the bright idea to host our first Thanksgiving together inviting all our friends over. Neither one of us liked the idea of getting up before the crack of dawn to cook a Turkey.   After a brief debate as who would be cooking the bird I convinced her into giving a Smoked Turkey from John Mulls a try.   It was the best decision we ever made. The Fiancé was worried that we were going to have a dried out rubbery bird due to it sitting out in a smoker and then an hour in the oven but let me tell you we didn't have a dried piece of meat on the entire Bird! The Smokey flavor went throughout the bird and every piece was juicy and delicious.  The shop itself is kinda cramped for a crowd but as long as you avoid mad holiday rushes like Thanksgiving you will be fine just don't open the door to fast as you may knock someone out.  My last trip there the Road Kill grill was outside grilling on an open spit and it was all I could do not to drop the Turkey and run over to the grill and buy one of everything on the menu it smelled so good!  Thank you for a wonderful Thanksgiving meal and I will definitely be back soon. In fact I highly recommend you beat me there."}
{"text":"We LOVE Road Kill Grill and Chuck and crew there!  They always make you feel at home and cook some mean BBQ.  Love all the meat other than the HOT links.  The taste of the meat is really good, but just way too hot for me.  Would love them without the spice.  As for sides, the BEST, way beyond all the others, is the Mac N Cheese.  For me, there is no other side.  The baked beans are WAY TOO spicy and the coleslaw just doesn't taste that good...same goes for the potato salad.  Just go for double Mac N Cheese for your sides...would highly recommend RKG for some great BBQ and they also cater your parties...we've done that as well and it was a BIG hit.  Just be warned that you'll have so much food leftover if you use their # of people guidelines for ordering...just order less than what you think you'll need...ENJOY!"}
{"text":"This place is hidden away in some neighborhoods put is worth finding. This is the best BBQ in Las Vegas. There baked beans are great and I don't even like baked beans."}
{"text":"Meat! And lots of it! The hot links are spicy and delish! Brisket, ohhhhhhh yes! Ribs, pork keep it coming! If you need a meat coma, this is the place for you! Oh, the Mac n cheese is a must! Be sure to take home some dessert too, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"The absolute best BBQ spot in Vegas!  You must try the BBQ and see how good it is. I always get a 3 meat combo and I've had every one of their sides which are all great. My personal recommendation is to get the cut up hot links, pulled chicken or pork and brisket or tri tip with mac n cheese and the yams or baked beans.  The hours are Monday to Saturday from 11a-6p and there is usually a line but it is so worth the wait.  I discovered this gem about 7 years ago and go when I'm craving BBQ but sometimes pick up meat to cook myself. They have been on diners, drive in and dives but more importantly they have been here in Vegas as a butcher / meat supply for over 75 years. Also, if you're a hunter, you can bring your kill to be cut and processed which is just another service they offer."}
{"text":"If you want BBQ food and want great flavor this is your place but bring an empty stomach as the portions are hardy! Outdoor covered tables is a nice touch also."}
{"text":"Amazing barbecue. And Don't forget to get cobbler!! Also dog friendly outside seating if dogs being good"}
{"text":"the food is amazing. great flavor & very fresh. they give more than generous portions. definitely has that good home cooking feel & taste to go right along with it!   I will be back :D"}
{"text":"Love it most delicious bbq place in Las Vegas a must stop for anyone visiting or wanting to eat a good bbq"}
{"text":"If you are looking for good ole' southern eats, look no further. Seriously. Stop. This is the real deal.  I have been lucky enough to eat at John Mull's throughout the years. My most recent was when we had them cater for our company lunch. Best decision we had made in a very long time.  They set up in our parking lot and you could just smell the good food cooking away. We had ribs, chicken, brisket, sausage, mac & cheese, baked beans, potato salad, macaroni salad, peach cobbler, rolls and assorted BBQ sauces.  The mac & cheese is simply some of the best I have ever had. It was cheesy but not greasy. It was ooey and gooey and the perfect balance of flavors.  The baked beans! HOLY MOLY! I am not a big baked bean person but these beans were delicious. They were mixed with ground beef and a concoction of seasonings that just kept me wanting more.   Out of the meats, the spareribs were my favorite. They were tender and just delicious. The brisket was good too - juicy and smokey. The chicken was actually pretty good too. Not dry at all. The sausages, well who doesn't like a good old sausage.  There is never a reason to pass up on something this good. I promise. Good food, Great portions, Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"The wait in line is worth it!  Everything was cooked to perfection! I really have to give it to their macaroni and cheese and their cornbread! Best I ever had anywhere! The meat is so tender and a nice helping for the price! This is the first place where I could not finish my plate at one sitting! Great atmosphere and the service from the employees was admirable.  I would recommend this place for anyone who is traveling to Vegas or to people who live here!"}
{"text":"Awesome... got to fight the crowds a bit and figure out how to order...but once you realize this place is an old school butcher that serves awesome Q.. you just fight your way to the counter! Took my antelope there to be butchered..they met me at 11pm at night...did a great job on making hot salami and hamburger mixing in pork and beef fat. Awesome service guys!  Take your game there for butchering.. these guys know meat."}
{"text":"I decided to take a little adventure to North Las Vegas. Since I'm never in the area it made sense to try to hit as many of my bookmarks as possible.   John Mull's was one of these locations. Located in a more residential part of the of town, I was surprised when we arrived at the restaurant. It has a rural BBQ restaurant feel, which I really liked.   We stood in line and I decided to order the three meat combination with rib tips, ribs and pulled pork with a side mac & cheese and baked beans. I paid at the counter and they they give you a receipt to hand to the guys in the trailer. It was a little disorganized it the guys made sure to take all the customers in the proper order.   They informed me that they were out of rib tips and I opted for the hot links instead. I don't usually like sausage but this ended up being my favorite part of the meal. The ribs and pulled pork were also good but the standouts were the mac & cheese. The mac & cheese was so cheese and delicious. It was some of the best I've had in town.  The service was really nice and friendly. I was especially impressed by the guys serving up the food. They ran out of cornbread and when I asked about white bread the guy went out of his way looking for some for me and was so apologetic when he couldn't locate any.   I'm not a huge BBQ fan typically but I can't wait to try this place when I find myself in North Las Vegas again."}
{"text":"First timers at this joint! BIG line to get your food but worth the wait. We tried the burnt ends, brisket, sausage links, and ribs...the beans, mac & cheese, coleslaw, and potato salad with corn bread. Everything was overall tasty, fresh and clean!"}

{"text":"We had lunch there today. Great food. I had the brisket, and ribs . The meat on the ribs was very good. The brisket way also very good. Sides were Mac and chesse some of the best I've had and the collard greens were good. My only comment is I like a little more smoke flavor but overall a great meal.My wife had the pulled pork and rib tips. She thought the pulled pork was a little salty but I enjoyed a bite of hers. The slaw was good and the baked beans some of the best I've had ever. Service was good . Overall we'll be back just wish it was on the south side of town and that they served sweet tea."}
{"text":"John Mulls is very clean and organized. I've purchased meats and prepared food. The free eggs are also a plus. Pricing is very good and the quality of the meats are great. The bacon is soooo good. It is a jewel in the community. Two Thumbs Up!"}
{"text":"If you have high standards for smoked brisket and pulled pork, then this isn't the place. But if you love backyard, affordable, well portioned BBQ...this is the spot. Vegas is largely lacking awesome hole in the walls like this.  Aside from the slaw, every side dish rocks.  Get a 3-meat combo with ribs, tips, & hot links...then head inside for game to take home.  One stop shop for all that is meat!"}
