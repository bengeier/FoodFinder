{"text":"A fun way to spend a few hours on a Sunday afternoon. A nice mix of high and low end flea market finds, local artisans, food trucks & neighborhood businesses. It's got a quirky, artistic feel to it.  It's neighborhood parking. We lucked out and found parking right away.  But you may want to carpool or Uber it over instead."}
{"text":"This is like a tiny, little Cleveland Flea.  Lots of good food, coffee, tea.  Cleveland bagels make an appearance, Brewnuts, crepes.  Try out a Rising Star Coffee or get something glorious from Cleveland Tea Revival.  There are lots of antiques, paper goods, and beautifully made items.  It all feels very hipster, but in a good way.  Parking isn't great.  We never ended up parking too far away, though.  Love looking for treasures and gifts while trying delicious food."}
{"text":"I loved my first visit to the Sunday Market in Hingetown.   Once a month, from May to October, The Cleveland Flea's French cousin - the Sunday Market - takes place in lovely Hingetown (W.29th & Church, near Ohio City) between the hours of 10am & 4pm.  Parking seems limited, but we got there early and snagged a spot on Church Street.  The Market is a \"brunch\" market so there were many an option to snag a bite to eat including crepes from Elise's crepes (savory or sweet - we tried out ham & gruyere and a classic nutella), Brewnuts (craft beer donuts yum!), Cleveland Bagel Co. bagels and their handcrafted schmear, French macarons from Coquette Patisserie,  & more. This past weekend it was also BYOB and the Market provided mimosa & bloody mary fixins. We also picked up an iced coffee from Rising Star - so refreshing.  The market vendors were awesome - a great selection of handmade goods, candles, jewelry, fashion, vintage items, and antiques. My personal faves were jewelry from Oc√©anne Whimsical Wearables and antiques/vintage goods from The Gallery in Tremont but all the vendors had an awesome selection of eclectic finds.  Pets are welcome, children are welcome - its a great outing for the whole family. Can't wait to head to both the Flea and Market next month.  Many thanks to the Indie Foundry for producing such wonderful events that encompass what a wonderful, unique, friendly, and fabulous city Cleveland is!"}
{"text":"this used to be a very cool event, it's a shame to see it stray so far from its authenticity. new build outs for the flea bar (the owners bar, naturally) every month and thousands of dollars wasted (not to mention the environmental cost) on untreated lumber while booth prices for small businesses have skyrocketed to fund these monthly tiki huts of hers. shop the businesses, not the market.    p.s....where did that $40,000 kickstarter furniture go?"}
{"text":"Stopped by the Sunday market this AM. Very cute! I loved all the little \"shop\" setups. The goods offered were very eclectic and very fun to browse. There were a good few options for brunch. I had an egg and cheese sando on a Brioche bun. It hit the spot.   I brought my Mom to this event and she had a blast looking at all the antiques with me. Reminded me of the days we used to go \"garage sale-ing\" but classier.   I would definitely come back to another Sunday morning Flea! Now I really want to try out the Saturday Flea as well!"}
{"text":"The Cleveland Flea is where it's at y'all! I remember going last year and it wasn't nearly as crowded, but it's okay because they've ramped up the number of staffing and vendors to match the amazing crowd that comes out. It costs $1 to get in, which in my opinion is worth it just for the fun vibe and people watching (and dog watching... so many dogs!).  For those that aren't familiar, Cleveland Flea comes to Superior once a month for a conglomerate of vintage, antique and handmade items as well as some food and beverage trucks. This is one of the better run 'festivals' in the area in my opinion, and I love that it brings so much foot traffic to an area that traditionally hasn't had a lot.  If you're worried about finding the spot, no worries. You'll see lots of folks walking in and out of the entryway and there's plenty of signage to guide you inside. The parking situation in the area can be a bit limited, but to be honest it's far better than most other festivals since there's so much legal street parking.  Whether you're looking for a fun way to spend a summer afternoon, or you're on the lookout for something special, or you just want to do some good old fashioned people watching, the Cleveland Flea is a must visit at least once during your summer. You'll find yourself wanting to return the following month.  * They also are now offering \"Food Flea\" on Sundays after the Saturday Flea, which is a more food-centric version, but at the same venue!"}
