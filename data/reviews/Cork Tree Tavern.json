{"text":"I was just passing through on my way from New York to Chicago and stopped in to this town by accident . I was surprised at the quality of food and service. I had the chicken caccitorre and an IPA from Revolution brewery in Chicago.  What did we do before Yelp?"}
{"text":"To start, the environment is great. Waitress was amazing. Starters and entrees were on point. Drinks were well crafted. Highly recommend. As a side note, I have two children - we did not take them with us for dinner - and I would not take children here for dinner."}
{"text":"First time driving through downtown Amherst, we randomly picked the restaurant with the cute name, and wow, they did not disappoint.   Everything was just excellent!  Our table ordered the cacio e pepe, lobster gnocchi (huge chunks of tender lobster!), pasta bolognese, and the pan-seared halibut with capers. Honestly, everything was so delicious; I was unapologetically sopping up the leftover sauce. Not to mention, they also have an extensive wine list, so we paired our dinner with malbec. We didn't have time to order desert, but now I have an excuse to come back!"}
{"text":"Can't beat the Thursday happy hour with half price apps and wine specials. Nice patio, great service, upscale menu. Love sitting at the bar here."}
{"text":"Had dinner here on Tuesday evening and I was not impressed.  I had oysters on the half shell as an appetizer and my wife had the apple flat bread.  Both appetizers were good and they are the only reason I gave them two stars.  The entrees were terrible.  We both ordered there angel hair pasta with sausage.  The pasta on both plates was stuck together and in a lump in the middle of the plate.  If was the first time I ever had to cut my angel hair pasta to be able to eat it.  The sauce appeared to have been poured over the lump of pasta as it was not incorporated and was lying in the bottom of the bowl under the pasta lump.  The sausage medallions were lying around the outer edge of the lump.  The sauce seemed to be nothing more than olive oil mixed with broccoli and heavily salted.  Our server was a nice young lady but from all indications did not receive adequate training as to being a server.  Based on this experience I will not be returning.  3/27/2018  I decided to give Cork Tree Tavern another chance I have to say the food and service this time was outstanding.  After my first visit I was hard pressed to give them a second try but I am quite happy that I did.  My wife and I stopped in for dinner yesterday evening and the experience was 100% the opposite of what we had previously had.  The server was very knowledgeable of the menu, courteous and very professional.  We were quickly seated and our drink orders were taken.  The server quickly returned with our drinks and bread for the table.  The bread was warm and very good.  He took our orders and returned with our house salads which were also very good.  For an entree I had a bone in ribeye and my wife had the shrimp pasta.  My ribeye was cooked perfectly as were the shrimp in my wife's pasta dish.  The sides were excellent, one of which was local fresh green beans.  The food and service we received yesterday evening completely changed my opinion of the Cork Tree Tavern.  Give it a try."}
