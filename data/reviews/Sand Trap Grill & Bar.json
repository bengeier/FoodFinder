{"text":"Hidden gem!!!! The mussels rival most of the best. The seafood plate will sure to be a favorite.  Highly recommend the soon to be added Bourbon Seafood pizza to the menu. Laid back atmosphere and phenomenal service. No watered down cocktails here."}
{"text":"I have been to this location at least once with each new owner (it was our hangout when it was the Den!), but now I have reason to start coming back again! It's a really cozy little bar, but it's clean and has a great area for playing pool.  Our waitress, Theresa, told us she was new, but she was great at handling our big, boisterous party.  We never had to wait long for refills or for anything else we needed. 

The food is better than your average bar food... We got the tater tots (which were delish!) and I had the buffalo chicken sliders.  The bread that they were on was incredible! It was some kind of Asiago bun that was so fresh, soft, and flavorful that anything on it would have been perfect.  The chicken was very spicy, so people who don't deal with spice beware! I love spice though so it was great for me.  

The only real complaint I have is that the drinks seemed very weakly made... We all noticed how very red the vodka and cranberry seemed, so perhaps stick with beer or wine if you're looking for a little bit of \"happy juice!\""}
{"text":"The service here is wonderful. All you have to do is think about having another drink and wow, it appears on the bar. Food is pretty good as well."}
{"text":"First and last time for me!  I went in planning to eat dinner, have drinks with a friend, and watch a blues jam.  We sat at a table in front of the bar from 6:50 till 7:45.  Never got any help and were totally ignored.  I finally asked the bartender for menus.  Still no service, it was if we were invisible.  I was in town from Texas to visit family and friends, and this was something I never experienced in my life!  We left and went elsewhere, got treated well at the next place.  Hope the owner sees this review.  No stars but it seems I am forced to put something in order to post my review."}
{"text":"Tonight they turned off the Dallas Minnesota football game in the 4th quarter and put PBS on the television. This place is screwed up."}
{"text":"I went to Sand Trap Grill for the first time on a Friday. Great atmosphere and very clean. There was a band playing classic rock which, was awesome. Drinks were very cheap and the food was good and also cheap. Staff was very sweet and accommodating! Highly recommend for casual Friday fun."}
{"text":"Nice and clean. Food is good too. Happy to visit and prices are right.  Watch your credit card though, funny business going on there......beware"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is pretty relaxed like any normal bar, it's an Ohio State bar so when big games are on expect it to be packed. Beer selection is pretty decent for being a little bar, they offer all of your Basil's but their craft beer selection is decent, they offer Stone IPA so I love that! The food is really good, I've personally had a burger and wings and both have been fantastic. It's a nice little bar."}
{"text":"Food was great. I had mussels (fantastic sauce) and an early birdie burger. My mom had the chicken salad and said it was great. My dad had calamari which he wasnt crazy over, but everything else and the service was so good so I gave 5 stars."}
