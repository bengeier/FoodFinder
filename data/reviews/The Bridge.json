{"text":"Family place with home cookin. Had lunch today. Got a hot dog with chili, slaw and onions with a side tossed salad for just under $6. Salad had grape tomatoes and cucumbers and was really fresh and cut up well. Hot dog had great flavor and the chili was delicious. Husband had just under $7 pulled pork sandwich with slaw and fries -he said it was average, but also got biscuits and gravy ($2) and said they were outstanding!!! They have a kids menu and kids cups. Fun, little, local laid back place. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Awesome place! You are treated like family. They have a great selection of food. Squash casserole is to die for! Favorite place for my entire family."}
{"text":"Great burgers (pimento cheese burger) yummy!!! The dip they bring you when you are seated is awesome too."}
{"text":"Arrived at 10:40 for breakfast, however they stop serving breakfast at 10:30. So, we decided to order lunch. We waited for our food for 40 minutes! Waitress stated the delay was due to the health inspector being there. (??)  My chicken tenders and fries were good, but were cold. So, I ended up taking half of my food home. The lettuce in my garden salad seemed to have been frozen and then defrosted.  My brother ordered a hamburger and mashed potatoes. Food was cold, nothing special.  I sure hope they take these reviews into consideration so that they can stay in business. Place is beautiful, reminds me of camping. Waitress was very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"We visited The Bridge during their soft opening for a late breakfast, but things were running so smoothly you'd never know they were still working out the kinks. The service was on point, the food fresh and delicious, and decor on point and kitschy in just the right way. Wherever you sit in the restaurant you have something interesting to look at.   Best of all, they have a large selection of Gluten Free options available at no additional cost. This includes breads, pancakes, even GF bacon! This is hard to find in Charlotte, let alone the burbs.  The Bridge is currently open for breakfast and lunch Monday-Thursday, all day Friday- Saturday, close Sunday. Support local business and good food!"}
{"text":"We have since gone at least 10 times and every single time they've been super polite and friendly and the food has been delicious. We've had breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner (their garlic mashed potatoes must be made with angel wings and baby dreams).  The fact that their meat is cooked over an old school flame makes it awesome. I never order burgers except for here. They're phenomenal.  The place next to them serves snow cones and they're so flippin' good - and cheap. It's a nice \"dessert\". Plus they have cornhole and swings!  Still great!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the parking is behind the building. As you walk in you're met by beautiful landscapes and flowers. They serve lunch, at least that's what we were here for, so I'm not sure why it says brunch. Anyway before you walk in check out the sign with the days specials and veggies for the day. Today, Tuesday was chicken and dumplings with one side and meatloaf with two. We had a group of six and were offered several different options of places to sit. I was thrilled with the \"cowboy caviar \" field peas corn and other things. It was excellent!! Most got the chicken and dumplings. I couldn't decide so I got a vegetable plate to take home and a chef salad to eat there. Everyone was pleased!! The service was kind, fast and very attentive. I would love to know their squash casserole recipe..... promote whoever came up with that!! I highly recommend this treasure, who pride themselves on the beliefs and traditions of their families before them!! I remember this building when it was a convenience store, even then I felt like family coming through reading their meter and stopping in to say hi and get a piece of hoop cheese and TRYING to buy a mnt dew, he never would take my money!!"}
{"text":"Great food,nice people, cool and fun location. I actually ate here about five times while visiting North Carolina. What I love most about about The Bridge is that it captures the true heart of southern home cooking. Not imitation or trying to flair up old recipes, it's real southern food I grew up eating. They also listen to feedback so don't be afraid to give them your opinion. They are locally owned and have been residents of the area there whole lives, they know the people and the food they love and bring that to the table. They also feature great desserts from cheese cake to banana pudding. The first time I walked in it felt like I was walking to grandmas house for Sunday supper. Talking with the owners they want to be able to give back to the community and be a helpful part of it. If you're in the Indian trail/Hemby Bridge/Charlotte area go."}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere are really good. It's smaller And takes a little Longer yet well worth it ."}
{"text":"Pretty standard Greek or American diner type food for breakfast and lunch which is what I was hoping for as I watched them build the place from the ground up over the last year. They did a good job with the construction and it's beautiful inside and out, and the staff was nice and attentive and the black eyed peas and bean and corn relish or whatever you want to call it with flour tortilla chips is a nice touch. I also liked their bread which seemed baked in house, and my buddy Tom's grilled chicken was good. He said they were small but he got two and the prices are reasonable so he had no complaints. We both liked the vegetables we got too, homestyle stuff like lima beans and broccoli casserole for me and green beans and a salad for Tom. My main gripe is with the \"chicken and stuffing casserole\" I got, which was the daily special. First, I'm not sure you want your waitress describing the dish as chicken and stuffing cooked with \"Cream of Celery soup.\" While that is probably the recipe based on what I had and it evokes the homestyle cooking the restaurant to trying to push, in today's restaurant market where you're competing against chef driven places that stresses fresh and local ingredients - which The Bridge is trying to do too by mentioning farmers in their \"About us\" paragraph on their menu and website - I don't think it's good overall to have your wait staff bring up an image of a cook in the kitchen using Campbell's Cream of Celery Soup to make a dish you're selling in a restaurant. The other thing that really annoyed me was the dish itself and the portion. I guess I was expecting something like cafeteria style turkey and dressing or Boston Market's chicken pot pie, where there's at least a few big slices or chunks of chicken. What I got, and which I took pictures of, was an ice cream scoop sized ball of stuffing with maybe a table spoon of small pieces of chicken that looked like they had been picked off another dish, like maybe the cook had some leftover baked chicken or something and decided to make a daily special out of it. There were no chunks of chicken, nothing that looked like it was cut up specifically for the dish, or even anything bigger than the size of peas. And even if there were, how much chicken can you get in an ice cream scoop of \"chicken and stuffing casserole,\" which was basically stuffing. Full disclosure: I'm a chef school drop out from Johnson & Wales and I've only cooked professionally for a few months, but I did get an A in menu planning and recipe cost analysis, and the generally accepted rule for food cost is 33% of the menu price. I'd estimate the recipe cost on my \"chicken\" and stuffing casserole scoop, broccoli casserole scoop and lima beans to be around $1, and the menu price was $7.95. That just annoys me, plus just not getting any chicken when it was supposed to be my protein for the meal. Charge me another $2 if you want, but for my main non vegetable dish called a type of chicken casserole I'd like to eat at least a couple of ounces of chicken. Some chefs will use their daily specials to feature items using seasonal ingredients or ingredients they bought in small quantities or just to test out a dish before adding it to the menu. The Bridge seems to be starting in another direction with their daily specials, which is too bad, because this place is 3 minutes from my house and it has the potential to be a very good restaurant."}
{"text":"We came with 9 people and the service was great. Have nice simple kids menu - pancakes and bacon for all the kids today - and loads of choices for the adults. Eggs were done perfectly - fluffy and warm. Home fries are super crispy. Bacon was done north of medium - so also nice and crispy. Very kid friendly. Waitress was super nice and helpful. 10/10 will come again."}
{"text":"Not a fan. Food looked microwaved and certainly newly thawed. Probably not returning. Staff was very nice environment is cool just the food was very subpar"}
{"text":"I confess I've only been once. Their breakfast is fantastic. Make sure you get there early because that line gets long later in the morning. I'm sure their dinner is good, hadn't tried it yet. The omlettes were awesome. Good tasting coffee. Overall great atmosphere"}
{"text":"Nice local place with southern charm to grab breakfast and lunch.  Love the cowboy caviar!  The prices are very good.  Very friendly staff with plenty of parking in the back.  The only thing I would say is wish there were more menu options."}
{"text":"We had breakfast here and the food was spot on. The service lacked a lot but was made up for by an amazing owner. She greeted us and checked on us more than the waitress who seemed not care a bit about customers. No doubt in my mind they will find the right servers to match the food and the owners passion."}
{"text":"The Bridge restaurant is the newest thing to hit Hemby Bridge in a long time, we went for dinner tonight and the parking lot is a bit tricky to figure out if you're not familiar with the area and there is a snow cone business in the same building where they have corn hole and other games set up which can be a pain when trying to walk through from your car of course you could walk all the way around the building but that's a hike on gravel in the summer. We had about a 25 minute wait not bad, but they had \"live music\" and I'm sorry but it was just loud and annoying! When we got inside it is really small, maybe 20 tables if that and hot I don't know of the AC can't keep up with the kitchen and restaurant or if they had a problem it was not comfortable. They have 2 great big doors and the sun beats right through them, especially at the table, we were at I had to wear my sunglasses. The menu is also small They had 4 dinner entrees, some salads and sandwiches 1 page pretty scant. I ordered the special Chicken Marsala with a side salad, my salad had a hair in it which I told the waitress and she did apologize and bring me another one, but by then my meal was out and it looked delicious and it was darn tasty, however it was drenched in sauce that is water like consistency and it ended up being like soup my noodles were floating it was very difficult to eat without making a mess but again it was really yummy. My mom got a burger and fries and my dad got the hamburger steak, which he also said was delish. The service was good everyone was very polite it is extremely noisy so if you are looking for a quiet place to talk this isn't it. Overall it will be a while before I go back again. Maybe I will try breakfast or lunch as they need more time to work out the dinner kinks."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Great atmosphere. I highly recommend this place. Kevin and Julie have done a wonderful job of presenting a first class menu at affordable prices."}
{"text":"I am a local from hemby bridge. I enjoy supporting local and will give any restaurant a try. Visited Saturday May 13 for an early Mother's Day dinner with my mother and my son.  Parking- not overly crowded. Easy to find and get to with two different entries/exits. Gravel is nice, no mud. First impression, THIS IS CUTE! Cute set up, small and quaint, nicely decorated to get the home cooking country feel. Hostess was extremely sweet and greeted us promptly.  Waitress came and greeted us in a timely fashion, was nice and went over menu with us. Drinks came in mason jars which was a cute touch! Wait staff may need a little over view of what's in the \"hemby bridge caviar\" as she wasn't sure what was in it so we were apprehensive to try. Ordered hamburger steak and Cajun chicken pasta. Hamburger steak was perfect. Cajun chicken was amazing alone but the Pasta was just ok. Cream sauce was chunky like it hadn't been mixed well and lacked a little flavor. I wouldn't order that again. But that chicken alone would make an awesome sandwich of some sort.  Opted out of desserts.  Overall was fine. Would try breakfast and lunch before going back for dinner."}
{"text":"Have no idea how there food is. Went here today for lunch and it was quite busy. Put out name on list and waited outside. 40 minutes later still not seated and to find out they just skipped over our name. Bad customer service."}
{"text":"My wife and I live near The Bridge. We first tried it several weeks ago and each time we have been pleased with both the quality of the food and the service. We love the owners. They're amazing people. They seem to care very deeply about their customers and the quality of both the food and service. They always come by and ask how we liked it. When they realize the coconut cake was a little dry, they told us they weren't going to charge us for it. And it seems everyone who works there goes out of their way to be helpful and friendly. The breakfast is great and everything We've had on the dinner menu was wonderful. They are continually working hard to improve everything they do. Observing the overall operation it is clear they try to do everything with excellence."}
{"text":"Food is reasonably priced food.   Good brunch menu.    Cons: Waitress was slow and wasn't around much.   It was hard to get the check as she disappeared for a while and all the other waitresses passed with offering to help.  Bathrooms need some work for a new place, broken and all supplies including soap we're out.   Would give it a second try someday."}
{"text":"We had the opportunity of being one of the first customers at The Bridge restaurant while enjoying the Hemby Bridge Christmas Parade. The steak sandwich was outstanding. We will be back once you get your dining room open."}
{"text":"Months have passed since my first visit so decided to stop in for breakfast on a Friday. No wait. Plenty of open tables. Light crowd. The decor is still warm and cozy. Reminiscent of a log cabin.   I did wait a bit for my order to be taken and it did take awhile to be served. Most likely due to the staff congregating behind that counter and chatting.   Not once offered a refill and had to flag the waitress a few times for additional things I needed.  As for what I had this time around- the eggs still tasted fresh. Bacon again was not crisp enough and somewhat bland. Potatoes were ok. Pancake was tasteless and gritty. Still no rich buttermilk taste or fluff. Steak is now on menu so I ordered it. It was pretty sad. Not sure of the cut but it was very tough and oddly seasoned. I took about two bites and decided I was not a fan.  Overall, my breakfast this time was disappointing. Service could use improvement. With the right cooks and cooking methods this place truly has potential. Such a great location and space that I really hope the food does get taken up quite a few notches."}
{"text":"This has become a charming local favorite.  It doesn't seat many people but that's the charm of it along with the country decor and atmosphere.  The staff is always so sweet & they have popcorn ice which is a win win for me!  The chicken salad croissant is my favorite.  Made fresh daily and all white meat.  Closed Sundays.  A family fav."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying, \"We will go back.\"   I am giving it a 3-star rating for a few reasons, but there were some 5-star qualities.   The atmosphere was wonderful. The gravy, biscuits, bacon, eggs, grits, and fruit were delicious. The pricing was on point. The serving proportions were generous.   Lisa C. was our server, and she was extremely nice.   The lower rating is due to the following:  1) the coffee was extremely weak and watered down.   2) the pancakes were too heavy and room temperature. My mom ate 3 small bites of two of the pancakes and threw them to the side. No one even asked why she did not finish them or eat much of them. The syrup was cold, making the pancakes even colder.   3) to a minor point, there was eggshell in my food. Mistakes like this can happen, which is not a big deal.   Nevertheless, with a 3-star rating, Lisa as our server, good atmosphere, and the gravy was some of the best, we will be happy to return soon. Hopefully, we can give a better rating then. I live in Los Angeles, so my family will be returning sooner than I."}
{"text":"It occurred to me today that it was exactly one year (first Saturday in June) that I first visited The Bridge and had a wonderful experience then. I have visited the Bridge dozens of times since and have never been disappointed.  The Bridge is hospitality defined.  Good food, freshly prepared, excellent service and servers.  Always a warm friendly welcome---it's a nice place to be."}
{"text":"Signs and hours posted say they are open until 2:30. Got there at 2:20 and closed. Disappointing."}
{"text":"The Bridge is a traditional diner-style spot in Hemby Bridge. You don't come to a place like this looking for Michelin starred meals; you come for simple, hearty food. On our visit, The Bridge delivered.   I have to address the parking situation that's been mentioned in several reviews before mine -- but I didn't see the issue. There's an expansive gravel lot behind the place. You really can't miss it, so I'm not sure where many people seem to be having trouble.   Our party of three was greeted and shown to our seats immediately when we arrived near 1pm on a Saturday. Our server, Terri, let us know that she was new to The Bridge and was still getting used to her touchscreen ordering system. It only seemed to take her a moment, and she was funny and pleasant in her delivery.   Our meals came out quickly. I ordered The Big K, which is a sandwich with thick cut fried bologna topped with chili and onions. I asked for gluten free bread, which I was so pleased to see on the menu. I wouldn't expect little places like this to go out of their way to make GF accommodations -- most diners and small town spots don't -- and it was nice to order something directly off the menu instead of cobbling together a vegetable plate. Even better: there's not an additional charge for GF bread and buns. Their website says, \"why should you have to pay for having an allergy you can't help?\" Preach!  My sandwich was excellent. I know bologna has a poor reputation, but it was delightful and I'm not too pretentious to order processed meat. The addition of chili and onions put it over the top. I would order this again in a heartbeat. I had slaw on the side, which was served in a very fine dice. The flavors were well balanced and it didn't leave a puddle on my plate.  We did not stay for dessert, as we were planning to go to Snoball Cabin next door, but I hear the homemade desserts at The Bridge are great.   Once our check came, we were directed to pay at the cashier by the door. The three of us left with full bellies.   The only thing I feel The Bridge is missing is an all-day breakfast menu. The Charlotte region needs more places to get bacon and eggs at 2pm, and I'm confident this spot would be killer with that option."}
{"text":"Stopped at this ultra-cute restaurant with the kids the other day; don't remember what day of the week or what time but we did not have a wait to get seated...although I do think we got the last table as the place was busy. Our waitress, Megan, was lovely. The food came out in a timely manner, except for the side salad which my son would have preferred as an appetizer but came with the meal. Not a big deal. The food was delicious! My kids are picky and they were happy. There was enough grilled chicken to take home...two huge pieces came on the plate, and one of them went home with the salad for a nice dinner that night. We always rate our restaurants on a scale of 1-10 when we leave and it got a 7-9 from all three of us. Can't wait to go again! (Note to Penny's in Mint Hill, which I reviewed earlier: The Bridge is what you want to be.)"}
{"text":"The food is southern and pretty good, the service is outstanding. One is really make to feel at home. I'll go back many times."}
{"text":"Very frustrated with this experience.  I waited to go to The Bridge because of the bad reviews on how slow service was.  Today I have it a shot and here's my feedback:  The staff all were very friendly.  We were greeted with smiling faces and quickly taken to our seats.  It's a beautiful little restaurant, nicely remodeled with awesome outdoor seating at the intersection of a one light town.  A few minutes after we were seated our waitress came and asked for our order.  I started off with our drink order, as I write this I now think she didn't recognize we didn't have drinks.  She took our order and off she went.  She brought our drinks back in a timely manner, but only half.  Several minutes later I finally saw her again to ask for our drinks.  It seemed to be able 15 minutes later before our food came.  I'm not overly upset about the delay but what is aggravates me is when the food was dropped off I heard one waitress say \"let me get you syrup.\"  We waited about five minutes before I had to get up to go to the waitress station to ask for syrup and a few other things.    The food was actually really good.  The country ham was a little small and the edges were over cooked but the rest of our meal was great.  They have the best sawmill/ sausage gravy I've ever eaten!  I don't say that lightly.  By the way, the drinks we had to follow up with as I mentioned earlier were now empty and no one to refill them.  During our visit the first third of the time we were there went off without a hitch.  A couple of the staff members stopped by to make sure we \"placed\" our order but our waitress left us high and dry.  I never got a receipt and had to chase that down, I had some food I was taking to go and had to walk out with it in my hands with no container.    I'll probably give this place one more shot because I think we just got a dud...we shall see."}
{"text":"Great local breakfast spot! Food is good and the staff is friendly . They have really transformed the building that used to be an eyesore into an attractive  local spot."}
{"text":"Every time we have tried to go to The Bridge, it has been packed. This is partially an issue because they are open mostly for breakfast (though they recently started opening for dinner on the weekends), but one day we finally waited out the wait and were lucky enough to score a table - but they were still packed. I guess the folks in Hemby Bridge have been waiting for something other than chain-like restaurants (to be fair, Hemby Bridge isn't large, so there are never going to be a ton of options either way).  Regardless - the greeting, and the people who you hang out with if you choose to wait, are very pleasant. It almost makes you want to wait. They even have a great outdoor patio, including a nice swing. And if it's near the middle of the day you can instead choose to have a treat at the snowball place next door.  If you choose to tough it out, then the menu is essentially a fancied up Waffle House. Does that mean that they are better than the Waffle House? Depends. Once you get past the wait, you are likely to wait some more. They are more than likely going to treat you nicely, which is hit or miss elsewhere. But it's going to be slower than the wham, bam, thank you ma'am at the Waffle House. It certainly isn't relaxing, however, as there are just too many people to make it so.  When it comes to food, it's good - not greasy like the fast-serve places, but also lacking the down-home flavor (ie: massive amounts of grease) from those as well. So there are tradeoffs, not the least of which is the amount of time it will take you."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here a few times for breakfast and once for lunch, and every time I am more and more impressed! As many have said, the food and the service are both great. The atmosphere is warm and friendly, and on top of that, the interior of the building is well built and so attractive--even the bathroom is  beautiful and clean!"}
{"text":"Ate lunch at The Bridge.  The chicken salad on croissant was bland.  We ordered a side salad and it was literally shredded lettuce on a plate with nothing else - only the lettuce.  We also ordered BBQ platters and they told us they had no BBQ sauce.  The BBQ was ok.  The sweet potato casserole and cole slaw were good. Service was friendly.  Lots of staff taking care of us.  I'll give this place some time to work out the kinks before giving it a second chance."}
{"text":"I live nearby and really wanted to support local but place wasn't great. Quite loud, food mediocre.  Staff was really nice so I feel bad but food needs improvement."}
{"text":"Finally a restaurant worth mentioning in Indian Trail!! The menu has a nice selection of food, from country style to great sandwiches. The bean dip they bring as an appetizer was very tasty as well. This new gem has a warm and inviting atmosphere with good food, what more do you need?"}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a friend and this place was packed. The food wasn't bad, it was just nothing special. Don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch and this is a rather new place, seemed busy and upbeat. Ambiance is pleasant and service is true to Southern custom, very friendly and over the top. Temperature was cold in the restaurant, since it is a rainy and chilly day outside. Clean place and rather rustic structure, reminds me of a northern cabin home. Very pleasant experience overall,"}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Our expectations weren't high going in. Unfortunately, the food quality was poorer than we could have imagined. The fries tasted like frozen fries that had been baked. They were cold, dry and hard. Hamburger tasted like one of those premade patties one buys in the freezer section of a grocery store, hard and full of filler. The meatloaf was grayish in color. So were the green beans.   The service was friendly but didn't compensate for the food. Today's visit was a one-off for us. We won't go back."}
{"text":"Fantastic daily specials, friendly staff and quick service. Try the grilled salmon salad (when available)!"}
{"text":"Breakfast - not real syrup & fake creamer.  Get real syrup, real butter & real cream (half & half).  I had breakfast there once & never again due to these reasons."}
