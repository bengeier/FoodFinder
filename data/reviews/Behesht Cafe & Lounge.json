{"text":"i've been here multiple times and each time, it gets worse and worse. 

their food sizes have significantly gone down, their service is absolutely horrendous and lazy, and their shisha sucks. 

everything about this place is lazy. their service does not attend to your shisha or you in any way."}
{"text":"We've been there 3 or 4 times, each was great. Good stuff, quick service, delicious food, tea and shisha. Nice place to relax, especially we like their areas with rugs and pillows."}
{"text":"Lovely place, great staff. Good hooka, Food was also good. Loved their chaee ba hel and the set up of the place. Very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Nice interior decor. Perfect for smoking shisha. Did not try the food but seemed quite nice. Service was decent too except for a guy whom kept coming over on and on to make sure we are OK and it could have been bugging us if it was a little more. Nevertheless clean and comfy place."}
{"text":"It's good place for some shisha and tea, we sometimes have some food, it's not full menus though, nevertheless it's good place to hang out. We go there regularly :) recommend it for casual hangouts."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Disgusting service. Don't recommend it at all. The waitress was extremely rude, impolite and was literally yelling at us. The place is empty, nothing good I the menu to order expect for the tea. Is there something better on the menu?? Absolutely not!!! Literally just the tea. Ten million other places out there. We are a big group and you just lost our business!!!!"}
{"text":"I believe the place is really cozy and the variety of flavors for Shisha that they have is really amazing, although the price is a little higher than what I used to pay for a good shisha in Montreal."}
{"text":"My Persian friend introduced me to this place. I love the decor! Its old fashioned. Magic carpets everywhere!! There is a fountain in the middle. We got a booth and I felt like Sultan! We asked for playing cards and had great times. They do have free WiFi, but when I asked one of the employees for the password he took my phone and typed it instead of telling me what the password is. I thought that was a little weird. Shisha is average. A little overpriced. Food is OK, not the best though. I suggest that you come here for the Shisha, tea, and the ambient rather than the food."}
{"text":"One of the worst Shisha bars in Toronto. I went here about 2 months ago with 2 of my friends and I requested a detailed bill. The girl behind the cash hesitated at first but then gave me the bill. I looked at it later on and noticed a $5 service charge for a table of 3 without even telling us beforehand or showing any notice. This is an absolute scam and not the right way to run a business. Absolutely disappointed and definitely not recommending this place. 

P.s: It is not about the $5, it is about the principle. You can't stay in business for long if you keep lying to your customers and charge them hidden fees."}
{"text":"good food, ok atmosphere and overall its better than average restaurant but nothing special"}
{"text":"Cheap people ! No customer service! Hidden fees! Extra charge! Worst experince ! Doesn't even deserve 1 star ! Check your bill before you pay !"}
{"text":"Super disappointed. 
I had never been here and travelled an hour because we had a visitor from Iran and she wanted to check the place out since she had heard so much about it. 
We were told after a bit of back and forth that we did not have to pay the cover charge of $10 for karaoke night (starting at 10pm) because we were not told about it when we made a reservation for 8pm. We had already ordered food and drinks and everything and were in a bit of a rush to leave. So when we got the bill we just payed it and it didn't realize until afterward that they had charged us for the cover charge that our server had said management would cover!!! They don't for you a breakdown of your order they just give you an amount. This is super sketchy and beyond unprofessional. Yes $10 is not a ridiculous amount but when you trick your customers in to paying it that is unacceptable. I will never be attending this establishment again and I will make sure that none of my friends and family attend it either. 
Terrible...if I could give negative stars I would."}
{"text":"Very good persian tea and good shisha too. Never leave the opportunity to play takhte on persian style."}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD! Great atmosphere. Good service. We are from san francisco and during our trip we came twice here. I really love it. I wish they had one in San Francisco! It would be very popular."}
{"text":"The place is really really nice. It has a parking right in front of it which is perfect but the service is slow, it takes 20-30 mins for them to bring your shisha and to be honest, the shisha isn't that perfect! In general, its a good place to go once in a while just to change your mood but definitely not an everyday shisha place!"}
{"text":"This is a good place for chilling with friends esp late at night. However it is over priced and the quality of food is not that great. Probably a good choice for tea, shisha, and playing cards with friends. The staff were nice and friendly"}
{"text":"Here's my problem with this place: I haven't been here in years and once I heard they do karaoke nights on Wednesdays I decided to bring my friends here. We called earlier on in the day and made reservations for 8 people. We came here at 8:15 pm, ordered drinks and food. At 10 pm, they came to our table and told us to pay an additional $10 each if we wanted to stay for the karaoke. We were so confused since we were not told that there was going to be a cover. They could've given us that information on the phone when we made the reservation earlier on in the day. If they had told us that there's a $10 cover BEFORE we sat down and ordered food then we would've gladly paid it. Point is, it's not about the amount of money that they told us to pay, it's the principle. It just doesn't make sense for me to come to a place, eat, drink, order shisha and then after spending all this money be told that we have to pay EXTRA. We should've been told this beforehand. At the end they told us that we don't have to pay but they made it very clear that it's coming out of their own pocket. 

UPDATE: right when we were leaving, my friend ask for the bill before paying and she realized that they were going to charge us the $10 SECRETLY. If we hadn't asked for a receipt we would've unknowingly paid for it. This is incredibly unprofessional and not to mention, SHADY!! 

The ONLY thing that's keeping this place alive is DJ Bliss who plays the karaoke. The owners should seriously worship him for bringing so much business for them."}
{"text":"Good shisha. Great ambience. But I went in looking for proper dinner and had specifically asked on the phone if they had a full dinner menu. The food was not bad at all, but no option for rice had me totally bummed out. Also a tad bit over priced for the serving size. 

Nevertheless, I would still go back to relax, hang out, smoke some shisha, drink some tea, eat some jujey... Without any rice."}
{"text":"Lets start with what I like about this place: Their variety of shisha flavour and their decor. I got adventurous and tried the rum flavour shisha. It was super sweet. So, I suggest not getting it and instead go for mint or double apple. This place can get quite busy on a weekend night. We had to sit on the table until one of the bed like booths got empty.
The food is alright and the prices are high. My boyfriend and I ended up spending over $60 for shisha and food here, but of course we were hungry. The staff is friendly and the service alright."}
