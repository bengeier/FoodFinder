{"text":"The only time I got excited about this pizzeria was when I received a coupon on the back of my receipt from Fry's grocery store stating ''One Free Large Pizza\". So instead of making dinner one night my family and I decided to use up that coupon. I googled the address to see where this place was located and based off of my phone it didn't look very far. As we were driving I figured out that this place is way out in the middle of no where and was a pretty lengthy drive. As we drove up we were immediately disappointed and didn't look like a type of place that would have good  food. That's when that saying kicked in to my head, \"never judge a book by its cover\". 

We went inside and luckily it was nice and clean. The nice waiter asked us,\" if this was for take out or dine in\"? I said, \"dine in please\". So he grabbed a  few menus and seated us at a table. We got our drinks and we showed him our coupon when we were ready to order. Up on the wall they had pizza trays showing you exactly what the sizes of the pizza they had. Once they brought us our pizza I was disappointed how small the pizza was and when I looked at the sizes on the wall to compare what size of pizza we got and we got the small. At that point I felt cheated from our coupon. I didn't want to make a big deal about it considering that we weren't going to be paying for this. 

I started taking a bite and I was looking forward to at least enjoying a good pizza but I was again disappointed of how tasteless the pizza tasted. It literally tasted like cardboard. No taste all whats so ever!!! My family and I looked at each other and I knew we were thinking the same thing of how blah the  pizza tasted. Again we were going to make a big deal about it since it was a free pizza. We ate our pizza only because we were hungry since we saved our appetite for this not so amazing pizzeria. 

As soon as we finished our pizza the waiter gave us our bill and we paid. As I saw other people coming in to order and all I could think of is wish them luck because they probably don't know how awful the pizza is. 

If I get another coupon from this place I certainly will NOT be going back at all. To be honest with you I rather spend my money on a frozen pizza that actually has taste in their pizza than to come to this very disappointing pizzeria."}
{"text":"I had never tried Eddie Maroni's and being new to the area I wanted to support my local businesses. I placed my order online and got a confirmation with everything correct. Then I waited. And waited. 30 minutes later I called and got a busy signal. 45 minutes later I called and got an answering machine stating that they were now closed. I quickly pulled their website back up along with my confirmation which showed an order time of 8:08 and a closing time of 9pm. I left a message with my order number and said that hopefully they were on their way. Of course they never came. I left another message asking for the management to please return my call regarding the situation and never received a phone call. It's one thing to screw up as a business, but to not even attempt to rectify the situation is really bad. Is business that booming in Queen Creek that you can just ignore customers who really wanted to give you a chance? Good luck with that."}
{"text":"Used to be a take and bake pizza place.  Pizza was OK, nothing to write home about.  Apparently hey did OK because they became an actual restaurant, but with not a lot of choices out in STV I can see why.  Now they have either moved or closed down altogether."}
{"text":"Wow is all I have to say and hold up before you rush off to try this pizza just let me tell you how bad this pizza was. I bet you were thinking this was going to end better maybe the cinderella story of the place you never heard of before that ended up having the best food ever....well its the exact opposite of that.
Let me start all over from the beginning.....we got a coupon on the back of the Fry's receipt, one large pizza for free. Since we already had dinner planned that night we decided to use it for another day. Sooner or later that day was bound to come and just the other night we found ourselves on our way to this unknown pizzeria.
We pulled up outside and it was a hole in the wall that we should have drove away from. We were really hungry and since the looks of places have been wrong before we decided to give it a try since it was free. We ordered some bread sticks to come before the pizza which did take away from being free but we love eating bread so we wanted to give it a try.
Fast forward to the eating part the bread sticks were nasty the pizza were tasteless, and to top that off the coupon said large and they gave up a small pizza. We should have made it a Digiorno night.
The coupon said expires on Oct 31 which should have gave us a hint stay away from this scary place. If you happen to get a coupon for this at Fry's turn the receipt back over and see how many fuel points you have to and drive yourself to a better place to get a quality pizza."}
