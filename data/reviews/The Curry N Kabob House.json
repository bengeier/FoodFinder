{"text":"I have been waiting weeks to eat at The Curry N Kabob House. Weeks I tell you, and the opportunity finally arrived where my fiancé wanted to go. We got there around 8:40 p.m. which I knew was late and pushing it only to discover they were opened till 10. Perfect!! Coming from a kitchen if a restaurant is about to close I wont go there its rude and disrespectful!  To start off there weren't any cars in the parking lot, should have took that as a major warning sign. When we walked in the first thing I notice beside the server sitting at the bar enjoying her soda was that the restaurant is decorated like a club in down town... Ok not what we were expecting but we are willing to work with it. We are after all in Cornelius 18 miles north of Charlotte this is not the ideal location or city for this kind of décor. We receive our menus and let me say that menu is HUGE. Huge however does not mean good. I've learned that keeping your menu small, simple and focusing on the flavors and techniques will get you a lot further when starting a new restaurant then a menu eight pages long. Next the prices were outrageous. As I said I'm a cook and so is my fiancé we know how to cost that all out and there is absolutely no reason any of that should cost that much! I'm not paying $22 for shrimp. Going back to the menu I really felt like I was being nickelled and dimed for everything. I don't get papadum with my entrée unless I pay for it, and can someone tell me WHY there aren't any Indian based desserts on the menu? I am at an Indian restaurant therefore the dessert menu should have Indian desserts. So after placing our order, which my fiancé had to ask if he could get something besides water, she really wasn't interested in us after we declined the cocktail menu, we waited. We were the only guests in the restaurant, and while sitting I started to overhear a conversation between a manager and a gentlemen he was trying to talk into taking his job. Yes take his job. From the time we placed our order to the time we left I heard how well the business was not doing, their rules, their expectations, how much the manager made as well as the servers and bus boys.  My favorite part was the manager telling the other gentlemen that the owners were wanting Curry N Kabob House to be a five star restaurant and they couldn't achieve that if adults brought their kids in... Really???? Not to mention they had hotel pans that they used for the buffet sitting on the floor in plain sight. Food finally arrives and my fiancés Chicken Tikka Masala has five pieces of chicken and that's it. My Chicken Curry which I ordered medium ( I know better than to go spicy) was still way to spicy for me to handle and yes I can handle heat.  There is really nothing nice I can say about my experience I paid over $30 for dinner and left completely dissatisfied."}
{"text":"we were the only people in the place last night, adn It was an all-around odd experience-- Weather Channel music, classy decor, but...why?! it's not really a high-end place. The food was decent, albeit a little heavy on the cilantro. It may have been bc it was empty, but I felt very \"watched\" by the waitstaff....hurray awkward conversations. The naan was rather pizza-doughy to me. I liked it, but it was different from any other naan i've had. i dunno.   I'll just stick to going to  Bombay Cuisine in Mooresville or Sangam"}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant to Cornelius that my wife insisted we try.  It doesn't appear to be open, but they've already started their soft opening.. So we decided to try them for take-out.  My wife was impressed with the decor and their bar, and I was very impressed with the food she brought home.  I had the Chicken Chettinad which lived up to the description of SPICY SPECIALTY. Lots of flavor, lots of spice.  Under the vegetarian section, my wife order the Chana Masala (chickpea dish) and it too was excellent.  We're still big fans of Sangam's but it's great to have another choice in the neighborhood.    However I'm still waiting for a quick healthy salad option in Cornelius.. like Crisp in Uptown or M Fresh in Columbia :)  ...If anyone has suggestions please share."}
{"text":"Above average Indian food with nice decor hidden in a little strip mall.  I came in for lunch today to see at not-so-busy restaurant with beautiful decor.  I was quickly seated and handed lunch and dinner menu's.  I think my waiter was new as he was a little nervous but highly attentive.  I asked him if he was new and he said he was normally bus boy but they had him giving this a shot(nice guy).  As far as the lunch menu goes, there were many choices, but what looked like the best deal was the 3 course special.  $9 for vegetarian, $10 for chicken, and $15 for seafood.  Came with a soup or salad, entree with dal, and a desert.  I was told that tikka masala would be the sauce/style for the day.  I should have gone chicken(tikka), because their vegetarian should just say tofu, not vegetarian.  I hoped for mixed veggies or at least some chick peas, but it was basically sauce with 4 or 5 chunks of tofu in it.  I'm not a hate'r of tofu, i just didn't know it was that common in Indian food that it would be considered a main course without mention.  Ironically, this \"vegetarian\" meal was served with a chicken soup.  A little grainy but flavor was good overall.  My waiter was spot on, I'd say almost overly attentive if I wasn't always in need of something.  I took a brief look at entrees and they sounded great.  $12-18ish range.  Not too bad for being that close to the peninsula and Lake Norman.  When I walked in the door, I was hoping for 5 stars, beautiful layout, great smell, nice people.  But the food is 3-4 stars with promise.  I hope they advertise well or do something for attention because this isn't the best location for walk-ins.  I'll be back when in the area at lunch, nice diversion from my local go to's for lunch specials(Sushi at the Lake or China Bistro.)"}
{"text":"Ordered a lunch combo on phone to pick up at a certain time. When I got there to pick up my order, the attendant casually tells me that the combination I ordered was not part of lunch special hence they have nothing for me. I told them that I was willing to pay more and that I needed to pick up something right then because I was running late for a meeting. The attendant said that I would have to wait ~20 minutes for anything. She was rude and didn't try to make up for her mistake. She didn't provide me with any options.   If she gave me a wrong combo choice on the phone, the least she could do was one of the following: - Suck it up and give me what I asked for - Give me what I asked for at a higher price  Instead she just sits there and waits for me to come in to give me this message. I wish I had more time to talk to the manager and tell him how ridiculously his staff behaved.   Terrible service! No idea how the food is. It was not fun to stay hungry!"}
{"text":"Very good food in an upscale setting.  We first happened upon this restaurant on its opening night thinking it was still the old Santorini restaurant.  The food that night was very good although they did not yet have the full menu available.  The food has been every bit as good since and they have even served us gajar halwa even when it was not yet on the menu.  Every time we have visited the owner or the owner's wife has checked in on us to make sure our dining experience was good.  The only reason I am not giving five stars on the review is that the some of the service staff is inexperienced unfortunately.  This is the best indian food I have had since I moved to the north side of the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"Forget going to this place again, I wouldn't even recommend it to anyone. Just to be clear, the service here was good, but that's about the only thing I liked here.  So we heard about this place opening up, and since I'm Indian, I'm always looking for good Indian restaurants around Charlotte. We decided to go here on a stormy evening for dinner. The decor was nice, which made me think \"oh wow, an upscale Indian restaurant.\" Upscale my foot! The only thing upscale about this place is the decor and prices and it stops at that. Overpriced mediocre food, some less than average, and some misleading.  Also, it makes me laugh when non-Indians call this place \"authentic.\" Keep reading to find out why.  Looking at the menu, I found palak paneer, marked at $14. Um, what?? It should NOT cost over $9 unless it has gold flakes mixed in or something. Pieces of paneer (firm cottage cheese) cooked in spinach puree - why does this have to cost $14? I can cook it for 10 people for a lower price than that! Fail #1  Next, I asked the server what kind of noodles they used for the hakka noodles. He said \"thick noodles like spaghetti.\" No, no, no, no... I have grown up in India and Indo-Chinese cuisine is my favorite in the world. Using spaghetti for that is a disgusting insult. Hakka noodles are supposed to be thin noodles, made with Angel Hair or something like it. Fail #2  The dessert section had totally non-Indian things like Tiramisu and Apple crumble. Get your shit right, you are running an Indian restaurant. I expect to see desserts like gulabjamun, rasgulla, gajar halwa and kulfi, maybe some Indian flavors of ice cream. I don't go to an Indian restaurant to eat cheesecakes and creme brulees. Fail #3  We went over the menu again and decided to order chilli shrimp for appetizers since the description on their menu looked authentic. From their menu: \"Shrimp flavored with soy sauce, vinegar, ginger-garlic paste, sauteed with jalapenos, green peppers and chilli sauce.\" This is what arrived to our table: Shrimp in really hot RED sauce, no jalapenos, no soy sauce, and, wait for it... CURRY LEAVES! Did I mention HOT? I'm Indian and this was hot even for my taste buds! Let me tell you something, dear friends at Curry N Kabab House... I make this thing at home, and even a spoonful of soy sauce gives this a lovely dark brown color. It's not supposed to be red, and should not have curry leaves. In fact nothing in Indo-Chinese food should have curry leaves so get rid of that! Fail#4  Then came the Tandoori chicken. The chicken was not well marinated and I kept thanking my stars for the mint chutney that came with it, because without it the chicken wouldn't have been palatable. Also, the essence of Tandoori chicken is in the drumsticks. A single Google image search for \"tandoori chicken\" will show you pieces of chicken drumsticks, marinated with ginger-garlic paste and red chilli powder and grilled. Our tandoori chicken came out sizzling hot, without a single drumstick, and yes, without any flavor. Also, bright orange food color? So tacky... Get rid of it, it's 2013! Fail#5  Lastly (thank God) the lamb biryani. It had so much masala, I was sure this would be good. Wrong. It completely lacked flavor. It amazes me how someone can fuck up biryani but still make it look good. In fact, it amazes me how a restaurant can call itself \"upscale,\" have everything overpriced, and still manage to not make a single thing on the menu right. And to think we spent $40 here for two. Shame on you Currey N Kabab House, Your restaurant sucked just as much as your other one, Curries and Cakes. You are the biggest Indian food failure in all of Charlotte."}
{"text":"Uhhh, I hate writing bad reviews but this is definitely warranted. The poor waiter who said he was the manager clearly didn't know Indian food nor how to wait tables. He was quite nice but the guy didn't have a clue. Most importantly the food. Dinner is fairly pricey and we got the Tikka Masala Kabobs and the sauce tasted like Tandoori and the chicken was super fatty. Did not resemble any Tikka Masala I have ever had. We also got the vegetable Korma which was okay. Save your money or go visit Sangam for some amazing Indian food."}
{"text":"We decided to go there for lunch on a Saturday after reading a positive review in the local newspaper.  The experience was certainly mixed.    The sign on the door said they were open from 11:00 AM and we arrived at about 11:30 AM.  The hostess said they just had the buffet on Saturday for lunch and that it was not quite ready, hmm 11:00 ... 11:30, but that it would be ready in a few minutes.  My wife reminded the hostess that the sign on the door said 11:00 AM and she agreed.    We opted to stay.  The server came for our drink order, and we ordered iced tea.  A few minutes later she returned with water and said they were in the process of making the tea.  We watched as the hostess labeled items for the buffet as they were brought out by the chef.  This went on for 30 minutes.  It's now about noon.  Then someone, apparently the owner, came and walked us down the buffet telling us about each item.  I asked about anything with mango because of allergies and she thought I was interested in being served an item with mango.  We got our food and everything was quite good compared to other Indian food in the area, but by then the problems with the service had become sufficiently annoying to make the food secondary.  Then finally our iced tea arrived.  We had ordered unsweetened tea, I know a problem in NC, but the unsweetened tea was certainly okay.  There was no artificial sweetener on the table so I asked the apparent owner for some.  Ten minutes later she emerged with a single packet of pink sweetener on a plate.  I think she may have gone next door to another restaurant to get it.  By that time we gave up and made the best of the above average food.  This restaurant definitely needs to improve their service.  The service my be better in the evening so we may give it a try again."}
{"text":"We went for lunch and it was a good experience. The atmosphere is classy and trendy - good for a nice dinner for business, anniversary etc. It was father's day so there were kids but normally I would avoid this with little kids since it's a nicer restaurant. The food was good - I am not saying it's the best Indian food ever - but it's solid and I would go back. They had lots of good options, including vegetarian. The prices were quite reasonable for such a nice place."}
{"text":"We got an online coupon to Curry N Kabob shortly after it opened and we were waiting for a good chance to go. We were a bit turned off by some of the reviews on here, but I have to say that we were pleasantly surprised with the meal we had.  The Curry N Kabob House is located in a little strip mall in Cornelius. The outside definitely looks tacky, but the inside is much nicer. Some of the tables are a bit close together, and when we were sat we were literally less than a foot away from the neighboring table, making it impossible to not overhear each other's conversations.   The waitstaff is a bit confusing, as it's a free-for-all in that all the servers seem to help all the tables, rather than individual servers being assigned to particular tables. So it was slightly annoying when three different servers came over to take our order when we had already given it to the first one. On the plus side, there was always someone around so if we needed anything getting someone's attention would not have been an issue at all.  Their wine selection was pretty good, and more importantly, cheap. We each got a glass for $6 and it was solid wine...definitely worth the price but didn't taste cheap. After the wine one of the servers came over with the complimentary chip thingys (I forget what it's called) served with the mint sauce. These were pretty good and I actually liked them more than I do at some other places.  We ordered some Garlic Naan ($3) to come out with our dinner. The naan was delicious, and definitely blew away the other naan we've had in the area. It was cooked perfectly and had a great garlic taste. This is a must-order with your meal, and it's good by itself or dipped in whatever sauce your meal has. For my entree I went with the Lamb Roganjosh ($18) and was very happy with it. The lamb was extremely tender and had a wonderful lamb taste to it...I've been to other Indian places where you couldn't tell you were eating lamb and had to trust the cook's word. They didn't ask us what spice level we wanted, and mine ended up being somewhere in the medium, which was perfect...not too hot where I couldn't eat it but enough heat to bring a run to my nose. It just hit that sweet spot.  The missus ordered the waitresses vegetarian suggestion, which was the Vegetable Jalfarezi ($12). It consisted of a mixture of cooked vegetables, but they were prepared with some thought. It wasn't just a bowl of mixed veggies...it had a great overall flavor to it.   In the end, Curry N Kabob is a great Indian inclusion to the Lake Norman area. While Sangam is still our go-to, Curry N Kabob is a close second, and I look forward to returning for another great meal."}
