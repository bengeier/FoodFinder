{"text":"I LOVE GERMAN FOOD!  That being the case, I'm in love with Kleiner Deutschmann!  This marvelous restaurant is in a converted pink house that will remind you of going to grandmas.  The food here is awesome and the atmosphere also is great.  It is the very best German food restaraunt anywhere near Pittsburgh.  When you go, ask them what you need to order to get them to ring the bells.  Lederhosen is optional."}
{"text":"I Ate here 20 yrs ago it was the best German foods ever ! Wish they open more in Area! Will be missed!"}
{"text":"This place did have the Best German Food around but they are no longer open sadly."}
{"text":"We miss you tremendously.     Not a current German restaurant in Pittsburgh worth our time or money."}
{"text":"Ach!  Say it isn't so.....I am devastated that Kleiner Deutschman is has said auf wiedersehen. So many wonderful memories of German foods, friends and family began there.  It will always hold a special place in my heart along with other lamented losses...the Gazebo, Klein's, Poli's, Weinsteins....sigh...I hope deceased restaurants go to heaven and I get to enjoy again. Hmmm, I suppose I'm making a pretty big assumption of where I'm going! RIP Kleiner Deutschman, RIP."}
