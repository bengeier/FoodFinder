{"text":"We went last night.  The owner is lovely, friendly.  Excellent service and great Thai food!  Very pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Awful! 
One employee working in the restaurant therefore a wait - which in itself is okay.  I ordered summer rolls and orange chicken.  The employee said oh I haven't prepared any chicken today would you like beef.  No - chicken.  This was a carryout order so I didn't take a look before leaving.  Once home, the chicken was breaded and in a container by itself.  Another container had a thin liquid with a few pieces of broccoli and a couple of carrots.  The 'sauce' was fairly tasteless.  Not what I expected.  The summer rolls order was two rice paper rolls with a little salad inside.  Overall this was one of the worst meals I have ever eaten.  Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Just went to this small restaurant for the first time today, It will certainly not be my last visit, I may adjust star rating after further trips. The food was excellent as was the portion size. Very attentive staff. A large selection of Asian beers with more to follow I am told.
Pricing was fair. If you like Asian food and curry you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Finally great Thai food in Arizona! And in Cave Creek to boot!
Best chicken Pad Thai  I ever had.
Priced right as well.
We will be back very soon."}
{"text":"Drove by this place for years.  What a mistake!  Excellent Thai cuisine, freshly prepared.  Green curry has plenty of veggies in addition to added meat. Drunken noodle is a pleasant change from Pad Thai.  Fresh rolls are generous with not too sweet peanut sauce.  Beer selection is very eclectic and housed in a glass door fridge. Walk on up and find beers from China, Thailand, Vietnam and Japan. Service is very friendly and prompt.  It's a small place with some of best curries that I've had when compared to LA and DC. I don't know the back story as to why this gem is in Cave Creek but I'm glad it is."}
{"text":"What an amazing find! Great food with a wonderful owner. If you're in the area, it's a must stop. We got the drunken noodles and the ginger beef, both great dishes. If you're near Cave Creek, it's worth the time to stop."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place! Awesome food and service. Z is a great hostess. She makes you feel right at home. I wish I found this place sooner. We will defiantly be back for more yummy Thai food."}
{"text":"This was the best food we had when we were on our trip. We had delicious calamari and edamame and then we had amazingly good fried rice and then I had really good panang curry.    Everything was amazing!"}
{"text":"Great dinner and service- basil fried rice, chicken red curry, mango sticky rice dessert all amazing- highly recommend! Best spot in cave creek!"}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING! Food was exceptional, service was excellent, prices were great. My wife and I love great Thai food, and this is our new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"This is the best Thai restaurant in the area. We went back three times during our two-day stay in Carefree. Our favorite food here is Kau-Kling. This is off the menu but you can request if you like herbal flavored southern style Thai food. You cannot find this menu anywhere else. Also, we ordered Chu-chee and massaman which are fantastic. I would recommend tempura shrimp, chicken basil, and tomyum too. We tried some dessert like purple sticky rice with rambutan, sticky rice with mangoes, and banana fired with coconut&pine Apple ice cream. They're all good."}
{"text":"Z is an amazing chef and owner! My husband and I love Thai food and I was in heaven as soon as I looked at the menu! We  over ordered thinking we would have leftovers and almost licked our plates clean!  Pad Thai, drunken noodles, panang, chicken satay, and coconut shrimp all delicious! Exceptional service, food, price and atmosphere!!!"}
{"text":"Really good and caring staff and service by Z herself. Food was delicious and flavorful. We also arrived in time for happy hour priced appetizers. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a flavorful bowl of Tom Ka soup with seafood (shrimp only $3 more!) with a nice glass of wine.  They get busy on Friday and Saturday nights so reservations might be in order.  The menu is out of this world!  Order the Thai Ice Tea, crab puffs, fresh summer rolls and Pad Thai.  Ask for the owner Zilia if you have any questions, concerns, special needs, or feedback.  She will come out of the kitchen and make you feel like family!

{"text":"I live in Cave Creek,  and I don't know where these 4 and 5 star reviews have eaten, but definitely not at Z's Asian Fusion in Cave Creek!  I agree the owner, Z, is very knowledgeable, but when you see two tables occupied in a restaurant on Friday night and a menu 4 legal pages long...that says GO FOR THE DOOR!  That's fine if you are Denny's or a franchise, but this place presents itself as a locally owned fresh food establishment....everything we ordered tasted processed or frozen!  My husband and I ordered the calamari and the crab puffs...the calamari was tough and tasted processed and the crab puffs had no crab...just sour cream and were soggy!  Our entrees were served as soup with the protein not even remotely tasting like chicken and pork, and vegetables that I could not identify all mixed into a lack luster broth with cold rice on the side!

NEVER AGAIN!!!

{"text":"Love this place.  It's moved to the top of our rotation.  We ordered appetizers, including the incredible pot stickers, and a few entrees. The Choo Chee Talapia plate was fantastic and the service was very personal and quick.  Quaint. Delicious.  Excellent. Authentic Thai."}
{"text":"Been awhile since we been out this way...in Sweet CC...yelped and this cool place caught r I .... :-) Absolutely wonderful.   !!!!!!. Very Happy Happy ..Highly Recommended.... I want more..lol Gotta get something 2 go....!!!! :-)"}
{"text":"I really wanted this place to be great! unfortunately it's not. The lunch (Thai chicken salad) was very expensive and looked like an appetizer. The chicken was hard and overcooked,vegetables had a very strong taste and the special spicy sauce almost knocked me to the floor! Way To Spicy!!! Service was so so. Looks like they are running it more like a dream then a restaurant business."}
{"text":"Just had an outstanding lunch at Z Asian fusion what an unexpected surprise to find great Asian food in cowboy town. Ask Z for her recommendations she will make you exactly what you are looking for."}
{"text":"What a fantastic find in Cave Creek!  I tried the green curry with tofu and the crab puffs for lunch; fresh, rich, delicious, and just the right amount of spice.  Very friendly service, too.  Will definitely be back again (and again!)"}
{"text":"Plenty to chose from on their menu. Penang curry chicken is excellent. Very flavorful. Good selection of SE Asian beers, too. Very attentive service. A pleasant surprise in Cave Creek!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem. Food surpassed expectations. Appreciated the explanation of all of the options and their willingness (and suggestions) of how to customize your order.  

Crab puff appetizer with the chili homemade sauce was relish and husband says panang curry was the best curry he'd ever had.  

We live 40 miles from here but will definitely make a trip back to eat here!"}
{"text":"Went there last night and had the Chicken Adobo, one word - EXCELLENT!  I met Z (the owner) who is very nice and obviously talented.  Staff and service was great.  We WILL BE BACK!"}
{"text":"Sorry! I like to be positive, but my first experience here was my last. It started with the food spotted homemade menus with incorrect information. Then they were out of several of the beers listed. The waiter was uninformed and could offer no recommendations. The hostess/owner was inattentive. When it finally arrived the food was mediocre at best. To cap it off the bill took forever to arrive and they almost gave us a credit card from another table. Couldn't leave fast enough."}
{"text":"Yay! I've been waiting years for someone/something like this to come to Cave Creek/Carefree! Zelia's an absolute doll, outstanding service & the food - nothing short of exceptional. I love everything I've ordered so far, can't wait to finish my dinner & try something new next time. Thank you Z & welcome to our little part of the world. I wish you much, much success!"}
{"text":"Really amazing Thai food! We have been here three times in one week and everything we have tried is delicious. The red curry and Tom Kah soup are amazing."}
{"text":"First time back in a month....  Can't believe I've waited that long!!!  Potstickers, crab puffs, Kung pow chicken!!!!  Delicious!!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food!!! I had the drunken noodles they were outstanding!!!  A must stop for Thai food."}
{"text":"Great experience and well worth the drive from Phoenix.  Went with wife and 3 kids and everyone enjoyed their meal.  Well definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have been to Z Fusion on several occasions and it has never failed to please us.  In particular, love the crab puff and chicken satay appetizers and the fantastic Choo Chee Crispy Tilapia.  We must have been in the restaurant the night Cave Creeker, Brett F was there as I believe he was the obnoxious fella at the bar awaiting his takeout order.  He had the audacity to come to our table and bad mouth this establishment while we were eating our meal.  We had overheard there was something amiss with his order, but Z, the owner, went out of her way to try to make this customer satisfied.  Z is hospitable and does whatever she can to make sure your experience at her restaurant is the best.  She's passionate about her food and pleasing her customers.  We witnessed this \"jerk\" given two complimentary scotch drinks to try to help compensate him for the problem experienced with his order and ease the situation.  But there was no pleasing him.  Z handled the situation as a professional staying focused on attempting to resolve the problem, but this obnoxious individual was never going to be happy.  In fact, he wanted MORE scotch to appease him .... \"complimentary\" of course.  We feel fortunate to have this wonderful Thai-inspired restaurant in our neighborhood and the warmth and hospitality of Z will have us coming back time and time again.  If one just looks over the \"reviews\" for Z Fusion on Yelp, Brett F is the ONLY negative review written.  That says it all ... there was no pleasing him that evening ... no way ... no how!!!!  Back just this week for the delicious fried rice and egg drop soup ... Yum!!"}
{"text":"Surprising find in a small town.  Really good food and great service.  The owner, Z, was our server and spent time chatting with us and had good recommendations for our meal.  We had the beef noodle soup for the kids and panang pork curry and crab fried rice.  It was all very flavorful.  Didn't have room for dessert but the lychee ice cream sounded tasty.  Would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"We are on very restricted diets so it is difficult to have meals cooked our way. It is actually a bit embarrassing to go out to eat  and then have to dictate  to the waiter what and how to cook the meal.My wife is almost always unhappy with the way it comes out. This place bent bent over backwards to assure that things were as we asked and seemed happy to do it. They  may have even\" bent over forward \"because of the extra time and effort they extended to us without extra expense to us. The food was fresh, not greasy and cooked flawlessly. My wife was pleased which says it all. We are going back often. Mark"}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food I have ever had.  I watch the chef in the kitchen cut fresh veggies to prepare their dishes.  Nothing old or canned.
The owner/chef is so friendly and a master at her trade.
I am craving this food weekly.  Cute little establishment with made to order dishes and a nice bar.  Will always recommend this place.  Oh and happy hours is great !!!!"}
{"text":"Thought I wrote a review before but maybe not.  Food very good. Drinks weak.  Tasty food but the prices are higher than you would expect  well, than what I expected   I'm not sure What you consider excessive.   But I just wouldn't go back because of price   Cave Creek is not where you think for oriental food, but we do have some other less expensive options in the area   I hope they read these reviews, because I see the running thread is price"}
{"text":"Holy cow, grew up in San Jose, CA and have been searching for good Vietnamese and Thai food since I left. Still looking for Vietnamese, but my search for Thai is over. 

Zach was our server, nice guy and made some killer recommendations. We sat on the patio and happened to go during happy hour (prices are amazing during happy hour!!), and when we went again we sat on the patio during regular menu prices (still not bad). 

Portions are good sized, staff very willing to customize orders as far as they can be, service was pretty quick, beer was served in a cool but not frigid glass as it should be, and most importantly the food was so tasty I was tempted to order another entree for lunch the next day.

Will definitely be returning for a third visit and can easily see this place being a regular for us. Compared to the other Thai I've had in the Valley this place is far and away the best I've tasted. 

Together my wife and I have tried the curry, two separate dishes with chicken (both delicious and moist), shrimp rolls. All delicious."}
{"text":"Z and her crew went above and beyond to accommodate our gluten-free and vegan dietary needs. The fried rice was some of the best I've ever had and the Pad Thai was exceptional. I cannot recommend this little Cave Creek treasure enough."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place because my family insisted that I dine here while in town. 

When we first arrived (at 6:15 p.m.) we had to wait to be seated for about 5 minutes, even though there were only two tables of two in the restaurant. The woman at the register thought we were waiting for carry out and continued to ring up an order. She seemed really confused and had to ask a young (I assume teenager) girl to assist her with ringing up her ticket.

The woman sat us, and although she was very nice, she seemed - again - confused. She said she would bring us water --it never came. When she came back to get our drink and food order, we asked for water. 20 minutes later our drinks arrived, but: no water. She struggled with our drink order, as we watched her try to decipher the wine we ordered behind the bar. She kept consulting the menu to ensure she was bringing the correct wine. There were maybe 5-8 white wine selections on the menu.

After 40 minutes, our appetizer (crispy calamari) still wasn't out. The young blonde waitress was not our waitress, but she accidentally brought the wrong food to our table; the food belonged to the table next to us. A man with glasses yelled at her...loud enough that the entire restaurant could hear. Immediately following that, the asian woman cooking the food yelled at her (again, loud enough that we could all hear). Not her fault! Especially considering that she was serving a table she wasn't assigned to, and was literally the ONLY person serving tables. The poor girl was running around like a chicken with her head cut off while the man with the glasses and the older dark lady who sat us were just kind of meandering around, doing nothing, as far as I could tell.

The older dark lady (sorry, no better description) never came to ask us if we wanted a refill, to ask if we needed anything or to apologize for the delay. Meanwhile, the young blonde girl (whom wasn't our waitress) brought our appetizer after an hour wait. She was sweet and kind, even in the midst of being crucified by the people above her.

The older dark lady comes back to our table and says she'll come back to take our order, except: she already took our order. They were also out of the wine that my aunt ordered (not her fault), but she brought something comparable that my aunt was OK with.

The food was OK. I've had way better. Nothing special to report here, nothing awful (in terms of food) to report here.

I will say, however, that I'm appalled by how these two people treated the waitress. She was the ONLY one actually working. And clearly, she was picking up the slack for the others that weren't performing. The other woman couldn't even ring up an order without her. I hate to see people treated like that, and further, humiliated in front of others/customers...especially considering that they're doing the job of many others because of the others' lack of abilities. I mean, really, c'mon. Maybe if the other employees would step up, this would be a non-issue.

To the people running the place: you should be grateful that you have someone that works so hard to please your customers. I'm not even sure why she's working for people that - clearly - don't appreciate her. Our experience would have been FAR LESS pleasant if it wasn't for her."}
{"text":"!!Phenomenal food!!
A small restaurant with great food, great prices and great service- parking area is small"}
{"text":"Delicous!  Loved the Pad Thai and the curried chicken was terrific.  This place is a hidden treasure.  We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Came here because of all the  positive Yelp reviews. Their website is not complete so there is no menu or directions posted. Called the restaraunt and confirmed there was no menu on website. Thank goodness Yelp does a great job of mapping the location. This is a cute little restaurant and the owner is friendly.  However this is not even close to the best Thai food ever.  Tried to order the crunchy spinach salad from menu but it was not available. We had pot stickers for an appetizer ($6); pad thai ($14) which is a staple in Thai cusine; a lime avocado salad ($14) and their signature Mossaman Beef curry ($16).  Dishes were not very generous servings and were not at all spicy. We were not asked what we wanted to drink so we stuck with water. We were not asked if we wanted the food spicier so we assume that is not an option since the owner took our order. Potstickers were good and six on the plate. Pad Thai with chicken was good but not great. Lime avacado salad was disappointing and small serving. Mossaman Beef was good but not great.  The beef had been cooked too long to the point of disintegration at touch and that resulted in the curry being more like gravy than curry. Tried to order dessert from menu but it was not available. We've been to Thailand several times; love the food; and seek to satisfy our thai food fix once a month or so but we don't see any compelling reason to come here again. Wanted to be wowed because of the reviews and maybe that is the problem. Their food just did not live up to the hype and I seriously don't understand the ratings. Bottom line - good but not great and expensive for what you get. Would be happy to pay the price if the food was superb. They are friendly and that may be getting them better reviews. Friendliness does matters but food matters too. 5 star...no way. There are other Thai restaraunts within 15 to 20 minutes that are better or just as good. And all with a lower price tag. For the above dishes the bill was $52, after tip $62."}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I went here last night (again) and knew I wanted to give Zs some cyber love!Our friend recommended it, and whew are we glad he did! We have been back 5 times, and always trying something new. Really great. Also love the stamp card, we get a free meal next time we go in! Try the sangria can't beat it for $9!"}
{"text":"I just had one of the best meals of my life. Choo Chee Crispy Tilapia at Z's. The friendly and personal service has always been exceptional. It's the only restaurant we go to where we actually are among friends/staff. I tried the tilapia tonight and could only wonder how I missed it on the menu after all this time. Perfectly cooked fish, perfectly fried eggplant, perfectly seasoned curry sauce. Perfect perfect perfect."}
{"text":"Wow!! First time here and really did not know what to expect.  I knew it was Thai but they had a variety of Asian style dishes.  I had the red curry shrimp Thai hot and it was excellant.

We got pot stickers for an appetizer and we all thought they were the best we had ever had. 

My wife's dish and Girlkyle's dish was most excellant.  Forget Pei Wei, highly recommend and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wow is not enough. This is a hidden gem in the town of cave creek, hidden in a small shopping plaza and I recommend you make it a point to get here. Authentic Thai, China and Indian cuisine cooked to perfection. We ordered the Moo Bing, Shrimp Wraps, cucumber salad, beef noodle soup, spicy chicken soup and the Tilapia-heaven. Frankly, I am sad that I live down the road and have passed on this place...I have truly missed out and plan on playing catch up :-)"}
{"text":"Great little place with amazing food and a very congenial owner/hostess.  Unassuming location in a little strip mall just past all the old west places (if you're heading east anyway).  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Z's is always a tasty Asian fusion. I hadn't been there in a while and returning was a good idea. Unfortunately Z wasn't in but Denis took good care of me at the bar:  had the lunch special , orange beef , house salad with a delicious home made dressing , soy and ginger based I think , doesn't matter as it was all really good . Thumbs up Z ... Catch you next time."}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for this new little spot in Cave Creek. It's menu was ambitious with offerings from almost every Asian cuisine, including India.

It was a beautiful evening t dine on the patio, but alas, they had mostly high top tables out there which in my book book does not qualify for a nice, relaxing dining experience. There was one table, and it appeared that the owners or employees were dining or taking a break there. So we sat inside at a four-top tucked in the back of the restaurant.

A server can make all the difference in a restaurant experience. The woman who worked our table had absolutely no personality whatsoever, and she barely spoke English.  At first I was not sure this was the case, and perhaps she was just having a bad night, but when my entree came and it was full of bell peppers (a no-no for me), I am sure she didn't understand what I ordered. My husband asked me, \"why did you order something with bell peppers in it and not ask them to omit them?\" I thought, \"well, it had some veggies in it that were specifically listed, but it did not include the bell peppers in it.\" I sent it back for them to remake it without the bell peppers. As I was eating it, I thought to myself, this does not taste like what I ordered . . . Having just sent the entree back, I didn't want to put up a fuss . . . I just wanted to leave. My husband was still working on his Indian dish that was at least \"3 peppers\" hotter than the \"one pepper\" listed on the menu . . . he, too, wanted to leave.  On the way out I picked up a to-go menu and when I actually looked at it, after we got home, I felt so much better that I wasn't going crazy . . . indeed, what they served me and what I received wasn't even close to anything listed on the menu, and certainly a far cry from what I ordered.

The prices are also way too hefty for what they serve, and even the manager/owner who was lurking around the bar didn't even both to thank us for our patronage on the way out!  There is no way we will go back to Z's . . . a total bust!"}
{"text":"I ordered drunken noodle with Chicken, summer roll and the Tom Kha Guy soup with shrimp.

Undoubtedly one of the best drunken noodles i have had. This dish had red cabbage mixed with the noodles. Honestly, I would not have thought that cabbage would taste good with this dish but they proved me wrong. 

Summer roll was pretty good and the soup was unbelievably good as well."}
{"text":"it is hard to find good help... My husband and I have been going here for over a year... we are both in the food service industry, he's a chef & owner to a local Burger Joint and I am a server... Z has ran into a problem finding reliable staff... we know this is difficult because my husband and I have BOTH been on both sides of this coin and well... simply... it sucks... Z's might not be able to find reliable staff... but she sure NEVER has a problem with her food... Z sources some of the most flavorful starts to all her dishes... sometimes she sources straight from her own garden... This action  is one of Love... please know that you might run into an issue with 'service'... however don't be afraid to ASK for more water rather than complaining about not getting it... I would hate to see this place go out of business, the food is sublime and Z is one heck of a gal... keep it up mama... you will come out on top... so in closing... head over to Z's and enjoy a wonderful meal at a calm, loving pace... and ENJOY THE LOVE"}
{"text":"My sister and I were looking for Thai food in Cave Creek and were happy to see Z's Asian Fusion. We have a very wonderful lunch special. We had Egg Drop Soup / Crab Wonton /  Pad Thai and Orange Chicken and Iced Tea. We like spicy and were able to have complete control by adding their wonderful sauces to our dishes. Everything was great and we look forward to bringing the rest of the family soon. Also look forward to Happy Hour Specials they sounded really great. See you soon!"}
{"text":"I love Z's!  I've been going to Z's for the past few years and I always seem to get the massaman curry as my main entree because it is just so good! Recently I tried the yellow curry and wow! It was also delicious. Both dishes have enough spice to make your taste buds dance but they are not too spicy where you can't enjoy the flavors. The veggies in both dishes are cooked crisp tender and when served over rice they make a completely satisfying meal. 

As far a appetizers I've tried the crab rangoon which Z makes fresh and you can really taste the difference. The potstickers and spring rolls are also great choices! 

Z's is excellent to dine-in or carry out. There is adequate parking and service is prompt, courteous, and friendly.  This is by far one of my favorite restaurants in the area!"}
{"text":"Lots of choices on the menu. I ordered the summer rolls, clay shrimp pot and Thai tea. My husband ordered chicken fried rice and everything was delicious. Great flavor development in the clay pot. The owner shared that this was a family recipe. The owner came out and met the customers. Great customer service, knowledgable waiter. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Flavor flavor and flavor.   So yummy!!!!!!  So happy they have reopened in a new location.  Yummy!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have lived in the Cave Creek area for nearly 10 years and our biggest complaint is that there are so few good local (non-chain) restaurants, especially for dinner. We stumbled upon Z's while driving thru town recently (not sure how we missed it the past couple years!) and came to check it out tonight. Everything we ordered was somewhere between very good and fantastic (our favorites of the things we tried were the potstickers and panang curry) and the service was outstanding (the owner herself stopped by our table to chat and then made a special \"kid friendly\" fried rice meal for our 5 year old). We were glad to discover they do take out, too. We have finally found a local place we'll return to over and over!"}
{"text":"Great food. The owner recommends the dishes based on what you like making the dining experience personal and special. I can't wait to go back and try more amazing things."}
{"text":"Synopsis: We tried Z's recently, and wound up walking out and driving down to the Desert Ridge area, where we should have gone in the first place. 

We tried Z's on a whim, because we saw the good reviews. Seating was quick (there was only one other table, and they were mid meal). 
Water was brought (eventually...5-10 minutes later) by a tow-headed boy about 14 years old, with the creepiest awkward grin I've ever seen on a person. (Sorry, dude) ...and we were left to sit.
10 minutes later, someone came to take our appetizer order, then zoomed off to the kitchen without even asking if we were ready to order our entree, too (we were, since we'd been there 15-20 minutes, and we'd each settled on something in the first 5...). 
10 minutes later, a party of 4 came in and took the table behind us - and \"Z\" came over to chat with them...while our waters were very empty, we still waited for our appetizer to come out, and we waited for someone to take our order.
When the appetizer came out, there were 4 pieces, when the menu said 6. 

This was when we got up, told them why we were leaving, then left. 
We were there about 45 minutes, and were served 1 glass of water (mostly ice), and 2/3 of the (overpriced) appetizer we ordered. 
I don't think I've *ever* had such terrible service. Ever. 

I wouldn't recommend it, unless you know \"Z\" personally - the table behind us (all old \"republican-y\" looking folks in their 60s) got absolutely *fabulous* service, while we (in our 40s) sat right next to them, completely ignored."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a real gem. We tried the authentic Thai-Malaysian dishes served with personal attention by owner Z. We started with crab bites which were wonderful. I had the red curry and my wife had the yellow curry, both with chicken. My red curry was so creamy and just hot enough. Chocked full of a variety of vegetables served with rice. Delicious! My wife had one of the best yellow curries she has ever eaten. The restaurant is squeaky clean and in a convenient location in town. We will be back to try their Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are locals in the Cave Creek area- and we finally got a chance to try this restaurant last week.  We were super excited to find a great Asian restaurant in the area.  

I got the Pad Thai with tofu and they kindly customized it for me without fish sauce because I am vegetarian.  The portion was large and it was delicious.  

We spit the veggie spring rolls to start and they were very yummy, crispy, hot and flavorful. 

My husband got the Drunken Noodles and he loved those too- just wished they were a little more spicy.  

Service was warm and friendly and the owner came by to say hello to us and ask how we were enjoying our meal.

We will be back."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite restaurant! Every dish we ordered was so unique and delicious that I thought I was in Thailand! The hostess was busy but made sure our wine and cucumber water glasses were always filled. I'll definitely be coming back to Z's!!"}
{"text":"we were on business in carefree and found it on yelp. it was the last day before the restaurant closed for 2 months because they were moving to a new place.
the owner -a very charming and attentive lady- had prepared a delicious all you can eat buffet using all her remaining food supplies.
it was delicious and diverse. high end ingredients prepared with skill and passion.
of course we ate more than we usually do. it was so irresistible !
we will make a point to dine there again on one of our next business trip as soon as they are open."}
{"text":"It doesn't get any better than this!  Hands down the best Thai food I've ever had, and It was ordered as a \"to go\". I cannot say enough about the quality of Z's food."}
{"text":"OMG ! I just had the best Soft Shell Crab I have ever tasted ! I ordered one of the daily specials at Z's Asian Fusion. Soft Shell Crab with Spicy Ginger Curry. All of the asian flavors blending together along with the crab tasted AMAZING ! If you are ever in Cave Creek, you have got to check it out."}
{"text":"Food wasn't bad and wasn't great. Service was terrible. The waitress could have cared less about our table. She was so rude. I am so irritated that I am writing this true review from a table in the restaurant. I won't ever come back."}
{"text":"Long waits for food. Expensive and often  lack beverages listed on their menu. I no longer eat  here."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness the food is fantastic, so fresh and perfectly portioned. An elegant place, so when we showed up with toddlers we were a little nervous but the staff was so awesome helping us to even entertain the kids with kitchen tours. This is the third place in this location since I've been in cave creek. I an so happy they are here because with how good the food is they will be here for the long haul"}
{"text":"Read raving reviews about Z's, figured this would be a place to stop in cave creek. Boy was I wrong. Food took forever to come out, which is usually ok when you're waiting for something delicious, but this was just plain bad. Ordered the Drunken Noodles because of the high remarks: wish I had been drunk while eating it... noodles had the consistently of rubber, chicken was WAY over cooked. Friend of mine had the black pepper entree with shrimp, the shrimp was practically burnt. I didn't think it was difficult to over cook shrimp but apparently it is. Very disappointed overall after reading such great reviews :("}
{"text":"Love this place!  I highly recommend it. Great service!  Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Best Thai food ever! So nice and clean, great service. Food was so fresh and full of flavor. Been to many places but this was so good. I will be recommending this to many people"}
{"text":"Amazing Thai food restaurant! The owner was very gracious and open to variations depending on diet. Great food, fresh and perfectly seasoned."}
{"text":"Best margarita I've ever had!  Thai basil and lots of other good stuff in it.  I'm counting it as a health food!!  Everything we had was excellent and everyone else in the restaurant was raving about what they had.  Not the prettiest place, but a definite gem!!!"}
{"text":"Great Far Eastern menu, large portion sizes, and very tasty.  Servers were attentive, cordial, and accomodating.  The ambiance lends to private and quiet conversation.  I would recommend this restaurant and plan on visiting it regularly."}
{"text":"If I could give this place and extra star, I would!  My daughter and I thought we would give this place a try.  WOW!  I heard the crab puffs were great, and they were!  We arrived in time for happy hour and in addition to the crab puffs, we added on the pot stickers!  They were fantastic!  We ordered the Massaman Curry as a main dish.  It was perfect.  I had tried to introduce my daughter to Massaman Curry at another Thai place and it was OK, very watered down and kinda flat.  Now she knows what it is supposed to taste like because Z's got it dead on!  

The owner was very welcoming and sweet, you can tell she really cares about the quality and ingredients of her dishes.  

I am going back Friday for that amazing happy hour!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Thank you for great food right around the corner from my house!  This place will be dangerous for take out! So many things to try!"}
{"text":"They might be closed, each time we went there to eat there were no lights on"}
{"text":"Great place. Quaint, and very personal as the owner is often your server. You can tell she is passionate about her restaurant and cares about being a good host and wants you to enjoy your meal. 

Appetizers are great. Crab puffs are legit--not the normal overly cream cheese filled variety. Nice selection of seafood available.  I had Halibut with the Black Pepper sauce--unreal how much flavor there was. 

We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Really really good drunken noodles one of the best Asian places I've been in a while. Very good service and a very comfortable vibe. Great chef too!"}
{"text":"Very casual atmosphere but food is excellent. One of my favorite Thai restaurants. Great service."}
{"text":"My fiancé, son and I love this place! We live in Cave Creek, and this is the first restaurant in the area where we have really been wow'd by the food. We have been there a few times at this point and have had, (or at least sampled from each other), the Thai Fried Rice, Drunken Noodles, Pad See Ew, Panang Curry, Pepper Beef, Thom Yum Soup, and Vegetable Tempura. I have ordered my dishes with tofu, while my fiancé has ordered with chicken. (My son ordered the beef dish). Everything has been so delicious, and we will continue to try more dishes. The food has a perfect balance is contrasting flavors and heat. The service is prompt and attentive, and the owner/ chef comes to the table as well which is appreciated, as it is always nice to meet the owners of small businesses. Also, wanted to mention that the water is infused with citrus and cucumber which is a nice touch! Price is reasonable and we always have leftovers! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Amazing Asian fusion gem!! Z's recipes are from her grandmother. Everything is super fresh and is some of the best Thai I've had! The Tom Kah soup is the best you'll find- the leaves and roots are blended so there's nothing to pick out. And all of the coconut milk dishes and curries are so rich and flavorful! All the spice blends are ground by Z's. Everything we ordered was fabulous and we'll be back, many more times!"}
{"text":"Z's was absolutely fantastic! Probably the best Pad Thai my wife and I have ever had. Josh was an awesome waiter, the prices were beyond reasonable and the food was VERY, VERY GOOD...especially in an area with a lot of good food choices. I highly recommend this place, it's fantastic"}
{"text":"Great food great service food was the best.  We went for lunch and was so surprised at what a great taste everything had. Portions are large and very good. Not a lot of Good Asian restaurants in AZ this is our favorite."}
{"text":"Great food, so fresh and interesting taste profiles. Z's is so nice and accomodating. Everyone should try this place. She will not disappoint."}
{"text":"I can't believe I have driven by this place everyday and not stopped until tonight!  Moving here from Hawaii, I've had my fill of Asian food. This food was fantastic!  Great happy hour prices on lots of apps, 2 for 1 drinks. Main course full of flavor, perfect portions. Service was amazing. Will definitely be coming back often!"}
{"text":"Service good but food quality poor.   Wanted to like the place but just couldn't.   Most dishes are Thai.  The potstickers  clearly were frozen Machine made from some far off land.  The kind that come in a bag of 50 that you can buy a Chinese supermarket $9.99.  The 6 dumpings for $6 were boiled and not fried on 1 side as a true pot sticker should be.  In other words,  there wasn't a crispy side just soggy.  The pork in the noodle dish was stale and the noodles were soggy.   I suspect that the people who rated (or cooked at) this restaurant have never tried authentic Thai food."}
{"text":"What a splendid find. Having come from the Asia Pacific region I have always been on the lookout for good Asian here in the Phoenix area. This has been a frustrating search until now. 

The service was just right. Polite and appeared just when you needed something.  The premises are very clean

We were ushered to our table and immediately served cool cucumber water.   This was so refreshing and set the tone for the rest of the meal
 
We started the meal with the fresh summer rolls served with a sweet plum sauce. The sauce is slightly sweet without overpowering the roll 
 
Massaman curry was good    The flavours were rich with the spices adding the right note

The pad Thai with chicken was yummy

I will go back again"}
{"text":"How did we miss this place?   My wife and I live in Mirabel and enjoy dining at a ton of places in the CaveCreek and Carefree area.  This was a total sleeper and we loved it.  The outside lighting made it almost look closed...but, we thought we would peek inside.  A WINNER!!! Great food. Great service. Great night."}
{"text":"With great recommendations we went to Z's with a couple friends to see what it was all about. The host was very nice and the restaurant itself was clean and had a nice atmosphere.
Starting with the Pot Stickers. They came out cold and didn't have the best flavor. We ordered the Tom Kha chicken soup and was very average, spices were good but nothing special.
For the main course we ordered the Panang Curry (Chicken). The choice of rice was a brown rice which competed with the curry and threw it off. The Chicken was a bit gamey and the curry was very average.
For a summary I would say the service was good but the food was at best average and definitely way over priced for what it was.
Thai food is my absolute favorite food but this place just missed the mark."}
{"text":"Very cool place.  
The crab puffs were obviously made in-house. Crispy on the outside but moist and delicious inside.  I have never had smoother cream cheese or better all-around flavor in a Rangoon type appetizer.
The Thai basil with pork was sublime.  I have visited Thailand several times and Z's provides that authentic, deep explosion of subtle and aggressive flavors from the Far East. The pork was tender and plentiful, and mixed perfectly with the veggies, spices and sauce.
Very impressive!"}
{"text":"Clean place owner is very friendly. Unfortunately we were not impressed with the food. Food lacked Depth, spices, and flavor. Food was just OK I will give the food 2 stars the owner and the environment 4 stars.  I wish I could rate the food at a higher level."}
{"text":"My newest favorite. The cooking is amazing!!  The specific al today of ribs in yellow curry was truly amazing. Such subtle flavors. 
We will be back with guests."}
{"text":"The question to ask is what is not good......nothing!  Love Z's, everything is delicious!  Great service!  Amazing Food!  Friendly atmosphere!  5 stars!"}
{"text":"A jewel of a restaurant in Cave Creek! I love good, fresh Thai food and from the wonderful smells coming from the kitchen, to the charming Owner ensuring a great dining experience, I would absolutely rate Z's as good as it gets. I of course started with the Tom Yum soup; my standard test to see what \"spicy\" means, and I was not disappointed. Hot, flavorful and a delicious burn, this soup, by itself, will keep me coming back. The crab fried rice and the Pad Thai were the perfect accompaniment to the Mussaman curry..a dish from the \"favorites\" section of the menu. The meat was layered with a rich curry flavor and the potatoes were perfect in their tenderness. Zilia explained to us that this section of the menu were all her grandmother's recipes and I will absolutely be back to try every one of them!"}
{"text":"One of our new favorite places to eat. I can't have enough of the Fried Crab Rice, and the orange chicken has a great light batter and our little one's favorite. Great friendly service too!"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to give this place a try and fell in love with the food. The food is fresh and has authentic flavors. The curries are outstanding, the best I think I have ever had, if you like Asian cuisine you are going to love this place."}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for a place for lunch in Cave Creek today.  We drove right past it because, honest to god, we thought it was a furniture store!
Another Yelper said this is Cave Creek's best kept secret.  Now we know why."}
{"text":"Went 2 times on our visit, the first time was great but the second time the food was different. It almost seemed like they ran out of the items they had and substituted lesser ingredients. They were out of water glasses as well. Our visit was during the Phoenix Golf Open and I'm guessing they were busier than usual. All in all it was a decent experience."}
{"text":"Wow, this is some tasty food!!! I highly recommend. My wife and I have been here 3 times now and the food has been excellent every time. ;)"}
{"text":"We recently discovered this gem in Cave Creek. The food is delicious and reasonably priced. My husband loves to get take out from here. I would say we get something at least once or twice a month - which is a lot from us since we don't eat out very often!"}
{"text":"The Tom Kha soup is amazing. I actually can't wait to order it again. We also had crab puffs, pad thai, and the pork panang curry. Everything was so tasty! 
The owner, Z, is super friendly and adorable. 
Cute place inside. Cave creek is small, so the location is easy to find and pretty near everything. We came from just south of Carefree and it only took minutes to get there. 
Glad I found a new Thai place that I can get take-out from! We'll be back for sure and I'm looking forward to trying some other dishes."}
{"text":"Awesome little gem! Fabulous food & service.. Best Tom Yum ever. Gracious and warm greeting upon entry & cute outdoor patio for when it gets a little cooler. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"We are so glad they are open!  The food is high quality and tasty
I would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"What a delightful little restaurant. If you like Asian food with great flavor and made fresh to order, Then this is your destination. Z is great! She is the Chef/Owner very personable and really has a passion for what she creates. Wonderful environment lets help keep those small true chef owned establishment in business stop in and say Hi Z will welcome you with open arms."}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight with a group of six. Great variety on the menu, from a number of different Asian cuisines.

We had a number of appetizers/salads to share, and all were very good. Main courses were excellent as well, with the several curry dishes we ordered being really outstanding. I did get the sense that Thai was the specialty based on the exceptional quality of the items and their prevalence on the menu. Would definitely come again. You can also order family style for sharing. Fun place to bring a group or have a smaller dinner due to the variety of options.

Don't be deterred by the exterior... It could use a bit of work. The inside is much nicer. Smells delicious and tastefully decorated."}
{"text":"What a fabulous find! We are from Chicago, and have eaten Thai food many times. This was by far the best we've had. Everything was incredibly fresh and delicious. One of the best parts was the individual attention we received from the owner. A charming woman from Thailand, she guided us through the menu and tailor made our dishes to our tastes. The appetizers were traditional options, but so fresh they were elevated to another level. The main dishes were unusual and fabulous. I had beef with mint, my boyfriend had red curry with catfish, my friend had a vegan green curry and her husband had a tilapia Thai adobo. Everything was delicious, and she tailored the spiciness to request. Great cocktails too!"}
{"text":"Best. Vegan. Pad. Thai. Ever. The chef/owner/wonder woman was so friendly and accommodating to my vegan diet. The decor is really lovely and inviting. The location of the restaurant itself is within walking distance of a bunch of cute and funky western shops. I ordered the pad Thai with tofu and veggies sans fish sauce and eggs. The noodles were exploding with flavor and it's texture was chewy in a good way. The broccoli and other veggies tasted fresh and cooked perfectly- still had that crunch! Pan fried to perfection the tofu was insanely good- my only complaint is that there wasn't more. The portion looks small upon first inspection but I had trouble finishing it. 
I also got to treat myself to a Thai Iced Tea after making a coconut mylk adjustment. So yummy and not too sweet. 
The prices are very reasonable. Very excited to come back with friends and family!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to have our first wedding anniversary here.  We had the lunch combo that includes a starter and an entree.  My husband had the crab puffs with a fruit marmalade sauce and I had the egg drop soup.  We both loved our starters.  My husband said he's never had a crab puff like this.  The server also recommended the pot stickers.  We will be ordering that next time we come!  For our entrees, we shared beef drunken noodles and the yellow chicken curry in medium hot but you can also order this in mild and very hot.  We were pleasantly surprised by how flavorful both entrees were.  We love Thai food and this is now one of our favorite Thai restaurants.  What's great about the Asian Fusion concept is that there are different types of Asian cuisine e.g. Thai, Chinese, Japanese, Filipino etc which would satisfy the most finicky appetites including my family!"}
{"text":"Brilliant menu and sublime flavors all around.  Latest choice was Z's Malaysian pumpkin curry preparation.....just perfect!    Such a fabulous and eclectic crowd at Z's and the service is just like being at home.    Z's is an iconic fixture in the Creek."}
{"text":"The food was excellent, and the service terrific. We were here for lunch with out-of-town friends who had lived in Thailand for a few years and who vouched wholeheartedly for the food (though the menu is not strictly Thai food). Everything we ordered was good, with the Tom Kha soup being a standout, and the calamari featuring a light and tasty tempura coating. Zilia, whom I believe is the owner, came here following the 2004 tsunami, and is absolutely charming and articulate, with poignant stories about the aftermath of the tsunami. This is a great place, worth a drive, if necessary, and a wonderful restaurant for people in Cave Creek/Carefree/North Scottsdale areas."}
{"text":"Quick every other year update: still love the tempura vegetables and ANY of the curries, adore the Tom Kha soup, think the crab rice sucks, and just tried Black Pepper Pork with Tofu and it was most excellent.  Definitely Cave Creek/Carefree's BEST Asian restaurant---forget the other two joints located within the town boundaries, trust me!  THIS is the place to indulge yourself in Asian food!  :)"}
{"text":"Be careful if you're allergic to cucumbers, they put it in the water. Ordered the crab fried rice, couldn't find the crab. OK at best."}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday night with my husband and had a wonderful dinner.  Great ambiance and awesome food!   We started with Hendricks and tonic with lime and potstickers both were delicious!  Our main meal we ordered the yellow shrimp curry and chicken drunken noodles.  Both were excellent.  We didn't have room for dessert:(

The menu had so many wonderful items to choose from.  Can't wait to try other savory meals.

The service was outstanding.  Our waiter was truly a good guy - you could just tell.  Not only was he friendly and very attentive but he actual seemed to enjoy the business and that says a lot about a place!

All and all a great dining experience.  We took a menus home for future takeout orders.

The bathrooms were spotless and there was plenty of parking nearby.  

We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This may be the best Thai food I've ever had in my life! Z's sauces are amazing and the crab puffs are to die for!!"}
{"text":"Best Drunken Noodles and Tom Yum soup! Very friendly atmosphere, clean, fresh and healthy food.

I highly recommend this establishment for either lunch or dinner :)"}
{"text":"This was a ridiculous meal! We set out at just about the end of service time and we're able to order whatever we wanted. The food was outstanding. My boyfriend said he could drink the Penang curry! I completely agree. This is our new go to spot! Funny that it's in an area of cowboys. Hopefully they will try this -- absolutely outstanding! And were from the East Coast very very picky people."}
{"text":"Absolutely excellent! Perfect new location, great interior design. Spacious dining area but cozy. Fabulous food, amazing flavor. Sure to be a big hit in Cave Creek."}
{"text":"My family and I ate here for three nights in a row, that's how amazing it was. Zella ,the owner is incredible. I am having a difficult time telling which was more incredible,her or the food.  I live in  southern Ca , my brother's in Santa  Fe , Nm  and my other sister in Az. I love Asian cuisine , and I have to say this was by far the best and most unusual that I have ever had the pleasure of dining on.  It would be worth the trip to Cave Creek alone just to dine here ! If you are even semi close to this restraunt, don't miss out!"}
{"text":"Excellent flavors and dishes (very clean and fresh food), great service and the restaurant was spotless.

Highly recommended. Will visit again on future trips to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"The food is good. Unfortunately the owner is known to take advantage of her staff by way of making them work hours unpaid.My wife immigrated from Thailand and was glad to get her first job in a Thai restaurant.She didn't know about American labor laws and the restaurant owner (Sirikorn) took full advantage of this. My wife was too timid and shy to say anything to the owner or myself for quite some time.After I learned of Z's Asian Fusion's violation of labor laws I contacted said owner and asked her to pay for the hours owed to my wife.She finally did pay (only 1pay period) in full and then reduced my wife's hourly wage by 20%. Needless to say my wife quit after being demoted simply for asking for being paid in full.She never could get her last paycheck and we've had to contact the Department of Labor. Before you come to this restaurant please consider going elsewhere because it would be supporting a business that exploits others.We've learned the owner (Sirikorn) has had a history of exploiting legal immigrants that don't know any better. Don't support businesses such as this and I would urge anyone reading this to eat at any of the other fine establishments in Cave Creek."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the red and yellow curry which were full of flavor and deliciously spicy. They prepared a special thai chili eggplant dish that was amazing. The crab wontons were also fresh and delicious.  Nice atmosphere and friendly, helpful service. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Let me say that \"Z\" the owner knows how to run a business! She is kind, courteous, explains the menu in detail and is an awesome host! Oh, and the food rocks! Started with the chicken satay with home made peanut butter sauce, yum! To the hot and spicy tom yum soup ( a meal all by itself!) for entrees we tried the massaman beef which was amazingly full of hints of coconut cream, curry and pepper spices, stewed all day and veryyyy tender! Next I sampled the chicken curry which I would have ate next if I had any room! Delicious, fresh, tender! Next time im back from NY I am definitely going to stop at \"Z's\" and try her amazing home cooked thai! Thank you Z ! You were awesome!"}
{"text":"FANTASTIC!  We tried the panang pork curry and the larb gai salad. Delicious! The curry was so yummy I wanted to lick the bowl. Two for one beers were an extra happy surprise. Finished the meal with lynchee black rice which was good and not very sweet. Perfect. We will be back to try more dishes."}
{"text":"Stopped by to try this place today 12/30/17 and found it was closed. The inside looked as if they were out of business. When I called the listed phone number, the message said something about re-opening in mid-December. Not sure what's going on but we didn't get to eat there today.

Edited 5/12/18: I saw on their Facebook page they have a soft opening scheduled for 5/15/18 at their new location. Hopefully we will get to try their food soon!"}
{"text":"I met my 4 girlfriends for lunch.  This little gem is literally around the corner from home.  We were greeted by the owner and seated quickly.  The owner mentioned the hot and spicy selections could be lessened in hotness.  We ordered the lunch special and had a small salad with the meal.  The salad was fresh and tasty.  We had Pad Thai, orange chicken and fried rice.  All were good.  The service was very good and the atmosphere calm and quiet."}
{"text":"Where do I start?? Walked in restaurant was cozy and inviting. Live music was going on. Staff were friendly, Owner Z was the sweetest, Was recommended the Drunkin Noddle which was first time ordering that dish. Came out perfect and full of flavor. Seating area was comfortably organized where your not having to eat so close to the tables next to you.. Means alot. :) Crab Cakes were a treat we couldnt stop eating them.. Yum! Jeorbie i believe was the artist who was performing, she was very lovely to sit & listen too. Recommend everyone make this place your regular dinning spot up north. :)"}
{"text":"Was driving by and noticed this place.  Decided to stop by and was pleasantly surprised.  My 10 year old ordered sweet and sour chicken and learned that battered and fried was NOT the way it was supposed to be prepared.  He ate the entire plate.  I was amazed.  Veggies and all.  Well, maybe the promise of ice cream helped but it was still a first."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service!  Z is friendly and an amazing chef.  The other manager high strung but got things moving.  I will definitely be back and recommend to friends.

The cucumber salad, curry, and drunken noodles were all very tasty!"}
{"text":"If your looking for something other than bbq or the same old dinner I would suggest you try z's. Great food at a reasonable price. You will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"I've been trying to get my wife to try Z's with me for a long time and today I finally talked her into it and it was AWESOME!!! Today was our 1st time at Z's definitely will not be the last, in fact, we liked it so much we have already made plans to go back tomorrow!! Great Food, Great Atmosphere and Great Service!! My advice to anyone reading this is, do yourself a favor and go to Z's Asian Fusion as soon as possible, you will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"On a recent work trip to Cave Creek, I was looking for an authentic Mexican style, but settled on Thai instead, despite the suspicions one might logically have about finding good Thai food in a small cowboy-themed Arizona pueblo, I was pleasantly surprised!  I was warmly greeted by the beautiful and sophisticated proprietor, and when I didn't find on the lunch menu precisely what I was looking for, she cheerfully offered to make it anyway.  Wow!  A terrific panang curry that was spicy enough to get my attention but not so much that it would slow me down. Generous enough to provide for leftovers a little later, too. Thai iced tea was reliably good. More charming and personable than the exterior would suggest, I look forward to returning next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Wow.  What an experience.  All I can say is that I have been to Thailand quite a few times and this place is the next best experience other than traveling to Thailand.  The food is prepared by the Owner, Zilia and everything tastes so good.  The food is fresh as can be and Zilia personally comes around and interacts with customers, making sure that their experience is outstanding.  The atmosphere is relaxing and live music is played at the restaurant at times.  I cannot recommend this Thai gem enough.  The food is fantastic, the owner is so kind and the experience is truthfully memorable."}
{"text":"We were there again last night and tried the pork padthai and also the classic panang pork curry. Soooo good we ate every last bite. (Soooo full). This place never misses!"}
{"text":"New place in Cave Creek, welcome to the neighborhood.   Very good curry and pad thai.   Looking forward to our next visit to try more things on the menu."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Asian food I have ever had. The coconut soup was spicy and Heaven on earth! I love phu and I was expecting something close and this blew me away! The wings were homemade and after getting to know the owner Z, the more I was pleasantly surprised to find that she uses her own, as well as her grandmothers recipes. She's so sweet and takes such great care of her guests. It's a cute place with a fantastic beer list and amazing sake!!! I ordered her soup to go for TOMORROW!! 10 stars"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place since we just moved nearby and are obsessed with thai food. With the high Yelp ratings we had high hopes. It was a cute restaurant although it looked nothing like any Thai restaurant we've been too. We waited 5 minutes just to get a menu. We were the only guest in the restaurant so we kept trying to get someone's attention give us a menu. We then waited 10 mins just to order. Again, only people in the restaurant. We ordered 3 appetizers. My 2 boys got their entrees. No appetizers in sight. They were finished eating their dinners before 2 of the 3 appetizers came. My husband and I still didn't have our entrees. Finally our entrees came and the 3rd appetizer. The wings were delicious and my hubby loved his pepper chicken. The drunken noodles were ok. My pad thai wasn't very good and the shrimp were horribly overcooked and dry. Didn't realize they charge $4 extra for the shrimp. Usually it's only $2. Especially as bad as the shrimp were. Too many strikes for this place. We won't be back."}
{"text":"We have moved recently to the area and have enjoyed several entrees. They are all made from scratch and have authentic Thai flavors. Great curries, noodles, and unique entrees. We come at least once a week for lunch or dinner. I recommend."}
{"text":"Here is a real rare gem and a beautiful owner to go along with it.  Fantastic and authentic Thai cusine.  If it's not on the menu-- just explain what you'd like--- and in no time you will have it prepared and served at your table."}
{"text":"This place is Fantastic!
   Summer roles with plum sauce. 
Crab fried rice.  Soooo tasty you must stop in you will not regret it!!"}
{"text":"If you're in the area, and in the mood for Thai, I can't recommend Z's enough. I can't tell you my favorite menu item because everything we tried (potstickers, curry, pad see ewe) so good! My 3 YO and her 3 YO BFF loved it too, and the owner (who served us) was so kind and attentive throughout the meal! I can't wait to go back, sit on the patio, and try even more awesomeness."}
{"text":"My husband and I just had the greatest Thai meal at Z's.  We usually go to Cafe Binks in Carefree but we wanted to try something new.  Their margaritas were terrific, the panang delicious and creamy and Z brought me more coconut milk and my husband's pad Tai perfect.  We had fried bananas and lychee ice cream for dessert.   We are going to go back and start at the top of the menu and work our way down,  everything was just superb."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Lots of Gluten Free options all made from scratch! The couple that owns the restaurant are so kind, friendly, and genuinely care about ensuring people with allergies are safe."}
{"text":"The best Thai food/asian fusion ever !!!
A little gem of a restaurant in Cave Creek with full bar and outside patio seating.  Can not describe how delicious the food is, come in and see for yourself.
\"Z\" the beautiful owner will take care of you, I guarantee this will become your new favorite restaurant ..."}
{"text":"I had the Pad Tai with shrimp and the shrimp were huge. It was the best Pad Tai I've had. The waitress was so sweet and friendly. She came over and talked with me cause I was dining alone. I'm coming back again. Very clean and the decor was tasteful and colorful."}
{"text":"Very good food. The Panang curry with pork tenderloin was excellent. Efficient friendly server. Nice outdoor dining space (on the road but slow speed limit so car noise not a bother)."}
{"text":"We're from San Francisco visiting friends in Scottsdale. This is one of the best Thai restaurants we have ever been to.

The food and service were wonderful.  \"Z\" the owner, she made everything even better.

Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best kept secrets in the greater North Scottsdale/Cave Creek area.....especially for people who love Thai food. Wonderful menu serving delicious food, warm ambiance and wonderful service!  First time we ordered thomkhaguy soup with shrimp which was delicious.  On last visit I had salad appetizer with yellow curry and lobster!  My husband had coconut shrimp and red curry.  So yummy!  Eager to return as the wine and beer selections are also very good."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch this week on my birthday and I was not disappointed. I spent a year in Thailand, MANY years ago, courtesy of Uncle Sam. This is the real deal and I was delighted. We'll be going back again and again. They didn't even make fun of my rusty Thai. :)"}
{"text":"Horrible experience. We ordered food, and waited 40 minutes, and it still never showed up. We finally just walked out. We would have stayed had somebody came and explained to us what was taking so long or offered to refill our drinks. Seems like they were waiting on every table except ours."}
{"text":"The vegetarian food was excellent. Highly recommend the Massaman curry and drunken noodles. The panang curry and green curry weren't bad either."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited last night and I must say that I was pleasantly surprised!  I'm a meat and potatoes kind of guy and just had them make recommendations for our entree.  Both our meals were FANTASTIK!  The appetizers were authentic and excellent as well!

Service here was way above average.  Z and Ed both were throughout the restaurant visiting with guests and exchanging pleasantries.

Overall feeling is very nice.  Well laid out, nice lighting, perfect for an evening for 2 but we plan to go back soon with several friends so they can enjoy the atmosphere as well.

Prices were very fair especially for the portion sizes.  I found their complete menu on Facebook.

Definately on our list of favorite restaurants!"}
{"text":"Great hidden gem in Downtown Cave Creek!

Their Thai selections are especially impressive, and their Crab Puffs are extraordinary and unique! Excellent, friendly service as well."}
{"text":"WOW.  I am so impressed with Z's. I have lived in the Cave Creek area for a long time. My 'go-to' restaurant is no longer in Cave Creek and I have others I regularly frequent. Decided to try this place after passing it so many times and absolutely loved it. This is a new \"go-to' spot."}
{"text":"What a gem of a place!  Wonderful atmosphere and a large menu.  The prices are above average, but it is a great value for the portions and quality.  We started with the egg drop soup, 6-piece shrimp tempura (which came as a huge platter with veggies too) and the grilled pork appetizer.  My wife had the Pad Thai and I had a the Pepper Beef dish.  

We'll absolutely be back and we agreed that we can't order the same items again, to get the variety.

I'd suggest to have a highchair for the little ones, and not just a booster seat, but when my two year old was the best he's ever been in a restaurant while sitting in that booster seat - can't complain!"}
{"text":"This place is in the same shopping center as my nail place, so I figured it was worth a shot.  One of the best decisions I've made in a looonngg time.

Walked in, was greeted by the owner, and told her I was new to her restaurant, and wanted to order take-out.  She took the time to review the menu with me, ask what I like, and made recommendations.

I ordered the chicken wings and the pork panang curry.

(While waiting, we continued to chat about food in general, and as others have said, she is an entirely delightful lady.  :) )

So, to the food.  Chicken wings - OK.  Pork  panang...oh, crazy, crazy good!  The best dish on the entire menu, in my opinion, is the Tom Kha soup.  And, you can ask for ANY dish to be made spicy to your taste, so go for it, as good Thai, is spicy Thai.

This is now on the standard rotation whenever we're craving Asian food.  Great stuff."}
{"text":"Food was fresh, and the atmosphere was comfortable.  Portions are so-so.  Very friendly people.  Worth a try!"}
{"text":"Excellent and fresh Thai food and wonderful staff. Dine in or for takeout give Z's a try"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Unassuming but incredible Thai food. I wanted to lick the plate. Seriously a hidden gem here in the creek!"}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD! Stopped by here for our last meal on vacation and was not disappointed. Everything was so flavorful, the red curry was the best I've ever had! My family members also got the tom yum soup and drunken noodles (both fantastic). The owners were kind and personable, and made great conversation. They specified each dish to our liking with level of heat! Being from Southern California, I've had quite a bit of Thai food and this was the best I've ever had. I'll be sure to stop by next time I'm in Arizona!"}
{"text":"We found this restaurant by driving by and I saw it had very high reviews so my family and I decided to give it a try... All four of us very blown away by how amazing everything was!! From the very warm, welcoming service to the fresh, authentic food! The Red Curry was absolutely delicious.. The best I've ever had and crab puffs were the real deal.. Not the fake kind! Everyone's food was super fresh and had wonderful flavors. This place truly is a hidden gem, can't wait to go back!! HIGHLY recommended."}
{"text":"Exceptional Red Curry.  This is a little gem you shouldn't miss.  Great food & service!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious curry! Have been looking for a good Thai place since moving from Portland, Or and this was amazing!"}
{"text":"Checking out a new Thai restaurant in Cave Creek  Z's Thai Margarita and Tempura Veggies were a great start.  Empty plates?  Great finish!  No pictures of our food (Green Curry & Clams Basil Sauce), but I can assure you it was delicious!"}
{"text":"On our last Arizona stay we tried Z's. We live in LA & have eaten in our fair share of Thai restaurants. This is one of the best Thai meals we EVER had, Opal Thai in Oahu is the other. Two remarkable dishes were the slow roasted pork Panang Curry (owner's grandmother's recipe) & the shrimp Tom Kha. The other dishes were good but these really stood-out. Complex flavors, tender pork in the curry & just the right amount of heat. We were served by Zilia, the owner who is Thai. Very welcoming, knowledgeable & attentive. She told us her food is southern Thai & Malay-Thai style. Prices are reasonable. If you eat Thai food you have to try this restaurant."}
{"text":"The food was amazing- everything was made fresh when we got there. Super home cooked feel, Z hang out with us while we ate! Try the pad Thai it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Got 2 lunch specials: the Indian fried rice and the Pad Thai. Excellent dishes. We were really happy with the meal and even chatted with the owner a bit. Would come again. Highly Recommended."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely wonderful.  It is very fresh and tasty! The owner is friendly.  There are options for vegans and vegetarians here.  Every time we get to the Phoenix area we come here to get the curry (the green curry is my favorite). But all of their food is great."}
{"text":"WOW this place was amazing! I saw this place here on yelp and decided to give it a try!  I was definitely not disappointed! The food was so amazing. We had the pot stickers, the Penang curry chicken and the basil sauce chicken. You could just tell there was a lot of heart put into these dishes! The chef and I assume the owner came out to greet us and check on how our evening was which was such a nice surprise! She told me about another dish of which is her grandmothers recipe that I cannot wait to try next time. Great food,great service, and over all very genuine place to visit. I think it's my new favorite spot in the area! Please go check them out! 5 stars from me! Well done!"}
{"text":"This place is really delicious! Everything we ordered was very good and the management is super friendly and attentive! We're coming here again and again!"}
{"text":"I love this place, what a great surprise in Cave Creek!

The service is simply over the top.  the owners walk around making suggestions and making sure things are perfect.

We have been there 3 times, ordered three different things, and they have all been incredible.  Just fantastic food!

Make sure you try the Asian beer selection as well."}
{"text":"The place is lovely and the owner/chef is the sweetest!  I ordered vegetable green curry. It was delicious but portion VERY small and too expensive. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"NOT your run of the mill Asian food!!  Well done sauces that ran the gamut from Light (my wife had Naked Garlic dish that was light and slightly sweet) to Spicy (I had a Black Pepper chicken) that had strong flavor (was indicated to be spicy) Just the way I like them. 

Add a little Sake and it was an excellent Dinner.  

Excited to see their new space sometime in October just a few miles down the road still on Cave Creek, but at Tom Darlington."}
{"text":"There is nothing more pleasant than returning to a restaurant one remembers as having been very good and discovering that it exceeds those memories. This is our second visit to this spot, but it won't be our last. The menu is diverse, the service thoughtful, and the ambiance pleasant."}
{"text":"If you are looking for authentic Thai food, this is the place!  I have been to Thailand four times and have never had Thai food that tasted like \"home\".  The owner has chef's from Thailand and uses her grandmother's recipes that have been in the family for generations.  I live in Los Angeles, where there are some of the best Thai restaurants in the world.  Z's Asian Fusion is better than anything in LA. Run, don't walk if you are craving authentic Thai food."}
{"text":"Went to Z's for lunch today with a friend. This was our first time. Very nice, small Thai restaurant. I got yellow curry with chicken, my friend got the red curry with chicken and we shared the Drunken Noodles with vegetables. All were lunch specials for $7.99. All the food was delicious! The sweet owner/cook came out to greet us and to ask us how we liked our meals. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We have driven by this place for years, but decided to try it for the first time tonight. We began with a yummy hot and sour soup with lemongrass. We had calamari onion rings and veggie rolls as well. Both delicious. Our entree, which was large enough for two, was scallops in a yellow curry sauce, served with brown rice on the side. This was amazing. So many wonderful flavors combined for a great culinary experience.  We are definitely putting this on our list of great local finds."}
{"text":"Sorry folks. We love Thai food & even have spent time in Thailand. This was not good Thai food & very expensive for what you get. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Horrible, horrible, horrible. Lots of staff, but we were served by a blonde kid. He looked to be 14 or 15, and was super awkward. We got water and ordered the pot stickers - the menu indicated there were 6 in an order. 15 minutes later, \"Z\" was in the process of greeting people at two tables personally, our waters were dry as the Sonora Desert, and we got our FOUR pot stickers from the kid, who left immediately without asking for our order, offering more water, or any other sign resembling service. Meanwhile, \"Z\" continued to chat with the table of 4 behind us, and that table ravedvabout how honored they felt to have such personal service... Ugh. 

We got up and left.

Never. Again."}
{"text":"Hidden gem so close to home!!!! The food is exceptional!! Fresh!! Owner charming and cooks fresh! Did I say Fresh!!!! We enjoyed potstickers with chicken and vegetables steamed and seared to perfection, salad with wonderful Asian dressing, shrimp with ginger that had fresh ginger, vegetables and perfectly cooked shrimp and Bob had a curry dish that made him sweat but every bite delicious.  Can't wait to return!!! Tell your friends and be sure to try this place."}
{"text":"The fresh rolls were terrible, giant wads of lettuce wrapped in rice paper. Shrimp was virtually nonexistent. Chicken adobo was alright but nothing to write home about. Both overpriced. One redeeming factor was the people who work there were friendly and fun."}
{"text":"What a delight to have such fresh, authentic food so closeby. My family and I had a delicious meal tonight and I look forward to returning. We had heavenly Panang Curry, very flavorful Flounder with Roasted Red Onion and Tomato Sauce and of course the Drunken Noodles and Phad Woon Sen.

Looking forward to having other dishes next time. The owner, Zilia Rungboonkong was very helpful in her recommendations."}
{"text":"I've driven past this place a few times and finally decided to stop in. The food was fantastic and the service was even greater! I can't believe that I've been missing out on this hole in the wall. You MUST try the crab puffs, i am already craving them! This place has become my new favorite spot"}
{"text":"Excellent food!  We were disappointed that they were out of potstickers and tofu, but the stuff that we had was awesome. They recommended a replacement for the potstickers (some sort of Vietnamese dish) that was great. My dad's first time trying curry and he likes it. :)"}
{"text":"Z's Asian Fusion is to die for! A friend and I went for dinner tonight. We split the yellow curry and the drunken noodles. The vegetables were crisp, and everything tasted fresh. I tend to like my curry on the spicy side and that was no problem for Z! Food came out prompt, and Z came out and checked on everyone multiple times to ensure everything was well! Overall splendid experience. Thanks Z!!"}
{"text":"Found this place after reading other Yelp reviews and they didn't disappoint.

Very good food!  I had the beef Maussman (sp?) which is a curry coconut milk flavored dish that was absolutely delicious.

We also had some crab puff appetizers which were very good.

Affordable prices and good food.  A good combo."}
{"text":"Had to write an update to my last review.  We went back for dinner and the old, delicious Z's was back, yay!!!!
Had the drunken noodles and parang curry.  Both were delicious, fresh and spicy.  So happy.

Very glad this was another great experience and hopefully the experience last time was just a fluke."}
{"text":"Wonderful meal! Great summer rolls, lettuce, cabbage so fresh and crunchy; fantastic peanut sauce. Green curry was spicy and tasty, veggies were not overlooked. Chicken masala was also excellent. Naan bread was tasty. Good wine list. Nice ambiance. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Best Thai food around. Z recently relocated the restaurant, and the new location is wonderful, preserving the intimacy of the previous location with a fresh, updated look. Z cooks with fresh ingredients and delivers great flavor with every dish. Our favorites are the Panang curry and the Tom Kha soup. The crab puffs are fabulous as well. We plan on trying everything on the menu. You should too."}
{"text":"We have an outstanding Thai restaurant at home and have eaten at many, many others in travels...Thai is one of our favorite cuisines. This was the best. This was authentic Thai. The depth and complexity of flavors was unsurpassed. We had pork with Panang curry and beef with Massaman curry. Both meats were slow cooked and fork tender. Yes, we waited awhile for our food but it was well worth it."}
{"text":"Z's is a small restaurant that you could easily miss but DON\"T, it is a treasure when you venture in. For us it was a great neighborhood find. The decor is simple, the service is warm and inviting and the food is absolutely delicious. Best Asian food we have had in a long time. We had the crab puff appetizers which we could have eaten a dozens of, they were that good. Everything is made fresh to order. I had the Pad Thai with beef which was different than I have ever had and oh so tasty and my husband had one of the Thai Curry dishes which he had made to the spiciest and he thought it was amazing. The prices are very reasonable and the portions are large. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"best asian food i have found North of the 101. A little expensive but it's really worth it."}
{"text":"We are spoiled with all the good Thai food available in Dallas.  We love Asian food so decided to try Z's while on vacation.  Happy Hour includes great prices on appetizers.  We had dumplings which were tender, the crab puffs which were homemade & quite creamy, and the limpia which was just ok.  Thai Basil Seafood for dinner was cooked perfectly.  Shrimp & scallops were tender and the dark brown sauce was tasty."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. The service was unbelievably awesome and spot on. This is must, no bad choices here. Will be a regular, glad I stopped in. Thanks to yelp."}
