{"text":"Foods ok. Nothing to write home about. Service is definitely lacking. Probably won't be back. Too long of a trek, too much money for crappy service, and too many other, better pizza places to spend money."}
{"text":"delicious pizza. the Yukon bacon with egg is the best! I usually get take out, but dining is also a great experience. the staff is friendly and the food usually doesn't take that long. the pizza and salads are great."}
{"text":"I really expected to give Nellos a good review but its not that great, not sure if they were in a hurry when they made our pizza but it was lacking in a descent quantity of ingredients we ordered on it we ordered a large pizza with mushrooms, onions, green peppers and pepperoni. One piece out of the whole pizza seamed adequately filled with ingredients. Way to much crust. May come back may not. The bottled beer was $3 also sadly not impressed."}
{"text":"If I could have their salad forever my life would be complete. It has chickpeas, artichoke hearts, sundried tomatoes, olives, mushrooms, cucumber, feta and the most amazing house dressing....for months I went here thinking the Classic Euro pizza was the end all be all but that salad changed my world.   Side note: don't sit at those little tables by the bar, it really ruins the experience.   Slight annoyance, there are coupons for Nello's in the entertainment book, but they wont work at this location."}
{"text":"Pizza, pizza, pizza. Love it. Nello's is a good laid back place to get together with some family and/or friends and have lots of options for pizza and sald, and knock a few back. Service is about 4 stars too."}
{"text":"Have been here a couple of times and the experience has always been pleasant. Food is great and the service is equally good. I've always had their pizza but would love to try other entrees as well.  Place is well suited for any gathering."}
{"text":"I just tried this place last night and it was amazing!  The pizza really has its own \"taste\" to it and is delicious.  Got the thin crust deluxe and loved it.  The staff is amazing there!  Even though we got there at 9pm (their closing time during the week), they still seated us and gave us great service!  We didn't leave until 10:30pm!  They were great!  Go there, it won't disappoint!!"}
{"text":"The food here is excellent, from Pizza to Pasta, to Great salads!! great beer selection, excellent atmosphere, staff is fun and personable. If you're looking for New York style pizza fire grilled, this is your place!!"}
{"text":"While passing through Phoenix on the way to Cali with my hubby yesterday we stopped in and ordered a BBQ chicken pizza. We out pizza lovers so would never turn one down however given the high rave reviews expected a bit better. Our pizza was good but was skimpy on the toppings and a little on the dry side. It may have been due to the type of cheese that was used and the lack of enough BBQ sauce to make up for the consistency of the cheese (which was not mozzarella) . As i said, I love pizza so still enjoyed it and like the flavor. I would probably go again but try something different. The service was also very good both in attentiveness and speed of delivery."}
{"text":"I love the build your own thin crust pizza!!  The service here is great and they have an awesome selection of beers on tap.  Cheesecake is great if you get it before it sells out.  I can't wait to go back when I'm in Phoenix again!"}
{"text":"A local favorite for years that has slowly been straying away from classic dishes to make room for some more adventurous tastes. Everything is good but try their bruschettas, my favorite being the PBJ bruschetta. Very interesting!"}
{"text":"Probably the best place to get a pizza in the Ahwatukee area. It does get rather busy though."}
{"text":"I have been going to the Nello's in tukee for over 10 years. My favorites are their spinach salad with their house dressing, garlic bread with tomatoes, and European pizza. They have delicious food, personable service (everyone who works there is happy to be there), and very reasonable prices.   Bummed they are closed for Sunday lunch though. :("}
{"text":"Go for the thin crust!   Overall experience was wonderful, service was attentive, straight to the point and not smothery. Food at this local pizza joint is high quality you can taste. As a chef dining out for a casual lunch, I left pleased and with cash still in my pocket.  First we had the Roasted Eggplant Bruschetta, the baguette was toasted to perfection. The crust was crisp with a nice light sourdough flavor and chew, not over toasted a bit and still tender on the inside. The four baguettes were topped with a beautiful creamy, tangy goat cheese. The eggplant was beautifully roasted and naturally rich in flavor. Sun-dried tomatoes added a nice acid element to this dish, which was served warm with a well balanced Balsamic Reduction.   Next we tried the Smoked Chicken and Broccoli Pizza. The crust, oh gosh. THE CRUST! Perfect. Thin and crunchy, tender, caramelized in the wood burning oven to a perfect golden brown. The smoked chicken was still moist, the broccoli still had a nice bite to it as all vegetables should and had a fantastic roasted flavor. No sauce here, just a little olive oil and garlic went down before the toppings. The Mozzarella and Smoked Provolone were appropriate, but a nice nutty Asiago or Parmesan-Reggiano would have been a welcome touch.  Bacon? Of course we added bacon! An Applewood Smoked Bacon. Although in recent years bacon, and especially Applewood Smoked has been overplayed in the culinary world, Nello's kept it organic in style. The bacon has a wonderful fatty crunch, just the right balance of salt and smoke and cooked just so. The half slabs of thick, delicious bacon were simply laid over our pizza towards the end of cooking. Very pleased this bacon wasn't chopped up into tiny bits.   The Banana-Nut Bread Pudding was tempting but Tiramisu has my heart. Being half Italian I know Tiramisu and Nello's has made a great play on this classic dessert. First a thick layer of creamy mascarpone was sweetened to not over power the cheese itself. The ladyfinger layer held its integrity and wasn't soaked to the point of sogginess which is a pleasant surprise. Another generous layer of mascarpone and a surprisingly thick dusting of cocoa powder was a great touch.   Nello's is worth every penny, the bill for two of us was just over $30.00. We left full and happy, too many dining experiences can be disappointing if the little details are left out. They don't miss a beat! David was a fantastic server with an upbeat attitude, the rest of the staff was also attentive and helpful. Beer and Wine selection is nice as well, there is definitely something for everyone here.   Like Nello's on Facebook, they post special items with fantastic seasonal ingredients that any food lover would get pumped over!    I will be back time and time again."}
{"text":"I went to this place over the weekend when I was in Phoenix and I was kind of surprised that they had a opened up a different location (when I was there last, I went with a few buddies, who know the owner, to the one in Tempe on a Saturday night to grab a quick bite and do a little \"pre-partying\"...).  The food was still great but this time it was a different crowd...We had a pretty large group for lunch and we shared a 3 huge salads and a couple deep dish pizzas and one thin crust pizza and there were plenty of leftovers."}
{"text":"Always a great place to come for good food and some ambiance. Pizza is good, even without getting the usual meat style (I'm not a vegetarian at all) wait times can be long especially with a lot if other places nearby opening up."}
{"text":"Nello's is just down the street from us, so it has been a family favorite for years.  We always enjoy a meal here!  Our family hasn't chosen as to which type of pizza we prefer, Chicago, New York, California, etc.  We know we like fresh ingredients, crispy crust, lots of cheese and cold drinks. You definitely get all that and great service at Nello's.  Fresh pizza does take a while longer to prepare than chain par-baked dough.  The salads are huge and are full of flavor.  An there's always a favorite on tap.  We enjoyed the Four Peaks Peach Ale.  Nello's just added a Bambino's Menu, fantastic now they have some great kid's size meals for the little ones to enjoy too!"}
{"text":"Great food. Love the patio! The cheesy pizza crust and bruschetta with bacon and burrata are a must!!"}
{"text":"This is my first review and how appropriate that it would be for one of my favorite pizza joints in AZ. We eat there (actually usually take to go) at least 3x/ month.   The Market fresh thin crust is always amazing. Every week it is different which is great. We have tried the ones on the menu but the weekly special is usually the best choice.  I like the deep dish but ask for light bake and extra sauce. This makes left overs great and I do not like a crunchy crust.  My wife likes the pizza crust and when combined with their sauce for \"dipping\" it is top notch.  The service is always good and the same people have been there for years (always a good sign).  I agree the beer selection is great and the bar tenders are very knowledgeable and can find a good match for anyone. They are one of the few places with 4 Peaks Hop Knot.  The house dressing is great and you can take home a bottle for $5 to enjoy all week."}
{"text":"Never disappoints - I have been there 5 times and it's really an experience always. Best Pizza, the bread is always so well done. Awesome place, highly recommended."}
{"text":"I'm not going to mess around...sometimes you here about a \"legendary\" establishment, only to find out they put a chunk of crap on a piece of bread with some Prego and hope your too stupid to realize, and then, they want you to think it's artistic culinary creativity.  So, that being said..Nello's was on my list of must try legendary restaurants..when the Uber dropped me off my first thought was, how does this supposed legendary restaurant get a spot next to a fraternity ridden, trash pad greasy sports bar? That's got to be interesting for business!   When I entered in, I was promptly greated by an exuberant, exotic slightly bearded fellow with a hip plaid shirt..not bad, made me feel comfortable, welcomed. When I sat at the bar, I observed a very close relationship between the coworkers that seemed, as one of their shirts said, like FAMILY! The guy that greated me as if we've been friends for years, also took my drink order! Fresh Squeezed! Hell YES! I'll take 3!   Some small talk as I asked questions about the menu, then some grub. At this point, I want to just hang out, I think his name was Dan..or Dave..we were best friends by this point and I thought it rude to request his name once again.  First up (1 Fresh Squeeze down, 1 on deck!) I ordered a special item..the Chefs Board. Brilliance on wood! Every item was displayed like a picture in a world class cook book. Chef Ramsey would have nothing but praise for this wonderment of delicatessen delight! Maybe some dill pickles added is all I'd say..but even if not, I'll order this every time I'm in town.  Entree. (2 Fresh Squeezed down, switching to iced tea..which is fresh brewed, and tasty). Gluten free pizza with Real! Olive Oil..no sh#%..you can taste it's legitimacy! Cheese, chicken, bacon and pepperoni. I can't imagine ordering anything else. It was all super good, real...fresh made on their own, combined together for an amazing conglomeration of palate igniting insanity. After my food erection went away, my new best friend, D-simething, told me about the mint chocolate chip Gelato..so, since his advice has been spot on thus far, and we are now besties, he hooked it up! And all I need to know is...where...where can I buy this by the pint?   Mind...BLOWN! Thanks Dan..or Dave..eh.. you're my new Phoenix go to guy! Thanks for the touristy suggestions and just all around badass experience you led me on! I WILL be back!     - a very awesomely stuffed (with good, quality food!) Hans / IT Security Specialist."}
{"text":"Revamped menu with stellar food regardless of day or time. Knocking out a wood fired thin crust and a Alfredo pasta, add chicken cutlet. Delish! Great beer and cheap to (cheap restaurant priced) premium wines and beer. Happy wife, happy life!!!"}
{"text":"This is my families pizza haven - and we try and get here once a week! Everyone who works here is friendly, nice & really wants you to have a great time.  They are constantly coming up weekly pizza, salad & appetizer specials that are different and wonderful.  The \"wedge\" salad was one of my favorites! They also have great patio seating as well."}
{"text":"What can you say about Nellos....a truly family run operation serving up good pizza in a friendly atmosphere. Although there are a number of locations throughout the Valley now, I remember when living in Ahwatukee going to Nellos, and seeing the late Pat Tillman, his wife, along with his brother and Jake Plummer eating pizza and having a good time. Everyone knew who Pat and Jake were, but they were left along, treated like normal customers, and it made for a special memory everytime we would see them. The pizza is the foundation, but with a great offering of sandwhiches and Italian dishes, there isn't a bad item on the menu. I truly love the house dressing that they make and bottle for purchase. It turns a normal green salad into a tasty treat. If you have a Nello's in your area, for the value and service, they are a great choice."}
{"text":"We've been going to Nello's since we moved to Ahwatukee. Their pizza is awesome! Make sure you get there early on Friday nights, otherwise you may have to wait some time to be seated. But it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Love. Love. Love.   Recently moving to the Chandler area, I have been following yelp  reviews from restaurant to restaurant.  Many of the 4 and 5 star reviews I have found to be odd after visiting the restaurant.  Frankly, it's been really hard to find a really good restaurant that actually makes it's own food.   Finally, I have my pizza place.  And my great salad place.   A little farther from home than I would like, but this place is absolutely worth the drive.    My only complaint is that the women's bathroom desperately needs remodeled.  It's so old that the caulk around tile is just black in places and it doesn't look clean.  The soap and paper towel dispenser were difficult to operate....just too old."}
{"text":"We were regulars here.  It was a short walk from home and worth every step.  Wonderful pizza, both traditional and non traditional.  The pasta and starters are great as well.  Wonderful staff fast courteous service.  They also have a very efficient pick up counter.   If you are in the area, don't look for the chain pizza places.  Go to Nello's"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed Nellos.  The atmosphere is nice and relaxed and the food was good as well.  I love that they have a variety of bruschettas you can make a nice little meal of."}
{"text":"It may not be the best pizza in the valley. But it's damn close. It's not some pretentious overpriced hipster joint where your expectations are  unreasonable. The pizza is very good as are the salads. Great comfortable neighborhood place with good service and servers who are always friendly and willing to get you what you want. Crowded at times and the bar could be bigger. But that's because it's just a cool place to hang out for pizza and beer. I also believe that the owners take care of their employees only because I've seen many if them there for years and they seem happy still."}
{"text":"Started going to Nellos on Alma School in 1990... Loved I then and love the Warmer location now!"}
{"text":"The pizzas were okay, but not quite worth what we paid for them. They have some nice creative combinations, but they didn't wow me. To be honest, our dining experience was polluted by the woman in the next booth who had no concept of what \"indoor voice\" means, but that's auxiliary to this review.  They do have a gluten free option, which was important to our guests.   Service was done well."}
{"text":"I was one of the very first customers of Nello's when it opened as a sandwich shop in Tempe. Over the years the Ahwatukee location has maintained the original quality of the pizza and sandwiches and the Chicago pizza joint ambiance the Mai brothers had at the original location.   Their gluten free crust is as good as the original, which makes it my daughter's favorite place. The beer and wine selection is good and the staff is always friendly, courteous and efficient.   There are lots of fancy pizza places to assuage the snobbery of the pretentious types. Nello's is for those who want to dig into a genuine, authentic Chicago pie."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Pizza is outstanding.  Service - excellent.  Decor - comfortable and clean.  Tried a bruschetta sampler and have to admit it wasn't as good as it could be.  The toppings were fine.  The toast wasn't.  Normally, bruschetta is served on lightly toasted, thickly sliced bread that is crunchy on the edges and softer in the center.  This version was served on what amounted to a large crouton.  Completely hard and not very tasty.  The waiter assured me the \"bread\" was made in house but I suspect that's not the case.  I think it's purchased in a pre-toasted, fully-realized crouton state.  Either way, the pizza more than made up for the appetizer!  I chose the Yukon Gold pizza which comes with VERY thinly sliced potatoes, pancetta, gorgonzola, mozz, rosemary, and olive oil - a white pizza.  I'm a vegetarian and they are SUPER nice about customizing.  I asked for mushrooms instead of pancetta, and added onions.  It was outstanding!  Wonderful, Neapolitan style crust perfectly baked in a wood fired oven.  One of the best pizzas I've ever had, actually.  The rosemary was fresh, not dried which made a huge difference.    I love a restaurant that stays open all day and just has a single menu, not lunch and dinner.  Another plus for Nello's.  I visit Phoenix every year and I will make this place part of every trip."}
{"text":"Great salads. Appitizers. Sandwhiches. And the patio outside is one of my favorites when it gets to be that time of year. However , the pizza is not my favorite, which is why I couldn't give it 5 stars. As far as the pizza goes my standards may be high being from back east. I like the thin crust with some of the specialty toppings, but the plain cheese just doesn't do it for me. With that said, great food, great service, great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I have not eaten in the restaurant in a long time because I like to order my pizza to go. I usually get a movie and pop it in and sit back and enjoy a few slices. Too bad the Blockbuster that was next door is closed... now I have to stop by Basha's for the movie....  Usually we get the margherita pizza because I eat with family members who are vegetarians. They always have Nello's add extra garlic to the pizza which is not a fave of mine, there is enough on it without adding extra, but that isn't Nello's fault... it's crazy Vegetarians trying to make up for the lack of tasty tasty meat. Hehe JK.  A different pizza that I enjoy with omnivore's is their bbq chicken pizza. It is always tasty and I am kind of full of sadness as I write about it. It has been too long since I have had that pizza!  I wish I could remember the other 2 pizza's I have tried and liked but I am not sure which ones they are.  Oh well. I might just have to go and update this in the near future.  One thing I really like about going there to dine is that they have a great beer selection that includes a few AZ brews. I am just trying to be semi-economical lately and eating at home allows the beer and wine to be cheaper. Plus no tip is really needed, although I usually give the take out gal a buck."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere, great service, great prices, and most important of all GREAT FOOD. It can be crowded during peak hours but certainly worth the wait. The Wood Fired pizzas are highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Great food and the best service we have had in a long time! This will definitely be our new pizza spot. I have zero complaints. If you have not been you are missing out!"}
{"text":"This location of Nello's deserves a \"forbes\" 5 star review for service and consistently excellent food. It is like a finely tuned instrument. WOW! I love this place."}
{"text":"Great crust on the pizza \"pie.\" Nice patio, excellent salads, good food, clean restaurant... I have come her for years and it is better than ever. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"One of our favorites! Love the original deep dish, with the old world classic and house dressing. These two together are phenomenal. Servers are always attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Nello's has been our family's favorite go-to for years. They've always made really great food, and more recently have worked to revamp the menu adding in some new favorites like the Salmon BLT, the Grinder, and of course their market salads and pizzas. If you go there, ask for the Sajone pizza as well. It's a combo of their Salsiccia and Pavone Pepperoni pizzas that are wood fired, and it is delicious. (Don't forget the pork wings too!)"}
{"text":"One of our long time favorites for pizza.   Their original crust is like no other pizza (a tomato, sun-dried tomato and basil is one of our favorites).  The Old World Salad is also one of our usuals.   Their market specials often sound a little crazy but are typically delicious!"}
{"text":"We love Nellos!  We eat there a couple times a month - the restaurant is great and kid friendly.  Wonderful pizzas and salads, and the tiramisu is to die for!  Tonight, we ordered take out - there was a slight mix up in the order.  Cliff, the manager, not only made it right, but went above and beyond in fixing the issue. (Eggplant and chicken parm were both amazing too!) Grateful fo have such a wonderful place in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"The wood fired pizzas are so good - for dinner, and the next day for breakfast. :)  They also have one of the best tiramisus I've ever tasted."}
{"text":"Chicago style pizza with thick crust & deep toppings. We also ordered spinach salad. It was very fresh. The creamy poppyseed dressing is a local fave.  Outdoor patio under a red awning lined with the ubiquitous misters is perfect for a casual, Friday night out."}
{"text":"Unique wood fired pizza. Arugula, sun dried tomatoes- yummy. Great wine selection.  Can be very busy on weekends do go by 5. Great happy hour. Unique salads."}
{"text":"Love the pizza, so good. People are polite. It's always busy. Great spot, way better than Scottsdale location. Definitely will be returning!"}
{"text":"amazing pizza, great prices, fun for dine in and great for take out. I always get the original crust pizza with italian sausage and eggplant and ricotta...IT'S TOO GOOD! I would probably die if this left my neighborhood"}
{"text":"This is one of those rare times that I'm not in line with popular Yelp opinion. Guys, I'm not sure what the heck I'm missing here.  I've tried two Pizzas here: the BBQ Chicken and the Vegetarian. Both pizzas were beautifully presented but they were equally bland as pretty. I must admit the Old World Salad is good but I don't think I'll come back for just the salad \"shrugs\". I like the location and the dining room is nice but it' LOUD in here.  I'm just not sure what the hype is about, I think I'll pass on the flavorless pretty pizza."}
{"text":"Food was really good. The service today was the best I've had. Angela took excellent care of us and we had a great late lunch. Two merlots and a large pizza. Her recommendations were spot on. Definitely coming back. Mo (socks) was very kind as well."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best pizza places in ahwatukee. One thing that helps them stand out is their house sauce. Order it on the side with any pizza and you will be begging for more!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and everything.  I think I have been there at least 6 or 7 times and the last 3 or 4, they were out of the wheat crust.  It's one of my favorite things and they are ALWAYS out of it.  You would think that if you are always running out, you would make more, right?  But in the end, the food is good.  Service is good enough.  Probably should be a 4 star rating, but the \"out of wheat crust\" thing really frustrates me and I will likely not go back."}
{"text":"This pizzeria is quickly becoming one of our favorites. The deep dish, Chicago style, pizza is to die for! It is perfectly balanced with delicious cheese that isn't over powering and blends well with the other ingredients. The bottom crust is deliciously crunchy - so good, addictive actually. We always receive great service. Nate is one of the best servers we have ever met. He is attentive, makes great recommendations and follows our pace. I highly recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"We love Nello's in Ahwatukee!  We usually do take out (as the place is often crowded).  Everyone is so friendly and they even know my sister and I by name (and order) :)  We love the Classic European pizza and our new fave is to get it with an order of garlic bread with cheese and tomatoes - yum!  Can't go wrong with good, quality pizza and great service with a smile!"}
{"text":"We ordered the Caprese for an appetizer and it was delicious. My husband ordered eggplant Parmesan and I had the chicken marsala we both really enjoyed our meals and even better the price was so reasonable we were shocked. He is a picky New Yorker when it comes to Italian food but he said he would go out of his way to come back to eat here."}
{"text":"I love Nello's!!!  My boyfriend and I have been going there for over a year now and have never had a bad experience!  We love the Barbecue Chicken pizza.  If your in to pasta, the Alfredo sauce is amazing!  We love the atmosphere at the restaurant.  Service is great!  The servers are all very friendly and attentive.  (Service is huge with me and they have never let me down)  When we have family or friends in town, Nello's is always a must!"}
{"text":"I've never actually dined in here, but have ordered takeout a half dozen times.  Their pizza is solid.  The Hawaiian was good, with thick hunks of pineapple.  The sausage and artichokes was good but disappointing in that the 'chokes didn't have much flavor.  A more marinated artichoke would have been preferable.   The Deluxe Combo has been my favorite, have had it a few times.  I've had both the thin and original crust, and I much prefer their thin (which is cut into Chicago squares, btw, while the original is slices).  Their lasagna was very good.  I highly recommend it.  Bit disappointed though that ordering it takeout it didn't come with even a small wedge of garlic toast  :("}
{"text":"Thanks to all at Nellos!  We had a rehearsal dinner on Saturday night.  Sonya was most helpful in planning the menu.  I had a few questions on Sonya's day off, David answered my questions and was obviously informed of my event.  So very comforting to know all employees are on the same page with the same mission, to make your event a success!  As always, the food was wonderful.  Nellos fresh ingredients shine through in every bite.   If you're planning an event, know that you can depend on Nellos!"}
{"text":"The menu is eclectic. Great for kids. Homemade mozzarella is amazing. Our waitress Maryanne is one of the best waitresses we have had in years!!!"}
{"text":"A crowd pleaser with gourmet pizzas and salads, great selections of wine and beers. Perfect for a get together with friends, date night or family dinner."}
{"text":"Love the happy hour - half off appies and $3 micro brew pints.  Go for the pizza crust with cheese for $3.25 - basically a deconstructed cheese pizza for 1/4 the price.  Meat and cheese board is also great and very filling.  Spring for the wood fired za (Shriners Pavone Pepperoni is a personal favorite), but don't come before 5pm as they will still be stoking the hardwood flames. I have a dream of someday locking down one of the 3 high top tables in the bar area, always taken by regulars that seem to live there. I have tried almost all the menu items and have yet to be disappointed.  Service is always great - Cody is top notch, high energy and knows his brews.  If Shaun White and the dude waiter from Chotchkie's (Office Space) had a baby, it would be him..."}
{"text":"Called ahead and they told me the wait was going to be 15 min. That's the amount of time I spend right in from of the host for her to acknowledge me. Didn't say welcome or anything just asked for my name and told me the wait was going to be 30 min. Fine not letting me this stop me for trying what supposedly is a great pizza in Ahwatukee. Finally order with the most not nice waiter and revived the most awful pizza I have ever tasted. Digornio is 10 times better. Nello's is lucky we were starving. I won't feed this pizza to my dogs."}
{"text":"They have good pizza and good cannoli. They also have a good happy hour with a rotating draft beer selection."}
{"text":"Love the food here but the service is hit or miss. Can be very slow and take quite a while to get any service. Go at non-noon hour for lunch(it gets crazy busy) and get the individual pizza special. Fairly large, 2-topping pizza, a drink and a side salad for $10! I always have leftovers and the side salad is large and somewhat unique. Lots of veggies and they swirl cut(is this a thing?) the carrot strips. Try their unique ranch and house dressing, mixed. Yummo!"}
{"text":"Normally Nello's to-go lunch is great - not today!   My co-worker found a worm in her half turkey club sandwich!     We called and talked to Shea the manager who condescendingly said that although Nello's washes their lettuce they can't help that a worm won't get off the lettuce.   Now we know the little green worm is quite little, but we are particular that our protein intake not be alive and moving.   With all the lunch providers in Ahwatukee and with the holiday season you would think Nello's may have been apologetic and even a little generous.   We weren't expecting our entire $40 ticket to be comped, but when we asked if I could receive some compensation, Shea responded by saying they can replace the half sandwich/salad if my co-worker came back in that day.   Not even an apology and a $10 gift card.  I guess the Ahwatukee Nello's has a manager who doesn't really believe in a high level of customer service.   I wouldn't have posted this if she would have been a bit kinder in her tone and generous by only a few more dollars.   It really is all about how people are treated - I hope Shea's staff is treated better than we were."}
{"text":"Very Bland, Poor Tasting Pizza!  Does NOT live up to the Hype!!!!    This was the first and probably last visit to Nellos. This pizza does not live up to all the hype here on Yelp. I ordered a pizza with black olives and beef. I had the \"original\" crust. The crust was thick, chewy and tasteless. It looked as thought it was put on a conveyer oven, not woodfired. After the second slice the crust became too hard, bland and chewy to even eat, like cardboard. It was a very bad product. The sauce was very bland, and it looked very much like a frozen pizza, except some frozen pizzas are better. I really don't understand the pizza market in Phoenix.  I grew up in on authentic Italian pizza and cuisine, albeit here in Phoenix everyone seems to sing high praises to very bad pizzas. This pizza does not even compare to a good Pizza. I just think that the folks here in Phoenix haven't tasted a real pizza, If they travel back East and try the pizza then they would know what real Pizza Pie is supposed to taste like.  For now if I want a good Pizza Pie, I'll just have to make it my self.  I would not recommend this place to anyone.  One Star for the Food, One Star for the Service (Service was good, Pizza Bad)"}
{"text":"Ive been a a couple of locations but this one is the best by far!  The food was so delicious. The service was good, attentive but not annoying.  The Chefs Board was really good, had enough to share with 4 people.  We also had the pork wings, who knew pigs had wings, I am sure glad I know now, they were amazing!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend introduced me to Nello's a couple of years ago and ever since then I've been hooked. I must say I am very picky when it comes to food and this place is great!   I love the crust of the pizza. It's different than every other pizza place there is out there. It is very inexpensive too. My boyfriend always gets a salad, we share a pizza (half cheese and half applewood smoked bacon) and have an appetizer and we are usually out of there for 18 to 22 bucks before tip.   I usually sit outside when I go because it is really loud inside. It's really nice outside and for the winter months (even though it's really not super cold here) they have heaters.   The reason I'm giving it four stars instead of five is because we had a rude waiter once. Since we have been there so many times and it was only one time, I'm still a major fan!   I would recommend this place to anybody who likes pizza and wants a change from the everyday pizza chains that are out there."}
{"text":"I am here so much, I have to give them that fifth star!  While the pizza might not be unanimously voted the best in all of the world (although it has received plenty of recognition), it is still pretty effing good.  They have great combinations of quality toppings.  I love the thin crust, I love they have a different, creative market special every week.  They have Four Peaks on tap.  $3 Guinness on Happy Hour.  The salads are delicious.  I crave the house dressing and the white balsamic.  The staff is top notch, totally cool and friendly, and really take the time to get to know their customers.  It is great for families, for cool, casual dates, and low-key gathering of friends.  This is combination of qualities, and the fact that I am usually there once a week, Nello's in Ahwatukee really is as good as it gets and will continue to be one of my go-to restaurants."}
{"text":"I love this place! The pizza is very good, the house salad and salad dressing is super yummy and for the most part service is really good. Here is a great secret that I will share with you. The house salad dressing is super yummy. I like to buy it and take it to go and then serve it to my house guest, everyone asks \"what type of dressing is this\"  of course I tell them that I made it. LOL!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza ! The pork wings as well we're just amazing , if you are visiting Definitely come check them out, their service is an A forsure !"}
{"text":"Decent neighborhood joint, for dining with the family.  I find it a bit pricey, for the quality you get, but it is what it is when you have so few decent dining options in Ahwatukee.  It makes for a decent farewell dinner after each of my AZ visits, else I'd never eat here.  I do like their chopped chicken salad."}
{"text":"A favorite ahwatukee spot that never disappoints. Ordered carryout last night and got our usual Yukon Gold Pizza. This pizza has been our favorite for years and we rarely deviate. The potatoes are thinly sliced, the pancetta and Gorgonzola are perfect compliments. We tried it on the whole wheat crust for the first time and it didn't disappoint so if you prefer whole wheat give it a try! We always get the egg on the pizza and recommend you so too! We also always get a salad to go with and there isn't a bad choice on the menu. Last night we had the chopped chicken. It's a great blend of ingredients and the pine nuts add a nice crunch. Do yourself a favor and check out Nellos soon. You can't go wrong with anything on this menu, we've tried almost everything and NEVER had a subpar meal. The customer service here is always top notch as well. Family friendly but also good for a date night. Tip:  If you order the Yukon gold pizza, get the egg!!! It really takes the pizza to the next level. The weekends are busy so you may have to wait a few minutes for a table, but its worth it!"}
{"text":"Still a five star place in my opinion. Great service, draft beer, salads and flat crust pizza.  The salmon arugula salad is awesome and the market thin crust usually is as well.  Very accommodating for children too!"}
{"text":"For the poster named Kristen from Indiana you are off on the bruschetta.  You probably do not even pronounce it right either.  Nello's bruschetta is the best priced I have ever seen.  6 large pieces for $9 is a steal.  Unlike what Kristen thinks she knows bruschetta does not always come on thick sliced bread.  Try having a sausage and goat cheese pizza in the wood fired oven.  Leave off the mozzarella."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza and salad. Good beer selection. Nice patio ambiance. Their house dressing is out of this world, and the whole wheat pizza crust is delicious! LOVE this place."}
{"text":"Great new place the family and I found! Kids loved the pizza  we certainly will be back"}
{"text":"Overall, I'd award Nellos 4 stars for the pizza and takeaway service and 3.5 stars for dine-in value. Service is typically friendly, which is a plus. I typically order the veggie pizza or the spinach pie when I order takeaway, but a couple of weeks ago, the husband and I decided to try dining in for a change. We ordered a couple of drinks, the bruschetta, and the pesto pecorino (pasta). While I enjoyed the bruschetta and the pasta, portion sizes were surprisingly small. My husband said he'd have to eat more at home in order to satisfy his hunger (and neither of us are large people!). However, Nellos is a solid local place to grab good food, especially when you don't feel like cooking."}
{"text":"Stopped in for an lunch meeting. Staff was very nice to us .restrooms were clean . In fact it was a nice clean restaurant . Worth going out of you're way for .."}
{"text":"With gluten-free pizza available and great toppings, including goat cheese...the choices are limitless. The Old World Traditional salad is so good and filling. Service is a bit spotty, but three can eat well for the cost and quality here. Feels good to support a local biz than go to some mass corp biz. Now, go and enjoy."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and I loved everything about it. DJ makes the best Caesar salad and Trevor was an amazing server. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Great food, great staff, great ambiance. This is our regular, go-to restaurant. Sounds corny, but the staff makes you feel like family.  The hidden menu gem for me is the pork wings. They are awesome, give them a try!"}
{"text":"Food was good but service was slow. We went in for a quick lunch and was there for an hour and 15 minutes.  I would go back but not when time is an issue."}
{"text":"Wow! I've never had pizza on a cracker before!  Ok, it wasn't an actual cracker, but that's how they should have advertised it. The crust was the weirdest crust I have ever had. I couldn't stop laughing, it was so bizarre. It was the stiffest, hardest, blandest crust I've ever eaten.   It's a shame, too because the ingredients were on point. The marinara, pepperoni and cheese were all fresh and delicious. I just wish we could have enjoyed it on a different crust."}
{"text":"I love Nello's.   I'd like to write something prettier, something poetic. It's one of my favorite pizza places, and it deserves a little wordsmithery. But I'm too sated on deep-dish deliciousness to muster up my usual silver-tongued sweetness.  If you like Chicago-style pizza (and I do) made fresh with quality ingredients in generous portions, try Nello's.  Their Hawaiian pizza is excellent. Any of their pizzas are, really.   Or you could smear some tomato paste and plasticky cheese on a piece of charred cardboard and call it \"pizza\". It works for Domino's, after all."}
{"text":"Really warm and friendly staff, delicious margarita pizza! Will definitely go back and excited to try other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"I come here all the time... in fact I have been here 3 times this week for lunch.  I have had their pizza a few times which is always good, but I really love the sandwiches and soups and salads.  I either get their 1/2 sandwich and soup special or salad... you get to chose from any sandwich (turkey and avocado is always great) on the menu and the soup special or a garden salad or Cesar salad.  perfect amount of food.  I also really like their salads... I have had the salmon and cous cous salad which is great and the Chicken and Gorgonzola salad which is also very good.  The reason they did not get 5 stars is because sometimes their service is pretty slow... i have a feeling this is due to the lunch rush."}
{"text":"Yum this place was good! Bunch of friends who live in town decided to try this place out with me while I was in town last. Had the burger since white american cheese was on the menu and it did not disappoint. The staff was friendly and took care of my preggers friends and one of their particularly needy husbands (sorry Ryan if you are reading this, but you know I love you, brah)  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Pork wings were deliciously amazing...a must try.  This week's market salad was excellent. Complimented the pork wings. Prompt friendly service too. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The Nello's \"market specials\" menu is fantastic, everything I've ordered is fresh and innovative and most importantly tastes fantastic!"}
{"text":"There's a reason they have been in business for well over 30 years. Nellos has a culture of excellence in service and great food. Love the pizza....thin dish is best and tasty salad and sandwiches. Happy hour is 3 to 6 and offers great deals on wine and drafts. My wife says don't the olives on the appetizer menu. It's a staple in our lives.....Nellos is the best!"}
{"text":"Our go to reliable pizza place! The atmosphere is casual, bustling and friendly. It is relatively easy to find at 48th St & Warner. There is lots of great specialty pizzas, awesome fresh salads, sandwiches and other house favorites. There are great handcrafted beers on tap including my fav, Fresh Squeezed from Deschutes."}
{"text":"Love, love, love Nellos! This location is definitely different from the rest, the servers are wonderful, they are always uber busy BUT seem to always slide you right on into a table with a very minimal wait if any at all.   It always looks worse than it is due to the take out counter I think.   The margarita pizza is the best!  Try it out you will be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Nello's pizza is near my house. I have eaten in the restaurant several times with my mom and have taken out some for to-gos. The staff is very nice and friendly. When I was waiting for to-go, they asked me if I wanted any drink or water for complimentary service.    When I ate in the restaurant, I ordered classic cheese pizza with thin crust, which was very delicious. I also ordered pasta which I thought was quite good.   Several times, I decided to go here because although it takes time, the pizza tastes great. The workers at my house ate the pizzas that I brought and they said it was great."}
{"text":"Eggplant parmigiana was excellent!  Perfectly cooked, sauce and cheeses were a delicious combination."}
{"text":"Mmmmm love Nello's!  Great lunch combo of a personal size pizza, salad and drink for $9.99. At dinner it gets very noisy so it's the perfect place to take your mother-in-law"}
{"text":"Nello's Pizza is in a word : amazing. Tucked away into a strip mall in Awahtukee you will find Nello's , usually busy and buzzing with people either waiting for the deliciousness of their pizza or pasta or market specials , OR at their bar while waiting for a table. Even the bar is fun with a great selection of beers, wines and sparking wines for me, yay! Happy Hour is 3-6pm. The staff is very friendly too. We have now been here twice and I'm a fan so much so that when my husband asked me this week where our 'cheat meal' was gonna be , I immediately thought of Nello's. Away we went. The patio is a great place now that it is fall. We have tried the Market Board of charcuterie and cheese and it's very tasty. Last night we had the Calamari & Rock Shrimp as a starter ... we didn't care too much for the sauce, which seemed like a watery vodka type sauce , so we asked for a marinara , which our server was happy to accommodate and brought it  warmed and it was out of this world. We ordered The European pizza for our meal. Twelve inches of perfection on a pizza pan: Homemade Sausage , ricotta , mozzerella, fontinella, Romano, basil, olive oil and tomato and that perfect sauce. We got it on the regular crust but thin and gluten free are also available. We also added prosciutto and artichoke hearts. One piece will fill you! The first time we were here on our 'eat out ; take out because we are closing on a house' binge! , we had the Deluxe Combo and got the 14 inch. We had leftovers for days! The combo is all about the original combination pizza , only Nello's makes it in an amazing way that is out of this world. The salads are enough for sharing too. That night we sat at the bar for a good 30 or so minutes waiting for a table but it was fun! It's a happening place for a strip mall tucked in like this .. who knew?! They have beers by the pack you can buy and carry out. I love a rose sparkling and they had that too! I'm a fan of Nello's ... a huge pizza loving fan!"}
{"text":"Love the Old World salad.   Add Garlic bread and some wine and you have a nice light meal."}
{"text":"This place by far has the best pizza I've tasted in a long time! Best part about it is that it's next to my work so great place to hangout during lunch."}
{"text":"This is my all-time favorite pizza and salad place. I don't live in AZ anymore so I rarely get to dine at Nello's  Get the original deeeep dish and a house salad with house dressing.  5-stars for Geno and Brian.  What a treat for me"}
{"text":"Such a great spot. Really great food. Beer selection is fantastic. Servers are always nice. And not overpriced at all. Definitely our favorite spot in the Tuke!"}
{"text":"I live in San Diego, but this place is always my first stop on my way home from the airport.    Do yourself a favor and buy a bottle of salad dressing to go.  It is good on everything."}
{"text":"Great pizza and good service! My \"Murphys\" pizza on wheat crust came with onions and bacon. It was very flavorful. I thought the wheat crust was delicious. It had a hardy, yet sweet flavor. The pizza was a perfect combination. I look forward to returning soon!"}
{"text":"It seems that their Thin Crust has changed and it has changed for GOOD. We ordered two thin crust this past weekend and they were perfectly crispy and thin and obviously the ingredients were on point."}
{"text":"We ordered a pizza for take out on a Sunday night.  They said it would be ready in fifteen minutes and when I got there it was already done.  The pizza was OK and definitely better than Domino's, even with their new spiffy recipe.    We got the veggie pizza, which sounded better than what we actually got.  The end product looked great, but I think maybe there are too many toppings for the crust to hold.  The crust ended up a little soggy, especially towards the center, and the sauce seemed to have been absorbed by the toppings save around the outside of the pizza.  Despite this, the pizza was edible and I'll probably order from them again at some point.  Instead of getting their veggie pizza, I'll probably pick my own toppings and simplify things a little.  Hopefully that will solve the soggy-no-sauciness problem."}
{"text":"Good pizza and salads. Great space and location. Good service. Patio is a nice option."}
{"text":"The food and drinks were so good! The atmosphere was nice so happy we will be living near here!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended to us by several locals. Nello's lived up to its legend, we heard they make fresh dough and homemade sauce. They have delicious appetizers. The pizza was one of the best we've ever had! We ordered the bruschetta appetizer which were fresh and crafted nicely. The Antipasto salad is tossed in House Italian dressing, which was delightful. We would recommend this place to anyone looking for a good Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Simply the best!  Try the wood fire pizza and the chopped chicken salad.  Love the service...Cody, Ray, Nicole, Kevin and the rest of the staff are always attentive and friendly.  Go get some!"}
{"text":"Andrew was my server and he brought a fun atmosphere to my dinner date, I forgot my card and he bought my meal and with a wink and a good heart I wasn't embarrassed in front of my now girl friend,  I still come back and I make sure to tip him extra well, great food great service!"}
{"text":"The food is always good here.  The service is too.  Smoked salmon salad is to die for!  Pizzas are perfect and cold draft beer!  Coffee wasn't hot on Valentine's weekend. Kent, server did a fine job."}
{"text":"After many visits our favs are: old world salad and classic european pizza.  Also love the pastas.  Sandwiches are tasty as well."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite restaurant in Ahwatukee. Service is exceptional and the food is splendid. Also, it is the best happy hour in town. Daily from 3-6 pm, you can get premium beers for $3 and cheap apps!"}
{"text":"The place was packed and I think it is because they have amazing pizza.  I had the Classic European pizza and fell in love.  I don't live close by and I do not mind driving out of my way to get it.  If you do not mind the crowds then I would suggest going here.  Lunches may be less crowded?"}
{"text":"Great Service.   Amazing Pizzas."}
{"text":"Deep dish pizza was pretty good but not the best ever. I really liked the arugula couscous salad, so will definitely be back for that!"}
{"text":"A friend and I chose Nello's because it is a casual neighborhood eatery with really good food.  We were not disappointed.  We each had a \"small\" Caesar salad.  The portion was extremely generous, and the taste was excellent.  There were plenty of croutons, lots of fresh grated parmesan cheese on top of crisp greens with just the right amount of tangy dressing.  Good choice.  I had the Crema Americana with Italian sausage.  It was absolutely delicious. You can tell the pasta is made fresh, and it makes such a difference.  The bechamel sauce was creamy but not heavy.  The sausage added a nice bit of zing.  My friend ordered the Pomodoro Maiale with chicken added.  He cleaned his plate, and declared the dish a winner that he would definitely order again.  He also commented on the fresh pasta, adding that the bacon and cheese in the tomato sauce made it a an excellent topping for the pasta.  Our server was Zac, and he took excellent care of us.  Right there when we needed him, but not intrusive.  He was well schooled on the menu, and made sure to let us know we were in Happy Hour if we wanted to order anything from that menu.  All in all, an excellent experience.  So nice to have a place like this so close to home."}
{"text":"Nellos is my local neighborhood pizza restaurant / bar.  It has a nice atmosphere and pretty good pizza.  They have nice patio out back when the weather is nice too.  While it is not my favorite pizza in the area, I keep coming back for the excellent customer service and ambiance."}
{"text":"The food here is always amaze and the wine list is wonderful. I've come here for years since it opened in Ahwatukee and over the years the menu has gotten better and the service has gotten worse. Every time we come we hope we'll get get good service and we don't. We sit and wait for a check in after we receive our food, no refills on drinks or clearing empty plates. They don't up sell in any way, if you want dessert or another glass of wine or beer, good luck. We keep coming because it's a family favorite for many years but ugh it's always a disappointment in some way. Such a bummer."}
{"text":"Great carry out for a fast healthy salad....that is if you don't drink the honey mustard dressing before it goes on the salad.  We carry out at least twice a month from here.  The thin crust wood fired pizza is excellent.  We have been long time customer when there was no YELP only one Nello's location and I had to walk to school backwards in the snow in Phoenix. OK, so a trip down memory lane over ...back to the review.  Before YELP  the Phoenix NEW TIMES BEST OF was where the public spoke and yep they won my vote!  It is nice to come a long way...."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza with incredible flavor!! Also the place was very clean and the atmosphere was awesome. Had a cannoli for dessert too which was delicious"}
{"text":"Stopped in the Friday after Thanksgiving. The wife and I were driving aimlessly looking for something new in Ahwatukee ( Been there done that before), when we happened upon Nello's. Nice atmosphere, great service and a surprisingly good dining experience awaited. We didn't want to fill up after the previous days eating frenzy so we shared an Antipasto Salad that was, like the menu stated more than enough for 2. Also ordered a mozzarella plate with veggies and tomatoes and olives and some nice crusted bread. Could not be happier. They have a wide selection of beers, of which I enjoyed a few pints. Thank you Nellos for a nice evening with my better half. We will be back."}
{"text":"Service has always been amazing. From time to time it may get busy and it can be a little slow but that can be expected anywhere and it doesn't bother me much if the waiter or waitress are nice!  The Pizza is awesome and Salad are amazing. It's now one of my favorite places to go for Pizza."}
{"text":"I have this taste in my mouth of what a margherita pizza should taste like.  I've been in search of it for years. Sadly, this place did not measure up to what I had in mind but it was still delicious pizza.  Everything taste fresh, the sauce, the dough, the toppings, yum!    I've been here twice, once for lunch and another time for a takeout order.  Everything went smoothly on the take out order, while I waited I got to see the kitchen staff in action, they really work hard!  When I came in for a sit down meal, the food and service were great.  It did take a long time to get our food though so I don't recommend coming here for lunch if you're on a time crunch.  They get very busy."}
{"text":"Great gluten free pizza options and very attentive service.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I've lived in the valley (tempe) since 2002 and have always heard great things about nello's. It took me 13 years to get there, but I was very pleased. The patio was large and we were seated outside without a wait. We had wine, salad and pizza and all were very good. I will return soon."}
{"text":"After hearing about this place and them having award winning pizza I was pretty hyped coming to this place. Living only a mile away, why not, right? I took my gf and it was just a leisure thursday, not alot of people there. The waitress was nice and we were seated right away, ordered the Hawaiin style pizza...  I completely understand ordering good food and expecting to wait for it, but this was OUTRAGEOUS!! It nearly took a hour to cook this pizza - I personally saw the people who came in at the same time as us - enjoy their pizza and leave!?!   When the pizza arrived it sure didn't look properly cooked nor enticing. But I never judge a book by its cover...   so we dug in... considering all the hype I've heard about  this I expected better. Sadly I prefered pizza hut over this place that day."}
{"text":"The nearby Zip's has hit Nello's business very hard. Nello's was pretty empty between 5 and 6 pm but then started to get a little busy as we left around 6:15. The crowd is a shadow of Nello's pre-Zip's throng. But this is all a good thing for diners, because Nello's food, beer, and service are as solid as ever. Pizzas are wonderful and beer selections nice. They even had Deschutes Fresh Squeezed IPA. Keep it up guys. Zip's is a blah place and loyal Nello's diners will surely be back."}
{"text":"Pizza is good. Service not so good. Lastest episode... We ordered ahead and arrived on time for pick up.  They took my money and said \"5 minutes\".  I saw a steady stream of pickups after me. 25 minutes later it was obvious that they had forgot my order.  No apology, nothing.  I asked to see a Manager and the register girl just rolled her eyes.  I had family and kids waiting in the car and had no explanation.  It was obvious this was going to take a while.  I went on my own in the restaurant to find a manager and the takeout girl ran up and stood between me and the manager and talked over me. I left in disgust. Pizza is good if you can stomach the service."}
{"text":"I grew up around the corner from this place so it's kinda my neighborhood pizza spot. I've only had the pizza and salads but everything I've seen come out of that kitchen looks amazing!  Nello's is really known for their deep dish pizza and its my absolute favorite. We order a ton of toppings and its always the perfect ratio for a balanced pizza. I've only come in for pickup so I can't speak to service eating there, but I'm always immediately greeted by someone when I walk in to pickup.   The salads are all well done and my favorite is the chicken gorgonzola salad with their house raspberry vinaigrette dressing.  I haven't had one I didn't like. They also have great tvs and I'd def come in for a game. If you live close, walk down to Nellie's. I love this neighborhood and this place!"}
{"text":"It has been over 1 year since I have been back and the pizza was so good, why did I wait that long????  Four cheese thin pizza!  OMG!!!!  It is cooked (or baked) to perfection.  I literally could not stop eating it.  Nom, nom, nom....  I did share with Lou, she liked it too!  The place is nice, clean, open, and bright.  The service is always great!!!"}
{"text":"Nello's is pretty darn wonderful - more than a strict sauce slicked pie joint in that some of their creations are pushing the culinary envelope.  I've actually Googled some of their specialty toppings at the table to figure out what they are, the cheeses so specific to regions around the world that you'll want to learn more on why they are notable.  Original crust is thick and buttery, yielding heavy toppings and tender strands of mozzarella.  I'm a big fan of the Schriers pepperoni on a margherita pizza, laden with fresh garlic and torn basil.  Salads are hearty and plentiful, with a killer Spinach Salad (crisp bacon, egg, crunchy radishes and grape tomatoes) and White Balsamic Dressing.  Waitstaff at this location are bustling while still managing to be endearing.  Service can get spotty on weekends when the place crowds a bit, but on two separate occasions where mistakes were made, the manager corrected both immediately with not only no charges for the items but still sending the ordered items.  We've actually left with two pizzas in hand - totally unasked for but very appreciated.  I don't really compare the pizza here to other thin-crust pies - it's so specific of a taste, it's almost its own thing.  That all being said, it's such a yummy experience, if you don't pigeonhole the pizza, you are in for a treat."}
{"text":"Seriously darn good pizza and the best service humanly possible."}
{"text":"I used to live in The Tuk ( Ahwatukee) and missed Nello's. The tomato cheese bread was as good as I remembered. We got a side marinara to dip it in and it is well worth the side charge for it. Although they are known for their pizzas don't overlook the sandwiches and salads. I had the parlor burger. I got a medium it was so juicy and delicious and for my toppings I chose bacon, sautéed mushrooms, and their homemade mozzarella cheese. It was fantastic! The fries were not the hottest temp so they loose some zing, but that happens everywhere. The food runner dropped a cup of ketchup and it landed in the lap of the guest across from me. Some hit my shirt and there was a little bit tension but we laughed it off because the food was delicious. The tiramisu was good. I like it soggier but they are consistent.  The only bad part. After the ketchup incident hitting over 66% of the people at the table no one came by to see if we were OK or ask if they could do anything for us. The food runner gave us a bunch of napkins but that was it. I'm guessing the food runner didn't tell the server or a manager. I only rate places on food, not service so they still got 4 stars."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Nello's. Never had a bad experience. The food is always good, the service very friendly and knowledgeable, and the prices are reasonable. The problem is that my husand never wants to go there. He says that there are other pizza places that he (and admitedly, I too) prefers so we often skip it, even though it is just down the street. Panninis and salads are very good, in addition to their pizza, btw."}
{"text":"we have been going to Nellos Pizza for years.. went there again the other night and find the food so consistent and really good Pizza- wanted to brag about it.... we like the regular crust and so good.  The salad is so much to try-- even the 1/2 size we end up taking it home for the next day!  Great happy hour pricing... and delicious.."}
{"text":"Nellos Ahwatukee, Stopped in after a hard day, and got a pizza to go. One of the most tasteless pizzas I have eaten, (ate only one slice). Asked my wife how hers was, she said eh. Have eaten here before. As I recall, it was much better.  I could've gotten more flovor from Dominos, or Pizza Hut, although the flavors not good, at least, you got flavor. Noticed alot of people got various toppings, I didn't. I think if you get a good pizza,it should taste good plain, to start with, then add toppings. If it dosen't, the pizza's goin to be mediocre at best. Try Florencias on Ray Rd. much much better, regardless of toppings."}
{"text":"Nello's, You never fail us. The hostess always greets us enthusiastically with a smile. The servers are prompt and attentive. The food is consistently delicious. The feeling you get at this location is very close knit and neighborly. Well done and thank you. It is hard to find places where you feel the money you spend on a dinner out is really worth it. It is always worth it with you."}
{"text":"Went here for a quick meal before an appointment. Seated by the hostess, no server or manager acknowledged me within the give minutes I was there. I walked out, plain and simple. Nice to see the continual decline of good food and service in restaurants. I'll never return here. Thanks Nello's!!!"}
{"text":"Ahhh yes! Nellos the unofficial pizza joint of Tukee. Totally worth spending the extra few dollars to get a pie here as opposed to one of those chain \"pizza\" joints. The service here is always friendly and the food is obviously delicious. Be sure to stop by for the deliciousness!"}
{"text":"This is some of the best pizza I have ever had! We had the Delux Combo. The meats in the pizza were what made the pizza amazing. They had that spicy Italian taste to it. This was complimented nicely by the the thick cheese and fantastic dough. I can't wait to try their other pizzas!"}
{"text":"Anticipating the pizza craving that I always get after happy hour I'm going to pre-order a 10\" original deep dish, mushrooms, spinach, and homemade sausage from the nearby Nellos for tonight.  Nellos crust, on any occasion, is one of my favorites. There's something magical about it. The bottom of the crust is just firm and thick enough to withstand the weight of the fresh and flavorful toppings. The combination of the bottom of the crust and the fresh and homemade toppings is just the beginning.   The edge of the crust steals the show. The light and dark gold color's of the edge draws you in right away. Each bite starts off crunchy to the tooth and ends with a soft and chewy melt in your mouth dough. The crust is a big component on why their pizza is so delicious.  I've only been to their Ahwatukee location but I'm sure the other locations are just as good. Their pizzas and their tiramisu are worth 4-5 stars but everything else on their menu is just ok. But who needs to try anything else when you have crust like they do."}
{"text":"Sometimes the lunch rush can get a little hectic however the house salad dressing makes it worth sitting thru the noise.   Recommend going during lunch and ordering the salad/pizza special.  Delicious and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"It's was really good! We got the Margarita Pizza, but instead of the thin crust, we got the thick regular one. It was super good. My sister also go the baked Zetti, and a house salad. Also super good."}
{"text":"I love pizza and this is not bad but overrated to me.  My friend from Boston she loves this pie because they cut it into squares and it reminds her of pie from a chain back in Beantown.  I think it is just ok.  Kind of bland, a little pricey.  Good for out here I guess, but not really that good."}
{"text":"Best salad in the world: chicken chopped Gorgonzola, white balsamic dressing is out of this world."}
{"text":"The pizza is excellent and the service also! The only con is the wine per glass is overpriced in my opinion and based on other places! Pizza and a couple glasses of wine will set you back about 75!! I can purchase a bottle at a pizza restaurant for half the cost, !"}
{"text":"We ate there Sunday Sept.6th, around 7:30pm. They were out of deep dish crust, so we were only able to get one of two pizza's deep dish style. Service was good and food did come out in a timely manner.  For desert they only had canole's and brownie ice cream. How can they not have Cheese cake for which they are well known for, or any other choices.  Needless to say after spending over $230 including the mandatory 20% tip for a party of 16, (which i had no problem, as the service was good) we were very disapointed with the lack of food selections.  I don't know if it was the large party, sunday night, or that it was a holiday weekend As my wife and i recommended it, we won't make that same mistake next time. Nello's you really let me down."}
{"text":"Good place.  90% of the time service is there, but sometimes you get the grumpy teenager or you college kid.  Food is good and atmosphere is good.  Also, the house dressing is bomb."}
{"text":"Chicken Parmesan sandwich with side salad was great. Take out gal waiting on me super sweet.  I visited on 8/24 at dinner time."}
{"text":"Recently I needed to provide a quick pizza meal for a group in an area where I wasn't familiar with the options. I asked my group's members for suggestions, and Nello's Pizza was the answer I got more than any other. So I decided to give it a try. I ordered a couple pizzas for pick-up. I got a list lost on the way (it's in Ahwatukee, even though the address is Phoenix), but when I called the person who answered pleasantly and calmly directed me there. When I arrived the pizzas were ready to go. I paid and headed on my way. They had these cute little boxes that were round (or maybe the better word is geometric) on the inside and square on the outside for ease of handling/less waste (my best guesses). The smell in my car as I drove to my event was HEAVENLY! It was all I could do not to pull over and break out the pizza myself! Once I arrived at my destination and dug into a slice of the Classic European pizza (14\" original crust) I was in truly in HEAVEN! It did not disappoint. I had two slices and ended up wanting more. I also ordered a wheat-crust 14\" Four Cheese pizza. We had about 12 people, and let me tell you, every slice was gone in less than a half hour! I will definitely go there again and maybe eat in this time; they had a nice dining area and covered, misted patio too. Thanks, Nello's!"}
{"text":"I've lived in Phoenix for a year and have yet to find a pizza place worth talking about (I'm from Chicago...nothing compares).  I decided to give this place a try last night.  It was delicious!  I loved the atmosphere...had an upscale-ish décor but not too yuppie to make you feel uncomfortable for wearing jeans (our server had on a black tee shirt and a baseball cap.  The server was very personable, we never had empty drinks, and knew his way around the menu, which was great, as we had never been there before.  We got the Caprese for an app, and since my bf and I have opposite tastes in pizza, we each ordered our own so we could get what we wanted and have leftovers.  We could tell it was starting to get really busy, and a line was forming out the door, but the server made sure to stop by often, and not make us feel rushed as we sat for a few minutes finishing our beers.  Their ingredients were fresh and more than you can get at most pizza places (an awesome variety of cheeses to choose from, and everything from regular veggies to shrimp or salmon!).  For 2 people our bill ran just under $60, which was totally reasonable for an app, drinks, and 2 pizzas.  I will definitely be returning and recommending to my friends!"}
{"text":"Delicious again.  We always order the Fritto Misto + side of their housemade marinara.   This mixture of calamari & rock shrimp is delicious and the marinara is IMHO much better for dipping than the sauce that comes with the dish.     This time we ordered the 14\" original crust Classic European pizza add meatball (DO THIS!).  Turns out meatball was a fantastic choice and really augmented the rich flavor of this already-delicious pizza.    We also ordered the 12\" thin crust Wood Fired Yukon Gold + egg pizza to try something new.  It was good but I'd like it better if the whole thing had egg on it instead of just the center.   Kind of reminded us of breakfast.  Glad we tried it but will probably go back to our favorite Pavone Pepperoni again next time.   One daughter ordered an 8\" Pesto Bianca pizza as well.  She let me have a piece and I'll say it was really, really good.  That pesto and the sundried tomato they put on there is really tasty!   I'd order this again but watch out for those nut allergies - the pesto is walnut based.    Another satisfying visit to Nello's!"}
{"text":"I had the BEST experience at Nello's this past weekend.  I have been coming to this location for a while, and finally got around to writing a review.  The menu has some similar  items to the sister restaurant \"The Parlor\" which is a good thing.  the staff is on top of things and we got a great wine recommendation from Cody.  This is my go-to place when I have guests in town for an all around great dining experience.  Don't forget to try the chopped chicken salad, it is amazing!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best pizza sauce in the entire valley - which makes for the best pizza and meatball subs. What more to say? This is my favorite pizza joint."}
{"text":"Love this joint; come here frequently. The service is always good, the pizza is awesome, and their house dressing is the best salad dressing in the history of the world. Definitely one of the best spots in Ahwatukee. Oh, and they have beer."}
{"text":"This is the only pizza place I will dine in or order take out from. I'm very picky about what I eat; a total food snob. I love their pizza! I always order their pepperoni and mushroom deep dish pizza!! The servers are always friendly and the prices are very reasonable. You can't go wrong here, everything is good!"}
{"text":"I eat here pretty much weekly.  The pizzas are awesome (especially the wood fired ones) and the rest of the menu is no different.  The salads are awesome and large, the bruschetta is solid, and the tiramisu...oh, the tiramisu.  Save room for it.  The beer selection is great and if you're in the neighborhood during happy hour, make sure to stop in.  There are some great deals (1/2 off apps, cheap drinks)."}
{"text":"Nice evening out with family.  Restaurant was busy yet we were seated right away.  Drinks were prompt.  Server was excellent.    Took a little while for kids food, but not too long.  Pizza was good.  Sauce is original and delicious.  Burger was good with quality meat.  Bruschetta was tasty, but a little thick on the artichoke.  Nice bar, nice atmosphere, and a great patio for cooler months."}
{"text":"The wood fired pizzas are amazing. The Yukon Gold (get the the egg!) is the best specialty pizza I've ever had the pleasure of consuming.  After weeks of ordering the pizzas this week we opted for the pasta, Bolognese, and it was worth it. Delicious. Sadly the portion was small - and it would have been way better with some bread - but nonetheless a five star dish. The market brisket salad is soooo good. You won't regret it. You get what you pay for here. It's worth every penny."}
{"text":"Met a group of people...great craft beer selection.. ordered Old World Salad w/House Dressing, excellent.. enough to feed 2-4 people.. then the Murphy pizza.. applewood smoked bacon and onions w/the thin crust, wood fired. This is an awesome pizza. The rest of the group got various  pizzas and loved everything! Our waitress was great, and took good care of us.."}
{"text":"Tried Nello's for first time tonight & definitely not impressed... cheese pizza way too salty and at room temp cheese hard and looked like plastic.  Ate one piece and threw the rest out."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat Lunch. Attentive staff, Great Salads and also a individual sized Pizza with salad and drink....great food at a really good price."}
{"text":"Ok, I am adding this review as I wait on a box for my leftover \"average\" pizza. The gal went off to get it about 10 minutes ago and I can see her over talking to her male co workers. Pizza is average at beast and the help is undicciplined and obviously unmanaged. You may be thinking to yourself that they may be busy..... Not a bit, 9 tables in the place have customers. What a bummer."}
{"text":"Great deep dish Chicago-style pizza, wonderful fresh salads and a great atmosphere make Nello's a local staple pizzeria. Staff is friendly, prices are right, and you can take advantage of M-F lunch special - $10 for a mini 2-topping pizza, salad, and large drink. It's a lot of food for a great price. This place is very kid friendly as well - they have a nice kid's menu with plenty of options, or they can simply eat of your order!"}
{"text":"I have been a fan of Nellos for about 5 years now. The pizza is phenomenal, their draft beer selection is great and they have Rombauer every so often (which is one of my favorite vineyards). I also love their entrees, especially the lasagna. I no longer live in the Ahwatukee area but I make it a point to go back for Nellos!"}
{"text":"6/15/10 Friend and I ordered take-out: an Arugula salmon couscous salad and a small Four cheese (mozz, romano, fontinella, and feta).  I believe I also requested ricotta on it.  The salad was excellent, although I wished all of the ingredients used were listed on the menu- I had to fish out a couple of troublesome items.  The pizza was fantastic!  And this was after we let it sit for awhile.  (I love my thin-crust pizzas hot, very crispy and fresh-- not cold nor stale, and if it's the least bit soggy, I am heartbroken.)  But Nello's was definitely a hit tonight!  I kicked myself for waiting all this time to go back for another taste.  I'll be returning VERY soon!  Music accompaniment: Dionne Warwick: The Definitive Collection."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Check out the Chicken Gorgonzola tossed salad.  The thin crust European Pizza is amazing.  The staff is always efficient.  I highly recommend this Nello's!!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I have never eaten here before, the food is amazing! We had the eggplant bruschetta, spinach salad with bacon and the spinach pizza pie. The bacon on the salad was the whole strips of perfect bacon, totally delicious. The sauce on the pizza was nice, and the crust was nice and crunchy. Service was great as well. I will be going back soon to try more of the huge selection."}
{"text":"Great place, the food and wait staff are great. You can tell they really work hard and focus on producing a great meal. Haven't been disappointed in all the years I've been going besides having to wait for a table every once in awhile. Their specials are great and complex, I really can't say enough."}
{"text":"Service is always great. Super fun environment with a lot of regulars. The employees also have a lot of knowledge about menu items."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying my Turkey Pesto Panini was fabulous!  We were greeted and seated immediately upon entering the restaurant because it wasn't a busy time.  Unfortunately the kitchen must have been a different story because it took quite some time for our order to arrive.  My panini, a burger, and a kids pasta with butter - nothing complicated.  So that was disappointing.  Our server Tre was attentive and friendly and the dining room is nicely decorated, clean and spacious."}
{"text":"My family and I are new to the area, having moved to Phoenix from NY state. We were craving pizza and gave Nellos a try. We had their large deep dish pepperoni pizza and antipasto salad. It was ready quickly and tasted great! We could tell they used really good ingredients in their food. We will definitely order again!"}
{"text":"The food and service are always good at Nello's. We always make one or two trips here when in town for business. Can't go wrong with the antipasto or any of the thin crust pizzas."}
{"text":"The service was great. The atmosphere was wonderful. I ordered garden salad with house dressing and it was fresh. I ate pizza Margarita and classic European and both were awesome. Ask for Alfredo sauce deeping to finish your pizza crush. Last treat was a tiramisu. This one, I considered good but ok... Overall, I would like to go back to try something else."}
{"text":"Happy Hour is the best! $3 drafts and cheap appetizers. We ordered way too much food here and had to take a fair amount home (which made delicious leftovers). For $1, we got roasted olives in a bowl...I could've eaten that all night long. We also got Cheesy Garlic Bread. For entrees we tried the pesto pasta with meatballs, and the Fungji & Formaggio pizza. Everything we ate was delicious! And it was just as good the next day!  The service was great - our server was knowledgeable about the food and helped us get creative in our pasta choice!"}
{"text":"I hadn't heard of Nello's until recently and it is now my favorite restaurant in the valley! Awesome pizza and the house dressing is equally as good. Great service most of the time and I need to try their happy hour soon."}
{"text":"Never heard of pork wings until tonight! They are amazing! My brother ordered the parlor burger which is always great! Our server Reggie was on top of it! Highly recommend nellos to anyone new to the area!"}
{"text":"I just moved to ahwatukee recently and ate here with my husband yesterday for the first time. We ordered a small pizza with bacon , delish! And baked ziti . They have huge portions so we had alot of food left over. But very very good. We will def come back again."}
{"text":"Great pizza fresh ingredients.   The pineapple is the best pineapple ever.  Home made salad dressings.  Never disappointed!"}
{"text":"Well, everbody was thinking of pizza, ordered pizza and salad today. Pizza was good but they forgot put bacon in salad."}
{"text":"Love the pizza, not the new management.   We have been going to Nello's for years and they have always given us excellent food and service. However they have recently brought in new management and the ambiance isn't what it used to be. We used to rave about their food and service to all our friends but now it seems like employees are scared of getting in trouble for not charging me for my side of ranch."}
{"text":"After all the rants and raves I have heard about Nellos, I was sadly disappointed. This place had been made out to be one of the best pizza places in Ahwatukee. I started off the meal with a basic dinner salad with the house dressing and ordered a veggie thin crust pizza. The dressing is delicious, and I would definitely consider buying a bottle of it to keep at home.However as our pizza arrived, I saw the first hint that this pizza place was not going to live up to its reputation. First of all, I ordered a thin crust pizza, however, my pizza looked as if it was just regular crust. The pizza itself wasn't bad- fresh ingredients, good amount of cheese and toppings, but the sauce could use a little more basil or oregano. I was thoroughly unimpressed. My boyfriend ordered a deep dish pizza, and suffice to say, it wasn't really deep dish. It looked like regular pizza just with super high pizza crust walls. The topping and the flavors were good, but the deep dish pizza wasn't really filled enough to be considered deep dish.  The food simply just didn't live up to countless good reviews I had heard about it before."}
{"text":"I wish this place wasn't so far! I try to make a special visit when I'm in the general vicinity because I am obsessed with their food.  I'm not too thrilled with their happy hour food menu but their regular menu is priced fairly so it's no issue there.  I usually get the turkey pesto panini which comes with cranberries inside. Delicious. They have good fries here too, so I get that as my side.  Their thin crust pizza is NOT thin, it's very regular to thick. If you want thin crust, order the gluten free. I know sometimes gluten free items can taste a little funny - but not this! It's really good.  FYI - they are closed on Mondays."}
{"text":"Good food - fresh and interesting local market pizzas.  Great beer selection."}
{"text":"The pizza here, in my opinion, is pretty average compared to other pizzas around the Valley, though they do get bonus points for smoky crusts and fresh ingredients.    What bumps this place from three to four stars for me is the spinach salad with the house dressing.  It is, by far, one of the best salads I've ever had in these great States.  Strips of applewood smoked bacon.  Need I say more?"}
{"text":"I am reminded of what a really good pizza is supposed to taste like whenever we pop in here.   Tonight we had a market salad with kale/berries/nuts which was really delicious.  This evening's special pizza was a real treat....homemade sausage with balsamic reduction drizzle, then topped with pepperoni and other fantastically fresh ingredients.  Very accommodating staff who provide excellent service and even turned the heaters on for us - the only diners on the patio (for awhile). Love this family restaurant who serves fresh, tasty food."}
{"text":"Numero Uno Pizza with a whole wheat crust  is my fave Nellos Pizza... had it for my Bday tonight!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the grinder panini being a fan of Italian deli meats.  First off, it wasn't even a panini. It was a cold sub. It was okay, very heavy on the vinegar for my taste but not a bad sandwich. I've been told just to stick with the pizza here and avoid the rest of the menu. I do want to note that the server had asked me what I wanted for my side, so I picked the salad, assuming it was included. Come to find out when I got the bill it was an add-on I was being charged extra for. So after tax, tip and drink it was almost a $20 lunch for an okay sandwich. I'll try some other places around here."}
{"text":"Great wood fired pizza. Good service cold beer. Had the spinach salad with house dressing.  Great split three ways."}
{"text":"This has been one of our favorite restaurants for 25 years. Everything on the menu is delicious and the prices are reasonable.  Almost everything is made on-site. All Nellos locations are good (including the Parlor in Phoenix) but this is our favorite location."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever. Great employees. The salads are awesome. Say hi to the staff. Michael Hitzel is the best."}
{"text":"The pizza was tasty and fresh, the service was great. We brought a child here that we were babysitting and he loved his food. He's 7 and enjoyed a kids pizza."}
{"text":"A favorite of mine. I had discovered Nello's back when I lived in Ahwatukee during my college days. I would dine in and take out. It was that good. The atmosphere is great. The service is great. The food is great.   I dropped in there today, for old times sake, and it was still just as good. I had the lunch special which was a house salad with their signature tomato basil based vinagrette, an 8\" pizza with homemade sausage and mushrooms, and a Diet Coke. All for $9.95! What a deal!  If you want quality pizza, go to Nello's."}
{"text":"Been going to Nello's for years, but after last night, I'm taking some time off and spending my pizza $ elsewhere.  Not crowded, table for 3 in the bar....2 entrees came out quickly while I waited for a woodfired pizza.  My wife's salad was missing the pancetta as advertised.  My pizza finally arrived but was made incorrectly...I was told no problem, we'll make another one....waited, waited and bingo ANOTHER wrong pizza - this time it wasn't even close. After 2 hours I asked for the check and I'm gone.  Nello's get it together please and do something about your pizza dough - it's like cardboard lately.  Headed to Florencia for a while....and so is my $."}
{"text":"Nello's Pizza in Ahwatukee....sometimes very crowded, but always worth the wait.  I cannot speak for the rest of the menu, but I can say that any kind of pizza you order here is going to be excellent.  We have been enjoying Nello's for years and have never had a bad or questionable pie.  Nello's offers a pretty good selection of beers...and there are usually a couple of rotating taps that pour local craft favorites.  The atmosphere is typically bustling, oftentimes loud inside during rush hours...which is probably why we enjoy coming here when we are dining with our kids.  I'd definitely recommend Nello's and often bring out of town visitors in for a pie.  It's close by too, which is an added convenience."}
{"text":"Fantastic services by Mary Anne. Made my family feel  like we've becoming there for years. \"This was our first time\".food was amazing high quality products and ingredients."}
{"text":"I really like Nellos Pizza. Their pizza is very good, but it doesn't stop there. I love their Pork Wings that are smoothered in a house mustard based buffalo sause. They have excellent tossed salads and tasty appatizers. Nice ambiance with a clean, nice, simple, Italian decor. Great place to grab dinner and a drink with family and friends."}
{"text":"Even though Nellos's Pizza is close to my home and a Phoenix favorite, I never go there. I'm a Pizza Hut fan, but they closed the location near me, so I called Nello's for a carryout. Ordered an 8\" pizza with pepperoni and pineapple (don't judge me) for $7. Got there and they opened the box to show me the pizza, cut into quarters. There were (count 'em) eight tiny pieces of pineapple (that's two per slice) and the big fat puffy crust comprised 1/3 of the entire pizza. No kidding! It was so bizarre-looking that should have taken a pic. But no worries, I thought....I like crust and they gave me a side of pineapple. Well, it was the WORST pizza I've ever eaten. Totally flavorless. Lesson learned. Back to Pizza Hut I go, even if it means driving five miles to the nearest location. I hate wasting money on bad food!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Antipasto salad and a glass of red wine is my favorite meal. Everything from the pizza, salads and sandwiches are amazing. I'm the biggest Arnold Palmer drink fan and this place just knows how to serve it. The staff is always friendly and will go above to make sure your visit is great. Out of the 500+ restaurants in Phoenix, Nello's is my favorite. I call it, \"The Italian mother I never had restaurant.\" They are only open until 10pm so make sure you arrive early in the evening. If you want to continue drinking after dinner, Zipps is right next door!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and the food was enjoyable. Went on a busy Friday night and it seemed like the service and food preparation suffered a little. Staff was friends and helpful, just not as attentive as you'd like to see, even on a really busy evening. I may just be partial to the Tempe location on McClintock where I've loved the food since my high school lunch days, way back to '96. I think I'll head there next time I get that uniquely distinct Nello's pizza craving."}
{"text":"Nello's is the best!  Great local feel, great food, love this place.  You have to have:  (Gluten Free) Pizza, Garden Salad with Turkey and House Dressing.  It will soon be your go to feel good order."}
{"text":"I have to give props to Mo who works at this location of Nellos pizza. I came in today with a school group and she was amazing. She took care of us without hesitation and was great with the kids. Things can get a little messy with our bunch, but   she didn't seem to mind at all. The service was incredible. The food is nothing crazy special... Decent pizza, very tasty house salad dressing. Everything seemed fresh. I would recommend this restaurant and thank you again Mo!"}
{"text":"Pizza lovers & pasta lovers this the place for you. The service was good. Portions were large enough to share. My boys had burgers that were to die for."}
{"text":"We go here maybe once a month, the food and service never fails ! ALWAYS AMAZING!!!   One of my favorite places to go !"}
{"text":"Nellos pizza is very good and I'll order it from time to time but I come here for the pasta. It's so fresh and so delicious, I could eat two bowls if my stomach could fit it.  This is my favorite date night spot with my boyfriend. The ambiance is warm and the staff are very friendly. One of my favorite places!"}
{"text":"My family loves to eat at Nellos. The Happy Hour prices make dining out with kids easier on the budget and we've always had good to great customer service. The food clinches the five star review for me...always delicious and the Market options keep things interesting!"}
{"text":"Thin crust, deep dish, meat eaters, vegetarians, salads, pasta, microbrews........ Nellos excels with them all.   Spinach pie on thin is my favorite. Get thin crust  and eat more!!     Consistently good at all locations."}
{"text":"Great pizza, what else is there to say? Personally I've not ordered anything else there except pizza, but that's what I go there for in the first place.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here tonight but unlike most of the reviewers, we did not order pizza.  We started off with the eggplant bruchetta which was phenomenal.  My husband got the chicken pesto which he says was the best pesto he's ever had.  I ordered the lasagne which was also very good though I will say you really have to really like ricotta cheese in order to enjoy it.  This place has great food and service and I really love the fact that they have so many microbrews on tap and wines by the glass at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Market pizzas are always unique and amazing! I come here 1-2 times a week- it's our little neighborhood go-to. All of the food is delicious. We have tried everything on the menu and you won't be disappointed with each item! Home made pastas and pizza. Bruschetta is out of this world! Plus they have a great selection of wine and beer. Definitely should try this if you're looking for great food and great prices."}
