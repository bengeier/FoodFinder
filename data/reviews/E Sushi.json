{"text":"I went there for lunch time, sushi is fresh, thus good.  Not a big selection, but also not limited.  The Price is right, the place is big, bathrooms clean (this is a tell me how your kitchen is kinda thing).  Overall, a nice option for sushi in the area."}

{"text":"i was there last night, cause i needed 2 find a place to eat before going to a concert, now the place is pretty clean but nothing special, biggest issue was waiters lack of English which screwed our order cause we order 2 things they brought us 3. now i agree w/angela on the all u can eat b/c i was thinking of getting the $12 all u can eat but due 2 their lack of English. we didn't understand how it even worked( it said 6 per a order w.e that means ) over all the place is  c-ok not a-ok"}
