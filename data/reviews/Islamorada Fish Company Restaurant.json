{"text":"Went last night around 6 for he first time.  Had a good cocktail.  Food was OK; service was terrible.  Jess never said boo to us, just put the menus down, took our order, and walked away.  Never smiled once. We split the cranberry & blue cheese salad and fish & chips; both were good and ample for both us; therefore, good value for money.  However, we were disappointed at how slim and uninteresting the menu was.  Shopping at Bass Pro Outdoor World made it a fun evening."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the food is always excellent. I've had the shrimp scampi and the tilapia and both were delicious. They also give you sugar bread with your meal that is amazing! I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for seafood, this place never disappoints. Fast, friendly servers. Food is delicious! Rarely has super long wait times, which is nice."}
{"text":"My grandchildren thought the food was from McDonalds or some other place. They love sea food like steamers,crab,mussels and yes even oysters. So when a child is telling you this food taste bad what can you say. And yes both the wife and I will never eat there again just horrible. And after seeing a server drop a serving platter on the floor and just pick it up and put it back for serving food what more can I say"}
{"text":"I cannot understand the bad reviews of this restaurant!  We have eaten here maybe ten times and never had a bad experience. The servers are always friendly and helpful, even though they sometimes seem to be running to cover all their tables. The food has always been good. The bread they bring right away is marvelous. We have had several kinds of the the grilled fish and the signature Islamoralda sandwich in the past. Always good and servings large enough to take home half. Tonight we had the ribs, which were tender and meaty, and tilapia portofino, which came with three large shrimp and was very tasty. 

I would add that this might not be the best place for little kids or to order French fries. There's always McDonalds for that.

I'm just sorry we are in the area for only part of the year. I'd love to eat here all year long!"}
{"text":"Best thing about this place is the view. Unfortunately the food doesn't match up. Our calamari had to be sent back. Tasted like fried rubber bands. Coconut fried shrimp and grilled shrimp were small and also rubbery. Grilled mahi was dry. Crab cake quality was terrible and had an off taste. Fish and chips were just ok. Even the rice pilaf and veggies were bland and mushy. All in all this was the worst seafood in the valley. It really is too bad because this is a beautiful place. Enjoy the view just eat someplace else."}
{"text":"Very beautiful atmosphere service is a little a slow but food is delicious!"}
{"text":"Very good. Had the NY Strip w/ fries, 1 lb of Mussels & 1 1/2 lb snow crab w/ potatoes and corn on the cob. Oh, and key-lime pie for dessert. Good stuff. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"When I first went into the Bass Pro Shop Outdoor World in Mesa, AZ, I was surprised to see that there was a restaurant attached.

The first time my wife and I actually went into it was on a date night. We were going to the movies and had a wait until it started, so we walked down to Islamorada Fish Company and sat at the bar. We had a couple of drinks and the Ahi Tuna Wonton appetizer - it was all great! The bartender was friendly and helpful. The aquarium that serves as the wall of the bar is pretty amazing!

Since then, we have dined at the restaurant a number of times and have found the food to be consistently good and reasonably priced. This is one of the places we take our out-of-town guests! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Bad experience for my family and me. Maybe it was partially due to the day, and time of day that we dined (Sunday during the day). The kid's personal pizza was basically a slab of dough, with a TON of sauce, and a the smallest amount of cheese that I have ever seen on a cheese pizza. My entrée was awful and I could not finish it. My wife offered me a little bit of her bbq sandwich and it didn't taste fresh at all. The waitress was polite and the setting was certainly nice enough for a family outing, but the food that day was not good at all. I will not eat there again."}
{"text":"I normally never try to write a bad review but I had to for this place the only good thing i can say is the atmosphere was nice as far as the food as the service horrible.
First the food I had the \"Sportsman's Platter\" witch is Fried shrimp, catfish, alligator and fries. The Alligator was over cooked and very salty almost not worth eating the Catfish had no flavor at all the Fries were cold and hard the Shrimp were the only the that I could eat without being mad at excluding the fact the there were only two of them. Now The Services if you can call it that saw 8 Waiters standing around talking had to wait over 15 minutes for someone to come and ask us if we needed refills on drinks and they were not busy at all there were only two tables with people in the whole place and we were one one the tables and when she did bring the drinks she forgot one and never came back. We had empty plates on our table for over 15 minutes and when she asked if we were done instead of grabbing the plates she grabbed two cups and again never came back had to ask for our check or I would never got it."}
{"text":"Hidden gem next to Bass Pro Shop/outdoor world. Possibly the best smoked fish dip I've had and I have been to Islamorada FL. Nautical and Fish decor add to the atmosphere.  Don't expect Hugh crowd due to location. Caesar Salad was pretty good as well."}
{"text":"During our lunch on  12/22/2014 at the Islamorada Fish Company located inside the Bass Pro Shop in Mesa, Arizona, my husband and I witnessed a server carelessly and recklessly splash soda and ice cubes on to a man's face (as well as on to the bar) while he was eating his lunch.  The man reacted in telling the server it was BS, she loudly said I'm sorry in a huffy manner and ran off.  Shortly after her huffy dismissal, the manager \"Omar\" walked up to the man as if he was ready to start a fight with a SMILEY SMIRK on his face and ALL FULL OF ATTITUDE and told the CUSTOMER \"Why are you cussing out my girl\" the man told Omar he didn't cuss the server out and that he said it was BS that she had hit right next to his eye with ice and also splattered him with soda.  The \"MANAGER - Omar\" then threated the man that he was going to have him thrown out of the restaurant.  UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!!! This Person you made  a MANAGER doesn't know the first thing about managing anything!!!!!! He should have apologized profusely to the CUSTOMER and offered to buy his lunch instead of offering to have him thrown of the restaurant.  
 
    Bass Pro and its affiliates should look hard into their hiring practices, especially with whom they place in to a managerial position!!!!  Shame on you!!!!  After the manager left, I approached the gentleman and told him that my husband and I had witnessed the whole thing (another patron spoke up and said she had also witnessed it) and that even though we didn't know him that I was going to write a letter on his behalf.  He thanked us, paid his bill and left.  I am sure none of us will be in any hurry to patronize Islamorada Fish Company located inside Bass Pro Shop any time soon!!!!!"}
{"text":"So it was just a whim. I had been to this restaurant before several years ago. Fish is most always what we go for when my grown son and I meet for dinner. This was a disappointment to say the least. 

We ordered the calamari appetizer. While it looked great the rubber band texture of the squidlies was awful. Usually I select the calamari as a way to judge the over all culinary skill of the cooks. This was so bad I asked to have it removed from our bill. Our waitress was gracious and apologetic about taking care of this.

My son had the maple glazed salmon which he said was just okay. Looked a bit on the well done side which neither of us cares for. The asparagus was over cooked. Dunno why but I ordered the Monday Burger Special cooked medium rare with onion rings and Swiss cheese. It was cooked rare and the onion rings were a lot of onion skin not the actual onion its self. The fries were cooked well enough but had a musty taste of moldy potatoes. Not acceptable.

At some point our server mentioned that they were implementing their new menu tomorrow. Overall I suspect tomorrow's dinner would have been better. I wont know for sure. Probably wont go back"}
{"text":"THis place was awful! First the waitress took away the drink menu, asked if I wanted a drink and when I said yes but I needed a moment to decide she stated \"it just drinks!\".
Then I ordered a salad without croutons because I have an allergy and they gave me one with croutons.
Then I ordered the grilled salmon and it was delivered raw in the center.
I sent it back and instead of cooking me a new piece they recooked the broken up piece I had sent back, and re-gave it to me charred. I could only manage
two bites and didn't eat any of the rest of it. They charged us the whole 15/16$ for it.
NOT coming back ever.

The only reason they get 1 star instead of negative 2 is because their tropical hurricane was good."}
{"text":"Big Disappointment.........The setting and decor of the restaurant is nice. The food is lacking flavor and   and presentation.  The waitress we had was NOT pleasant and gave the vibe that she wished she was somewhere else. I asked for an upgrade on a side dish and she verified my order Twice to me and it came out completely wrong.When I informed her, she stated she would correct it.  She forget and I ate my meal without it until at the end she remembered and when I showed and stated my main course was done. She brought it out at the end. .... She didn't seem concerned or bothered by it. There was was what. I thought was a Manager,, big guy kinda overseeing the kitchen and watched her go to him.  But not once did a Manager come over.  Spent $100 there with my 2 adult kids and now they lost 3 customers. If you don't like your job both waitress and Manager,  get a new one and be happy. I still gave a tip because my children said she might have had a bad day. I won't ever visit this place again and not only will I not spend money there, I won't spend money at Bass Pro Shop . We were in the market for a $1300.00 rifle but think I'll go to Cabalas. I hope one of 3 things happen....The General Manager reaches out to me,because he/she can't fix an issue if it's not brought to his/her.... Bass Pro Shop see this is a reflection on their business and tries to correct it... or the waitress and Manager look into a job they enjoy because they apparently don't like working here.    If you want Good Service. Don't go here......."}
{"text":"The food was amazingly fresh.  I am originally from New England, so this was a gem in the desert! Never did I expect this restaurant to be inside the Bass Pro Shops. What an unexpected surprise.  The HUGE fish tank is total eye candy."}
{"text":"I love this place & its a special treat when we go here. We always order the exotic appetizers. The wait staff is attentive, prices are fair for exotic food thats hard to come by anywhere else."}
{"text":"absolutely love this place. Make sure you ask up front if their are any coupons or specials at the front door of bass pro shop. They have awesome fish and chips and a shrimp pasta dish that's amazing"}
{"text":"Uh... the place has a smell, let's just say that. My son's pizza was too floppy and too much sauce. He was a trooper and ate it... but it did not look good. My burger was... eh. But the whole place felt kind of greasy. And the smell, did I mention the smell... it... had a smell. It was kind of like an old movie theater... musty... disturbing kind of smell. We had fun hanging out and the service was okay but not real friendly. Is it too much to ask for a smile? We will definitely go back to the store, but we'll have have some barbecue next door maybe."}
{"text":"We usually stop in for a beer at the bar which has only ever lead to one thing - sharing a fried mahi mahi sandwich topped with grilled onions and cheese.  It's a nice flaky piece of fish and just enough for us to share with a side of fries and an added side salad. The service at the bar has always been fast and friendly."}
{"text":"My family and I came here twice to have lunch. Their garlic mussels and alligator starters were super yummy. My one year old daughter was entertained because of their big aquarium located in the restaurant. I ordered fish tacos on our first visit and I was surprised that it was huge! I'm used to california so effing small fish tacos! Second time, I ordered fish and chips and the fish was huge again! It looked like 4 whole breaded fish! I was like holy fish! Will be back again to try their dessert when we come back in Arizona."}
{"text":"I admit that my expectations were not to high, I consider this place a tourist trap because it is inside a BassPro Shop.  My expectations were meet flawlessly.  We had the alligator bites as an app.  They were just ok.  Some of the pieces were very greasy.  I was expecting them to be tough because I have eaten alligator before and it seems to always be tough, again I was not let down.  My wife had the Fish n Chips and I had the Catfish Po' Boy.  The Po' Boy lacked seasoning and flavor and was just unappetizing.  My wife's fish was also just ok.  The breading was a little thicker than we like and it to was greasy.  I know, I know...You're saying, \"It's deep fried, it's gonna be greasy.\"  However, there are ways to deep fry something and have it not come out greasy.  Anyway, I will continue to go to BassPro but I will take my appetite somewhere else.  Before I forget, the waitress we had was awesome and shame on me for not remembering her name.  I wish I could because she was great."}
{"text":"I have always wanted to try this location while at Bass Pro.

It is a nice little restaurant. Was almost empty when we were there. 

I ordered a Talapia (sp?) sandwich. It was filling and enjoyable.  But not great. 

Because we were there at \"lunch time\" we did not really look at the dinner menu or the full meal opportunities. 

The setting is a nice place. Clean. Nicely decorated. 

Not a place I would go to just for the food. But a place I would consider if at Bass Pro again and hungry."}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie, my first experience here when it first opened was horrifying. It was so bad, I put a post on a message board explaining in full exactly what made the experience as bad as it was. Much to my surprise, about a week later, I got a private message from the general manager of the location apologizing profusely and asking to speak with me. I then give my number  and he calls very shortly thereafter and again apologizes repeatedly and tells me he's gonna make it up to me by inviting my family and I back on them and told us to get anything on the menu we like. I told him the simple fact that he went through such measures to apologize was more than enough for me to overlook the horrendous first experience however he insisted so we took him up on the offer and found out the first experience wasn't at all an indicator of the restaurant. We have been back many times since then and are always treated with the utmost professionalism and respect. The food also is always good and the fish tank is a nice touch. What started poorly has turned quite well. Give them a shot! It's not the most inexpensive place to eat but it's also by far not the most expensive either."}
{"text":"Two visits and I am a fan! I have had the fish tacos and the fish and chips. They were both excellent and I would have them again and again. Both visit I also got the New England Chowder and it was very good. Very thick and flavorfull. The service was excellent both times. What I really like is the atmoshphere, there is a huge fire pit in the middle which I bet is awesome in the winter. You feel like you are in a hut and there are lots of big fish everywhere! Kinda corny but in a fun feel like you are in a cheesy vacation restaurant way. And I mean this in a good way. I love fish and chips and this is right up there with the best in AZ. The other amazing part...the bread they bring to the table. It is more like dessert! It has a sugar coating and is very good. We even bought some to bring home."}
{"text":"First time here. Nice menu selection, cool aquarium to watch while waiting for food. Nice big portions, burgers were good...not outstanding but very good. Fries come un-salted (wished all restaurants did this!)  Restauarnt was very clean, eclectic assortment of sportsfishing memorabilia. Nice job!"}
{"text":"Breakfast with Santa buffet.....    Two words..  FUCKING EMBARRASSING.    

We did this for the little one.  He was so excited to see Santa..  And Santa was great, really nice guy.  But the buffet, if you can even call it that was a joke..   Imagine about 20 people lined up to get Scrambled eggs from a carton, way under cooked hash browns previously frozen, bacon obviously precooked, sausage precooked barely warm and dry biscuits and waffles that were not there...  Yeah that is it about 6 choices of crappy food that about every free breakfast buffets at Hotels like Embassy suites or Residence inn beat without effort.   I am not joking, those FREE Hotel buffets beat this garbage..  I bet the premixed add water camping/hiking meals they sell in the camping section of Bass Pro Shops would have beat this shit..  It was fucking beyond TERRIBLE.  A new low for food in my life.
Then on top of that to make matters worse they had metal lids on all the food.  Yeah I am seriously not joking..  So you had to open the lid and see what special surprise was in store for you with 20 people behind you chomping at the bit for your ass to hurry up...  
Oh and it gets better, so I am sitting there and the one lady that is sitting people who doubles at the only waitress comes to the table with my coffee.  So I said you guys look a little overwhelmed.  And she explodes with her life history on how they are leaving her out to dry..  Right in front of the poor kid who just wants to see Santa...  My jaw hit the floor..  She was practically screaming how terrible they are treating her in this job...  I almost said something like hey we got little kids around here to see Santa, lets hold our composure..   But I felt her pain because this CLUSTER FUCK was obviously the soul responsibility of the restaurant manager, not her.  And she deserved to vent.

Total price with tax almost 40 bucks for 2 adults and one kid...   NOT JOKING once again..  

If I was the GM of Bass Pro Shops I would fire the sorry son of a bitch that is managing that restaurant ASAP....  Whoever it is shouldn't even be managing a hot dog stand...   Pathetic."}
{"text":"The two star rating if for the Fish N Chips.  I'm a bit of a snob when it comes to good fried fish.  These guys miss the mark badly by using a thick heavy breading that results in major grease and just an overall bad piece of fish.  Their tarter is loaded with too much dill and their cocktail sauce is bad as well.  The restaurant itself is very nice.  It's a Shame they don't do more business.  Simple improvements could help that in a big way..."}
{"text":"It was very much...meh.

I don't trust seafood in the desert to begin with anyway. We ordered the alligator appetizer...mostly so our kids could tell their kids they have eaten alligator. 

Now having spent 7 years living in South Florida, I have eaten some gator and done right it tastes good. You know, like chicken :)

This was not the case at Islamorada. It was rubbery and not even edible. When the waiter asked if we liked it (the plate was untouched with the exception of one bite I took and one my husband took) we told him it was terrible. I expected him to offer to take it off our bill, but that didn't happen.

The fish and fries were fine. My husband had a hamburger and said it was fine too. 

We ended up at Islamorada because after visiting Santa at the Bass Pro Shop they gave us kids eat free coupons. We gave them to the waiter but the kids meal were still on the bill. Didn't feel like arguing about it, so we left."}
{"text":"We were at the Bass Pro Shop so we decided to eat at their so the kids could check out the big fish tanks. Firstly, the decor in the restaurant is awesome. It's almost worth eating there just for that.. The food on the other hand.. It was okay.. Their bread is weird. It has sugar caked on the top.. Not really a fan of it. We had the Alligator and it was actually pretty tasty. I got the cajun pasta and it was pretty flavorless.. My wife got a salad and she said it was alright.. The prices were a little high, not really worth it for the food we got. We probably won't be back."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my worst restaurant experience ever. Came in for dinner on Friday night only a few people eating. So I figure there not busy. Was seated immediately waitress got our drinks right away but taking our order was a wait. And after that waiting for our food to come took longer. My kids got there food first my daughter request for ketchup waitress said she'll be right over with it. Never got it, finished her whole meal I still hadn't got mine. So I canceled my order and was out of there. And I will never return."}
{"text":"In the words of my husband, \"it could have been better.\" I feel that describes our experiences pretty well. The server was very nice and the service was great. The prices are not too bad especially for dinner. I got the Seared Jumbo Sea Scallops and I would not recommend it. It came with green beans that honestly were just plain and this very weird and off-putting corn side. Unfortunately, the scallops were served over the corn and the flavor just seeped into them. If it was this dish alone, I would probably rate it two stars. My husband got the Western Barbecue Burger and overall was ok with it but said the bacon was really rubbery. He ended up having to pick them all out to enjoy the burger. Overall, great service, decent portions and prices, sub-par food."}
{"text":"Go here for the drinks and the atmosphere and you wont be disappointed.  Dont prder the fish tacos."}
{"text":"As much as I love Bass Pro and as much as I am there, I had never eaten at this restaurant.  I hadn't really heard anything good about it, which is probably why.

The design and decor of the place are awesome.  We sat there and gazed off at the high ceiling and the intricate detail on the walls, as well cool old fishing photos they have on the old beach wood covered walls.  The fire in the middle of the dining area and the fish tank walls give it a Florida like, tropical fishing cabin/beach hut vibe if you will.  We also were able to get lost in the menu, which is large and contains some great seafood fare as well as the traditional burgers, sandwiches and salads.  There is everything from buffalo burgers to crawfish bites, to alligator tail.  Very cool menu and everything looks good.

Well, they were smart to make the place a tourist attraction in itself because the service ranked right above whale crap in my opinion.  When we walked in there were two decent sized groups (around 6-8 in each party) and two other couples in the whole place.  There were three waitresses working the dining room area.  We got to the restaurant at 5:55pm, sat down and waited until 6:05 to get our drink orders placed.  Another 10 minutes went by and finally came the two waters, milk and watered down lemonade we got for the kids.  We ordered food (2 burgers, 1 order of mac and cheese for the kids to split) and waited.  We waited some more, got lost in the decor and aura of the place, waited some more, gazed around, waited some more.  Finally the waitress came up and asked us if we wanted more bread, when a half a loaf was still left on the table.  I looked down, looked back up, and politely declined.  Well, 5 minutes later we got another loaf of bread, 30 minutes after we ordered dinner.  I grabbed my belongings and told the wife we were leaving ( We had to get in line for Santa).  The kids were wrangled up and we walked to the front to pay for the drinks.  I waited for a manager, while the waitress (not very motivated by any means) asked me if we wanted it \"to go\".  I laughed and said I would just stop by and see if it was ready at lunch the next day.  She told me to \"hang on\" while she found a manager.  When he came over he told me it was \"almost ready\".  I reminded him that it was 30 minutes from the time we ordered, and the order was two burgers and a bowl of mac and cheese which should have been out in 7 minutes max,  He implied there were large orders ahead of me but comped me the drinks.

Thanks, Johnny Morris, I owe you a glass of milk.  

Moral of the story, the staff is less than competent, to say the least.  The food looks great but I could not tell you if it's actually real or just something they dangle in front of you to let you admire the ambiance of their fishing hut. I wish I could trust this place enough to give it another go, but I don't have hours to burn waiting on food.  Maybe someday.  

The reason it got two stars and not zero is the place is really cool and has an awesome looking bar.  The menu looks fantastic, but again I'm not sure if what they offer ever actually comes out."}
{"text":"So the other day, my buddy needs ammo for our upcoming visit to the redneck shooting range.  He suggests we go to Bass Pro Shop, since it's where he buys his shooting range hardware and funware.  Since I've never set foot in one of these places, I'm totally down to check it out, so away we go.

The main store is like Disneyland/IKEA for the outdoor enthusiast, whether you like fishing, hunting, hiking, camping or just blowing shit up.  Such places are not my scene, as it's just too much sensory overload all around me.  I get my ammo online which is wayyyyy cheaper and conveniently delivered to my door.

He also recommends the adjacent restaurant, which apparently serves up alligator, something that neither of us has ever tried.  I'm seriously down for trying some out, so once laden with lead and gunpowder, we mosey on over for a bite.

We walk in.  Hostess immediately greets us and seats us in this cavernous, Disneyesque looking dining venue, decorated with too many poorly spent corporate dollars, with a view of an enormous aquarium, reminiscent of typical Las Vegas tack.

We are greeted by Bubba (not his name, I don't think), who would appear to me, to be more comfortable wearing camouflage, hiding out in the woods, with his high powered rifle, chewing tobacco and waiting for an unsuspecting coyote, wolf, deer, elk, or some other innocent critter with the anticipation of blowing the shit out of it for sport.  His table side efforts are marginal, at best. 


We order the following:

1. Alligator appetizer.
2. Pan fried trout.
3. Fish n chips.

The alligator arrives, drizzled in a pistachio colored sweet cream cheese kind of sauce, which would be better served on a stale cupcake, or as a face mask on an ugly pig.  How it made its way onto this plate, and all over the alligator nuggets is truly baffling.  Oh, and speaking of the alligator nuggets, they reminded me of the McDonald's chicken McNuggets that I consumed from time to time as a child.  It was a totally disappointing experience, especially with that nasty fucking Miami Vice colored pastel green sauce drizzled all over the plate, as if Jackson Pollock had a seizure in the kitchen while opening a can of Martha Stewart vomit colored spring time Caribbean seafoam premium paint.  I'd love to see the look on Gordon Ramsay's face if he ever tasted one of them.  Whoever thought that this was a good idea, clearly don't know much 'bout quality vittles.  Clearly.  But don't take my word for it.  Just be sure to bring a box of Mickey D nuggets in order to do a comparison blind taste test.  I think you'd be hard pressed to tell the difference between them.  Just make sure to have a beer, tequila, mouthwash or can of 5w30 motor oil handy, for rinsing away the nasty flavor of that ridiculous green sauce.  Better yet, order the appy without it, or on the side.  Bring a stale cupcake too, just for fun.

The pan fried trout in cornmeal was totally sad and flavorless, accompanied by overcooked limp and soggy veggies (reminiscent of a Ramada Inn conference center somewhere in Fargo, North Dakota, during the 1980's....in winter) and to top off the shit on a plate, a large spoonful of boxed wild rice.  Yah, sure, you betcha!

My friend had the fish n chips, which although the fish was good, the entire plate was covered with bits of burnt breading bits, which when brought to the attention of Bubba the waiter and his cousin Bubba the manager, they each replied like a couple of corporate zombie cogs as \"it's spec from corporate\" and \"our customers seem to like it.\"  Poor customers.  Of course they do.  How silly of us to even question it.  We were clearly dining in the wrong place.

The snow birds probably line up out the door to eat at this joynt while looking at tropical fish swimming around in a giant tank and planning their next vacation to Las Vegas, Disney, an RV park or a thrilling all you can eat cruise to the Bahamas. Yes! Very exciting indeed!!

Not exactly sure what that reply meant, but judging by their reactions to our question, we just let it go and chalked up the experience to a lesson in overpriced culinary vulgarity.

Good times near seizure world.  Haha.  Good times indeed.  I'll never go back."}
{"text":"Islamorada is an interesting case.  On one hand, they have fried alligator.  Delicious, delicious fried alligator.  It makes me want to open my own restaurant that serves only alligator.  But I digress.

On the flip side, their non-alligator food has been pedestrian.  I did enjoy the tournament burger, but it's a glorified bacon cheeseburger.  As much as I like a pile of bacon on my burger, that's not enough to score a ton of points with me.

The bread is good.

The lemonades with the different flavors are nice, especially the pomegranate lemonade.  +1 for the bread and lemonade.

Today I had the Islamorada sandwich, which is mahi mahi on a bun.  I obviously should've paid better attention to the description, because I *hated* the cheese on it.  Too much of it, and it totally dominated the flavor.  It's a fish sandwich, not an 800 proof Irish whiskey/paint thinner.  Also, the bun was soggy, presumably due to the gross cheese grease.  Steer clear of that sandwich.

But they do have that fried alligator.... I'm drooling just thinking about it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here on a Sunday afternoon (around 3), hoping for a quiet lunch/dinner and were not disappointed! There was hardly anyone else in the restaurant, so we got to sit with a great view of the aquarium. 

Our server was really nice, on top of things, and new when to give us space/when to check on us. I was really impressed.

The loaf of bread that they bring you before you order is INCREDIBLE! Would have ordered a wheelbarrow full to take home! It's freshly baked and dusted with sugar. Delicious. One loaf? Not enough! :)

The food didn't blow me away, but it was still tasty. We were pleasantly surprised by the alligator appetizer. It was kind of salty, but whatever the sauce was on top (green, and a little sweet/tangy) I wouldn't have minded taking a bucket of it home. 

I had the coconut shrimp and was happy with the taste/size of the shrimp. I wasn't as impressed with the sauce that accompanied them, so I just happily ate the shrimp without it. 

My boyfriend ordered the fish and chips and I was AMAZED at the size of the cod strips, gigantic. He chowed down but still had to take a lot of it home (he later told me that it made a great sandwich the next day). 

4 stars because I would definitely consider myself a fan of the experience and will be back!"}
{"text":"Wasn't expecting a whole lot because of the reviews, but pleasantly surprised! Well worth coming out. Fish was good, macaroni and brisket was good, alligator appetizer was awesome, salad was fresh and crisp."}
{"text":"Had the pulled pork sandwich. Perfectly sauced. Great flavor and not dry. The fries are yummy too. Service is pretty good!"}
{"text":"I was surprised at how good a restaurant attached to the Bass Pro Shop could be.  Boy was I wrong to pre-judge.  

We went there at the birthday request of my daughter (she turned 6 and wanted to be there with the fish tank to look at). The staff was wonderful and put together a table with a terrific view of the fish tank because she asked them so nicely.  

We tried the alligator appetizer.  I didn't like it but every one at the table enjoyed it.  I had a really wonderful Catfish Etoufee. Yummy."}
{"text":"We actually had a great time here. They were out of the fried alligator which was a bummer but we have some great dishes. We sat in the bar area which was the best place - LARGE fish tank(think rain forest cafe) to look at . Service was good - we had two or three different people stop by to see if we were ok which was great. I was surprised honestly since this place always was passed up. It's a game/fish restaurant - try at least once since they have some odd - and interesting foods."}
{"text":"We went for lunch here on a whim as we were shopping at the Bass Pro shop.
We had a great eating experience, as we were there on a friday it was all you could eat fish and chips. I am not a gret liker of potatoe chips, but these were quite probably the best I have ever been served. The fish was huge! easily twice the size of what I normally get as a fillet, the batter was light and crispy, and most importantly, not oily. Our table service was excellent, and the coffee was far better than most. 
We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"We love Islamorada Fishing Company! We're from south Florida and visit the Dania Beach location all the time so when we saw there was one out here in AZ we had to try it! The service, the drinks, the bread, the desert are all the same and just as equally phenomenal as the one in south Florida. However the SHRIMP PASTA (which is my absolute favorite in the Dania location) is not the same here!  It was really such a let down! Our waitress mentioned that they changed the recipe out here a couple years ago and I can't imagine why! It's a crowd favorite! My husband had the grouper sandwich and thought it was delicious (I tried it too and thought it was pretty good.) but the pasta was not unfortunately. I imagine we'll be back & I'll probably have something different but we definitely won't be making that drive (40 mins for us) as often as I thought when I thought they had my favorite shrimp pasta. But over all it was good."}
{"text":"Some slick shot mba came in, tore down the aquarium, changed the menu, removed all the choices of fish, put the trout on special for $20 when it used to be $12.99. Also the staff is pissed off too, which kills the vibe...and the food sux. This used to be a regular stop, never again..."}
{"text":"Took my great-aunt and folks out for lunch here. While we had a bit of a wait for our food, the fish & chips were well worth the wait. Crispy, non-greasy and not too fishy tasting. The host, Aaron, told me the name of the fish (hoki?). Being from the Bay Area, I appreciate good seafood when away from SF.  Will be back next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Went on Saturday afternoon to celebrate a birthday. We had a group of about 20 and we had two tables with two different servers. We tried the alligator appetizers - delicious. The batter was crunchy and spicy and delicious. The bread was soft and sweet - sprinkled with sugar (not necessary but tasty) No butter needed! I had the fried catfish w/mashed red potatoes and broccoli. Two complaints - The broccoli had no flavor at all! and while the catfish was good, it would have been even better with the batter used on the alligator! Cousin next to me had the maple salmon on a bed of rice w/ seasonal veggies - it was SO good! I had to stop myself from eating too much of his :-) And my mom devoured her fish tacos. The service was really good and we had 10 kids and the servers were really great with them. All the kids had popcorn shrimp and fries and we all sampled those and they were great! Prices were reasonable. I don't think we have one near where I live but I'd definitely go back next time I'm in AZ."}
{"text":"Good. Not great. Gives you a Disney Resort feel. Food was adequate. Family had fish and Chips that were good. Grandson loves the live fish, Sharks on the walls and very tall ceilings."}
{"text":"Mostly love it for the unique assortment of decorations, the atmosphere is fun.  Would go as far as five stars if the food always wowed me, but it does fall short."}
{"text":"Wonderfull Sweet Bread and Catfish!

Nice little restaurant inside Bass Pro Shops with good food and cool atmosphere. Great for family or date nights. 

Prices are fair for what you are getting."}
{"text":"Empty restaurant at 8pm, bar closing, no chef cooking and absolutely nobody in the restaurant.  We made the mistake of staying.  Fish restaurant with two choices of fish, but mostly fried.  Stay away"}
{"text":"Service was lukewarm. My table had crumbs on it and was sticky, you can tell they didn't clean it off. They don't offer gravy for their mashed potatoes, which felt kind of funny considering it looks like a nice restaurant, you would think they would. The mashed potatoes tasted okay though. The restaurant itself is beautiful, but it seems like the staff is generic, not bad not good,  doesn't make you want to go back. Bummer. I wanted to like it more, this is the second time I have eaten here. Both times it felt like a sleepy place. Just feels like the customer service aspect is off. Next time I'll go to Cracker Barrel where they always seem pretty happy and excited to see you. This place felt kind of like 'oh great, a customer (insert blase attitude)' type feeling. Other people may like it more if they are with family or something. Like I said it's not terrible or anything, but it feels like they are not using this place to its full potential, mainly from a service aspect. I wish it were better because if it were I would definitely come back because I like Bass Pro Shop so much and the store ambiance. But the service at the restaurant is so boring and just feels like they don't care very much. I ordered the rib-eye steak which was pretty good, but nothing incredible, nothing to write home about not enough to make me come back. The broccoli was hard to bite, and you could tell it wasn't cooked through all the way, it wasn't soft like most restaurants."}
{"text":"This may be my new favorite restaurant, everyone who visits will be going here! The decor is well amazing so much that I've decided maybe interior design for restaurants should be what I'm doing because it must be exciting. We sat by the fire, we'll sit at the bar next time..But you can still get a good view of the aquarium from where we sat.

Just when you're thinking ...well this doesn't mean the good is great...comes the alligator app, followed shortly by our entrees. The food wasn't great, it was spectacular. 

They did not have calorie count but if you can have some self control and get boxes...it doesn't matter!"}
{"text":"First time I've stopped here. Disappointing. Service was slow. Fried fish didn't taste very fresh and salad was wilted, not fresh either. Probably not coming back."}
{"text":"It was the first time we had heard of this restaurant.  What a disappointment this was.   We were in the area and wanted seafood so we googled seafood and were excited when it brought up a place we had never been to.  So... we walked in and were excited.  The fish tank was awesome!  The layout of the restaurant is nice and huge.  The host tried to seat us in a corner where there was no one else so we asked to sit at the bar where we could see the fish tank at least and we were glad we did. Michelle was at the bar.  She was nice and friendly.  She took our appetizer order and our drinks order and we were happy.  We questioned why there was no crab or lobster on the menu.  She laughed and said that \"the best seafood had been removed from the menu and she did not know why!\"  She then came and asked if we were ready to order our entrees and we thought well, yes we would because they would be ready by the time our appetizers were done.  Michelle came by about 10 minutes later to say our appetizers would be right out.  We chatted and watched the fish and about 21 minutes after we had placed our appetizer order, we hear a sweet voice behind us saying our entrée order.  The lady who brought the food was sweet and said she had our entrees and we asked where our appetizers were?  No one seemed to really know about them so for want of a better solution, we said to forget about our appetizers which consisted of 2 house salads and a cup of clam chowder and the garlic mussels, and we would just have our entrees.  Our entrees were : 2 all you can eat fish and the fish tacos.  Now everyone knows that firstly, we had placed the order and surely that was not hard to take and, as  paying customers we want what we order, right?  Michelle even wrote down that we requested bacon bits and ranch with the salads!  Secondly, what a loss of revenue that was!  The staff, the two ladies who were umming and ahhing about what could possibly have happened, did not seem very concerned about this so we just had our entrees and drinks and exchanged puzzled looks!!!  Michelle sort of asked if we still wanted the mussels and we said no because we already had our entrees!  Of course they tried to over-compensate for the mistakes by inundating us with fish...and more fish...and more fish!  That we did not ask for.  We knew it was all you can eat but surely only if we asked for it?  They did that three times!  The second plate of fish came and it went cold because we were not done with the first!  So the third plate came and we had to started on the second so because the third one was hot, we gave back the second plate and took the third...one positive was that Michelle  did oblige us with a dessert for our 17 year old's birthday which we were grateful for.  But even that...I asked for the Crème Brulee Cheesecake for the birthday dessert (which, by the way we were willing to pay for) and we were forced to have an apple tart with ice cream!  Thank goodness it was good....but again, it was not what we ordered!!!  Our entrees were \"ok\".  Sadly, this was very forgettable and we go out a whole lot!  Now we know why they only have 3 stars...come on guys, either you want to do this or you don't.  You have lots of competition and I have to say that I was not happy to pay my bill of $70.00 and on top of that Michelle gave me change for $100 that forced me to leave her $20.00 !!!  Oh, the highlight of the whole experience was the beauty of Outdoor World!!!  Thank you so much...We will definitely be back to Outdoor World but we will not be back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is an ok restaurant.  It is located in side the Bass Pro Shop.  I came here several years ago and remember it being better.  I think they changed the menu.  The best part about this place is the giant fish tank.  Its more of a dining experience to go along with the whole Bass Pro experience."}
{"text":"I came in after shopping at Bass Pro Shop and sat at the bar.  Not only was the service fast but also friendly.  I order the Fish and Chips which included three large pieces of fish, a plentiful amount of French fries,  cole slaw and tarter sauce (the usual).  Food came out quickly and was delicious! I also love the large fish tank."}
{"text":"Great food great service great atmosphere we will be back for sure and they offer military discount"}
{"text":"Our experience here was not good.  We took the kids to see Santa and were given a pass to come back in an hour and 15 minutes.  We decided to eat here since we were here.  It took about 7 minutes to get a table, there was no one in front of us.  We sat down and our server proceeded to tell us that she was tired and had been there since 11am. In our party were 4 adults, 1 teenager, 2 six year olds and 2 two year olds.  We all ordered water and some juice for the kids and 1 beer and our food at the same time.  We did not get our water or any other drinks served to us until about 2 minutes before the food came out.  This server just couldn't  handle it.  She put the small kids drinks in regular cups and then at the end asked if we wanted them in kids cups.  The whole experience was just ridiculous.  Everything took so long that as soon as it came we had to ask to our food to go since we were waiting to see Santa.  When we got in out 7 pm line we waited another hour before we just left. I asked an associate what was going on and he told me that there was a Members party there at the time and they got to take precedence over everyone else.... Very DISAPPOINTED......"}
{"text":"I was so amazed that Bass Pro Shops had a restaraunt in it, let alone be a place I would enjoy eating. But, my wife's Uncle said it was good, so we went. 

The alligator and calamari appetizers were pretty good, but nothing remarkable. My wife had a pretty good pasta dish with shrimp, and I had a catfish dinner. I've never been to a place that could ruin fried catfish, and that streak continues. 

I also got to try a bite of a crab cake sandwich, and I wish I would have ordered it, it was very tasty.

I don't know that I'll be back to a Bass Pro Shops anytime soon, but if I do, I'll certainly think about trying another one of their restaraunts."}
{"text":"This one is no where near as good as the one in Branson MO. the service was terrible the pinacolada was terrible, the croutons were stale even the little crackers with the soup were stale. My 9 year old son who loves seafood was disappointed in the shrimp. the smoked fish dip was the only thing that saved it from a 1 star rating. don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"The good: After our friend had a conniption fit...they let us all sit together. (She had called many weeks ahead of time to arrange it and was given a hard time.) We had a large group and we were served by 2 servers instead of 1. Our dishes were clean. The restroom was clean. 

The BAD: Everyone in my family and a few others were sick as dogs after an hour or two for the whole night. We all ordered different entrees and we each either vomited or had severe diarrhea or both. The food was extremely greasy, heavy as if they used old cooking oil or oil that had gone bad. The fish and chips were very over-battered. The fish were smaller than the actual batter coating itself. The grouper had a weird bisque on the top which might as well have been crisco and velveeta. Awful! The blackened salmon was only okay but had a funny taste to it on the ending notes and was under-seasoned. The service was slow but kind. We will never eat there again because of the suffering we experienced for the entire night after leaving the restaurant."}
{"text":"This is the worst seafood in all of Phoenix.  The only fresh fish are in the aquarium.  My wife and I have been here twice, once when they first opened and about a year ago when we were out on a date.  I thought that it would be a great idea to have seafood after catching a movie, but I had forgotten about our lackluster first experience.  The server overheard me chatting with my wife that I was going to ask what on the menu was wild caught and fresh.  She informed us quickly and politely that NOTHING on the menu was fresh... it was ALL frozen.  She was also pretty sure that almost everything on the menu was farm raised.  I had a grilled sampler with crab and fish.  All of it tasted extremely fishy and as I drove home I could feel myself getting sick.  Let's just say that I paid money for food that did not nourish me.

Recommendation... do not eat here, go to King's Fish House at Tempe Marketplace or Seafood Market & Restaurant in Mesa."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how incredible one can hope a restaurant adjacent to the hunting man's paradise to be... but let me just be the hundredth or so Yelper to say it's FAR from incredible. We had 22 in our party for my father in laws birthday and it was an absolute train wreck. 2 very separate tables (I'm talking so separate you can't even see each other) when there is ample space to make one large table and one very stressed out server who made every simple request seem like the BIGGEST deal and so impossible. Why the hell it took over two hours to serve 22 people some iced tea and fried fish is frickin beyond me but I know for damn sure I won't be back."}
{"text":"Ehhhhhh. That's how I feel. Is it bad? No. Is it great? No. Is it good? I guess. The prices are fair, the selection is HUGE. It's very family friendly, and after a quick tour around the shop with a toddler (surprisingly entertaining!) this dining room is a good way to end your trip. I had the garlic shrimp skewers, and it was nice to see the healthy grilled options. They were good, pretty standard. My vegetables were very buttery, which I didn't really want. The bread they bring you before is something a lot of people love, but it's basically a loaf you can buy at the store with sugar on top! 

I had the bread pudding for dessert, which was good but not great. Only the top was barely cooked. But, hey, it had caramel and cinnamon on it! They excitedly told us it had no raisins in it, but it really could have used raisins or nuts or something else.

Service was fine - the place was slow so we wish she actually could have been a little more attentive, but I certainly wouldn't knock any stars for service. She was friendly and knowledgable about the menu!

I was with a party of 5 adults and 1 toddler and we all decided we have no interest in coming back. It's something to do once, and I like what other reviewers have said about going and eating while waiting for Santa."}
{"text":"Great food at a reasonable price. I loved the Gator. Food is very favorable & service was also very good. This restaurant is a part of Bass Pro so I also enjoyed wandering around the store. It takes more than one visit to take it all in."}
{"text":"I've left 5 star reviews in the past for Islamorada but can't any longer. My last 3 or 4 visits have been disappointing. The food used to be well prepared and fresh. Lately it has been lazy and poor quality. A few weeks ago I had a shrimp po boy and it was 5 shrimp on a hard bread roll. Last night I ordered the Islamorada fish sandwich - small, once frozen piece of mahi grilled, it was a perfect square and wasn't fresh, straight from Costco probably. It came with less than 20 French fries, most of them small nubs the size of a thumbnail. I had to ask for tartar sauce and an adult serving of fries. There was no ketchup on the table and none was brought. For $15 I expect more, Rubios does better than this actually. This used to be a great place for a good meal but now the kitchen is disinterested in cooking with any pride and it feels like corporate has put some cost cutting measures in place in hopes no one notices the much smaller portions and lower quality."}
{"text":"The service was incredibly slow.  Granted, we had a relatively large party, maybe 12 total.  But some people didn't eat, some (three, maybe four?) had ordered well in advance of my arrival too.
It took forEVER to get my margarita and I waited for her to take my order too.
She seemed enthusiastic about us being there but the part about taking care of your table(s) must not be her priority.
I waited as long for my food to come out of the kitchen as I did for her to actually see if I wanted to order.
She never even asked if I wanted another cocktail or to have my water refilled.

The entree I ordered was the Scallops and Shrimp with pasta.  It was tasty too.  One scallop seemed to be on the undercooked side but overall I would say it was satisfactory.  Of couse I like Nigiri too so what doesn't bother me could be a real big issue for someone else.

The restaurant was SLOW.  I believe that there were maybe as many customers in the bar as there was in the restaurant.
Guess that makes sense why my drink took so long but doesn't really explain why the rest of the service was \"off\"."}
{"text":"My wife and I were in the mood to try something different.  We decided to go to Islamorada Fish Company resturaunt located inside Bass Pro Shops. We were here anyway...so why not??
We started with the alligator bites in sweet jalapeño sauce. Amazingly good!  Not just for wallets and belts anymore!  We also have Bavarian pretzels with beer cheese which was also pretty darn tasty!
Then we moved on to the main course of a Cuban sandwich and battered Cajun catfish. My wife wasn't sold on the \"cajun\" part of the catfish. I thought that the Cuban was average. My wife thoroughly enjoyed the \"Top Shelf Long Island Iced Tea\" and I thought the 22oz Bud Light and Stella were great. 
The bartender knew a lot about the fish in the aquarium behind the bar and patiently answered the questions we had about the varieties of specimens swimming in front  of us. 
Always wanted to try this place and I'm glad I did.  Now I can shop in peace without that nagging feeling that I'm forgetting something!!"}
{"text":"The food was surprisingly good for a restaurant attached to a retail store. The place was very roomy and servers were attentive and polite. I had the shrimp and scallops, it was a bit heavy and there are a lot of fried items on the menu. Very rich for my personal taste but it did have lots of flavor. 
I would return here and enjoyed my experience. I even bought a flannel jacket while I was there. Lots and lots of flannel and camo to choose from in the store. Lol."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a business lunch. The restaurant is beautiful! The aquarium reminds me of diving in the Carribean. Gorgeous! The special of the day was a steak, I know...I was a little shocked myself. We didn't try that. The group tried the fish and chips. Everyone enjoyed their meals and the mini loaf of bread with honey butter. The staff was helpful and attentive. The enivironment was beautiful( have I said that already?) and clean. It was a nice change from quick service and fast casual. I would try again during dinner hours to see if the quality and service remains above par."}
{"text":"Full disclosure and flat out weird,,,I like to dine in front of aquariums...The TMI will end there, so you can continue reading. Given my predisposition for watching fish swim in large bodies of water, few restaurants being able to meet this indulgence and the Islamorada having an 11,500 gallon tank - think HUGE, this should be a slam dunk review, but no. The food and service is marginal only occasionally rising above with its selection of beers on tap and some incredibly tasty mussels in butter sauce. The service at the half empty bar was just short of rude and the house speciality - calamari brought to mind day old Kentucky Fried Chicken's extra crispy recipe from the '80s...yeah, its' that bad.. So, get your drink and dazzle yourself with the fish in the tank and steer clear of the ones on the plate!"}
{"text":"Wanting to try someplace new and a bit out of the ordinary, I had lunch at the Islamorada Fish Company, which is attached to the Bass Pro Shop at the 202 & Dobson Rd. I have never been to the Bass Pro Shop, but have heard that they have a good restaurant.

The restaurant was large - I didn't even make it into the store. I didn't feel like I was in Key West, despite the Jimmy Buffet music playing. I felt like a Red Lobster exploded. It was much larger than Red Lobster, but the décor was similar. One key feature was the large aquarium behind the bar. Fish were circling on the ceiling and there were photos of fish people had caught on the walls. 

The menu had a large selection to choose from. I ended up choosing the Pan Fried Trout with potatoes, corn and a corn muffin ($11.99). The first item to arrive was a mini-loaf of bread. The bread was good, but it had a bit of honey glazed across it, which made it sticky. I liked the bread, but wasn't impressed with the sticky sensation. Next thing to arrive was the trout. It came on a cast iron skillet and I felt if I were a kid, went fishing with my grandfather and fried up the day's haul...except I never did those things and there were no heads and cleaning wasn't required. BUT if I had caught fish with my grandfather and cooked it on a cast iron skillet over a camp fire, this might be what it would taste like. All the fun of fishing and camping, but without the nasty parts. The trout arrived with a lemon and a sprig of rosemary. The thickly cut potatoes were seasoned with salt and pepper and quite tasty. The corn, not so much. It was grilled, but tasted like a twice-grilled unflavored Niblet that stuck to your teeth. Save some for later I suppose.  The corn muffin was dry, corn-mealy and kind of tasteless. I ordered dessert - the apple pie - and it was cast iron galore again. A scoop of ice cream with the pie and it was a nice end to a tasty meal. 

The restaurant wasn't busy, despite it being lunchtime on the 4th of July. Even the bathrooms were nice - big and clean. The only downside was when I walked in to wash the sticky honey off of my hands and a guy was sitting in the stall holding a conversation on his cell phone. 

I would definitely try this place again. Good food and the service wasn't bad either."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool! Its inside Bass Pro Shop, which you think at first is kind of weird and would be really small, NO not at all! Bass Pro shop is huge and this restaurant is also. When you first walk in you can see a large fish tank that separates the front room dinning area and bar from the back dinning room. Once you get around the bar and the beautifully large fish tank, the restaurant opens up into a large dinning area. The celling is very high and the space in there is just so opening and welcoming. The decorations with the fish on the walls, the tables, the large fireplace in the middle of the dinning area, the paint, the fish tank..... it all works perfectly together to create an outdoor ambiance, with a lot of class and openness! I really loved the way they have this restaurant set up, its beautiful!

Ok onto the food! We received an order of I believe sugar glazed bread when we ordered our drinks! Oh my goodness this bread is delicious. The sugar on the top gives the bread a little extra mmmmmm. It might just be me because I cant eat a lot of bread due to my gluten intolerance, but I had to have at least 1 piece! They have a great spread of different kinds of meals, from chicken, to sea food, to steaks to alligator! YES I said alligator! I have never had alligator before, so of course it was one of the appetizers I ordered just to give it a whirl! The best way to describe the breaded alligator, is that it has a shrimp texture, with a chicken tenderness to it. So its a mix of shrimp and chicken. It doesn't have a weird taste or bite to it at all. The sauce that was served with the alligator actually really played with the flavor well! It created a nice little extra bite to the gator to give it more flavor. For my main dish I had the shrimp pasta. The alfredo sauce was different, and really blended with the shrimp well. It was nice to have a dish with large pieces of shrimp to eat and not little bite sized shrimp. My friend ordered the cajun chicken pasta. This dish was served with the same alfredo sauce as mine but with the cajun taste instead of shrimp. I have to say his chicken was spiced deliciously and I enjoyed his plate much more than mine. The combination of the cajun spices along with the alfredo sauce made a great dish!

The staff here was incredibly friendly, our waitress was very knowledgeable and helpful when we asked about he alligator dish, the manager came and checked on our dishes as we were eating and everyone wished us a nice goodbye as we left! I like going to places like this, being surrounded by friendly people who enjoy their job and having a great meal, its just a great way to start off a good Sunday funday!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I've never been treated so bad at a restaurant. My husband and I sat at the bar and it took 5 min for the bartender to ask us if we wanted a drink. Mind you they were not busy at all there were only 3 other people in there. So after I got my water she said she would be back to take our order but walked around for 15 minutes doing absolutely nothing. When I asked for a server her terrible boss had an attitude while she rolled her eyes and kept running her smart ass mouth. Worse service hands down, no wonder they were empty. They get one star for the nice fish tank."}
{"text":"Great place.  The atmosphere is very cool and the food was awesome. I highly recommend the alligator tacos. My hubs had the shrimp Po boy and loved it too.  The service was just ok but that was the only down side"}
{"text":"There have been a lot of changes and not for the better. They took the coconut shrimp off the menu which was one of my favorites. The fish is also always changing and not always for the better. I understand that they are trying to get whatever is seasonal but I haven't had the same thing twice and the batter one time was very overwhelming. The bread loaf they bring to the table is still the best part! The atmosphere is fun as well. Especially in the winter when they have the fire going which we don't get to enjoy a lot in Arizona. We will keep giving it a try but the new menu is not what it used to be."}
{"text":"I admit, I came to eat here because of I wanted to try the fried alligator. Anyways it was so good and yummy I had to lick the plate. Then, I had the fish sandwich. I thought for $12.00 it was a little overpriced and the size. I think it was fried catfish. But I had to admit it was so good yum yum and yum. I had the kiwi lemonade as well and it was good too.  The service was good, but the only problem is when the food came out, it took them quite a while to get the food onto the table. But at least the food was still hot when I got it and not too cold.  I would eat here again."}
{"text":"A study in how not to run a restaurant floor. We checked with the hostess and were told a 20 minute wait . I can see 7 tables open in the bar area , and 5 booths in the back. There are about four names on the waiting list. Why cant we be seated immediately. The young lady handed us a beeper to my astonishment. We hung out for a bit then talked to the \"manager\" who seemed equally incompetent and said they had a process. Now theres only one other party of two waiting. He then informs us we can sit in the bar , great why not let us do that 20 minutes ago , The bartender is also the waiter , hopelessly understaffed on the two occasions we stopped in , this is a friday night mind and its not crowded and still understaffed. The food is good , service slow and sketchy , and this front end staff needs a wakeup call !"}
{"text":"Dined here for lunch yesterday with my wife. Love this place! Our server was attentive & we received drinks right away. Great ambiance/love the huge aquarium. Ordered the trout , which was fantastic!! Wife had fish & chips, which she also enjoyed. Did not care for the clam chowder - for some reason just was not tasty. The sweet bread is to die for - have no problem putting on a few pounds indulging in those calories. Would definitely recommend and go there again."}
{"text":"First impression loved the huge fish tank. Service was great waitress was very attentive and even brought us refills as we got close to finishing our fountain drinks. We had the Alligator nuggets for an appetizer. My first time trying alligator and I enjoyed the sauce they served with it I felt it really complimented the gator. I wanted something light so I wouldn't be tired the rest of the day so I went with a Caesar salad with shrimp. I know boring!  I wanted to be adventurous and try a meal with fish but I just got a Caesar you can get anywhere. There's not much you can say about a Caesar salad unless it is abnormally good or bad. I felt the dressing was a bit heavy may have been safer to order dressing on the side. Shrimp seemed a bit over seasoned, rather small but when I mixed them into the salad it blended the flavor and wasn't over powering. I will definitely come back and try more seafood daring meals. Loved the atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to Islamorada Fish Company. Next to Bass Pro Shops, @1133 N Dobson Rd, Mesa, AZ. 02/16/14. This was our first time ever to eat at this restaurant and our last. 
      
      We ate the Signature Fish and Chips, and the Blackened Salmon Linguine. 

      The fried fish was extremely greasy, the french fries tasted like mushy and bland, you could tell they had been sitting sometimes and were lukewarm. My fries looked like they had been prepared the day before and left out on the counter overnight.
      Actually, the fish and chips were so greasy that when I picked it up with my fingers, you could see the wet grease dripping off of the bottom of the fish and puddling onto my plate... 

      On the Blackened Salmon Linguine,this dish had to be the worse, the pasta was very slimy, and the fish tasted frozen, and way over seasoned, I assume the excessive over seasoning is to camouflage the frozen taste of the fish, this dish was extremely oily.  

      In fact, this dish was so oily you could fill up a shot glass with the oil from this plate...

     However when we brought this issue to our waitress attention about our food, she downplayed it, telling us fried fish and chips supposed to be that way, funny, it's not that way at Long John Silvers or McDonald's, even some of the five-star restaurants I have eaten at. 

      As for the Blackened Salmon Linguine, our server told us this is the norm as well for this dish. 
Here's what was so bad when our server Kim address this issue to the manager he did nothing, to resolve this problem, He did not even come to our table to apologize.

Now Sick, Sick, Sick. Yes!!! We spent three days with \"Diarrhea\" with frequent trips to the bathroom...

Here's the funny part, our receipt reads: 
     \"As Fresh AsYou Can Get.\"

No ! our fish tasted frozen and reheated.

      My advice to you. If you are planning on eating at Islamorada Fish Company, do invest in a lot of toilet paper.  You'll need it..."}
{"text":"Four of us ate here and all were VERY pleased with our meals and our \"alligator\" appetizer. The atmosphere is very nice, and our service was excellent."}
{"text":"The blackend Scallops are to Rave over anytime. Great food (plenty of scallops) and a nice atmosphere along with the staff keeps you very happy"}
{"text":"Islamorada Fish Company is located inside the Bass Pro Shops on Dobson and the 202 in Mesa. The restaurant itself is over 11,000 square feet with what must be a 50ft high ceiling and a massive fish tank.

I recently went shopping at BPS for a few fishing poles and decided to take a quick lunch break here (I'm not much of an outdoorsman but I figured I owe the kids a few fishing trips when they are still little).

The food was very well seasoned and prepared, especially for lunch. I thoroughly enjoyed my grilled scallops and shrimp. Service was brisk and friendly. I spied a nifty bar area which is likely hopping at happy hour.

This place is worth a visit if you're in the area and craving seafood."}
{"text":"We normally have our traditional Xmas lunch here but too disappointing to try again for next year. Burgers burnt the alligator sauce changed now not so good .. server was ok but should have offered to  take off the burnt burger.  Oh well . Good bye"}
{"text":"my father, nana, boyfriend and myself came here for his Father's Day, because this used to be one of our favorite places to dine in for seafood. Unfortunately tonight after not seeing my dad for two months, we had terrible service with THEA she made our experience absolutely terrible. Our food was also terrible, my fried fish came out soggy and I didn't even eat it at all. Not to mention my nana believes she bite into a toothpick in her coleslaw. Burgers are also Very soggy and greasy."}
{"text":"\"Alligator\" bites are actually chicken. Tried the crab cake and it was the most fishy smelling I've ever had. I had to send it back, I couldn't even stomach it at the table.  

You can get a better quality burger at McD's.

Don't waste your money or time."}
{"text":"This place has wonderful ambiance, from its thatched ceiling to the enormous fireplace & chimney.

Stop by for a meal, and you'll receive a yeast loaf topped with sugar.  It was a nice touch.

I killed 2 gnats while dining, yet there were still more airborne. Was I in the vicinity of some kind of rotting fruit compost pile?  I don't know.

They have really good clam chowder. I highly doubt this is a canned brand. Tastes like they built if from scratch.

My wife and I ordered the world famous grouper sandwich.  Unfortunately it was topped with American cheese.  Thick ole slice of American cheese, which kind of hijacked the taste... and we didn't much care for it.  The accompanying seasoned fries were the typical frozen restaurant style.

If I come back, I'm sitting at the bar, so I can ogle their majestic salt water aquarium and reminisce of my days aboard the Calypso with Jacques."}
{"text":"Lousy food and service. Fish tacos one tasted fishy, no sauce served as advertised and fish not blacked as advertised! Told server got sauce but told all fillets the same. Didn't offer to reduce cost. Charged our bill to friends credit card and vice versa. Would never go back!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. Great service, great decor. Tried alligator for the first time super good..see u soon!!!"}
{"text":"Very nice set up. I love seafood. I ordered shrimp & chips. The place only had 2 other tables being serviced at the time. When I received my food it was lukewarm. The shrimp was not fresh.  The price was reasonable. The service was excellent. The server was entertaining. Loved her ! She's the reason for the 3 star it was all about her. If you looking for real seafood this would not be my recommendation."}
{"text":"Amazing Scenery! loved the place, and great service too! my glass was never empty. the place was kind of empty for being so awesome.... maybe because it's connected to Bass Pro shop. but that place is amazing too! anyway. go here. it's delicious."}
{"text":"We came here right after they opened and had a HORRIBLE experience. Horrible service, horrible food.  We had marked it off our list.  This was about 6 years ago I guess. 

But a month ago the friends that were with us decided to give it a second shot and loved it.  So we tried it again tonight.  What a difference! The scallops were fresh, food was great, and service was perfect.  We will certainly be coming back as we are excited to have good seafood so close to home again."}
{"text":"On the way to the airport, we decided to take my family here for lunch.  They had been raving and VERY excited about it.  It turned out to be pretty disappointing.
First, the aquarium separating the bar area and the main dining area is pretty neat, and is especially peaceful if you're not a seafood eater.  The atmosphere is nice, and we probably just went at an off time, yet, we went during off lunch hours, so the service should have been better.
Our server greeted our table, took our drink order, took our food order, and was not to be seen again... well, we saw her waiting the other tables but purposely avoiding ours.  That continued for 35 minutes while other tables with larger groups who were seated after us were served before us... 35 minutes for three bowls of soup, a garden salad (which never came) and a couple pieces of fried fish?  I think not.  We flagged down a manager who said he was finishing it right up.  And then when the food came out, it was cold.  We mentioned it to her and she seemed frustrated that she needed to make another trip to the line to have it reheated.  Give me a break. 
I also ordered a chicken quesadilla.  On the menu it stated \"stuffed with pico.  Served with (some sort of ) sour cream\".  It came out and was *SURPRISE* drizzled with some sort of chipotle and cilantro mayonnaise-based topping.  Maybe its because I live in the land of full disclosure, I'm not sure, but I was expecting tortilla, chicken, cheese, pico and sour cream on the side, not to have some calorie-laden ranch-dressing-derivative covering the tortilla.
So for the last ten minutes of our meal (and the first five) the service was very attentive.  If you like that, eat here.  If you like having service at a restaurant, and warm seafood, go to Red Lobster instead.
On the way out, I saw a TON of food under heat lamps on their line, and some of it coming out of steamtables... absolutely NO excuse for cold, cream-based soup... and no excuse for that small of an order taking 35 minutes.
I usually give places two shots, just in case they were having an off day.  Unfortunately, this place won't be getting a second try."}
{"text":"Really disappointed in my experience. I have eaten at this restaurant in California and was totally craving their fish and chips, but unfortunately didn't even get a chance to eat. The hostess stand had a sign saying to wait to be seated, so I stood around for awhile waiting to be addressed. The bartender was feet away and made no effort to notice me. I finally approached the bar after standing around like a fool and the bartender informed me the hostess left for the day. Umm...okay? Isn't it her job then to take care of customers? She told me to have a seat and she would be right with me to take my drink order. After waiting for another 5+ minutes, she just kept chit chatting with customers at the bar and never even came over to address me. Very poor customer service. Oh well...off to Cracker Barrel across the street!"}
