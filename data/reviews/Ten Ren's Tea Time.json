{"text":"The food here is a joke.  Sausage & minced pork rice with egg: rice was way over cooked, mince pork tasted nothing but soy sauce, egg was burnt on one side, vegetable look and tasted like left over from 2 days ago coming straight out of fridge.  Creamy Pork Soup with noodle: No care was put into the making of this dish. The starch on the pork were very uneven, some pieces have more starch than pork.   Bubble tea: nothing special..."}
{"text":"Two words......... Not Impressed  My cousin from California had come to Calgary to visit the family where my sisters and I have been taking her around good ol cow town to do some catching up.  Because she lives in a small town, bubble tea is scarce where we decided on taking her out for the \"good stuff\".  Unfortunately, Bubblemania is closed for renovations and we were all too lazy to make the trip down to China Town for bubble tea.  Instead I hopped onto the website (and yelp) to find a good bubble tea joint in the northwest of Calgary.  Based on the stark raving reviews of Ten Ren Tea Time and a pretty good solid menu for drinks, I was absolutely sold on trying the place for bubble tea.  What a regret that was.  For starters the cafe is quaint, cozy, and clean with nice little tables.  Service was also polite and speedy...however that's about as good it got at Ten Ren because the drinks were god awful.  My oldest sister and I got almond milk teas, while my other sister ordered an avocado milk slush, and a black tea for my cousin...all with boba in them.   Perhaps it was just a bad night for the little dilly of a cafe, however all our drinks tasted off where they would go from sour to sweet and then leave an awesome (just amazing) scratchy layer of film on our tongue (hint the sarcasm?).  The only thing that saved the drink were the pearls...but even those were a disappointment.  Correction: actully the boba (pearls) were a REALLY big disappointment because unlike other bubble tea shops who sell the usual large size of boba (pearls), Ten Ren decides to sell only the small sized boba which deflated my emotional balloon for the night of bubble tea.  Overall I was not thoroughly impressed where I will not be returning anytime soon for bubble tea.  In my general opinion, give this place a shot if you want however I say save the money and disappointment and go to a good bubble tea shops like Try Again, Bubblemania or even The Dessert House.  Sorry Ten Ren but you just didn't cut it for me...and you also need to get better printing for the menus, the colours made the drinks look weird!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars it's an alright place to study since they offer wifi and close pretty late. They also offer hot food and specials deals for food and drink combo."}
{"text":"Average Taiwanese food. Me and my friend ordered the creamy chicken soup $7. 49 and tea flavoured and minced pork rice with egg $7. 49. The minced pork rice is good but sausage. .tea flavour?  I couldn't taste it. The waffle and green tea ice cream is average. However the green tea flavour for the ice cream is not strong at all. Overall its pretty good but nothing special."}
{"text":"I had the worst experience here.  I've been to many other Ten Ren's and other bbt places and I must say this is the worst one.    Their drinks are average, and I have nothing to complain about there.  Their service is horrible.  First off, our table.  The hostess/waitress knows there are 2 free tables usually for 4 ppl each.  We had a party of 6 waiting outside pondering why they dont' give it to us.  We walk in and had to ask them to see whether they can squeeze more chairs, or join the tables together.  Only when we asked, did they do it - cuz otherwise, who knows how much longer we would've had to wait.    Second.  Our table is in the far corner, kinda where the waitresses can't see you, nor do they ever come by.  We waited a long time to order, we waited a long time to fix our order, and we waited a long time to pay.  Not only that, but the waitressess were always short with us, and non-welcoming.   They tacked a standard 15% gratuity on our bill, which they didn't deserve.  At this point, I've already made up my mind not to return.  Third.  We leave the place, and as we all step out the door, one of the waitress that didn't serve us comes running out and says \"Excuse me.  Are you guys leaving?\" me: \"Yes... we are...\" waitress: \"Did you guys pay?\" me: \"yes, we did.. we sat over there\" and i pointed waitress: \"Who was your waitress????\"  Then one of the waitresses that actually served us comes out and says \"Ohh.. what are u doing? they paid.  I'm so sorry!\"  bullsh1t.  get your fukin' facts straight before accusing your customers of stealing.  (15% tip for this... REALLY??? why not steal my money?)  Never returning again."}
{"text":"I love milk tea, especially Taro, with tapioca pearls. I'm not a huge fan of the frozen milk teas so I was pleasantly surprised to find out they did both. They have a huge bubble tea menu, as well as serving food. This time we had already eaten, but we plan on making a trip for the food sometime soon.   The bubble tea was delicious, with quick and friendly service.   They also sell a wide-variety of loose teas to take home."}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite bubble tea place in Calgary, doesn't take a long time to make the drinks, and the lady is very nice"}
{"text":"Food and services was great.  The bill came up to about under $40 for 3 people. This is cheapest dinner event I ever attended.  Each meal ordered there was a main course + a special drink + dessert."}
{"text":"Hard to find parking. They have some regular costumers that are rude (not their fault though, but adds up to the atmosphere). Their bubble tea is decent but pricey. They don't have many food options mostly snacks."}
{"text":"First time trying a combo meal dinner at the Empress Walk Ten Ren.  Friendly and attentive staff. Seated quickly.  I ordered Taiwanese minced pork on rice.  Food was so so... bland and not much meat.  The Hokkaido grass jelly milk tea was pretty good...  smooth and creamy."}
{"text":"This is one of my go-to's for a reasonably priced dinner and drink. The bubble tea is what they're really known for, and I admit that I've never felt disappointed.   Tonight was minced pork and sausage rice along with a grape green tea bbtea. Servicing size was decent and a good amount of of sausage. The minced pork wasn't  so minced, but the flavour was there. It also comes with those skinny clear noodles and some sliced green. I feel like these noodles vary (not in a bad way) from visit to visit, but they were good this time. Of course there's the soysauce egg. Standard. The tea was grapey, not too sweet. Bubbles fresh and best to chew on. Of course I'm coming back."}
{"text":"Service is quite bad. I came here a few times but yesterday night, I went with a few friends after dinner. I wasn't hungry or thirsty so I opted out of getting anything while my friends ordered.  So here's the ridiculous policy they have: each person has to buy something otherwise you can't sit in without paying $3.49. It wasn't even busy but I'd have a little more sympathy if it were a busy night.  I'm sorry but that's just crazy. Maybe all other bubble tea shops are like this. I'll have to get back to you on that one."}
{"text":"The bbtea is great but be ready to wait for a ridiculous amount of time, the drinks are cray expensive for what they are, and they don't take credit card. Also can't say that their service has ever been that great or welcoming. But to be fair I come often just because their bbtea green teas are my fav."}
{"text":"This is less of a review and more of a bubble tea review, since I've only ever gotten bubble tea from here, but the staff and service has always been fast and pleasant! A large bubble tea is around $7, which isn't unusual. I wish I could have more to say than the bubble tea is yummy and good service but that's all I know!"}
{"text":"Was there today for the Tuesday beef special. Very very disappointed I have to say, the food was not fresh, the beef was almost a blackish color and tasted sour, when I pointed out to the waitrese and the manager, they said that's the way it should be. I've been eating there for about 6 years now, and I notice the quality of the food (in general, not just the cheap specials) started getting really bad since mid September this year. What a shame, it used to be a great place before"}
{"text":"Squid Balls are the BEST with their special orangy pink sauce, which I still don't know the name of. The food is generally a little better here than the tea shop around, but not that good either. the service is not very satisfactory. I've had burnt toast and other poorly cooked meals. My clothes get oily smell every time, which is the reason why I don't really like going there."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. I ordered delivery through Just Eat and it was an awful experience.  The food took almost 2 hours to arrive when the restaurant is right down the street.  Food was cold and soggy, the restaurant never contacted me regarding delivery issues I had to call them and they weren't helpful at all as well as not offering any sort of discount or something to make up for such an awful experience.  They very clearly do not care about their customer service.  I will not go to this restaurant again.  Oh and to top it all off there was a bone in my Taiwanese Spiced Chicken."}
{"text":"Service is under average, no smile at all from any of the waitress. Food is just so so. There are a lot of other restaurants nearby on Yonge st. You don't have to choose this one. However, they do have very good tea and non-alcohol drinks."}
{"text":"You would think a place as small as this would at least try and offer something unique to the table but sadly that was not the case. Drinks were subpar, especially when considering how expensive the bubble teas are. The customer service was absolutely abysmal. It took 20 minutes for them to take my order, not to prepare the bubble teas, just to take the order. What really upset me, however, was the server came and put a yellow sticky note on my table and said \" just put whatever you are ordering on here\". Really? I understand the place may be busy but to not even take my order in person? Was overall disgusted with the experience, will not be going back."}
{"text":"Service is horrible. I go back only because I love bubble tea- but expect to be ignored while you're there."}
{"text":"The Bubble tea is awesome! We always get Watermelon Mango....it's so awesome! We've only gone there for Bubble Tea Take out, but there service is simple and fast.  I see a huge menu when I first walk in but can't figure out what kind of food they are really known for. Sounds and looks like a tea house...not Vietnamese restaurant...which it kinda seems like they are trying to do."}
{"text":"Instant diarrhea for all who came with us to eat here. Good thing I didn't eat lol Tried to put no stars but wouldn't let me. Hence the one ..."}
{"text":"Usually go to the highway 7 location and thought id try out this new location. This restaurant is much smaller and service is a bit slow but that's ok there were a lot of bubble tea take outers. We came here for late night dinner, had the king's tea pork ribs with rice combo. The ribs were tender and juicy and it also came with a side of edamame beans and corn. With the combo you can choose any drink and get $3.50 off, so I got the mango milk ice with pudding and tapioca. The drink is nice and sweet with a mango syrup :) I enjoyed it will try their other flavors of milk ice next time. Overall the food quality was good and similar to the other location, but the menu has limited options due to the restaurant size. Definitely will come back again."}
{"text":"I've been to Ten Ren shops many times. This one used to be a yearly ritual for me when I am in the area to visit family. Every time I get the same thing - hot taro milk tea. I will NOT be coming back again. The quality has gone waaaay downhill and prices have gone way up. When I saw it was $5.75 for a small milk tea I almost walked out (but we had sat down already and didn't want to be rude). It costs at least 20% more than the many, many bubble tea places along Yonge. The tea itself was meh, like a watered down purple sugary mix. (BTW the reason I liked taro milk tea at Ten Ren is because they used to be make it with real taro). What I got was definitely not worth the premium price.   The only good thing was that, even though they now have a MINIMUM charge per person, the waitress waived it for us this time. It was kind of her and I appreciated it.   Now I know why all the other tea places along Yonge are much busier than Ten Ren.  I love bubble tea even though I know most of it comes from artificial color powder in a tub. I'm totally fine with it. Just don't try to overcharge me $5.75 for this crap."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of Ten Ren in NYC, and I guess it goes about the same for the location here.  It's quite pricey for a just even a regular iced tea (upwards of $5+).  This location of Ten Ren is quite large and has plenty of seating and is group-friendly.  The atmosphere is more industrial versus coffee cafe cozy.  Lots of fluorescent lighting throughout.  Ten Ren's tea is always ranked as some of the best tea around, but I chose to get a frozen mango milk slushie thing with egg pudding and grass jelly instead.  This ended up costing more than $8 - I would rather have something else that tasted less artificial.  The mango sauce was artificial, the milk tasted like it came from powder.  The best part of the drink/slushie was the egg pudding.    Decent spot for desserts if you're desperate... otherwise I'd go back downtown."}
{"text":"The Taiwanese food is authentic and possibly one of the best bubble tea places because they use real quality tea (as opposed to powders or cheap tea).  Try the snacks like squid balls, thick toast with condensed milk, or try the meals like beef noodle soup.  Though their drinks can be pricier, you will taste the difference."}
{"text":"This is the best bubble tea place I've been to. The drinks have so much flavour and they never get old. I'm a regular at this specific location and it tastes just as good as the first time I had it at every visit. It's always consistent, it's made the same every time. Not to mention the tapioca tastes sweet here (at some places it's flavourless).  My only complaint it the service can be slow sometimes, they charge you extra if you sit inside, and I find the staff to be a bit rude at times. There have been times where they've been super slow or got the order wrong and didn't even apologize.  Other than that, highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I always come here with 4-5 friends for light desserts and have a fun time catching up. For their desserts I especially love the Hot Herbal Jelly, it is the only dessert I love so much and can't find from anywhere in downtown (well..as far as I know). I've also tried several of their hot meals, and quite satisfied.   Really, there's no complain so far but this doesn't mean their service and all their food is 4 stars."}
{"text":"BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. I was always ordering mango passion fruit milk tea and it would always cost around 7$ tax included. This is already an overprice on bubble tea but whatever I think they make it good and different. Yesterday a trainy was serving me and she barely understood what i was saying. Id expect stuff to at least understand their menu in english. She would interrupt me everytime id say anything saying \"wait a second\" in a rude-ish manner, no smile. She said they are gonna charge me 80c more for milk and the drink came up to around 8$ already. Then they made the drink in regular size even though i ordered large! And i complained and she said i have to pay more (around $10)!! Because she misheard me, i spoke to a manager they re made it and it was too sweet (I asked for 50% sugar). Not milky. Terrible service."}
{"text":"Location/Service - Located on the outside entrance of Empress Walk, bright signs so easy to spot - Underground parking available and also Green P across the street - Bright lightning inside, regular decor setup - Plenty of seating arrangements available, perfect for studying/meetings - Staff were nice and attentive  Food/Drinks - Came here for a drink, which was a large almond milk tea   - Consistent with their other locations - Drink was smooth and strong almond taste, you can also taste crumbs of the almond  Ten Ren tends to have consistent drinks at all of their locations - glad to know this one is the same as well. And what I like about this location is that you can actually sit down, chat and relax whereas other bubble tea locations are more buy-and-go or too crowded to chat."}
{"text":"Pretty good price combo, most meals come with a drink and dessert for under $10. The food and drink was really good, definitely will go back there again as it's close to me and has pretty good deals. :)"}
{"text":"While it used to be a far cry from the Highway 7 location, the Yonge location has improved drastically over the past few years. Its bubble tea now tastes close to the Highway 7 standard, putting it among the best bubble tea shops in Toronto."}
{"text":"In the land-o-bbt (bubble tea), Ten Ren makes the same stuff, but differently and better. While they do use powered mix when you order versions such as honeydew or taro, everyone in the city seems to use powders for these flavour versions too. I suspect Ten Ren must have better blenders because they don't come out grainy - with ice pebbles or sandy grit - like some other places. Aside from powered standards, if there's a photo in the menu of organic (as in once-living) ingredients, you can expect non-powdered ingredients. For example, my favourite here is \"red bean\" because of the real red beans. Ewww, have you ever had powdered beans!? Don't.  They have the regular brownish chewy pearls, as well as the option of \"green tea pearls\". I'm not sure, but I haven't seen them outside of Ten Ren.  Side note: pearls are the chewy tapioca balls on the bottom, not the \"bubbles\" in bubble tea. Bubble tea refers to the bubbles that surface to the top once shaken.   Stuffs: - Though the address says \"Yonge St.\", round the corner of Princess Ave. to find the entrance and don't bother trying to find a door from inside Empress Walk because there isn't one. - The mostly Taiwanese food menu is decent.  - They have many options for excellent hot teas. If you ask nicely, the staff can sometimes make a recommendation for whatever ails you.  Downsides: I've never been to this location when the room temperature has been comfortable. It's always too cold or too hot. I tend to go in the evening (but not super late), and have often run into a lack of pearls - regular or green. The service seems to be inconsistent. High-turnover and understaffing makes for forgetful and slow service. However, once a server gets to your table, they do tend to be very friendly."}
{"text":"Nice clean and brightly lit area. I had a mango and raspberry fruit slush which was pretty good and a satay beef stew noodle which I though was a little overpriced. Service was decent and friendly enough."}
{"text":"Im surprised this place isnt crawling with amazing reviews.  This is my go to spot for clean environment, great drinks, and amazingly unique food.  At the heart of the theme here: variety.  You get a little bit of everything!    My only real grupe is the fact that it is located so far north and so is a hit of a trek for me but I make the bi weekly pilgrumage here religiously.    I wouldnt recommend coming with a huge group as the seating is a little more intimate for couples or double dates.    Today im having the watermelon fresh fruit bbt with chicken wings (to die for) with special seasoning :)  comfort food at its best."}
{"text":"This tea shop is really great. I had a delicious bubble tea here and the ambiance is really nice. My friend enjoyed his drink as well. I also like some of the glasses that they use to serve some of the drinks. They look super nice.   This place is always packed on weekends. However, there have been occasions where the wait was too long so my friends and I left.  I highly recommend it if you can get a table."}
{"text":"Nice renovation, which makes it look spacious and clean. The servers are friendly and drinks taste great. You can ask for less sugar which is a plus and environment is cozy."}
{"text":"Extremely friendly staff who recommended us some good drinks. Food was excellent at a fair price. :)"}
{"text":"Generally a good place with lots of variety.  Only complaint is my coat was soaked with the frying smell after I got home."}
{"text":"It's alright. The price is not bad but drinks are so so. There is 5.25 minimum charge per person."}
{"text":"There are no green tea pearls at Ten Ren's, for those people who said so clearly have no clue what they're talking about.  If you understood chinese, or if you even listened to their conversations, they always make fun of their customers or talk stupid impressions about them. I've heard them say stuff like \"lousy tipper\" then laugh at their customers just because of that. Not exactly service material.  Don't ever eat there btw, drinking bubble tea's fine but if you want to pay $9 for instant microwave food you might as well chip in a few more bucks, go to 168 or Tea Shop on Yonge just a bit north for some real cooked food.   The bubble tea there's made from powder, and I've seen some of the \"clean\" utensils with so much crap on it.   Oh yeah, they don't tell you either but if you eat in, then order take out, the take out is full price when it should be discounted. So if you do consider that option, ask for a separate bill for take out so you can enjoy the benefits of 10% discount.  Also, sometimes the restaurant is full, but if you look closely the table closest to the service is probably taken by the employees that work there that's offtime not ordering anything that will charge them then taking up the space and energy.  Also, if you choose to pay by debit card if you eat in, they just put a service charge by default on it since you can't have the option to skip tip with their machine. And it's a default 15% even with the lousy service or when it's super slow.  And if it's their fault they ran out of Tapioca, and you tried to order a special drink that includes Tapioca in the price, they don't take away the 50 cents cost of the Tapioca. Amazing, since it's not even your fault you don't get the tapioca"}
{"text":"The worst Taiwanese food I've ever had in Yonge & Finch, even in GTA. With a very high expectation going there to try some tea-flavoured dish, I can only say that it is a big disappointment to me.  The options on the menu is very limited. I ordered Pu Eh Tea Beef noodle and my friend ordered a Sausage and Minced Pork Rice. My noodle is definitely a disaster! Not a little bit pu er tea flavor, but comes with a very strong and unpleasant sesame oil smell. The noodle soup looks very greasy and tastes like nothing....talking about the noodle, it is the worst noodle I've ever had, very soft and seems like being soaked in the soup for a long time. The beef portion is very generous and tastes ok.   The staff is very nice but lacking in service consciousness. My friend and I sit in a corner. I found it very difficult to attract the server to come. Even to pay the bill, we have to stand up and walk to them to make a payment.  I'm curious how come this restaurant is able to exist in such a long time with this low-quality food.....honestly, I'm quite upset."}
{"text":"Meh.  My husband drags me to tea places for his teaxperiments. I stick with my old favourite Lamont milk cold tea with tapioca. He got oolong with grass jelly. It was ok. Nothing spectacular.  Nothing different from the others.  It was a nice restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been to multiple Ten Ren's.  I ordered a honey milk black tea with tapioca to go. The drink was very good although a bit too sweet. I would love to sit and dine in however, the cooking smell from the kitchen circulates the entire dining area. Service was good.  Would still return as it is in the area and a reliable (I hope) brand.  In terms of beverages, I would probably still prefer this over Tea Shop as it is more consistent with its flavour."}
{"text":"They've some pretty decent lunch combos! Good place to chill (with free wifi) compared to your local Starbucks :) I really like their drinks and snacks as well! Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Drinks: 1/5 Atmosphere: 3.5/5 Service: 3.5/5 Overall experience: 2/5  (1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)  After coming here, I really wished I stayed home and made my own food and drinks. I was not impressed at all.  Ten Ren's Tea Time is a small, fresh, clean establishment with a few tables and bankets to sit on. It's really cozy and the service was pretty quick and friendly. You will find the usual ice tea, ice milk tea, fruit slush, and hot bubble tea that costs around $5-$7. Pretty pricey for a bubble tea drink.   I ordered a \"Hot Plum Green Tea\" ($3) and my bf ordered a \"Hot Green Apple Tea\". I was hoping they would infuse plum into the tea in an inventive way, but all I tasted was an extremely sweet powdery drink. After a few sips I couldn't drink it anymore and neither could my bf. They also serve food such as noodles, rice, and snacks like fish balls. We decided to get their beef noodle soup which was the worst idea ever. It was salty, msg ladden, and greasy. There wasn't a lot of noodles, but I did enjoy the soft beef brisket.  Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone who wants bubble tea. Will not come back!"}
{"text":"Came in here to order some takeout. Ordered green tea toast but the result was pretty disappointing. The toast was hard and instead of baking it with the matcha powder, it was slabbed on like a jam (see picture). Bubble tea was also pretty disappointing. Got the original milk green tea. It tasted more like those tea you get served in regular Chinese restaurants, with two spoons of milk. Honestly if they keep this up, I wouldn't be surprised when they are taken out by the competitors."}
{"text":"I went last night to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday. Everything was fantastic from the second we walked in. I highly recommend this happening beautiful location. So much to choose from and very affordable. I will share my pics. Pity I didn't take pics of what we ate .. Boy was it delicious"}
{"text":"-Not a fan of the pearls, taste like herb medicine. - Service was fast.  Personally i would only go to Ten Rens is when i am craving for bubble tea and not wanting to go all the way downtown or my other favorite bubble tea place."}
{"text":"Fiancee wanted to take me here since 168 down the street doesn't take credit cards and we were both fresh out of fold-able currency. I ordered a Nutella Chocolate Tea which wasn't too bad, just needed less of a dark chocolate flavor and more hazelnut.  Service was a little slow since we were sitting in the corner table and not really visible, but nothing too horrifying happened this trip. As we were leaving the food that was sprawled about different tables looked tasty, will have to give it a shot sometime."}
{"text":"This place has been around for a long time.  I think I've been coming here for at least 10 years.  Not frequent though... I'd come probably once a year and happy to see it's still there.   The inside has gone through so much renovation. I remembered they used to have a more traditional look with wooden furnitures but this time around the decor had become more modern and the menu was slightly altered.   There are a few new items. I had the mango icee and was happy to discover that I got to have both pudding and tapioca in it.  I also ordered the Taiwanese sausage rice with tea egg... the taste is pretty authentic. the service was slow but the waitresses were attentive.   It's always a nostalgic place for me coz it grew up with me"}
{"text":"Great place to chill with friends and have a nice cup of tea.  Pros: the meals here are great. Average price $8.99~10.99 for one person. Teas are tasty. You can get $3 off when you buy a meal and a drink at the same time.  Cons: it's very expensive to just buy a drink, $5.79 ~ 7.19, not precisely."}
{"text":"Worst bubble tea place ever. Ordered four slushes.. All with pearls. Wasn't slushy just really watery. And 2/4 of the drinks did not have pearls in them.   Won't be returning any time soon. This establishment always disappoints."}
{"text":"Ok wrong location for the review.  This location is actually subpar versus the one in markham.  They had very little in the menu available and served the teas in a to go cup.  I will most likely not return.  For those that want ten ren, you must go to the one on 111 times avenue in markham."}
{"text":"I love bubble tea. But the bubble tea tasted like diluted water.  So if you want water, go here. If not, go somewhere else, like Sharetea."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner on 12 April 2018 and we were greeted and given a table right away.  The staff were friendly and the food came quickly, hot and delicious.  My husband ordered the Braised Beef Brisket in Oyster Sauce and he enjoyed it.  I ordered the Tea flavoured Sausage & Minced Pork with Egg.  Plenty of sausages, minced pork with rice along with a delicious tasting sauce and one fully cooked brown egg.  The atmosphere was pleasant so we will be back."}
{"text":"I like this place for fresh fruit and pearls. Pricey but tasty. If you need a bubble tea fix, try this."}
{"text":"Great bubble tea and yummy snack-type food.  Good place to hang out with friends in the evening.  However, the service is crappy, so be sure the waiter/waitress knows exactly what you want when you order."}
{"text":"My review is strictly for this location only. I usually order the real taro milk tea from Highway 7 location and it has always been pretty good. It was my first time getting the same drink from here. The cashier charged me a premium for ordering the \"real taro\" which is reasonable cuz thats what they do on Hwy 7 as well. However, I saw him used the taro powder mixed a little bit of tiny taro for my drink........ Excuse me?! I paid a premium for the real taro but you used 80% powder!?!!  You can also tell by looking at the color of my drink. Powder taro is more purple-ish where the real taro is a little darker.   I hate businesses that are dishonest with the products they make/ sell."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon for lunch with some friends, the place was empty around noon but once it hits 1pm, the place is packed, all tables were occupied. The place is very small to begin with and only 2 servers working.   We ordered 3 drinks and a lunch combo, the drinks came fast but the food took forever, seems like there was only 1 person working in the kitchen. We ordered cold mango yogurt drink, cold regular bubble tea and a hot tea. The drinks were very disappointing, especially for the price which they charge. Cheapest drink you can find on the menu is $5, but that's just plain small size bubble tea. For that price there's way more choices for the quality you get. Toppings are $1 extra. The mango yogurt drink tasted like mango syrup in ice, it was very disappointing. The regular bubble tea was nothing special but for that price, I can easily get better elsewhere. Also the hot drink was nothing impressing either.  The food came on a small plate where everything is little in portion. Definitely felt more like a snack than a lunch because it was not filling at all! Taste of the food was just average, not worth the price paid for it!  The servers were nice but as it got busier, service became poor and slow.   Would not come back again for food or drinks just not worth the money!!!"}
{"text":"She Who Probably Won't Be Nicknamed has found herself in a \"friends with benefits\" relationship with an ex bf. She believes he's had some earth shattering pain in his life and this is keeping him from truly, truly loving her. Patience, love, caring, a little of the old yi-ha-ride-em-skipper will get him out of his sorrow and they can finally be the power couple she imagines. Personally, I think he's just using her until a woman he thinks he truly deserves comes along.   Ah the lies we tell ourselves.  Can I talk She Who Probably Won't Be Nicknamed off the ledge over bubble tea? Unlikely. But I've got nothing else to do on a Friday night. And I like bubble tea. I've semi walked past this Ten Ren place a hundred times on my way to Second Cup in the Empress Walks sort of mall. It's busy at 8 pm in a way Tea Shop 168 isn't busy. There are no giant baby bottles with stuffed animals on sale at Ten Ren (how drunk or whipped or both do you have to be?).   Service seemed good. Nothing really distinguished this place. I think Tea Shop 168's windowed corner location offers a better view of the street."}
{"text":"Actually really enjoy this ten ren. Ample seating, good service, great drinks and food.   Tried the minced pork and sausage bowl. Really tasty and filling, a large portion for just $9. Lots of flavour. I would eat it again.  Also had the taro coconut slush with tapioca. Pretty much chugged it, was my type of drink.  Overall a solid restaurant in an area with lots of quality."}
{"text":"Decent tea place with the usual bubble drinks, teas and coffees.   Menu is large and plentiful with pricing for a drink hovering $6 on average.   Service is good and sitting area is small but intimate.   Great place to go with family and friends for chatting and hanging out.   On the downside there is a $5 minimum charge so if you don't order and just hang out you are out of luck.   Not bad for a suburban tea place."}
{"text":"Ten Ren's seems like one of the \"go-to\" places in Yonge/Finch (or Empress, if you're going to be more specific).  I used to go here a lot before the other little restaurants started popping up.  Don't get me wrong, the food here is great.  I love their Taiwanese cuisine there.  However, I find their bubble tea wayyyy overpriced comparatively speaking to the other places in and about Toronto.  Service-wise?  I'm not too impressed.  People there are a bit rude."}
{"text":"I like the bubble tea and occasionally go here for that.    Read the service policy.  who would actually go there to sit down for that kind of poor service?"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. If didn't live so far south I would be here all the time! Amazing authentic Taiwanese food, great prices and yummy milk tea and bubble teas."}
{"text":"Food was good, kind of pricey. Drinks were okay. Service was sloppy (dropped our drinks). Would probably just order take-out if I was really craving for BBT and was in the area."}
{"text":"So I must start by saying that the majority of these pictures reflect the Ten Ren's location in Thornhill.  Had I known, I probably would have snapped some pictures at my visit today :).    This is my favourite location amongst all the Ten Ren's.  I find that their portion size is reasonable and their bubble tea is the best amongst all the other locations.  I find that a lot of Ten Ren's (and other BBT places), use \"powdered\" tea.  For some reason, that powdered tea tastes more like milk than tea and very very sugary.  The tea they have at this location, you can actually taste the tannins (albeit very subtle) and the tea here isn't overwhelmingly sweet.    Some of my favourite small dishes here include the \"Yian Shu Jie/Yeem So Gai\" (salty fried chicken) and the Taiwanese sausages.  A word of warning for both these dishes though, they are only good if you sit there and eat it when it's scalding hot.  I've tried take-away on multiple occasions and it just isn't that good anymore.    They also have a variety of \"tea-flavoured\" dishes - but I don't actually ever taste the tea flavour in them.  Nevertheless, they are still good.  There is a minced pork rice that is a must try.    A lot of their meals come with a green/red(black) tea but you can upgrade to a bubbletea if you wish.  Their daily specials come with the tea but no dessert.  Their lunches on their menu come with a dessert, which is usually a pudding of some sort with evaporated milk.    Service on the many times that I've gone is decent and dishes come in a timely manner."}
{"text":"I can't say that I know much about Taiwanese food or even bubble tea, but my taste buds have been quite happy the two or three times I've been here. If it's busy, it gets very loud and the tables are so cramped and close together that you inevitably end up hearing about the next table's love life or medical updates. They should probably take some tables out....  I ordered the Crispy Chicken combo with rice, tofu, and some veggies. It was pretty good, but it came out lukewarm. The BBQ Taiwanese sausage is SO good... Has a nice sweetness to it. To drink, I got the iced Hokkaido milk tea with tapioca, and was surprised to see that I was charged extra for the tapioca... Don't most bubble tea places automatically put tapioca in? Strange. Anyway, the tea was very milky and creamy, which I think is how it's supposed to be, but it was a bit much for me.  Lunch for my friend and I came to $40 with tax and tip."}
{"text":"Nice cozy little place for bubble tea. The food is actually pretty good quality & tasty. The bubble tea is yummy. Tried their icecream dessert with mango & it was really tasty."}
{"text":"This Ten Ren's is attached to the Empress Walk building, and the entrance is on Empress Ave.   Nine of us came here after dinner one Saturday evening and it was fairly empty. This place is very bright inside which can be annoying to those who are sensitive to lights.  My partner and I ordered a flavoured milk tea with tapioca, mango slush with lychee jelly, the garlic brick toast and Taiwanese fried chicken (like popcorn chicken). The total cost was about $28 something plus gratuity. The place felt like a cafeteria and the drinks did not come in glass cups, but in plastic takeout cups.  The food was okay, but the portions are small, considering the price. I was told that the milk tea wasn't very good; however, you can ask for less sugar if you prefer. The mango slush was great, same as it always has been since I first tried Ten Ren's many years ago!  Because this place is abnormally bright for a bubble tea joint, I'm not sure I would enjoy sitting there for a long period. Perhaps takeout would be my choice."}
{"text":"Compared to 168 down the street, Ten Ren's is smaller, smellier, and more crowded. The food is pretty much the same, maybe a little bit better. The tables are small and not ideal for studying and there are no games! (I sound like a seven-year-old, don't I?) The only reason I ever come here is if my friends want to come here (because some of us are 168 people, and some of us are Ten Ren's fans). If I am forced to come, I always get one of the horoscope teas. They are the only thing I can get at Ten Ren's that isn't offered at 168 that I like enough. They're rather pricy because they're iced and come with a scoop of ice cream on top, as well as sometimes some green tea powder."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this spot years ago, so I walked in with fond memories. I was disappointed with the food quality. Portions were small and meat was dry. the stewed chicken tasted like kt sag in the stew all day. The fried pork chop was also dry as if its been refried. Vegetables were also bland.   The place also went through some disappointing renovations. I will never go back again.   I'm only giving it 2 stars instead of 1 because of the service. The server was very attentive and polite."}
{"text":"I think the manager should teach employees how to treat customers. I ordered a meal, they are mean they even don't offer me a bottle of water. Btw the food tastes so bad. Tips are set, 15% of your purchase. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I like the food here, especially the chicken cutlet (tender & tasty), the deep fried fish (generous portion and never fishy... you know what I mean!) and the Taiwanese sausage (can be ordered on it's own or comes with the minced pork on rice with tea egg.)  Meals come with tea, but you can upgrade to a specialty beverage for a nominal amount (usually less than $2).  My favourites include the Earl Grey milk tea (a surprisingly hard to find b-tea flavour) and the green tea slush, which I normally order 1/2 sugar so that it is less sweet.  Also, the meals come with a mini dessert, usually a small square of mango pudding served with evaporated milk.  Sometimes the server forgets to bring it, but I don't mind asking for it.  Our experience with the servers has been positive: they seem nice and speak English.  It can get noisy (especially with the sound of the blender) but I do enjoy seeing other people's orders, as the beverage menu is quite extensive.  You can request a to-go cup if you do not finish your beverage, or if you don't plan to stay long.  [Based on 6+ visits during various times]"}
{"text":"Came here tonight wanting something sweet. I really shouldn't be so lazy; and should make drinks at home instead.  I ordered a \"ice kumquat lemon green tea\" with pearl and the bf ordered a \"ice wheat germ milk tea\" with pearl. I was pleasantly surprised that my drink came out exactly as it should be, albeit the pearls with a bit soft for my taste. I don't think one can mess up syrup and tea right? The wheat germ was very chunky and diluted. Not enough flavor in it at all.   I found the prices a bit steep for the quality of the drinks. If you're looking for a quick basic tea drink I would suggest you just make one at home... not worth the visit at all."}
{"text":"Not the best place for bubble tea, it's mediocre. However, it is more efficient to go to for anyone in NW near Panatella as the other well known bubble tea places are generally in Chinatown. Prices are similar to their places, around $5 for a fruit slush.  Their Taiwanese chicken is pretty good though!"}
{"text":"The Rolls Royce of bubble teas. Tapioca aka pearls aka boba are always in perfect form, plus aloe jellies and green tea pudding are great adds. Taro milk tea, sesame hot milk tea (not too sweet!) and mango black tea are all favorites. And there's actually a place to sit down!  I've knocked one point because the girls there scoff when I ask for a hot Storm, which is a mixture of coconut and taro (don't quote me). They refuse to serve some specialty mixed drinks hot for policy reasons, even though one could order hot versions of either flavor.  Tip: ask for the loyalty punch card-- it's good only for takeout."}
{"text":"It's a little loud and the atmosphere is not as good as the good ol days but ten rens still is a great place to get a damn good bubble tea. It is easily accessible from the subway and by car. The wait time is usually not that bad. Not great for kids or conversation but a good hangout spot for teens.   If you want to sit back, relax, have some good drinks, and alcohol isn't your thing, go to ten rens!   3 stars because it's not spectacular. Just pretty standard bubble tea"}
{"text":"Came here with some friends on a Sunday evening. It wasn't busy and we were able to find a seat asap.   The main dishes were affordable. But I found the drinks to be overpriced. Almost $7 for a drink...I should save my room for Chatime! Thankfully because you order a meal, it's automatically $3.50 or so off any drink so that was fine. I ordered the Creamy Chicken Noodle Soup. It was alright. I thought they could have added more chicken though. Lots of noodles.   I'll come back if we are in the area again. Not because the food/drinks are amazing but out of convenience.   Free Wifi"}
{"text":"Worst bubble tea ever. I just ordered a fresh taro slush and there were hardly any pearls in a watered down, non slushy drink. Did not taste like any other taro bubble teas I've had before, didn't taste like much actually. My husband had the watermelon lychee slush and was just as terrible.  Watered down sugar syrup with little slush and barely any pearls.  That's probably why they use opaque cups so you can't see how little pearls they use.  Just too bad because we live so close and I would love a good bubble tea shop near by but I would rather drive close to downtown to Bubblemania."}
{"text":"Review: lunch.  We needed to satisfy our craving for BBT and this cafe was the closest to us.  Bottomline: the BBT was a hit or miss. Food tasted homemade. Would not recommend dining in.  Atmosphere: not sure if we caught them in some sort of transition, but the place was not very tidy. There were boxes and giant signs everywhere and the manager (or owner?) had his paperwork and laptop out in one of the booths. It felt like we were eating in a warehouse. Service was good.  Food: we ordered the Taiwanese fried chicken rice bowl, the minced pork fried noodles, ice king milk tea, and the matcha ice cream green tea BBT. While the matcha ice cream BBT tea was awesomely delicious, the rest was just mediocre. The milk tea had a strong tea flavor but lacking the fragrance. The minced pork fried noodles weren't actually stir fry or deep fried, but rather boiled. The Taiwanese fried chicken was flavored okay, but came with mixed veggies seemingly from the frozen aisle.  Value: average to above average price for what you are getting. Depends on what you are ordering."}
{"text":"got the taro slush and milk custard toast and crispy chicken. both were really delicious, and the service and atmosphere here was nice.   it was a little chilly though, not sure if it was just because today was super cold or if it was the tea shop.   their menus are also adorable:) it was a great place and id definitely come back"}
{"text":"This restaurant is ok. I've been there plenty of times for drinks (mostly because my friends like it there and it's pretty close to the Cineplex) and all the time I was almost satisfied. I've tried their food few times. In many instances the taste was OK (nothing memorably good) but the portions are pretty small. Quality varies.  Last time I went for food, they gave me a dish that was rice soup + chicken + vegetables. First two parts were OK as usual, but the vegetable part was awfully horrible. Seems like they put all the vegetable bottoms in there (the part that they probably should have thrown out) and it tasted really odd. Even the waitress felt that oddity when she was serving the food and started explaining that the cooks told her that it's a kind of alleged bok choy, but she couldn't finish her sentence (showing that she didn't know what she was talking about - probably because she wasn't explained by the cooks properly that wth was that). She was like: \"the cook said it's kind of bok choy, but umm... I don't know... um...\"  I usually don't send back servings to the kitchen (maybe because I'm a bit shy when it comes to that), so I just accepted it and tried to finish my rice soup and chicken. Thinking back, maybe I should have really sent it back this time.  Realizing that cooks there treat their customers like an idiot and try to justify their poorly made food with not even a proper explanation to what it was makes me not to go there anymore. It felt like they thought \"OK this guy probably wouldn't care/question what he's eating, so let's just put whatever in his dish and it'll be alright...\")  Not to mention every time I go there, my shirt gets smelly (that doesn't happen with other restaurants) which shows the bad restaurant set up and probably non-standard ingredients in their food... My friends admit that too.  I gave them two and not one star because their drink is good, but the mentality that I think was behind the last food really disappointed me."}
{"text":"Midnight dinner for eight ... and the staff was so helpful in helping us figure out the perfect bubble tea to match our meal. I enjoyed the King's Tea Pork Ribs Noodle meal combo which I upgraded to a hibiscus bubble tea (it comes with plain green tea). The combo meal was finished off with a generous slice of mango pudding with evaporated milk. Yum!"}
{"text":"We came here in a group of 6 hungry after a volleyball game loss eager for some bubble tea and taiwanese food. I've had quite the experience with bubble tea chains and I always expect Ten Ren to be a lot better than the other chains like Tea Shop 168 or Destiny's because of the fact that they use real fruits and juices rather than just powder. However, the service is pretty awful here, the food is mediocre (portions are quite small) and the price is INFLATED and definitely not worth the asking price for most drinks.  As I said before there are 3 main components you look for in a bubble tea shop. The ambiance here is quite nice with decorated walls and nice wooden chairs sort of like a \"Chinese Tea\" theme going on. The place is quite loud however and crowded as it is not quite that comfy compared to couches that are found in most bubble tea stores nowadays. The service is crap (honestly, I'm sometimes ashamed to be chinese with so many chinese owned restaurants showing absolutely horrible service). It is a trend for bubble tea restaurants to just have horrible service. The waitress never smiled once, gave one of my friends rice instead of noodles (or maybe it was her fault), and even after confirming our question if whether or not dinners come with desserts or not, STILL didn't give us our desserts!   Now I said there were 3 main things to look for, ambiance, service and noise level but I'd like to mention one other thing with Ten Ren. The price. Bubble tea and food here is more expensive than your typical Tea Shop 168 and is supposedly \"better\". However, the drinks here are nothing more spectacular than the drinks at Tea Shop 168. My Coconut - Taro mix  with tapioca was $6 and the first thing I noticed was that I couldn't taste any taro! It tasted just like canned coconut juice and worst of all the tapioca and the drink was somewhat warm! Not to mention I finished the drink in barely 6 sips, waste of $6.   Do not be fooled by the overpriced bubble tea here. It is nothing better than any other bubble tea and the environment here is not the greatest. You are not paying more for quality, you are just simply paying more because the entire chain charges more and they occasionally put a scoop or ice cream on your drink. Between this and Tea Shop 168 down the road I would choose Tea Shop just because it is less crowded, less noisy, and most importantly it is cheaper than the overpriced specials they have here. Honestly, if you were to catch up with a friend or hang out with a group of friends, hit a cafe or a coffee shop where the prices are much lower and the service and environment are tenfolds better than places like here. I only recommend this place if you really want bubble tea and taiwanese style food."}
{"text":"I was in the North York area and had to go to my favourite  bubble tea place, Ten Ren's of course! Unlike all the other Ten Ren's eat-in locations this one is a lot smaller located at Empress Walk.  There no free parking. There's street metre parking or there's also a green P parking right  across the street.  We went on a Saturday so the place was packed. My aunt ran in and got us bubble teas to go while I waited in the car. The quality of my Lichee green tea with double tapioca is just as good as always.  Ten Ren's does not disappoint!  Only reason why I took off 1 star is because you have to pay for parking!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner after a hardcore study session for a bowl of hot noodles. I ordered the Creamy Pork Soup w/ Noodles and it was a pretty good deal for $8.   So... my verdict on these noodles were a mixture of good and bad. The soup was not all that creamy as it claimed it to be instead, it was just thick and \"creamy\" due to the starch. I would admit that they gave a generous amount of pork, cabbage and noodles. I enjoyed the noodles, they were not soggy but very tender however, the pork... I gotta question. I believe it was pork blended with some kind of substance to make it very starchy and tender and also, with black peppers. It definitely looked odd and it didn't taste exactly like pure pork... Overall, it was OK. It made me full and warmed my body up for cold weather.   I would like to try their other items on the menu before concluding how I really think about this place. For now, it stands at an A-OK 3-stars for me until I repay them a visit again."}
{"text":"I haven't actually tried anything with tea here, but I do love the strawberry banana horoscope slush. This Ten Ren's actually includes a scoop of ice cream on top.  I've tried the waffles and shaved ice but they didn't stand out to me. I am a sucker for the custard milk toast though, mmm."}
{"text":"Living where I live I have tons and I mean tones of places to go for bubble tea. My friend introcuced me to this hidden gem located on a side street off of yonge. I normally just passed by because unless you know its their its not noticable. The reason my friend brought me here was because he said they use high quality ten tea. He was right! I could taste the different, the flavours are crisp/strong/ and fresh and I like the fact they dont use powder.  I also enjoy the fact they have a points card so it makes me feel like I should be loyal to them only as I will get something in return. I think that was a brillent idea as there is so much competation in and around the neighbourhood.   Everytime I go I order my drink for take out. I do always notice people filling up just over 50 percent of the place. That shows me either the food is great, the service is great or both. I plan on going and taking my time while dining in one day or enjoying a late night bubble tea while relaxing in their zen filled resturant. Either way you will hear about it."}
{"text":"Today I ordered the strawberry hibiscus green tea slush. The picture they have really does not match the product. For one there are no mint leaves and if there are any hibiscus it's likely either blended to extinction or its powdered either way I don't see them like I used to see at Green Grotto back when they used to have it.   In addition I ordered their creamy crispy chicken noodle soup.  The soup was very peppery I couldn't really enjoy it. At least I didn't feel the presence of MSG and the chicken was still crispy. Though the noodles didn't absorb the broth too well and tasted pretty bland.   Also I wanted to ask for a to go cup from the waitress after she took my friends drink order and instead she just snubbed and left.   The only reason I come here is because my coworker has a VIP card otherwise I wouldn't even bother.  But seriously we asked for the bill at least five minutes ago and we still haven't gotten it. I even finished the drink I was drinking so I didn't even need the take out cup.  Guess the quality of waitress they choose are based on eye candy (though still not that hot anyway) rather than skills."}
