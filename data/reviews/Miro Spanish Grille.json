{"text":"We went this weekend to Miro Spanish Grille. We brought a large wine bottle and were told that the corking fee was $40. We felt that was a hefty price for a corking fee.   Previously they charged $20. This is highway robbery to charge that much for corking fee.  It is better not to allow to bring your own wine. We decided to order a pitcher of sangria which was mediocre, there was hardly any fruits in the sangria.  The paella and all our other entrees were delicious.  
This situation dampened our evening."}
{"text":"The service was great. This was a first time visit to celebrate our anniversary and Jose went above and beyond to make our evening special. We went for the paella and his suggestions for everything from wine through dessert was spot on. All his suggestions were delicious and the perfect pairings. We definitely will be planning a return trip soon"}
{"text":"Their Tres Leches is the most amazing dessert on the planet. So good!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. Make a reservation. Favorite starters are gambas al ajillo and the croquettes. The Zarzuela is delicious. Save room for the tres leches. It will change your life."}
{"text":"Excellent food, I've never had a bad meal here, and I have been going to Miro since it was located on Kings Dr near Morehead 20 years ago.  Staff are always helpful.  The Tres Leches is a MUST!"}
{"text":"My wife and I just love this place!  5 stars is not enough!   The Paella is amazing. The Tapas are the best in charlotte too Kelly"}
{"text":"Miro is an authentic Spanish restaurant, conveniently located in Ballantyne near I-485. Fortunately, they have a large waiting area as weekends are very busy. We are usually seated promptly as we always make reservations online.the bar appears to be a hoppin' place although we only go for dinner.
The wait-staff is excellent! Friendly, accommodating and attentive. 
The food is good. Portions are a bit on the small side, though always tasty.
We have not ordered the paella, but have seen it arrive at adjoining tables and it appears to be hot, generous and yummy.
Prices are steep for the portions received. A slightly larger portion of \"Spanish rice\" with the entrees would make a huge difference. Bread is always served with the meal and the bottles of cold water are a nice touch."}
{"text":"The food and service were excellent. There were four of us and two had the Paella Valenciana and 2 had the Zarzuela de Mariscos. We all loved our meals. Only problem is that the restaurant is too loud, as it seems most are these days. This has been a problem at Mrio since they moved from Stonecrest to this location. When they first opened here, they said they knew it was too loud and that they were experimenting with sound treatments. If so, none have been very effective.

We'll still go back for the food, but not immediately."}
{"text":"Went here many years ago and weren't impressed, but saw great reviews here & on Trip Advisor so we decided to give it another try. Don't bother! Can't understand why this place gets such good reviews - it's better than fast food, but it isn't a great restaurant by any means.  So disappointed.
Had a 7:45 reservation - still waited 25 minutes to be seated even though those who arrived after us were seated before us. The young women at the hostess stand were clearly out of their depth and didn't seem to know how to handle the waiting diners. Quite unprofessional. Mumbled responses to our questions; no eye contact; no apology for the wait. We told the restaurant when we made the reservation that this was a birthday, but no one ever acknowledged it.

Had a pretty good table, but so-so service until after they brought the check, at which time Tomas & Jose were ready to be our best friends. To be fair, Jose was much more attentive than Tomas. Ordered Sangria, which was ok, but even the waiter admitted that the bar no longer added brandy, a usual ingredient in Sangria. Had patatas bravas for an app - just ok. Have had them in Asheville & Puerto Rico and these were not as crunchy or spicy as they should have been. Ordered the carne paella (meat instead of fish). Paella is known for it's crusty rice crust on the bottom of the pan - no crust, no char. It was generic meat & chicken on somewhat bland Spanish rice. I don't know if they dial down the spices for the masses, but some \"nuke food\" has a better flavor profile. Prices were ok, but I'd gladly pay more for food with flavor & good service.  Now we know why we haven't been here in years; won't go back."}
{"text":"This is a favorite place to dine.  Food is always good and the tres leche is to die for!  Even better than the food is the service.  The wait staff is top notch and will go out of their way to make sure you have a great experience!"}
{"text":"This was the first time for me. The hostess seemed disappointed I was by myself and sat me at a booth. The waiter was a real jerk, copped an attitude right away! Ordered a white wine listed on the wine list and he argued that it was really a red and brought  red to me anyway! The fisherman's stew tasted like it was made from frozen seafood was OK but expected better!  I wouldn't recommend  this place to a sick dog! Definitely innately won't be back!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious restaurant!  I went here with my Grandmother.  Very good food!  I look forward to going again!  I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We went for a birthday celebration this past Saturday because we have done that before. But this time it was different. As in the past we took our own bottle of wine and expected to pay a small corking fee. We were all very surprised when our server said because we had a large bottle the fee would be forty dollars. We all felt that the fee was outrageous so our wine stayed unopened. I guess the fee is to dissuade you from bringing your own wine."}
{"text":"I don't know which was better-the food or the service!! Both AMAZING! I rarely post reviews but felt compelled to post for Miro! Fabulous"}
{"text":"The service was amazing! I ordered the small paella & it was delicious. The tres de leche & pineapple upside down cheesecake was absolutely amazing! The food came out in a timely manner as well. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Authentic Spanish cuisine in a trendy yet intimate restaurant. Highly recommend the paella and tres leches. Wine list also appears to be top notch."}
{"text":"Amazing service, tapas/small plates lots of variety, langoustine, calamari, pork, yumm!
We shared a large Paella, that was so tasty and perfectly seasoned. The patio is lovely this time of year."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and I looooove their paella.   I've had relaxing tapas and wine at the bar and I've also had full course sit-down meals.  I'm never disappointed here.  I highly recommend reservations as this is a small venue and very popular.  
Let's talk  more about the paella.  Oh my goodness -yum!  it's perfectly seasoned, so full of wonderful seafood and such a generous portion (you can order a smaller portion, but then you wouldn't have a doggie bag for later!). They also have a very similar stew version of the paella which is equally amazing.  
I've forced my way onto other people's plates (at my table, not strangers.  but don't think I'm not tempted!) and can absolutely tell you everything is cooked to perfection - fish, pork, meats, apps all of it. The waitstaff is fantastic and knows the menu well but they can work a little bit on the friendliness of the teenage/young person hostesses.  I would love to see a couple more options on the wine list, or maybe just different labels?  
The pic of the shrimps were very lightly cooked in garlic, oil and paprika.  Simple ingredients, done well.  The empanadas are very tasty too, but I'm more familiar with Central American style but my boys think they're great!"}
{"text":"good food great service .... definitely a big Fan now :)"}
{"text":"Delicious! A little fast on the courses. Excellent service and loved the mojito! I had the beren jenas--eggplant with red sauce-- great flavor, not overdone. Started with piqillos- with manchego cheese and roasted red peppers. Love the Spanish flavors!"}
{"text":"I received a medium well  steak. Informed the waiter that I ordered it medium rare. He took it away and then brought the plate back and informed me that the chef said i was wrong. ..."}
{"text":"This past Saturday evening, my husband and I tried Miro Spanish Grille for the first time and I have to say that our experience was terrific!  We had a 7:15 reservation and showed up about 10 minutes early.  We were greeted warmly and told to take a seat while they got our table ready.  It was just a few minutes of waiting before we were taken to our table just minutes prior to our actual reservation time.  The restaurant is small, but very modern and comfortable inside.  Our waiter was not overly friendly, but attentive at the right times and very efficient.  As for the food, everything we tried was wonderful!  We got the calamari for an appetizer and they were able to do half fried and half grilled, very tasty.  Each of us then got a salad which were both good, but the entrees are what stole the show.  I got the seafood stew and it was so good!  Loaded with calamari, shrimp, scallops, fish and half a lobster tail, and the sauce!  YUM!  My husband got the beef short ribs and also very much enjoyed his meal. I wish I had saved room for dessert because that dessert tray that caught my eye looked fabulous!  I will for sure being having dessert next time we go back.  I would recommend this restaurant or a date night, family or friends to go meet up."}
{"text":"Worst first impression ever. Party of 2 and was told 15 minutes. Almost 45 minutes later the hostess sat people that came in after us. Will never come back"}
{"text":"Reserved a table for four at 7:15 Saturday night. Weren't seated until 8:05. Walk-ins were being seated in front of us."}
{"text":"Went for a business lunch with 8 guests. Beautiful restaurant in an unexpected location next to Earthfare. Upscale casual environment, could work great for a date night or workplace lunch. Servers were very friendly and knowledgeable. Service was pretty quick and food presentation was beautiful. Excellent value at lunch - most entrees between $9-$12 and HUGE portions. Something for everyone - tapas, seafood, chicken, pasta, vegetarian. And the dessert tray is LOADED with choices including delicious flan. Highly recommended. (Only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because they were a little awkward bringing out our dishes. Several people got served first and there was quite a delay before the other entrees arrived. It was awkward at a business lunch since everyone wanted to wait until we were all served. But meanwhile their food was getting cold!)"}
{"text":"I have been to Miro many times over the last three years at both their Stonecrest location and their present location.  The food and service has been consistently superb.  I usually order the Mallorquinas, and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"5- customer service (our waiter Alejandro was excellent.. He made a great recommendation on a white wine and was able to have my paella custom made with chorizo and chicken instead of clams and calamari.. He also surprised my gilfriend with desert for her birthday.
5- drinks ( Marques de Caceres, white wine)
5- main course ( Paella was perfectly cooked and seasoned)
5- ambiance ( perfectly lighted, and nice layout)
5- desert ( tres leches was moist and airy)
5- price ( reasonably priced and good portions)"}
{"text":"This was a recent find as I was walking out of Earth Fare, one that I would have never known was there otherwise. This is about the nicest group of restaurant staff -- very accommodating -- I've ever met and the food is amazing and fairly priced. There is a lot of variety on the menu and service is quick and with a smile. Had the Tile Fish special and was in heaven. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food was good, but  what is the point to made reservation in advance if you have to wait anyway, I did a reservation 4 days in advance for  Friday 8:00pm  we arrived a 7:45, they  gave us a page and  we were not sitting until 8:45, no even at a table it was at  the bar, they did not care, making excuses that table was almost ready. next to us was a couple that  came before us, she was pregnant looks like she was going to have the baby there, we were sitting and the still eating to be seating. They did not  care about it."}
{"text":"Last nigh at Miro: Grilled Calamari - delicious, Zarzuela de Mariscos - excellent, the only time I regretted  that I don't eat much bread and had nothing to deep into that tomato base broth, (the bread was offered by the server btw). But that allowed me to save room for their desert - Tres Leches house cake was airy, with a creamy top, must have! Great experience."}
{"text":"Just moved to Charlotte from DC and speaking as a foodie, this place has authenticity! Great atmosphere, fantastic appetizers! I've been here twice and brought friends visiting from LA and even they were impressed. Must pair with their sangria...amazingless ! Can't go wrong :)"}
{"text":"I got the \"Entrecote con Chimichurri\" NY strip steak which came topped with a chimichurri sauce and was served with a small side of garlic mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes were forgettable but the strip steak and chimichurri is making my mouth water while typing. The steak was tender, juicy, thick, cooked beautifully, and the chimichurri was abundantly flavorful.

Ella got the \"Carne de las costillas cortas\" oven braised beef short ribs in white wine with potatoes and carrots, topped with a natural al jus and served with sautéed green beans. The braised beef was incredibly soft and pulled apart with the greatest of ease. What we loved most about this dish was the combination of bold colors on the plate and the the balance of fresh veggies with the braised short ribs.

The couple sitting next to us was so intrigued with all of the photos I had been taking of our food that they offered their food up for the photo spotlight. I never got a chance to taste their dish (Vieiras Chilindron Sautéed scallops topped with fresh tomatoes and peppers sauce, served with seasoned white rice) but it looked gorgeous. Unfortunately (for me) I just cant bring myself to like seafood and if these were the best scallops in the world... they would be wasted on my palate.

Miro Spanish Grille was absolutely delicious and an easy recommendation for South Charlotte."}
{"text":"Good Tapas in the Ballantyne area. If you get there before 7, you will not have to wait for too long.
The pulpo Gallegos was really tasty. The Langotinos shrimp and the scallop were slightly above average. The Paella Valencia was good. It would better if they use a fresher seafoods."}
{"text":"Soooooo delicious!  For two native Charlotteans who have eaten out every weekend for about 20 years, we get tired of the same ole Southparky overdescribed, undercreative and overpriced wine and food.  Miro is different and delicious! The atmosphere is warm and cozy and the staff friendly and quick. We had the seafood specials and a delicious tomato and goat cheese salad. We also had empananas and an amazing dessert. The paella looked amazing...that's next on the list. Can't wait to go back.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"First visit with friends this weekend. Walked in and the atmosphere was nice and food smelled delicious. I suggest you make a reservation it was very busy. Sangria is very good. Good came out quickly and you could taste how fresh the ingredients are. Service was fast and attentive. Nice little spot, so glad we tried it."}
{"text":"The best food in all of Charlotte. 

Make a reservation, it's always crowded at dinner time. Especially on the weekends. 

Must try: patatas bravas & pulpo appetizer, paella & red snapper entrees, tres leches for dessert & \"strong\" sangria to drink (which adds brandy). 

They used to always add brandy to the sangria, I'm sad to see it's not the norm anymore, but glad it's still an option for a slight upcharge. 

Their cappuccinos and other dessert drinks are also divine. 

Hands down the best food and service. If you can, ask for Juan Carlos as your server. He's the very best!"}
{"text":"We went to the new location this past weekend and it was much better than the last time we ate here.

The restaurant is way nicer and brighter than before, which I liked.  The servers were super nice and friendly.

Three of us ordered the mahi mahi special and it was delicious.  We all loved it.  It was perfectly cooked and on a bed of spanish rice which was good too.  My husband ordered the lamb and he enjoyed his meal as well.

For dessert, we got the tiramisu and thought it was excellent.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Walked in on a Friday night with a booking for 3. Waited almost 45 minutes before they told us your table is ready because they overbook the place. The wife of the owner comes and tells us table for 3? I was like yes, she was like where is the 3rd person? I was like hes coming.I felt she wanted to keep us waiting for the 3rd person cause she didnt want to lose a table cause she overbooked the place .We sat there and ordered and the 3rd person came and he asked a question on the menu that we already asked before, the waiter said ask your friends, I already explained this.Really?!! We get the Paella and some other plate, and found hair in my food, but I didnt tell my wife cause I knew she would walk out and it will ruin all our night, even if they changed the dishes.The Paella wasnt good anyway, and I think honestly if you knew anything about paella, you wouldnt come to this place.Finally, we order the check and pay, and literally 5 minutes before we left.The wife of the owner, \"the manager\" comes and tell us, hey you guys want to move to the bar?I can order you something there, because I have a party of 16 who have been waiting for an hour.First of all shes lying, cause we ordered and ate and paid in almost 45 minutes, and there wasnt a party of 16 waiting.Secondly, for the first time in my life I see a manager asking a customer to get up from their table that they reserved and ask us to sit on the bar.In addition to that my wife is pregnant so it would be even harder for her.The owner of the place should teach his rude wife how to run a business and treat customers right.Worst place and customer service ever!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness!  This restaurant definitely has a family run restaurant feel with friendly staff.  The food was delicious with many options to please everyone.  Great place to take the family.  The paella is great and the selection of wines compliment the dishes well.  The octopus was another one of my family's favorites."}
{"text":"We had a party of 12 for a company event on a busy Friday night. The service was excellent and the food was delicious. The atmosphere was perfect. The staff was attentive and accommodating.  Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Delicious salmon a la panchos. Excellent and attentive service at lunch. Never disappointed with their tasty well-prepared plates."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place for lunch. I had salmon with spinach. The fish was really fresh and cooked perfectly. The service was amazing. Our waiter always checked on us. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Just ate there for the first time today and it was wonderful. The server was amazing. The atmosphere was great and the food was delicious and fast! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Miro never disappoints! Food was excellent, wine was excellent (ask for bottles not on the menu) service was excellent!!"}
{"text":"We have missed our restaurant and now they have reopened in their new location we found them to be better than ever!

Their salmon is the best in Charlotte. The Paella Valenciana is out of this world. Save room for desert."}
{"text":"So, I've been here a few times and it's honestly nothing special at all. Tonight totally blew my mind. I'm dressed in Nike jogging type pants. And, I noticed when I walked in they looked at me. They say we have a high top near the bar and I said \"no, I want a real table\" - they go on and say well we have a reservation at 6pm, the restaurant is EMPTY! I did not even bother to say a word, I was so angry and I just left."}
{"text":"This is the closest food I've found in Charlotte to tapas in Spain. Went on a Friday night and as expected there was a wait...30 minutes we were told. An hour later we we seated (which is why they lost a star). Once seated the waitress came and discussed options, very friendly and knowledgeable staff. As we were a party of 4 we ordered several tapas to share...everything was well prepared and seasoned. Croquetas was the favorite of the night but the Jamon and Manchego with the warm bread was excellent as well. Muscles and octopus was cooked just right. The only dish that was just ok in our opinion were the empanadas which were nothing special. The Sangria was superb but on the pricey side (30$ a carafe). If they can get the front of the house performance to match the back this place will be a go to for a long time!"}
{"text":"I would have loved to try their food, but when we were seated, the waiter took my daughter and her boyfriend's drink orders and didn't even look in my direction.  It was like I was completely invisible.  When he returned with the water, I said something about his rudeness, and he laughed.   We walked out.  I won't give my business to someone who hires such rude waiters!"}
{"text":"I expected more from this restaurant. I made a reservation for two. It was my birthday and I was expecting a nice experience. They told me I would get a surprise and indeed! My husband and I couldn't finished our dinner because the waiter and a waitress, that were looking at us the hour that we were there, wanted to go home earlier seems, made us feel uncomfortable. Not going back."}
{"text":"Awesome tapas--we had the scallops, tasty in a tomato broth, the shrimp, the Patatas Bravas--my fave, Spanish wine which was amazing! The pork tenderloin was excellent too! Service was friendly and helpful and I cannot wait to go again."}
{"text":"Tried this place out on a Sunday night. It wasn't busy so we got a table very easily. Got bread and butter as soon as we sat down but the bread was not fresh and the butter tasted like it had been left uncovered in the fridge for a long time! Not very nice! Started with the beef empanadas and the fried shrimp. The shrimp was bathed in a delicious sauce and were scrumptious. The empanadas were pretty good too, they were a first for me because I've never had any that have beef mixed with veggies in them. Had the grouper in cream of crab side with corn over it. Was really good but I feel like there should have been more corn and potato. It felt like I was eating a main without a side. 
For dessert had the tres leches that was delicious! Yum! I see myself coming here again and again!"}
{"text":"While in Charlotte on business, I found Miro, and ever since have always enjoyed excellent and authentic Spanish cuisine on a weekly basis (and wine when work schedule permits).  An outstanding venue with both classic and newer dishes from all across Spain.  Really nice music also (a big plus for me).  Note that the paella comes to order (request the seared rice for authenticity).  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"My family loves Miro. Typically my husband orders an entree and my daughter and I share tapas. Everything is delicious and service is top notch. I also highly recommend the sangria."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service! Food was prompt and nice selections of wine. Rafael V was an amazing server and was very pleasant to chat with being a business traveler. He made great recommendations for both entrees and desserts. The Tres Laches is fantastic."}
{"text":"We we there Saturday night with another couple. Food was very good so no complaints there. Service was terrible, they could not wait to turn over the table. Waiter stood against the wall glaring at us. Salad plates, bread plates were removed from table immediately upon finishing. We were not asked if we wanted another drink or if we wanted dessert. Waiter grimaced when we ordered dessert. It was not a relaxing , enjoyable evening. Will not return."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. The ambiance is great. The shrimp appetizers were delicious.  The paella was not very good however. No crust, the rice was mushy and the seafood was over cooked. I will try it again and get something else."}
{"text":"I had an odd dining experience this evening. When going out for tapas, I always think of a relaxed, friendly ambiance. But man, I have not had such brusque service in a while. We ate early and they clearly wanted to turn the table. Taking plates away while I was still eating. Wiping the table before they brought the check. It was weird and discomfiting.

Food was ok overall. Sangria was very good. Seafood tapas were good (garlic shrimp and smoked salmon with avocado). Other tapas were ok (cheese plate, fried plantains, stuffed peppers)."}
{"text":"Ate at the huge bar, had mussels and sausage with tomato and the croquet  appetizers. Friendly, fast service and very nice decor! Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Couldn't be happier we came here.  Service was great and food was exceptional. I had the empanada appetizer and the seafood stew entree, and both were perfect and extremely reasonably priced. Ask for the special hot sauce with the empanadas - it adds a great kick"}
{"text":"Solid paella if you don't know how to make your own but a very decent restaurant you will enjoy."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, and the best lamb ribs. Don't leave this place without trying the sangria."}
{"text":"Favorite Spanish restaurant,great food service,wait staff knowledgeable about menu items. Menu had many great selections,tasty dessert selections. Would recommend"}
{"text":"Staff was kind, but the food wasn't up to par. Calamari (tasted stale), NY Strip (overcooked and dry) and seafood/rice platter (meh.... didn't even finish it) didn't wow us enough to warrant a return."}
{"text":"Great place to indulge with your cravings of Spanish cuisine atmosphere and service are on point. Paella are so flavorful,Tres Leches is out of this world. Everything we ordered are fantastic. I would go back again and again!"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Charlotte! I had the Chilean Sea Bass, and it was great. Also, the Tres Leche cake is a must! It was so light and wonderful."}
{"text":"Great restaurant!  Sangria was a little strong, but if you like it that way, no worries!  I like mine a little sweeter.  The appetizers were excellent, entrees were great, everyone in the party enjoyed their food.  The service was also great, two waiters tag teamed the table and we didn't want for anything.  Will definitely visit again when in Charlotte!  A must try if you like Spanish cuisine."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to dining here, we love Tapas as a rule. The room was very nice and welcoming. The wine we ordered was excellent. Our server did a great job. We were let down by the food. It was all bland and seemingly not seasoned at all. I just can't see coming back here."}
{"text":"I truly loved this place for the longest time. However as they are starting to become busier they now are turning walk ups away when the restraint has empty tables because they have reservations that aren't there yet. Until they either expand the location or start figuring out how to manage their customers we will no longer go back."}
{"text":"Food is quite good as is the service, but you feel like your a sardine in a tin that is too small.
Excellent paella and good service"}
{"text":"Perfect evening out in every way. Excellent food, creative menu, outstanding service and great ambiance."}
{"text":"Amazing tapas! I have been here twice with big groups (15+) and the food were top notch. Service was slow, unusually slow even accounting for the big group. It took them a good 20 minutes to bring out the dessert tray for us to select...food is 5 star, but service could be faster. 

I would recommend coming here with a big group so you can try every single tapa on their menu. My favorites are the manchego cheese, shrimp, potatoes, and the calamari. I have been to Spain multiple times and have tried many different tapas, and Miro does not disappoint. The flavor is on top, not too oily or salty, with the right amount of spices and seasoning that brings back memory of my travels to Spain. 

They also have great wine selection to go with the food as well. 

Also great dessert - although their flan could be better. It didn't stand out and tasted the same as any other flan I could buy."}
{"text":"We came in for early dinner on Saturday night. The place was packed but we found a hightop next to the bar. Really nice atmosphere and very friendly service. Our waitress Femia was excellent.
I had the seafood paella (\"small\" size - more than enough for one person) and my wife had the grilled salmon. Both were cooked to perfection and very tasty. We had the empanadas for appetizer, which were also very good. 
Prices are very reasonable. Great experience, we are definitely coming back!.."}
{"text":"I have lived in Charlotte my whole life and this place is by far one of my ultimate favorites!! Great food, great service, great atmosphere. I couldn't ask for more! Everything here is delicious!"}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service. Everything on the menu looked great. Couldn't decide on one thing. Wait staff was courteous and attentive. Definitely would come back again."}
{"text":"Oh heaven! I found a place that cure my craving for paella. I have be on a search for soooooo long! And it's soooo good. 

Customer service: 5/5 Rosie (waitress) was great. She's efficient and sweet. Check in often but not over bearing. 

Ambiance: 5/5 It was busy night to be on a Wednesday. Ppl chatting, place have a romantic scenery. We were seated in the booth near the back., I'm glad. With all the chatting. It was a little where I was at. 

Food: 5/5 my paella was beautiful. Rice is NoT overcook. The seafood(mussels, scallop, calamari and among others) 
The man ordered the tossed jumbo shrimp in light tomato sauce with tomato and oregano over pasta.   Apparently he likes it. He finish it real quick! 

All and all. I adore this place. I really want to try something new when I come back but that paella is too die for. Soooo ?"}
{"text":"I'm just going to come out and say that I adore this restaurant. (Shh don't tell but I think it's better than Zen). Every single time I come to Miro's the food has been utterly amazing. The wine selection is fantastic and the staff here is some of the best I've ever experienced. I honestly can't even believe that I haven't reviewed this place before now! Aside from the food this place is one of my go to places when coordinating work dinners for out of town guests. My SVP who lives in LA looked at me funny when I brought him here, but now every single time he's in Charlotte he requests at least one dinner be scheduled here! They never fail to accommodate our large group, inevitably last minute. Last time I was here I had the steak and it was mouth watering. Also never leave here without having dessert. They will bring out this large plate full of dessert choices, but I urge you to ignore all of it and insist on having the tres leche cake!! It is the best tres leche cake I've ever had and I can't come here and not get it. This is a restaurant that never fails to deliver in all arenas!!"}
{"text":"We arrived at 5:30 pm for an early dinner and the restaurant was empty.  The hostess proceeded to tell us that they had a lot of reservations for 6:30 pm and asked if we thought we could finish within an hour.  She said that she \"didn't want us to feel rushed\" because we would be pushed to leave. Seriously? We probably could and would have finished within an hour (depending on the kitchen) but after that reception, I think not. We left. 
We were looking forward to trying Miro but their unfriendly, classless, rude welcome has changed our feelings."}
{"text":"Great people and great food

I left my credit there by mistake they went out of there way to return it

The food and atmosphere was great"}
{"text":"Big fan of Bao! Very kind human. 10/10. What a wonderful interior design set up in this restaurant. Fancy and sleek. Food is good too."}
{"text":"The food was great and the service was on point. It seemed like the servers were in tune with each other and were on the same page. We would ask our server for something and immediately another server would bring it to the table. We had the empanadas and fried calamari for appetizers. Then we had the soup version of paella (description right from the server's mouth) and osso buco, which is veal on potatoes. It was delicious. The sangria here is also very nice. For dessert, I ordered the tres leches and I must say this place has top five tres leches I've ever had (take it from a tres leches aficionado). Great restaurant, I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Miro has been one of my wife's and my favorite South Charlotte restaurants for the past 15 years. We have enjoyed both its old location at Stonecrest and its new location at Toringdon (even more.) Its owner Tri is normally onsite checking on customers which is always a huge plus and a good sign. The atmosphere is comfortable and polished. 

I must say upfront that, although service is usually friendly and attentive, it can be spotty at times as some of its servers can be quite temperamental and rude. Ask the manager directly for another if you are not happy with yours. In fact, do this anywhere! You are the customer, for goodness sake, and eating out is expensive, expect and demand good service! 

I'm going to do something that I normally I do not do, which is to start with dessert. Their Tres Leches cake is quite frankly the best we've had anywhere! It is made in house and easily serves two. It is incredibly moist and is made perfectly. The only problem is it spoils you for anywhere else. 

Over the years, we have tried everything on the menu; our favorite however, the Red Snapper, is not on the menu. When it is available as a special we definitely choose it. Of course as you may expect at a Spanish Grille, the paella and Zarzuela, which is like paella stew, are both excellent. 

My go to dish is the Churrasco de Cerdo which is the grilled seasoned pork tenderloin topped with chimichurri sauce, served with Spanish rice, black beans, and plantains for $17. The pork is always tender and flavorful and the sides, especially the plantains, are perfectly prepared. You also can't go wrong with any of the tapas.

All meals are served with bread - soft and warm mini loaves - and if that is fabulous with butter. We always order a house salad with the house vinaigrette and have consistently been pleased. 

Even after all these years, this place remains a Gotta Try. It stays busy though though, if you're going to dinner, be sure to make reservations."}
{"text":"The menu is perfectly sized and everything in it sounds and looks delicious. They have a fairly large wine list, decent amount of house drinks, and a good amount of foreign and domestic beers. The parmesan scallops are amazing and every other appetizer sounds amazing. This is truely one of the best restaurants in the South end or in Charlotte all together."}
{"text":"If you know me you know how much I hate strip malls and the usual restaurants that reside in said strip malls. However, Miro Spanish Grille is not your usual strip mall eatery. Once inside, you will find a modern, sophisticated decor and a menu full of delicious choices. 

On our visit we had the calamari (served in a rich, atypical style), grilled octopus, paella and a stuffed eggplant entree...all pleasantly unlike what we expected. 

Perhaps the most enjoyable part of the evening was our bartender William who immediately got the party going as he regaled us with stories that would make more modest folk blush. We are not the blushing types, so his bringing us into the fold of regulars at the bar made it hard to leave at the end of our night. We felt as if we were among friends we had known for years...think back in those two years you spent in that reform school.

We will be back. We have to, after all, we have more dishes to try and we know William has more stories to tell. They'll be much more shady than a '50 Shades of Grey' sequel, and I wouldn't miss that kind of entertainment for anything."}
{"text":"I'm seeing some pretty exaggerated reviews. The ambiance, presentation and service deserves 4 stars. However, the appetizers and entree I had was less than satisfying. I went for lunch, which, there's a very underwhelming menu list. Nothing I had (appetizers, wine, bread, entree) tasted unique or flavorful. I'll leave this place for everyone else. If you never get out of Ballantyne then maybe this will work for you. There's similar places way better than this, and the ones I know of locally are within 2 miles of uptown. This has nothing to do with my review but the music was all over the place from song to song and I felt rushed after I ate and it's most likely because it was a few minutes after 2pm."}
{"text":"(7/17/17) So the electricity went out and we had to eat. Miro was closer than the other choice. Fortunately it wasn't packed and we were seated right away. The restaurant is beautifully decorated in a simple fashion. It reminded me of a dining room in a home that you like to visit. Our waiter was very well versed in the specials and the menu and was able to make sense of our orders as we tried to pronounce the dishes correctly. In my favor all of the ice tea was unsweet and there were plenty of sweeteners available to add. I had an appetizer in a wonderful garlic sauce, Langoustines au Pil Pil, and for my entree I had the Paella Valenciana. It was excellent. Its a good thing that I ordered the small serving because it was huge! A sizzling pan was brought out with lots of delicious seafood and a spicy rice that paired very well together. I really can't wait to go back. A friend recommended the Zarzuela de Moriscos. He said that it was excellent. I don't want to have to wait till the lights go out again. Hopefully my wife will branch out and try something new. Its an amazing restaurant."}
{"text":"55 Told me over a year ago Miro was moving to this new location!  This Space Looks Great!  We got one of our Favorite Waiters fro the former location, he remembered us and did a Great Job!

We Ordered Three of the Entree Specials of the Night and 55 got an 8 oz Filet Mignon that was on the Menu!

Lamb Chops with Cimmichurri was my favorite Dish of the evening and my photo could not capture how fantastik this Dish looked

Beef Tenderloin stuffed with Spinach and Lobster was good not great

Veal Shank was good though my least favorite, included a long prong Fork for the Marrow

Gazpacho was BETTER than Ever!!!

Black Bean Soup still a Favorite

Fried Calamari was as good as ever

Chimmchurri Sauce ! Mmmmmmm!!!!  I always order a side of Lemon Wedges to go with this Sauce [I'm Guessing in Spain this is NOT so common (I'm Guessing) so which Culture did I learn this adding Lemon to Chimmichurri ???]

Tres Leches was the BEST I have tasted ANYWHERE

In Total four of us got Four Desserts... Usually I'm not a fan of Tres Leches though 55 and my eBay Bride LOVE it sa O always know I will get a bite, this one IS ! ! !

Dessert Tray 
The other Three Dessert were a bit of a letdown...Though they were Rich and Good, NONE were great nor worth repeating, even if they were Free, I think I would pass!

Miro History :  Modern Artist Miro from Spain I guess an Abstract Impressionist though I'm guessing... 2003 I moved to Charlotte... 55 and I regularly ate at Sole and Miro this was after the time of Donkey Ho Ho and other Spanish Restaurants were losing popularity... Miro Stands Alone!"}
{"text":"Miro's is hands down one of our absolute favorite places to eat in Charlotte. The filet with the bacon port sauce is to die for! Also killer sautéed spinach and sangria. Best of all, Miro's has the most incredible tres leche I have ever had in any city, definitely save room!!"}
{"text":"So thankful Miros is back open!!! The sangria is fabulous....seafood fresh and perfectly cooked. I love the sampler plate of tapas (not on the menu by the way) and their steaks are amazing as well. Desserts - if you have room good luck - but the Tres Leche has no competition from anyone else. The price tag us worth it - enjoy!"}
{"text":"I recently went to the new location - this place used to be in Stonecrest but moved to Torringdon beside Earth Fare - and the new digs are really nice!  The atmosphere remains comfortable and classy but not stuffy.

You'll always find great service at Miro.  The waitstaff is extremely knowledgeable of the menu and can answer questions and give recommendations.  There are specials every day that they can rattle off with ease, and I'm not talking about 2 or 3 things.  It's more like 8 or 10.  

You'll find all your traditional Spanish dishes here as well as some Spanish-American fusion type things.  My favorites are the paella and the red snapper.  Things are reasonably priced for the good quality that you will get.

The dessert menu is insanity, and they literally bring the dessert items to you on a platter for you to drool over as you ponder your decision.  There are cakes a' plenty, torts, pastries, and my favorite - the tres leches.  Check out the picture I posted and tell me you don't want that! 

This is my favorite restaurant in Ballantyne a place you must visit if you're in the area looking for a nice meal."}
{"text":"Much better second experience. 

We got:

Croquetas de Jamon - Yummy! I'm not usually a fan of fried foods but these were really good, not oily at all with a nice crispy exterior and delicious soft and savory interior. 

Gambas al Ajillo - These came sizzling hot in the plate (literally still sizzling) with a tad bit of spicy heat as well. Others at my table really liked it.

Gratinadas - I wasn't really a fan, way too much cheese covering the scallops. Was a standard baked cheese dish. But take my words with a grain of salt since I dislike cheese.

Pulpo Gallego - Don't miss this! The octopus was really good. Usually octopus can end up too chewy, and I was expecting a whole leg cut up into pieces. Instead, it came sautéed and sliced up into smaller pieces and was super tender and flavorful. Probably my favorite tapas. 

Salmon con mousse de aguacate - Worst dish, came at the recommendation of the waiter. Very standard lox mixed with a weird avocado/cheese mix - wasn't quite guacamole given the random chunks of cheese.

Paella - Wow. This did not disappoint. Probably the best main I've tried here - this dish is flavorful and packed with seafood. The scallop I had was soft and delicious.

Zarzuela - It's very similar to paella, with a lot of the same seafood elements, but somehow I thought the paella pulled off the flavors better and the seafood was more tender in the paella (i.e. the scallops)

Lamb special - It was one of the specials for the night and I couldn't resist ordering it. Came atop a heaping pile of mashed potatoes with 4 lamb chops. The lamb chops were good - very tender (I asked for medium rare), but I found myself wishing it had a bit more flavor or perhaps just salt. Nothing wrong with it - cooked very well, just not quite as good as the paella.

Tiramisu cheesecake - I wasn't a huge fan but that's because I dislike cheesecake in general."}
{"text":"Miro is my favorite \"upscale-casual\" dinner in South Charlotte. The atmosphere is lovely, service is great, and there's a nice wine selection that is very reasonably priced. All the food is delicious, but it's really all about the paella. You MUST order it -- period. Doesn't matter which one; they're all stellar. Get the octopus appetizer instead of dessert, which is fine, but not worth the calories in my opinion."}
{"text":"Love Miro! Food is always consistently good & wine selections are excellent. Love their Tres Leches cake. Make sure you have a reservation because they are busy!"}
{"text":"This place doesn't remotely live up to its reputation! The server, wonderful. The FOOD S***D (if you catch my drift). Practically flavorless. The shrimp in the Paella was like the frozen shrimp from your local A&P (if you remember those days). We had a lot of leftovers. . .and we left them on the table."}
{"text":"A night of bests!! Best steak I can remember... And I used to travel on a company card... I have had some great steak!!  Then for dessert we had the Flan.  My wife, who grew up in Bolivia said it is the best in Charlotte!!  Pleasant attentive wait staff, beautiful surroundings... Congrats Miro Spanish Grille... You NAILED it... Olé !!!!!"}
{"text":"Had my first meal here last night along with a first date. Both were excellent. I had to Paella and my date had the ossobuco. Both were outstanding. Grilled octopus as a starter. Was one of the best I've had. Service was over the top. I'm not going to go on because there's no need to. Go. Try it. And you'll love it. Go early if you don't want to wait. Better even better make a reservation. Be smart. This wouldn't be my last visit and it sure wouldn't be my last date."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about the grilled octopus appraiser. You will not be disappointed. The paella is excellent as well."}
{"text":"Service was great. The food was good. 
Definitely recommend the paella. I was excited to try their grouper but found the sauce to be a bit disappointing."}
{"text":"Just as good as the Stonecrest location! I was so glad to see Miro hopping on a Wednesday night at 8:00 p.m. The fella and I made a reservation on their website (didn't they used to be on OpenTable?) and were promptly seated in a booth at the bar.

They have totally transformed the space that used to be Brig's. The waiting area is as big as Brig's was, which means huge compared to Miro's old waiting area. The bar is also massive with dark wood and warm, hanging, pendant lights. The back wall on either side (dning room and bar) is stone with wine bottles lining it. I got an Ilios Noche at Quail Corners feel.

Our waiter took a little bit of time to get to us, but once he did, he got in a groove. We jumped right in and got the Churrasco de Cerdo ($17) for me - pork tenderloin with chimichurri sauce, plantains, rice, and beans - and the Paella de Carna ($23) for the fella, which came with lamb, chicken, chorizo, beef, and pork. Mine was good, but the chicken could've had a little more flavor or sauce, but the fella's was awesome. Meat on top of meat on top of paella on top of the best roasted red peppers I've had in a loooong time. Their wine selection is pretty darn good, too.

I'm so glad that Miro is in the neighborhood, and they're off to an awesome start."}
{"text":"I love Miro!  This is my first time at their new location but the inside is great, it's fairly spacious and not too dark. The bar area has two TVs for those just looking for drinks. The service is fantastic. 

Best of all are the lunch prices!!!  $12 for paella!!  But really the lunch prices are great, I believe they are all under $15.  Also I think the parking is easier at Torringdon then in Stonecrest.

The employees are all super friendly and helpful too!"}
{"text":"I never go to Ballantyne, but met a co-worker / friend there last night and had the best experience!  It wasn't stuffy Uptown / Dilworth.  The bartender was very attentive and gave great recommendations.  He even put my wine to go in a nice pretty bag, that everyone in my building was asking about when I walked in my condo.  It was a very bad week for me, and I didn't go into details, but thank you for making me feel special!!!!!!!  I will always recommend you all!!"}
{"text":"So I have only been the once, but they made a lasting impression on me. I went to pick up Togo food, wearing work out cloths. Didn't realize that a lot of people dressed up to go there. I felt under dressed as this place was packed. The bartender greeted me very fast and warmly. Made me very comfortable right away. I won't review the food because I got it Togo and I realize that it is a little different than ordering it in the store. The empanadas where good though. I will definitely go back, might put on some nicer clothes though. Lol"}
{"text":"Wife and I have been there three times; consistently very good \"small plates\" and service."}
{"text":"Great food and service.  Simply a wonderful birthday evening for my husband.  They were thoughtful and respected all of our wishes. Could not have asked for more."}
{"text":"Wonderful food! Great atmosphere and staff. The tapas were amazing. Hands down, the best octopus I have had. Better than in Madrid! The prices were reasonable given the gourmet quality of the food. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Came here a few weeks prior and was thoroughly impressed. The service was fantastic and the food was first rate. Ordered the paella, which was perfectly done and all the ingredients were very fresh. Also impressed that they had cafe con leche and tres leches for dessert. Will definitely return soon."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with a friend in December 2015. The ambiance was lovely, the food was excellent (gluten-free options exist), and the service was top-notch. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews for this place I had thought that the food would be amazing here. I was sadly disappointed. My husband and I started our dinner off with ordering three tapas. We ordered the shrimp in olive oil, the sauteed jumbo shrimp and the parmesan scallops. 

The sauteed jumbo shrimp were not flavorful at all. I felt like it needed salt and I never put salt on anything. The jumbo shrimp were also pretty tough, almost like they were overcooked. The sauce on them was bland and just didn't wow me at all.

The shrimp in olive oil came out sizzling hot and were definitely cooked well. Again, the flavors were lack luster and I wasn't really impressed with it.

The parmesan scallops were my favorite. Although teeny tiny, the scallops were cooked to perfection and the accompanying sauce and cheese made for a delicious combination.

For our entree my hubby and a split the seafood paella. It was good. I have had better paella. I felt that the clams were overly fishy tasting, however, the calamari in it was to die for! Overall the paella was good and the price was right for it as well.

We ended our dinner by splitting the chocolate/white chocolate cake. That was really good, but by that time I was way to full.

Oh and I forgot to add the sangria was really good.

Overall I was really disappointed with this place. Everyone had given it rave reviews and I love Spanish Tapas, but it just didn't do it for me."}
{"text":"I went with a friend to Miro to celebrate his birthday.  I ordered paella; he ordered the seafood stew.  The odor of his stew led him to pick up pieces of seafood with a fork and hold them up to his nose.  He called the server over to take the entree away.

I did the same with my paella.  My problem was the same as my friend's:  the mussels smelled truly awful.  They were spoiled, practically rotting.

The server replaced both entrees with others which were fine.  But the occasion was ruined.  And to think that we could have ended up with food poisoning.

We will not be going back."}
{"text":"This review was easy to do, none of the indecision of making the restaurant a 4* or 5*.  Six of us went to lunch today to Miro Spanish Grille.  Two of us had very similar meals, I had the seafood with angel hair pasta and my son had the seafood with rice.  The two meals had scallops, shrimp, calamari, clams, and mussels included.  Outstanding.  My wife had the scallops in a tomato sauce which was also very tasty.  Service was excellent."}
{"text":"For a place that has such wonderful reviews, I expected both good food and good service. The food was unexceptional, but I did not try the entire menu, so my review is not negative for that reason alone. The service is what motivates this negative review: it was terrible. I do not know whether we had a new hire--a fast speaking fellow that wore red framed glasses--but it was apparent upon our first introduction that he didn't have much time for us. The real indication arose when we (my date and I) received a lackluster artichoke marinated in vinegar. It looked and tasted like something pre-prepared at the grocery store. I gave it a try, hoping that it might taste better if I tried the heartier bits, but it was no use. It sucked. 

We left the artichoke untouched, expecting an inquiry by our server as would be common at most high end restaurants. We waited, and waited, until the server came to take our plates away. He finally asked how it was, and we told him we didn't like it at all. He took our other plates and left this grocery store concoction on our table. We waited again. We discussed between ourselves whether there was some miscommunication, so we awaited the waiter's return. When he arrived, he asked if we wanted him to take our untouched artichoke. We said yes, and tried to imply what he should do. We very kindly asked if we could have another appetizer instead. He didn't seem to understand, so we said it again. At this point, he seemed visibly annoyed. He asked point blank, \"so are you saying you want Empanadas?\" Assuming he'd understood our plea--or just hoping--I said yes. He returned with them; they were alright. 

And then the check arrived. There I was greeted with the charge for those nasty artichokes in addition to the Empanadas. I was perplexed. I flagged our waiter, and reminded him that he forgot to take the artichoke off our bill.  He was even more perplexed, and visibly annoyed. He asked, \"didn't you order that?\" Yes, we did, but it was terrible, and we spoke about this already! He sharply exclaimed that he'd talk to his manager. He must have because the bill was quickly and hardly plopped on our tabletop without a word or look from the waiter. The artichoke billings had vanished as quickly as our resolve to return. I hope this was an aberration. But I wouldn't feel comfortable returning to possibly run into our friend with the red-rimmed spectacles."}
{"text":"Nice find while in Charlotte. We were looking for a true Tapas, and we found this little jewel. This was on four square top 10 list! Fast & Friendly service! We put in our order and within 5 min the food was being delivered!! Food was fresh and full of flavor! Great for a little group and larger groups. A little noisy.. But another table were just having a good time. In the door, seated, ordered, ate, paid the bill in less than an hour! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Don't get the tomato/cheese salad.  Tomato was tasteless - like the stuff you get from a mass supermarket.   The Zarzuela was good.  The croquetas were good but different from what I'm used to in Costa Maresma or Costa Brava.   I couldn't tell that they had Serano ham in them.  The flan tasted like it was cheese based.   Service was good."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful restaurant! We went to Charlotte for the weekend and anytime I leave Fayetteville I go searching for delicious Spanish restaurants to get my fix of home. Not many Spanish restaurants can take me back to my hometown in Spain but this one def did the trick! Everything we had was delicious and next time we are in town this will be our go to restaurant."}
{"text":"We waited for almost an hour, but the food is not as expected. well, you can't compare with the one yu had in Miami~"}
{"text":"Very tasty dinner with my wifey.  The empanadas were quite tasty and the grilled octopus was very tender.  Loved the paella Valenciana and the Tres Leches cake.  Our server Femia was on point, attentive and funny.  Made for a great date night."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I came her to celebrate our Anniversary and needles to say everything was stellar. Initially when we arrived it was extremely busy and because it was a holiday they weren't accepting reservations so we took a shot and when i spoke with the manager and expressed I really wanted to dine at their establishment after looking at the pictures on yelp and reading the reviews, she told me she would get us a table and within 10-15 minutes we were seated and the food was amazing....the ambiance was beautiful...great vibes...great prices and our night was heavenly"}
{"text":"Went for our anniversary. One of our faves since we moved here 9 years ago. Seafood specials are amazing. Consistently delicious food and fabulous service. Sangria is so good! And they made it very special for our anniversary with Tres Leches Cake--the only place we have ever loved it!!  Also great tapas--cannot get enough of this place."}
{"text":"One of the worst services I have ever had! First time I went to this restaurant I ordered to go and the service was not the best but I assumed they were busy. Second time I came... I came in a hour and a half before the place closed to place an order to go. Two men were at the bar counting money and I waited for about 18 minutes. I tried to be patient because I understand when you work at a register and money needs to be counted however customer service should come first. Neither one of them acknowledged me. They kept counting even though they could have at least said \"give us one moment mam! I'll be right with you!\" A group of women came in and they laughed with them and struck up a conversation. After waiting for over 18 minutes even though it seemed longer the tall ball headed man at the bar finally acknowledged me. I had issues deciding what I wanted and he walked away from me to go do something else. He seemed very impatient and wasn't willing to help due to the menu was slightly confusing because the food consists of Spanish dishes. He came back again and told to me to hold on a second. Spoke with a lady and came back to me and said \"The kitchen is closed!\" I stated I had been waiting for over 15-20 minutes and they still had an hour before they closed. He was very nonchalant and not very apologetic at all. I have worked in customer service for over 15 years and I have never experienced such rudeness. When I stated I wouldn't be coming back he shrugged his shoulders and said \"okay then\".... very rude man! I will never eat at this restaurant ever and I will make sure to tell everyone I know! As long as they have the tall ball headed/very short cut guy at the bar working there I will never ever eat there!!! He is extremely rude, seems a little racist, and seems to only want to assist \"certain\" customers based on their appearance. One thing I've learned through my years of customer service is that you never know how much money a person may have even the customers in sweatpants and a t-shirt, but never forget that the customers are the ones who make sure you get a check. If we don't eat there you don't get paid! He needs to be humbled! Be blessed."}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night since I was in the mood for a paella. We started it with the croquetas de jamón that were excellent and the empanadas that were good. The paella was plentiful but wasn't my favorite- good but not great- missing that saffron flavor. Others ordered the pork cutlet that was very good but the fish was a very small portion on a giant plate. Thank God we had plenty of paella or he would have been hungry.
We shared a tres levees that was very good"}
{"text":"Went there with 4 friends and everyone raved about their food and dessert. 
I had the churrasco which was so good. And loved the plantains that came with it. The only complaint was that I ordered a drink not on the menu and it was the worst lemon drop ever. So, don't order your alcohol off menu!"}
{"text":"The staff is knowledgable and accommodating. The bartenders shake your hand, introduce themselves & suggest tasting wines before you order to assure you're pleased. And they usually remember you the first time you return. I especially like the stuffed peppers appetizer and the Miro pasta dish. My only complaint is the food doesn't always come out piping hot, as it should. Otherwise, I do recommend going for dinner &/or just drinks."}
{"text":"I went to Miro's with my husband and a couple of friends to celebrate his birthday. The food at Miro's is really good. The reason for two stars is the service is pretty awful. Our server really didnt want to be there. A few times she was very abrupt and she was clearly not happy when we decided to move to the desserts after the appetizers. It is a tapas place. We ordered a few tapas and were very full from it. It is such a shame this place is so close to our home and the food is pretty decent but I wont be going back. There are so many great places in Charlotte. Miro's needs to get its act together."}
{"text":"No issues with service, whatsoever!  Our waiter was on top of everything, and not in an obtrusive way.  Tapas were great - we had the octopus, the plantains, and the empanadas.  All were prepared well and brought out quickly.  The tomato salad was an excellent alternative to the traditional Italian caprese, using creamy goat cheese instead of mozzarella.  The seafood paella was good, but honestly, it's paella.  It wasn't incredibly different.  Dessert was the tres leches, and was wonderful!

Another note - the cocktails were strong and well-made.  Worth it.

I'll be here again!"}
{"text":"Really classy ambiance, though a relatively casual restaurant.  Lunch was delicious. Fideo - like Paella, but with angel hair instead of rice - was outstanding....and only $12 on the lunch menu.  The Tres Leches for dessert was amazing too.  Friendly staff.  Highly recommend as a nice little treat in Ballantyne, just outside of Charlotte."}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for a nice place to eat while visiting the Charlotte area. We read the reviews and this place did not disappoint. Our dinners were  both delicious. The grouper and salmon were cooked and seasoned perfectly! We will be back."}
{"text":"Actually, in terms of the taste of food, what a disappointment! It seemed to come out of the frozen food section of Food Lion (no, I've never gone there for groceries based on friends' experiences). Some greasy, tasteless sauce. . .what a shame as the server and hostess were so very nice and professional. Was very surprised to see so many folks heading in there this past Labor Day weekend and have to guess that they were trying Miro out because of a very positive Charlotte Magazine review. Didn't bother to look for a \"Miro ad\" in that issue, but where there is a fantastic review of a restaurant there is usually a paid for advertisement somewhere. It was evident that some of the people dining there were also newcomers checking it out as we were asked more than once if we knew what was good there. Again, servers were professional and wanted to make sure everyone was happy. Clearly the kitchen staff didn't feel the same way."}
{"text":"I used to go to Miro's sporadically when it was at it's old location.  The new place is closer to where I live so when asked for a suggestion for a place to eat on a Friday night I suggested we go here.  I was a HUGE fan of Eddies Place (RIP) and never went to Brig's.

We made a 6:30 reservation and was seated right away to a booth for 4.  They did a nice job on the décor which is modern, a bit dark but trendy.  Our waiter Juan Carlos took very good care to explain the menu and make some great suggestions.  We started out with the mussels, and shrimp which both item has some extremely flavorful broth for dipping.  We had to keep asking poor Juan Carlos to bring us more bread since we kept running our because of all the sopping going on.  I come from a long line of soppers and Miros provided the perfect dishes to continue my family tradition.

Anyhoo, I ordered the lamb because, I love lamb and most restaurants in Charlotte don't offer it.  It was served with some carrots and mashed potatoes which didn't get paid much attention to because the lamb was so delicious.  Slowly braised. tender and seasoned well I went full on Fred Flintstone on it when I first apologized to the other patrons when I picked the bone up and ate every last morsel of lamby goodness.

For dessert we had what else, but the Tres Leche.  Just as wonderful as I remembered it.  The Manager or Owner came by and greeted us and thanked us for coming as the restaurant slowly filled up which is always a nice touch.  I am glad Miro's reopened and will definitely return."}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite restaurants. The service is so wonderful (minus the hostess who I had an awkward exchange with when asking about my reservation). They do whatever they can to make your special occasion really special, when you note it on the reservation. It gets pretty busy so make one or be prepared to wait. I've had a lot of their dishes but my favorite are probably the croquets, the paella, and the seafood stew(z- something). Their seafood always tastes fresh, their rice is cooked perfectly every time, they really do a good job of being authentic. The tres leches cake is to die for btw."}
{"text":"After going to the old location several times in the past, I tried the new location on N. Community House Road a fews weeks ago.  I feel the new location is even better because (1) parking is much easier, (2) the environment is nicely decorated and (3) the food is still as good or better than ever.  

We were nicely greeted upon entry and were seated right away for our reservation.  I noticed how the high ceilings and the new wall decor adds a great touch to the ambiance.  The service was first-class, the food was fresh & hot, and we all had a wonderful experience the whole time there.

We tried a little of everything on the menu - appetizers, main entrées and desserts - and it was all fantastic.  Their Tres Leches dessert could possibly be the best dessert in town!  

We'll definitely be back and highly recommend Miro Spanish Grille to anyone looking for a wonderful and pleasant dining experience!"}
{"text":"Was very disappointed with our visit to Miro and it came down to one thing - food quality and prep.  First, I'll say the atmosphere is inviting and the service was exceptional.   

We had a drink and tapas in the bar and the bar tenders were the most friendly and fun we've met in some time.  I would recommend it as a place for drinks anytime.  

But - the food was under/ over cooked and cold in places.   It really was 'blow the kitchen up and start over' bad.   Something must have happened for this place to become popular.  It must have been good at one time but is no more.  All three of the dishes we tried were exceptionally bad. 

We love authentic Spanish dishes and were really hoping we had found a great spot - but Outside of stopping for drinks, I'd pass it on by."}
{"text":"Miro is our \"special Occasion\" place like Birthdays, Anniversaries, etc. We love their paella, a truly Spanish \"Spaniard\" plate. Unfortunately they have fused other plates onto their menu that aren't Spanish at all like the plantains, but most people in the area wouldn't know the difference anyway. While on the subject I also wish they played real Spanish music like flamenco, gypsy, etc instead of Salsa which is more Cuban (Caribbean\") or merengue and Bachata which is Dominican. It wouldn't surprise me to one day hear Mariachi music. Not that there is anything wrong with that if you're in a Mexican restaurant that is. I just wish they could stay in the Spanish \"Spaniard\" style more. It's like being able to order a frankfurter in a French restaurant and listening to polka music. If makes no sense and it cheapens the establishment a bit. Ole!!"}
{"text":"We came here for Valentine's Day and so glad we did! 
We love tapas and Miro didn't disappoint! 
We started with the spicy potatoes which left a nice zing on your tongue.
Next came the pork chops, which were so tender and delicious.
The red peppers stuffed with goat cheese and spinach came last and were a nice contrast to the spice.
Next came the house salads and they were very fresh and crisp.
We shared the meat paella as our main course. The lamb was tender and cooked just right. The chorizo was plentiful as well. Definitely a keeper.
We read about the Tres Leche here on Yelp, so we shared that as well. So delicious and definitely something to try.
Since we put our phones away for our meal there are no pics, sorry.
The waitress was super polite and the service was fast. Everyone that served us was beyond pleasant. 
When I went in search of the restroom, no less than 3 staff members pointed me in the right direction without me even asking.
We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Miro never fails to deliver great food and service.
Very friendly staff that makes you feel welcome every time. We love the food here, we walked in on a Sunday that happened to be Mother's Day with a very upset and angry 4 year old. A very nice lady whom I believe is the manager? I didn't get her name but she was soooo incredibly sweet and understanding. She talked to my daughter and treated her to a strawberry daiquiri that made her feel so much better. Such a nice gesture of her, and as I stated previously, the food was amazing."}
{"text":"The appetizers: great! Dinner: good! Atmosphere: great! Service: top notch! Dessert:..tres leches..mind blowing excellent!"}
{"text":"We have been long time customers of Miro, even before they moved to their new location in Ballantyne. Miro is a restaurant that we always go to with our huge family of 14 - big groups can be a hassle in most restaurants, but Miro always takes care of us and assigns more than one server. With big groups, definitely get the appetizer sampler platter. It's not on the menu but it's perfect for our family! It comes with jamon & cheese, empanadas, calamari, steak, and a few other goodies :) We love their paella and the nightly specials are always so delicious! Can't forget to finish off your meal with the best tres leches in town either :)"}
{"text":"This was very special. It is hard to find a truly great Tres Leches in the states, so you cannot leave here without dessert. It melted on your mouth, and the cake was so tender while the cream decorations were real whipped heavy cream, the cake touched with little flecks of temptations.
Yes, we did actually eat a meal :). I had the Salmon topped with a compote of Tomatoes that was flavorful and piquant. It was accompanied by Grilled Veggies.
My BFFs also had imaginative and mouth watering entrees. I loved the Malbec. The redecoration of the former 'Brixxs' location includes beautiful dark wood and very private booths as well as an expanded outdoor patio area. A simply wonderful experience!!!"}
{"text":"I loved Miro when it was located on Rea Rd but I actually think this is a better location for them.

The atmosphere is inviting. The seating is comfortable and the service is outstanding!

For this visit, my dinner group met to explore the flavors of Spain. Some of us started out with the Sangria which was delicious. For my meal, I ordered the gazpacho and the Paella de Carne. Everything was beautifully presented. 

The gazpacho was flavorful but a tad bit too salty. The paella was a great alternative to the traditional seafood paella and came chicken, lamb, chorizo and a cut of beef topped with chimichurri in the middle of a large dish of Spanish rice. It was enough food for 3 people and all of us who ordered it ended up taking some home.

For desert, I ordered the Flan but they have about 10 different desserts available if you save room for it! The flan was light and delightful and mildly sweet. 

Wonderful place but it gets busy. If you are going with a group, make sure to make a reservation a few days in advance!"}
{"text":"Very nice dinner,  grilled octopus appetizer and seafood paella to share.   Desserts looked amazing.  Great service and staff,  they bumped the rating from 4 to 5.  Nice bartender and waiter.   Like the new place and very laid back atmosphere.  You know you'll have a good dinner when you walk in and it just smells great."}
{"text":"Order the lamb! And all the tapas you can possible eat. Visited Miro twice with the coworkers and was not disappointed either times.

Calamares ($9) - perfectly fried calamari with marinara and mayo dipping sauces.
Chorizo Salteado - ($9) so good on its own or in paella, the chroizo is good
Pulpo Gallego ($10) - grilled octopus, good, not too chewy, first time we went was better because it tasted fresher and didn't have a fishy taste
Salmon con Mousse de Aguacate ($10) - excellent pairing of smoked salmon with whipped cream cheese and avocado mousse.
Langostinos al Pil Pil ($11) - bigger shrimp in a spicier sauce than the garlic shrimp, very good.
Almejas con Alcachofas ($11) - sauteed clams with garlic and artichokes, who knew artichokes could taste this good?
Patatas Bravas ($8) - good, fried, coated in a nice sticky sauce
Jamon y Manchego ($10) - ugh, this was so good, manchego and jamon, how can you go wrong with this pairing?
Paella Valenciana ($19) - small, shrimp, scallops, mussels, clams, and calamari with Spanish rice, pretty good, definitely something to share

They do start with complimentary bread but the second time we went that somehow didn't manifest but to be honest it's unnecessary because you want to fill your belly with good wine and as many tapas as possible. The lamb special with chimichurri sauce is to die for.

Excellent service. But I can definitely see it hit or miss... The outdoor seating is very nice but the indoor seating is bright and tight to add to the atmosphere. If you order dessert they bring out an entire platter of all that they offer save for the tres leches but I don't recommend their dessert because after the raspberry cheesecake and tres leches I felt like every cake on that platter was going to taste the same.

Plenty of parking. Easy to find. Consistent food having gone once a week for 2 weeks on different days."}
{"text":"Exceptional food and service.. everything we ordered was great. I would definitely recommend the patatas bravas, the paella, sangria and the tres leches cake. Money well spent!"}
{"text":"Awesome new location!  Thought it had closed down, found the new spot next to Earth Fare across 485.  Still my wife and I's favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for excellent atmosphere, food and service, then you e come to the right place!! The staff here meets your every need while delivering food with a smile! Questions are answered fast! The food was AMAZING! My father and I had the paella. My mother had their seafood stew and my uncle had their sea bass! My son had their grilled chicken and steamed broccoli!! please go there. You won't be disappointed. Yes the prices are \"high,\" but they are well worth it!"}
{"text":"I've dined at Miro often over the past 4 months and each experience has been excellent. I recommend the paella, Pollo Jerez, and my favorite - Mero (grouper) - outstanding. My wife and I often dine there on a few tapas rather than entrees - a great way to test the diversity of food at Miro. And the wine selection is quite diverse - wait staff seems well trained on pairings and contrasting among similar blends. I highly recommend Miro - try it!"}
{"text":"Can't believe they have all everything good! And I can't believe as an Asian my best favorite place is here ! I don't live in Charlotte but every time I came here I had to come over ! Love the paella  everything!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for our anniversary for the first time. They did not disappoint. Our waiter was very attentive and helpful with our wine selection of a Spanish wine. Our food was amazing!  The waiter recommended a Spanish desert he said was really moist so we tried it. Wow! It was so moist we couldn't figure out how it stayed together. It was really good.  After dinner we sat at the bar & the bartender made us Mojitos that were very good. It was a great night."}
{"text":"I'm fortunate to have this by my office and enjoy checking it out a couple times a month for lunch. The paella is incredible. It's one of my favorite dishes in Charlotte. The new location is even nicer and more comfortable than when they were at Stonecrest. Good food, good service, and a beautiful restaurant. One of my favorites in town."}
{"text":"I was sooooo excited to try this place. I've been craving paella for the longest time and since the reviews for this place was great, we decided to come in to try for dinner. We made a reservation and waited an extra 30 minutes. It's okay, I understand if things back up. At least they had plenty of room to sit while waiting for your table.

We ordered the calamari, gazpacho, pork tenderloin, and the paella. The appetizers were great and the gazpacho was really refreshing! The pork tenderloin was my dad's favorite and was very flavorful. Then the paella came. The paella was colorful and there was an abundant of seafood (looking good). When I dug in, there was no char on the bottom. This is where I was disappointed. To me, it was more of a pilaf than a paella. It was just rice with sauce. Hopefully this was just an off night but on the bright side, at least the seafood was fresh?

Overall, I do not think I will be returning to Miro. For a Spanish restaurant to take pride in their paella (and have it fall flat), it's hard to see myself eating it again."}
{"text":"I had a Sangria, Caesar Salad, and the Paella Valenciana.  The Sangria was very  fruity and strong enough to be classified as a mixed drink -- not a wine and fruit juice drink found at many restaurants.  The Caesar Salad was very fresh, and the dressing had very good flavor.  The Paella Valenciana was delicious.  It was served in a skillet shaped bowl that was piping hot.  It had more shrimp and calamari than any other shellfish, but it still had a good portion of mussels, clams, and scallops.  The spanish rice bed had excellent flavor.  It had more red peppers than any other vegetable; it could have had a few more tomato pieces -- maybe this just happened to be my portion.  Watch out for the \"special sauce\".  I like hot sauce, but this sauce was \"muy picante\".  After my first use, I had to be very \"dose conscious\" with the rest of the sauce.  The bread served with the meal was very fresh.  The menu based \"small\" size of the Paella was enough to fill me up (one person), so I had no dessert.  The only Paella that I had that was better was at a restaurant in Newark, NJ in 1990 -- but that has been an unmatched experience over the last 25 years.  Overall, I had a wonderful gastronomic experience at Miro Spanish Grille."}
{"text":"Went here Friday night for dinner with a few friends. The service and food were outstanding. We had the croquetas for an appetizer. They were fried perfectly. I have been wanting to try this place for a while and I am glad I did. We had the tres leches flr dessert and it is some of the best I have ever had. Great flavor and light. Love this place!"}
{"text":"5 STARS & NO LESS!!!   This place was incredible.  The service was outstanding.  And the food will leave you speechless!  Don't hesitate to try the lamb chops...food heaven on Earth.  I got the lamb chops dish with Spanish rice instead of mashed potatoes.  Also, the calamari was exceptional and fried to perfection.  The red snapper and shrimp is a great option for your main course as well.  Their sangria and margaritas are some awesome choices for drinks.  You just can't go wrong with any choices, you will be impressed."}
{"text":"WTF HAPPENED HERE IN THREE MONTHS!!! This place has changed so much in three months that I will probably not be returning. When I first came to this place as you can see in my first review I was very impressed and the food was delicious. I feel like they've gotten comfortable and have slacked in that area as well as the service. The young waiter was very nice and very accommodating, however he needs to cool it with the Rico Sauve attitude. Getting back to the food,  we ordered the garlic shrimp, plantains, empanadas, potatoes bravas and jamon croquettes. First off, the garlic shrimp were smaller than the last time, not as good quality and swimming in oil. We sent hem back. The potatoes bravas came out smothered in so much sauce that you could barely identify what they were. They were not the same potatoes we had three months ago. The empanadas were good but were only served one and a half, not cool. They couldn't give us two??? The croquettes tasted like puréed spam and it came with what can only be described as mayonnaise without a flavor. They were very generous with our wine and topped off my glasses very nicely. A friend of mine had A chicken dish and wasn't impressed at all. It's a shame that this restaurant has gone that way since it was just absolutely delicious the first time that my boyfriend and I were there. I'm going to try a different Spanish restaurant that is consistent with their quality and service. Ole!"}
{"text":"So I had come here as a graduation dinner and I absolutely loved it. Decor is great. Service is nice. The food is absolutely amazing. I had the lamb chops with the wild mushroom sauce and it was absolutely delicious. The pulpo Gallego was amazing. The tres laches was stunning. The paella was also pretty great. Overall it was an enjoyable time and I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I had the Empanadas and platanos. Great!!!  It was delivered thru doordash and still good. I cannot wait to try other dishes like sea bass and arroz con pollo!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I ate here last night and it was delightful. I had Paella Carne which was a nice change from Seafood Paella. 
The Paella was served traditionally in a large stone bowl pipping hot and looked so inviting to the eyes. My mouth was not disappointed.  The Paella was filled with chorizo, pork, chicken & to my great surprise two delicious lamb chops resting on top. I would highly recommend this dish. Not to stop here our server comes from the kitchen with a tray filled with fabulous looking desserts. I finished the meal with White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake. Yummy!!! I will definitely add Miro's 
To my list of favorite places to dine."}
{"text":"Service was friendly, atmosphere was good, food was just ok. Desserts were very disappointing - worst cookies&cream cheesecake I've ever had and my husband's tres leche cake was totally dry in the middle! The waitress replaced it with a \"slice from the middle\" but even that was only mildly better. With so many options in Charlotte, I don't think we'll return here."}
{"text":"The entrees were good, but the sangria and tres leches stole the show.  In fact, the tres leches may be the best in Charlotte."}
{"text":"We had an amazing dinner myself and my wife.
The food was very delicious, Paella a delicious dish, its very fresh ingredients and rich flavor.
Thanks to Jesus the waiter's assistant gave us very special attention.
I recommend this place for dinner and have an unforgettable dinner.

Thank you"}
{"text":"Awesome establishment. I frequent this restaurant for lunch often and they quickly get me in and out while providing impeccable service. Love the hostess and the wait staff! Paella, Fried Calamari, Salmon - all cooked to perfection. Relaxing atmosphere. Can't wait to bring my hubby for a visit. Thank you staff...Job well done!"}
{"text":"Went there for Dinner last night (Sunday) a cold and wet day and I wasn't expecting a full house. It was packed but there were no delays serving our table. Great specials and the food was top class and we had an enjoyable evening.  The only other Spanish grill I know is in downtown and the food was far tastier than that. Also my 7 and 14 yr old kids found a lot of things on the menu that they tried and loved."}
{"text":"Oh. My. Goodness. Phenomenal!!! Scary that it's across the street from my gym but omg this is little piece of heaven. Must go too!!"}
{"text":"Went back to Miro for the third time. Fell for one of the specials: Halibut topped with an andouille gravy over broccolini.  Once again I fell for a description that was probably accurate but not as expected. I had a nice piece of  grilled halibut that was topped with crushed tomatoes and two small 1/8\" thick slices of andouille sausage. Could hardly notice them on my plate. Considering I fell for the fish/sausage combination description, I was disappointed. Flavor was good and service was great. That's twice now the specials have let me down though."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite restaurants.  This place is comfort!!!  The ambiance is warm--great for families, special occasions, and really a good value.

The food is always delicious, servings are plenty, and the service is great.  I can't say enough about this place.  We arrived early, and within the hour, the restaurant was completely full.
I usually get the paella, but our server recommended the Zarzuela de Mariscos --a wonderful seafood stew, loaded with fish, shrimp, calamari, mussels, clams, scallops and lobster in a tomato sauce.  
Based on the popularity, I don't have to say you must try, because it is always full--you do need to make a reservation!"}
{"text":"What a hidden gem in Ballantyne!  We visited for the first time tonight and couldn't have been more pleased.  The food was amazing & authentic; yes, we have been to Spain.  The service was excellent, even though we had to sit at the bar with our 5 year old; I appreciate how accommodating the bartenders were.  We ordered the Serrano ham & manchego tapas, the chorizo mussels, & empanadas to start, with the Valencia paella for our main, and took home Tres Leche.  I really can't tell you which was my favorite, they were all so good.  The Tres Leche is seriously amazing as I sit here writing this review and polishing it off (we got it to go).  Oh and the Sangria, excellent!  We ordered 2 1/2 carafes...shouldve just ordered the full.  Finally a good Sangria and made fresh daily.  I highly recommend this gem next to EarthFare and we will be back!!"}
{"text":"Best food, drinks, and service in Ballantine. Upscale but friendly. Taps, fresh seafood, amazing steaks, and more"}
{"text":"This place is a gem! Friendly staff and great environment. Their new location is bigger and better than ever. 

So we usually cant leave town without having the best \"tres Leches\" everrrr!

Definitely recommend visiting their dessert menu and happy Dining."}
{"text":"Excellent service!!! There menu is thoughtful and cozy, and the wine list is surprisingly good. My scallops were divine in the seafood stew, even if the calamari was a bit chewy. The atmosphere is nice door where it is, and I would whole heartedly recommend it to anyone. Oh, and the tres leches? It will make you see God."}
{"text":"Let's be real - there isn't much of a selection in Charlotte for Spanish cuisine. While everywhere is now offering up \"tapas,\" sometimes I still want some good ole TAPAS - jamon, manchego, croquettes, gambas etc.

This is my 1st visit to the new location (to think of it, I can barely remember visiting the old location). It's closer for me coming from Uptown area, and parking is nowhere as crazy as Stonecrest - both are pluses. The place was packed on a Friday night, so even though we had a reservation, we had to wait just a little for a table.

Service overall was ok - our waitress was eager and enthusiastic (at times maybe a little too enthusiastic but I am not complaining). My friend and I ended up starting out the night with the Pulpo Gallego and Jamon y Manchego. I enjoyed the grilled octopus, thus it was a little under seasoned for my tastebuds. The serrano ham were good as well as the mangchego cheese, but you don't get much in an order. For both of the dishes to be priced at $10, the grilled octopus is definitely the better deal.

For entree we shared an order of Marbella. I never had squid ink pasta so I was excited about trying something new. This pasta dish was full of flavor without being too heavy. They were very kind to split the portion up in two for us, and my half was more than enough to fill me.

We ended the night with a slice of tres leches. They did have some very impressive looking options, all so gracefully presented on a silver tray for decision making. BUT there's no better option than tres leches.

Overall it was a very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Have been to Madrid twice and Barçelona once. And THIS. is my review. 

Suggest making a reservation because it can be busy. 

Deceivingly small from the outside but spacious and modern on the inside.

Had the sangria to accompany the meal and it's good. 

Had 3 plates of tapas: jamón y manchego, calamares, and empanadas. The jamón isn't jamón ibérico but is still decent. The empanadas were flavorful and well seasoned. The calamares we got half fried and half grilled and the grilled option was actually really good as it was sautéed with green peppers, onions, garlic, etc. I recommend the calamares. We also had the paella Valenciana which was okay, nothing to really write home about. It seemed to miss a bit of that bam! flavor. Idk. 

So the gentleman taking our order convinced me to get one of the specials of the night: rack of lamb on a healthy portion of mashed potatoes. 4 pieces of the lamb chops were presented to me. I ordered it medium rare and it was cooked and seasoned perfectly. The mashed potatoes had pesto on it which was interesting.

My family got the tres leches cake and they said it was really good. The piece I had didn't have a lot of the milk?/créme? soaked so it was a bit dry. I got the flan, which oops! Brain fart, I mistook for créme brulee/cremá Catalunya. Wasn't disappointed though, the flan wasn't too sweet and it was light so despite having eaten a bunch was able to finish it. 

Good spot to have a little taste of Spain, and I'd like to come back to taste the other dishes."}
{"text":"I have dined here on and off over the years they have been in business & their food & service is consistently  good.  This time I came with a group of about 25 people for lunch as we do on a monthly basis at various venues. Regardless if you are with a large group or an intimate party of 2 their kitchen and staff responds to you in the same way.
The chimichurri sauce is good on anything. I believe I could eat it off the spoon! The Paella is good but then again I come from a family whose ancestors are Castillians that migrated to the pacific islands so I'm somewhat biased. But save room for the Tres Leches cake as it it to die for!"}
{"text":"Do you want a little taste of Spain? If so, you must try the paella, It's delicious!  The food at Miro's is excellent their garlic shrimp is one of my favorite appetizers there.  Although there hasn't been one thing I've ordered that hasn't been good the paella is my absolute favorite!  Oh and don't forget to leave room for their desert their Tres Leche cake is superb!"}
{"text":"Wow, Not too many places you can get Paella and theirs is FANASTIC.  Everything was great, beautiful restaurant, nice atmosphere, friendly, attentive staff, perfect.

Highly recommend a visit or two, or three"}
{"text":"Food was good. Great service. Staff was really attentive. I loved the soft buttery dinner rolls with spicy dips. We ordered entrée PAELLA DE CARNE. It's delicious. This plate has it all, taste was good. But it was too much food for 3 of us. I totally loved the food, will Definitely go to try something  new."}
{"text":"1st time going here and the food was amazing.  Looking forward in going back with family."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant.   We always sit at the bar and eat.  The food is great and the staff very accommodating.  Check out their new location next to Earth Fare in Ballantyne.  We are definitely fans!!"}
{"text":"WOW! Who knew...we just discovered Miro, our family truly enjoyed our dinning experience. The parking lot is not the ideal location when dinning in the patio ...somehow it did not create a hindrance. Normally, we would have opted to dine in but in all honesty with the heat lamp on and surrounded with family somehow we omitted the sterile surroundings. 
We are OUTDOOR folks, it worked ;) 

Calamares & chorizo salteado: (starters)
Both were very nice, I loved the calamari over the chorizo albeit they were both worthy of ordering again! 

Meat paella:
Excellent!! Moist & filled with yummy flavors! I love that you get to opt out of certain ingredients and double UP on others, customizable paella catapults the dish to the 10th power. 

Fillet: 
The filet was cooked to perfection and very tasty! 

Zarzuela De Mariscos:
The \"ONLY\" dish that my daughter & husband (both) said they would not order again was the \"Zarzuela De Mariscos.\" 

The broth unfortunately was not special, it tasted like it was out of a can (tomato soup). I am sure it was not, however, IF one was doing a blind test it could have easily passed for a canned soup :( 
It was void of REAL substance especially for a seafood stew. They need to reinvent this dish as seafood stew broths should be hearty not a thin light watery broth. :/ 
My husband orders seafood stew ANY chance he gets, in the U.S. or outside the states & he conveyed that their broth sits at the very bottom of his list :/  HE WAS BUMMED! 
*LIVE & LEARN, next time will skip the above dish & order a fish dish.

Sangria:
We ordered 2 carafes as it was delicious!!

Tres Leche 
Their version of \"tres leche\" was straight PERFECTION! 
I never cared for tres leche ...I WOULD order it AGAIN as it's not overly sweet like most. Great balance of liquid (not a spongy mess) as well as sweetness. 
#nailedit

Our server was impeccable...honestly our server could not have possibly been anymore accommodating! 
***** 5 Stars for our service!!


Buen provecho!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here to celebrate a special occasion and were not disappointed. The place has a high end feel to it, but still not overly expensive and you can can also dress casual. There were plenty of people here in shorts. 
Our waiter was very knowledgeable and attentive. He made us feel very special. I had one of the specials for the night and it was fantastic. We had a great bottle of spanish wine recommended by our waiter. This place has a great dessert selection. They bring out a big plate with many amazing deserts on it. We had the Tres Leches cake, recommended by our waiter. This cake was amazing. It was the moistest cake I've ever had in my life. This cake was so moist, it was like liquid standing up. I can't believe it didn't just flow out onto the plate.
After dinner we drifted over to the bar area and had 2 of the best Mojito's I've had in Charlotte. So, overall, a 5 star experience."}
{"text":"If I return, it'll be for the Tres Leches Cake. Now granted, this restaurant isn't horrible, not even close. But I expected a lot more. I made a reservation for 5pm and only had 1 hour to eat before we had to be at an event. It was perfect timing. They have very fast service! We were seated immediately and our server was A+!! There are so many wonderful options on the menu and I wanted to try everything!! I ordered 2 appetizers, the Fried Calamares & Gratinadas; the Churrasco de Cerdo entree (My friend got the Paella Valenciana); and the Tres Leches Cake for dessert. Overall, everything was pretty bland. It wasn't that burst of flavor that I was expecting. Everything needed salt. The calamari was fried but not to a crisp, I was sooo disappointed with this because I order Calamari literally every time I see it on the menu. I love it! But it just was not good here. I did enjoy the Scallops once I put some additional salt on it. The scallops were cooked perfectly and were nice and plump. I could have had that for my entree. My entree was decent, but again, pretty bland. After seeing all of the reviews for the Tres Leches Cake we just had to try that and we are so glad we did. It turned our disappointment of a mediocre meal into a great big smile walking out. Our server even put little designs on the plate. It was hands down the best i've ever tasted."}
{"text":"A five star experience! I proposed to my girlfriend here and Mio's did not disappoint! The paella was amazing, the wait staff was phenomenal and the ambience perfect. As an added bonus she said yes!  It's deceptive as the enterance makes the restaurant appear smaller than it is inside. I proposed here because we'd met in Spain four years ago and wanted to recapture in some small way our time there when proposing. I highly recommend Miro for its ambience, caring wait staff and food!"}
{"text":"This restaurant consistently delivers excellent food and top notch service.  Officially my favorite restaurant in Charlotte.  This evening our server was Jay who recommended the special, a grilled fresh snapper with a tasty sauce and shrimp.  The dessert recommendation was the Italian cream cake which was wonderful.  Thank you Jay for the stellar service.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Again, Yelp has helped me select a winner for my dinner evening. This particular Tuesday night at Miro, the restaurant was mostly empty other than about 6 dinner guests and a few at the bar. I always prefer a plethora of seats to choose from on a less occupied night, than being wedged in somewhere less desirable on a packed night.

Our server was friendly, and made knowledgeable recommendations about the menu. For our appetizers, we ordered Langostinos a Pil Pil, which are plump shrimp tossed in a spicy garlic sauce. There were four in a bowl, which is just right because the entrees would be filling. I certainly wouldn't have minded eating 10 of these babies- it was pretty good. Second appetizer was the baked Parmesan scallops, which our server pointed out was a customer favorite. That dish was also eaten quickly, and enjoyed immensely.

After going back and forth over which entree to choose, the grouper dish and the paella were chosen. Little more needs to be said other than a few bites in, we decided to add this place into our restaurant rotation. I saw about 5 other selections I am excited to try on return trips.

We shared laughs with our server plus others who came over to remove plates and refill glasses. 

My dinner guests are always complimenting my knack of finding great places to dine out at. I'm thrilled they aren't app savvy, and have no idea how to even use social media. Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, who make my food excursion choices look innate and effortless."}
