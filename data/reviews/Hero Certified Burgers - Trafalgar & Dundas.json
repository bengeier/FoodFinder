{"text":"\"Meh. I've experienced better\" is right.

Went there a few weeks ago after driving past The Works and opting not to wait in line. I was excited to eat at Hero because i thought it would be really good and some specialty burger place. Nope. Sure, it looks nice on the outside and inside but thats about it. The service was good too I'll add. However; I've had better burgers at McDonalds. No, I'm not joking. A quarter pounder tastes better than the Hero Burger I had. Bear in mind I'm a \"plain jane\" kinda girl so my burger had pretty much nothing on it. Regardless I expected some spice or flavor to the pattty...nope. It tasted like one of those \"no name\" box brands from the grocery store. My boyfriend said his burger was ok. I had the fries, not crispy. at all. Fries HAVE to be crispy ok. Boyfriend had this poutine concoction they had something to do with mushrooms..on the menu it looked great(pictured) when he got his poutine it looked like slop in a cup.

So please, if you want a yummy burger(even if the burger only has ketchup, mustard and lettuce) go to The Works(we ended up going there last week) now they make a friggin good burger!!! The fries are crispy too! LOL"}
{"text":"One of my favourite burger places!!  Hormone free and tasty.  I love the hero sauce!  A better choice over the other fast food chains!"}
{"text":"I have no problem with the creative and diverse selection of burgers and quality of the burger at hero. The burger was cooked well, tasted great and served warm. The fries you will either love them or hate them. They were sweet and tender but a bit on the soggy side. The only problem I had was seeing the two cooks and order taker standing around and talking while I waited 15 minutes for my order. I was surprized to see a forth person come out from the back after cooking the fries. It was not busy at the time. I am not the type to easily give a negative review and I did find the order taker was friendly and attentive. He took my order really quickly but I expect quicker service if that is the case. If you are going to stand around and talk do so in an area where the customer cannot see you, otherwise we will think you don't care about the customer. Also, I paid $35 for two burger combos which I consider quite expensive."}
{"text":"Nice place to eat, been here a few times. It's definitely not fast food, takes about 5-10 minutes to get your food. Polite service, good food, a bit pricey though."}
{"text":"I dunno what the heck some of the other reviewers are going on about, because I think this place is awesome!

The servers are very polite: there's a young woman there with brown hair who's super nice. The chefs have also engaged me in casual conversation on a couple of occasions.

Average ambience for a fast food place. They have really nice music. I like the bar-style seating near the window.

The food is very satisfying; the burgers are above average in size and are filling as all hell. The chefs do tend to go a bit topping-crazy, however, so the burgers can get a little sloppy from time to time. If you don't want a sloppy burger, don't order a ton of toppings.

The one thing that prevents me from giving a five star review is the prices. It's VERY pricey: you can expect to pay 13$ or more for a combo, and that's not including the \"extra\" toppings (which can sometimes cost 2$ each). Considering that most fast food is aboit 9$ for a really good combo, it's quite expensive. Feel that scorching pain on your rear? That's Hero Burger burning a hole in your wallet. 

Overall, a really good burger place in a convenient location."}
{"text":"I have always had a good experience here. The food has been fresh and made quickly. My order has always been correct and the place is clean and there's always somewhere to sit. I would recommend this."}
{"text":"Nice people, nice service but everything was greasy. Soft potatoes, even if the burgers were hormone-free their tastes were like the cheapest brands at grocery stores. Overpriced, wouldn't recommend."}
