{"text":"Awesome Service!! We sat in the upstairs restaurant and the owner was sooo nice and attentive to us that we would go back for that reason alone. The food was delicious and definitely better than some of the more popular Ethiopian spots in town. 

We especially appreciated that he gave us a pitcher of water for the table without us having to ask for it, cuz everyone hates having to ask/wait for water again and again through a meal.

He told us this place is open till 2 or 3 am  on the weekends which is AMAZING. No more late-night Swatow after the club :)"}
{"text":"We went there on a Friday night using a coupon.
We had the vegetarian platter - yummy! I really liked it. Wasn't too oily or anything. 
Was served on a huge injera, and we also got a couple more on a side plate, was more then plenty!
We hardly finished, was very filling and tasty.
The owner and the waitress were extremely nice and attentive. The owner gave us a thorough explanation about the curries, homemade cheese and injera, which I really liked. The place had a homey and pleasant atmosphere.
I highly recommend going there. They are a bit expensive for me, hence the 4 star, but since we got a coupon, I can't complain! 
Try it out!"}
{"text":"Really loved my meal from this place. 

I went around 2 am, and will admit I was a little hesitant at first. My main concern was that we would be served old food that had been sitting in warmers all night, but I am please to say I was proven completely wrong. As soon as we ordered the owner was back in the kitchen chopping and cooking up a storm. We were the only ones in the restaurant and it took some time to get the food out, but even though I was starving I was so thankful that it was all made fresh. 

The owner is one of the nicest guys I've ever met, not to mention a great server and cook. We got the two person platter, which has a large variety of different Ethiopian foods served on injera bread. He explained all of the dishes to us and talked a bit about how he uses only fresh ingredients and sauces. He also came halfway through our meal and gave us a free plate of extra injera bread since we were devouring what we had.

I will admit that I am not very experienced in Ethiopian food, but I figure my uneducated perspective is useful to anyone in the same boat as me. Since I can't comment to much on any dishes being particularly good for the genre, I will say the food here is fresh and homemade with quality ingredients. The only detractors for me are that it is on the expensive side and that the decor and vibe of the place are lacking (if you're looking for something for a date etc). Overall though, great place!"}
{"text":"Abssynia is a great restaurant owned by (to borrow the words of a previous poster) \"quite possibly the friendliest man in toronto\". The owner cooks everything from fresh ingredients and is completely enthusiastic about showing you the proper way to eat with your hands, a technique that he, admittedly, makes look a lot easier than it is. By the end though, I was shovelling the deliciously spiced food into my mouth with no concern for politeness or proper ethiopian ettiquette.

My party and I found this place after going to taco el asador on a sunday and finding out it wouldnt be open for another hour. Rather than get korean food in korean town (because that would make too much sense) we found great reviews for Abssynia on yelp. and it did not diappoint!

Our group of five had the vegetarian platter and the meat platter. We had enough food to feed us all twice over. The platters are a must get because they give you a chance to taste a little ( more like, a lot) of everything. It's all served on fluffy ethiopian bread (which he ggladly explains the background and cooking techniques of). WE finished off with freshly popped popcorn and ethiopian coffee, which he roasted right after we ordered, even showing us the beans mid-process and letting us have a whiff.

Abyssinia is definitely somewhere I would go again, even on days where I'm not craving a particularly ethnic sort of food. It is five star, for sure. Decor could use some work but who really cares when the food is so good?"}
{"text":"When I was a lad, there were three things on TV you couldn't avoid; Three's Company, Ronald Reagan, and people starving in Ethiopia.  So whenever I even hear the name, \"Ethiopia,\" all I can think of are kids with flies on their face, people staving to death, and air dropping crates of grain into a village.

One day, my sister in law brought us some leftovers from an Ethiopian restaurant and there was enough food there to fill my wife and myself up.  That's a lot of leftovers considering I'm a remorseless eating machine!  I thought to myself, \"Who would associate Ethiopians with loads of food?  I gotta try this for myself one day!\"

So sure enough, 3 years later we got around to going to Abyssinia on Bloore and Christie.  What better place to eat Ethiopian food than in Korea town?

The decore and atmosphere isn't that great, but who gives a shit?  You're not eating the wallpaper!  My wife and I got a platter for two and it was awesome!  It's a selection of dollops from just about everything on menu served on this great spongy bread.  It will fill you up in no time!

The way you eat it is with your hands, so don't go there with people you're grossed out by.  I went with my wife which was fine, but I can't imagine going there with my shithead friends who prompt me to smell their fingers after they've been on a date.

The guy who served us also cooked everything himself.  He was extremely friendly and very personable.  I'd definitely recommend this place.

I do have to wonder if the Ethiopians are aware they are known for starving to death since the 1980's, and they overcompensate by stuffing the us so full of food, we have no choice but think of Ethiopian's as over eaters!  

Maybe I'm over thinking it."}
{"text":"This is a tasty spot owned by quite possibly the friendliest man in Toronto. As soon as I walked in, he made me feel welcome and chatted with me a bit after I ordered.

I ordered the vegetarian platter to go, and mentioned that I'm allergic to dairy. He told me that the salad usually has dairy, so he'd whip up a salad dressing that was vegan. He started working away with some fresh lemons, garlic and chickpea paste. It was really delicious. He made a ton of it, so he gave me half the salad to eat in the restaurant while he was preparing the rest of my meal. When it was ready, he explained what everything was to me. I really appreciated this because I don't know what anything is, even though I've had Ethiopian food several times. 

The injera was really flavourful as were all the stews. It was on the mild side... I always forget to ask for hot sauce. I've been craving Ethiopian food for weeks and it really hit the spot. Best of all, I have leftovers for lunch today! 

The service really brought it over the top. It's great to walk out of a place feeling like you've really been taken care of. It's right across the street from Christie subway station and Christie Pits park, making it an ideal place to grab something to go and enjoying it on a nice, sunny day. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"These guys just celebrated their 1 year anniversary of being open a couple weeks ago.

So I will caveat my review with the fact that I came here when I was drunk after a night over at Clinton's.

They owner was a really nice guy. I asked him to surprise me so he made up his own concoction of a wrap. It was delicious! I have no clue what he put on it since I was too drunk to be paying attention, but I do know for sure that he crushed up some Doritos on it.

Such good drunk food."}
{"text":"used a groupon coupon to come here. The service is amazing. The only reason for the four stars is the price but this is really a culinary experience that everyone should try. 

Since it was our first time, the owner pretty much made a dinner recommendation for us. The traditional bread (injera) made fresh with buckwheat is delicious served with the meal. 

We ended with a coffee ceremony served with popcorn. They roast the coffee in house and it is delicious. 

Recommended for: late night, adventerous foodies."}
{"text":"Walking past this place, you'd think it was nothing but a fast Ethiopian food joint/cafe.

We luckily found out, that there's a nice restaurant above.  Seemed to be one of Bloor Court's sweet secrets.  (This restaurant is at Bloor X Christie).

Very friendly service from the gentleman on the main floor.  We felt a bit like family, and were encouraged to check out the menu on the upper level.  People dining there seemed to be regulars.

My companion and I both had the veg platter ($20.99 for two).

Lovely curries, the cabbage was so nice!  The Greek salad in the middle was a too salty, but we still ate most of it.  (and downed several glasses of water/beer while at it).  

Staff was attentive, without being ingenuous or intrusive.

We'll definitely be going again!"}
