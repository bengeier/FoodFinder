{"text":"Coming to this place is like rolling the dice and praying for meat that isnt too chewy or sushi that isnt too funky. It was definitely better a few years ago and has since gone downhill. Service is not so great either. If you get a waitress that speaks english then consider yourself lucky!! I'm asian so thats not racist."}
{"text":"Love this sushi place! I work close by and my group of coworkers would come here often. Make resos if you're coming for lunch on Fridays. The kitchen is really small so it does take a while for food to come out of you're with a large group.  I always get the Lola bento box - you get a choice of main dish (chicken, salmon, beef, various sushi, etc) with your Japanese bento box staples (few rolls, salad, rice, miso, tempura, fruit). Dynamite roll is really good too - pretty big serving - enough for a nice lunch!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal hand rolls and maki rolls (spicy salmon/tuna/crab)!"}
{"text":"Very good sushi, extremely generous portions (both fish cuts and tempura servings), and incredibly reasonable prices make this place an excellent Young and Eg sushi find. Our server was incredibly friendly in a grandmotherly kind of way...another plus.  The space is super narrow, but little shoji screens between tables and dark wall coverings make it feel more intimate than cramped.   It's not the best sushi in the city, but it's definitely worth a visit if you're in the neighborhood and have a hankering for some sushi."}
{"text":"Very pleasant family run business. The menu has a good range of traditional sushi but tucked away is some good Korean food. The udong is excellent."}
{"text":"Great vegetable spring rolls. They're small (6 per order) so get a few orders. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Vegetarians/vegans: menu items marked as vegetarian might not be veg.   We ordered the Vegetable Soon Tofu Soup because it was marked as vegetarian. I asked the waiter to double check if it really was. She told me there is beef in the broth. She also told me that's there's dairy in the tempura batter and fish in the miso soup.    Really good service, but tricky to navigate the menu if you're veg! Be prepared to double check everything."}
{"text":"Not only is the food incredible, it's the service that keeps us coming. Amazing people - can't get enough of this place."}
{"text":"This place may be good for sushi, but not for Korean food, which is shocking, given the fact that the entire staff is Korean. I ordered my go-to dish, dolsot bibimbap, but they don't offer banchan (side dishes), not even kimchi! How can that be, with so many excellent Korean restos in Toronto who not only provide banchan with every main dish, but often refill them for free? Instead, I just got the usual miso soup and a small, uninteresting salad. Also, the veggie toppings on the bibimbap were rather uninspired. This is a shame, since this is the only resto in the area offering Korean cuisine."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite sushi place, thanks to my boyfriend taking me here!  My boyfriend used to work around the area a couple years ago, and he used to come here for lunch all the time so one day he took me here and I ended up loving this place.    First, this place is owned by a korean couple and they are so sweet and friendly.  Second, everthing i tried were good and it is so filling!  I always order the lola bento, which includes soup, salad, tempura, 4 rolls, white rice and  \"choice\", i always go with the 7 pieces sashimi.  The pieces of sashimi are always thick, tempura is one of the best here, and the wasabi here is actually good. The wasabi at some other japanese places suck and I find that if wasabi at a restaurant is bad, it' not worth going back because wasabi is one of the most basic things.  My boyfriend always order the chicken kara age bento and he loves it, he only orders that every time we go.    it is hard to find parking, but it is close to the egliton subway station."}
{"text":"This is my go-to sushi place at Yonge and Eglinton. I have tried many sushi places in the area and this is my favourite for both food and service. The head waitress (and possibly owner as well) is always there and she's always cheerful. I like that they can also deliver within the area, although most of the time I go to pickup my order. They'll even serve you tea if your order is not yet ready. Their spicy salmon rolls are great!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite low-key sushi spots. Not only for the sushi but also for some of the Korean dishes that can be found on the menu.   I'm there at least twice a month for the seafood soon tofu chigae which is piping hot (spicy and temperature) and absolutely delicious. Come summertime, I'm usually ordering up the Hwaedupbap (sashimi with rice, vegetables, and a Korean chili sauce).   The spicy rolls are great (and come out in huge portions) and the sushi pizza is probably one of the best I've ever had in Toronto. The pizza base of rice is always fresh fried and crispy and the raw salmon and avocado piled on top is tasty.   It's easy to blink and miss this restaurant but go looking for it and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Definitely some of the best sushi in Toronto. The prices are reasonable and the venti boxes big and filling. I would definitely recommend the spicy Maki set, so fresh and delicious! The staff is super friendly and helpful! Whenever I get that sushi craving Sushi Lola is a must visit for sure!"}
{"text":"A great little sushi place, good sized portions and fair price. Have been several times and the good is always fresh and service pleasant and fast. It gets busy at lunch so get there early to get a seat. Also one nice thing is that they don't have any TVs blaring away in the background and it's generally a quiet place to talk or catch up on the news."}
{"text":"If there's one thing that's intolerable, it's being served food that's gone bad.  Unfortunately, my boyfriend consumed some bad tuna and was sick for most of our vacation which we went on the following day. EEK!  The rest of our food was fine, but he got sick from the Spicy Tuna Roll (we're 100% certain as I didn't eat any; I'm allergic to the tempura inside).  10/10 would not risk it again."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner last night with the girlfriend, ordered way too much (as always) But it was all very delicious and fresh. No complaints. We got the butterfish sashimi, salmon sashimi, unagi nigiri, black caterpillar roll, spicy scallop roll (awesome) and a lobster roll. Not a spec of food was left! Will definitely be back to this local joint."}
{"text":"The kind of place you will grow to love unconditionally within their humble interior and hardworking people. I keep on visiting them, craving for the fresh salmon that melts in your mouth and majestic rolls.   I go for Lola's sushi with my boyfriend and we splurge as if there was no check in the end, we have our appetizers, miso soup, hot sake on the side, numerous rolls and a dessert for sure and end up paying $38 for both, buttons loose and happier than ever. They well deserve our money, so we keep going back on regular basis.   It's not even just another sushi place, it's kind of a happy place, mellow background music, incredibly tiny yet efficient use of space and servers with smiles that never rest."}
{"text":"Chirashi bowl: good Galbi: good, but needs more marinade Dolsot bibimbap: average, sauce is too sweet and not spicy enough  Nothing was done wrong, but nothing was extraordinary."}
{"text":"Lola is probably the best sushi in Toronto! I have dragged my friends across Toronto to Lola and now they have become stable biweekly costumers at Lola. Fresh and generous sushi. The amazing freshness of the fish is not overshadowed by unnecessary amount of rice you would find in other sushi places. The sashimi is unlike anywhere else. And the stuff off the grill or their Korean menu is also impressive."}
{"text":"My co-worker and I discovered this place about a month ago, and now we go there at least once every week for lunch.  There are at least 10 sushi bar around Yonge & Eglinton and this is the best. The fish at Lola are fresh and the service is top notch.  Their lunch manual is great, and I love their bento set. Because other sushi bar usually have lame maki rolls like cucumber or avocado rolls as fillers in their bento sets. But not at Lola, everything that comes with the bento is great.  Their super-bento on the lunch manual is definitely my favorite. It has 4 maki rolls (not cucumber or avocado), 8 piece of sashimi, 5 piece of sushi, some shrimp and potato tempura, and a little side dish and a blow of rice. It also comes with miso soup and salad. And all that is just for $12.95  If you work on Yonge & Eglinton, you have to try this place out. It's on Yonge and it's about 5 minute (walking) down south of Eglinton"}
{"text":"My friends and I came here last Saturday night because of the highly acclaimed Yelp rating and man, were we disappointed.  We ordered the 55pc sushi and maki combo and asked to switch all the sushi to be salmon instead of the regular variety but we were told that we weren't allowed to make substitutions. I thought that was strange since most places will allow that accommodation as salmon tends to be cheaper than other fish (like unagi). But once the food came, I knew why. Not one piece within the selection of sushi was notable, with subpar salmon sadly being the \"best one\". While the portion sizes were fair and nothing tasted \"bad\", the sashimi was not fresh, the white tuna was served the wrong temperature, and the white snapper was very chewy. Furthermore, the maki rolls were very disappointing. Made with cheap ingredients with high rice-to-filling ratio, they were considerably low-quality rolls.   I rationalize that the Yelp rating here is so high because there aren't many other sushi restaurants in the area, which is fair for the locals.. but coming from downtown Toronto and uptown GTA, let me tell you that there this is SO much better out there! Go out and explore the amazing sushi scene that Toronto has to offer!"}
{"text":"This is definitely my favourite sushi place. Staff is extremely friendly, these guys are working hard to please their customers. Their fish is always fresh, full of flavour and made to order. Tried several different options and never been disappointed. Love it!"}
{"text":"Great prices with good variety.   Went here in the evening on a weekday as a party of 3. The restaurant it self is quite small but I think the decor really makes it seem quite cozy.   I ordered the super bento combo which came with sashimi, sushi, and tempura. Which I think with the addition of $2 for dinner was $14? Very reasonable.  The fish was a bit hit or miss. I find it very difficult to find good tuna here in the city, at least at these price points, but the salmon was generally ok. Some pieces were better than others.   The tempura however in my opinion was battered too much. While the outside was crispy, the inner layer was still a bit soft.   Overall, for the variety you get it's a great deal but you get what you pay for in terms of quality."}
{"text":"Love it! Best Sushi in Toronto hands down! I send all my friends there and eat there on a weekly basis, I also order take out every other week, and the Spicy Tuna is the best but they have an exciting menu with loads of interesting stuff! Yes Yes!!!"}
{"text":"By far the best Sushi in the neighborhood!  I went here many times with my wife as we lived right on Davisville.  The staff are friendly and courteous and their Agedashi tofu the best I've ever had!...in Toronto or NY."}
{"text":"Excellent service, food, dine-in or take out. No charge for delivery.  I recommend any of their Bento sets!"}
{"text":"good enough but not great.. friendly, yes, but i can't say it was the best sushi, although, i am from Vancouver so i guess i can say I'm a little harder to satisfy in fresh fish department?"}
{"text":"Story time!  A long time ago back when I was still just starting my sushi escapades (read: ~30 pounds lighter), there was a family owned sushi restaurant located in a very convenient location for me and my friends.  We would gather there, get familiar with the owners, eat to our hearts content, and always have a great time.  One week, we headed there to find that the restaurant had in fact closed down without any prior notice... it was a sad day for us all. The restaurant was unique in their dishes, especially their spicy salmon roll.  Simply put, to this day, there has only been one place that has able to stand it's ground against it.  And the only reason it can is because of the fact that they are(were) sister restaurants, owned by the same person.   If you haven't guessed, Lola sushi is said restaurant.   To this day, Lola has been the one restaurant I've found myself willing to drive over 40 minutes to get to.  They have the sushi rolls that no one has come close to competing with, for one main reason: they don't skimp on the ingredients.    Time and time again, sushi restaurant after sushi restaurant will find a way to maximize their profits: whether through increasing vegetable-to-meat ratios, over-packing the rice on the rolls, or just simply providing little/no meat to their rolls. This is not the case with Lola.  If you haven't already taken a look at the gallery on here, you can tell.  They add gratuitous amounts of filling for the salmon rolls, their lobster roll actually has a good amount of lobster in it, and their sunset crab roll is simply extravagant (these are my top 3 rolls at this restaurant by the way).   While I'll admit that their decor and service is somewhat lacking, I find myself biased in my review this time around because of the fact that it their rolls are simply on a whole other level than other places. With rather attractive menu prices, you can have yourself a grand feast and then some for much less than you would at other restaurants.  At the end of the day, Lola Sushi brings me back to a younger time back when I was just discovering Toronto/GTA's sushi. And it'll probably remain on the top of my a-la-carte restaurants for a long time to come.   This place is a definite try.  Please go!"}
{"text":"A solid sushi restaurant with amazingly friendly service. An added bonus is that Lola consistently passes it's health inspection, unlike some other sushi joints in the area."}
{"text":"When i lived in this area i only ate at one sushi place, Lola Sushi.  A lot of these other sushi places are the same in the way they prepare and create the sushi but Lola does it with a twist.  For instance, my favourite roll, Spicy Tuna, has more spicy tuna and tempura bits all over the top.  All other rolls have a similar type of twist which is why i love this place so much.  If it doesn't have a small twist they quality and taste alone will make you salivate.  They make everything unique and exciting for the customer and their service, top notch.  One time i ordered take out and they forgot my drinks so they called and apologized and came back to drop them off but with a bowl of ice cream, now that how you make a customer come back.  i have referred a few friends who live in the area to this place because you will not find any better sushi around.  Even their dinners such as Chicken, Steak, Salmon Teriyaki, and/or Galbi are really good and the portion they give you is big enough for two meals.  Unfortunately i moved to the Danforth and i seriously can't find a contender to Lola...i will have to go back soon and say Hi to the friendly staff who know me by my first name HAHA.  i highly highly highly recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Collectively the best tasting rolls I have ever enjoyed; very inventive and delicious.  i highly recommend trying the spicy tuna roll.  This is a small operation so delivery can take a while sometimes but they are honest about that up front. The interior could use a makeover but nothing too bad.  The prices are great.  The service is friendly and accurate.  I like it a lot when a place remembers you after only a few visits. This is my favourite sushi place in Toronto. My favourite for many years used to be Sushi Supreme across and down the street but since finding Lola I am hooked. An added bonus is the wonderful gelato place (Gelato Simply Italian) two doors up for dessert."}
{"text":"Wow!  Thanks fellow Yelpers!  Based on your recommendations my family and I ate here tonight and it was great!  We ordered beef udon, California roll, sushi pizza and the Lola bento box with sashimi - there was salad (dressing was tangy and zippy) and miso soup.  There was one waitress and she did a great job maintaining all the customers and refilling water.  She was also very kind and helpful, like when we needed a smaller bowl or extra napkins.  Fish was fresh and texture smooth like butter.  The udon is one of the better ones one could have at a sushi/Korean resto.  Nice flavored broth.  Wasn't too salty.  And the price point was perfect.  Highly recommend this little gem along Yonge Street."}
{"text":"This is now my favourite sushi spot in Toronto. I've been here a few times, mostly for take out. They have a great selection for combo dishes and specialty rolls, and everything tastes really fresh.   My favourite roll is the Black Dragon, with tempura shrimp inside, topped with unagi and avocado.   Great value, especially if you share a variety of dishes with friends."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I had the pleasure of trying the Lola Bento and the Super Bento (on separate visits). Both came with sushi and sashimi that was incredibly fresh! The tempura was nice and crunchy as well! Overall a very pleasurable dining experience!!! (The rating is simply for the food, as the interior is quite simple, and the layout/floor plan is not the best, but that is all secondary when looking for a good meal, right?)."}
{"text":"I would have given this place a higher rating if it wasn't for the piece of plastic I found in their salad and their slow service. The green dragon roll was delicious though. However, I don't see myself visiting here in the near future."}
{"text":"After a string of visits to lousy sushi joints in the Yonge/Eglinton area (I'm looking at you, Sushi Rock), I was beginning to think I'd never get to eat some decent sushi in my neighborhood.  Enter Lola Sushi.  We were walking down Yonge and decided to take a chance on this place, which I'd passed many, many times without giving it a second thought.  I was a little worried at first, as it seemed to take a long time for our waitress to initially visit our table. (The entire staff seemed swamped with take-out orders.) But show up she did and from that point on, the service was quite fast and efficient.  We started with a Salmon Hand Roll each and I immediately knew that Lola Sushi was a cut above other establishments in the area. It was extremely well prepared with a generous serving of salmon. I can't remember the last time I've eaten a hand roll where the fish was present all the way to the last bite. Very impressive.  Our next course was an order of tempura vegetables, which contained two of the following: sweet potato, broccoli, onion, and zucchini. They arrived to the table piping hot and crispy, and accompanied by a soy-sauce based dip. This was quite tasty and you can't beat the price. ($3 for all that!)  Our main course was a platter that contained 35 pieces of sushi, including a series of rolls and nigiri. Again, the quality of the food was outstanding. The various sushi was all prepared extremely well, although we were a little surprised by the heavy-hand with which the wasabi was employed on certain pieces.  Could Lola Sushi be the best sushi joint in the Yonge and Eglinton area? Based on just the visit, I'd be inclined to say yes."}
{"text":"Recently tried  Lola on a year long tour of Toronto sushi restaurants, here' s my review:  Ambiance: Warm and charming atmosphere in a long, narrow space. It's also decorated with a touch of shabby chic that is uncommon in sushi restaurants but suits the area and floor plan well.   Service: Good, no complaints.  Price: You really can't be beat-- this is probably the most bang for my buck I've EVER got at a decent sushi restaurant. Definitely THE choice if you're looking for a filling meal.  Food: As far as budget sushi goes, this is good, and VERY filling-- I especially enjoyed the spicy rolls. Is it excellent? No. Does it have any 'wow' factor? No... but it tastes right and is decently made, and you can enjoy complimentary tea and miso soup, which is always nice.   In sum: I enjoyed Lola as a sushi option and can definitely see myself bringing friends to introduce them to sushi in a warm, charming restaurant. Otherwise, it's also a great restaurant to keep in your back pocket if you're looking to satisfy a sushi craving without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"Looooove this place, have been here so many times and never disappointed! Their spicy salmon is my favorite compared to any other sushi place I've been to (and I've been to many), as they add tempura bits and spicy mayo on top - ((OMG)). The prices are great too. The bento boxes are also great deals, used to get them all the time :) Very nice staff, and cozy atmosphere, I'm going back as soon as I get the chance!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a cheap and filling sushi lunch you can't go wrong with Lola. Bentos start at around $8 and have all the standards you'd expect... Sushi, sashimi, bulgogi, etc.  As an added bonus, they also have Korean food such as BiBimBap.   They might not look like much, and their sushi wraps might not always be perfect, but this place is packed with good food and value."}
{"text":"2.5/5, +.5 for service  If this is the best that the Yonge-Eglinton area can offer in terms of sushi, I probably will skip this neighbourhood if I'm looking for a balance between good quality sushi and good prices.  The first thing I realized when I arrived for lunch was the lack of lunch specials. Although there are plenty of options available (such as maki sets), I expected a separate menu for lunch items, similar to pretty much every single Japanese restaurant I go to.  I ordered the SM-1 sushi/maki set, which came with a soup and salad. The soup was okay, though the salad quantity was lower than I expected. Not a huge issue; it's salad after all. The actual sushi and maki had a couple of issues: The maki pieces (california roll) did not stick very well. Two of the six pieces fell off immediately after I grabbed it with chopsticks. Also, I found the raw fish/rice ratio to be too high; there was a lot of rice with not a lot of fish, and I found myself quite full at around 75% completion (though I did manage to finish the set at the end). Also of note, their wasabi is very strong, so if you're weak in wasabi tolerance like me, ask them to not put it in. You have been warned.  For $12.95 plus tax it was definitely one of the higher end prices for my sushi lunch explorations, though I did get a few more pieces than usual. If they had a lunch special that was around $10 with two less pieces I would consider giving this place a second try. Service was good though; I didn't need to call any employees for them to take my order, refilling my tea, or asking for the bill."}
{"text":"This is a great little sushi spot, smack between Davisville and Eglinton.  I really like the bento boxes here.  There is a wide selection of them and they are very reasonably priced (mostly under $10).  I recommend the Lola Bento with sashimi, personally.  When you get tempura in your bento here, you get a lot of it, at least 6 or 7 big pieces.   It does look a bit like a hole in the wall from outside but is a very cute little spot once you get inside.  They even have little little privacy barriers between the tables.  And, the staff are very nice."}
{"text":"Amazing place.  Great ambiance.  Really amazinggggg and fresh food.  Very friendly service. Absolutely loved it and can't wait to go back! We ordered a maki set and  a bibimbap. All was very fresh and the bill was about $20 for two people. And it came with miso soup and salad too!"}
{"text":"I held of for a few days...deciding whether of not to join the throngs of people praising this restaurant for its great food and superb service.... But... in the end I couldn't hold back, Lola Sushi should not be selfishly kept a secret from Torontonians deserving of a mind-blowing food experience. Readers should know that this Kor-apanese hybrid restaurant serves up some tasty meals, at even tastier prices!  I had the Bulgogi bento (8 bucks) and my food partner in crime had Salmon Maki  (4 bucks) and Tuna Maki ( 4 bucks).  Stepping into Lola's makes you feel quite warm and cozified. It's a small little restaurant about 5 mins walk south of Eglington station. I live downtown, and I think Lola's is worth going uptown for. Rice paper screens partition the restaurant into enclosed cubicles, making dinner a pleasant intimate occasion for couples or a small group.  The service was friendly, and the food arrived promptly.   When my dish came to the table, at first I felt my heart sink a little because the portions were a bit on the smaller side. In comparison to the gargantuan bentos you get at Sushi on Bloor, the serving size of the bento's at Lola are much smaller. But Lola's gets a big gold star in my book for full on flavor. Overall the bulgogi was succulent, well spiced, and cooked with a nice assortment of veggies (not too many veggies though, bulgogi is a meat dish after all). The bento box included cold noodles, premium Japanese rice, a fresh salad with a really good dressing, miso soup and an orange. I give my meal 5 stars.  I was so engrossed in my meal, and I don't eat much raw fish, so I cant directly comment on the sushi platter my husband ordered, however he said that the fish was very fresh, the rolls were plump, the fish looked great, and smelt fresh.   Lola is lovely. Check her out!"}
{"text":"So this place for really high ratings and I decided to check it out. I don't know if it was an off day but it was awful. We ordered two different bento boxes. The rice was a small amount but what made it most unpleasant was the non crispy and very stale tempura batter. It's unfortunate that both our bento boxes had tempura shrimp and our sushi contained it. I always order spicy salmon at new places to see if they can make a decent roll. It was so underwhelming and the crunchy stuff in it was staleeeee. We were both so disappointed that we couldn't finish our food entirely. Never coming here again."}
{"text":"Had the super deluxe bento and thought it was great. You won't go hungry, even if you normally would at an a la carte sushi place.  The bulgogi was soft and tender. I wish it came with more sauce but the bulgogi was satisfying mixed with rice. The tempura was oily. I quite liked the sashimi and found the fish very soft and they were very thick cuts (so 9 pieces was more like 12). The rolls that people ordered at other tables looked very impressive as they were carried past.  Service is a bit slow. It was difficult getting a hold of them to place our order, or run up our bill. They're very busy at lunchtime, so you might want to make a reservation or risk having to stand and wait.  They have 10% off cash, if you buy more than $20 for takeout."}
{"text":"Ok so what's good about this place is definitely their prices - very good value for money here. But you get what you pay for - it's not super high quality. But hey, you want good sushi go to izzu at davisville and you'll double your bill.  The portions are generous and a must order is the spicy tuna rolls or spicy salmon rolls. They top o the rolls with more deep friend tuna or salmon in panko. Great touch and only for $6.   The interior is not the greatest, but it adds to the experience. The menu has both japanese and korean (since it's owned by koreans). But you're not getting the full service here like bibimbap in a stone bowl, etc.   I do have to say one thing though, i came here with four friends and one of them said he got food poisoning that night. I don't know if it was from Lola (we did have gelato next door after dinner) but it's worth mentioning.   I'm definitely going back though next time i want a cheap sushi night in the area. If someone gets sick again, then i know to keep away."}
{"text":"Was in the area for a massage and after was looking for a place to get dinner. Was kinda late and my boyfriend and i was just about to decide to go home and eat when we came across this tiny piece of coziness on the wall. We usually read reviews before eating at a place but this was one of those places that we just decided on the spot. Happy that we did! I had the Unagi don and it was delicious! The serving was generous that i even got to share some with my baby. He had a beef rice and it was equally as good. Both meals were filling. Now reading reviews i  wish i had ordered a bit of sashimi...well theres always a next time :)"}
{"text":"Nothing fancy here, but if you're looking for a no-frills and affordable Asian dinner then Lola is a pretty good choice. I'd say it's similar to Hosu in terms of pricing and quality. My favourite here is the black dragon roll, and bento sets are decent. It may take a while to get your order, but that only means food is prepared fresh."}
{"text":"I work near eglinton and bayview and my coworkers and i always order from lola whenever we crave sushi and they have NEVER let us down! because we order so often and so much from them they always deliver even if it's after their delivery time. My go-to is the spicy maki set---large quantity for such an affordable price! not to mention it is so gooood! I've also tried their korean menu, especially the kalbi beef and again, i have nothing bad to say. I like the fact that each order comes with miso soup and that they make an exception for us. would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I tried out the sashimi bento at lunch time and the small sushi  party tray for dinner. Both meals came with one of the freshest salmon sashimis I've ever had. The tuna sashimi was kinda tough so I'm not sure about the quality of that. unfortunately the meals weren't filling enough. I think it's a trade off between quality and quantity. also the restaurant smelled kinda old so I'm glad I got take outs instead."}
{"text":"Me and my colleagues LOVE this place and get food from there often. Everything is fresh, delicious and generous. Must try if you like sushi. Only thing is, the service can sometimes be slow and the seating is cramped, so we prefer to order in advance and pick it up.  While initially I loved the fact that they sprinkle a generous portion of tempura with fish bits on their spicy rolls, I now think it is a little heavy for lunch (too much fried stuff), so I ask them to leave out the tempura when I order. Either way it is delicious!"}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE. FOOD POISON.    I wish I went with my gut feeling when we walked in and I smelled mold. Yelpers- you have disappointed me. I have no idea how people could have given good ratings to this horrendous place.  The place was falling apart (the decor), but we chose to ignore that. The waitress was wearing short jean shorts and that was pretty damn weird, honestly. But again- whatever. Maybe the food will be good?   No. I had the chirashi and my boyfriend had some sushi combo. The fish tasted weird. Not smelly but it didn't taste good. The texture was off and grainy. Wtf?  On the drive home, I felt the bubbles in my stomach. Food poisoning all night. Both of us.   There's a better sushi place down the street. Go there instead."}
{"text":"The sushi here was pretty underwhelming considering all the good reviews. I've waaay better sushi in Mississauga even. None of the sushi was particularly fresh and the salad was average as well. The place was pretty empty although it was pretty early in the evening. I can't complain about the service though."}
{"text":"B3. Sashimi bento is the best bang for your buck... sashimi includes red tuna sashimi which is quite rare.  only downside is, its not the most filling meal."}
{"text":"Close to work, it's solid and fairly priced so its been a good option for lunch with coworkers.  I'm not over the moon about it, but it is the best sushi that I've been able to find in midtown."}
{"text":"Sorry to have to reiterate Millie S' bad review based on food poisoning (also mentioned in Imran N's review), but I had the worst case of my life after eating at Lola. I think it was bad shell-fish in the spicy-tofu soup rather than the sushi (which was shared) - but I was dehydrated nearly to the point of hospitalization after expelling out of every orifice for six hours.  Consider yourself forewarned."}
{"text":"I've been ehre many times as it's close to work. Constantly understaffed, so service takes forever during the lunch rush. Made the mistake of getting bulgogi once, HORRID. Soggy, disgusting mess that tasted like liver or old meat.    Sushi is ok, but the salmon and tuna rolls are way to greasy.  Sushimi assortment does not have butterfish.   Overall, I've stopped going."}
{"text":"The best sushi spot in the Yonge Eglinton / Davisville area. Excellent service by very friendly owners - they know their regulars and even occasional repeat customers by name. High quality for reasonable price. Highly recommend their spicy (come topped with a diced fish salad) and specialty rolls (try the sunset crab roll). Also a great place to grab takeout if you are in a rush - I often get the spicy maki set which is an amazing deal, so good i crave it for days after."}
