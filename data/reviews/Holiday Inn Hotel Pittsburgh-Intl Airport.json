{"text":"Booked from a 3rd party website and got an incredible deal.  For less than half of what it would have cost me to stay downtown, I got free parking, free wi-fi (worked perfectly fine for me) and a clean hotel room with a good view.  

If you are passing through and need a cheap place to crash, or just want convenience over the downtown scene, this is a great deal.  Only minus was that they didn't have a king/queen bed available and I was booked in a room with 2 double beds.  Not too big of a deal, but the king would have been nice -- and is pretty standard to find.

Also, as a rewards member, even though i don't get points for booking through hotwire, they did give me a coupon for a free appetizer at the in-hotel restaurant, which turned out to be an $8 value.  

Last time i went through pittsburgh, i stayed downtown at sheraton square and paid 2x as much, plus an extra $20 for parking and dealt with HORRIBLE rush hour traffic.  This time, i opted for being a little outside the city, had no issues with the commute or traffic, and the whole trip just went smoothly."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely disgusting!! Only two floors of the hotel are for the Holiday Inn. The rest is a dormitory for college kids. 
We had dinner at the restaurant - were starving when we arrived. The food was ice cold when we got it - and had no flavor. The cheesy gift shop was covered in dust. We had breakfast there too and that was absolutely ridiculous. The apples were brown to the core and the yogurt was lukewarm. I don't even kno why they open the restaurant. And the worst part about it is they charged almost $200/night for this dump. 
The rooms need an overhaul and they need to burn that disgusting kitchen down before someone gets food poisoning!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal hotel!  Cleaner than I expected after previous holiday inn stays.  Great bar located just outside lobby.   24 hour shuttle service for safe trips to local watering holes and a Primanti Bros down the street.   I will stay there again the next time I'm in Pitt!"}
{"text":"I'm diggin it so far. Old dude at the desk was really friendly. Checked in in like warp speed room very clean. The chick that rated this joint a one star must be REALLLLLy high maint. This place is done especially for the Hotwire price of $72!"}
{"text":"I booked this hotel on Priceline, and I was very happy with the outcome.  I flew in from Seattle, and had a three-hour delay in Atlanta.  So, instead of landing at midnight, I ended up landing at 3:30 am!  My brother drove several hours to come pick me up, and I didn't want him waiting for me at the airport.  I called the hotel, explained the situation to the hotel, and they let my brother stay in the room.  The 24-hour hotel shuttle arrived maybe ten minutes after I got to the pick-up area, so I didn't have to have my brother wake up to come and get me.  When I got to the hotel, John, the friendly receptionist at the front desk had my key card ready for me.  This was much appreciated!  The room was clean, the parking was free, and Sheetz was just down the road.  If I ever fly into Pittsburgh again, this is the place I will stay."}
{"text":"Holiday Inn, you are G-H-E-T-T-O. 

This is the first time Hotwire.com has ever let me DOWN! I always book 3 star hotels from hotwire whenever I'm going on a trip.  And this is my first and hopefully only time I will be disappointed.

My boyfriend even made a sad reference about Chingy's rap song, \"Holiday Inn\" ----  \"Chingy was wrong! Don't stay at the Holiday Inn!\"

The longest list of CONS in the world (and seriously all true):

1. The people working at the front desk hate their jobs and their lives. I'm not even sure if she looked up at me once...
2. They ran out of 1 bed rooms so we got 2 full beds. It's the 21st century... Are we really going to sleep on separate beds like our grandparents?
3. The remote control doesn't work. We call the front desk. \"We'll see what we can do *hang up*. (Given a new remote later in the night)
4. The towel rack is broken. We call the front desk to notify them.
5. The vent is sucking every bit of humidity in the air and I pay $4.50 for the 3 bottles of water I bought out of the vending machine so I don't feel so parched. I later put on my *thinking cap* and think to place a moistened towel over the vent to prevent this from continuing.
6. The lamp by the beds turns on by itself in the middle of the night. WTF. Ghost? I'm just paranoid and the button is loose? Either way I'll admit I was a little freaked out...
7. The outerlayer, heavier set of blinds don't close all the way. They're just there for looks. So the sun greets you in the morning.. hits you right in the eyes!
8. They provide 2 bars of soap and complimentary shampoo. That's great and all... but I have high expectations and would like the conditioner to go with my shampoo.
9. We come back after house cleaning to find a wet dirty used towel on the bedside table. EEK!!
10.  My 5 year old self was able to make beds better than the way we found them!

List of Pros:
1. Parking is free.
2. Free wi-fi.
3. I never have to stay here again!

Good grief."}
{"text":"So where to begin... This hotel also doubles as a type of \"dorm\" for Roger Morris University.  Students sit outside in groups smoking.  The rooms are very dated and the one I received was not very clean.  The bathroom was covered in hair that was not mine.  I actually took a shower wearing my flip flops.  It just occurred to me that I felt like I was back in college.  Upon arrival I was told that the water was out and \"should\" be back on at 6 in the morning.  Nothing like having to use the restroom and not being able to flush or wash your hands.  I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.  Also disappointed I used points for the room as it seems I could have gotten a better deal on Hotwire.  One thing that kept this from being a lower review is the older gentlemen at the front desk was friendly upon check in."}
{"text":"Clean room. Nice towels, swimming pool, and palce to rest your head before Tour De Cure and wine tasting. Manager lady maybe Maggie i think was  total B . Rude and unfriendly on the phone and even in person. I figured she was having a bad day but two run ins with her and you know that's just who she is. Younger staff was friendly and nice. She let us check in early and before we had it processed Maggie or whatever the managers name was, stepped it to tell us it was too soon to check in even though we had called ahead and the younger girl had told us the room was ready. Luckily enough dragon lady walked to the back and the girl got us squared away."}
{"text":"Best Chicken Wings I ever ate; large, meaty,and oh so juicy!"}
{"text":"First thing--the plus. 

Had an all-day meeting here, and I did not have to be wrapped in sixteen layers of clothing, because all the meeting rooms had a good temperature. To be honest, I'm giving it a star just for that, because so many other hotels can't figure that shit out.

The minuses.

The internet here is possibly the worst hotel internet I have ever experienced. That's a serious deal-killer for me, in a business hotel. 

The one overhead light in my room flickered on and off in a way that made me think I was about to appear as an extra in Hostel. 

The meeting food sucked. Seriously, you cannot serve Lender's bagels in a hotel. Just don't do it.

The place was full of guys who (I assume) are drilling for natural gas in the Marcellus Shale--given the number of pickup trucks with out-of-state plates in the parking lot. Said guys were extremely loud both of the nights I was there, and the walls are not thick."}
