{"text":"It's been awhile, but I remember being much more of a fan of this place than I had expected.  

This is really a bit of a template establishment; it takes on the personality of whoever inhabits it at any given moment.  Luckily, they seem to draw on a pretty rich and diverse pool of human resources.

Great stop for late night with a small to medium size group - also not a bad pre-concert launch point.

Have to remember to go hear again soon..."}
{"text":"When you want to do black sambuca shots with your friends, after you've been out for a really nice dinner....come here.

This place is open late.  Has cool pool tables, and even cooler jukebox, and a hip young crowd, or should I say diverse crowd that just seems to ebb and flow nicely as the wee hours wear on."}
{"text":"I didn't expect to have any fun in this place.  Sure it was my friend's birthday, and I would be in good company, but when a place has \"Wine Bar\" in its name, I immediately conjured images of a stuffy atmosphere where people were over dressed and wearing monocles.  Alex old boy, you were so wrong.

Not only do they serve beers for us common folk, they serve you stein's which amounts to something like 30 or 40oz of beer.  Immediately I felt more comfortable and liked this place a little more.

Novelty aside, it was a cool place.  If you call ahead and ask to book the back room, they'll let you do it so long as you guarantee enough people.  They'll even let you plug your ipod into the stereo, so you really get to define the atmosphere of the place."}
{"text":"So we stopped in here on our vacay in Toronto looking for a bar to enjoy the night at. Should have paid attention the warning signs. Place was empty. 

And so we proceeded to the bar, where we sampled some of their own Alio beer. Can I say yuck? Tasted like a bud or miller light. And worse, because it was warm and very foamy. Both of their own house made beers tasted awful. Thank goodness Stella was on tap...my go-to if nothing else is good. And my god, I never thought I'd run into bad Stella Artois in my lifetime, but I did at this bar. Again, foam crazy and warm. Tasted stale. 

Needless to say, we already ordered the beers and didn't want to waste full glasses. And had to finish them of course...so we did and left. Never again. Yuck is the word for this place."}
{"text":"Around 11pm we passed by and decided to stop for a drink. Not going to lie, at first sight it was definitely not convincing. Their interior is a bit run down and it was quite empty when we were there. We were definitely quite skeptical. 

Their beers on tap aren't that great but their cocktails and margaritas are a different story. I started with Sex on the Beach and Flirtini and they were both good, but weren't strong enough for my taste. Decided to give the Soho Lychee and Sprite a try. It was so good I ended up having 4 more and one of them a double. It was so good my boyfriend gave up his beer to have one too! 

Their prices are the most decent we've seen around that area so really couldn't complain about that! Beers were around $4 or $5 a pint I believe. Cocktails between $6-7. Margaritas $8.50."}
{"text":"Went here for a party, because my friend found the atmosphere to be perfect for him from a past visit. From what I see, it's quite a flexible one, with being able to do things like play music from your ipod on their stereo. Oddly enough, the biggest customers isn't Ryerson students like you'd expect given its location, but International students from Japan, as seen by the menus offering Japanese beers on the relatively cheap and maps/flyers for them. Might come down here again for their $8.50 schooners of decent house brew."}
{"text":"Went here last Saturday with my husband. Do not bother going. We should have known with it being a Saturday night and not a sole in the restaurant. Drinks were ok, dinner still took forever even though it was just us. Will never go back."}
