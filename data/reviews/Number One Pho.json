{"text":"This past year I have been here more then I can remember. Not by my choice, but because my co-workers prefer this place over Superior Pho.   It's typical Pho. Not the best, but not the worse I have ever had. I usually like getting the P5, but the tripe pieces are always too big. Maybe I will just stick with the rare beef and meat balls next time. The broth is not bad. I wish they would supply more hoisin and Sriracha sauce. Sometimes the small plate they give is not enough. My friends always have to take some from my supply, luckily I don't mind sharing.   My friend tried the chicken broken rice dish today and was disappointed. The meat was very very dry. I recommend staying with the grilled pork when eating the vermicelli or broken rice dishes.   I'm a big fan of summer rolls. Too bad they don't serve it with the traditional peanut sauce. It comes with hoisin sauce and crushed peanuts. Their bubble tea is ok. Prob not something I would come here just to order.   The staff/service are always nice. One waiter always remembers my friends order. One time we walked in and he had a diet coke a few minutes later on the table, without ever placing the order.   Would I come back? Sure."}
{"text":"We came one hour before their stated closing hours and the chef had already left for the night.  What a joke. Not sure what kind of restaurant operation they have going on here, but I'd go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Let me start this off by saying that I have been a huge fan of Number One Pho for about 6 years now.  I usually go to the one that's on W130th, but tonight I decided to try the downtown location.  Although it's not the first time I have been to that one, this is the first time I have experienced something so terrible at a place I thought could do no wrong.  Things started off rocky: the server seemed annoyed and didn't write down our order.  I note this because I believe it to be the reason I didn't receive my appetizer and my boyfriend got something different from what he asked for. Strike one. Eventually, I got my main course.  I always get the same kind of Pho, and it's usually amazing, but this time it was lukewarm and tasted off in a peculiar way I couldn't put my finger on.  Strike two. I suppose these are indiscretions I can overlook.  However, I have NEVER EVER had to fend off my food from so many insects while eating INDOORS!!  I noted at least three different species of flies, roughly eight of each kind constantly landing on the table, knocking against my head, and hovering around my drink and soup.  I had to keep pushing the thoughts of what condition the kitchen must be in if the dining room is like this out of my mind.  Needless to say, we were robbed of our appetites.  The food wasn't horrible, but what difference does the quality of the food make when it's covered in bugs?     After the food arrived the server was no where to be seen, he never came to see if everything was all right or if we needed anything.  When we had had enough I had to go hunt someone down and ask for the check.  It was a really gross experience and I will never go there again.  If I want Pho I'm going to Bac, which is where I would have gone if they had been open on Sundays.  EPIC FAIL."}
{"text":"The best pho around. I come here at least once a week. A8 appetizer and a B1."}
{"text":"I love this place for when I really want good pho and I want it fast!  While the neighborhood has perhaps seen better days, once inside I feel warm and welcomed.  The meals are ready very quickly, great for a winter's day.  I love the portions and toppings presented as well.  I always enjoy seeing a wide range of people here from couples to families to students and coworkers."}
{"text":"Okay Pho restaurant  if you expect the quality of food like big cities (chicago DC New York) you will be disappointed but come on here is cleveland and this is pretty good food  (sometimes service is terrible it really depends on waiter)"}
{"text":"We came here thinking it was Superior Pho. It wasn't. We realized that after.   However, Number One Pho was delicious. it was our first time having pho and it was a great experience.  The portions here are huge and the service quick. For the pho, you can choose between a small and large bowl. Go with the large--it's only a dollar more. And it is LARGE.   You really get to customize your pho. You can add bean sprouts, herbs, and jalape√±os to tweak the taste and texture. Additionally, you can add siracha or hoisin sauce to make your pho more spicy or sweet.  We had a lot of fun and plan on having many more pho dates in the future.   Minus one star though for the horrible apathetic server. We weren't greeted when we walked in. The server looked and acted as if he didn't want to be there and as if he didn't want us there either."}
{"text":"I don't get the hype here at all.   The first time I ever ate Pho was in the home of a Vietnamese friend. A few years later, #1 Pho opens up in Cleveland and that got me very excited.   \"Hooray!\" I thought, expecting a delicious soup similar to the one my friend made.   No, no, no! #1 Pho's pho (huh?!) was greasy, greasy, greasy!! Yuck. Granted, it's been a few years for me. But when I visited this restaurant, I vowed to never return.   Thank goodness I live in California now, where good Pho is plentiful."}
{"text":"Came here thinking it was Superior Pho, then realized our mistake when it was too late.   The pho was ok, but not the best. Then again, I think all pho is good. Vermicelli and noodle dishes weren't bad either, but it was nothing superb. The decor was pretty nice and the service was mediocre, so I can't say I had a bad dining experience.  Overall, just ok. Hopefully next time I'll get to try Superior Pho."}
{"text":"Friendly staff...we got combination pho which was so flavorful with tons of noodles and meats so good. We also got a mango bubble tea yummy. Accidentally came here looking for another place so glad we found it"}
{"text":"This place serves pho. That's not in dispute. Most other things are:  Is it good pho? It's OK. Is it good pho for Cleveland? Well, offhand I can think of 2 places with better pho in Cleveland. Is it appropriately priced? Personally I think it's overpriced.  I can think only of a couple reasons to come here vs. Superior Pho or the one on the West side: convenient, open on Sundays, wider menu than Superior, nicer place to take someone.  Otherwise, I avoid."}
{"text":"this place is great, i wish i had made my way there earlier in my days as a clevelander.  i think the location put me off for a while, because it's not really on the way to anywhere unless you're going downtown, and then chances are you're not taking superior.  anyways, much worth the trip(s!) fresh food, good atmosphere, affordable. great food."}
{"text":"I'm usually pretty happy with the pho here, but you might as well go across the street to Superior Pho and get the even better stuff"}
{"text":"Decided to come by here because Superior Pho next door was closed, and we were craving a hot bowl of pho on a chilly Cleveland day.   9/22/14 (Monday 7:00pm-8:00pm)  We entered through the front door and waited at the podium. The host/waiter made eye contact with us while he was at the cash register sorting some bills. He did not say anything to us while another customer came in forming a line behind us. Couple minutes later, we were seated. It was obvious this was a one man show, as our waiter was also the host and cashier. This was slightly problematic as there were at least half a dozen tables in both sections of the restaurant.   When he came to take our orders, we thought it was strange that he did not write anything down. He also took away my friends menu before she finished ordering and spoke with only a few grunts. (I assume he was probably the owner and also didn't speak very much English, as many asian restaurants are. Which is fine, but may be an issue for some people though)  Unfortunately, his lack of note-taking proved to be a problem. He (or the kitchen?) got my friends order wrong, as there were no meatballs in her bowl. Our bowls were also switched around. I can oversee the poor service, but unfortunately the food and drinks were also 1 star.   We ordered P10 and P6 (?) - both pho, mine was spicy and friend's was a meatball pho.   Pho 10: while a large portion and very filling, was very salty and tasted mediocre. I have had a lot of pho in the past and this was my least favorite.  Pho 6: lacking the meatballs that was listed in the description of the pho. We called over the waiter and heard him yell angrily into the kitchen for a side of meatballs. Sadly, the meatballs were cold and bobbed sadly like bouys in a pond of lukewarm soup. Also my friend said the pho was too salty.  Taro Bubble Tea: I consider myself a connoisseur of bubble tea, having sampled dozens of bubble tea places from the east to west coast (best in California!), and on the spectrum of awesomeness that is bubble tea, this was sadly one of the worst. You can clearly see the taro powder clinging to the side of the glass and throughout the drink--obviously not dissolved. And very watered down.  Thai Iced Tea: my friend ordered this, and said it was extremely watered down as well.   Because our pho was so salty, we drank our watered down drinks pretty fast. The server never checked up on us and we never got our waters. We had to ask for the bill as well.   Total: $27+tip  Overall, the quality and service were poor and not worth the money. But if you like your extra salty soup balanced by a watered down drink, this could be your utopia."}
{"text":"I go there once every other week and had enjoyed it immensely, however their latest server, youngster, that I haven't seen before has been giving me and a few others for being rude and looks angry all the time. If you get that server be warned, your dinner will be least to desire."}
{"text":"To even try to write a review about an Asian restaurant in Cleveland, I'm asking for trouble. So here I am, asking. I remember when #1 Pho opened. I tried to contain my excitement, because Pho (and Vietnamese food) done right is just heavenly. But #1 Pho is not heavenly. They did the right thing opening at this location, because they can pull a good lunch business from downtown workers desparate for a break from corned beef slop. They will probably always have a decent business going. Clevelanders just don't know about a real pho, and what it entails. The broth must be deeply flavorful and fresh(and there should be several varieties), the meats, seafoods, and vegetables must be sparkling fresh, and there MUST be plenty of fresh sliced hot jalapenos and pickled shallots, basil, sprouts and other delightful add-ins. So, how's the pho? Just average, I'm afraid. I've had vastly superior pho at strip-mall joints in Daly City, CA.! I've had an infinitely better Vietnamese crepe at Le Soleil in San Francisco. #1 Pho's Vietnamese crepe is greasy, they don't use fresh herbs like they should, and the fillings are subpar. The chicken in the cabbage and chicken salad (a standard dish and easy to make) is frozen dark-meat pulled chicken from Sysco, and the egg rolls that top the vermicelli bowl (another standard) are PRECOOKED, and not even hot when they serve them. That's just lazy cooking, kids. Hey, all of you Caucasians out there! They're laughing at you! There is still no good pho in Cleveland, but keep the faith, because our Asian population is growing. There WILL come a day."}
{"text":"I think the pho is pretty good as well as the other dishes. Get the summer rolls with peanut sauce. Its very tasty. They do have a decent atmosphere. Service can be a little slow sometimes."}
{"text":"This was my first exposure to Vietnamese food, and I was not disappointed. The grilled squid is delicious,  the pho is a meal unto itself, the ingredients fresh and simple, and the bubble tea is worth trying at least once. Parking can be a bit tricky on busier nights, but the service has always been good and the staff attentive, so it doesn't take long to get fed. Well worth the drive into town for the experience."}
{"text":"I have been visiting Number One Pho for about 5 or 6 years.  My wife and I found it one night when we had gotten fustrated with trying to find parking around Little Italy for the FOA.    Went over the Number One Pho for lunch today with a few friends.  I have eaten here many times, and I am usually pretty happy with the food.  The noodles were a bit starchy today, but overall we all enjoyed the experience.  I had the the shrimp and pork roles and pho bo vien-my personal favorite.    I have never really had a bad meal here, even though the thoughts on the food from my friends have been mixed - some folks just don't have a taste for it.    Regardless, the staff are prompt and treat their customers really well.  Just today, my friends wife ordered a coconut bubble tea.  They did not have coconut, but they did have strawberry.  She thought it was too sweet, and when the waiter noticed that she did not drink it, he took it off of the bill with out us even asking him to do it."}
{"text":"Wandered into Number One Pho on a Monday afternoon after finding out that Superior Pho was closed on Mondays (bummer!) and decided to finally give it a shot. Let the battle of the pho restaurants begin!  Sure, the location and ambience of Number One Pho is better than my go-to pho restaurant, Superior Pho. But when it comes to casual ethnic restaurants, I'm all about the authenticity, quality, and taste of the food. We ordered the crispy spring rolls and phos. The crispy spring rolls were alright, but pricey (2 for $5). Nothing to rave about, but nothing to complain about either. Upon tasting the broth of my pho tai (with rare beef), I felt that something about the seasoning was off. The broth tasted bland and had a much sweeter taste than what I typically expect from pho. It also seemed like the broth was not filtered enough as there were tons of mini floating pieces of fat from the beef bones. I had no problems with the consistency of the noodles, but the rare beef was not thinly sliced and was very leathery and hard to chew. I could not take another bite of the beef afterwards. I usually take my leftover pho broth home to make noodle soup with later, but the taste of the broth was so off-putting that I didn't.   I will definitely be sticking to Superior Pho for pho (and bahn mi, which Number One Pho didn't seem to have), as long as my memory can serve me correctly that they're not open on Mondays."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, spacious, perfect lighting... And the food is full of flavor, inique, and sizeable portions. I plan to visit at least once a month with an eye towards the chicken and cabbage slaw with the most delicious dressing. Great place to bring children with quick and precise service."}
{"text":"Beware, this is not Superior Pho, your GPS may lead you this one. All young waiters seem rude and don't care the customers. Food has less meat, comparing to the other places."}
{"text":"Decent pho - but if you want better, simply go next door to Superior Pho - easy peasy, vietnamaneesy."}
{"text":"Wish they can be more attentive   Soup was okay I ordered pho with rare stake   Wish they use bigger bowl than what they have now And also hotter than what they are serving now  Waiter was busy with his ipad which is not acceptable   Will give a shot next time will update"}
{"text":"I really can't say enough good things about #1 Pho. Although the location isn't necessarily my favorite, the food is to die for! I always get the V4 with a vegetable base and have never been disappointed! This quickly became our go-to place. It's never completely packed and the wait staff is always friendly ! Best pho in Cleveland by far."}
{"text":"Went to # pho for lunch today. It wasn't very good I had the pho the broth doesn't have any taste. My wife order crepes and it is bad also.  The server are busy texting on their phone never take any dirty dishes from our table!"}
{"text":"just had lunch with friends at No. 1 Pho, and we all enjoyed our meals. Haven't tried Superior Pho, and probably will in the future, but we thought No. 1 Pho was just fine, actually very good.   I had the spring rolls with hoison peanut sauce as an appetizer, which were fresh, light, and delicious. Then I had the shrimp with vermicelli, sprouts and fresh veggies and thought it was very tasty.  Our friends ordered the fried squid for an appetizer, which tried and thought it was very good, and beef pho for main course. My wife also ordered the beef pho and all 3 bowls came out hot, could see the steam coming off them. The sides of Chinese basil, sprouts, lime and hot green peppers were fresh and very good when added to the pho. Also served with 2 sauces on the side.   We've never had pho before, but have tasted a variety of broth-based soups from all kinds of cultures, and we thought it was very delicious, not like some of the other reviews on here, i.e. too bland, or too greasy or too cold (don't forget to add the basil, sprouts, lime, and green peppers to the Pho!).   I understand food can vary a bit depending on who's working the kitchen, just like service can vary depending on the waiter or waitress you get and what kind of a day they're having, but maybe we got lucky today, because our food looked and tasted fresh, just-prepared, and very flavorful. Maybe if there was someone else cooking today, it could have been a different story.   If anything, the prices were a little high, but not outrageous, and i thought the portions were decent for the price. We will definitely be back at No. 1 Pho, but we will also try Superior Pho to see what all the fuss is about!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight and it'll be my last time.   I remember what a great restaurant it use to be when I moved to Cleveland 10 years ago.  The pho is good but the service has declined year over year.  No one checked in on us during dinner tonight.  They handed us the bill before I finished dinner.   It's not like they needed to turn the tables over because only 2 other parties were there!  I guess I'll take my business to the other Vietnamese restaurants that are within a one block radius from them."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch today. It took a server 25 minutes to even recognize I was there. One seeded I told my server what I wanted. 20 minutes later she brought out the wrong lunch. I had explained to her that was the wrong lunch and took additional 20 minutes to get my proper lunch. As I was ringing out I had explained to the manager what happened.  He got very defensive. To top it all off... They gave me some others leftovers.."}
{"text":"I second Cynthia C. I live in San Francisco, and I love me some pho.   #1's pho with beef and brisket is at least as good as that of my favorite pho place in SF; however, #1 looks like a real restaurant; my pho place in SF looks like a lunch counter.  A great spot for cold-weather lunches."}
{"text":"I liked the pho here, but it's not my favorite in Cleveland.  The flavor is good, but there are less onions than I like, and less meat than comes in a bowl at Superior pho.  The appetizer pork spring rolls were good.  Service was a little slow.  This was an ok meal, ok time, just not anything spectacular."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! My friend and I are regulars and they always welcome us and have our orders memorized. I also frequently get their carry out and it's usually ready within minutes.   I usually get their wonton(H4) soup or the pho (p2) and both are excellent! I am excited to try more things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Don't know what the complaints are about, but I'll offer this....  Disclaimer 1:   I didn't have the Pho.    I did have the shrimp with vermicelli noodles which was absolutely delightful.  The shrimp were perfectly grilled and seasoned and the bowl came with ample veggies and fish sauce which was not overly fishy.  The spring rolls (sans pork) were also wonderful.  I'll be back with an update.  Disclaimer 2:  I'm not from CA nor am I Vietnamese.  Disclaimer 3:   Once,  I did eat solely Vietnamese food for 7 days in CA."}
{"text":"I had already visited this restaurant several times. To be honest we feel the service is not good and the broth is sloppy, better in Min-ah. But this restaurant has a comfortable atmosphere and relatively close to my home. That's why again visited there in late June. As usual no service, sloppy soup.  And, I don't know why, gratuity they collected didn't match our record. (We noticed that later when reviewing the card record and receipt.)"}
{"text":"I used to work down the street from this restaurant, so it was a monthly frequent. The food here is fine, some of it even good, but it's often eclipsed by the service. It usually takes forever for us to be acknowledged once we've been seated, and it takes forever to get your check taken care of, but the food comes out in two minutes. I especially like the Bun Cha Gio. The fresh rolls/summer rolls are average, and half the time they don't have whatever bubble tea flavor I order; it doesn't matter which flavor since I like to mix it up each time.  Parking lot across the side street, a plus."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for pho. The service is fast and the people who work there are very nice. I've never had a bad experience there and a couple of my friends are regulars."}
{"text":"Came here and tried the everything Pho. It wasn't bad, but neither was it remarkable. If you want the best Cleveland has to offer, I would recommend Superior Pho located across the street. Much tastier and slightly cheaper than Number One Pho."}
{"text":"Really delicious!!!  They don't use MSG which is a HUGE thumbs up.  (The other Vietnamese down the street, Superior Pho, DOES use MSG).  Atmosphere is okay.  Go there for a yummy, healthy meal - but not for an awesome ambiance.  It's not BAD, it's just not a Saturday night out!  I got the the cabbage chicken salad (I think it's called) without chicken and without fish sauce and it was AMAZING!  I also got the vegetable soup and thought it was really great.  My husband got the lemon grass chicken dish and loved it.  The man (owner?) isn't the friendliest, but maybe a cultural thing (my daughter was annoyed by that....).  Anyway, GREAT meal!!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice recently. The first time with friends, I thought it was great. I love Vietnamese food and was excited about the meal. Also, with friends, it's easy to get distracted by the company and not evaluate the food and atmosphere as critically as one might when alone.  So the first time, I would say four stars even if I didn't really like the broken rice dish. The pho was lovely as was the chicken cabbage salad.  Last week, I went back with my daughter and nanny. We sat by the heat register on the floor - it was filthy dirty. So I began to cast a critical eye around the place. Lackluster service. Bubble drink - not so good.  Chicken cabbage salad -  servicable. Cha Gio spring rolls - pretty good. Vermicelli noodle dish - again edible and even good but not memorable.   I think next time I'll try the place down the street."}
{"text":"This restaurant has received many mixed reviews but I like it here! The food is good and the prices are awesome! A whole meal under $9 that includes 3 types of meat? SOLD!  My waiter was polite and quick and my food was delicious! I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I ate lunch here the other day and was was pleasantly surprised. I'll be honest - after seeing the 3 star rating on Yelp, I was hesitant to give this place a shot. There are so many great places to devour delicious Pho in this area. I went on Monday to Superior Pho - my usual go to spot, and discovered they were closed on Mondays. I then walked over to Saigon Grille, where I have also had amazing Pho - they were going through some sort of issues where the restaurant was closed for one month. With my two first options out the window - I had no choice but to give #1 Pho a shot. I was definitely happy the ways things turned out.   I walked into a decent sized restaurant with nice decor and was seated immediately. I went with a large beef brisket pho. The food for myself and three friends came out immediately - and it was delicious! The brisket was very tender and the broth was amazing. I threw a little soy sauce and sriciha in the broth to spice it up and ended up slurping up every bit of the gigantic bowl. #1 Pho definitely lives up to it's name and I will be visiting again."}
{"text":"I've passed this place so many times and never stopped in and I'm so glad I did!   Parking could be better, but it's not impossible to find a spot. The servers were very friendly. I immediately noticed that the place was packed for the time that I went (this was after the lunch hour). The pho was excellent! The prices aren't bad either. Definitely will be back again."}
{"text":"This is my favorite date spot in Cleveland. I like the french flair to the dining room. I am not Vietnamese, nor have I ever lived in Cali. So, I am relying on my taste buds (they are quite experienced in general). I love the pho! People need to lighten up! The food is a great bargain and if someone isn't very experienced with international cuisine, this place is very accessible to newbies and will blow them away. It is very theatrical to watch the server bring the HUGE bowl of pho with the the basil and peppers. It is very fun to eat the first time.   If you have not been there before, don't try to order a large bowl of pho. It would probably kill you to try to finish the entire bowl; it is so good, you would try to finish it too."}
{"text":"I have left my former positive review below because this was my favorite Vietnamese food in Cleveland. The last time we went there my wife got sick from the food. We went on a Sunday a couple weeks ago and the shrimp and pork didn't taste right on my vermicelli dish. They seemed like they had been cooked a couple hours before and were not even heated back up, left at room temperature. I didn't say anything. I ate about a third of it and stopped- normally finishing it and wanting more was not a problem. My wife, who hates to waste food, ate the rest. She had no other food anywhere we ate but dry beans that she cooked at home. She was violently ill for the next 48 hours, starting 5-6 hours after this meal. I don't think I can go back even though they have great flavor in their food. At least I won't get sick at Minh Anh or Superior.  Old review: Better Pho than next door IMO. The broth is way tastier. The bunn with grilled pork and shrimp is fantastic! The sauce they have for it is so good! The bubble tea is great. The shrimp and pork spring rolls are fresh and tasty. My wife and I have been coming almost every weekend. I am not sure why people think Superior is better except it is a little cheaper."}
{"text":"If I wrote a review for Number One Pho a year ago, I would be giving it a 2 star review. But I was back at this Vietnamese restaurant because I didn't make it in time to get to Superior Pho (my favourite vietnamese place in Cleveland), and honestly, I was pleasantly surprised!  The service I received was prompt and courteous. The server inquired about our food and seemed genuinely interested as to whether we appreciated the food or not. The food was bought out quickly and piping hot.   For the food, we ordered the fried tofu as starters, and the seafood soup and curry tofu as main courses.  The fried tofu ($5) was a delectable soft tofu with a light crispy tempura batter that set it off perfectly. Coupled with the ginger sauce, and it was a really tasty beginning.  The fish soup was a good sized bowl of pho - you could just about finish it if you were ravenous (which we were) and was really tasty. Had meatballs consisting of crab and shrimp... yum  And the curried tofu was served on a bed of piping hot delicate vermicelli noodles that tasted, well, good!   Definitely would go back again (more for the main food than the pho - Superior is still my favourite for that....)"}
{"text":"In my continuing quest to once and for all find the cure for the common cold, here is yet another review of a pho restaurant in Cleveland.  Number One Pho hit all the marks of a good pho restaurant for me, and their menu also includes some other favorite Vietnamese entrees, like clay pot fish, which I love and will go back for.  On street parking was pretty ample on a Wednesday afternoon, on Superior right in front of the restaurant. it was well after lunch rush, around 2:30 and we were greeted and seated promptly. There is ample seating in a nice but not upscale dining room. We ordered drinks and a fried tofu appetizer. They came our quickly, the fried tofu was hot and crispy and a dipping sauce based in fish sauce was sweet and tangy, really good. There were cucumber and carrots with a slight pickle on them that were also good, very fresh and refreshing. The pho was very good also; the broth is always the star. This particular broth was good;not overly rich but importantly not overseasoned and not salty. Sometimes pho broth is overpowered with aromatics but this broth was more honest in the natural flavors. The meat and tripe was very good, the noodles plentiful and with basil, sprouts, peppers and lime the bowl was very good. The service was outstanding, though very attentive but not overbearing. We got the Tofu ($5), two big bowls of pho ($9 each) and one drink ($2) so lunch was $25 for two."}
{"text":"First few times, we drove by, I wasn't sure it was open.  The neighborhood is deserted and I couldn't see through the dark (dirty?) windows.  So we had lunch here and it was good, not spectacular.  No complaints about service or food, just don't know what the big bruhaha is about.   I guess I don't like eating in a deserted. sketchy  neighborhood.  Definitely no curb appeal, grass in front of restaurant overgrown, weedy and unkempt."}
{"text":"Not much to see here.  You would be much better off going around the corner to Superior Pho.  #1 Pho has a cook, Superior Pho has a chef; that's how stark the difference is in food, its presentation and preparation is between the two restaurants.  I will say that #1 Pho does have a better variety of traditional beverages, including a vegetable leaf drink that I thought was interesting."}
{"text":"We accidentally came in here thinking it was Superior Pho. I just thought the \"#1 Pho\" sign was to indicate that they were voted the #1 Pho place in the city. I only figured out that I was in the wrong restaurant after we had ordered. I logged onto my Yelp account to check in, and I noticed there were two pho places on the same street. Tricky, tricky!!~  Anyway, I am always down to try a new pho place. The broth was good, the noodles were cooked well (not too overcooked, not too chewy), and the meat was actually pretty decent. Sometimes, the meat is \"shiny\" like the scales of a fish. That usually makes me feel a little icky inside what it's like that, but it's not like that here. It was pretty tender and not too chewy or fatty. Overall, it's a legit bowl of pho and I would probably go here instead of Superior if I had to choose again. But I don't live in Cleveland, so I probably wouldn't have to make that kind of decision. But for those of you reading, I hope it's helpful."}
{"text":"Ate out there with a group of friends, the soup here is good. This was my first introduction to a vietnamese resturant in Ohio."}
{"text":"I'm giving #1 Pho 3 stars because the staff is so friendly. Other then that the food was below average. I love pho.....i mean I really LOVE pho. It's the absolute best thing on a cold winter day. I ended up at #1 Pho because my usually spot was closed on Mondays. I ordered the Vietnamese Beef Stew. It was nothing but salt. I believe they use a broth mix and I think mine ended up with to much mix in it. It also did not come with noodles as I expected. The waitress brought me a bowl of noodles when I asked and that helped a little bit with the saltiness. But I ended up not finishing it. They took 10% of my bill without my asking which was nice. But save your sodium intake for a month and go to Superior Pho which is around the corner. The make thier broth from scratch and it is delicious."}
{"text":"Number One Pho is our favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Cleveland, we have tried several different restaurants but continually come back to here. The Pho's (soups) are fantastic and very authentic, my wife and I however enjoy several appetizers they have on offer. The Salt Baked Squid is a must try, even if your just going in for Pho you won't be disappointed with the squid is is very awesome (but you must need to like garlic), the Crispy Shrimp is normally cooked to perfection but needs to be eaten on arrival which is very hot. The Shrimp and Pork Cabbage Salad is probably our overall favorite to the Squid, it is fresh and it seems you just can't get enough of it. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I usually frequent Superior Pho, another Pho place around the corner, but I wanted something unusual and ventured into the restaurant. The atmosphere was nicely decorated, and the restaurant owner was personable. We got a vermicelli bowl and a pho soup, and the service for both was really fast. The pho was not nearly as good as that of Superior Pho, but the vermicelli bowl was really nice. There was just enough tang in the sauce that lifted the flavor of the entire dish, but kept the freshness of the vegetables and the fried spring roll. It was a slow Tuesday afternoon for the restaurant and I was in a bad mood, but the restaurant owner was respectful, but did not over-compensate. The decor was a bit old and dusty, but nice."}
{"text":"# 1 pho is not #1 pho at all......pho was too sweet in opinion. Vermecili was actually not bad but shrimps on there taste rotten.  This place is not clean from its appearance, menu was greasy n dirty, same thing with utensil n cups. Lost my appetite before the food being served."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. My wife and I have been coming for years and we always leave satisfied. The service staff is wonderful and always remembers our orders. We love A8 spring rolls!! I always get the rare beef and meatball pho while my wife enjoys the pho chicken. This is a great stop for a rainy day or just to enjoy some delicious pho."}
{"text":"The name of this restaurant is not very fitting.  The #1 Vietnamese restaurant is actually right across the street from this place.  With that being said...why would anyone come here?  With that aside, this place is just okay.  The pho portion is smaller than Superior's.  Things are more expensive. Broth doesn't taste as good...meats don't taste as good...Rice dishes are nothing special.  .But if Superior pho ever shut down for some odd reason, I guess most of those customers will end up coming here."}
{"text":"Every now and then I get a urge for pho that just wont go away, so a friend suggested this place and I thought I would give it a go. It is a very clean place and the style is modern clam and visually pleasing, the spring rolls were very good and alas the pho was amazing! I would say they totally craved my craving and I would recommend this place to any one. The wait staff was ok and the only thing I would change would be the cut of beef but other than that it was amazing 3 stars!"}
{"text":"Never again. I should've known better when my to go order came out within 2 minutes. The shrimp tasted like it was fried three days ago and then warmed up in the microwave. Dry, old noodles. I basically threw my money down the toilet because this dinner was tossed in the trash after literally three bites. Superior Pho has no competition.  Just..don't."}
{"text":"Love this place. Best pho in town! Their salt backed squid is very tasty. Very nice service."}
{"text":"This being my first experience with pho in Cleveland, I wasn't quite sure what to expect, having come from the Asian-saturated cities of LA and Orange County.    The host was quite polite and checked on us a couple times during our meal.  The decor was decent, although the floor was suspiciously wet under our table.  Upon seeing the listings in the menu, the boy commented that perhaps the high prices help to cover the cost of printing the menu, which was a thick leather-bound volume.  I had consulted the Asiatown website before we came, and the prices in the menu were considerably higher than the ones listed there; currently the going rate for a bowl of pho is $8-9 --as much as the priciest bowl I've ever had in Irvine.    The pho itself was passable.  Cilantro was added to the broth instead of served on the side with the sprouts and basil, which added a tang that I would have preferred been left out.  The portion of beef was sizable, and had a robust flavor which more thinly sliced meat usually fails to convey.  The boy nearly passed out coughing after trying a bit of the hot sauce which accompanied the pho.  Overall, this wasn't a bad experience, but for the price, I would have expected something better."}
{"text":"Not gonna lie.  I ended up going to the wrong place.  I was looking for the one down the street, but by the time I realized my mistake I was already being seated.  At this point I just resigned myself to the experience that lay ahead.  I ordered an app (A6) and was very pleased with the spring roll presented.  The contents were very fresh tasting, and the peanut sauce provided on the side was divine.  The two rolls were tasty and filling.  I also ordered the standard pho, and while the broth had a very mild and delightful taste that  I enjoyed the downside was the meat looked suspicious.  This was the first time I've eaten pho where the thin slices of rare beef looked almost like it was from a Steak-Umm package.  Everything was as it should have been.  The basil and bean sprouts offered up on the side were very fresh, and brought a wonderful springtime taste to the soup.    All in all it wasn't a waste of my time, and I would definately go again if I was looking for a classier dining experience with some friends instead of a quick \"grab & smash\" dining experience like I thought I was getting into."}
{"text":"I was introduced to this charming lunch spot by my niece who attends Cleveland State University, since it's located just a few blocks off campus. I no longer live in Ohio, but when I'm in town this is our traditional spot to meet, talk & enjoy some warm & tasty Pho.  We usually start with egg rolls-she gets the fried.  I enjoy the fresh shrimp & pork & the yummy dipping sauce that accompanied them. Then, being creatures of habit, we both usually order the traditional rare beef pho & it is consistently delicious. The service is kind of hit & miss - not an uncommon tendency in ethnic restaurants, but nothing that bad that I'd not return...quite the contrary we've been back time & time again & will be in the future!"}
{"text":"Number One Pho is my number three pho. When Superior Pho and Saigon Grille are closed, I go here simply because it's in the same area and I'm already there. The prices are about the same if not slightly higher than the other two restaurants.  Let's start with the pho. The broth is a lot saltier and tastes more MSG-y than the other two places. Also, this place doesn't have bottles of sriracha or hoisin sauce readily available at the table. Instead, they provide little bowls with both in them. There is also no basil in the side dish of veggies that come with the pho. Overall, the pho is so-so. I've also tried the crispy pork egg roll vermicelli. The one here is a lot smaller in portion than the one I've had at Saigon Grille. The egg rolls were also really salty. I don't recommend getting this!   Let's talk about the service. I came here on a weekday for lunch and my party and I were the only ones in the restaurant. However, the service was still really slow for some reason.   I probably won't be coming back again!"}
{"text":"Feasted for a great price! The Pho was flavorful and the toppings/ Garnish was yummy and fresh. The Boba was outstanding and I was seated when I entered the restaurant."}
{"text":"Tuesday's lunch brought us to #1 Pho.  We were actually attempting to go to Superior Pho, but couldn't find it (we have now found the entrance, too late), so we went to #1.  We had heard it was the lesser Pho.  Well, I've never had it's rival, but Superior must be REALLY great to be all that much better than #1.  First, I ordered a coffee bubble tea.  Oh how I love bubble tea!  It was wonderful, with lots of tapioca bubbles.  As an appetizer, we got the Vietnamese Crispy Crepe (forgive me using the American names, as I can't figure out how to type the characters needed for actual Vietnamese).  This thing was huge and really good.  It was stuffed with veggies, shrimp, and pork and came with a great sauce for dipping.  We also got Crispy Spring Rolls, which were honestly the best spring rolls I have ever had.  For our main courses, we each got a different Pho.  Jason got the P2 (noodles, rare beef and brisket) and I got the slightly more adventurous P5 (which includes all forms of beef, including tripe.)  As with any proper Pho, our bowls of noodles were giant and on the side was a plate filled with bean sprouts, fresh basil, and lime, along with the super hot sauce and hoisen to add at our leisure.  I loved this Pho as much as I have loved Pho in the past at Minh Ahn"}
{"text":"This place definitely deserve more than 3 stars. We started with the shrimp and pork rolls. They were large and very good. The peanut dipping sauce was very good, too. My wife got the chicken pho and I got the rare breed and tripe. Both were very good. The broth was tasty and full of umami. The Vietnamese coffee was great, too. The service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"I'll beat it into your head again, like everyone else does. #1 isn't Superior. Superior is far superior. Blah blah blah. Go next door, err around the corner, errr whatever. Superior is closed Mondays blah. Blah blah NO SRIRACHA on the table BLAH.   Key differences between the two: - swankier atmosphere at #1 - a bigger space at #1 - no b√°nh m√¨ at #1  The service at #1 was pretty good though.  Here's an example of why. My kid, who is 3, had a funny / embarrassing convo (for me) with the server. Server: \"What kind of soup would you like, little guy? Chicken soup? Beef soup? Vegetable soup?\" Kid: \"What about cat soup?\" .......(nervous giggling from adults at the table)....... Server:  \"LOLZ!  Sure, yes, of course we have cat!\"  In short, our food was decent. Service was just fine. Bubble tea still creeps me out."}
{"text":"Number One Pho on Superior Avenue is so superior to Superior Pho on Superior Avenue that they should consider asking Superior Pho to change their name."}
{"text":"There are few things in life that I totally crave- that I dream about... However, the chicken pho from #1 Pho is one of those items. :)  In my opinion, good pho is all about the broth-the long cooked bone broth, balanced and subtle flavors... This place nails it! It's the best pho place in Cleveland. Hands down.   You can probably tell that I'm always ordering pho, but my boyfriend has ordered everything from the seafood soup to the fried noodle dishes, and he has enjoyed them all.  It's a great spot for a quick lunch or dinner. The food comes out of the kitchen in just a few minutes after ordering."}
{"text":"Have not been here in years ... But Ty Fun had a black out so Seth said let's go to Number One ... Excellent choice ... Had the charbroiled pork roll for an app ... Very tasty and the pork was cooked very well and sauce complimented nicely.  So much so that I had the pork vermicelli ... Plenty of meat and veggies with crunchy peanuts had great texture and flavor profile.  Would eat it again very soon.  Prices were inexpensive, service very good and it is one of the nicer looking Vietnamese restaurants in town.  The lemonade was little too sweet for my taste .. But added some water and loved it.  I know this place gets rated low on the Pho, but the rest of the menu is tasty and a real value.  Little out of the way but worth the trip."}
{"text":"Didn't have a good experience. My husband and I have had stomach issues for two days! My beef stew was fatty and his bbq vermicelli special was luke warm. This restaurant has gone down hill.  We'll be looking for another Vietnamese restaurant in the future."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Vietnamese place! The  Pho is awesome, but the many other dishes that they offer are insanely delish!  Every time we go, my adventurous husband orders some crazy dinner from the back of the menu. Every one has been rich, spicy, and unbelievably tasty! If I had my way, I would never eat in another Asian restaurant! The service is always \"spot on\" and the food is my personal favorite!"}
{"text":"This place should be renamed #2 Pho - it's good but it's not the best. Superior Pho across the street is not only on Superior, it is superior. Back to this place. The 4 of us had a delightful lunch - 3 phos for them and a vermicelli for me. All were very good. I preferred mine because it is very similar to the pho, but without all the broth. Clearly a question of taste. The ambiance was noisy, hustling, bustling (partly, I think, because it was a Monday and Superior Pho was closed). Our service was poor. The waitress, though competent, was overworked & stressed out & we rarely saw her."}
{"text":"# 1  P U C K  P H O! 1/4 the food. Fake accents and they really don't give a #puck now whatsoever. They hung up on me twice... 'No understand' and I've gone there for over 6 years. \"No English?\"... If you saw the slop pix of the 1/4 sided portions you REALLY BOYCOTT. New management or just lazy ass staff is a joke smoking on the patio rather than working. Now no liquor license. No bubble tea. No service . Unless you're  Asian it's a 45  min wait.   Returning this clown chow tomorrow. Not expecting ANYTHING but my $30 back."}
{"text":"Not THE worst pho I've tried but compare with Superior Pho, this place is: 1) overpriced 2) noodles are harder texture like √≠t's not completely cooked 3) broth is watery (C''mon the main taste of pho is coming from the broth, if you can't do the broth right, what else is there?)  I rarely go to this place anymore unless it's on a Monday (Superior Pho is closed on mondays) and I am craving for pho badly."}
{"text":"There is a restroom smell in certain area of the restaurant. I'm not sure if the entire place smells like this but the left hand side area after getting into the door has a disgusting smell. I cannot believe everyone sitting there are pretending knowing nothing. The restaurant is obviously short of staff. I only saw 2 waiters running in and out through the entire place. Will never be there again."}
{"text":"I ordered the Bun Bo Hue and it was delicious. The fried rice dish that I ordered was some of the best I've ever had. I don't recall the name of the rice dish but it had shrimp, chicken, and Vietnamese sausage. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Having first experienced Superior Pho in Cleveland, Number One Pho had a lot to live up to....unfortunately, it did not.  I have to say that the interior of the joint is definitely classier than Superior Pho's hole-in-the-wall feeling, so we were pretty excited to sit down and tuck in to a couple of bowls of Pho.  That was, until we got seated in the \"non-Asian\" section.  I don't know if this has happened to anyone else here, but we got the distinct impression that they seated people based on their ethnicity.  There are two main dining areas at Number One Pho and one had 3 Asian families in it and the other was filled with Caucasian and African-American couples and families....it was very off-putting indeed.  One thing distinctly missing from the table was Sriracha....minus one star just for that.  Started off with some kind of crepe appetizer....do not be tempted to order this.  I was assuming light and fluffy and small (as in \"appetizer\") with a French influence, boy was I wrong.  This thing came out covering a huge plate and it was greasy....the two of us couldn't even finish half of it and we definitely didn't want to take it home.  Pho was nothing special, in fact, a little bland even though I got one of the ones listed on the menu as \"spicy\".  Brisket was also a little on the tough side.  Pluses:  the coffee and condensed milk was great and service was prompt.  Sorry \"Number One\" Pho....you've got nothing on Superior Pho.  And even if I'm really in the mood for Pho on Monday, I think I'll wait a day until the little hole-in-the-wall where the Pho is full of flavor and obviously made with love by some tiny Vietnamese granny in the back kitchen is open."}
{"text":"Food: 5/5 Environment: 4.5/5 Mood: 4/5 Service: 4/5  Verdict: One of my favorite places to eat in Cleveland. People prefer other restaurants but I'll always stand by No. 1 Pho  Environment: I absolutely love this place. Other people tell me they like Superior Pho or Wonton Gourmet more but nah, I'm always all about the #1 Pho. It's a spacious dining area and they try to seat you where you have space AKA not next to another table when the whole restaurant is open. The decor is pleasant and street parking is always available. The bathrooms are singles.  Mood:  The decor really establishes the mood for the place. It feels authentic but not so much in your face about it. Comes across as classy-cultural even if i arrive in casual dress.  Food:  Where do I even start.... I always get the salt and pepper seafood or calamari. The taste in it is so simple and yet savory. Most times i order two and then a soup. Besides their pho being freshly made, their bun bo hue and mi bo kho are my favorites. Sometimes it's a little salty but I like adding a lil jalapeno and it cancels out for the most part.   Service: So most times when I go, there's usually one server who takes care of the whole restaurant. They're pretty good at it too but sometimes it can take a lil bit for them to come around.  Also, last trip, there was a piece of plastic in my soup. One mistake out of the 10 times I've gone was forgivable to me though. I'll always come back."}
{"text":"I went to Number One Pho with a group of friends on a weekday night, and had fairly high expectations given the number of great reviews I had heard from friends. We had great, attentive service given that the place was empty except for our group and they even stayed open for about 30 mins later to give our group time to finish. I ordered the curry chicken, which came out quickly and was quite flavorful. Although it's unfair to compare this place to the number of Chinese restaurants in this area, personally I prefer the taste of some of the other establishments nearby. Overall, I would recommend this restaurant to anyone seeking out a good Vietnamese curry in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"i can only judge this place for 2 of it's dishes. 1. fried tofu - delicious. fried battered silk tofu. the texture is perfect. crispy then silky. the dipping sauce is good as well. 2. vegetable soup. so basically i ask them to make this into a veggie pho for me. add some rice noodles, some tofu, and the usual sprouts and spicy plus hoisin sauce. there's my veggie pho! although the broth is not super flavorful, it is a clear vegetarian no chicken stock broth. while this cannot compare to vegetarian pho in other cities, this may be the best i'm getting in cleveland unless i make it myself.  also, the waiters never write anything down, despite my somewhat complicated order and my uncertainty as to their mastery of the english language. i always wait almost fearfully for my order to arrive and expect it to be beef pho with all of the onions and scallions in the kitchen but somehow each time my order is right. i will continue to wait apprehensively but i am assured that they are quite good waiters in fact, even if their customer service is not amazing."}
{"text":"So I've been to this place twice now. The first time was about a year ago and I wasn't all that impressed. I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt and tried them a second time. My recent visit did nothing to change my mind. I ordered Pho on both visits.  I can't remember details of my visit from a year ago, except that I thought it was overpriced and I've had better. I had the exact same sentiments during my recent visit, but add the fact that my Pho was cold, the server did not speak English and when I had questions about some items on the menu she could not answer them, and she never came back to check on us after our Pho was delivered. I had to flag another server down to refill our drinks and get our check.  As for my two-star rating: not that I'm a professional critic, but on a 5-star system, I typically start with all stars present then I deduct depending on my experience. You can't give \"0\" stars, so 1 star is the lowest you can go, which means that I would deduct for negative experiences on the following qualities:  AMBIANCE - the place is nice. They can keep this star. PRICE - overpriced. Star deducted. QUALITY - Pho was cold. I've had much better. Star deducted. SERVICE - Poor service, poor communication. Star deducted.  They say you can usually tell how good a restaurant is by the type of clientel they have. Being a restaurant specializing in Asian cuisine, I'd like to think that they should have pretty regular Asian customers. On the contrary, every single person dining there at the time I went was of Caucasian descent. Not to say that's a bad thing, but it just makes you wonder."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great bubble tea, friendly service. More importantly, ALWAYS consistent! Kudos!"}
{"text":"Accidentally stepped in to this place when I was looking for another Vietnamese restaurant in the area.  Their Pho is very good and I also tried their Pork Vermicelli.  Both were very good as were the portion size. Service was good as well."}
{"text":"It was by chance that I ended up here. I'm a big fan of Superior Pho, but the day I went to this part of town, Superior was closed so I decided to try Number One.   Number One Pho wins when it comes to ambiance and curbside appeal.  Service was fine as well.   As for the food, I kept it simple and tried the summer roll and Pho Ga (chicken).  No complaints on my end.  Despite the broth's light color, I found the broth to be quite flavorful.  The bean sprouts and basil were fresh.  The summer roll was good as well.  The prices are a little bit more than Superior Pho.  I think my meal came to about $13 + tip.  I guess I paid a little extra for the ambiance.  Both restaurants have their selling points.  The ambiance of Number One Pho is nicer and newer.  The food is good and its probably $2-3 more for your meal.   Superior Pho has that \"hole-in-the-wall / Mom and Pops\" feel with excellent food for a little bit cheaper.  Parking at Superior Pho is also a little bit easier.  I don't think that you could make a mistake either way."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed the wonderfully flavorful, piping hot, and infinitely customizable dish that is Pho Ga at multiple restaurants around Cleveland. However, Number One Pho (aptly named) holds the top honor in my heart. Number One Pho's spacious and clean layout, friendly staff, and convenient location make for the perfect casual date night/girls lunch/etc...  The Pho Ga (Chicken Pho) is fresh, flavorful, and extremely addictive. The rich broth, savory chicken, delectable rice noodles, and side dish of add-ins (bean sprouts, Thai basil, sauces, and jalapenos...) make Number One Pho's Pho Ga an A+ dish.  In my humble opinion, Number One easily trumps nearby competitor, Superior Pho. If you are looking for fresh and flavorful Vietnamese cuisine, make your way to Number One Pho!"}
{"text":"I'll get to the point.  We were not offered any hot tea after we were seated.  Number One Pho's broth lacks in complexity and umami. The other components, noodles, brisket and tripe were not very good in quality and texture.  We were not provided with basil leaves to garnish our Pho. We did get bean sprouts and jalape√±os however.  The Banh Xeo we ordered came with two leaves of lettuce only, no mint or basil leaves.  The banh xeo was very oily, the texture was not the usual airy & flaky, rather this was flat.  If you come here I would stay clear from their pho and banh xeo.  I've had Vietnamese food in Hanoi, Vietnam and up and down California. It is very common in CA.  Don't let Number One Pho's take on Pho be your only impression. There is better. Much better."}
{"text":"I've never had Vietnamese food before but I just went here last night and I thought it was fabulous! Portions were huge but there was only $1 difference between the small and large pho. Couldn't resist"}
{"text":"I didn't realize that Superior Pho and L J Shanghai are both closed on Monday, so my wife and I decided to try Number One Pho in between them. Started out with the Goi Cuon (summer rolls).  They were very good, containing both shrimp and pork, with an excellent dipping sauce.  I had the Pho Tai Nam (beef and brisket pho) and my wife had the Pho Ga (chicken pho).  The beef in my dish was cut into chunks instead of thin sliced, but it was tender and flavorful.  We both agreed that the broth wasn't as richly flavored as Superior Pho but that it was serviceable.  Service was pretty much par for the course for an Asiatown restaurant."}
{"text":"Number One Pho deserves more than the 3 star rating that it currently has. The food is really good. Compared to other Vietnamese places in Cleveland, it's one of my favorites. I ordered pho, of course, but their menu is quite extensive. The fresh bean sprouts and basil served with the pho were plentiful and clean.   One of my dining partners had the chicken and cabbage salad and she really enjoyed it. It was a very generously sized portion. Another had a peppery chicken dish that looked really good (didn't get to try it). We also shared a few orders of spring rolls. Now those i didn't care for. Probably would skip the appetizer next time.   Parking could be an issue but we were able to find a spot on the road. It wasn't busy when we stopped in. Everyone was nice and the service was pretty fast."}
{"text":"I have been here twice. The first time I order bo kho with a baguette. The bread was good, but the stew didn't have much flavor.  The second time was over the summer. I needed to give this place another try. I think I have bad luck, because the power was out that day and all they had was pho. No biggie, I ordered a pho and coconut drink (one of the few drinks that was currently available). It was much better than my first visit, but lacked that special something. I really want to give them another shot, but it's hard to pass up the other Vietnamese places nearby."}
{"text":"I do not agree with the other reviewers who gave 5 stars.  I do not think this is the best Pho in town, nor do I think it is anywhere near close.  I think this restaurant survives mainly due to its prominent, visible location, and due to the nice, classy atmosphere inside.  The menu is larger than at some places in town, and there are some vegetarian options (although they are not particularly good or interesting), but the food is somewhat bland, and is priced too high to justify what you get.  The Pho is perfectly edible but it is nothing to write home about.  The atmosphere is very nice, and is more upscale than any of the other Vietnamese places in town.  Service is good.  I think you're paying for the atmosphere and the location, and not the food."}
{"text":"Don't get fooled by the Superior Pho, it is not the same as #1 Pho. Serious, they are one block apart so be careful. The difference is quite noticeable. The food here is truly #1 and out of control!!!  The Pho is flavorful, the vermicelli is top of the line. This is a true find in the Cleveland area. I've been here many times and each time the Pho is filling but not overwhelming.  Getting the winter blues? then the Pho will light your fire. Having the summer heat waves, then the veggie spring rolls will quench your vibe.  Sit by the window and wonder why you hadn't come here before or if it is simply coincidence that the superior Pho is right across the street. Hmmm..."}
{"text":"We came for a late lunch today and I would rather have had cup a noodle. We were seated immediately but then waited about 15 minutes before anybody greeted us at our table. If they were busy I could have understood but there was only 2 other people in the restaurant. Once the server arrived with water we were notified that they lost their liquor license. Oh well hot on cold day will work. We ordered a few appetizers to start and they were not good. The egg rolls were cold and tasted like they were made yesterday and crispy tofu was grossly under cooked and not crispy. I returned the egg rolls and they brought me back another order in 10 seconds. Can you say not fresh!  If McDonalds made egg rolls, they would taste better than these.   Next was the Pho which was okay. One order had a lot of beef and the other had very little.  The broth was good but the meat is supposed to be served rare and you could tell it had been extremely over cooked. Check please!  I will not be going back. If you are looking for good Pho go to Bowl of Pho in Beachwood."}
{"text":"Basically, I liked it. A lot.  Sure, there's better food out there, and possibly better Vietnamese, as Mary M mentions; But my only reference points are two places I used to go in Austin, both of which were great also.  Last night I had the standard Pho with rare beef and brisket (P2, if I remember correctly). It was the first time I remember being given hosion sauce (sweet), and I really like how it added to the broth. The bean sprouts could have been a little fresher, but I was just dumping them in the Pho, so who cares? We also had the pork rolls, which I wasn't too fond of, but were alright (these and the sprouts are the true cause of the 4 instead of the 5). There was just a slightly funny taste to them, and not how I remember having them in other places. Maybe that's just the inexperience in me, who knows? The interesting thing that my friend got was the rare flank steak. This was surprisingly good, just being beef covered with lime juice, cilantro and some spices. Plus it extended the pho after I had already eaten all the good stuff (beef, vermicelli, sprouts, etc).  So, from this uncultured slob who just came back to Cleveland, I'm liking what I saw. Not to mention, the cheapskate in me loves some cheap tasty food. I'll be back many times over, there's a lot to be sampled.   As a side note, anyone know of a Vietnamese sandwich joint in Cleveland? I went to one in Austin and fell in love with those sandwiches. If so, give me a message. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It has the best pho in Cleveland. They are always attentive and pleasant, but more importantly the food is awesome!"}
{"text":"Very tasty! I very much enjoy this place and have been coming here for years. Their vegetable crispy spring rolls and vegetable soup are very good. They're my go to dishes when I visit this place. Their homemade lemonade, chicken noodle soup, and summer rolls are other dishes I would recommend!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is terrible.  The pho is not up to par, and the service sucks.  Walked in on a Monday since Superior pho was closed.  The place had 2-3 customers, and its STILL took 10mins for the host to notice me and bring me to a table.  While on his cell phone.  Yea.  The pho was seriously mediocre.  The broth ok (hence the 2 star) but the noodles were not soft or chewy...but hard and undercooked.  The beef was THICK.  THICK.  Who's had pho that had thick cut pieces of beef? Not tender, a little stringy.  I mean, there were chunks of brisket in mine.  Chunks of onion.   Also, the portions are much smaller than normal pho places, which is actually ok with me since I never can finish a huge bowl.  BUT don't go around charging $8 for a tiny bowl when around the corner they charge $7 for one twice as large.  No no no no.  all wrong.  Nothing to do with me being snobby about pho...but this isn't how pho is done."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot in Cleveland.  Honestly, I would never have ventured over to this part of town, if I didn't work in the area.  The place gets quite busy.  It is pretty cheap, and has a nice interior.  If you drive around this part of town, most buildings are pretty run down; however, it looks like they remolded and looks clean."}
{"text":"My first trip to Number One Pho left me happy with a belly full of warm goodness on a cold night. But it also left me troubled... do I really have to choose? Can't I love both Number One Pho and Superior Pho?! WAH!   In my opinion, these two restaurants serve two different kinds of pho. Superior's broth packs a big punch with spices. Number One's broth hangs out in the background with a much milder flavor. At Superior I stick with just brisket because I found their regular beef pho a little chewy. But at Number One their regular beef cuts were super-tender and tasty--no brisket needed. In fact, with their lighter broth and super-skinny rice noodles (think angel hair-esque) they really let the meat of this soup dish shine. While Superior Pho's broth really takes over all other flavors.   I liked... ... that it wasn't super busy and we could just come in, sit down and be served without the hassle of huge crowds or waiting ... that our pho was served within mere minutes of ordering it, pipping hot--beef perfectly prepared ... that it looked a little more like a restaurant, a lot cleaner and less scary than it's competitor ... the thinner pho noodles were a great change of pace!  ... that it was easy to find and get into. Better than a hidden maze through other businesses.   I didn't like... ... that it was so dead I was wondering if something was wrong with this place!  ... that there was no Sriracha or hoisin bottles on the tables for you to use yourself. Instead they give you a small bowl with both condiments pre-rationed for you. I want to make my own call on how much I use.  ... the measly one plate of fixings for two orders of pho. Each person should either get their own plate, or a much larger portion for two   To sum it up, it's going to be really tough to choose now between these two neighboring competitors. So maybe I'll just make whoever I'm dining with choose instead."}
{"text":"i made the mistake of trying to give number one thought I try again. I should know better by now.  the cabbage salad has a nice flavor but the shrimp and the pork that are in it are pretty much tasteless. The pork almost has a boiled texture and zero flavor. The shrimp are just kind of like the cocktail shrimp you expect to get at a mediocre.   I had the summer rolls with shrimp in them. They were mostly  noodles. There was little or no flavor to them. There wasn't even any basil or any other herbs in them. I don't think I'll be back.  Chris"}
{"text":"I have been here many times and unfortunately I just can't like #1 Pho. It's in a very cute house, but the service has never been even average. I'm not sure how an Asian restaurant manages to be consistently below average in service, but it has happened. I do not prefer their vermicelli bowls over other establishments."}
{"text":"Not going to lie, this place is going downhill since I started coming 3-4 years ago. And it's probably the most expensive pho place among the other pho places in Cleveland area."}
{"text":"Good place for vermicelli and chicken cabbage salad. I do like Saigon just a bit better, even though they are owned by the same people. If you like to try new beer, try the beer called Hue. Very smooth."}
{"text":"I've used cleaner restrooms at a gas station.  I was hesitant about even staying for the meal, but did only because I was with friends.  It's been years since I had eaten there, and was really looking forward to the evening.  A nice hot bowl of pho and a beer on a cold Cleveland night was just what I needed.  The pho was actually quite good, but they had run out of beer and wine that night.  On a Saturday night?   #1 Pho, I want to like you and go back, but you've gotta step it up."}
{"text":"yes, i agree with the many yelpers who make references to california's pho, and i extend that to food in general. it's just better here in the sunshine state! but you can't bring california's restaurants with you when you move to cleveland, so you just have to be happy that there are people in cleveland who at least are trying to get stuff like pho out there. and it's not bad (although really you only have like 2 pho restaurants to choose from) and i was surprised at the restaurant's environment - it's nice! (nicer than superior pho) i don't recall my eggrolls being served cold over the vermicelli...i actually didn't have a bad impression or experience."}
{"text":"First, the restaurant had a mildly unpleasant smell: mildew-like. Whenever I try a new Vietnamese place, I order standard items to try/ test: Pho and fresh spring rolls with peanut sauce. First the spring rolls were good, I would even say above average, however, the peanut sauce wasn't very good. It was top spy based and lacked peanut flavor that you expect from this type of sauce. The pho was okay. The noodles were not al dente and the broth needed a lot of hoisin and siracha; it lacked salt. The meatballs tasted old, spoiled really. I had to pull them out and not eat them. To top it l off, the staff was so preoccupied with their iPads and radio, I had to flag them down a few times for service: refills, more siracha, more hoisin, my bill. Saigon Grille next door and even Superior Pho around the corner are better."}
{"text":"Been here dozens of times. The people working are very friendly if you get to talking to them. The pho itself is great. Broth is some of the best I have had, meat is cooked well (not the most meat you get but it's enough) and the pricing for the pho is very good. 9$ for large is a massive bowl, sure to fill you up. The other entrees are good, but the pricing on those is a little more (12-18$). Overall, the quality of the food, pricing, and atmosphere is one of my favorite places in the area. I prefer this pho's broth over 'superior pho' next door. The selection for entrees excluding pho is somewhat lacking compared to other places I have gone holds me back from giving this 5 stars, but it is still a fantastic place."}
{"text":"Food here was bleh. Springs rolls were okay. My pho was MUCH too salty (#P10 - Hu Tieu Bo Kho). The broth was too meaty and just not good. Also, I didn't get a separate plate of vegetables or the different sauces to add to the broth. I think this is because what I technically ordered is not traditional pho, even though it was listed under the heading of \"Pho - Vietnamese Noodle Soups\", so very misleading and disappointing. Plus, the dish was advertised as being spicy on the menu and there wasn't an ounce of anything remotely spicy.   Positives for this place - prices were good, food came out fast, and atmosphere was surprisingly decent. Not one of those small and skimpy Asian diners with fluorescent lighting and cheap tables/seats, but on the bigger size with nicer furniture and lighting. Someplace you'd actually want to sit down for dinner.  Service was fine throughout dinner. However, our table did get the stink-eye towards the end of the night around 9pm when we were the only ones left and they clearly wanted to close, even though the restaurant was technically open till 930pm."}
{"text":"Very good rare beef and chicken pho/soup. One of the highlights of being in that area; not much in downtown Cleveland. Would return."}
{"text":"This is a good backup. This cold rainy Sunday evening nothing sounded as good as pho, so I went in search of superior pho, which I somehow always get lost going to. I finally found it again but alas, it had closed at 7 pm. So, I figured I'd try #1 Pho next door, as it seems many other yelpers have done when faced with this same dilemma.  No, its not as good as Superior Pho. No its not as cheap, no you won't get bahn mi, etc etc. The pho did hit the spot though in my moment of desperation, and for that I am grateful.  The vermicelli noodles and pork dish we also ordered was okay, but you could tell the meat had been cooked in one big batch and set aside all day-- not just from the fact that the food came literally 60 seconds after we ordered it (both a good and a bad thing, as I've learned) but also just because of the flavor and consistency. The place is a bit nicer, which means nothing to me but I mention just as an FYI. I was certainly not disappointed, but I also know I won't be back unless I'm stuck in the same situation again, and if I am, I'll stick just to the pho.  In summary.. what debate??? Hands down superior kills it."}
{"text":"Eh, I've been here a couple of times and believe it survives simply because of it's yuppy vibe.  It's ok.  Broth doesn't taste that fresh and the smoothies taste from a mix.  Superior Pho is cheaper, homier and way more delicious."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go to for Vietnamese food.  I love their spring rolls with peanut sauce.  Also, my go to dish is B√∫n tht nng (vermicelli noodle salad with pork/crispy roll. Food served quickly, great flavor, and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Decent but certainly not the best pho in CLE. I know everyone is gaga for Superior Pho, which is pretty good, but I really like Minh Ahn."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a co-worker.  Warm inviting atmosphere upon entry.    Was put in a comforting frame of mind.  Staff was friendly.  I selected a Lemon Grass soup.  The description sounded better to me at the time than it tasted.  Good flavors though, tender beef, a mild spicy flavor too it.  Had a quick lunch and then left.  I would come back."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with friends and it's still great! The service was fast and friendly without being overbearing. One friend stuck with the pho and finished the entire thing in one go. Another ordered one of their seafood soups and loved it. And still another got two orders of the Banh Mi - while he wished there were less veggies and more meat on it, he was still a fan. This time around I went with the Bun Bo Hue - a spicy beef noodle soup. The beef was lovely, the broth had a bit of a kick and was rich and the noodles were chewy in a good way. This hit the spot on a snowy evening - will have to come back and try even more of their menu."}
{"text":"Really nice space in a bad part of town   The girl ordered a beef and noodle bowl. The beef was SALTY and cold and old. the rest of the plate had no flavor expect what the \"server\" (ie bored and salty herself) brought to the table in the way of a tiny dish of a vinegar sweet sauce...   For my entree... I ordered Pho ... my Fav.....beefynoodleygoodness. Not very flavorful broth, a good amount of meat and meat byproducts in the bowl... but a small bowl that any Pho junkie would hold in soupy disdain.. and NO TABLE SERACHA OR HOISIN..JUST A TINY SPLIT HERB BOWL ...a few ounces...no fish sauce, etc.,.   So yes...a cool space, and no not the best...maybe just for appetizers of some such craziness, a NUMBER ONE PHONY otherwise ( I crack me up...)   Search on pilgrim... you will not find your bowl of Pho Pleasure here!"}
{"text":"We just drove 6 hours to get to the Cleve.  Went for a walk, looked at the free stamp, and then wanted some food.  Wife wanted to order pizza in the room, but I told her that was crazy.  We went for a drive down the road looking for Superior Pho, but I wasn't going to drive down that alley.  being new to town and from Chicago I don't like driving down creepy alleys.  So I went to #1 Pho.  The spring rolls were nice and crispy, the Pho was delish with too many noodles to eat.  Mixed the perfect blend of spicy to sprouty limey and was good to go.  The wife ate a cold noodle dish with chicken that was pretty good.  We shared a taro bubble tea that was also good.  It is a nice little place to grab some noodles, too bad I am from out of town."}
{"text":"Not really a fan of Number One Pho. They are over priced for what they serve and the quality of the Pho is far below that of Superior Pho. The ambiance of the Number One Pho is a facade to make up for how bad their food is. The best thing I tasted there was their peanut sauce. Superior Pho is way better"}
{"text":"Meant to go here last time, but ended up next door so I tried this place a week ago. Shouldn't have bothered; everything was squished into a small Chinese take out box - when I peaked in the bag before leaving, I thought they had left something out, but was assured everything was there. Uh yea, everything was so tightly squished that it was too much effort just trying to peel the noodles away from everything else. And you can imagine the portion of ingredients if it all fit into that container! When I got home, I couldn't find the meat and was so disgusted and irritated when I noticed the few pieces I was given had been haplessly floating in the hot liquid since I left the establishment. Needless to say, the meat had overcooked in the broth and was nothing more than thin strips of leather. When I called and inquired why the items weren't put on the side for a take-out order like MOST normal Vietnamese places do for Pho, I only received a response was that I needed to ask??? Amount of meat given was so not worth the $9.00, barely two decent sized servings. Also, what Viet restaurant doesn't have the spicy peppered flakes oil/sauce, apparently they don't?!? I asked for extra and got some nasty mix that just ended up in the garbage.Broth was good, but not good enough to go back!"}
{"text":"Funny story- my visit to this place was a complete accident. My friends and I came here thinking this place was Superior Pho (we aren't from Cleveland and were only in the area to see the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame). While trying to figure out where Superior Pho was, we found this place merely feet away from where our map was telling us to go. Thinking that our map was just off and that there could not possibly be 2 Pho places so close together (wrong!), we stopped here for dinner.    Since I am not a Pho fan, I went with the Banh Mi Bo Kho, which is Vietnamese beef stew with bread. I've never tried it before and it sounded delicious. It was more than delicious, it was absolutely scrumptious!!! Such tender, juicy pieces of beef and veggies! So much flavor in the broth!! And to complete the dish perfectly, a crusty, fluffy loaf of bread that was just made for absorbing every last wonderful drop! Yum yum yum!!! Just thinking about it makes my mouth water...And to think I almost missed out on this delicious stew- thank goodness for confusing directions!!!"}
{"text":"From an asian's perspective, I would like to begin by saying that the pho here is substantially better than a certain over rated pho restaurant across the street. Period.   The pho here is flavorful and the noodles have the right consistency from what I expect in my pho. The herbs and bean sprouts that they give you are fresh. I am a bit disappointed in their spring rolls because I think Pho Thang has better spring rolls. The prices here are reasonable and the service here is pretty good. Parking around here isn't too bad and I was able to find parking on a Saturday night easily.   I would rate this 4.5 instead of the 3 stars at the time of this review. Not sure what these sub 3 star yelpers are eating."}
{"text":"Not everything can be judged or foretasted on face value alone. Oftentimes, you have to look past the surface to find the real character and soul of an establishment.   Sure Number One Pho is bigger, brighter, more open and classier than the competing Vietnamese soup house next door. It's easier to access too. It actually has it's own storefront off Superior Ave. Appearance alone shouldn't differentiate the two though. It's an eatery first and foremost. Their number one job is to serve you good food with good service. That's the primary concept. I've had some of the best meals of my life in basement cellars and no-frills dives. I can get past decor and ambiance if the food and service make up for it.   With that said, it seems tradition to compare the arch rival Number One vs. Superior Pho in each review. Me? I side with the hard to find dive in the mini indoor mall, just past the nail salon and across from the Korean place. To me, Superior Pho trumps Number One Pho by a significant margin.   First off, Number One Pho doesn't serve b√°nh m√¨ sandwich's. Superior does. Number One Pho seems to segregate the diners into  two separate rooms. The Asian room and the non-Asian room. If you're a Westerner, you are seated in the room to the left. While it didn't particularly bother me, I did find it a bit odd and hard not to notice the trend. Even before ordering, we were already put off.   We started with a crepe appetizer of some sort. Greasy and unappetizing both in taste and texture. The majority of it went uneaten. Next, we had a bowl of Pho each. The broth lacked the depth and flavor that I grew to love at Superior Pho. And what is this? No Sriracha on the tables?! That's like ordering a hot dog at a ballgame without stadium mustard. The two go hand in hand. Milk and cookies, mustard and dogs, sriracha and pho. I thought it was a given? Not here.   To summarize, despite the misleading name, Number One Pho is hardly that. For the real bothy goodness of French influenced Vietnam, head over to the dive joint just next door; Superior Pho."}
{"text":"It's hard not to compare #1 Pho to its neighbor, Superior Pho. Definitely a nicer restaurant with more space than Superior Pho but the food is also more expensive. Pho was okay and not as fresh which left quite a bit to be desired. The broth didn't measure up to other places I've been to (should I start it off with 30 sec of walking to Superior Pho?)  Pretty good ambiance but the overall experience was dwindled by sub-par service. #1 Pho? No way..considering it is outclassed by \"Superior\" Pho (as the name suggested) right next door."}
{"text":"How does this spot only have 3 stars? Yelptern Megan H and I visited tonight for some late night eats, and it was everything I wanted it to be. The restaurant had easy enough parking, the food came out super fast (it felt like five minutes), and the inside was clean and comfortable.  I was also glad to see that they had a full page vegetarian menu. I'm not a vegetarian, but I often feel bad when Megan and I eat out- by default I tend to pick carnivorous places, and I always feel like she ends up eating a piece of lettuce. The menu had a great selection all around. It felt like a good choice! Bring on the meat for me and fried tofu for her.  Oh, and hi, bubble tea! I was so happy they had so many flavors. I had the watermelon bubble tea and I would definitely get it again. Along with the beef pho, I was totally full. The portion of pho was huge and came with a giant plate of bean sprouts and limes (probably one of the biggest at all the pho places I've been). Overall, our visit felt quick because the service was great. I'd absolutely come back soon!"}
{"text":"Pho that tastes like pho. After many failures in Cleveland, this place finally gets it right."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. The pho is delish! All the veggies are fresh and so yummy. On top of that, the atmosphere is nice and doesn't smell like the sea. Oh, and there is a great vermicelli dish with spring rolls that tastes like heaven in a bowl. Inexpensive and fabulous is a winning combination for a cheap foodie like me. Go there!"}
{"text":"Somewhere in this ghost town of grey buildings (not a fan of Cleveland) is a Vietnamese gem. When I lived there, it was me - but as soon as I left, it became this restaurant.  There's a litmus test for any kind of \"ethnic\" (terrible word) restaurant. For instance, at a Chinese restaurant, you test the mongolian beef; at a Thai restaurant, it's the Pad-Thai... and for Vietnamese, it's Pho. My mom makes the best pho - and she taught me, now I make the best - so it's very hard for me to eat restaurant pho because of one major problem: MSG. All asian restaurants pump their food with MSG to make it taste better and give you cancer. This one doesn't - hence their fabulously up-to-par-with-homemade pho! Can't beat the price, either - unless you're friends with me and I'll make it even better... for free."}
{"text":"An unassuming look is deceiving. A late lunch, walking in around 1:45, there was still a decent crowd. I was seated quickly and my order was taken almost immediately.   The iced tea and spring rolls were ready and served in a flash. I had to wait a few minutes for the rolls to cool down. I passed that time munching on the various pickled and regular veggies on the plate. Once I was able to take the heat, I had a very pleasant time eating the spring rolls. They aren't very spicy but the dipping sauce has a nice light pepper taste.   While waiting for my pho ga to arrive, I had a moment to take in the decor. Interesting tiles in the drop ceiling, small low wattage hanging lights, bamboo shades, and a well worn wood floor set a nice calm mood.   Now the pho has arrived and I dig in. It comes with what seems like a tree of basil. That's a good thing. The sprouts however were wilted. Not so good. The flavor was good, though. I would prefer wooden chopsticks to the plastic ones they have here.   Overall, a good experience. I'd come back."}
{"text":"I am incredibly picky about my pho--my entire family has always been that way.  My expectations for Cleveland are obviously different than California.  In any case, on a cold, rainy day, I did enjoy the my piping hot bowl of pho.  I love beef balls, and they gave me a generous helping of beef balls.  The broth was serviceable, but not the best.  The meat had a funny taste to it-- that was probably the oddest thing. Service was prompt, they frequently refilled our water, and asked if the food was okay.  Overall, it was okay, passable, but not great."}
{"text":"What a change! From a first class restaurant to a mediocre one at best. The food may be ok but the smell of the bathroom may overwhelm your experience."}
{"text":"Pros: Nice interior, good lighting, clean, airy ambiance.  Decent appetizers (spring rolls). Cons: Sub-par to very mediocre, MSG-laden pho.  Originally wanted to hit up Superior Pho across the street for my birthday but didn't realize they were (randomly!) closed on Mondays.  The boyfriend and I had been planning to do a pho run for a while so at least we had the option to satisfy our pho craving a couple buildings down.   The interior was nicely renovated--wood paneling, good ventilation, sky-high ceilings--and there was a good mix of non Asian and Asian diners.  The place was rather empty and the service a little lackadaisical, but I suppose that's what 6pm on a Monday afternoon would look like in most restaurants.  We ordered our usual pho restaurant staples--pork and shrimp spring rolls and rare beef pho.  The spring rolls were decent though the skin was a little gooey, the shrimp a little fishy, and the vermicelli a little soft.  I'm used to my spring rolls crisp and cold, but they weren't terrible.  I'm also used to my rare beef pho served a certain way: very thinly sliced, pink, rare beef on top of a mound of noodles in piping-hot broth.  The idea of course is to douse your rare beef in the piping hot broth once you get it, essentially taking over the last 30 seconds of cooking your meal so that you have the freshest tasting pho possible.  Instead, our large (the serving of noodles was rather small-medium in my opinion) bowls came lukewarm with rather thick-cut fully cooked beef (with a strangely fluffy, starched-up texture) swimming in a handful of noodles.  The beef and broth were a little weak and the noodles, again, on the soft,, slightly overcooked side.  Still, we thought it was passable until at the very end, when we started feeling the tell-tale signs of MSG: my throat start clogging up and the bf complained of extreme thirst, no matter how much broth he took down.  Don't get me wrong.  MSG is delicious.  It's in bouillon cubes.  It makes chips taste amazing.  It keeps soup in a can and top ramen in business.  It's concentrated sodium.  Humans love that stuff.  But when you're boasting to be Number One Pho, you do not, I repeat, DO NOT base your broth on MSG.     Maybe Number One Pho used to be better--they have newspaper articles raving about them posted up in the front window.  Maybe Number One Pho is great for other items on their menu--boba, broken rice, bun, etc.  But if that's the case, maybe Pho shouldn't be in your restaurant name.  Maybe--very probably--Number One Pho gets away with serving up less than Number One stuff because there just isn't that much competition in the pho market here in Cleveland.  Because it sure wouldn't last very long in Los Angeles.  Just sayin.  I've heard great things about the Vietnamese food scene in Cleveland, so hopefully this is just a fluke.  Number One Pho will probably suffice if you a) really really need Vietnamese food and you're in the area and it's Monday and/or b) you're put off by Superior Pho's no-frills hole-in-the-wall setup.    Expect an equally honest report after I return for Superior Pho.  Till then, thanks for reading, kids!"}
{"text":"We decided to give the Pho a try here for lunch today. The service was prompt and we were served and seated right away. It was a quick decision as to what we wanted to order. We were here to check out the broth! Decided to have their salad rolls (they called it something else on the menu) but the guy knew what we were talking about (shrimp lettuce and rice noodles wrapped in a rice crepe. It was pretty good, however, I could tell that they did not make these to order as the rice crepe was beginning to get dry.   A few minutes later, our Pho came. I had the Pho with beef balls and my husband just got the regular Pho with beef. We took a sip of the broth..it was...pretty good...clean and simple with nice flavour. HOWEVER, it lacked the richness that comes with broth that is made from boiling beef bones from scratch. I wonder if it was a vegetarian broth? The freshness of the sprouts, limes,veggies were okay. For $8 per small bowl though, I would have liked better. I'm used to eating fab Pho for half that price..  I decided to end my meal with a surprise item on the menu.. tarot bubble tea. DO NOT order the bubble tea here. The pearls aka boba were old, and some were not cooked through. Horrible. And I was complaining that Koko bakery sometimes was not up to par. I'll take my chances there. Will we be going back to this place? Perhaps...but just for simple Pho. And maybe to go and test the coffee next."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I have to say the food is really good and always consistent. Never very crowded and we always get fast service as soon as we sit down. I have to say the restaurant itself is a bit run down and not very fancy but we come here for the delicious food. I love their pork and shrimp spring rolls to start. They have a wonderful peanut sauce and chili sauce if you like it spicy.  I've had their soups and noodle bowls and they always hit the spot! Fresh ingredients make for a very satisfying meal. I highly recommend the vermicelli. The chicken, pork, beef, or shrimp vermicelli, they are all very good! The Vietnamese noodle bowls are very filling and delicious too. The large portion is only $1 more than the regular portion and it's worth it. You can definitely take home left overs.  On the bad side, They don't really serve any alcohol. We wanted to order beers but they only had bud light so we passed. They don't have any wine or liquor. However, If you're looking for some authentic Vietnamese this should be your first stop. It's #1! :)"}
{"text":"This was by far the worst Pho I ever had. Definitely will not return. Broth was flavorless and the meat was very cheap, not even edible. My boyfriend had the egg noodles instead of the rice noodles and it was no better. It's pretty cheap and the food comes out very quick, hence why I give it two stars instead of one."}
{"text":"Every time a friend of mine comes into Cleveland to visit from the Youngstown area we have to go to Number One Pho.  She will not have it any other way.  I usually get the summer roll and then something that is vegan with tofu that I can't remember what it is.  I've gotten the summer rolls just as a meal and they are pretty filling but a tad bit on the salty side when you have more than one order.  My friend loves the Pho and she is one of those people who has traveled all over the world so I'll take her word that it is awesome."}
{"text":"Ok, I get the debate. I've tried both #1 and Superior, and #1 still gets 5 stars.   While Superior wins on food (wow, that is really good pho), #1 has just as much going for it. The hours are later, they're open on Mondays, the tables and chairs are always clean, they emphasize presentation over convenience (no giant bottles of sauces or napkin dispensers here), and the atmosphere is more restaurant than food stand. The service is always prompt, the meals are affordable, and you can enjoy a nice plum wine with your noodles. #1 definitely earns its name on service and presentation."}
{"text":"Came on a monday for my vietnamese food fix.  superior pho is closed on monday, saigon on vacation, so I came over to number one pho for take out.  ordered my fav dish, vermicelli noodles, the Bun Dac Biet.  Price was a little bit more than the menu on Yelp, $9 versus the listed $8...no big deal.  I paid with credit card and the food came out within 2 minutes which was super speedy!  I'm assuming everything was pre-prepared (no surprise for Viet food), so they just threw everything in a box and packed it up for me.   When I got home to eat it 20 minutes later, it was obvious how everything was pre-prepared.  The only thing that bothered me was the spring roll was cold, soft and sitting around for a while...definitely NOT crunchy.  The pork was good, they provided a decent amount and it had a good flavor.  There were only 2 pieces of shrimp (weak!) and they were both overcooked.  The entire meal was decent, nothing to write home about.  It filled my stomach, but didnt necessarily satisfy my craving."}
{"text":"Killer Pho and summer rolls. It's the stuff dreams are made of. Exceptionally friendly staff. Worth a 45 minute drive!"}
{"text":"I love this place and eat here often. Super fast service, large and filling portions that don't leave you feeling like you have gorged yourself. The pho is great for a winter warmup, but I'm addicted to the House Special vermicelli with crispy spring rolls and grilled BBQ pork."}
{"text":"Been here plenty of times for lunch with the folks. This time I wasn't super hungry for their beefy pho usual so I discovered they have a plain pho option for much less~ bargain! And that was just enough for me. Sometime in the future I'll be grabbing an app and a bubble tea with some friends~"}
{"text":"I've been trying to decide between Superior Pho and Number One Pho and after eating here recently I've decided that Superior is superior when it comes to the actual soup (at least for the standard beef brisket soup at each place).  Some highlights of Number One Pho: - great shredded pork rolls (Bi Cuon) - good atmosphere - bathrooms don't require a lock and key (unlike Superior)  I'd give this place another shot, but with Superior down the street it's hard for me to say how soon that'll be."}
{"text":"I always come to this Viet restaurant when I'm craving Viet food. They have great pork chop meal and pho! This week I stopped in to order food togo. I was on a time crunch and was afraid I'd be late for work but ordering was quick and it took max 10 mins to order and get my food. I ordered a Bahn mi - a Vietnamese sandwich that has grilled pork, a pickled carrot and daikon, jalape√±os, cilantro. Hope I'm not missing any ingredients. $4!!! Such and awesome deal! My spring rolls cost $5, more than my sandwich! But it was nice surprise that they had included cucumber, carrots and daikon along with the dipping sauce in my togo container. It was good but I don't recommend ordering it togo because you loose the crunch because it gets soggy as it sat in the container. But that was my fault for not eating it right away. Next time I have time to dine in I want to try B√∫n ri√™u! It's a crab noodle soup one of my friends recommended."}
{"text":"I came here with a craving for banh xeo. I left wondering if I would ever love banh xeo ever again.  If only other Viet places served up delicious banh xeo, then I wouldn't have had to suffer through my lackluster meal here...  Banh xeo is essentially a crepe filled with bean sprouts and meat. Oh and p.s. I LOVE BEAN SPROUTS. I have been asked more than once \"Would you like some pho with those bean sprouts?\". But anyways, their banh xeo was just... limp and sad. Rather than nearly exploding my stomach with delicious bean sprouts, it left an empty hole in my craving for banh xeo. Then my pho tai came. Personally, I consider the broth the most important aspect of pho. This broth was... just no good. After I finished what I could, I let the leftovers sit. Slowly but surely the broth began to separate. Yuck. This always makes me suspect that a broth flavoring packet has been used, rather than the broth being made from scratch. What is my support for this reasoning? Absolutely nothing, it's just a gut assumption.   So anyways, in the battle of Cleveland pho spots, this place is low on my list. The only thing they've got going on that Superior Pho (which is right across the street)  doesn't is the fact that they are open later."}
{"text":"When I went here with some friends, we had really bad service, and the pho was more expensive and not as tasty as Pho Hoa which is pretty much right across the street."}
{"text":"I usually go to Superior Pho for Vietnamese food, but since it was closed on Mondays I came to this place instead.  The food was very average.  I ordered the grilled pork vermicelli with an added egg roll.  The egg roll was soggy and its contents were not particularly appetizing.  The grilled pork was okay, but both the meat and the vegetables didn't seem very fresh.  The two star rating is for the service.  Our waiter had an attitude from the beginning of the meal - he was snappy when he poured us water and also when he asked us for our orders.  Throughout the meal he was very curt and abruptly snatched our plates when we were finished.  It seemed like he didn't want to be at work that day.  I'm usually fairly tolerant of different levels of restaurant service, but this time I was particularly appalled by the server's attitude."}
{"text":"There isn't a \"vegetarian pho\" option on the menu, but, you can ask for the vegetable soup to have the rice noodles and to add tofu to it. once you do, you get a very substantial bowl of pho!   No liquor, but they do have a small beer selection."}
{"text":"My lab-meets and I had our month lunch a week ago and I brought my wife here today. Their food is always good. We like pho and the special pho soup very much. Their service was fast and friendly. This is becoming a new place for me and my friends to spend our weekly lunch time."}
{"text":"The Pho is absolutely amazing. Slowly becoming my favorite place for chicken pho. Cool vibe inside, family owned and super friendly. Great spot def worth checking out"}
{"text":"Pho was less than average. Not a lot of flavor, didn't bring the veggies out (until we asked for it), or the hoisin & Siracha. Service was poor! Very arrogant and rude from the 2 out of 3 people that worked there. The bun bo hue was decent, they charge $2 for pig feet, but they didn't tell me and they made it sound like it was included.   Wouldn't come back. We enjoyed superior pho better.  We would've came back if they weren't so rude."}
{"text":"The pho was good, flavorful and was authentic enough. We asked for extra meat and they delivered a full serving which was nice. The spring roll sauce was just hoisin and peanuts which wasn't that tasteful. The place had a nice environment and was clean. The server was nice and attentive. Generally, it was a nice lunch."}
{"text":"Okay before you scream at my 4-stars, let's put it in perspective. This is Cleveland, which is in Ohio, okay? Comparing Pho in Ohio with Pho in California would be like comparing ski resorts in Texas with those in Whistler...  All in all I've been nothing but impressed at this place. The Pho is good - definitely not greasy in my opinion, and I'm pretty sensitive to grease. Everything I've had here is flavorful and nicely seasoned. The spring rolls and salads are also quite good - the vegetables are quite fresh and I personally love the Lotus salad.   And the decor is also really quite nice, when you put it in perspective... again, this is Superior in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I have had pho at several places, including Superior Pho right next door, and Number One is by far the best!  The broth at Number One, in both flavor and aroma, far surpasses that at other pho joints.  The rest is just a bonus, the basil and sprouts should not be missed. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Man...gotta say, this was a TOTAL fail for me.  The soup came out pretty luke warm, which is super weird for a pho place. The fried rolls were pretty meh too.  I don't know really what to say about this, I got a little concerned when I saw the clientell and that there was a line to get in...  It seems as though Cleveland just ain't the place for pho :("}
{"text":"Number One Pho is number one in my heart! I love Asian food, and this place definitely? has a ton of tasty options to choose from!  To drink, I got the mango bubble tea. I'm obsessed with bubble tea, so my standards are pretty high when it comes to this tasty drink. Number One Pho surpassed my expectations, and the tea to tapioca bubbles ratio was perfect! It was perfectly sweetened.  I got the fried tofu for dinner, and it was cooked to perfection. It came with a soy sauce, which was a perfect complement to the tofu.   Next time I'm looking for some authentic Asian food in Cleveland, this place will be my first choice!"}
{"text":"I've been going here since 2004 while I did an internship downtown... Fantastic. The boys even remembered me after I came back from a year deployment to Iraq!  I don't get to go a lot so I always end up getting the chicken vermicelli with a spring roll. Great spot for lunch but also fun for dinner with a large group! You can't go wrong with a vermicelli dish and a bubble tea there!"}
{"text":"Pho is good. The broth is tasty, but a little bleh by the end of the bowl.  Upscale interior. Boba not so good."}
{"text":"Since it's called \"Number One,\" I was expecting to be impressed. This was my first experience with pho and if this is indeed number one, pho must be a very overrated food. The beef and pork seemed to be low quality. Most of the restaurant surfaces were covered in grime like one would find above an oven. The floors were sticky all over. The service was friendly but overall the experience was a disappointment. It takes more than an important name to make a restaurant number one."}
{"text":"Order Pho when you go here. You wont be disappoited. And the spring rolls are amazing. Especially the soft one. They could have done better with the drinks but overall, it was a great experience for me"}
{"text":"This place is definitely number one! Amazing pho and summer rolls. Broth is light but full of complex flavors. Service is fast as well. My favorite is the rare beef. Much prefer it to superior pho! Shrimp wonton is good too. Have yet to try the other food, but should! Only issue is that there is no definite closing time. Have to call and ask if it's beyond 730pm!"}
{"text":"So came here for lunch to try out their pho. It was pretty busy during lunch but we did overheard someone say it was partly because Superior pho is closed on Monday.  Overall, I'd rate this an even 3.  The host was nice but unfortunately their seating arrangement doesn't lend itself to larger groups as well as other places, so we ended up waiting 30-40 mins. That's not really anyone's fault - we decided to wait.  When we did get seated, the order was taken pretty quick and food came out in a timely manner. Positive marks for this.  I got a standard P2. First impressions on the broth are that it lacks depth of flavor, especially that a deep meaty boney flavor you'd expect. After I added some basil, jalapenos and lime it perked up a tad. There werent many bean sprouts brought to the table or enough limes for everyone :(. The soup to noodle ratio seemed off (too few noodles) and the meat looked like a mix of pretty thick 'thin' slices and chunks of scrap meat. While the thin stuff was edible the larger chunks were not enjoyable. Overall the pho was edible but not memorable.  Unfortunately, I wasn't impressed and will stick with Superior when in asiatown and craving pho."}
{"text":"Good pho sure.  I've had pho in asia (not Vietnam), Canada (either Vancouver or Toronto), and here.  This was good stuff.  The broth was not overly sweet, the rare beef and brisket were good, and the sauces they give you to put in the pho allowed me to get the perfect combination of sweet and spicy.  On top of that I love the decor.  It is pretty amazing that this place exists in the midst of all those abandoned buildings.  That all being said, the bubble tea should probably be avoided.  Way too much ice and the bubbles were a random mix of cooked through and partly raw."}
{"text":"Tbh, my wife and I did not even get to taste the food... so this review is not about the food.. Before we go, we checked the closing time and it was 9:30pm. We got there at 8:38pm to be exact and the server said \"we are closed...\"??? Dude, I know how restaurants works (esp Asian ones), I've worked at one before. How much does it really takes to serve a bowl of Pho?? Might as well just change the closing time... to maybe 9pm then I would understand.  I do not care if the food is good or bad, this is already a broken promise from this restaurant... disappointed."}
{"text":"for the price, which is more expensive than superior pho's next door, the portions are very small. i also don't think the pho tastes any better than superior next door. i'd also prefer a more lived-in atmosphere like superior."}
{"text":"I'll preface this by saying, we are vegans, so we didn't have the 'real' pho, so I can't speak for that. But the vegetarian broth tasted like boiled funyuns. Both my husband and I will eat almost anything, we are like garbage disposals. But we couldn't get when a quarter way through that. Plus, hot tea was lukewarm."}
{"text":"Though I don't have many places which I liked during my stay in Cleveland but this was an exception. Visited this restaurant during extreme cold and to get better food as downtown does not have good options.  Located in an industrial area this is probably the only restaurant in the area. The place itself is very spacious and had ample seating available for patrons. After my initial visit I came here a couple of times. My favorites here are the Pho and chicken cabbage salad. The pho broth is so good I can eat it all day along, definitely a must visit place when craving some good authentic pho."}
{"text":"Number One Pho is probably number one of Cleveland? What a weird name. Nonetheless, the pho was good.  Stopped here on Sunday with fellow yelper Vince L. and some other friends. It's kind of ironic this place is next door to Superior Pho- they could have at least picked a better spot.  #1 Pho interior is much nicer than Superior Pho's. More classier, just more restaurant-y, instead of being in a strip mall.   We started off with the salted squid. Quite yummy. There's not much actual squid on the plate, but there's some veggies along with it, that makes it good.  I ordered the #5 pho- pretty much all the beefs with the pho. I was happy with it. There was a lot of meat, tendons, and noodles...plus, the broth was GOOD. I was definitely impressed. Others seems to like theirs as well.  People debate on which pho place they like better- superior or #1. My friend next to me kept saying he liked superior better. Don't get me wrong, I like superior's hole in the wall feel, the more home cooked-ness of it all....but I feel in terms of quality, #1 is just better. Except.. it's about 2 dollars more. So, I guess it's more preference? Pay more for a little bit better? I'm not sure.  Definitely a fan of #1 pho. Are there any other pho places? A #2, #3, or something with a triumphant term in it, like \"Superior\"?"}
{"text":"We've been to this place and brought friends several times.  Consistently good no matter what we order.  The Shrimp and Pork Cabbage Salad was excellent, the Pho is always awesome!"}
{"text":"Ok, today finally tried this restaurant, I live in erie pa, don't have this kind of food, I was craving for this.  My husband order pork chop with white rice, only 1 little piece, taste so common, it cost $10, if it is taste good, don't mind, but....... order the Pho noodle, the soup was so so, just salty, little disapointed, next will try different place."}
{"text":"Came to visit the BF's fam for christmas. In the past we've gone to Superior Pho, which has been good. We decided to go today. they were closed so we went to this Number One despite the reviews.  We ordered Pho Bo Tai in small. It was pretty expensive for pho... 8 dollars for a small. When it came out, the broth was light and for a second i thought maybe it was chicken, but i saw the steak. I put in everything i wanted (I'm all about the sides). Took a sip of the broth and it was very flavorful! I was very surprised. It was a tiny bit sweeter than I'm used to, but it was a very good flavor. The steak was fine too.  I'm from the San Francisco Bay Area and hands down we have the BEST pho here. I've had Pho in nearly every state i've ever traveled to and know when it's bad or good.  Because of the price i'd rather hit up Superior Pho, but i was pleasantly surprised about the quality of the soup. Real Pho is supposed to be very clear (like not much particles floating around in it) so i guess thats why despite the broth's looks, it still tasted quite good."}
{"text":"I eat here alot because I work close, and over 5 years their food has stayed consistently good.  They give you large portions, the pricing is pretty standard, and the few things that are my favorits are the best between the 3 vietnamese restaurants that are all in a row.  I can personally vouch for their crispy spring rolls and chicken cabbage salad... everyone in my office agrees they get our vote for those two dishes, plus many more that I can't pronounce or spell.  :)"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place out after realizing that Superior Pho was not open on Mondays.  The pho is not as good as Superior Pho, but it is not bad.  The pho tai was ok.  The summer rolls were very tasty, well balanced and fresh, and came out in a flash.  The atmosphere is very elegant and the service is pleasant.  This place would be nice for a date.  The crowd was mostly well dressed business men and women. However, it was telling that the only Asians eating there were the staff.    So as Plan Bs go, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't good enough to lure me away from future visits to the less glamourous Superior Pho."}
{"text":"I wish I could rate a restaurant 3.5 star. I had similar experience like other ppl, I intended to go to superior pho, but ended at no1 pho. I ordered p10, b7 and a Thai tea bubble tea. The bubble tea was ok, boba was prbly made a day ago, but the tea was fine. P10, is a braised beef noodle soup. I like salty food and I almost could never have a dish that is too salty for me, but that soup is a little bit too salty IMO. Um, but I likes the braised beef a lot, very rich flavor. B7 is a combo plate, the shrimps were way way way overcooked, the spring roll, the flavor is strange and I couldn't figure out what's inside. The pork is ok, but a little too sweet for me"}
{"text":"Took my girlfriend out for date night. We were actually trying to go to \"Superior Pho\" next door, but mistook \"#1 Pho\" for \"Superior Pho.\" (It was like a movie scene, you should have seen it) Waitress was too distracted trying to impress the other waiter. My girlfriend and I were too distracted from enjoying our time to shoo all of the flies away from our heads and food. The food was decent, the bubble tea was good. After I complained about the flies, the waitress and waiter came out with two fly swatters and attempted to kill the flies (very loudly) Funny, yes, but hardly an enjoyable date night atmosphere. Get it together Faux Pho!"}
{"text":"Number 1 Pho was plan B, because Superior Pho happened to be closed.  California native, and former Bostonian resident, a bowl of sub-par pho is wayyyy over priced for Cleveland!  I wasn't the happiest camper after wasting calories on this joint!  The broth taste like water.  I wanted to add the fish sauce in myself. Instead, I numbed my taste buds with siracha.  You must be paying extra for the decor and illusion that you are in an authentic Vietmanese resturant."}
{"text":"Philly has the controversial Pat's vs. Gino's rivalry for Cheese steaks. Cleveland's Asia Town has Number One Pho vs. Superior Pho. Everybody always picks Superior though so it is not much of a rivalry. One reviewer calls the neighborhood deserted and sketchy. I say the entire city is deserted and sketchy. Those two adjectives are what I think Cleveland has going for it. I prefer that to New York which is overpopulated and expensive. I have been to Number One a few times now, mostly on Mondays and I don't see how Superior has 1.5 star higher rating. The 1.5 star difference may be relative to the 1.5 dollar difference for a bowl of soup. The rare beef was sliced thinly and didn't have any fat gristle. I will continue to patronize Number One Pho if I am feeling agoraphobic or it is a Monday and Superior Pho is closed."}
{"text":"The Gay Vietnamese Dude and the Straight White Chick speaketh the truth, says this straight Korean chick who used to live in Silicon Valley and eat pho every week.  I took my first time pho Mother-In-Law there based on their Yelp reviews.  I knew the GVD would never steer me wrong and if the SWC likes it too, then it's a good bet for my MIL.   The pho is definitely best in Cleveland and as good as anything in Silicon Valley and better than lots in SV.    Added Bonus:  the decor is rather upscale for a place called Number One Pho.  From the name, Pho pro's might expect the plastic turntable with the holder of plastic chopsticks, paper napkins, stack of tiny plastic condiment saucers, and squeeze bottles of hoisin sauce and chili sauce.   NOT SO!!  Instead there were lovely wood laminate floors, cherry colored wood trim everywhere, decent furniture.    They also serve wine, another surprise.  I was glad for all this because it's a place my mother in law would feel comfortable in and she loved the food.  We also had the the crispy, always incredibly greasy crepe filled with stuff, and I had the vermicelli noodles with pork.  The pork was a bit on the too sweet side, but very tasty nonetheless.  It reminded me of overly sweet bulgogi, actually.  My only nitpick is that the accompanying veggies were cut like crinkle cut french fries instead of into a nice big pile of julienne sticks.  So they didn't mix in well with the vermicelli.  Portions were huge and we took most of it home.  The iced coffee was the usual with the little thingie that brews it right into the glass and a winner too.  I was very tempted to try the \"bubble tea\" what we normally call milk tea with black pearls, but since this is Cleveland and the stuff is horrific if done wrong, I was afraid.  I suppose I will have to wait until I get back to Cafe Verde in Mountain View, CA.  If anyone tries the bubble tea let me know.     It was crowded for lunch this Monday from what appeared to be a CSU crowd.  However, there was no wait and our waitress was quick like lightning, super sweet, totally efficient, and completely unobtrusive.  She was very fast, yet we were able to enjoy our meal in a leisurely fashion."}
{"text":"Coming back to Ohio from Canada, we were hungry and craving some vietnamese food. Given that it was fairly late (around 8:40 pm) and other Vietnamese restaurants were already closed, we decided to give this place a try. When we first entered the restaurant, we didn't receive a warm welcome at all. The guy working there didn't smile or even say a word. He simply lead us to our table and that was the only interaction we had with him. Only after a few minutes, did a girl waitress come out to help us. She was an improvement compared to the guy. My brother and I both ordered pho, pho tai bo vien and pho dac biet, respectively and both large. My other friend ordered bun bo hue. Of all the Vietnamese places we have been to, this is saltiest pho that both of us have had (coming from Vietnamese people this is pretty bad). The bun bo hue was better but the portion size was a lot smaller even though it was the same price as the large bowls of pho. The portion size of the large bowls of pho were also disappointing. The veggies that came with our dish was not in any better shape. It wasn't fresh and didn't seem to have been washed pretty well. I wouldn't recommend this place until they improve their customer service and quality of their food."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review. It pains me to have to do this because it was my favorite Pho for years. They are now under new management and the menu has changed and the the recipes are different. They eliminated our favorite appetizer where you build your own spring rolls and the replacement was tasteless and suburban tasting.  I ordered my usual (P1 - Pho Bo) and yesterday it was not rich and savory. It was thinned down and the beef had no taste to it. I hate to say it but even the suburban pho restaurants have better food now. Pho & Rice in coventry for example which I wouldn't even put in my top 10 Pho restaurants...  However, at least they got rid of the pine sol smell..."}
{"text":"I don't get 3 stars.  Really?    Had lunch here yesterday.  We were promptly greeted, seated, and food was served quickly.  A large plate of accompaniments arrived at our table for the pho we ordered ( a table of 4 and we all ordered pho).  Sprouts, lime wedges, jalapeno slices, and basil.  Shortly after those arrived our bowls of pho were delivered.  I ordered the pho ga (chicken noodle soup).  The large bowl arrived with piping hot broth, what seemed like a half pound of rice noodles, shredded white chicken meat, and sliced green onions.  The broth was a nice balance of chicken flavor and spice.  Not too overpowering.  If you are looking to get slapped in the face by ginger and star anise you won't find that here.  Everything in the bowl for me was just right.    This wasn't my first trip to this fine establishment and won't be my last."}
{"text":"Except the tradition pho one, nothing is good taste. Do not order RICE stuffs! The waiter seems like does not understand english...."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today with some friends.  I enjoyed my food even though it was on the expensive side.  The reason for the low review is that one of my friends had a dead moth in his soup, which was supposed to be vegetarian!  I probably won't be going back unless someone twists my arm."}
