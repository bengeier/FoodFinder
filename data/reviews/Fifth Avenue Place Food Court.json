{"text":"They have a fairly decent selection. I imagine a good place for teens to hang out on Fridays after class, that's the sort of pleasant and inviting vibe I got."}
{"text":"The food court is located in the second floor. That is also where you will find public restrooms. The restaurant offerings in the food court include AuBon Pain, Cheesesteak Charley's, Flamers, and Chinese food. If you want something a little sweet duck into the Hallmark store and grab some Sarris. There is also Katie's Kandy on the 1st floor. It has tons of different candy that you purchase by the pound. If you need a caffeine fix there is a great coffee shop located under the escalator. (Sounds weird, but trust me)."}
{"text":"Few places to choose from here. Not a typically large food court but enough. If I worked in the building I'd definitely grow tired of it. However I've walked to meet friends for lunch a few times and it was ok.  I've eaten at the Chinese food place and Au Bon Pain; typical fare."}
