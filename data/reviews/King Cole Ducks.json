{"text":"I live in Calgary and have purchased King Cole Ducks a couple of times from our neighborhood Co-op grocery store (there's a duck in the oven as as I write this). Tender and waaaay less fat than other ducks I have cooked. I wish I lived closer to their store so I could get more of their products."}
{"text":"Boy, if u like eating ducks, should go to King Coles duck. It sell everything you can imagine related to ducks! For me, I love making duck breast at home and it offer regular raw ones and smoked one. And for each they also offer frozen ones and non frozen ones, just pick depending on your needs. So u can get the non frozen one if u so desire to eat one in the same evening so it save u the trouble from thawing it... and each piece is like $7, I think it's good price. If u r chef at home and love eating duck, u should love this place! It sells other duck parts and it even sell duck fat! Perfect if u want to pan seared your duck breast! But you better get your body check for cholesterol every year if u r gonna eat all those duck fat! :) 

The place is clean and spacious and organized. U shouldn't have too much trouble to find what u want. I always go there now whenever I crave for ducks. I hope u will love this place too."}
{"text":"Wow had trouble pricing the prepared frozen half a Duck L'Orange in Loblaw's. When priced at 13.00 I though it was a good price. I have eaten Duck in great French and Chinese restaurants. Did the breasts on the BBQ and loved Pressed Duck. Not many of those Duck presses around. So followed the instructions. The boiling the water was the hardest part. My cooking sucks. But, when finished under the broiler. Wow Super Wow a great meal. Well butchered, seasoned great sauce, packaged and prepared superbly. If I had any reason to return to Ontario after 50 years the King Cole Duck is at the top of the list."}
{"text":"I have passed this place multiple times and finally stopped in today. I thought \"what the duck\" I am going in...

 I got a price list since it seemed to be a mystery online... I do not know how to cook duck but that does not seem to be an issue here. There are a few recipes you can get online or in the store to be able to create a decent meal from duck. 

King Cole duck has fresh air chilled duck all different cuts ie) whole duck, half duck, duck eggs, duck burgers, frozen duck, even duck tongue(eesh) (my opinion) . You can even purchase pre seasoned duck. 

I know its not for everyone. But I must say the prices are very decent if you eat duck and its all fresh no injected gmo type stuff. 

I will say that for a whole duck you can buy a package with six whole ducks for about 70.00 dollars. A friend tells me that is a \"duckin\" good deal.

Duck burgers which were pretty large are about $4.00 per burger. Duck eggs 20 eggs for $10.00. 

At any quack check it out!"}
{"text":"I really duck this place! Local Naturally Raised Duck right in my backyard!

Duck everything! All their body parts fresh, chilled, frozen, seasoned, marinated or just plain. Rendered duck fat.. Yes Please!

What if you are not a good cook? Then just get the smoked duck breast ($7), all you need to do is defrost and serve! Voil√†!! 

And if you want something more fancy, I would suggest the fresh duck liver. (recipe available in store or online)

For the ultimate head to toe and more, you can get 100% duck dirt compost made from duck \"waste\". Now even your garden would have thank you.

King Cole Duck is really the one stop store for the duck lovers. Drop by if you are in the area and get inspired!"}
