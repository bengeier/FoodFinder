{"text":"I did receive an email from the owner regarding my recent visit. He asked me to return with my receipt but I advised that I did not want anything in return. He said that they could not find any record of the order. I told him I did not keep the receipt as I called the restaurant when I learned of the mistake and declined a replacement at that time. I appreciate the reply and realize that all new establishments have start up pains. I hope that they work through these and become a valued part of Fairview Park's scene."}
{"text":"My new favorite pizza joint! We stopped in just on a whim and found the pie to be awesome.  The taste of the crust takes me back to my grandma's kitchen on a Saturday night, great flavor, good crunch, yet soft and fluffy inside!   The staff is amazingly friendly and super helpful. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Great local pizza, many delicious options, cooked well, served expertly, and friendly customer service. Would get take out from Sauced every day, if I could."}
{"text":"First time trying the neighborhood spot. The crust is amazing! Sauce is great. Priced right. I ordered the Margherita which was supposed to have \"a drizzle\" of balsamic, but it was swimming in it - puddles of it everywhere. Next time I'll have to be more specific."}
{"text":"Wow what a great Pizza! I bought the Sicilian and the crust was fantastic. The pizza was complemented by the service. Very friendly and very quick. They have a rewards program also. It's very clean and nicely decorated inside, so although I went to pick up pizza to take home, it would be a great place to go to sit down and eat with friends and family. I might try it for lunch because they have some great lunch specials also"}
{"text":"Friendly fast service.  Reasonable prices.  Personal pizza pretty good size. Crust not too thick and doughy.  And cooked with real fire wood :)"}
{"text":"We ordered  3 Little Pigs (Pepperoni, bacon, sausage). The pizza was excellent and the staff was very friendly.  The crusts are thin crusts and the dough tastes amazing.  A great addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Ate in with my 4 year old daughter. Both of us loved it. Plus, sitting at the counter she was able to see the fire in the oven, which she watched the entire time. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Picked up pizza for my co-workers and we can't get enough of it! The staff were very friendly! Great food!"}
{"text":"Got a pepperoni and a white pizza. Enjoyed both. Having grown up on NY pizza, I love the thin slices and in this case, it's not greasy. If you like wood fired pizza and are not satisfied with the lackluster pizza options in West Park and Fairview, check this out"}
{"text":"We picked up pizza from here last night. First time trying. Very delicious pizza's! Perfectly made dough/crust, wasn't overly thick or heavy. Good tasty crunch! We got the \"Satullo\" pizza and a \"Build your own\" pizza. Had good fresh veggie toppings and fresh tasty sauce! They had a large variety on their menu, will definitely try other items!"}
{"text":"So I heard from some coworkers about this place and decided to try them, even though the line was super long. Coming from one of the most impatient people... It was worth the wait! I had a pizza with garlic and mushrooms and I believe onions as well. It was divine. There is nothing better than a wood fired pizza fresh from the oven. Under $10 and so many options. I have been craving more ever since. Only negative: having trouble finding out where they are, need more pizza!"}
{"text":"Stopped by yesterday for lunch. The building looked like a converted gas station but was very surprised by the way they fixed it up. The place is very clean with nice dining area. We both had the 10\" pizza and a large salad we split. The pizza was cooked just right in a wood oven and the salad was huge. The pizza sauce was very good and the pie wasn't limp when you pick up a piece. The special came with conoli that was very good"}
{"text":"Bomb pizza. The crust is unreal, thank god they don't char it. Rivals some of the best pizza in the cleveland. Also super fast, ordered and within 10 minutes it was at the table. The people there are awesome. After having paid and sat down, one of the employees came over apologizing and saying I had accidentally been charged more than I should. They refunded the order. Never would have realized. This is why local places are the best. It's also pretty cheap. Hit it up. There was a weird smell in the place but pizza was well worth dealing with it if you can't sit outside or take it home."}
{"text":"I tried pizza from Sauced at the Crocker Park Food Truck Challenge last Saturday - just a pepperoni and cheese pizza. there aren't many places in the area serving wood-fired pizzas in the area and i haven't had one since visiting my sister in Jersey 10+ years ago. The pizza was quite good. The pepperonis were crisp like i prefer. The crust was thin and crispy also. If I'm ever some place where Sauced is again, I'd try it again."}
{"text":"It's okay. Mostly a takeout place. We were only part at 8pm Saturday. Crust pretty good but not amazing. No beer. No table service. Kids ate pizzas."}
{"text":"Amazing!! We moved right near this place and needed quick food on our crazy move in day. This pizza was the best pizza I have had in a VERY long time. I totally recommend it, especially the Bourbon Chicken! We will be getting dinner from here way too often....!"}
{"text":"Surprise! Turns out that our favorite pizza at Cleveland's 2016 Pizza Fest happens to have a new restaurant within a mile of our house. My wife and I stopped in to grab some food and it was delicious! Will definitely be returning for some more of their great stone oven pies!"}
{"text":"Stopped in today (technically) before they were open to see if I could preorder for my daughters birthday party.  Even though it was prior to his \"starting time\" the employee couldn't have been more accommodating.  I ordered 6 large pies and a salad for pickup at 245.  I got there at 235 and they were just getting them in the oven.  Not only is the food outstanding but the service is unmatched as well.  The two employees that were there when I picked up were polite, knew the order, and were ready for me even though it was pretty busy when I got there.  Unmatched customer service combined with great pizza at a great price means repeat business.  Love sauced."}
{"text":"Loved Sauced. Good food. Friendly staff and quick. Quality ingredients. It's a new go to place for pizza in the neighborhood. Recommend this place to all pizza lovers!"}
{"text":"Loved this pizza!  The shop is super quaint and we loved the cute red chairs. Though we only ordered a small cheese pizza for my 2 grandchildren and me, they cut it into 6 pieces instead of 4 so we could each have two pieces. The size was perfect for our lunch since we had ice cream before the pizza from Dairy View across the street. The sauce was fantastic and had little bits of fresh basil in it, YUM!!!  It is very reasonably priced, too. I know I will be back again soon."}
{"text":"The pizza was just okay. To be honest the reason why I am even giving it 3 stars was the manager or I am assuming she was. They burnt my original order and had to make me it again. No one even acknowledged that it happened and all of a sudden the manager came up and offered me a drink and apologized for the wait. Mistakes happen and I understand. I was appreciative that she did her best to make it right. That was very good customer service. Sadly, I just really did not like the pizza. But five stars for the manager on duty tonight."}
{"text":"Very good pizza! Young guy at the counter with the beard was exceptionally nice. We were first timers and he welcomed us and went over how everything worked. We had a nice sized house salad with good toppings & fresh everything to start, then pizza came out fast. Nice beard guy was on top of silverware, plates and anything else we needed almost before we knew we needed it. Kids loved watching the pizzas being made. Dough is delicious. Only minor cons: a little too much cheese-which I never thought I would say in my life. Also, the lighting in this place is brutal. Felt a little like someone's back interrogation room. Very good service and tasty- just what we needed on a Friday night!"}
{"text":"Came in here not knowing what to expect as we are not from the area. We ordered the Margherita pizza and the pepperoni bread (I think) and it was so delicious!!! I love this place. They use real firewood and it smells SO good. Real pizza. The dough had such a great taste to it."}
{"text":"The white pizza is very good. Perfect amount of dough and cheese. Will definitely go back. Hope it gets enough business to stay open. Awesome new local pizza joint with friendly staff and quick service.  Update: got the pepperoni roll and caprese salad. Amazing!!!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place...had friends rave about the pizzas when they had the truck at their party, so we were excited to try it when they opened a restaurant...so here's the verdict: Decently priced, quick turnaround & excellent wood-fired pizza! There was a mistake with the salad I had ordered, but I figured it was a result of a bad cell phone connection on my end & wasn't upset about it. Then a little while after I was home with our order, I got a call from the restaurant apologizing about the salad mixup! They had a correct salad ready for me & even gave me free breadsticks to apologize! Service was above & beyond! We will definitely be coming back again & again!"}
{"text":"We've been a fan of Sauced Pizza Truck for years but only recently realized they had a brick and mortar restaurant as well. Went there for the first time and it did not disappoint. The place isn't huge, but makes good use of the space and one wall has garage doors, which were up to let the nice weather in. The staff was super friendly and kept joking around with each other and us, which helped create a fun atmosphere. Food was, as expected, outstanding and fast. My fiancé got The Godfather and I went with the White Ricotta, both of which were heavily loaded with toppings. The best thing about their pizza is the crust, which is the perfect blend of chewy and charred. Can't wait to go back again (and again and again) now that we know the restaurant is so close to us!"}
{"text":"I stopped into Sauced tonight after wanting to visit for quite some time.  When I arrived, I was the only one in the restaurant.  I had looked at the menu online, but was hoping for a bit of a refresher of what toppings they had for a build your own pizza, but unless I missed it-- I didn't see posted clearly.   I was kind of hoping for a super simple decision guide like similar woodfired pizza joints have.  i.e. choose your size, then your sauce, then your cheese, then your toppings.  Luckily, I knew generally what I wanted and went from there.  I ordered a small pizza with pesto, mozzarella, bacon, sausage, and prosciutto.    The pizza was made very quickly, which made it a great place to stop on a whim on my way home when I was craving pizza.  Not an order ahead and wait scenario (although you can order by calling or on the website.)  I took it home with me and noticed that the box was completely drenched and leaking out of the side and onto my car seat cushion.  When I opened it up, I saw how oily the pizza was and how their was oil pooled in that corner.  The pizza itself was great.  The crust is the perfect thickness.  Their pesto sauce is one of my favorites I've had on a pizza.  The entire package was delicious.  As far as taste goes, it is my favorite wood-fired pizza I've had.    My only negatives for the experience was the difficulty navigating the menu as a first-timer-- not knowing my topping, sauce, and cheese choices.  The oily, messy pizza wasn't ideal, but dripping through the box was a bigger disappointment.    I'll definitely be back for their pizza when I'm in the area, but will probably order ahead online so I can see all of my options clearly.  I'll also eat there or grab extra paper towels, etc. to prevent oily leakage in my car."}
{"text":"Who needs human interaction when you have this delicious creation called a s'mores pizza? Seriously ya'll, with one bite I knew I had met the love of my life last night. Sad news is that I could not stop with one bite and devoured the whole thing. By. Myself.  I guess the good news is that we created a food baby who is due any time now.   I discovered this place through Uber Eats and I really have nothing bad to say!  * S'mores Pizza $7 - amazing! Still thinking about this.  * Southwest Chicken Salad $8.50 - HUGE! And they let me add more veggies to it (cucumber and black olive) which I really appreciated.  * Homemade Meatballs $7 - Tasty, moist, and topped with tomato sauce, fresh ricotta cheese, and basil.  * Cheesy Garlic Bread sticks $6 - These were nothing special, but still good.   I brought some of the bread sticks and meatballs into work and once I heated them up I had several coworkers asking me what that wonderful smell was!  I would definitely order from here again!"}
{"text":"Yummy stuff! They have a wide variety of pizzas with different sauces. I was there a few weeks and plum forgot to do this earlier when I could remember the name of the pizza I ordered. It was a great recommendation by the gal at the register. I ordered the 10\", probably should not have eaten the whole thing in one sitting,  but it was so good. So glad I visited the area and found them. I love hole in the wall restaurants and this one did not disappoint. If I'm ever back in Cleveland I'll definitely visit them again."}
{"text":"This is an excellent independent pizzeria. There are many things that I've enjoyed about it: - helpful staff - modest prices - fresh ingredients  - clean facility The worst part is it's two hours from home! I would be a regular if it was near home or work.  Yummy"}
{"text":"Holy crap! This pizza is excellent. A+!!   Had the white pizza and it was amazing! $14 for like a 10 slice pizza, yes please.   Please try it for yourself!   Thank you!!"}
{"text":"The pizza is just great!   I'm willing to pay a couple. bucks more because the flavors are worth it!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to get pizza. Not only is the food amazing but the workers have always been so kind."}
{"text":"We had the Greek Goddess and a plain cheese pizza. Both were on point.   I appreciated that the staff warmed the pizzas for a brief moment in the wood fired oven when I arrived to pick it up. They were at the perfect temperature to enjoy when I got home. We will be back, so glad to have such good pizza close to home!"}
{"text":"Hands down top 3 favorite pizza places here in CLE. The speciality pizzas are loaded with good ingredients, very tasty and at a solid price."}
{"text":"It was so good.......go check it out.  You can pick your own toppings.  Would be nice if there's one close to Parma Heights"}
{"text":"I'm always in search of pizza nirvana, and I had read about this place here on YELP.  Pizza lovers rejoice!  I'm happy to report that this pizza is 'the real deal'!  Freshly prepared and wood fired in front of your eyes (in just a few short minutes), it tastes like a proper pizza should - fresh and flavorful!  This pizza uniquely tastes like a cross between the best New York style and oven fired. The crust is just the right thickness, while crunchy on the outside (but not burnt) and fluffy and airy on the inside.  The cheese and tomato sauce are of the highest quality.   My only minor suggestion would be to offer 2 types of tomato sauce, since the one they use now is like a 'Marguerita' sauce, with actual fairly large chunks of tomato.  I would prefer the same tomato sauce, but with the largest chunks taken out (which I did), for those like me that don't like that chunky style of sauce.  Lastly, I ordered the plain cheese and tomato pizza because i'm a firm believer that when tasting a new pizza, it's best to first taste a plain pie, since a properly made pizza should stand on it's own just plain, with no toppings to alter the taste.  'Sauced' is now in my Top 5 pizza places for all of NE Ohio!"}
{"text":"Wow. Wow. Wow.  I LOOOOOVE me some wood fired pizza. This place is small and unassuming but is BIG TIME in the game for best pizza in CLE. Freshest ingredients, delicious sauce, clean and bright space and friendly consistent service are just a few of the ups for this place.   The menu is just right. Starts off with several apps and salad choices GET THE PEPPERONI BREAD - best $6 app I've had in some time and would suffice for a medium sized meal for most. We got the house salad as part of a special one time and it was also generously sized and very fresh.   Specialty pizza options are fantastic - a little something for everyone here (white pizzas, traditional styles, and some more trendy ones as well). Our favorite so far is the Godfather - lots of meat and veggie toppings. So SO good. The crust is impeccable - hits the perfect amount of chew and char.   They also have some very unique dessert options. I don't even like dessert normally but the S'more pizza was one of the most delicious ones I've had. Definitely plan on sharing it with 2-3 others though as it's very good sized - especially since you just stuffed your face with a ton of delicious pizza!  If you like wood oven pizza, you NEED to get over to Fairview and try this place - you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"This place has awesome pizza and I don't say that too often in Cleveland.  So glad to have it on my side of my side of town too!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and great service, I like the variety of pizza pies that have here and how their pizza is not super thin. Tasty and fun environment with the patio being open so you can enjoy the weather"}
{"text":"After always getting Sauced at events with food trucks, I was so excited to see a brick and mortar store. My husband and I got it the other night for dinner and were very pleased. The sauce is really tasty and the pizzas are cooked well, not overly done/burnt like some brick oven places make them. Definitely a great pizza if you are in the Fairview Park area."}
{"text":"Found this place while looking for another pizza place in the area. Do not let it deceive you from the outside! The pizza is amazing! Fresh and perfectly made! Staff are welcoming and the price is good for the quality!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a Wood Fired pizza place and saw this one listed with great reviews. I was a walk in and had planned on taking to go. My order was taken immediately and I only waited 10 minutes for my pizza! It doesn't take too long with a 900 degree oven! They do not have a fountain soft drink machine so drinks are of the can and bottle variety. Cute place with roughly 10-12 tables and a single pick-nick style table right out front."}
{"text":"Good wood fired crust, picked up a couple of house specialty pizzas. The Southwest advertises cilantro, there is no cilantro to be found on this pie. Could not see it or taste it. I called to find out if it was left off and was told it was mixed in to the beans and corn. This pie would be 100% better with fresh cilantro on top. It would also could give it a real pop of color. Unfortunately the girl on the phone did not have any interest in the concern. The White pie is definitely not a repeater for me, it had the texture of baby food probably from the ricotta cheese."}
{"text":"Tasty pie cooked just the way I like it. Lots of sauce, slightly well-done, ample ingredients. A new under the radar place that has yet to disappoint. Highly recommend."}
