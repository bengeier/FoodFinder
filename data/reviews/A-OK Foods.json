{"text":"Decided to give it a second try after my first experience when they opened. It was conveniently close by and I dropped in and had the Sichuan chicken noodle ($10ish).   The texture of the noodles were great but the flavor was so intensely salty. You could slightly taste other notes but i was so immediately overwhelmed by the salt I lost my appetite. The noodles sat in the chili oil sauce and ruined the potentially refreshing summer dish.   I feel that if they just toned down their saying just a bit they'd have a more successful execution with the dish. Not looking forward to returning any time soon"}
{"text":"Overall it was just OK. Shoyu ramen was disappointing. Maybe I've been spoiled by the other ramen places, but I found the broth to be lacking in richness and flavours. Instead, it was one dimension with a bit of a herbal aftertaste to it :S The meat was bland but at least the noodles was fresh and chewy! Still, not worth then $10...   Only thing I really enjoyed was the Jamaica (?) ice tea drink lol it was very refreshing and addictive!! My brother especially enjoyed the bulgogi torta. I think it's a great simple sandwich filled with avocado and soft, fatty beef slices. The jalape√±o slices went perfectly with the sandwich."}
{"text":"I've been a ramen lover for decades long before the whole fad started a few years back. I remember being really excited when Kenzo first opened their door in Willowdale about 10 years ago and being disappointed with their mediocre taste. I remember being horrified by what Ajisan was passing as ramen.  I've tried them all. And while the places like Kinton and Momofuku is booming with their westernized version of Ramen, A-Ok stays true to how it's supposed to be done.  Some have complained about certain aroma of the noodle and the broth, but that's probably because they have never tasted ramen noodle made with kansoo (sp?) and broth with rich taste of pork. Momofuku's ramen is like Tim's coffee and A-Ok's ramen is like espresso. A-Ok's is much closer to authentic ramen it may be an acquired taste, but once you get it you'll agree that they are far better than anyone else in Toronto.  And don't get me started on over-salted broth and pasta noodle they call ramen at Kinton."}
{"text":"The gf and I went down on a Saturday afternoon, maybe around 3. When we got there, there were plenty of seats available. By the time we rolled ourselves out of there, the place was packed.   The place is delicious. The chef is attentive, the service is quick and hip, and the offerings are an interesting fusion of Asian and Latin American cuisine. The Brussel sprouts were my personal favorites. The bulgogi sandwich is an equally special dish. The Ramen dishes are on the lighter side, but made with the freshest ingredients.   Five stars for these guys."}
{"text":"High marks for fast and friendly service and a good atmosphere. I really really disliked the Szechwan ramen (the one you dip the noodles in). The concept is good but the flavour is just not there. The shoyu ramen was okay but nothing to rave about. We also tried the chicken wings which were decent (I liked the spicy dipping sauce they came with). I would like to try a few more things before dismissing the place altogether but I really wasn't impressed with the ramen. Edit: just talking to a friend who says when she went a few weeks ago and tried the same menu items, everything was fantastic- perhaps we just went on an off night?"}
{"text":"Restaurant: A-OK Foods Cuisine: Asian Location: Queen Street West Address: 930 Queen St W Price Range: $5~15  1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food: 4 Service: 4 Ambiance: 3 Overall: 4  Extra information:  * Closed monday and tuesday * Open for lunch * Menu changes constantly  A OK Foods is a newly opened snack and ramen bar by the owners of Yours Truly. If you read my post for Yours Truly that I visited a while back in year 2012 (Read my post here)- you would know that I wasn't the biggest fan of their food. However, smaller snack menu offered by A OK Foods did somewhat appeal to me and seeing couple tweets by a friend who visited the restaurant- fully convinced me that I wanted to give it a try. A OK Foods is located right next to County General if you have a trouble finding it, they don't have the largest or the brightest restaurant sign upfront.  I wasn't drinking that night so I thought I'd give Horchata (Mexican drink) a try and it tasted really watered down. I regretted ordering it for $3.50  Ordered: Shoyu Ramen 4/5  * Bowl of ramen with all the fixings for $10.50 * A OK Foods imported a special ramen machine from Korea and ages their noodles up to 3 days * Their ramen is the straight, chewy kind which I learned to like more so recently * Served with seaweed, green onions, eggs and meat * Honestly I wasn't even going to order ramen but my friend strongly recommended it * Soup is light with a lot of flavor and it wasn't overly salty which is an issue at couple ramen spots * Pork is not the usualy fatty kind you get at ramen joints but I did enjoy it * I was surprised by how perfect their eggs were! * They had the right consistency and it was bursting with flavor (egg God dances around) * I really enjoyed their ramen and would order it again  Ordered: Chino Wings 4/5  * Plate of 8~9 wings served Mexican style for $8.50 * They say Mexican, but I feel like this had very strong Chinese flavors * Served with lemon vinaigrette sauce on the side (like Phnom Penh Chicken wings) * It was perfectly seasoned on it's own and came piping hot * This can be quite salty if eaten on it's own, the Asian in me wanted some rice on the side  Ordered: Brussel Sprouts 5/5  * Plate of brussel sprouts served okonomiyaki style for $7.00 * This was one of the items that we ordered but I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did * It is served like takoyaki/okonomiyaki style with Japanese mayo and shaved dry fish, plus bacon! * Would be a good side dish to order for your ramen * This was so good, now I know how I like my brussel sprouts  Complimentary: Bulgogi Torta 3.5/5  * This is basically a Bulgogi burger with a mexican twist * Guacamole added creaminess to the burger (works as condiments just like ketchup and mustard) * Came with jalepeno and white kimchi on the side * I did wish there was something in the burger that could add texture because overall, it was a little mushy. * Bulgogi was well done, with just the right amount of sweetness which didn't overpower other ingredients  Complimentary: Ox Tongue Salad 4/5  * Served Mediterranean style with parsley, onions and side of pita bread * I didn't think the pita bread was necessary, but if you were having this as a meal it could work as carbs to fill you up * Salad has a lot of flavor on it's own and the tongue was cooked perfectly * Another solid dish!  Summary: Overall, I really enjoyed my meal at A OK Foods. Going in, I wasn't expecting to be wow'd with the food- but they def proved me wrong and I left fully satisfied. Snack menu is constantly changing but the price point is right on, or even on the cheaper side for the portion they serve. One complaint I have is their seating, all of the tables are communal tables which you share with others. I have no problem sharing the table with others, but the seats are so hard it hurts your behind after a bit, maybe that's their way of telling you this is not a lounging place? Nontheless, I will def be going back to A OK Foods!"}
{"text":"This is a great and authentic ramen shop. The bulgogi torta was excellent. Beautiful decor. High quality ingredients. Clean. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Had the dan dan (peanut sauce) noodles, wife had the shoya noodles and we shared their korean style wings.  Underwhelmed.  I had read a lot of hype about this place, but it was really nothing special.  Portions are on the smaller side for the price.  Had much better of both dishes elsewhere.  Won't go back."}
{"text":"Well, a 3 star rating on Yelp is equal to A-OK!  A-OK is a super casual snack place to have an indoor ramen picnic.  The place is tiny with communal picnic style tables, so be prepared to bump elbows.  However, it wasn't very busy when we dropped by here on a weekend.  There is a temperature controlled room where they make their ramen noodles in-house.  I like how there is a big window and you can see inside.  The Shoyu ramen noodles ($10.50) were decently good.  Noodles were straight and perfectly cooked and chewy.  The broth wasn't very rich and light in flavour.  You can drink the broth and not be overloaded by salt.  I would have preferred more pork belly though.  For snacks we shared: Brussel sprouts ($7): Bonito flakes on top of crispy and flavourful sprouts.  What a surprise!  Best snack item we ordered.  Chicken wings ($8.50): Spicy and greasy and yummy.  Bulgulgi beef torta ($7.50): It's a bulgolgi sandwich.  I wish they just used the word sandwich instead of torta.  Horchata ($3.50) - Fizzy, cinnamon soda! Strangely sweet and refreshing.  This place is A-OK!   But I'm not sure if I'd venture in here for noodles again.  Ramen noodle competition is pretty fierce these days. But now, I have an urge to re-visit Yours Truly."}
{"text":"The food wasn't anything to rave about. Got the Chino wings and the Ramen. First of all the wings were overly salty and left a numbing feeling on my tongue, probably from all the chili that's in it. The most i could eat was 2. I've had better wings where it didn't leave that odd feeling on my tongue..  The broth for the ramen was again (imo) overly salty and my friend thought the same as well. The noodles were okay but the pork belly was grilled and was yummy. I also enjoyed the crispy nori and egg.  I was not able to finish the soup due to the salt content."}
{"text":"Popped in on Friday Night for dinner with friends. There was a short wait, but it wasn't too bad (easy for me to say, I wasn't the one waiting!)  We started with three appetizers for the table. An order of the brussel sprouts, the slat cod inari, and the pork ssam lettuce wraps. The brussel sprouts were out of this world! Really!! You must try them. The pork lettuce wraps were delicious as well. The inari was nice, but it was my least favourite of the trio.  Three of us orders the shoyu ramen. It was good, the noodles had a lovely consistency, however I felt the broth slightly lacking in depth, and I did wish there were more toppings as I have had when eating ramen in Vancouver. A single nori cracker, piece of pork and half an egg. I wish there was a little more... stuff. My friend ordered the tsukemen bowl. It was really hot (spicy). Mouth numbing hot. It was interesting to try a bite of, but I'm glad I didn't order it. But for those of you who like very hot food, it might be fun to try.  The service was attentive, and the atmosphere friendly. You do have to share your table (communal) so perhaps not the place for an intimate date, but great for grabbing some grub with friends.  3 appetizers, 4 ramen bowls, and 4 drinks (wine and beer) came to just over $100."}
{"text":"I really do like the food here. Negatives for me are the uncomfortable seating and loud music (at least the last time we came). Apparently these guys are closing down (or have already closed)."}
{"text":"On a particularly rainy and cold night in Toronto, my friend and I braved the weather in hopes to have a delicious meal to warm our bellies and perhaps even lift our spirits. I wish I could say that, that was exactly what happened but in reality the truth could not be further from our expectations.   We sat down at A-OK with high hopes, saw the neatly written menu on the board and were intrigued with a few things. However, we decided to only order 2 items to test the waters first and then indulge in more items if the dishes impressed us. We ordered what was recommended, the KFC (Korean fried chicken) cute play on the acronym, however the appeals ends there. In many ways I wish it was the real KFC, all I have to say is Colonel Sanders would have been disappointed to have his famously fried chicken associated with this sad imitation of at best comparable to a Manchu Wok's General Tao Chicken that has been sitting out for a day. The aroma coming from the chicken was sour and unappetizing smelt of over use of vinegar and taste of ketchup and inadequate use of chilli sauce.  The second dish was the Sichuan Chicken. Not sure why it is called the Sichuan Chicken as it was mostly noodles and maybe odd few pieces of shredded chicken here and there. The noodles were a heaping portion of overuse of soy sauce, MSG and garlic. If you are looking to have a numbing sensation from eating too much artificially flavoured food using MSG than this is your go to dish, otherwise save yourself from drinking a gallon of water afterwards and spiking your sodium levels to unhealthy proportions.  Needless to say A-OK does not stand for the food, but perhaps the ability of the staff to sell their food so deliciously to hungry un-expecting diners, for that and only that reason gave them 2 stars."}
{"text":"Guess life isn't good enough for just a ok."}
{"text":"A-OK adds to the vast explosion of ramen joints in the city by doing things a little bit differently and definitely succeeds in doing so.    The short menu is written on a blackboard and divided as such: hot snacks, cold snacks and ramen.    Although they only have two types of ramen (shoyu and tsukemen), I must say that what A-OK is able to deliver in that steaming bowl is bursting with goodness and flavour.  The noodles are hand made and cooked to the perfect doneness - Soft yet chewy.  The broth is flavourful and the pork is tender.  Surprise, surprise you will find a sprinkling of goji berries on top for added colour and a conscious nod to the wonderful homey soups your Chinese mother always made.    For the ramen alone, A-OK deserves an appropriately yelp rating of A-OK but what separates it from the rest is the range of interesting and delicious snacks.    I sampled two of them: salt cod inari and chino wings.  A bit on the pricey side at $7 for two inari, it comes with a smear of creamy-oniony sauce on the side of the dish.   One bite of the delicious pillow of goodness and you will change your mind about the price.  The rice was of perfect texture and tasted wonderfully of salt cod and all the flavourings.  Yummy stuff!  The wings came battered,deep fried and sprinkled with with a green onion sauce with a kick ass spicy sauce on the side.  It reminded me somewhat of the Thai nam-prik pao but with an extra kick of szechuan peppers for added zest.  Really good stuff!  There are other snacky things on that menu and you can bet I will return time and time again to sample them all.  Great casual atmosphere, delicious snacky food and the best thing is that you dont have to queue for an hour to get your bowl of noodles."}
{"text":"We had the KFC Wings (Korean Fried Chicken) which were so nummy, not something you could make at home. 'Also had the Dan Dan Noodles which were much more delicious than anticipated.  The bean sprouts used were not bitter in the least which is what you usually get in a reasonably priced restaurant.  This a highly refined dish with complex flavours. Again, not something easily replicated at home.  We also had the gomae salad and steamed buns which were also very good.   This is an easy place to go to, casual, accessible with really good food.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I had the standard Shoyu ramen. It was good, but it was nothing to write home about. The interior decor is pretty meh, and same thing can be said for the service. Definitely not my favourite place to eat around this area."}
{"text":"Need to try all ramen in Toronto. So was reading a lot about this place beforehand so had to try it. Read about how the ramen is machine made with some custom machine from Korea. After making the noodles, it's stored in some wooden box for 3 days or something to age. I do think the noodles are a bit chewier.  The chicken broth, it just does not have the deep flavor that pork broth has. The pork had nice lines on then from the grilling and a half egg soft boiled.  Got there at about 7, there wasn't many people there. But the waitresses were super nice and explained everything in detail with a passion that you sense they really learned about the noodles.  I also read about this slat cod inari, sushi rice with salt cod and a tofu pouches wrapping it. I thought it'd be great but while the sushi rice tasted good, it was just a decent appetizer.  Overall, two Shoyu Ramens, one salt cod inari and a horchata (which if you've never had it at a mexican restaurant, is like rice water and some spices at bottom), about $38."}
{"text":"Went there a couple of weeks ago and food was terrible. Ramen was mediocre, the lettuce wraps were too salty and soy sauce heavy (any Chinese restaurant in Markham can make tastier wraps for half the price) and the horchata tasted like lavender soap. Chino wings were ok. Service was ok. But generally the restaurant was NOT ok."}
{"text":"A-OK offers a good quality meal and a refreshing interpretation of traditional noodle dishes. Everything tastes great and the prices are fair."}
{"text":"Rushed to this place an hour after it opened for dinner for the very first time.  Food: A bit lack-lustre. I think in it's indecision about what it wants to be (Chinese? Korean? Japanese? A bar?) it is nothing at all. The menu is designed for sharing between two people, except for the ramen. The shoyu (soy) ramen was a little wanting. Something was weird about the noodles: they tasted like buckwheat, soba noodles; not really like ramen at all. Those who like their noodles, thick or curly and with a little resistance on the tooth may look elsewhere. The pork belly in the bowl was very good and very fatty. It was at least on par with Kinton Ramen, but about 1/5 the portion. The broth was... forgettable. Best thing on the menu were the lettuce duck wraps (the proper Korean name escapes me right now) followed by the korean fried chicken wings. Pork skewers were incredibly dry, not very tasty and rather spicy (though I suppose some might like them that way). In general, I think one would do well to stick with the snacks over the ramen.  Atmosphere: I do enjoy communal eating under dim lighting! I also like old punk standards, played load enough that I can hear them but not so loud that I can't hear my company! These things are best accompanied by a hooch menu though...  Service: Quite brilliant, even after the place filled up. Someone was always on hand to take away a dish or make sure that everything was satisfactory. The servers were also willing and able to explain everything on the menu. Australian accents also featured heavily (always a positive).  Summary: I don't think a rush was necessary. This place does get a lot of things right and with a proper drinks card would be a VERY welcome alternative to the 40+ minute waits at 416 Snack Bar. But as I said above, I think it's trapped itself  between two good ideas and consequently done neither very well.  Prices: 2 bowls of shoyu ramen, 3 hot snacks, one beer, one non-alcoholic beverage came to $70 with tax and tip.  Side note: they DO have \"tsukemen\" ramen, which is currently all the rage in some circles in Tokyo (you get your ramen on the side and dip them in hot broth yourself). Worth a try. I personally do not like the concept."}
{"text":"A-OK is better than A-OK! (Sorry, I couldn't help myself)  Bad puns aside, I really like this place.  I came here for lunch because I was in the area picking up some Crookies and really didn't have any expectations at all.  Usually, I have strong preconceived notions about Neo/Fusion/Hipster Asian places because, more often than not, they suck; the food is usually white washed and retain 0% of the integrity of the original versions of the dish.  As an ethnic Asian myself, I have no problem going to a restaurant where the staff didn't speak english with funky decor because I'd rather have authentic food than a hip environment.  I ordered the Dan Dan Mein because I don't see it too often on menus other than in Northern Chinese restaurants.  When the food came, I immediately noticed that it did not look authentic.  Normally, these noodles come in a viscous peanut sauce based broth with firey red chilli oil.  The variation at A-OK was more like noodles coated in a sauce with with a lot of toppings that buried the noodles.  So I throught: \"Uggh...these punks messing with the food from my homeland!\", but when I actually took a bite, it was really good!!  All the familiar flavours were there and they put their own twist on it by using diced water chestnut which made it really refreshing.  The consistency of the sauce was great and I didn't feel super thirsty after my meal which I usually do from Chinese restaurants because of all the MSG.  The fact that I like restaurant really gives me hope about new school chefs and the evolution of Asian food in this city.  Authentic cuisine can be modified to be accepted by more people without compromising taste.  It's time to retire the chop suey and make way for new westernized Asian classics."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood restaurant with helpful staff, cool decor, excellent food and music and a great sake, wine and beer selection. We're just visiting but I wish we had something like this in our neighborhood back home."}
{"text":"Well A-OK really set themselves up for this A-OK 3 star rating, just saying...   I had been looking forward to trying A-OK since I heard that the masterminds behind my favorite Ossington restaurant, Yours Truly, were opening a ramen spot. Yours Truly has such amazing food, and ramen is so amazing at the best of times, I figured this had to be a match made in heaven!   Unfortunately, my hopes were up a bit too high and my visit ended in slight disappointment.   A-OK is a really cute restaurant. I love it's set up and the communal tables. It's perfect for a late night (or earlyish after elite event!) night, or for a lunch. Their menu is displayed over their front table (I want to call it the cash register but it was a sit down place...), and it has a good selection of noodle dishes and wings.   We got the two noodle dishes recommended to us - the peanut one and the one that potentially has the name Stephen in it? (wow I should start writing these down or drinking less!). While they were both good, I definitely was not blown away. Considering the amazing things that can happen at Yours Truly, I was definitely expecting an out of this world experience, and it was just... meh. Definitely good, definitely not great, if you know what I mean.   Fortunately the service was fabulous and the company was great, so that added to my experience. I will definitely give A-OK a second shot, with lower expectations, and see how it goes!"}
{"text":"Very good peanut noodles. A little pricier than chinatown ramen noodles. The pork buns were just ok"}
{"text":"When I think about how many times I have walked by A-Ok without knowing it was there, it both blows my mind and disappoints me horribly. I could have been enjoying this place ages ago. Luckily, blog-to's \"best ramen\" article got me wise and in a seat at this popular little place.   I only ate two items on my maiden voyage to A-Ok. The Shoyu Ramen was lovely. The broth was rich and not overly salty. The seaweed was beautifully toasted with sesame, and the noodles had a gorgeous al dente-ness to them that is crucial for me. The Goji berries added a little sweet bite to every spoonful that was lucky enough to get one in it. This is one of my favourite bowls of ramen in the city. And trust me, I've tried a lot.   I finished my visit with the 5 spice buns. While attempting to read and eat, I quickly learned that these are best tackled with two hands and full attention. They were hot, covered in spice and served with a bowl of whipped cream. I was in heaven. I don't think one person necessarily needs all three buns, but I ate them .... no, devoured them, easily.   I'm planning a trip back to A-Ok today. I'll let you know how it goes. ;)"}
{"text":"A-Ok Foods (@aokfoods) is bought to you by the same people of Yours Truly (see old post here) and I have been meaning to give it a try ever since. Finally made our way there on a Saturday afternoon for lunch. I just need to know if making their noodle in house with their imported Korean noodle machine do make a difference?!  Large window where you get to see where the noodles are made... would love to see it in action    Love the bright cafeteria benches. It seems using those Chinese plastic bowls and plates is the thing right now.  Shoyu Ramen $10.5 ~ Unlike the other ramen places, A-OK uses a chicken-based shoyu broth which is served with a sous vide pork belly, soft-boiled egg & sesame nori. ~ I have to say that I am very bias here since I like my milky pork bone broth (like the one here) since the chicken broth here somehow lack the complexity of flavors.  ~ The noodle had a rather dull color compare to the brighter yellow one we are use to seeing and it is due to the three day aging process which gave it a chewier texture that we really liked.  ~ And you can definitely taste the difference cooking the pork belly sous vide made, it was so moist, soft and packed with flavor  Sichuan Tsukemen $10.5 ~ Same ramen noodle paired with a dipping sauce made with black bean, Sichuan peppercorns (which gives you a numbing effect) and dried chillies. ~ I was surprise how much I like this given that I am pretty picky about my Sichuan cuisine that I love.  ~ The lack of flavor from the shoyu ramen broth is replace here by the yummy spicy numbing sauce and still get the noodles and pork belly that I love, so I will definitely order this again   Chino Wings $8.5 ~ This is suppose to be a Mexican style wings but I feel that it`s more Chinese especially served with the lemon vinaigrette sauce on the side. ~ I personally like it without the sauce since it was way to vinegary tasting to go with the spicy crispy wings. Love how it was served piping hot and super crispy, would love to come back and enjoy it with some sake or beer  Bulgogi Torta $7.5 ~ I just didn`t like this, the bulgogi was flavorful and moist but with the cheese and guacamole made the light bun way too soggy....  ~ just not good   Verdict : ~ Was pleasantly surprise that I fully enjoyed my experience here. ~ Will definitely come back for  Sichuan Tsukemen& Chino Wings ~ Will have to the salt cod inari next time since love it when I had it in Yours Truly. ~ Love the friendly service with our waitress checking back after every dish."}
