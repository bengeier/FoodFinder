{"text":"Nice, cheap diner food with a great, homie little vibe. Plenty of interesting people drop through all the time, and there's always good conversation.

The service is occasionally a bit slow when the diner fills up, but it's not usually much of a problem. The food isn't exemplary, but considering the restaurant's very reasonable prices, it feels like a deal.

I stop by a couple times a week, would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"\"I think if you're going to be in Pittsburgh, use Heinz ketchup (catsup)\" when I asked about alternative ketchup options (for reasons based on principal, quality concerns and questionable concerns regarding \"too big to fail\" companies that lobby for relatively concerning things impacting our lives in smallest and subtlest of ways).

Nonetheless, I am saddened that The Sandwich Shop is now closed. =/ The food was otherwise delicious."}
{"text":"If you're expecting some gourmet sandwich shop, then this is not your place. The Bloomfield Sandwich Shop is a late-night joint for the party crowd. The shop is rather small and if there is a line, you might be waiting for awhile. I didn't think it was worth the wait at first, but the the Philly cheesesteak that I got was disgustingly delicious! Sandwiches here are typical greasy drinking food, but the Italian bread used is excellent. 

I understand why some wouldn't find this place appealing. My circumstances were slightly different since friends of mine literally live across the street on Liberty Ave from the place. So I picked up the food when it was ready rather than waiting in the small dining room."}
{"text":"This has become another Bloomfield Institution.  It's a great place to get breakfast and they do serve lunch.  The hours are odd, so it's usually a breakfast or a late night weekend place.  The environment is very charming and warm.  It's a place you will run into your neighbors and other Bloomfielders and some interesting characters.  

The food is made with love and it shows.  The owners and staff are good people.  You can't go wrong.  The prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"I try never to miss at least going once a weekend.  Best breakfast in the 'Burgh."}
{"text":"AMAZING food. A cute mom and pop ambience. And bottomless coffee and tea! College student affordable and better tasting than any fancy coffee shop sandwich"}
{"text":"The only positive thing I can say is about this place it is open late.

We ate breakfast food at 2:30 am after the bars closed.
Pancakes were burnt. Hash browns were burnt. A breakfast sandwich had weird burnt meat on it. I was drunk I don't remember.

Bah. Cook/waiter was funny, so points for that.

Again, the only good thing was that it was open when I wanted food."}
{"text":"This place has the worst french fries I have ever tasted. They were literally BLACK. All I tasted was burnt oil. My photo is the zucchini planks and that lump of blackness are the French fries that I was sent home with. I could not even eat one! I also ordered the zucchini planks and a grilled cheese on rye with bacon. The grilled cheese was incredibly dry and the cook put the bread together upside down, like it did not match up...One piece of bread was the opposite way than the other. Also the sandwich did not stick together like a melted sandwich should. Ugh. The zucchini planks were delicious. 1 out of 3 is not great. My sister raved about this place. I am so disappointed. Disgusting. DO NOT EAT HERE. I spent $30 for only one edible thing worth $4. So pissed!"}
{"text":"I love heading over for breakfast, don't get me wrong the sandwiches are good too! There is just something about a fluffy stack of pancakes and the most perfect bacon to start of the day! Love love love!"}
{"text":"The mushroom swiss burger taste will make you swear your mother made it with lots of cheesy fungi love at home!"}
{"text":"Ate here this morning with my dad for breakfast. I've lived here over 3 years and have never been here but was glad I came. I ordered a veggie omelette which came with hash browns or home fries and toast and my dad got the spinach and red pepper skillet which had the hash browns already in it and toast on the side. The food and coffee were both awesome, but the waitress brought out our toast a good 5 minutes before our food came which was disappointing. I would definitely come back here to try their pancakes and lunch type of food. Cool interior decorations as well!"}
{"text":"This place has more heart than a cardiac surgeon's office, and more personality than the Meyers Briggs Test. Ba dum dum.

But in all seriousness, that's what makes this a five star review rather than a four. Mama Ros runs the shop along with her life love Mike, and she and he will treat you as one of their own kids (but, you know, in like a warm, life-affirming way rather than creepy).

Saying that they're not in it for the money would be an understatement. The food is great diner breakfast/lunch fare at extremely reasonable prices (and by \"extremely reasonable\", I mean that it's freaking cheap). Mama Ros and Mike really just want to feed you. They give food to the homeless, and every Thanksgiving they host a huge donation-based Thanksgiving dinner for all those who can't afford throwing a feast themselves or who can't be with their families during the holiday (or who would rather avoid being with their families in favor of the awesome Thanksgiving party that is Mama Ros's turkey dinner).

Great food, a business that's truly for the community, and a home away from home experience. Place puts a smile on my face every time."}
{"text":"I just want to re-review this place for being so near and dear to my heart in Bloomfield.

This is a really quirky breakfast spot (Seven C's in Bloomfield is also a must) that out of towners and locals alike should take a minute to enjoy.

I am not sure what the story of the owners is, but they seem to be ex hippies, and are always working tirelessly to provide simple and awesome food. 

This place is also great for people watching, with the late night crowd. Some of the punk crowd that was more than likely jamming at Howlers will be present.

Omelets, hash browns, fresh coffee, great sammiches- they always aim to please."}
{"text":"Need a cheap breakfast served to you by people that treat you like family as soon as you come in the door? This is your spot.

The food is solid dinner food. You will get a good meal at an excellent price, and probably a hug. The place is small, so if they are busy be prepared to stand and wait

It is what it is. A quirky place to grab a meal run by a really nice couple.

I would be remiss to review this place and not mention the free Thanksgiving meal the Sandwich Shop does for those that have no place to go, can't afford it, or are shut in."}
{"text":"I am beyond happy to finally review this sandwich shop.

I've been here only once and it's beyond memorable: It was a late night saturday around 2am and my two friends and I were on a search for late night foods. Matt suggested the Sandwich Shop with a description of a \"quiet, low key, good food atmosphere\" which was much preferable of any other options at that early hour. So naturally, we are hungry after escaping the hipsters of Remedy we are down for some regular chill.

We seat ourselves outside to wait out some of the crowd and drink the remainder of our 6 pack of PBR cans [remember we had just come from hipster/lawrenceville] when out of nowhere our simple pleasurable time is disturbed with the outbreak of a 10 person fight! [we got lucky because this is apparently unusual] -- there was even astonishment from the participants [\"REALLY? We are having a fight at the Sandwiche Shoppe????\" - yup pronounced that way]

Anyways, there was much scramble to break up the fight and not stub out eyes with cigarette buds and the chefs did quite a job at driving the trouble makers away. Surprisingly, no cops came checking anything out just drove along liberty ave.

Needless to say this delayed our now greatly awaited sandwiches which we received for free in the process. [we tipped very well that night] The guy making our food brought us our food and engaged us in a friendly chat for about 15 minutes [much needed to restore his nerves]. Also surprising, we were lucky enough not to be involved in this altercation. 

All together this was a great late night adventure, with dinner AND a show!!! Can't wait for the next visit."}
{"text":"How on earth haven't I reviewed this place before? It's really good. The coffee is always fresh and promptly served, and the owner, Ma Roz, is great about remembering you after a visit or two. It's a very family-type place, both in that lots of families go there to eat, and also that there's a familiarity that builds up very quickly. After I had my wisdom teeth out, this was the first place I went to eat once I could chew solid food again.

It's a dive diner, sure -- but it's genuine, unpretentious (*cough* Taste of Dahntahn *cough*), and they serve some seriously good comfort food. The homefries are yummy as hell, and the breakfast sandwich is ridiculously cheap for the amount of food you get in it. 

And definitely, I recommend eating at the counter. The people who work there are great to talk to. As others have mentioned, though, don't forget your cash."}
{"text":"best open late spot in Bloomfield. Because who doesn't want a cheesesteak at 3am?"}
{"text":"the waitresses are salty.
the food is mediocre (at best).
the place is a total dump.

however, it's open late, and the cook with the mustache is rad.  also, you meet the funniest people ever there."}
{"text":"Its a tiny, greasy hole in the wall and I love it. I went for breakfast when my band was on tour, and the prices are small touring band-friendly! Breakfast isn't really hard to do, but I hadn't had anything that resembled home cooking in a while and I needed this place. This is now a must for anytime I'm in town."}
{"text":"While in Bloomfield on a recent Sunday afternoon, I was in search of a new lunch spot. i pulled out my handy Yelp app and found out that there is not much open on a Sunday afternoon in Bloomfield with the exception of a few Asian restaurants and the sandwhich shop. The reviews looked good, why not give BSS a try. Baby in tow, I walked over in the heat and called a friend to meet me there. When I walked into BSS, I froze in terror. How is it possible that all of the reviews do not mention that this place looks like it hasn't been cleaned since it opened. Yikes. The floors were a mess, the chair cushions were torn and the staff don't seem to even notice nor do the customers. That may have something to do with the food but more on that later. I was pleasantly greeted by an older woman, Ma Roz I assume. She sent someone in the back to dig out a highchair and specifically asked him to clean it. Well, it came out about half clean with some hairs on it. Nothing wet ones couldn't handle. My friend arrived shorty and she was just as shocked as I was. Well, I was committed at this point so we were going to give it a try. We both decided on breakfast. I ordered the pancakes with a side of bacon. There are some interesting pancake mix ins to note such as marshmallow, thin mints and chocolate chip cookies. I decided to go with peaches and blueberries. It didn't take long for our food to arrive. My pancakes looked incredible though they were missing one thing, whipped cream. Not a problem, they easily remedied that situation. I took my first bite and ta da! The light bulb went on. I suddenly understood why locals would keep coming back to this place despite the decor- if you want to call it that. They quite possibly could have been the best pancakes I have ever eaten. The fruit was fresh. That's right, FRESH peaches. Not canned stuff like you might assume for a small establishment such as this. The bacon was also cooked to perfection. They definitely know how to do it right here. And the prices were very reasonable. $4.50 for 3 pancakes, or should I say heaven cakes, and only $.50 a mix in.  I think they may only accept cash here so, you may want to head to the ATM first. Although, I was shocked and quite honestly, taken aback by the decor of BSS, I was also blown away by the quality of the food. If they sunk a little money into cleaning, fixing the uneven floor and replacing the chair cushions this place would be top notch and easily deserve 5 stars."}
{"text":"I love this place!

It's not fancy, it's a little corner diner but their coffee is very good.  Better than some of our local coffee shops even.  Their breakfast is much better t"}
{"text":"I have walked past the Bloomfield Sandwich Shop a million times, but I never tried it.  I assumed it was a greasy and dive-y sandwich place, which is typically not my scene.

After talking to Laura M., I decided to come here for breakfast with my family.  I was shocked at the low prices and even more shocked by the beyond friendly owners.  Customer service here is clearly a top priority, and these owners should be applauded for their awesome attitudes.  On top of that, the store has a very wide-range of hours.

I ordered a bacon, egg, and cheese bagel, but I was quickly jealous when my dad's sandwich came out on homemade Italian bread!  All of the meals were cheap and good.

The only caveat is that on a hot day, the inside of the Shop is stifling hot.  We enjoyed the outdoor seating, though.  I will definitley be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place, and I can honestly say that I find myself missing it, now that we no longer living in walking distance in Lawrenceville.

The sandwich shop is not glamorous, but you're not going to eat there for glamour. You're going to eat there because you can get an enormous plate of breakfast and a bottomless cup of coffee for around $5. 

Ma Roz will always make you feel at home, and she'll remember you after your first or second visit, so that every time you come back, she greets you with a, \"Hey, where have you been?!?\" motherly scolding. 

The food here is greasy, but it's delicious. Expect to hear some good music, too (Bowie, Creedence, the Dead). In the wintertime, you can warm up by sitting at the counter across from the grill and watch your sandwich come to life in front of you. Just remember, it's cash only.

If you're coming in for lunch, and not breakfast, I recommend the fish sandwich. It's of Lenten church fish fry quality, flaky and greasy and crispy all at once. Yummy. Just uh... don't come here on a day when you want to eat healthy. Come here for a hangover brunch, or a late-night-prevent-a-hangover snack. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"When Ritters doesn't tickle your fancy I find the Bloomfield Sandwich Shop a great substitute for a decent burger or some late night breakfast. The small interior is enough for a handful of late night munchers. But keep in mind one cant be super picky here. There is no I want it that way or this way. The way they serve it up is pretty much the way they serve it up. Be lucky that you have the option of late night dining. Which is few and far between in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"One Saturday afternoon after a night filled with alcohol and a terrible nauseous feeling, i decided to walk to Bloomfield to head to the pool. i was so hungry and was looking for a pizza shop, but noticed Ma Roz's first. 

I was so excited to have some breakfast even though it was going on 2pm! It was delicious and all the greasiness it needed to be. 

While waiting, I chatted with one of the cooks and another person next to me. Everyone was super friendly. I'm glad I noticed that they are open late-night on the weekends.. gonna have to check it out!"}
{"text":"Awesome Awesome Awesome lady.  She will make your food the way you want it.  She is such a sweet, kind, compassionate person.  The food portions are large.  Definitely worth the price.  

I am not a breakfast person but here..... I am.   I love the 60's Hippy Look that this place has.  

Mike and Ros are definitely two of the nice people on earth.  

Ros will make your meal the way you want.

The portions are beyond HUGE!!!!!

This is a tiny place that seats 18 inside.

On nice days there are two tables outside.

Don't let the workers with all their many body piercings, and freakin' awesome tattoos, and awesome hair turn you away.  They are the sweetest staff that I have ever met.

  I get the best service here.  More so  than any 4 or 5 star dining place."}
{"text":"I stopped by yesterday for brunch with CM around 1pm.  I'd passed the Bloomfield Sandwich Shop countless times on my bike, and had often wondered about the food and the clientele.  When a friend cancelled alternate brunch plans with my on Fri., but I was still craving breakfast food, the idea occurred to me to finally check this place out.  I'm very glad that I finally did, given the sandwich shop provided me with one of the most memorable brunches I've had in PGH.

This place is the definition of a hole-in-the-wall--it's very small inside, so expect to get cozy with the owners and other customers during your visit.  In true diner style, CM and I opted to sit at the counter.  Indeed, space was at such a premium that at a couple points, one of the owners placed dirty plates on the counter a bit closer than I'd like for a minute or two before proceeding to clean them.  As for the decor, the best way to describe it is flower child kitsch, with a dash of sports (indeed, surprisingly, the paper placemats contained sports trivia).  You really do feel as though you're in the owners' kitchen when you're here.  CM described it as organized chaos, which I thought was quite apt.

As for the food, as far as I can tell, the sandwich shop offers the most inexpensive breakfast in PGH (aside from McD's, etc.)--everything on the menu is $5 or less, and the portions are generous.  Despite this, as others have mentioned, the quality of the food is quite good--on par with, if not better than, Pamela's, and leaps and bounds above EnP.  CM ordered a hobo cake, a breakfast sandwich consisting of eggs and cheese between two pancakes ($4.50), with bacon (+ $1.25), and I ordered the short stack of pancakes ($4.25) with Nutter Butter cookies and chocolate chips (+ $1.00).  Both entrees were delicious, and very satisfying, not to mention filling.  (In fact, CM fell into a carb coma shortly after going back to his place.)

Although the food and prices are great, what really makes eating at the sandwich shop a real experience is the owners, Mike and Mama Ros.  Mike, who waited on us, has a great sense of humor, joking with us and making us feel like family from the time we walked in the door to the time we left--and even afterward (he greeted us again when he and Mama Ros were taking a break at the outside tables as we walked past on our way back to the car after taking a short walk).  From talking to him, we learned that he and Mama Ros have run the sandwich shop for 15 years (impressive!), and that he lived in San Jose, CA prior to moving to PGH.  We didn't get to talk to Mama Ros much, because she was working the grill at the time we were there and it was quite busy, but they both seem like great people.

Needless to say, we had an awesome first experience at the Bloomfield Sandwich Shop, and look forward to returning for more.  While I'm tempted to award 5 stars, there were a few minor shortcomings on the food front (use of boxed pancake mix, lack of maple syrup), and the chaotic atmosphere may not be for everyone.  Having said that, if you're looking for cheap and plentiful portions of basic diner fare done well served up by friendly owners, check out this neighborhood institution--it won't let you down!  4.5 stars."}
{"text":"A great option when there are no other options.  If you find yourself devastatingly hungry in Bloomfield at 3am to drunk to drive or walk ANYPLACE else, sure, go for it.  Otherwise, take a pass- your insides will thank you in the morning.  The times I have eaten here have induced self loathing  of the worst kind..  the only thing worse are the stomach cramps brought on as a result- but I was drunk and it seemed like a good idea at that moment."}
{"text":"If you're into diner food and unpretentious plates, then this is the place for you. (And me, and everyone alike.)

The Sandwich Shop doesn't look like that much from the outside but the warmth and atmosphere that Mama Ros and Mike put into it, is something amazing. 

Just had some coffee, and a modest plate of over-easy eggs with rye bread--but the eggs were cooked perfectly and the coffee great. If I remember correctly, you can customize your pancakes etc... Yes. A million times yes.

I'll be sure to pay Mama Ros a second visit if I'm ever in Bloomsfield again. So should you."}
{"text":"I was looking for a quick bite after an early morning work out and took a chance based on the yelp reviews. This place is a gem. \"Mom\" is a typical short order chef with years of experience under her belt. The food was hot, fresh and simple and the coffee was surprisingly good. Even though it is clearly a locals place (four people came and went whose food came without ordering it), the owner couple were welcoming and chatty. I heard all about their thanksgiving. They were closed Thursday and Friday to serve or deliver 300 meals to the needy in their community. 130 deliveries and others picked up. The community supports them financially but they cooked for nearly two weeks to make it happen. 100% gratuity well deserved. Keep it up mom!"}
{"text":"I've experienced better sums it up.

The sign says it, the looks of this place are not the best.  The finishes, the countertops, and it extends to the attire of the staff.  Little attention was paid to any of those things or to the atmosphere created.  The place has potential to be cute and quirky.  Instead what I remember most are the recycled store bought tubs on the shelves, such as large Parkay butter tubs - to hold the prep through the day in the refrigerator.  Meh.

The food was good.  I've had better.  I've had much worse.  It was clean in here, a clean grill, clean plates, and a clean work surface.  But I have had better and expect more than cleanly prepared food.

The price was very reasonable - inexpensive and affordable.

I don't think I'll be back as I'd rather try some other place and take my chances than to just have okay food again here."}
{"text":"The food is good, not great. But the portions are bigger than we've come to expect and the pricing is awesome. I wish there was a 3.5/5 option because it'd fit a bit better for me.

BIGGEST TIP: DO NOT believe the hype. Go in expecting nothing and form an opinion off of that. My friends talked it up so much I almost couldn't help but expect to be blown away and I wasn't, which made it a little disappointing for me.

Also, B.O. is a thing down there. Don't let anyone tell you different. Not always, not everyone, but beware."}
{"text":"Philly steak sandwich was fresh and delicious. Friendly service. I would definitely recommend for a quick lunch in Bloomfield."}
{"text":"Lovely people! Great coffee! I mean great!!
Down to earth, marvelous food.. Pancakes are f*king awesome!! As big as your plate."}
{"text":"Friendly, fast, the prices are fantastic. It's the definition of town diner. Can't wait to come back and try everything else. Also they have grits, that's all I needed to know."}
{"text":"Mama Ros's (sic) is a great place to eat late at night or early in the morn. They have weird hours, weird cooks, weird customers, and great food. 

The price is great and the silver dollar pancakes are soooo good."}
{"text":"Small independent diner run by a hardworking couple. Good diner food and a great friendly, welcoming atmosphere.  The owners really appreciate their customers and strive to please them."}
{"text":"This place is a nice hole in the wall to eat at. We went there for lunch to eat sandwiches (hence, the name) but everyone else was still eating breakfast so it must be pretty good. It's small, but it's tasty and the people there are super friendly! It's places like this that make me love Bloomfield."}
{"text":"Don't let the outside fool you! My girlfriend used to live in Bloomfield and we discovered it by just walking in looking for something cheap. The place is tiny but it doesn't matter because the food is good and the portions are big and most importantly it's cheap. I always got the $3.95 breakfast at least I think it was $3.95 all I know is it costs less than $5 for a meal. The staff are friendly and you don't wait long for your food. Wish I could go more often but I can never remember the hours as they are open later at night than during the day."}
{"text":"Great food fast service great price. The local friendly atmosphere is everything you love in a place like this. Not the best looking atmosphere but you can not beat the friendly staff. My goto quick bite place in Bloomfield"}
