{"text":"I had shrimp on angel hair pasta. It was really delicious. My husband had the closer. A fried chicken burger. He said it wasn't what he expected and it was too much breading. My 2 boys both enjoyed their meals. The waitress was attentive and friendly. It was not crowded for a Sat."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would. Easily one of the worst meals I have ever had .
Went there today right after the Illusionists show today and the food is awful. I ordered the gnocchi and a friend of mine a ramen bowl, both were horrible.  I really wish I never listened to the kids and went somewhere else in the first place.
The service was ok and people friendly, but the food was plain awful."}
{"text":"Pretty bad service. The waitress(s) were more concerned with counting their tips than seeing beer. Atmosphere was good but service was not."}
{"text":"First of all my Stella was not filled up to the line. It looked like half the glass and I hate sending food/drink back.

And, I think the idea of hiring all really young girls as servers and making them wear revealing dresses is not helping the business unless they are good servers. At least hire 1/2 experience Man/Woman and the other half department store mannequins. So, you know, the real servers can make up for the mannequins."}
{"text":"A few of my coworkers and I were in Toronto for a conference and had the worst experience. The waitress was not the sharpest knife in the drawer. My colleague asked for a glass of sauvignon blanc and the waitress had first asked if it was beer or wine... then asked if it was white or red. She had no knowledge of the menu and forgot to mention they were out of some menu items. She also forgot to bring out half of our drinks. 

My other colleague had asked for a hamburger to be cooked medium. Since majority of us were from New York, we were unaware that apparently meat/burgers get cooked all the way through.  However, that's not our problem we didn't know that. The waitress snapped back and said \"Are you American... i can tell. We don't do that\" and moved on the next order. She was very snappy and essentially failed to explain the reason. Our colleague from the area did explain it to us. It wouldn't have been a problem, except the waitress was extremely rude about it and could have been more polite. Especially to a group who was prepared to spend a good amount of money.

After that, a manager came over and informed us that the gas line stopped working so all of the food we ordered was not going to come out. The manager did nothing whatsoever to compensate us to for this inconvenience. No discount on the bill, no round of drinks, nothing for our next visit (even though that probably wasn't happening anyway), nothing. All he did was apologize and didn't seem phased.  Oh and then the waitress came over and asked US if something was wrong with the kitchen. I'm sorry, but that's your job to know that, not the customers. 

After looking at the other reviews, it sounds like the food is decent, but this review is based solely off the customer service.... which was terrible. Next time I'm in Toronto, I will definitely be skipping this place."}
{"text":"We've been to a number of Shoeless Joe's in a few different cities, and it was \"decent\" for what you can expect for this kind of place. They have chicken fingers that I used to really like, with their buffalo butter sauce. You get about 6 of them, with a big pile of fries. They recently seem to have changed the chicken fingers though, and they're clearly not made the same way, so it's gone downhill. Yesterday I wasn't feeling well, so I ordered their chicken fingers for delivery from a Toronto location through OrderIt. I paid $15 for the chicken fingers, my husband ordered a pasta dish for $17, and I paid 7$ for delivery. When it came, my THREE chicken fingers were clearly just lightly drizzled with a standard BBQ sauce (not coated in any way in the buffalo butter sauce I ordered), I had quite literally 10 french fries, and there was a hair in them. It was gross and not even correct - I'm only here for the buffalo butter sauce, after all. My husband called Shoeless Joe's to ask about the situation, and he was put on hold for 20 minutes, only for the person to come back and say that if we came into their restaurant, we could have a chicken fingers order for free. So if we came in person, we could have what we already paid for and nothing else - no refunds, not even for the delivery fee. He told them we weren't happy with that at all, it really isn't a solution and they didn't seem to care about the poor quality of food that came from their restaurant. They said the general manager would call us back, but they never did. It probably doesn't seem worth it to get upset about chicken fingers from a place like this, but it's the principle of the matter - what awful food and service is this chain comfortable with? Fails all around, and obviously we're never going back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were looking forward to enjoying the raptors game and some food. I was at another shoeless joe's for dinner the week before and had such a great experience I was craving some lattice fries and decided to bring my boyfriend to check it out. The bar at this location is huge with great views of televisions and a good atmosphere. However, the service and portions we received inspired me to get a yelp account to write this review. We ordered, to share, their all star platter (which i had the week before and really was looking forward to) and the wing (medium) and rib (smokey bbq) dinner with a side of lattice fries.  After ordering, the waitress came to tell us that they were missing the crab dip from the platter. We stared at her assuming she was going to present a solution to the problem. Instead wanted to know what else we wanted. We suggested making a substitution to the platter as there were many more items on the platter that they had and we wanted. She didnt seem to fond of that idea and went to check with the kitchen. Came back to say they could give more of one item, calamari. Then after waiting an extroardinary amount of time (we did realize it was game day and busy!) we received our platter and a plate of wings with smokey bbq sauce and lattice fries (wrong!). Our platter was a ridiculous small serving size for 25.00, remember, i had just received the same thing at another location last week. Probably a third of the size. The waitress apologized for the mistake but didnt seem to care. And when we sent back the wings the sauce was taken with it and never returned back with the correct plate. We were there a total of 2 hours and disliked the entire experience, a 2 rating is generous considering the atmosphere is great and maybe other servers would have been accomodating. But our server, her lack of service and uncaring attitude about customer experience and the rip off of the food servings made for a terrible afternoon."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with a group of coworkers. We were seated in a fairly secluded area at a large rectangular table that would fit about 12-15 people, which was perfect for our group. The menu had a decent variety of food, ranging from salads to wings to pasta and more. I ordered the baja fish tacos and they were pretty good. I was surprised at fish in the tacos - the proportion of fish to taco to other toppings was just right and the fish batter was nice. The service was ok, we had to wait a while our food, but that's expected for large groups. 

Overall, this is your typical sports bar, with decent food, ample seating and lots of TVs. Would have given this place 4 stars but there was a noticeable smell of cleaning products throughout the restaurant..."}
{"text":"I'm not usually interested in chain sports bars, but I've been impressed with Shoeless since it opened across the street from my office earlier this year. They might be getting an extra star just because the predecessor at this location was so awful, anything is a massive improvement, but sometimes that's the way things go.

For a quick lunch Shoeless usually provides average service and above-average food (and by \"average\" I'm referring to what you would expect to get at a chain sports bar). I've had a few of their burger options and a few of the wing flavours and I've been happy with everything.

The draught options are pretty disappointing, although they do have Guiness, a favourite of mine.

I've also been to one party that we threw in the back VIP section and it went very well. It's a comfortable area with lounge chairs, a big TV, a Wii, access to the pool tables, and dedicated servers. We had several appetizers that were all as-expected. It doesn't cost anything to rent the space (or, at least, it didn't when we had the party shortly after they opened), which is always a bonus.

Maybe comparing to all of Toronto it's more of a 3-star, but you should know what you're getting when you go to a place like this. Based on lowered expectations, I think a 4-star is appropriate."}
{"text":"ordered

-mushroom and spinach flatbread 2/5 (lacked flavour immensely! I had to drown my flatbread with Frank's hot sauce for some flavouring. The ingredients were also pretty much non-existent)
-vegetarian burger (my friend really liked it) 
-chocolate cake 
-chocolate chip cookie (disgustingly sweet, claims to be freshly baked but my cookie was ROCK HARD) 1/5 

Overall, this is one of those places that you'd come just for the games and drinks, but in terms of food i'll save my money and go get street meat instead"}
{"text":"The only reason I tend to come here on occassion is for the TVs. It's a good place to watch a game, but the food and drinks are awful. Beer selection is limited and all tastes skunky. The food is bad bar food but the burger is edible if you're really hungry."}
{"text":"I have never been treated so rudely before in any service based establishment ever.  I walked into a deserted Shoeless Joe's and mentioned to the clueless manager/ Owner that I just wanted to have a drink at the bar.  I sat at a table, when said manager comes up to me and asks if he can help me.  I said, could I please have a pint of Canadian, to which he retorts with \"well you didn't say anything, you just walked in\" to which I replied \"I'll just walk out then\". He then claims \"oh no, it's okay you can sit there\". Naturally I got up and left. There is absolutely no way I would ever spend a dime in this Shoeless Joe's; which to my knowledge should be a properly run chain restaurant.  Ironically this person was playing the role of \"greeter\" when really he just served to make me feel unwelcome.  Hosting and interrogating are interchangeable in the place.  If this is the norm for how guests are treated, it's no wonder the place is empty."}
{"text":"The ratio of of bad to good reviews is deceiving. 
I can honestly say I have never had an issue here. Everything is above average. 
The atmosphere is great and the service is satisfactory, consistently. This place is HUGE. If your beer takes 10 minutes to arrive it's probably because it simply takes that long for them to walk over to a computer and order it, and then walk all the way across the restaurant, in HEELS by the way, and deliver it. 
So give those poor girls a break."}
{"text":"Sports bar & pub food. Only here because it's a business lunch and the client requested it. Ordered the grilled balsamic chicken with no potato and extra steamed vegetables ($16.99). Advertised as 2 chicken breasts with a balsamic cream and roasted vegetables: received a small chicken breast, cut in half which was \"blackened\" my waitress explained which is (supposed to be) different from burnt.  The vegetables were previously frozen and steamed.  

The burger and fries look safe ($12.99) and the Astoria Salad ($12.99) is passable as long as you ask them to hold the sickly sweet mandarin from a can dumped all over it. 

Wings & beer is what they're good at, don't front by ordering \"healthy\" as I did. 

Note: freezing, they need the heat up, free wifi, clean bathrooms, scantly clad waitresses (which, sadly, means the staff stand there shivering, which perhaps is the point.)"}
{"text":"Deceiving, to say the least.  Food was eatable, but way overpriced! I had the lemon chicken quinoa bowl, the quinoa was simply tasteless. As a starter, we had one of those super plate that we share, taste was good, but the price wasn't justified.  Generally speaking, plate presentation was poor.  Service was ok."}
{"text":"Went to this place because I love the one by the Docks. I went with my family and we were seated at a great seat. It was in the early afternoon, so the place wasn't packed. 

As plenty of waiters and waitresses walked by our table, the four of us sat there for about 13 minutes without any service. That's when I stood up and asked the woman who sat us if there were any problems with our server. She wasn't sure, so she went into the back and checked. She then walked by our table and said that someone would be with us within two minutes. 8 minutes went by and no one came, so we stood up and left.

The end."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, once with my gf after work and once more with a couple of coworkers during lunch. Both times got what I expected with decent service.

The thing that I like about the place is that there is always room. Other similar places like Jack Astor's tend to get really crowded around key times (lunch, happy hour), but this place always has room. I don't know if this is a good sign, but works for me. 

Most of the negative posts here had bad experience with service. I was really fine both time, seated right away and the waitresses were with us right away. Never waited too long for food... so fine from this perspective.

The portions are relatively large but their food tends to get a tad greasy (excellent if you crave some junk food without stepping in a McDonald's). Had calamari, nachos and a fish sandwich in my times there. Never a bad meal. 

I guess the place is not 5 stars because it doesn't offer anything out of the ordinary, but whenever I go there I get what I need. I guess I was lucky with the service compared to other patrons..."}
{"text":"Truly disappointing.

Food: lackluster everything microwaved or deep fried.

Ambience: loud, like eating in a frat house

Staff: dumb and all dressed like whores."}
{"text":"I guess I HAVE to give it at least one star eh. I wish I read these reviews before we went! Ive been to many shoeless joes and LOVED it, this one, however, was an exception! The waitress was alright, till we actually needed something; Like sending our food back. The buffalo strips were burnt (didnt even know this was possible), they were crunchy like a crouton. They were also cold, not even luke warm, just cold (which is odd, because we waited such a long time for them). I was so hungry though that I couldnt be bothered to send them back (we had just come from a 14 inning baseball game.. we would have eaten scraps from the garbage we were that desperate for food)... My boyfriend had some greek wrap and they didnt put and tzaiziki on it. the best part of my meal was eaten the last scrap of wrap off my boyfriends plate when he was done!!

We never actually got a bill! After 30 minutes of waiting for one, and not being able to locate our server or a manager, we did the math ourselves, added the taxes, paid cash and left.

I thought the atmosphere and set up of the restaurant was exceptional..its a shame everything else was so disappointing! We had a hard time paying because we left the restaurant hungrier than we arrived. I do not recommend this place at all! I will have to think twice before heading to another one again."}
{"text":"Ive been there a few times. This review reflects my most recent visit during end of summer this year. The service/food seems to have dipped in quality over last few odd months. It took a few minutes to get a server to our table of 2 even though it was a quiet wednesday night. Beer was served immediately however food took nearly half an hour (again I  can count on one hand how many people where in the bar at that time 7pmsh). Parts of the meal where stale (quinoa) and other parts were greasy (weird for a club sandwich). Server forgot to ask us if we needed a machine and was gone for over 15 minutes. I had to ask for another server to fetch her attention again until she remembered us (and then gave us attitude for asking where she was). Def wont be visiting again."}
{"text":"This is the gigantic sports bar downtown that everyone forgets about. So that has to say something."}
{"text":"Big TV,  UFC, good music and beautiful people. What lse you want from bar. I am not sure about food or service. I am sitting at the bar so fast service."}
{"text":"I am giving this a four star just because for the location, this place is never cramped. The first time I came here, it was a Friday night, so I was expecting the usual bumper to bumper human traffic, loud I-can-barely-hear you, rowdy type of bar establishment. To my surprise though, this location is HUGE and expansive with sections for the bar and dining room area. The first time I came here, I sat at the bar with my friends and tv's surrounded us which mean we could watch any sport that was on during the night. Service was very friendly and we couldn't ask for anything more.

Tonight, I went here again with my bf and we sat in the dining room area with booths aplenty. Each booth has their own tv, but channels are limited to sports related. I think this is a great place to meet up for drinks, and because it is right in the heart of the entertainment district, the location is unbeatable! This place is so big that there are always seats. So, before or after an event, you can bet that this Shoeless Joe's will always have an opening for you!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday night for a book club. We've been here before and the food and drink is average, while the service is usually pretty good. Tonight we decided to go with the Sang-Rita, and it was absolutely awful. Like a non-alcoholic lemonade/simple syrup heartburn inducing nightmare. Don't bother With chains, unless you like mediocre food and terrible drinks."}
{"text":"I have gone to a couple of Shoeless Joe's before and they have always been great, good food and good service. This one however..... not great. I have been to this location twice, the first time was god awful and the second time we only went because it was close by and late, it ended up being okay that time (nothing spectacular, just decent). For this review I will be focusing on our first visit. 

We went here for a dinner because we received some coupons in the mail. When we arrived there were very few people in the place so we figured service would be quick. Wrong. They had 2 waitresses working and ours took an excessively long time to come take our drink order. In fact the manager noticed how irritated we looked that he had to come and take our drink order (he looked just as irritated as we did for us having to wait), he did offer us a free alcoholic beverage for the wait so that was nice. We also ordered our appetizer and dinner at this time.

After he left I am assuming he went and spoke to our waitress and she finally came over to make sure her manager took our order. We said yes and she left. We got our drinks shortly after but then, again, we waited an excessively long time for our food order to come. Finally after about 30 minutes our food showed up, which was brought out by the manager and not our waitress. 

The food was nothing special, I ordered a wrap and really didn't enjoy it very much but that wasn't what bothered me, I was completely irritated by the horrible service from our \"waitress\". I could see her waiting on everyone around us but not once came over to see if we needed refills or to check if our food was okay. She likely just assumed her manager was taking care of us even though it was clearly her job to do so and not her manager. Finally we had to stop her and ask her for a drink refill. She said she would get it but had an expression that looked as though she was confused as to why we asked her or as if she was too busy. 10 minutes later, no drink. My boyfriend ended up getting up to go to the bar and get me one. 

Finally when it came time to pay our bill, guess what? Again we waited to get this girls attention, Finally she came over and we told her we wanted to pay, she said she would go ask her manager to see what the plan was with our bill. She clearly knew we were pissed. She came back and said her manager said our entire dinner was free. We were happy with this as the service was completely unacceptable.

Basically if you want to go to a Shoeless Joe's I would avoid this one. The only good thing I have to say is that the manager was the only helpful person during this entire scenario so we appreciate that. The waitress however, AWFUL."}
{"text":"There's really nothing to recommend about this chain sports bar aside from maybe the location, but even then there are many better places in the area.

I had the bacon and pepperoni pizza, which was very mediocre -- no flavour at all. I was also disappointed by the short list of beers on tap.

The bar itself is a large basement space with little atmosphere. The service was friendly but slow."}
{"text":"Food: 3/5
Drinks: 3/5
Service: 4/5
Location & interior: 5/5

If your real priority is finding a good place to watch multiple games at once - this is your place. Was not crowded at all, what seemed like 100+ TVs, and friendly service. I was impressed that the servers let us take our time and hang out for a few hours without any attitude or feeling of being rushed. We spaced out our ordering (app at kickoff, meals at halftime) and she was more than happy to accommodate. 

Food wasn't great, but it wasn't bad either. About what I would expect from a place whose focus is making sure you can see the game you want to see. 

There was free wifi but it didn't work - being from out of the country we were depending on access to the internet that way. When we brought it up, her explanation was that it didn't work pretty often. Boo."}
{"text":"Went here on vacation from Boston. Found the food to be very good, we had Chicken Stir Fry and Buffalo Chicken Flatbread. We came in for lunch and sat at the bar, although there were only a handful of people at the bar, it still was difficult to get the bartender over to us to refill our drink, the whole staff was very nice."}
{"text":"Fairly straightforward sports bar. Nice atmosphere but the prices are fairly high for what you get. Came here for a league event and the space was nice but the food was pretty mediocre. I got a classic hamburger with fries. I liked their bun but I thought the burger was pretty dry. I wouldn't come back here unless it was for another event, probably wouldn't order food or just stick to simple stuff like burgers or wings."}
{"text":"Excellent for sporting events. Went for the NBA skills comp. Food was pretty good. The DJ spinning afterwards was really into top 40 though, which is not my jam.

But I definitely recommend it for sports fans."}
{"text":"Will not ever return to this place. My fiance and I sat at the bar. The theme of this place with the female bartenders wearing referee costumes with a lot of sex appeal doesn't bother me at all even though I'm a female. What did bother me was the lack of service. There were 2 bartenders and the seating around the bar was less than half full, but the bartenders were very slow. They were nice but did not seem to have high intelligence from my conversation with them. We would have stayed for food and more than one drink but since it took too long for us to order our first round, we decided to go elsewhere, which led us to Gabby's where the bartender Lauren was excellent! At Shoeless Joes the bartenders were clearly giving more attention to the groups of all guys that were sitting at the bar. The one bartender blatantly walked passed us numerous times without asking how we were or if we needed anything and was only talking to the guy groups. So I don't know if we got bad service because I was a female so they didn't see dollar signs when they looked at us. Either way we will never be returning.

I would have given 0 stars but Yelp won't let me."}
{"text":"Total douche bar. Went to the UFC a couple nights ago. The ratio of guys to girls was 10:1 and the guys were by and large musclerexic bros in Ed hardy tees.  When one of them tried to start a fight with me for no reason the management refused to throw the guy out, twenty minutes later the guy sucker punched me in front of my wife. 

Fun night.  

Service was friendly and the food was fine, if a bit overpriced, but the sheer amount of douchebaggery I saw makes it impossible for me to recommend it to anyone who considers themselves a decent person. Stay away."}
{"text":"Came here last night to celebrate a friend's birthday. The location is pretty cool, lots of individual lounge areas and tons of TVs for sports watching, if you're into that thing.

The service was extremely slow, 20 minutes to get a pitcher, 20 minutes to get the bill, 20 minutes to get it paid. It might be because the place was packed after the Blue Jay's home opener. The waitresses wear very low cut tops (I'm pretty sure the black bras are part of their uniform), which will be very fun for those who love the ladies. It was also ridiculously hot (temperature wise)

The crowd was mostly guys, late 20s, lower 30s. The kind of guys who are into sports bars.

There was a pretty large dining room as well, but all we had were beers. There also seemed to be a somewhat separated VIP/private lounge area."}
{"text":"Terrible service with incompetent management. We came in to watch a football game and it's no wonder we were pretty much the only people in this bar. Even then, terrible service. Highly recommend you go elsewhere as they don't care about you and your business"}
{"text":"I had a bison burger the last time I was here but it's not on their menu anymore. Too bad because it was really good. It's a 3 star place in my books now. Yes it's because they dropped the bison burger.

I had to contend with the fish and chips this visit. For apps, we had calamari and nachos which were surprisingly good. The food didn't blow me away but it was good, no real complaints. The wait staff are average but a little bit intrusive at times. And dressing them up in low cut tops almost makes you think you may be at Hooters (which I've never been but have heard good things).

All in all, it was a good visit. Would recommend for big groups and lots of TVs for any free sporting event. Don't know if they do UFC events here but could see it happening."}
{"text":"This place is seriously understaffed, I even overheard a server complaining about it to the hostess. Staff looks tired and unhappy upon arrival. I requested water three times and it was forgotten, I ordered the vegetable wrap which was very cold. At the liberty village location and at Niagara Falls, I ordered the same thing, and the wrap was warm. We also ordered sweet potato fries but there was a mix up with the order. Food takes over thirty minutes to arrive so expect to wait. Really disappointed in this place, especially because I've been to several shoeless joes restaurants and have always had a good experience except this one."}
{"text":"Came here to grab some shots because it was on the way to the club.

There was a line up(st.patty's day) but that was expected.
Me and my friends just stood around at the bar,grabbed some shots and played pool($2 per play) while we waited for our table.

We got our table in around 30-40 minutes in the dining(?) area with projector screens and tvs lined up on one side of the wall.
The other side of the restaurant was more of a dining area and was dimly lit and quieter.

The servers are hot but they were too busy to care about getting us drinks or asking us if we needed anything as soon as we got a table.I guess dropping by just for shots by the bar was a smart idea.

Got out of there as soon as I was buzzed enough to enjoy the short walk to the club."}
{"text":"Shoeless Joes kind of became my go-to place to watch hockey while visiting Toronto with a friend of mine. It's your pretty standard sports bar with wall-to-wall televisions. During big games they play the game sound through the speakers which is a big plus. The atmosphere was actually quite nice. Everything felt clean and modern. As others have already mentioned, the dress-code for the waitresses here leaves little to the imagination but I figure that isn't my choice to make. It doesn't bother me at all as long as the staff are comfortable.

Most of the booths even have their own televisions that you are free to change the channel on. This was a big bonus when we wanted to catch an out-of-market game that other patrons were less interested in watching. There was even a night where we asked the waitress if she could switch one of the bigger screen to the game we wanted to watch and she happily obliged. This was much appreciated.

Biggest issue? Not a lot of vegetarian options on the menu if you don't like salad. During our visits here I had a chance to try the Rickard's White Premium Five cheese dip and the Field of Greens salad. The dip was actually really good and the salad was pretty standard. Definitely as for the dressing on the side though. The first time I had it, it was almost inedible."}
{"text":"This new location is an exemplary of sports bar.  Plenty of comfy leather sofas, tv screens broadcasting all kinds of sports, and scantily clad waitresses wearing heaps of makeup.  What more can an avid sports fan ask for?  

My buddies and I usually commence our bar hopping nights here by shooting some pool and ordering tequila shots."}
{"text":"I really like this place, it's a great sportsbar! I love how theres plenty of large sizes tv's around the place with a whole variety of games playing.  Plus, if you get a booth, they each have their own individual TV, so you can flip around and watch any game you want. That was perfect during the NHL playoffs when more than one game was on at once. Overall, great environment to the place:)

As for the food and service,  I was more or less pleased with both. I got a wild mushroom burger with a side of fries, both of which were delicious,  however,  I wish they would've given me more fries. The burger was a great size however. My boyfriend ordered an open faced steak sandwich, they even asked how he'd like thw steak cooked, and they cooked it properly soo way to go! Again though,  his side of mashed potatoes was pretty small. 
We came by another night and order a tray of nachos to share....they were good buuuut not $16 good. The service on both occasions was pretty good, it was relatively slow both tines we came and our waitress was attentive, which is great :)

The prices here can be a bit much given the portion size in some cases, but if you're looking to enjoy a night full of sports, I'd recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"I checked out these reviews after I had already arrived and was honestly nervous for my experience. Consistent 2 stars throughout the years.. damn! I've never been to a shoeless joe's before ever either so I was a blank slate. Thankfully for me, I would say it's around 3.5 stars leaning towards a 4.

It was the night of the raptor's game against the cavs, so my coworkers and I stopped by right after work and thankfully got a table for 10 without having to wait. Unfortunately, the table/booths near the wall behind the bar are all 100*C and feels like a steamy goodlife sauna. There was no way to turn down the temp either so all of us started melting away and sweat so much, we could pretty much wring ourselves out.. nastay.

A lot of their menu items were half price (I think on weekdays?) most apps were half price and our table got a whole bunch to try, and I got fish tacos to share as my actual meal. Their other entrees looked too filling but delicious - their burgers made my eyes drool. Their beer on tap and mixed drinks were also only 3.99 - THIS IS HOW PEOPLE GET DRUUUUNK. 

I enjoyed bites of their spinach dip (which was mediocre.. not enough pretzels/chips and too much dip, and the dip was too thiccc), buffalo cauliflower bites (delicious. Must try) and deep fried pickles (my fave. Very crisp and fresh). My fish tacos were very filling too - it came in 3, but I gave 2 away and my tummy was still okay and full.

My bill with 2 vodka sodas and a plate of fish tacos came to $16. WHAA? That is unheard of. Our service was very fast as well and the food came pretty quickly even though it was pretty much a full house in the restaurant.

I'd definitely come again if I was nearby looking for a bite."}
{"text":"Worst service ever.

We waited for over an hour and a half for appetizers and there was almost no one else was in the bar.

Um yeah.

It was a really bad experience.

I will never go back again.

Boo. For reals."}
{"text":"The service is terrible. The food is frozen from a box. It just doesn't make sense to go there, the food isn't great and the prices are very high. I would recommend this only if you're being taken here, otherwise they don't appreciate the regular hard working customer. This place also unfortunately discriminates against nationalities which is reflective of their service. I would avoid this place unless its raining and you've just won the lottery."}
{"text":"Shoeless Joe's..why does this location break my heart all the time? I am a big fan of Shoeless Joes and go to their other various locations however this location always seems to disappoint me no matter how many times I give them a chance. I came here last Friday with a friend..it was beginning to get busy and they had a few reserved signs around a few tables. I got to the hostess stand and asked if their were any booths available. The hostess immediately said no without checking and then brought us to a half booth which was fine. We sat down and our server who was very kind came to get our drink orders after 5 minutes of waiting (fair its busy) however we already knew what we were getting and put in our order. I also asked the waitress if we were able to change the TV channel to Sportsnet One as I wanted to watch the Canada Women's Soccer Game that was playing on various other TVs around the establishment. She said she would check with her manager, 10 minutes later her manager came by and began to change the TV BEHIND ME! I told her if she could change the one infront of me because I obviously can't watch TV through the back of my head. She then got annoyed and said she could only change one TV..which was fine because only I wanted to watch not my friend. She began switching the channels (they only have about 6 to work with!?) and then left it on..however, unfortunately as she put it on TIm and Sid decided to broadcast instead. 

My friend got her french onion soup and enjoyed it but complained a little about how it wasn't as cheesy as she usually has hers. After 10 minutes our food came, I got the classic burger and added bacon and my friend got the burger with mushrooms. I was VERY disappointed with the whole 25 french fries I got..which makes me think that they pre-set plates with french fries for the evening rush. My burger was good, really tender but the meat to bun ratio was off as the burger kept sliding out and making it a very messy experience. 

We looked through their dessert options to end but decided not to go for anything, when we got our bills..I got charged for my friends burger instead and she got charged for mine, we had to get our bills re-done correctly. We ended up paying and leaving..really disappointed. 

Although their food can be really good they seem to crush under pressure during the evening rush and therefore lack in food quality and consistency. I was hoping they would be a little bit more generous and their staff/manager a little bit kinder but you can't get it all with franchises..

I will go back to Shoeless Joes but not this location. Womp!"}
{"text":"Mum and I last night (Sat) were walking the town and freezing so we stopped here. I've been before with a group of maybe 15 people after the Aretha Franklin concert across the street.

I like the setup, we chose to sit in the dining room, away from the bar and subsequent ruckus. Nice large booths, good decor a million tvs everywhere, one at each booth. I do agree with the other interview that if you are going to 'watch' the game, then prob best not to do it here after 7/8pm on a weekend. It seems the music is more important than the sound for the game. 

Food & Drinks:
We were drinking hot tea the whole night, besides the topper missing of the top of the tea pot, it was fine. 
Apps:
We ordered the bruschetta, and man was I surprised. I figured it would be some mini baguette, over toasted so rough I would lose a few taste buds but it wasn't. These  were 8 large pieces of bread, toasted with diced tomatoes, red onions, crumbled feta cheese and some drizzlings of a white cream sauce and a dark brown sauce. It was a surprisingly nice portion size, presentation and taste. 
Entrees:
I ordered the Angus Beef Top Sirloin - medium w/ rice and vegetables. The rice tasted fine, but like it was a mixture of Uncle Ben's packaged rice with some regular unflavored rice. This I personally don't mind, I do it all the time at home. But just thought it should be noted. The steak was pinker than expected for medium, but I'm ok with that cause better to under cook than over (you can always put it back on the grill but can't less cook a well-done steak. The steak taste was nice, it was fresh as in not rolled or covered in a salt-based dry rub of some sort. As for tenderness...eh was a long chew, but I guess my mastication exercises are done for the week. Worst part of my entree was the veges....There was no flavor to them, clearly the product of a frozen packages so I had to dip them in the sauce drizzled over the bruschetta. 
Mum ordered the Blackened Chicken and Shrimp Diablo. Her shrimp was excellent! It was perfectly cooked and well flavored. The chicken looked great and tasted just good. The dry rub had really great flavors but had too much salt in its mix. Albeit it wasn't alot of chicken, it wouldn't have been a problem if the rub had been better. The bed of pasta all of it was served on, was pasta. It was nice. Really her shrimps were nice I wanted to steal them off her plate. Alas I resisted the urge....this time.

Service:
Was good. Hostess was sweet and joked with us when she caught on to my joking with her about something even though she was a little busy. Our service was also sweet and apparently got really busy when her party of 10 turned into 18. We didn't even notice til she told us at the end cause she still did rush by even now and again, but also had her colleague look after us so we weren't bothered by it. 

Atmosphere:
I mentioned it a little above. It is called a sports bar, buut I think it is more restaurant/bar. The dining room section does have a tv at every booth, but no volume. I hear the bar area doesn't turn the volume and there was a big hockey game on last night (TO vs Vancouver - TO last badly 2-6). They started turning the nightclub music up as time went by, but as I noticed the last time I came it doesn't really turn over into a dance bar/club. So whats the point of making the music the number priority, I don't know.
Waiters/resses/Host/ess - they are all nice, but I'm not a fan of looking to my left and seeing a hostess wipe down a booth table and not realize her whole 'under'world is exposed because her 'uniform' dress/skirt is too ridiculously short. I guess that's for the guys and ladies who swing that way.... Enjoy fellas

Bang for Buck?
Umm, yea. Considering prime location in Toronto, food portion, atmosphere produced, food taste etc yea. For the two of us it  was $55.55 . Over my normal price range, but gotta treat the mum one in a while. This did not include alcohol nor dessert. Will I go back, sure, probably for lunch instead ."}
{"text":"Shoeless Joe's being a franchise, there isn't much difference to other SJ locations. The only difference would be the service and how well your bartender can make your drink.....sorry to say, but that's true. 
 
We came here with a group of friends and acquaintances to celebrate Toronto FC's victory nearby. Like all bars situated new a sports venue, the place was noisy and overcrowded, however with that being said, it was no surprise.  Though the patio wait time was over 45mins, we ended up sitting indoor and was seated within minutes. 
Though our waitress was cute, the service was extremely slow, and inefficient.  In addition the food was your typical bar food, which in most cases is mediocre.  

Wanting to try something different, I  ordered their Tropical Sangria that I rated a 1/5.
First off the sangria lacked substance!!!  though the presentation factor was exhibited, it was watered down...... 

Southern fried chicken sliders 2.5/5: took forever to come out, the buscuit bread was hard, and it did lacked versatile flavoring. The ranch sauce served added some element of flavor, but overall disappointing.

:("}
{"text":"You know you are from out of town when your first thought upon hearing the name, Shoeless Joe's, is ``oh, a foot wear chain.``   I could not believe how completely wrong I was.

There are a multitude of these places around so I will not need to say very much.

One of the grand things about a restaurant that has the following words or combination: sports bar, sports bar and grill or sports anything is,  I have no expectations other than it is what it is - pub food.

In this instance, even I was surprised on how not so great of  pub food this was.  I ordered your standard fare of burger and fries.  It was one most un-burger like patties I ever had.  It tasted like a mushy ground beef patty.

All that being said, they do offer a vast array of choices so if you do have a larger party.

Unbeatable is there customer service. Thoroughly entertaining and professional. Food and drinks came out in a timely manner. Any requests we had, they easily accommodated us including separate bills.

I would return here but I just wouldn't order the burger."}
{"text":"It's a sports bar...and regrettably, there's not nearly enough of them in downtown Toronto, so that's what this place has going for it. Interior reminds me of someone's finished basement more than anything. Service was very friendly, though their beer selection was somewhat limited. Good place to watch a game but not necessarily a must-visit if you're in Toronto for a weekend."}
{"text":"A brief few Saturday's ago, my room-mate and I decided that we wanted to dine on the many offerings of the bayou and attempted to converge on Big Daddy's crab shack. Much to our dismay upon arrival we found that we had to wait at least an hour and half before it was open. With this in mind we set to find a bar and the first bar we found was Shoeless Joe's at King & Duncan. 

We entered the subterranean bar just into a long and almost clinical and were greeted quite promptly by all of the 3 hosts on duty and were quickly ushered to our table. I was to later find out that this was the day of the grand opening, which made the themed cake and banners being built on a makeshift stage make a little more sense in prospective. The atmosphere here is not like any other Shoeless Joe's, instead of classic sports bar it comes off more as a high-class gentleman's club with lot's of flat screen tv's and reproduced sports memorabilia instead of brass poles. The waitress uniforms are a micro-skirt and an uber-boostier stretch top that spilled there ample selves everywhere. Personally it made me feel a little uncomfortable, as though there might have been a menu on the table for pictures and prices for a half hour in the champagne room.

With time, hunger and a hangover to kill we ordered drinks (myself a 'Big Splash Caesar and my friend a draft) and an appetizer of bruschetta to spit in order to tide us over until our planned meal and of course so we didn't turn zombie drunk.

The Caesar was the standard concoction of the unholy but delicious marriage of tomato juice, the tears of a clam, hot sauce (but no horseradish), vodka and celery salt. However I was to learn that 'Big Splash' meant that it came with with a skewer of jalapeño stuffed olives, cocktail onions, pepperoni and a gherkin pickle, which in and of itself was a delightful little meal.

The Bruschetta was excellent, a barely toasted (read could have been crispier) ciabatta loaf with bruschetta tomatoes (decent and fresh), feta cheese (good but tasted more like a dull chèvre), balsamic glaze (standard but always good reduction of modena) and garlic ranch (which took away it's whimsy and brought it to the trailer park).

Next course was the 'Caesartini', which was basically a Caesar with out ice and no appetizer sized skewer was good as expected.

The final course was the 'Diablo Caesar' which is described as Lime infused tequila with Clamato spice, upon ordering I was informed that their special tequila was not in stock and asked to sub it in with regular tequila so I said fuck it, let's give it a whirl. What I learned from that experience was that tequila does not mix well with clamato and should be avoided lest you will be stuck sucking down a muddy drink of shame only so to make sure no alcohol is wasted."}
{"text":"Came with a group of friends on friday evening, it wasn't really busy but the host took a while to come to the front and seat us but once we were seated, the server was good and the food was good, as well. Inside the restaurant was very spacious with lots of seating, big screen TVs like other sports bars, and clean washroom! The food was surprisingly good because I find that most of the sports bars have good drinks but not food so Shoeless surprised me - I got the Chicken cordon bleu which had cheese stuffed chicken breast with bacon, mashed potato, grilled vegetables and the cream sauce. Would come again!"}
{"text":"Great place to watch the game, fun atmosphere, but I didn't care for the food. Got the soft chicken tacos. Supposedly they had chipotle seasoning, but overall they tasted very bland. Also wasn't impressed that half the chicken was burned on the outside - and there wasn't much chicken in them to begin with. There is a difference between charbroiled and burnt - and this was just burnt. Also noticed weird portion sizes, like a ton of chips with a thimble of salsa.  Our server was slow and brought everyone the wrong bill the first time, but it wasbusy so that's forgivable. Overall, the booth seats to watch the big screen action are pretty sweet and the prices aren't bad -, considering they had a pint special on a saturday game night."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Shoeless Joe's for a number of years. Originally we wanted to get some Thai food after watching a musical at Princess of Wales Theatre, but the lineup was insane, so we decided to come here for dinner instead. It was 9:15pm by the time we arrived and they had already closed off the dining area. WE didn't care anyway so we sat at one of the booth tables at the bar. I liked that spot because there was TV around but it wasn't too noisy, so helps lessen the distractions. 

My family and I decided to order a few different things. My dad got the buffalo chicken flatbread. My brother's gf and I both ordered fish tacos and my fiance ordered their Piston burger (one of their chef inspired menu items... basically i'ts a turkey burger).

The turkey burger was very good! patty was juicy and delicious. the portion is huge though.
I LOVED my fish tacos. the flatbread was okay, nothing really spectcular about it though. but those fish tacos.. man they were good! i didn't expect them to be so big though so i coudln't finish it and took one home lolz. I'm giving it 4 stars based on the fact that I loved my fish taco order, otherwise the food is not too bad overall. maybe because it's more quiet by the time by the time we came, overall everything was pretty good."}
{"text":"A group of 7 of us, on the way to see Motown the Musical, decided to hit this place for dinner prior to the show. It's not a place that typically comes to mind as a \"Pre Theatre\" restaurant, but seeing as how the 7 of us have vastly different tastes, it was an agreed upon option due to its large menu. We figured there would be something for everyone and there was.

There is no denying that: 1) it's definitely a sports bar; 2) the female staff are hired according to point 1; 3) its pub fair; and 4) its a sports bar.

I won't go into specifics on what every person had, so I'll stick to those closest to me and my meal:
Person 1 had the Pad Thai. She asked if it was spicy (as she can't tolerate a lot of heat in her food) and the waitress was bang on in her assessment of heat factor. She even offered to have the kitchen take the heat factor down a notch, but my friend decided to go with the normal heat level. She really liked it. Sitting close by, I can tell you that it smelled amazing....and portion size was fairly large for the price point.

Person 2 ordered the bacon encrusted meatloaf, with mashed potatoes and veggies. She said the meatloaf was good...but the bacon on the bottom was not cooked and was inedible (to be fair, I've cooked bacon encrusted meatloaf at home and experienced the same issue). Its one of the only times I've seen this person leave bacon on their plate and no-one leaves bacon.

I ordered the buffalo strips....they were as expected....good but nothing memorable. A bit low on the heat factor (unlike my friend, I love spicy foods)

We did have an issue with a drink and had to send it back. One of us ordered a Canadian on tap. When it arrived it had this odd thing floating in it......so we scooped it out with a fork. Without going into too much detail, it appeared to be mucus spit (the kind you have when you're coughing up a bad cold). Disclaimer alert - I'm not saying it WAS spit, but everyone at the table agreed that it LOOKED like spit. We called over the waitress who took the beer back without question (we didn't tell her what was wrong with it...just that something was floating in it). 

Our waitress was great. She knew the menu and chatted with us prior to our leaving about how she needs to get out and see some of the theatre in the area. As an added bonus, when she discovered we were going to see a Mirvish production, the entire table got a 15% reduction off the bill...courtesy of the Mirvish Company. Great idea.

Would I go back? Maybe....but with so many options in the area, it'll be a toss up. Just won't order a beer on tap."}
{"text":"Server was extremely unimpressive. Almost no emotions. The food was cold and we were never asked if we wanted a refill of our drink. The trip fed us before the show but that was about it! Unless you're pressed for time, choose another spot!"}
{"text":"This place is a rich man's Hooters. Our waitress was really friendly and cheery, but I found it odd that half the waitresses were dressed in t-shirts with respectable necklines and pants, while the others were in very low-cut mini-dresses. What's with that segregation? And why are anyone's tatas popping out at 12pm?

Anywho, I ordered a goat cheese pizza with a gluten-free crust. I was so excited to see that as an option (although it was $2 more than regular crust), but it ended up being unbearably dry and crispy. I know baking without gluten is a bit tough, but damn, leave it off the menu until you get it right! Such a disappointment.

My personal pizza ended up being $22 after tax and tip. So not worth any of it."}
{"text":"The service really fluctuates, but my most recent experience at this Shoeless Joe's got me to do a review. We came in with a party of 3 and ordered very light, but our server really went the extra mile. We tried the Thai shrimp quesadilla from the new/temporary menu and it was AMAZING. It had rich flavours and the price was just right. We also paid and tipped a bit early in advance but the service did not waver at all! I was really impressed with our last server."}
{"text":"Went there with 8 other people. 

I came a bit late, after everyone had already ordered. I ordered a Mushroom Burger and it arrived in decent time.  I ended up ordering 2 more beers, and 3 shots.  The bill came out to be 50$.  The burger was really good, but not the best I ever had, I would order it again, but not expect to be amazed.  

The service was good, the waitress came once a while to check up on us, and we had no issues with the bill being split.  (everyone had different number of drinks... she got it right on the first try).

The Locale:
They were playing music in the background, and had hockey and baseball on the TV.  The sounds were not overwhelming, until the bartender started promoting other nights (over a microphone which disrupted the conversations we were having).  He did this 3 times in the hour and a bit we were there.   

I would go there to meet with friends, but not if I wanted to talk about something important."}
{"text":"I could feel how the washroom smells from my table. It's awful. I'm very disappointed of that fact. They couldn't even do anything to fix it. Sorry, I have no more words for that place"}
{"text":"mediocre. 

the flatbreads were decent, but the sausage pepper penne was just okay. don't think it was worth the high price (~$15-20) per dish. 

I think a pizza from dominoes would taste better than the flatbread, and some homemade spicy Italian sausage penne would outdo the theirs."}
{"text":"I've been to this Shoeless Joe's location on quite a few occasions, and have been to a few parties in their bar as well. The thing about this Shoeless Joe's, is that I want to love it, I really do... but I just... don't. 

Why do I want to love it? Well the staff are super-friendly, and the space is amazing! They have a sports-centre in the back of the bar area with reclining leather chairs and wall-to-wall screens. They have a few private dining areas which are really nice, and their booths all have private TVs. They have a great, convenient location, and have a really full menu that has something for everyone. 

So why don't I love it? Well I'm extremely partial to sliders, and upon my first visit there I was so happy to see that they have tons of slider options. The first time I ordered them, it was St. Patrick's Day, and it was insanely busy. They got my order wrong the first time, but quickly changed it. However, when I did get my sliders, they were cold! So disappointing, but I decided to give them another chance, since it was so busy that evening. Maybe a week later I went back to try the Chicken Wing Sliders... unfortunately, they got my order wrong again... but this time I was in a rush and just ate the sliders. They were good, not great. The main issue I have with them is that they have a \"wonder-bread\" type bun. Just empty white-bread carbs that basically taste like nothing-ness - and if you're paying around $15 for sliders, I would hope to have something a bit better! I've been a few other times and have had salads (which are decent) and also they make an excellent Caesar, which have little pepperonis as a garnish! Their food on a whole though... is just okay. 

I really think it's the fact that I love the staff that will keep me going back... but they will probably keep disappointing me on the food-front!"}
{"text":"Weak!
This place has potential because of it's size and amount of seating. They also have pleanty of TVs. 
Service wasn't very good, our bartenders seamed bored because it wasn't too busy but it was still hard to get a drink. 
The guy to girl ratio was about 10 to 1 which was kinda weird. Just wasn't a big fan of the staff or the crowd."}
{"text":"Had the Sausage Penne. Was very good. Had enough meat which a lot of these places like to skip out on so I was impressed. Staff was pleasent and everyone in our group of 20 was happy when they were done so I would say there are very good with groups."}
{"text":"This place is the worst. 

Having come here in the past and being less than impressed, we stopped by before a show at the Royal Alex (due to location and time constraints) to grab a quick bite with really really low expectations. Even still, they managed to disappoint.

We ordered a pitcher of beer and nachos - assuming these would be a safe bet cus even when nachos are pretty bad they are still edible. 

Well the nachos are terrible. Served flat and sparse they are really expensive for the small quantity you get. They arrived cold and with minimal toppings. And didn't come with guac as requested.

Which leads to the capabilities of our server....she had none. It took me 5 minutes to explain to her that we didn't want the chili sauce on the nachos but on the side if possible. She still left with a confused look. She offered the guac like three time (all three of which I said YES and it still came without). She NEVER once came to check on us. My boyfriend ordered a basket of fries afterwards. That took over 20 minutes to come out. Again cold. We wanted to tell her to ask for a new batch and also to bring ketchup the next time around. But alas, she never stopped by. She WALKED by, but ignored our every attempt to flag her down. We saw her playing on her phone in the kitchen area for a while which was great. We finally flagged another server to ask for help. She said ok, but then she also did nothing. 

So anywaysssss. Food is crap. They only hire incompetent servers. Prices high for the crap food and service you get. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Pretty cool place to go and chill ... Watch a game on one of there many tvs ... Didn't eat here so can't say anything about there food .. Looks like they did have a good selection of beer ... Enjoy"}
{"text":"I wasn't too impressed with the latest experience I had here. I came with a large group of 15 people. The service here was super super slow and inattentive. For starters, they didn't give us enough glasses of water, so some of us had to share. There were also maybe like, at most 2 sets of utensils on the table, which we didn't realize until the food came and some people couldn't eat. For some reason, the first time our waitress came around she only took one person's order, which was odd and slightly confusing for the rest of us. 

I ordered the lobster grilled cheese, which was mediocre and disappointing. The lobster didn't taste fresh at all - it tasted like it came out of a can. Also the cheese was like... not super gooey or melty or anything. I don't know, it just didn't seem like a freshly grilled cheese sandwich, the cheese seemed kind of hard/old or something. 

Our waitress didn't come around to check on us even once after we got our food, and we had difficulty tracking her down when we wanted to get the bills. I was also displeased to discover on my bill that I was charged extra for my sweet potato fries and chipotle mayo, and I wish the waitress had told me there would be an extra charge for those items - I thought it was unprofessional that she didn't.

The only mildly redeeming thing was that the manager came around to our table and gave us all cards for a free sandwich - some kind of promo related to the Leafs winning or something. It was a nice gesture I guess, but felt kind of forced to me. 

There are definitely much better places to eat, especially in this part of Toronto, so I would pass on this location. Honestly I can't imagine any reason why I would ever come back."}
{"text":"I visited twice on a recent trip to Toronto with my boyfriend. The first time the food and drinks were tasty and server was very attentive and nice. Our second visit, however, was totally different, otherwise I'd probably give it a 4 or 5 star rating. At first, we were seated in front of a TV which wasn't showing the NHL playoff, so I asked if it was possible they move us else where, which they reluctantly did. After this happened, I overheard the server complaining that we had been moved from his area to another so he wouldn't serve us. The other server told him she was fine with him serving us in her section, so she wouldn't be serving us. We assumed they'd sort it out amongst themselves and someone would serve our table. Stupidly we waited 35 minutes - still nothing, not even a drink order. We chose just to get up and leave as we didn't want to spend any more of our money with a company who has so little respect for their customers. If they didn't want to move us to another section, we would have accepted this, as from our previous experience days earlier we really enjoyed the food and wanted to have it again. Such a shame, the place has potential but they might want to consider how their staff are treating their customers."}
{"text":"My review is on the service of this restaurant. Came here last night with a few friends cause I was craving some wings and they had a decent special. 6.99 per pound. Had a bunch of coupons as well. 
We ordered our drinks then our food Nachos and each of us had a pound of wings. 

Firstly, Our nachos came out at the same time as our wings. With the amount of time it took to get our food, the nachos should have come first. But no big deal.
Secondly, we asked if we could use our coupons and the waitress said yes of course. I thought sweet. 
We also ordered extra sauces on the side but we didn't get those until literally half way through our meal even though we told the waitress twice. 
She did take it off the bill so props. 

My only real qualm is that after we received our food and drinks on the first round, our waitress practically left us. Maybe she got jammed but she didn't come back once to our table. I was kind of shocked. I thought we did something wrong or something. 
At the end, when we finally got her attention and got our bill. Think I had to walk up to her and interrupt her convo with her friend, to get the bill. The manager came down and said we can't use the coupons. I was like \"what the?\" He told me the reason and it's basically because there was a previous coupon used and that's for the wings - because of the special. 

Honestly, I could have made a stink about it but I didn't. The guy was nice enough about it and it's business, it happens. I just really wish that the service was faster, better, more on point and they had more waitresses. Wings were also pretty scrawny as well and not even hot. I wanted to order another pound but with our waitress gone, I had to settle for mcdonald's after."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Shoeless Joe's in years because the few times I've gone in the past the menu never really had anything that appealed to me. I was never interested in their meals just kinda stuck to a particular dish. After my dance on Tuesday my two girl friends suggested we go grab some food and late night snack. We started to wonder the streets and came across this place. Decided to go in at 1030pm at night. We were greeted by a friendly server who informed us which part of the restaurant was open to taking orders. We sat and began looking at the new and revised menus. 

Like I said earlier, I haven't been here in ages. I could not believe how much the menu changed! I had a very difficult time trying to decided on what to order. I decided on the chicken, shrimp with vegetables over quinoa. It was cooked to perfection. Extremely light on the body which was an excellent thing consider the time at night we were eating this meal. I complemented the meal with a nice glass of house red wine. 

What I found disturbing was the way our waitress was dressed. She was wearing a low neck/cut black short dress. It looked like her Breast were going to pop right out. I understand some female serves feel they need to do that to gain some extra tips but attending this bar with a group of ladies, non of us really needed to see it. I'm pretty sure if she moved a certain way there was no holding them in. 

Bottom line this was DISGUSTING and if this is the way managers run their staff I'm not sure I would go back!"}
{"text":"Worst place to go. We didn't even know it was ufc fight night and they place us in the bar area right in front of the big screen with these nice comfy chairs. But we didn't want to watch the game, we would have rather been on the other side. We just wanted some food and drinks. Anyway, service was very slow. The waitress was rarely around and she couldn't see us calling her. I ordered French fries. Which were so bad. Way too crunchy and hard, like they have been sitting out all day or something. I ordered tropical sangria, which was very good. Now it was time for the bill and since when do we have to tip 18% when the service was terrible. What the hell. I not tipping that much when she didn't even show her face. Plus, we didn't even come to watch this fight, and they gave us prime seating. I complained to the manager and didn't end up paying the tip. I added my own, the standard tip amount. The manager tried to make me feel bad saying to the waitress \"it ok I'll pay you out of my pocket.\" I wasn't even finished my drink yet and the servers kept looking at us waiting for us to leave. Won't be coming back here. I don't recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"The manager was so rude! Our waitress mistakenly wanted to charge us extra and we told her! She freaked out and called for her manager! The manager wasn't even sorry! He didn't apologize and threw out the wrong bills in an inappropriate way and brought us our new bills! Like it was our fault!!! I won't go there again ever! You should learn how to respect your costumers!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here after an event at the Rogers Centre. The service was excellent. Our waitress was very fast and polite. We were only in for drinks and did not have any food, but the food being served to tables around us looked very good. Located next to the Raddison hotel"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon the bar looking for please showing the dodger game. And I'm so happy that being or playing the game and of your selection was great. We met some pretty cool locals there and ended up partying with them to the wee hours of the night. Pretty chill spot for pre-gaming -- don't pass it up!"}
{"text":"This place is mediocre, I've been a few times and always have a just \"ok\" time.  The service is usually pretty slow, which is my main qualm.  Last time I went it was not even remotely busy yet (mostly empty, tbh), and they had what looked like 50 servers just standing around doing nothing.  

After 20 minutes of waiting and looking obviously in need of some sort of beverage, nobody came over so I had to go to the bar and ask if anyone was serving my area.  

That question was met with some interesting looks/confusion, and shortly after the server for that area materialized out of thin air (and with a bit of an air about her).  After that she came by our table a bit more frequently, but also clearly paid more attention to the males in our group. I don't normally care, as long as you give me my damn beer first!

The food is ok, it's good if you're starving and need to shove something in your face quickly but it would never be my sole reason for coming to this place.  

If you like betting on horse races, come here.  There's a back room for private parties which is decent as well.

Overall, there are much better, nicer, cozier, more fun bars to go to in the same general vicinity, so only go here if you're forced to or just bored in general."}
