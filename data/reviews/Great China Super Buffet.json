{"text":"This is not my normal choice in restaurants. My parents were in town and my dad loves a good Chinese Buffet. This restaurant seems to be a seniors dream. It was a sea of white hair as I looked around. My family and I were probably the youngest patrons in the restaurant. I think they have a discount for seniors - good if you're a senior I guess! :)   I've had some bad experiences at buffets before and was a little leery. The buffet was huge and had quite an assortment Chinese food. While most of the food seemed more Americanized there were some Dim Sum favorites hiding among the aisle of deep fried goodness - pork shui mai, soup dumplings and salt & pepper squid. The food seemed to be pretty fresh and luckily hadn't been under the heat lamps too long. I guess when there's 100 seniors coming in and out for the four hour dinner period food is prepared and replaced often.   Overall, I thought The Great China Buffet was not too bad. It filled our belly's and made us happy for a couple of hours. They're doing something right to be packed during a recession!"}
{"text":"Closed.  The new restaurant in it's place is called Mandarin Buffet.  Haven't tried it yet."}
{"text":"True, this place is not shining like the top of the  Chrysler building. However, it is an inexpensive buffet,so you cannot have it all.                    The hostess is always eating when you come in and she is never happy. Everyone else there is great!  They have a huge selection of food here,lots of seafood as well. Your drink comes with the meal and they put out a lot of coupons. So even better. Plenty of parking and lots of seating."}
{"text":"worst Buffet I have ever been to. Tried oysters were bad smelt like bad fish  took on bite was spoiled. Tried shrimp very watery and rubbery had hell of a time peeling off shell. Had marinated ribs took a bite grease ran down my chin, so I tried the char su marinated red pork way dry and overcooked very tough. gave it one more chance tried the orange chicken had so much salt in it all I could taste was the salt. will not come back here again was first and last visit. go to China City just past power and baseline so much better"}
{"text":"What a great new buffet for the North Central area!!! It's one of the biggest ones I've ever seem (that's what she said)!  Now bigger doesn't always equate to better, but this place was really good. All of the food was super fresh (or as fresh as you can expect a buffett to be). the had plenty of options, better sushi than most chinese buffett places and even a Mongolian Gr\ll in the back!  Service was good, prices pretty good and pretty good quality food. Dig it, want to go back...tonight..."}
{"text":"Great China   chinese restaurant and super buffet there is no the in the name.But there is some good food inside the place.the decor is average and are booth was comfy but well worn.The buffet had about 80 items ,about the super buffet requirement.They had a small sushi section and the sushi was very tasty.The wonton soup i had was very hot and good it had most of your typical trays with a couple of different twists on some like the stuffed clams were huge and and they had some good sole,that thet called snow fish?When i left this place i was stuffed and everything i ate was good.So yes Great China gets 4 stars.And for Norm R. they got the almond cookie packages"}
{"text":"Went here with Rand H. for thhe lunch buffet and i thought it was pretty good. The food was all tasty and there was lots to choose from.There is also a mongolian BBQ and sushi table.I gave them 4 stars because there is a couple of better Chinese buffets in the valley (Jen buffet and Pacific seafood buffet) that are 5 stars but this place would make my top ten Chinese buffets list. So if your looking for a good Chinese buffet in the Phoenix area this one would be a good choice."}
{"text":"I have had way better chinese food. Not fresh and bad stomach aches later at night. Sick- not overeating. Good walnut shrimp."}
{"text":"I thought it was pretty Good. Nice selection of food.  I don't like seafood so i can't tell ya how any of that tasted but everything else I had was good.                      Bobbie"}
{"text":"It was a dark and stormy night here in the valley of the sun. Clouds were rolling in faster than the light rail on a summer day. Even with the rain falling it was as sticky out as a pan of rolls from Cinnabon. As for me I was sitting on my porch contemplating whether or not to take this special case. With my belly rumbling I really had no choice. So after deciding to move on with my investigation I got in my car and started to cruise down Southern Ave in the heart of East Mesa, I passed by all the local late night suspects hangouts.   Wendy's- no thanks! KFC- Sorry Colonel but you have failed too many times in the heat of battle, and I was still a little scarred from my sub battle with the sandwich Nazi (read my subway review). Jack in the box and Mcdonalds looked open but I was in no mood to clown around. This hunger of mine was getting out of control and I was the only one that could stop it. Just when all hope seemed lost and I would have to make a run for the border ( taco bell) a light from heaven or a little neon sign (I forget which one) that read Great China Super Buffet came into view.   Now anyone who knows me at all knows I hate all things buffet, but if I wanted to solve this case and get rid of my gut wrenching hunger I knew I had no choice. So I did what any good food detective does and went in. Wow what a huge place. It was the kind of place that promised a good time if you were willing to spend a little dough. Over 200 items all waiting to tempt your palate and tickle your taste buds.   Several freshly made dishes gave off scents that made my mouth water and my throat close at the same time as i sucked each nostril full, hoping that maybe the different flavors would enter my mouth and turn into food if I held them captive long enough. No such luck! So after speaking to the nice waitress I was handed a menu (got takeout) and took my time to study my file (menu). I had dealt with this cast of characters before. There was the delicious yet seductive Lady Moo Shu.   She is the kind of dish that excites your taste buds and leaves you stumbling all over yourself waiting for the next bite. Then there is the General, Tso is his name and he commands his army to march right through the middle of flavor town. His attacks are swift and his spicy flavor bombs will blow away all your hunger till nothing remains. Eager to solve this case and eat some delicious food I ordered and dashed home. Each bite of chicken was just like that little light had been, pure heaven!   Even though I was eating a meal at home they had somehow managed to take all those great smells and create a meal that made me wish it was my last. Why? Because how can I ever go back to the old neighborhood place that serves food that looks like it came from the frozen section at your local grocery store? I can't, I won't go back! Bottom line is you don't have to be a food detective to know this place offers some of THE BEST Chinese food in the STATE case closed. Now lets eat!"}
{"text":"Great China Super Buffet was an adventure.  There were some inedible items on that buffet.  I didn't spit out my food like my dinner guest.  I will not be back sad to say because I like a good buffet."}
{"text":"This is reopen and different owner ,different staff and different chef,  they very friendly ,nice, helpfull , room clean, the restroom clean too, design  inside room different , so nice. nice room, they have 3 or 4 television.  those name change \"CHINA CITY BUFFET \"  almost all the  food is good,  every night ,they have crab leg ,they have 4 item ice cream,  mon - thurs $ 10,99 ,  week end $ 12,99 for dinner. for lunch $ 7,99.  i like cooking,but  If i lazy for cooking,i and my hubby lunch or dinner those place,  because near our house ( 3 mile)."}
{"text":"Ok, I went to Great China because 1. I was dining alone tonight and 2. I have a guilty pleasure for buffets. I went expecting the place would be a 3 but probably no more. Well It generally is the same set-up as Hometown but Americanized Chinese Food. The crowd was about 98% Hispanic 2% Gay Men. You pay after you eat now, which seems odd. I guess they figure more tips that way, meaning less labor costs. They do bring your refills and clear your plates promptly so it is worth it.   I grabbed a plate, the first couple I picked up had food on them. I put them aside and moved to a different stack not thinking much about it with all the kids there. The one I got looked clean enough. I went through and checked out all the offerings and made my way filling up my plate. I skipped the BBQ section as I found plenty that looked good.  Most of the dishes were pretty good. Some were much better than expected such as the pepper shrimp. Another reviewer mentioned the egg rolls were like Spring rolls. Actually they had both kinds on two different tables. Both were mediocre at best. I ate everything on my plate with the exception of the stuffed crab shells, which were stuffed with some rather odd inedible filling.  I went back for seconds and picked up a soup bowl. The first couple still had food in them. Then I realized that most of them did. Thinking back on the plates earlier, I almost lost it. Come on people basic Sanitation here. Get a new dishwasher or something but fix it. Most of the other people didn't seem to care so I doubt it will be high on their priority list. I did mention it to my server.  Anyway, I don't think I will be back anytime soon after this experience. Before the Soup Bowl, I was ready to rate it a 3.5 but they lost me. Anyone rating this place a 5 is either an owner/investor or has serious munchies in my opinion.   They could easily turn this place around with better management, but I doubt they will, We will see."}
{"text":"Well I don't know Rand but I know Glenn to be a pretty good judge of food until now. Maybe we went on days with different cooks or something. I was very disappointed.   My friend and I could not agree on a place to eat so we thought what the heck check out the new Buffet. Looks the same as the old country Buffet only darker, about every other light bulb was out. Just the feel of this place was off to me. We arrive about 20 minutes after they opened, yet the majority of the items on the Buffet appeared to have been there overnight.   Almost every item I tried was overcooked. Way over cooked. I tried the following:   Egg roll...Yuck!!!!!!  Crab Ragoon....more like a hollow wonton  Beef and broccoli....really how do you mess this up? With bad broccoli!  Spicy chicken..Lets just say I don't think it was chicken  General Tsao chicken.....was just sweet no spice and soggy...bluck  Mongolian stir fry.....ok but not worth the trip  Mushrooms....decent  Fried potatoes...good  Fried rice...crusty no flavor  Fried Fish....good  Fried shrimp...doughy with the vein  some pork dish....don't remember  Rib tips...dried up and no flavor  Wings....of a pigeon maybe  California roll....no flavor, fell apart, and was dry.  Wasabi....no, green paste WTF?  Chinese donut.....Yummy   The seafood was scary looking. I ended up eating fried fish that they had just brought out & fried potatoes and the only reason they have a star is because they have a very good Chinese donut!   I know a Buffet sounds good sometimes but do yourself a favor & drive past this joint! Head to 15th ave and camelback just a few blocks away and visit Peter Wongs! For more details check out my Wong review!"}
{"text":"I'VE NEVER SPAT OUT SO MUCH FOOD IN MY LIFE! I WISH THE MEMORY OF THIS PLACE WERE AS SHORT AS THE TIME THE FOOD SPENT IN MY STOMACH. I barely got home before I was wretching it all out. All hail to the porcelain god!  Sometimes those Curious George moments of exploratory inquest (like Diamonds on 7th Ave) should just be suppressed. In the case of Great China Super Buffet, curiosity _will_ kill the cat.  In case you're dragged there by your kidnappers: --green beans with you-can't-believe-it's-not-butter slipperyness is swallowable --fresh fruit with sugary sweet red-colored corn syrup slathered all over it. it is fruit, after all. --cantaloupe, honeydew and red grapes are the ONLY safe items in the whole place --cook-to-order BBQ bar is a novelty, but the meat quality is little better than Bantha Poo-doo.  104 items, tasted and spat. The notable worst of the worst: --cooked seafood. Krab pieces and wonton noodles buried under a pile of melted cheese. think gag reflex. --butter mushrooms. squishy rubber which if not held carefully in the mouth while chewing, might bounce into your throat and choke you. --halved hard-boiled eggs. how can a hard boiled egg be so dry it's crunchy? --gloopy globs of \"honey\", \"sweet\", \"bbq\" and 30 other substitute names for breaded, fried and corn-syruped to death. it'll be _your_ death. --bbq pork ribs are little more than charred fat left on the bone, painted red and then baked. EW --oh, i almost forgot the horrible mystery sushi rolls. don't let the brightly colored drizzle sauce fool you! --shell-on shrimps mean naive customers are about to eat shrimp poop. DE-VEIN THEM, OR DON'T SERVE THEM, YOU PIGS!  SLASH MEXICAN --China is close enough of a translation in Spanish. Still, they serve Mexican food here, too. --\"Fried Rice\" is little more than pasty-orange \"Spanish\"-style, but it's NASTY --Enchiladas. At a Chinese place? Come on! --Burritos. WHAT?!!! --oh, and Pizza, and Garlic Bread !!!  PIGSTY --flies swarmed in the walkways between islands and kitchen. --dishes and leftover food stacked endlessly behind half-wall stations in buser tub after buser tub --carpet is so filthy you might slip and slide --glass doors, entry walkway tile, and hostess counters haven't been cleaned in months --pussy ooze dripped off the mouth of the gumball machine in the entryway  @Rand H. -- Are you an investor or something? I hope you have insurance. You CAN'T be serious about a fiver review. Boo!  @The-rest-of-you. Make me wish I could \"enemy\" yelpers. Why didn't you give me a proper goddam warning?!?!  I **AM** GOING TO CALL THE EFFING HEALTH INSPECTOR !!!"}
{"text":"I went here with my younger brother around 1:30 PM on a Wednesday afternoon (basically right when one would expect the lunch rush to be slowing down). At first glance, I was like, \"Wow! This place is huge!\", however, I quickly realized that the illusion of being a huge buffet was produced by full size mirrors on the walls next to the buffet bars and that in reality, they actually only have 4 or 5 buffet bars.  As for the food, it was mediocre at best. I couldn't even cut the orange chicken with my fork (it was so tough), and their sushi bar was a complete joke. I could hardly find any actual raw fish anywhere in the sushi rolls (it was all just imitation crab meat ), and the actual rolls were very gummy and rubbery when eaten. I didn't get a chance to try the Mongolian BBQ station, which might be why my opinion is so low, but I've never been much of a fan of Mongolian BBQ anyways.  The Good: Their Lo Mein noodles were delicious, and I thoroughly enjoyed their egg rolls (which were actually more like spring rolls). A number of the other food options I sampled (such as the cream cheese wantons and the stuffed mushrooms) were rather enjoyable.  Summary: For a $6.49 lunch, this place is not bad. If you like Mongolian BBQ, and want to eat a ton of food, I'm willing to bet that you will thoroughly enjoy this place. If you are wanting sushi from a buffet, however, I would strongly recommend you go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I really didn't think this place was all that great.  None of the food that I ate was particularly very good.  I think the best thing I had were some sort of sweet and sour meatball things.  Everything was just hard, overcooked, or flavorless.  I wasn't really impressed with the options available either.  The saving grace of this place is the BBQ station and the sushi bar.  The bbq looked 1000 times better than YC's Mongolian freeze-dried junk.  The sushi was decent too.  This place is just middle of the road for me.  I can't blame it for having over-cooked food...it's a buffet.  But still, I've had better."}
{"text":"It was ok. I mean it was about what I expected for a buffet in this part of town. The place was a bit run down because it is a former home town buffet but it's clean. Food was hot and plentiful that's really all I can say because it really all tasted the same."}
{"text":"We came here based on the previous review and are glad we did. Even for Valentine's Day (yes, we are high-brow), we were seated quickly, and even with the large number people in the restaurant, the buffet was never empty. The selections were typical of most buffets but I found everything to be tasty. I didn't have anything from the Mongolian BBQ but I thought that was a great option. I also thought the prices were reasonable. For two adults, we paid $24 for two buffets and two drinks. Wait, now that I think about it, we were overcharged a drink! Nice....My only issue with this place (besides the recent revelation that we were overcharged) was the service. We asked for a highchair, when seated, which was never brought until our drinks arrived and we had to ask again. Also, we had asked for a child's milk which arrived in the biggest cup they had. Picture a 2 year old drinking milk out of those large plastic Coke cups and the prospects are dismal. It was apparent there was a language barrier but common sense should overcome the barrier and dictate that the toddler needs a special chair and special cup. This occurred a few more times when we had to ask for napkins, a cup of water in a chilod's cup, extra silverware, etc. He didn't clear our plates as quickly as I would have liked but it was Valentine's Day and they were very busy. I didn't mind because of it. Other than the service, we were glad that we came. Our other favorite buffet is Crazy Buffet in Tempe which is alot further away. Great China Buffet is 10 minutes away and just as good!"}
{"text":"I'm dating a Chinese dude, and we eat at some of the country's finest and most delicious Asian restaurants.  I feel pretty qualified to pass judgements on Chinese restaurants, especially with my main man by my side.  :)  That being said, I have definitely had better.  Now, a friend took me out to lunch here, so I'm not going to complain.  However, my honest feedback is that the lunch buffet is of pretty low quality ingredients and low to medium temperatures.  If you want your food hot, I'd such a later time of day perhaps.  I felt compelled to stick to the sushi after two failed plates full of fried, slightly cold food.  The sushi is a-ok.  :)  Hey, there aren't alot of options in East Mesa, so the price for even just the sushi makes it pretty darn affordable!"}
{"text":"I think the only reason I am giving this buffet 3 stars is because their Mongolian style BBQ was pretty awesome and they have my beloved Chinese Donuts!!!  The food selection here is pretty impressive.  If you've ever been in a Hometown/Old Country Buffet, just imagine all of those food troughs covered in Asian food.  I tried a little bit of everything that looked good to me, and that amounted to about 15 different items.  I wasn't too impressed, but I quite enjoyed the honey chicken.  The rest of the food was just really flavorless and the chicken and broccoli left a really gross film in my mouth after I ate it.  Since I wasn't feeling the buffet I went over to the BBQ area.  They have lots of good stuff to choose from, including shrimp!, but I narrowed it down to a few items.  They have the create your own sauce thing, but none of it is labeled, so you have to guess and kind of stab away in the dark. I waited FOREVER to get someone over there to cook my food, but once it was done and i ate it, it was really good.  We won't be back for a few reasons and there are a ton of other Chinese buffets to demolish first."}
