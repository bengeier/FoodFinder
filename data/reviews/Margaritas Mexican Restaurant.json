{"text":"I have no idea how this place has such a high rating lol. The margs sucked and the food was v v v v average at best. If you are going here to eat a basket of chips and then leave, five stars. Everything past the chips is a let down."}
{"text":"Four is maybe generous, but we have been twice now and been pretty pleased both times.   First off, I really like how professionally dressed the waitstaff is. No leggings, short shorts or bed head in site. The waiters are neat, clean and well groomed. The interior is clean and well done.   Out of our two visits, we've only had one big disappointment and that was the chile relleno. That is my go to at every Mexican restaurant I've ever been to and I've never had know quite like Margarita's. It was a boiled pepper with zero batter and then stuffed with plain, unseasoned ground beef. It was not good at all - taste or texture wise. Enchiladas, fajitas and other choices have all been standard for this type of place.   Honestly, there aren't great choices for Mexican in Fort Mill so you probably can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"My family and I came here for the first time today for lunch after hearing many good things about it. The service was amazing, the decor and atmosphere is great, and the food is SO fresh and absolutely AMAZING!!!! It was so good that even though I was full I still didn't leave anything on my plate. The prices are also very very good for the amount of food you get and the quality. I will definitely be coming here a lot. Really hoping the Indian Land location will be just as good as this one!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten here several times since they opened. It is a very nicely appointed restaurant, and we like their food. With that being said, tonight was the second time we've waited to be acknowledged by wait staff for at least 10 minutes. Tonight was a Pre Cinco de Mayo party and it was crowded. But we had to flag someone down for service. My husband recently went for lunch and ended up leaving because he wasn't acknowledged and he had a meeting to attend. Food is good, but service needs work."}
{"text":"Let me preface this with, \"We are from Phoenix, so finding good Mexican food is rough in North Carolina\". Having said that, we've hit quite a few Mexican food establishments in the months that we've been here. None have come close to our standards in Southwestern Mexican food. That was until today. Margaritas was great, best Pastor Tacos in NC. The California Burrito was pretty good too. The description of nacho cheese topping put me off a bit, so I ordered it on the side. Turns out, it was really good. Should be renamed Queso Blanco instead, more inviting. Hubby had the Mexican Gin & Tonic, it was very refreshing! We look forward to coming back & trying more dishes."}
{"text":"The service was horrible! The waitress charged me extra for the margarita I ordered without upgrading the tequila. There was an up charge to have one of each taco and then when they were brought to me they were not served as the menu stated. The person who claimed to be the manager argued with me and the bathroom was dirty!"}
{"text":"Drinks are great, they even have a gigantic margarita that truly is gigantic!  Friendly greeting, super attentiveness by staff.  Chips are hot thin and perfectly salted, we ordered hot cheese dip, the table salsa is a little spicy.   Ordered beef tips and got shredded meat,  like a tender pot roast in my quesadilla.  Was supposed to get beans, rice was tasty.  Next visit will be the 29.99 gigantic drink, just because.   99"}
{"text":"We took the family here on Sunday for dinner. We had a really nice experience. We were greeted and sat right away. Our waiter so super nice and knowledgeable, he checked on us sufficiently as well. He made sure my kids were happy, that makes me happy :)  The restaurant itself is beautiful inside, I can't even believe what it used to look like when it was Regent Park Cafe. I mean... a major step up. The decor is perfect.  The food was really good as well. I got the Chimichanga, like always. It holds up really well, I wish it came with rice but that's my own issue. My kids both got the kids taco with rice and beans... they LOVED it. I'll post a picture to prove it! The my mom and husband had no complaints either, everything was yummy. Fresh Guacamole... what!! Made table side, my kids thought it was so cool. Bonus, it was delish.  The margaritas were my favorite, not weak at all and delicious. Just how I like them. I will absolutely be back here. I can't wait for happy hour, I'm going to tackle that next."}
{"text":"Awesome new restaurant in our area. The food is fabulous and the service very top of the chart. We go there often and recommend frequently."}
{"text":"Very authentic food and the jumbo margarita amazing! I really enjoyed my first visit!"}
{"text":"Have been waiting for this restaurant to open. We went Sunday after church, going in the atmosphere was not that great but was greeted and seated. The waitress was ok but not very well versed on menu and not that helpful. When we got the food it was cold seemed to have set longer in window than it should have, finally got someone to take the food back, couldnot find our waitress. When the food came back the plate was hot but not the food, I would rather have hot food instead of the plate. Hope the restaurant gets better, maybe this happened because it had opened on Friday. I will give it another try in a couple weeks."}
{"text":"We came for dinner to try out the new place in the neighborhood. Service was great but the food is not like we get at other more authentic Mexican restaurants in town. The portions are small and every combo does not come with rice and beans. Chips are on the thicker side and the salsa is thin.  Not sure this will be our new fav place"}
{"text":"This place is bomb af. The flavors burst in your mouth. Food is seasoned so well. I was pleasantly surprised. Not a mediocre Mexican place by any means. Although if you suffer from anxiety like I do then the humongous menu size may stress you out. There are literally 8 million options to choose from."}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday afternoon. Not too busy but not slow either. I was greeted immediately and taken to a table. My drink and chips came out within minutes of placing the order.  I had the Nachos del Mar. They rocked!!!! The shrimp was cooked perfectly and the entire things was over the top amazing.  The server seemed a little confused as twice he started to ask a question but changed his mind and left. It didn't matter. Great food. Great service.   First visit and I can say I love this place and will be back."}
{"text":"Great food and the staff was great too! I love the Mexican music l as it completes the atmosphere. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here to celebrate my birthday. He is not a fan of Mexican food but really liked this place. It was Friday night and fairly busy but they fit us in pretty quick. I loved the guacamole made table side! My husband had the Texas rice which was also great. Hope this place sticks around because it's our new go to for Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Wow...  what a shock.  This has always been a stark mom and pop place.  The new decor is fantastic!  The menu covers all the Mexican favorites as well as a few that are difficult to find.  Service was prompt and friendly.  Food was good, salsa and chips were good.  They have done a wonderful job of putting all aspects together, while no part was mind blowing, it is a complete dining experience.  I hope they continue at this level."}
{"text":"Very good. Beans were quite thin though.  Rice was a hit with my family. Service was fast.   Nice decor and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Ol√®! I love this place. I usually judge a new restaurant after two visits, and this place earned a solid 5-star review on all aspects. If the establishment is named after a beverage, have that beverage, and so I did. The house margarita was the same delicious concoction on both occasions. Table chips and salsa are amazing as well. First trip, I had arroz con pollo, and it was outstandingly flavorful, fresh, with delicious morsels of chicken (my husband had the same dish and he raves about it as well). Second trip, I chose the tamales and my husband had one of their burritos. We were once again thrilled with our meals. Service is wonderful, personable, and fast. While you're there, check out the fixtures and decor. Really top notch."}
{"text":"Wish I could give this no stars! I made it to go order and the man was so rude for no reason  I just couldn't believe it! When I ordered things verbatim off the menu he told me that they don't serve that . It says \" large crunchy flour tortilla \" he acted like there was something wrong with me and just got worse from there . I'll never go back here and I will tell everyone I know not to as well. I haven't even tried the food yet but I know nothing could go with this bad taste in my mouth that was left by the horrid customer service and they didn't give me one of the items that they were supposed to in my combo platter . They charged me for three items and only gave me two."}
{"text":"very good food.service was great too.love the new decor much better than the place that was in there before.we will be back."}
{"text":"Wow!!! This place is legit! I've been here twice in 10 days and both visits have been fantastic!   Service.... superb! Friendly and helpful and not at all pushy or dismissive.  They know the menu, they offer recommendations and they haven't been wrong yet.  The drinks, strong.  Great margaritas and cocktails.  The food... OMG soooooo good! I had the Pina Burrito on my first visit and almost cried out of happiness into my plate.  Second visit I had the Chipotle Enchiladas, also amazing.  The fajita burritos are also the bomb!!!!   I love the decor! The light fixtures are so cool and you'd almost never believe this used to be a counter diner.  Great sculptures and so so clean!  Please give this place a try!!! It's a must!!! Ask for Ely, he's the best!"}
{"text":"So good! Chips were fresh and warm. Guac was incredible. Had the Yolanda's and they were very good. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Good Food and Happy Atmosphere !! Great place for a little fun and Gorgeous Decor  Would of given it five stars if the service was a bit more attentive ...  I do think you should try this place and enjoy a happy, energetic meal with friends and family."}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time today. Went at lunch - order the Fajita Texana.  As for the food - great chips! But that's about the end.  The steak had gristle and fat and truly wasn't edible. Chicken was cooked so long that it was hard. Peppers and onions were overdone and stewed.  Staff is friendly and nice interior. But the food just wasn't good at all."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch.  I love the decor.  The food was good.  Not exactly traditional Mexican but very good.  Great lunch prices.  I'd really like to try dinner."}
{"text":"Just no. Do yourself a favor and hit Taco Bell. It's not Mexican or Tex Mex or Mexican American. It's just not good. Chips and salsa were OK, so I had thought that might be an OK sign, but the meal went downhill fast. Husband had a combo with a taco, chalupa and tostada. Besides the taco, not sure which was supposed to be which. Flour tortilla with meat and cheese sauce on one. Tostada shell on the other with beans and lettuce. I ordered carnitas, which I love, but these were gray and had an off taste. Waiter offered a to-go box, but I didn't want to take it home."}
{"text":"The Food it's awesome great service and the best margaritas we will be back  very clean"}
