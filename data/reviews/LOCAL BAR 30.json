{"text":"When we first walked in, it was somewhat busy.  Unfortunately, there seemed to be only one bartender actually working.  There was a younger girl seen behind the bar randomly taking things at times but she didn't really do anything or serve anyone. (Side note: here were a COUPLE of people, not myself I will add, that saw the younger bartender doing what can only be described as a drug deal in the parking lot and then was seen in a vehicle \"shooting up\" which makes me concerned about my credit card info being held behind the bar for my tab.)  So, needless to say, ordering drinks took anywhere from 5 to 20 minutes.  It took 20 minutes to order food and 1 hour to get the food (burger, fries and a dozen wings).  When the food was ready, the older bartender basically \"threw\" it down on the table in front of someone else and walked away without saying anything.  The fries were half burnt and the wings were cold.  I also ordered a pop and there was mold in the ice AGAIN! (This was our 2nd time here in a month and we made it a point to the bartender that the ice machine most likely needs to be cleaned out last time.  Apparently, it's not important to them.)"}
{"text":"Went to this bar for the first time last night to hear our friends' band. We only had drinks so can't comment on the food. This place desperately needs better curb appeal, but the inside was a nice looking neighborhood bar with friendly clientele. There was only one barmaid working, Natalie, but she did a great job keeping up with the crowd and was friendly and professional as well. Would not hesitate to return."}
{"text":"Nice place. Rock n roll decor, live music, and a good variety of beers. Service was great.ample parking and easy to get to."}
{"text":"What a joke!  They say they have a kitchen but is only open when their cook decides to show up.   Went there for a Jam, lots of people, again no food.  One bartender......Guess how long it took for her to get us a drink.
You people bitch about the bar business, but you don't have a good staff, not consistent, bad service and wonder why you lose money.  Get involved or close up.   This place sucks!!   Going to be a long, long time before we go back.  Tried to call the Bar for information and a drunk guy answers the phone and we listen to his crap, before he hung up on us.  So unprofessional its disturbing.   Again, run your bar and know whats going on in it."}
