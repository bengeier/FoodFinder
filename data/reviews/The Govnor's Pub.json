{"text":"I could not have had a different experience than Jazz. 

I have been here 3 times, The Bar Tender Serj, polite gentleman with a accent, was very cordial and managed the busy quaint bar well. I've had 3 daily specials there, Halibut sandwich and genuine english chips were fantastic, meat pie was way above average and likely the best I've had, and the chicken wings were very nicely done. All the meals took some time, but not a long time to arrive, the reward was in the freshly cooked English style fare. 

Pints were a shade over 5 bucks. 

There are locals here, in a bit of a Industrial Area with older homes built in the 60's and 70's in a nearby subdivision. The feel was like a pub in working class area in any big city, very entertaining conversations. Certainly not high brow!

Definately stopping again. This place is worthy of supporting what I suspect is a well thought out Family owned pub, great place for a pint and a plate if you are passing by. \"Hole in the Wall\" size with a oversized Heart."}
{"text":"This is a neighbour pub in an industrial area of Brampton. It's operated by an owner/operator & his family. We were served by the owner & he seemed to be a very nice fellow. The vodka/soda we decent & we also ordered a chicken fingers & fries as a snack. The fingers were decent but not house made but the fries were delicious & WERE house made. If the owner picks up this review DON'T stop making your fries that way. A decent little pub & no complaints."}
{"text":"Horrible service! One time ordered wings and when I bit into it, there was blood. So I haven't ordered in a while. Then I gave them a second try and I got soup, where the container was filled up HALF WAY! I called and said something and they said that's the serving. It was not worth it for its price at all! Never argue with a customer."}
