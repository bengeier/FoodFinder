{"text":"Horrible.  Why Food and Wine would give them a good rating is beyond me.  Pizza was dry with very little sauce.  Dough was dry and tasteless.  Very pricey to match.  Goes to show that if you pay for a good rating you get it with nothing to back it up.  Would not go back."}
{"text":"The veggie pizza was amazing! But the person at the register was kind of rude. And by the looks of it, two of my family members didn't like their food, anyway. This place was......eh."}
{"text":"I love the menu at Phipps. Everything is freshly grown and the ingredients open your eyes to some new foods. Last time I went, I had a vegan rueben. I am not vegan but love a good rueben. To my surprise it was quite tasty. Great place!"}
{"text":"Whether you are visiting Phipps or work in Oakland, this is a spot you need to check out for lunch. I heard the hype around this place and have been meaning to check it out so when I had some out of town guests visiting this was the perfect place to take them. It also helped that it was a 70 degree day in November and we were able to sit outside at their patio tables to eat. The menu has soup, salad, sandwiches and pizza to choose from.  They also serve beer and wine-who would have thought!  I went with the chicken Panini sandwich which comes with cheese, field greens and apples.  You have your choice of a few healthly sides and I went with the bruschetta salad which was a mix of fresh salsa and cabbage (almost like coleslaw).  Everything was super fresh and very tasty.  Others in my party got the pizza which is about the size of a plate and ordered a cup of soup as a starter.  They typically have at least 3 soups to choose from and both the tomatoes and squash were favorites at our table.  Also love that they have a lunch combo which you can get a cup of soup or half a salad with half of most of their sandwiches. The prices all range from $8-$10 and the portion sizes are perfect.  Once you order make sure to grab a table and they will bring out your food once ready. On a busy Friday afternoon our orders came out very quickly!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite cafes with an outdoor seating area. The view of the adjacent gardens was beautiful. The staff was friendly and we were served our food quickly. I enjoyed the apple havarti panini with fruit salad. All the food is super fresh and flavorful."}
{"text":"The mushroom bruschetta and vegan chili was very very tasty.  The soup tasted so fresh and had the perfect seasoning.  The mushroom bruschetta was almost 5 stars.  But the bread was burnt on the one side which made it really tough to eat.  But the flavors of the mushrooms with the onions and balsamic had a great flavor and consistency of the ingredients.  I wasn't expecting such a tasty meal while going to look at plants lol."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Café Phipps, and eating here is always a treat. Combined with an actual trip into Phipps, and a meal here can easily be part of a perfect afternoon or evening.  The cafe itself is a lovely, bright, colorful part of Phipps' main lobby and floor. In my experience it's always been well maintained, i.e kept very clean with plants and candles put out on the tables. The framed photos of fields and fresh produce hanging on the walls just complete the cafe's fresh and vibrant look and feel.  While the menu itself (and the ingredients of what's sold here) often changes with the season and availability of produce, the general idea of the menu is always the same - you can order or mix-and-match soups, salads, sandwiches, a couple entree-items at times, and a quiche of the day. There are also usually smaller bites and side dishes like fruit cups, as well as dessert options like cupcakes. And as far as I know, all of the items are made from fresh, organic, and local ingredients, or brought in from local vendors.  And I have to say, nothing here has let me down. The soups in particular always impress me - you can tell that their tomato soup is freshly made and it's always very think and pulpy; I feel healthier and happier just looking at it! Their salads are always a lovely blend of veggies and dressing (and meat if you opt for it, although Phipps is very vegetarian friendly), and the sandwiches have been perfectly toasted and to die for in my experience. Honestly it's impossible for me to leave without a smile on my face after eating here, the ingredients used are just so wonderful and perfect together.  Oh, and since Phipps is one of the green leaders in town, it should come as no surprise that they aim to recycle and compost the few dishes and silverware items that can't be washed and reused.  I seriously have no complaints about this little eatery. The best part about the cafe is that a visit to Phipps, while recommended, is not required. So if you want a healthy and/or tasty meal, this is definitely the place to go!"}
{"text":"A great place to ear, sip wine & unwind after spending a day at the Phipps Conservatory. Had their Quiche & Cuban Sandwich which came with Faroe salad. Both outstanding. They did also have vegan choices. Vegan chili was delicious."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem and you should eat here even if you aren't touring the conservatory. We ended up here accidentally because the restaurant across the street where we intended to go was closed for a private party.   All of the menu items are perfect for lunch - filling, but not huge and healthful without being annoying.   I had a salad and sandwich combo. The salad was supposed to have chicken, but they forgot to put it on. When I asked one of the staff, she cheerfully apologized and very quickly brought me the chicken.   I had my 10-year-old niece with me and she was able to find something on the menu (an almond butter and berry sandwich) that she enjoyed and I could feel good about giving to her.   Right across the street (behind the other restaurant) is an access point to the Schenley Park trail where we went for a hike after lunch. It was perfect!"}
{"text":"Love the food here. Wasn't real sure about the \"healthy\" menu, but have been quite surprised. No, it's not a fancy place --- it's a cafe, not a full restaurant. Have tried a variety of soups, and sandwiches, been pleased with everything.(how is it possible to make a vegan Reuben that tasted better than the real thing?)"}
{"text":"I ate here a lot due to its proximity to CMU. The food is almost always good, though there were a few misses. The desserts tend to be a little too sweet, or rich, or dry. The salads are very good. They had a tuna melt which I practically lived off of since it was big enough to make two meals, but last time I checked they took it off the menu. I would avoid the pizza if they have it."}
{"text":"Cafe Phipps has a very upscale cafeteria like vibe.  Located adjacent to the gardens of Phipps, the location is really nice in that you can hit this place up before or after you check out Phipps.  We came here for happy hour on a Friday and were pleased with the limited, yet, extremely tasty drink and food options.  In particular, the fried mushroom/cheese balls were tremendous.  Pricing was extremely fair.  It's essentially self-serve, which isn't a bad thing.  Just don't come here expecting a tremendously upscale dining experience.  It's low key and simple, yet clean and efficient.  All in all, unless you're coming here to check out the Conservatory, I wouldn't go out of your way to make it to this spot."}
{"text":"This place is surprisingly good!  My family and I were captive customers, having already ponied up for pay-parking and having paid our admission to Phipps.  Then we got hungry.  They have a nice menu, with plenty of fresh items, NOT the standard frozen chicken nuggets and hot-dogs.  I had some vegetarian chili that was very good, and came with some interesting flat-bread instead of crackers.  My kids enjoyed their lunches, as did my wife.  Overall, this is a solid choice, so do not hesitate to give it a try and let us all know what you think."}
{"text":"ridiculously over priced. spent $12 on two double espressos. the girl working didn't know the difference between chai and latte. would never recommend as a cafe."}
{"text":"Absolutely delightful menu!  Gourmet, anything but ordinary.  Quite enjoyable after touring Phipps Conservatory, the jewel of Pittsburgh. Only one tiny request - please carry butter."}
{"text":"I've been consistently impressed with the fresh healthy salads, panini, pizza, and soup. Fresh ingredients, nice flavors, and they also have beer and wine. As an added perk, special bins for recycling and composting. This is one of the best places to get a salad in Oakland."}
{"text":"When the Phipps made great strides on becoming more green and sustainable, they also made a commitment to making the Cafe more healthy and environmentally friendly.  The foods are locally sourced, the menu items are organic and thoughtfully prepared.   For example, it's hard to find healthy options for children, however the Phipps has gotten rid of their high sugar drinks in favor of healthier options.    The soups are quite wonderful, and so are the salads.   The Cafe is careful about recycling, too, which I find to be a thoughtful touch.   The sunshine streams into the glass walls, this cafe is a good place to change your mood to positive."}
{"text":"I wanted to like my meal here, I really did.  But it was really lackluster for me.  I ordered the vegetarian sandwich with a side of the jalapeno corn salad.  It also comes with cole-slaw.  The sandwich was only \"ok\".  I like roasted veggies, but the whole wheat sandwich bread didn't do it for me.  For a deli turkey, perhaps, but when you have just roasted veggies without anything \"meaty\" like a giant portabella cap or fatty like avocado, low-profile bread is a let-down and would really be better off on something thicker like ciabatta or foccacia.  Also, it soaked up the juice from the slaw and the mushroom salad that I received by mistake, and soggy bread is just no bueno on any occasion.  Because I'm not that fussy and it was busy, I didn't say anything about receiving the mushroom salad instead of the jalapeno corn salad, and that's on me.  I do like mushrooms very much, but unfortunately the flavor profile of this salad wasn't balanced enough.  It was so heavy on the vinegar that it overwhelmed the plate.  The slaw was the same--mostly just vinegar and no mayo or oil and not enough sugar (if any) to balance the taste.  If I ever went back, I would probably just try something else, because some of the dishes looked great (the salmon salad being one of them), and the price wasn't *too* horrific for a museum setting."}
{"text":"Though it's been while since I've been here, I used to come here with a friend who needed to eat gluten free sometimes.  Although I'm not too big on salads in general, I've really enjoyed the salads I've ordered here.  All of them have been fresh, healthy, and delicious, as well as more creative than those I've ordered from some other local establishments serving salads.  I've also really enjoyed the fruit juices I've ordered here, which are always squeezed fresh.  I appreciate their emphasis on local, in season ingredients, which fits in well with Phipps's theme.  The recycling and composting, as others have mentioned, do too.  The ambiance is bright and clean, given that it's part of the greenhouse itself.  My only complaint is that it can sometimes be difficult to get a table during peak lunch hours, but this problem is nearly ubiquitous in Oakland.  Overall, a great option for people who attend or work at Pitt or CMU who desire a healthy lunch option."}
{"text":"Maybe it's the jet lag, maybe it's because neither Mom nor I liked what we ordered. But I've gotta dock Cafe Phipps a star.   My husband Rick and I had been away for a week in Hong Kong and my mom wanted to take me out to lunch when I returned.   Shame Mom and I normally love Cafe Phipps, and since Mom has a membership at the Phipps Conservatory, she comes here a lot.  Anyway, Mom ordered the turkey meatball sub with a side of citrus coleslaw and she didn't like it one bit.  I think my mom forgot that she just doesn't like turkey meatballs, turkey sausages, turkey bacon, etc.  As for me, I went for the grilled vegetable wrap which was decent but wildly unspectacular.  And I should have ordered a side of that citrus coleslaw.  But nope, I went for the lentil salad.  I like lentil soup but I'd never had lentil salad before.  And I discovered one thing...........  I hate cold lentils!    Yuck!    I tried forcing them down, 'cos I don't believe in wasting food, but to no avail!  So ya, Mom and I will come back, but now we know what to avoid here!"}
{"text":"I was really excited about this menu...   Everything looked fresh and delicious and I was pumped to have some healthy options.  The execution of this menu, though, fell a little short.     I ordered a salad and a sandwich and a glass of wine.  The salad was quinoa, apples, lettuce, cheese, etc.  It was under-dressed and under-seasoned, but otherwise a good concept.   The sandwich was really where I had the problem.  The menu description didn't really say either way, but I sort of expected it to be hot since it was a grilled chicken variety.   It was served cold, though, which was fine.  What wasn't fine was the ratio of fixins to bread.  Way off.  I could barely taste the meat, sauce, etc. - there just wasn't enough of it and there was entirely too much bread.  And I am a bread lover, so that is saying something.  All of my companions who ordered sandwiches had the same problem.   Those who ordered soup fared better - the soups all got good reviews.  The quiche also looked really good.  I just can't get past that skimpy sandwich though.    As far as seating, it was definitely limited.  I snagged a table in the back next to some really LOUD families.   It's a café, so I didn't mind it.   There were a lot of people waiting for seats though.    Overall, a decent lunch place (skip the sandwiches though).  Not really a dinner vibe for me."}
{"text":"I had an overall tasteless experience ( other than the only taste being distasteful. The Turkey sandwich  was tasteless, other than the strong bitterness of the vegetables on the sandwich. The quinoa salad( which I didn't order in the first place) tastes like rubber and a hint of brine at the first bite,and the strong coleslaw side was equal to that of the quinoa salad. Their aim is healthy eating but I guess that way is to not eat the Turkey sandwich or the others mentioned"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for the Cafe at Phipps because I had heard a lot of great thins about it.  I am wondering if it was \"good\" just because of local ingredients and no \"bad for you\" food rather then actually being a place people loved for the taste and service.  We arrived shortly before 2:00 on a Sunday.  Apparently at 2:00, you can no longer order anything from the menu other than the pizzas.  This meant the selections were limited to prepackaged salads, sandwiches and soups.  I was disappointed because there were several sandwiches I was trying to decide between.  There was nothing on the website or in writing at the cafe that showed there was a limited menu at a certain point.  I might expect that if you come in at 4 (when Phipps closes at 5) that they would limit it, but why three hours before closing time?    Beverage choices are limited to the \"Pittsburgh Seltzer\" or a coffee bar.  The options sounded great - various fruit flavors such as orange and pineapple mixed with seltzer water. However, the day we were there they were out of seltzer, so for the same price, we got very minimally flavored tap water.  I chose the orange pineapple and I'm sure it would have been better with the seltzer and right amount of flavor.  However, there was very little juice added so it lacked flavor.  I drank it anyway, but I heard at least two people go back up and ask for more juice to be added.    I chose the grilled chicken and poached pear salad.  It was served with greens, cucumbers, tomatoes and of course, pears.  It had a pear vinaigrette dressing.  I enjoyed the salad, but it was nothing special, especially for the $9 price tag.  I was glad I don't eat tomatoes, because the ones in my salad were soggy and limp.  It did make me wonder how long the pre made salad had been sitting in the cooler.  My husband ordered the Margherita pizza.  He enjoyed it, but said the dough was grainy and wished there was more cheese.  I also tried the carrot soup.  It was good but certainly not the best I've ever had.  It was a large portion size which was nice.    Overall, not a bad experience, but I expected more, especially for the price."}
{"text":"A nice option for a bite to eat at the park, the cafe serves a nice range of salads, sandwiches, soups and pizzas and has a welcome number of vegetarian options. The prices are quite reasonable for a museum/tourist site cafe and the eating area is clean and welcoming. They also use biodegradable cups and forks, and compost their waste, which is nice to see. They also focus on organic, local food. Though my salad wasn't anything super special, it was tasty enough and I'd happily go back to support Phipps and its cafe."}
{"text":"This place seems favored by many people because of its fresh and healthy food. But I really has no feeling for it... The salads have nothing special; the amount of the Phipps Special I ordered is just as much as appetizer in other cafe or so, and taste really bad...(I can't remember the name); the fruit cup is very small and thus pricy. I expected there will be juice in this healthy place, but nope..they gave me soda...the only thing seems ok is the pizza my friend order...Well"}
{"text":"The Phips Cafe is decent. They have options for soups, sandwiches, and even some homey foods. Unfortunately, the quality of the food is to be desired. Most of the time I get soggy wraps or greasy sandwiches and I am pretty sure I can get that anywhere else in oakland for half the price. I gave them 3 stars because they claim most of their foods are organic but  overall the quality/price index is very low."}
{"text":"We decided to eat here based on previous Yelp reviews. I have to say I was a little disappointed. There is an awkward cafeteria-type bar set up with a separate coffee/drink bar to the right. A fair beverage warning: they do not serve regular soda, lemonade, or sweet tea at the Cafe Phipps. On the plus side you can get a beer. :-)  I had a bowl of tomato basil soup that was fresh and delicious. It came withe some homemade breadsticks, also yummy. I also had a really decent cappuccino. So, while I though the cafe was fine, I just wish that it also catered to more plebian tastes like...Diet Coke."}
{"text":"Sitting here watching one of the counter staff wipe her nose on her shirt collar the pick at her nose with her fingers. This is scary."}
{"text":"Based purely on customer service, can't say much about the food. Yelp stated they're open but their small sign in the corner stated different hours of operation. Before I noticed it though, I was in line, as the staff walked by and chuckled and not having the common courtesy of telling anyone they weren't open yet. You could already tell the staff were people that would find pleasure from such a trivial thing."}
{"text":"I actually thought Cafe Phipps was pretty good and would eat here again when visiting Phipps. Reminds me of a smaller version of Panera Bread with salad, soup and sandwich options. Order places at the counter and brought to the table. We were served quickly even though they were busy. Prices approximately $7-$10 a person with water to drink. Environmentally friendly. Would eat here again."}
{"text":"Cafe Phipps located inside the Phipps Conservatory on the main level is offering a fixed price menu of 4 courses on Friday nights during the month of March for 65.00 per person which includes the dinner and admission to the conservatory which stays open til 10pm on Fridays.  The hostess indicated this is something they plan to continue monthly with the menu options varying.  We made reservations and arrived early with no problems getting seated.  They have cordoned off a section of the cafe with a privacy partition for the guests with reservations while keeping the rest open for normal cafe operations.  The tables have tablecloths and the table is nicely set with wine glasses and beautiful napkins.  We started our meal with glasses of wine (price additional to the fixed price meal).  The first course was a warm artichoke and roasted red pepper risotto.  This was delicious and an ample serving.    I should interrupt here just as our diner was interrupted.  Suddenly a fire alarm went off in the building.  Everyone just looked at one another with no one moving.  Ok.... I was taught, as good measure, that one should get their butt up and head to the exit in such a case so I donned my coat and headed out.  I do think the staff should be better instructed to not only get their butts out the door but ensure their patrons do, as well.  That was irksome on a safety level.  Within 15 minutes, the all-clear was given (our server later indicated something in the basement had triggered it).  Anyway, I did my part and my husband followed suit a wee bit after me reluctantly and then we did finally return to our table.  Ok, onto the 2nd course.  The 2nd course was our choice of either a house salad or a mushroom soup.  I selected the salad while my husband opted for the soup.  Both were adequate but I should have asked for additional salad dressing (a vinaigrette)  The 3rd course was the entree -- I opted for the crab cake and asparagus, my husband selected the filet with asparagus.  Both were good.  I can't say the crab cake was like any other I've had, but it was good.  The 4th and final course was dessert -- a warn blueberry cobber with ice cream.  It was good but not as sweet as either of us would have liked.  Afterwards, we had plenty of time to visit the gift shop and the convervatory which was sponsoring orchids and bonsai.    I like this concept of a very nice dinner and journey through the convervatory -- makes for a truly great date night.  Oh, and another plus?  When you are finished with dinner they give you your complementary conservatory ticket and it's good thru the end of the year -- not just that night.  I like that!"}
{"text":"This is a cute place to stop to grab a bite to eat.  We ate here for a tiny snack after our Phipps flower trip, so I cannot fully rate the place because all we got was a Hummus wrap and a green been salad.  However, they were both delicious.  I loved my green beans.  There were onions and cranberries within the green bean salad which added a very delicious part to the plate.  The atmosphere of this place is also fantastic.  It is very trendy and clean.  One can see the cleanness based off the fact there is 5 different kinds of cans for garbage.  Very cool and very trendy.  I wish more places were like this.  I want to come back here and actually have a real lunch, so I can actually have a good opinion, but based on what I experienced, I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"For a cafe attached to a museum/attraction, Cafe Phipps is like a 4.5, if not 5-star establishment.  In comparison to eateries in general, the food is fine but not outstanding.  I love that the cafe uses local, in-season ingredients, and that it composts much of its waste.  Currently, it's one of two Pittsburgh eateries certified by the Green Restaurant Association.    Right now, the cafe has Friday happy hour, from 5-9 pm, which it calls \"Agave Nights,\" in honor of the giant agave plant now at the conservatory.  $4 for margaritas, and $3 for beer, and popcorn shrimp or chicken nachos as food specials.  You can also order off their regular menu (which changes seasonally) up until 7 pm.    The falafel which is currently on the regular menu comes like a burger--as a single patty, on a bun.  The bun would have been better toasted.  I don't know how I felt about the blue cheese dressing on the patty, as opposed to a more traditional yogurt sauce or tahini sauce.  The cole slaw side was good in that the cabbage and carrot were fresh, but overall the slaw was too liquid-y and the random pieces of fruit (pineapple?) was rather strange.  I've also had a mushroom sandwich of some sort in the past here (not on the current menu), which was sort of bland.  I wouldn't eat here unless I was also visiting the conservatory (which I really do recommend), but this is also one of the healthiest places to eat at in Oakland, and probably has the nicest atmosphere of all Oakland food places."}
{"text":"It is reviewed as one of the best museum cafes in the nation, but I was not impressed. I can't comment on the food since I didn't try any, however I tried their iced coffee and the green juice.   As the lady making my green juice was preparing the fruits and vegetables, she did not wash any of the items she was putting into the juicer and did not take the time to remove any stickers, therefore those pesky little stickers went straight into the juicer and made it into my drink! Definitely a turn-off.   The iced coffee was nothing to write home about and looking around at the selection of food from other customers, the portions were small and not very appetizing.   A gorgeous conservatory, but eat and drink before you spend your afternoon in the beautiful Phipps!"}
{"text":"I think this place has the best food and atmosphere of anywhere to eat within easy walking distance of CMU campus.  I have lunch here at least once or twice a week and am hardly ever disappointed.  My favorite thing to order (and, in my opinion, the best bang for your buck) is their quiche of the day.  With that order, you get a generous slice of quiche, your choice of a soup or salad side, and -- at least if you pick a soup side -- it all comes with a refreshing vinegar-based coleslaw (no mayo).  Their quiches are always excellent!  Perfect crust, excellent filling texture, and well chosen mix-ins.  They are also almost always vegetarian.  All of their soups that I have tried have been great!  I especially like the butternut squash soup and tomato fennel, but you really can't go wrong with whatever one strikes your fancy.  I've tried many of their daily soup specials and enjoyed them all.  Soups come with a yummy flatbread triangle for dipping.  Nice salads too.  My favorite is the detox salad!  It's absolutely loaded with super nutritious things, but the ingredients come together well in a way that makes the salad much tastier than it sounds from the list of what's in it!  But...beware, if you order the detox salad as a side to the quiche (and I assume to other mix-and-match options, too), they charge extra.  They didn't tell me this once until after I was rung up and my credit card already swiped, so I was kind of annoyed to have paid $2 extra without being warned.  The environment is very pretty -- go figure, it's in the botanical gardens building.  There is outdoor seating that has a gorgeous view when it's warm enough to sit outside, but the inside feels fresh and clean as well.  It's a nice place to take guests out for lunch if you are limited to the Oakland area.  There is a big chalkboard menu that you can check out when you enter, then you order your food at the checkout counter, they give you a number, and you seat yourself.  When your food is ready, they bring it to you.  There is no room for tipping; I guess service is complimentary.  You bus your own food at the end, and they have lots of different bins to maximize environmental friendliness of the waste process.  Sometimes this place can get extremely crowded from 12-1:30 with lunchers.  I have been on occasions where there were no seats available at all!  Also, it is baby-friendly, so sometimes the space can get cluttered with strollers and toddlers crying, etc.  All in all, I think this place has solid food and am glad to have a place like it in Oakland!"}
{"text":"Cafe Phipps is just an upscale cafeteria housed inside the conservatory of the same name. When we visited on Saturday, we found that our botanical journey made our bellies growl, so we stopped in afterwards.   At the time, they were only serving sandwiches, salads, and soups from their own kitchen along with desserts from Prantl's bakery.   I had the Caesar Chicken Wrap and found that it quelled my cravings and little more. The chicken was a little dry, the dressing sparse, but it met my stomach's needs for the moment.   Kay had a cup of a Potato-Leek soup and allowed me to have a few spoonfuls. While I was impressed with what I tasted, I felt that some garlic would have made it outstanding.   We also got the Triple Threat, which consisted of miniaturized versions of the following pastries: Chocolate Mary Ann, White Chocolate Raspberry Cup, and the legendary Burnt Almond Torte. Stay tuned for a review of Prantl's!"}
{"text":"Cafe Phipps has some of the best food in walking distance of CMU's campus. We take many of our visitors here for lunch.  It is nearly impossible to have an unhealthy or bad tasting meal here. They serve delicious, healthy, organic, local, and fresh ingredients. The menu consists of sandwiches, salads, and soups, and you can get combinations of those. There are vegan options and gluten-free options. For someone with allergies who is trying to eat healthy, it's a dream come true. Don't be afraid to try something new--they get it right here--from quinoa pasta to vegan sandwiches.  They even have a children's menu! The side dishes: a small serving of a fruit AND a veggie. A mom's dream!  Great atmosphere. Clean, modern, hip. Living plants on every table.   They even encourage composting and recycling such that finding an actual \"trash\" can is nearly impossible."}
{"text":"A nice lunch spot in Oakland that is often forgotten about. All the ingredients are very fresh and local. I had the chicken apple panini, with a side of bruschetta salad, and coleslaw. The total came out to be about $10, which considering how expensive panera is now days is not bad.   The panini had chicken, apple compote, arugala, and white cheddar cheese. It was fresh and satisfying. The brushetta was not bad but the red onion was very chunky and overpowering. The coleslaw was also lacking flavor. My friend's chicken meatball looked great, but she said there was a little too much bread.   Overall, a nice lunch place if looking for healthy and fresh sandwiches, soups, and salads."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I just finished touring Phipps Conservatory by day and decided to eat here for lunch. Most of the food is home grown and many of them are healthy options. Pizza is available for all ages.  It is set cafeteria style where you order and you are given a number to put on whatever table you wish to sit. The food is then brought to you. Should you decide to order a beverage then you are given a cup with your purchase and proceed to the drink station to get what you want.  They also serve specialty beverages there but we decided to go with the a healthy option. We each ordered the vegetarian sandwich which came with a choice of side. We opted for the quinoa and slaw. The do have an option for $9.95 where you can order half sandwich and pair it with either a cup of soup or chili without meat or salad.  We got our food served to us in a reasonable amount of time. The food was good to say the least because we don't often get a chance to eat healthy. When we were finished they have a selection of trash and recycle bins as well as one for dishes and silverware. Your food comes with real dishes and silverware which i would call Panera style.  Little did we realize how crowded this place can get if you don't come early. We had arrived shortly after noon.  By the time we were done the place was packed with people! It brought a nice conclusion to seeing Phipps by day during the holiday season because there is so much you miss at night when the lights are on. Still this cafe is a nice place to unwind and take it easy if you don't feel like hunting for another place. Would definitely eat here again whenever we come again."}
{"text":"I've been a vegan for more than 10 years and I'm always excited to try places with vegan menus. This place was a complete disappointment. The tomato basil soup tasted like canned crushed tomatoes with too much basil and the grilled vegetable sandwich that came with it was cold and lacking substance. They put more time and effort into \"sustainability marketing\" than the food. Overpriced and underwhelming."}
{"text":"I was here a couple of times for team lunches. Both the times, I liked the food. It is such a vibrant place! Food is fresh and light, yet filling. The last time I was here I ordered roasted veggie sandwich with chick pea salad. I liked the food and I am sure I will go back again.  Things to remember: 1) They are busy during lunch hours and you should be prepared to wait for at least 10 minutes for your food to arrive. 2) If you are planning to go in a group, make sure you are there before the rush hour to easily find a table for everyone at one place. 3) Don't hesitate to order the bbq sliders if they are offering, my colleagues were happy with the sliders they ordered."}
