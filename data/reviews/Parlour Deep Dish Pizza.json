{"text":"Pizza came warm (about 55 minutes from ordering online) and was extremely tasty. The sauce actually had flavour (unlike every other pizza in Toronto) and the crust was nice and buttery. I am so glad downtown Toronto finally has a decent pizza."}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try this pizza for a while, but waited so that the place could iron out their kinks and get their delivery and timing of food execution in order.  

We were hungry but were unsure of the size of the pizza, so we played it safe and ordered 1 pizza and a few sides just to make sure that if it was smaller, it would be ok because of the extra sides.  

Here's what we ordered..  

1 classic deep dish pizza     $25.00
1 order romaine hearts         $12.00
1 order of garlic bread           $10.00
1 order of crispy artichokes  $12.00

Subtotal  $59.00  
Discount  $0.00  
Delivery  $6.95  
Credit  $0.00  
HST  $8.57  
Total  $74.52

tip for driver $8  MANDATORY ON BILL!!!
total = $83

Everything came on time, which was a blessing after dealing with orderit.ca last time, and we were excited to try it!

When we opened the take out bags the disappointment was evident..

First the salad was super uninspiring, very few pieces of \"burnt\" pancetta, some romaine leaves, a few croutons, and some shredded Parmesan.  Dressing came on the side which is good.   The size of the salad was super disappointing.   for $12, i expected enough salad for 2 people,  what i got was a typically small Caesar salad portion that would be somewhere in line with mamma's pizza small size portion for $3.95.

the second thing we tried was the garlic bread with cheese.  basically a half chiabatta loaf rubbed with garlic oil/butter and sprinkled minimally with cheese..  flavour was ok,  just was very dried out.   $10 for this seemed steep,  maybe at a $7 value, again  ive had better bread elsewhere for $5-$7.

Third thing we tried was the crispy artichokes.  My partner was super excited to have these and looking forward to it.   When we opened the takeout box, we were super disappointed.   I expected some heat loss and some of the crispness to disappear in transit, but we got a sopping wet bunch of slimey/greasey artichokes.   I get that heat and a takeout container will make something crispy go soggy,  but it was 1 giant clump of soggy bland artichokes.  for $12    a big miss....  the container was pooling grease at the bottom too.

Lastly we got to the pizza..   and it was burnt..   sides were charred and dried, and it looked like the filling had slid to one side of the pizza in transit or in cooking(like the chef yanked too hard while pulling out of oven).
The top was blackened in places, and dried out on the crusts.   I get that a high temp oven, and the pans they cook in will need to be high temp to giva crispy crust,  but it was overcooked on top and sides, and soggy and undercooked on bottom.. it fell apart when trying to pick up..      the toppings were underwhelming..   the ground sausage was all clumped together,and cold.. kind of off putting texture at that temperature.    tomato sauce was bland and left wanting for some sort of herb flavour to be added..  cheese was soggy too.

the size of the pizza was about 10 inches, so 6 slices, for $25.   the blue label 2lb chicago style deep dish pizza from loblaws was better in comparison

we called orderit.ca right away upon looking at the pizza and everything else.    They put us on hold while they contacted Parlour,   explained we werent happy with the pizza, and order.   The customer rep at orderit.ca came back on the phone and stated that the \"cook\"  at Parlour said it was supposed to be that way, and that was that!  The end of our complaint.  Neither orderit.ca nor Parlour were interested in fixing the problem.  

I have pictures to post  from my blackberry of pizza and takeout box full of grease from artichokes.  I will post those later.. 

At the end of the day,  only half the pizza was edible, the salad was tiny and cheap, the bread was dry and overpriced, and the artichokes were greasy.  

We will not be ordering from Parlour again as they fleeced us for quality, fleeced us for cost, and made no effort to even attempt to make up for the poor quality. 

takeout failure 101..  make it right,    basic restaurant practice.. and coming from the backers of Parlour, i expected more."}
{"text":"I love deep dish and was extremely excited to hear that a deep dish pizza place was opening in Toronto. I placed an order on Oct 21 for their classic pie through the orderit.ca website (the only way you can purchase). Website said my pie would arrive in 1 hour. My pie did not arrive in this timeframe making me worried that my order was lost. No phone number listed to call Parlour so that I could check on my order. My pie finally arrived after 1 hour and 20 minutes (20 minutes later than expected). 

The pie was cold, very cold. I had to put it in the oven to heat it up to an edible temperature. This was very disappointing. It is possible that the pie would have been tasty if it arrived hot and on time but, unfortunately, this was not the case.

I contacted Parlour to let them know of my experience and they apologized. They told me that they were aware of problems and delays from orderit.ca due to other complaints and were working with them to resolve these issues. They offered to credit me for another pie and give them another chance.

I ordered another pie 3 weeks later. This time I chose the vegetarian pie. It arrived exactly when it was scheduled and it was hot. Pie was tasty but too tomatoey for my liking. I wouldn't choose this variety again but would give the classic another try.

I'm hoping that they can work out all the kinks and that a consistent quality and service standard is met. 

Also, the delivery charge from orderit.ca is quite high. I'd definitely order more if there was a pick up option. Orderit.ca is making a killing."}

the end."}
