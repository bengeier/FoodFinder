{"text":"The food is fantastic. I highly recommend the Cornish Hen, you have to try any of the scratch made breads or pastries. The Cesar salad is amazing and light. The fresh cucumber tomato and feta salad is huge and great.  They also have a great selection of Georgian wines. For desert anything is amazing but my favourite is the Napoleon, perfect and not too sweet."}
{"text":"Disappointing food and service.  Something straight out of Kitchen Nightmares.  My sister found a huge wad of plastic wrap in her salad.  The servers took a long time and the kitchen messed up our orders.  They seemed inflexible on sides and swapping out items. You could hear the kitchen staff fighting with the servers. Our meat dish was scarily undercooked. Everyone who worked there seemed miserable and smug. Way way overpriced for the quality of food and overall experience.  We had to launder our clothes immediately when coming home because they smelled like a deep fryer.  This place probably lost love for what they do a long time ago, and it shows in their food... Sad, because I imagine it probably used to be very good.  Shocked that they didn't offer to comp part of the meal... Especially for the plastic wrap fiasco.  On the upswing, the breads were nice, but not enough to redeem for the sad overall experience."}
{"text":"Delicious! We took 2 different types of Hachapuri, Harcho and Satzivi. Everything was very tasty. The waitresses proved once again that amous Georgian hosting traditions still there; warm and welcome. Recommended!"}
{"text":"To start off, we make the trek to Aragvi once a year, usually in the winter to have the stews.To say that the location is nondescript is a given but I'm coming here for the food, not to be seen. I recommend coming as a group so you can try more of the dishes! The appetizers are especially easy to share.   For the first course we ordered: veal tongue, potatoes with chanterelles, beef kninkali, and adjarian khackapuri (the bread). Out of these, I hadn't tried the potatoes before, the others we had had before and ordering them again was a no-brainer. Everything was as tasty as before. The cheese bread comes with an egg on top, so it's the perfect dish if you love eggs as much as I do. The cheese gives it a saltiness that I like but I can see how it would be too much for some. The khinkali dumplings have some broth inside so eat them carefully; I was pleasantly surprised by the tastiness of the filling. And the potatoes, they're going into regular rotation now.   For the mains we got: the chicken stew (chakhokbili), the unbelievably tasty veal stew (chanakhi), georgian solyanka, and chicken shish kebob.   I'll be honest the first time we ordered the \"unbelievably tasty stew\", it was for the ambitious name. It takes guts to call your food unbelievably tasty. But honestly, it is *really good*. It has the perfect storm of ingredients, a very nice balance of umami and slight sourness. One of my dining companions said it's one of his favourite dishes ever.   The other stews were very tasty as well but if I had to only order two things here, it would be the cheese bread and the unbelievably tasty stew.   The chicken shish kebob was cooked to perfection, it wasn't dry at all. The fried potatoes it came with where great. This for me is more of a summer dish, which I think the menu needs as it's skewed more heavily towards stews.   We washed everything down with tarhun, a tarragon flavoured Ã¼ber-green soft drink. The taste reminds me of childhood but if you've never tried it before, I'd recommend it for the novelty, it might just grow on you.   I have never made it to the desserts at Aragvi, the portions are big enough (we all brought something home for lunch the next day!) and the food is very filling.   To sum it up, it has a bit of a banquet hall feel and it's quite far but the food here is so different from what you can get downtown, and so tasty, that we'll be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"Went: 6:00 pm Sat June 6 2015 Ordered: Imeritinski Khachapuri, Chanakhi, and Beef Stroganoff Cost: incl. tax and tip $30-40  Food: I do remember there was a sign saying the wait times might be long because the food is cooked fresh and it definitely was. This was some of the freshest food I've tasted. The presentation of the dishes being very unique and the food being outstanding.  The flavour is there, not too salty as I would expect for stew dishes.  Environment:  The restaurant was fully packed.  It was rather noisy, there was a function going on (with many kids).  Dispite all these, we still get the regular checked in from the staff.  They are friendly and attentive.    Bottom line: I would definitely come back. This is 4.5 stars. I'm rounding down to 4 because it is only slightly better than my other 4 star meals."}
{"text":"Go to this restaurant!!! It is so amazing! Makes me drive north of Shepppard  (their original location) because the food is so unbelievable. Chinkali is the traditional dish. The meat and the juice plus dumpling melt in your mouth. Lots of other delicious items on the menu. Tried the Kyufta-Bozbash soup on this very cold night and it was a wonderful mix of flavors. We went to one of the other 2 Georgian restos up north (the one that is not called Georgia) and this is superlative. Go to this restaurant and taste for yourself!"}
{"text":"I visited the new location and it wasn't any worse than when I reviewed the old location. Takeout/delivery available.  Solyanka- Great Stroganoff- rich but guest said could have small improvements (couple of meat pieces unchewable, more mushroom); very thick Budemjan- very good Adjarian Khachapuri- very good Dessert- good  Prices for the entrees are fair. Appetizers cost more but are very good. The service was very hospitable and there were no issues at all. I look forward to returning some day."}
{"text":"Disappointing food (looks good, but tastes below average for a Georgian or grill place), mediocre service.   Would eat there in a pinch, but thankfully, there are other places nearby. And if you don't mind driving 5-10 minutes, FAR better places."}
{"text":"Went to Aragvi for a business lunch. The food was a hit and miss, Kharcho soup was very tasty but lamb shish kebab was dry and overcooked and Khachapuri (Georgian cheese bread) was very greasy. The service was ok.  I like exotic food but probably wouldn't come back..."}
{"text":"Very low quality food. Looks like the cook uses whatever left from last night. Overpriced as well. I ate 10 minutes ago and i already feel upset stomach. If you happen to be there just come closer to where the cooks table is and look how dirty it is. What a shit hole..."}
{"text":"Update: We returned to Aragvi and were seated at the table nearest the washroom hallway. Which amounted to feeling that we were actually dining in the washroom itself due to the stench that would waft toward us each time other guests opened the door to the washroom hall. The washrooms themselves were not very clean and are way too cramped.  The food was phenomenal and the service was warmer than our last visit.  But if the washrooms are so filthy one is left to wonder about the cleanliness of the kitchen...."}
{"text":"Great restaurant with authentic Georgian cuisine. The food is amazing and the menu is quite rich. Unobtrusive yet attentive service.  You have to try the khachapuri and the eggplant rolls with walnuts!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing restaurant, great food with delicious flavour!! The service was excellent! Was my first time experiencing Georgian food, and I will DEFINITELY be going back! Keep up at the great work!"}
{"text":"Our happy place! We don't own a car but would visit this place every time we have access to one. Perhaps the best Georgian (Eastern European or Mediterranean) restaurant in all of Toronto GTA. The only downside is that it's right behind an Auto Shop. But the food is incredible. I'd name it the best restaurant in town if I had the power. Our must-eat, and it should be your must-try!"}
{"text":"So far I had 2 lunch take-outs; once lamb shish kebob and last chicken white meat. Lamb was Perfection, the best lamb shish kebob I had so far in Canada. It was correctly seasoned and marinated, very tender and juicy. Chicken was also very moist and tender, even as second-day microwaved lunch. I only thought the chicken was a bit on a salty side. The rice that comes with meal is cooked properly. And there's also a simple salad (tomatoes, cucumbers, lettuce), I could tell the veggies were really fresh, just cut. I would agree that the place might need a little reno here and there, but the quality of food definitely great."}
{"text":"Must have is penovani and imeritinski khachapuri. Great service and awesome food. Not the greatest location - hard to find, but so worth it."}
{"text":"Saw this restaurant in a blog post on must goes for foodies so I could not resist stepping in. The hardest part to grasp about this place; is finding it... seriously and it does not help with all the construction going on on Hwy 7. But once this little gem is found; park up and you won't forget your visit. The decor is well dated but nonetheless does have its charm about it. Its like stepping into a European cafe or a Russian cafe. Most of those in the restaurant were Russian or Georgian. The staff were friendly and happy to answer any questions as It was evident the food wasn't my everyday. The soup dumplings were divine and the waitress gave us a little synopsis on its origin and the proper way to eat them. I loved that. They tastes amazing. And the Aragvi bread... its a Must! the fresh bread with the gooey cheese and the egg in the middle... my lord it was divine... The rest of the meal wasn't something to write home about but the soup dumplings and the bread are both i'll never forget and continue to crave! So worth the visit. A def must try!"}
{"text":"Dropped it 2 stars.  Food's still good but  I recently took my friends for Christmas dinner. Everything was great and happy but when I asked the lady to split the bill she rolled her eyes and angrily told us we should have said so in the first place.  Now I for one am easy going. If you told us you could not split the bill, I would have happily done it myself amongst my friends.  But no, you had to ruin a perfectly good Christmas dinner with your attitude.  I am sorely disappointed by the service now.  Too bad, although the foods good, I'm probably not going back ever again."}
{"text":"Delicious food. I can't wait to go back and try something new. We had the Khinkali, Adjarian Khachapuri, and Chanaki."}
{"text":"Finally a place I was truly unhappy with. Incredibad customer service, location and decor. I had their chicken and HOH BABY was it underwhelming. Potatoes were stale, salad was limp. I can't make this rhyme without sounding like a gimp. There are better choices, don't frequent this place."}
