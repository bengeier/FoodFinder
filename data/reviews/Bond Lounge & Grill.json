{"text":"Bond is excellent. Very cool vibe. James Bond theme is subtle, not over the top. Lots of good looking people. Drinks were fantastic and food was top notch."}

{"text":"The Bond part of the bar is pretty cool, especially if you're a Bond fan...constant Bond movies playing, late 60's decor.  BUT, I would not recommend going to this place AT ALL unless you're familiar with Montreal's \"private club\" rules.  This means you are required to buy 2 drinks and get food.  The hostess and bartender kind of explained this to us but it wasn't really clear what we had to buy until we were into our first drink.  We just wanted one drink but the pressure for a second drink and a food order was over-the-top intense, we weren't going to be allowed out the door until we ordered food and second drinks.  Lame!  Plus, the bartender on a Saturday night did not know how to make a Negroni and a Bloody Ceasar (in Canada no less!) she had to look up then recipes and then proceeded to tell us they'd be the best we'll ever have. $8 for mediocre cocktails?  C'mon owners, you can do better than this.  Hire a real bartender and make it a \"normal\" bar where we can come in for a drink and stay, IF WE WANT TO."}
{"text":"Fantastic place, nice people, awesome food, great atmosphere. It's a newer-age tapas bar with a James Bond and 1960s Turkish chic theme.   The menu inclues tapas that range from curry chicken to steak tartare as well as a gourmet poutine."}
{"text":"Cool bar. I'm not sure I would go back? The food was ok. Friendly staff. Nicely designed bar. I don't think a place like this should have a tv but that's just my opinion. There was a really cool advertisement like mirror/monitor thing over the urinal that just impressed me, but that might have been the rum;)"}
