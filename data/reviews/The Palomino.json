{"text":"The only thing I REALLY like about this place is its sooOoO close to the train and an endless supply of cabs is just across the street. Sometimes they play cool bands.. not like they used to though. I don't think I'll eat there again... their food gives me the mad shites and the chicken club is way dry. 

The servers upstairs are usually pretty awesome and on top of drinks/food. Don't try to have a convo with the barkeeps downstairs though. They must fucking hate their job. I know its loud hard work bla blafuckingblaaa get a different job if you're that miserable. Or is that what the kewl punk kids act like these days. SHiiiiiiiiii-"}
{"text":"Good food, cozy and good for small groups of friends. Our server (Lace) is fantastic, very patient and did a great job! Thanks!"}
{"text":"I have visited this establishment several times pre-Yelp. It is hard to beat the character of this place - rusty nails holding a window in place, spider webs in the corners of same window,  the aged (pronounced ay-jed) furniture.  Then there is the food! Our group of five enjoyed brisket,  ribs and a philly sandwich.  All awesome!  Deep fried pickles were a treat. Our server was friendly and helpful.  This is not a complaint,  but I don't quite get why it seemed to take a long time to get a beer. Regardless, they were cold and refreshing! Calgary has a couple BBQ places and this place is definitely one of the best!  I recommend Big T's and Holy Smoke as well."}
{"text":"Good food. Good beer. Good atmosphere
Had the two meat platters with pulled pork and beef brisket. 
Garlic fries are very delicious if you can handle the amount of garlic.

{"text":"If you, unlike Sam Jackson's character in Pulp Fiction, do dig on swine, than you'll go hog wild for the Palomino. I'm talkin' 'bout pulled pork sandwiches (which just so happens to often be the daily special), fall off the bone babyback ribs, and more. Even their smoked fowl is fair. All this served up in a honky-tonk type atmosphere. Hallelujah. 
Seeing as how their primo pork often packs the place, parking is at a premium (Say that 5 times fast!). Fortunately the Palomino is located right on the C-train line. So, if you don't have to drive, don't bother. Better to appreciate their wide array of draft beers anyhow."}
{"text":"Food is good, nice staffing but this place need to clean up, touch up and some of the remodels"}
{"text":"finally a place that actually cares about customer service.  Wonderful environment, great food.  I recommend the platter for 4, a taste of everything."}
{"text":"This place is all about the pulled pork.

There's pulled pork sandwiches, pulled pork lasagna, pulled pork poutine; if there's a dish you like to order at different places, you can probably get it here but with pulled pork on it.  In fact, the pulled pork makes the dishes here, in my opinion.

That isn't to say that they don't have other things.  This place really is for meat lovers though, as you can also get different types of BBQ'd beef and chicken.  They also have a brunch menu as well.

The pulled pork lasagna is awesome.  Just think of lasagna but with BBQ'd pulled pork instead of ground meat.  The pulled pork poutine is tasty, but I'm ashamed as I somewhat consider myself a poutine connoisseur, and I couldn't finish mine.  Not because I didn't like it, just that there was so much meat that I got stuffed.

My only complaint is that with groups greater than eight people, they automatically tack on a 17% gratuity.  But at least they warn you of that on the menus.  If your group is less than eight, they calculate what a 15%, 18%, and 20% gratuity looks like at the bottom of the receipt so you don't have to do the math yourself, which is convenient. They also won't split up the bill (they warn you about this too), although you can split the payments.  Kind of annoying when you all want to leave and pay separately, but I can understand how it'd be easier to manage as it seems to get busy sometimes and people come and go often.

But all-in-all, the food is great, and I've made it my personal mission to go back and try each item on the menu.  Mind you, I've barely made a dent, but I look at it as more of a long-term goal."}
{"text":"When you're this far from Texas, this is as good it gets for bbq. I love their garlic fries. My favourite mains are their slow smoked chicken and kansas pork ribs. Both are juicy, tender and flavourful. My favourite side is the JD apples.

The service is good and the portions are generous. IMHO this is the best bbq place you're gonna find in Calgary. While this is not the best bbq I've ever had in my life, it will curb the craving until my next trek down to Texas!"}
{"text":"I had high expectation of this place from reading the other reviews. I don't know if it was just an off night or of all these people are wrong. 

Service was soooo slow and our server was never anywhere to be seen. Took her ages to take our order. Food took ages to come, and it was cold. Plus when we asked for the  bill it took her 5 mins to bring the credit card machine over. 

Maybe they were busy, but for the size of the place and the amount of people in there I really don't think this was"}
{"text":"The food at the Pal is top notch, but service is dodgy. We once waited almost 2 hours for lunch. To compensate, our server gave us an extra pint of Steamwhistle. Which didn't help our afternoon's productivity. 

Live music is great - this is one of the better small stages in the city - but shows (a) tend to start very late and (b) go very late."}

{"text":"Pretty much all of the food at the Palomino is delicious and the only reason I gave them one less star was because the amounts were not plentiful. The bacon wrapped corm is one of my favorite sides."}
{"text":"My main purpose of business here: watching concerts in the basement. Never really ate here much, when I have it's been the nacho's (which are top notch I must say) and I've heard great things about their other food options. 

The location for this place is a little on the iffy side. It's great because it's right on the LRT line. It sucks cuz on one side is the LRT, the other is Stephen Ave ie: you have to park quite far away if you're driving, which my group of friends always does. 

One of my other fave parts about this place is the crowd. At some places you go to a metal concert and you get true metal heads hanging out who windmill to their hearts delight and enjoy a good mosh pit. Here? Well lets look at my last experience: It's a hard rock/metal concert and there's a bunch of girls wearing t-shirts as dresses who are dry humping and seem to think their listening to LMFAO's Party Rock Anthem because they sure love their shufflin'. 

Anyways... that's beside the point. Good grub, cool venue and yet shit ass service. I've known people to get attitude from the bartender, and recently I went to get a refill on my pop, I ask the bartender if it's free because I don't know if they charge for refills and he says \"For the most part\" and walks away. Took me a while to figure out what that meant but I think he was expecting a tip for me taking my glass full of ice over and asking him to push a button until my coke reached the brim. Am I just a cheap ass bitch or is he just a poor bum. Sorry man, I work retail, I get it that you deal with drunks, but my job ain't pretty either and I don't get any tips for it, plus you got a pretty decent tip when my sis-in-law bought the pop to begin with.

Other downsides to this place: Dirty bathrooms with poor lighting leaving you in a creepy dark bathroom stall. It's not really kept clean in regards to cup and such during a show unless the patrons take their empty drinks to the bar (so watch your step people). And the staircases are fairly uneven pieces of wood so be careful if your particularly clumsy."}
{"text":"Met up with some friends here last night and thought I'd check out the wings. WOW! Huge, saucy, meaty wings with some kick. Had ordered the 'Hot', not the suicide, but I'd imagine that the suicide must be damn hot based on how hot these ones were. We ended up ordering two rounds of wings they were so good. The only complaint was the service, which ended up being a running joke at our table by the end of the night. The waitress had these giant glasses on, which we swore only allowed her to see things within 4-5 ft of her. We ended up bussing our own table for a bit even. Beware the automatic 17% gratutity tax they slap on your bill as well if you're a group bigger than 6-7 people.

I will be back for more of these wings."}

{"text":"I have been going to The Palomino since it opened, first for the live rockabilly and appetizers on First Thursdays and now mainly for dinner dates and live shows in their awesome basement venue.  Basement, you say?  Sounds sketchy but it is quite the opposite.  Definitely, my favourite small venue for local and travelling acts in the city, The Palomino caters to a wide range of genres and music enthusiasts.  

Amazing bartenders, beer and the city's best caesars handsdown, we always have a great time at The Palomino.  You can't leave without trying their pulled pork poutine.  Sinfully delicious. 

A great place for a first date (where I went with my husband on ours!), for work parties, or with a group of friends, The Palomino Social Club basically feels like you are in some raucous 1940s RCMP camp complete with the log cabin walls, surly kitchen staff, and some good time music."}
{"text":"Children not welcome for dinner. That would have been nice to know when I made a reservation for 10 on a Saturday night.  Instead, we only found out when we showed up at 7pm.  Needless to say, finding last minute alternate arrangements for 10 is not easy. 

A noisy bbq joint sounds like a great place for a large family dinner but apparently their liquor license does not allow minors after 4pm. This should be abundantly clear on the website as well as on the phone when making a reservation."}
{"text":"The smoked salt and pepper wings were awesome.  Had the ribs, brisket and pulled pork.  Loved the ribs great smoke flavour, the pulled pork was a bit dry, the brisket was thick sliced.  Otherwise the food was very good.  Large portions for a full belly.  Live music on Fridays with no cover before 9 pm.  It is downtown calgary so plan for crappy parking."}
{"text":"Palomino is a surprising place.  Don't be afraid of the dodgey location on the LRT next to the sketchy stores and the Crack house... think of it as part of the adventure!  Amazing food AND you can score a 'dime bag' on your way out!  

Seriously though... it's not nearly as nasty as it used to be or as bad as many people might expect it to be and the food is well worth stepping over syringes for. 

If you dine on Swine you will LOVE what they do with a pulled smoked pork sandwich.  Completely best in class.  I was there just yesterday and had their special, a Jerk Pork Sandwich... pulled smoked Pork with a Jamacian Jerk BBQ sauce, topped with coleslaw... excuse me while I get a napkin... and the sides were even special... garlic fries and (their in-house specialty) Jack Daniels Apples - which I've only ever seen at Palomino and are worth going for all on their own... I'd love to talk about other items on their menu but really I haven't managed to get past the pulled Pork!!  

The space itself is much larger than it looks like it ought to be and is trying to go for that kinda country industrial worn out dive feel... in some ways it reminds me of Bookers Crab Shack.  I suppose my only criticism is that this well worn feel is maybe a bit more fact and reality than style choice... tables (presumably post drunken bar brawl) are wobbly and seating is iffy at times and wouldn't rate a Consumers Choice Award any time soon.

All together though the package is easy to appreciate and I look forward to future adventures getting to the Palomino"}
{"text":"Stopped in on Sunday night to catch dinner while staying at a hotel nearby. Eating alone so didn't want to go to a pricey eatery. After reading the other reviews was not surprised that it had a bit of a seedy roadhouse look that was actually fun to experience. Wanted to order the ribs and brisket but unfortunately out of ribs at dinner time. Brisket was good ordered a side salad which had the wilted pre made look fried would be a better option. Never understood why restaurants serve meat that requires a steak knife and has bbq sauce on a plate covered with a wax paper. Always picking out the paper on the food. All in all the brisket was good but the rest was uninspiring. Server was efficient but obviously bored with her work. I will try again on a better night."}
{"text":"I'm addicted to bacon, I have no shame in admitting that. So when a friend posted a picture of bacon wrapped corn on the cob and said it was from Palomino, I knew immediately where I was going for lunch later that week!

My coworker and I met up with my boyfriend here, and OMG the smoked meat aroma was the best welcoming EVER! Looking at their menu you know they mean business - BBQ and meat.

My boyfriend and I both got the Palomino cheeseburger (applewood smoked cheddar, double smoked bacon, caramelized onions and lime chili aioli), and obviously the bacon wrapped corn and fries for my sides (he got the garlic fries and coleslaw). My coworker went with the stampede chicken club with garlic fries and bacon wrapped corn.

I couldn't wait for my corn! The crispy crunch of the bacon and sweet corn was awesome and as I ate it I wished I had just gone with a plate of this for my meal instead! My burger was pretty delish, I really liked the lime chili aioli. I had a few of my bf's garlic fries and wow they didn't skimp on the garlic at all (be forewarned that you will reek of garlic for the rest of the day if you devour these)

Palomino has so much more to offer (ribs, pulled pork, etc), so if you love meat this place is definitely for you!"}
{"text":"My partner and I ordered pulled pork sandwiches. If the smell coming from this place isn't enough to get you running threw their doors, their pulled pork was just right! Service was speedy and we didn't feel forgotten. Hannah served us and not only is she great at serving, she's drop dead gorgeous! We are happy to come back and enjoy the food, the service, and the comfortable atmosphere. This is right off the train line, so there are no excuses for figuring out how to get there."}
{"text":"The service was pretty good.

The food was ok.  I had the half rack of ribs with cesar salad and garlic fries.  I thought the ribs were nothing spectacular and a little dry.  The fries were way overdone but the salad was pretty good.

I think I would come here again during stampede if I needed a place with ambiance but it wouldn't be my first choice."}

Walked by this place for 3 months going to and from work..had no idea what went on inside of this run down looking place, had this place recommended to me a few times and still never realized this was the place they were referring too! None the less the clientele was a business mix, the atmosphere and service was fast and friendly and although I only had the beef brisk poutine with PBR on tap, I have paid 100's of dollars for far less taste lol..I will be bringing the wife here for supper when we're in Calgary on weekends...nice job Palomino! Don't change a thing.."}
{"text":"Visiting Calgary for the first time found this place in a hotel magazine .. Setting is a bit old and dusty we ordered a couple of burgers, brisket and ribs, the burgers were ok the buns were cold ;( the corn wrapped in bacon seemed like a good idea but it felt short. Anyways don't think I would come back .
Service was good, waitress was very nice."}
{"text":"We came here ready for some  finger lickin, bootie smackin, foot stompin bbq, but  it was just okay.


The chicken was a bit bland and overcooked.  The bbq beef short ribs were good and just fell off the bone.  Not the best I've had, but not bad either.  Could be that I'm from California and have had a lot of good BBQ there.

As for the sides, I tried the cole slaw, grilled veggies, bacon wrapped corn and the yellow and sweet mashed potatoes.  My favorite was the cole slaw.  Forget about the grilled veggies.  They were okay but I only got like two pieces of zucchini and 3 slices of bell peppers.  I was really looking forward to the bacon wrapped corn but was disappointed to find it was dry yet soggy.  I much prefer the corn I make at home on my bbq grill just plain and grilled in the husk to maintain juiciness.  The yellow and sweet potato mash was okay, but was cold.

This is still a memorable place for me because it is where I had my first \"Canadian\" experience.  I was told that I should try a Canadian dish called Poutine.  

So I tried the pulled pork Poutine and it was delicious.  I was told that the classic Poutine is just french fries with gravy on top and cheese curds.  The Poutine here had all of that plus pulled pork on top of it which was so good.  The gravy was excellent that I even dipped my chicken into it until it was all gone.  

I am a bit jealous now that I know Canadians get to to enjoy Poutine all the time since it is even offered at fast food places like Burger King and A&W.  California has no such thing :(  I don't believe we have the cheese curds that is used.  The closest cheese curds I've ever had is cottage cheese which I can't imagine tasting good with gravy and fries.

To complete my \"Canadian\" experience I had a pint of Molton's Canadian Beer.  It's was light, refreshing and went well with the BBQ.  Even better it was on special that night so it was only like $5.  They have good and cheap drink specials.  There is a drink special for every night of the week which I thought was cool.

I didn't get to see any of the live music that night, but the food was okay."}
{"text":"Palomino Smokehouse, you are simply meat-licious.  It was so good I went back again within the week and with all the downtown choices for lunch that says a lot.  

Some of the tastiest brisket I have ever had and yes, I have been to Texas.  The sides were yummy and I like that even though I am a meat whore to the brisket it mixes up the lunch to have so many different sides to choose from each time.  The fav...baked beans.  Cornbread was tasty too.  Garlic fries?  Don't mind if I do.  Everyone in our group had different things and since nobody was willing to share or spoke during the entire lunches I'll assume all good things about the entire menu.  

Great feel to the place can't wait to try it out at night.  And during Stampede.  And again and again and again for lunch.  I guess what I am saying is that I love you Palomino Smokehouse.  Let's be together forever, K? xox"}
{"text":"Ok, to setup expectations here... this is a dive/trendy/bbq place. Probably not the place to take your date on the first night out, but if you find they like it sloppy, then definitely this is a great second date spot!! Super casual, odd building, great food and awesome servers. Live music in the basement too (check the website for schedules).  Go!

Edit: spelling"}
{"text":"BBQ is about as specific and varied as the people's opinions about it.
I had the brisket, which is sort of like the orange chicken, or pad thai is to Chinese or Thai places in terms of a litmus test.
It was good.  Not amazing, but not dry and chewy, so I was happy.
The Q was served with bottles of mustard and three different sauces, in addition to ketchup.  Wow.  So many choices.  I had to try them all!  And...all were good for different reasons.  One spicy, one vinegary, one tomato-e.  I like selection.  The coleslaw was meh, and the garlic fries were okay, though the addition of some ketchup and BBQ sauce went a long way to make them better.

I can tell this place get noisy and crazy at night and I imagine that the crowd can vary quite a bit depending.  

That being said, it was nearly dead when i went in, a random assortment of country-ish music playing and limited server support.

Service was slow, but I was not in a rush so that's okay.

The craft beer selection was okay, more domestic than craft, but a few winners on the list including Big Rocks Traditional which I thought was wonderful.

This is a good spot for loud groups and live music, though I would not want to hang out here for just a random beer or snack."}
{"text":"I have eaten at The Palomino a few times and it has always been with a group of friends. We have ordered \"The Fat Ass platter\". This is great to share with a group of 4 or 5 and everybody will be full and will have gained a few pounds too. Greasy but good, sums it up!

The Patio has a good vibe during the hot summer evenings.  

 Beware they ID everybody on the weekends even if you are in your forties."}
{"text":"After catching a show at The Globe last night, a friend and I made our way over to The Palomino for some drinks.

With a western-themed decor, my guess is that The Palomino will be PACKED in the upcoming weeks with all the Stampede mayhem getting underway. Considering the wait staff is extremely friendly, I'd be happy for foreigners to experience The Palomino as being authentically Calgarian.

Although I didn't actually eat here, I did peruse their menu and they have quite an assorted selection of food at reasonable prices.

Overall, I was feelin' the vibe. I'd like to head back some time soon to check out one of the many live performances that The Palomino hosts. Maybe I'll see ya there?"}
{"text":"Hi and goodbye! Now this is a place I will NEVER visit again. Overpriced and not worth your time.
I went for a few drinks with the co-workers. Ordered poutine with chicken. Asked for NO SALT on my fries. They brought the dish so salty it was uneatable. The chicken was so dry and overcooked and the cheese curds looked like some cheap mozzarella cut into a round shape.  
I returned the dish, the waitress brought a second attempt, just as salted. I returned it once again and said I wanted NO SALT on my fries, besides the gravy was something made out of a bag, super salty too. Now the bearded , rude manager came back with the plate and literally told me: \" It is what it is...what do you expect? It's pre-made fries from a frozen bag! We can't control how salty they are \".  I was appalled by his comment and how rude he was. I did not want to make a big stink in front of co-workers, but if it had been me solo or with my family, he would have heard an earful from me. That poutine had a price tag of 13 bucks! Of course I expected home made fries and cheese curds. I will never go back to that place again. YUCK."}
{"text":"We went there on Jan 6 th with a band playing at the night. The smokehouse offers Bbq pork ribs, Alberta beef briskets and not to mention the cocktails-lemonade, and bourbon teas. the atmosphere is to die for, relaxed! The dessert is one and only bourbon banana gelato."}
{"text":"Went there after Beerfest, and quickly got a spot at the tables to grab some food. Ordered the 'Two Meat Sampler', and here are my thoughts:

- SMALL portions! For $24, I would have expected a little bigger. 
- The roasted chicken was good.
- The beef brisket was DELICIOUS! 
- The garlic fries were insane! I didnt want them to end! 

This place gets major points for easy accessibility. Its right on 7th Ave, right infront of the C-train! What else could you ask for?
The upstairs is huge and has enough tables to safely guarantee a spot (I went on a Saturday night and the place was half empty), and the downstairs has some kind of kind of band playing if you're in that sort of mood.

All in all, I would definitely go back again for the beef brisket and the *gasp* FRIES!"}
{"text":"Great eats with a relaxed vibe. Enjoyed the brisket and beers with friends. I would recommend to anyone from out of town that needs a good bbq fix to there taste buds. Servers were friendly and back patio was well lit with picnic table settings. Wings... excellent."}
{"text":"I am unsure why I have not written a review about Palomino's earlier than today. Palomino's changed my food-loving life. Here's the story:

I was freshly 18, I had a cool older cousin, who has the same name as a very popular movie/book character. This unnamed cousin took me to Palomino's for a beer, and wings and other food. Being freshly 18 and intimidated by the east side of downtown, I was nervous. I had never had southern BBQ before. HOW HAD I NEVER HAD SOUTHERN BBQ BEFORE? This food was amazing. The smokiness over flowed in my mouth with every bight, up until this point chicken had been a vessel for BBQ sauce, but now who needed the sauce.

I remember my first bite into my pulled pork sandwich like it was 10 seconds ago. It was glorious and juicy, having just finished high school this made no sense to me, doesn't smoke just dry out the meat? NO! Oh it was glorious.

Okay, Now it is years later, I now almost exclusively hang out in the east side of downtown, and I am back at Palomino's. And it's still great. The Mac and Cheese with Pulled Pork/Brisket, so cheesy and glorious. Any of there meats on a bun. Any of there meats without a bun. Everything is great. 

New Discovery: Bacon Wrapped Corn on the Cob. Try it. I think it's smoked, and it's fabulous."}
{"text":"Best Southern style BBQ in the city.  They have maintained their \"alternative\" atmosphere in downtown Calgary, which I appreciate, but not a spot for people looking for a polished atmosphere."}
{"text":"Always tasty food, good variety, not your typical burger spot. Pulled pork or BBQ anything are their specialty. Good options for sides. How do you say no to bacon wrapped corn? Always friendly service n good prices. And this is a fun venue fr great live music. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Been a few years since I last ate at the Palomino but needless to say the food was just as good as the last time I was there. Smoked turkey sandwich hit the spot. Service was fast and efficient."}
{"text":"The only legit barbeque that I have eaten outside of the southern USA and the only brisket made outside of Texas that I have heard complimented by Texans. Yes folks, it's that good."}
{"text":"Drinks are too expensive so be aware. The food is a typical American bbq style but good. You may spend more than anticipated."}
{"text":"I love this place, awesome rustic decor, the food is second to none, a little pricey but I have paid way more for terrible food ,the staff is friendly, I love this place. I would give this place 5 stars but they let hipsters in here but I guess douchebags have to eat too."}
{"text":"After having some decent meals all week while here on business, my wife took the family to this place.  Hello.

I love the rustic atmosphere.  What's that you say?  It's a dump?  Well, to some, a dump IS home.  Far from the fancy-schmancy places I was taken, this was what I truly needed.

Still, though, I thought that a place like this would have what I'd been looking for all week: INDIA PALE ALE.  I need to digress here a bit; WHERE ARE THE HOPPY BEERS IN ALBERTA?  I see there's a place called Beer Revolution, but I tell you people...I'm scared.  I look at the reviews for the brew restaurants in Alberta and nobody is talking about the beer.  Alas, the waitress understood my dilemma, and offered the Beaver Amber.  Still...a bit more hoppy bite than the crafty beers I had all week, but not enough for me.  I had a Steamwhistle for my second beer.  Good ol' Steamwhistle - probably the hoppiest beer I had all week.

For dinner, I had the the pulled pork, boring fries (just plain old fried potatoes) and the bacon-wrapped corn cobs.  It will fill you up (especially if you drink 2 pints of beer - 20 oz each in Canada).  You get 3 barbecue sauces, all of which are great.  The Chipotle sauce has a nice zing - here's your spicy sauce.  Oh, but wait, that Carolina mustard sauce has a decent kick as well!  Then the Jack Daniels sauce is there just to round things out.

Staff are pierced, tattooed, dyed and hairy.  I'm down with the cause, Holmes.  I can just hear my boss bitching about their attire.  Awesome.

Had to use the restroom in the basement.  Cool stage.  I probably would have come to a few shows here had I lived here in my younger days.  

Totally recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Delicious southern bbq! Awesome wait staff greeted me and gave me recommendations whne I asked for takeout. Got the beef brisket and ribs,  and had the bacon wrapped corn and yam potato mash as aides. Generous portions and tasty, the only thing that is missing to bump this up to a five star would he that the brisket was a little dry, but overall still very tasty. Would highly recommend the corn but might pass on the mash next time and go with another side. Will return! 

Ps protip ask for extra bbq sauce to go if you're ordering takeout. Pretty bomb sauce."}

{"text":"Title: Mr. PARKER wants \"PLEASE\"
Author: Angelo

Once upon a time there was a child named Mr. PARKER, who decided that when he grew up, he'll become the bestest WHATEVER in the world. But 20-30+ plus years later through mediocrity and whatever led him to employment as a \"bartender\" at the Palomino, he decided on Nov 3 2011, to annoy the HELL out of me.

A:\"Hey hows it going man? Can I get a water?\"
Mr. PARKER:\"Can I get a water what? What else do you need to say?\"
A:\"Just a water\"
Mr. PARKER:\"Just a water. What?\"
A:\"That's it for now, thanks\"
Mr. PARKER: \"No you don't get anything until you say what I need you to say\"
*pause*
A:\"I don't want it and have no time for this\" *walks away*

\"Please\" Is that what you wanted me to say? Not even a lightly ribbed tone, a wink, and a smile accompanying \"Not until you say the magic word, buddy!\" Luckily, it was my friend's CD release party so I was in a relatively good mood, so I just walked away ignoring the urge to spawn altercation but like the ninja that I am, got Mr. PARKER's (due to terms & use the full has been stripped) name from the soundman. So suffer the wrath of a sleep-deprived YELPING Angelo!

Was I rude? It doesn't matter, I'm a F#$(@%* customer! Sure, I've worked retail long enough to know how bad customers get, but I've had my \"shitty attitude\" moments when I realized I wasn't doing my job. Just because I asked for a free water doesn't indicate I was some bum off the street that hasn't dropped some cash into the establishment that employed Mr. PARKER.  And it's the PALOMINO man, not Ms. Doubtfire's party...who forces people to say \"please?\"

Seriously, if you decided to make this a routine, Mr. PARKER, I suggest you calibrate yourself according to the person you're saying it to. Like the following types of people:

1. A hot flirty chick with a short skirt
2. A kindergarden student

HINT: none of the types of people I was not.

OTHERWISE, the Palomino Smokehouse is great venue for concerts and local band performances. The food was really great from my experiences in the past, with their prices being fair, the concert crowd being really cool and non PARKEResque service being great. I suggest trying their brisket and it's popularity amongst patrons speaks for itself. Certainly worth the trouble of parking downtown. 

See how positive this review would've gone? Over a glass water...HILARIOUS
But....My \"lessons in customer service\" trumps Mr. PARKER's \"lessons in human courtesy\". 

The END

I had called to make a reservation for 10 people on a Saturday night at 8pm. No problem there. However, the section we were in were all small round tables, and it was so dark, that it was impossible to see the menus. Good thing we have flashlights on our cell phones.
The service was sub-par, if you want to call it that. It took a while for us to even be greeted by anyone, let alone make a drink order. 
The menu looked decently good. As a Barbecue place, and with pretty good reviews on Yelp, I had high hopes. Boy was I disappointed.
My husband and I ordered deep fried pickles. They were actually really good, but definitely not house made. No worries, they were really good. My sister in law ordered some nachos for sharing, and it came with a side of chicken, and a side of baked beans. They were also really good! 
Just before we were ready to order (which was an hour after we had arrived) the computer system went down. Oooookay. 
As for the food: 3 of us had ordered ribs. One person didn't eat them because they were so dry, one person sent them back because they were so burnt, and they completely messed up my order. How can you mess up a half rack of ribs, slaw, and baked beans is beyond me, but it was at LEAST 10 minutes before my food came. The ribs were hot, but they were super dry. The beans and the slaw were the best part. 
My husband had a double burger. He said it was tasty, but again, it was really dry. 
The corn bread was a complete write off. I picked it up and was shocked at how heavy and hard it was. The taste of it was sweet and had some jalapeno. However, you had to chew it, and chase it with a drink because it was so dense and so dry, that it sucked up all the saliva in your mouth. 
My sister in law had the chicken, and she said \"well, it was good, once I removed the burnt part\". I guess she didn't see it, because it was so dark.
My other two sisters in law had the pulled pork sandwich. Guess what it was. Dryyyyyy. I don't even think it had sauce! 
Brother in law had the catfish po'boy. Not sure if he even ate the whole thing. 
Not sure what the rest of my party ordered, as I didn't hear much in regards to the main dishes.
The general consensus was that the sides were the best. Knowing this, we would have just gotten the Side Car, which was 4 sides. The slaw, the beans, the garlic fries (oh wow, those were good) and the bacon wrapped corn on the cob. 
Maybe it was just a bad night but I don't think I would come back, or recommend this place... 
Everyone else agreed we should have went somewhere else too... Sad but I guess now we know.
At least the football game was on, and the Eskimo's won...."}
{"text":"I was actually fairly impressed with the BBQ here.  I've only had better in the southern U.S.  If you want an alternative to all of the Asian food nearby this is a good choice.  Brisket was great and pulled pork was tasty too."}
{"text":"Went here on the recommendation of a friend. They had supper here last week, and said it was good, with a few hiccups. They ordered the deep fried pickles as an app, but they were out. They also warned me that the booze was overpriced (I think a caesar was $10).

So my experience was like this, promptly seated and given menus. After a quick perusing, I decided on the lasagna, while my cousin was just going to have the soup. Waitress came back right away saying they were out of soup, and out of lasagna! Its 5:30, what are other going to eat? We changed our order, and when she input it she found out that I could have the last piece of lasagna. Food was good, but not as \"dynamite\" as expected.

Will I give it a second go, yes. If they tell me they are out of something, I won't be impressed."}
{"text":"Warning: The following review is based on a real life conversation between myself and Carly M. 

C: I Saw the picture you posted! OMG the Palomino. Those garlic fries!
D: I like how they let you choose between \"garlic fries\" and \"BORING fries.\" Do they make your \"horngry\", baby? Do they?
C: I want those fries like ALL the time.
D: You're a  \"nymfrymaniac\"! I LOVE the Palomino. Their badass alternative cowboy attitude is the Calgary I wish to live in.
C: Right?! Have you had the nachos? The BEST.
D: No, but the weekend Cowboy Brunch is unreal too!
C: What? They have brunch?!
D: Yah! They have have pulled pork or brisket bennies and this monsterously delicious deepfried breakfast burrito thing! You can basically get all the Palomino BBQ awesomeness but with some eggs for breakfast time.
C: Wow! I seriously didn't even know that!
D: I'm like a miniature breakfast buddha, covered in hair.

ANYWAY, The Palomino is awesome and edgy. It's country, but in that badass Johnny Cash giving the middle finger kind of way. Billy-Ray Cyruses need NOT apply. The BBQ is a freaking smokey wonderland and it's all fresh. Go to the Palomino when you want meat with a side of meat, garnished with meat. Some wicked sides include the garlic fries, bacon wrapped corn cobs and Jack Daniels Apples. There's green things and crap like that to, if you want it.

 I once gave them hell for running out of pulled pork because that's the whole point of the Palomino! They said \"It's fresh. We won't freeze anything ever, so once it's gone, it's gone. Get here sooner.\" I got schooled and I freaking deserved it.

It's old. It's eclectic and it owns everything it does with ease. It all comes natural and I never get the feeling that The Palomino is pretending to be something it's not. Points for authenticity, Palomino. 

The basement turns into a live music bar where you'll find any kind of kick-ass alternative act from country to death metal and everything in-between. It's dark, dirty and loud down there, and one hell of a good time!

I wasn't lying when I said \"their badass alternative cowboy attitude is the Calgary I wish to live in.\" I take out-of-towners here all the time. I want them to leave with an awesome impression of Calgary and I want it to be The Palomino.

{"text":"I've been to the Palomino about once a month. Service is always good. Food is consistent. And considering you're about 1 block away from Stephen Ave, the prices are reasonable.

My picks: poutine, fried pickles, garlic fries with a side of aioli, caesar and the burger. My only qualm is that I don't like any of the wines due to limited selection and they won't do corkage. I'd be happy to pay $20 or $25 to BYOB, but instead, I have to chug down something I don't like."}
{"text":"This is the type of place I just love! No froo-froo fancy decor to lure you inside. Just a dark hole in the wall you might just walk on by. But don't do that, because it's actually pretty great!

4 of us ordered the \"fat ass\" platter to share for $68. It included ribs, pulled pork, brisket, sausage, and chicken. The sides included were sweet potato mash, potato salad, coleslaw, sweetened apples, and bacon wrapped corn on the cob. I added the mac'n'cheese and cornbread. It was a good sign when the waiter contemplated moving us to a larger table.

The food was respectable. It's no the best BBQ I've had, but it is one of the better ones around here (not in southern U.S.). Everyone really like the sausage. The pulled pork was probably the best item. My least favourite was the cornbread. It was pretty dry.

Our server was super nice. The decor is unique. The lighting is quite dark... I used the light on my phone to see what was on the platter. But it's a great place. Seems like it might get rowdy later at night.

And a huge THANKS to the bouncer at the door for id'ing us lol."}
{"text":"Great spot for happy hour beers and good BBQ. 

On this visit I had the beef brisket with my two favourite sides: the bacon wrapped corn and garlic fries. The beef was tender and savory and I loved the selection of five BBQ sauces at the table. 

As a word of warning, don't get the garlic fries if you have any important meetings or dates later on. While delicious, you will be forced to remember the pungunt garlic flavour the rest of teh day."}
{"text":"Not the same \"country\" atmosphere I remembered from years ago but the food and service are still awesome!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for meat, this is your place. 

I had the beef brisket which was sooo tender and juicy. Just the right amount of fat. I paired that with garlic fries. You have to try them. They are fries, covered with garlic. Yes, simple, yes amazing."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere here. Great bbq and live music. A Calgary classic that i would bring friends from out of town to. The service was fantastic considering it was crazy busy because of stampede. The fried pickled here are my favourite. They are hot and perfectly battered and you get a good quantity compared to other places where I've ordered fried pickles. I got the Applewood Smoked Pulled Pork sandwich and I got to pick TWO sides. I chose the bacon wrapped corn on the cob which was phenomenal and the sweet potato mash which wasn't anything spectacular but not bad either. The pulled pork meat was delicious and because I like my pulled pork more \"saucy\" I loaded it with their bbq sauce and it was delicious. My only complaint was that the bun wasn't very fresh. As we finished up our meal a rockabilly band started up we got to enjoy some great music."}
{"text":"Went here for supper with a few friends. Atmosphere is really neat, lots of cool decorations and things to look at all around the bar. On our way walking over to the Palomino we could smell the BBQ from a block away - this seemed like a good sign. The ribs and brisket were amazing, the garlic fries were super garlic-y but I love garlic so that was fine with me! This is some of the best bbq I have had in Calgary. My friend said the Bourbon Apples were amazing and would recommend ordering them.
I will definitely be coming back to try out more on their menu!"}
{"text":"pretty darn good bbq and surprising to find it in Calgary! the platter is quite large. you pick the meat, and you get 2 sides. the brisket and pulled pork is the best. they are so moist, its ridiculous. ribs are not \"fall off the bone\" moist which was super disappointing for me. bacon wrapped corn cob was good as was the black eyes peas and beans. i heard that the grits are the best but they didnt have any the day i went. garlic fries are pretty standard with a hint of garlic. and i wasnt a fan of the yukon and sweet mash potatoes. wasnt sweet enough to be sweet mash or savory enough to be regular mash. it was so ... in between that i think it was confusing itself! nice selection of beer, although i didnt have any. and i love the old rustic decor inside. felt like i was in a barn someplace. i would definitely go back. but would definitely stay away from the ribs!"}
{"text":"Music and BBQ - a perfect combo. By coming here you will be supporting a venue that is one of the few in town to consistently support live music. One of the best BBQ menus anywhere and awesome staff too."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I spent a fantastic Friday night drinking at this bar while on our recent mini-vacation to Calgary.  Tasty non-traditional bar munchies including garlic fries and corn on the cob. 

Best bartender ever. I'll say again. The BEST bartender ever. 

We enjoyed free entertainment with the quazi-country band upstairs and could've gone downstairs for even more rock & roll had we wished. As a tourist, I was too absorbed with the local flavor happening all around me as the night wore on and the patrons got more and more intoxicated and the bartender got less and less willing to tolerate their insanity. 

Thanks for making our trip to Calgary more awesome Palomino."}
{"text":"I went here with a group of scooterists for a Scooter Rally (Jaguars!) breakfast/brunch.  I'm from Edmonton so I don't get a chance to go to this place often but we have had our breakfast/brunch here twice now.

It is a really cool spot.  We were seated outside at the back so I can't comment on the what it is like eating inside.  There was a band playing so it could probably get loud I guess.  Outside was great, we could still chat normally and still hear the music.

I had the pulled pork sandwich with the garlic fries.  They do warn about the garlic on the fries on the menu so be warned!  I love garlic and love those fries --- SO much garlic!  Awesome stuff.  Want again.

We did have poor service out back.  They may not have been fully prepared for our big group (40 people), but we did book it with them so if they weren't prepared it is their own fault.

If I lived in Calgary this would probably be one of my go-to spots.  Very unique atmosphere and good food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Southern BBQ food? Yes please!

The Palomino is a great place to grab some truly Southern cooked BBQ food. With all of the classics they offer, you're sure to find something you like. Personally I prefer the beef options as I'm not a huge fan of pork but the chicken is also quite good. I personally enjoy the beef brisket (with any of the 3 home-made types of BBQ sauce). You also get to choose from great sides. I generally grab the garlic fries and the bacon wrapped corn cob.

Warning: The garlic fries are enough to kill your date as soon as they're within eye-sight. These fries are for the true garlic lovers and not anyone else.

I've always received great service at the Palomino and they have speedy service at lunch time. The waitresses are always very kind and are generally quite social.

Even writing this review just makes me drool, so maybe I'll see you at the Palomino soon!"}
{"text":"I definitely love the vibe here. It's almost like a biker bar with live music every night and pretty good BBQ. The employees here are also quite interesting. They all look like bikers with long hair and beards with tattoos everywhere. I love the mismatching tables and chairs all over and there's a large patio outside as well as a larger bar downstairs when they have concerts.

The menu is loaded with pulled pork, brisket, burgers, steaks and basically any BBQ dish you can think of. It's also very well done. I would recommend the pulled pork poutine at least to try once. The pulled pork was my favorite thing here. They also have a decent beer selection and full bar which you should be glad to take advantage of. I probably won't make my way up to Calgary very often but when I do this will be a place I will come back to. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Part sports bar, part barbecue joint, part tattoo parlor, part concert hall -this place has it all. An ultra cool vibe envelopes you as you walk in. We sampled some of the local beers, had some real nice barbecue, had a super nice server named Sara, man oh man it was all good, I had a Pulled pork plate ($16) with two sides- I went for the cole slaw and the black-eyed peas. I chose a 20 oz Grasshopper draft. Everything was fabulous. The three table sauces, a chipotle concoction, a barbecue sauce, and a zippy mustard were all top notch. We could hear the music thumping downstairs and watched baseball on the upstairs tv screens. What a super cool place - no pretension, no high falutin' anything- just delicious honest food at a fair price. Awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Came to the Palomino on a Monday evening and it was very quiet... This is seat yourself type of place.  So I grabbed a table and it didn't take long for my server to come by with menus.  She indicated that over the past few days that they were exceptionally busy and that there were no drought beers (a list of 10-12 all gone).  

She gave me a few mins to check out the menu.  I decided I'd go for the Smoked Sausage Sandwich with a side of garlic fries and corn bread.  Since it wasn't overly busy my order came out quite quickly.  

Everything was hot, but the sausage sandwich was basically cut up slices of sausage, with melted cheese over top of a hot dog bun.  It was awkward enough that picking it up wasn't going to work so it was a cut it up with the knife and fork.  The first few bites into this and I have to say, not really that impressed.  The sausage was good, but the combination of the provolone and a hot dog bun, just didn't sit well with me.  The fries were ok, but quite greasy.  The cornbread was the winner of the meal.  It was very good.  
My server was by a few times to check on me and refill my drink.  She was very nice to me and very friendly.

Overall, I just wasn't that impressed with the food.  Service was very good and it definitely accounts for 2 of the stars here.  I've been to the Palomino in the past, and I recall having better food than what I had this night.  I'll like give it another try, but in the mean time there are many other places that are probably a better choice."}
{"text":"Before reading on, the faint of heart should know that I'm not pulling punches on this one.

I've been back over the last 4 months a few times.  Slowly, but surely, the food quality has been sinking.  The service has been back and forth, and the bands have gotten whiny and pathetic.

With that combination, I should'nt have been surprised that hipster douchebags started to populate the clientele base.  You know that guy that has thick rimmed glasses, a try-hard fedora, and dresses in very pretentious clothes such as tight pants and t-shirt with Che Guevara? Yeah, the ones that you would beat to death if being arrested wasn't a penalty? Those ones.  

The base of this place has become their haven outside of their parents' basements.  My favourite pub and eat is now a bastion of unemployed losers.  I'll try again in a year."}
{"text":"Great place that I visited on a weekend trip to downtown Calgary. Excellent brunch options and the decor was fascinating. Staff were friendly but I have to say service was unusually slow. For a place that has only four tables taken up on a Sunday afternoon, I didn't expect to wait up to 20 minutes to be attended to, followed by a close to 40 minute wait for food. When it did arrive I was quite satisfied, but was already in an off mood. I can't say I'll return since I don't live in Calgary, but I'm sure it does better as a night time venue for drinks based on other reviews."}
{"text":"Some of the best bbq I have had outside of the state of Texas! Got the two meat with brisket and pulled pork. Wife got the ribs. Both the ribs and brisket were 10/10! Pulled pork left a bit to be desired but was still good. 

Service was also very good!"}
{"text":"Loveeeee palomino. Food is delicious. Huge portions. There is live music as well. Great place to eat when you can enjoy it outside."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in downtown Calgary to grab a pint or some food after work. 
Service is always great.  The beer is always cold and the food is even better.  Recommend just about everything but my favorites are the ribs, chicken wings, Mac and cheese and deep fried pickles.  
My only complaint is the wine.  Poor selections poured in an odd glass. But I don't expect a large wine list at a place like this."}
{"text":"The Palomino occupies the corner of Calgary's \"skid row\", one of the sketchiest streets in Calgary. That being said, a night at the Pal will provide you with a better cross-section of Calgary's diverse population than just about any other venue. This is the place where construction workers rub shoulders with CEOs. It is also home to some really great live shows, and so also plays host to the young, hip, weird crowd. 

We had a Stampede Lunch here for work, and the BBQ is fabulous. The pulled pork was pretty flavorful and delicious, and the fries are awesome. They have decent drink specials too. It was fully in the spirit of stampeder - very cowboyish.

The Pal has two levels, which include the main bar/restaurant area and the large open spaced basement. The shows usually take place in the basement which has decent sound and a full bar. It also has a distinct lack of tables, so they can squeeze in a ton of people. They showcase many different genres - punk, country, rockabilly. If the genre features in the alternascene it will probably play here.

Show or not, the upstairs is a big open space with high ceilings and plenty of tables. They sometimes feature live music here too. Take a moment to talk with the bar staff in the big circle bar in the middle. They've got plenty of stories of the denizens who pass through. And the locals tend to be both funny and friendly, so you might just leave with a few friends."}
{"text":"It was our first time here. Super busy on a Friday, which was not unexpected as the weather was perfect and their patio was open. We were able to find a table on the patio. Service was quick and very friendly. Food was subpar. They ran out of chicken and ribs... at 5 PM. Drinks were fantastic. Lots of local options. Sketchy part of downtown though so don't expect any fanciness here."}
{"text":"Love the indie bands and the enthusiasm of the crowd hanging out in the dark grungy basement . The BBQ is fabulous and to quote  a friend it always soothes the soul. The bacon wrapped corn is an added treat and the Sunday breakfast is interesting and we had to order several dishes . We keep coming back!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never reviewed this place before!
This is one of my first restaurant experiences in Calgary and it was a fantastic place to start!
The rustic charm of the place sets the tone right away - it says \"leave your stuffy pink tie at the door\". Super laid back, tons of character and charm  and wonderful BBQ in this cool old building. You can smell the delicious smoky meat as soon as you walk in. 
I've had at least half of the menu offerings and I can attest that they are all fab.  Usually with work we order the Fat Ass Platter - all the meats and sides they offer heaped on one big plate. It says it's good for 3-4 people but I'd say it's closer to 5-6.
Warning - the garlic fries are no joke. Do NOT order them if you have to interact with any coworkers on the afternoon! Same goes for the Caesar Salad - there are whole garlic cloves hidden in there. I didn't know it the first time and thought it was cheese - pretty sure I could breathe garlicky fire for a few hours afterward!"}
{"text":"While visiting YYC,  friends suggested this place for some good ol BBQ in a very Calgarian atmosphere/setting. 

As a group, we ordered the 'Palomino Fat Ass Platter', full rack of ribs, deep dish mac and cheese and nachos. 

The Fat Ass Platter is a must if you got a group. You get a little bit of everything.  My favorite was the brisket. I could have had more of that. The mac and cheese was also very delicious. But, I could have gone without the Nachos, as it was only ok.

The bartender was awesome. He ended up making drinks for us that were not on the menu, including my first 'Calgary Fire'!"}
{"text":"I went to the Palomino for lunch & it was totally packed.  I think I got the last seat in the house. Service was prompt & friendly, I got my drink right away. Prices were reasonable.  However, probably due to how busy it was, the food took almost an hour to arrive.

When the food did come, it was delicious.  The yam soup was pleasantly spicy, the greens were varied & interesting and the Palomino cheesesteak was so far beyond the pale excuses you often see for a cheesesteak sandwich.  The BBQ meat was top-notch, moist & flavourful, while the toppings were excellent. 

A great place to come when it's not too busy."}
{"text":"\"The Pal\" as some of us call it ... simply kicks ass.

There's such an interesting diverse crew of people who come here and for what? Beer and BBQ of course.

I really dig the old school aka cowboy aka hole-in-the-wall look of this place!  The Palomino is a great place to kick back and grab a brew before heading off to other watering holes in the city.

Make sure to check out the patio in the back."}
{"text":"Best BBQ place in the city!! I love this spot - the beef brisket, fries and bacon wrapped corn is  sooooooo good!!! Also, during stampede and in the summer there's live bands and this place turns into a cool country bar"}
{"text":"Over the course of my Calgary life, I've been to The Palomino on a variety of occasions. The first was a couple of years ago for a some lunch before a little Lunchbox Theatre. In previous years I've also attended Stampede parties here, and in recent days... a couple of live shows.

As soon as you walk in the door, you'll be hit with the smell of The Palomino. The whole place smells smokey, it is a smokehouse after all. But it permeates throughout the building... even into the basement. Speaking of the basement, if you want a taste of the local indie music scene, you'll want to head here. Tonight I was there for the CD release party for the Outlaws of Ravenhurst. Playing with them were Thwomp (thank goodness they have an m!) and Bell Tower. If you'd like to still be able to hear your kids speak in 10 years, bring yourself some ear plugs. It gets loud. But the space works and you can have a decent vantage point of the stage from most angles. They also serve all beer downstairs that they do upstairs... now if anyone asks when you're there, you'll know!

I think my fave part of The Palomino is the patio in the back. It's fully enclosed and makes for a great private party.

{"text":"Not very often will you find me downtown during the week but after the oil and gas expo, my girlfriend and I decided to explore since we took public transit and have dinner downtown since we were in the area.  We hit up the map world first, as she needed to buy a map.... and then we asked the guy working what places he suggested nearby that were good eats.  He suggested a lot of places but \"BBQ\" stood out to us.  \"MMMMMM is it like fall off the bone good?!\" we asked, and he said it would be totally worth it.  He mentioned it was just around the corner on 7th avenue.  

We walked around the corner and saw a rustic brick looking place across the street ...\"PALOMINO\" the sign shouted.  We walked over and saw a standing sign '$5/lb of wings after 4PM' outside.  We decided to go inside to take a look at the menu.  The atmosphere was pretty chillax... loud music, people shootin' the shit; laughing...it definitely seemed like a place where a lot of people hit up right after work to let loose and have a beer.

We took a seat near the door and were greeted promptly by Kim (know her name from the receipt).  Anna decided to order 2 lbs of wings, 1 lb salt and pepper and 1 lb spicy teriyaki.  The other flavors were: Jack Daniel's BBQ, Jamaican Jerk, Salt, Chipotle, Carolina BBQ, Jethro's Hot Sauce or Ass Rippin'!  I decided to order half rack of the Kansas City pork ribs which came with two sides.  There was a big selection of sides which ranged from fries (garlic or boring), mashed, slaw, beans, BACON wrapped corn, soup, apples to cornbread.  I went with garlic fries and grilled seasoned vegetables.  Kim came by with our plates, utensils and some sauces (honey mustard, jack daniels bbq, and chipotle bbq) before bringing the food out.  First, the wings came out in baskets (lb of wings is about 8-10) and they looked big and JUUUUICY!  The wings were meaty, big and nicely battered for that crisp.  The salt and pepper were tasty and crispy and the spicy teriyaki was SPICY.  There was definitely a kick to the teriyaki.  When I first took a bite, I had to dive into my water asap.  Maybe I'm just weak/being dramatic (as per usual) but I thought they were so spicy that she mistakenly brought out ''ASS RIPPIN'\".  Nevertheless, we ate them all up.  The half rack was a little disappointing...I mean they were delicious but I thought they were going to be FALL OF THE BONE delicious (maybe the map dude hyped it up too much for us?!)  They were lightly covered in jack daniels bbq sauce but I squirted more on because the sauce was really good.  The garlic fries were nice, a perfect hint of garlic.  Vegetables were normal seasoned vegetables.

Kim was attentive and friendly.  The only thing was, I wish she was there to refill my glass when I chugged my water down cause my mouth was burning...but it's all good!!

Palomina is a place I would stop by if I was craving wings or something and if I happen to be in the area, but I don't think I would go out of my way for this bbq joint."}
{"text":"* Overpriced poor quality BBQ *

The tagline sums it up.  I was excited to dig into some really solid BBQ as this spot had great recommendations and Alberta is known as the Texas of Canada, so it was supposed to be good.  

I ordered the rib and brisket combo plate, which came with a choice of sides.  I picked corn bread and slaw.  The price was $23.  Kinda high, but if it was good I would also be ok with it.  But it wasn't.  

The ribs were rubberlike.  I don't know what they did to them but I had to literally gnaw at them to get any meat off the bone.  Ridiculous.  The brisket was also very also very overdone, and tasted as if they had put it into sauce and let it stew after smoking it.  Meh.  Corn bread was hard as a rock and served cold.  Slaw was overly mayoed.  Overall a VERY disappointing meal.  Meh.  Photo:  http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/the-palomino-smokehouse-calgary?select=Q77iq_y4uTUlCQvM9ygI7A#sdVNF8mHI8TVwoGy8d_-HQ

{"text":"Palomino! 
A rather special place.You will find yourself (or at least I find myself) Wanting to try everything here! from the sliced Brisket to the pulled pork poutine to the beef ribs! (which is all really good by the way!)  The palomino is a great place to come eat and drink and listen to some hardcore metal bands downstairs!.... WHAT??? Yep!  BBQ and rock 'n' roll come together here like no other place in Calgary! Let me tell you it is quite a lethal combination! Get ready!

So its divided into 3 parts. Main level, basement and outdoor patio. If you want a nice meal with no interruption then the main level is for you. You will be in a sort of \"pubby\" place with a bar in the centre, quite nice with a good amount of seating available! Sometimes you will be graced by a quiet and light band to play while you are enjoying a bbq dinner. 

Outdoor is nice! lots of chairs available and just has a cool feel to it because of the walls that surround you. 

Downstairs around 9 or so? Get your earplugs out and put your baby bib on because its about to get messy! Kind of a big open space with some tables, another bar and a very decent sized stage. 

I love this place! yet another unique venue/restaurant that has a certain charm! The BBQ alone is a good enough reason to come here.  
So next time you want to assault a few of your senses come to the Palamino! check it!"}
{"text":"What an awesome place in Calgary!! Centrally located and definitely great Alberta vibes.  The BBQ was delicious and portions were huge.  We had the deep fried pickles, smoked wings, and the 2 meat plate with brisket and ribs.  The brisket was a little dry but definitely still delicious.  Service was excellent and love that it was a more mellow and mature crowd.  A must go for a chill meal on a Tuesday night to wind down after a busy work day.   will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"Wow! This place is amazing. A great smokehouse. Wonderful prices amazing service and great poutine! I live in New York City so when I'm in Calgary I run around to all the places serving poutine. Probably the best I have had (I eat this stuff daily when I'm here) they have live music although I came during lunch so no music but the bar has a very western look and feel. Make sure you come by this spot. Well worth it! The plates are very big. So come hungry"}
{"text":"Come here regularly for lunch, and recently made a first time visit with wife for dinner. Best southern American BBQ restaurant in Calgary. Haven't been here for music yet but I've heard good things; there is a basement with a huge stage and performing center. The food is delicious, staff friendly and lots of good beer on taps. I took off a star for the price; it's very pricey compared to US BBQ joints."}
{"text":"One of my pals played here in the summer so I was able to go ~ I returned to bring a buddy from Vancouver about a week or two later. 

This place has a GREAT upper floor ambiance - not try hard, doesn't seem to scenester. Outdoor area at the back is meh, BUT at least there's something. 

Downstairs was small but great for the band. 

Being Vegan I can't eat a lot here, but it smells TO DIE FOR in there. I believe I did eat something on my second pass over however, I had been to a few pubs on the way and I can't remember enough to evaluate it fairly. 

Oh well, guess that means another trip!

Check it out."}
{"text":"My experience at the Palomino is largely relegated to the basement, though I have heard the joint is broken up into three levels, including a rooftop patio. We have played here about four times, and each time it has been an eventful gathering of people eager to rock out with metal knights. The food, or at least what I have sampled, makes me sad I haven't eaten more: the pulled pork was delightfully tender, and the burger I had was on the delicious side. An intriguing conceit of BBQ and metal music together in harmony in the heart of Calgary, but there is no better way to do it!"}
{"text":"i give the palomino 4 stars for beers, music, atmosphere & side dishes and 3 stars for meat. a few friends and i shared the 2 meat platter and opted for ribs and brisket with sides of beans and corn. we also shared some mac-n-cheese, garlic fries and pulled pork poutine. 

the poutine was far and away the best thing we ate. SOOOO good. super, super tasty. one of the best side dishes i've ever had!

in fact, all of the sides dishes were outstanding. the garlic fries were delicious and the beans/black eyed peas and mac-n-cheese were really tasty. the ribs were pretty good but the brisket was just so-so. the sides were much better than the main attractions. 

the rockabilly band that was playing was really good, the service was great and the atmosphere was just what we were looking for. the only bummer was that the patio was closed and it was the only somewhat warm and rain free night of my trip! 

i would definitely go back if i ever found myself in calgary again."}
{"text":"STEPH JUDGEMENT: Cool, fun place for live music in downtown Calgary.

Note: This review is just for their bar and live music space downstairs--I did not try any of their food. The bf and I were looking to see if there was any live music going on around town and found out that the band Andrew Jackson Jihad would be playing here so off we went. What we didn't think to do was buy tickets ahead of time, and we found out that the show was sold out, wah wah. However, the guy at the door told us that they often have people who need to sell a ticket so if we wanted to just hang out at the bar for a while we might luck out. So we plunked ourselves at the bar and proceeded to down some \"Canadian\" pints, which turned out to be 20 oz--4 oz more than standard US pints. Mind. Blown. Sure enough, after about half an hour, some people who needed to sell tickets turned up and we were in! The music venue is downstairs, in a pretty spacious basement-like space. The place was filled with young Calgarians hanging out and enjoying themselves, and we really liked the vibe--chill and casual. The sound was pretty good, and we enjoyed the bands a lot. All in all, we had a great time and would definitely go back if we ever find ourselves in downtown Calgary again!"}
{"text":"Another solid BBQ place in Calgary. This is definitely a great place to go if you are craving something smokey and delicious. 

I actually noticed this place because I wandered by when I was walking downtown and it's impossible to miss that lovely smokey/BBQ smell if you're on the block. However, it looks kind of like a hole in the wall. The entrance doesn't look like it's been updated in years, and that's ok because it just adds character. The entire decor is wood/country (to include buffalo head on the wall) and there is also a downstairs where there is live music on the weekends.

Ok onto the food. I have been here a couple of times now, so I think I can comment on the menu pretty well. My friends and I have ordered the brisket, the catfish, the veggie burger, the mac n cheese, the cesar salad, the chili, and the garlic fries. If I had to review this place based on the delicious and garliciness of their fries, this would be a 5-star review hands down. I mean, seriously, vampires beware, but everyone else should enjoy a-plenty.

The portion sizes are huge, so go hungry or be prepared for a to-go box (granted every time I've gone I have loved the food so much that I ate the entire meal.) 

I bet at this point in time you are wondering why I am only giving this place 4 stars then? Well, not everything is as amazing as those garlic fries. The bourbon apples are fairly tasteless, the chili is ok (the meat was very tough), and the service is also just ok. However, the catfish is delightful, the mac and cheese is also delicious, and the brisket is quality. 

The specialty cocktails are also pretty good, and the beer prices are pretty decent. This is a great place to go for a long lunch, after dinner drink, or even a weekend brunch. There are vegetarian options on the menu (if you can ignore the buffalo head on the wall) and I believe even a few gluten-free options as well. It's a fairly good place to go with a large group, just make sure to call ahead. 

All in all, like I said earlier, a great place for good times and smokey flavor."}
{"text":"A friend of mine went here and we split the Palomino Fat Ass Platter (For 4)
$69.  Yes, there was just two of us and we finished it all (my friend is a big guy).  We were royally stuffed.  Everything was good.  However, I'd have to say I wasn't too impressed with the chicken.  I felt the chicken was a bit on the dry side (even the dark meat was dry).

The Palomino is a staple in the area and hosts bands/DJ performances.  A great place to bring someone from out of town to give them a taste of how Calgary does BBQ."}
{"text":"Great staff. This is a very casual bar with great energy. Immediately inside you have a feeling of comfort. Live music, great beer selections and BBQ. 

I ordered a local steamwhistle beer to start off the meal. 
The food was excellent: I chose the 2 meat special with 2 sides. Ribs, brisket, bacon wrapped  corn and smoked beans. What a great combo the brisket was a tender, perfectly smoked piece of meat, ribs are crispy on the outside and tender In the middle, no sauce needed. The bacon wrapped corn was perfect with each bite, firm and tender. The beans cooked In house each day are a perfect combination of smoke and sweet. 
Enjoyed my visit. Great meal!"}
{"text":"Met a friend for dinner there tonight. The server only brought us one menu. After she brought us a couple of Cokes she didn't come to our table for 20 mins. After trying to get her attention a few times when she walked by we decided to just order off the bartender. We received the starters and the mains at the same time. The wings, brisket, and mac and cheese were alright at best. At this point we hadn't seen the server since she brought the food, so we had to go to the bar for more napkins and refills on the Cokes. The most we actually saw our server was when she hovered over us as we put the tip into the handheld credit card terminal. 

Food was somewhere between okay and decent. Service was somewhere between piss poor and terrible."}
{"text":"The good old Pal. The only place in the city that makes me want to commit a crime. The BBQ sauce is so good I have to fight back the urge to put a bottle in my purse as I leave. But in all honesty the best Mac and Cheese and chicken wings I've ever had. Not to mention a killer country and rock and roll atmosphere that makes me feel proud to be a little country."}
{"text":"Pulled Pork Sandwich.  That's all I should say to you.  This sandwich is absolutely delicious and it's only from the Palomino!

The Palomino gets a lot of a lunchtime crowd, since it's located right downtown.  They have a pretty decent lunch menu at quite average prices.  It seems like it's always pretty busy since there is always a crowd of smokers standing around outside.  The food is good ol' fashioned barbecue and it's always good!

At night, however, this place turns into a pretty decent bar!  They have loud music and sometimes the occasional hip hop rap show.  It's not so much a dance club as just a bar where people congregate to chat and drink and generally just have a good time.

The Palomino has a nice western-theme to it, which proves just how Calgary it really is.  I'm not really a western girl myself, but that doesn't change how much I enjoy dinner or a drink at the Palomino."}
{"text":"Although it smells like smokehouse heaven walking in, the bbq left me wanting more.  Big space, cool scene, so a good place to drink, but food is mediocre.  

Monday is apparently all you can eat rib night, for $20.  Unfortunately the ribs were tough, and needed a few more hours to really be properly cooked.  Sausage was terrible according to my Texas-based colleague.  Brisket was a 7/10, with a good smoke and decent crust, but cut a bit too thick to have the perfect consistency.  Chicken was also a 7/10, with good skin but more pigeon-sized than chicken.  

Beer is solid, with  20oz glasses and a decent selection by Canada standards.  Skip the wine.  

I don't have any other BBQ / smokehouse experience in Canada to compare this to, so maybe it's good by local standards.  If that's the case, get yourself to TX / NC / TN soon."}
{"text":"Had the chicken sandwich with garlic fries and roasted veggies.    Very very good.  Chicken was nice and juicy, the bacon crisp, the veggies nicely broiled and oiled.  The garlic fries had a bit too much garlic for my taste.  Did not stop me from eating them.   Fefinetly coming back."}
{"text":"I wish all barbecue were this damn tasty. Throw in exceptional service and an impressive selection of bottles and drafts and you've got a triple threat named after an elusive and beautiful gold-coated horse stampeding across your taste buds.

I wandered in on based on the recommendation of my friend Dale. I knew nothing about the place. All I knew was that if they wanted to impress me, they needed to shatter my preconceived notions about how you can't beat the barbecue I've had in the south or my home state of California. They worked on doing that right off the bat. The affable bartender read my indecisiveness and immediately gave me a a passionate walk-though of their extensive menu, reading off each specialty like a sacred passage from a beloved novel. Before I even ordered, my mouth was watering almost uncontrollably. 

I sat down at the large, horse-shoe shaped bar and drank a thirst-quenching organic draft while chatting it up with a friendly fellow playing hookie from work. When my food arrived - applewood smoked pork sandwich on a tender bun, bacon-wrapped corn and garlic fries that were as much garlic as potato - I knew I was in for a gut-expanding treat. The pork was sweet, smokey and had a great vinegar-like kick. The corn was a combination of bacon-fat buttery goodness. And the fries. Oh, the fries. As the menu warns, you might want to be doing any sales pitches after finishing off a healthy helping of these babies. 

I now see what all the locals are raving about. Between the food, the brews, the personalities of the staff and the ever-present glorious smoker in the corner, they have themselves a magical combination."}
{"text":"I came here by accident with my husband summer of 2016. I am wanting to go back because I'm having a hard time recalling all the details but believe the food is rather good. As a girl from the US Midwest, I know and can appreciate good comfort food. I had the BBQ pulled pork sandwich (without coleslaw, blegh.) The pulled pork was very tender and saucy, which i appreciate in a good bbq. Was not a fan of the cornbread stuffed with bits of jalepeño pepper. Maybe that's the southern version of cornbread, but back home it's subtle and sweet with a touch of honey. I feel like my husband enjoyed his meal. It was rather dead when we went ab I remember it being very dark in there with a lot of sports paraphernalia hanging on the walls. Very typical bar decor."}
{"text":"Pal-pal-pal-pal-pal-pah-pal...so maybe I can't sing your name to the tune of Barbara Ann, but I just want to keep coming back to your wooden saloon.

Two sides to the Palomino: the downstairs where you get punk rock/folk/post-hardcore basement shows, filled with people dancing with half broken pint glasses, musty chairs, a discarded pac-man video-game table (why won't you live again!) and some good ol' fashion dankness. 

And the upstairs: where you can fill your belly with some of the most delicious BBQ in the city. Just took our English born and raised - roots in Oklahoma in-law here for dinner and when he approves of the two meat platter with corn bread and beans, you got yourself a winner.

The Palomino's caesar is by far my favorite in Calgary and the bacon wrapped corn, corn bread and garlic fries are simply stellar. I need to increase my frequency of dinner visits but don't wish to be 200 pounds.

Don't go changing, please! I love you just the way you are."}
{"text":"A big disappointment, the cooks obviously have limited knowledge of real smoked bbq and no pride of what it is they serve. Our waitress was friendly but the food was a disgrace. 

The ribs were dry as well as the brisket that was served cold. The sides or \"fixings\" were sloppy and lacked soul.

This restaurant has an open kitchen that allows clientele to have a view on the cooks as they work. Clearly the standards are low and the kitchen personnel lacks experience, pride and energy."}
{"text":"It was right across the street from the hotel where we were staying (and we could see their patio right from the room window), so this is where we had lunch over the weekend.  

Between the somewhat lackluster service (by a waitress who admittedly didn't seem to care) and the rather bland food, I was far from impressed with this place.  The caesar salad had some zest, but for a place that seems intent on meat based meals, the burger I had lacked any real appeal whatsoever. It made me long for my vegetarian days."}
