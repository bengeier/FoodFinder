{"text":"Great food.  Great prices.  Appropriate for big groups, families, or date night. Emily served us and she was fantastic."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good but the service was so bad we couldn't stay. We waited over 20 minutes just to get a drink and by the time we got our order placed it was obvious the service was not going to improve so we changed our order to take out.

I would give them a pass if the place was busy but we were one of 2-3 groups at the restaurant. Unacceptable and I will not be back."}
{"text":"Uninspired bland sports bar. It has a very stupid name, it's weirdly laid out, the waitstaff are joyless zombies, and it has a surprisingly small beer list, but the food is good and served quickly. It has the advantage of being the only restaurant within 2 miles of the adjacent hotel."}
{"text":"I came here last Friday with some colleagues. There were about 12 of us and we were served courteously and efficiently. We didn't have a lot of time but we were served quickly and were out in time to get back to work. The food was good and everyone left happy and full. I had the bowl of chili which was really good. It was a big serving and I wasn't able to finish the bowl. Next time I want to have the chili I think I will try the cup instead. All in all a great experience and I will continue to come for  lunch  with my colleagues."}
{"text":"Boy it's been a long day and I see a place close to the hotel that's open!! Talk about it... Walked in hostess told me to be seated. Waitress came I've and asked me what I wanted. Guy walks over with the menu and says kitchen is closed... I looked down at my watch... it was 11:08... At most restaurants the kitchen closes 30mins before close of the business..."}
{"text":"we were in town for 3 nights and ended up eating here twice great bar food exactly what i expect, what more can a guy ask for!"}
{"text":"The food is great and much better then McKoy's Smokehouse a few miles down the road. The service is also very good! The ribs are the best thing in the menu. Lots of beers on tap, you also can't beat $2.75 draft day on Tuesday."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in the service and in the quality of food here. The wife and I were up from SC for a night out. We got our drinks rather quickly but it took forever for the waitress to take our food order. When the food did come, it was mediocre. I ordered a chicken sandwich and a beer and my wife ordered onion rings and a strong bow. That was literally the last time I saw my waitress. She had our section and the patio area. Why would you not schedule more help on a Friday night?? Poor customer service and shame on management for not preparing better. Warm beer and mediocre food. Not what I was expecting!!!!"}
{"text":"Didn't think the food would be good but I tried the Philly steak sandwich and it was very good. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"I don't recommend it. Not good. Gave them 2 chances and both times sucked. The sandwiches are always dry. Also, the hostesses don't seem to be very well trained. I went during lunch by myself and was told it would be about a 20min wait, so I sat at the bar. I walk back and can count 5 or 6 small tables that are wide open. Both visits I left feeling \"blah\" like I needed to eat lunch again somewhere else."}
{"text":"I would have to say that this place is really in line with most of the other restaurants of this genre. Medicore to OK food, nothing spectacular. Staff is always friendly, and I would assume that they pull a LOT of business from the hotel that shares the same parking lot. 
The drink specials are always a domestic and never anything special. All in all, it's a decent place to grab a quick bite, but don't go in expecting juicy burgers or stellar wings."}
{"text":"Ordered a simple grilled chicken salad. Over half the salad were stems, some of which had turned brown. Not at all worth the $9 I spent for a bed of lettuce stems."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this place.  I figured basic bar food but it was much better. I got the Kickin chicken sandwich.   Probably the best buffalo style chicken sandwich I've ever had.   They use a special hand made breading on there chicken that was really tasty.  A nice spice but not too hot.  Seems like a basic bar food menu, just done with higher quality ingredients and experienced cooks.  

A ton of nice TVs, lots of high tops, and a good selection of beers on draft too.   Exactly what a good sports bar should be."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled. Ate there three times (was staying at hotel nearby) and all were at best substandard. The ONLY reason to go here is for the televised games. I mean how can you mess up a philly steak and cheese!"}
{"text":"I used to come here years ago and thought it was an great sports bar. I stopped in on a Monday night and it was dead. There were only 5 people at the bar. In  their defense, it was a slow night for sports. MLB on the All Star break so no games were on the many HD TV's. The bartender was very good and took time to talk to the customers. I had 3 beers and bounced. I would definitely give in another try when I am in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Good food and awesome service. great place to eat h Sunday football! Management comes to visit customers and staff is the same for several years. Speaks volumes!"}
{"text":"Very Close to work so its just a 5 min drive for me so I thought I would give this place a shot...  This is a typical sports bar. If you are inside (or outside) there are TV's throughout the place. I don't see thing place as extra-ordinary but it is still a good place to come and get a fairly quick lunch without breaking the bank.  Its not really a takeout place although I'm sure you can but mostly sit-down atmosphere with daytime workers frequenting the place..

The food was actually good and I just had a Beer and burger.  During most lunch hours it did not seem too crowded, they had outside seating and courteous service..   I would visit again.."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great... Service is subpar... Waitress jacked up my order in many ways. Her customer service skills were a 3 on a scale 1-10. Each time she came to the table all she did would only ask my husband if she could get him anything else or how the food was. Wouldn't even make eye contact with me. Never filled my water glass once while
He got 3 refills. I'll be sure not to come here or recommend this establishment to anyone in the are for the future. If the waitress had better interpersonal skills with with women then I would recommend this place if they had fixed my order. Hands down, as long as there is professional curtesy and great food, then to me, the atmosphere doesn't matter. Fix your employee's demeanor or have them get a different job."}
{"text":"After a long drive from NJ to our hotel in the same parking lot, this place was lit up like a much needed oasis. We arrived after 10:00 pm and promptly greeted and seated by our awesome server Mike. My daughter ordered an amazing steak that was cooked perfectly since she likes her beef 'mooing'.  Her onion rings and accompanying sauce was epic. My wife had this fantastic pulled pork sandwich and I had the best burger sliders in a long time. Even the honey mustard and BBQ sauce was epic. Since we might be relocating to the Charlotte area, I am glad we can return.  But the highlight was Mike and his service, made us feel right at home and was very attentive. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Good selection of drafts on menu and awesome starters .. Don't mis their crispy beans"}
{"text":"I had read reviews that the customer service was not good, but we wanted something close to the airport. I must say that the customer service was actually awesome and our waiter Sean was extremely attentive. The manager even checked on our table twice. Way to go in exceeding expectations and giving A+ service !"}
{"text":"Holy TVs. They are absolutely everywhere. If you can't watch your favorite team in this place I don't know what to tell you. I only came here for a few beverages to watch NFL. An alright selection of beers on tap, I can't complain they had an IPA on tap. I actually had a mixed drink as well, which was pretty tasty and strong. Service was friendly and attentive and the bar area was very full."}
{"text":"Food is so-so (typical bar food) but the service is great so I will keep coming back. They are getting rid of the southwestern menu so I am not sure what I will order as I typically get the nachos. I am hoping new menu items will be added soon."}
{"text":"We had stayed at the Hyatt and was hungry after our drive so we decided to try this place out it was later in the evening on a Tuesday and I have to say we were not disappointed. The place is your typical sports type bar with tons of tv's all around and We were greeted by a nice guy who was our waiter forgive me i forgot his name but he waited on us right away got us our drinks and took our order. I had the pulled pork sandwich, my husband got the sliders and my daughter had the steak and our played were licked clean (not literally) but the food was delish. I would definitely come back the next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"Oh boy... I was traveling with colleagues who had eaten here before so I went with the flow when they suggested we stop here for a late dinner upon landing in NC. It's minutes away from Charlotte airport so that's a plus, but that's really the only thing it had going for it. I ordered the Swiss cheese and mushroom burger with no bun and a side salad rather than fries. What I got was a Swiss cheese and mushroom burger with no bun with some iceberg lettuce. It was comical. No lettuce, tomato, or onion was on the plate as was in the description. Maybe they consider a pile of iceberg lettuce a side salad? Either way, I'm going to do everything in my power to not eat here again next time we travel to NC! Also, every single stool was wobbly and the bathrooms were pretty messy."}
{"text":"The Minick's Family was here on Friday August 5,2016. We had a great time and the waiter was the best."}
{"text":"Had an early dinner here last night and the salmon entree is hands down the best I've had anywhere. My server Quinn said it was her favorite and that I wouldn't be disappointed. She was correct!  I wasn't able to last night, but I will be back to enjoy the $2.75 draft beer deal they had going on."}
{"text":"There is really nothing special about this place.

If you are at the Hyatt across the parking lot for a week due to a work conference, you get stuck with the overpriced and bland stuff in the hotel or the overpriced and bland stuff here.

In three straight days, their drink specials have been either Bud Light or Miller Lite (depending on the day) at $2 a pint. That's it. Happy hour is non-existant. Well drinks are $6 each. I'd expect to pay that downtown but not out here in the boonies.

In addition, the food is not seasoned. Nothing special about the burgers. Chips and fries are just thrown in a fryer and then on the plate. Servers don't care too much about you and largely ignore you.

About the only plus is the outdoor seating and large number of televisions. If you are in a car, you would be better off going some place else. Otherwise, if you are stranded in the hotel, just suck it up and wait to go back home."}
{"text":"Good place to eat especially if you are staying right next door at the Hyatt! If you go there you have to get the tots! The original are very good and the sweet potato ones taste like more of a dessert, and they are just as good the next day cold! Lots come in 1 order so they are an easy share! They have a big variety choice on wing flavor!! They are tasty and filling!! They also have TVs everywhere so you an catch your game!"}
{"text":"Had a great afternoon experience with my wife. Want to thank Courtney for taking great care of us. Love the wings here and checking out the Cajun chicken"}
{"text":"Amazing food !! The blackened salmon reminded me of my hometown!! I would definitely recommend this sports bar.."}
{"text":"We are from California and we just landed and went straight here. They were so nice and the food was excellent. We had the best server. Over all this place was amazing. So impressed!"}
{"text":"This place is just blah.  We went here on a weekday evening, and it was not crowded.  There were 8 in our group and the staff said we could go sit outside.  They didn't have anything open elsewhere, but from the looks of it there were plenty of seats available inside.  We mentioned it would be cold outside, but they said they had heaters out there (they were not on and would not come on when we tried to get them on).

There are plenty of tv's outside - only 2 were large flat screen, while others were small tubes.

I agree with one of the other reviewers how the staff members are like zombies, they are not very responsive.  Service was extremely slow for a slow night at the restaurant.  Took awhile for everything from getting menus outside, then drinks, food, and eventually our bill.

Food is very bland, lacking good flavor.  I was wanting a combination of the chicken and burger sliders - you get 4 of the sliders (I wanted 2 of each chicken and burger) and both are the same price, but they would not combine the two.  So Kevin and I just got the chicken sliders and split them.  

It was a convenient place for us at the time, but there are plenty of better sports bars in the area with better tasting food and service."}
{"text":"I stopped in here this week, for the first time in years to catch the Wofford vs. Wisconsin basketball game.  It was about 3:00pm, and only the bar side of the building was being seated. Can I say it was an utterly chitty experience, and leave it at that?"}
{"text":"Good spot for beer sports and food.
I've been here 3 days in a row while on business in the area. Great food and close to the local hotels. 
Trivia night tonight. Great ambiance. I'm guessing I'll be back tomorrow (trivia pun!!). 

Plus: Fat Tire on tap. A treat for a Canadian who can't get Fat Tire at home. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I was staying in Charlotte and didn't want hotel food. The airport shuttle driver suggested that we try here. It was above average, and better than the hotel"}
{"text":"No way is this place as good as Barney's Beanery back home, but with only an hour left before they closed, the bartender took care of us with food & drinks, no problem. My only complaint is, why are all the televisions tuned to the same channel? Lame.

Have the onion rings! Seriously, the BEST I've ever had. Great, now I'm sure someone is gonna challenge me on this one later on down the line, but, whatever, dude!"}
{"text":"It's an ok place. Food was alright at best. Prices are good though, so I didn't feel like my money was completely wasted. Perfect place to go to after a long day at work. Good selection of beer and all."}
{"text":"Met a friend for a quick lunch.  I got there early, which rarely ever happens so I sat at the bar for probably 15 minutes.  They had my favorite beer on draft (which I can't get in CT where I live) so I had to get one, even though it was lunch on a Tuesday. :)  Compared to pints in the Northeast, $3 felt like a steal!  The bartender was friendly and fast with service.
Once my friend arrived, we moved over to a regular table outside the bar.  We each got a lunch special... her, a cup of chili and a half sandwich; me, the grilled fish tacos.  She seemed to enjoy her, complimenting what a great price it was and the perfect amount of food for lunch.  My tacos were great!  I loved that the fish was grilled and came with rice and black beans.  The salsa and toppings were fresh.  The table service was fast and courteous."}
{"text":"Jocks and Jills is kind of out of the way, but being that I used to live off Tyvola Road, it was fairly convenient to visit on occasion.  It's an A-OK restaurant with some beer specials and your regular bar food like burgers, sandwiches, salads, etc.  Nothing really stands out, but sometimes that's okay.  Sometimes you just want regular bar food and a few brewskies.  And Jocks and Jills fills the bill.

One thing I like about the restaurant is its high ceilings.  It doesn't make you feel as confined as other restaurants, and there is a lot of seating.  I'm surprised they've been able to stay in business because I never see it very busy, but I hope they'll be able to stick it out until they do something with the old Coliseum area.  It would be nice to have a \"neighborhood bar\" still there."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor, and do not order the Philly Cheesesteak.  Onion rings were decent."}
{"text":"I would never recommend this place to anyone....ever. I sat at the bar for 5 mins. Watched a guy and a girl walking back and forth. The girl finally stopped and asked if I had been help. I said, \"No\". She took my drink order and asked if I was going to eat something. I said \"Yes\". She handed be a menu and walked away. I sat there for an entire hockey period (20+ mins). The girl never stopped back by and the guy never looked my direction. (asked the guy next to me if he wanted another drink, but never looked at me) After the period was over, I threw cash on the bar for my drink and left. Never placed an order...nothing. I will never return nor recommend this place to anyone.
If you gave this place a good review, you must have low expectations of a sports bar."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times with Work colleagues for lunch. I am completely underwhelmed. First impression  is that there is a strong off putting smell when you walk into the restaurant. The food is always sub par- todays salad was frozen to the bottom of my plate."}
{"text":"Hands down, THE BEST SOUPS IN CHARLOTTE! I've been coming here for lunch for over a year and this place rocks! Friendly staff - try the soup!!!"}
{"text":"I was at the nearby Hyatt recently and went here for dinner.  I enjoyed the food and lively atmosphere.  And then I left my credit card there and didn't realize it until the next day when I got to the airport. So I called and got the manager \"JJ\" who said yes, they found it and he'd mail it to me. Sure enough, 3 days later I got it in the mail (in Connecticut) with a nice note. 

Great customer service... thanks JJ!"}
{"text":"Here's where they lost the stars:

Service: Horrible! Please do us all a favor and if you do not want to work with people, skip the interview where any customer interaction is required. The hostess looked at my group of six like we had three eyes when we asked for our table. Seriously?  When we were finally seated our waitress came out and threw our coasters down on the table and asked for our drink orders. Seriously? When it was time to take our order, she  barely gave us time to finish saying what we wanted before she was on to the next person. Again, Seriously?

Food: The fries were cold AGAIN. One time, okay maybe it's a fluke. But the SECOND time makes it the \"norm\" within your location. Unacceptable. The burger was overcooked and dry...Just No, no, no!

The whole thing just seem like an inconvenience...for everyone. I didn't enjoy myself or the food.

It will be a while before I give this place another chance."}
{"text":"Here fans can find sports bar food, done in an ordinary fashion.  Television viewing was well thought out, even if the food is not.  You can literally see a TV no matter what seat you are in. I can't say I've ever been to a sports bar with good food.  Maybe it's too much to ask to want to watch the world cup and have a decent meal."}
{"text":"Disappointing chicken nachos and steak salad.  Atmosphere great, but food not worth the price.  Chicken use to be pulled with little bit of kick, but this chicken was chunks with no taste.  Steak salad was more like cucumber salad and for $14 expected more."}
{"text":"Great little bar/restaurant, the philly cheesesteak was very tasty and the beer selection is nice.  Worth the visit."}
{"text":"To be honest, I eat here weekly and it's great! The atmosphere is sports bar / restaurant and the food is excellent! Service is fast and friendly. I order salmon or steak and both are great. 
They don't have a lot of GF options but the fish and steak are always a go to. 
I highly recommend if your looking for a laid back casual dinner."}
{"text":"Fantastic lunch menu. My fav is BBQ Chicken pizza/house salad combo. Delicious!  

Tons of TVs around the bar. They label the TVs with what game will be on which is nice. Staff is awesome! 

Large outside covered patio with a few heaters (though only one works now) and several TVs (small ones)."}
{"text":"Good if your travelling, & staying nearby. Service wasn't great, not horribile either. You are getting what you pay for here."}
{"text":"I work literally next door, yet we always forget about Jocks & Jills when it comes to lunch.

They have good lunch specials (I got a meatball sub & fries for about $5), but its nothing to write home about.  

You can reserve tables/rooms for groups which is nice when a large work group is coming, but don't expect to get in and out quickly."}
{"text":"More 2 1/2 stars that 3.
I dined with three coworkers. 
The food \"we\" ordered was just... meh.
Some of the other plates coming out of the kitchen looked better.
Two of us ordered the Salmon.
Half of mine was dry. How they did that I do not know.
The plate was missing the rice, so they brought me plate out quickly.
It was gross and overcooked. Should have left it in the kitchen
Another had a salad and that looked OK.
The last diner had the fish tacos. He said they were just OK. The fish was good, but the rest of he ingredients were unimpressive.
I added 1/2 star because a table next to us ordered several burgers and I saw a couple of the fried shrimp plates be delivered. THOSE looked good. But I will never go back and try them since I have a car and there are many more places that are better nearby."}
{"text":"I don't know anything about their food because I never made it that far...
My husband works right down the street so we decided to go there on his 1 hour lunch break. We walked in and waited at the front counter for about 5 minutes or so, the hostess finally walked up appearing as if we were disturbing her, we told her we needed a table for 2 and she dropped the bomb \"it will be about 20 minutes before we have a table available\".  The place did not seem to be super busy and we would have sat at the bar if that were an option because by the time we got back in the car and drove to another location to eat, lunch was almost over!! So needless to say, our once a month lunch together was ruined and we ended up with fast food in the car so he would not be late getting back to the office. 
Moral of the Story: Don't Eat HERE if you only have 1 hour for lunch!!!"}
{"text":"When ever we are in Charlotte we make an effort to get over to this restaurant.  We can count on good food and plenty of choices. Helpful that it's not far from airport.  Atmosphere is warm wood with entertaining sports memorabilia abounding. My pre-teen kids just love it.  One is picky, likes mostly salads and she can always find something on the menu (phew!)  Love the BBQ ribs and pulled pork.   Burgers are big and tasty too. Couple steps above bar food for sure.  Don't care for the cole slaw unfortunately (pretty plain). ok servers, typically friendly but there are a few that are just so-so. This trip we had Sean who was wonderful. Lots of TV for those who like that. And I (not a TV or sports fan)"}
{"text":"They're not very organized for watching games at all. There are 200 televisions in this place and seven NFL games playing but nowhere in the place can you find a television where I could hear my game.
It's just not very well-designed is laid out so the TVs are all far away and some of them are analog quality."}
{"text":"The food is not bad here but the service usually is awful. I have worked near Jocks and Jill's for over 8 years and has eaten there often. However, I go less frequently and probably will not return. The past 9 out of ten times, the service is beyond awful. My last visit was on Friday, 4/10 and I went for a late lunch, arriving around 2 p.m. Of course the dining area was closed and a sign stated to site at the bar area or outside. We chose to site at a two top in the bar area. There were only a few other patrons there. The server finally took our drink order and gave use menus.  She then dropped the drinks off and took our food order. A food runner dropped our food off. My friend had to flag someone else down since her order was incorrect. Once again, I received poor service and they were not busy at all. I guess it is normal for the servers to think they do not have to put in an effort when they are not busy. She never refilled my drink nor came back to check on us. My friend had to flag her down to get a to go box. I asked for a to go cup and the server asked did I want it filled up, after looking at my empty drink. To make matters worse, there was a gnat flying around and finally in my food, so I only ate half my salad. I am sure the server saw me swatting but cared less. Needless to say she got no tip and lost two customers. I am sure this review will make no difference to the business since I have complained several times online and got no response. Before I have sat outside and the server actually forgot about us.  Again, had to get up and flag server down. There is NEVER a manager present."}
{"text":"The description said...\"cheesy creamed spinach served with warm chips\".  What I received was \"milky spinach served with room temperature chips\".  The dip would not even sit on the chip. It ran off. Nothing remained on the chip. The chips were fresh though.  I used to enjoy this restaurant and the atmosphere.  It's not the same.  There was no service with a smile nor was there a thank you please come again. Just my bill and the server disappeared. That's exactly what I'll do...and I won't return."}
{"text":"My new favorite sports bar. If you are a hockey fan, this place is amazing. They have several pieces of memorabilia including an autographed Mark Messier Jersey and stick signed by Jaromir Jagr. The food was amazing and prompt and good value. Try the meatloaf."}
{"text":"Came in last night, it's was a party of 5. The server was friendly and very attentive. A friend ordered chips and salsa as the appetizer, and the salsa was very yummy. For dinner I opted for the \"the Texas ranger\" which is a rib eye with 2 sides.  I opted for the cesar salad as one of my sides and it was good. I ordered my ribeye med and mashed potatoes and gravy as my other side. The food was good, and the steak was definitely cooked to perfection. I'm a hard cider person, and my first time trying strong bow and I was impressed. There wasn't a wait and we were also seated promptly. I'd definitely return."}
{"text":"Long gone are the days with the Hive across the street with a hoppin' Jocks and Jills for some post-game fun.  This place looks like it haz a sad now.  Dark, carpets are in need of cleaning or replacement, tables and chairs are wonky, booth seating has seen better days.  I work just down Tyvola and had not been for a few years, where it formerly was a pretty regular place to grab a quick lunch.  It was fine, nothing stellar, but it was fine for a quick, reasonably priced lunch.

I didn't see my old favorite of a fried chicken wrap on the menu, so I went with a fried chicken salad.  It was fine *shrug*.  Service was good enough and kept drinks filled and was prompt with getting us the check and processing payment.  It's a large restaurant with lots of seating, plenty of TV's throughout playing whatever version of a sport is on at the time.  It just seems J&J has lost it's buzzzzzzzzzzzz.  

They do have quite a bit of outdoor seating, and they used to have TV's out there, though I didn't notice on the last trip if they were still there or not.  It was relatively busy for lunch, so they must still be doing okay with the office park crowd around here.  It was A-OK."}
{"text":"My fave quick stop. I like to come here, get good food and a couple beers. The service is always good and I am always satisfied with food. I would recommend this to a friend. Family environment as well."}
{"text":"The drinks are weak but cheap if they were stronger I would give them 5 stars cause the food especially the fried shrimp Decore  and location is on point I'll be back"}
{"text":"We stopped in here to have dinner one night when we were staying by the airport. It's the typical sports bar scene, complete with TVs and wooden high tops. The food was decent and plentiful, good sales of beers, and it was all very casual. We got an order of the sweet potato tots and they came with a side of brown sugar... delicious! However, the service was slow and the bathrooms were a complete mess. This is an okay place to stop if you don't want to travel too far from the airport. But, if you want a great meal with a nice atmosphere, I would not suggest this place."}
{"text":"I wasnt inpressed. I was in Charlotte for business and stayed at the Hyatt Place and Jocks was in the same parking lot. 

I went with 2 of my coworkers. I had the steak salad and tater tots. I love me some tots. I also had a a Michelob Ultra. My coworkers had s philly cheese steak, chili and a fried chicken salad. It is all typical pub food. 

My salad lettuce was wilted. The steak wasnt seasoned very well. The tots were veey crispy and good. 

My coworkers all agreed that their food was just ok.

The bill was average.

The service was friendly but a little slow. 

The place seemed a little depressed.

I probably would only go back if i was ataying in the same hotel and was tired and just wanted a burger or wings."}
{"text":"Ate dinner here tonight. Service was a little slow but the food was good. It's a sports bar so the usual memorabilia and flat screens all over. Again, it's a bar so don't expect a Morton's or a McCormick and Schmick."}
{"text":"This is an alright place to eat at and enjoy a beer. It's typical bar food and the drinks are average. It's not anything special here, but nothing I would try and avoid either. I wouldn't go out of my way to go here, but would return if some friends wanted me to meet them there. The place is very spacious with many TVs for games."}
{"text":"Always come in here if I'm close by to grab a nice cold cold beer on draft. Great selection and they always have pretty good specials."}
{"text":"I have been to J&J's dozens of times. The food is above average, wings, sandwiches, burgers, soups and appetizers have never disappointed. Service has always been very good. Great place to watch sports or relax on the patio."}
{"text":"This was decent. It's been years since we have been here because of the location. We were near here so figured we would check it out. Our waitress was very good. The sweet potato puffs were amazing. They serve them with brown sugar cinnamon. Yum. My daughter enjoyed her burger and my other liked her philly sandwich. I had shrimp- they were a little on the salty side and hubby had a turkey burger which he said was good. Decent."}
{"text":"Good sports bar with bigger menu variety.
Service is friendly and fast. Not too loud on weekdays but don't know what it's like on weekends."}
{"text":"Tons of TVs with run of the mill food bar food. Service is consistent, beers are cheap and there are tons of screens to watch sports on. 

I've sampled a few different items but nothing has blown my mind. I do like the sweet potato tots though. The cajun chicken sandwich wasn't bad but I wish the bottom piece of bread didn't come out soggy.

They have a large dining area, bar seating, a private room that you can reserve if you are bringing a large group and a pretty nice patio with TVs. 

If you are looking for a sports bar in the area Jocks & Jills is a decent choice."}
{"text":"Great place to watch sports.  Pretty good service and food is ok for bar food.  Would agree with the others that it is a little out of the way."}
{"text":"Visiting NC for business and went to Jocks and Jill's since it was right next to our hotel, only a 2 minute walk away. Not a large menu, but friendly staff and good food. Overall not a bad place to stop and get lunch/dinner."}
{"text":"Waiting here for 10 minutes now and no one has waited on me. This is frustrating. Not a drink or a menu. Beware people."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! I had never been and a friend told me about it. The burger was great and the atmosphere was fun. Not to mention Emily took such good care of us! I'll definitely be back to see her! She's awesome!"}
{"text":"Wings were awesome...and the service was great. Mike took good care of us. Will be back."}
{"text":"This is really a fan sports bar. Menu isn't very large but wings were really good. Excellent place to watch a ball game. Tons of TVs and management will get the ball game on TV that you want to watch."}
{"text":"Went to try out TopGolf but the wait was HOURS, so we jumped on our smart phones and hit up a sports bar instead. 

Tv's are plentiful, and even though there was no big event on, we had fun watching old football shows and reminiscing about the Panthers. 

Our server was great; friendly and attentive but not hovering.

The food leaves you wanting better sports bar food. The nachos were tasty, but on really flimsy chips. The spinach dip was more of a fake tasting cheese sause than a fresh spinach dip. My burger (ordered medium) was more on the rare side, and the French fries left me questioning, \"should I have just gotten a side salad?\" It's a traditional sports bar menu that lacks some originality and flair. 

You'll have a great time and eat a ton of calories! Just leave room for when you want REAL good bar food later."}
{"text":"Decent sports bar that is near where I work but never seems to be the first joint on my mind.  

My wife and I came on a whim.  We heard they have great wings and I wanted wings. Yes they do. Very tasty and a good value.

The bar here is huge.  I wish more establishments had this much space to sit and enjoy all the TVs. Wow.  I could look left to right and see 6 different shows

Mike served us at the bar.  He rocks. Very polite and personable.  I like observant bartenders and Mike is the king.

Biggest drawback here for me is the beer selection. The drafts are weeks with the exception of the Sweetwater IPA and OMB Copper. The later is a fallback beer for me: just saying.  

They have a semi-ok.  They had the NODA Hip Drop 'N Roll in cans.  Works for me in a pinch.  

Lots of meeting space and breakout rooms.  Definitely a great place to hold an event.

Music is great, people are friendly and I like this place as a stop over.  

All in all, I'll be back"}
{"text":"After two long days of business we decided to eat near our hotel and this was the only option. It is a bar and bar food. At first we sat at the bar since there was a private party on the patio but asked the hostess to let us know when we could move outside since she said it was wrapping up. The tables at the bar are sticky! The server said, yeah they are just like that. Gross! Thankfully a minute later we were able to move to the patio. Actually really nice out there. Our server was very sweet too. Actually everyone was very friendly there a big plus! Some good beers on draft and my boss got a lemon drop martini she really enjoyed. We started with the spinach dip. This was weirdly very watery. Not sure why...tasted meh...my boss ordered the steak salad and I got the club sandwich. The food was average which is actually fine by me at a bar. As long as it is decent that is what is to be expected. The dip was a little off but meals not bad."}
{"text":"Not bad for a beer and burger at the bar if you're on a business trip. I'm sure there's better choices in the area though."}
{"text":"Great place to hangout,watch a game!

Great selection of drinks and appetizers."}
{"text":"Food was good and quick. The place was filthy. Server finally picked up the knife and napkins and straws in the floor."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this is a tale of two tales. First is the experience at the bar. Very attentive and good bar tenders. The second part of the story isn't so good. I ordered the ribs, the menu said fall off the bone. But when they bring you your ribs with a steak knife you know that can't be good. While cutting through the ribs I was worried I would slip down and my plate would go flying from pressing so hard down to try and cut through. They were so hard and dry it was sad. The bottom of the ribs were burnt black. I nibbled on them for a while because I couldn't be bothered sending them back and re-order. I still gave them a good tip because I ate at the bar and they were doing a good job. Please take your ribs off the menu, they make this place look really bad."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!

I have gone to this restaurant more than once to give it a chance and each time I've been there, I have walked away disappointed. Their food isn't all that great. I've had their salad (the lettuce was brown in some spots and warm), chicken sandwich (which was EXTREAMLY dry), and a few appetizers that I wasn't a big fan of. 

The last time I was there, an hour lunch turned into almost 2 hours and I wasn't even there during rush hour. The waiter I had (I forgot his name) had the, \"I really don't want to be here today,\" attitude. He was very slow, probably waited a good 45 minutes just for a burger (my husband ordered) and a chicken sandwich (my order). When asked about the progress of the food, he just waved us off saying it's coming. When our meals finally came, they were cold and just nasty. It takes a lot for my husband to say, \"ok, this doesn't taste good,\" but he refuses to go back. 

I could keep going on about this, but Im sure you've gotten the picture already. If you're passing by and you've never been there before, keep going down the road, it's not worth it."}
{"text":"The service sucked, I ordered a mixed salad and got Caesar salad. The wings were over cooked. I ordered ranch and got blue cheese?  The ribs were dry. Wow. 

Not sure what else to say."}
{"text":"Located across from the old Coliseum, this place used to be packed out all of the time. Now most of their customers are the work crowds on lunch break. While this place isn't anything too special in the food department (mainly above average bar food), it's not a bad place to either sit outside or catch a game. They have tons of tv's without a really bad view in the house. It's always packed for lunch but the line usually goes pretty quickly.

I'd check out Jock's & Jill's if you were in the area for lunch one day but probably wouldn't head that direction just to go there."}
{"text":"Excellent service,  wings medium are really hot to me but other than that,  love the place"}
{"text":"Came in because it was on the same lot as my hotel.  Sat at the bar.  Had great service and the bartenders where very friendly and attentive.  Good place to have a beer, food and watch a game with friends or alone.  Will definitely come back!  Food was good and big portions."}
{"text":"Pretty average. Was told by the waitress the burger was fresh ground beef (never frozen) and they cut/smoked their own bacon. Should have known better but trusted the statement. Was cheap thin basic microwaved bacon and not sure about the burger but if it was fresh ground they need to find a new source."}
{"text":"Its ok pub food. I have had decent experiences here. Its close to my job so its convenient.  The inside is a little dark."}
{"text":"Wow did this place suck. I came here for lunch with a work collesfur. I am from out of town but this was the closest place and it did nothing for me. Dirty interior, poor service. I just got a chicken salad and it was not memorable."}
{"text":"Jocks and Jill's is your typical sports bar. They have numerous TVs all playing different games. I came to watch a specially aired college football game so we had a nice private room and our own waitress. 

There wasn't anything special about it. The food was good, typical beer selection. One nice thing about it is the location. Since it is off the beaten path, it's not crazy crowded like most sports bars on a Saturday and Sunday."}
{"text":"I've gotta agree with Ian M on this one...Jocks & Jills does the job. It fills the void of a sports bar with decent food, spacious booths, plenty of TV's (even on the patio) and friendly service. If you need a bar to catch a game, enter Jocks and Jills.  

While there aren't any really special characteristics to this place, it's just fine overall. I snacked on a quesadilla and sampled hubs' turkey club. Both meals were just fine and quieted my rumbling stomach. I washed that down with a Blue Moon as the bar was out of champagne (for a mimosa) and Strongbow. Expect fairly priced eats to go along with your TV eye. 

And hey - they have sweet potato tots. That's a win on its own!"}
{"text":"Nice place to go afterwork for a drink or to catch a game but average food fare    better places to go for meal"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for college football Saturdays for the past few years now. I think they've earned another star. 

I'm a fan of the burgers here. They are huge! The menu item you wouldn't think to order here- the fish tacos. My server recommended them and I was pleasantly surprised. They also have tater tots as a side item. Why don't all restaurants have toys?! App-wise, I like their wings and the chips with queso and homemade salsa. 

I love how friendly the staff is here. The servers all know our group members by name. They take really great care of us. 

Jocks is the home of both Nebraska (Go Huskers!) and North Dakota State watch sites. The bar is always full of people during college football games. They've got a ton of TVs. Nice sports bar option if you're in this part of town."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, great atmosphere.   The bartenders are wonderful and would recommend everyone giving this place a try"}
{"text":"Sometimes I wonder why people can't just appreciate a great sports bar.  If you want fancy food head to South Park.  If you want a quiet dinner...you may want to pass.  BUT if you want every sports game on a gagillion flat screens, a fun covered patio, great drink specials and the best tater tots in town than you have found the place.  I work across the street and this place really works on creating a \"Cheer's\" like environment.  Bartenders and regulars get to know you.  People do not feel strange sitting at the bar alone.  And I will admit to doing some of my online work here using the free WiFi.  

Go...grab a cheap beer...watch a game...say hi to a bartender and EAT THE TOTS!"}
{"text":"Jocks and Jills is a very clean sports bar with a decent menu. It is a bit lacking in the beer selection. Excellent place to go for lunch, and would be great for watching football games. The drawback here is the location; it's in the middle of nowhere. There is really NOTHING else on this road other than office buildings, and that's about it. So of course it draws mainly a corporate crowd, which is a shame, because true sports fans are missing out."}
{"text":"Good, very friendly service. Delicious food. From out of town and we came in to watch the hockey game. The tv was quickly changed when we requested it within view."}
{"text":"The chicken sandwich got me right for a 10 bucks. Awesome sports atmosphere, watched my Capitals win the Stanley cup game 5. Hahaha, great environment and ever better tater tots."}
{"text":"Went here based on recommendation from the hotel. There wasnt much in the area. It was a friday night they didn't have the nba all star game on just olympic ice skating and the sports illustrated swimsuit awards as well as 20/20. The waitress constantly forgot things that we asked for. She did not know the menu. and the spicy lemon pepper wings were way to spicy to even taste the lemon pepper. I sent them back and I over heard the gentleman in the booth behind me send his back for the same reason. I did enjoy the sandwich and fries that I ordered afterwards. If im in the area again, I dont know if id go back, maybe if there are no other options."}
{"text":"NOT your typical sports bar! The food is good, menu varied, fare is extremely economical and staff is super friendly. 

Right side of the restaurant has lively feel to it and a bar. left side is quieter with booths perfect for breakfast... And in the summer we all show up to hang out on the deck with our dogs;) 

This is a place where you can count on a very economical meal of solid favorites like wings, fish tacos, nachos and more. 

The staff remember regulars and go out of their way to make folks feel at home.  Who does that anymore? 

I for one love this place - I've had fancy shmancy all over the world and it's overrated.  

Welcome home to J&Js ~"}
{"text":"It's a regular sports bar - don't expect too much. I will say that this is useful in that it's across a hotel that you're put up in if you have to stay in Charlotte. The bartender was pretty nice and the prices are decent. My only issue was the crowd is a little questionable as there is also a random apartment complex across the street.

I ordered the salmon and veggie salad which was decent - the salmon was well made and the veggies were grilled. The salad itself was basic. I also had a glass of there house merlot for $7. They do have a lot of variety so if you're craving a burger or wings, it's probably the place to go."}
{"text":"Food is great, but service sucked. Our waitress never cleared appetizers off the table. Two other waitresses ended up bringing us food because for some reason our waitress was preoccupied. Two stars because the food was good, but again, service sucked."}
{"text":"The wait staff here is slow and sucks, with the exception of Christina (aka The word up girl)."}
{"text":"I come here every time I stay at the Renaissance Marriott! It has all the channels with any sport you like. Eric, the manager, is a great guy and always makes sure you watch the game you want! 

The salads are surprisingly my favorite thing on the menu! The Bangkok Salad and the Fried chicken salads are awesome.

Great beer selection and just the perfect place for a meal on the road watching your favorite team and drinking a nice cold beer!"}
{"text":"Ok, not bad for as close to the office it is. It has a range of choices. Service at the bar to pick up was nice and he accuracy of the order was decent (they forgot the extra blue cheese and extra crackers) and they also forgot it the 1st time I came it. The hostess was nice and showed me where to pick up the \"to-go\" orders. Burgers are good, fries were good, they have a kids menu so it's ok to bring the family. They have TVs and the place seem clean. Overall decent meal."}
{"text":"JJ's does the job.  If you are looking for an American bar food style restaurant with a million and one TVs.. Then you have come to right place.  The burgers and sandwiches are XL and the wings looked delicious.  Honestly, there wasn't a bad seat in the house.  I'm talking... TVs everywhere and at every angle.  You can't go wrong.  Only negative thing was that it has zero unique or creative qualities.  But at least you know that you are getting quality and comfort.  Enjoy

-Ian M."}
{"text":"I came to Jocks & Jills to watch football on a Sunday.  If you are looking to catch any or every NFL game this is a good place to go.  Didn't count the exact number, but enough flat screens so that each game was up on at least 2 TV's.  Each TV was labled with the game so it makes it easy to find the game you are interested in and get a seat.  There were quite a few people there watching the games and the atmosphere was good.  Everyone was friendly and chatted about their teams and plays from the different games going on.  I orderd the chicken wings with along with onion rings.  Pretty standard wings, the sauce was pretty good, but the wings were a little over cooked, but still good.  The onion rings were probably frozen, but still OK for me.  The had some beer specials going on which is pretty standard.  The service was OK too, the only mishap was the server brought blue cheese for my wings instead of ranch, but she quickly got me a ranch when I told her about the mistake.  You typical chain sports bar.  The food was OK but, I would probably go back here for the TV's and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Service was prompt at the bar. Already had dinner in town. Had two draft beers and woke with horrible headache. Clean the tap lines?"}
{"text":"First impression was great. The bartender was attentive and quick with a beer. Plenty of screens for sports. A bit slow on a Friday night.

The food: I only had chicken nachos. They came out super fast (5 minutes tops). So the chicken was obviously not fresh grilled, and they used liquid nacho cheese instead of melting shredded cheese. I was hungry. So, I got past those thoughts and they went down just fine."}
{"text":"Ate here after covering the Ravens-Panthers game on Nov. 21 and the food was what you would expect from a sports-themed restaurant. 

I will say that the mahi-mahi sandwich was quite good. But what sold me was the young bartender, who allowed my friend and I to order just before the kitchen closed for the night. And before we could finish our $1.50 Miller Lite drafts, he brought over freshly-filled mugs -- gratis. That kind of service is definitely worth a star."}
{"text":"I am giving it 5 stars because of he staff. Everyone that works here is super friendly and attentive. I sat at the bar and both bartenders introduced themselves to me by name and remembered mine the rest of the night. Food was above average but the service made it forgettable."}
{"text":"Great place to watch ANY sport in event! Tons of televisions that air pretty much anything requested. Good beer selection, and a standard bar-type menu (wings, burgers, etc.). Highly recommended for the avid sports fan who enjoys a cold one and some decent food!"}
{"text":"Wife and I had lunch here. We started off with the blue chips which were excellent. I had the turkey burger and she had the grilled chicken salad. Both were good except the chicken was extremely charred on the grill. 

I would definitely eat here again though."}
{"text":"Great food and I happened to be there this past Sunday after not watching football all day until that evening. It was great checking out all of the games."}
{"text":"Excellent food and large portions! Atmosphere is clean and friendly! Will look for Jocks &Jills in the future!"}
{"text":"I spent 20 minutes waiting for water after I sat down.  It never came. I actually asked the manager for the water and a Jack and Coke.  I waited patiently for 20 minutes.   I left and enjoyed another trip to McKoy's.

I never had a chance to try the food.  My suggestion is to avoid this place."}
{"text":"Good beer selection, variety of American food. Good atmosphere with tons or TV's. There is no bad seat to see a TV.  Walking distance to Hotel."}
{"text":"One if my favorite places to eat when I'm in CLT! Courteous service. Food is always prepared as ordered, and they give a 25% to airline employees! Close to the airport and many hotels it's a great place for visitors and locals alike!"}
{"text":"This is a fairly typical sports bar, but I think they have a few more tv's than thet typical sports bar.

Service was fair for as busy as things were on this night.  I ordered a Turkey Burger with fries and a Caesar Side Salad.  Thankfully, they did bring out the salad before the burger.  Unfortunately, they use a spring mix as the base for their Caesar Salad, so along with romaine you also get leaf lettuce, sliced carrots and some purple onion.  So it's got a little more variety.

The turkey burger was above average and appeared to have been made by hand (as opposed to frozen).  They offer a cajun ranch dressing that went well with the turkey and even better with the fries.  The fries were of the shoestring type and were among the better-tasting sports bar fries I've had in my day.

It's a nice place to go to get your sports fix and it has your standard bar fare.  Service is nothing special, but it has the market on the area surrounding the airport.  I wouldn't go out of my way, but if you're in the area..."}
{"text":"Was in Charlotte for business and ate here with a few co - workers.  Other than the local copper beer I had, I can't really find anything else good to say about this place.   Sad considering I could have gotten the same beer elsewhere.  I have no intention of going back to this place. 

I got wings and in the picture on the menu photos it looked tasty, and the waiter noted they had decent heat in their jot sauce.   Well the pictures were deceiving as I have had chicken nuggets bigger and better than those wings.  Also the sauce was horrible, and I have had hotter banana pepper rings.   Overall just a bad experience."}
{"text":"Sports bar.

A stand alone sports themed place serving up your typical pub fare located close to the airport.

The place reminded me of a TGI Fridays and there was plenty of table seating and a large bar area.  Bartender was slow - considering that the place was quiet on a saturday afternoon, we would have expected a little more attention, but she was nice enough.

Decent sized menu with a pretty extensive selection of bar / pub favorites.  Food was fine: nothing mind blowing or memorable.

Everything came out in a reasonable amount of time and the prices were average for this type of establishment.

Overall a good spot to refuel, grab a cocktail and watch the game - there are tons of TV's scattered around the place.

Give it a shot if in the area.

Parking lot."}
{"text":"I think this is a great place to watch a game, although it gets packed.  On a nice night if you can get outside, they have a pretty nice projection set up out back.  Otherwise, you can probably see 2-3 tv's from any seat in the place.  Foodwise, it's not the best of the bunch, but I usually get the ahi tuna salad.  It's a pretty sizeable portion and they use good healthy greens, and not too much iceberg.
For lunch it's a tad long, but we went during March madness so I guess it was busy.
Mainly we go when we want to catch a game."}
{"text":"I have to say Jocks n Jills used to be a good place.  For a sports bar, they used to have pretty good food but lately they have changed their menu for the worse.

My coworkers and I come here for lunch once in a while.  In the past year or so we've noticed the food and the service go completely down hill.

They used to have good fries, good wraps, good homemade potato chips., and above average food but that has since changed.  

On a recent visit, the fries were worse than some fast food places, the chicken in a chicken enchilada was dry.  There was no salsa or tomatoes included in the poor attempt of additional toppings..,just shredded lettuce and a dollop of sour cream.  It was not very appetizing.  

Service-wise, you better ask for a drink refill and your check when they bring out the food because servers have a tendency to disappear even when the restaurant is not busy.

Since today's visit my coworkers and I have crossed this one off the list of regular lunch spots."}
{"text":"Pretty fun atmosphere. Came here on a Wednesday. This is your average sports bar but what really sets my visits apart is the bartender Nirm. Nirm always makes it his job to learn your name and remembers it every time you come in and is always very courteous and always has a smile on his face. He even checked outside when it was pouring for a guy who was waiting on the Marriott shuttle to come pick him up. Decent drink specials and food as well. I like their wings and salads. Haven't tried much else or sat anywhere else besides the bar mainly because of Nirm."}
{"text":"Typical let you down cheap franchise food with less than stellar service. A bit loud, too. Had their $18 fried shrimp dinner and tasted it ALL night. First and last time for this greasy over rated joint. Skip this place."}
