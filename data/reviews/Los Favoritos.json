{"text":"I wish they didn't have to charge for lemons and jalapeño , and also someone needs to keep the men's restroom clean it's always dirty and full of graffiti. Is this to much to ask for? Anyway the food is good. Also it wouldn't be bad to replace all the light bulbs that don't work.... This restaurant is located in a nice area in Chandler, yet it seems dirty. Maybe is time for a new crew leader? Or maybe the owner is just a stingy asswhole :) good day"}
{"text":"It would be helpful if they had staff who listened...
I clearly said NO guacamole on my order and it was smothered everywhere 
I call them back and she tells me there was no guacamole added to which I asked her to explain the green stufff all over. She says bring them back and they will remake them but won't won't start making them until I give the old ones back. Keep I mind I waited nearly 20 min the first time I was there. 
While waiting for the remake they messed up several other orders. 
She gives me the remade order and the cheese was just thrown on there and not melted at all. I ask her to melt the cheese and she throws the styrofoam container in the microwave. 

Other Los Favs locations I'd recommend all day 
The one on Cooper and Warner never again 

And to think they'll be making $10 an hour soon

{"text":"Love this place, I get the chicken tacos every time.  Rice and beans are great, and the hot sauce is homemade."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this food!! 
It is my mission to try everything on the menu if I can get past the Tacos and Rolled Tacos first!
Staff is friendly and it's is always clean!"}
{"text":"Good fast food Mexican. I really like their rolled tacos, burritos are good too. 
I will pick this place over Filibertos everyday."}
{"text":"I eat here pretty often, it's close to home so it's very convenient for me. There are a lot of these places around and los favs is definitely a favorite!"}
{"text":"Breakfast burritos are awesome!  Choose from bacon, sausage, ham ... or my favorite - no meat.  Really good food.  In a hurry or don't want to wait? No problem - call ahead and your order will be ready when you get there.

We usually place our order and then head next door to Starbucks and get our morning caffeine fix...by the time we get back - order is ready!  

Prices are reasonable.  Service is good.  Food is what you'd expect.  Nachos, burritos, enchilada plates are all very good.  Taquitos can be a little dry, but hey - that's what sour cream is for. Right?
Oh yeah - tons of FREE parking!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times, simply because they are open late and the employees are very nice. The food however, no matter what I order (nachos, enchiladas, burritos), always skates by at an \"acceptable\" level. The guacamole is a runny sauce which has no resemblance taste-wise to an avocado. Many times the food is greasy and unflavorful. I would eat here again if there were no other options but it's nothing great. I'm not really sure how someone could rate them 5 stars, because there are many many great mexican restaurants out here."}
{"text":"I must say, the food is great.  My favorite is the El Diabla shrimp plate. It normally takes awhile to make, but it's worth it. However, on my last visit, I waited a bit longer than normal. I went up to the counter, and after being ignored for awhile, I handed the lady my ticket. She did apologize and informed me that they haven't even started it yet. I wasn't willing to wait this time. I was obviously upset and they didn't offer to refund my money, give a discount, put a rush on it, or anything. She just informed me that if I still wanted it, I would have to wait awhile. WTF?!!? They replaced my El Diabla, the entire reason I went there, with a couple other burritos. Again, no offer to make it right. In total, I ended up waiting about 45 min-1hr, and still didn't get what I wanted. I should have just asked for my money back. Customer Service is everything. I'm really disappointed. Even though I like the food, I don't believe I'll ever return."}
{"text":"Really good food and prices. They're also open u til 2am which is a big plus for late night munchies. One of the better places in chandler."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for here, cheap food. If your broke and want flavorful food then this is your place! I get breakfast burritos all the time from this place and I do have to complain about the bacon, it's so tough and chewy! Bacon is definitely one of my top 5 favorite things to eat and this is one of the few places I don't eat it."}
{"text":"i have been coming to this place since high school. Everything I have had tastes really good. My favorites are the Chorizo breakfast burrito and any of the quesadillas. Most of the locations throughout the valley are good as well. I usually avoid the one in Tempe though."}
{"text":"You can tell the tortillas are made from scratch which really adds to the taste. The burrito are heavy size and are really good but they need to work on their salsa at times they can be to watery and lack taste."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just need some favs! Not as greasy and other taco places, and pretty consistent. Nice to have late hours, bc we usually crave it late at night."}
{"text":"The Customer service sucks the stupid cashier she was rude I made a order and she made a mistake she took to long and then she call me and told me what I order and then she told me what I order it was really expensive really"}
{"text":"Truly a staple of south Chandler. One of those places where it's almost impossible to go in there and not see someone that you know"}
{"text":"Been coming to this location for 2 years now and they never fail. The Chorizo breakfast burrito is fantastic along with the tacos. Actually haven't tried anything yet that I didn't like. Only drawback is they need some background music, tv or something. Eerily quiet when dining in."}
{"text":"This went from a 2 star to a 3 star only because other yelpers talked about the chorizo. 

On the downside, although the food was good this time (chorizo with double rice and beans), the service was just ok and the bathrooms were kinda dirty. It was right before closing so they probably hadnt cleaned them in a few hours. 

Probably not going to go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I went to this place knowing that it was fast food mexican.  The food was just ok and I've tried it a few times. The people that work there are never nice and have never said Hi or thank you. I'm obviously not going there for the atmosphere but c'mon you could have some manners. 
The last time I ate here the girl started mopping under my table that I was eating at and all of the others beside me. The smell of the floor cleaner was so overwhelming it got me sick. I did tell her not to mop near me but should I have to? I won't be eating here again. Even if the food was good it's not worth the attitude this place gives."}
{"text":"Best tacos around, fresh and great sauce.   The only reason it's not 5 star is the interior.  Just basic tables, chairs, plastic and foam.  Still I continue to drop in at lunch for chicken tacos, quick and easy."}
{"text":"Okay food in a fast food ambiance.  I had the chicken chimichanga combination plate.  The tortilla was very crispy and the filling included some cheese, onions, and chilies.  The chimi was topped with generous helpings of guacamole and sour cream.  The rice was dry, but the refried beans were okay.  The Dr. Pepper in the soda fountain was a teensy bit watered down. 

My husband was not impressed with his carnitas burrito.  He got a nasty surprise when he cut it open.  It was stuffed with pico de gallo and guacamole, in addition to the dry carnitas.  He hates guacamole."}
{"text":"I Love this place! If im craving fast Mexican food this is where I go! Great prices and awesome food! The cashier is awesome too- wish I knew here name to give her props.. I always go in around noon on week days! :)"}
{"text":"I usually love los favs but tonight our service was so bad. First i was charged twice for a combo i wanted but i only wanted one order. Our total came out to $35 and never has our order been this high before no matter how much food my boyfriend and i order so we checked the receipt and saw that the cashier charged us twice so my boyfriend went to get the refund. The lady at the cashier shouted something in Spanish to the cooks and I'm assuming to let them know to cancel the extra combo. Then we waited and literally everyone that came in after us was served their food even a family of like 8 ppl! And we got our food last it was so annoying and literally felt like they did it on purpose because we asked for a refund for the extra food we didn't want."}
{"text":"The young people in my life love this place. What is wrong with the youth these days? Their food tastes okay for fast Mexican fare. However every time, without fail, that I have eaten here, I have wound up spending extended time in the bathroom several hours later. Because of that I do not eat there."}
{"text":"Highly Disappointing. The meat served here is made on a griddle. Authentic Carne Asada is made on a GRILL!! Thats what Asada means in spanish, made on a GRILL! This saddens me to the point I will never return.  

What I am saying my fellow Yelpers, when you order Carne Asada thats what you expect. In all honesty, the carne asada served here is cheap imitation."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service. Waited 30 minutes for two breakfast burritos. Asked them why it was taking so long, lady went in the back to see and they lost my ticket. Had to wait another 10 minutes for them to make it. No apology no refund. Burrito did taste great. Multiple people in the store were complaining about the wait as well. The place is also disgusting inside, saw a fly crawling around in the coffee pot."}
{"text":"The best place to go for breakfast burritos, specifically the chorizo. I have never been let down by the quality in taste here. The chorizo is always delicious and has a good amount of spice. Just dont plan for a quick lunch break here, because it's usually quite busy from 11am - 2pm"}
{"text":"Not bad los favoritos. Not bad...
The salsa could use some work. I'm not even sure what I would suggest needs to be changed about it, I just know that it doesn't meet my expectations. 
If I were rating this place solely on their chile relleno. (which is a deal breaker for me when it comes to mexican food) I would give it 1 star. Again something with the sauce and it had a LOT of seeds. (yes I am well aware that chiles have seeds, but I don't want them in every bite!)
BUT. I did give this place 3 stars because I really enjoy their bacon breakfast burrito, which includes potatoes as well as their beef taquitos."}
{"text":"Killer shrimp burritos with lots of shrimp and lots of spice! Breakfast burritos are soooo good. All burritos are huge and worth every inexpensive penny. Hifhly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Growing up on the North Side, where Mexican food is everywhere.  I am a bit of a snob when it comes to this. 

My boyfriend and I moved to Chandler from Tempe and said oh let's get tacos! 
We go to Los Favoritos and the cashier girl, was RUDE.  The food was medicore, the decor the same. 
But the biggest issue was the beans. Seriously, rice and beans are a STAPLE.  
The rice was decent, the beans just tasted like chicken broth. I thought beans had lard. But shit this gringa found better elsewhere.
Pro's
Cheap
Cons
decor
food
service."}
{"text":"I typically go here for a breakfast burrito or chicken rolled tacos (taquitos). Based on the location of this particular Los, they are often busy and the tables aren't always clean. Though I don't sit and eat often, when I do, I'd prefer a clean table (wiped with a cleansing agent and not a rag from the sink in the back)."}
{"text":"Was not terrible, but was not good. Mediocre but cheap. Might try it out again."}
{"text":"Well, I've officially eaten at this location for the last time. Over the last few years, it's gone from good food with nice/funny people working there to decent food with a miserable woman who scowls at you as she takes your order. We kept coming despite her rudeness because we liked the food/ familiarity.. Until last night. Ordered a quesadilla and I see that it has clearly been reheated (probably from a to-go order that no one claimed) . My friend's is piping hot and mine is warm but the cheese is dk orange/oily - like how melted cheese gets when it cools down. I don't know what's more insulting: getting served old food or them thinking I was going to be too dumb to notice. Consider hiring someone in the back who isn't too lazy to melt cheese into a tortilla if you want to retain customers."}
{"text":"It's the second time we've visited this little cantina for our Mexican food fix. I got the carne asada quesadilla and it was great! There is always something for everyone, even if you aren't a huge fan of this type of food. The place is clean and the staff is friendly; it feels great contributing to someone's \"American dream\" of being a successful business owner. If your  close to Gilbert and Chandler Heights crossroads, it's definitely worth your time to stop in for a bite to eat!"}
{"text":"Waited 25 min for a burrito and two tacos. There was only 2 people ahead of us in line with bigger orders. Every person that came in after us got their order before us. They didn't even apologize for the long wait. Another guy was also complaining that he had been waiting for an hour. Poor customer service"}
{"text":"LOVE the breakfast burritos here. My husband and I go a couple of times a week when were feeling lazy or are busy on weekends. Husband is born and raised in Mexico and he has several favorites (Machaca burrito, chorizo burrito, chili rojo, and menudo on weekends). Service has gone downhill during days and weekends- long wait times, other people getting served who came after us, mess ups on the orders, etc- but we love the woman who works on weeknights!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure they have the best tortillas in town. And for all you vegans out there, they don't use lard in their refried beans, they use canola oil."}
{"text":"Actually stumbled on this place when looking for a cheap, quick mexican joint.  We first went to filiberto's but walked out since the whole place reeked of dirty water.  

Their shredded chicken is very good here.  Seasoned right and cooked right.  My girlfriends favorite enchilada / taco place in the east valley thus far.

Their carne asada burrito will probably end out being the best burrito in the east valley for me.  It's very good quality meat, and the burrito is actually a full size burrito.  The meat isn't the typical chewy type that you usually encounter at your fast food mexican joints.

They have a big menu and serve all different types of meats... carnitas, chicken, lengua, carne asada.  Also have quite a few shrimp plates including shrimp cocktail so I'll definitely be trying that.

The prices are your standard fast food mexican prices, which makes this place even better.  If you roll in here drunk and have their carne asada burrito, it's probably nirvana..... be prepared."}
{"text":"This is a good place to get a chorizo breakfast burrito.  The beans are pretty good.  The tortillas are very good.  The enchiladas are just okay.  Its sure hopping on Sunday mornings!  I'll try the carne asada next time after seeing all the good reviews on here."}
{"text":"The tortilla is perfect, the potato is cooked correctly and they use the right cheese.  Amazing breakfast burritos.  Then top it off with the off the hook green sauce and you have yourself an addiction.  Love this place ."}
{"text":"Hands Down Los Favoritos Taco Shop! The Price & Portions Is Worth Goin' To This Location! I Don't Get The Negative Reviews...(probably wanna be food critics, but who knows)

Haven't Done Me Wrong & I've Been Goin There For 2yrs+"}
{"text":"Love this place. Some of the best authentic Mexican food in the valley I highly recommend it"}
{"text":"I would give this place 4 stars for the fact that my burrito seems to increase by $1.25 when adding potatoes to it...ridiculous. However, they have THE best chile relleño burrito you'll ever consume...I'm pretty sure my co-workers would concur. Also, there's a guy that works the cash register that provides THE BEST customer experience, period. I can't believe this guy is working at Los Favs. If you own a local restaurant and happen to read this, you should seriously consider offering this man a job! I literally looked him in the eye as I was leaving and let him know that he has a great attitude. Amazing burritos and superior customer service...kinda weird saying that about a fast food burrito shop :P keep up the stellar work guys, and gals!"}
{"text":"Total bummer - this is the worst Los Favs location I have been to. I ordered 2 burritos to go this morning and when I got home noticed they made a mistake with my order. I called them up and told them of their error and was told to come back to the store with the burrito to remedy the situation. When I arrived I was told that they couldn't fix my order without both burritos present because I couldn't prove the mistake. After a bit of back and forth arguing they finally agreed to fix the order, only to come back to me 5 minutes later to say that they're out of ingredients (Adobada). I asked to speak to a manager and was told they don't have one. I asked for the owners info and was again stonewalled. Terrible service and experience. They've lost my business.

Happy Father's Day!"}
{"text":"Think Filibertos with about half the sodium content, I had the much raved about carne asada california burrito which was a combo of carne asada, cheese and french fries....pretty damn good. 
My wife had a chicken chimichanga combo and it was so good it inspired me to try a simple chicken taco. Not very good...glad I got that out of the way so my next visit doesn't change what I think of the place. Still looking for that magical taco shop that reminds me of must stop even though traffic is a bitch and $7 parking Olvera St in downtown LA. But this is good enough for dinner if it happens to be on the way home.

Cant wait to try the breakfast burritos."}
{"text":"Ok food. Crappy service and sub par bathroom. With all the fast food Mexican choices out there, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Ok, it isn't a BAD 3 star, is just that my favorite thing there is their breakfast burrito made w/ chorizo.  The other stuff it is your usual taste from any of those chains...such as Filibertos(ugh) but this place is much much better, not bad pricing either.  Pretty clean place as well."}
{"text":"Typically I love the place. However, last Sunday I placed a phone order. Placed an order for one steak and egg with extra egg and add guacamole, & 3 bacon,cheese & potatoes burro with egg... After I repeated order at least 3 times over the phone ENGLISH & SPANISH! she still manages to mess it up and when i get there after seeing my order i was upset and the lady called me a lair lol the audacity of her. PLEASE GET SOMEONE THAT UNDERSTANDS BOTH LANGUAGES!"}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly. Food gets done fast and everything I've had is amazing. The bacon breakfast burrito is so good, so Is the three rolled taco meal, and the bean and cheese burrito . I could eat here everyday .. Red sauce is AMAZING."}
{"text":"My brother has been going to this place for about the last 6 months. Always gets a bacon breakfast burrito. Huge and a good value for what you get. I went in tonight to try them for myself. Pretty much comparable to Filliberto's in every way. similar menu and similar style and sitting area. I ordered the bacon breakfast burrito. 4.59 for a huge burrito stuffed full of bacon, egg, cheese and potatoes. Very tasty and quite filling. I would definitely recommend them for the breakfast burritos!"}
{"text":"Um... Why haven't I ever been here before? 

Really great food, sit down restaurant quality good. Taco Smell's got nothin on these guys. 

The shredded beef tacos kill.

{"text":"Great food and prices. This place is always clean,courteous, and fast. You order at the counter and they call your number.  So not a fancy place but with kids it's great. I've been going here for years and it  is always delicious.  My favorites are the carne asada tacos and cheese quesadilla.  My kids love the bean burritos. Has quite a few tables and booths  for seating and high chairs if you need one. Definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"I found the food very flavourful.
Very reasonable price for good food
Only complaint is no air conditioning which is deadly fir nonresident"}
{"text":"I usually eat here and it's good but today I found a hair in my food. I was upset and asked the cashier to refund my money and she asked if she can give me another burrito instead. I of course said no because it'll just have another hair in it. She then gave me money back but didn't even give me the full amount. She also never apologized for their terrible customer service. I'll never come back here again, it's dirty and all of the tables were a mess."}
{"text":"I had a fish taco a few days ago. I'm not into fried food but it was really good! So tonight I just had the shrimp (not fried) I was expecting shrimp in a can type baby shrimp but they weren't. They were butterflied and a decent size.. Add fresh cilantro and special sauce.. I'm hooked."}
{"text":"I'm confused as to how this place is getting great written reviews but only four stars. What do yall want, little dancing chilis with your meal?
This is some of the best Mexican food in a rather wide radius. It's not typical when compared with a lot of the fake bs Mexican restaurants we have. The only way it can be construed as typical is that it's real. If you want something beyond that (which would completely ruin it) then this isn't your place. If you want the good stuff at good prices, don't miss this place."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever  the  cashier was very rude she over charged me and got my order wrong my food was cold and when I told her she respond it wasn't her job to make the burritos. I will not ever go back to this place the burritos are not even good."}
{"text":"Just moved to East Mesa from Gilbert and we are very excited to have a Los Favoritos nearby!"}
{"text":"- the food is O.K., seems like americanized version of mexican food
- the waitstaff is hurried.  they smile politely, although it's not genuine
- the cost is GIANT for what you'll receive, so be prepared to pay more for less
- the atmosphere is bland, and worthless

I will be recommending friends/family that they avoid this place.  This could all be solved with prices 40-50% lower, although I doubt they will comply.

Bottom line:  don't bother"}
{"text":"I mother effin love this place.  I have been eating there since they opened back in 2000 or 2001.  

The breakfast burritos are the bomb, the california carne asada is unbelievable and the rolled tacos are always good.

The staff is always nice.  I love seeing this place packed, they deserve it."}
{"text":"Truth be told, I've been eating here for close to a decade. The food is usually pretty good and the register staff is always friendly. It kills me to rate this place two stars, but things have really slipped over the past couple of years. I don't mind onions, but one of the cooks has been packing raw white onions in the California burritos. The red salsa used to taste wonderful, but they changed up the recipe somehow...it now tastes like a hot pepper extract of some kind has been added to tomato paste. It's spicy red water now. A couple of months ago, I almost swallowed a thin spiral metal shaving in the salsa. As friendly as the register staff is, they WILL mess up your order without any remorse whatsoever. Tonight I made a huge mistake and phoned in my order...I know better, because this place gets busy and they usually don't seem to have enough staff to take phone orders. One of my standing rules: I never return food when it's wrong, but I did provide a brief opportunity for them to fix it. Finally, I just ordered on top of the error and paid for all of it. I haven't written this place off entirely, but I'm pretty close."}
{"text":"Look, this place would get 5 stars but I am sure I haven't tried all the best burritos out there. But the convenience of the location and the fact that I truly believe Carne Asada is a health food I recommend going to one near you!! Whether your a bean and cheese or a fat carne burrito kinda person, taco or taquito kind, maybe you need veggies, I still think their Carne Asada is just what the doctor ordered, throw their fresh salsa on any of it and call it a salad. 
 Remember Meat is what makes us human!!! And they don't  scrimp. In the future I am sure you will see a guy like me out in front of resturants selling FAT in little viles to people who realize, \"remove the fat..remove the flavor\".
  If you think you may be Burrito intolerant, it's just a myth, not a condition. However, I do sometimes notice others seem to be intolerant of my burrito consumption.. But my dogs still love me.
  One more note. Their burritos aren't so loaded with juice that the tortilla falls apart and drips all over. So I think taking a formal date would be ok.."}
{"text":"We moved here from Scottsdale.  LOS FAVS was our FAVORITE!  We found this 1 down the road.  We tried 4 times and still not good.  1 time paid for guacamole didnt get it.  Food was burnt i didnt get dinner that night.  Scottsdale Los Favs Bean Burrito is WONDERFUL!!

Tacos are way over cooked...they burn food meat tasted rotton.  Let down 4 times what a shame.  Looking for gooood Mexican food."}
{"text":"I eat here at least 3 or 4 times a month. It would be easy for me to knock them due to the fact that they messed up my order tonight. I ordered a carne asada burro with sour cream. They forgot the sour cream. With that said, I love the food here. I eat a ton of Mexican and I won't say this is super authentic but I will say it has good flavor. I have never been disappointed in the food itself. I have ordered probably everything on their menu including the vegetarian burro. They get the order out quickly and usually everyone is fairly friendly. So I have to get them 5 stars."}
{"text":"Love the burritos here. They are served tasting so fresh and the green salsa is amazing. If I could bathe in only one green sauce it would be los favoritos. It's like 15x better than taco bells Verde sauce and let me tell you I love that stuff. Sometimes I think about asking to buy just a cup of it to drink and skipping the burrito. Eating to go is always distressing bc I can't get enough sauce. I prefer los favoritos locations where the sauce is already available to grab and you don't have to ask. It makes the amount of sauce I use feel less shameful. Taking one Star away for that. Other locations 5 star. Plan to move closer to another location soon to correct this travesty."}
{"text":"Ewwww! Why isn't there a zero star! First of all it's very run down and when my friend and I tried to sit down, none of the tables were clean enough to eat on and when we sat down at a table, this worker came over and stared wiping down the table like we weren't even there! Like what a creep! 

Then I ordered fries and my friend ordered a burrito. It took about twenty minutes to finally bring out the food. In the fries, they were pretty good besides all the HAIR! That's just gross and disgusting! I threw away all the fries and then the workers have me dirty looks like \"did you really just throw away those perfectly good fries?\" Umm no I threw away disgusting, hairy fries.

Inside the burrito, my friend almost choked on a cheese wrapper! He coughed and then spit it out and held up a cheese wrapper! When we tried to get our money back, the worker refused to give money back to \"un-responsible little kids\". My friend and I got ticked off and had to leave without our eight dollars.

Anyway, not worth it for the \"so-called cheap Mexican food\". I would rather go spend my money on expensive Mexican food or MCDONALDS! So not worth it :l"}
{"text":"Always great service, food is cooked just right. Friendly staff, bilingual . carne asada fries are amazing. The chorizo breakfast burrito is great too."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious!! Especially the torta de carne asada. Yum! Their breakfast burritos are so good. Perfect if youre on your way to work. My boyfriend was the one that showed me this place and I loved it. Im glad he showed me, now I cant get enough lol"}
{"text":"I have not had a bad experience with this place until today. The foods is delicious and the service is good too, but unfortunately today, when I was eating a bean and cheese burrito, I bit into some pieces of shaved metal, and sadly I found this on my last bite of my food  and am sure there is more metal that's in my belly now that I swallowed. So I suggest you check your food before eating it so this doesn't happen to anyone else,  especially to a child."}
{"text":"Great food. Sunday's are very busy here. The shrimp cocktail is very good. A little too sweet for my taste but it is good overall."}
{"text":"I went to this place on a Sunday morning and it was a complete mess. People were waiting 30 minutes for a burrito. One guy walked out because he did not get his order. I waited 30 minutes and when I still did not have my order, I asked the girl at the counter. In an rude and angry voice, she said that it had gone out \"a long time ago,\" which is funny because I was sitting right by the counter. So this place is slow and they lie to you."}
{"text":"The logo and decor of this place should be changed immediately! The decor of this restaurant promotes the stereotype of the \"sleeping Mexican\"- lazy, dirty, huddled under a saguaro.  Interestingly everyone working there were Mexican and about 90% of the clientele in the lobby that day was of Latino background. To have paintings of the \"sleeping Mexican\" on the window decor and on a large mural in their main dining lobby is offensive, especially in Phoenix with all of the attacks on people of color and anti immigrant laws coming out of the state legislator. Truly bad form. Shame I'm sure the food is great ..."}
{"text":"I love this place, amazing food. This is the one I would recommend to my friends for delicious food. The price is right and did I mention it is good!!! Nice place to go and enjoy good eats and a chill atmosphere."}
{"text":"I don't know why but we love this place.
Sunday morning we always come and get breakfast burritos. Love no potatoes egg and cheese. Their red sauce is the best!

Great that it is next to starbucks to get coffee as well. Perfect neighborhood spot!"}
{"text":"This was the fourth place in my recent taco tour of Chandler, and I thought this place was authentic but not!!! Again, I went with the traditional Carne Asada and marinated portk. This place is comparable to filbertos and that is not a compliment. The marinated pork was actually pork with some chorizo seasoning on it, terrible. The Carne Asada was typical stale and bland. Is there something with seasoning here that people tend to try and  let the salsa do all the covering up. A good taco needs no salsa, just a little lime, the salsa should add just a little kick but not be the whole taste of the taco. Well, I should not expect too much from a chain, no matter if it is a hispanic chain or an anglo chain like taco bell. I also have to wonder who are reviewing these places also."}
{"text":"Best bfast around.  This location was just remodeled and it looks great.  Chorizo bfast burro is awesome as well as their burritos and super nachos."}
{"text":"There food is disgusting... Will never eat there again. There is nothing fresh about there food. Bad experience with there tacos, shrimp cocktail and burritos. I gave it three tries and each time was a disappointment."}
{"text":"Yum yum! Love the carna asada burrito & tacos! Oh & the carna asada fries too! Customer service is good & there is a nice amount of seating. I usually just call in for a pick up if it is busy which I love (: All of my friends and family I have recommended to this place have never complained. Bomb.com"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. Not too bad. I like it better than some other...slightly sketchier...places. Their chili rellano burrito is definitely better than the competition, and the carne quesadilla supreme is really good. 

Just don't order the carne quesadilla without making it supreme. It's rather bland!

Service is quick and friendly, and it's a great place to go ruin your workout. :)"}
{"text":"It is ok.  I prefer fresh, flavorful dishes.  This is just like most mexican fast food.  I would NOT go out of my way to eat here.  Food is served on Styrofoam plates and no real flavor.  $20 for two dishes, chips and guacamole seems overpriced.  Guacamole was processed.. again mexican food can be so good if made from real ingredients.  Not beef and cheese slop."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since it was called Papa Chuys (it was changed because Chuys sued them for the name).  The food has always been consistently good. It is hard finding a breakfast burrito any better. The carne asada is just as good and the tortillas are soft. The place is always busy. That has to say something!"}
{"text":"First time using this location, quick service. Only they screwed up my order. I order nachos with jalapeños, get back to work, no cheese and no jalapeños , chips are soggy. I will not be going back, I will make sure I don't recommend this place to anyone! I'd give a zero star if that was possible!"}
{"text":"Food was bland the service is horrible! I got the shrimp burrito, the rice was tasteless and the shrimp was not fresh. Girls working at the counter were rude and didn't even call out my number when my order was ready so it sat there awhile before I went up and asked. Definitely not going back."}
{"text":"Nothing special nor is the decor. Most of the burritos/plates are overpriced and have a bland taste to it. Not only is the staff unfriendly, the seating booths are very close together if you are sitting across the table from someone. Uncomfortable. Do not get the guacamole here, you will laugh as it looks like watery Slim. I am not kidding."}
{"text":"The Mexican food there is ok. Some is kind of pricey for what it is. If you go I would suggest to avoid going during lunch time (noon) because they seem to get overwhelmed with a ton of students from the local high school. 
Also I would avoid going the in the mornings, there is this girl always there in the morning and she is just so rude, like she doesn't want to be there or something. Every time I go I get the same experience from her and see her as she tends to others before me... She's just rude and abrasive for some reason like she is doing you a favor. 
The burritos are ok and reasonable price. My biggest issue is the attitude specially for someone like me who buys several times a week sometimes a day because is the easiest thing for me on my way to work. Anyway, don't go in the morning specially if is your first time. You'll get horrible attitude"}
{"text":"This place is divey. The tables always seem to need a wipe down and the booths are dated. The food though has always been good to me. I've had the rolled tacos, the carne asada fries, machaca torta, and boyfriend usually gets a chimichanga or relleno, but had also gotten the adobada in some form. Get a large jamaica or horchata. Cheers."}
{"text":"I ordered food this morning and your employees messed my whole order up. I'm very upset with what I got.  Customer service was horrible. You're supposed to make your customers happy when you mess an order up and whoever answered the phone when I called to complain did not do well with helping me out. Your tacos were all soggy and I specifically said only the meat and they put everything else on it. Also instead of getting a green chill burrito we got a like a carne burrito with rice. Employees should look at the food before serving it to make sure the order was correct."}
{"text":"Good food. Really long wait to get the food after you place your order and my nachos were cold."}
{"text":"I've been here probably a hundred times. I've never been disappointed. It's usually a mandatory Sunday morning stop for me. When I don't feel like a breakfast burrito I go for the carne asada fries. Add some red hot sauce to them and you'll be full for the rest of the day."}
{"text":"Awesome best Carne Asada burrito."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly counter staff.  This is perfect for an early run into work and craving Mexican food.  I got the chorizo burrito and it was perfect."}
{"text":"Yummy! Love the breakfast burrito. Always the was I ask for it too. I call ahead and it's ready from my 6 min drive from my home. Very pleased!"}
{"text":"Consistently dissatisfied with this location. The one is Scottsdale is better in all aspects, food and customer service."}
{"text":"Love them, great little hole in the wall ! Great tacos, nachos and burritos and it doesn't put a hole in your wallet. We prefer the one on Chandler Blvd. and Dobson in Chandler."}
{"text":"When I pay $10 for cheese enchiladas and a soft drink I expect some pretty amazing enchiladas. These were anything but. Cold in the middle so the cheese had never been melted.  The staff was robotic and not even sure they were going through the motions.  I won't be back"}
{"text":"I love Los Favoritos!  Mi favorito is the chorizo breakfast burrito (most popular item there?).  Interestingly enough, I think it's bigger if you order it for dinner than for breakfast, but for either it's plenty big!  Muy rico with salsa verde.  I'm embarrassed to say that I've only had a few of other things on the menu (quesadilla and other burritos), but they've all been delish!  For some reason, though, I just get my mouth set on chorizo burrito.  It's seductive.
The folks there are very nice and sincere, and they know English well enough, although I think some are working on it.  
Tip:  You can order ahead!  Especially helpful if you're going during the lunch rush, when it seems like every kid from Seton H.S. is there.  it's pretty nice to breeze in and pay and grab your stuff when there's a gaggle of folks still waiting for their order to be called.    
Tip 2:  If you don't order ahead, you can place your order there and then go across the courtyard to Starbucks to grab a coffee (that probably costs more than what you got at Los Fav's) while you wait for your food, if you're so inclined.  This is a bad habit you might not want to get into.  Believe me!"}
{"text":"I went here today and I asked for the #21. 2 carne Assad tacos with been and rice, I asked for only cilantro and onion instead of the regular pico mix. I was charged and extra $1.30 for cilantro and another $1.30 for onions. That's an extra $2.60 for my meal for cilantro and onion on 2 tacos. (Most taco shops keep those on a salsa bar for free). The cashier said its because they have to cut it up separately. Needless to say I will not be back....EVER."}
{"text":"Love hate with this place! Fantastic breakfast burrito! The service is not so great.
It's busy on weekends so be prepared. It's right next to a Starbucks so a great place to get your coffee and a killer burrito! 
I recommend the bacon egg and cheese."}
{"text":"Do not go here. If you do, you will ruin my secret haunt. The family and I sneak out here many weekends. Great food, reasonable prices. You can just about show up in your pajamas if you like."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch while in Chandler a week.  I got the Carne Asada burrito, and I'm definitely a fan.  It sat...a little heavy...in my stomach that afternoon, and I'm STILL a fan.  Fresh tortilla, great flavors, fast service."}
{"text":"The food was decent-nothing really spectacular here.The ground beef taco was a lot better than the ones I have been getting at Filibertos.  I do wish they had a salsa bar.  

When I went the other day, the place was filled with junior high school students and they all were given plastic bottles of salsa when they received their food but I was not given a bottle.  Glad to know I rate lower than some 14 year old kid.

I might stop in again if I am in the neighborhood but I'm certainly not going to go out of my way to come back here."}
{"text":"Went here with my fiancé after several people telling us it was delicious! First off we both get off very late at night and LOVE how late it stays open so that was a plus right there! Second off we loved that they have everything prices and most everything came with a side of rice and beans! It did take about 12/15 minutes to get our food which we were totally fine with! The green sauce was a little bit too hot for my liking but I still loved it and ate it! Our food was super good and can't wait to go back! Definitely beats Filibertos, but not s sit down restaurant I think it's Togo!"}
{"text":"Great quick Mexican food and fast. If I lived in the area, would be here often!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here on a friends recommendation. AWESOME food!!! Fast service and very professional. We now go here at least 3 times a month."}
{"text":"I love their Carne Asada Chips! It comes with steak, pico de gallo, shredded cheese, and Guacamole. Awesome!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place a 0 I would... We stopped in today and I paid $4.50 for a large guac to go. Imagine my surprise when I opened it in front of my guests and it was so watered down it was soup. I had to throw it away and apologize to my friends. I will NEVER spend another penny at this place. You have been warned!"}
{"text":"Checked this place out with the family a few weeks ago and ended up ordering office catering from them for an event. I love that they carry rolled taquitos for a good price, as well as other authentic Mexican dishes such as shrimp cocktail (no, don't think shrimp ring with dip, think shrimp swimming in lemony tomato sauce), adobada and other items. The value is good and it is very clean.
The staff was super helpful and happy to meet our needs. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place gets five stars for the green salsa alone. It's addictive, and they sell it BY THE CUP FULL. What they really ought to do is bottle it and put it in the store. It's spicy enough, but not overwhelmingly so. 

The breakfast burrito is the only thing I've had, and we get it every Sunday. The ham is the best, but so is the chorizo and bacon. You can't go wrong, especially with a side of pinto beans. Take it to go, eat in on the patio.. this place can't be beat. 

The price is right, and the green sauce is addictive."}
{"text":"I love this place. I always get the Carne Asada California burrito. It is so good, it has so many different flavors wrapped into a burrito. Until I started my semi-health kick (I know how can I be on a health kick and eat fast-food Mexican food?) I used to also get their breakfast burritos. Their Damn good too! In the mornings, on a Sunday, this place just gets tons of over the phone orders, so expect a longer wait. Years ago my friend recommended this place, only it was on Chandler and Dobson. 

I like to think of \"Los Favs\" as a less greasy and cheaper version of Filibertos (though that may not be true)."}
{"text":"Chile Verde meat is too dry.  Cooking too long or has been reheated too many times or a couple of days old.  Did not enjoy at all."}
{"text":"Very good food I really like the machaca breakfast burrito,the chicken tacos and shredded beef quesadilla ."}
{"text":"Forget Filiberto's. Forget Riva's. Forget Super Burrito and the countless other fast food Mexican places in the valley. So what if their fluorescent overhead lighting and cheap plastic booths give you high school cafeteria flashbacks? If you want atmosphere and more of that family feel, head to Abuelo's or Serrano's nearby. 

If you're looking for a perfect breakfast burrito for under $4, Los Favs is the only place that delivers. The tortillas are always fresh, hot, slightly chewy, and ridiculously good. Combine that with fluffy eggs, soft potatoes, spicy chorizo (or ham, bacon, sausage, machaca or beans), and a handful of melted mexican blend; what do you get? A forearm-sized, artery-clogging gift from the gods that's just as good after a night of drinking as it is stone cold sober. Top if off with their tangy green sauce, and you'll be as addicted as I am. My only complaint is that they're not open 24/7 so that I can get my burro fix any time of the day! 

Here's a tip: call in your order early on a Saturday or Sunday morning for a cheap, delicious breakfast that'll fuel you up for the long day of beer and football ahead. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Solid food and very good breakfast burritos.  The sausage and egg with Green sauce does it for me every Sunday.  Quality is always the same and the place seems clean and is very well run.  Everything is made to order and I have never had bad food there.

This place is best for take out or a quick meal but do not expect any atmosphere.  It is more cafeteria style feel for a quick in and out.  

The drinks/juice they have there is not to my liking.  They are overly sweet for my taste and even my kids.  That is about the only thing I would stay away from.

Go for the food and you will be happy!"}
{"text":"I really only go to Los Favs for one of two things:

Bacon Breakfast Burritos.
Chili Verde Burritos.

Both are better than the same product that is offered by other Mexican places in the immediate area.  

I like their red and green sauces.  The chips that they serve are perfect for my taste.

Their hours are very convenient for most people, since they open early and close late.

The staff there has always been friendly towards me.  As long as they do their job, that's all I ask for."}
{"text":"Been going to this location for over 5 years now and I am always satisfied with every visit. I order the carne asada California burrito, it's my favorite."}
{"text":"Love the green sauce! Food is great, portions are perfect size! The carne Asada nachos are great!"}
{"text":"Family, friends and I have been going to Los favs for many years.  Over time the best breakfast burrito became the worst!  It becomes smaller and more expensive every time I return!  

The girl behind the counter is rude and unwelcoming which never turned me off before, as the food was good for the price.  Now I'll steer clear of this place unless the management changes things back to the way they used to be.  

Bring back the old Los favs!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a few years now and it is a great place to grab some quality Mexican food, and for the price, you can't beat it! I recommend the rolled tacos w/ guacamole or any of the breakfast burritos."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Arizona I've been a faithful eater there since I was 17 I'm 24 now they have great burritos great combo platters they have pretty much everything you want there cali burrito tho is what I always get there chorizo is good to there sauce is hot both red and green for me that's a plus anyhow every location is good if you see one try it."}
{"text":"I love their breakfast burritos and the shredded beef tacos.  Always delicious and fresh tasting.  The prices are very reasonable.  I live out of state and I always stop in here when I am visiting.  I do recommend calling in your order because they are very popular and you may have a long wait to get your food...it's worth the wait though!   
Warning on the shredded beef tacos:  
They are a bit greasy.  That can be a plus or minus depending on your personal taste.  I think they are PERFECT!  If you are one of the low-fat, heath food only crowd, you probably should not be eating here anyway."}
{"text":"This could just probably be the worst Torta I've had in my entire Mexican life. And trust me when I say that I've had a lot of Tortas here in the USA and over the Border. 
It was soggy, the bun was flavorless, uncooked carne asada,very little pico and lettuce and with no mayo or condiments. Plus the pineapple water had a funny taste, like they used tap water. The only reason I give it two stars is for the Red Salsa, it was the only good thing I've found here. 
Over all a very bad first and ONLY experience at this very mostly \"gringo\" popular place."}
{"text":"Solid.  It all comes down to the word \"solid\".  

The carne asada burrito, standard amongst *berto's purists (*insert your own prefix here...Fili, Rigo, Ernie &...whatev)?  Solid.

The rice and beans, often times overlooked drivel at such an establishment?  Solid.

The carne asada fries, a delicacy not even on the menu (a pile of fries topped with a mound of carne asada, guacamole, sour cream, cheese and pico de gallo...I think I just jizzed in my pants)?  Surprisingly solid.  Not quite Riva's in Tempe-solid, but solid none the less.

The business end of the food, about a day later, normally watery and of the Tijuana-Two Step variety?  Not this time pal.  SOLID. (Ok, that was gross.  I apologize in advance for both making a poop joke and actually waiting this long to deliver the SOLID punchline)

Anyone complaining about bathrooms, garbage cans or service obviously has no idea what  they're doing in a dive burrito joint on Chandler Blvd.  You go, you order, you get your burrito and get the hell out.  If you have to eat there, your luck really sucks because this is the kind of food that is best when ordered to-go.  

Do you think the lady behind the counter is there to smile at you?  Will it improve your food?  Would you rather her be all business, take your order, get it done fast and quick and hot out the door, or would you rather have her chit-chat with everyone in line at lunch time in a business area when you've only got 20 minutes left on lunch and Johnny Junkforbrains is up front asking her about her fine horchata-mixing skills?  Yeah.  Me either.

So basically, go get a solid burrito and shut up."}
{"text":"Hard working employees, fast service, great food

Wish it smelled more like the great food inside the store rather than just cleaning chemicals"}
{"text":"I like coming here in the morning and having a breakfast burrito and then going outside and sitting in the morning sun.

It is nice too, if you happen to prefer a coffee or tea instead of a juice with your breakfast burrito then you can go next door to Starbucks and get that.

Is this place super styling? No. But I like it. Simple. Order food. Get it. Eat it. And then you are off to your next Yelping location.

Maybe next time I should try one of their non-breakfast burritos!"}
{"text":"Always good good here.  Just wish the front counter lady was friendlier.  Seemed to be bothered that we were ordering food.  Oh well."}
{"text":"This location is absolutely horrible. They have a simple minded mentality when it comes to treating customers. Customer service is lacking and they don't have a manager onsite who can assist paying patrons. We will drive the extra miles to be treated nicely and have our order correctly made."}
{"text":"I always order carne asada fries with nacho cheese sauce and it is ALWAYS exceptional.  Today I ordered my usual and this time it was the best that it has ever been and I order this at lease once a week.  This was a 10 star rated dinner even though I can only give 5 stars.  This had perfect fries as they were not hard so they were kind of soft; it was filled with guacamole and sour cream along with melted shredded cheese and in between that was nacho cheese sauce in the middle and on top. Man this was really good because I have never given a Yelp review but I had to tell everybody about Carne Asada Fry PERFECTION!!!!"}
{"text":"This place doesn't even deserve 1 star. First off it looks like it's barely clean on the inside. Second, the tacos I had were not good at all, and third you have to listen to the staff screaming in Spanish the whole time your eating. Not pleasurable at all. Do not go here for tacos.. Find somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Breakfast Burrito! That's as far far as we have made it through what appears to be an extensive menu. So....

Try the breakfast burrito!"}
{"text":"The food here is great! Not greasy and a much better quality than most fast food mexican restaurants."}
{"text":"The cashier had a bad attitude, plus she took my order wrong! When I asked her to remake my burrito because it was not how I wanted it she got mad at me. After they remade my burrito it looked like they just tried to remove what I didn't want in the first place and wrapped it back into a new tortilla.....sad! 
Only reason I rate them the stars I did was because after I finished picking out the stuff I didn't want and ate the burrito I cant deny they make a good burrito... I just hope the cashiers customer service improves."}
{"text":"As someone else mentioned.....Shrinking burritos! This place has gotten cocky and thought it could trick some of us long time customers. Not anymore. Too bad to, our family used to eat here twice a week for on the go items...As soon as I told others at a family reunion, we have all stopped going. Probably $300 in revenue a month we had spent there as a whole family. Might not be a whole lot to some but they lost 22-25 good solid customers now from us...Plus, this place could never get an order right. The college girl behind the counter was nice but could not hear a thing...Going down the street now...Will you ever get an order right here Los? Will you earn our business back? We are here to listen.."}
{"text":"Service stinks here!  i was looking right at the board and pointed to the two taco combo.  I got just 2 tacos not the combo and when I asked where the beans and rice were they acted like i was imposing on them.  If someone orders two tacos don't' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart?  Then they tossed the beans and rice in the bag and made a huge mess out of everything.  I guess 'cause I am a gringo they simply just don't care!"}
{"text":"First, the hours on Yelp aren't correct. They are open until Midnight most nights and until 2AM (not PM) others.  We hurried over to be there by 2pm without real cause.

I had the carne asada tacos.  Pleasantly, they come with guacamole and pico already, so you don't need to order that extra.  The guacamole was even pretty good - not watery and thin like some places make it.  The tacos were pretty good -- not the best I've had, but not bad.

The Jamaica (hibiscus) iced tea was really, really sweet.  If you are looking for an unsweetened tea, don't get this.

The place was clean, and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Los Favs, where do I start? How about with the cashier who used a counterfeit pen; on the 5 dollar bill that I gave her? Or maybe the 15 min wait for a cold Bean and Cheese burrito? I'm pretty disappointed, as this was going to be my dinner for tonight, but now my trash receptacle has the pleasure of enjoying whatever it is that I was served. I've heard good things about your establishment Los Favs, but failed to experience them for myself. I have eaten at some of the Best Mexican Restaurants in the Valley ( Comedor Guadalajara, Rito's, Carolinas, El Norteños, Barrio Cafe, Habanero's Mexican Grill, I could go on and on and on) I thought I'd order something basic to see what I would get, but looks like I would have been better off going to Taco Bell :-/."}
{"text":"I cannot even begin to explain the love I have and have had for this place since it opened. I used to live next door and it was always my Sunday breakfast spot. Now that I'm back home, it has become my 3 times a week breakfast spot - yes, I live on the west side and yes I am willing to drive 20 miles for their California burrito. I don't care about gas prices or photo radar.. all I care about is their burritos and green salsa... Its delicious, bursting with flavor, perfect tortillas and a whole lot of authentic Mexican love wrapped inside.

Not only this, but its CLEAN, which is rare for a joint like this and not only that, but the staff are NICE, and speak excellent English, which I dig because my Spanish absolutely blows.. They're always smiling and they even remember what you want.. All I have to do these days is walk in and my burrito is already being prepared. Before I even pay. What is better than that?

If you love potatoes, like myself.. try the California. If you like the usual carne asada.. theirs is excellent...  Actually, if you just enjoy Mexican food in general, eat here.. its real, good non greasy, tasty, orgasmic Mexican food and the Horchata is delish and their enchiladas are spectacular..

God, why must I live so far away??"}
{"text":"I love los favs! Everything that I have ever ordered here has been super delicious. This place puts all the other fast food mexican chains to shame! I order my usual burrito (bean and cheese with rice, potato, and guacamole). I get my food fast and it is always right! Friendly service and cheep! And I love how quickly they're expanding. Go los!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for the breakfast burrito based on the reviews here. 

I gave this review 2 stars because the service was friendly and prompt. The burrito on the other hand was extremely dry and hard to stomach. 

I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Come here for lunch regularly and am always pleased.  Great food, great service, and always clean.  Definitely one of my favorite taco shops in town!"}
{"text":"The tacos were ehhh and they're pretty expensive by taco \"standards\". I was disappointed. 

Disclaimer: I'm from Texas where we have small taco shops and taco trucks everywhere that make greasy, delicious, mouth watering tacos for $1-2. Maybe my standards are just extremely high, but I left unsatisfied."}
{"text":"Best breakfast burrito around. I almost always get the chorizo. If I come in later in the day, the quesadilla is a must. Very fresh tortillas Everytime."}
{"text":"Love love this place! 
Love that they have chicken as an option for the rolled tacos (hard to find other places only
Serve beef rolled tacos...) 
The salsa is soroan or however you spell it style! Watery but so flavorful and perfect for any item on their menu.

We always get bean burrito 
Rolled tacos 
And of course horchata! It's bomb here! 

The prices are unreal coming from California 
Must try"}
{"text":"We love the food here! So why the low stars ? The last time we were in the place reeked of bad BO!! Of course after a while we got used to it, but now thinking about it, it was so disgusting that we don't even want to go back.  Really sad"}
{"text":"I was undecided on this place for awhile. But, after sticking to the basics: bean burrito, taco, rolled tacos it's grown on me."}
{"text":"I use to frequent this establishment a couple of times a week for a Breakfast Burrito, however, on one of my visits the gal behind the counter seemed to have pink eye.  It's rare that I will go there now..."}
{"text":"Good food. Bad service.
When you're dealing with a lunch rush, passing out food that's piling up on the counter is more important than wiping down drink dispensers or picking up straw wrappers from the utensils counter. Yet that's what I've seen them do. Also, when passing out food, it's important to pass out the oldest food first, especially when the oldest orders have been sitting for several minutes waiting to go out and people out for lunch are in a hurry. The staff just always seems kind of disinterested in taking orders and distributing food with any kind of urgency whatsoever."}
{"text":"Oh Los Faves, you sure know how to make a great breakfast burrito. What I love about Los Faves is that their burritos are not greasy, and they offer them with either flour or whole wheat tortilla. I'm boring with my order and usually get a sausage burrito, and sometimes a quesadilla. Their quesadilla is made with American cheese and not with queso blanco. On weekend mornings, expect a long wait with orders (around 15-20 minutes) since they get really busy. It's a good place to get a nice warm burrito and do yourself a favor and ask for the salsa verde, it gives the right kick to deliciousness!"}
{"text":"It's good, authentic Mexican food in a casual atmosphere. Everything is reasonably priced and service is fast. I used to drive to Tempe for rellenos but Los Favs are delicious and I can avoid the commute. 

You're not going to replace a fine dining experience here but it's tasty and consistent."}
{"text":"In a word...awful. Was expecting much better based on other reviews, and several recommendations from friends. Chimichanga was stuffed with 95% onions and peppers, 5% meat. Carne Asada tacos were 75% guacamole, meat was cold and hard. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Los Fav's Management came thru and made it right!  They apologized for their employee's bad behavior and sent me a gift certificate to entice me to come back.  I'll give it another try because I do think their food is a good value for the price."}
{"text":"Great chorizo breakfast burrito $4 and change. Authentico muy delicious. Will be back , clean, fast not a funky taco joint simple and worth it"}
{"text":"I heard good things about this company. Looking for one of their locations, I wanted to go to one near here then I saw this. Walking in it was clean and the service was quick and the lady was on the ball and helpful. I ordered the 2 chicken Enchiladas, it was fresh but the cheese inside wasn't melted like it was suppose too. I threw that away and ordered the 2 chicken tacos and they were tasty, fresh and cooked correctly. If I don't come back to this location I will definetly go to another one!"}
{"text":"I go to Mexican Fast Food all the time, but this exceeds the Rest. I like the California Burritos (Steak, Potatoes, & Cheese). They crisp the Potatoes perfect. The Hot Sauce is fantastic! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"The Biscuits on Dobson was just way too crowded and annoying the other day, so we swung in here for a breakfast burrito.  Not our usual location, but the great quality of the bacon breakfast burrito was the same as we are used to.  Those things are addictive!  They were very busy and had two registers going with two friendly employees.  As the bumper stickers say, \"I heart Los Favs!\""}
{"text":"While not in the same class as Elmers, Paquime, or Polibertos, this particular Los Favs is pretty quality. The last 5 or so visits have not been disappointing,  and its run the gamut from burritos to breakfast burritos lol. Go with the chori breakfast burrito w/beans.  Especially if you just ran 4-5 miles. Anyway, if its too late for elmers, this 'll do"}
{"text":"YUM-O! This place blows Filiberto's out of the water. Their breakfast burritos are second to none.  If I ever manage to escape this hellhole known as the Valley of the Sun, Los Fav's will be one of the few things I miss."}
{"text":"Went there today, very good food, I would suggest the breakfast burrito, the machaca was very good. I also ordered a crispy beef taco that seemed to be a little bit to greasy for my liking. Overall very good though!!"}
{"text":"I got the vegetarian burrito and thought it was just average tasting.

They do not post the nutritional facts of their food, which scares me a bit.  I have done some digging in the past when places like this didn't post anything, and the results were scary (ie, tons of Trans fats).

The burrito size to price ratio was above average also.

I doubt I will make the journey back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite taco shop type mexican place. They open early & close late. We almost always get the breakfast burritos & they are always excellent. Get the green sauce !"}
{"text":"Best Carne Asada fries in the valley. What else can you ask for?"}
{"text":"They Are slowly, but surely winning me back, so I wanted to update the review to reflect the experiences I've had since writing my last review. Let's see how things go."}
{"text":"Don't ever call in an order! I called in and ordered two burritos and added cheese. When I went to pick up my order they got the whole thing wrong and didn't even fix it or let me add cheese because they wanted to charge me extra for it. I only had my debit card and they can't charge the register if it's under $2. Absolutely horrible customer service. They screwed up and made me pay extra to fix it."}
{"text":"I have been going to Los Favoritos for over 5 years and the quality is still there. This is by far the best mexican restaurant when your first two necessities are time, and quality. The food is always fresh, the time it takes to order is always quick, and the portions are huge. The breakfast burritos are in a league all of their own and I will be a forever fan of them."}
{"text":"New favorite breakfast burrito they made it how I wanted. I love Los favs. They are open later and early for great food."}
{"text":"Slow service this time. I went in and ordered 3 burritos. I am sitting in the front right by the register waiting for my number to be called. The guy and the girl at the register asked me what my number was. I told them 104!! As I sit there waiting for my food and seeing others who ordered after me get their food i patiently wait. They clearly realized the skipped me and either didn't get my order made or they gave my food to someone else. They finally after 20 mins I get my food. I told the guy that you clearly skipped me and they should at least give me a drink for waiting so long. The guy told me that they called my number already. I said I was right here in the front the whole time waiting to be called. You guys obviously asked me my number. Why would u ask for my number if you realized I was sitting there forever waiting for my number to be called. The guy tried to blame me for their mistake. He also tried to say that the cook messed up the orders. Well man which one is it. Is it my fault or the cook. He didn't own that he made a mistake and a he didn't even apologize. He was even hesitant to give me a drink. Poor customer service. The people around me were even stating that they skipped me. This place has great food but customer service is not so great."}
{"text":"Never going back. Ordered a to go order, bacon and chorizo breakfast burritos, my order number was 22. When i got there they forgot the bacon burrito, no big deal but the guy working then accused me of calling the wrong store. I told him i called the right store, he took my order, like i somehow magically guessed the right order number they had in the window, he then said check your phone to make sure, now I'm getting pissed. They then took my card again to charge me for another burrito and said it will be ready in 10 to 15 minutes. 1st they made the mistake and blamed me for it, good service would be to make me a new burrito on the house, i ordered before so i didn't have to sit there for 15 minutes. I also asked them to remake the other burrito i don't want a burrito with eggs sitting under a heat lamp for 20 minutes. The guy then argued with me saying they already cooked it, i told him I'm paying for fresh food not food dying under a heat lamp. He then stated talking to the lady working there in Spanish and looking at me, he also did pinchy gringo, now i know what that means. At this point i demanded them to take off my charge and give me a receipt that they reversed the charge, they tried to not and i demanded, the lady finally did it, they actually tried to still charge me for food when i told them they lost my business and i didn't want my order.  So they made a simple mistake blamed the customer for there mistake, insisted on serving me old dry food, called me a racial slur in Spanish, and when i said i didn't want the order any more still tried to charge me."}
{"text":"These guys are the worst.  I call in the order and I show up 40 minutes later and they have no record.  The lady stated there was a shift change but it sounded just like the person on the phone.  I love Los Favs but I'll never come to this location again."}
{"text":"Good for when you want a plate of affordable Mexican food. The enchiladas are tasty and so is the horchata. It's similar to a Filiberto's or Fredrico's. I like that it is open late but I didn't give it 5 stars because I'm not a huge fan of the enchilada sauce."}
{"text":"I want to say, I ended up going back several times and the service has improved and the burritos are staying consistent in flavor now."}
{"text":"Phenomenal breakfast burritos! I have had them all and can't say a bad thing about them. I don't know about anything else they make but they are famous for the breakfast burritos!  Bacon is my favorite. It does take a while for them to make since it's made to order so I recommend calling ahead if possible others you'll be waiting up to 15 minutes for your order as multiple people walk in and out with phone orders (plus, you can pay when you get there, don't have to over the phone)."}
{"text":"This is one of the most disappointing lunches I have ever encountered. Let me tell you why. 

The menu was clear and seemed to have a good selection so I got the veggi burrito and my friend got the fish tacos (baja). The prices were good so we were pleased until we got our food, chips are not included not a big deal so we went back up and waited in line to buy some. 

The salsa if that is what you want to call it was really tomato sauce I think, bland and flavorless and all the tops on every bottle were super dirty so I did not even want to try it but I just opened a bottle up and poured some out to avoid the yuk on top of the spout that had obviously not been cleaned in some time. 

My 'veggie' burrito was watered down beans (slightly warmed) with a bunch of wet lettuce inside and a little bit of cheese. My friend's 'baja' tacos were some frozen fish sticks in a couple of taco wraps with some soggy lettuce on top and the baja sauce was actually tartar sauce! 

When we tried to explain the problem to the people at the counter they hardly spoke english and did not seem to care so we will not be back. 

p.s. they don't seem to clean the soda fountain either it was sticky dirty when we went to get our drinks and I found it quite disgusting. and just so you know we went for an early lunch it was only 11:30am."}
{"text":"Let me start by explaining that I have a Los Favoritos by my work at Guadalupe and McQueen (Mesa) Dr, which is fabulous and my coworkers and I go there frequently, so i figured I would try this one, which is slightly closer to my home. The fact the food was edible and there was extra lettuce and my beans and rice were warm is the only reason it got 2 stars. I ordered the 2 cheese enchilada combo . . . it is so simply yet they screwed it up, how you ask? The cheese was not even melted -_- and with it being cold, the sauce everything else was cold as well. Never going back to this location. It was even super busy there, so there was no excuse as to a cold CHEESE enchilada!"}
{"text":"At first I was skeptical because of the reviews on yelp, but the food was quite good. There was nothing wrong with my order. It did take awhile for my order to come out but other then that, it's a nice place"}
{"text":"Best Vegan Burritos around town.  And the horchata is so rich and sweet that it basically tastes like a liquefied churro.  Amazing."}
{"text":"This is in my neighborhood and finally stopped in yesterday.  Not a lot of customers and service was very fast.  Place is very clean and they have a large menu.  I order a beef taco and cheese enchilada with rice and beans.  I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was!  The taco shell was fresh, meat was juicy, the enchilada had very good flavor and cheesy.  Even the beans had a good flavor along with the rice.  I have been to Mex restaurants with a sit down menu and waitress service, where the food was not this good.   I do not know about other items on the menu but defiantly going to order that again."}
{"text":"I love this place I eat here at least once a week it's always clean and nice inside and the food is always great. The red sauce is awesome."}
{"text":"Boy have they raised their prices...now $3 for a tamale that is a tad longer than middle finger...red sauce barely warm...was $1.60.. carne asada quesadilla was $4.90 now $6.50...was cut in thirds and one piece only had two bites with filling...prior visit was breakfast burrito...they cut back on filling as had few bites to get to filling....have never had problem with order or service....but visits will be less..they do have great red hot sauce..."}
{"text":"Very good fresh food. Was working nearby for a week and ate here several times. Breakfast burritos are great! Veggie burrito was delicious...beans are really fresh & the tortillas are yummy! And the service is really good. Very friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Wooow, this place is horrible! I did not want pico de gallo and instead wanted onion and cilantro due to allergies and they charge me $1 each for cilantro and $1 for onions. Horrible customer service! Be warned about this place!"}
{"text":"I think this is the best fast mexican food in Chandler or the surrounding area.  The food quality is high and consistant.  The prices are downright CHEAP.  I really like the bean and cheese burritos and the chili relleno burritos.  The jalapenos and carrots are a must and I am thrilled that they started selling Tamarindo."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic Mexican food location! I have never been disappointed and actually come all the way across town to have their food."}
{"text":"Food is actually really good here and their breakfast burritos are great! But I seriously have never had a friendly cashier person. No smiles, no greeting,no thank you's...they always seemed annoyed that you are there to order food. And god forbid you ask for side sauce, they act like it's a total chore. But the food is so good we always come back."}
{"text":"I admit, we go here more for my wife than for me.  It comes off as typical Mexican food, but the chorizo is great.  It wouldn't hurt them to take out the trash more often as the trash bins are always full."}
{"text":"I've never written a review for any restaurant before but I HAD to take the time to write one for Los Faves. THIS.PLACE.IS.AWESOME! I started going here (almost daily) when I worked right next to the one in Tempe. The Carne Asada Burrito was recommended to me which was to die for with tons of asada meat and guacamole. The seasoning is great and the flavor is specatcular. I branched out to get the Carne Asada California burrito one day and that was the end of life as I know it. I have been ADDICTED ever since. I dream about those babies!  Must haves when coming to Los Faves are definitely the breakfast burritos (chorizo especially), the carne asada burritos (both reg and Cali), and the rolled tacos. Order any and all of those items and you'll leave impressed and satisfied."}
{"text":"The best food ever! Fast, friendly, fresh and very clean! Oh yeah CHEAP!!! Just the best there is and you never leave hungry!"}
{"text":"First came across this little gem by way of a breakfast burrito years ago, now I am a fan of most of their food in general. The ladies who work there are always friendly and the food is fast! The prices are also a great reason to try this place as it is on the cheaper end."}
{"text":"Definitely like others said, try the breakfast burrito! They are definitely worth it, they are huge and can fill you up. Looks can be deceiving, because they look small on the menu board, and they will look small when you get it. You may order two because you feel hungry, but trust me, you will barely be able to finish HALF of one! They are very fulfilling at all times of day, especially when you're  just looking for something quick and cheap.

The minute you order, they will immediately begin cooking your order in the back, which means, yes, there will be a little bit of a wait. But the wait is worth it. 

OTHER THINGS I RECOMMEND  YOU TRY OUT: 

Rolled Tacos- DELICIOUS
Nachos
Carne Asada w/ beans!"}
{"text":"Los Favoritos makes the best breakfast burritos that I have tasted so far!!! I get the egg, potato, and cheese burrito. The eggs are fluffy, the cheese plentiful, and the potatoes are FRENCH FRIES! If thats not love, I dont know what is. Haha. I love mixing their green and red sauces on my burrito to make a christmas sauce. Their burritos are not huge but a pretty good size and a pretty cheap breakfast when you compare to how much you would pay to get full at McDonalds or Wendy's. The only issue I have is that they don't speak much english there. Other than that, the breakfast burro with no meat is great and the atmosphere, although a little plain, is clean which is one of my biggest fears in little taco shops like this. I have been to some Filibertos that I felt were not very clean and honestly was a little skeptical to even try Los Fav's. Now that I have, I will have to give more of these little taco's shops a try and start listening to the hub a little more!"}
{"text":"Good Mexican food......it's solid.
I'll eat here over any fast food Mexican. 
This location is super awesome and quick.
I'll be back"}
{"text":"McDonald's snack wraps got nothing on Los Favoritos big ol' breakfast burittos.  

I went with a bean, egg and cheese breakfast burrito and O.M.G. that is a hearty breakfast that's made to satisfy.  It was oozing with refried beans, egg and lots of melty cheeses.  Sides of salsa came with it, spicy red salsa and bold green salsa.  I only wish the containers of salsa were bigger because I love salsa.

Breakfast of champions right here.  Hot damn!"}
{"text":"So I just wanna say that I never write negative reviews because I've worked in restaurants and I know how it is...I like to give people the benefit of the doubt. But they literally they screwed up our order so bad!! It was a Sunday around 6pm and my sister and I both ordered chimichanga combos. I asked for no refried beans and extra rice instead....And I was given a side of beans like normal. The only thing they did right on my sister and my order was they didn't put sour cream on our chimichangas. YAY. But they did proceed to not put guac on hers even though they put it on mine??? And the chimi itself was very disappointing....The tortilla was still pretty raw all over except for the corners which were light brown. And the horchata was underwhelming. I just don't understand what the problem was because when we walked in, there were only 2 other people in there and we didn't have to wait in a line or anything....they weren't even busy. The worst part is that it was to-go and we didn't realise all of this until we got home. If you order anything to-go, make sure to check that everything is good before you leave the restaurant!"}
{"text":"Good food, nothing fancy, need to tell the young lady at counter to smile. Prices good, Chimichanga platter for $7.50. I'm visiting the Phoenix area for a few days, would come back."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick lunch.  The Chili Verde Chimi is excellent.  Not fancy but really good Mexican food.  Fast Service at great prices."}
{"text":"This place screws up my order every time I go in there. You better check your burrito if you ask for anything other than the standard. I was dumb enough to give them another chance. Messed it up again"}
{"text":"Have been going here since they opened. I really love all of their menu items but in particular the shredded beef tacos with green sauce. The last few months the service was extremely slow. After taking a break from dining here I was happy to see the last few times that the wait time to make the food has gone way down. Overall this restaurant is great and always a go to for my family."}
{"text":"The carne asada is to die for! I love this place and would choose this place over any other competitors"}
{"text":"This place its close to my house so I really wanted to like it. I had the carne asada fries and the hubby had the carne asada burrito. The meat was good and the guacamole was fresh. However the burrito only comes with meat, pico de Gallo and guacamole. No beans or rice. That might be an AZ thing but what kind of burrito doesn't come with rice and beans? Anyway we got our food and we asked for lemon and they don't carry lemon!Their green salsa was really good but the red one tasted like it had gone bad. I guess overall the food was ok but i wouldn't come here again. I can't get over the prices. 1 carne asada taco is $3.75 yes! You read right $3.75!"}
{"text":"When you are hungover their breakfast burritos will NEVER fail you. Great and authentic."}
{"text":"Just had a superb chorizo breakfast burrito!  Extremely tasty and very big/filling for the price. I highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"I started with my first los fav breakfast burrito at the los favs in Tempe. I was delighted to find this Chandler. Location right near my new home 2 years ago. I love their breakfast burritos and the carne asada fries are to die for! Great food and awesome service."}
{"text":"This review is for the brand new Los Favoritos located in Chandler on Alma School and Queen Creek Rds. Their location does not yet have a website listing as the 10 other locations do. I will admit, I am Mexican. I am a wonderful cook but even I like to take a break from cooking once in a while. I have been to many good taco stands and Mexican restaurants in Arizona.  I was SO disappointed in this place.  Sad, because it appeared to have good reviews. I will also admit that my husband (who is a gringo) and I both ordered different versions of Enchilada dinners.  Ok so here's my first complaint.  Unless you ABSOLUTELY ADORE green peppers, do NOT order their chicken enchiladas.  It should really be called a Green Pepper Enchilada with a bit of chicken thrown in.  Not only that, but gigantic chunks of onion.  It doesn't take a genius to figure out that those two ingredients are fillers so that they don't have to use as much meat.  My husband had a chicken enchilada and a cheese enchilada.  Hard to believe, but the cheese enchilada was full of green peppers also! My second complaint was the so called \"guacamole\". It came in a 2 oz container and we were charged $1 for it.  That is ridiculous for two reasons: The small amount we were sold and the fact that it was some kind of fake pureed avocado. Guacamole implies that it should have onion and tomato, chilies, etc. in it..otherwise it is just pureed avocado.  Last but not least, they are very chintzy on the rice and beans. That is probably the cheapest thing for them to make and serve and yet we were lucky to get 2 ounces of each on our to-go containers.  As far as flavor, my husband, who is not Mexican, thought it was pretty bland, so so much for the authentic Mexican flavor.  That said, the price for the 2 Enchilada dinner was pretty low and now we understand why.  We will not be returning to this establishment."}
{"text":"Personally, I used to come here a lot more often than I do.  I've noticed, what I feel to be, a rather slide in the quality in the food.  The carne asada burrito I recently got tasted okay, but the meat tasted lesser quality than I was used to.  The guacamole was a bit thinner than i like.  I gave them this score due to them having much better history with me and I hope/think/suspect  they had a weak day.  If they do better or worse next time, I'll post something that will reflect it."}
{"text":"This is an unassuming little taco shop that has rockin burritos.  Breakfast burritos, carne asada, chicken and more.  I've yet to be disappointed with the food or the service in general.

Only reason I am not giving this place a 5 out of 5 is due to a couple of times where I had John S.'s issue.  Got a chicken rather than machaka burrito and also got a sausage breakfast burrito rather than a ham another time.  The food was great and these have been rare occasions in my experience, so 4 out of 5."}
{"text":"The vibe of this place was nice. It was clean and they were fast at getting me my food. 

The only thing is I asked for a potato,egg, and cheese and there was a little bit of bacon inside, maybe from someone else's burrito. 

I'm not one of those crazy vegetarians, but if someone was they would have probably had some words to say!!

All in all, everything was good except for the 5 bacon pieces in my burrito. The guys working there were really cool."}
{"text":"It's shocking when AZ yelpers get Mexican food wrong.  The fact that this shit hole has a 4 Star average is comedic.

I took my wife and kids here for the second and last time over the weekend.  I'd ordered the carne asada burro the last time I was here and it was OK for a dive, but nothing special and it didn't taste fresh.  This time was one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had.  I shudder to call it a \"dining experience\" at all.

First of all, they had some unhappy, unfriendly, unkempt high school chick working the counter.  She didn't say hello or make a half assed effort to offer decent customer service.  After I sat my family at a dirty table, or at least the cleanest in the place, I reluctantly ordered the pollo asado and rolled tacos.  

The rolled tacos tasted like they were frozen and reheated.  Not fresh, bland, boring, and I'm not convinced it was beef.  

The pollo asado was also clearly not fresh and the meat looked like turkey pot pie pieces, except this was no comfort food.  These chunks of meat had the consistency of rubber and the color of ash.  And it tasted funny...  That's the best I could describe it, just didn't taste right.

We quickly informed the asshole working at the counter that the food tasted funny and asked if we could get something else.  She looked at me strange, like I farted, then asked me to yell across the room to tell the manager -- while guests were in there eating.  The lazy manager finally stammered over, stared at the food, never making eye contact, and asked, \"What do you want me to do?\"  No apology, just a dirty look and some slightly better shitty food.

Stay away from this place.  They don't care about customers.  They don't care about putting out quality food.  You shouldn't care about them."}
{"text":"Meh. Carne asada is ok. Just ok. Definitely better than, say, Taco Bell, but nowhere near as good as good ol' Bay Area Mexican food. Mmmm..."}
{"text":"Good nachos, breakfast burritos, and regular tacos."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast burritos! My husband and I got a sausage and a bacon burrito and they were incredible! The burritos are the perfect size leaving you pleasantly full yet not stuffed. The tortillas are excellently made (not gummy) and the meat is fresh. My favorite thing about these burritos is they are not greasy in the slightest! I found the green sauce to be the perfect addition!"}
{"text":"I wish I would have found this place a lot sooner. Chicken Chimmy, California Carne Asada burrito, and any breakfast burritos are so tasty. The beans, rice, and sauce are very authentic. I did notice it is less greasy and salty than Filbertos. Overall a great place you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"There are a lot of taco shops out there.  This place is pretty good and has been the most consistent about the quality of the food.  They are friendly,  and when they are very busy,  they still maintain a certain coolness about themselves.  Good place. I wish it was bigger and they had a server come to your table.  I think they would excel."}
{"text":"We've been going here for years but I just finally got around to reviewing.  Compared to other Mexican food in the same price range, Los Favs is far superior.   The shrimp burrito is amazing.  I was nervous but tried it based on another Yelp review, and I have never looked back.  It's just spicy enough and super-stuffed with rice, shrimp, and veggies.  

Inside décor is nothing to write home about, but it's usually pretty clean.  There are frequently groups of annoying high school kids there, though, so we usually get our food to go.  The bathrooms are super clean and nice for a fast food-ish type place.

We eat here once every other week or so and will continue to do so.  Customer service is hit or miss, but the food is consistent and fast.  I wish they delivered!"}
{"text":"I have been craving a delicious Mexican shrimp cocktail and, oh boy, do they deliver.  It is a bit pricey at $10 but the size definitely justifies the price.  The blend of shrimp, avocado, tomatoes, cucumber, onions and more is absolutely delicious.  Most of their food is a bit hot for me but everything is delicious.  This is on my list of comfort food sources."}
{"text":"I've only had breakfast burritos here and they are amazing.  The best!  However if you're looking for good service do not come here.  The people at the register do not greet you and seem annoyed to have to take your order.  I've had my order messed up a few times which isn't a big deal but they always seem like I've asked for something unheard of because they need to fix my order.  Check your order before you leave and don't expect friendly service to go along with the great food here."}
{"text":"I had a craving for a breakfast burrito this morning, so I got on Yelp  to find a local establishment. The location at Cooper and Ray is where I chose. I ordered the chorizo breakfast burrito to go, and it was accurate and delicious. The cashier was friendly and smiling, even as she answered the phone for the fifth time in the approximately 5 minutes that I waited for my order. I will be back to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"great service, food was pretty great - my kids absolutely loved the churros as well. Will be back!"}
{"text":"The lady really professional and polite great food love this place I've eaten here three times recently each time delicious"}
{"text":"This place is so delicious! Great tacos. Love the breakfast burritos and the bean and cheese burritos.  Good service and open late!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give you a one star. Your employees cooking were very NOTICEABLY rude. I don't stand out or anything crazy but I walk in (A 22year old blonde white girl) and they sat there staring at me and laughing and when I told my girlfriend next to me that I had a feeling I was being stared at and laughed at we both look up and catch them staring and they immediately looked down/away. I feel so embarrassed and I'm still unsure what made me so funny. Nobody else was in line either when this was happening. Just the two of us. Anyways very upset and need to be contacted by a manager. Thank you.."}
{"text":"OK, I couldn't stay away and the good news is the breakfast burrito seems to be back (at least \"closer\") to my old favorite. Quality, size and consistency seems to be much better over the last year -- and we are fans once again."}
{"text":"Their breakfast burritos are absolutely AMAZING!! And super affordable for a a huge burrito. I tried their nachos and was shocked. It was so delicious and perfectly in sync with each other. The cashier was okay but I overalls like the place. Hoping to visit again so sure!"}
{"text":"They certainly could get a little more organized. Worth the wait though."}
{"text":"1st time to this location and definitely not the last.
This has got to be the cleanest restaurant that I have dined in in a very looooong time.
It was spotless, I mean perfect, like they just opened for the 1st day.  I am a clean freak especially in restaurants, and I am beyond impressed.

But my gratitude doesn't stop there, the ladies at the counter were super sweet, friendly and helpful.  We dined at 10:30am and the restaurant was pretty quiet.  The staff stayed busy cleaning and stocking.  Very hard workers.

Our food was hot, fresh, and sooo good.  This isn't near our home, however will definitely come back. Yummy!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Used to go to fillibertos, then found out this place is wayyyyy better. The cashier is always so nice to me. I can't remember her name... but she always knows what I order, even when I call in lol. The chili rellenos and shrimp diablo is amazing. My boyfriends burritos always look good too. Clean, cheerful atmosphere."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why people have any problem with Favs. Every time that I go here, which is like once a week. 
The tortillas are always fresh and the meat is perfectly cook. My favorite part of Favs is there delusions red and green sauce. 
Everyone is always very nice there and the front area is always very cleaned up. Any time I want a burrito, I will always go to Favs!!!"}
{"text":"Greateat food, it feels really clean unlike other taco shop, I always get their carne asada and shrimp taco. The green sauce is the best!"}
{"text":"CALL THIS PLACE LOS FOREVER The price is always worth the food but the wait is not, sitting for forty-five minutes for two shredded beed tacos and a bean an cheese burrrito is ridiculous. The facility is always clean, my only problem is the wait for food."}
{"text":"My friend and I both ordered the rolled tacos with guacamole.  They were pretty good.  Kind of mediocre, the guacamole wasn't my favorite.  I found the shredded cheese on top off putting.  I would prefer it to be melted. 

The interior was clean and well stocked, decorated and the service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Shrimp cocktail Mexican style is one of my favorite indulgences! About a year ago, we came to a different location of Mis Favoritos and I was so thrilled that they had my delight. But this time, at this new were location, my delight was an average half hearted attempt to just get the food out. 

Of course I ordered the shrimp cocktail. My partner, who doesn't prefer seafood, had a plate of ground beef and pastor tacos, with a cup of tea. The attitude of the girl behind the counter was not the friendliest. She especially wasn't too happy when I told her the tea tasted off (like old dish soap to be specific but I didn't want to be too specific with her LOL!)

When my cocktail was ready, I had to request limes would usually come with it. Again she didn't seem too happy but she did comply. And we had to go fetch our own salsa bottles with somebody left on their table. The service here another words it does help yourself. And if you happened to be on top of things a shrimp cocktail does usually come with limes and crackers. My partner said their was nothing too special about her tacos either. They were just lacking in flavor and toppings. Again, no limes. 

Oh yeah, and it usually comes with more than 10 or 12 shrimp for a large one. I only had 10 so there you go. 

Sad to say that I'm not sure that Mis Favoritos will become my favorite from here on out."}
{"text":"The one star is for customer service. I ordered a chimichanga to go, and I got home to find my order was made incorrectly as sopes. It wasn't a big deal, and I figured I would speak to them the next time I was there. There's apparently no manager here tonight, and they will not discount or even apologize for the incorrect meal. I've worked in food service, and the establishments I worked at never hesitated to correct a meal. I realize mistakes happen, but customer service is essential to keep people coming back. I'll call the manager in the morning to speak about the situation. Otherwise, I'll take my business to the dozens of other Mexican food restaurants."}
{"text":"Love their carne asada nacho supreme! Craving it right now"}
{"text":"LOVE the food LOVE the employees at this LOS Fav.  Its been my breakfast place for many many years !"}
{"text":"Went in at 1pm on Sunday place was busy but no busier than normal for a Sunday. I ordered a bean and cheese burrito and Super Nachos to go. I literally waited for over 25 minutes after ordering. People who came in after me left well before I did. The last few times I have came in have gotten worse and worse as far as wait time. From now on I will drive out of my way to go to the one on Kyrene and ray. Get it together Los"}
{"text":"Open until 2 am on the weekends.  Checked this place out mostly because no others were open.  Good variety menu.  Carne asada tacos were very good.  Beans aren't made with lard, so that's good! Rice was tasty.  The rolled tacos could have used more meat but then again the order came with 6 so it's satisfying enough. 
Clean restaurant,  friendly staff,  decent prices. 

The have apple soda!"}
{"text":"You can not really go wrong with a breakfast burrito at Los Favs. They are always tasty and fresh, and they use real tortillas. We have also gotten their refried beans a couple times, and we enjoyed them as well."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's my daily study breakfast  burrito spot! They open up early so it's perfect for so last minute studying and grubbing before my early summer class!"}
{"text":"My middle daughter moved to Arizona a couple of years ago and really missed the San Diego-style Carne Asada Burritos she was used to.  Everytime she would come home she would hit Chili Banditos/Buenos Dias for her \"fix\".  Then she discovered Los Favoritos and called me excitedly to let me know she had finally found a Taco Shop that had carne asada burritos the way she liked them.  When I came to Chandler she made sure to bring my family here to try it out and we liked it too.  She's been eating here every since.  Smart daughter."}
{"text":"My son Daniel kept buggin me to try this place, but I was reluctant. No good reason. I just already have my fave taco shops, and plus the bland strip-mall experior just didn't shout \"Eat here\" to me.

But he got to choose where to eat the other night after his National Honor Society induction ceremony, and he chose here. 

I gotta say, my kid really is smart. Los Favoritos is definitely a notch above typical fast-food-ish Mexican. On my son's recommendation, I got the \"breakfast\" chorizo burrito (served all day). It was on a tortilla the size of a small planet, and stuffed full of savory & spicy meat, cheese, potato and egg.  My husband ordered carne asada, and Daniel got chili rellenos. They were wonderful! 

The service was ify, simply becuase communication was a bit hard with non-English native speakers. But they get an A for effort.

I guess I owe Los Favoritos an apology for judging it on outward appearances alone. I'll certainly be going back!"}
{"text":"My son Daniel kept buggin me to try this place, but I was reluctant. No good reason. I just already have my fave taco shops, and plus the bland strip-mall experior just didn't shout \"Eat here\" to me.

But he got to choose where to eat the other night after his National Honor Society induction ceremony, and he chose here. 

I gotta say, my kid really is smart. Los Favoritos is definitely a notch above typical fast-food-ish Mexican. On my son's recommendation, I got the \"breakfast\" chorizo burrito (served all day). It was on a tortilla the size of a small planet, and stuffed full of savory & spicy meat, cheese, potato and egg.  My husband ordered carne asada, and Daniel got chili rellenos.

{"text":"Orders 2 Carne Asada special platters. Worst tasting carne asada I've ever had, canned vegetables used for the rice i mean come on really? Ordered 3 rolled tacos with guacamole and cheese can't mess those up right? Well they weren't even fried and were as limp as a wet noodle. Save you're money and go to McDonalds! Better yet get some frozen taquitos and you'll be better off. Wish I could get the $26 back."}
{"text":"I went to the starbucks right next to it several times but i didn't dare to eat in here because my go-to's are always either rubios or chipotle(haha). anyways, everything was delicious while the toppings and sauce being not too heavy. We didn't get served because this is not a restaurant but a fastfood place so i can't really rate their service. The cashier that helped us order was friendly even though it was late at night when we went to eat. Meats and chickens were all really nicely cooked, taco shells were crispy, lettuce fresh and the lard rice was on point! Just about the right saltiness and greasiness. We went back home happy with our belly full :) 4 stars because some of the outside seats were taken by bums and inside was too cold"}
{"text":"I am ashamed...ashamed to say I had the best carne asada fries last weekend, and it was NOT in San Diego. 

There are a lot of taco shops in Chandler. Apparently, word is they are not very good, except for Los Favoritos. I scoffed. My San-Diego-friends-now-residing-in-AZ kept trying to convince me how good it was. I scoffed again. HA! Finally, I decided to go, just to compare. What a snob.

Looks like every other taco shop I've been to, maybe a little cleaner. Carne Asada fries is not on the menu, so you have to ask for it. I opened up that styrofoam box, and it was pretty. No, really. I haven't had carne asada fries that good...ever...so far...

Recommendations:
Chicken rolled tacos, quesadilla, pretty much carne asada anything."}
{"text":"Pretty decent fast food Mexican. Has a filebertos feel just with less \"I might die if I eat it\" like you would get from other chains. Breakfast burritos are a winner every time. The carne Asada burrito is money as well. They have Mexican Coke and jorittos as well to round out a great experience."}
{"text":"I love the food here and the staff is very friendly!! I have tried the conga the green chile, the tacos! All leave you feeling full and satisfied! The flavored are authentic and pure! If you have a chance please visit the Tempe and Chandler locations!"}
{"text":"Los Favoritos is outstanding for a casual fast food mexican restaurant.  They have the best ground beef ever! My family and friends all love their food, sit down restaurant quality food without the high prices! Love it!"}
{"text":"Breakfast burritos are huge/good. Only issue is the restaurant is very cold. Asked if they could raise the temperature to the folks behind the counter. Later I saw the same person and asked if the manager raised it. She said Roberto laughed and said its the old people who complain. This was a Sunday morning in February 2018. That same person said she came in, in that morning and the temp was 56 degrees.  This problem also occurs in the summer time."}
{"text":"My go to restaurant! Delicious, affordable food. I bring all my ladies here to wine and dine them ;)"}
{"text":"Mmmmm....Los Favs....Their breakfast burritos are always on point and so is their Carne Asada which are my personal favorite in the state so far compared to (Fillbertso) Filly bs,and rubias in tempe on mill and southern? i think that's the name of the other spot. Favs always get it right though for the most part. Lately they have been overcooking the french fries but it is still amazing regardless.  Their burritos seem pretty small to me compared to taqueira me casita or whatever on warner and dobson but their california burrito is my quick i don't really know what i want so i'm gonna choose this option. Like i said, i usually get the carne asada fries or the breakfast burrito because you can never go wrong with either selection.
       I seriously have been thinking about it all night and i am always more than excited to go every time. I am a typical foodie so excuse the excitement as i text as i am preparing for my day of work and stop for my breakfast burrito along the way ;) I once ordered rolled chicken tacos and it was extremely bland and just meh. I wanted to throw it away after i ate one out of three. But my friend made me pack it up. So not only did i end up wasting my food but i wasted a container. i cannot force down food just because that is definitely not my style to say the least.
       Living in Arizona you will find hit or miss places, i have heard a lot of people say this is just as disgusting as Filly B's but i beg to differ. Filly b's is just beyond nasty and my stomach always hurts after eating their overly salty carne asada fries. gross. okay back to Favs. I don't necessarily care for the fact that they charge you extra for sour cream,cheese, etc etc etc in your burrito. I am spoiled from the mexican spot down the street on warner and dobson because they load your burrito in front of your face with two scoops of rice, beans, and 2-4 scoops of meat depending on what meat and if u ask for half and half. and let you add in sour cream cheese and whatever else for free. the burrito looks as though its the size of some buff guys bicep. HONESTLY. Favs burritos are half the size of a regular sized girls forearm for 4 dollars compared to 6. their prices on breakfast burritos and carne asada fries are always in my budget though.


Los Favs Here I Come!!! :D"}
{"text":"So great full we have a good Mexican restaurant close home. The carne adobada is the greatest. Thanks for making it happen"}
{"text":"I'd give this a 5 but I think we should all leave room for improvement. 

I moved here from CA and was looking for a mom/pop type place for good Mexican food. I found this on Yelp and have to say I am really happy with what I've had here. First I had a Breakfast Burrito (Chorizo) and then added sour cream. Perfect! 

Next time I was in for dinner I tried their Chile Verde burrito. I had them add beans. Wow...really really good! Hit the spot! 

I think I found my new \"go-to\" favorite!"}
{"text":"I love Los Favs! They have amazing tacos and the flavor is good. My go-to spot!  They'd have a pretty large menu. Good for breakfast or just a quick bite to eat. Both their green and red sauces also taste pretty good."}
{"text":"California carne asada is good. Ain't no olive garden but the horchata is yummins and it is healthy and the burritos give you super powers."}
{"text":"The food is phenomenal and the sauces are magic. Words can't describe. Just go and eat. 

I've eaten here more than any other restaurant. This place carries with it more memories then I can count. My bros and I have spent hours upon hours sitting in this restaurant talking about futures, relationships, and lives. This place is more than a restaurant. It's a place where relationships are built. 

Just go and eat."}
{"text":"My review on the Burrito de Camarones (Shrimp burrito): They have comparable soft tortillas as Chipotle does (I swear the best part of their burritos). It's the right amount of doughiness and you can feel the flour traces on your fingers after setting it back down (if you can resist). The first bite is always the most amazing, assuming you get in their deep enough. This burrito reminds me of a shrimp paella -- the rice sits in this amazing sauce -- almost like a rice soup with chopped cilantro, tomatoes and chiles. Everything is blended together perfectly with the succulent shrimp, held together in a bowl made of flour. It is the ultimate bliss.

{"text":"5/5 for bacon breakfast burrito
2/5 for the location/cleanliness
3/5 for service

This is the average divey, Mexican joint. Tastiest breakfast burrito I've ever had. I went to high school around here, and this was the place I went when I was craving a salty, delicious burrito. My favorite is the bacon breakfast burrito. It has potato, egg, and bacon in it. Very simple, but they do it deliciously, and cheaply.

I've tried other things from there as well, but when I go back, I usually just get that breakfast burrito.

Don't expect anything upscale."}
{"text":"This is my go-to fast burrito place. They have excellent breakfast burritos, especially when you ask for extra potatoes or crispy potatoes, but my favorite is the Carne Asada California burrito. I cannot count how many times that I've had this burrito. Sure it's not a gourmet place but for fast food, its excellent and I can't get enough of it! Plus they are always extra friendly and they always know my order as soon as I walk in the door :)

Carne Asada California with crispy potatoes please!"}
{"text":"I visited twice in two days.  First day I had two tacos: one carnitas, one asada.  Both were very tasty, salted well, both had a little guac, onions, cilantro - the usual.  Next day, had an asada burrito.  It was fairly basic, kinda like the taco the day before, but, unlike most burritos these days, this one was 80% meat, 20% everything else.  I am good with these proportions.

Ya feel me?"}
{"text":"We used to love this place and will often ride bikes here with our 2 kids when weather is nice and order to go. Sadly, after last nights visit for a simple bean burrito, we will no longer support this location. 

Asked for a bean burrito with \"just a little bit of cheese\". I wish I was able to capture a picture because it was kids size despite the tortilla being gigantic. It was filled with like 60% cheese, 40% bean and then the tortilla was over folded. I basically just had to rip half the tortilla off because it alone was not worth eating, and then once I bit into the burro it was just a bite of cheese half melted mess, no bean until bite 3. Gross.

This ONE burrito is all ordered, since I'm sick at the moment and my husband was trying to be nice and get me the one thing I felt I could eat. I couldn't even finish the darn freezer sized burrito. 

Then as I'm eating my husband told me how there was a family of 6 that came in after him and they got their food to go before him. Seriously?! That is not cool. We have had other bad experiences and just shrugged it off but I think this might have to be our last experience here. Poor service to friendly, easy to please people, is one thing, having it happen every other time you seem to go is a bit much. Such a shame."}
{"text":"The food here is the bomb.  I mix up the rice and beans.  Then I dump red sauce on all of it.  Then I scoop the mixture onto my california carne asada burrito or my beef tacos.  Then I chug some horchata.  EXQUISITE!!!"}
{"text":"Good food on the fly~ not good for the dieta 
The staff was super friendly, ultra casual dining environment. Tucked in the center~ you'll need to keep your eyes peeled for this little gem"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in all of America hands down! It's cheap, consistent and reliable. This has become a long time comfort food for my wife and I."}
{"text":"Food is always very good.  Prices are really a great value.  So why no 5 stars?  They can rarely get your order right and NEVER get it right over the phone!  There is always a wait because the good food and prices so the last 3 times my wife and I ordered we called the order in.  Simple order: 2 Bacon, Egg and Cheese Burritos with no Potatoes.  Never once did we get Bacon and had other things added to them.  The staff is not apologetic and actually makes you think you incorrectly called in what you wanted.  If your willing to take what they serve you stop on in it is really all good, If you want what you ordered drive the extra 2 miles to Elmers!"}
{"text":"My friend suggested Los Favoritos and since we were in the area, I was intrigued. Upon entering there, the place wasn't very busy, but I assume that most of their business happens after people get off of work since they're open until 12am.

They have many booths for you to sit at, and it's not cramped at all. It's a very open area with a high ceiling and light coming in from all sides from the large windows. Across the way sits Starbucks, so if you want a nice ritzy coffee to accompany your Mexican food, you can head over there for a sweet treat.

I ordered the Cheese Enchilada and Beef Taco combo, it took some time for our orders to come out (aside from us there, there were about two other people there, but they were already eating), after we got our orders, we picked up the red salsa and left.

The food, ehh... it was good, but it reminded me of the other Mexican food joints around here. The Beef Taco is shredded beef, which was good (to me). The cheesy enchilada was cheesy and yummy, but for the price that was paid I expected two enchilada's, not one. The rice was ok, nothing great, I've had my share of Mexican fried rice and haven't found one that I have yet to like (except my fathers). Refried beans were good, but tasted like they came from a can. But like I said before, it tasted like the other restaurants.

I would not mind eating here again, they have a variety of things to eat and try, so maybe next time I will try something else!"}
{"text":"Well, on the way to this location we called and asked the girl who answered the phone which corner of Cooper and Ray they were on and she said she didn't know, hmmm (SE corner BTW). When we walked in there was a very strong cleaning chemical odor coming from the propped open bathroom. The decor is very stark and the service less than enthusiastic.   There is a handwritten sign by the \"salsa bar\" threatening prosecution of any apprehended hot sauce thieves, you are warned! Food wasn't terrible, just not very good.  Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Excellent Service. The chorizo was delicious and cooked perfect. Beans and rice were delicious"}
{"text":"It's not fancy, but they have great food.  Yes, their menu is similar to other \"chain Mexican\" food places, but in general they just do it better. For best effect, come here when you have a hang over."}
{"text":"Awesome carne asada! I love my late night munchies, this one defeated me though. I just couldn't finish the monster burrito. The red salsa was much more spicy than I thought it would be."}
{"text":"I love Los Favoritos, but this is my least favorite location. Food is great, serive is fast, restaurant is clean and the staff is nice. I like to come here on my lunch breaks, I drive about 10-15 min to get here and twice now the restaurant has been closed. Very frustrating. The first time was about a month ago, the sign on the door said \"Closed for cleaning \" , which I don't get because it's a brand new restaurant, and also, why not clean after business hours ? The second time was today , the sign said \"Closed for remodeling\". What could they possibly be remodeling ? They just opened ! And again, why not do this after business hours ? I'm sick of driving here for the doors to be closed at lunch time !"}
{"text":"Best ham breakfast burritos ever....and the cooks at this location specifically know how to make them right!!! Any other location you go to it's a hit or miss, but most of the time a miss. Oh and it's only like 4 bucks for the breakfast burrito! So you get your money's worth"}
{"text":"I love this place. Best breakfast burritos they are amazing. Salsa is hot and spicy, just the way I like it. We frequent this place every weekend morning. Service is reasonable, prices good. Food always warm and delicious. Fairly clean restaurant. Overall satified."}
{"text":"Local eatery that makes for a good belly filler if you've got no other plans.  Your standard americanized mexican style food to quench your 2 AM drunken fix."}
{"text":"This place can be quite good, but it's hit and miss.  I think the breakfast burritos and California burrito are the main attractions.  Chimichanga and tacos aren't anything special.  The rice and beans are average.  Again, go for the burritos!  They are definitely superior to Filibertos.  

Tip: ask for the bottled salsas when you pick up your food--they have red and green and both are really good."}
{"text":"I  Los Favs! Happy to see it next to BR Coffee. One stop complex for quick breakfast burrito meet ups. Same great food, service, price and ambience. Brand new shop too! Nice and clean. Can't go wrong. I'll be back!"}

{"text":"Pretty good. Not greasy at all, the carne asada meat didn't have any strange gristle, the dining room was clean with good upkeep, and the to-go red sauce is spicy and flavorful without burning off your tastebuds."}
{"text":"They never take the time to make sure the order is right. So when you take it to go there's always something missing. When you call it's like oh ok that's it. Gave them a second chance never again. Better service up front."}
{"text":"Cheap Mexican food that hits the spot! Try the tamales or chili relleno!"}
{"text":"Love this place - good food, service and price!! 

The breakfast burritos are awesome! The Chicken California Burrito is great! Same with the Taco Salad with Chicken. Haven't tried one thing I don't like. 

Used to go there 2-3 times a week until I moved. Now it's a wonderful treat when I visit PHX."}
{"text":"2 stars: for the breakfast burrito
0 stars: for their lack of customer service
0 stars: for their lack of cleanliness

Their food is great, IF they give you what you ordered. There have been too many times to count where we have ordered food and have not received what we asked for. The most recent occasion was today. We order one bacon and one sausage breakfast burrito. We received a sausage and some other kind of meat-burrito that neither of us could identify. When talking to the workers about the incorrect order, they denied to give us the correct burrito. Yes, my fiancé had eaten half (I asked him to try to stomach through it so that I could relax since I had jaw surgery that day). When I found out it was making him feel sick I called immediately. After explaining how upset and frustrated we were they told us had he taken one bite and given up then they would have given him the burrito, the CORRECT burrito, but because we are not the family that eats a bite an throws things away we had to argue to get the correct burrito. After much complication, the only way we would get the correct burrito would be to bring in the other half of the burrito that was not eaten. I don't understand why there needed to be arguments and disrespectful talk coming from the employees. We have look past the MANY mistakes in the past, but I wasn't really in the mood to deal with accepting another mistake today."}
{"text":"WHY IS IT SO UNCOMFORTABLY QUIET IN HERE? 

I am obsessed with this place and come here once a week at least! The food rocks and the service is great. 

Buuut... It is so awkwardly silent! There is no music and no ambiance whatsoever! Turn up the jams Los Favs!"}
{"text":"I always judge a place like this by its beans. They are perfect, some places use too much or too little salt; theirs are always on point. Beans are very dear to my heart. Their red hot sauce is also key."}
{"text":"This is the staple of breakfast foods. They offer everything that any other Mexican place offers... horchata, chorizo, machaca... But they have THE BEST breakfast burritos!"}
{"text":"I generally wouldn't review a takeout joint, but an experience this past Sunday just blew me away. Los Favs has long been our go-to place for Mexican food in a hurry. Their breakfast burros are the best around.

We were headed out for a day trip on Sunday morning; left the house around 5:35. We weren't counting on Los Favs to be open, but the light was on and it looked like the open sign was in the window as we approached the corner, so we pulled in. As we parked out front, we could see they were prepping for their morning, but still closed. 

With a sigh, we resigned ourselves to egg McMuffins, and I shifted into reverse, but before I could back out, one of the guys hustled out of the kitchen  to unlock the door and flip the sign from \"Closed\" to \"Open.\" He waved us inside, they whipped up an awesome chorizo burro in minutes and off we went. THAT is service!"}
{"text":"Been there 3 times and it has been excellent every time. 

Bean burrito. Carne asada. Just chips and dip.... everything is awesome!"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!!!
I ordered the Carne Asada French Fries and they were delicious and there was plenty of it (huge portion). Pricing is extremely fair!!!
The seating area is SUPER clean, and the food was made very fast!!!"}
{"text":"I had the beef taco and cheese enchilada combo with beans and rice. The beans and rice were pretty standard. The cheese enchilada was quite cheesy and tasty. The beef taco was just OK, but that's partly my fault. I was expecting ground beef, but you have to specifically ask for it, so the next time I will go in I'll try that."}
{"text":"Alert: i've literally seen a roach crawl out of the booths:( 

Pros:
1. Employees make the food how you like! Im a picky eater and they made it my way every time.
2. The food is very food for an Mexican chain.
3. Variety of  stuff on the menu just like California^^

Cons:
1. The store is dirty the front, back, and bathroom. Like i said...a roach


Things to get:
SHRIMP BURRITO! 
chimichanga plate"}
{"text":"Ordered 3 asada tacos and fries. Cost me $25. They charged $1 per taco for each of cheese, cilantro and onions. That is $3 per taco for those cheap ingredients. Then they forgot the pico which should have come on it but tell me to drive back up there with the tacos to show them to get that $3 refunded. So now I'm supposed to use more gas and oh now...have cold tacos and fries to have them refund me for what I did not receive and on top of that they didn't taste that great. Will never eat there again...just a bad experience all the way around."}
{"text":"Decent little taco stand sort of restaurant. The burrito that I had was good, nothing to shout about, but a solid breakfast burrito. The nice thing about it was that you can order breakfast foods all day and it still tasted good.

Mine came out pretty quick, but my friend's burrito was quite long in arriving. They have some good combination burritos that aren't significantly more expensive like the ones you might try to get at other places. I would visit again to get a second opinion of the place."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed los favs for quite some time. They make a super breakfast burrito that is great . Add some jalepenos for extreme spiciness. I have tried it in different variations, one we have made up is adding nacho cheese to the inside its good. They are always very nice and make the food just how you want it. Open til 2am makes it very convenient . The Los favs burrito is great as well. Anytime I've been in it has not been dirty rather the opposite with kind workers behind the counter. Now delivering with doordash ."}
{"text":"I come here EVERY week, sometimes even twice a week because it's delicious and it is close to my work. I always order the same thing (carne asada with no guac) and always see the same people working there. 

Today, I went in as usual and ordered. As I sat to wait, I noticed my receipt said no pico instead of no guac. So I asked them if they could change it. They lady said they had already made it and said word-for-word, \"Since you ordered it wrong, it's not our fault and we don't have to make you another one.\" I did not order it wrong, and regardless, she should be more willing to please someone who visits on a regular basis. This is NOT good customer service by any means, especially considering she knows I come there all the time. 

I am very disappointed because now I have spent 6$ on a burrito that I'm not going to eat. This is my second mishap with two different locations, and I'm honestly just considering never coming to any Los Favs ever again. They used to be great with their loyal customers, but now it seems like they're just careless."}

{"text":"Always our \"Favoritos\", California Burritos, Super Nachos, #15 Chimi Plate, so many great items! The Carne Asada, and Fish Tacos are fantastic as well... most of all.... clean restrooms!!"}
{"text":"Had to try this place again because we were very close by and everyone I was with was really craving a breafast burrito. I saw that there were a fair amount of customers inside - which is most always a good sign.  

Ordered 4 breakfast burritos - all pretty good and prices were lower than Filibertos.  The service was much better than my last time visiting - professional, accurate and quick.  Yey!  Not my favorite Mexican fast food but in a pinch and close by, we would definitely stop by again."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times and they do not disappoint. Their breakfast burritos are very good and the sauce they give you is amazing.

{"text":"This is our local neighborhood go to place.   Its fast food, take out folks, not A fancy sit down with margaritas. So don't whine when you don't have table cloths and waiters in tuxedos.   The place is  sparkling clean.   Fast take out with big portions.  Yummy, really good fresh food.  Ten years and never an issue.  Tacos, Burritos and combo plates.   We have had it all. My favorite is the californina carne asada.  Make sure you get guac and carrots on the side.   If you have never ordered the pickled carrots and jalapenos then you are really missing the boat!!  Prices are good considering what you get. You can find cheaper but can deal with what comes with it.  Also their breakfast burritos are a great early start for weekends."}
{"text":"Im a big fan of the carne asada fries and this place by far does have the best ones in town. All becuz of how the meat is well seasoned and grilled. I've tried several places around my own area in phx and this place beat them all...wow! I only came for  lunch and decided to give it a try."}

{"text":"Go somewhere else. Really bad service and mediocre food. I don't understand crappy rude service. Why? We pay your bills. Really snarky counter girl really got under my skin. Ordered my food and no eye contact or a thank you.  Gave her my corporate credit card to pay and she snaps back its declined. I told her it was impossible as there's 12 thousand in there and asked her to run it again. She literally rolled her eyes at me. No really she rolled her eyes at me like I'm some deadbeat who can't pay for a 6 dollar burro. Of course it went through. No thanks or eye contact again. Come to get my food she walked away without asking me if I needed anything. Had to wait and ask for my soda cup. She pours me a solo cup of water without ice and walks away. Have to wait for her to come back and ask for my cup again. She shoots me the stink eye and says she doesn't remember charging me for a drink. Brings me a small cup when my receipt says MD Soda $1.65. Again she lays out a snarky comment saying nearly under her breath that she hadn't charged me for the soda and now I'm annoyed further from her remarks inferring I'm a scammer and looked right in her eye and said You know what. ..you did charge me. Had a carne asada burro with beans no rice. Bland food. Everything needs salt. No love in this food at all."}
{"text":"Basically this place is the same as Filibertos, we got the chimichanga and it was delicious. I don't taste much of a difference from many other Mexican restaurants I've been too but it was good!"}
{"text":"I love Los Favs for their breakfast burritos. For me it's their signature item to get. The guy in the sombrero painted on the front glass windows even says \"Try a breakfast burrito!\" at this location. 

When we walked in, I gotta admit I was impressed. This is the fanciest looking Los Favoritos I've been in so far. The decor is modern and clean cut, none of that hole in the wall feel. It was also spacious with nice seating unlike others I've been to such as the one in Tempe. 

I went with my all time favorite here, the bacon breakfast burrito. Unfortunately, it had all the heft of a Los Favs breakfast burrito but none of the soul. While I appreciate that they put large chunks of bacon in the burrito, the bacon itself was pretty chewy. The potatoes were mushy too so overall there wasn't that great texture difference with crispy bacon and lightly crisp potatoes with gooey cheese and soft scrambled eggs that I love in your typical Los Favs experience. 

I also had a bite of the #8, the chorizo breakfast combo. It was also a hefty plate but all I could taste was egg and it didn't seem like there was a lot of chorizo mixed into it. 

Sadly, I wasn't too impressed with their breakfast items but I'll go back to see if their regular menu is any better."}
{"text":"The food is cheaper than Filibertos and the quality of the tortillas is better. The beans are most delicious here compared to Filibertos. The only bad thing I have to say is that is it pretty annoying that they close and lock the doors earlier than their hours of business listed on the door."}
{"text":"The food is great, but every time I come I seriously wait at least 15 min for my food. That's way too long. I don't know why it takes so much time to throw some beans and cheese into a tortilla, fold it up, and throw it in a bag."}
{"text":"The machaca burrito is sooooo delish! I added pico cooked in and subtracted the bell peppers. I definitely recommend getting it with the potatoes. You're welcome :)"}
{"text":"Update: i got food poisoning from this place. About 6 hours later i had my face planted in the toilet. Buyer beware.  



1st the food is good for the price, was surprised. Service on the other hand sucks. It may have been an honest mistake but I got short changed $10 on my order, cashier corrected the situation but you definitely want to keep an eye on them. 

Here is the real issue, they need to focus on the customers in the store not the phone. One girl working the register and no one working the orders that were ready so the orders were piling up including customers 5 deep standing in line. The phone was more important. Once she did get to the orders she was handing them out in reverse order so you could see the frustration from customers who were waiting longer, including myself. 

I am certain that if this store survives it will be on the food and prices only because customer service is the pits."}
{"text":"Has the best bacon breakfast burrito around! Especially at this specific location, I've been to other locations and it just didn't taste the same, the people are very kind and friendly every time I go in. One problem I always have is getting there while they are closed because they close to early on some days but hey it's still worth it at the times I do go!"}
{"text":"Well...I had a weird time here. My friends highly suggested Los Favs so I stopped in for a quick meal. I had questions about the menu (mostly just to clarify if one of the items had meat in it) and the cashier lady was very rude about it. My friend and I stepped to the side to let other people order and she essentially yelled at us to figure out what we wanted. It was just super weird. The food was ok but the experience was off putting and not friendly for someone new to the menu."}
{"text":"I went once the day i moved to Arizona. Small place. I had the fish taco and i have to say it was well above average compared to other fast food places, and measured up to many higher priced restaurants too. I would and will go back."}
{"text":"My shrimp burrito is taking an entire lunch break to cool down! Try the crane asada California burrito and mind-blowing bean breakfast burrito."}
{"text":"After promising me In-N-Out, my cousin surprised me with a walk to Los Favoritos. He's a regular there and called in our order while we strolled to the restaurant.

The staff totally treated my cousin like a pal, joking with him and teaching us a bit of Spanish. 

We had the California carne asada and regular carne asada. The former had cheese in the rolled tortilla and French fries in the the burrito. The latter had just the right amount of guac and meat. 

One of my typical complaints about carne asada is most restaurants make it too salty. Los Favoritos' meat is perfectly seasoned and fresh. 

The burritos aren't huge, but they do the trick. And the tortilla is chewy and delicious. Refills are free, and Los Favoritos carries two types of hot sauce in squeezy bottles -- just the way I like it."}
{"text":"Red and green salsas only and they are NOT NEARLY spicy enough.

Wish they had a salsa bar.

Open late which is nice.

Food is just OK."}
{"text":"Wanted to give this place another try and again they failed me. I ordered a soft flour carne asada taco and got a soft corn taco instead and I actually really hate the soft corn tortillas. I also got chips and guacamole. If you love guacamole and are a snob about it like me don't get their guacamole. It's some sort of bland, cheap green stuff. And then they throw raw shredded cheese on it... Ugh. Sorry Someburros, I should have listened to my guy and drove over to you instead. Waste of money. Oooh and that's another thing!! A small drink, a taco and chips and guacamole was $12!!!! Rip off."}
{"text":"I've grown up going to Cooper and ray location in chandler and it was SLOW. Like call in 15 minutes ahead of time and still wait another 15 minutes before picking up two breakfast burritos slow. Then I moved a little more east and found this Los and it's FAST and amazing!!! I don't want other people to know about It because it might get backed up like the chandler one but I've been here probably 8x in the last two months and he good has always been amazing and the wait is low and staff is nice :)"}
{"text":"Love the shredded beef tacos here! Place can get crowded but I usually find the service to be fast. I would recommend avoiding the lunch hour."}
{"text":"I would tongue kiss this building if this building had a tongue.. the food here is soooo goood.. hard nipples under a wet tshirt type of good... their carne asada fries makes you wanna throat punch your tax account for not putting it down as a write off on your taxes, due to the amount of money you spend here on this delicious food... im getting a half chub just thinking of those fries..... im fat."}
{"text":"The past few times I have been here they have screwed up my order. The first time I asked for a shrimp burrito with no green salsa it came out with it, the second time asked for the same thing and got a fish burrito, and this past time asked for the same thing and got a shrimp taco. Which was disgusting. The service has gone down so much here. They are always rude to me when I go in and never can seem to get my order right. Would recommend going somewhere else if you would like your order to come out correct."}
{"text":"Food is always fresh. Tried their taquitos, green chili, red chili, and carne asada all great! Their guacamole is also addicting!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite of all the locations. They always make the best breakfast burritos, the dining room is always clean, and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"This wasn't my first visit here, third time to be exact. I keep craving the carne asada...I love the fact that it's not greasy. The first time my husband and I came here he ordered a quesadilla and it was LOADED with onions, he wasn't even able to finish eating it. But now that we've come back several times we know what to expect and know what to stay away from. Other than that, the food here is great. Very authentic!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the better burrito taco Mexican food places. I'm always happy with the service and the food. A great portions"}
{"text":"First time visiting. Solid Mexican food!  Carne asada was well seasoned and the beef tacos were not greasy. Retried beans had good flavor. The service was friendly!  Found a new spot for good Mexican food"}
{"text":"First off, place was very clean. The cashier was a young girl and she was nice. They are also open pretty late 0200 i think and early morning (0600) if that's your thing

Now the food, its late night coming home after partying all night kind of Mexican food and you just want something to eat that's not a cheeseburger. Reminds me of Filibertos, LosBetos, JulioBetos or any other Betos out there. I'm hispanic and wouldn't eat there unless......(read above)

They also serve the food on styrofoam plates and boxes. Which isn't bad unless the food is hot. See my pic. Styrofoam is NOT meant for hot items, my daughters plate had a hole from the hot food. 

I really wish this place was better, would be nice to have some real authentic Mexican food open early and late close to home. Looks like ill be waiting longer for one to open."}
{"text":"If you're jones'en for a breakfast buritto, you'll be hard pressed to find a better one anywhere else in the east valley. What this place lacks in ambiance, they more than make up in taste, selection and value"}
{"text":"Aweful service. Look, I get that it's a cheap fast food style restaurant. But that shouldn't excuse poor service. I don't expect cheers when I walk in the door, or even a \"hello\" really, but they sometimes flat out ignore you! Once, I went there to pick up a quick dinner for my girlfriend and I. I stood there while the girl working mopped the floor and ignored me. Of course I understood she had a job to do, but when I was younger and had jobs like that, I was always required to at least acknowledge a customer and then usually stop what I was doing to assist that customer. You know? Anyway, aside from their aweful service they constantly got our order wrong or left things out all together. The ONLY reason I kept going there was my girlfriend insisted she didn't know any other place to get decent Mexican food aside from a sit down restaurant. I will say I did like the \"Chili Rojo Burro\" and shredded beef tacos though...."}
{"text":"Their breakfast burritos are the best I have ever had. These are authentic and their hot sauce is delicious. Their carne asada burritos and cane asada quesadillas are also a couple of my favorites. Staff are always friendly and pretty quick, though you can also call ahead for quicker food. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times and have decided the chorizo burro is the way to go. The tortillas tastes homemade and the chorizo is good and spicy. I prefer my burro without the potatoes which sometimes will make the egg to chorizo ratio a bit on the heavy side with chorizo. For lunch, I've had a red chile and cheese enchiladas. I didn't care for the enchilada sauce or the red chile. They keep their salsa at the counter in a tub of ice. In my opinion leave it there it's only so-so."}
{"text":"I've only been to this location twice but the man at the register was extremely nice. He even asked how my externship was going which no one ever cares about (easy to please maybe but whatever.) The food has been great both times and the red sauce is spicy which I love! Some places (filib's) are not spicy at all!"}
{"text":"I eat here probably 4 times a week, good price and always excellent. Dining room and restrooms are always clean, cashier is always friendly, and the green sauce is delicious enough for anything."}
{"text":"A couple girls from work get takeout from Los Favoritos multiple times a week. I was invited in on one of their lunches one Saturday and have been hooked since. Everyone is always very friendly and the food is always delicious. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Pretty good for a decent price.  The rolled taco plate was the special and it was only $4.50.  They came with a topping of quacamole and cheese and they were quite good.  The quesadilla my daughter had was huge and full of nicely melted cheese.  She loved it but then you really can't go too wrong with a quesadilla.  The place was fairly busy with about 5 tables occupied.  It could have been just a bit cleaner in terms of the floor and tables but it was not bad.  They may have just had a rush and not had the chance to come out and clean.  I'll give them benifit of the doubt on that one.  

I will go back and try more items on the menu.  They have specials every day and a fairly vaired menu.  It's located in a strip mall next to Starbucks and just down the way is Angel Sweet for dessert.  Overall it was decent."}
{"text":"Amazing food, have never been disappointed! This place is way better than Filibertos, which I used to love! The prices are also reasonable! So happy this is right around the corner from me!"}
{"text":"I think the only time I ever make it in here is for breakfast and that's strictly to get a breakfast burritos.  $5-6 for a breakfast burrito may seem a bit on the high side but overall it is one of the best on the go, filling burritos you can get. 

One of the things I enjoy is the fact that it's not overstuffed falling apart... instead it's rolled up nice and tight & easy to handle. 

I always get a bacon, egg, cheese and potato or I'll mix it up and have the sausage. If I want a change up, I'll go with the Machaca (no potatoes) 

Only downside is the wait.... sometimes it can be 10-15 mins when busy but it feels a lot longer."}
{"text":"Got the chimichanga and was not impressed with it. Hardly any meat, but they like to put in a lot go onions, peppers and tomatoes. Their staff is always rude too. Doesn't matter which location you go to."}
{"text":"I've only been here twice both times got a carne asada burrito with rice and beans. The burrito is pretty big too and really good.."}
{"text":"Substandard food quality and on same level when compared to Filibertos, but slightly better. Menu items hit the spot when hunger strikes nevertheless"}
{"text":"Been going to this particular Los Favoritos for over a year now. Never had an issue. Service has always been good, food always good. But today the experience left me scratching my head and leaving so angry I could not see straight.  I ordered my 5year old grandson chicken nuggets with fries. He loves their nuggets. But tonight he only took a bite of the nuggets and said he didn't want them because they tasted \"ugly\". Well, not knowing what \"ugly\" tastes like, I took a bite to see. The nuggets were so salty it's no wonder he wouldn't eat them. I took the order of nuggets up to the front. I explained that there was so much salt he wouldn't eat them. I told her I took a bite, as well as his dad and they were way too salty to eat. She proceeded to tell me they don't add salt to the nuggets. Ok that's fine, but this order has salt, so, did they put salt on nuggets when salting the fries underneath? Someone else at the counter tells me, \"well we don't put salt on them\" Gee seriously, am I lying just to waste my time arguing about salt on nuggets! omg. This is the kicker \"Well what do you want us to do?\" All i'm thinking at this point is I have a hungry 5 year old and I am going to have to go somewhere else and buy more food. I told them to get one and try it, I told them to look at them and you will clearly see SALT on them. no apology, nothing, then after making me feel like a lying fool, they can't even make it clear whether they will or won't make him some UNSALTED nuggets. I won't be going back to this place! I walked out so angry, walked back in to make sure I knew who to speak with to make a complaint, I just wasted time and money so i'm not happy. Then looks at me and said \"oh heres the nuggets\" Um so when did anyone tell me they were making me more? I just told her to forget it. I Had to take my grandson somewhere else and wait for more food. Wow, it could have taken them 1 minute to fix this issue, there would be no 1 star review on yelp and a return customer. So there is my 2 cents and my advice coming from my 25 years of customer service! For goodness sakes, apologize, take the salted nuggets and offer another batch and make sure no one adds salt to them. Hand them over to a happy waiting customer. That could have been so easy. Grandson is fed and happy, grandma is wasting her time writing this review. ugh"}
{"text":"No bueno. torta was bland,service bland,worst gaucamole ever!!!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch with my family on a Saturday afternoon. The place was very clean, and you order at the front. This was my first time at one of these franchises. We enjoyed our food. My daughter got a quesadilla with tons of cheese! When I went to fill the horchata, the lever got stuck and it went everywhere. LOL! We will be back for more. Don't know why we waited so long to try this place out. By the way, I did have the vegetarian burrito and it was very good.  My only complaint is that their hot sauce is weak."}
{"text":"Best chorizo and carne asada around. Forget filibertos or any of his cousins. Los Favoritos is the bomb."}
{"text":"The food at Los favs used to be so good! I've been coming here for the last 6 years and I'm so disappointed in how they have gone downhill. There is a woman who works behind the counter here who is so rude. She has a constant scowl on her face no matter how nice you are to her. Tonight we went to Los favs to give it another shot (as it has been a while due to the bad attitudes) and I was so disgusted! I was 1/2 way through my favorite chorizo breakfast burrito and I took a bite and found a large piece of hair. I immediately felt sick to my stomach and stopped eating. I noticed that most of the people there wear hair nets so I can only think to contribute it to the 3 construction workers who were doing repairs to the ceiling over the food prep stations. So disappointed and sad that the level of service and food has become so subpar. They can redecorate all they want but you can't hide a bad restaurant with a coat of paint."}
{"text":"I live near Los Fav's and my family and I are frequent customers.  My kids love it and I love the price.  The breakfast burritos are pretty salty, and I don't care for any pork they serve, but overall it's a great place with a large menu to accommodate everyone."}
{"text":"Haven't visited in a while but still five stars. Food is made fresh and prepared extremely well. Food of course is  delicious. Cooks get orders out quickly and the cashier is always on her game. They've never ever messed up my order here. My favorite items here are the breakfast burritos: Bacon, sausage, chorizo. They're also very accommodating here. I add beans and ham to my chorizo breakfast burrito and ham to my California Carne Asada burrito. Extra charge but still affordable."}
{"text":"Good food, decent location and below average service. Cashier could've been friendlier. She was rude. As far as the food is concerned, the California and Chorizo breakfast burritos are my favorite. I like to add beans and bacon to them. Both red and green sauces are tasty but I prefer green if I had to choose. For drink options, they sell Mexican Coca-Cola, Bottled Sangria, and Pepsi products ."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying they have good breakfast burritos. But I haven't found anything else I would recommend. Tacos were massively overcooked and the shredded beef was flavorless and dry. the stuffed sopas with ground beef were also dry and flavorless. Cheese enchiladas were served cold- so the cheese didn't melt. Will go back for breakfast though."}
{"text":"Food is good, but super slow!  They need someone to manage front of house.  Terrible service skills, lack any type of customer service skills: greet, smile, apologize for waiting for a breakfast burrito that took 25 minutes to make, etc. etc.  Good food but HORRIBLE slow service."}
{"text":"This place was OUTSTANDING!  I've lived in the same place almost two years and I see this place PACKED all the time but haven't eaten there til this weekend!  Breakfast Burritos all come with Potato Egg and Cheese and they are sooooooo good!  Staff was very friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"Sigh.  The taco plate was skimpy and bland.  I don't mind getting a small portion, but don't charge me $8.21 for it.

Get ready to drench your flavor-challenged tacos in hot sauce.  Maybe try a burrito instead?

One word: disappointing."}
{"text":"Just ate here. Had the 2 carne asada Tacos with rice and beans. Very fresh and full of good flavor. Rice and beans are typical nothing special."}
{"text":"My two boys love this place, and it's close to home, so we eat here at least twice per month. The food is better than most of the places around us including the more expensive table service joints. The décor is awful, but that's ok... it's a mom and pop Mexican restaurant. They seem to have new cashiers quite often but they always get my order correct. The side door cannot be opened from the outside so if you sit on the patio you have to walk around to the front and re-enter to get drink refills and toss your garbage. That's a pain in the azz when it's busy. The employees are nice and helpful. Good place!"}
{"text":"Los Favoritos is one of mis favoritos.

It's not gourmet, it doesn't pretend to be, and for that you must love it. It's cheap, fast Mexican food. In some of the best tortillas I've ever had anywhere. I'd buy the tortillas and eat them warm all by themselves.

For me, Los Favs is a breakfast haunt. They make a killer breakfast burrito with your choice of chorizo, ham, sausage, bacon, or some combination thereof. Add to that scrambled eggs, potatoes, cheddar cheese, and I'm pretty sure butter. It will clog your arteries and shave years off your life, but dammit, it's a hell of a breakfast.

Pro Tip: It's half of Chandler's breakfast haunt, too, so come prepared to stand around for a while in the mornings.  They crank out the burritos in turbo, but they've only got two (usually one) registers and so many employees.

They're also open late if you've got an evening craving for some Mexican."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of Los Favs. As authentic Mexican you can find in Chandler and at an affordable price. It's a great late night spot to eat as well. Chorizo and California burritos are my favorite!"}
{"text":"This is definitely not low fat food but it is really delicious and inexpensive fresh Mexican food.   My husband hearts the breakfast burritos, and I like the California chicken Burrito."}
{"text":"In town for one night and my friend recommended this place for a late night snack. Ordered the carne asada burrito. It was.........ok. Not that great but it wasn't that bad. Got the job done in making me feel bloated and full so no complaints here."}
{"text":"Illustration: My family and I live in Tucson, and my parents only ever go to Phoenix to shop and get banh mi from Lee's Sandwiches. I forced them to stop at Los Favoritos in the morning, before we had gone shopping or stopped to get banh mi for dinner. My dad and I both ordered burritos while my mom, who resists trying new things, turned up her nose and said she did not want a burrito because she was saving her stomach for banh mi. I told her that was fine but she was absolutely not welcome to have any of my burrito because I knew that what happened next was going to happen: she ate half of my dad's burrito, and when I still refused to give her half of mine, she got up to order her own. Then she raved about how delicious and cheap it was the entire drive home. Yup."}
{"text":"I tried the shrimp cocktail upon the cashiers recommendation...great choice! They made it fresh, dicing all the vegetables and squeezing the lime right into the cup! The only thing it was missing was the tostada's. My wife had the rolled taco plate and she approved. 

Brought me back to good California Mexican food!"}
{"text":"I prefer this location.  The beans were excellent in my burrito, and my shredded beef taco had a lot of cheese on it as I like it."}
{"text":"Bomb breakfast burritos. I like potato egg and cheese with pico inside. My hubby likes chorizo egg and cheese add onions and fresh jalapeños."}
{"text":"I am a huge Los Favoritos fan.. Unfortunately, my hubby isn't! I do not understand why. Their California burrito is the best in town. Their tortillas are also very fresh and flavorful. My favorite is their sauces. My problem is that the food is so good that I want to come back here every other day. 
Los Favoritos offers a quick fix to a mexican food craving.
I am a huge fan and will be their repeat customer.
Thank you Los Fav's!"}
{"text":"Los Whatever

This place is just a step above *bertos.  Just your standard, run of the mill \"Mexican\"  food.  Like most Mexican food, it's \"OK\".  Nothing special here.  I had the carne asada platter with a drink, it came to $9.11.  A conspiracy?  Perhaps.  I don't see what the big deal here is, nor do I understand how anyone with papillae can give this place 5-stars."}
{"text":"So many people raved about this place so I had to try it. I usually try the bean & cheese burritos to get a feel for a place but they had a daily special of of 3 rolled tacos with guacamole with rice and beans for $5.10 I added a flour tortilla for .60 cents. Rolled tacos were on the smaller side, the rice was great and the beans watery at best. Decent for under $6. Damn that red sauced burned my mouth and the green sauce was blah. Tone down on the red sauce and add more flavor than heat it will complement the food."}
{"text":"So we work at a company down the street. We have over 1000 employees whom order from los favs considering their food has always been good. Unfortunately you have lost our business and will be spreading the word on our past experience. Considering we have been ordering from you guys for years and you prob make over $1000/M just from us alone I can guarantee you we will NEVER be ordering from here again and will do everything we can to make sure none of our friends/family do as well. You have messed up our order the past 3 times..... Such as forgetting food we PAID for. You would rather decline giving us a free buritto (YOU SAID YOU WOULD OVER THE PHONE) and lose our business is totally fine with me. The manager I spoke to acted like he could care less. DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE. ORDER FROM ANY OTHER PLACE. Horrible customer service. Also will be filing a complaint and likely voiding charge with credit card company. Treat your customers with some respect, jeeze."}
{"text":"This is a clean place with good service... But the food is just not great. The breakfast and Carne Asada burritos were not bad, just nothing to write home about. However, their chicken tacos had some sort of dehydrated chicken or something. The wife had a hard time eating it.

I debated giving a third star, but when eating your food is an unpleasant struggle, you get no third star."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in my California chicken burrito. I went the day after Christmas. The chicken was very dry almost as if it had been cooked and sat out for a while. I kind of wonder if it was their leftover turkey from Christmas."}
{"text":"Place was clean and busy this morning. Heard about it and thought I would try the breakfast burro. It contained bacon, egg, cheese and potatos. All served with green or red hot sauce.

Ample portion, lots of bacon and filling. Unfortunately, filling without flavor is not my favoritos. Breakfast selections were very limited. Will be back to my standby Burrito Shack down the road."}
{"text":"While this isn't the best spot, it is a quick and easy place to get something to eat. Their breakfast burritos are excellent and prices make it worth the visit."}
{"text":"I have loved eating at this place since the first time that I ordered the rolled tacos. All the food tastes great. My favorites so far are the breakfast burritos which are enormous in size and served all day and I also liked the the rolled tacos which come with the delicious rice and beans. I have never had a bad experience ordering from this place. They raised the prices recently but the food is still good for the price. The guac that comes on the rolled tacos is kind of bland but adds to the delicious greasiness. It's also open til 2 am so the late hours were perfect for college students or a late night run for burritos when nothing is open. Definitely a great find!"}
{"text":"Good Mexican food at a reasonable price.  The restaurant is clean (probably because it's still new) and the menu has a wide variety (although it's small and hard to read). But hey, I guess some people need to see the picture of what they are ordering.  The food was average, not outstanding, but tasty and well prepared.  I had the carne asada tacos.  They were good, but they only had one corn tortilla which broke quickly upon my first few bites.  It was overflowing with meat and guacamole but I would definitely make it two tortillas instead of one if I was the owner.  My wife had the chimichanga, which she said was nice and crispy and had an extra bonus of green pepper inside.  Overall I was satisfied, but I don't know that I would be a regular here.  The price is on point, but I am a bit of a food snob and like more creative fare."}
{"text":"This place is usually infested with high schoolers and that makes me stressed.  Have I become a bitter old lady?  Bah hambug!

Anyways, I've been coming here for years.  I was introduced to this place some time during my ASU days by some guys I use to hang with.  While their food might not be traditional, I always enjoy my meal.  The place is decorated sparingly and the tables aren't the cleanliest [high school hangout, remember?], the portions are great for the price you pay.  I usually get the carne asada burrito combo, the California burrito combo, or the shrimp burrito.  You get moist fluffy rice, decent refried beans, and a giant [not Chipotle giant or anything but a good size] burrito for the combo.  I love how they don't pack their burritos with cheap \"filler\" ingredients.  They seriously stuff your burrito with a ton of flavorful meat!

I'll probably keep coming back for many years to come when I need me some Americanized-Mexican eats although I rather take my food to-go because high schoolers are the bane of my existence.  Wee!  If only their red sauce was spicier..."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Los Favoritos for years now.  While there's definitely better Mexican restaurants around the valley, Los Favoritos is my favorite place for Mexican in the east valley.

The atmosphere is nothing to marvel over but service is always great and the food is decent and nicely portioned.  

I always get the California carne asada burrito combo with a horchata as my beverage of choice.  The beans and the rice is pretty standard fare but the burrito is money:  That warm tortilla, the nicely seasoned carne asada, the melty cheese, and those potatoes... heaven!  It's especially heavenly after a night of guzzling booze [I still come here sober mind you].  While they offer the basic red and green salsa, it's not exactly spicy enough for my taste but I don't mind too much.  Fair warning for those mucho-caliente-lovers!"}
{"text":"Talk about not having their act together. I called in an order, got there 15 minutes later and had to wait another 15!!! They are so disorganized it's unreal. The guy working in bagging the food was rude, all the customers including me could not believe the service at this restaurant."}
{"text":"My family and I eat here a few times a month. Have not gotten anything we hadn't liked yet. Their rolled tacos are to die for I must say. Besides the long wait time Sunday mornings; everything else is perfect."}
{"text":"I love their food.  It is truly authentic Mexican food.  Hard to find a seat during prime times.  Chicken enchiladas with green sauce are my favorite entree."}
