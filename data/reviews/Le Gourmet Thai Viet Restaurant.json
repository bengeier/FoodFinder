{"text":"I tried the 1000 spice beef.  I decided to try the dish without asking for it thai hot as I normally do.  I'm not quite sure why, but I think I wanted to see what 1000 spices tasted like, though I'm fairly sure 1000 spices is more of a metaphor than a literal description of the ingredients.  The normal heat level is fairly mild by my scale, but was still quite tasty.  I would definitely return to try a dish with my usual thai hot request."}
{"text":"The price you are paying, the food is fantastic. Not too greasy, not too salty, pretty close to the real thing. The food isn't the best I've tried in terms of Vietnamese food in Montreal, but its up there. Not a lot of people know about his restaurant, but I hope with this review it would get more attention. It is a hidden gem in Montreal, and if you live near the Milton Park Community or the Plateau it's an easy walk.   I shall definitely come back, great comfort food and close to where I live.   Overall, atmosphere 4/5 Food 4.5/5 Value 6/5"}
{"text":"Positives: the price was extremely affordable and there was a nice outdoor courtyard out back.  Negatives: the place had no customers, the service was so-so, and the menu was missing Vietnamese and Thai restaurant staples (no pho?)."}
{"text":"I went today and it was closed foe renovations so you should call before to be sure it's open."}
