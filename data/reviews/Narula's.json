{"text":"We were around Mississauga area and searched yelp for tandoori / bar- BBQ Indian cuisine when Narula's popped up and we decided to go there ! Thanks Yelp !!  Food was amazing, felt like we were home and were treated likewise. I am sitting here at home writing this review weighing 2 kgs extra but it was all worth it! Definitely visiting again ...   We had Paneer Tikka, Tandoori Platter, Butter Chicken, Different type of Nans ... all good !"}
{"text":"As far as Indian food goes, this place was amazing! The location is a bit hidden and tucked away, you'd almost have to know of this place beforehand to visit it.   The menu selection is not very large, but it has all the popular dishes. (Various tandoori dishes, curries, etc.) My wife and I visited a few nights ago and we ordered butter chicken, palak paneer (spicy, by request), lamb curry, an order of rice and garlic naan. In all honesty, this place has the BEST butter chicken I have ever tasted in my life! It may have to do with the fact that the food is made fresh and to order, but no other butter chicken that I have tried even comes close.   The gentleman who served us was very kind and welcoming, made sure that we had everything we needed. Had I known about this place before, I would have visited many times. I certainly will be back in the future!"}
{"text":"I decided to go to this place for lunch today. Called in and ordered their butter chicken with rice and salad special. The food was OK, nothing special but for my taste they had put too much of the butter chicken sauce on the rice, you could not even see the rice. The real disappointment was the size of the salad, it was 4 bites, no joke, the small container that it came in was less than half full. Over all it was JUST OK, but I doubt that I'll be going back."}
{"text":"This place serves one thing deliciously, that's dissatisfaction.... I went there in hopes of eating some delicious butter chicken, in an area where Indian food is scarce, especially if you're looking for a quick bite at lunch in the local business area...I opened my meal  the hopes of a delicious filling meal but what I got was the complete opposite... The butter chicken had 3 YES 3 tiny pieces of chicken as if the portion was meant for an infant or dwarf of some sort... Then the salad was 2 fork fulls! Wat was the point of even giving that? I mean the container and the 5 minutes the inexperienced migrant worker took to prepare my salad, or should I just say sal- cuz they forgot the rest of it, probably cost more than the damn salad! Waste of money for a grown human being, perfect for imps, dwarfs, hobbits, and anything else under 4 feet because that's the portion size they serve!"}
{"text":"Small and tasty.  The food was very good. Well cooked and well prepared. Although the place can accommodate 10-12 guests, but it's comfy. The only drawback was no actual cutlery... \"Yeah that was bad.\" Paper plates and plastic spoons for in house dining? So in case you are picking up, that'll be not a factor.  Otherwise everything was 5 star."}
{"text":"Narula's has the Best Indian Food in the GTA!!!.  Everyone should try their Butter Chicken - nothing compares.  Their Naan and Tandoori and curry/dal items are also top notch.  Be sure to leave room for dessert ,  their Falooda and Kulfi is to die for.  You will also find Indian drinks like Limca (lemon/lime)  and Thums up (cola) which puts North American Coca-Cola to shame and Kingfisher Beer.  We also ordered a variety of wraps for our office meeting and they received rave reviews, the five extra orders were also completely devoured.  They can also spice your food to your heat level, mild, medium, hot, extra hot and extra extra hot!!."}
{"text":"Ordered the butter chicken last week and WS very disappointed.  Usually we go here for lunch and portion size is perfect.   But if you dine at this restaurant after 4pm, their butter chicken is served in a shot glass.  Do not order here after 4pm"}
{"text":"A small, clean Indian food joint tucked away in a little corner, Narula's serves up some good Indian cuisine for a reasonable price.  Serving portions aren't large, but Indian food is fairly heavy so it's an adaquate portion.   The food is prepared when you order, so while you don't get curry that's been sitting on a hotplate for hours on end, it also takes a while for your food to arrive.  So those looking for a quick bite for lunch, be warned! It took about 20 minutes for my butter chicken dish with Naan to arrive.   The food is flavorful, spiced well, and the Naan was good and not overly oily.  For $7 it's well priced, the only issue is the wait time."}
{"text":"I must say the owner Mr Ashish has no sense of customer service..I am a regular customer who ordered food every week. On one ocassion my order didnt reach the min 30 dollar limit. Instead of accomodating I was rudely told that the order had to be 30 or more. Ironically my order was 27 dollars.   Not only did they not accomodate, they hung up on me and it seems like they don't value customers at all. This is the owner and he kept telling me that it's not in his hands to waive thr 30 dollar limit once.   For an average restaurant, with average food. This experince is bad.   I will never order from this place. So unfortunate as they loose a loyal customer."}
{"text":"This place is 3 words: YUM YUMMIER and YUMMIEST lol Matt M. and I went yesterday after working out at the gym lol We ordered:  Butter Chicken (we requested spicy) $8.95  Lamb Curry (also spicy) $8.95 Palak Paneer (Spinach/Panner cheese) $7.95 Rice $3.95 Garlic Naan $1.95  The prices were very reasonable for the portions we received and when I asked if it could be made spice the very nice man replied that everything was made fresh so of course they can make it however I want it!!! Everything took about 20 minutes to make it out at the same time but it was HOT, FRESH, YUMMY and SPICY lol We had the wagjag voucher and so only paid about $20 for the full meal. I had left over for lunch today! The butter chicken is so authentically good, it isn't too heavy, the chicken was very moist and not tough at all. The lamb had bone/no bone pieces (hubby doesn't like bone, gets in the way of his meat) but I love bones and I enjoyed the flavors in them very much. The paneer in the palak dish was really nice, some places it is harder and has a weird taste but this place did it really well. The rice was a huge plate for so cheap and it was basmati plain rice with some spices mixed in, doesn't over power the food but perfectly compliments it. The garlic non was not dripping in oil and was still warm and crisp and tasted very yummy even by itself.   The only thing about this place is that it is hard to spot, beside Capitol Banquet Hall, tucked in the corner. They opened as a take out place but have added tables to become a restaurant. Don't expect waiter service, you order the food at the counter and then have a seat as they bring everything out for you. You can take out as easily as eat in, but definitely do one of the above. Some more fancy dining restaurants have nothing on their personal service, and authentic \"write home about it\" butter chicken.  P.S. they also have tandoori, lunch wraps, veggie burgers, salads, kebabs =D   They do close early though at 8pm so I'm guessing they are more a lunch place. But we got there at 7:45pm unaware of this until i looked at their brochure after because he served us without hesitation and was attentive and friendly nonetheless. We left at close to 9pm and he was chatting with us until we left. :)"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place if you want to try some indian food. This is actually the first place I went to when I wanted to get into the cuisine.   I recommend their butter chicken, its the best one I've had and no other place has impressed me as much as the one they make it here. Their other dishes are good as well, but am more biased with the one I like more.  Service is sometimes slow, and sometimes its fast. It all depends on the day. They have a decent amount of tables inside if you want to eat but I usually order take out.  Definitely do give this place a try if your in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Came to Narula's after work, so around 5:30pm-6ish, and there wasn't a single person there. Regardless, it's the dead hours before dinner so we didn't think much of it. The place itself looks kind of shady on the outside, but is actually pretty nice inside. A bit dim, but still nice. Menu offers up some tasty looking Indian food.  I ordered the Tandoori Chicken with a side of fries, while my buddy got the butter chicken with rice and naan. The tandoori chicken was done very well. Four solid pieces of chicken that came grilled nicely, with slight char marks and served atop a bed of slaw with a lemon wedge and onions. The sizzling plate made the dish sound as good as it looked and smelled. Chicken was spiced nicely and had a nice juicy interior.   Service was a bit slow and unattentive, but it might have been from sheer boredom with us being the only table. The food was decent and they do have lunch specials, so I might consider coming back."}
{"text":"There is a surprising lack of non-buffet Indian options in my area of Mississauga.  Whenever I'm craving a warming, satisfying lunch, I head to Narulas.  $6.95 plus tax gets you tender butter chicken curry, rice or naan, and a small salad.  The butter chicken is delicious and savoury, although I really don't know or care about its authenticity.  I recommend the perfectly pillowy naan, and the \"Indian dressing\" on the salad.  Wait times can vary depending on how busy they are, but it's worth the 10 minutes for the freshness.  Just take a seat and watch the DVD's of Two and a Half Men or Everybody Loves Raymond on their TV."}
{"text":"Absolutely excellent food and service! They are now called flavours and the place looks great! We come here very often as its close to my boyfriends work place.  EVERYTHING is excellent, you must try their goat vandaloo and tandoori chicken.  They make it to your spicy level and its not just hot sause on top but the flavour all together is to die for! One of the best indian resturants in mississauga in my opinion"}
{"text":"This place has some very tasty butter chicken. Prices are very reasonable. Not much seating area and usually full during lunch. Only complaint would be the very small portions. All the sides are bite size and portions are very small. All the sides are about 1 or two bites literally. . Other than that, food quality is great. If they portioned properly, this place would do very well."}
