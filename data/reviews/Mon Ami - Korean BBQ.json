{"text":"Since I really liked their resto, my boyfriend and I wanted to try out their korean bbq. & I must say it's pretty great. It offers a variety of fresh meat such as kalbi, samgyeopsal, chicken, etc. with free drinks you can pick in their cute little refrigerator !  In the menu you can also order some small plates from their resto such as bibimpap, fried chicken, teokbokki and much more! Staffs were nice too :)"}
{"text":"First experience at the all-you-can-eat was very good.  Great service from an understanding staff was a pleasant surprise. My family really enjoyed the bimbimbap which was excellent and had a nice hey to it. The short ribs and barbecue beef were excellent as well. If you haven't tried Korean BBQ, thus is the spot."}

{"text":"Finally made it to the right one. Tried 2 other locations before realizing they have different concepts. This place was SO GOOD! Im salivating just remembering it. The meats are all so amazing and tasty. We tried most of the side dishes also. All amazing. Be careful for the amount you put. Ive been to a similar korean place and when you put 1 amount of a meat it was literally 2 little pieces. Here its 1 portion. So we ended up with a huge amount of food.  The fried chicken is good but fills you up too much, skip it its nothing special. The little rice patty skewers are amazing Im so surprised. The sashimi also very good. Refreshing after all the meat."}
{"text":"Première visite chez Mon Ami et je ne suis pas déçue. La viande est de bonne qualité, il y a une grande variété d'ingrédients et un bon souci du détail.  Le personnel est aimable, souriant, serviable et attentionné.  Un plus pour les boissons à volonté.  J'ai particulièrement aimé le kalbi, le porc épicé, la poitrine de porc et les petits poulpes.  Les crevettes quant à elles sont minuscules mais ont l'avantage de cuire très vite.  Les champignons sont offerts en 3 variétés (Paris, enoki et King), très cool!  La laitue est essentielle en ce qui me concerne pour la fraîcheur et le parfait petit wrap avec kimchi ou daïkon mariné. Un vrai délice!  J'ai aimé aussi le tokbokki qui était bien relevé et légèrement sucré et la portion était parfaite.  Les nouilles étaient elles aussi réussies et moins bourratives que le riz. (Petite astuce qui permet de manger plus de viande) Le poulet frit est délicieux et croustillant à souhait. Pas très assaisonné mais meilleur que le poulet à griller.  Le seul point négatif a d'ailleurs été que j'ai trouvé que les marinades étaient un peu fades et légèrement trop sucrées à mon goût.  Un autre point est que vous feriez mieux de prévoir des vêtements de rechange si vous prévoyez une sortie après parce que l'odeur reste.   Mon expérience n'en demeure pas moins positive et il y a quelques items que je n'ai pas encore essayé donc j'y retournerai certainement."}
{"text":"As the name implies, this location of Mon Ami focuses on Korean BBQ with an all-you-can-eat menu. Our group focused on the meats: chicken, bulgogi, pork, kalbi....and while those were cooking we dug into steamed dumplings, salmon sashimi, fried chicken, seafood pancake, and soybean paste stew. While they were all pretty good (and the fried chicken was great as in all locations), come here for the BBQ. Get yourself some lettuce, sesame oil and salt, soybean paste, kimchi, seasoned green onions, raw garlic, and go to town with your slightly charred meats and seafood. Also, feel free to grab as many sodas or juices you want from the fridge in the middle of the restaurant.  I hear that the weekend has more options than weekdays, so the extra price may be worth it if you want more variety. As it is, we still focused on the meat and I'm craving it again as I type this...."}
{"text":"I absolutely love love love this place and I have been recommending it to all my friends. This is the only all you can eat korean bbq that I've encountered in Montreal. You can get good quality pork belly and they serve it the traditional korean way with lettuce leaves, raw garlic and sesame oil with salt sauce. They also have a variety of other meats (LA galbi, bulgogi, spicy pork, chicken, etc) and everything is authentically korean.   Their menu also boasts a good variety of korean dishes such as bibimbap, kimbap, pajeon and fried chicken! Everything tastes good and fresh, not like a lot of the other all you can eat places.   This place is only open at night time for dinner."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best authentic Korean barbecue places in Montreal. Granted there aren't many places, especially AYCE places, this place still stands out by the quality of the food they serve.   I went there with a small group of 4 people on a Saturday evening. At first, we wanted to try the Mon Ami location at Ville St-Laurent. A combination of a long line up in front of the restaurant and bad weather led us to go to this NDG location. We called around 6:30pm and luckily, we were able to get a confirmation for 7:45pm.   Getting there by bus and metro is not the most convenient way. I would strongly recommend taking the car if you plan to get there. As it is a very residential area, I do not think there will be any issue finding parking.  Ok enough talk now, let's get to the real thing: the food. What to say, their menu is fairly simple, with few choices of meats, vegetables, and their \"famous\" fried chicken. This restaurant is a self-cook type of AYCE, so you will have to cook the raw meat yourself. That being said, the cuts are pretty thin so the cooking time is fairly quick, especially when you are as hungry as we were ;) The meat was well seasoned most of the time (much better than other AYCE I would say because it is mainly less salty). One small downside, however, is the fried chicken because we do not get to chose what part of the chicken we get. That being said, the chicken was well fried.   Service itself was also great, with fairly quick response time as we put in orders (then again, when compared to other AYCE places).   Overall, very great Korean bbq place that I would strongly recommend if you want proper (and real) Korean bbq owned by Koreans."}
{"text":"I love korean restaurants but this one is unique for its fried chicken. It's also BYOB which is a big plus for me. A winning place."}
{"text":"Very taste BBQ! Go here on an empty stomach because it is AYCE for a reason. Their service is decent although the servers did forget some things. I haven't had Korean BBQ anywhere else in Montreal prior so I have no point of comparison but the meat seemed fresh and flavourful. It's not in the downtown core, kind of out of the way in NDG but I'd say go if you're staying close by - otherwise it's not worth the trek.  They have unlimited soda from the fridge which you get yourself. It's a cozy place if you want to spend some money on good Korean BBQ."}
{"text":"I and my friend were there. We waited for a table but the staff ignored us. We feel we are not welcome so we decide never come back."}
{"text":"Excellent resto de type BBQ-Coréen. Le resto est petit mais sympa. Une des rares places all-you-can-eat qui n'oublient rien de ce que vous commandez."}
{"text":"We visited Mon Ami for all you can eat Korean BBQ with some friends recently. This is one of five Mon Ami locations. #1 is on St Catherine's downtown and #2 & #3 are on Somerled. #4 is in Cotes des neiges, #5 is on Sherbrooke st. Actually we first went by accident to the other Sommerled location which mentioned that this location (further west on Sommerled) is the one to come by for KBBQ.   Entering in you can smell the wafting smokesmell of grilled meat, soy sauce, garlic and sugar. KBBQ has a certain aroma to it. If you are coming on a first date go home and have a shower right after. If you care about fine clothing, don't wear those clothes to KBBQ as it will absorb that smell like a sponge. Same as your hair.   Onto the food. They had the regular servings of bulgogi, chicken, pork belly and it was a nice gesture that you could order bibimbap and other items to accompany. The menu was a bit light on meat selection. No Fish or seafood. No specialties such as Ox tongue or other delicacies. Also the vegetable dishes were quite small. Some larger portions of banchan would have been nice.  The food overall was a shade above okay but it didn't blow me away. My situation is I've been fortunate to have KBBQ many places across North America, Toronto and Seoul. You cannot compare to LA/SoCal style Korean BBQ to anything here. My yardstick has been raised to having experienced awesome KBBQ. So for Montreal this may be as good as you can get.   One advantage is Monday to Thursday it's $21.99 pp. on the weekend it shoots up $4 more to $24.99 pp.   Service is a bit slow. They don't really rush to bring you out food. If you are coming as a group it's a fantastic activity for 4-6 people. For the price value it's not too bad."}
{"text":"By far the best AYCE Korean BBQ in Montréal! A little far from downtown core, but well worth the distance. The meats and Korean dishes were very flavourful with a very nice cozy ambiance. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"A solid Korean AYCE BBQ! Come here when you're hangrrrries.  Service is a little slow but they get the job done.... you're usually here with friends anyways so you won't feel the time pass by! AYCE option comes with a complimentary drink.  Menu selection is relatively large with a nice variety of known plates, menu items are palpable.... try everything! We went with a bunch of meats and Korean plates and everything was most excellent. Flavorful meats to say the least!   Would come again."}
{"text":"I love their fried chickens and BBQ. Cheap, tasty and homey. Love the restaurant manager too. She is extremely nice and sweet."}
{"text":"Went there with my family for supper. Restaurant is quite small and may seem sketchy from the outside, but inside, its really clean, lots of light and quite cozy. Waiters are really nice, they are not always able to answer our questions, but it is clear that they try their best to give a good service. Really liked the food there. Unlike other KBBQ, they actually have korean dishes on the menu, such as bibimbap, korean sushi, and korean fried chicken. Also, the lettuce is free of charge there (at Chako you have to pay $2 per portion I believe). The only dish we did not like were the dumplings. The other dishes were quite good.  Tip: Make sure to ask the waiter to change the grill when it's dirty! Or your meat will be full of cancer. Will definitely return"}
{"text":"Loved it! I think that this is the best Korean barbeque I've ever been to so far in Montreal. They have a good variety of choices and what I love most is that they include their famous fried chicken which is so delicious. Another great thing about this place is that the soft drinks are free. The staff is very kind and I find that the prices are fair. I would recommend this place for a group of friends or to go with family!"}
{"text":"Quick service, good quality meat, healthy portions and above all tasty. Lots of options too."}
{"text":"Un bon endroit pour des viandes et des ingrédients de qualités. Nous avons eu un très bon service rapide et courtois. Le seul hic, c'est que la puissance maximale de la plaque de cuisson est beaucoup trop basse, ce qui ne permet pas de griller correctement la viande, elle ne fait que bouillir... Dommage."}
{"text":"Horrible business for turning away customers a hour and 10 minutes before they close. I was really looking forward to eating here. I won't ever unfortunately..."}
