{"text":"Had dinner here for the first time. We were very impressed with the kind and attentive service. The food was very fresh and authentic. My chicken was so moist I could barely pick it up with the fork. We enjoyed the house wine and the desserts were to die for. We were told they make their own desserts. The atmosphere was perfect. There is not one negative thing that our party of three can say. Highly recommend this restaurant and will definitely go back.  Grateful for a nice and pleasant evening."}
{"text":"Ok I ordered my food it can about 40 min. It's ok understanding it's busy inside. I asked the waiter bring some ice for my drink. He said ok, he went to the next table and started conversation with his friends about soccer so he forgot about us. Then he came to the table and I asked him can you bring the ice, he was embarrassed because his face turn red, he left and started talking to his friends again about soccer again. The food came and I didn't have a chance again to ask him about the ice because he took off to fast by the time he came back the drink was gone down the tube. I asked him for ketchup for my fries and guess what. Yep! He forgot again so my girlfriend got up and got the ketchup inside for him. Then I asked another waiter inside if he can bring us to drinks and ice! He brought it fast. After all the food was delicious but the service ruined it all. Hope the owners read this and fix this problem. When you work work please! Don't talk to your buddies."}
{"text":"We live in Chicago and visited Toronto last week. The highlight was an amazing meal and great service at Churrasqueira Martins. This is not your ordinary Portuguese restaurant. While the food is traditional, it is extremely delicious, well presented and the prices are very reasonable. We had bacalhao a lagareiro, which was a grilled salt cod served atop a pile of grilled vegetables with roasted potatoes on the side. The salt cod was not salty at all. In fact, at first I couldn't tell if it was salt cod or fresh cod. It was so flaky and delicious. The serving was huge but I couldn't resist the great taste and ate it all! Our other entree was grilled whole fish (robalo). The fish was very fresh and served with small red potatoes in olive oil. Both dishes were as good or better than anything you could hope to find in Portugal. The nice selection of Portuguese wines helped to round out our meal. We can't wait until our next visit to Toronto so we can try Martins' chicken grilled over charcoal. If you are looking for authentic Portuguese cuisine with the finest ingredients and service, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I've been to Martins 3 times in the last month or so. Suffice to say I really like this restaurant. Their is the closest thing that you will get to a restaurant in Portugal. I've brought friends from Portugal here and they were impressed. Everything I've had here was good.   Their Portuguese wine selection is also good.   If you want traditional Portuguese, I don't think you will be disappointed going to Martins.   See you soon!"}
{"text":"The food was okay but the service was incredibly bad, servers and the owner have such bad attitude. Even if the food was good I would never come back. Would not recommend for people who likes amazing time and great service."}
{"text":"Terrible service! I made reservations for seven people to this place two weeks in advance. When we arrived we waited around for a while for someone to greet us and show us to our table. When finally someone arrived they had no idea about our reservations and had to go look for the person responsible for the reservations! It turns out our reservations were lost. We  had to sit on a small table across from the entrance exposed to a draft from the entrance door. The waitress who took our orders could not remember who had ordered what and kept serving the wrong dishes. We also got no help with items on the menu so had to give up on some of the selections. The only good part of this restaurant were their octopus and seabass dishes but the Ceasar salad was awful. Because of the horrible experience with the service, I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.   https://www.tripadvisor.ca/ShowUserReviews-g155019-d2571239-r366870727-Churrasqueira_Martins-Toronto_Ontario.html#"}
{"text":"Problem small space if you don't speak Portuguese they ignore you and give your orders away!"}
{"text":"Hard to get to in Toronto, not an outstanding purpose, but the food was decent. Maybe not worth the price tag. Servers uncoordinated and unhelpful. Food came pretty quickly"}
{"text":"This review is in regards to the takeout side.  I've been for the half chicken dinner numerous times and while the product is undeniably really good, I've on more than one occasion had terrible, hostile service.  An example was last night.  On the menu board the half chicken dinner comes with a choice of sides from either hot or cold offerings.  I chose rice and the cold bean salad and politely asked if I could get the salad in a separate container, which I've ordered before with no issues.  The woman serving me screwed up her face and said \"NO, combo is all one.\".  I asked if I could buy the container and she kept saying no it all has to be in one it's a combo.  Obviously I became a bit irritated because I just wanted the cold salad to stay, you know, COLD.  Finally out of nowhere she said it would be $2 for the container which she previously wouldn't sell me.  $2 for a plastic takeout container?!  Is it a time thing? Because it certainly can't be a cost issue and in the time she spent abrasively arguing with me she could have filled 5 containers.  I was hungry and annoyed so I just paid the $2.  The bottom line is I really like the food and would like to come here often but as a customer I would like to LIKE coming to your place.  The food doesn't leave a bad taste in your mouth but the service often will."}
{"text":"Best Portuguese food around by far! This place has great service and is usually full of people enjoying the excellent cuisine. But if your in a hurry you can call for a pick up or they just opened on the other side of the restaurant a quick take out spot where you can walk-in  and a few minutes later you're walking out with your delicious food. Love it!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Portuguese food and spectacular friendly service. A must visit. its very hard to find authentic Portuguese food of high quality, that's why Martins is the best the food and service are 5 star, but the price is more than reasonable, you must try it but its always busy so expect to wait"}
{"text":"Very good food.!! Very good sevice Was there today .. Super happy Will be back with family ."}
{"text":"I had a friend visiting from Vancouver along with his wife and they wanted to experience true Portuguese cuisine and culture.  Churrasqueira Martin supposedly had all of this and more.   I was very disappointed as were my guests.  Firstly, we had made a reservation, which didn't get recorded.  So after finally waiting for a table, the server ( the first of 4) recommended the Octopus, which they were apparently out of.  I had ordered a wine from their wine list, which they didn't have.  It was only 8:30pm, and they were out of main dishes and wine?  I had ordered the lobster tail with Filet Mignon, my wife ordered the grilled squid, my guest ordered bacalhau abras.  The presentation was incrediable!  Unfortunately, that's were it ended.  The lobster tail was pleasantly seasoned to cover the gooey texture of raw seafood.  I nearly threw up in my mouth.  I brought this to the attention of my server., She promptly returned the dish to the chef who responded with a sneer.  How dare I return uncooked lobster tail!   It was the last I saw of that server.  My dish was returned with a rubbery lobster tail, crisp at the edges, and a filet Mignon that could of been used as a hockey puck at the next leaf game.   Asking for water to try and wash this sludge down was chore in itself.  The servers were to busy playing around then paying proper attention to their customers.   At the end if it all, we were served up with luke warm cappuccino's.  The best part of the night, was walking out the door.   If you are looking for bad food, and horrible service  then this is the place, however; Authentic Portuguese cuisine and culture, it is not."}
{"text":"Excelent steaks, for a reasonable price.  Picanha was amazing, for those Venezuelans out there looking for an \"almuerzo adeco\", this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"This is in regards to take out.   FRESH off the rotisserie chicken so tender it falls apart just looking at it paired with baked Parisienne potatoes,  and seasoned rice. Yummy.   Also available are desserts -  puddings packed with flavor -  dark chocolate rich and creamy,  eggs rice pudding,  super intense passion fruit just explode your senses.  Note that they sell ala carte roasted pork buts, and fried pork skin --  this is a serve yourself  but be aware that these are $20/kg ---  and the costs add up quick for these delectable goodies --"}
{"text":"Romeo had a few weeks off to recover from his belly button surgery. When I asked what the surgery was for; his exact explanation was: \"You know how my belly button pops out? So, they popped it back in.\" I grabbed Ricardo, and we all drove down to the restaurant without me asking many more questions.  As far as Churrasqueiras go in Toronto, it doesn't get any fancier than Martins. I was confused as to why Romeo brought us to this particular Churrasqueira. As soon as we entered we were met by the six million dollar man; Romeo's boss. We call him that because every year he makes approximately six million dollars. Immediately, I calculated how much cash I had on me, because I knew this was going not going to be a frugal affair.   We sat, and the waitress came, and it became clear to me why we had come here. Romeo's eyes lit up like he'd seen a girl for the first time. My eyes lit up upon gazing at the menu as if I've just discovered food had prices. Let's just say it wasn't your typical Portuguese amount. Nothing ridiculous though. Tiger shrimp, olive and salami plate, and a whole bunch of other things that I didn't recognize. The shrimp was sliced in half from its back, which made it a significantly less messy affair than regular seafood sessions. I ordered a bottle of Sagres, which turned out to be a mistake. So I corrected the mistake by ordering a bottle of Super Bock, and that will forever be the day that I discovered Super Bock, the delicious uniquely flavoured Quebec beverage of the distinguished broken-English speaking gentlemen. It went perfectly with my pork, but it would have pair even better than perfect if I ordered anything else than the pork.  The sausage was disappoint, and I got a side of rice because the enormous chips that came with my meal was such an acquired taste that only someone who grew up eating it could appreciate. The steak however was satisfactory, and some of the fish dishes were very impressive. Somehow, I feel that this menu is better served during the summertime.   I asked the waitress how old she was, and she pretended not to speak English. I persisted and she gave in. My friends cautioned me on the very North American tendency of shying away from questioning a woman about her age, and I reminded that neither any of us or the waitress was born on this Continent, so just get real.  I got her age didn't I, Romeo? You starry eyed lush. When we said no to dessert, I swear I almost saw Romeo shed a tear because it meant we won't be staying for another minute longer. Not like he didn't have his chance. Waitress girl came to our table at least right times speaking only to him in Portuguese while ignoring the rest of us. It would have been a beautiful love affair only if Romeo wasn't Captain Flop.   It came out to $150 plus tips, and you can bet Romeo turned that tip from tip sized, to suggestion size. #shaft"}
{"text":"Great, but expensive... Gets noisy. Staff likes to clang cutlery right beside your table. Obvious preference given to those who speak the language, but hey, whatever..."}
{"text":"We waited a little to long for our meals however when they did arrive we were impressed with the portion and platting. It was tasty and authentic. My husband ordered the surf and turf and I ordered the seafood rice. The rice was a tad over salted but nothing over react about. All and all I would come here again. Simply because it's in my neck of the woods and there are some other plates we would like to explore."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants nobody knows about!    This gem is hidden off Rogers street in a strip mall.  You would never find it driving by.  But this place is full every weekend dinner, you must make reservations!  I've been here several times, and I have very little to complain about.  One time I waited 45min for our food after realizing the waitress forgot to put in the order.  It was busy, shit happens.  But that's was once out of many times I've been there.  They give u bread, goat cheese, and olives to start on the house, and it's all fresh and delicious!  All the food is cooked perfectly, presentation is flawless too.  The servers are very professional - they make it feel like a real 5 star restaurant.    I once had dinner there with a group of about 12 people.  They allowed us to bring our own cake at no charge.    The best portuguese restaurant I've been to in Toronto so far."}
{"text":"No disrespect to other posters, but ordering filet mignon at a Portuguese restaurant is like getting pasta at East Side Mario's. If you're going to a Portuguese place you need to get seafood, or a meat dish you wouldn't eat anywhere else.   I'm not here to critique the restaurant, which is fantastic by the way, but I'd like to comment on the chicken and the takeout.  The chicken from this place, is hands down the best in the city. I have a close family member that works for another VERY REPUTABLE Churasqueira and I would go to Martin's 10x over  They cook it the way I grew up eating it as a kid. Rotisseried over hot coals (except our rotisserie was built using an old washing machine motor). That's the Portuguese way to do it LOL  This method ensures a juicier chicken and even the white meat is moist. I find a lot of other places use gas and it dries up the bird.   One issue I have is that the piri piri sauce is a little too greasy sometimes, but the taste of seasalt and real fire on that chicken more than makes up for it.   Everyone must try this place."}
{"text":"Yes people are right this is a good restaurant but it was no where near my expectations. There is not very much to say about this restaurant. The food was very tasty and the platting was out of this world. Sadly the service was very very poor. Our waters were not being refilled and any special requests that people asked for in there food the chefs did not listen. The overall restaurant is a medium size restaurant but was very very loud. Its a great lace for groups and parties as when i was there 3 people were celebrating there birthday. Alongside the service my family and i were in the restaurant for 3 hours before we finally left. It had taken 20 minutes for us to get any service and then 25 more minutes for us to order. This restaurant is very authentic and the flavours are great. I would suggests take out if that is an option at this location."}
{"text":"First time that I went there and I was satisfied with quantity and quality of the food. Next time I will fast the whole day before go there because the plates are big in the restaurant anid I like big plates. Hahahahh.Summary excellent."}
{"text":"Had dinner here on a Friday night. It's in an area that looks a little sketchy, but the inside is really nice - I was impressed. Found within a mall, it's an unassuming restaurant. The ample amount of parking was a bonus. A reservation on Friday is a must as it gets quite busy. We arrived at six o'clock and within an hour the place was packed. The menu is extensive with both surf and turf items. It's a little more pricier than other Portuguese joints, but you also get amazing service, a long Portuguese wine list, and a dining area that is nicely decorated.  Good for: Portuguese"}
{"text":"A hidden gem.  This place offers authentic Portuguese food and service.  Exquisitely flavourful and plentiful with a solid selection.  Seafood is fresh and cooked to perfection and flavoured with love.  No items on the menu will disappoint.  Will return."}
{"text":"Wonderful Portuguese restaurant. Friendly and professional staff. We had fish and shrimps. It was very delicious. Very fresh and tasty. They have very smooth and creamy cappuccino. Loved it.  And the freshly baked custard tart was the best I've ever tasted."}
{"text":"TIP: Make a reservation on Fridays and weekends, if you want a table with a tablecloth in the air-conditioned dining room. Otherwise, you can always sit outdoors on plastic chairs.  My sister in law was visiting from Calgary and asked for a Portuguese meal. We could have gone to Chiado but I knew she wanted something more homey and casual. Churrasqueira Martins came highly recommended by a Portuguese friend. He was absolutely right!  We ordered a bunch of things and ate family style.  Chorico sausage arrived, impressively flaming. Grilled calamari was succulent and the lemon garlic sauce was a bread magnet. Roast suckling pig was tender and delicious (loved the spicy dipping sauce). Roast chicken was flavourful and the portion was generous. Bacalhau was tender and enough for 2 people. House wine from Portugal was pretty good.  We ate so much that we had to skip dessert but we had a look at the dessert menu for our NEXT VISIT."}
{"text":"- The food was just okay. I'd never ever go there again. - service was average  - atmosphere was very loud  - prices, I could've got better food for more reasonable prices elsewhere."}
{"text":"It pains me to have to give this place a two star review, because I feel like it at least deserves a three, but I have to be firm. Came here with my (Portuguese) family to treat my mom's boyfriend to a restaurant lunch for his birthday. It's in the area that we live in so it was very convenient. Throughout the duration of our meal, my mother was having forced air blown at her feet through a floor-level vent that would alternate from hot to cold. Probably not the best place to put a table. We all enjoyed our meals for the most part but agreed they were nothing to write home about. I got the chilean sea bass, which still had bones in it. It was served with 'risotto' that wasn't risotto at all, although I guess I should have anticipated that. Portuguese food, not Italian. The rice was undercooked as well, not al dente even. Our server was not friendly or attentive at all. Afterwards we were served by a different girl who brought us coffees and dessert; she was much nicer. I had the passion fruit mousse, which was very delicious and creamy. The biggest reason why I have to give this place a two star is the RIDICULOUS pricing on the menu. I paid $35 for my main dish, when I could have gotten the same thing elsewhere for half the price. My brother got a standard Portuguese dish, bitoque. It's strip steak, fries and a fried egg with some rice on the side, and they charge $22 for it. Unbelievable. I don't know how this place stays in business with these prices. Our bill came out to $160 for four entrees, a small decanter of the house wine, two desserts and two espressos, and that's without tip added yet. Don't get me wrong, that would be fine if the quality of the food made up for the price tag. For what it was, it definitely was not worth the price as most of the food on this menu is fairly standard Portuguese fare, no 'gourmet' ingredients or anything like that. Probably won't be coming here again simply because it is a total rip-off and there is better Portuguese food to be had elsewhere."}
{"text":"The Take-out next door, same place, has the best Grilled Chicken in all of Toronto. Great Portuguese style food."}
{"text":"We came here about 4 months ago and it was delicious. Last night it was very disappointing, we had the soup of the day which lacked flavour and was bland. We each ordered the squid (filled with sand) grouper fish (it was ok) and the cod (watery and tasteless). The worst is that service was super slow and the restaurant wasn't that busy. We literally stayed there for 3 hours because of the longest wait between our appetizers and main dish. Not going back there ever!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, great service and reasonable prices. I've been there a few times and so far can say the grilled octopus and spicy shrimp appetizer are my favourite."}
{"text":"I utilized their catering service for work.  Everyone I asked said the food was \"truly excellent\".  Their delivery service is professional, on time, fast and they provide the items hot, the way they should be.  I have not eaten in their restaurant but plan to - maybe tomorrow!  VERY high standards and it is clear they take an interest in providing quality service."}
{"text":"Having returned from Portugal in love with the seafood made there--whole fish, shellfish, all fresh--we began sampling the Portuguese restaurants around town. This one couldn't be in a more obscure place but that doesn't matter: it's wildly popular and one can see why. The seafood is displayed for all to see and it's fresh, fresh, fresh. Very friendly greeting and help, excellent wine list and even such rarities as fresh Dover Sole (haven't seen that around town very much). Lively guitar player on Saturday night. Excellent experience all around."}
{"text":"Those who visit Martins will discover that this is a neighbourhood gem that they will come back to time after time.   Even though it is tucked away in a rather unspectacular location, the food here is great and has that authentic Portuguese vibe and taste to it.   Reservations are highly recommended for weekends, and i do recommend coming here on a weekend because that is usually the time when they have the grilled octopus main dish - looks intimidating but I guarantee that it is quite tasty. The surf and turf dishes are quite nicely done too.  For a spectacle, order the Portuguese sausage starter for a flame show :)"}
{"text":"We were here last night for dinner didn't have any reservations, the host didn't seem pleased to see us. We were starving we ordered soup of the day caldo verde and the chorico. We also ordered our mains at the same time the caldeirada de peixe and bife a casa. We had sat down at 715pm and we got our soups pretty quickly I was finally brought the wine menu and tried the hOuse red; pretty good medium red. We got the chorico; not bad. After that we waited for about an hour and a bit until we saw our mains but that time we had eaten the whole basket of bread since I mentioned we were starving. We were wondering what was taking so long. The room was full of people this place seemed to be super popular. Large groups of people they even had live music. Once we got our food we were pleasantly surprised the caldeirada came Ina big pot my bf was served three plates he was in heaven although he did say my Tia's tasted better but it was still good. My bife a casa was good came with gravy on the side was salty but I liked it. I had the pasties de nata and it was very warm and not overly sweet like most I wonder if they make that there. The owner came around to all the tables even ours and talked we felt ignored up until we got our mains and then they felt proud to have served a good meal. It's a bit on the pricier side of $$ more like 25-30 for each main we will come back maybe for a special occasion instead hopefully we won't have to wait so long but they should warn you that your main will take over an hour to make"}
{"text":"Probably one of the WORST experiences my group of friends and I have ever had at a restaurant. The servers had such a rude attitude and they didn't seem like they wanted to help us at all. Half of our table of 8 got steaks, medium rare. When they got to the table, half of the steaks were rare to the point where the center was still cold, and the other half was overcooked. When we told our server, she gave us a look and didn't even say anything and just took the plates back. When she came back with the steaks with the \"sorta the correct temperature,\" the steaks were so under seasoned and tough. Some of us got fish and even the fish was under seasoned and overcooked. They never apologized, refilled our waters or tried to go out of their way to see if we needed anything else."}
{"text":"Was recommended by a family friend.   We had the half chicken dinner and the lulas grelhadas (grilled squid) with a pitcher of czechvar (only beer they had on tap). The meal was well cooked and delicious. The chicken was moist, tender and absolutely amazing wit the accompanying sauce. The texture of the squid suited the grilled shallots perfectly. The best part of the meal by far was the heavenly potatoes. We felt they were better than the main dish and the centrepiece of the meal."}
{"text":"I went to this place for the first time about a month ago with a group of 4 adults plus 1 toddler. We made reservations the day before so we could be guaranteed a seat right away (which was an excellent idea because the place was packed!  Our waiter was very attentive and offered great menu suggestions. We got a couple of appetizers to start (Chouriço à Bombeiro) and it was rather tasty. We also got 3 bottles of wine for the table....yup, 3 .. We are Portuguese and clearly love to drink hehe.   I ended up choosing the picana as my main entree but not sure if this a regular on the menu. It was DELICIOUS. It was accompanied by the traditional sides for this, rice, beans and farofa and salad. It was mouth watering and the meat was cooked to perfection. The rest of the table got 2 orders of surf and turd and a Bitoque. The portion sizes were very generous and everyone loved their meals.  The only reason I did not give this place a 5 star was because the tables were so close together and a couple next to us dropped their wine glass and it shattered everywhere (under my feet) and the waiter did not bother to come and clean the glass properly. We had a toddler with us and that could have been dangerous. Not only that, it was fall so I still had somewhat opened shoes and I felt the glass hit my fit. When I reached for something in my purse, I stabbed myself in a huge chunk of glass. The waiter quickly came with a band aid and it wasn't his fault that the glass entered but I would have assumed that they would have perhaps given us something on the house for the disastrous ending lol.  However, despite this..I will 100% return because the food was that good and I loved the atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"Review of the take out/dine in side.  Real  good (half chicken) meal for $12 includes two sides.  The chicken is flavourful, juicy and tender, and while the hot sauce isn't spicy, it is very rich in flavour."}
