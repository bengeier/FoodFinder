{"text":"Overall: Unless I was in the area, I wouldn't go out of my way to go back.   Service: Our food took a while to arrive but they all came around the same time.   Food: I liked the dosa and curries. My mango lassi was room temperature."}
{"text":"Cheap and cheerful.  Been here a few times and service and food quality is consistent. Nothing super special but its not terrible either.  I always get the masala dosa - pretty traditional and standard. Could use more filling because I find myself eating a lot of the wrap at the end and just dipping it into the sauce.   Had the pani puri - pretty good, but not really the best deal for the price - I expect a few more.   Chaat papri was good as well - but again - could have been more generous with the portion size.   Service here is quick - I was seated promptly and the wait staff are attentive, so ordering was quick and easy."}
{"text":"This food here is fantastic! My wife and I eat vegetarian most of the time, and this is one of our mainstay restaurants for take-out nights. But don't let the 'vegetarian' label scare you off, this is just damn good Indian food by any standard.  Our usual order is the aloo paratha (potato bread), masala dosa (dosa stuffed with spicy potato), and the chana masala (chana dal in a liquidy masala sauce with rice). One order of each of those is enough food to stuff two people, for a total of $18.53+tax+tip. Note that's 1 order of each of those, total, not 1 for each person.  I'm docking one star because the service when you eat in is lacklustre to say the least. Most of the time they don't seem to care whether you get water, take your order in any reasonable time, etc.  But the food is good enough to keep me coming back again and again for take-out."}
{"text":"Okay, so the place looks like a cafeteria, but the food is incredible. Every time I go I plan to have something other than the Thali, but just can't seem to bring myself to order anything else... it's always different and it's always amazing. Fortunately I have sampled many other goodies off the plates of my companions and everything was great. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since this place opened.  I was pretty excited by it because there isn't enough South Indian restaurants in this area.  Udupi is a city in the South Indian state of Karnataka which lays the claim as the origin of the masala dosa, and has great cuisine.  And fittingly, Udupi Palace does serve a fine dosa.  Their South Indian Thali though is just above average, which is unfortunate since there is not really any other options that I know of in the area.  But that certainly doesn't stop me getting it when I'm hungry.    The atmosphere is a bit strange, since it is in a large bright banquet hall sized basement and has a lot of spaciousness.  The service is amazing though, in true Karnatakan style, and the waiters are all really nice, and remember me as a regular.  I wish they served their coffee in the traditional little stainless steel cups that are prevalent in South India where you pour the coffee in from a great distance to aerate it.  If someone knows where to get really good South Indian coffee around Little India, please let me in on the secret.  All in all though, I love this place."}
{"text":"A craving for masala dosa led us to this basement restaurant. The place was packed with people of various ethnicities. We got a table right away. We ordered two crispy dosas: one masala and one Mysore. Within 10 minutes, our piping hot dosas arrived. They did live up to the hype. There were small portions of chutney and sambar, which were both delicious. We ordered one more: onion rava dosa. This took a little longer, as the waiter had mentioned. This one was quite fragrant and flavourful. This is a dosa spot that we will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Best DOSA in the GTA! They  been consistently serving yummiest dosa for the last 8-10 years and that is saying a lot for Little India. I've tried Madras Dosa hut and this is WAY better in comparison.   Dosas is always fresh, servers are super friendly and in all the times I've taken friends of all ethnic backgrounds there, everyone has raved about it going back again.  Best bet for masala dosas :  Paper -  for the really crispy dosa, Madras- for spicy and Rava -for  chewy texture and green chili filling. I've been told the thalis are good too but I've never ventured out of dosa.  Now with a little play area for toddlers its great for families too!"}
{"text":"Thanks to Udupi Palace and the amazing efforts of Hubert and his team, we threw the most amazing dosa party for a family celebration last week!! We received such glowing feedback about the dosas from our family who thought it was the best idea ever to have a dosa party!!   Hubert and his team were responsive, punctual and organized for our event. We really appreciated their ability to feed our group of 50 adults plus kids in a very efficient and timely way.   Thank you Hubert!! You weren't joking about your melt in your mouth dosas!"}
{"text":"I arrived here with a date without knowing it was a vegetarian place, so neither of us had high expectations. However, after finishing we now have to up our expectations. Not bad at alll."}
{"text":"Tasty food, good prices, and very fast service. The ambiance is strange - it's kind of like a basement cafeteria with Indian murals painted on the walls. I had a friend once ask if they were in the middle of remodeling. Other than that, I recommend it! My favourite items are the Masala Dosa, the Idli Manchurian, and the Samosa Chaat (vegan style).   Beware: The Uthapam is underwhelming and the Mysore Masala Dosa is extremely hot."}
{"text":"I ordered a large selection of food, wanting to try as much as I could. It's relatively inexpensive for the neighbourhood, and you get the decor that you pay for. It is very much like others have said; a big white hall from the 70's. But the dosas are fantastic!  Seriously delicious. Trust me, if you can handle poor decor in order to eat cheap and cheerful Indian deliciousness, come and check it out."}
{"text":"Our favourite south Indian vegetarian place  The tali plate is fantastic and inexpensive while the dosa's are large and filled with many great options.  Udupi is a vegetarian gem that looks like a prison cafeteria.    We only wish they served alcohol."}
{"text":"Took my friend here for her first South Indian food experience and she's definitely a fan!  We started with the dahivada; this was probably the low point of the meal. The vada was not very crispy and was pretty dense inside.  We also got the masala dosa and vegetable uttapam. The dosa was good, but not exceptional, and the uttapam was amazing. It had a perfect crispy exterior and was soft and fluffy inside...probably one of the best I've had. We ended with south indian coffee which was good as well.    The restaurant itself is a little sparse, but that has been true of every South Indian place I've been to. We were very happy with the service, everything was served quickly and they were very good about topping off my friend's rapidly consumed glass of water :)  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I'm a carnivore and I LOVE this veggy place. Plenty of amazing tasting selections to satisfy even the meatiest of meat eaters. My only feedback would be to refresh the tables and seating as it makes the place appear plain and tired. Even still, it will not deter me from coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Always delicious. Sometimes service is a bit so-so, don't always get the thali tour, but staff are always pleasant. I always feel good after eating here. True comfort food."}
{"text":"Okay. It's a basement. But oh my god the paper dosa is so good! Bring hungry friends."}
{"text":"The best vegetarian South Indian food anywhere near me. Recommend  Medu Vada, Potato bhonda, Tokri Chaat (all chaat items), Utthapam, all Dosas, Chana batura The Thali is a lot of food for me to eat but it's the best deal if you share it. You can't go wrong with this bright, spacious place and quick and friendly service."}
{"text":"Best Indian restaurant in the city, with great vegan and vegetarian options. Hubert D'mello the owner has nailed it with this amazing South Indian cuisine and no wonder, with his years of culinary experience he keeps creating new and impressive vegetarian and vegan meals almost daily. Coconut infused vegan stews that will have you coming back for more. The menu is endless and amazing, starting with the chaats their chana masala the pani pori and amazing bowl of their yellow dhal, just to name a few of your options Such aromatic and spicy flavours with their own special twist, unique to say the least."}
{"text":"awesome! very authentic south Indian food, has fast and good service, big portions - come hungry if you order the tali, and everything I tasted on the menu was really tasty thus far. Really loved it. Please open a branch downtown!"}
{"text":"If you have kids, what a treat! There is a play area near the front of the restaurant, so when the kids have had enough, they disappear to play while the adults can eat in peace! We live in the neighborhood of the India Bazaar, and Udupi Palace is our favorite restaurant. My kids love the gigantic, crispy paper dosas as well as the assortment of lassis and smoothies. I rarely get past the Thali--always different combinations, always delicious--but can vouch for the other dosas and uthapham on the menu as being very tasty. Be forewarned that this restaurant serves no meat or alcohol."}
{"text":"I love this place and eat here very often. The food is wonderful, the takeout is fast, the staff is great if you're dining in, and the prices are great. Their dal and potato dosas can't be beat!"}
{"text":"first thing first. when in south indian restaurant, never try north indian dishes or any other crazy thing. Same goes vice versa, however I have experienced good Dosas in north indian restaurants.  If you are not sure, then only try Dosa or Idli. Uthapam, Thali may not be best option. Mysore Masala has spicy sauce in it. be careful, even though this is my fav. don't try fancy dosas like spring veggie or paneer. Dosa is always good with mashed potatos n saute onions. So a good masala dosa should fill up ur craving and appetite. The portion of the food is not enough for a regular dinner. I see that as a common problem with majority of the resturants in Toronto after moving from US to here. But thats not mean the end of it. There are few good reviews for others too.  The ambience is just to support a visit. However, it may be true for the most of Gerrard street Indian/Paki restaruants.   Hope u enjoy it!"}
{"text":"This place does not have fancy decor, but i imagine it adds to the authenticity of the place. It's not as if the prices would warrant high expectations on decor. I am no Indian food expert - butter chicken is my favourite Indian dish and I know it's almost like ordering chicken balls from a Chinese restaurant, but I know what tastes good, and this place is one of the best Indian places I've ever eaten, AND one of the best vegetarian places I've ever eaten. Everything is so flavourful, you really don't miss the meat. I've been twice now and both times, staff were very friendly and helpful in providing suggestions on dishes and quantity for the table. I had the mango lassi and that was yummy too. Note that there is no alcohol here. If you like bready things, you will love the dosas and other breads. This is a good place to go on a random weeknight, if you shy away from super busy places, reservations or lineups."}
{"text":"My wife and I moved into the neighbourhood almost 2 years ago and still hadn't tried Udupi until this week. We have been missing out!  I had no idea it was a vegetarian restaurant (neither my wife or I are vegetarian), but that didn't matter at all. It was our first time trying what I wanted to call 'breakfast' Indian food - if you wanted to get really basic you could just describe our meal of dosas and uttapam as massive crepes and spicy pancakes. But the food was delicious.  It seemed a little bit quieter than some of the other restaurants we've gone to throughout the Indian Bazaar (but we also ate late, around 9). On this night, we liked the quietness and relaxed atmosphere.  Only reason it doesn't get 5 stars from me is that communication from the server at the end of the meal was non-existent. We sat there for 15-20 minutes after finishing without one look from the staff, so we finally figured out we should just pay on the way out.  Great value, great food. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food. First time visitors but with the help of the waitstaff were able to order an incredible meal at very reasonable prices. Have been back since and recommended to/brought friends."}
{"text":"This is the worst restaurant ever, this place must be given good reviews by people who have never tasted Indian food before. There are some best restaurants in other parts of the city, especially for south Indian Dosa varieties hit the restaurants in Mississauga..."}
{"text":"I returned to udupi palace yesterday with a girlfriend and had a much better experience. We're both gf and my friend has a zillion allergies. The server was happy to answer our questions and knew without hesitating which things were safe.   We shared the idli (rice and bean patties) which were served with two yummy sauces. We then each had a dosa. Yelpers ain't lyin' - the dosa are fantastic! My friend had the paneer masala, which was served much like a wrap. I had the special rava masala dosa, which was delicious but puzzling. It was more crispy, and dotted with holes (like Swiss cheese), and in the middle of the dosa was this yummy pile of potato and onion. I'm not sure how I was supposed to eat it, but I enjoyed tearing off bits of the dosa and using them to scoop up the potatoes.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"f you haven't eaten a dosa, you must head over to Little India and look for Udupi Palace. It may not resemble much of a royal palace with it's basement location that more reminds you of a bare bones banquet hall but seriously, no one comes for the decor!  They know their dosas with a variety of 15  to choose from on their menu alone!  This is even the home of the annual \"Spicy Dosa eating contest\" where every summer, dosa connoisseurs alike gather to gorge on these delicate Indian crepes.  Honestly, this visit to Udupi Palace was an education in Southern Indian vegetarian cuisine!  Now carnivores, there's really no meat on this menu but trust me, once you have tried the different dishes on this menu, you will start to crave them like I do."}
{"text":"Had a great meal at Udupi Palace. Tried the Udupi special; Idli, Medu Vada and Masala Dosa. All the food was great! Fresh, hot and tasty. Finished the meal with a Madras coffee and Sheera.. Perfect Diwali treat for myself :)"}
{"text":"Being South Indian, we know our dosas, and this place didn't disappoint. For starters we got the plain vada's with sambar, they were good but a bit dry. We then ordered a masala dosa and a plain dosa. Both we're delicious, especially the nasal filled one. We loved it so much that we ordered another one!  For drinks we got fresh lime water. For some reason they added masala in them (why ??), but we asked them to change it for the real thing. The service was great.  Overall if you like south indian food this place is a must !"}
{"text":"This is definitely the number one Indian restaurant I have ever been to, and I know I will return there over and over again.  In my experience, this is the best vegetarian place in Toronto, especially for lovers of cooked vegetarian food.   Because it is a restaurant that serves South Indian dishes, be prepared for a totally new culinary experience. The dishes they carry are very different than those you can find at the mainstream Indian restaurants.  Coincidentally, this is also one of the cheapest eat-out places out there. You can be fully stuffed for $13-$15. The bill for two persons rarely exceeds $30.  Perfect for children - they have a place for them to play, as well as a children friendly menu.  The atmosphere is also great. It feels like a dining room. If you dislike posh places that make you uncomfortable making the napkin dirty, then it is definitely a place for you.   The only negative thing that I experienced was the fact that sometimes it might be difficult to get the waiter's attention, but you could say it gives you more time to think and decide."}
{"text":"Great vegetarian restaurant. Love to have fully vegetarian places to make sure that the food does not touch where meat has been cooked. The food is great (sooo many options for vegans), service is fantastic, and everyone is so  friendly and welcoming,"}
{"text":"Wicked Indian food with a twist.  This is a vegetarian restaurant, and they will modify their items to meet Vegan / Jain needs.  For those of you that don't know what Jain food it is they are a group of people that don't eat anything that destroys the plant, so they won't eat potatoes, onions, but they will eat tomatoes apples etc.  We ordered Chole Batura (Chickpeas and Fried Bread), if you have ever had puri's a Batura is a giant sized puri, it is pretty wicked and I beg you give it a try, I think you will be in love.  We also ordered Vegetarian kebabs! They were spicy and cleared my sinuses but it was worth every penny.  And we ordered Manchurian Idli's (Manchurian - This great sauce made out of garlic ginger and vegetable broth, Idli's - Rice pancakes that were deep fried)  I highly recommend any of the above, and the total with a $4.00 tip came to $27."}
{"text":"Great menu, good food. Definitely plan on returning."}
{"text":"Delicious food and extremely knowledgable staff. Friendly quick service and a really interesting vibe that made our first visit a real treat. I put my trust in the hands of our server and let him choose our lunch for us, he was spot on. Bright and vibrant flavours in the paneer, soft yet crispy breads that melt in your mouth and a massive dosa with spicy potato and cauliflower filling. The dips and sauces on the side add an impressive extra dimension of flavour without over powering. This might be the best indian restaurant in the city, I can't say I've been wowed like this in a very long time."}
{"text":"Udupi Palace is a vegetarian Indian restaurant located in Toronto's Little India. It is located in a basement and has a cafeteria ambiance. The decor consists of supposedly Indian murals and paintings. Because it is a basement, the echo makes it rather noisy. You get seated quickly. Water and the menus arrive without much delay, even if the place is busy.   Udupi Palace is famous for dosa and you see them arriving at almost every table. Dosa is a common breakfast dish and street food in India. It is similar to a crispy crepe. There are about 12 types of dosa on the menu. My go to dish is Special Rava Masala Dosa. It is made with rava (semolina) which, unlike other types of dosa, rava dosa doesn't need fermentation. It is stuffed with fillings of vegetables (potatoes, peas and onions) and included sambar and coconut chutney. It was very crispy and there was a generous amount of stuffing. While dosas are the favourite here, there are more south Indian food items on the menu, from uthapams to thalis.   They also offer Indian-inspired beverages like masala Chai, falooda and lassi. Unfortunately, their masala chai didn't have much character. It tasted over-brewed tea and lacked the taste of traditional spices found in masala chai (e.g., cardamoms, cloves, cinnamon, ginger, pepper, etc.).   Udupi Palace is long hailed as one of the best spots for vegetarian Indian food in Toronto's Little India. Although Udupi Palace isn't a fancy place, but it more than makes up for its shabby looks with good food. Service is fast and waiters are attentive. Value for money wise, you get a good deal. It is no-frills good Indian comfort food."}
{"text":"Don't be skeptical about the grubby look of this restaurant - bright lighting, white tiles and chaotic ambiance. This is authentic food in an authentic setting - as good as you can find outside South India. I love Udupi palace's food and I've tried a great variety from their menu. My favourite is the combo meal with an uthappam or a dosa with a side of idli and a vada: I think that's a good value and fills you up enough to result into a satisfactory burp.   They also have North Indian fare such as chhole-bhature, pav bhaji, saag paneer etc. but this is not the place to eat north Indian food (they don't do a good job anyways). The service is friendly and simple, so is their cutlery, table arrangement and the overall look. Enjoy your meal!"}
{"text":"This is hands down, the best indian food I have had since Malaysia. ( Malaysia, especially the west coast is very heavily populated by south Indians. Thali on Banana Leaf for lunch is prevalent , cheap, delicious and very popular.) The food here is completely vegetarian, and full of flavour. My meat-eating significant other was wary at first, and now suggests a trip to Udupi regularly.   The Mysore Malsala Dosa is incredible.  Spicy, not too salty, with the most wonderful coconut dip. Paper thin, lots of filling, perfectly made, always warm. The Saag Paneer is delicious, never oily always fresh. The Chana of the lighter variety and has incredible depth. We have tried other currys and random starters and they were all good as well.  The service is great, very friendly guys and they refill your water glass after nearly every sip. The decor is nothing exciting, but its clean and comfortable enough. Love the tin plates.  Thali is $8.99, dosa is $6-8 or so, Curry (with rice, bread etc) $8-9.  So good. Soo Soo good. we have had takeout, but eat-in is much better."}
{"text":"Very authentic South Indian cuisine. Dosas are very good and the South Indian thali was also. The restaurant could use a little warmer ambience but the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"Food was good. Family had Thali, bhatura, spicy Masala roast. Also had vadai which was horrible. Urud dhal fermented too much so the vadai tasted bad. I was not impressed with cleanliness. The water cup had dishwasher stains in them. The water jug had white stain in them."}
{"text":"Doing some errands and a little shopping therapy.  Stopped by my most favourite Vegetarian restaurant for Pongal, Yellow Dahl and Puri.   The food here is simple, yet so interesting.  I love, as well, that the food here is consistent.  Being a bit of creature of habit, I don't like surprises of foods changing flavour or consistency.  I also don't like to waste my money on bad cooking.  I am so inspired by the food here that I put Udupi on our itinerary, for our trip to India in August."}
{"text":"Lets start with what was good. My husband and sister in law ordered the Paper Masala Dosa. It was beautiful, crispy, paper thin, and from all the raving about it, let's call it great.    One person at our table ordered the Thali, and said it was mostly good, Chappati was mediocre, a little rubbrey, and the assorted fried veggies were nothing to write home about.    My masala dosa wasn't crispy or hot when it arrived at the table.  The potatoes that were in the middle were mostly bland, and tepid.    The most concerning thing was the staff seemed mostly untrained. The waiter that brought our glasses of water, picked up the glasses closer to the top, when he should have picked them up closer to the bottom so he wasn't touching where you'd drink out of.  When we asked for straws, he brought unwrapped straws in his bare hands defeating the purpose of asking for a straw. Some place settings had a knife and a fork and other place settings had a fork and a spoon.  That made no sense to us at all.   The waiter tried to explain to us that their appetizer platter was meant to be shared by people at the table, and that most other people ordered their entree after their appetizer order.  No idea if this guy thought we were completely new to the concept of a restaurant but it was annoying.  We were served by several different people, it seemed chaotic.   This place needs a serious boot camp, I worry there might be some healthcode violations taking place.  I will not be visiting it again, or recommending it to anyone."}
{"text":"Food: Ok  Creativity: Limited  Space: Lot  Price: Ok  Service: Good"}
{"text":"It was a little less than ok.  Got the idli Manchurian, south Indian thali and a Mysore masala dosa.     Idli manchurian- seemed to have bit of a burnt taste but overall it was ok.  It sounded better than it tasted unfortunately. Masala Dosa- Potatoes seemed a bit raw and didn't taste fresh.  Sambhar was ok South Indian Thali- papad was stale.  Rice charu was fine.  Out of towners (Chicago) and vegetarians.  We were excited to get some Indian here in Toronto.  Walked away a bit disappointed."}
{"text":"Having been a fan of Udupi in California, I came here last August 2016 expecting good South Indian food, but it was pretty disappointing. We ordered a thali, an Uthappam, and Lemon Rice. Uthappam was decent, but certain items in thali were stale and hard. Lemon rice wasn't good, and pickle that came with Lemon rice tasted disgusting. Service is pretty bad too."}
{"text":"Not even adding one single star!! Ok I had to add a star to post, so I did. Guys come on .. You are on Gerard street little India downtown Toronto claiming to be a dosa restaurant  !! I ordered a Mysore masala dosa .. It was bland, tasted like bad paper, sambar was like dishwater and btw I got half a bowl of sambar. I asked the server if you add veggies to your sambar, and he said yes they do, but mine had none, so he said he would get me another bowl, and what do I get .. Another half filled, almost cold bowl of dishwater with 2 curry leaves and 1 red chilly!! Those are the vegetables? But aside from that, the dosas were bland, the sambar was bland, the coconut chutney had no coconut flavour at all!! Never going back again. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Pros: Good food (try the dosa of course, it's quite delicious). Decent prices, lots of seating.  Cons: Street parking can be difficult depending on the time of day, the serving quantity could be a bit better. Staff is usually good, but sometimes can be inattentive to patrons.  Went to Udupi Palace after seeing rave reviews on BlogTO and hearing about it from others. Tried both the paper masala dosa and the paneer dosa - both dishes were prepared well, arrived very quickly, and were delicious.  Would I come back? Yes, especially to try other dishes."}
{"text":"We went to udupi palace with friends today, craving good Indian food.   Ambience- 2/5. The place was pretty weird. It din't have a restaurant feel. It was like as if tables were just arranged in a basement hall.  Service - 4/5. Purely because the service was quick.  Food - 3/5. Coming to the main part! We ordered chaat papdi, dahi poori and sambar vada for starters. The chaats were just okay, nothing too special; about them. Then we had channa bhatura, mysore masala dosa and idli. Channa bhatura was really good esp the channa, very flavorful and tasty. The sambhar was not so good, so the sambar vada, dosa, idli was not all that good. Finally we had masala tea and coffee. Cardamom was very overpowering in the tea that the flavor of tea itself was masked. Coffee was good.   Overall, its probably a good place for Indian food but my South Indian palate was not satisfied!!!"}
{"text":"This place is OK for dosas. The price is reasonable, but the masala dosa doesn't come with a lot of chutney's and the ambience is very high-school cafeteria. I prefer Masala dosa hut."}
{"text":"Quick service. Well staffed. The thali is great. Only vegetarian food but a must for everyone who enjoys Indian food. I had been here once before and didn't enjoy it as much. After my recent meal, I feel like the first meal must have just been a one off."}
{"text":"For vegan and strict vegetarians, this place is a good option.  I would recommend going for dosas, and maybe the thali plate if going on your own. it's a nice fill.  If you have a group of you going and you're mixed vegetarians and not, this isn't the best option. I've found more veggie dishes at other indian food restaurants, even those that also carry meat. Overall the food is bread, crepe heavy upatham and dosa's, not many veggie dishes other than 2 curry dishes.  The food was very tasty, we all enjoyed it, the price for 5 was under $75, very reasonable and we were very full, but it would have been nicer to have a broader array of options. That said - if you're going with dosas in mind or for lunch, this place is great.  Nice staff, nice attention to food quality."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for from some killer dosas, I brought the SO to Udupi Palace as he has never experienced a real dosa before.  Udupi is know for one of the best south Indian in Toronto and our visit today they did not disappoint.  Our appetizer mix was a great starter and sampling of the yumminess of fried south Indian goodness.  It was quite filling, we had to make room for our masala dosa.  As mentioned previous, the masala dosa was delish, crispy and with all the various textures and flavours.  They also makes a mean masala chai as well as mango lassi.  Udupi is a place checking out when you are in Toronto!"}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for good South Indian food, Udupi Palace is the place to go. Although a lot of Indian restaurants use the name Udupi rather loosely to attract customers that love South Indian food, this restaurant is a safe bet. Our order of chapathi with korma, and masala dosa were on point."}
{"text":"Toronto's Indian food scene is dominated by the cuisine of northern India, which is a bit like having Italian or French cuisine represented by specialties from northern Italy or France. As a city with a large Indian population, we need more of the variety of India -- a neat way to enjoy a diversity of restaurants which do not compete with one another, but complement one another and really educate Torontonians on what India has to offer. Udupi is adapted for the Indian word for temple town, a term that comes from southern India where such towns are quite common. The food is lighter and more vegetable-based than in the north, and a good way to sample it here is with a dosa combination of mixed vegetables. Obviously, meat goes bad quickly in a hot climate and large animals are also hard to raise in a hot environment, so the heavy emphasis on vegetables -- a theme perfectly in line with a sound diet -- comes from geography, as well as from Hinduism. For the same reason, cheese is't a historic food of a hot climate.  Likewise, the dominance of coconut reflects the souther climate.  By contrast, northern India has foods expressing a cooler climate, as well as increased influence of Persian invaders and travellers. An easy way to measure the lack of Persian influence in the south is the absence of arches in the great temples of the south; what holds for architecture also holds for food systems. This is food genuinely made by a region's unique history and place.  I am a bit disappointed by the cafeteria feel of this place. The servers are all wearing blue jeans and running shoes, which might indicate fusion of canadian and Indian styles or failure to see the opportunity to use an Indian restaurant to put on display the full vitality of the culture that Indian food comes from. I like the way they have provided a children's play space at the front--nice way for kids to enjoy a meal out as much as the adults."}
{"text":"I loved this place. Very nice and pleasant service. The food portions are smaller, however well worth the price. I live southindian food and the food here is perfectly cooked and non greasy. It's slightly far away from downtown, but was well worth the hike.   We ordered cheese dosa, Idli and uttapam. I highly recommend the cheese dosa for the mouthwatering and melt in your mouth flavor. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The quality is not upto much.. neither the chappati nor the butter nan. I was there last year food was so yummy. This year it's zero. May be they change the serving style"}
{"text":"Located on Gerrad Street (desi street) this is quite good vegetarian restaurant.  Service: Quite fast  Restaurant: Was big and had a lot of seating  Food: The menu is quite extensive and I enjoyed their South Indian Thali which comprised 11 things. 2 vegetable dishes, dal, rasam, sambhar, white rice, chapati, yoghurt, pickle, papad and dessert. I loved the concept a bit of everything, kind of like a mini buffet in a round plate.  Parking: You will have to find street parking"}
{"text":"This place has okay dosas. The prices are low and the food quality is average. The idlis are good, dosas are okay and sambas is terrible. I guess if you want a quick bite it's okay. The location is good. Interiors is out dated and more of a dining room style."}
{"text":"I am a total fan. What a great place. We were in town for a day and were treated like family  by every member of the staff and the food was delicious. My partner is a vegetarian, and these are the most delicious treats ever. I couldn't believe how much pleasure dipping the delicate crepe into the dishes was.  Thank you. Mmmmm!"}
{"text":"Yup, this place looks like a basement banquet hall, so be prepared.  The service was very casual and inattentive.  Of course, none of this would matter if the food was great.  It wasn't.  My wife and I shared 3 dishes -   Cashew Pakoras - we'd never had these before, so can't really compare, but they are very dry and dense.  Interesting, though.  Masala Dosa - we weren't crazy about these either.  The potato stuffing was pretty average, but the \"crepe\" was softer than we like it.  We both prefer the crispy variety.  Vegetable Uttapam - this was the first time we tried this dish, and although they were tasty, it's not a dish for which we would rush back.  Having had mango lassis many times before, I thought I would try a sweet lassi after enjoying them home-made by a friend on a few occasions.  Udupi Palace's version is basically a sweet yoghurt shake.  There was no discernible cardamom or rose water (both optional in some recipes), but a disappointing omission, from my perspective.  We would try this place again, but would order different dishes."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is fantastic and you can't beat the value. The servers are very accommodating and always sweet to our kids.   The dosas are exceptional as is their masala chai. My kids love the paranthas, and I'm also a fan of their chili pakoras.  And if you develop a craving, you can always get delivery through Uber Eats."}
{"text":"Udupi Palace is hands down the best South Indian restaurant in the Gerard St. / Little India area."}
{"text":"Service - The service is always good and quick. They are always courteous.  Price - Prices are reasonable. In line (read Saravana Bhawan) or lesser (Guru Lakshmi or Godavari) than other dosa places.  Food - We ordered two dosas - Mysore Plain Dosa and Special Rava Dosa along with wada, idli and pani puri. The Dosas and Wada were good. Sambar was very good. Pani puri was okay but pricey. Idli had a funny smell/taste (it was fresh but still there was some smell in the batter).  In my opinion, it is one of the better eateries on Gerrard street."}
{"text":"Disgusting behaviour by the staff - rude and arrogant - particularly by a man name Alwin Louis. We decided to go here after reading the reviews but the food that arrived was half stale and basically salt less and the other half of our order never arrived. More than our food basically not being served to us (which is basically everything)  the arrogance of this man is truly what got to me. Small people power tripping. It's disgusting"}
{"text":"As many other South Indian places, Udupi is very cafeteria-like in stylings.  I don't know who did the design for all these places, but I'm pretty sure living in south India is much like being an elementary school student and eating at sterile tables with paper streamers and home-made decorations on the wall. I' m not complaining, and I've never been, just sayin'.   Still, I can totally get past the decor when the people are so friendly and the food is so amazing.  I really like Udupi Palace for the Pani Puri- I could do shots of that green liquid!  The Uttapum are really the highlight here. If you've never had a Thali, I highly recommend that, too. I spent my 2nd wedding anniversary here, because we couldn't make it back to San Francisco to eat at Dosa, \"our restaurant\".  Again, it's not fancy, it is just really good. Oh, yeah, my friends were dissappointed in the lack of Alcohol- drink a lassi instead."}
{"text":"People living in towns across North America, and who are blessed only with North Indian restaurants, I'm sorry.  You see, like J.W. I was also drawn to Indian food by my vegetarianism, and have since discoved the joy of dosas and uttapam.  To be honest, I have yet to really tap into south Indian cooking as much as I'd like, but my town has only one and it's not that hot.  So I've had south Indian in Ohio, Chicago, and now in Canada, where I've found my favorite south Indian joint.  We're a pretty predictable pair, and weren't super hungry, so we split a paneer dosa and veggie uttapam.  Both were really good - the paneer dosa has just the right amount of cheese and was perfectly seasoned, and the uttapam had lots of veggies, and the soup of course, oh the spicy soup and coconut chutney that accompany these delights - so nice.  Certainly one of our food highlights, a simple lunch in a great and colorful neighborhood, it really was a near perfect lunch.  Good service, so-so decor, inexpensive and great food.  Wizard."}
{"text":"Pretty mediocre fare...the Thali was lacking in taste,items were half full,curries were tasteless, I can make sooo much better dosa at home...why come here for this very mediocre food ..."}
{"text":"Had wonderful vegetarian Thali here. Delicious food, efficient service and friendly staff. Great value.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"All veggie dishes were the basically same: peas and potatoes. We ordered three different dishes and they all tasted the same. Disappointing."}
{"text":"The restaurant is reasonably priced, and has a vast menu, which for the most part is mediocre as far as South Indian food goes.  That said, they have the best \"South Indian Thali\" that I have ever had in my life (apologies to my Mom, but it's true).  That dish itself warrants five stars in my book, and I will make a special trip to Udupi for this dish whenever I am in Toronto again."}
{"text":"A good place to frequent. The taste stays plain and consistent. Plenty of options to choose from. Friendly staff and good food."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. Their dosas are to die for. I usually take the spicy dosa. They also have gluten free dosas for those that are intolerent/celiac.   The athmosphere is a bit weird. It is a very big room in a basement, but this actually add to the whole experience.   If you are looking for a cheap and delicious lunch, don't hesitate and go to Udupi!"}
{"text":"When I have a craving for Indian, I make a point of heading out to Udupi Palace to get my fill. I believe this is Toronto's only vegetarian Indian restaurant (please correct me if i'm wrong, i'm always looking for more!) and their menu selections offer a great deal for vegans too.  The menu is quite large, so it's often the case where i'll order a lot more than i'll be capable of eating. My usual mistake is trying to get a good variety of appetisers, but many are just too dense or oily in large quantities to have in addition to a main.  The dosas at Udupi Palace are basically what drives me to visit - so many varieties to choose from! And you can get a nice bit of heat with the Mysore dosa. For spectacle alone I generally lean toward a paper dosa. If you can bring yourself to order outside the dosa section, they have a small selection of curries and their breads are amazing. I'm not much of a fan of the Uthapam, I find if I want something heavier i'd rather a curry/bread combo.  The food can be quite rich, but it's definitely great to occasionally calm the Indian food cravings. Surroundings are very basic, but the servers are friendly and helpful and the location smack bang in Little India is easy enough to get to."}
{"text":"We had lunch last week. Had South Indian thali. It was very good. Almost all items were good. Sambhar and rasam were exceptionally good.Great place for vegetarian and South Indian food lovers."}
{"text":"Having \"Palace\" in your restaurant's name and the decor resembling a large basement seems odd but hey, the food is fantastic! My husband and I ordered the Idli Manchurian. It came in a small tin dish on top of a round metal plate.  think we were the whitest people in the restaurant (I'm actually yellow but really white on the inside). We looked around to see if anyone was eating off of plates. We just decided to devour the Idli Manchurian right out of the dish, only realizing after that there were metal plates under the dish. duh! The Manchurian dish was my absolute favourite. Crispy on the outside and a delicious garlicky glaze sauce on the outside. I think my eyes were bulging out of my head when i had my first taste.  We ordered the saag paneer and the spring dosa. The saag paneer comes with a small dish of rice, pickle, chapati, yogurt and papad. quite a good deal! I'm not sure which was which (chapati/papad) but one was crispy and thin and the other was thicker and chewier. The spring dosa was good but a touch too greasy. The dipping sauce was pretty tasty too! I'm not sure what the second dipping sauce was but it was porridge-like and grey. It tasted better than it looked. The 3 dishes was perfect for two people. We could've ordered an appetizer but I think we would've been aching so I'm glad we stopped when we did. I would love to come back and try the kofta!"}
{"text":"This place used to be THE place about 15 years ago but it's lost its sparkle. I think it now caters to a crowd that's largely not geared towards it's native south Asian population. And that kind of changes things.  And it's disappointing to write this review.  The dosas were not the greatest and the typical side dishes of sambar and chutney were not good. The service was okay and the food came out quick. The poori and curry was decent overall.   Perhaps their apps and 'chaat' items will be better   It's been years since I came to Gerard street since the south Asian community now ha many restaurants, clothing stores spread out across the GTA. So I expected it to be good. And it was just okay. Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Dahi poori on point. Dosas on point. The tali is the star of the show. Honeslty, in my opinion, this is the best Indian restaurant in Toronto. I'll be coming here as long as I live in this city. I have been for at least 7 years and I've yet to be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been going to Udupi for over 15 years. Its by far the best Dosa I have found in Toronto.   I tend to generally get the same things when I go; The masala dosa and the veggie thali. If there are more than two of us i'll add in a second dosa and the mixed appetizers or even an extra main veg dish. The thali varies depending on the day and you can ask what is in it that day in case there are things you don't like you may be able to swap it out. the soup that comes is amazing always. The spice level varies depending on who is the main cook. Sometimes its very hot but generally its spicy but not super hot.  I have gone with someone gluten free and the dosa was certainly not as good. but gluten free is specific and when the main part of something is the dosa best to try some other options as well.  They have some special stuff for kids and are vegan friendly. I would highly recommend the food here.  The decor is a bit unusual. Its a kind of cafeteria style dining experience in that its one big sparsely decorated mostly white room with tile floors and an abundance of tables and chairs. They do serve you though so not cafeteria in that way. They have many wall murals that are interesting to say the least. The noise level can get intense when its full as the sound echo's and reverberates. and often there are kids running around.  the staff is generally quite friendly and when you ask questions they are always ready to help. You could have a very big group here as well as they will put a bunch of tables together for you.  I have once gone on Christmas day and had a wonderful experience. They even have a Christmas Dosa done up like a decorated tree in a case. what more can I say??? this place is really a very special vegetarian landmark."}
{"text":"This is the real deal. Udupi food made in a restaurant run by a Mangalorean family. The uttapams are perfect. The masala rava dosas are a crisp crunchy bite of spicy urad dal heaven. And then I love the walk they've taken on the wild side - Indian Chinese Udupi style, with Idli Manchurian and Schezwan Kotfa. But the crowning glory has to be their unique Tokri Chaat. Imagine poutine married to bhelpuri. Well, this is their beautiful, brilliant child. Go and tell Hubert (the owner) that Gavin sent you. Other favourites of mine: upma, poori bhaji, pav bhaji."}
{"text":"Came in here while I was waiting for band practice. The waiter recommended the . SOUTH INDIAN THALI, for 9 bucks.  It came with two vegetables, Dal, Rasam (south Indian Spicy Soup) Sambhar (Veggie Stew) White Rice, Chapati, Yogurt, pickle, Papad and dessert.  It was very filling and I enjoyed the spice of everything, especially the Rasam and some of the veggies. The papad and nan were also very nice. The ambiance is kinda strange but the place is very clean and the service very good. I want to go back and try the Dosa."}
{"text":"The decor is super dated and the strangest kind of tacky but it seemed like there were a lot of late night dates over dinner here. I'd say it's standard vegetarian Indian food; it wasn't amazing but it wasn't awful either. My spice tolerance is pretty high and there were a couple of things that made down a few glasses of water. There were also a few fusion dishes like Manchurian idli and Sichuan dosas. (Didn't get to try those so I'll leave that for next time)    Things I had:  -Got a falooda but it came with vanilla ice cream and not kulfi as stated in the menu. :(  -The Assorted Palace Hor-d'oeuvres is super filling. Definitely needs to be shared and even then it's just a lot of starch to eat.  -Thali is always my go-to when I was to try a bunch of different things. There were a couple of spicy dishes in there but a yogurt to offset that. Definitely a substantial meal for one person. (I definitely couldn't finish one on my one) It also comes with something sweet to finish on!"}
{"text":"Udupi Palace doesn't look like much from Gerrard Street. In fact, it doesn't look like much from the inside, either. But if you venture in, you'll find the best dosa in Toronto. The Masala Dosa is my favourite. Filled with savory potato and onion, it's a carb feast as big as your head! I'm not kidding-- actually I have a tiny head, so perhaps literally as big as YOUR head. Served with ever so slightly sweet coconut chutney and sambar. The Chilly Cheese Dosa is also nice. Not as large and filled with chilies and paneer. I also love the Rasam here. I ask for it extra hot and they actually do it! Most Indian places I go to take one look at my extra white-ness and laugh when I ask for stuff SUPER HOT! No one believes that a white chick like me could survive it. I always do. And I ask for more.  Torture and endorphins aside, the value is good here and the food is even better. They also host a hot dosa eating contest. I believe it's some time in the summer. Hmm... something for Jenny to keep in mind..."}
{"text":"Worst service experienced in an Indian restaurant at    City of Toronto. One server was taking  an orders for 5-6 tables at a time and he was not able to move the order in to the kitchen. Food is okay, didn't met the expected taste and quality. Never revisit and I don't recommend to my friends."}
{"text":"A wise friend introduced me to this spot, claiming it's one of the best restaurants, if not the best restaurant in Little India, and I have come to agree.   The decor is strange, sort of school cafeteria in a basement, and despite the lovely greenhouse windows I never see the sun in this place, but the food is incredible, the service is personable and attentive, and the atmosphere is relaxed and welcoming.   I've spent hours here chatting with friends, I've come alone and felt perfectly welcome, and I've come to the point where their paper masala dosa calls to me on a somewhat regular basis."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times.   Although in fairness, many a time I had walked by this locale and the whole: having to walk downstairs, somewhat over simplistic vibe, and uninspired decour had discouraged me from going in.   Specially since I am not Indian and my overall knowledge of what constitutes true \"authentic\" restaurants in this hood is somewhat limited, aside some tried and true spots.   As such, when in the hood, which normally implies that I would be with a guest or a with a party, for their sake, I always opted to avert this locale due to the risk of a bad meal due to my curiosity.  However some of my Indian friends have taken me to this place since then, mostly because they like the selection of the menu which is quite extensive for what I have been told plus a number of vegetarian dishes (I normally come here with vegetarian friends) that I generally do not served in other South Indian restaurants like dosa. Although personally, I have to admit, the food is good but it did not WOW! me.    It was good and I would go again but I give it one more star simply because although the decor is on the simple side, they always seem to have plenty of space. Also, most of the clientèle is generally DESI so that is always a great sign.  I still feel that I will come back but to really get the full experience I generally will come with someone who knows the cuisine a little better than me."}
{"text":"my first time there was with someone who knew what to order.. i was not disappointed.. i have been back many times with other friends.. the staff are always super friendly and helpful.. the food is delicious.. the prices are great! and the quality and quantity are bang for you buck! and the bathrooms are super clean!   i can't remember the names of the dishes i had but it's all good there!!"}
{"text":"The staff is very attentive at this gigantic cafeteria of a restaurant, but don't let the decor fool you the food is authentic and tasty especially since they added manchurian iddly...Yum!"}
{"text":"Standard Udupi place. Nice people, the interior is spacious."}
{"text":"Amazing prices! Also the best thali I've had and I was pleased that it can be made vegan and gluten free unlike many other restaurants. I loved that there were so many different items, and that it included two kinds of breads as well as rice and halwa for dessert! I haven't had vegan halwa in almost a year and I'm so glad I was able to fins a place that makes it vegan. My boyfriend had the vegetable mutter which also tasted really great and also included rice and the two breads (at other restaurants you usually have to pay extra for these items. For appetizer we had the samosa chaat which my boyfriend was pleased to see since he hasn't had it since he came four years ago from Nepal.   Great service and food comes quite quickly."}
{"text":"We've been here twice, once about five years ago and again a month or so ago. I love the 'scene' here. Families eating, kids running around, plates with improbably big dosas - looking like wrapped flowers - being delivered to every table. And the dosas are great. Everything we've had here has been tasty. Try a chat. We had a samosa chat and it was a winner. I think we need to go here a couple more times to really give the menu a deeper going over. We always look longingly at patrons who have ordered the thali (in all the Southern Indian places we go) but we don't want to miss out on the dosa.  Udupi Palace also holds a soft spot for us since it was one of the first times we ever had dosa. Since then we spent some time in Jersey City where there is a huge South Indian community and some of the best dosas that can be had in the Americas. So it definitely holds it own against some heavy hitters."}
{"text":"Gluten-free review:  This place is completely vegetarian and has a mountain of gluten-free and vegan options. They have a number of gluten-free dosas and curries to choose from. If you've never had a dosa before, you can't go wrong with a masala dosa. Make sure you specify that you want a gluten-free version since the batter they use is different than their regular dosas.   I also highly recommend the lassi. I usually get the sweet lassi but if you're parched then get the salt lassi. It's not super salty, don't worry.  My only issue with this place is the service. People are friendly but the wait staff are so disorganized. Instead of assigning waiters to different zones, they all seem to try to tag team each other, which they often fail at. So if you're ready to order and stop someone walking by they will go try to get the official order taker (who sometimes takes the order for all the tables in the restaurant, and there are a lot of tables!) so you end up spending way more time than you should just having to place an order. The last time I was there I needed a to-go box and I kid you not, I had to ask at least 5 different people before I got one. The rest would say ok, go into the kitchen and never return. So weird...and annoying.   My advice: don't come here if you're in a rush. If you have time to kill then kick back and enjoy the food.  TL;DR lots of gluten-free options, get the masala dosa, staff are disorganized and waste time"}
{"text":"Outstanding Thalis and Dhosas!...this is inexpensive and very authentic South Indian vegetarian fare!...best in this part of town!"}
{"text":"Very interesting decor. It resembles a cafeteria or something similar. I wasn't a huge fan of the food, but then again I prefer non vegetarian dishes. They were very flavourful and presented nicely."}
{"text":"I've been to this great masala dosa spot on the Gerrard St. strip several times over the past few years for weekend brunch. I usually come with a friend and am seated right away, served water promptly and checked on periodically. In other words, the service is decent. This past weekend, I was flying solo and was pretty disappointed.   I was seated conspicuously away from other diners - not sure if this was deliberate, it could just be my paranoia. I ordered my usual masala dosa and South Indian coffee. My dosa arrived promptly, but my coffee didn't and I had to flag down a waiter for it. When the coffee arrived, I was asked when I wanted my thali - a dish I had not ordered! I clarified that I was here alone and am not in the habit of eating two entrees. Sadly, I was pretty much ignored for the rest of my visit.   All this being said, the food quality was as good as usual and the coffee hot. I'm sure I'll be returning, but probably not alone. I'm sad to say that solo diners are not respected here!"}
{"text":"We sat there for about 20 minutes before giving up and leaving. Being ignored in a new place you like is bad, I'd get it if it were busy, but it wasn't, there were guys putting out silverware not taking our order. Oh well, the buffet across the street appreciated our money, sadly, we wont be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely love Udupi Palace - delicious and great value. I have been here multiple times - for thali, dosa an a la carte style curry options. Even non-veg lovers will love this place. Must haves:  1) Special Bhonda appetizer  2) Kadai Bhindi - Okra dish is SO good  3) Dosas and Thali - always a solid option  4) Chai (Masala)Tea - A must for this cardamom-laden treat   I love that you can also customize your spice level. As a lover of spicy food I am often disappointed at a lot of the non-authentic Indian restaurants, where the food is quite mild. Udupi provides the option for mild, medium and hot.   This is my go-to spot for a quick, delicious, economical and flavourful meal."}
{"text":"Called Udupi Palace at 353PM to verify if they deliver and if they deliver to my home address (specified exact address and intersection).  Spoke with all of my guests to see what they wanted and called back at 404PM to place a large order.  Placed the entire order and provided contact information and address again only to be told, oh sorry, we don't deliver to your address, the driver says it is out of our delivery area.  My address is 12 minutes away as per Google map.    When I explained that I had specifically called earlier to check if delivery to my address was possible, I was told a) that the person who initially answered the phone had no business answering the phone as he was new and b) that I am lying and did not provide my address on the initial call.  Terrible rude and unprofessional customer service - look elsewhere for a restaurant."}
{"text":"This is by far the best dosa joint in Little India.  Although the best dosa's are in the 'burbs, if you are looking for some quality close to downtown, then head over to this place.  The place has a cafeteria feel to it, with bright lighting and cheap seats, but thankfully that is where the \"cheap\" stops.     The service is always friendly, quick, talkative, and informative about the menu.  I usually have the masala dosa, but the last time the waiter suggested the paneer masala dosa.  The food arrives very quickly and the bring out a decent selection of sauces and chutneys for dipping.  The dosas always fresh and crispy are almost comically large, but once you taste them, you are laughing with joy at having so much dosa to eat.  I'm never disappointed with this place, and I highly suggest it.    p.s. The dosa pizza is actually very good!! (Flat, round dosa topped with veggies and cheese)"}
{"text":"Awful place!!! Udipi is a misnomer for this Indian restaurant !!!! I being indian I know what exactly how udipi food should be, We went to have lunch and ordered veggie thali. They served it pretty quickly(the only good about this place to write . Avoid this place if you can."}
{"text":"Good decent staff...  Faluda : is not faluda is just milk and ice cream  Bhel: soggy didn't seem fresh  Rava masala dosa: no crowd still took 15 mins, but worth the wait.  Ok ambience, generator /AC noise, utensils bieng banged in the background, old songs playing in the distant background in the kitchen...  Pricing is cheap..."}
{"text":"Very tasty indian food. The staff is also very courteous, Helpful and the food comes fast and steaming hot. It's a very basic set up inside but I promise you the food is so worth it. Also not extremely overpriced. Check them out"}
{"text":"One of my best friends from my old life in California was visiting me in Toronto a couple of years ago and we went here on the first night since he is vegetarian, loves Indian food and the restaurant is a manageable walk from my apartment.  I had been wanting to try it for years and am glad I did.  I can't remember what I had but the menu was extensive and I was very satisfied with my choice.  So was he.  I think perhaps the only thing missing might have been more explanation for us white boys (and girls) that don't always know what things are in Indian cuisine.  It was certainly a good value.  The restaurant was quite clean and service was fine.    I am unsure if I would make a major commute out for this place but if you are in the area, this is fine place for one of those Friday night, casual dinners with your S.O. or friends.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The decor doesn't look fancy, the chairs are something you might find at an old banquet hall, and the interior looks like it has been upgraded for some time but that's not the appeal or the reason you step into Udupi Palace.  Their \"signature\" item is the big paper dosa which is a large rice paper pancake rolled into a cone so big you could use it like a megaphone.    The place is entirely vegetarian and there is lots on the menu for any intrepid person to sample and taste.  I ended up getting their south Indian thali meal which consisted of two vegetable dishes and an assortment of different types of curries (dal, rasam, etc) along with rice and a chapati.  It was so filling that I had trouble finishing everything.  To me, it was a sampler and had dishes that were sweet, savory, and spicy.  Service is kinda hit or miss at this place, there isn't any real system but I mean you can just try to flag someone down.    I think next time I would either get one of the dosas (rice crepe) or uthapam (Indian style pancake) as they seemed to be popular and my tablemates' uthapam smelled quite tasty.  These items seem great to share across the table too especially the paper dosa.  Until next time Udupi Palace."}
{"text":"Udupi surely did live up to the vast menu selection as posted on their website. When I walked into this Palace dawned on me that this might actually be a hall. It was huge! But the place was packed!   The boys took excellent care of us and our group - a great location for large family gatherings! Very attentive to everyone's needs!  This place is also very affordable. The group as a whole ordered a variety of dishes to share. They are on the small side, but we managed to order enough to make up for it.  We tried the Masala Dosa, Mysore Masla, Pizza Uthapam, Idli, Banana Lassi, Chat Papri, Sag Paneer, Rawa Masala and Pineapple Lassi. The Vegetarian cuisine never tasted better! I am just glad I wasn't the one that ordered...as it can be very confusing!   It was well worth the $20 is spent, and would definitely recommend the Palace to anyone looking to explore South Indian Cuisine!"}
{"text":"I had been to Udupi Palace once before, while on the UYE Little India crawl. I'd totally forgotten about it until I logged onto Yelp this morning and noticed that Kat T had a ROTD for this place, and I thought to myself: \"Self! Let's go to Udupi Palace for lunch today!\" Luckily, self (and my husband) agreed.  I'd forgotten that Udupi Palace was a vegetarian joint. As a meat eater, this made me a little bit disappointed, but once I stuffed my eager piehole with delicious dosa, I'd forgotten all about the lack of tasty animal. My husband and I split the Masala Dosa, which was huuuuuge but a little skimpy on filling.   For my entree I decided to go North Indian and have the Matar Paneer, which was excellent. A little lacking in peas, but plenty of cheese and spicy sauce.   Yum. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is a slightly revamped version of what I posted on another review site. I leave Toronto and this was my favorite restaurant during my 8 day stay:  I've always told Americans who think they want to go vegetarian that many Americans I know who tried it and quit gave up because they made or ate such bland dishes or perfunctory vegetarian cooking. I always tell them about the wonderful Indian vegetarian food I tried and got to love when I lived in New Delhi for two years during the early to mid 70s. I have remained a huge fan of Indian food...non vegetarian as well. While on a national tour in my role as an entertainer, I felt I was getting a cold and also had bad inflammation on my right hand. I was so happy to find this place when searching on line and I went -- and had the VERY BEST t vegetarian Indian meal I have had in my LIFE.   Now, realize: I lived in India, I've had Indian food in the US for some 40 years and done events in San Diego where Indian families invite me to eat. I also lived at the home of an Indian family for five months in New Delhi when I was a student. To me, this is the perfect restaurant. The initial waiter I got answered my questions perfectly about some of the dishes and helped me order so I didn't over order or under order. It was on person, except for when I brought the star of my show (pictured below) out. And he's made out of wood (I'm a ventriloquist).   First, I had the most WONDERFUL samosa I've had -- as good as the ones I had in New Delhi coffee houses in 1972. Ny favorite dish, bindi. They had Kadai Bindi, which they told me was a curry of okra, tomatoes and onions. I figured the okra would be a bit firm and spicy like the others I've had over the years. I asked about soup and he mentioned a \"hot\" soup Rasam, that I had never had. And REAL chai (not the ones they serve at coffee shops in the US or you buy in pre-mixed tea bags). The verdict? The Samosa was an immediate smash and I inhaled the two of them, using the sweet redish sauce and the spicier green sauce. The soup was the BEST and HOTTEST but more flavorful soup I've ever had - and I'm someone who makes lots of soup including chicken soup. Two pieces of red chili were floating in it.   Sorry, my grandmother and mother (and me), I liked this BETTER. The bindi? The best I've ever had.The chai? Exactly as good as the chai they used to serve when I was interning as a student on The Hindustan Times. I later asked manager Peter John about the dishes, particularly about the soup. And, not having told him my maladies, he noted that this soup has ginger, curcumin, pepper, chilies, and garlic (you could see the thin slices in the soup) and it could clear your chest. YES: these ingredients are not only what are recommended for colds, but they are considered anti inflammatories.   I wish this restaurant was in my home city of San Diego...There's also a nice, cozy, open feeling to Udupi Palace. But here you have great waiting staff, great service, superb food, nice atmosphere (some parents with kids as well), and a friendly manager. Udupi Palace is a big, shining diamond in Toronto's Little India. I was so taken by it I asked Mr. John if he'd let me get some photos of him to post on this review and also have him take a few of me and the star of my show. HIGHLY H-I-G-H-L-Y recommended. And if you're someone who thinks vegetarian food can't be as satisfying or moreso than meat, you're in for a huge and happy surprise."}
{"text":"I was originally introduced this restaurant by a group of my yoga teachers. They are all vegan I believe. I am not a vegetarian, but have no discrimination against vegetarian food and I love Indian cuisine, so I gave it a try.  Udupi's food - is South Indian, which I understand is less creamy compared to North Indian (sorry for my poor description I'm not an expert). I love creamy Indian food such as butter chicken, but Udupi's not-so-rich food wins over it with the complex blend of the spice. It make an amazing harmony with the vegetable ingredients, kudos to the chefs.   I order South Indian Thali - which you get a number of staple plates, yogurt and a desert. More of the same variety each time, but I never get bored after visiting there over 10 years. Cost effectiveness, friendly service adds to the goodness of the food. This is absolutely the best Indian restaurant in Toronto, in my opinion."}
{"text":"This was apart of the UYE Little India Crawl: Burn that Dosa! (Many thanks to Roma :D)  Tried the Idli Manchurian - yuuuuum. I got several comments on the very scent of this dish as it wafted around the table. Mouthwatering? Yes.   At first I was rather skeptical at the size (pretty small, imho) of this dish but it was exceptionally filling. Almost couldn't finish!   Having read the other reviews, I'd love to come back to try the other options on the menu, e.g. Tokri Chaat (via Gavin), Mysore Malsala Dosa (via Jennifer M), Pani Puri (via Kat T.),  South Indian Thali (via Krishna N.) and much much more!   The decor ain't much but wow, the service was really good (the servers are very attentive): our waters were constantly being refilled. Plus, they dealt well with our some 15 person group, :)."}
{"text":"Love it! This place is wicked.   For any vegetarian, this is great. They have a whole variety of food you can go regardless of your mood. Not only do they have the dosa and idly like other South Indian food restaurants but they have curries and tandoori foods like kababs.   One of my favourite things to eat is the idly manchurian. Fried idly in a manchurian sauce is to die for.. almost.   I have had a bunch of stuff and can't recall it all, but the other thing we like to get when we go is the Chana Batura. (I must have a thing for fried food... yum!).   As others have mentioned, the atmosphere is a bit like a cafeteria, but once you have been a bunch of times, you barely notice it... it just feels comfortable.   The service is very good. They are very good at refilling your water and leave behind a menu after they have taken your order.   The biggest downer for me is finding parking. There are spots where an hour is free but trying to find them and navigate there can sometimes be a challenge for me.  Definitely worth a stop... especially for the vegetarian friends."}
{"text":"One of the very few places to have delectable & scrumptious dosas in Toronto !!! An original dosa place with an Awesome staff always welcoming with huge smiles  A must visit for vegan and vegetarian dishes !!!!"}
{"text":"Ok- I see a lot of mixed reviews about this place and I think I know why. If your not married to a southern Indian, and you don't have a mother-in-law that cooks amazing southern indian food; well, I could see why you would give this place 4 stars. I'm Latin and I can make much better Sambar and Rasam than they do. So watery and with no flavor- and that's ALMOST impossible with Indian spices, unless you're a really bad cook. And who screws up papadums? Twice they've been somewhat soft and stale. The first time I was dissatisfied, I thought maybe the chef wasn't feeling it that day, but the second time 5 months later?   Roger- we have a problem."}
{"text":"I was arranging a Christmas party in my home and wanted a Vegetarian restaurant to deliver the food. Believe me, the ONLY vegetarian restaurant in the city of Toronto who will deliver is Udupi. Hubert the catering manager was very helpful , professional and above all delivered an absolutely delightful tasty meal with no mistakes and including everything we discussed. I want to congratulate Udupi and Hubert on a job well done. We will call on you again"}
{"text":"5-Star dosas : Good dosas and diverse dosa menu. I would say dosas are @ right price for most extent.    2-Star service: There was no service other than serving our order. We were trying to shout out for chutneys but no one attended us. They were few customers but service managers were least interested in serving customers. Finally one servicing person came to us and got our chutney request but never got the chutney to us. We never got our chutneys! dosas without chutneys are like junior chicken without ketchup.  2-Star for tipping: Almost compulsory high tipping for no service The visa machine shows options in such a way you would tip very generously. good trick but cheap one."}
{"text":"This restaurant belongs in that \"I can't believe I haven't yelped it yet\" list. More like \"Madras Dosa Hut\" than \"Saravanaa Bhavan\", Udupi Palace fills the gap for a decent Masala Dosa in the little India neighbourhood*.   I appreciate the nod to authenticity here, as the dishware and flatware is all stainless steel and the service is efficient and hospitable during busy hours.   I recommend the Masala dosa, their onion dosa, (though the onions are raw!), and their idli, though I do agree with Marilyn in that their rasam is a little on the watery side.  Having taken a glimpse at some of the photos, it seems like I ought to try other dishes for a change. Their thali looks like it could give Saravanaa a run for their money.    ----- *If you're not a tourist you'll know that Little India is definitely not home to the better Indian restaurants in Toronto."}
{"text":"Yummmmmmy!  I had the special something masala dosa, and my friend ordered the cheese and tomato dosa.  Yum.  We also had the onion pakora and veggie samosa - really good, and all for less than $30 (a little over $30 with a good tip).  Check it out...the decor doesn't look like much, but it smells and tastes delicious!"}
{"text":"They had put up a live counter for a party and it was just amazing. The food was delicious, the service was flawless, and the price was reasonable too. Will hire them again"}
{"text":"Pros: decent pricing, somewhat good food, fast service Cons: dirty restroom, restaurant really needs renovation, dirty tables and chairs Staff: friendly  Food: ordered a thali, not all the dishes were fresh. Some of them I think we're leftovers from previous day. Chat was sub standard(bad decision ordering chat in a South Indian restaurant)"}
{"text":"Awesome food everytime! Great service, friendly and accommodating staff! Atmosphere is deceiving. Looks empty and uninviting, but this place is always filled with local Indians and their families. Everything is delicious!"}
{"text":"Food wasn't that flavourful or great. Chutneys are often repeated, and a lot of flavours are repeated as well. For example the appetizer platter all tasted the same.   Didn't help that I got diarrhea the next day.   Why all the positive reviews is beyond me. Won't be coming back here.   It's a shame, the people that work there are nice."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout and was given only half of my order.   If you order takeout from here, be sure to double-check your order (or wait around indefinitely to see if you have any additional bags sitting in the kitchen, which is what they told me I should have done)."}
{"text":"Oh my, where to start.  (Ok, start with the Dosas.) Incredible vegetarian food; I may yet convert to the green side. Atmosphere is bowling alley, but who's looking when you have such delicacies on your plate... Did I mention the Dosas? Bring your appetite and earplugs, if it's a busy day."}
{"text":"This has been my go to place whenever I feel like eating dosa and hot medu vadas! This place literally looks like a South Indian wedding hall. The decor is very minimal. They have random half-finished paintings on the wall. It also seems like they got most of their cutlery and dishes from India. Anyway, that doesn't matter much since the food is amazing! The medu vadas and idlis are always piping hot. The dosas are nice and crispy. They also have a nice combo option for a few dosas so that you can get a plate of vada and idli with them. And since I am a vada fan they don't have any qualms with replacing my idli with a vada. If you have even the slightest idea what an authentic South Indian place should be like, you know that the real stars apart from the deep fried savoury delicacies are the condiments...the chutney and the sambhar. I am biased towards chutneys a bit more and the coconut chutney they serve with all their dishes, while not the best, is just acceptable. The sambhar is better though but I guess I just have a higher bar on those. The place is located in Little India. As soon as you get down from the Gerrard tram you will get a lovely scent of spices and it does really feel like India with all the Saree stores around you."}
{"text":"Oh yeah!. You want to taste and feel India. Here's the place. Down to earth, unpretentious, cafeteria like atmosphere, with seating arrangements changing by the minute, kids and family thoroughly enjoying themselves, just like most places in India. Oh, and the food is awesome. I can't begin to know where to start. Just go and experience a fantastic culinary force. Not for those into formality, dress codes and chi chi."}
{"text":"As a South Indian, I must say the food here was sorely lacking in taste, quality and general hygiene. I ordered a South Indian Thali. The food tasted stale and flavorless and the silverware didnt feel properly washed. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Went in with high expectations based on the reviews here, but left a little underwhelmed. The portions were quite small, and at least 1 member of my party sent back for more dosa filling because there was hardly any in his masala dosa. I had a paneer dosa which was a special on the day, but had to order another owing to the small portion size. Having said that, the taste of the dosas themselves were fine (if not spectacular) and the staff are extremely friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"We had chai, veda with sambar and coconut chutney and masala dosa. We really liked this place. The servers were fast and friendly. Lots of other diners enjoying all sorts of family meals. Most seemed to come in, order their faves, devour them and head back out onto Gerrard. I cannot wait to go back! Another reviewer commented on the kitchen noise. We heard some noises, but nothing that would've changed our mind about the food. We'll definitely return for buttery masala dosa goodness."}
{"text":"Udupi Palace happened more as an afterthought. It was chosen after someone in our group asked \"... How about this place?\" and I went in with little expectations. If anything, I was a little disappointed to realize that dinner was going to be Vegetarian, because, I don't know, I guess I felt sad knowing a delicious animal had temporarily escaped me...  Oh right, let me do that thing where I list my credentials so that my review will carry some extra... \"heft\" to it.  1. I'm Indian. Take that white people reviewers! 2. I'm South Indian. Take that North Indian reviewers! 3. I'm Keralite. Take that... whomever that excludes...   Who am I kidding? Those credentials mean squat in Toronto...   The food was pretty good. The poori masala, and channa batura were both enjoyable, albeit super greasy (I'm well aware I'm talking about deep fried deliciousness so I should expect greasy, but there was an extra level of greasiness, even to the masala). There was also a dosa special on the day we visited Udupi, but when requested, the server said that it wasn't available. My mother and mother-in-law were with me, and they both weren't havin' none of that. They both communicated their feelings of disappointment in something being advertised all over the place, but not being made available when requested. The staff kind of shrugged their shoulders, but then what appears to be the manager showed up with a plate of the special dosas specifically for the two ladies in our group. The cheese dosa was whatevs, but a number of people at our table(s) enjoyed that. The chai was really weak and pretty disappointing. The coffee was good, but tasted like Bru. It probably was Bru...  Overall the experience was enjoyable. Are there better places in town? I'm sure there are, but Udupi Palace does reasonably well. Customer service was lacking initially; we were ignored for a good while by all servers after being seated, but after we managed to get someone's attention (as well as getting an earful from two Indian mothers about a dosa special), things turned around pretty quickly. If nothing else, I've learned that if I'm told I can't have something, I need to sic my mother or mother-in-law on the person who said no to me."}
{"text":"Went with Blog TO's rating as the best place to get dosa. Host was unfriendly, we waited 10 mins after getting menus as servers kept walking past us. Finally I waved to the host who appeared quite annoyed to cone to our table. 20 mins in with a half empty restaurant and we finally got to order.  Average food at best, 'best dosas'? Not even close."}
{"text":"I had had such a craving for South Indian food...for weeks, no months, no like a year I had been craving South Indian food.  South Indian food full of spices that challenge and delight the tastebuds and foods that have been cooked for many hours more than I'm willing to cook at home.  The FOOD here is authentic, cheap, and well-spiced.  I had a Mysore masala dosa ($6.65) which was lovely in its heat.  The one thing that was slightly odd was that the hot paste was smeared all over the dosa rather than being incorporated into the masala mix.  It was served with the standard coconut chutney and a moderately spicy sambhar.  I actually made this into a combo ($9.99) which came with a start of idli, a medhu vada, and more sambhar/coconut.  The medhu vada was pretty unexciting, but then again, I think it always might be.    We also had the South Indian thali ($9.65), a collection of 8 small dishes served with 1 chapati and a small dessert.  Almost everything was universally excellent and the portions were generous...although 1 chapati wasn't quite enough for us.   The DECOR is cheap and slightly tacky.  The space reminds me of a small town church basement decorated with Indian kitsch and playing Bollywood hits.  You should get the picture.  SERVICE was friendly when it existed, although it didn't exist that much.  Practice your best Chinese restaurant vigorous arm waving to get attention.  At the end of the meal, just walk to the front to pay...no one will pay attention to you once your food has been delivered.  OVERALL, this place is quite a find.  Authentic, spicy, and cheap.  What more can a man in Toronto craving South Indian food ask for?"}
{"text":"I've definitely experienced better.  The layout of the restaurant is very weird. It is a giant hall in a basement with very little décor. It definitely does not invite you to sit and savor a meal. Plus, there is a giant partition in the middle as if something is hidden behind.  We ordered the idly and the rava dosa. The sambhar was okay at best. It lacked spice and tanginess. The rava dosa felt like it had been made from old batter.   Finally, a south indian restaurant that charges a dollar each for extra sambhar and chutney. That is a cardinal sin in my opinion.   Never going here again."}
{"text":"This is my new favourite place to go.  Triple 5 star for customer service. Every time I go the servers give me a small free sample of something! Then I order it.   The food is very reasonable. You get a lot, and it's Delish!    Everything on the menu is vegetarian, and most of the menu options can be vegan or dairy free.   Must try the spiced coconut sweetened Cream of wheat dessert."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in Toronto, great price & great service come on the weekends for the veg seekh kabab!!"}
{"text":"It's a good place to get cheap and delicious food.   It was also stop number 2 in the UYE Little India crawl and a good place to try a dosa for the first time. The food is all vegetarian and you have a good choice of fillings for your dosas. I ordered the masala dosa, which had a potato filling with masala spices.   But if a dosa doesn't fancy your palate, there are curries, and even some dishes that infuse Cantonese dishes. I even had a bite of Idli Manchurian that Cecily Z ordered and it was good.   I can see this place being very busy during the dinner hour. But for a Saturday afternoon, it was filled with solo eaters, small families and an eager group of hungry Yelpers."}
{"text":"The onion masala dosa and the accompanying sauces are quite delicious here. The restaurant is very casual and the dining area resembles a cafeteria. There's lots of chatter so if you're looking for something tame and quiet this wouldn't be the place to go. There's also a mini daycare center of some sort next to the entrance.  I don't have kids but I imagine it's there because it's useful to some people."}
{"text":"If you like South Indian food, this is the place to go! Everything is vegetarian with the majority of the items vegan. Their old menus weren't that clear but judging from other people's pics online, their new menu has vegan items clearly marked.  We've been quite a number of times and tried:  - samosas - appetizer combo - masala dosa - mysore masala dosa - szechaun dosa - spring dosa - paper dosa - vegetable uthappam - onion uthappam - South Indian thali (vegan version) - aloo paratha - bhel chaat - panipoori chaat - sev poori chaat - idli chaat - idli manchurian - chana masala - kadai bhindi  Whew.   Everything has been delicious but uthappams apparently aren't really my thing though they are great here for people that like them. My favourites are the masala and szechaun dosas, the thali (which usually includes chana masala) and the chaats. The fusion idli manchurian was pretty good too.  Staff have always been friendly and service really quick. Have only eaten in but may try delivery soon.  Note: This restaurant is lower than street level so a small flight of stairs and not accessible, but handrails at stairs so suitable for people who can manage stairs with rails."}
{"text":"Totally solid.   A legitimate experience.  Sure, the food is great and the service is friendly.  But it's the location that's the best.   There's no place that I've been that is able to capture India as well as this non-descript spot on Gerrard.   Even down to how they call a room full of elementary-school aesthetic a 'palace'.  So many Dosas.   Try them all.  You can't go wrong.  Inexpensive.  Fresh.  Authentic.  Head bobble.  In my experience, this is consistently the best single restaurant on this street."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto, and far and away my favourite kid-friendly restaurant.  The food is wonderfully flavourful. The staff is very friendly and always smile at our toddler playing with other children around the restaurant. They've set up a small play area with toys that is much appreciated too.  I especially recommend the masala dosa. My wife recommends the Chana masala. My toddler recommends the mango lasi in a non spill able takeout container. Relative to other Indian restaurants, we always feel very healthy and lively after finishing a big meal here.  I couldn't recommend more!"}
{"text":"Very simple & yummy thali  Loved the rasam and dal. Ambience was good Chai had strong elaichi flavor so if anyone likes the flavor :)"}
{"text":"Do not order meals here. Rice was not cooked thru. Rasam was too spicy - dessert was loaded with sugar - Overall it felt like they cab ride to eat Indian food in Canada was wasted - they claim heir dosa is their speciality/ need to try that next time to validate their claim to fame !! My first experience here was bad."}
{"text":"On the advice of the waiter, I ordered a spring dosa. It was light, crispy and full of fresh, firm vegetables. The dal was as delicious and complex as a Bordeaux wine.   I'm a little concerned about the cleanliness, but the food was so delicious, the service was so gracious, I know I'm going back."}
{"text":"Was excited to order from this restaurant through Ubereats. I put several instructions on what I wanted extra with my meal, which I was willing to pay for and upon calling them directly to confirm , the person told me he couldn't do anything about that since I didn't pay for it.   I told him there was no option on the menu they setup for me to choose to pay extra and he pretty much cut the conversation short and said if his manager allowed it, I would see it in the order! What kind of garbage is this?! How does one talk like that to his customer?!  Joke is that all of this happened over a few bucks!  Guess this is the first & last time I'll order from these guys!"}
{"text":"Always reliable, excellent Dosa. Always.  Both the regular and special semolina dosa are great,  tea is nice,  lassi is thick and portions are large and definitely expand in your stomach on the way home. Try an interesting fusion szechuan kofta - interesting and tasty. The dosa really are the best,  everything else is good. Yes it's like a cafeteria, but the price is very fair and so truly tasty.  We visit several times a year and are never disappointed."}
{"text":"Spicy vegetarian food at cheap prices -- quite wonderful! Decor is akin to an abandoned skating rink, but we would happily eat here again."}
{"text":"I had been scouring the city for awesome South Indian food that would remind me of my trip to India. This place fits the bill and then some. The atmosphere is not great (probably not for a date) but I come here every trip to Toronto."}
{"text":"not good....only serve coconut chutney and tiny tiny sambar with a dosa...if there's not tomato chutney it's just not worth it for me"}
{"text":"Clean tasting and fresh vegetarian offerings.  Their talis are really good and Spouse and I have demolished more than just a few dosas in our time.  The rassam broth is by far the best I have tasted in Toronto.  I love, love, love the crispness of the dosas and for a fried item, it isn't swimming in oil.  The staff there are very polite and when you arrive, you are entering a welcoming environment.  This is a good alternative in Little India if you are seeking good quality, South Indian vegetarian food."}
{"text":"the first thing that struck me about udupi palace was the décor. it reminds me of a cafeteria? it wouldn't be a place i'd just like to hang out in.   the food, however, is fresh and yummy. i've been about three times and the quality is consistent. the place is usually packed, or at least crowded, which is comforting to me.  the servers are helpful if you're a dosa virgin, which i was on my first visit."}
{"text":"Don't like the place much. Experienced much better Dosa joints in Toronto. Find the food a little bland. Atmosphere is not great, and isn't the neatest place in little India.  Conclusion: Below average.."}
{"text":"If there is ever an Indian vegetarian food heaven, I think it's here.    Our party of 7 dine at Udupi last night and we all thoroughly enjoyed every dish we had.  We started with the Sev puri which I call it \"a party in your mouth\" because of all the unique different flavours and textures that just explodes in your mouth.  We did family style in which we shared a variety of dishes but my favourite is the vegetarian curry recommended by one of our server.  I also really liked the masala dolsa. Perfect combination of crunchy crepe with tasty potato inside.   The chilli paneer was super spicy for me so eat at your own risk.    Service was quick and efficient. Our total bill was $127 with taxes and gratuity and we were all stuffed."}
{"text":"We came to Udupi Palace for a ladies' brunch and I couldn't be more impressed.  I love Indian food in all its forms but I realized that I had never tried a dosa before.  This was also a good opportunity for me to be schooled by my friend in the differences of North and South Indian food.  We were seated right away and I noticed that the decor was very minimal.  It reminded me a lot of the langar hall in a gurdwara at a Sikh temple I visited last year which could only mean comfort and good food to come.  We started our meal with the sev poori chaat ($4.95) and steaming hot mugs of chai ($2.45).  I would have been happy to eat just chaat as my meal.  Each bite was crispy, salty, sweet and savoury all at once.  Next, an appetizer order of the chilli paneer ($5.25).  It was okay, albeit on the small side.  And then the mains - I ordered the Udupi Special ($9.95) which came with my choice of dosa and some extra sides (sambar, vada and idli).  I chose the Onion Masala Dosa.  We also ordered the Paneer Masala Dosa ($8.55), Vegetable Uthapam ($6.65) and the Rava Masala Dosa ($8.55).  Once the food arrived, it was a non-stop feeding frenzy as we sampled each dish.  I was not disappointed with anything and couldn't stop scooping the coconut chutney directly into my mouth.  Portion sizes were pretty huge and we left completely stuffed and happy.  Service was efficient and adequate, even as the busy room filled with hungry diners.  Udupi Palace is heaven for vegetarians and I also recommend it as a change of pace for carnivores and butter chicken/tandoori chicken lovers.  Very thankful to find this place and will return with friends who live in the East end."}
{"text":"First of many visits, for sure!  I saw an ad on Facebook through the Toronto Vegetarian Association advertising the 11.99 Thali all-you-can-eat, and decided this would be a great test of the menu.  We're not heavy meateaterss, and I prefer veggie so I was really excited to try it.  Wow, this was fantastic!  First, the staff are all a bunch of sweeties.  Like most good indian places, the decor does not reflect the quality of the food, and that's okay with me. =)  I am there for the food!  We got a big thali plate with a huge pile of rice, a papadum and naan, some soup and raita.  Then, the servers came around with containers with 4 bowls on each, 8 dishes total, which we got to pick and choose from and add on our plates.  Today we got a creamy white pumpkin dish that was so tasty; 2 kinds of dal, french beans, the Best Casaba Curry Ever (it was nice and sticky and spicy and I could eat a gallon of it), with some desserty potatoes and tea and  a couple other dishes that I can't remember at the moment.  We were so impressed by the variety of textures, and the fact that each dish had a very separate flavour - some places only know one or two base sauces so you end up with six dishes that all taste like aloo gobi.  Nothing against aloo gobi but guys.  Anyway, we ate our first round and got a ittle extra goop and finished that up, got a little more tea and some fantastic kulfi - no skimping on safron or raisins or nuts in this.  We were all totally impresed with this, and all three wet home so full.  $50 for 3 people with dessert and tea, And we are still full three hours later.  We'll be back to test out the dosas next time.  Thanks guys, you were great!"}
{"text":"Udupi Palace is, frankly, just ok. It pales in comparison to other South Indian restaurants in other cities - like Tiffin Wallah or Saravana Bhavan in NYC both of which produce equally affordable and far tastier food.  As for Udupi, the idli tasted, at least to me, slightly stale.  The vada was better, and the uttapam was a disaster - soggy and tasteless.  Of course people trek to Gerard Street for the king of all foods, the dosa, and even that seemed just fine.  Of course it's always exciting to have a local South Indian joint, but this one simply isn't all that exceptional."}
{"text":"Good option for Indian vegetarian south Indian food.  Ambience is not great, but clean and decent."}
{"text":"Good Indian food. Liked their concept of pizza dosa for kids. Channa battoora was outstanding! Special mention: Staffs were very courteous. Loved the ambience and music that they played.  Con: rest room was not up to the par!"}
{"text":"Poor decor and food selection. Ingredient variety reminded me of times of war. We were 3 people and here are the sum of ingredients in our dishes: gluten, rice, potatoes, peas, onion and cottage chees. I am not kidding. Stay away"}
{"text":"Food arrived very late.  Average food. Dosa was like a hand kerchief. Quantity was not adequate for the price.  Avoid thali meals for dinner as its not fresh. Average.  I wouldn't go out of the way to eat in this place."}
{"text":"Strolled in here and had to try their dosa! You know it's a bit more authentic when it's busy with South Asian customers. They had a diversity of customers overall.   I went for the Spring Dosa also the featured picture in their dosa menu section. The stuffing includes spiced vegetables (cabbage, carrots, tomatoes) and potato. It was light and refreshing and I love the curry-like sauces that you can dip it in to pack the flavour.   My friend ordered poori bhaji which also looks pretty impressive. She also liked her meal.  Even though they only serve vegetarian, I wish they carried more ingredient options in their dosas. It seems like the primary ingredient is centered around the potato, I mean I love potato but more veggie variety would be nice."}
{"text":"Best vegetarian in the city. Try the idli Manchurian. Also the Bhel Chaat. Staff are kind and helpful and often generous with free little treats while I'm waiting for a pickup order. Really glad to have been introduced to this restaurant. It is now a favourite for sure"}
{"text":"Food is okay okay, service was fine given the fact that it was Tuesday early evening and there were no customers when we walked in ( accommodating sure, but we had to go get extra napkins, straws, etc on our own couple of times).  Taking about food, taste is alright ( nothing special). There are other much much better tasting dosa places I have been to and rather continue going there."}
{"text":"I came to Udupi Palace, which serves vegetarian Indian cuisine with a very cafeteria-style atmosphere, as part of my seasonal Leslieville trip (having said that, Gerrard St. E. and Coxwell ain't exactly Leslieville, but I digress...)  I tried the samosa chaat.  I may know very little about Indian cuisine in general, but I know that I like my samosa flavourful, crispy, and piping hot.  While Udupi Palace's samosa chaat was certainly imbued with interesting spices, I found the samosa to be somewhat soggy, and the temperature ran the gamut from being decently hot to lukewarm to just cold, which I don't really enjoy in my Indian food.  In fact, I think I might actually prefer Amaya Express's vegetable samosa plate (with chana masala) to this...  I think next time if I'm in Little India, I'll try more Indian places before coming back to Udupi Palace.  (By the way, if there's a place that does great vegetable samosa with chana masala in Toronto, please feel free to let me know... I'm always open to suggestions!)"}
{"text":"Nothing Udupi or any distant relation to South Indian food. Not even indian food. Though it was busy which is surprising. Don't waste time, it's not worth even review. We had a thali and even Sambhar was not good. Rasam was little ok and for that posting this review. Seems Toronto does not have many South Indian food choices."}
{"text":"We have been going to this place for over a decade. The quality of the food and service level have remained good through out. The owner, Percy, is on site most days which explains the personalized service."}
