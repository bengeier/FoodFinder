{"text":"Okay, this is my last update of this restaurant.  As it turns out, they are pretty consistantly great!  The staff is super friendly, and the food is fresh and good.  I had one experience where the fish was a little less than fresh, but the rest of the times it's been fantastic."}
{"text":"The sushi here is ok...definitely not the best.We ordered a bento box and beef teriyaki. It came very quickly. We had no complain about the place until half way we were eating the server came and handed us the bill!?!?!Well, how do you know we were done eating!!! What if we were hungry and wanted to order more??? There were only 4 ppl in the resto so it's not like we were done eating and chatting...still eating!! DEFINITELY not going back there again!"}
{"text":"Love the sushi. Owner made sushi on his boat for my party. It was excellent. The staff and owner always made our special order. Food is great
My only wish is that the washrooms were cleaner."}
{"text":"This is a great little place, with high quality food and service. Especially good for the price. The soups in particular are fresh and flavorful.

It used to be our go-to place for Sushi in the area, but now there are a lot more choices.

I still recommend this location if you don't mind waiting when busy and can get a parking spot which can be hard at prime time."}
