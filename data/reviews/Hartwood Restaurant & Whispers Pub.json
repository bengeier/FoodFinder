{"text":"Great, unique atmosphere in the front room with all the books. Everyone was happy with their food. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. The service was a bit slow towards the end of the meal, but we were in no hurry and I think it added to the experience in a positive way."}
{"text":"Food was really good.  On the night I went  there was live music.  Very nice."}
{"text":"After seeing this reviewed in so many other places I am surprised that it hasn't been written up on yelp yet.  After reading so many of those great reviews I am thoroughly disappointed in the food and service that my family and I received at the Hartwood Restaurant. We ate lunch on a Saturday afternoon in October. The place was not that busy and we were promptly seated. I don't know if it was because of all the dust in the air and on the bookshelves around us but my husband immediately began having an allergic reaction to something. After a few minutes the worst of it subsided but his eyes remained quite red and watery for the remainder of the meal.  We all ordered our meals and drinks at the same time. I ordered a Pepsi and as soon as I took a drink had to spit it out. The syrup in the machine must have been low and it tasted like bland carbonated water. I asked the waitress to get me a new one and she looked at me like I was crazy but went and got one anyways. She must have got it from the same machine though and the second one was just as bad. Figuring that since a decent glass of Pepsi was too much to ask I wasn't expecting much from the meal.  I ordered an Angus Cheeseburger and fries. My husband ordered the Beer Battered Fish Sandwich and Chips. My burger was so greasy I couldn't stomach eating more than a few bites and my fries were both burnt and cold. My husband said he would trade me so he gave me his fish and it was flavorless and also too greasy to eat.  Since I don't live in the area The Hartwood Restaurant is not someplace I will be frequenting and if I visit the area again it is definitely not on my short list of places to eat. Pittsburgh has so many other fine dining restaurants I am sure there are much better places out there."}
{"text":"Love the Hartwood.  Such a charming restaurant with great atmosphere.  For nice weather dining you should try the patio."}
{"text":"I was looking for a pretty intimate spot to take a date, and this absolutely fit the ticket. Since the place got a new wine list it's definitely gotten a lot better. I definitely recommend it.  When I visited I had the \"Maui in the Burgh\" dish which was a filet with crab meat in a bernaise sauce. I ordered it medium rare and it was perfectly done. The dish is definitely something I would get again. The service was timely and very accomodating. The bartender was also very helpful with suggesting a wine to go with it.  Like I said I would absolutely recommend it to anyone, especially to a guy looking to take a lady out for a nice evening."}
{"text":"My first evening having dinner at Hartwood Restaurant I fell in love. The cozy atmosphere and refined cuisine offer a relaxed dining experience with a depth of flavor. I've returned twice since then and will be back soon."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this place, so take my comments as they are intended;  as a suggestion about how to improve.  I've been going there since it was just the bookstore/cafe and have seen it grow.  It's a lovely facility.  My complaints revolve around service;  it is always too slow.  Between the time I'm seated and the time a server shows up is always too long.  Ditto getting food to the table.  I appreciate the quality of the food, but it still needs to get there quicker.  I realize this is in the heart of \"ladies who lunch\" territory, and perhaps they love to languish and dish while waiting for their meal -- but I don't.  I'll also mention that today, while my chix sandwich was good, the Brussel sprouts showed up almost cold.  I didn't bother complaining, as it would have disrupted my meal, but there is simply no excuse for that.  And, as I think overs may have noted, the lack of service seems to exist whether the place is swamped or (like today) almost empty."}
{"text":"It was recomended by my brother who lives in Pitt so when we came to visit we went in for dinner    Started at the bar for a drink where I got a Gin and Tonic (it was a solid drink). Wife ordered diet coke but was dissapointed to find out they serve \"Pepsi\" but she got over it.    When we sat down the service was great and they suggested some things that we might like from the menu.   Food came pretty quick and my entree was outstanding. My 9 year old loved \"her \"cheeseburger\" and actually ate a full dinner for a change while my wife actually gave a compliment to the chef (she never does that).  The best part of the night came at the end when this guy showed up with the Stanley Cup (not sure who he was, looked like a front office guy). That's right, Lord Stanley himself showed up at the restaraunt.  If the Pittsburgh Penguins go there  Im all in!  Incredible night with outstanding food, a must for locals and visitors!!'"}
{"text":"Having driven by this place numerous times on the way to Hartwood Acres, my boyfriend and I decided on a special holiday dinner here. After requesting more intimate seating while placing a reservation via phone, they seated us at a beautiful, cozy table-for-2 on a 2nd-floor balcony.  We were stunned! The entire meal was finished in a half-hour, as the Caesar salad, Hartwood Burger, Butternut Squash Ravioli, Pecan Ball, and Mulled Wines were all devoured. Major applause for the staff and our waitress for preparing food that quickly and walking up and down the stairs to provide for us. Cannot wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Very enjoyable place to dine with family and/or friends.  Whispers Pub is a regular stop with friends.  Outdoor seating is great.  Ask for Juan Carlos - he's a top notch waiter.  A hidden treasure north of Pittsburgh !"}
{"text":"Hartwood is an amazing quaint little place with excellent food and the most lovely service. The manager John and his staff are super friendly and helpful. They helped me organize a small event wonderfully well, allowed me a private room for it and did not charge me anything more than the cost of the food ordered! The irish soda bread here is excellent, and so is most of the food on the menu. The cocktails are amazing too.  All in all an absolutely delightful experience."}
{"text":"We just happened to drive by the Hartwood Restaurant around dinner. The parking lot was packed but we found the last spot and went inside.  To our surprise there was no wait and we were seated in Whispers Bar.  We had great service, fantastic food and this has become an instant favorite of ours.    The food is chef-prepared and there will likely be many menu items that grab your attention.  There are interesting salads, sandwiches, and dinner entrees to choose.   Great food. Attentive service. Reasonable prices. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My husband and I have recently moved to the area and we came across The Whispers Pub after a hike with our dog.  And have returned a few times since.    They have a wonderful outside seating area where you may bring your well behaved dog with you.  She sat by our feet whilst we enjoyed sitting by the huge outside log fire.  They even  brought our dog some water.    We are working our way through the menu. Each meal we've had so far has been delicious.  The service has been just right.  The perfect balance of amount of \"attentiveness and engagement\" and \"allow you to enjoy your meal while just peacefully hanging out\".  We shall be back regularly."}
{"text":"I had the portobello grilled wrap which had so much flavor.  My husband had the pear and goat cheese salad which was a nice size.  Then my daughter is trying to eat paleo and they were so accommodating.  Most places wouldn't do that.  We will be back and bring others."}
{"text":"My mom hosted my baby shower at Hartwood and I cannot speak more highly on its behalf. The manager was more than accommodating, the servers attentive, the atmosphere cozy and intimate, and the food delicious!  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone planning an event!"}
{"text":"Update:  I've gone twice since my original review.  Both times we were terribly disappointed and have decided to explore other local places to eat.  I would suggest people steer clear of this place.  Terrible, slow service and the tofu is horrible (added to salad).  The kid's grilled cheese was hard/tough and not melty.  How do you mess up a grilled cheese?  The BLT wrap (special) was not too bad.  We didn't receive silverware until almost 8 minutes after our food was placed on the table.  They didn't bring the fruit cup out prior to our meal like  we had asked (for our toddler) -- she was STARVING and a total crab-ass, but they just didn't do it."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic restaurant. The food was delicious , prices very reasonable. The decor is spectacular. My wife and I loved it and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints! The food selections awesome and prepared to perfection! Very cozy with very nice atmosphere, food and people!"}
{"text":"My family brought me here for my birthday.  The service and hospitality were top notch and the atmosphere is that of a warm, welcoming restaurant and pub in Ireland.  The food - OH THE FOOD!! 5 of us ordered the peppered flat iron steak and it was the best I have ever had!  We all wanted to come back for another meal and I can't wait to have it again!!  My 89 year old aunt just loved her cottage pie and even the tofu dinner and hamburger meals were excellent.  And yes, the brie and grape quesidillas and calamari were delicious as well.  Thank you for a lovely birthday evening!! Can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"A UNIQUE EATERY THAT'S WORTH A VISIT BUT HAS ROOM TO GROW!  We went for my birthday on the recommendation of my mom who had recently hosted a luncheon there and loved it. I was pleasantly surprised to find a unique building with a very unique pacific rim type menu. Speaking for myself, I started with the Cesar salad which was tasty - dressing used Greek yogurt - it had a tangy depth of flavor rather than a typical oil-laden dressing. Others in the party had salads but agreed that one to many ingredients where added to the salad - like pecans, blue cheese AND grapefruit. Taking out one ingredient could let the other flavors shine. We also shared the fried green tomatoes which were tasty. The dinner menu had alot of interesting fish selections and we were happy to see what we ordered was fresh and plentiful. Everyone in the party ordered seafood and loved it. Dessert was also delightful - try the apricot cobbler! Overall, the impression that we got is that the chef is young or newer to cooking -they needed to focus in some of their menu ideas to  make them go from good to great.  It's a lovely place to go for a nice night if you're in that neck of the woods!"}
{"text":"Great spot for a nice dinner but still accommodating of our well-behaved young children."}
{"text":"Whispers (or Hartwood Cafe) is a true gem in an area that does not have much options. The uniquely cozy atmosphere makes dining an intimate experience. This is one of my favorite places to escape the winter cold. Although I love when the patio is open in warmer weather and seasonal berries are incorporated into the salad.  The menu is mostly traditional, but everything is done exceptionally well and with great integrity. I am always at a loss what to order. But I always start the panco-crusted goat cheese salad - which adds delicious creamy warmth to the fresh greens. The soups are also a highlight for me. My boyfriend is always a fan of the turkey devonshire.  If you have not been to Hartwood, I highly recommend it. It is a great experience from start to finish and you would be hard pressed to find something you do not want to order."}
{"text":"I would recommend getting the wigle whisky flat iron steak. It is delicious, well seasoned, and cooked a true medium. The service is usually very good here. I often see even the owner clearing places or bringing out food to customers. I like to sit outside in the summer but inside has a cozy feel that is nice too. I recommend giving this place a try for a nice dinner if you haven't already."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this place ever since Don Montgomery opened it. Several years ago a new owner bought in. Unfortunately this place now serves mediocre food. Average in every way. Pedestrian at best. I went there tonight. The disappointment tonight was the wine. They serve wine by the glass now that comes in 2 liter bottles not much better than jug wine that the state store sells for $15 and they charge $9 for a 6 ounce glass of crappy wine. The mark west Pinot noir was terrible and the Cabernet was just as bad. I am disappointed every time I go there. The place is beautiful ...too bad the food and beverage is so poor."}
{"text":"Just had my daughter's bridal shower at The Hartwood this Saturday. The venue was perfect, the staff was very accommodating, and John, the events coordinator made sure the pacing was smooth.  My guests thought the whole affair was very elegant"}
{"text":"Best seafood in Pittsburgh!  Halibut and scallops were to die for!  I love the atmosphere there too.  Good pours on the wine and big portions of food for the money.  I got a salad with fresh pears, goat cheese and it was enough to split it.  I think this is Pittsburgh's best kept secret.  The service was great even though it was packed for a Saturday night.  I highly recommend this restaurant for good, fresh seafood!"}
{"text":"Went there for my wife's 40th birthday, I had called a week before, set up her favorite bottle of wine, and a birthday cake, atmosphere was wonderful, food was great and  prices are reasonable, fried tofu actually had a crunch (very hard to accomplish).  Hot pretzels are always a favorite of ours. We have lived near the restaraunt for the past 10 years and a couple of years ago my wife and I decided to try it. Are only regret is that it took us 8 years to eat there."}
{"text":"I took the fam here for Mother's Day.  The food was above average but the line moved way too slow.  It was a combination of a poor layout and people staring at each food item before they selected something to eat.  The selection was great: French toast, bacon, sausage, potatoes, salmon, salad, fruit, etc.  The carvings and omelettes were top notch.  I would come here again."}
{"text":"We had the Cottage Pie and Lunch Quiche.  Both were scrumptious.  Service was friendly and attentive.  Cozy venue close to our home."}
{"text":"Stopped here on whim for lunch.  My husband and I enjoyed the Mushroom/asparagus risotto and the chicken sandwich.  Both were fantastic.  The chips were a little to salty for my taste but the risotto was absolutely wonderful.  can't wait to go go backhand try dinner or sit on the patio."}
{"text":"4 of us went on friday evening  may 1,,,,,,consensus was that it was overpriced average food...."}
{"text":"My favorite combo:  Beer and food.  So Beer dinners are my thing.  Hartwood restaurant and The Grist House put on a Fat Tuesday Beer dinner Last night.  I have never been to Hartwood Restaurant before but I was wowed with its atmosphere.  Floor to ceiling books, beautiful hardwood floors, burning fireplaces, and a tree (albeit faux) growing in the middle of the dining room.  Just this aspect alone was incredible.  Not to mention the food and the beer (I will also post this on Grist House, so don't judge :)    Our meal was specifically crafted toward the beers and the theme.  Oysters, Gumbo and King cake with a baby (and if you won, Hartwood gave you a free ticket to your beer/wine dinner of choice, unfortunately I left baby-less, but I did leave with some beads and a cool feather mask).  The owner of the restaurant gave a brief history lesson of Mardi Gras while the Grist House owners described their great product and stopped at each table.   Lastly, the chef came in and talked to the group and also stopped at each table.    The experience was great. You can tell that this isn't anyone's first rodeo.  Super professional, engaging, and educational and in a super cool venue.  Perfection.."}
{"text":"We stopped by for a casual business lunch and discovered Great food and relaxing outdoor patio atmosphere."}
{"text":"I had my daughter's bridal shower there a few weeks ago and it was lovely.  I received many compliments on both the food and the service.  The room the shower was held in was spectacular.  The manager John was fabulous to work with and made the day wonderful, and a very special time for the bride.  Thank you John and to your staff for an amazing day!! Cathy Lombardi"}
{"text":"I went here with my husband little sister and my 1year old son. Food is always delicious soda bread awesome. I was not impressed with our server Victoria she did not tell us specials we had to keep waiting for her to come by our sprites tasted like syrup ( this was not her fault) she did not seem at tentative to us at all and I watched her with other tables she treated them differently. We come here often this is the only time I have not liked the service the food and restaurant it's self made the 4 stars. The hosted is very nice also very helpful. We will be back just not with Victoria as our server"}
{"text":"Very good food at a reasonable price; had the duck-very well prepared and the filet was a very nice dish.  My only request for improvement would be some better wines by the glass.  Had the pecan ball for desert very good! Worth the drive from Moon, PA"}
{"text":"Here's where five hungry females descended upon after hiking five and a half miles at nearby Hartwood Acres.  I don't care which gender you are--when you've been hiking on a winter's morn, you'll chow down afterwards!  I think we all started with the soup and we spilt an appetizer of the fruit and cheese plate.  Nothing warms you up like a good cup of hearty soup!    Feeling a bit adventurous, I tried the grilled chicken sandwich with szechuan barbeque and sweet potatoes.  That got my tastebuds warmed up and my innards warmed too!   Mmmm, metabolized so quickly!  My girlfriends tried the sun dried tomato wraps and I believe a couple of 'em went for the fish hoagies.    Hartwood Restaurant is the closest sit-down restaurant to Hartwood Acres.  It's worth a stop if you're going to a summer concert or to the Festival of Lights."}
{"text":"Convenient and a very nice atmosphere, but service is average and food just ok. Location drives the popularity of this place"}
{"text":"I've been here twice. The first time my experience was great and the food was delicious. The second time...not so much. I think it was more the fault of what I ordered than anything else as everyone else at my table seemed to enjoy their meal.  I got the fish sandwich laced with crab meat and topped with homemade tartar sauce. I thought it was pretty bland tasting and I had to douse it with some ketchup to get some added flavor from it. I also ordered a side of the clam chowder which performed a lot better than the sandwich. It was a satisfactory cup of soup and hit the spot.  While waiting for your food, they serve you a basket of bread and butter to tie you over until your meal is served. I don't know if they serve it year round, but on this day they were serving a delicious sweet cranberry bread that my family gobbled up and even asked for seconds.  The outdoor seating here is really great and they even had infrared heaters to keep us warm since it was a little bit of a chilly fall evening. The indoor seating is equally good and is like sitting in a library or mom and pop book store with all of the wall shelving and books everywhere. Guests are even welcome to pick up a book from the shelves and read if they'd like.  A great environment and decent food. It's a place I enjoyed enough to come back and try again."}
{"text":"We celebrated my grandfather's 90th birthday here last night and it was a huge success.  We planned the event with lots of support from their GM, John, who was fantastic.  We were lucky enough to use the Red Room for our party which made it such an intimate and cozy night for our group.  The food was delicious, our server was great, we were well looked after and had our every need taken care of.  Many thanks for helping make my grandfather's celebration such a special evening for everyone!"}
{"text":"Being in the neighborhood, we stopped for an early dinner at The Hartwood, which is too far from home to visit regularly. It was a very good choice. The weather was perfect for dining outside. We got a table on the patio, which is shaded and located behind the restaurant, protected from the road noise. The menu is simple and hard to categorize as to cuisine or theme. I guess you have to call it American. There are appetizers, soups and salads, sandwiches, fish, meat, and pasta entres, and a couple of specials. We chose the fish specials, red snapper and halibut, both of which were excellent. We selected a California Chardonnay from the limited but well-constructed wine list. The wine prices are lower than I would expect for a restaurant of this quality. Other positives worth mentioning were the service (professional and properly paced) and the excellent free bread (Irish soda and baguette). We will definitely stop in when we are in the area and may even make the trek just to have dinner at The Hartwood."}
{"text":"A hidden gem near Hartwood! Heather is the best"}
{"text":"Always impressed. I've never ordered anything here I didn't like, in the restaurant or the pub. Service and atmosphere are good. Great for a family or romantic dinner."}
{"text":"I've lived in the Hampton area for over 5 years and had never been here until a coworker recommended.   Driving past it regularly, I just assumed it was a pub/grille serving bar food but I was wrong.  It's a great restaurant with really good food.  I've been here twice and we've loved all our meals.     Most recently we started with an artisanal cheese plate (they kindly left off the meat for us and gave us extra cheese), a house salad, vegetarian ravioli and a burger.   The sweet ravioli was in a brown butter sauce with carrots and pumpkin seeds.  Loved it.  They do change up the menu to be seasonal.  This past fall I had butternut squash ravioli that was equally good.  The house salad is a little on the small side.  They also have a nice selection of wine and beer.    I recommend a reservation as it does get crowded.  It's a relatively large place and there a several different rooms.  There is a library type area with a fireplace and the walls are lined with filled bookshelves.  I've also been wanting to try out the patio as it looks fun and relaxing.  Service can be a little slow but overall, great experience."}
{"text":"John, the manager, and his staff at Hartwood Restaurant made the entire planning process and execution of my sister's bridal shower a success!  From the first correspondence with John via e-mail, to meeting his welcoming personality on our tour, to his professionalism and willingness to accommodate all of our needs the day of the shower--was nothing short of amazing!  The atmosphere and quality of food at Hartwood is truly something special and unique.  We look forward to being lifelong patrons of the restaurant in the future. I would HIGHLY recommend Hartwood as your next dining location or event venue!"}

{"text":"This restaurant is tucked away in the woods just off the serene, meandering Harts Run Rd. Intimate and authentic old-world elegance for my Son's HS Graduation Dinner Celebration with Family.  John Muth, General Manager of the Hartwood Restaurant & Whispers Pub kindly & expertly guided our function selections, private \"red\" room & offered appetizers on the patio, and we made a Personalized Celebration Menu. The Pub and moonlit outdoor patio was tempting, we will be back!  Excellent Food & Service (our Server Lisa was outstanding!).  The menu is awesome, Irish soda bread (yum!), Wigle Whiskey Flat Iron Steak, Salmon Tejano, EVERYONE loved the Sesame Ginger Cauliflower, several delicious vegetarian & vegan selections too.    The environment is welcoming, an embracing ambiance decorated with wood, stained glass, warm colors and tall book shelves reminiscent of the coffeehouse & bookstore it once was...I remembered my Son (the graduate) when he was a little boy sitting on the floor and reading all the books he could reach! Hartwood is a haven in the woods to fill your stomach and your soul. If a restaurant could be loving & healing, this one is.  Thank you John Muth, Mgr and Lisa for helping to enrich our family's Celebration & Dining experience!   ."}
{"text":"First time at Hartwood Restaurant and everyone in our dinner party (6 in all) were impressed not only with the quality of the food, but also the unique ambiance of the restaurant and it's attentive and knowledgeable wait staff."}
{"text":"Always a great place to go excellent wait staff great food and fabulous ambiance why wait 2 hours for a burger at Burgatory when you can have 10 x as many dinner choices and better date!!"}
{"text":"Well....awesome atmosphere, great cocktails, beautiful outdoor patio ....but,  was a little disappointed in the portion sizes-   A $15 Salad should really have more than 4 pieces of lettuce.  A $4 'upcharge' for asparagus?  And ...a 'charge' to split a wedge salad?   ...a little disappointing....sorry to say, but will think twice about picking this one again in the near future"}
{"text":"A regular stop for us. Food quality excellent. We are regular customers who enjoy good food and generally top notch service. But tonight service was quite disappointing. Waitress was either too busy or not interested in providing us reasonable attention. When the customer has to chase down another waitress to request that the water be refilled, a cause for a disappointing experience. As regular customers, while unsatisfied this evening, we will go back expecting a return to quality service and attention. Failing that we will take our business elsewhere."}
{"text":"The food is excellent but It has an authentic, real pub vibe not easily found in the North Hills.  They are there but you have to know where to look, this is one of those places.  Make sure you check out the stunning stained glass painting from (I'm told by the friendly bartender) back to the 1820s.  It depicts a \"whispering woman\" in a whats look like a bridal party pre-wedding scene.    I Get the sense it's a warning of the venomous power of dropping rumors in the matters of love or politics.  But who is the warning intended for ?  The fate of the targeted or the soul and karma of the rumor dropper?"}
{"text":"We went here for our five-year anniversary, and it was great. Loved my food, a unique Cajun-style fettuccine with creole veggies and a bbq butter sauce. I'd like to go back and sit on the outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Update on our 4 star review from months back: Again, we reserved our favorite small private table on the balcony for my wife's birthday. The staff is always polite and efficient including our server for this evening. My issue with downgrading the restaurant is with the meals. Although very tasty, the management or chefs seem to be severely cutting the amount of food served. I have had the Mahi mahi & crab dish several times and have had no complaints. However, last night the the amount of fish was about half of what I have been served several times before, from about 4oz to about 2. And the amount of crab on top was a pitiful tablespoon at best, compared to at least 2-3 tblspns in the past, and all on a few tablespoons of rice pilaf which was also about half the amount I have experienced previously. I was still hungry when we left and I am not a big eater. Previously with these exact dishes I was always satisfied but not 'stuffed'. My wife's scallop dish also seemed paltry compared to previous experiences with this dish. It is apparent to me that they are drastically cutting back on the ingredients in meals and for $24 for the mahi dish and 28 for the scallop dish, I believe that the price does not justify the meal, regardless of taste. I chose not to call the manager, Jon, to discuss this as I didn't want to ruffle my wife's birthday dinner. I am also choosing not to contact Jon or the restaurant about this. I don't want a free meal or coupons or even an explanation. Maybe it's the chef's prerogative to skimp on the plates but I can no longer justify the prices for the paltry amount of food on the plate. We won't be returning. We don't go out to a restaurant like this but on special occasions and to spend nearly 100 bucks and to not be satisfied leaves my stomach feeling empty and a bad taste in my mouth. What was once our favorite place to dine on special occasions has been stricken from our list."}
{"text":"I attended a bridal shower here last weekend and had a fabulous time! The room we were in was a perfect setting for a classy shower. It was beautifully decorated and very spacious. For lunch I had the mac and cheese with smoked chicken and bacon; it was wonderful!! The portion was just the right size and I was able to finish my lunch without feeling overly stuffed. For dessert, they had two different types of cupcakes, yellow cake or red velvet. I love all things red velvet and am very picky, and this cupcake certainly lived up to my expectations! The cupcake itself was moist and the icing was light and creamy without being over sweet. I would love to go back here to eat lunch and check out the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"We were lucky enough to have our wedding rehearsal at Hardwood Restaurant and Whispering Pub. The manager John was extremely helpful and he made sure our event went smoothly and exactly what we wanted. Awesome place for any event and their event pricing for lunches cant be beat.  The whole restaurant used to be an old book store, so there are many romantic nooks for a private dinner. The atmosphere is all about elegance; centering around books, wood, antiques and beautiful decor.   Their food is always fresh, playing off of natural fusion between ingredients and always incredibly taste.  The taste and look on each dish (sandwich or entree) are creative and filling so come hungry. I have had a number of dishes here and have never been disappointed...so I recommend anything they have on the menu.   Fyi, the drink selection is impressive and the out door patio is my favorite place to chill in Gibsonia in the summer.  The over all appearance and service of this place is straight out of Marth Stewart's magazine and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Came here with my friend on a Saturday evening. We had the cheese platter appetizer- we were REALLY hungry! The cheeses were delicious blue, Brie, cheddar, and another that appeared to be mild semi soft. There were pickles, pickled veggies the most amazing grainy mustard I've ever tasted and blueberry balsamic jam. Served with flatbreads. Beyond yummy!! I had a cranberry mule which was served in its copper mug and delicious. I ordered the Hartwood burger which was a combination of chopped beefs with bacon cheddar sautéed mushrooms and onions. Out of this world!! Served on a brioche bun. Saved half for the next days dinner. My friend had the salmon pesto sandwich. Again, beyond tasty - and we weren't even hungry anymore. Prices were reasonable, service exemplary. Will be here again!!!"}
{"text":"I would give them a 4.5 if I could. We were planning dinner with friends and we were bouncing some ideas around. My bestie suggested Hartwood as none of us had ever been there. So, Hartwood it was. I made reservations for Saturday evening at 530. We got there and were seated promptly by a wonderful hostess. At first we thought, wow, didn't need reservations but the dining room filled very quickly and I would suggest reservations if you plan on going at 6 or later. We were seated in a wonderful, huge, warm, and inviting dining room surrounded by book shelves filled with books and next to a cozy fireplace (which was on and that made me happy). I have to add there is a bit of stained glass in the restaurant and it is magnificent!  Our waitress promptly came over and took drink orders. She provided us with impeccable service all evening refreshing our beverages and following up quickly with our drinks, food, desserts, and checks. We were provided with a beautiful bread basket which had a French baguette and Irish soda pop bread. I cannot say how the French baguette was but the soda pop bread was devine! It was warm, and salty, and sweet - yum! We all ordered apps. I chose a special, the salmon mousse drizzled with a vinagarette. I would describe it as a small salmon cake but my, oh my, they packed a punch with the flavor and the vinagarette was the perfect compliment. The hubbies ordered clam chowder which they liked a lot. My hubby noted it could have used a bit more clam. My Bestie ordered a salad and enjoyed it. For my entree I got the scallops anjou. The scallops were cooked perfectly, seared to perfection on a bed of butternut squash risotto. The risotto was also cooked and seasoned perfectly. I got the brussel sprouts as well and they were wonderful. Brussel sprouts can go wrong if not cooked well and they got it right! The hubby chose the duck and deferred to the chef on how it be cooked which was medium. The hubby enjoyed it tremendously. He noted that the crispy, salty skin with tender meat was paired perfectly with a fresh cherry compote, the perfect bite. The bestie got the wild mushroom and asparagus risotto which she loved noting it was perfectly seasoned and flavorful. The bestie's hubby got the cottage pie which he loved as well. The entrees are on the smaller side but that just means room for dessert! We all indulged. Me and my Bestie got the pecan ball. It is a big scoop of vanilla ice cream rolled in pecans and drizzled in caramel and hot fudge - how can you go wrong with that combination. It was so good! My hubby got the pecan pie which was terrific! He noted one bad thing about the pie, it wasn't a big enough piece! The bestie's hubby got the special: s'mores cup which he thought was okay. All in all this place is a gem and I can't understand why we haven't been there sooner but we will certainly go back! Great service, fantastic food, in a wonderfully warm dining room!"}
{"text":"Never ever have we been disappointed with a meal or service here. They have a wonderful staff and a cute little setting.  Love the new outdoor seating area. Their Pecan Balls are to die for!"}
{"text":"This is a such charming place to visit and eat! It's ambiance is unique and quaint. We recently had our rehearsal dinner hosted here. The manager, John, was a pleasure to work with and very flexible. We rented out a room in the back that also had a patio attached, which was perfect for the beautiful evening. He even had customized menus made for us! The food here is excellent. Everyone really enjoyed their food. From the steak to the scallops to the salads to the massive desserts, all taste buds were satisfied.  I'm not giving five stars because the waitress helping our party kept making comments that she was pretty much annoyed with our large party under her breath that we could clearly hear, it was odd. Everyone was minding their own business and not once did we complain. The service wait for the entrees was very long too. Another time visiting for a normal lunch meal, the service was questionable too, as our waitress first forgot to put our order in, then didn't even get mine right.  With that being said, the food and wait are worth it if you have some time! There may just be a few bad apples within their crew. I would completely recommend for a unique place for a great meal in this area. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Really good food. Interesting place to eat."}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant ever since Ed and Allison were there. I have tried it on separate occasions and have been disappointed . The service is great but the food is just average considering the prices are rather high compared to the food. There are to many other restaurants in the area that gives you better value."}
{"text":"Wonderful cafe and bar food. Great neighborhood restaurant with a pup feel. Try the spicy mac and cheese and sheppard's pie."}
{"text":"This is a good place to go for a slightly upscale meal. However, there is also a bar for a more casual dinner. The food is excellent and the restaurant has a cozy environment, as it is located inside of an old house (rumor is that there are ghosts here, too! But you'll have to figure that out yourselves.)."}
{"text":"A very nice, quaint and unique atmosphere, as this is a restaurant that used to be a bookstore.  Many options for private tables for a more intimate dinner. The food was good.  Gnocchi was fluffy and tasty, and was flavored with a little bit of bacon.  The fish sandwich, salmon, mahi with crab were all good.  All together, it was a very good time.  The only downsides were that the portions were a bit on the small side for the price, and service could have been a little bit better.  Our waitress was friendly and pleasant, but I didn't see her much during our meal.  I would definitely come back, though, as the overall experience was quite good."}
