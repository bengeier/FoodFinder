{"text":"I love pho and eat it often. For me personally, pho is all about the soup. I don't add anything into the soup, just straight up original flavour. The soup is very tasty, it has more spice than other pho places. Portion is on the small side. Will be back to try the duck leg pho.   Flavour 8/10 Portion 6/10 Cleanliness 7/10 Service 7/10 Repeat? Yes."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! Definitely the best Vietnamese I've had in the city so far. It's tucked into a tiny room a couple of blocks away from the rest of the East Chinatown restaurants. Quiet and unassuming, the service is fast and friendly, but just the right level of hands off for me.  If you're into duck, I highly recommend their Roasted Duck Egg Noodle Soup. A roasted duck leg comes in a rich meaty (ducky?) broth, with roasted carrot, fresh gai lan, and egg vermicelli for $7.95. A word of warning, the broth is heavy on the star anise, which might be too much for people who don't like licorice. Personally, I think it pairs perfectly with the duck. The green mango salad is also nice. Fresh, spicy, and citrusy."}
{"text":"Maybe it was a bad night. I've only been once. Lots of effort but service was slow and food was cold by the time we got it. Took 30 min to get the bill that finally came after 3rd request. Place is clean. Food is ok. Over this place is just ok ... Not sure that I can understand all the outstanding reviews"}
{"text":"I love the pho here!  My favourite is the spicy hue style beef soup with thick vermicelli, extra spicy.  Totally addictive."}
{"text":"Tasty and cheap.   I had the Bun with grilled chicken and veggie spring rolls. Everything was great.   Place is pretty basic but service is friendly and the food was good.   I'm giving this place a high rating because for the price and downtown location its a great deal."}
{"text":"Hands down best Pho in town! Love it every time"}
{"text":"Great food but not one of the cleanest places. Its an awesome family ran restaurant if you're not in a rush because there is a wait time. I got the banh xeo and it was wonderful. It was packed with ingredients and there were plenty of lettuce and veggies to go with it. One of the best restaurants in the neighbourhood. But the only down side is that there is only street parking and it may be hard to find during dinner times or when it's busy. Definitely a place I'll be going back to when I'm in the area and looking for some delicious Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"You know back in the late 90's I was roommates with an ex chef from Scaramouche and I would ride on his dining coat-tails.   It was through him I discovered Vietnamese food, in all it's glory.  The Golden Palace at College and Spadina, and the Golden Turtle a few years later were my favs.  Bach Yen is a terrific east side Vietnamese / Pho restaurant.  The food is prepared super fresh by a loving family.  I took mine to go which put the owner in hysterics because he was worried about the freshness and taste of the food - talk about caring!  I sampled a ton of different dishes - they were all really good.  Pho, various chicken dishes, a beef dish.  If you know the quality and were fans of the Palace and the Turtle and need a fix, this place will do just fine.  If you're a foodie driving around the city looking for the next thing, I don't think you need to come here.  It's just good, authentic, lovingly made Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Been a few times now. Can't beat it for the price. And the owner is super friendly."}
{"text":"I've only discovered this place 6 months ago and have been back several times.  Their Banh Xeo and satay beef noodles are my favourites.  Caution, the satay noodle dish is very spicy, even the mild version, so proceed with caution.  Their Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio is one of the better ones in Toronto.  I've eaten here with my family and we are always surprised how small the total bill is.  I fear they may not last if their prices are too low.  I rather pay a little more so there is somewhere I can go to get my Banh Xeo fix."}
{"text":"Please go here and eat the food.  They are lovely and I want to be able to eat good Pho when I come home to the \"east\" side at the end of the day.  A very satisfying bowl, good wraps, attentive service at a family establishment!  GO!"}
{"text":"Really delicious Vietnamese dishes! Friendly service, solid Pho and I really enjoy their attention to details. We were asked promptly if we would like the bean sprouts that come with Pho cooked or raw. Already a good sign that they take care little details like this because we do prefer the cooked bean sprouts. Another pleasant find is the tea they serve. It was nice and smooth and camomile was found in the teapot. No wonder it was so refreshing! Glad I gave this place a try!!"}
{"text":"This is the best pho place that I have ever been to in Toronto (out of at least 20). Just to make sure it was not by chance, I went there again and it was consistently good. The beef was tender and chewy, and bright red when I asked it be served on the side. I have been to many places where the beef looks aged and becomes super dry once cooked in the broth. Prices are the best I have seen in the city.  I will keep returning for Sunday brunch!"}
{"text":"Great place, owner is a nice friendly guy. You ought to try the Vietnamese omelette! Might be confusing at first about the way it's supposed to be eaten but I was told by the guy how you need to wrap it in the salad leaves. Definitely worth the try! Place is clean"}
{"text":"I tried this placed based on all the great reviews and was extremely disappointed.  The seafood soup was the previously frozen variety and consisted of - imitation crab, those sketchy fish balls, a few pieces of squid and maybe 4 small shrimp.  The spring rolls consisted of an unrecognizable meat substance (was it chicken? no, pork? who knows) and some shredded vegetable, again unrecognizable.  The broth was good, but for $13.50 I expected more.  And on the topic of price, I should have asked for a receipt, because they overcharged me by a few dollars, as it didn't add up to the prices on the menu.   The sign on the window says they accept Visa, but apparently they don't!    They seemed like nice people, but to scam me on prices for mostly imitation food, I learned my lesson and will not return."}
{"text":"It's good for the price you pay, we tried the Bun Bo Hue and Pho and Banh Xeo. The Bun Bo Hue was the best tasting of the meal, but the meal was overshadowed by browning herbs and veg.   It may have been a result of  the time of day I came (8pm).  I have been in search for a Banh Xeo as I had in Saigon and Hoi An and was disappointed when I tried it here after reading all of the reviews."}
{"text":"The pho here is pretty legit. Good flavour and decent sizing. We went for the 95, which is on the additional items menu and has a mixture of beef. Pricing is good compared to other places in Toronto and the owner is incredibly nice. The only minor downside is that the star anise was stronger than at other places; if you love star anise though, it's a positive!"}
{"text":"Fabulous food, excellent prices! Clean and airconditioned. The pho broth is the best I've tried along the Gerrard strip, and the Thai food is also amazing. I highly recommend #58, the fried fish with lime and ginger, with mango salad. I like that this place isn't cash only and I think service and food quality at EXTREMELY reasonable prices makes it a winner!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today after reading about this place on Yelp. It is a great place. I had the hot and sour soup (tom yum) and the rice dish that had grilled chicken, pork chop and shredded pork on it. My husband had the egg noodle soup with won ton and bbq pork in it, accompanied by spring rolls. They were all delicious.  And all this came to under $24 inc tax. The gentleman that runs the place is super nice and friendly. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Meh. I think the joys of a local business with an owner who appreciates the locals and regulars is dead. Having waited for multiple tables to be served that were seated after us to finally be provided menus, it was time for us to leave. Won't be back."}
{"text":"The Tom Yum soup was among the three best I've ever had. Ingredients for the rice paper rolls were excellent. The pho was perfection. This place would deserve five stars if it were four times the price. Service was efficient, welcoming and very pleasant. This place almost restored my faith in humanity. Bravo."}
{"text":"Fourth(?) time here. Ordered shrimp spring roll, pork spring roll and grilled pork.  I was disappointed by the spring roll. Sparse shrimps and pork, a lot of vermicelli. The sauce is a really good complement though. The shrimp is good too. It doesn't have that shrimp smell and it is kind of sweet. It is like the third time I ordered grilled stuff here, and it never disappointed me. Good balance of fat and lean meat. It was glittering but not greasy. Smell nice and taste nice. A little scorched is my favorite part. And yes, the sauce. Nice humble owner. Clean setting. This place remind me of those old Hong Kong movie( I know it is Vietnamese-_-#?: old slow Cantonese song, pink purple light coming from the neon lamp, the water sound in the aquarium. Sunday evening in summer, there was only me. I sit there and was lost looking at the sunset in old Chinatown. I will miss this place."}
{"text":"My favourite Vietnamese restaurant in all of Toronto. It's a family run business, the guy runs the place on his own with his wife, very authentic and I grew up in south east Asia. He cares for all his customers, and the pricing is so affordable. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Bach Yen.  Great service, fantastic food, free street parking after 6pm and all day Sunday.  Decor is standard for what I have become accustomed to from Vietnamese eateries, nothing over the top, but clean and welcoming.  Very affordable!  I look forward to returning and suggest you take a gander if you're in the area, or are mobile"}
{"text":"Wish I would've discovered this place sooner. I always drove by but never knew how amazing they were! Went in to order takeout and the owner was wonderful! He offered me tea while I waited, as soon as my order was ready he even ran past me to get the door! Really sweet gentleman! Food was awesome, I ordered a pho (rice noodle with soup), summer spring rolls, rice and an iced cappuccino. Everything was delectable and on point! The soup was clear too, unlike other places that are usually oily. This will be my go-to from now."}
{"text":"On Gerrard, I used to go to Double 8, then it closed down. Then I went to Peach Garden (which turned into Com Tam Pho 168). I thought both were the 'standard' for Pho and fresh rolls.  While on Yelp, by chance, I stumbled on this place and decided to give it a try since it had 4.5 stars after 34 reviews.  The bar has been raised.  The nicest guy in the world (the owner?) as well as a lady provided great service and conversation.  To the 34 people who reviewed this place before me, I LOVE YOU ALL for posting your reviews and leading my down the path to Pho-vana."}
{"text":"We had the rare beef and brisket phos here as well as the bun bo hue which is a spicy stew kind of pho. The waiter asked me how spicy I wanted it and I said that I loved spicy foods (which I do) and boy was it spicy (but good) ! The bun ho hue was really flavorful with a nice rich beef broth accented with lemongrass, chili and lime. If you do not loveeee spicy food, maybe get this in mild, but if you are a spicy food lover like myself, give it a try!  The rare beef and brisket pho was good, it had a nice flavorful broth and the noodles were not overcooked. The sizes are kind of small if you are a very hungry person. My husband and I had to get 2 rare beef and brisket phos and a bun bo hue to be full.  The prices are very reasonable, and the family that runs this place was very friendly and nice. They asked if we enjoyed our meals and the lady who cooked the bun bo hue actually came out and asked us if it was too spicy, I said it was great of course.  Will be back once the weather becomes more bike friendly."}
{"text":"I really like this place - great food, lovely service and cheap prices. A wonderful combination. The beef stew and rice is one of my favourite dishes. So tender. So flavourful. An east-end gem! I've always wanted to try their banh mi but, unfortunately, they always seem to be out of baguettes. Hope to be able to try it some time soon."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese in the city. We come here all too often.  Fresh, flavourful and delicious."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place for vietnamese food. The family that owns it is super sweet. I once made an order and requested no peanuts, and for orders after that, the owner always asked if peanuts were okay. The price can't be beat and the quality of the food is just superb! It's delicious and the portions are very generous. I can't eat at another vietnamese restaurant without comparing them to Bach Yen."}
{"text":"Have to agree with Eric L.on this one. This place is CLEAN.   The SO and I wanted to give this place a shot since technically it is the closest Pho place to our house. He had Beef Satay, I had Pho Ga (As I do not eat Beef Pho). We then split an order of spring rolls. The food came FAST. The service was GREAT. The Tea was HOT and the bill with taxes and tip! was $20.   To say this is a hidden gem is an understatement. For the moment at least, they may have stolen the spot of best Pho joint in the city. An enthusiastic 5 stars.    They also do catering.. hmmm."}
{"text":"Charming little mom and pop joint in East Chinatown.  Stopped by here for lunch after recommended from Yelp.  The restaurant was pretty empty on a Saturday noon as we are the only one dining.  Ordered pho tai nam and bun ho Hue and the owner kindly asked us how spicy we prefer.  Opt for extra spicy and boy that did not disappoint.  Bun no Hue has lots of spice and herb, full of zest and flavour.  The spicy level on spot as most place made bun bo Hue too mild.  Cut of meat is average.  Pho is also satisfying with lots of sprout, basil and onion.  The broth is clean, fresh with star anise flavour, quite delicious.  Also ordered spring roll and goi cuon but both are let down by uninspiring filling.  The wrap on spring roll tasted like average Chinese spring roll, not recommended.  Portion here is decent and reasonable price, and I am glad this joint has survived so far during neighbourhood revamp.  Service here is friendly had frequently come to check on us to see what we need.  I wouldn't go all the way and say this is the best pho/bun bo Hue I've had.  Personally I would still favour Pho Linh on College, but I would definitely visit here again if I am in the area."}
{"text":"This place is bomb. I had the Bun Bo Hue. Sooo delicious flavourful and a good spice to it. Did I mention the flavour? My friend had a seafood soup and he said it didn't disappoint. We also had a shrimp roll, those were yummy as well. I will be going back here to try other dishes for sure. I recommend 100%. Friendly and fast service as well, and prices were excellent."}
{"text":"I love this place! It has the best food ever! My favourite food is #19:). My Place is really close to here so we go to eat a lot there. Plus no msg!"}
{"text":"The only places I go to for pho are my parents' and this place. I find Bach Yen's pho has more of an anise flavour which I've grown to really enjoy. Aside from that, it is just like going to my parents: really delicious authentic food, Vietnamese music, the occasional family bickering, and the owner also looks like my dad. They always ask about peanut allergies so I imagine they would be relatively accommodating for dietary restrictions. Decor is nothing special but who cares."}
{"text":"I was excited to taste their Pho after reading the highly review of their good taste Pho. We were in for a shock, Bun Bo Hue is just a joke. Mango shake is nothing like it.  I felt to drive to my last place in Toronto to have a second to fill my taste."}
{"text":"Totally great place. Very unassuming and charming. Its on our list of regular places for Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Bun Bo Hue is by far my favorite Vietnamese dish and my go-to whenever I see it on the menu. Bach Yen was special in that they have different spicy levels, something I've never seen before. I asked the guy what level he recommended and he said people usually get \"medium\" although it's still very spicy. Which I thought was weird that it would be a medium if it was considered very spicy. Long story short, he was right. It was delicious but probably the most spicy Bun Bo Hue I've ever had. Was so thankful I didn't go above \"medium.\""}
{"text":"Very nice family own restaurant. Excellent authentic Vietnamese food. Very good service. The owner really cares about its customer."}
{"text":"My favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Toronto. The BBQ vermicelli (pork and beef is my favorite) is amazing and is constructed very simply, but is done so well. The pho is absolutely delicious with no MSG from what I can tell. It is aggressively seasoned with star anise, but I really enjoyed it. For me the strong star anise flavor is what made the pho very unique compared to most places.   In addition, the portion sizes are great considering the price and the place is relatively clean (except the washrooms - atypical of most Vietnamese restaurants).   Finally, what really stood out the most about this restaurant is the front of the house is run by an extremely friendly father and son combo that provided great service.   This is my goto Vietnamese restaurant and I refuse to go anywhere else! If only they delivered I would eat here every week."}
{"text":"Seemingly athentic pho, absolutely amazing staff. I had a bad pho craving this afternoon and I just didn't want to go to any mediocre pho place. It took me 45 mins to get here and it was well worth it. I'll go back to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"The entire experience is bomb. Its not high class but cool for a cute affordable date. Or even a quick meal. Prices are so decent 6.50 for an entire bowl of awesomeness. They don't skimp on meat either. I've been here more than 10x always great. The owner I believe and his son are both very friendly. The broth has So much depth. You can distinctly taste the fennel seeds , star of anise hmmm so good.  Go here you must!!!!! Best pho so far"}
{"text":"First visit and for dinner. Service is good, we were offered the choice of cooked/raw bean sprouts and they offered both because we have different taste. Pho broth was good, flavorful, and not greasy. Noodles were on the soft side, which I like but my fiancé would prefer slightly tougher. Beef and meat balls were perfect. Real Vietnamese folks so that's a huge plus and I would recommend visiting. We'll be back when we're in the area."}
{"text":"A nice family run restaurant. I love their bun bo hue and rice and pork chop. Parking in front of the street is free after 6pm. I'm Vietnamese and this is one of my favourite Vietnamese places to go to in Toronto."}
{"text":"Really good Pho!!! Very flavourful soup base and more meat than noodles (which is awesome)"}
{"text":"Cleanest pho place I've ever been to in Toronto. The bright fluorescent lights indicate they have nothing to hide. The pho is incredible.  Warning: There's the owner's weird teenage son who reads manga on his computer."}
{"text":"I came here because I live nearby. I wanted to try the banh xeo but that's only served on weekends- so I defaulted to the bun bo hue and got shrimp fresh rolls to start. I asked for the mild bun bo hue but HOLY CRAP it was spicy AF. There was already a layer of red chili oil floating on top of it and I already spooned off most of it. I was zero prepared for the spicy slap in the face I was about to get.   Aside from not being able to feel my mouth for the majority of my meal- I liked this place. Owner was friendly and I would come back to try something else. I will not be ordering the bun bo hue again."}
{"text":"Basic and cheap... Decided to go basic and have wonton with egg noodle. My little one got grilled chicken and rice. The husband got regular beef soup with vermicelli noodles.  They do use MSG. Quite a bit of MSG I would say. I thought I found a hair in my daughters chicken and he said it was from the lemon grass... UMMM I don't know but I'll have my daughter eat around that area. I'm sure we have eaten worse lol Just didn't catch it.  Overall it's cheap. Food is mediocre and not worth the trek from the city. The gentleman that served us was really nice and deserves a 5 stars       Oh and it's not an authentic Vietnamese restaurant."}
{"text":"Wonderful fresh food at great value.  Try the pho."}
{"text":"Was out shopping on saturday at the weird Gerrard Square, something still creepy about that place.    Anyhow needed to get some grub for DH at home nursing hangover and the mall court selections were lacking (however i have heard the Roti guy is quite good)   and I didn't want to go greasy so instantly thought of PHO.    Although we have frequented the chinese restaurants on the Gerrard strip for the last 12 years for some strange reason haven't tried the many PHO places.  Lucky for me that Bach Yen is the first one you reach when driving west.  Two large soups, Chicken and the spicy Satay Beef.  The chicken was tender & all white meat, the broth fantastic and the portions huge.  The Satay beef for those wanting a little spice is the go-to it was excellent,  beef very tender.   Everything fresh fresh fresh.    Very nice people that own the place, husband and wife.  For those who don't know what to order no worries they both speak english fluently. In fact it was the wifes selection for me on the Beef Satay.  Going back tomorrow for lunch with 5 people, will update.  2 large PHO take-out, $14"}
{"text":"Came here on a weeknight and there was only one waiter manning the floor. The spring rolls weren't too greasy. The pho noodle soup is ok but I have had meatier soups. You probably want to get a side or appetizer with the small bowl, as there isn't that much meat or noodle in it. The satay skewers are very savory and tender. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My favorite neighborhood resto. Run by a caring family that makes delicious and reasonably priced food. This is our staple take out restaurant.   #81 the char grilled marinated beef + spring roll (bo nuong + cha gio) is phenomenal."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Pho however, I always go to Train or 88. I wanted to try somewhere else. I went on Yelp and yelpers felt positively about this place so I decided to try out this place. I ordered my usual Chicken and Rare Beef Pho and my boyfriend ordered the Satay Beef noodle soup. The owner warned him to not order that because it was really spicy so we ordered something similar in which the owner recommended. I really liked my noodle soup and my boyfriend enjoyed his (we went back again the second time and he ordered the Satay Beef (dry and mild spiciness level) and he end up liking that too).   Another thing to note is they have incredible Vietnamese buns. I ordered the chicken and it was delicious. Not to mention, the prices for all their items were low.   However, there are a few things they are lacking in. For one, it probably would increase their sales if they renovated. The wall we sat next to was cracked and not nicely fixed. Customers who care more than just the food quality and price will definitely be bothered about how old the store looked. I think a lot of people walking around Broadview wouldn't consider going in because the store looks old. Also, there usually isn't more than 3 groups in there.   Another thing is they don't have quite a few things on the menu. For example, there isn't the Vietnamese and Thai dessert. They also sometimes don't have Vietnamese buns. It's a little disappointing if you went and expected to have it."}
{"text":"This is one of my two favorite Vietnamese restaurants in town. Food never disappointed. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Broth = to die for Portions = amazing Noodles = well done  Best pho I have ever eaten"}
{"text":"I really didn't want to write this review. I really wanted to like you, Bach Yen. Truly. Especially since it was on Têt that we dined (thanks for opening that evening, by the way), and you seemed so friendly on the phone, and I like reviews where other diners describe the friendly pop of the mom-and-pop business. But your hair really did you in. Just a single strand. Please, invest in a hairnet.  Yes, I had read that other review noting the hair in the food, but I thought, \"Hey, it can happen. It does to me, from time to time in my own kitchen.\" I knew the reviews here on Yelp were mixed, so I really wanted to go and try the \"best pho place\" to see if you truly were an undiscovered little gem as the \"best Vietnamese place in Chinatown East.\" Alas.  First, the food: the pho indeed had a remarkable taste. We really could taste the anise and spice mix. Thumbs up. The coconut chicken soup was wonderful as well. The chicken satay and wonton soup were average. I had to try the turmeric seafood stir-fry (never seen that on a Viet menu before), and I have to admit that I was disappointed: waaay too much of the turmeric as to be overpowering.  Now, on to the crab meat-avocado spring roll. First, the taste was just okay. I mean, I've never heard of another Viet restaurant doing this traditional goi cuon with avocado and crab sticks (which everyone knows is imitation crab, so I just wish restaurants would start listing it as such on the menu). But we didn't have any issue with it until . . . my son bit into his second roll and whispered to me almost embarrassingly, \"There's a hair in my roll.\" Oh dear. You know how those soft rice papers are translucent? Yeah. Last thing you want to see staring through there is a nice long black hair. Because my son had bitten into the roll, the hair was also in the other half. Ewww.  I called our friendly server and spoke quietly to him (we were the only customers in the place at the time, but still, decorum). \"Excuse me, so sorry, but there's a hair in the roll.\" He genuinely seemed embarrassed and quickly took it away. I heard him say to the woman in the kitchen (whom we had seen previously, walking out into the dining area, sans hairnet), \"There's a hair in the roll!\" Then he came back and asked if we'd like another roll. At this point, my son's appetite for that was gone, so he said no thanks, and ate his soup. Here's the kicker: at the end of the meal, the server offered to charge us \"only\" for half the dish, since my son had eaten the other (supposedly unblemished) roll. Gee, how kind. On a $3.50 item, you couldn't just have foregone that other $1.75 to please a customer who had just bitten into a hair?!? Guess you didn't care about them coming back.  On another note, too bad the \"blender was broken\" on a night when you had planned to close early to get home for Têt, so we couldn't have a milkshake. Other than that, your service was friendly.  Overall, the food wasn't half-bad, but that whole hair incident and then not even just making a $3.50 plate complimentary . . . shaking my head in disbelief. My husband gave you a hefty tip, and told me, \"Consider that my gift to for their Têt\". I wouldn't have. I guess by his offering an undeserved large tip, our family knew already that . . .   we won't be back. Sorry."}
{"text":"I'm always on the hunt for good pho, and the key to a great pho is the broth and the size/quality of the meat toppings. I can say this pho was legit (see photos). You can tell the broth was slow cooked nicely, full of zest and herbs. I knew the broth was flavorful when I found myself slurping the soup even after all the noodles were gone.   We ordered a small and a large #24 Rare beef, beef flank and beef tripe (Small $5.25, Large $6.25). Meat to noodle portion was in check, no meat swindling here. This is one of the few pho shops I've been to that serves chunks of beef in addition to beef slices, total win.   No good pho is without a great avocado shake ($3), and I'm happy to say their avocado shake was fairly sized and blended well.   Comparatively good service, affordable prices and tasty food - this family pho shop is a winner in my books. I pho-sure recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"Great little spot tucked away! I went in on a Thursday night at 8:30. We were the only table. Service was fast! Prices are also great!  I dont see many places that serve a small pho for under $6 anymore. I got the shrimp spring rolls and small order of pho. My friend had their vermicelli. The shrimp rolls were fresh and delicious with 3-4 medium sized pieces of shrimp in them each. It was served with a sweet sauce topped with peanuts. The small pho was a bit on the smaller side. If you're hungry I would definitely order the next size up. The soup was delicious, which is always a good sign! It was sweet but not MSG kind of sweet. There wasn't too much oil in the broth either. I was impressed with their broth! I could just drink it by itself! The meat was also good. I would definitely come back for their pho. Its a hidden place with cheap and delicious pho! Service was quick too!  The place did seem a bit small and run-down but with that aside I would definitely recommend this place to people around the area."}
{"text":"Had bun ho hue and rare beef pho there. Price cannot be beat. Flavour and on portion on point. Service is slower than other pho places but that's okay if you're not in a rush."}
{"text":"Pretty good pho for a amazing price, under $7.00 after tax! Plain broth pho is what I ordered, the soup is fresh and lots of meats. Opens everyday, great for lunch because it's not too packed."}
{"text":"I pass by this place almost everyday and I've never thought to try it until I've read great reviews about it. They has great pho, one of the best I've tried and the crispy wontons were delicious! The open hours are odd though, 12-3 for lunch the 3-9 for dinner, but understandable there's not much employees, great litttle place! They are super polite as well, always a plus!"}
{"text":"This is an old review that I forgot to post...  The rare beef and brisket pho was quite tasty. The beef broth was not as beefy as Pho Pasteur's but was very nicely flavored and well-balanced. No hint of the dreaded MSG laden broth.  A small bowl and a mango shake came to just over $10 after tax and tip. The portion size left me satisfied as a light meal Service was courteous and efficient. The room was warm and humid, verging on being stuffy.  The vietnamese music, in the background, was at a welcome volume (unlike other places where the music or TV is overwhelming).   I would return next time I am craving pho in the east end."}
{"text":"Vietnamese crepe was great!  $7.50 for a giant thin crepe filled with bean sprouts, meat and some shrimp too.  Served with lettuce, coriander, mint, pickled veg, and cucumbers.  You're supposed to cut a piece of crepe and wrap it in the lettuce along with your own toppings, then dip it in the sauce and enjoy!  Yum!  I had the bun today with two types of beef.  One kind was wrapped in bacon stuffed with some onions.  The other was beef wrapped in betel leaf and I believe it had some onions in there too.  Both were really tasty.  Why is this place not busier? The prices are right for a nice, homemade meal.  It's a family business after all."}
{"text":"Probably the best pho I've ever had in Toronto! Price is extremely reasonable and broth is to die for! HIGHLY recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Be careful coming here. i guess the workers pick and choose when they feel like charging you more than the menu states. Food was decent, but my meal was unbearably spicy even at mild. At the end the man brought me my bill, which ended being a few dollars more expensive then it was supposed to be. i was told after asking him why he charged me more that the prices had changed but he didn't update the menu. maybe something you should tell the customer before they order and getthe bill. it was still relatively inexpensive but that made me quite upset..."}
{"text":"All around the best Vietnamese restaurant in Toronto. The best value for your $, delicious food, and incredible Bun bo hue and pho, and even better service. The owner who works as the sever in this restaurant is very attentive and always looking to satisfy his clients, and looking for your feedback for example \"is the spicy level ok? (Of the bun bo hue)\" or any reason why you may not finish the food lol  My wife and I call him Mr. Bach Yen because we don't know his name lol but he is amazing, he legitimately cares about his restaurant and food."}
{"text":"Can't really say anything bad about this place.  Sure it's not the cleanest or most updated Vietnamese restaurant in the area, but the service and quality makes up for it.  It is run by a very pleasant couple, with the husband doing most of the waiting.  Granted, I've had the beef noodle soup just about every time I've been here, but it's pretty good.  Their broth has a distinct flavour to it.  The fatty beef and tendon they use, I find is better than others.  The noodles are also authentic in texture.  We did try the bun once and it was average.  There's a good selection of viet food around this area, but I find I keep coming back to Bach Yen."}
{"text":"The reviews here were awesome, so we decided to order take out from here.  I unfortunately agree with some of the other reviews.   First, we were hung up on when we called - which should have been my first hint.  Then the line was busy, but finally we got through to a girl that rushed me so quick my husband asked of I actually ordered anything.  We have had much better then what we ordered from the Gerrard St.  Location.  The spring rolls were dry and hard, the dip for them tasted and looked like coloured water.  My husband had the rare beef pho which he said would have been good if it was actually hot.  The rare beef was thrown over the noodle which were all bloody- rare beef should be kept separate.  I ordered the spicy shrimp soup.  Every single one of the shrimp were not deveined (or in other words de-pooped).  They were all sliced tho- maybe don't know the point of that slice is to remove the poop out of the shrimp??!!  Also, mine soup was room temperature too. Flavour would have been better had I had a hot and not seen poop in the shrimp I was supposed to put it in.  Then the pork vermicelli was no where as good as others we have had in the Gerrard area.  More food was wasted then eaten sadly.  We won't be trying the food here again.    We the food is better when you go in the restaurant, but we won't be wasting our time trying with each location."}
{"text":"Seeking good Vietnamese food in Riverdale, made my first visit to Bach Yen on a quiet Tuesday night based on positive online reviews.  Simple, tasty food at bargain prices in a no-frills environment made Bach Yen a place that I will definitely visit regularly.  Really enjoyed fried fish with lemon sauce."}
{"text":"This place was good. My husband and I both got pho. I ordered a large so I could share with my 3 yr old and the portion was very generous. I liked the beef balls, they were soft with no tendons. The flavour of the soup was good but we found it a bit too salty. That's why I didn't give 4 stars.   We also ordered pork spring rolls and veggie spring rolls and we all enjoyed them.   The meal was cheap and why we would probably go back if we were in the neighbourhood. For 2 bowls of pho, 2 orders of springrolls and drinks ..it was about ~$25."}
{"text":"What a complete and total disappointment.   My partner and I went to Bach Yen for dinner tonight after reading amazing reviews. We ordered goi cuon tom (shrimp spring rolls), bun bo (beef with vermicelli... I think his was supposed to have lemongrass), and I ordered banh xeo (vietnamese 'pancake'). After we ordered, we were informed that the kitchen wasn't making banh xeo and we could get it on Thursday through Sunday. There were few options on the menu that were suitable for someone who didn't eat meat, so I ordered bun ca kien giang (fish noodle soup, specialty of kien giang).  I think the waiter was trying to be helpful but he was condescending throughout the multiple interactions we had. In our first interaction, I ordered in Vietnamese as I typically do (as I lived in Vietnam for several years). In other restaurants in the area, my ordering in Viet is taken with reception; in this case I couldn't even tell if he himself was or spoke Vietnamese.  As for our food... the spring rolls were good but the peanut sauce was incredibly sugary. Our mains were atrocious. I think people come here because the price is so good; but it's not even worth the price. The soup tasted like fish that had been sitting in water for a few hours and the fish itself looked inedible. I ate 1/3 of the bowl and then felt so sick I had to stop. My partner said his meal was equally bland and while the beef looked good, he said that it wasn't marinated as the name suggested and was also incredibly bland.   The meal was nothing like we expected and after eating 1/3 - 1/2 of our meals (respectively), we both felt incredibly sick and opted to leave instead of enduring one more bite."}
{"text":"A fly landed in my soup and the owner didn't even offer to replace it! I literally had to insist that he pick up the bowl and replace it with a fresh one. I was insulted! He made it seem like I put it there, the he gave me a \"what do you want me to do\" look. I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese place ever!!! A lot less msg than anywhere else I have ever been to. Food was great. Our server was attentive and explained how to properly eat the food we ordered."}
{"text":"Family owned business where from my highly assumptive mind, the husband runs and the wife cooks. Very polite and multi-lingual in both Vietnamese and English.  Free street parking on Sundays!  It was not too busy when we visited, and considering the hour was 1:30PM with just 1 occupied table, made us nervous.  BEST: the chrysanthemum tea!  Overall, food quality is alright. There definitely are better Vietnamese restaurants throughout Toronto, but for rice dishes ($6.25) to be equal to Pho special, it's a win.   We recommend not trying the rice and curry dish.  The rice and bun dishes are ok (2.5/10)."}
{"text":"One of the better places for Vietnamese food in this Chinatown. Seems to be a family run joint and it does have a very cozy feel to the restaurant. Service is very considerate and I think surpasses a lot of restaurants in this lackluster Chinatown. I would recommend this place over Xe Lua by a long shot as the pho here is quite distinct and not overly overkill with the MSG. The broth at this restaurant is a bit stronger in the star anise flavor but the ingredients the choice of noodles and meat just seem to work close to near harmony. The satay is quite tasty especially with the peanut sauce, pay the extra it'll be well worth it. The grilled meat here is also tasty as well served on the vermicelli (they use a type of thin noodles that a lot of restaurants don't use but I prefer this type of noodle a lot more). This will probably be one of my favorite Vietnamese restaurants when I'm down in this area of Chinatown. Keep up the good work, good service and good food guys."}
{"text":"Excellent Pho!  Really tasty broth with nice spices.  Endearing father server and mother cook, with requisite snotty teenage daughter (she was polite to us).  Good prices and the small bowl of soup is almost actually a small.... still quite large."}
{"text":"As other reviewers have said, this is good food. And inexpensive, too. For the food, this place rates 4 1/2 stars. What gets it all the way to 5 stars is the tea. It's green tea with chrysanthemums, and not only does it taste better than any tea I've had in an Asian restaurant, but it's also good for you, too. If you like the tea as much as we did, ask the owner to point you towards the Chinese medicinal store to the west on Gerrard where you can buy the chrysanthemum flowers (if you need green tea, too, get it in the nearby Chinese grocery store)."}
{"text":"As a disclaimer, I want to say that I really wanted to like this because of the positive reviews on Yelp. The average rating here is 4.5 stars out of 5, but my experience here was meh. I came here with a friend on a day after going to Riverdale Park and convinced her to try the food in the area. Originally we were going to another place but they took cash only and we only had credit and debit which this place accepted. We entered and got to sit anywhere we liked as we were the first and only customers at the time we came in. We got our menus and ordered.   Price: Good. My friend and I ended up ordering a large pho to share which was only $6.25 which is a great price if you are on a budget.  Taste/quality: The food we ordered... It tasted alright, the broth tasted a little bland compared to pho soups I've tried before but better after I added some sauce.   Service: Slow. Afterwards, we wanted to order some drinks as takeout but the wait for those took so long, much longer than necessary. I used to make drinks as a barista, so I know how long making a smoothie should take. The restaurant wasn't even busy, either, so the long wait time didn't make sense to me and I considered just leaving without the drink and paying for the meal, but I decided to wait it out. Anyways, when the drinks finally came, it DID taste good but the wait was not reasonable considering we were the only ones in the restaurant who had an order going (everyone else had food on their tables and we were in the restaurant at a non-mealtime hour) and it took almost 20 minutes to get a smoothie to go.   Tip: Perhaps hire more staff?"}
{"text":"5 stars for the pho.  Amazing.  On par with Pho Tien thanh 0 stars for the deep fried spring rolls.  Gross."}
{"text":"As advertised. Place is plain, service was ok. The beef pho with tripe was amazing. I asked for extra tendon (not on menu?) not a problem. Delicious! I'll be Bach. Can't believe I just typed that."}
{"text":"Don't be put off by the sketchiness of the area and even when you walk inside the restaurant.  Yes, it's clean, but has a distinct smell - mmm Chinatown. The three of us walked in around lunch time on Friday. There was a group of three regulars at a round table, and what we suspected was the owners son, with a computer monitor and laptop at the back.   Clearly family owned, the service was really friendly. He offered us cold or hot tea, and was really nice when I asked him how big stuff was as he pulled out two different sized bowls.   The menu had lots to choose from, including pho, bun, some chinese soup noodles, and other dishes I look forward to coming back and trying.   What was best about the place though, was the food was actaully REALLY GOOD. And great value for money. Small Pho ($5.93 including taxes). And Small was actually a good size, packed full of meat and noodles (good ratio).  Everyone commented on the sprouts being super clean, and seems like it, but they don't remove the ends (not many places do).   We also ordered a Spring Rolls to share. Thin Chinese style wrapping, but not as greasy as I though, however, not sure what was the filling. I think I'd go with the veggie spring rolls next time.   My co worker also had a Satay Beef with Egg Noodle. Wow that looked really good, and came with soup on the side. Also under $10.   So despite of the environment, the food was tasty, and we'll probably be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Checked in today cause my daughter wanted some pho. We ordered the large but the owner said it would be too much for her and he was right. Noodles were good. My wife liked her beef (better than some other places we tried) and the green curry beef for me was good as well. Good price. Friendly service. Will be making this a regular stop when we are hungry for pho."}
{"text":"This place gives me so much life. Affordable prices and comfort food that hits the spot, you really can't go wrong.  If you ever decide to stray away from the classic pho, order the bun bo hue! That's my go-to order along with spring rolls. Their Vietnamese iced coffee is also great - it is a strong (albeit very sweet) concoction that would be amazing on a hot day."}
{"text":"Love this place ... Family owned and ran the nicest ppl ! Great food probably the best Vietnamese food in the area"}
{"text":"Real Mom and pops Shoppe feel, nice and cozy. The pho is absolutely delicious! The prices were very fair on the menu; service was warm"}
{"text":"Wanted to like this place, food was okay, ordered one of the 6.75 pork chop dishes. Was asked for 9.25 when I paid, told the guy he was a good and put 9 dollars on the counter and left."}
{"text":"Wednesday night dinner had the Bun Bo Hue and the Banh Xeo. Bun Bo hue was good, the broth was very flavourful however even mild was quite spicy. Although it was served with a variety of meats I was disappointed they don't serve it with pig feet. The banh xeo was very good you can taste the coconut in the crepe - was also quite large and lots of filling. Make sure you eat with with the lettuce and all the veg and herbs.  Overall the meal was good and I would definitely come back to try something else or eat the same thing again lol"}
{"text":"Really good food, great price. The herbs were really fresh and service was good too. I would come here again."}
{"text":"My first time to the store. I ordered pho, which is tasty. Although it's not the best pho I've ever had, the price is cheap."}
{"text":"The owner is very friendly, and the service is great! The satay beef egg noodles (#29) was delicious, I tried it medium spicy and it was too hot for me to handle. The owner hooked me up with some cold water, and I cooled down."}
{"text":"I really like this place. It's cheap, service is friendly and the food comes out fast.   My usual go-to's are:  1) pho ga: the broth is nice, light, and savoury. A perfect dish for when you're feeling under the weather or on a cold day  2) mi bo ko: a nice savoury beef noodle dish with a hint of tomatoes  3) bun with spicy beef & lemongrass:  nice and spicy  The only criticism I have of the place is that the restaurant sometimes has some irregular hours but lately they've been open every time I've gone."}
{"text":"Awesome Viet-Thai place, a cut above the rest in Gerrard Chinatown.  This place is my go to pho place. Quick, cheap, filling.  But what sets this place apart is the cleanliness and friendly family run atmosphere.  The trimmings like bean sprouts and mint leaves are crisp and fresh.  The springs rolls are nothing out of the ordinary, but less greasy than most.  Give this place a shot, you will be impressed."}
{"text":"I go there all time.  The dishes are really delicious, the staff/owner is really attentive & I think the prices are on the cheap side.  The pho offers a good strong broth, the rice wrap (wrap it yourself) are consistently delicious and it comes in a generous portion with various veggies & perfectly grilled meat.  This is by far the best Vietnamese resto I've been to in Toronto."}
{"text":"Weirdest restaurant experience.  Was so excited to come here because the reviews have been so good! We were waiting for 50 minutes on food... me and my partners food came out 10 mins apart.  Then when we finally got our food, shortly after hearing screaming and arguing in the boh.  Our server stormed out with her outwear and left.... awks  Food was very average and not up to expectation."}
{"text":"I come here once a week and always get Bun Bo Hue.They have hands down the best one in the city. You can even ask for the vegetarian option. The owner is this lovey man who really cares for his customers."}
{"text":"I had the bun bo hue at very spicy and it was fiyahh!!! I'd recommend to go for medium spicy if it's your first time here. I can't choose between here and Que Ling nearby as both are good to me except Que Ling is not as spicy.  I would pass on avacado shake as I had much better elsewhere."}
{"text":"Whoa. Hidden gem alert! Hidden gem alert!  Listen, I like my pho. I've been eating it for decades. Tien Thanh, Golden Turtle, Little Coxwell, Pho Dau Bo - I've been around the block. We were checking out Gerrard East and this restaurant took us by complete surprise.   Broth - strong taste and herby nose. Excellent. Meat - thick cuts and well textured. Not paper beef. Terrific. Ambiance - weird, smelly and uncertain. Washroom is in a basement dungeon. Authentic.   This place needs more recognition."}
{"text":"Ratings: Food: 7.5/10 Drink: 6.5/10 Service: 8/10 Value: 8/10 Hygiene: 7/10 Aesthetics: 7/10  We came here around noon on a Sunday to come for some pho to warm up. Our group of 15 managed to get seated at the 2 large tables near the counter.   I had the house special pho, banh xeo (vietnamese pancake), and of course, an Avocado shake. The pho had a really flavourful broth, it was heavily spiced, which threw me off, because I expected a stronger beef flavour to compliment the spices. The portion was decently sized. The banh xeo was much better. I haven't had a decent banh xeo in Toronto in some time. The portion was large and the flavours were good. The coconut milk definitely shone through on this. The only thing that could be better about this would be more lettuce. I only got 4 leafs, which is definitely not enough for all of the pancake.  The avocado smoothie was a big disappointment. There was so much ice in the smoothie you could taste the chunks. The flavours were also off, probably due to the addition of other fruits?  The cost is typical of Vietnamese food around $8-10/entree. The value of the portions is good.  Seating sits a total of around 30-40 people so it could get be better   The service here was fine.   A decent place for Vietnamese food, one of the few with banh xeo. Some things could be better, but decently priced and the portions are good."}
{"text":"Best Pho in Gerrard Chinatown.  It's not bland but packed full of flava flav!  Coming back to try some other dishes and sure to bring some friends along."}
{"text":"We were on a calculated hunt to find some good Pho in the area and they did not let us down!   Great service delicious pho and even better prices you can't go wrong. I requested a custom pho of veggies and tofu and they were more than happy to oblige.   My friend order the Pork chops with rice and she said it was delicious and even grabbed one for her husband to go! I highly recommend popping in here if you're craving some good old Viet comfort food :)"}
{"text":"came here on a very cold winter night with my boyfriend who had been craving banh xeo (viet style savoury crepes) for awhile. we live in the neighbourhood and while there are plenty of vietnamese restaurants, bach yen seems to be the only place we've found that offers banh xeo on their menu.   this place smells amazing. and by amazing i mean, as soon as i walked in, i smelled the cloves in the pho broth and i was sold. yeah, i like pho (who doesnt), i can even appreciate mediocre pho, but the pho here was probably the best in the neighbourhood. the broth is really, REALLY good, flavourful, full of depth. the portion size is generous (decent amount of noodles, decent amount of meat). the ingredients are fresh and cooked well (no overcooked rice noodles!). the prices are very, very fair.   the banh xeo was something new for me but very fresh, great portion size, and delicious! i dont have a basis of comparison but i'd definitely order it again.  the place was empty when we were there but a fair number of people came in for take out. don't be decieved by the desolate nature of the place and that it's a bit off from the hubub of east chinatown. the owner was attentive but not overbearing, asked us how our meal was, if we needed anything etc. friendly guy.   will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the pho broth was not to my liking. The taste of cloves over powered the broth. That said, it is all about preference. If you love that taste then the pho here will def rock your world, but if you prefer the broth like that of Pho Hung (@ the Spadina Chinatown) then this won't likely be your east end alternative."}
{"text":"Had the bun bo bue at medium spicy, mango shake and mango salad. I really enjoyed the salad and shake! Although it took over 30 minutes for my shake because there was only one waiter and he was the one also making the shakes. My gripe is with the spice level. I ordered medium for my soup, which came pretty spicy. My boyfriend also ordered medium in pad Thai and his came out ridiculously spicy. And we are no strangers to spice. We only ordered the medium level after reading the reviews below because other people commented on the crazy spiciness. Why not make the spice level correspond more correctly to what \"medium\" actually means? What would extra spicy be?? While I enjoyed the noodles in the bun bo bue, it was too spicy for me and I didn't finish it :-( I should have ordered mild (which would probably equate to a real medium) but I was worried because I wanted spice but isn't that what my medium should have been?? Nothing to bring me back here unfortunately."}
{"text":"Best pho I ever had and the cheapest too, small bowl is just $5.25 Canadian dollar but they give you a lot of meat and noodle. The owner is super nice and generous, very consistent broth as well. We're visiting Toronto and we already came here twice in 2 days, maybe third time before we leave because it's so good and cheap!!"}
{"text":"A bit away from east chinatown by a couple blocks, but a quiet and nice little place to get your vietnamese craving.  The pho was typical but still good.  The bun bo hue is extremely tasty and you can adjust just how spicy you want it!  They ask if you just want it with beef or add pork.  The owner is very nice and when I went there for the 2nd time.  He remembered me from weeks before.  They could use the radio or something besides a song that seems to be on repeat.  My brother had tried their beef curry and seemed to enjoy it.  I have not tried their bbq chicken on rice yet, but I'm sure they will not disappoint with portion and flavours.  It is extremely affordable and I would go back when craving Vietnamese."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT pho. Friendly service, even suggest 'smaller' sizes (quantity is good!). What I really appreciate; they aren't out to gouge you, very fair prices. I'm not an east end resident, if I did live near here, I'd go a lot..."}
{"text":"This is now my go-to place for Viet food downtown... a mom and pop shot in East Chinatown, this has been one of the places that still seem to be surviving in the hype of a neighbourhood revamp.  The first time was as good as our second, from the moment we walked into the restaurant. The owners always greets you and lets you sit as you please, as long as there is availability. He listens to the comments you make in case the music too loud, or you're close to an open door or kitchen.. he just wants to make your experience great.  The menu is versatile, with cross cultural dishes including Thai spices and flavours. We ordered the usual rare beef noodle soup, which was the only disappointment given that the beef was fully cooked. The owner even asks if we prefer our bean sprouts raw or cooked! (who does that!)  We also ordered fried fish with rice and mango salad - two large pieces of fried fish that was still moist and full of flavour, with nice compliments of a tangy mango salad. We ordered a beef vermecelli bowl, which included beef slices wrapped in seaweed and vegetables to accompany a HUGE bowl of noodles. It was my favourite dish of the night and could definitely feed two.  I decided to order a fried noodle dish w. tumeric and seafood - lots of shrimp, scallops and vegetables, and a very interesting flavour that I've never tried before.... glad to try something new and the family all enjoyed it as well.  The food is cheap, delicious and I'll  be back soon to eat in or take out. Don't underestimate this place if it seems empty.... it will fill up... always does."}
{"text":"Amazing place! I tried the spicy noodle soup (36 on the menu) and it was just great. My new go-to place for pho in the east end."}
{"text":"I had to re-visit this place 3 times just to get an understanding of the overwhelmingly positive reviews. Twice on my own by choice and a third because my friend raved about this place. After 3 visits I am still a very perplexed by the reviews.  Let's get the important stuff over with so let's get right into the Pho. The soup tasted great! You can tell this broth is as fresh as it gets. The portions are very good and the cuts of meat are pretty standard Vietnamese fare. Nothing really wows here but certainly does no disappoint.  The other soups such as the highly recommend soup with the duck leg in it was hard to describe. It was flavourful but really lacked depth and it was very salty. The flavour of the duck was very overpowering and the meat did not taste fresh. It tasted like leftover duck legs from last night's stew thrown into a pho broth.  The springs rolls are negligible at best. With a sub-par filling wrapped in a traditional Chinese spring roll wrapper (not the Vietnamese ones). The fresh hands rolls are just as uninspiring as well.  All in all, if you're in the area and you are desperate for pho then this may just be the best you can get. If pho is not what you are craving then there are plenty of good cheap eats in this part of town."}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant EVER. The pho is unbelievably good, but the real winner is the Bun Bo Hue (#36). So many restaurants don't make it spicy at all, but I get the medium spicy here and it's enough for me. My favourite food!"}
{"text":"For a place with so many high reviews, I have to say that I was expecting a little better.  Having stopped in here on a Friday night, my first surprise was how dead it was.  Being a visitor, maybe this is normal for this area or maybe there was something else going on but it was surprising none the less.  FOOD  Five of us ate here and I tried their 'summer rolls with shrimp' (which, while called just shrimp rolls in Ottawa, is something I always order) and their BBQ pork on vermicelli.  Some of the others ordered Pho.  I have to say that the shrimp rolls were a disappointment.  The shrimp didn't taste fresh and had a bit of a smell which I've never had with this type of a dish before.  The vermicelli dish wasn't bad but not as good as what I'm used to.  This of course depends on your personal tastes.  The others liked their dishes and the Pho smelled absolutely amazing (making me regret not ordering it).  SERVICE  Service was s-l-o-w...  While the restaurant was empty and the owner (I assume he was the owner) was well intentioned, the wait time was simply way too long for what we had.  This of course could be a one-off due to an issue in the kitchen or something but either way, it was slow.  PARKING  Unlike Danforth street up north, I was able to find parking on Gerrard Street quite easily so if you are driving you may be in luck.  --  As a visitor and based on our first experience, I would probably try another one of the Vietnamese restaurants on Gerrard first.  Again, maybe our experience wasn't typical but that is all I have to go by."}
{"text":"The food is not bad, but I can't help but feel that the place is cheap. The room and the utensils look old, and I think the cheapness is reflected in the quality of the food too. This is only my tentative evaluation after eating here once, and may change if I come here a few more times."}
{"text":"*Beware of their \"bait-and-switch\" tactic*  This was my first time here and I heard from a friend that they have very tasty and affordable dishes. My husband and I decided to try their bun vermicelli dishes (one w/pork and another w/chicken) priced at $6.50. Overall, the meals were satisfactory and at $6.50 a dish we can't complain.  However, when we went up to the cash register to pay the total came to $17.50. We told the man working there that our dishes were $6.50 each and he responded by saying that their prices had gone up. We then pointed out that that was not the price reflected on the menu and he responded by saying that those were old menus. We were annoyed at this point but decided to just pay and leave instead of arguing since it was only a couple of dollars extra.   Although the meal was decent and I do not doubt that their other dishes are great based on other Yelpers' reviews, we will not be returning to a place that is dishonest in their business."}
{"text":"I was going to be selfish and not share this gem with yelp, But the family that runs it are just too nice and I want them to succeed.  Bach Yen has quickly become my go-to place for pho and noodle soup. It's just one of those perfect no frills, no attitude, no overtly friendly staff looking for a big tip and up selling you on food you don't want and drinks you don't need sort of places.  The first thing that hits you as you walk in is the functional decor and the rich all enveloping smell of bone broth. It's a unique sensation, the moisture rich air with it's sweet aromas of star anise and peppercorns. The Pho broth is just right - not thin tasting as if its too watery, not enhanced with oil, just a robust clear broth with the sweet juicy taste of stewed bones and meat. The Tom Yum is spicy with the right amount of tang to sting and kiss your tongue at the same time. I also get the bacon wrapped beef special which comes with all the fixings to make your own rolls (noodles, rice paper, sauces, bean sprouts, mint etc.) There aren't a lot of veggie options and even those are average, but come to Bach Yen (cause chances are i'll be there - I go here too much) and you won't regret it."}
{"text":"My momma makes pho, and I think she would like bac yen. It's legit.  I enjoyed the flavour of the pho, the cold rolls, and mango salad.  I would say its better than anything in downtown chinatown. Great service, nice clean environment, though I didn't go to the washroom.  Overall, price and quality is great. If I lived around here I would go every week."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Will be back again! I have't had anything here that's not great. A notch above your average pho house."}
{"text":"I am from New York and love Pho. This restaurant served the Best Pho I ever had! I wasn't too hungry so didn't try more dishes. I never give a 5 but with this tasty bowl that burst  with favor, I have to!"}
{"text":"Ever since coming back from my trip to Vietnam, I've been looking for a good pho place in Toronto that serves a bun bo hue similar to the ones we had in Ho chi Minh. Today I finally found it! This place serves the best bun bo hue! The broth is perfect. We ordered mild spicy, which has quite a kick! I can't imagine how is their medium or regular spicy. Mild was perfect for me! Their regular pho was okay. The broth was good, but I didnt find it too special. The service was really good. The only down side is that the prices on the menu did not match our bill. The owner said that the prices went up..they just didn't change the menu."}
{"text":"Bach Yen has easily became my most visited pho/viet place. (They also do thai, but I go other places for that)  With no good pho close to home, I began the journey to find a regular joint to staisfy my insatiable cravings. China town east has better parking than Spadina, making it a good starting point. After a month or so of touring the pho options in the area, I finally settled on Bach Yen as my favourite.  Bach Yen is typical of the older Toronto Vietnamese restaurants you'll see in a China town, a little rough around the edges, and not the nicest atmosphere. But the food is great, always cooked well, priced right, and the owners are very friendly.  Highly recommended if you are looking for pho in the East end."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a high review because it touches a nostalgic memory of a time past, despite some obviously glaring issues. We arrived on a Sunday afternoon to a small family operation struggling to keep up with the customer demand. The service was slow (several tables got up and left after not being greeted/given menus/given tea) but they were obviously trying hard. The cook would run back and forth delivering orders, but the waiter was obviously confused/frazzled.  We ordered an app of satay peanut chicken skewers, one bowl of noodles each and a drink each. The satay skewers came relatively quickly, but they were not what we were expecting. Large chucks of chicken meat with not much peanut flavor or char, still not bad and edible. Our noodles took a long time to come out. A couple after us had their noodles before we did (I suspect they were regulars given the welcome they received). When our noodles did come, it was obvious why this place is so highly rated. The soup for the pho was authentic and delicious. The spices in the broth was nuanced and hard to find these days. Hats off to the chef behind the scene!    We never did get our drinks, since we watched them pull out cans from the kitchen to prepare them when our meal was already done. I just cancelled the drink order and paid the bill (cash or debit). Wish the service was better, but the food is definitely great!"}
{"text":"Be careful about this place, they tried to overcharge and rip me off!    We ordered a bowl of pho and a rice dish, both $6.25 each on the menu.  When I go to pay, the guy tries to charge me $7.50 each before tax claiming that the menu is 8 years old and isn't the current price.  He also goes onto say that you won't find pho anywhere for $6.25.    If your menu is old, either update it or tell your customers at the time of ordering the price in the menu isn't accurate!  We won't be returning.  Not only because of this scam, but also because the food was average and there's much better elsewhere.  I'd rather pay elsewhere more.  After going over some of the negative reviews for this place, seems like this is not the first time this has happened."}
{"text":"#BACHYEN #VIETNAMESE #RIVERDALE #TRADITIONALVIETNAMESE  This is my \"Pho Mi\" fix in Downtown. Pho Mi is a cheap and amazing food chain in GTA - and I've finally found it's equivalent in Downtown east. Tucked away in Riverdale, it can be a bit of a tough find, so I suggest you use a GPS if you're going to be a first timer. Took us 2 rounds around the block! The good news is that they have ample free street parking if you're venturing out after 6pm.   We tried the crispy wonton as an appetizer and it was pretty good! I ordered #24 - rare beef, beef flank and tripe soup. I recommend this as it was just PERFECT. My friend ordered a satay beef soup. This is a spicy soup, and mind you - even the MILD is spicy. She ordered a medium, and she had a hard time finishing it. The owner/server was nice enough and gave us some extra broth.   This place will be revisited. Don't want to share my amazing find, but I am. :)"}
{"text":"Soup base was totally different to most pho places -- as if with a herbal aspect to it which frankly, made it yummy, especially with the egg noodles being a fine accompaniment.  I'd definitely be back round 2 when I'm on the east end and then finish with it Wong's ice cream from just across the street!"}
{"text":"First of all I am writing this review because this is NOT just another pho place.  THIS is a world class chef skilled establishement and needs to be tried by everyone so they get extremely busy!!!   These are master chefs that have not been appreciated by enough ppl!!!! As you eat, the flavours develop on your tongue pretty much knocking you on your butt.  Tastebuds you did not know you had come alive!!!    Best pho and everything else!!! Service is quick!!!  If you have allergies, mention it and they will be very careful with you.  Call ahead as there are prep for dinner hours between 330 and 5 pm or so.  And that wait is worth your time trust me!!!  The flavours are unexpected and wonderful.  You can play on this menu. Order whatever you see- springrolls- packed with meat, dip them hmmm  Pho so many different types amazing prices too.  Vermiccelli or rice and meat dishes- big portions.  Hot or not- whatever your brain desires- have at it.  Delicious fresh smoothies!!!!  Just go."}
{"text":"I ordered a large bowl pho ($6.25) and an order of vermicelli w/ grilled beef, pork and spring rolls ($6.50) take-out today. I have read many good reviews about this place, but the pho turned out was not that good. They added too much herbs in pho broth with too little of meat and overwhelming noodles. The fish sauce that came with vermicelli was completely tasteless, I even had to put my home-made fish sauce for some flavour. This place is cheap but I rather spend $1 or so more to get better food at pho Linh or pho Tien Thanh.  Furthermore, they did not follow my orders at all. I told them not to put veggies in pho, but they put it in anw. I spent like a good 10 minutes of my life to take them onions and what not out of my broth. Additionally, I order grill pork + beef on vermicelli, they only put grill pork, I could not even find any pieces of beef. They also OVERCHARGED me. I have calculated a lot of times, 6.25 + 6.50 + tax = $14.41. However, they made me pay almost $17. I'm like wtf was that like 20% of tax or something. They thought I never came here so did not know the pricing and overcharged me. I have been to many asian restaurants but never met this situation. Many people gave good reviews about this restaurant, which I don't understand why. You could totally go to other better vietnamese restaurant in the west; I feel like the all restaurant in the east chinatown did not sell cheaper food compared to west chinatown due to the food quality and portion size.   p/s: I have tried bun bo hue here last time, the soup was full of fats and spicy. I could not taste anything but spiciness. I felt like the main ingredients in their broth was lemon grass, beef fats and chilli, which was not healthy at all for bun bo hue."}
{"text":"Really cheap Vietnamese food that gives a lot of meat. My friends and I usually order their house special pho noodle soup. You can special order XL ($1 or so more) and can add extra meat (e.g beef balls, tendons, tripe, etc) for extra cost (about $1 more). Their Mango Milkshake is good but I will not recommend their Avocado milkshake. For their shrimp fresh rolls, we would order it with avocado with additional cost but so worth it!"}
{"text":"Bach Yen is the best!!! Amazing pho, super affordable prices, huge menu to choose from. One of our go-to spots (we are regulars). The guy is super nice too.  Would definitely recommend the pho. Banh xeo is also a good dish to try (crispy rice pancake filled with string beans, veggies and herbs). If you love SPICY, try the Bun Bo Hue or the Thai hot and sour soup (#65-67 on the menu). Note that mild or medium is already v spicy. My friends order these items and always end up sweating profusely from the heat!"}
{"text":"Amazing service! The owner is the super attentive and polite. Great value and quality of food! Some favs include the pho and mango smoothie."}
{"text":"Came here because our usual pho place was closed.  Unfortunately, our experience did not warrant 4 stars.  Service time is much slower than the average Vietnamese restaurant.  There were only 4 ppl in the entire restaurant and yet it took more than 15 min to get our food.  The pho is decent but is overpowered by herbal spices.  Portions for a large bowl were smaller than comparable pho places.  Finally I was very annoyed with the pricing.  The large pho was 6.25 on the menu, but we were charged 7.25.  When I asked why, the server explained that the updated prices have not been reflected on the menu.  I read comments on Yelp stating that this was the case 20 days ago as well.  It's fine to increase prices given the recent wage hike, but not disclosing the price increase to customers is bad practice.  Will not be coming here."}
{"text":"Wonderful little local place, lovely family runs it.  Great value, delicious flavours.  Fresh rolls, soups and grilled dishes are so delicious, home made satay is excellent.  We'll keep supporting this fantastic local business."}
{"text":"This is the cleanest, friendliest, and best bang for your buck Vietnamese food I have been to yet in all of Toronto! The Pad Thai had 8-9 HUGE shrimp AND a good deal of chicken as well. It isn't the absolute best Pad Thai I have ever had however it was only 7.95 for a huge portion and better taste than Spring Rolls which charges around $12 for a smaller, bland tasting version.  The service by the husband, and the cooking by his wife make this family owned restaurant exceptional. Service was absolutely great and unlike some other cheapo restaurants they do not charge you for the tea and it is quite good.  The entire restaurant is absolutely spotless. The ambiance isn't the fanciest but it is homey and serves their purpose well.  These people care about their customers and make sure everything is fresh (been sprouts, mint, etc.) and charge a very reasonable (I'd say extremely cheap) price for a good quality meal that is a good portion size, flavour, and doean't look like it was just thrown on a plate like some other restaurants.  This is one of my favourite restaurants in all of Toronto. Not fancy, but honest, good, relaxing, cheap food with amazing service.  In short, go to this place!"}
{"text":"This is an awesome Vietnamese restaurant and definitely a hidden gem on the East side of the city.  The owner was very welcoming, nice, and give us fantastic service! The place itself is pretty clean in comparison to the standard Chinatown restaurants.   The menu featured everything typically found in a Viet restaurant, plus a few more authentic  dishes that other places don't offer! For example, the Viet crepe pancake called Banh Xeo is a must-try. The Pho was actually the best I've had for quite a while! The flank/rare beef in the beef was very tender and the soup was delightful (perfectly salted, not greasy, overall very flavourful).  Last but not least, the prices were ridiculously low for what you're getting! Definitely worth multiple visits and will be going back!"}
{"text":"Haven't actually been in the restaurant but my boyfriend picks us up the soup from there all the time and it is soooooo good! He said the owner is a super friendly guy and explained all the menu options to him when he first went in.  As far as I remember they don't have a website. I love the noodles they use here.  Everything is super fresh too.  Really good value for money."}
{"text":"Food was delicious ... and do not even get me started with the price!!! Super affordable and once again, the food was delicious. I ordered something spicy, but it was delicious even though I could not finish it because I could not handle the spice level and was told it was at its mildest. Will return if we are in the area again."}
{"text":"My go to spot for pho in Toronto. The broth here is unreal, prices are reasonable, staff is friendly. I normally get the pho and my wife gets the bunbohue (?), we've also had noodles and spring rolls here. Everything has been delicious. The overall ambiance of the restaurant is ummm authentic, but given the price, and the quality of food, no complaints.  If you into Vietnamese food, Bach Yen is a must try in the city."}
{"text":"Came out here on a very quiet Monday night. Was kinda worried about how empty this place was. But was pleasantly surprised. Food was fresh hot and tasty. Since i have a habit of going off menu our host graciously obliged by offering up a creamy coconut cream curry vegetable soup to die for.   Definitely going back.   Humble service, low prices, fresh ingredients, tasty home style food. Works for me!"}
{"text":"Awesome little family run spot. Great food, on a winter night. Added some heat to the lean beef Pho and it was amazing. Deep fried spring rolls were also very good, better than the healthier fresh rolls. Going to make this place a usual stop. Cheaaaaap too."}
{"text":"I visited the restaurant today for dinner, I had been before for lunch. We ordered the mango salad and fresh rolls to start, both delicious. My sister ordered the pho which was also delicious, I ordered the pad Thai with chicken and shrimp, unfortunately it was horrible. Our server asked if I would like it to be spicy, I said not to spicy (medium), but when it came out it was swimming in siracha hot sauce. It was way to spicy to be a medium (I can handle my heat). I would recommend for anyone who came here to stick to the Vietnamese food. I will be coming back again, but only for the pho!"}
{"text":"Just steps to the east of the infamous neighbourhood Vietnamese \"go to spot\" --Mi Mi.  I tried the rare beef and beef ball Pho. Delicious smooth broth.  IMO this place is better. Do give it a try, guaranteed it won't disappoint.   TIPS: -I needed the visual for the sign or I wouldn't have found it -lots of magazines to browse if your dining solo (outdated but who cares) -go for the large size Pho. Leave the noodles if your full, you will want to savor the broth -takes debit and Visa (Mi Mi doesn't)"}
{"text":"Yes! Definitely yes! If you want cheap, good Vietnamese food this is the place to go.  A large pho costs $6.25 or something ridiculous like that. It's not oily and portions are generous.  On top of that, the service was fast and the guy was super friendly. When we wanted extra condensed milk for my iced coffee, he literally brought out the whole can on a plate and said you can put as much as you want. If you're a pho lover like me, you'll know that Pho tien thanh on ossington is the go-to spot. Personally, the pho at Bach yen has the slight edge. Definitely comparable. Try it for yourself.. either way, you can't go wrong with a large pho for under $8 with tax in..  I'll be back for lunch again today :)"}
{"text":"Excellent service and excellent food. Small and sparsely decorated, the clients come for really really good Pho. I highly recommend it for the east Enders looking to satisfy the craving."}
{"text":"For our last meal in Toronto, we headed to the Chinatown area for some pho. All the Chinese food we've had during our stay was in Scarborough but since there seemed to be a decent sized Vietnamese population around these parts, we figured we would give the pho here a shot. It didn't let us down.  I got the small sized pho tai nam with rare beef & beef flank. The broth was on the lighter side but it was very clean. I have to give props to the chef here for this. Usually you see little droplets of oil floating on top of the broth but that was hardly the case here. They also used very little MSG, if any at all. The end result was that a little bit of flavor was sacrificed but I appreciated the lightness and the cleanliness of the broth. The rest of the stuff - like the noodles, rare beef and beef flank were all on point.   I tried the spring rolls as well. They were different from the ones I've tried in NY and LA in the sense that they were less porky and had more veggies. The skin was thinner, flakier and didn't come with lettuce leaves for you to wrap the rolls in. I think they were closer to Chinese spring rolls but enjoyable nonetheless.  We gobbled our food in 15 minutes,  thanked the very nice gentleman who brought us our pho (the owner I think),  hopped in a cab and left for the airport."}
{"text":"By far my favourite place.  Love the service here. Food is awesome, I HIGHLY recommend the                                           ****Bún bò Huê*****  Tons of flavor and spicy. If you could handle spicy food medium is perfect. There medium spicy lvl is high for most restaurants. I have tried the very spicy one, it had lots of flavour but my nose had to pay the pricy cuz I used up all of their tissue papers.   They are pretty nice if u ask them nicely for more meat, or if u would like to change the type of noodles."}
{"text":"I don't remember the last time I raved about a restaurant, but Bach Yen is a hidden gem on the east side and I want people to know about it. My husband and I were craving for legit pho, but didn't want to go all the way to the other side of town for Pho Tien Thanh because he was feeling under the weather.   We found this place tucked away in the forgotten East Chinatown and decided to give their Bun Bo Hue and Pho Ga a try. My bun bo hue HIT THE SPOT, and is IMO significantly better than Pho Tien's. The broth had a perfect balance of spicy, sour, and lemongrass flavours, yet was light enough for me to chug after I destroyed the noodles and meat. The dish also came with copious amounts of beef flank and oxtail, as well as cabbage, bean sprouts, and basil for garnish. It actually felt like a somewhat balanced meal, which is more than I can say for most pho experiences. Sam also really enjoyed his pho, although he sustains that Pho Tien is better.   You also can't beat the price: $6.50 for a large pho! We'll definitely be making this place our regular spot. :)"}
{"text":"Since moving downtown, we have been looking for our go-to Pho place. This one may be it since Pho Dau Bo at Weston/Finch is way too far now. We ordered our standard order: Vietnamese spring rolls, large pho and Grilled pork and Beef vermillici. The spring rolls left a lot to be desired,  despite it tasting like it was freshly deep fried but little flavour to the inside at all. We ordered the combo pho which was a pleasant surprise. The broth was flavourful with an intense lemongrass flavour to it. Most pho places are oily and salty but this one had beef and lemongrass flavour without tasting overly salty or greasy. The vermillici was good as well. I prefer the long flat noodle but the short thin noodles suffice. The meat was cooked well and the proportions for the pickled veggies, fresh veggies to noodles to meat was spot on.  Also service was great. The owner was really nice and kept checking on us. I'd def regard this as my go-to pho place downtown Toronto and recommend to others!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, good food, good value - nothing fancy in this place, but had a very satisfying meal."}
{"text":"I LOVE this little mom and pop hole in the wall gem in old school chinatown!  Best Bun Bo Hue in the city. Hands down (and I welcome challenges!) Their pho broth is a bit on the anise-y side, but still legit and does the trick when you want Pho. But for sure, I crave their bun bo hue all day every day.  Their home made sambal mixture chili sauce is so refreshing and delish. Goes great with the grilled meat rice dishes.  If you become a regular, they sometimes have daily secret menu specials.   Definitely a solid meal for under 10 a person. Plus it's never crazy crowded. You'd have to treak out to Mississauga if you want better pho or Bun Rieu even.  But this is my go to place for sure!"}
{"text":"Bach Yen is officially my favourite Vietnamese resto in East Chinatown.  You can't get pho this cheap and this good anywhere else in the city theses days. I love that it's a mom and pop resto ran by an lovely couple. The husband speaks fluent English and is super friendly.  He came by to ask if everything is good and if there's enough food. I am totally impressed!   We ordered the Bun Bo Hue, Spring rolls and Bun Xiao.  Everything tasted very authentic and flavourful.  The spring rolls were full of taro (yum) and crispy.  My Banh xeo comes with lettuce, pickled veggie and cucumber. The crepe was crispy with a nice hint of coconut. My husband loved his Bun Bo Hue, he ordered mild and thought it was spicy.   We can't wait to come back and try other dishes here."}
{"text":"We had bun bo hue and their signature wraps with the beef - both were beyond delicious! The atmosphere is a bit plain but the food makes up for it!"}
{"text":"This is our go to Vietnamese place, and the food is amazing everytime we go! The owner is really friendly and always makes sure that our food is right for our taste, and you really can't beat the prices here because the food is delicious!  We mainly go for the bun bo hue (which is perfectly spicy and flavorful), and they're very generous with all the sides that come with the noodles (plenty of mint, basil, sprouts, etc). My husband is from Vancouver and he even says this place has the best bun bo hue he's ever had.  The last few times, we've tried their grilled marinated beef with rice paper wrap + bacon (#79 on the menu). When we got it, we can't believe all that was only for $11! (see the picture; not pictured is their stack of rice papers that come with the dish). Everything was so tasty! We will definitely continue to come back here!"}
{"text":"To be honest, I was a bit skeptical about this place when I first walked in because they ran out of fresh fruits for our drinks... but then again, we went in an hour before closing time during a Saturday..  However, things turned better once our food came. Food was absolutely delicious; one of my friends struggled with spicy food; and the boss gave him fresh broth to help him dilute the soup (bon bo hue) without even being asked.. the boss totally knew what was going on after asking a few cold waters.  So points for honesty, customer service and for the food; huge points from me!!"}
{"text":"Honestly this is the best  Vietnamese restaurant in Toronto! The best Pho we have ever had. And for the moderate price you get the best customer service! The owner now remembers my Pho preferences and customizes my soup every time. A must-try!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night. The decor is pretty no frils, but it is pretty clean and not too cramped. The menu wasn't huge in my opinion, but the prices were right! We started with the cold shrimp rolls and they were very fresh and good. For my main, I had chicken bun with a springroll. I prefer it when the chicken has been done in lemongrass with a bit of curry flavour (like Pho Hung), and this was not so I found it a wee bit bland. Having said that, it was well cooked and there was no gristle or fat. The serving size was decent and there was a good amount of veggies. So for the $6.50 pricetag, I think it was on point. We were served quickly and our server made a point of explaining the ingredients such as the springroll which contained pork. On the downside, this place isn't licensed, so you ain't getting an alcoholic drank with your meal. Still, I will come back here and try some other stuff on the menu."}
{"text":"Delicious! I had #79 and it was cooked perfectly.  Husband had the pho beef and he really liked it too"}
{"text":"We had the rare beef pho, classic. The broth is extremely good, I've never had such light yet flavourful broth! The rice noodles are cooked well and the beef is fresh and delicious. Us two had two large bowls of it because it tasted so good. We also had the mango salad and summer rolls. Pretty decent but the star of the show was definitely the pho. I'm sure this is the best pho I've ever had, and I have tried a lot of pho places in the GTA."}
{"text":"The cafe sua da was very good and brought me back to my memories of Vietnam. The Pho was very flavourful,  good firm rice noodles, and the rare beef was sliced thin and very lean. The spring rolls were very crispy and fresh. Pricing is also good. Would definitely head back when I am in the mood for Pho."}
{"text":"Probably the best bun bo hue I've had in Toronto. Run by a family, places like this are the reason why I love Toronto. Make sure to get the spring roll as well. It's filled with taro and meat and it's amazing."}
{"text":"What i liked in my Pho Tai Nam was the beef brisket.  Its presented like a chunk but was in fact so tender and good that i wished they put much more in it.  Otherwise, forget about the fried spring rolls and the broth was nothing exceptional... The owner was nice, the son or younger employee was much less so.    Would i go back?  Likely no..."}
{"text":"We walked in and was greeted by a middle aged man, whom I think is the owner. He asked us where we want to sit, and quickly came with his wet cloth and wiped down the entire table, and again with a dry paper towel. You can tell that he takes pride in his shop.  We ordered their pork summer rolls, special pho, grilled pork bun with spring rolls and a lime juice.  The summer rolls were wrapped nice and tight, and refreshing for the summer. The special pho I ordered was quite delicious, the broth is very aromatic but a bit too much cloves or some sort of strong spice. My husband had the grilled pork bun and I tried a bit as well, it was really good. I would definitely order that  myself next time we dine in. The lime juice was very refreshing with a nice tanginess and it's carbonated and not sweet.  This is definitely a family run business and I would be back to try out other things on their menu and the price is unbeatable!"}
{"text":"Tried the flank beef pho and the grilled pork and beef vermacelli today  Very quick and friendly service. The restaurant was pretty empty when I got there and though the pho broth was soooo delicious I had one piece of meat that tasted a bit off so that kind of ruined it for me. Not sure if it was a fluke or just me...I'm more than willing to give this place a second try though as these things happen. The vermacelli with grilled meat was so well marinated and juicy even after I reheated it at home, portions we're great and you cannot beat the prices here. Abt $7/meal  This seems like a small family restaurant with heart and and that is in my books definitely worth supporting!!!"}
{"text":"BEST PHO IN TORONTO!! We're here about once a week, sometimes twice. Their noodle soups are the best! Tons of flavour! The pho broth is like nothing I've ever had, they use lots of herbs and spices in the meat broth. It's got a unique star anise flavour to it.  The Bun Bo Hue is the star of the menu, a must try. But if you can't do spice, you might want to stay away. Like a previous reviewer said, if you can handle spice, the medium spicy level is good.  If you're there with a few people and want to try something different, the Banh Xeo is tasty and also fun to eat.  Service is great, prices are very reasonable. But be warned, once you've had Bach Yen, you'll never be satisfied with any other Vietnamese restaurants, especially when it comes to noodle soups."}
{"text":"Delish! We get a variety of dishes all the time but the rare beef pho, mango salad and some tofu noodle dish is usually a staple. The dad and son are a friendly team, the price is right and always leave happy!"}
{"text":"considering the slightly chilly weather today i decided to stop into Bach Yen for a quick Pho (bun bo hue) to warm me up. Was not disappointed. Food came out fast, service was polite and courteous and the soup was very good. I was particularly impressed by the flavor of the broth as well as the noodles, they were really good.   I will return and certainly recommend it."}
{"text":"3.5 Star  I have to agreed Bach Yen is very clean...especially for a family run Vietnamese restaurant down at Gerrard Street.  I can tell the owner took a lot of care in running this business...   Pho with Raw Beef ($5.25) is A-OK. The broth is a little too simple a little bland and not hot enough. However it is still quite decent and the portion is good for a small.  Seen like the kitchen spent time to make sure every bean sprouts is fresh, crisp and clean.. I really have to say it is the best bean sprouts I have in any of the Vietnamese restaurants.  Bach Yen definitely is a good choice if you have cravings for  Vietnamese food if you are in the area... maybe I try a bun next time!"}
{"text":"The owner is nice and cares about your order. My husband is a big fan of his spices! Beef Pho is excellent with a great value!"}
{"text":"This is my third time coming here. The first time, my fiance and I had a very enjoyable meal (we both ordered rare beef pho).  The pho was delicious so we came back again. The second time we came we found a piece of hair in our food which threw the whole meal off.  I came again with my sister and I ordered the pho and she had the chicken pad Thai. I do not recommend the pad Thai. It was excessively spicy and drenched in hot sauce. The chicken was a strange blackish colour (but not burnt, maybe re-heated a few times I don't know). All in all, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese food we've had in Toronto! Rare beef soup was amazing. None of the food was greasy but it was all very tasty."}
{"text":"Hanoian style phö. Clean, fresh and delicious. Strongly recommend this place. I drive from the east side of the city to have phö here.   Service is prompt and attentive. Dining area is clean. Place looks a bit run down but this place is not about image; it's about flavour.  Make it happen folks!"}
{"text":"I was taking my husband for a surprise dinner, not sure what to expect. But the reviews were good and so I decided on this place. I must say it is indeed yummy. The pho was awesome we had dumplings too and they were tasty as well. The best was the price we paid was satisfactory, the food is definitely more worth."}
{"text":"Fantastic customer service. Super attentive to my partner's dietary restrictions, even ripped her leftovers off with more broth! My food was delicious, pho was wonderfully seasoned and salted, and the portions inside the broth were generous.   The spring rolls were crispy and hot but not greasy, and it was a lovely relaxing dinner. Definitely our new go to pho place."}
{"text":"Came in here with some expectation - because of yelp. Ordered bowls of pho soup, one for me and one for my boyfriend, and he's fine with it, although he commented about the flavor is stronger than other places he tried with me before. ....Well, the broth is not my taste, as of the licorice and anise flavor is WAY TOO strong for me. Maybe it's other people's favorite, but definitely not mine. 2 stars for the family business."}
{"text":"Family owned hidden gem in riverdale area. No MSG!!  The place is clean !! This place has Vietnamese and thai food! Service is genuine and food is made with heart and passion!   Favourite food is #19 beef noodle soup,#1 vegetarian spring roll, and Spicy Satay Beef with egg noodle! My niece says the Creme de Carmel is the best in the city!!"}
{"text":"Have been here many times. Best pho in town. Other dishes were great too. Service was excellent and caring. Highly recommend a visit."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Viet Pho place in Toronto.   The soup is amazing and all their dishes have something different compared to other pho places. I like the Bun pho a lot that comes with spring roll and it was $7 in a very big sized bowl. They added mint to the bowl which new considering other places don't serve it like that. The spring rolls had Taro and Pork which was a nice touch. The Taro added amazing depth and flavour.   I have been here many times but the most interesting thing is that the owner recognizes me and caters to my needs. I usually go there with my girlfriend and she loves taking the straw of my Coke and drinking it from the glass. What the owner did the next time we visited was gave us two straws in the glass. Honesty, this is the best customer service I have seen. If I'm not won over by their food, it was definitely their service."}
{"text":"I straight up love love love Pho.    So decided to head east to try out Bach Yen, cause let's be honest you can never have too many good Pho places on your list.  Got here around 7ish on a sunday with my gf and my sis.  We all basically ordered the rare beef pho.  The owners are super nice and they really make you feel like family.  They don't take anything for granted and probably the best service I've had at a pho place, period.  The pho came hot and fresh, but I guess this is where the negative comes in... the broth was a little different than what I'm use to.  Not that it's bad, I guess it's just preference.  I kinda like the broth at Golden Turtle and my gf, likes the broth at Pho Tien Thanh.  I feel like the broth is a little more veggy based than the others we've tried.  The beef and noodles were alright, nothing special there for us.  So overall, I would give them 3.  The broth wasn't for me, but the owners/family that runs it is where they really shine.  They really take care of you, so it pains me a little not being able to give them a higher rating.  But I would say give them a try.  Maybe the broth works for you, and trying/rewarding people who care is something we as foodies should do."}
{"text":"Favourite place in the city for Pho. I've eaten in the restaurant, but generally get take out and it's become a regular spot for me!"}
{"text":"Darn good food but it does not compare to Pho house not even close but it is good. The service is good they try hard it's just they don't have the expertise to make something so simple"}
{"text":"Hands down, the most authentic pho I've had in Toronto. Right after coming back from a trip in Vietnam, I was dying to have pho again keeping in mind if been literally to every oho restaurant in the city.   This pho doesn't taste like your chain pho places, it's got real deep star anise flavours which is typical of central Vietnam pho.   Also the prices are amazing, and the owner had been doing it for over 20 years!  Any true pho fan needs to come here."}
