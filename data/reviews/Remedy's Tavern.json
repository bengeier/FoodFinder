{"text":"Well went in tonight, after a run to airport. And waited for 25 minutes. Placed a drink order waited another 10 and left. Drink order was never place.
Place wasn't busy . Been here a few times before never had an issue like this. Distill is much better.
Even though it's further away. Not sure I would come back."}
{"text":"Tasty food and good service! Friday night dinner specials are a nice addition to their dinner menu. Dark bar/restaurant atmosphere, great when you want a quick dinner, close to home with decent prices. Sign up for a free Remedy's Red card for future discounts :)"}
{"text":"I think they make one of the best burgers in Vegas. Great, relaxing atmosphere although perhaps a little too dark.

My only problem is that after signing up and giving them my e-mail so I could receive promotions, I have never received anything! Not one. 

I think bar owners need to realize that we have so many choices. There's a bar on every corner in this town. Give me a reason to choose your bar over another. After that give me a reason to keep coming back!"}
{"text":"So good! The waitress that we are lucky enough to have gotten consistently is awesome and the food is great!"}
{"text":"A great place to bring friends and family to have a smooth vibe ! I go once every couple days and this visit has been my 4th time I promised my self to leave a review"}
{"text":"Remedy's is a very friendly  bar / restaurant. My first time there the bartenders made sure to introduce themselves and make me feel comfortable. The food is great, the machines are fair and the atmosphere is friendly . Most importantly the smoke I rarely notice."}
{"text":"We will nvr come here again, it's a bar that has jukebox and when u pick out music that they don't want to hear they will skip it. Go to Half Shell on Horizon!! Oh and I had to put 1 star on here cuz yelp won't let me post a review without at least 1 stupid star."}
{"text":"Great local gaming bar. Plenty of seating and pool tables if the machines take your money though. Just hit 4 Aces with the kicker a few nights ago and always get great service from Stevo. 

Separate restaurant for non smokers and a digital juke box makes Remedy's one of my favorite spots. Actually partied here on Christmas and they made a great ham with all the fixings."}
{"text":"This place has the best food!  I've tried several dishes like the Cure burger the jalapeno jelly took it over the top also the chicken fried steak breakfast delish! Great atmosphere and the employees are very nice and professional and accommodating"}
{"text":"Went here for happy hr with a friend. This place seems super dark when you first walk in. The menu was a little limited, but we had the fried artichokes, chicken wraps, and salsa with a few beers and enjoyed all of it. The crowd is a little older (40-60) but the atmosphere was still lively."}
{"text":"Bad service. Small portion on my eggs, toast was burnt. When you butter the toast you see you're serving burnt toast. I had hoped for a good experience. My wife's slider was good but it shows how bad service makes or breaks an experience"}
{"text":"Remedys is great place. The food is excellent, and the service is too. I go there all the time to eat in the family friendly dinning room, or just to hang out at the bar with friends. It really is a great local tavern."}
{"text":"Just had dinner there with my wife.   I got the New York steak.  It was nicely seasoned an cooked a perfect medium rare.  The menu sates it is usda choice and by the tenderness I am sure it was.  My wife had chicken parmesian.  Both come with salads and portions are generous.  Bill including two beers was $37.00.  We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This Place Is Awesome! !! Great food awesome staff..Steve is the best...I recommend it to everyone add a great local hangout!!!"}
{"text":"We've never eaten or hung out here but we have stopped a few times to use the bathroom and it's always been very clean and the seat covers have always been in full stock prior to us arriving.  PennyLane likes to tear them out of their holder and rip them up so we are thankful that they're stocked.  The hot and cold water works at the sinks and they have the option to blow dry or paper towel dry your hands after washing.  The stalls are pretty private and it doesn't have a typical bar bathroom smell when entering. The toilet paper is not charmin but it's not that awful single ply either.  We give it a 4 star review because they're tampon machine isn't always stocked in fact it looks as though a crack head broke into it and robbed the quarters so it's no longer in use and for that we knocked down a star but all in all it's not a bad place to relieve yourself while your dog rips through their seat covers."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Ordered food, came in bar to pick it up, gave bartender my name, waited 15 mins for her to socialize with other customers, while
My food sat on the counter.. I believe her name was Jess. Not a great way to get me back here for lunch orders! Definitely better service at your wagon wheel/95 remedys"}
{"text":"Always a fan of the \"food\" at Remedy's but the service is always mediocre if not horrible. Waitresses are usually never around and only are available to take your order and bring your food, and if your lucky bring you your check at their convenience.  Until tonight, had a pleasant dinning experience with Corinne who actually had a personality and chatted with my wife and I.  Corinne  took the time to talk to us and set up my RedCard for us as well. Very refreshing to meet her and will be returning \"ONLY\" because of our experience tonight with Corinne."}
{"text":"Don't bother putting money in the jukebox the bartender will eject every song he don't like!  So we just got up and left! We went to eat dinner somewhere else! Very rude guy unless you're throwing money at him!"}
{"text":"I love this bar but the service is terrible. The cocktail servers are slow and forgetful. And the blonde bartender that works Sunday nights is, I don't know how to describe her. Uses cuss words worse then a trucker. Eats off customers plates and forgets about her other customers that hv nothing to eat with. Don't get me wrong, I cuss but not so vulgar. I eat, but not in front of my customers. :) again I do love this bar, I feel there jus needs to be a change In service 
ps i can bartend and my roomie can serve ;)"}
{"text":"Marie, Mina, and ALLLL the bartenders here are BY FAR the most wonderful people . There is ALWAYS nothing but good vibes and good times here at this bar, and I'm safe to say that this place is home . I am always taken care of and i appreciate this place to the highest degree ."}
{"text":"I just love Remedies for the past 10 or more yrs I have been going here! awesome service and friendly staff. Steve O is always so welcoming!"}
{"text":"This is a very comfortable Tavern. Good mix of beers, and there is no short pouring here! Staff -led by Steve O (who is one of the genuine people around, in a town where there are very few) , they are really efficient. Friendly, checking with you just enough. 

Food - They take it seriously here. This is NOT a bar that serves food. Food is elevated here, done the right way. It won't sit under a light for 8-10 minutes (Black Mountain Grill!) and come to you lukewarm. Then when you are served you get the \"need anything else\" check right away, not well after. Served hot, with what you need. That's all I ask.

Now, on Friday nights what it is very busy, as noted by others, it is smoky. I'm not a smoker, so it can be an issue. But it has never bothered me to the point where I say Nah, lets go somewhere else.

Had breakfast here over the weekend, and it was as much on point as the dinners I've had here! Good work, Steve O! Your attention to detail has made this a winner, and your staff gets a big thumbs up as well!"}
{"text":"Meh. Kind of a dark dingy place. Mediocre beer selection, mediocre service, and we even had food that was still cold in the middle because it was cooked from frozen (the bartender was very apologetic and didn't charge us). The clientele is your bar fly regulars so we felt kind of out of place, and one woman even gave us attitude when she arrived and found we were sitting at \"her machine\". It's clean enough with a decent atmosphere but definitely don't go out of your way."}
{"text":"Great spot. Friendly wait staff and very attentive! Food was killer as well! Liked that they have a separate area for non-smokers to eat."}
{"text":"The food is consistently excellent. We've eaten most of the items on the menu and the food is prepared very well. The staff is very friendly and helpful. This has become one of our favorite places."}
{"text":"I'm little on the fence with this place. It has an awesome lounge and is pretty much like a PTs. (I like PTS more) This place seems a little upscale but no worry's you will fit in!! I did!! 

We started our night here, and had two servers! What more can you ask for with service?!?! but wait maybe I jumped a little to fast because one of the servers was in training and a kid you not she split one of our beers as she was placing it on the table and then looked at us and blamed us. I couldn't believe it.  The other server was pretty cool thought she made a few good jokes about it and cleaned it up and really made us feel at home.

The food was great, the drinks were cheap the service has its ups and downs. This is a cool place to check out but I would rather go to PTs and shoot some darts and play some pool!"}
{"text":"Okay, so it's not sometime around midnight on a Saturday night, and you're not somewhere on the strip, and you're not a tourist here to party like a rockstar....where to?

This is a great place to kickback and really enjoy a few drinks in a solid local bar.  They have a decent beer selection and full bar.  Prices are reasonable.  I normally get apps (the chipotle chicken nachos are good), so I can't speak to the rest of the food, but I did spy a look at some passing burgers and they did look good!  

The place is split between a smoking bar and non-smoking seating area, a smart setup which I really like.  There are some plush chairs setup in one corner which you should definitely grab if you see 'em available.  There are tv's everywhere, as well as pool tables and video gaming.  Oh, and they got this dim-lighting theme going on.  

Finally, the servers were cool."}
{"text":"Chicken fingers are fire. 10/10 recommend this place. And Rafi is amazing and so nice."}
{"text":"I love this place. Food is great (as far as bar food goes) and so is the atmosphere. The service staff is really nice and they all seem happy to be there. Marissa and Jassie are usually there when I'm in and they always provide excellent service and make everyone feel welcome. The red card, their rewards program, is nice as well. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Cool place to a have a couple drinks, nice leather lounge chairs and three pool tables... having fun!!! Great service and great food!! Coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Went to Remedys with a group of my friends. The dodgers and astros were playing game 2 of the World Series. Remedys by far is one of my favorite local bars. It never disappoints. The waitress that we had I believe her name was Alexa. She was kind, very professional and may I say easy on the eyes. 
What was nice about the service is that we never had to ask for her attention. She payed attention to detail. The food came out in a timely manner as well as the drinks. My overall experience here was amazing. Just the atmosphere alone is worth the stop. Plenty of TVs if you want to watch a game. Pool tables in the back. If your ever in the area come check it out. You will not regret it."}
{"text":"Stopped it with a friend to see what the hype is about.....welp. Horrible service, garbage food and dirty silverware. I opened up my fork and knife to a huge piece of dried food on it, to which my server said sorry..... Tried the burnt ends and wow how dissapointed I was. Not burnt and fatty with a super sweet BBQ sauce definitely not something I would try again. Waited oh 20 minutes til another server walked by and noticed my facial expressions to be less than happy to which she tried to \"remedy\" the situation but sorry nothing can fix the experience this far. What a let down."}
{"text":"We thought this was going to be a great local spot considering the reviews. The service is really good, even when they are busy. My first visit was very good (ordered the avocado egg rolls). The next visit we called it an off day. Unfortunately today we ordered to-go food and it was so bad and burnt I could not possibly go back (the avocado egg rolls were still very good). The place is packed so they must be doing something right, but my food (braised ribs salad, and burger sliders - even though I order the full burger and not sliders) was so badly burnt, I could only manage to eat 1/2 of it before throwing it away. Yes I could have gone back, but waste another 45 minutes for possibly the same bad food was not worth it. I hope my experience it not the norm for other customers. Very sad as this had so much potential for me."}
{"text":"While I am a fan of Remedy's, I live close and they have good food and for the most part good service.  Kyle in the restaurant is great, very friendly, and very attentive.  However Zach in the bar is so arrogant and cocky that I will not be eating at the bar anytime soon if he is there.  Then come to find out he is the manager!  I am not a fan of anyone driving drunk and the other day when I was in there, I actually went to see if the cops were still eating in the restaurant because Zach totally over served one customer and then let him leave. By the time I went to get the license plate number he was already driving out of the parking lot.  Cannot believe he got to his car that quick because he was staggering so badly.  If you are an attractive lady Zach seems to be very friendly, if you are a guy then Zach is too busy trying to look cool to give good service!  I will continue to go to Remedy's because of the convenience, the food, and the restaurant staff.  If I want to go to the bar, I will drive to the one on St Rose."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for awhile now but won't be coming back until they fix some of their staff. Back in April I had one server a few times who just doesn't get it! I had slow service and wrong food orders. I guess she was new. I had a few friends who had her recently and experienced the same issues. The only good things for Remedy's is that there's decent food and location."}
{"text":"I love this place! Remedys on St. Rose is my go to place for a great time with or without friends. Great drinks and food are only upstaged by the great staff especially Trista. She is always attentive and a pleasure to interact with. She is very personal and we always enjoy outstanding service when we are here with her as our waitress. When you come here ask for Trista as she is the best!"}
{"text":"Great prices and really good sliders.  It would be excellent if the bartenders weren't usually in their own personal conversations, has happened several visits to Remedys but we really enjoy the happy hour and food. Good place :)"}
{"text":"I am a sucker for a book's cover. It looked so cute from the outside. All polished red brick and shiny stone floor. 

The menu looked yummy---I should have ate the menu. The service was bad and rude. Food, cold, bland and not what we ordered. 

To top off a perfectly bad meal---there was a photographer taking our picture. I asked who he was but could not get an answer. Not sure if he was a private eye, paparazzo, or just a freak. 

My suggestion to you is NEVER go there."}
{"text":"Great service. Definately a local feel. Ask for \"Steve\". It is the \"Cheers\" of the Las Vegas and Henderson area."}
{"text":"I can't honestly saw enough about how amazing Tambra is! That girl seriously rocks,  I swear everytime we go in there to eat she is always working her butt off. Tambra is always  so friendly and comforting with everyone. I actully thought she was mangement due to the professional yet friendly way she handles not only the customers,  but the other servers, and food runners as well. The food is great too one of my favorite's!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent bar, with a few pool tables. Their best feature was the multiple coffee tables surrounded by 4 tall backed leather chairs. Very comfortable for a small to medium group to hang out and have a few drinks.

Service was good, and prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"Food was excellent and the service outstanding . We had the dirty martini rib eye and the IPA shrimp fast service and a gormet taste"}
{"text":"The Cure burger is really good! The jalapeno jelly and the fried parsnips are a unique touch. This burger is really unique for bar food; will be having again."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place been going there for a few years now food's great bartenders are great"}
{"text":"I went in today for half price and the bar tender Chiara and the servers Lindsay Santana and mandi were amazing!! Great food and great service I well defiantly be back"}
{"text":"This place could be pretty cool, but every time I come here the music makes me want to rip my ears off with my bare hands and stick a rusty screwdriver into my ear canal, permanently rendering my sense of hearing useless. This may appear at first a grand exaggeration, but please allow me to elaborate. At this moment, yes, I'm typing this review within remedys' formerly friendly confines, but I assure you this is not a rushed or irrational review. In this moment I'm listening to the song \"Barbie Girl\" for the second time within fifteen minutes. Surely this man is overreacting you may think. Perhaps it has been one singular evening of poorly selected songs on the jukebox. Taste in music is subjective you may gather. But I assure you, fellow yelpers and citizens of Las Vegas/Henderson borders in search of a first rate local bar, you must continue the search. At remedys you will be regularly treated to top 40 music and the forgotten top 40's of yesteryear. Am I a snob for not wanting to hear Katy Perry's enlightening composition titled \"Firework\" whilst at a dive bar trying to forget about the burdens of everyday life with my friends? I think not. Try for yourself. Be delighted with the sounds of Meghan Trainor and Ed Sheeran as you toss back a few pints. You might love it. For me, I shall never return. Goodbye and so long, Remedys."}
{"text":"I am a regular at this place- when they first opened, it was fabulous. Now, every time I order takeout, my order is either completely wrong or over/undercooked. It seems that the cooks no longer care about what comes out of the kitchen. Also, they host great theme parties but always have the same horrible band for every single party. I have heard that the lead singer is the lead bartender's husband, so that's probably why they haven't been fired. I have also seen on of the managers exiting the restroom without washing their hands. EWWW. This place is going down and fast."}
{"text":"Bad service, bad food. Excuses from the manager, didn't offer to replace, just an o'well attitude from the manager. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"I was down in Henderson to meet up with some girlfriends and she suggested remedy's.  it was a little smokey and I don't like places with video poker but otherwise the place was nice.  Kind of a neighborhood local feel to it,  food was really good and so were the cocktails."}
{"text":"Nice bartender. He was apologetic for the slow food service and wound up comping one of our burgers since I let him now how displeased I was with the preparation of my food.
 
I've been to remedy's before and I remember the food being mediocre. Since it was late, and it's one of the local bars near home I decided to give it another shot. 
MISTAKE. My experience was worse than before. My boyfriend and I ordered burgers (medium and medium well) that took 40 MINUTES to come out, and they were both BURNT... like literally CHARRED. I should have taken a pic. I was so hungry and I still couldn't even finish. One of the worst meals I've had, and I eat out A LOT."}
{"text":"Okay, so!!!, my favorite has always been ralphieeee! ¡ no questions asked.  This place is full of great people and happy times so If your from out of town come on over we are happy to see you.  And for the locals ya'll are douches ;p, much love ellie"}
{"text":"The only reading the place doesn't get 5 stars is because of the inside smoking.  Great drinks, appetizers and amazing service from Steve O. 

But the smoke is real!!!"}
{"text":"I like Remedy's, but don't love it. The pros:
* Surprisingly great food.
* Nearby ;)
* Comfortable seating

The only real con is that the service, although friendly, can be slow at times, and sometimes forgetful. Several times I have ordered a drink and waited and waited and finally had to go hunt the waitress down only to discover that she forgot my order. And the place is not that busy!"}
{"text":"For the most part you can get great service, but sometimes they just bypass you. That comes with most bars I have been too.  The food is great especially for bar food!"}
{"text":"The sliders are the best and the bartenders are usually super nice too ;) Don't forget the sweet potato fries too they are the super freaking yummy. A little tight on parking when super busy but they have more behind the building. Love having lunch dates with the honey when kids are in school. Bloody Mary's are yum!!!"}
{"text":"The best service in town! Came here a year ago on a whim, was staying at the Hampton Inn (very reasonable priced hotel $70 night) walked across the parking lot, ate dinner, gamed, drank, and walked out $20 later with no bar tab, SteveO made it awsome, Jackie, and Malerrie were awesome at Customer Service, 5 stars if only Yelp would let me! Been coming back ever since and they know me by name! That's the kinda shit I like! see you again and again!!!!"}
{"text":"Calamari straws are top notch! The mango chutney has slight notes of curry/ cumin. I've had the braised short ribs- delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Very nice locals' bar.  Sit at the bar to play the machines or one of the lounging areas to relax and visit with friends.  Hop over to the restaurant side for the best nachos in the city.  My favorite lunch item is the grilled cheese sandwich and the chicken tortilla soup on the days they have it.  For dinner I like the grilled salmon.  And don't forget to try the bread pudding.  We go to both locations on Boulder and St. Rose, but are a little partial to the one on St. Rose."}
{"text":"OMG! This place has the friendliest service!!!!
Our waitresses.... Melissa and Jesse were  extremely friendly and very accomodating and fast! They informed us of everything local to do and very positive attitudes.
Our food was awesome and hot!
This place is a must go to!!
We will definitely come back again when we are here in Vegas.
Definitely a thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"Went in for some lunch and drinks for the first time and I have to say the waitress made our experience great Tara was an outstanding waitress very friendly and knowledgeable she truly made our experience there great, we will be back ."}
{"text":"The guy bartender on the grave yard shift is awful when I say that I am being nice we are sitting here for half hour without  acknowledging  us if we need a drink goes around and serves everyone else we were invisible . So disgusted. Don't come during graveyard shift. Marissa during the day is excellent."}
{"text":"My husband and I will always choose remedys when in need of a nice relaxed night at a bar. They have the best bar food of any bar I've gone to. It's all very reasonably priced as well. I've never had a disappointing menu item. I highly recommend the street tacos, pickle straws, or avocado rolls. Always a very friendly staff and Stevo always goes out of his way to make sure everyone is having a good time. It can get pretty crowded on the weekends but they manage the rush really well and always make sure you're taken care of, regardless of how busy they are."}
{"text":"We had an amazing experience because of Tajsha! She was very friendly and knowledgeable. The food was above bar quality, will come back again."}
{"text":"Been coming here for three years. Remedys has a great atmosphere and excellent food. The bartenders are the best! No better place in henderson."}
{"text":"Wasn't expecting much from this place but was surprised immediately. Ordered the wings for an appetizer.  They were cooked perfectly,  great flavor,  not as hot as i like but I'm a pepper belly so...

For my meal I ordered the braised short ribs! I was blown away with the presentation as well as the flavors.  The crispy parsnips on top were just an added touch that accented the fried mashed potatoes and the most tender shirt ribs. Delicious. Will stop here everyone on the way from the airport. 

My buddy had the jalapeno burger. He liked it a lot.  He's not as wordy as me"}
{"text":"Ive always enjoyed myself at Remedys. Copious amounts of seating and two pool tables with decent cues. I had one bad experience with a young bartender there but I think he has since left the place. Menu recently received a facelift and offers plenty of good selections. Recommended for those in the area, I wouldn't suggest driving across town for it though."}
{"text":"Sadly, this was our third try at Remedy's on St. Rose. Bartenders are almost courteous, if you are a regular. Not so if you are an infrequent customer. When approaching the bar manager (I won't call him by name) about it again, he was dismissive and walked away from me before I had finished my thought. Regulars can occupy a seat and not play the machine, while others are asked to move to please the insiders. It has been like this for several years now. I would expect that it affects new revenue streams. Too bad the folks that own more of RED don't read these ratings. Adios, Remedys!"}
{"text":"This place was cool. We got here late night and played some pool. Ordered some food that was above par for bar food. Bartenders were cute and friendly. Weird thing was that even though it wasn't very busy there were no less than 3 hookers at the bar. This doesn't really bug me as I'm pro sex worker,  but it definitely reminded me that yes, indeed I was in Vegas."}
{"text":"When you walk in you get a choice on what side you want-smoking/casino side or non-smoking/restaurant side-but both side has food and that's all that is important. I ordered a veggie burger on a lettuce wrap with fries and my friend had ribs and salad. My sandwich was just perfect and my friend told me that her ribs were very tender. There's also a wonderful happy hour, which we didn't partake but still great options if you want a light snack and a cool beverage."}
{"text":"Went here withco workers was soo worth it love the new yourk steak sandwich sooooo damn good makes my mouth water thing of it good people great food good prices on Tuesday during lunch also"}
{"text":"I got the Texas sliders with sweet potato sides and they were really good! I assume my friends like their food too when almost all of them ate all of it. But service was not that great. We had to wait for 15 mins to get service, maybe because it was at 12 am but the bar on the other side was busy. So no excuses."}
{"text":"Love this place. Been eating here for five years at least  three times a week! Every single thing on the menu  is delicious,  and daily specials as well. Kyle and Elaina are my favorite  servers.  They have a few new servers as well that are awesome.  Their rewards  program is well  worth signing up for! ! Keep  up the good work. .p.s.. put the Mahi w risotto  on the menu;)"}
{"text":"Best bar food in the Henderson area! All the food is delicious: mozzarella sticks, mashed potato bites, pretzel bites, meatballs, sliders, French dip, nachos, wings, club sandwich, Remedy's chicken sandwich, burgers, steak and eggs... everything we've tried has been delicious :-)

Emily and Janna are excellent servers...hang out in the high back chairs over by the tvs to catch them"}
{"text":"I don't drink, but I really like the food here.  Some of my favorites are the Jalapeno Popper Burger,  The Cure burger, and Beef Tenderloin Tips. Lots of meat, good flavor, and juicy. The staff are always friendly and on top of everything, and I like the style of the inside with lots of bricks, wood, fire places, TV's, etc."}
{"text":"Love the jukebox that can be regulated by the phone app, pool tables, fireplace, couch seating, booths against the wall & football season there.  The bartenders have always been nice to me & remember what I like to drink, especially Chad.  I do not visit this place as often as I once did cause there were some creepy men always talking to me & I got a lil creeped out.  However, it is a safe place & they were harmless, just annoying, regulars & creepy.

The bar has video poker type games & you usually do meet a lot of locals there, which is like any other locals bar, could be a good or a bad thing.  I've shared a few menu items in the past here, but haven't been back since a year ago so won't comment on that until I try something more recent.

Excellent location & for those staying in the hotel across from the well lite parking lot, I'm sure it's conveniently nice for them as well as locals.

They have an enclosed area for non-smokers, but it's a dining area, no bar just a waitress.  It's also where the bathrooms are, which are usually clean.  The bar can get pretty smoky so I usually sit by a non smoker.  I don't like all of my clothes smelling like it.  Overall, it's a cool locals bar."}
{"text":"Make no mistake about this, this is a BAR. It's not a Bar & Grill or a Bar Restuarant. Yes, there is a sparse menu of very bar-y food (warmed up potato skins anyone?) but is a bar.

That said, it succeeds as a very clean, friendly bar to hang out at. There are a good number of TVs (all HD) and plenty of nice seating. If you have ever been to a Timbers in the Vegas area, it is very similar (though not as large). 

One trait I find uniquely frustrating about Vegas local bars is the windows on the outside are fake (there is zero natural light inside) and the lighting provided is painfully low; it feels like closing time ALL the time.

The happy hour is good and the beer is cold - just know what you're getting yourself into...it's BYOF (Bring Your Own Friends)."}
{"text":"Our waitress was wonderful, but she's stuck with a subpar cook . We used to love coming here for the food, but today is our last visit. Unless they get a new chef. The fried mushrooms were cold inside , Fish and chips, which I've had several times , were soggy. The beef tips were barely warm and very tough . Not what we have been used to in the past . So sad"}
{"text":"Pretty nice small restaurant area food was decent burger a little bit overdone but other than that I think everybody else enjoyed I was fairly priced but was expecting the burger to be a little bit more medium rare if I had the time I would have probably send it back but would go back again"}
{"text":"The food was really good here! There specialty cocktails are average we were better off ordering our own cocktail mix, but the waitress BJ was attentive. It has great ambience with large leather chairs, fireplace, and, pool tables."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend came here about two weeks ago for dinner. It was a good experience. The service was quick but did fall short of awesome. The fish tacos are so good!! And the bartender made my Long Island iced tea perfect! My bf had the burger which he loved and a corona which you can't really mess up :)"}
{"text":"Wish I could give this place zero stars worst service known to man the waitress was rude and disrespectful her name is trista if you get her as your server run for the hills the manager is rude and disrespectful as well overall worst experience of my life. I tried my hardest to be respectful all night but the bartender called me a prick for trying to pay my bill. How is this quality service. If this is how this establishment prides itself i won't be stepping foot in here as long as the bartender is still an employee."}
{"text":"A perfect spot for bar food, drinks, pool and great conversation. Unfortunately after a few drinks and my date being overly affectionate I didn't make it that far. In fact, the bartender remarked \"why are you still here, go home\"...I don't need to be told twice. From what I fuzzily recall they are open 24 hours, patrons are laid back and unpretentious, and drinks are stiff."}
{"text":"Impossible to get a drink. We sat at the bar and played 100 each  and had to beg for a drink. I asked for a certain liquor for a shot & he shook his head no from across the bar & never came back to see what we wanted .  So we waited and 20 minutes passed and no drinks. Our check was dropped earlier & he never came back. EVER!!!!!!!!  We decided to go to the ATM to pay our bill so we could just leave. The food was great & bartender that started us out was very good. I've never been to a gaming bar that didn't have a bartender that served drinks. He hung out with 2 girls that were on the other side of the bar &  served them nonstop. SADFACE!!"}
{"text":"We live really close to Remedy's and typically like to call in to-go orders. Sadly, the last few times they took an additional 15 minutes after the order was already to be complete and then once we got home we realized the order was incorrect. We aren't sure if we will return."}
{"text":"As far as Vegas bars go this place gets two thumbs up. There food is excellent they have some good beers on tap including Guinness. The staff is friendly and attentive. They have a DJ on weekends with a good local crowd."}
{"text":"great food.  Service fast.  only downfall is a bit smokey"}
{"text":"Always have a great time here. Steve O is great and is always welcoming. Marissa is awesome and always smiling. Never had anything less than excellent service. Food is by far the best bar food I've had. Everything has always been excellent, if you get fries or mashed potato bites, make sure to ask for the jalapeno ranch and thank me later. Glad we live do close, this is always mine and my wife's go to bar."}
{"text":"We have passed by this place for the past 3 years, I bookmarked it as a place to try, last night with no clue what we wanted for dinner we decided to give this place a try. I really liked the look of the place and didn't feel out of place when we entered and seated ourselves. The server was friendly, but hard to hear due to the music in the bar. So we strained our ears every time she asked us something. The were many choices on the menu, We started with the chicken finger appetizer and my husband ordered a blue moon. We ordered our dinner at the same time he chose the Shrimp poorboy he said it was pretty good but something was missing with the flavor. I ordered the Ruben, my only complaint was all the meat and sauerkraut was in the front middle so i had to deconstruct my sandwich to even everything out. The bill was reasonable for 2 beers an appetizer and 2 dinners so we will be back to try something else on their menu. The thing i disliked the most of this place was that we got our appetizer then 2 mins later maybe less our food came out, no one wants all that together it makes you have to choose which one you want to eat at a lesser than hot temperature. The next time will will wait to order our food until we get our appetizer. The customer service was great and they were very attentive so that is always a plus when deciding where to go back to eat again."}
{"text":"May be a good idea to have more than 2 bartenders during a Knights game??? Could just be me...or not. Everyone around us is pretty irritated too.  Just want a beer when I want it and enjoy the game. Shouldn't have to wait forever. Different bar next time."}
{"text":"Love remedys. We are there every week. Our Cheers bar. Great food, company, and service. Need to get Big Ten Network though."}
{"text":"I wish I lived closer to this bar!
What a treat it is every time I come here! Great service, fun environment, funny staff, and good eats. 
It's hard not to have too much fun at this bar. If ever in the area, I HIGHLY recommend!"}
{"text":"I have boozed it up and I have eaten my share of unhealthy fare here.

When either heading out of town or coming back from this is not a bad place to stop for a breakfast, lunch or dinner.

The bar is comfortable and can get pretty busy.

The restaurant is sealed off from the bar area and provides a smoke free, cozy place to dine. 

The staff has been very polite on all of my visits."}
{"text":"We visit this part of the city often to visit family and stay at the Hampton Inn next door; so we've been to remedy's a few times. Never been disappointed. Like other yelpers have mentioned, the staff are great at what they do and make everyone feel welcome. The service is always on point. There's a good selection of brews and cocktails. The food is very good. Don't think they skimp on you because you're ordering off a happy hour menu. Portions are good and we often order multiple small plates and share. Remedies is a gem in this part of Henderson which already has lots to offer. Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"Remedys is like a bad ex bf you can't stay away from. I used to come here a lot more often but still make it here at least once a month. Service sucks if you sit anywhere but the actual bar. Bar service is usually really good. They have daily happy hour from 4-7 which is honestly why I find myself coming back. The happy hour food menu could use some improvement though. We ordered chicken satay last night and we're very disappointed. It was 6$ for like half a chicken tender split up into four skewers, the presentation was depressing and the chicken was rubbery. Everything else I've ever ordered is always good. They have a reward program too where you get free apps and deserts. The manager or owner is usually there and he is super friendly and makes sure to check on all his customers."}
{"text":"I gotta say today experience at this bar was the worse ever. I was kicked out by the owner after complaining about his bartenders customer service even himself . He is racist n discriminated against me . Everyone that works in customer service knows that the customer is always right. The owner toby or something along those lines cashed me out nnsaid i can leave announced it to everyone at the bar which most where causasian me being Mexican everyone was like yeah. Pretty much bcus they are regulars. Iat firdt i sat out my 20 in the machine n befire i could get my drink owner wanted to serve the regulars sitting next to me first . They told him i was there forst n hadnt been served. I waited 15 before getting second drink which is not bad . But then i waited another 30 min before i can get my 3rd drink.  Aftr the bartender with long black haor and an attitude problem kept ignoring me like if i wasnt there n servng everyone else around me . WHIch whEre not playing machine at all. Finally she served my drink after she heard her complaining to one of her usuals. Then i asled to speak to her manager. The boss came over n i told him how i had been treated n cameras will show my empty wine glass n how many times they passed by me without an offer. He clearly said. \" how about you can cash out and leave poured my drink out in my face n infront of everone as well as press the cash out button. , WHILE SAYING GOODBYE IN THE MOST DISRESPECTFUL WAY  after all the Caucasian usual customers there cheered. He kept insulting me bcus i told him he had bad customer service. Instead of keeping his mouth shut as a good owner he was the opposite n racist. I wasnt asking for nothing free u was playing n they r making money off me.. maybe once he get a letter from my attorney for being mistreated the owner or management can get their staffing people to get their shyt together n learne the true menaing off customer service. Specially the owner. Whoever the owner of remedys franchise i feel sorry yu gave this man a chance. Truly a great bar if it wasnt for the staff. N management.  I will let everyone i know about this horrible experience . You will lose money n you will deal with my attorney for YOUR  DISCRIMINATION N HUMILIATION.  NOt once was i rude n video surveillance will show it . So please owner do yurswlf a favor n dont come up with an excuse when yu get asked for that surveillance footage . RACIST DRISCIMINATING ASSHOLE!!"}
{"text":"I was hesitant checking out this place considering all the not so good reviews. I am very glad we decided to check it out despite what I read. It is within walking distance to our new place. 
You walk in and the atmosphere is dark, there is a bar off to the left and a non smoking seating area back to the right. First thing we notice is it is seat yourself! Love it. It didn't take long for someone to come and ask us what we wanted to drink. A few minutes later, someone else asks us if she can take our drink order. Such service! 
First thing we notice is the soda is properly carbonated. We had a huge issue with this back in California. Soda  was not properly carbonated around LA and we were annoyed. Started out with an order of pretzel bites with nacho cheese, and two types of mustard. Both mustard's were tangy and good. The pretzel bites were nice and soft, warm and full of buttery goodness. 
I ordered the Atlantic Salmon with rice pilaf and asparagus. My husband ordered the country fried chicken sliders with fries. We both chose the house salad. The salad came out and they were massive and so fresh! So far, I don't see why people don't find this place top notch! The portions are all great sizes. All of my meal was so good. The salmon just flaked and was smothered in a delicious butter cream sauce. The asparagus and rice pilaf both had amazing flavor as well. My husband said that the sliders were equally as amazing.
Then, just when you think we would be full after all of this amazing food, we go for it. We just had to try the rice pudding dessert, and we were so glad we did. It was so warm and soft. Covered with little pecans, vanilla ice cream, whipped cream and maple syrup of some sort. Melt in your mouth delectable!
I read that some people complained about the service being slow, but we had absolutely no issues. Me and my husband enjoy going places to eat where we aren't bothered by the wait staff every two minutes. Very happy with everything at this place so far, and it is so close to home, I know we will be back."}
{"text":"The bar and restaurant are separated which is nice for the heavy smokiness of the bar but leaves the breathable area to be a little on the sterile and boring side... A \"haha you're not invited to the party kind of feel,\" but the service is great and for one of our 24/7 spots, there's much more variety and healthier options than the typical bar menu so they are a step above in my book."}
{"text":"They permit smoking in there. You can eat, drink alcohol, and come out reeking of other people's tobacco addictions if you like.  Food is pretty good and the ambiance is relaxing.  They have flat screens up with various sports channels on for those into that sort of thing.

To be fair, they have a non-smoking section, but then you would have to go with people who don't want to smoke."}
{"text":"Good place to eat and have a few beers.  Best Calamari."}
{"text":"Remedy a is my favorite bar because Rafal Brzesut is a very professional bar tender. Ilove this palce."}
{"text":"Definitely not impressed with this venue. Stopped in to watch some preseason football recently & place really doesn't feel welcoming. Each time we had to go to the bar to get drinks instead of a waitress coming to wait on us. When you did go to the bar the bartenders seemed extremely slow & didn't really care that you were standing there waiting (mind you there were not very many other patrons in the bar so it was not busy.) Bartenders seemed more interested in talking to patrons which I can only assume are regulars than actually taking care of business in a timely manner. 

Ordered the Chicken Chipotle Nachos off the appetizer menu & they were just blah. All the toppings were on top & not alternated throughout the layers of the chips. If you took a chip from the top you ended up taking all the topping for the rest of the chips. I don't know what kind of cheese is used but it's like glue & almost impossible to get chips broken apart. Really no flavor to the nachos what-so-ever. I won't be going back to spend my money there."}
{"text":"If you are an AFRICAN AMERICAN UNACCOMPANIED BY A WHITE PERSON; DO NOT COME HERE. My brother and I just left this place and were treated like second-class citizens. First we had to ask, who appeared to be the manager on duty, (multiple times) to get our money out of his faulty pool tables. He preferred to continuously serve other patrons and stand around despite our numerous requests. In addition, we nearly had to beg for a menu after which we NEVER were asked by any of the staff if we wanted something to eat or drink. I began to observe multiple white couples and patrons playing pool around us were asked multiple times if they wanted refills or needed anything. In fact, I asked the waitress if we could get some service and she kept replying that \"someone would be right with us\". Nevertheless, my brother and I finished our hour long pool without any service at all. If their mission was to not make us feel welcome; mission accomplished. You its funny how alot people believe that racism is dead in this country but Remdey's Tavern has reminded me that it is still very much alive and flourishes in that establishment."}
{"text":"This is our favorite local spot that is closest to home, we wouldn't trade the girls or service for anything they are all great! food is usually alsways good, depends on which cook is working."}
{"text":"Slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow ssssslow still slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slowslow slow slow slow slow slowslow slow slow slow bad service"}
{"text":"Hung out with Stevo and Jackie tonight and felt right at home. They made us feel like this has been our spot for 10+ years. Thank you for making us feel amazing on our 90 minute date night. With kids we don't get out much so when we do we look for a gem and we have found it here at remedys! Cheers"}
{"text":"Good staff, nice setting either chairs couches or if you can find a seat at the bar, better to go alone I guess here but good food, average drink prices, very welcome drink, play at etc place also good music, pool tables. Weekends and late evening super crowded here."}
{"text":"This is a great place, we are always well taken care of. It's a family atmosphere for us. Today we are watching some college football, Jassie is taking great care of us!!!! She always has smile on her face!!!! She a pleasure to be around!! Denise will be in soon and she does the same for us!!! Thanks to everyone here at Remedys!!"}
{"text":"Corinne was my server tonight and hooked me up into the rewards program! Thanks Corinne!!!

Good atmosphere here ... pool tables, non smoking sections and decent food choices!!!

Will come back to check it out soon!!"}
{"text":"We had breakfast here on Sunday morning and the service was excellent! Ordered create your own omelets. Food was awesome and toast was made with fresh rye bread. Yum! I will be coming back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Really love the casual and cozy comfort of this bar. They have nice leather couches to hang out in when you're hanging out with friends and is a relaxed, chill tavern to blow off some steam after a long day at the office.  The pool tables are also fun if you're looking for some entertainment. The only personal -ish i have is how smokey the bar side is. Granted they have a non-smoking restaurant side, but who wants to hang out there?  Its smokey. Really smokey. Be prepared to change clothes when you get home if you're a non-smoker."}
{"text":"I usually just call my order in, and pick it up. Tonight, I was reminded on why we no longer sit and eat at Remedy's.

We arrived, and with it being Thursday (football) the place was busy. There was an open booth, but it still had the previous customer's plates and glasses. 

I stand by the booth, waiting to be acknowledged, or at least for someone to clear the table.... ( sign says 'seat yourself') there were 3 different gals working the section.... After standing for about 10 minutes, the table is cleared. 

We order waters, and our appetizer. We tell the gal that by the time she comes back, we'll be ready to order. She comes back with a coloring sheet for our daughter. On the way to our table, she drops a crayon, and makes a rather loud unhappy sound. 

With the football game on, we begin to give her our food order. While I am telling her how I want my burger, and which sauce I don't want on it.... She looks up at the tv with the game on, and lets out another unhappy noise.... I guess her team wasn't doing so well. 

Our appetizer is delivered, and it just looks thrown on the plate. When you pay $7 or $8 for eggrolls, I guess I expect there to be more than two...but that's just me.

We devour the eggrolls, and wait. Our water supply is gone. We are passed by our waitress about 4 times, she doesn't even give us a glance. Five parties pay, and leave. We still have no water, and the leftover plate in front of us. 

Finally, our food is delivered, and the sauce that I didn't want, came with the burger. The gal who delivered our food wasn't our \"waitress\", and also didn't offer us any water. I'll also add that we only had one roll of silverware ( that was unused from the party before us). So, only one fork, one knife, and one napkin. For two and a half people. (my one year old is the half person.) 

We asked our non waitress to speak to a manager.... And suddenly, our waitress appears. She then started to argue with us about her attitude, her services, and how busy she was.

The manager was understanding, and listened to our complaints. He also got us napkins and cutlery. 

On our way out, one of the gals (who had waited on us before) said that the gal who was helping us is newly pregnant, and forgetful. 

I'm sorry, but being pregnant does not mean that your service can be lack luster....or rude. Because after we spoke with the manager, she transferred her bitchy attitude completely on us. She made it quite clear that she was unhappy with us speaking to a manager. 

We will be just picking up our food from now on..... If at all."}
{"text":"Three words - Jalapeño. Popper. Burger. It's not a meal, it's an experience! One of the best burgers I've ever had - staff at the bar is friendly and attentive too:)"}
{"text":"My husband and I went there last night for date night and we had a horrible experience!!! It took 20 minutes just to have someone come take our drink order, our appetizer of brisket tacos were completely cold and it took another 20 minutes or more for our waitress to come to our table so we could let her know. We didn't see her again until she brought our entree where I informed her I never even got my soup!! 10 minutes later I got my soup and we never saw our server again! I had to go to the bar to order another drink and ask for some water that she never brought us, I asked to speak to a manager and was informed there wasn't even one there! After we were done eating and almost done with our 2nd drink we finally saw our waitress again who tried to apologize but we are in the food service industry also and when you keep walking past a table that already complained once and don't even stop for a second to check on them then you are doing a terrible job!!! We did get our meal comped but I can assure you we won't be back!!!!!"}
{"text":"Good local place. Beer was nice, cold and cheap. Food was mediocre,  decent bar food. Service was nice and fast."}
{"text":"Nine different slider choices...yes! YOu get three meal-sized sliders and choice of fries for $8.99. You can only get the same three in one order, but if you get 6 of them for $14.99 then you can sample six. Philly Cheese and Blue Cheese/Onion sounded great, but the chicken parm. sliders were outstanding. The sauce is the first thing that hits you after taking a bite - it is zesty and then each slider has real mini-chicken parm sandwiches with cheese and large rolls. Best sliders I have found in this variety and then I ordered the Sweet potato fries and those were not so crispy, but sweet potato fries are usually a bit limp. After a slight delay, I received the maple Sour Cream dipping sauce, but despite being good, it needed more of a maple kick. Oh wait, the highlight of this meal was actually the clam chowder only served on Friday. This was crazy good as the New England born bartender had suggested this. The twist - bacon - yes a nice smoky bacon flavor with large potato chunks and clams of course. Bacon was surprising and it was a super large cup of soup.  Overall, everyone was super friendly and its mostly locals or hotel guests from hampton/wingate (short walk). Might be back tonite because after 4 years, this local bar ranks in the top three local bar food places."}
{"text":"Met friends there and pleasantly surprised to learn about this great neighborhood place. Especially glad to see the glass wall partitioning the bar area from the dining room for a smoke-free environment . Had chicken Caesar salad with perfectly cooked fresh chicken. Good service and friendly staff. Three of us ate for under $40."}
{"text":"This joke of a place that likes to call itself a \"local bar\" is a piece of S*** sat at a table for a good ten minutes with not even a head turn from the staff. Then we'd decided the bar for better luck with no avail as well, we as locals love hanging out at a place where we live close by and would be regular customers...this place just lost a handful of new/returning customers."}
{"text":"All I can say is I'm overly impressed at this last visit st Remedy's!!.. perfect local bar with well-kept Pool tables(coin feed), gaming, lounge area, dining area, etc etc... Jeri(sorry I killed your name spelling) managing the bar was beyond superb!!. Mixed drinks for friends on point, Sculpin and Bartender's Choice in perfectly chilled mugs!.. good selection of taps(I'd love to 'tweak' selections just a bit, however).. I didn't get any food this round but my boy managed to destroy  THE CURE burger and fries plate!!.. I drooled in envy, so I'll come hungry next time!!.. THANK YOU, JERI and Remedy's for a perfect night out decompressing with friends!! Great Happy Hour 3-7pm daily and Reverse 3am-7am.. yet if love to see a craft or two on that list (plz).. Will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Bartenders are always nice and always take care of you. They are always on top of their game so you will always have a new drink in front of you or some food. The food is pretty good there and I love how they dress up the place for holidays. From what i've seen they know how to react with drunk people and they handle it professionally not yelling back at you and taking things personally. It tells you a lot about how they handle themselves under those circumstances. I live near so I love that place ! great atmosphere & I see people win in the machines all the time when is it going to be my turn ?! lol"}
{"text":"Fish tacos were a little spicy, but I ate all of them.  the tortillas were not soggy, fish done well but not tough, and the sauce was complimentary to the overall fresh flavors of the tacos.  NY Ruben was done very well, we loved the perfectly done fries too!  the staff was very warm and welcoming.  it was a nice break from our broken a.c apartment done the street.  The pool tables are kept nice as well.  The overall experience was enjoyable and worth our time. Kyle was so nice!"}
{"text":"Great little local bar! Love the atmosphere. Clean and open and not too smokey. Ryan the bartender is cute but a dick, although I guess that's part of his charm. The rest of the bartenders are cool too, though! Great Friday night hangout."}
{"text":"Kim and Christine are always great. Was there on Thurs and the male bartender ignored us for 30 minutes. We asked for the check and called him on ignoring us. He told us to take our business elsewhere if we didn't like the service. Will probably not be going back there again."}
{"text":"Nice inviting place. The food was great. I loved the buffalo cauliflower. My bacon was super crunchy, loved it! My layered mudslide on the other hand seemed blended. Restaurant is sectioned off from the bar, so no smoke from the bar."}
{"text":"First time in this drinking parlor and I liked it very much indeed. On this night Jackie and Ryan were behind the bar, I happened to be with regular clients so it was a good time. Football season has not yet started but I  guess this will be the spot no question. The menu had all the bar fare that you may want and the drinks were flowing. Big shout out to Jackie and Ryan who I hope will be there when I go back for kick off"}
{"text":"Ordered a salad to go.... Left out the dressing. What is a southwest salad without the southwest sauce? I'll tell you, gross, try, and rabbit food."}
{"text":"Bar, high tops or leather chairs. Take your pick! Love having this down the street from me! A pretty diverse menu for whatever you are craving. Only thing that stopped 5 Stars was smoking in the main area."}
{"text":"We love this place not just because it's convenient to our house, but because we've been there enough times to know that it is consistently delicious and consistently great service.  

They have a separate bar and restaurant area and we like to bring the kids here - they have a great kids menu (big sized portions even for our 12 year old). I honestly have not had anything here that I didn't like.  Their BBQ sliders are my favorite. The omelets are delicious.  The portions are always big and the prices are great. 

The service can be a little slow at times (even when it's not busy) but overall, the waitresses are always very friendly and accommodating but not over the top.  We've eaten in both the restaurant and the bar and both are always clean.  There are lots of tv's with all the sports programs which is nice.  I like the Remedy's style décor - a downtown-rustic kind of place where everything seems to go together.  It's comfortable and never overly loud even when it's busy.

There have been a few times we've tried to go in for lunch but couldn't even find a parking spot.  Come to find out, Wednesdays are half priced food from 11-2.  Hmm...tomorrow is Wednesday..."}
{"text":"Small eating area attached to the bar... if your hoping to take a date here plan for them to be mute.  Loud bar type place w bar food. If that's your thing this will be the place for you! If your into sports they have many TVs all tuned in to watch the big events. 
Food was ok... staff was slow and non attentive. I would give a lower score but to be fair I wasn't hoping for a \"sports bar\" and well that's how it seemed to be... makes for a long wasted date night"}
{"text":"Favorite place!  They have awesome food, not just bar food. Huge menu, lots of options.  Definitly the most friendly bartenders, too! And we love Steve O!"}
{"text":"Always a great experience! Staff very friendly and good food! Not only \"bar\" food. Salmon is always great!"}
{"text":"I only write reviews if they're amazing or terrible and after being at this bar at 8-9 on a Saturday night and not being smoked out my cigarettes or dealing with strong attitudes stuck up bartenders I will 100% be coming back!! Owners name is Steve-o and he works in the bar/restaurant so he knows what's going on! He has an excellent personality and is genuinely a nice guy! Food was hot and awesome bar food! Owner even bought us desert! Staff is very nice and courteous and prices are just right! If you're looking for a good local bar I definitely recommend here! Will be coming back!   Very impressed with overall everything at this bar! Trendy and young with pool tables and gambling great hangout place!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to neighborhood bar. The bartenders are friendly, the beer is cold, the food is well above average, and the vibe / atmosphere works. Plus, there are plenty of TVs, pool, and Big Buck Hunter. It basically satisfies all of my typical bar needs."}
{"text":"Bartenders are awesome especially Saturday & Sunday days. The chicken fried steak is good but the Jalepeno popper burger was the bomb. Football specials are awesome here."}
{"text":"Took my team here for team building happy hour.  The bar area is clean and doesn't smell too smoky like most places.  Our server was very attentive and came to
Our table right away.  They have tons of food and drink options on the regular happy hour menu but also have an additional happy hour menu during game time.  We ordered tons of appetizers to share and everything was amazing. Few of our favorites: chicken quesadillas, mashed potato balls, and tot nachos.  We also had two drinks each.  Our bill for 6 people was about $122.00 which is so reasonable.  Overall, great experience and will be back."}
{"text":"Service sucks unless u r seated in the bar area or dining area.. if in the pool area... forget about anyone coming to get your order.. went to place my order at the bar and the lady said that she will let my server know... guess that never happened... I can take my business elsewhere ..."}
{"text":"I feel horrible to give such a bad review, but I was not impressed with this bar at all. Unfortunately my experience has always been quite poor. Considering its location, its never really too busy, unless there is a sporting event on TV. The wait to get a drink is much too long, and I don't mind waiting 5-10 minutes to at least be asked \"What can I get you?\" After waiting for drinks, it was extremely difficult to get the attention of the bartenders, one of which was extremely rude. 

Unfortunately I will never be returning there, at least not until someone can really change my opinion and make me try again, but I have no intention to."}
{"text":"Went into Remedy's tonight for a couple drinks as it was great! Good food and atmosphere, plus our server was great, Corinne. Very Informative and we will be back to see her!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place more than I did. It seemed like a good place to get a craft beer. It was not. Not a single brew I couldn't have snagged in any tgi Fridays. The food wasn't bad, but I would have needed amazing food to offset my beer disappointment"}
{"text":"Clean and friendly. The avocado egg rolls are awesome. It is my kind of neighborhood bar. It is a nice place to go and enjoy so cold beer and great food."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch a few days ago - wife got a wrap and I had the chicken wings, order them hot which a good but got a side of the \"nitro\" sauce which was yummy! We also ordered the pretzel bite with the 2 mustards (sweet and a spicy) and cheese which was hands down one of the best appetizers on the menu.  There service was great, slow at first because it seemed to be busy for Friday at 1pm and the was working by herself :(. The beer was priced reasonably ($6.50 for a 25oz) and from the looks of it the happy hour menu looks awesome with half off food items and drinks. Beware this place is dark on the inside so if you come during the day, your eyes will have to adjust. This place over all was done really nice and the staff was really friendly. They do have an area where you can sit away from the bar that is closed up if you are not a smoker and want a smoke free dining experience (which is really nice). No kids but I know they are allowed in the dining area with an adult over 21.  I am looking forward to going to this place for happy hour!"}
{"text":"Remedy's is a great local bar.  It stays pretty busy til about 2am on weekdays, which is cool.  The bartenders are nice.  They have 3 pool tables."}
{"text":"This place is really nice to chill and enjoy drinks and food. The service is great and the atmosphere is greater than expected."}
{"text":"This is a friendly neighborhood bar.  The service is good and the food is tasty.  I took my sons there to eat and we enjoyed the experience.  One is 21 and the other is younger, so sitting on the dining room side was pleasant.  

I enjoy the appetizers and always a good go to when I want a late night snack. Even a nice place to have breakfast or any other meal.

I will be back and I know my kids will like to join me again."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and great service. Trista is an awesome server. Drinks are fairly priced and food is very good. Locals go to place for sure."}
{"text":"I've eaten here three times now, mostly with good experiences. The first time I tried three appetizers -- they make their own crab cakes and they are really good -- but the shoestring sweet potato fries go cold pretty quick, and the side of maple sour cream (I think it was) was kind of meh.

Second time I had lunch, and I ordered a tuna melt. The strange thing was it came out on a small saucer, and it was stacked kind of willy-nilly. It tasted good, but a rather odd presentation.

Had dinner in the dining room the third time and had a great grilled salmon.

Remedy's is large, dark, and has three areas: the large rectangular bar with the video poker machines; large highbacked leather chairs where you can sit and watch sports TV; and a separate dining room with booths. The staff is quite friendly. Slightly pricey as things go."}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience. Marissa our bartender was nothing but SPECTACULAR! Greeting us right when we walked in and making sure that our service was nothing but exceptional. Being in the industry you want nothing but the best and that's what we received. :) Can't leave Daserie out."}
{"text":"Slow food service, greasy bar food, but the mixed drinks are a savior to avoid the single star. Cheap drinks, bring in a less than respectful crowd at times, muscle and meat crowd. Do not wear clothes you are not ready to discard in the garage and wash as the smoke is heavy, and be ready for a shower or the smell transfers to the sheets. My wife refuses to go in, as her long hair traps all. The guys and I are good on the happy hour, mainly for cost sometimes, but a good look around would contradict the reviews that say it is \"clean\".  Exlir and Distil, owned by same group, are definitely a step up from the original Remedy's. I would say good for a couple post work drinks, not lengthy stays, and places around the same area are much better on food, all drinks, atmosphere and sports watching."}
{"text":"We've eaten here off and on for several years. It's hit or miss with service and food. Decided to go for dinner after work. Looks like the menu has some appealing updates. Ordered the special which was pot roast with mashed potatoes and mushroom gravy. It was really good, melt in my mouth tender!! I would definitely try it again. Hubs had the street tacos. He said they were ok. We ordered the sourdough bread bowl as the appetizer. It was cheesy and hot. I'm not sure how I felt about the spinach dip that's served with it. I personally think it needs a little more flavor, maybe garlic.?
Only 3 stars because  the sourdough bread with cheese and spinach dip took forever because either the server forgot to order it or it was given to another table. It came out, nice and hot,  but a minute later out came our meal which was only luke warm, like it set under the heat lamps waiting for the appetizer to be done. 
Our server was pleasant, bartender makes an awesome mule, and beer was cold."}
{"text":"Remedy's is one of my favorite local bars. The food is exceptional and they stock a wide variety of beers. Like most local joints, the bar top has video poker and the other gaming machines spaced out along it. There's a rather spacious seating area with low, comfortable leather chairs and tables, as well as an area with two pool tables and a Golden Tee game.  It's a great place to meet and visit with friends. 

It doesn't usually get too busy here (Thursdays are sometimes busier than the weekends).  The clientele is generally middle-aged and friendly, and the waitresses and bartenders are very friendly, too.

Drinks can be a bit pricey, but they are no worse than your average Vegas bar. (I paid $8 yesterday for a tall, premium beer.)  On the other hand, the food far surpasses the average bar. A couple of my favorite menu items include the mashed potato bites, pretzel bites (you have to try the honey Dijon sauce that goes with them!), and the chipotle chicken nachos. During happy hour, check out the Greek fries for 4 bucks. You'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Awesome place, wonderful staff. I have only been in here a few time but no matter how many people are there I am served quickly. I have never had the food but the menu is extensive for a restaurant pub. I've noticed that the male to female ratio is typically more favorably female."}
{"text":"Love this place...open 24 hours food is good bar food. The service is pretty good and friendly. I see people on here with minor negative comments concerning the food...it's bar food people, however I have never had an issues worth mentioning and I'm more picky then anyone I know. It pisses the Mrs's off that I'm that picky, I don't care...I'm paying for it."}
{"text":"I only had beers here.  It seemed that this is the place to go if you like to smoke while you drink.  Pool tables. Mixed crowd. No frills place. Reminded me of a strip club with no strippers!  Not sure what other happening bars there are on that side of town."}
{"text":"Neighborhood \"watering holes\" as folks like to call them aren't typically my thing but considering Remedy's is conveniently located within reasonable walking distance from z casa, I take advantage of this venue from time to time.

The bar is the focal point of the establishment (shocking, I know).  Next you have your standard pub tables and cheesy cigar lounge setup surrounding the bar complete with jukebox and pool tables off to the side.

Drinks are average in price and average in potency, served in your typical rocks glass (which in dive bars around town would double as \"shot\" glasses, they're so small).  

Service was stellar (thank you Kristal!) but other than that and the much appreciated minimal distance I have to travel (crawl) home after a night of debauchery, I wouldn't go out of my way to make regular trips to this establishment.

It's your typical local's bar with a fancier motif and premier location on it's side.

Nada special about it, but great spot for a \"remedy\" to a bad day ;)"}
{"text":"First time here.  We really liked it.  Service was good.  Only one other table in the restaurant part, though the bar was pretty full.  Wife had Ahi Tuna salad.  cooked very well.  I had Filet tips.  Done nicely with nice sides, mashed potatoes, asparagus, carrotts.  Overall 4/5, we will be back."}
{"text":"Omg service is so bad! Sat there for the Broncos game and not 1 server approached us to ask if we were hungry or need a drink.  I guess they are making loads of cash and don't need our gratitude.  Too sad for them because I am in the service industry and do have a heavy hand when it comes to tipping. I will visit Dotty's and watch the food network channel before I go back to that joint!"}
{"text":"I dig this place, most of the bartenders are super cool.I like the food, because they have a veggie burger. usually super crowded during prime times- nice henderson spot where you will find the whole neighborhood."}
{"text":"I've come here twice because it was a convenient location to meet up. Service is good, food selection is good, just a little on the pricey side. Great atmosphere though!"}
{"text":"I never sit at the bar and the service is always great. Love the friendly waitresses!  Food is always my go to when I can't figure out where to go.  Love this place.  Other than the smokey smell (to be expected - it is a bar), it's a winner in my book!"}
{"text":"Love this place. I have not one complaint. Food is incredible, there hasn't been one thing on the menu that wasn't good. Service is friendly both restaurant and bar! Definitely try this place if you get a chance! 

Oh and 10 stars go to Titus the chef, he's normally late night shift but he's an all around great guy!"}
{"text":"Great bar! Odd crowd, but great environment!!! Decor is soothing and chill, service is usually on par! This used to be my friend and I's spot! It'll probably always stay cool! Check it out!"}
{"text":"Three is being a little bit generous. We came here for lunch and my hubby had been here before without me and figured he would show me this place. I won't elaborate too much, but the service was terrible. One of those rushed places where as soon as your order is in you might as well say good bye to your server until for comes out and then again until you are late to your next endeavor waiting forever for a check. Food was ok. Nothing exciting for how the menu looked. It's one of those places that touts comfort food with a twist. However not the most exciting execution. Combo that with less than stellar service and incorrect items arriving compared to ordered and I probably won't be back any time soon"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying if I could leave 0 stars I would and this is the last time I am stepping foot inside Remedy. 

A few weeks ago my wife and I stopped in with the intention to get dinner, play the machines and have a few drinks however just as we were about to sit down one of the bartenders stopped us and called over another customer. 

This left us nowhere to sit at the bar, as customers were occupying multiple seats (it is important to leave your drink and cigarettes in front of an empty seat) and there were only two open seats at different parts of the bar. 

No big deal as we ended up st The Bar on St Rose Parkway where we enjoyed a good meal and some adult beverages.  

Remedy's lost our money that night and our business forever."}
{"text":"My husband and I have lived in this area for 7 months now, we always see it when we go to the gas station and it looks busy most nights. We went for the first time last night, there were two bartenders (man and a woman, i forgot their names ) and the service was great! I'm assuming they have a lot of regulars that come in, because the male bartender asked if we were first time customers there and if we were new to the area and took the time to talk to us. 
When it comes to the food, it was really good! We ordered chicken lettuce wraps, the chicken satay, short rib tacos and avocado egg rolls. We definitely see ourselves coming back here"}
{"text":"Great place for late night drinking. Happened to be in the parking lot of the hotel I was confined to for 3 weeks.   Huge shots of Blackhaus, 3 pool tables, and friendly enough staff.  Can't think of a better place to throw back beers @ 4AM while playing Porno Picture hunt.  Did I mention huge shots of Blackhaus?

Food is not bad either."}
{"text":"Disappointing today. Been coming to remedy's for awhile. In between classes as I'm a student. My peers and i met there today to do a review. Literally I had to flag people down to order. And then the waitress wouldn't even acknowledge the rest of my group to take an order. Constantly waiting and having to ask for attention. Just overall not good service and I'm pretty much not happy about it as this is a nice place to go between classes. Maybe hire more help if you can't handle the small amount of patrons in your dining room"}
{"text":"Say what?!?!! Cold beer, cool people and great food. I make it a point to stop in every time I am in town. I do die a little inside every time someone hits a royal and it isn't me though. You must try the Cure Burger... Half pork and half ground beef. Shazaam!"}
{"text":"My husband and I moved from California to Nevada and was fortunate enough (and hungry) to find Remedys. On one of our house hunts we went to the facility on St Rose and by accident and pure luck, we found another on Conestoga off the 515 fwy when we purchased our home. A few months later. We had no idea there was another. 
The prices are so reasonable, I believe we've eaten there more times than at home. Their food is great and you can't beat the hospitality of the crew. If you leave there hungry, it sure isn't their fault. Always looking forward to going there."}
{"text":"Thank you Jackie & Marissa for helping me when i needed a bandaid & some first aide. You guys are so hospitable & kind. And i can tell you guienely care about people. It means a lot to me. All the staff is so friendly and attentive. . Not to mention the food is awesome.. usually go to the remedys on wagoon wheel.. but now I'm a huge fan of both! Thanks again to the amazing staff!"}
{"text":"Bar food is my favorite. Beer is my husbands favorite. Breakfast food is my kids favorite. This place is perfect for date nights when the hubs and I can sneak away for a bit, stay close to home and enjoy some beer and tummy appetizers. It's nice to sit at the bar and feel grown up, or snag the fireside lounge area. This place also has an actual restaurant portion with kid friendly items. Threw a small birthday get together for friends here and the staff was accommodating and patient. Another locals favorite, with a great location."}
{"text":"The salmon here is always perfectly cooked.  I have had the full dinner or the salmon Caesar salad...both great."}
{"text":"Overall a good meal. I have been staying at the hotel in the same parking lot off and on for a couple weeks for work. I finally strolled in for dinner.
I am not a smoker and was told it was smokey inside but there is enough glass partition to keep the smoke at bay, unless you are really sensitive you'll be fine.
Service was friendly and efficient. I ordered the martini ribeye. Save your money. Although it is pretty tasty for the price it is a thin cut of pretty tough meat. Because I have been traveling I had a ribeye at a similar price, out back shall we say, which was a better thicker more tender cut. Otherwise the rest of the menu looked good and more reasonably priced. I had the soup of the day - chicken artichoke which was good, kind of a creamy soup with a good amount of meat and artichoke. The meal came with mashed potatoes and spinach which was very good but I don't get why they have to put the steak on top of the mashed potatoes? 
I think for the cold beer and decent service it is a good spot to try. Next time around I am thinking a burger or maybe the spaghetti with meat balls."}
{"text":"Went in and the place looked good. Took about ten mins to get table service. We ordered door and drinks. The drinks were good but the food was overlooked. The waitress comped our order but our first time was our last Probobly"}
{"text":"Friendly staff? Check!
Great pub-style food? Check!
Video poker/slots? Check!
Pool? Check!
TVs to watch your favorite games? Check!
Beer, wine, and cocktails? Check!
Lounge areas to sit when you don't want to do any of the above? Check!

What more could you ask for in a 24-hour establishment like Remedy's? This has become our \"go to\" neighborhood spot for a meal and to spend $20 on video slots while drinking a free beer."}
{"text":"Love this place. Best bloody marys for the hang over. And great food. Steve o is the man. Always a good time"}
{"text":"This bar is owned by my neighbor Steve and we come in every Thursday night for the wholesome food and friendly service."}
{"text":"Seriously so good! I've decided I need mashed potatoes and gravy in all of my sliders! The waitress is amazing and very quick! I'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service if you like paying pple to be rude to you here is the place last time I ever give this place a try and what a waste of money to spend it on ignorance"}
{"text":"I love this bar!  I was introduced to this bar by a 'regular' when I recently moved to the area.  All of the bartenders are great but I'm particularly fond of Steve-O and Melissa.  The beer is cold, the service is outstanding and the food is good and reasonably priced.  My favorites are the lemon chicken dinner special and the 'fat boy' burger.  Everyone is so friendly (customers and staff) and the atmosphere is great!"}
{"text":"We love this place.. All our friends go there and love it too.. My boyfriend is from El Salvador.. There is no discrimination there at all.. SteveO and all the bartenders are great... Love that they have bands now on the weekends... Food is great.. Come on down and have a drink.. Wont be disappointed...."}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst experiences I've had in a long time. Went out for my stepdads birthday and chose remedys for a nice family breakfast. It was anything but nice. We were one of the two groups in the restaurant and our waitress Tammy took our drink order and then disappeared. She came back as other people entered and brought us our drinks but brought drinks we didn't order and then got frustrated with us that she messed up. She took the orders of Everyone else and didn't bring orange juice for my sister and I until 15 minutes later. The orange juice was nasty like it had spritzer in it. Everyone else in the restaurant was served before us even though we were first to arrive. We again received wrong food orders to which our waitress again became upset with us. The chicken fried steak was more like beef jerky and the omlet was dried out and hard. The attitude of our waitress Tammy, alone left much to be desired. I want to come back and hope this is a fluke because I've heard great things but this was a disappointing birthday experience and a waste of breakfast."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here on a whim last night after finding out that our initial dinner destination was a little too packed for our liking. After arriving, we were happy to take a seat of our choice in the bar area. Our waitress came by happy to assist us by taking our beverages orders and dispersing the menus. The atmosphere was pretty chill even though it was a Friday night at prime time (7PM). As we looked through the menu for our entree item, we decided to get an appetizer of mashed potato bites ($7) based on other Yelp recommendations. It was a great choice and thank you friends! These were so tasty, loaded with cheese and chives. It also came with two different dipping sauce, a chipotle type and ranch.

My husband and I split the slider trio (~$17). We ordered the Texas brisket sliders, country chicken, and buffalo chicken sliders. My husband loved the Texas sliders ,although we both agree that the dish could have been a bit warmer. Mine was close to luke warm. The country chicken was delicious , but my heart truly was stolen by the perfectly seasoned and breaded buffalo chicken slider. I know next time I will be getting the buffalo chicken tenders, which is the same kind used in the sliders. If you truly appreciate buffalo chicken, then I advise you to try them too!

After completing my meal, I went exploring to find the bathrooms, which are to the left of the front door near the additional dining area.  Amidst my travels, I found a few pool tables in a little corner of the bar and also a fireplace surrounded by leather couches. I am a huge fan of getting cozy by a fireplace, so I convinced my husband to finish his beer at the fireplace. The wait staff were okay with us relocating to this area and we had a nice ending to our little dinner date. I'll definitely be back for the fireplace, the mashed potato bites, and the buffalo chicken."}
{"text":"Okay, I go to remedies all the time because I work in the same shopping center. Because we are in the same shopping center they used to give us an employee discount. Now they don't. We don't get any discounts .We get charged full price, after four years of not paying full price which kind of pissed me off. Besides that points the food is actually fresh and tastes great. My main complaint is that they always always mess up my order. For example on the menu the chicken breast dinner comes with Dijon cream sauce, roasted potatoes and asparagus. Yet I always seem to get broccoli and bell peppers for my side instead of asparagus. So when I order I specifically asked for the asparagus not the broccoli. But I still seem to get the broccoli. Doesn't make any sense to me. Also on multiple occasions I haven't even Received my entire order when I order to go. Obviously remedies can improve in many ways. All in all it's not too shabby for bar food."}
{"text":"I've only been here a handful of times but ive always had a great time! The bartenders are so nice, especially the shorter black haired one. Gosh I cannot remember her name but she's so sweet and so thoughtful when it comes to her customers. And she makes a mean Moscow mule. I always order the avocado egg roll when I'm there, it's so damn good. I'm perfectly aware its frozen and fried but it's still tasty! It's like a step up from typical bar food. I also have gotten their Caesar salad and chicken tenders. All very delicious. The decor is so nice, I used to go to PTs a lot and I always hated the decor....its bland. The cushy chairs in the lounge area at remedyd reminds me of where men in the 20s would have their cigar and brandy. 
My favorite place to go for bar nights!"}
{"text":"Always go to this bar, close to my house. Awesome Bartenders. Jackie is amazing & Fun! Machines always hit. Very fun enviornment. You can choose your own music. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Bests wings going in Henderson the bread pudding rocks"}
{"text":"All was a sure bet for good wings and a cold drink, Try there poke stack"}
{"text":"I've only been once, so far, but it won't be my last trip. I greatly enjoyed the appetizers that I tried; I look forward to checking out dinner there."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times so far and I'm going to keep coming back.  I really love the section that has high back lounge chairs.  It's so nice coming here, relaxing and watching the game. The waitresses are great; very friendly and keep checking in to see if you need anything.  

I love happy hours and this place doesn't disappoint. You can't beat the $2 wells at The Bar, but they don't have food on their happy hour menu.  Here is a rundown of Remedy's happy hour:

It's everyday, twice a day; 3-6am & pm

Drink Specials
All Just $3.00
Well Drinks
16oz Domestic Draft
Domestic Bottle

Food Specials
Chips and Salsa $1.99
Bruschetta $2.99
Crispy Battered Artichokes $3.99
Cheeseburger Sliders $4.99
Deep Fried Mushrooms $4.99
Buffalo Chicken Sliders $4.99
Chili Cheese Fries $4.99

The food at Remedy's is great. I've also been here for dinner and their sandwiches were amazing. I really like that you get to choose your side; the sweet potato fries are awesome.

Another bonus is the fact that they have a loyalty program. You get 1 point for every $1 you spend.  You can then use 100 points to get $10 off your meal. What a great deal.  

Last time I was there, the waitress told me they would be doing special promotions during football season.  I can't wait."}
{"text":"Okay most people would write a review for a bar and talk about the drinks, gambling, the gazillion flat screens...  Nope - let's talk about what's really important...

Breakfast!

At least once a week we drop into Remedy's and have breakfast. Typically Saturday. It starts with a spicy Bloody Mary made with Tito's. Then chicken fried steak and eggs. My wife and family have had about everything else on the breakfast menu and it has been great!  Portions are big and prices very reasonable. 

We enjoy the separate smoke free dining area for breakfast. When we visit there for lunch or dinner we will typically sit at the bar. The bartenders are a gas!  We also might donate to the local economy on the poker machines. 

Burgers are great - especially the \"Cure\". Salads are huge. Don't miss out on the avacado egg rolls either. 

Best part is.... 5 minutes from our house."}
{"text":"this place is ok if you want to gamble i went to play pool and drink.  All i have to say is that they need more servers or just servers that know what they are doing."}
{"text":"Awesome place...great freaking food,CUTE Female staff,and very friendly...food worth the price,keep on with your bad selves... I will be going back For Sure!!!"}
{"text":"Remedy's could be special. However, the major problem with Remedy's it's a bar that wants to be considered more than a bar, but isn't.  The service is more of a Pt's/Sierra Gold type service than you would find at your traditional restaurant.  Overall, a good bar w/bar food and some nice TV's."}
{"text":"You should go here if you want a smoky loud bar with a mediocre menu, full of drunken forty something's and skewing heavily toward sausage party.  

I've gone here at least a dozen times because a couple friends like it, but I would rather spend my money elsewhere.  

Also don't put money in the juke box.  The bartenders will skip your music.  Unless it's crap like Linkin park and nickelback."}
{"text":"This trip to Remedy's was for food. We sat in the restaurant area for the first time the waitress was nice and attentive. I have had food here a few times its always ok nothing special. This trip I ordered the salmon with rice pilaf and asparagus. The salmon was better than expected, rice was a little dry most likely made once a day. The trip was as expected not disappointed also not overly impressed. The service was good which sometimes is almost as important as the food."}
{"text":"This place might be what the doctor ordered, if you needed an extra dose of second-hand smoke. 

Look, it's Vegas and you can pretty much smoke and drink anywhere I get it, but some places really need to invest in an air filtration system. Turns out, Remedy's is one of those places. Super smokey, almost overpowering. 

I came here for a mellow night out with a few friends, some pool, and a couple of cocktails. The drinks were stiff and the apps were ok; I ordered the chicken quesadilla, loaded with chicken, lots of cheese, and spicy peppers. This was pretty big for an appetizer and a little above par by bar food standards. 

The drinks, like said were stiff, but pretty standard and reasonably priced. I do have to say that the bartender (totally forgot his name) was awesome and super friendly. At first he looked at me funny, you know one of those,\"I have never seen you here before\" looks. He then introduced himself, shook my hand, and bought me a shot. He then proceeded to do this two more times throughout the night. For this reason alone, Remedy's earned an extra star. 

FOR THE RECORD - I never once stated what I do for a living. This dude was just plain old awesome. If you know this bartenders name, message me, like to give props when props are due. 

Good place to have a few and keep it mellow."}
{"text":"We've been in when the service was absolute crap, and honestly was giving this place its last chance... then, we came in and Corinne totally redeemed Remedy's for me. I'll give this 5 stars because she went over and above for us. We will be back now again because she TOTALLY REDEEMED this place. Thanks!!"}
{"text":"Having a cheese plate & wine after a relaxing massage. They don't even have cheese plates on the menu.....Marissa just accommodates to my needs :) She's amazing!!!! Great wine selection too :)
& they have a JUKEBOX!!! Think I'll play some #311"}
{"text":"1/2 Price Lunch ... menu is 1/2 Price on TUESDAYS from 11am-2pm

Beware when walking in from a sunny day... it's quite dark inside and it takes a few moments for your eyes to adjust.

There is a restaurant (non-smoking) side and a bar (smoking) side.

Started with the soup of the day - Spicy Chicken Tortilla.... really warmed me up with great spicy broth... not much chicken in it though... was mostly onions and peppers.

Then had the fish tacos which were perfect for me.  I didn't want anything heavy or greasy... (I know... why go to a bar then) ... they were grilled white fish tacos and the taco shells were homemade too... so yummy!

Will be going back again for sure."}
{"text":"Great spot and awesome food! The bartenders are cool and friendly, and always seems to be a busy spot. I would recommend checking it out if you get a chance for the good vibes, drinks, and food!"}
{"text":"I come here for the food! Last time that we will probably ever come back. They had one server and she was working both the bar and the restaurant. It took about 10 minutes before being noticed and the bartender's were too busy chatting up the gamblers then to take our drink order. When she brought out our food I thought she was maybe picking up plates and clearing tables. I was stunned when she put the food on our wobbling table. My husband who never complains about food or service was furious. We arrived at 5:15 and didn't even leave until 7:20 spent more time waiting on them than anything and was close to walking out. The food was mostly taken off the bill after I complained but she kept walking away from our table thinking we were still eating when all I wanted for her to do was take the food away. This is not the first time I have been disappointed here but when they gave us crappy food it was the last straw. This place has gone down hill."}
{"text":"Chad and Steve-O are two of the best bartenders I've ever had the pleasure of being served by. If your in the area it would be totally worth while to stop by and get a bite with a beer, I enjoyed the IPA scampi, which was KICK ASS, and it was the chefs FIRST DAY! A definite stop if you want quick service, quality drinks, and amazing food! I hope to stop by soon!"}
{"text":"Their food is not bar food at all its great quality cuisine that you can take dates on. Amazing food, amazing staff, great place near Seven Hills. Jerry is one heartbreaking bartender (Jerry is a girl). Great music. Three pool tables. Oh and did I mention the amazing food."}
{"text":"Went there 2/26/16.  My girl ordered the salmon plate.  She said it was cooked perfectly and was delicious.  I had the fish and chips.  At least 65% batter and of course fish.  I ate one and took the rest to go.  Chips (fries) were underneath and soggy.  The service was impeccable.  I need to attach photo of one of the three fish portions to show fish to batter ratio.  Do not order this plate."}
{"text":"Their food is delicious.  I recommend the steak salad.  This is one of the very few \"bars\" that I can say I really like their food.  More so than chain restaurants such as Applebee's or Chili's.  It is really dark inside, but your eyes will adjust.  The service is okay, sometimes it has taken a while to get them to bring the check, but the food is always on time.  They have pool tables, a fireplace, video poker at the bar and a jukebox.  A cool place to just lounge around and socialize.  I haven't tried the drinks there but I have never heard anyone complain about them.  Definitely worth going to if you're in the area.  A lot of regulars.  The decor is pretty nice, its not divey at all.  I wasn't expecting much when my friend brought me there for the first time, there isn't a lot around and it shares a parking lot with a gas station so I was a bit suspicious, which I shouldn't have been because she always finds the best places."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a few months. Last night we went and had Ryan as a bartender. We bet 5$ and he charged us for all drinks because you have to bet 10$ for free drinks. We paid and thought well that makes sense. Went back again today and had the same bartender. I ordered a special drink and he warned me that you have to gamble 20$ to get a specialty drink free. So I did. Then I order a non specialty drink after. My husband bet 15 and ordered one non specialty drink. Sure enough we get charged my specialty drink and Ryan \"comps\" our non specialty drinks. I ask him about it and he says he charged the lesser value drink and that that's their policy. Out of all the times we've been here we typically always bet 20 each. I don't think we will ever be coming back again. Love Stevo (the owner). Just not worth putting up with Ryan."}
{"text":"Ran off by the cig smoke!  Enjoyed HH. Enjoyed the nachos. Then it got really cig smokey and I could no longer breath."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, took a while to get the food after I called ahead....not bad though. We both had burgers, again nothing special, a little pricey, but tasty."}
{"text":"Worst service ever ordered a whiskey sour and it was disgusting all sour. A friend ordered hers and it was all whiskey when told the waitress, she didn't offer to fix them she told us if we ordered another one she would have the bartender fix it. We asked for a cup to mix it she gave attitude. All that after waiting 15 mins for someone to come wait on us."}
{"text":"I walked into Remedy's and there were two sides.  The family side allows dining for non-smokers and families with children. The bar side is for adults only. I went to the bar side and the first bartender was polite but didn't give me too much detail even though it was my first visit.  I proceeded to order a drink and put $20 in the blackjack video poker machine. The bartender left and the new bartender switched to a female named Michelle who took my order. She told me that the ahi tuna tacos are good and they are actually delicious! She asked me if I had a card for the video poker machine and I let her know it was my first time at Remedy's. She smiled and said, \"let's start again\".  She set me up for their frequent player card and for a frequent dining card as well. The frequent player card gave me what appeared to be an introductory $10 match bet.  The dining card gave me an introductory $10 off my next dining visit. She explained details of the video poker machine and was very informative. Michelle is great at her job and made the visit pleasant. I saw pool tables at the far corner and what appeared to be a couch with a larger television in another distant corner.  The video poker machines have a minimum bet of $.50, which is higher than other places I've been. The machines seem to be tighter than other places I've visited. The only reason I would consider giving this bar/grill a four star is due to the higher minimum on the video poker.  Everything else is perfect!"}
{"text":"Try to make it our to this bar at least once a month! Friendly, local atmosphere with great prices on both the food and drinks. The owner is so welcoming- when my boyfriend and I just moved here from across the country last year he was so helpful with suggestions of areas to visit and even gave us complimentary welcome drinks. Definitely a local spot I recommend to anyone looking for a chill, fun place to hang out"}
{"text":"A couple friends and I came here for dinner over the weekend. I had the shrimp tacos which were really good. My friend got the nachos which were not so much. It was a plate full of chips and some cheese with maybe a spoonful of chicken. It took about 45 min to get our food after we had ordered. Which isn't a big deal but our waitress never even came around to say there was going to be a wait, or fill our drinks, or even just to check on us. I had a coupon for a buy one get one free entree. When we gave it to the waitress she said it expired. There was no expiration date on the coupon at all. She insinuated the the expiration had been cut off. We were kind of irritated but just paid for our food and left. The food is ok so we might be back. If you have a coupon definitely check to make sure you can actually use it first."}
{"text":"Meh. I think that sums it up, but for the sake of a valid review, the service was lackluster and slow, food greasy. Drinks came fairly fast once ordered, though, and the prices were fair. Overall, a different pub would, I'm sure, be more worth visiting."}
{"text":"I've been in several times, but always just to drink.  This is the first time I ordered any food.  Got into the dining room a little after 5, just in time for Happy Hour.  Domestics were $3, so I got myself a bud light.  

FOOD: Short rib tacos (Happy Hour menu) $8.  You get 3 large tacos stuffed with short rib.  The slaw that was on top was tangy and complimented the beef quite well.  Filet Mignon Silders (Happy Hour menu) $8.  There 2 sliders, but I really wouldn't call them sliders.  My idea of silders are small mini burgers that fit on a dinner roll.  These sliders, however, are the big brother to those sliders.  I'd say they are closer in size to a cheeseburger you get at a fast food joint over a tiny slider.  Chicken wings $10.95 - I always judge bar food by their chicken wings.  First impression, big wings with some HUGE ones mixed in.  My eyes were quite pleased.  I got Hot and Parmesan Garlic.  For seasoned spicy food eaters, the Hot isn't hot at all.  I found them to be quite mild.  Next time I'll get the hottest sauce available.  As for the tang, it was rich and buttery without being overly sour.  I hate when wings just taste of vinegary hot sauce.  The Garlic Parmesan was a nice surprise.  Definitely got a great garlic taste right off the bat with chunks of garlic covering the wings without overpowering the Parmesan.  A solid Garlic Parmesan wing.  

SERVICE: I don't remember our waitresses name, but she was nice.  We were there to watch Game 7 of the NBA Championship, so we asked for the audio to be turned up in the dining room and to have both TVs on the game.  She was very nice about it and put the game up on both TVs.  She was attentive to our needs and made sure our beers and bellies were full.  What more could you ask for!!  

OVERALL: Definitely one of the better bars in town.  I live pretty far from here, so I don't make it out much.  But when I'm in the St. Rose area, this is a place I'd always visit and recommend to friends."}
{"text":"It's a great looking bar inside.... exposed brick walls, lots of TV's, a couple of pool tables and lots of college-age people. It was a little smokey but if you're there to party, you probably won't mind.

I can see getting pretty drunk here and stumbling home. Great local spot for people who live in the Seven Hills area."}
{"text":"This place is a nice little treasure we discovered when we stayed at the Hampton Inn adjacent to it. The ahi street tacos and sliders are delicious. We dined in the restaurant that is separated from the bar area for a more quiet, intimate dinner. The waitresses are all very attentive and friendly. All around great experience."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time last night, I'm not going to lie I had a pretty good buzz going before I even showed up but everyone working was sooooo nice, friendly waitress, cool bar staff, nice door man. The bar was full so we grabbed a table and I got a Greek salad which was delicious,  we ordered a couple drinks and when a spot at the bar opened up we moved over. We had help from Stevo who helped us get a little more drunk and even offered to get us a ride home if we got too drunk."}
{"text":"Came for game night and was pretty underwhelmed. They do have some pretty decent specials for appetizers during the Monday Night Football game though I'll give them that. We ordered the mashed potato bites, pretzel bites, and steak nachos. All were pretty standard bar food fare nothing really to write home about but it wasn't bad either. I think there was only one server in the whole joint so I never got a refill on my drink and I had to look for her to get the check at the end when it was time for us to leave. One and done for me"}
{"text":"I've come here several times since I live right up the street and tonight has been disappointing.  We usually have, I think his name is Steve, the older man, who always takes care of us and tonight we had a female who under-poured my friends Jack Whiskey on the rocks and I got a Gin & Tonic and there was no gin in it.  She also was very stand-off-ish.  Not a good look.  I won't be back if this is the direction this bar is going."}
{"text":"Very relaxed and chill environment! The Beer was Cold! The wings were just ok! I would get the Buffalo strips they were good! The service was decent.. Its a good place for a Cold beer and a game of pool!"}
{"text":"Nice bar, casual atmosphere. We cuddled on the couch by the fireplace and had a few cocktails.  I felt like I was in my living room at home. Our server was friendly & checked on us often. Definitely will go back!"}
{"text":"Staff very nice, clean place. Food lacked. Had chili and corn bread. Chili was luke warm and corn bread clearly had been sitting as it was hard."}
{"text":"Got to the hotel walked across the parking lot for a quick lunch and a beer and was amazed at how great the FIID was!!! The bar was set up so great with big leather chairs in a private area!!! Didn't even venture out to find another place for food and drinks...they were GREAT and you can't beat the atmosphere!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a disappointment. We wanted to visit there since we moved to this side of town. I kinda thought the service wasn't going to be good, because there was a lot of unbused tables when we walked in.  The waitress was serving the bar, the restaurant and busing tables. It took forever to get our food, and it was cold. The bacon on the burger wasn't even cooked. I can't blame the server- you can only do so much. It kills me that the owners put so much in the building and décor, but don't put the money in having enough people to cook and serve. Won't be going back ever."}
{"text":"I live about 5 minutes from Remedy's. Every month I get some BOGO entree from the place. Well I finally used the coupon. And Im happy I did.

Ive been to Remedy's before. Went there for NYE two years ago. Its a fun bar, with comfy chairs and couches, pool, darts, and more. Dont forget the slots lol

I came in with my fiancee to eat. We ordered some Western sliders as an appetizer. Three sliders with BBQ sauce, cheddar cheese, and bacon, with just enough fries were a satisfying appetizer. As far as an entree, I wanted steak and eggs, so thats what I got. I was pleasantly surprised by the taste of my steak. And shoutout the chef, because he made my hash browns PERFECT! I like my hash browns crispy, but not burned. And Remedy's nailed it! I asked for a medium well steak, and thats what I got. My food server, Chrissy or Christy I think, was extremely friendly, considering she was working in both the restaurant AND the bar area.

The only thing I dont like about Remedy's is the bathrooms. The bathrooms are set up right next to the entrance of the bar, but so is the entrance for the restaurant area. If you're fucked up at the bar like me, you'll walk right past the bathroom area outside. Or you'll walk right past the bathroom area into the restaurant side. When drunk, finding the bathroom at Remedy's is like a mini maze. Other than that though, Remedy's is a cool place to catch a few drinks, or eat."}
{"text":"Sitting down to lunch right now. Not busy, which I like and service is pretty good. Ordered a Philly steak sandwich and sweet potato fries. Large portions and totally got my moneys worth. I am so glad this is near me, the food is great!"}
{"text":"Food: get the CURE burger! The most succulent beef & pork patty stuffed with gooey fontina cheese, caramelized onions, sautéed parsnips and jalepeno jelly on a warm, soft brioche bun. So flavorful and juicy!

Service: Kimmy is awesome. So personable and knowledgeable about the menu. She makes this location a cut above the rest!"}
{"text":"Great place to come in and dine! Tara and Tambra are my absolute FAVORITE servers there. Both of them always greet me with a smile and make me feel at home. They know their menu, and they know how to treat guests. Good food, good environment, all around a good time!!"}
{"text":"Since the last and only review was two years ago, I felt the compulsion to defend this little local's joint. And when I say locals, I do *mean* locals! I got tired of PT's and Buffalo Wild Wings, and wanted to try some place new around Henderson. Remedy's caught my eye. 

There are a lot of regulars circle this bar and it's clear the bartender knows them well. They banter back and forth and its all in the name of fun. The menu is pretty good for a bar, I recommend the massive fish tacos. The fish is so thick the tortilla can't wrap around it, and they don't overcook. Yum! The mushroom pasta dinner plate is literally swimming in the cream, they don't hold back. Overall the decor isn't spectacular but the tvs all work and they accomodate you in any way for games and such. 

The drinks are cheap and you always make a friend or two because the regulars love the attention. I like this place a lot, and the manager keeps trying to make my fav, key lime martini every time I go! My bf and I always have a good time here, and people are always winning at this place at the video poker. Have no fear, this place is swell!"}
{"text":"Always good EXCEPT this past Friday.  Food was lukewarm, both my fish tacos and my grandsons burger.  We were there at 12:30, very few customers, so our food shouldn't have been sitting.  There was one waitress, unfriendly, and surely not rushed.  I thought it was strange that there were hardly any cars in the lot at noon on a Friday.  I'll probably try again sometime, maybe just an off day all around...food and service."}
{"text":"Hot firey damn! Tara was our server and she was like an iced margarita on a hot ass Mexican summers evening! She served us the right amount of alcohol where we couldn't felt our legs but our wallets were still on fire, and hot damn the luck she gave us on the slots after!    That slick black hair served us all the way until closing the next day!  
Absolutely will be coming again! Home girl was awesome!"}
{"text":"This particular Remedy's has some of the best pub fare in Vegas. Led by Zack and his team of expert mixologist, The perfect a burger or drink is just an order away!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!!! Food amazing, service always excellent and the RED loyalty program rules. Great place to eat dinner with the kids or to hang in the bar with buddies."}
{"text":"As a local ( transplant from New Jersey) I am always looking for a great spot to feel like you are in a true local bar. Remedy's has mastered that. The food is outstanding, a great selection of both domestic and imported beers on tap. The thing that separates them is the service, from the managers Steve O and Marissa who treat both guest and customers with warmth and respect. As far as the servers they are the A1 top professionals, they know everyone by name and always say hello, this also includes the bar backs and kitchen workers.

When I first started coming to Remedy's it was Marissa's first shift alone, you would've thought we had been friends for years, but she treat everyone the same way. All of the bartenders are attentive and never keep customers waiting unless with another customer. I may be biased, but one stands out she is a swing shift bartender named \"Mel\" Melissa she has a personality second to none and customers light up when they see her coming to give them service, nothing ever seems like and effort, she just smiles and ask how are you doing. It's not that others don't, but as a special way about her. I'm glad they've welcomed as a \"local\" 

Cheers

{"text":"Why did I think that their Steak Nachos would be any better than their Chicken Nachos?

This goes for all places that serve nachos, use real nacho cheese or at least cheese that doesn't dry up to where it becomes a clump of crap.  And if you do use cheese that dries up after being melted at least distribute it evenly all all the chips so that there isn't a lonely dry chip on the plate. 

I was impressed with the size of the Steak Nachos.  I was excited to dig into it.  When I grabbed one chip, it was stuck on to multiple chips that had cheese \"melted\" on.  Right then I knew this meal was going to go down hill.  

The Nacho Cheese was cold and so was the Steak.  I think the Steak should have been hot, right?  I mean, how do you screw up Nachos?  It tasted like our food was sitting on the counter for a while before it even got to us.  

I asked the waiter for a side of the Nacho Cheese because there were so many chips that didn't get cheese.  It wasn't until she brought us a side of cheese that made this bearable to even enjoy.  The Nacho Cheese was HOT!  The way it should have been when it came out. 

So with that being said.... Happy Eatings!  Until next year...."}
{"text":"Marissa rocks and that's all anyone needs to know! 

Oh and their Remedy's chicken sandwich as well as their southwest chicken nachos are amazing!"}
{"text":"Terrible service unless you're gambling. Food is always done wrong (over cooked etc). If you're not super cute or laying down tons of cash good luck getting treated decently."}
{"text":"Slipped in on a Friday night for some dinner, as it was across the street from our hotel. Atmosphere in the dining room is a little depressing. It is glass-walled from the bar. But that might be a good thing since the bar is smoky.

Food was tasty - really tasty. Service cheerful and prompt. Decent selection of beers. My dirty martini was a bit too dirty for my liking, but not a deal-breaker.

Recommended."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I come here for lunch at least there days a week. The food is awesome and reasonably priced.  The staff is friendly and charming, they make you feel very much at home. The locals all come here because it just has that neighborhood vibe! Definitely is my go to place!"}
{"text":"Much better than expected!

Restaurant only Review: The service here was outstanding, the menu loaded with terrific comfort food, the server helpful and friendly, the dining area clean and quiet and the seating extra comfortable with 7 roomy booths and 3 tables. Remedys is an over age 21 joint so there were no noisy kids, and no subtly trying to push things along to make room for the next customer like so most family restaurants have to do. The Chef's Chopped Cobb Salad  with its perfectly cooked applewood smoked bacon and grilled chicken was one of the best. The Turkey Club has mounds of chilled roasted sliced turkey and applewood smoked bacon is about 5 inches deep!  They served sweet potato fries with their very own maple sauce recipe that is out of this world!  Can hardly wait to come again everything was so good."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, local bar. The food is delicious, really tasty. I'll definitely put it on my list of good local spots to visit when I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I love this place.... They have the best fry sweet potatoes ever... The food it's always fresh and the presentation always beautiful.... I can eat there everyday and I won't get tired....."}
{"text":"We come here often for dinner and our service is always great and the food is always delicious! Corinne is an awesome server and always takes such good care of us. :)"}
{"text":"I have occasionally been stopping in here for years now. This is one of my favorite neighborhood bars. Good food, good booze, and pretty employees."}
{"text":"It's a nice looking bar and restaurant.  The restaurant section is completely seperated by a glass wall from the bar.  We sat on the non-smoking dining area. There are lots of plasma TV throughout the place.  We were there last week.

The food was surprisingly tasty, fresh and not greasy at all.  My favorite are the Pot Roast Spring roll which is a house made Spring roll stuffed with savory pot roast, with grilled onions, mash potatoes and mushroom gravy, and Buffalo cauliflower which is tempura battered cauliflower tossed in mild buffalo sauce. It is served with blue cheese and celery sticks.
We also ordered chicken wings and sweet potato fries..

The service was good. We don't live close by but we will be back to check out the happy hour and the bar."}
{"text":"All I have to say is that Raphael, Zack, and Monty are the best bartenders in the game! Seriously... THE BEST bartenders in Vegas! If you come here, do yourself a favor and introduce yourself to these awesome guys, they will become your best friends and confidants!Andre the chef makes THE BEST Cure burger of them all, make sure you add bacon to that beast! And Kyle (The Master Server) will always get you whatever you want with a smile on his face! There is honestly no better local bar than Remedy's! I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!"}
{"text":"Been coming to Remedy's about once a month for a few years now. The food has consistently been fantastic, the service is awesome (particularly Marie), and the beer is cold. It's a nice dark and cool atmosphere and the patrons are always friendly, too. If I was going to open a bar/restaurant I'd hope it would be just like this place."}
{"text":"Kyle the server is the best server I've ever had he waited on me and my girlfriend and let us talk his ear off about our crazy kids and still came back to the table he's awesome he needs a raise definitely going back and requesting him every time"}
{"text":"Great bar, super awesome staff!. The food is great too.  You gotta try the mashed potato bites! Steavo is the man! We literarly come here every Friday now!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite bars in town. Love everyone that works here, it stays busy and it is super close to my house which makes it convenient"}
{"text":"The food is great. The service not so great! They are very slow!  It doesn't seem to matter if they are busy or not, you still wait a long time for food. If they are busy expect a 45 minute wait to get you! 
We returned 5/20 much better!! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Loving lunch today. Great food, coldest beer and a pretty server - doesn't get better than that! 

Order the Cure burger- yum!"}
{"text":"Love them video poker machines....  My husband feels lucky here. Always a winner...  Even if we break even, we are ahead. And loads of TV screens nothing but sports. Good bar food....  Great staff...  And love the fact it's in our neighborhood, just a few blocks away from our front door"}
{"text":"Good food but some bartenders (were girls) were charging my glass of drink even if i played and lost $80-$100 in less than 10 minutes. We used to come here at least twice a week, but  since that time that they were charging my drinks after losing $140 combined, we stop coming here."}
{"text":"This is the only bar in the are for a couple miles in any direction, and it serves is purpose as a local watering hole well. 

Sadly, they've discontinued the artichoke appetizer, and replaced it with a spinach/artichoke dip which though good, can't compare to the artichoke itself. Drink prices are average for any gaming bar/tavern in the Greater Las Vegas Area. The specialty cocktails are overpriced for a place like this, one can easily get an expertly mixed cocktail at many on strip or downtown lounges for the same price range as a cocktail here. The rest of the menu is fairly priced though, I would recommend this pasta with sausage and peppers they have (forgot the name), very delicious and filling.

Service here is great and the staff is very attentive and remember you whether you have been here once or on many occasions."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this Remedy's for a while. We usually come in at later hours. We have always had good service and the bartenders and food servers are always friendly. Tonight we stopped in for a couple of beers and a late dinner. I had the French dip which was very good. My wife had the black and bleu burger which is always good and her son had the jalapeño popper burger which he finished very quickly. My Guinness took a little longer to reach the table which is a good sign, as I know it was poured correctly. We'll be back as we have always had a good time here."}
{"text":"The service here is complete crap... WTF? It's a bar, can I get a beer? Spend some money? Annoying..."}
{"text":"Absolutely Pleasant staff.  Great food, quite a surprise.  My company put me up at the Hampton Inn, so I wasn't expecting to find a comfortable place for some grub and a beer.
I'll make sure to come back next time I'm anywhere near Las Vegas.
(Try the brisket sliders, wow)"}
{"text":"Nice little bar located on St. Rose and Seven Hills (Spencer) near Eastern.  There's plasma screens around, comfortable seating, and the bar's located in the middle.  Even though the place was really busy, the service was a lot better than I would have expected it to be with a packed crowd like that.  The food was pretty good too, but I have no idea how much it cost.  Drinks are fairly priced.  It's a nice little spot next to home, and surprisingly, a lot of people in their 20/30's there.  We all celebrated a friend's birthday there, and it was a great spot to pick."}
{"text":"What a great find!  Staying at the Hampton Inn and was told about this place by the front desk.  Great service, cold beers and delicious burgers.  Definitely a neighborhood hangout.  Will be back when in town."}
{"text":"You want to go to here!
   Clean, Pool tables, Nice, video machines at the bar if you need em'  Really Good Food! Pub meets coffee shop relaxed atmosphere!"}
{"text":"The food is ok. I think it is very good priced, and the service is great when the servers are not arguing! Most of the bartenders are all very friendly and easy to talk to! The food takes quite a while certain nights and other nights it comes out very quick. It's hit or miss. I will o back but not often."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time here, the attitude isn't worth it -- Head to T-Bird's just down the street. Super friendly, extremely accommodating and they even have little speaker boxes so you can hear the game you're watching. YOU WILL NOT GET THIS SERVICE OR FRIENDLINESS AT REMEDY'S. The guy working at Remedy's, the owner? Absolute tool. The ladies working as servers and bartenders? Completely clueless. Came here to watch a March Madness game with a party of four, looking for the game, drinks, and maybe some snacks. What we got was incompetence and douchebaggery. We wanted a margarita pitcher, which they don't have. That's fine, maybe our server could have suggested something else, or tried to accommodate us? Our next question was whether we could get sound for the game, instead of what the jukebox was playing - 90s crap, which under the right circumstances, is great. But this is a sports bar, not a karaoke joint or nostalgia diner or what have you. After all, the handful of people at the bar were all watching the same game. No, you don't want to? Ok, can we get subtitles maybe? No? Alright, we will just sit close to the TV in the lounge section. What's that? You have a party coming in an hour and don't want us to sit in that area for the hour that they aren't using the seats? Fine. We'll take our business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Cheap beer and drinks.  Draught beer is always fresh, especially their Bluemoon. Bar manager Steve-O is cool. Ambiance is not that of a typical bar; there is large leather couch seating, a one-of-a-kind digital juke box, touch-screen games for non-gamblers, and pool tables.  Food prices are reasonable; I recommend the pretzel bites.  There is a separate dine-in section for families with kids."}
{"text":"This place sucks, do not go there. the bartenders drink on the job, rub combative etc. I would recommend you choose another bar to eat, drink and play at. Remedy's at 3265 Saint Rose Parkway Henderson, NV 89052 is a awful bar. This Henderson bar in Nevada has bad service, bad food. In my opinion do not go to this bar in Henderson call Remedy's. 

Remedy's A local bar in Henderson, NV right outside of Las Vegas in Saint Rose has the worst bartenders in all of the local bars in Las Vegas. They are rude bartenders, poor bartenders and the bar lacks human decency. I would recommend anyone to choose another bar in Henderson, Nevada besides Remedy's A Local Bar located at 3265 Saint Rose Parkway Henderson, NV 89052. There phone number to Remedy's Local Bar is 702) 982-3026 for anyone who wants to complain about the poor service by the bar. 

thanks!"}
{"text":"This place is near my work. I think it is great especially because there is nothing else nearby. On Wednesdays they do half off for lunch time and it is a steal. The food is far beyond in quality from your typical sports bar kind of place. Also the waitstaff is real cool and friendly. It can be very busy on Wednesday's but that is to be expected when you are giving your food for half off. I am there regularly."}
{"text":"Great looking bar and restaurant.  The restaurant section is completely seperated by a glass wall from the HUGE bar.  Lots of plasmas throughout the place.  We were there at midnight on a Friday night and the place was packed!  In fact, we were the only people in the restaurant part for most of our meal.

The food was good; fresh and not greasy at all.  Fairly standard fare for an upscale pub in the area though.  Pricey though.  $9.50 for chicken wings or chicken fingers?  That said, at midnight in this part of town, your options are somewhat limited and Remedy's absolutely hit the spot.

The service was outstanding.  Our waiter was friendly and attentive to a fault, even though he was very very busy with tables in the bar as well.

We plan on going back to try the bar as well."}
{"text":"Good to know that even when it's busy (go knights go!) i still get great service ! And the new menu items ? WOW I've always got to update my review when i come in here because it's not only the best bar in hendo but the best restaurant. I'll still enjoy my hendo remedys !!"}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start with this place, everything I have tried is amazing. I love the mashed potatoes bites and pretzel bites they are amazing. They have the most amazing food and the atmosphere of the restaurant is upbeat and amazing. I love how the bar area is also a gaming room as well. You can sit in a chair and enjoy your glass of wine or play a game of pool. The drinks are the best as well. I love coming here for Happy Hour as well. Very decent prices and amazing food. I will be coming back for sure and recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"The prices are WAY too high, this place is nowhere near the strip, and the service is far below accommodating. I look forward to it hopefully becoming a dotty's in the near future"}
{"text":"This locals tavern is AMAZING! My fiancé and I always go on Wednesday when the food from 11-2 is half off! Awesome service and the food is always spot on! Delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"The first time we came here I was astonished. The food was great, service was on par and the atmosphere was good enough. Now....I'd rather spend my money elsewhere. 

The second time we came in for some drinks and appetizers with my parents the service was so bad that I had to put away my OWN menu..after 30 minutes of it sitting in my face and taking up all my space when there was food to eat, I was sick of it. So I put it back...during that entire night I had to round up our server 3 times in order to get her to do anything. Either they were understaffed of she just didn't care...either of which I could believe. The drinks were weak, but the salsa was good so I continued to give it another chance.

The last time I went in I was disgusted. We sat again in the dinning area and underneath my place mat was old, dried up food from someone else. I didn't order a drink as I have found that the drinks just aren't made correctly. I ordered my favorite from the first time, the chipotle chicken nachos. It was DISGUSTING this time. Some of the chicken was cold, the sauce was gloppy and all together it just didn't taste right."}
{"text":"Great food and easy going spot. Beer is cold and there is great service. Corinne served us and was excellent."}
{"text":"Good service with attention to detail. Has a great hometown bar feeling where you feel comfortable immediately upon entering. There are regulars & newbies, and you cannot distinguish between them as the bartenders make sure they introduce themselves & know your name. 

Went for a girls night out and it was nice because we sat at the bar and could hold a conversation without screaming. Music was great without being overpowering. 

We didn't eat during this visit, but the other guests who were eating seemed satisfied, as the presentation and timeliness of their food seemed quite good. 

Looking forward to returning with my hubby or the girls again soon!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent neighborhood bar.  I lived in DC/MD for a few years and my friend is from VA.  We asked about the Maryland crab cakes because when we saw them on the menu, we both thought \"eek!\"  They say the are flown in frozen, so no thanks.  The sliders looked tasty, but I went with the avocado eggrolls and I did not regret them.  While we were there for a chat and the lovely martinis, the food was surprisingly good.  I would have given it 4 stars if the service was better.  Sometimes, I think female waitresses in bars ignore women customers because they need to spend their time flirting with the guys who are drunk and giving better tips."}
{"text":"I love this bar! The food is so good. I love their salads, sweet potato fries, and omg their avocado eggrolls are amazing. The bartenders are great and the drink prices are pretty standard. Definitely my favorite bar in Henderson"}
{"text":"If you like remaking of stale smoke, visit this place. We loved the atmosphere and food.... but it so ridiculously smoky,we couldn't go back."}
{"text":"Took a bit to get a list of the beer and the girl at the bar seemed like it was inconvenient for her to get the beer since she was too busy flirting with some guy. A lady ordered food just down the bar and the bartender seemed like she was too good to take her order. 
The environment was nice and they have a good beer selection. They just need to train their daytime bartender to not be so rude."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great food. Not to smokey. Nice locals bar and the staff is very friendly. Went for Monday night football and got great service. Tell Marie, David said hi."}
{"text":"I am infuriated with the service I received here. When I first arrived the bartender was more concerned with the conversation he was having with one of the cooks than greeting me and taking my order. I came here for a to-go order, and after waiting patiently I decided on a medium burger and a short Guinness. I waited for this burger to be cooked for entirely too long, and the bartender told me that it would be out soon. Even the gentleman I was sitting next to noted how long it took to make me a burger and some fruit.  15 minutes later the bartender came back and said it would be out shortly, and when I told him he said that a while ago he said that the burger I ordered fell apart. When he did finally bring out my burger it wasn't to go, like I had asked when I first arrived and placed my order. I packed my burger, went outside and took a bite and it was ice cold. I went inside to return my ice cold burger and the cook asked me what temperature I had ordered the burger. If the burger just came out of the kitchen it should have at least been slightly warm... not ice cold. I even asked him to touch it to confirm what I had said and he just threw it away. To be treated like I was too dumb to know this because I ordered my burger medium rare is an insult to my intelligence. I always order my burgers medium rare, and they are always at least slightly warm. I was patient while I waited there for almost 45 minutes to get my food, but a cold burger? This place needs to get their act together. I drove 10 minutes away to Del Taco instead. This place is disgusting. What a waste of my time entirely."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is nice and very good place to grab a bite to eat. The service was good and wasn't too crowded for a long wait. This is one of the better sports bar's I've been to and definitely will be back for my business."}
{"text":"I'm eating late lunch in the dining area. Let me tell you waitress Christine has Super customer service skills, has memorized a room full of people orders, does good check-ups, and is very speedy. The food is Great too, my compliments to the chef for an Excellent job."}
{"text":"I was there last night 11/18/2017, and I was served by Corinne. SHES AWESOME! She was super fast bringing everything out (s/o to the cooks as well). Super sweet and funny!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here looking for a new place to hang out with our move. Its really not very smoky on the bar which is nice. The bartender we had was great (chad I think).  The other guy who took our empty glasses and didn't bother asking if we wanted another drink was another story.  Didn't have food on this visit but those arounfd us who did...the food looked great.  Please work on consistent service. This would be a convenient local bar! !!"}
{"text":"Dude this place is legit ! From Stevos bar to this one remedy's is the best bar in town ! Nicole was a fantastic bartender to walk into on a Saturday afternoon ! Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Remedy's has become my favorite place to hang out.  Steve'O (manager) has selected an amazing staff. Bartenders (Marissa \"da bomb\", Michelle, Melissa, Jazzie and Ryan) they're are the most attentive and personable I have ever met and I can't leave out Laura...you rock!  At this point, they all know my name (remember the Cheers theme song), I feel both comfortable and relaxed whenever I'm there.  I read a review that said the place smelled like smoke, not even close!  

The food is great too!  I've enjoyed the Potato Bites (love the jalapeño ranch sauce that comes with it.), I've also enjoyed the Pot Roast which has been a special on two occasions, tender and succulent, the gravy is amazing.  I believe anything on the menu would be enjoyed by all.

Toby Keith said it best about Remedy's in his song \"I Love This Bar\", \"I love this bar, it's my kind of place. Just walk in through the front door, puts a big smile on my face. It ain't too far, come as you are, mmm, I love this bar!

If you're looking for a place to meet friends, the \"locals\" are warm and talktive.  Don't hesitate to visit Remedy's for a drink, a few beers or a great meal, you won't regret it.

GREAT JOB STEVE'O!!!"}
{"text":"I  just had the worst experience ever at this bar. Came in with a couple friends and sat at the bar and ordered drinks and I sat at a machine. I just played $120 dollars plus another $100 in winnings in the matter of 20 mins. Meanwhile we had ordered food and relaxing. Our food arrives and the lady bartender comes over and says, this is reserved for players and I need the machine, my response, I just blew $120 in the machine, does that not buy me some time to sit? Wait for this, her response, \"No, Not Really!\" Well then peace, take our food back and the new round of drinks that came out. We left $20 on the counter and $16 and some change in the other machine my friend was playing. I have never been treated this badly. Someone needs to remind this woman that we live in Vegas and Vegas is a small town. P.S. I just purchased a new home in Inspirada and this location would be my new watering hole. I won't be returning and you better believe that anyone, anyone that comes to my home will not be going to Remedys. Sadly, I am the one who lost out by getting bad service and loosing my but on the machine."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was fast. Overall I had a good experience.
The service was good. The staff didn't forget about us. 
Food is reasonably price pub food. But the breakfast is great. I got the country fried steak and eggs. The meal was huge. The portion of steak was large and they use larger eggs. 
I've been there for dinner and it's great food too. 
The only part I would complain about is the music. For the breakfast crowds, they don't turn down the music. 
Overall great food and I'll be be back."}
{"text":"Love the crowd on a weekend, they had a band for a few hours. Was very relaxing :) I had the breakfast sliders and their mix drinks were very good. Prices were very good :)"}
{"text":"I would give this place 5 stars if it wasn't for the need to put in a gas mask upon entering. Geesh, invest in a better air filtration system. The cigarette smoke is absolutely disgusting, clouds billowing out of the chain smokers sitting at video poker machines or around the pool table is vile. And who even smokes nowadays? Nothing like needing to shower after grabbing a bite to eat...
Food ordered was decent to delish ; pretzel bites with 3 different dipping sauces, buffalo wings with fries and crudités, 3 pulled pork slider sandwiches and hash browns with two ham and cheese on English toast. They have Leinenkugal on tap, as well as other beers and a full bar. 
Service, our little server was very sweet and attentive. 
Next time I want to try out my Zombie Apocalypse  gas mask, I will return to Remedy's."}
{"text":"Some of the best bar food ever!  About half the time the drinks are strong.. and  by strong i mean STRONG!  they use to have a string of girls that worked there that were terrible bartenders, and i refused to go there.  Finally gave the place another chance and found out that the old broads that worked there found employment elsewhere and had great service, hence the four stars.  If you would have asked me a month ago i would have rated waaaay lower!"}
{"text":"Stoped in Remedy's for lunch over the weekend, and ordered the watermelon feta salad. After I had ate a pretty good portion of my salad, I noticed an insect mixed in with the salad, it was dead, but I could see that it was black with one wing still attached to it. It almost resembled one of the pecans that are in the salad, so thankful I noticed it. Once we flagged down the waitress, she nonchalantly observed the bug and took the plate back into the kitchen. By this time I began to feel more nauseous. The waitress returned only to say it was bee, which it was not from what I had seen. She then asked if we still wanted the rest of our order which were two burgers, we told her we weren't sure. She then went back into the kitchen and didn't return. I never received an apology, or any type of compensation, she never even returned. At least several minutes went by, before my fiancé and I left the restaurant. I was very disappointed in the service I received at this location. I don't plan to return again I won't be able to get past the winged insect in my watermelon salad."}

{"text":"Good hamburgers. Decor is new and inviting. The video poker pay tables are what you would expect from a small local bar/restaurant (which is, the pay tables are bad). But any experienced video poker player already knows that, local bars/restaurants, are going to have poor pay tables and is not the place to gamble. Overall, this is a good place to have some drinks and food with your friends."}
{"text":"Looks like a standard vegas dim neighborhood bar. Only stopped in to pick up food but there were some bro looking guys hanging around and I saw some lifted trucks parked outside so I will definitely be back to drink. 
The girls working were very kind and smiley and got me out of there quickly. 
I wasn't too happy with the turkey burger which was running dry. Four stars for their nachos alone! Chipotle chicken nachos are bomb. Massive portion of deliciously juicy chicken and all your nacho trimmings like pico de gallo and cheese. What makes these stand out is the sprinkle of cotija cheese, which has a sharp taste and is pretty much a mexican version of feta. 
Only thing that I would suggest to make these better is to add more cotija, and to layer the toppings so you don't end up with a load of empty chips."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times...There was a day I went during a stressful day at school to have a drink, and eat something good...The bartender completely ignored didn't even bother to come my way; She was focused on one area of the bar. The server who brings in the food was busy sorting, knives, forks, and spoons in a cubby...She and I made contact once, but she was busy doing her job...(so I assume..) Bar tender begins to make another drink for that side of the table, and continues to talk to them without acknowledging another guest. After the 15minutes I was fed up, and just left...To go eat somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Walked in and it was bad service already! I sat at bar with some friends. Bartender was rude, asked for a Jameson and ginger ale when he gives it to me it spills everywhere. No consideration! I guess this bartender name is Ryan he looks like complete tool with a girl attitude. As I sip on my drink I notice it taste like straight ginger ale! Didn't want to say anything, because I thought I could just order another one from a different bartender. But it was only one bartender that night. Decide to go sit at a table order wings and country fried steak sliders. 3/10 My girlfriend orders me another drink she comes back with jack Daniels and ginger ale. I let the bartender know, I wanted a Jameson and he gives me a attitude. I tell him that the last drink he gives me tasted like straight ginger ale. He doesn't do anything and hands me my drink. I take it and it was tasted the same way!!! I go back to my table and watched him pour other drinks, this bartender gives everyone a teaspoon of liquor!!  I'm done at this point, ask for my check and just leave! I rather go to PTs where they have happy hour and they pour my drinks right! Never again!"}
{"text":"The food is good, friendly staff and good drinks.    

They have a fire place so you can sit and eat your dinner, have a drink.   1/2 price lunches on Tuesdays.   

I am not a fan of the buffalo prawns but everything else I have tried is good."}
{"text":"Very poor customer service. The waitress totally ignored me for 25mins before I had to say 'hello! Then she sarcastically came over and gave me a half way apology with 'well yea I didn't see you over here'. 
Not friendly at all. After the poor service I still tipped a nice tip. This is the  Last time I will be coming in this place. Smh"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and menu. Only drawback is if you come during non-peak hours, you'll be waiting forever for a server or have to ask someone to send you a server. Staff is always very friendly."}
{"text":"Excellent spinach dip and their salsa is grand. Clean and friendly.  It's a younger atmosphere than most local gaming bars in the area. The menu is a bit better than the usual local bar food menu."}
{"text":"So I was looking for something edible and a couple drinks.   It's been a long day and I just wanted to relax.   The staff was SUPER friendly.  When I said I wanted a food menu I was very surprised to hear they had a pot roast dinner as the special.   I do not normally think of pot roast as bar food., but I figured I'd give it a shot.   HOLY SMOKES!!!!!!   I am not kidding when I say it was the best pot roast I've had I YEARS!!!   I won't say too much about their \"pour\" except to say you will NOT be disappointed.   

GREAT BAR!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is the best! My girlfriend and I live a 2 minute walk away and come in at least once a week for a good meal! The entire staff is awesome, food consistently good (must try CURE burger!!), and great atmosphere to watch sports. Big shout out to Zach and Nicole for always making sure you're hooked up! 
All negative reviewers are negative people looking for problems- seriously, nothing to change about  this exceptional place!"}
{"text":"This is MY bar! I just love this place and miss it when I leave town. The food is excellent and the people are awesome! Anything with steak in it is like crack."}
{"text":"Had a nice several rounds of drinks here and really enjoyed the atmosphere and especially the friendly service.  Smoke was a little thick (they could probably use a better smoke eater system), drink prices were reasonable and the food was tasty (especially the pretzel bites).  The only real downer was the sour-puss bouncer at the door.  I am not a kid, and don't like to walk in a place with someone scowling at me who was not only evil-eyeing my wife and I , but was rude as well. Maybe they get trouble makers and like to send a message, but I felt it was inappropriate.  Over all though a nice bar with nice people."}
{"text":"Any place that will make a breakfast burrito all day and put anything you want in it is a place I can love. Plus being so close to the house and the great little fireplace area to enjoy some cocktails make it just a very nice cozy place to enjoy a night out when you do actually get one. Great staff from the kitchen all the way to the front really good grub and just an all over fun time I would recommend remedys to anyone in the area who doesn't want to deal with the strip or stupid drunks very quiet really love it."}
{"text":"Super-friendly staff and patrons. I came in here on a Monday a couple weeks ago for dinner, a drink and to check out the local place as I'm moving to the area next month and everyone could not have been friendlier or more welcoming. The drinks were great and the bartender, Kim, had asked me if I had ever had a 'Red Death' because I'm a Southern Comfort drinker and it's a SoCo shot, so I had told her 'no' and the next shot I ordered she made two, for me and herself, and bought my shot. 

As far as the food, I had the New York sandwich and it was perfect. I don't know what kind of aioli was on it, but it was delicious. I do wish the steak was cut into strips, to make for easy consumption. 


I told them I would be back next month, and I will. 


...And not just because I could hit the building with a baseball from where I'm moving to!"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place but the employees are just so hit and miss.  I don't like to give bad reviews, this place should be 4 stars at least but it's either an issue with the food or an issue with service.  The food I've only had an issue once, the service it has been several bad experiences, I'm sad.  My last visit I had a great experience with a waitress however, on this visit we came in late, 1:30am ish with a party of seven.  There were two bartenders, the taller one seemed annoyed with us even though everyone was sitting at the bar with the exception of two of us and we just wanted food.  It was my step daughters 21st bday, we had been out, nobody in the party was drunk or obnoxious, we were just hungry and  wanted to eat.

I asked for a water with lemon and never got it.  I don't know what his issue was but I am just about done with paying for crappy service.  No one in our party gave this guy any reasons to treat us like crap but he did. I had to ask the other bartender for a water with lemon.  He was very cool and very accommodating.   After my last visit I was ready to give this place a solid 4 stars but I am just done.  I like consistency and it just does not seem to happen here.

I know Amy V. really cares, but her employees when she is not around just don't seem to have the same passion for quality service.   As for the food it was totally awesome in everyone's opinion but at this point it really does not matter, the Bartendar destroyed the experience.  Even my wife who never talks bad about anyone said he had a bad personality.  For the two of us sitting at the table, he never left the back of the bar.  When our food came we had to go to the bar and bring it to the table ourselves and for refills, we had to get up and go to the bar which I really would not have minded if his attitude was more welcoming.  I mean seven people coming in to eat and drink is pretty good business.  My wife wanted to go somewhere else but I insisted here because of the food selection, next time I will listen to her."}
{"text":"If you live in this part of town and it isn't your go-to watering hole, you're missing out. Consistently delicious food. Freezing beer and generous drinks. Great bartenders on every shift. Appropriate for any type of group. And the manager Stevo, is the reincarnation of the old school bar keep. He takes pride in everything he does and is always there with a smile. I've been coming here since it opened and its my home away from home. No shame in my game! If you haven't been, get here."}
{"text":"Rems is the best bar in town Kim n Niki are the best bartenders in Henderson ! And the taquitos are awesome ! This is my favorite bar check it out if you're in henderson ask for Niki or Kim and you won't be disappointedf"}
{"text":"Fun place with good retro music, pool tables and conversation seating.  Good food and even better service.  Thanks, Christie!"}
{"text":"Always a pleasure going into this bar. The staff is awesome and so polite. The drinks are tasty and so is the food. Great prices and they have a great happy hour."}
{"text":"Sculpin grapefruit and regular on tap and extremely cold! The ahi salad is amazing-fresh ahi and loved the wasabi dressing. My husband absolutely loved the Remedy's chicken sandwich!"}
{"text":"Wow mina and Brittany were amazing. We had a great time and amazing food with these awesome bartenders. Then after all that we won a jack daniels bag for drinking my favorite whiskey lol. I'll be back asap."}
{"text":"Not a bad local bar. We were on the bar side, so this review only applies to that area.

Seating is a mix of bar, high tops, and club chairs. If you're eating, the bar or high tops are probably your best bet, but we sat in the club chairs and there was space enough to eat comfortably.

Decent beer list, and the food options were pretty straight forward. I had the burger, and it was cooked right. Our server was pretty off, though. There was a big group of bikers in the corner, but other than them, we were the only folks here. Maybe she got pulled to the other side as well? Either way, the beers didn't come out quickly, nor at the same time for a group of three.

Overall, though, this place aint bad. If I lived down here, or was just looking to meet up with someone for a drink and maybe to watch some sports this would fill the ticket."}
{"text":"So I have to update my review.  Still a good place to eat but they got rid of the Tuesday half off lunch special from 1100am 2pm.  Prices seemed to have gone up to but I cant confirm this.  That would explain why there was only one other person in the dining area.  They must of figured they can just rely on the locals pumping their hard earned dollars into the machines so no reason to offer a discounted meal......like I said food is still good, but not good enough for me to be back."}
{"text":"Remedy's is one of those neighborhood bars with gambling that Vegas has so many of. Let's do this review in a pros & cons style based on 2 years of giving them our business. 

Pros: 
Easy interstate access off I-515 or as some call it the 95. 
Ample parking. 
Nice building on the outside. 
Dark but nice on the inside. 
Plenty of HDTV's around the bar and strategically placed so you can watch pretty much anything that's on at the time. 
Separate, glassed off non-smoking area if you want to eat without the smoke. 
Drinks: strong pours by knowledgeable bartenders who know their stuff. 
Food: from fish & chips to nachos they have a pretty nice range of offerings with something for almost everyone. And their sliders have been real kid pleasers around here. 
THEY OFFER TAKEOUT WITHOUT ATTITUDE. Just walk in, go to the back of the bar and find a bartender and you'll have nicely wrapped bags of food in no time. 
Oh and if they say 15 minutes, they mean 15. I like their consistency. 

Cons: 
Service can sometimes be slow. Sometimes...but it's rare. 
Food: I've had the occasional problem like soggy sweet potato fries, or cold onion rings, and I've had maybe 2 orders out of 50+ that had issues where I sent it back or complained. Again, 2 out of 50+. 
I did find a strand of hair on my sweet potato fries once. 
On a bright day adjusting to how dark the place is can be a little rough. But it's a bar, so I really shouldn't say anything about it but I did anyway. 

Again, I'm looking back over 2 years plus now as I write this and my family keeps asking for their food, and we keep going back. 

4 Stars. YMMV but for us Remedy's will be staying on our fail-safe food options list."}
{"text":"I am updating my review based off of the past few experiences I have had. 

The food is still awesome, in my opinion, the service needs to be improved. 

During busier times, it can be a bit of a wait. Simply ordering your food can be a challenge as you wait on the server. Food takes longer than it should to come out. Lastly, even trying to get your check and pay can be a challenge. 

In my most recent experience, dinner ended up taking over an hour and a half. Definitely not what I expected."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner tonight.  It seems like a good place to go to have a couple of drinks, but not the best place to go for a meal.  I don't need to have a server act like my new best friend, but the bartender could have been a little more friendly.  Anyway, I ordered the Reuben and I was quite unimpressed. The sweet potato fries were a nice option, though.  My fiancee ordered a Hawaiian Chicken Wrap, and it was juicy and fresh-tasting.  The prices are a little higher than a lot of the bar-restaurants in this city, and while the quantity of food served justifies the price, I would have enjoyed better quality.  I have driven by this place a lot of times, always wanting to stop in.  There was something about the look of the place.  I know, whatever.  Now that I have finally gone in, I think my mild obsession is over."}
{"text":"Bad service because they never have enough staff so the staff they have is always frantically rushing around, in turn, rushing you when you order! Slow to send the food out and when it comes, it's only \"ok\", nothing to brag about. I won't be going here again."}
{"text":"We come to Remedies quite often and today on Mother's Day .... we brought our folks to celebrate.
I have never had a bad meal here so that is why it's still gets stars. However, I've had slow service in the past but always friendly. Today was a different store, for whatever reason the waitress made it abundantly clear that she had a problem with us. We are really easy going and I rarely write a bad revue but today was Mother's Day and I am not letting this go...
She had a bad attitude from the start and was rude not once but twice with my father. We had to ask for our silverware after our salads were served, ask for more water and coffee (as my father will drink a pot all by his self). My husband and I ordered hamburgers and then had to ask for the condiments which was easier not to bother as we were half done at that point.
To make matters more rude... my mom and I watched as this same waitress gave every woman in the restaurant a rose for Mother's Day except my mom and I.
This is why my TIP to her was written on the receipt that her attitude is the reason she did not get a nice large tip. In fact she did not deserve the 1 I left her. Does that tell you why I am leaving this review. It was totally uncalled for, and just plain rude!"}
{"text":"Average everything. No special reason to return. Not a FUN bar. Gaming and a drink that's it. Stools a bit dangerous with the push pins coming out of the arm rests."}
{"text":"As far as a nice place right on the corner of Seven Hills and st. Rose. I like the seating and will probably frequent during games and fights if they have them. Clean contemporary and upper middle class vibe to it."}
{"text":"I went there with my honey a few days ago. The place was packed! It was half off the menu from 11am-2pm. This little gem is hidden off the freeway. I must have passed it 1000 times before we tried it. Once you get inside, its a beautiful place. High ceilings, fireplace in a lounge area with huge overstufed chairs with tables so you can eat there if you wish. I ordered the calamari, it was cooked perfectly. The sauce was great, sweet, sour and a little spicy. She ordered the salmon salad and ate every bit of it. I had the grilled vegetable sandwich, it was great. The sweet potato fries were stand outs too. Our poor server was slammed but she did very well and had a great personality. We will be back. Good service and great food in Hendertucky, a welcome addtion to the area!"}
{"text":"This is for the restaurant area. The bar area looked ok, I'm not a smoker though so I tried to hang out in the non-smoking restaurant side. That area needs some help. It was silent, it had a TV but no sound, no music. My husband and I sat around for awhile but when no one showed up to take our order we decided to leave."}
{"text":"My favorite to smoke and drink close to home"}
{"text":"I love this Bar! I officially refer to it as my \"Cheers Bar\" I'm a regular and love the service and hospitality I receive on all the Shifts!!!"}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I used to go in here for the great drinks and food but lately we have been getting horrible customer service and staff was not very friendly till we started flashing money. I understand you work for tips but we shouldn't have to throw you money just to get a refill."}
{"text":"Football specials are going on and the Mac and cheese burger is soooo good!  Go see my FAVORITE waitress, Corinne and eat well!"}
{"text":"I used to frequent Remedy's nearly every weekend to either play pool or Buck Hunter, but the last time I went in there with another girlfriend after we got off work at 2am, we felt completely harassed by some drunk jerks who couldn't take no for an answer. All we wanted was to eat our food at the bar in peace, but these guys were just relentless. The bartender failed to do anything to help, which left a really bad taste.  We ended up having to box our food up and leaving.  

Anyway, they got rid of Buck Hunter, which is BS!! Because it is the BEST game in the entire world!!! LOL.  

I do like the food a lot.  The cobb salad is delicious!  But sadly, the crowd is hit or miss, and now with no Buck Hunter, there's really no reason to go."}
{"text":"Remedy's has a wonderful ambiance!  I enjoyed this very much as well as the service.

The food choices are also varied, from burgers, wraps, salads and larger entrees like steaks, chicken, fish, fish and chips...

We ordered the ribeye steak and the grilled chicken.  Each order came out with a nicely presented garden salad with dressing on the side.  Tasty and fresh.

The meals come out fairly quickly.  The chicken we ordered with double vegetables and no rice.  The ribeye, medium.  

Overall, the chicken was tasty and the veggies were good. Just the dish was on the \"smaller portion\" side.

The ribeye is not on the bone, but at those prices you would not expect it to be.  Not bad, tasty as well, just sometimes a bit chewy.  I think that can be normal with an inexpensive cut of ribeye.

Overall, great experience, great prices and awesome service.  I would for sure come back.

GK says, check it out."}
{"text":"If you like loud music and hearing even louder F-bombs being dropped then this is the place for you.

Food is okay but bar service is poor. Pretty bad when you have to repeatedly ask for silverware and a drink.

With all the other great places around, why waste your money here."}
{"text":"To expensive for bar food a Pabst is $3.50!!??!!  My beer tasted like soap because they didn't clean the soap out of the glass.  My first visit I found there to be quite a high number of \"hoes\" and \"douchbags\"."}
{"text":"Solid bar w above average food and a wide variety of seating. The pool tables are always a fun option and you gotta love the 24/7. Great place to catch a nightcap before heading home. I give it my blessing!"}
{"text":"This place has great ambiance, attentive staff, and delicious food. Our first trip to Remedy's we sat on the bar side. Very comfortable seating and lots of TVs for all the sports action. 

Our second trip we sat on the restaurant side. Again, just as comfortable and staff were equally great."}
{"text":"Last bar stop on your way to Boulder City!

A few weeks ago, a bunch of us visited this place to celebrate a birthday.  I love the fact that this place is totally \"off the beaten path.\" It's relatively close to my house at the end of Boulder Hwy. 

The place is a typical Remedy's.  One section for the restaurant (non smoking) and a huge section for the bar (smoking allowed).  This place was super busy and filled with locals, MY FAVORITE!  Ample sitting area, the staff is super efficient.  All in all, the atmosphere and ambiance was super inviting and really entices you to come back!  If you live in the area, I'm sure you've been here before.  If not, be sure to grab a drink and say what's up!"}
{"text":"Pretty good salsa and I think it's fresh too. The spinach dip is great and so are their salads. I've had every salad and I like them all. Everything is really tasty. It seems pretty clean and the service is ok. The bartenders tend to be a bit slow and if you aren't a gamer at the bar,  you may get ignored.  If the service was better I would give it a 5 star. To be honest, the 4 stars is generous considering the poor consistent service by the bartenders.  I'll keep going for food but I just automatically expect to have to wait... wait... or be ignored."}
{"text":"Wow what a great place ! From the food to the staff!! How is this place not 5 stars ?! Every time me and my family go in the food is crazy good! And the staff is always friendly no matter if you sit in the bar or dining room. They always go above and beyond to make you feel at home. I recommend this place for anyone looking to have it all!"}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend and we each ordered a burger with fries. A couple who walked in right before was in and out before our food even came out to the table. Waiting for 30+ minutes when the place is slow is nuts! Plus the group that came in 20 minutes or so after us got their food at the same exact time and had ordered an appetizer!! That same group also left before we were even given our check. The food was good but not worth coming back if it's gonna take over an hour to order, get our food and eat on a slow night."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good about Remedy's! This is my favorite local watering hole! When I feel like a night out away from my kiddos this is my spot. The bartenders are friendly and fun. Zak is funny and always welcoming. Kim is sweet and sassy. Nicole is adorable and always chill to chat with...and Marie is one of my favorite lunch time gals! 
I like that I can come in and play some keno, have a few drinks, and enjoy some delicious food with good people. I've never had a bad meal here. I've been frequenting this location for at least five years. I even bring my daughters into the restaurant side on occasion and we have breakfast or lunch. My girls love their pancakes and their french fries with ranch. *Side note: their fries are SO GOOD!!
If you're looking for good food, good drinks, and good fun, check out Remedy's!"}
{"text":"Food is really good and they serve an extensive menu without any omissions after a certain hour which to me is amazing.

All the food servers and the waitresses are incredibly friendly and sweet."}
{"text":"Favorite local spot!  Breakfast, lunch, dinner, late night ... no matter when you stop in, the menu has you covered.  The waitresses are always friendly and attentive.  Favorite dish so far:  breakfast sliders!  :)"}
{"text":"Great times love the atmosphere and happy hour  our server Laura was awesome we had great service. Close to home and still one of my favorite spots .
The food ,atmosphere, and service , was still on point ."}
{"text":"Very fun and social. 
Cajun wrap is so good!! It actually has a kick. 
And the cure burger is so tasty!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Remedy's. It's not always easy to get a seat at the bar, but that's the sign of a good place.
Although we've only been here a few times, our experience has always been positive. The bartenders are nice and make great drinks. Prices are reasonable. Food is really good for bar food.
Many times someone has talked to us - not sure if he's the owner or manager, but he was super friendly every time. I'll be honest, most of the time I just want to be left alone to talk to my wife, but he wasn't intrusive at all. He offered great recommendations, is welcoming and knowledgeable of upcoming events, and once he let us try an order of one of their appetizers, just because he felt like it was their best and he wanted to show it off. That was pretty cool. My \"leave me alone\" policy hasn't changed, but I gladly grant him an exemption."}
{"text":"We have been to this restaurant countless times. Food is always excellent. Service not so much. Today was our third time there in a week and a half and the service is awful. Takes forever to get our order in, food to come out and even get the check. VERY POOR SERVICE."}
{"text":"I used to come here before an exam. Grab a drink to forget about test anxiety, why not? Remedy is right!

I haven't been back since I transferred to a different school until this weekend. I went here to watch the playoffs.

The seats are very comfortable and it feels like home except home doesn't give me bronchitis from cigarette smoke. The crowd is quite odd. You'd expect college kids hanging out but the times I've been here, it's a bunch of people having midlife crisis. There's nothing cute about a 50-year-old showing off her wrinkly midriff wearing sweat pants that say \"JUICY\"...I doubt anything is still juicy at that point.

I like the drinks here. I have 2 go-to drinks: Slippery When Wet (vodka, blueberry and watermelon liqueur and pineapple juice) and Remalicious (vodka, cherry vodka, Creme de banana and Sierra Mist). I don't come here to eat. I drink and call it a day."}
{"text":"If only they had  the pot roast sandwich that was in the menu! Turkey Club and Burger were both solid. Highlight was the sweet potato fries. Excellent service to go along with the great meal. Also reasonably priced. Club sandwich and burger with 2 cokes just under 25 dollars"}
{"text":"Always a great atmosphere, the food is better than most bars and the service is good! Don't forget to try the pretzel bites!"}
{"text":"As far as local neighborhood bars go, Remedy's is my spot. It does not craft a truly unique cocktail or offer a wide selection of specialty beers, but it is the bar everyone in the group could find refuge in.

The food is solid. The seared ahi salad is a light fare for those who are not too hungry. The chicken sandwich with avocado and bacon was the surprise hit. It is a filling sandwich that does not leave you feeling sick. The grilled chicken is a nice option in a world where frying things up is the easy and quick solution. The warm pretzels are too heavily salted and the sauces are nothing special. Save room for the bread pudding, because it is worth it. For less than $5, this giant slab of baked custard goodness is enough to share.

The surprise of the night was how cheap the martinis are. A lemon drop was $7 and an espresso was only $6. They did not taste like rubbing alcohol, so that only added to the astonishment."}
{"text":"This place is a cool place to have drinks and finger foods.  Beer is Cold and Avocado Eggrolls are Awesome!   I    My group of friends like it because it has a nice mix of people, old and young and servers are nice and stay up on the hospitality.  Good Drink, Good Food and Good Prices!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went for breakfast which was good except for part of my meal was wrong but they were willing to fix it.  We had a to-go order for pancakes and we ordered the stack of 3, when we got home there was only 1.  We have eaten here before but not had issues like this before."}
{"text":"I read a few reviews for this place and was surprised that the food isn't hyped up more than it is! This place has amazing bar food! As long as you're not getting some basic chicken strips, Remedy's has some great options. Steaks have been commented on so I'll just confirm that, yes, you can't go wrong with their steaks.

But I want to give a special shout out to their nachos. I'm taking about the Chipotle Chicken Nachos off the \"appetizer\" menu. I'm not entirely sure what they're doing to these nachos to make them so delicious- maybe they're sprinkling cocaine on top? Maybe it's the fact that I'm drunk while consuming them (plausible). My official guess is that whatever chipotle chicken is, it's FIRE!!! Like I said, I'm not a chef so I have no idea what's making them taste so good but definitely order those instead of chicken strips!

The only thing holding me back from giving a full five stars is the service given to non gaming customers. This is a common practice in gaming bars- give the person who could potentially tip you off their $7,500 jackpot more attention than the guy ordering $10 nachos. I get that. But getting another beer is torturous sometimes at this place unless you throw $20 in the machine."}
{"text":"This place is quite nice actually. Went to grab a drink and some dinner and was pleasantly surprised.  Bartenders were attentive and friendly!  Food selection was surprisingly varied.  I've been on this 'eat healthy' kick and was able to get a side salad to start, plain grilled chicken, plain potato, and stemmed broccoli with red roasted peppers and garlic.  Played some video poker while I sat there and they comped our drinks!

They have 3 billiard tables, a ton of tv's, a fireplace, had a jukebox that played the Beastie Boys and lots of bar and non-bar seating."}
{"text":"We came for the 1st time for dinner.  I always thought this place was just a bar - I was wrong!  We loved the décor!  I loved the placemats.  We had two girls servicing our table. The menu was very impressive with a variety.  I loved all the slider choices they had which when I bring my daughter back she will be able to choose from those since there is not a children's menu.  We ordered the pretzels for an appetizer which came with three sauces - LOVED them!  My husband ordered a burger and I ordered a cobb salad and we both were very happy with the taste of the food.  The waitress even took time to go over a rewards program they offer. We will be back again!  EXCELLENT service!  EXCELLENT food!  :)"}
{"text":"I have been frequenting Remedy's for 6 months since I moved to this area! The food is excellent... anything on the menu and the ppl who work here are amiable and efficient! 
My favs are Calli, Christine, Kim, Zak... I doubt if there is actually anyone that doesn't give their all! 
A great local place!"}
{"text":"Great place to visit after a long day. The service is great and very friendly. Bartenders are friendly until it gets later at night. The male crew that comes in late are very slow to serve and generally rude unless your a female. Nicole is a welcome ray of sunshine to the bar ."}
{"text":"When I think of the word Remedy I think of the a resolution to a problem, or a cure to a sickness. Not Large glasses of Ice cold beverages and delicious Burgers or fish tacos. So with that said, this place is definitely the Remedy to at least one thing... The need for a great plate of food and cold drinks. This is definitely more of a locals joint since it does sit pretty far off the beaten path when it comes to those that are coming into town to go hang out in the human fish bowl AKA the strip. A group of friends decided to go out and before heading over to the KISS golf we hit up Remedy's. 

Walking in you come into a dark room and it is like the create your own story situations. Go right you end up in a dining room. Go left and you enter the land of enjoyment... Okay that is quite a bit overboard. When you go left you end up in the bar. This is not your average bar. they offer bar seating, tall table seating around the outside perimeter and more of a living room type setting with comfy chairs and small tables perfect for hanging out with that \"someone\" you would like to have a more intimate conversation with. Okay, again, that may be a little overboard. It is a bar, not a romantic setting so that intimate conversation may have to wait. Overall the decor and atmosphere of this place is nicer than your average bar here in town and in my opinion takes PT's in a fight hands down. 

Now lets talk about the service for a moment, our initial server came to the table to help us and she was great, outspoken and easily adjusted to all the personalities at our table. Now here is where I think they need to rethink the hiring. Our server let us know that she was helping to train a new girl and the new girl is one of the owners friends. That alone should have been a red flag. The \"new Girl\" came to the table with our waters, didn't say one word and set one of the water glasses on the ledge of the 2 tables that had been put together and spilled it everywhere and instead of grabbing a towel or something she looks at all of us and says, \"OMG are you guys already drunk......\" Now, let me start off by saying, if we had been drunk I don't know that I would have appreciated her trying to call someone out like that and second take the blame for your mistake. Once the other waitress came back and apologized we moved on with the meal. Take a second and picture yourself sitting at a bar with your friends and they have some great rock music playing the atmosphere is just right and then the new girl comes to bring you your food and everyone is joking and have a good time and one of the guys at the table makes a comment about the fact that AHA's Take on me just came on the jukebox so he says,\" wow this song sucks\" and the New Server of the establishment you are eating at looks at you and says... \" Whatever\" and turns and walks off. Hmmm, someone new to the service industry?? Unfortunately you wont make it very long in a bar atmosphere with that attitude. Needless to say, the service from all of the other servers was great, they had awesome personalities and were very friendly but the owners friend/new girl is going to need to work on a few things... Okay quite a few things.

The Food was hands down better than the standard bar food I have had around town. The BBQ Burger was awesome and the fish tacos were spot on. I can not say anything negative about the food, especially since the appetizers, meal and drinks were all spot on. Basically to sum up my experience at Remedy's I would say that the food was great, the original server and one other server were awesome and the new girl was a complete downer. I would go back but I would also make sure to sit in another section to hopefully not be served or not served by the server we dealt with."}
{"text":"I wish there were more stars to select for this place. As a bartender I'm very critical of the service I get and this place sets the standard! The pours are great the service is amazing, honestly my favorite bartenders in town! The food is amazing as well as the atmosphere. The owner will put a personal touch on everything for you when he's there by getting behind the bar and checking up on everyone there. If you're looking for a local bar to become a regular this is the place. The machines pay and the experience is great every time."}
{"text":"Initially it was a little slow to get a server, though there was only one other patron on the restaurant sids, but the waitress was just outside the door talking to a patron. They made up for it by being fast with drinks and food, which was delicious. I had Remedy's chicken sandwich, which was very good. Sweet potato fries are worth getting, as well as their jalapeño popper burger."}
{"text":"I so wish there were bars in the area that didn't smell like the inside of a pack of cigarettes.  That said, I do not downgrade this bar on the smokiness since just about every place is the same.

Remedy's has a varied menu that includes burgers, including the hangover burger, mashed potato bites, sandwiches, salads, and many other options.  They have a wide variety of beers but only a few on the adventurous side.  If you gamble at the bar, drinks are comped.

I had a fat tire and a pretzel coated chicken sandwich with fries.  The bar staff is very diligent about keeping your beer filled.  I later switched to an angry orchard because I can't drink much beer these days. The bartenders were friendly as well.

The chicken sandwich lacked any wow factor but was otherwise good.  I really didn't get the pretzel flavor though and I wouldn't order it again.  Still the menu is interesting enough to warrant a return trip to try something new.

They have pool tables in the back! Otherwise the place is bar-dominated with several tv's and some table seating sprinkled around."}
{"text":"Best Chicken Strips in town.  SteveO the owner is the man, always smiling and happy to see everyone.  

The place is laid back and lets you enjoy the game or mingle with people at the bar.

Formula1 is always on at 5 AM!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has really kicked it up a notch. The service is spot on and the food is amazing! The seared ahi salad had just the right amount of dressing to lend incredible flavor without overwhelming! Great chicken sliders with mashed potatoes and gravy and the pretzel bites were nice and warm and soft."}
{"text":"In my opinion, Remedy's is as good as it gets!!  I have gone to both the one on St. Rose in Henderson (which in my opinion, is good, but no where near compares to the service I have gotten at the one on Conestoga in Henderson in the restaurant (not the bar side of the restaurant).  It was bright and cheerful, unlike the darker one on St. Rose.   The waitress, Corinne, greeted us almost as soon as we walked in the door with a friendly smile and hello.  She was very friendly and helpful with description of menu items and our questions.  She brought us our drinks right away, and the food wasn't far behind.  My husband had the IPA Shrimp ($10.95)  which was outstanding, and I had the Beef Tips , ($13.95)  which were a large portion, with some really good mashed potatoes and carrots and asparagus.  Had enough left over for a very generous second meal to take home!  It would seem that most of the reviews I read here were from people in the bar-side.. They might want to give it another try on the restaurant-side?"}
{"text":"Good food, good service. Nice to the locals and great for night shift workers. Surprisingly delicious meats and fresh salads - not just typical \"bar food\". The ahi tuna salad is delicious and if you want a burger, The Cure is phenomenal.

Bumped up to 5 stars after also coming here for breakfast with my kids. Still good service every time, and nothing on the menu has disappointed me yet."}
{"text":"Lunch service was extremely slow even though there weren't many customers.  They also got the order wrong and food had to be remade."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! Alexis is the absolute best!!!! Try ERRYTHING on the new happy hour menu!!! Alexis recommends the lettuce wraps and she is !!!!"}
{"text":"This place is really close to my house.  I've never had anything but awesome service there, and the food is pretty good.

If you join their players club, they will send you deals and offers.  For my birthday they sent me a coupon for $20 cash (that had to be played) and a certificate for an extra $20 if I hit 4 of a kind.  It also included an extra $1000 if I hit a royal, but what are the chances of that?!

There is a pool table, lots of seating (even away from the bar itself), and a seperate, smoke free dining area.  The juke box is great as well.  They could have a better beer selection, but other than that, I like this place for a local hangout."}
{"text":"Time for me to update my review, since I now visit this Rem's pretty often.

My then boyfriend is now my husband, so I live right up the street from Remedy's. It's a convenient location for me. There are some good and bad things about this bar, but overall I enjoy it.

The good:
- the food! It's really good and they offer fantastic nightly dinner specials. I love the chicken pesto pasta and the chicken parm. I've also had decent prime rib here as well. And I am obsessed with their dinner salad - pretty sure their croutons and ranch dressing are laced with crack, because otherwise it's just a spring mix with cucumbers and tomatoes. *shrugs*
- the service! I've always found all of the bartenders to be super friendly. They introduce themselves, learn your name and are really good at remembering what you like to drink.

The bad:
- it's REALLY smoky. I have to shower as soon as I come home and throw my stinky clothes in the laundry. I come home smelling like cigarettes even when nobody around me seems to be smoking.
- they don't offer any local beers on tap. I've mentioned this to the Manager (Steve-O is awesome!) and he's said that \"nobody drinks them.\" This just isn't true - there is a very popular bottle shop nearby where beer nerds regularly meet up to drink. They would totally come here too. I don't run a business, but I can't imagine starting with just 1 local tap would be so much trouble? 

Anyhow, overall it is a pretty cool place. I like that the pool tables are tucked away in the back and out of the way. There is also plenty of seating, and if you don't want to sit in the bar area, the restaurant is smoke free."}
{"text":"Remedy's is a cozy little local bar on St. Rose with leather chairs, couches, booths and a bar. It's a bar, nothing new to really to review here, you can't really f*ck up a draft and a shot of Jack.This review is for their food and Remedy's allegedly contains the \"best\" nachos in the city according to my friend. Needless to say my friend's food card has been temporarily revoked. The chipotle chicken nachos are just alright maybe a C+, actually no a C- because I did not even finish them. The salsa was good and the chicken had a decent spice to it but I felt like I had just ordered bean and cheese on chips. These in no way shape or form are better than going up the street and getting Half Shell's nachos, waaayyy better. On a positive note, the fajitas and the Clam Chowder was actually pretty good, kind of spicy and bacon-y (is that even a word? It is now), pretty delicious, however this doesn't fit in line of my diet consisting of Jack Daniels and nachos. So Remedy's you're only half way on my radar."}
{"text":"It doesn't get much better than this!! Corrine is absolutely amazing! Her service is above and beyond! Loved the music, loved the drinks"}
{"text":"Late night guys here sucks. He wouldn't even come out from behind the bar to see if we needed help my friend had to keep walking up to the bar to get any service at all. And then after they changed shifts the new grave guy yelled my total out to the whole bar. After never introducing himself. Still never came out from behind the bar. The only person that came to our table was the cook to deliver my food. Very nice man by the way and then the bartender didn't even bring me silverware or plates, he just handed it off to the cook. I feel like every time I come here my service gets worse and worse."}
{"text":"Since so many people seem to like this place, we decided to check it out on a Friday evening. Honestly, I have no clue what all the hype is about. We had already had dinner so we opted solely for drinks. 

Although the place was far from packed, we waited a while and finally decided to order from the bar. Not surprisingly, a waitress appeared as soon as we had ordered and seemed annoyed that we went to the bar and didn't order from her. She did bring our drinks out once we had placed our order, but she failed to accurately provide the garnishes we had requested (I asked for a lemon with my gin and soda, and my guy asked for extra limes).

Although there wasn't anything too remarkable about our experience (bad or good), the ambiance coupled with lack of superior service left us feeling pretty meh about the whole experience. It was also pretty smokey inside which is a definite deterrent for me. I will probably not be back to Remedy's anytime soon."}
{"text":"Last time I was in this bar, was on a rainy day and a group of friends all met here because we cancelled work. We drank from 9am to 9pm. 

This time, was after a round of golf on a nice day. It's a nice bar, fairly large, with a section glassed in for the smokers/bar/gambling, and another section for dining. It was pretty full for a Wednesday night at 6pm. No open gaming spots so we just rolled over to the outside table for some grub.

I had the french dip ($10.95) with some sweet potato fries. The sandwich was pretty tasty, although a little small. The table we sat at was a bit unbalanced (as were all the tables) so that needs to be fixed. Almost spilled a beer. I drank a Pyramid Hefeweizen because they don't carry Widmer. That loses a star from me because they don't have good Hefe's available. 

Service was good, friendly, and fast. No issues there. I'll be back because the food is pretty good for bar food and they have a nice mix of people."}
{"text":"This is my first time here and I want to tell you it won't be my last the service here by Marissa was just the best it could be and we are not gamblers but she was so personal and professional , if I owned a restaurant I would steal her !! This place is so lucky to have her , okay enough about that the food was over the top good please treat yourself to the ahi salad with wasabi vinaigrette and you too will be hooked"}
{"text":"Hello!! We had a 50's Glamour themed Oscar Party at Remedy's. I have to say say how wonderful the staff was for our event. They had smiles on their faces the whole time. We had about 55 guests and every guest would come up to me and say how happy they were with the customer service. Then there was the food. Amazing. Every item was fantastic. The food was never cold and there was a lot of options to choose from. We will be back next year!!  This bar did not smell like smoke and it was a perfect ambience. I have to add the restrooms were always clean during our event."}
{"text":"The bar and atmosphere are nice, has a nice lounge area, but the drink and food prices are a bit steep for a stand-alone bar. I have been there a few times due to a friend living in close proximiy to this place, but there isn't really anything going on (happy hour/drink specials) to get you in the door."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! We were staying in Las Vegas and yelped what was good in the area and boom.... we came here on our stay TWICE !!!!"}
{"text":"With free birthday entree in hand, I went with Diane and friends to try out Remedy's.  I had liked the comfort food served at Elixir, which I knew from advertisements was a close sibling.  But right out of the gate the hostess informed me that the menus were different here and at the younger Distill.  \"So much the better.  Let's eat!\" I thought.  And we did!

First up were tasty Mashed Potato Bites filled with a combination of Cheddar, Pepper Jack, and Parmesan Cheeses all fried to a crisp.  Then we enjoyed Pretzel Bites dipped in Cheddar Cheese Sauce, Beer Mustard, and Honey Dijon Mustard.  Fried Mozzarella was lightly breaded and fried crisp on Bruschetta accompanied by a thin Marinara Sauce.  And Seared Ahi Tuna was quite flavorful.  Seared Ahi Tuna rounded out the starters, followed by New England style Clam Chowder that featured a nice mix of lightly spicy cooked clams and potatoes but was too peppery for Diane's sensitive tastes.  

Seared Beef Tenderloin Tips came out medium rare as ordered, along with perfect al dente Carrots and excellent Creamy Mashed Potatoes.  All that was missing were desirable mushrooms to mingle with the meat.

Service was good; seating was comfortable!  It was a fine repast!"}
{"text":"We just left the place we got a great service by Katie.we gad the 2 4 1 dinner coupon she was very cool about it. ..  no like in other places. .lol
My first time in the location she suggests that special of the evening mahi mahi with shrimp mm yummy  .
She  sign us for the loyalty  program... cool 
 will be back....
Thanks ..."}
{"text":"Me and my wife didn't feel like cooking so we came over here to try this place out. It's a bar/restaurant divided in half. They do a pretty good job at separating the two but occasional smoke from the bar slips into the restaurant. The food was good. I had the chicken nachos and my wife had the blue cheese burger. We went for happy hour. $3 wells. Reasonably priced. $26 for two entrees and a well drink. Service wasn't terrible either."}
{"text":"Great local bar with the best managers and bartenders..the cooks never disappoint.  I would recommend Remedys to anyone"}
{"text":"Personally, this location is not as good as the other one on St. Rose Parkway but it's not horrible either. The food chicken fingers are so so but the artichoke dip appetizer is pretty tasty. Generally they are not to busy when I go which is always a plus and they are very close to school. 

Honestly, there is really not much to say about this place other then if your in the area and looking for either a bite to eat or a drink, it's worth stopping in."}
{"text":"Remedy's is your average, down the street, neighboorhood watering hole. Food is consistent (when they are not changing the menu) and the happy hours are well.... Happy? LOL Other then being one of only a handful of bars that I can stumble home from, there is not much else to say.....

Oh..... the evening/swing wait staff here are generally pretty cool and do try and remember what you drink if you come in enough. Granted, I have not been in awhile, so I am not sure if this still holds true."}
{"text":"Meh, I kinda left this joint with a bad taste. Figuratively, that is. My meal was OK, but could've been much better. This was my second time here, and this visit was to join their slot club and redeem a meal reward from their Red Card loyalty program. Service was good at first then got weird. The first bartender who helped me signed me up for the club and got me a beverage. She was nice. The meal started out fine,I had the steak tips with mashed, asparagus and carrots. The sauce was pretty bland and the steak wasn't seasoned. I also had a salad with my meal, which was very good. 

A second bartender asked how my meal was, and I told him the steak isn't seasoned and the carrots are tiny. His response was, that's how our food comes out. That's it. Well, If you don't want to be helpful, why ask?? He also called me Darlin too many times, which was very annoying. I had the same meal a year or so ago at the other Remedy's and the sauce was amazing. Maybe they should add a disclaimer to the menu, That's how our food comes out! as an FYI."}
{"text":"Working down my list of \"places I drive by all the time and should stop by\". 
Their holiday toy drive finally drove me here (I was happy to see an overflowing bin of toys!) and I also signed up for their player's club (it's A Local Bar and a poker bar). 
They are somehow aligned with the 2 Distill locations but have separate player's cards. 

The bartender was helpful in getting me signed up and the bar wasn't smoky- so far so good!
There was some bonus play for signing up I think $10 for earning 20 points? I walked away a winner so I'm a fan! The atmosphere is slightly upscalish and the dining room is separate from the bar. I didn't have the time to try their food but would like to so hopefully I won't drive by another 1,000 times without stopping again!"}
{"text":"Great place to hang out SteveO is awesome and makes you feel very welcomed....been here before and will be back more often. Great music and a great atmosphere. Food was great and the drinks were even better. Good times!"}
{"text":"I eat here 3-4 times a week and never had a bad meal. Today topped them all with South of The Border Chicken! Wow! Great food, Great staff!!"}
{"text":"This is a local neighborhood bar.  Super low key and relax.... the inside is dim and full of tv's for sports watching.  The service is good and the food is tasty, and best of all they have beer and cocktails!"}
{"text":"Chill bar and restaurant. My husband and I were invited here by some of our work friends. They had a nice fire place inside, billiards, a juke box that played mostly county. Our server was alright, we stayed in the billiards area having a few drinks. We yet  have to try the food, but we probably won't get to try the food since there are other bars near our house on the SW, maybe if we get invited again. Other than that, it's a chill bar with mainly locals and that's how I like my bars..locals."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast. Pancakes, eggs, hash browns, sausage, and toast. Overall pretty weak.

The pancakes were tough and dense, eggs were cold, sausage was generic grocery store patties. The hash browns weren't bad, a little too greasy and not crisp enough, but not terrible. The toast was fantastic though! 

The atmosphere isn't bad, the staff was friendly enough. 2 1/2 stars overall."}
{"text":"I would probably give it more, but the service was very slow & the food was only okay.  Came in at 10 am & 2 hours later, we are still here, granted there's very few people around.  Good thing our server was nice.   I just don't understand why  the food took forever & the server keeps disappearing.  

Came back on March 13th!  Let me say that our experience tonight was absolutely great!! Stevo & Jeri were so amazing on taking care of me & the hubby! I will definitely will be back & will bring friends & families over to enjoy the Remedy's food & experience. 

Thanks Amy, the Marketing Director for making this possible!  Thank you for the staff @ the Remedy's tonight!!! 

Two Thumbs Up!!!"}
{"text":"Walked in to meet some friends. They had already ate and closed out their bill. The bartender refused to serve my friends and me that came in after the first group of us. We setup tables and it took a while for a waitress to come to us. We went back to the bar and ask to order food and the bartender walks away as soon as I get there. No acknowledgement or anything. She comes back after a few minutes and says she'll send out a waitress. The first one comes and takes our order. Then we get a new waitress. The first group packs up and leaves and the the new waitress closes out our second group without asking if we were even ready to. Didn't get offered a bag for our many food boxes. I've been to this establishment many times, I have never experienced this lack of service in my time there. It was piss poor to say the least."}
{"text":"Ordered food Togo, a couple appetizers to share and the nachos had no beans and hardly any cheese (we ordered no chicken on them didn't mean no beans too!) Not too happy, hopefully they don't skimp on every to go order they receive. :/"}
{"text":"I had my best 1st date here on a Sunday evening.  $5 Happy Hour wine was amazing.  It was very decent and drinkable.  Our waitress was so attentive and was constantly asking if we needed anything.  We sat on the couch which made the date more intimate. The lighting was dim and perfect.  Coming from LA,  I'm not use to indoor smoking but this place was not overwhelmed with that typical smoke stank.  Overall,  it was a very pleasant place w great ambiance.  My go to 1st date place for sure."}
{"text":"Ok, now that I figured this Yelp crap out.
It was refreshing to come back to my home bar again! Thank you Tambra so very much! Spent my day on the boat and at the marina just to finish my afternoon at good old Remidys...
Again Tambra, thank as Always..."}
{"text":"A great local place with yummy food and a good atmosphere. The service for drinks is really good, but sometimes getting the check can take a bit. It's setup really well, too, with comfy lounge chairs near a fire place, a closed space with some tables for families, highboys, and a fairly large pool area. I really dig this place."}
{"text":"I worked down the street from this place for years and never went in because in general, video poker taverns in this town offer unimaginative and subpar fare.  For some reason I decided to give Remedy's a try, and I'm glad I did.  For a video poker tavern, the food is really tasty and reasonably priced.  They also have a customer loyalty card (called the 'RED' card) which is very generous about redeeming points for free food.  Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Calamari straws are top notch! The mango chutney has slight notes of curry and cumin. The onion rings are homemade and are coated in a magically crispy fluffy batter. The brisket grilled cheese I had wasn't soggy even though the brisket was overflowing with braising juices.  the portions are extremely generous, so if you're getting an appetizer, I guarantee you're not going to finish your food. Don't forget to sign up for their rewards program so you can get free stuff down the line."}
