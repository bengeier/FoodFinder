{"text":"I love this place.  Their delivery is super quick and always by a smiling face; They provide excellent customer service, and are very accommodating.  Their soup is probably my favorite part; they have tons of options daily, and they're noticeably homemade (which is of utmost importance).  Their hot sandwiches are awesome.  Particularly I love the pot roast sandwich meal, and the sloppy joes (their Monday special).  (Sometimes you just need some good down home cookin'!)  Their chicken salad and egg salad is also worth craving.  Cranberry Creek has specials daily, and a calendar menu on their website so you can monitor what they're featuring daily.  All in all.. I'd suggest checking this place out, or ordering in on a dreary day. :)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.   When you walk in, the layout is a little unconventional. It's setup almost like a deli with a salad bar in the center. I was confused for about 10 seconds until the staff greeted me!   The staff is unbelievably friendly. They answered all of my questions and were very accommodating.   The breakfast is delicious (and cheap!). I got a simple breakfast sandwich and it honestly made my day better. Went back for a late lunch, if you guess the weight of your salad, it's FREE!  This is a hidden gem - behind Colectivo on the square - that I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I can get here (about a block away), get my food, and get back to my desk in 10-15 minutes even when the place is totally packed full.  Wonderful variety of food (specials, rotisserie chicken, soups, sandwiches, salad bars, pastries, and different hot casserole-type dishes every day), it's fully staffed by awesome people so the line moves really fast.    And if nothing else, I'm honestly impressed by their service.  Once they accidentally messed up my order, and insisted on giving me a free cookie even after I told them it wasn't a problem and I didn't mind waiting at all.    This is one of the best places to get lunch around the square if you work near here."}
{"text":"Be warned, the Mexican themed catered lunch featured chicken which was old, included skin, bones and was devoid of flavor.  The tortillas had a past due use-by date."}
{"text":"A co-worker told me how great their Thursday's Special cheese burger (on a pretzel bun) was, so I tried it and...WOW. I really think it's one of the best kept secret burgers in Madison, if not one of the best.  The burger tastes fresh, the patty is moist and the pretzel bun is perfectly soft.  They got proportions right.  Note that the burger only comes with the patty, meat, cheese, and grilled onions and you can add mayo/ketchup/mustard to it.  The workers are good people and treat their customers well.  Last week I ordered a rotisserie chicken meal which came with a small side of salad.  Not knowing that it was supposed to be a small side, I filled up half of my to-go box with salad and while both workers knew I wasn't supposed to fill it way up, they didn't say anything to make me feel bad about it. Great people (of course i won't do it again)!  Back to the burger, I've tried many top rated burgers in Madison: Old Fashioned, Babes, Tony Franks, Weary Travelor, Nitty Gritty, Dotty Dumplings, DLUX, Great Dane, Granite City, and this one is highly recommended."}
{"text":"I did enjoy going here.  This location is now closed.  The other location in Monona, the full cafe and catering is still open.  I use their catering services regularly.  Do a great job!"}
{"text":"When I think Mexican food, I think of flavors, spices and authenticity. But what I experienced today was far from it. Today I had and poorly executed American version of an Enchiladas and rice from the Cranberry Creek take out restaurant on Main St downtown Madison WI. This dish had no flavor, taste, appeal and no love. The soggy tortilla stuffed with unseasoned ground beef and stewed tomatoes topped with bulk can enchilada sauce and cheese just blew me. The last component of this dish was the uncooked rice. The rice was blanched and hard as bird seed.  I sometime will go to Cranberry Creek because of their prices compared to other downtown locations for lunch. For example entr√©e at Cranberry Creek $6-$7, a food cart $8-10, restaurant $10-14.  I have a strong love for great food and will often venture off and try just about anything, I will never take another risk on Cranberry Creek again.  Beside the Salad Bar, I will never eat another hot dish from this restaurant again."}
{"text":"So I walked by this place quite a few times, but I never got the chance to check it out until today. I was craving some soup, and I recalled seeing a menu for soup on the door once. When I walked in, I didn't quite know where to bring my attention because it didn't have a typical store feel and seemed almost like a small deli. It has two sets of counter space, one on the right and one in the back.   The soup section was located in the back, the menu was a bit scattered, with little signs in front of the product as shown in the attached pictures. The guy behind the counter was nice to tell me what the four different soup options they had available and also the sizes that it comes in. Prices are also not explicitly stated but a bowl is around $3.49 or so, and then the half quart is about double that, and then the quart is about $10+ which is what I believe the store clerk said; although a signage for the price would definitely be helpful.  I also grabbed a bag of chips for $.95 and then when I was checking out, I asked if card was accepted cause I know the patrons ahead of me (who seem like regulars) paid in cash. My total came out to $4.96, which isn't too bad but the bowl of soup was kind of small and the White Chicken Chili tasted okay, not amazing but still edible. The cashier was also nice to give me two small crackers and that went well with the soup.   Overall, I'd say this place might be worth checking out again, and maybe trying some of its other hot foods. I know they advertise breakfast options, so I'd like to see if those are any better."}
{"text":"I love Cranberry Creek. At my work, we cater from them often, and they never disappoint. Always on time, always providing top-notch service. The guys who delivery the food make it a point to have everything set up very nicely. They are very friendly as well. I needed to make a change to an order once that was pretty last minute -- it was no problem at all and they were more than accommodating. Definitely recommend for catering!"}
