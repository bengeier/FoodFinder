{"text":"First went here for dessert and drinks with the girls.  The black cherry sangria is fabulous!  And the desserts were delicious too!  The full menu looked good so came back with my husband for dinner.  Entrees are expensive, but the portions are large and the food was great.  Everything was cooked perfectly (we had the grilled calamari, seafood linguini with lobster, scallops, shrimp, and mussels, and the lamb shank.)  My husband was pleased with the selection of local beers."}
{"text":"The mushroom soup was very good! A bit spicy but thats a good thing. The water was fine too...why nobody has pepsi max? or cola zero??? ah??? only diet... :) The place was clean and cozy. Like. Now comes the bad part...I'm not mean...really..i'm not! But the simple task of preparing chicken wings took 40 minutes...the result was DRY. VERY DRY... shall i repeat it? again? The waitresses were busy to collect plates from our table...it's ruuuuuuude!!! especially when there is food on the plates. I felt like on battlefield and i had to finish my food before the next bombing... its seems like they urged us to leave. They did it to all the customers. I actually had to take things into my own hands and ask her to leave my plate alone...both of them...well. Oh. The pasta was delicious!!! Was this review helpful? Yes | No"}
{"text":"This joint has gone through a number of changes/branding and is now called Gourmet Bistro. Change in ownership again? I have no idea.  I work directly across the street from this place and we (my associates) often phone in a lunch order for pick up, usually once a week. The food is a bit above average but the quality comes and goes but it is pricey.  So here's the thing... Today we placed a phone order and clearly told them that we would be paying individually for 4 separate meals.We always advise them of this in advance.   My co-worker and I arrived and had cash for each order. The server advised us that the next time we call in that we must ask for the total of each order and be prepared to bring the exact amount of cash for each because if the restaurant was busy, she wouldn't be able to deal with us.  I asked  her if most customers pay with debit or Visa or if were they short of cash at the register. No, she said, we have change for our dining in customers only.   I asked what the difference was, if we had been dining in and each paid cash she would have to come up with the same change.   Management please take notice!!!! You have a complete idiot working for you, she is driving away customers.  After today, we are completely done with Grains, GBistro, Gourmet Bistro or whatever you are called.  There is a TD bank 200 feet across the parking lot and it is hard to believe that giving change is such a struggle.This server is the only one that has ever given us a hassle, the rest of the staff are wonderful!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy this restaurant is in my neighbourhood - my husband and I usually dine in or get take out a few times a month. AMAZING food and great atmosphere. I always end up loving whatever I order from the menu. My recommendations: blackened barramundi (actually, anything fish from here is really good), mushroom soup, salads, and the daily specials are also usually pretty good.  Kylie, Christine and the rest of the staff are amazing. :)"}
{"text":"I like to go on Yelp find a recommended restaurant and write a review after woods which will justify what I have read  The restaurant agrees with the rating  We started with Lobster brisk which was amazing and the taste of it will bring me back here and we took main course of an hamburger each, which came on large brioche roll with an excellent side of Greek salad.  My spouse would prefer her meet a bit more well done  On the menu you can find gourmet offering with prices for all budgets - definitely will come back to check them out."}
{"text":"First of all this place is not $$ but more like $$$ instead. Check the menu for prices.   In summary the food is extremely oversalted. And the presentation and quality does not match the price. Ambiance and service compare to something like a pickle barrel.   1. Appetizer:   My girlfriend and I ordered Lobster Bisque and Ahi tuna to share. Lobster Bisque had large chunks of lobster (big plus), however the broth was too salty. Tuna was as is expected - fresh and good tasting; however it arrived on a bed of very salty slaw (which was unwelcome). Overall appetizers were our favorite part of the meal.   2. Main:   I ordered '12oz Chicago Ribeye' and asked for it to be done medium rare. The steak was nowhere near close to 12oz. It was 8oz at best. The cut was very thin, maybe 1.5 cm tops which meant my steak was medium well done (its pretty difficult to cook 1.5cm thick piece of meat medium rare). The presentation was pretty horrible considering it was almost a 40 dollar dish. The dish was once again extremely salty.   My girlfriend ordered Salmon with Black Tiger shrimp. The shrimp was regular jumbo shrimp and NOT Black Tiger shrimp. The salmon looked like a generic piece you would buy at No Frills. The waitress asked how  salmon should be cooked; my girlfriend asked for medium rare and ended up getting a very well done almost dry piece. The level of salt in this dish was actually tolerable.   3. Desert. We got pistachio cheesecake to share. The cheesecake was fine.   Overall I cannot give this restaurant more than one star considering the price of this place. For the same amount you can actually get some fantastic fine dining experiences if you are willing to drive into the core of Toronto (Franks kitchen, Morton's, Jacobs...).   I am honestly baffled at how this can be a 'local gem', unless the neighborhood really does not have anything else. A neighborhood Keg is a much much better value."}
{"text":"Service is great.  Food is super from salads to their specials. I highly recommend their Lobster bisque and the ahi tuna salad.  Both are a must try if you ever go to the restaurant.  We often go for work functions to the restaurant and never come back unhappy."}
{"text":"Was in this place 2 years ago and was very happy. Then I visited last summer and kind of got disappointed in service. Today we decided to go with my husband for dinner somewhere close to home and sit on the patio. I really liked their lobster bisque before. Today it was horrible, I don't know, maybe their cook changed. It tasted like a river. Fried calamari were soggy, I'm glad we didn't order our main dishes. I asked for bread and we never received it, ate our bisque and left. Will never come back. Overpriced food for what they serve this days. We went to another restaurant after to have main course."}
{"text":"Came here for Savour York region menu. I'm pretty excited to find this place as it has potential for future brunch outing with the girls or casual dinner out,without going downtown. Service was friendly and attentive. They were able to accommodate my baby and stroller- bonus pts for that! Now for the food: Lobster bisque- flavorful but did not like the imitation crab meat used. Smoke salmon cream cheese spring roll- didn't like it.  Fillet mignon and lobster crab cake- meat was done exactly as ordered. Tasted good. Veal chop- also cooked to specification and was tender and flavorful. Vanilla creme brûlée- dessert was disappointing. It came in a tiny little dish and it wasn't even \"Madagascar vanilla bean\" as stated on menu.  it was some kind of chocolate coffee cream. Probably one of the worst brûlée I've had. Dessert was like an after thought to the menu. I would give food 3 stars because the meat was really nicely done. But apps and dessert were a miss. Service and ambience 4 stars. Friendly service, great ambience, comfortable."}
{"text":"Classic Bistro food with a twist The Calamari was outstanding! I have never liked Calamari due to the \"chewiness\" that you get with it. These were completely different. Soft, supple and amazingly delicious. We had the Sliders along with the Pepper Fries and it didn't disappoint. If you're in the area, swing by, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love coming here. Its our go to when we don't want to go home but want to eat some delicious food.   Thoroughly enjoyed their taste if York region menu selection for the past two years!  One of the best brunches I've ever had except I was disappointed when they didn't have the brunch menu available on mothers day! I love love love their brunch, so much now i'm craving the French toast.I love it! In the winter its nice having brunch by the fireplace.  Patio is nice a little noisy cause its on the road. But there's some shrubs to help with the ugly view. Its a nice patio and I enjoy being on it in a Sunday afternoon eating the lobster nachos and a Manhattan.   The service is good but I don't really like some of the staff that works on Saturday nights. I understand its busy but your job is to be hospitable, I don't like to feel rushed  if I'm asking for recommendations and one waitress in particular made me feel so uncomfortable. But the others are great! On my birthday one of the girls took a picture of us pretending we were part of the mural! I love it."}
{"text":"I'm sure most people would agree there are many things that make a great dinner experience. Things that are completely non-food related.  One I feel is particularly important and that is company, those who share the dining experience with you.   Thursday I was fortunate to be invited to one of the Yelp Eats for Hunger Relief dinners which took place at G Bistro. Our group was small with only four people, including two yelpers I was meeting for the first time. I always get excited to meet new people because most of the time it involves food. I love eating and the best way to meet new people is to do it over food. After all, who doesn't like to eat? Differences aside, when it comes to eating and drinking, we all do it.  As someone who will try any kind of food I sometimes struggle when trying new places especially when they have extensive menus. This menu was not at all extensive, but still managed to offer a wide range of choices that would satisfy even picky eaters (poor souls!).   While the appetizer choices were minimal they provided something for everyone, basic items like chicken wings or more creative like duck spring rolls. Our table chose both a grilled calamari and a calamari fritti for our appetizers which came with a side of complimentary olive bread. Jack pot!!   The calamari was nice and tender (which is always a make or break for seafood). Both dishes were very different from one another, the fritti came with a side of chipotle mayo and the grilled with a tomato olive sauce.  Between the two, I recommend the grilled calamari for its bright flavor and because I am a huge fan of olives.   When the entrees came we treated the meal as \"family style\" allowing everyone to try every entrée, obviously except the burger...we all have our limits! I loved this idea; I get to try a bit of everything without the risk of an evil look as I pick off someone else's plate.    I was happy to see that the portions were not overwhelming, cause let's face it if it's on my plate I'm eating it! The pork chop came in a generous portion beautifully smoked with a touch of sweetness and complimented with a small side of sweet potato gnocchi. A huge hit.   The mushroom risotto had a nice creamy texture, not overly heavy and did not taste or look like mushroom soup, which it sometimes does.   On a side note: I have always been extremely impressed with anyone who can cook risotto perfectly. I'm scared to even try as I couldn't help but overhear Gordon Ramsay voice in my head shouting \"You Donkey!!\" if I were to fail and I likely would. I'm happy to say that Gordon would have been impressed by this risotto.   Ok, I digress....  The salmon came on a bed of arugula; of course, salmon is worthy of much more then basic greens. The fish was cooked very well, with a hint of spice, nice and tender inside and crispy outside. Texture is important for me so I'm always happy when the fish comes with crispy skin. Of course cause its edible too. Waste not!  As for the service they were very attentive and keen to offer suggestions without being overbearing. The atmosphere is relaxing and comfortable while still remaining elegant. All of us agreed that the space would be perfect for engagement parties, work events, first dates and, more importantly, future Yelp events.   Personally, what made the overall experience was not only the joy of food and meeting new people but dining with others who weren't there to JUST EAT but to enjoy and experience it.    Food is one of the best pleasures in life and is even better in the presence of good company. I mean really, who wants to drink a glass of wine and eat calamari alone? Not me!  Since I still want to try half of the menu, I will return to G Bistro again and will most definitely recommend it to friends and fellow yelpers. Beyond the great service, atmosphere and the excellent food, G Bistro shows great support in both the Yelp and surrounding communities.  So, for all of the yelpers out there, show some love back!  And never eat alone. I'm always hungry and you know where to find me.  Cheers,  Tiff"}
{"text":"Visiting G Bistro was a long time coming. Previously called Grains Bistro they re-branded and re-decorated a while back to produce this slice of Bistro heaven near the corner of Dufferin and Langstaff in Thornhill.   A small group of us visited GB for a dinner during Yelp Eats this past week. Walking inside after only previously coming in for a pint, I was still astounded by how beautiful this place is laid out and decorated. Long ornate bar takes up center stage here and is an amazing focal point. Book-ended by a warm lounge area with fireplace and a semi private dining space enveloped by long white curtains.  Enough on decor, lets get to the meal. Our cozy group of 4 decided on a little experiment with the appetizer: Grilled or fried. While both stood up well on their own, the consensus that the putanesca style grilled calamari won out by a long shot. The fried was still good served with it's chipotle style dipping sauce BUT the ability to dip the complementary slices of olive bread into the cornucopia of sauce the grilled calamari was served in was what put the dish over the top!  Moving on from the apps I didn't think things could get much better - enter the hickory smoked pork chop. They have an in house smoker and once grilled and cooked to a perfect medium, the flavour was warm, smokey and I'm pretty sure it was one of the greatest pork chops I've eaten. The only place this dish faltered for a second was the side of butternut squash gnocchi. While the butter sauce it was lightly coated in was delicious I did find the gnocchi a tad heavy and firm for my picky italian taste but that didn't stop me from finishing every bite of it and the rappini it came with.  Being a family style Yelp dinner, we all shared a little of our meals with each other and I had the amazing pleasure of trying their mushroom risotto and the salmon with arugula salad. Both amazing and both considerations for future visits."}
{"text":"This place is close to my work so we go there often and each time I have never been disappointed. The staff is quick to seat you and friendly!  The food is consistently good - I have practically tried everything on the menu but my favourite are the thai soup and the lobster nacho - be warned the nachos are HUGE!!!  The place and ambiance are perfect for a lunch time run and they have a patio which I did not experience yet. The parking out front is a bit of a pain and the price point is appropriate for what you get.  Would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I'm really surprised at how disappointing this experience was as I've been going to this place for years and it has been one of my favourite spots. Well today was the first time that I had a pre planned lunch that I booked several months in advance. When I called around March to make the reservation I booked a table for 8 for May 14 at noon. My reservation was taken without any questions or concerns. About a week prior to the event I have received a call from the restaurant confirming the reservation and telling me that since the day falls on Mother's Day they have a special pre set $55 menu. I appreciated the heads up but also felt that it was being sold to me a bit too eagerly so I asked if we can still order from the regular menu. Initially I was told that no (even though it wasn't mentioned until I asked!) but when I mentioned that when I placed the original reservation it was never mentioned they have agreed to offer both a la carte and the pre set options. I appreciated the ease with which this was handled and thought that was the end of it. I have received FOUR more calls from the place to confirm the amount of people coming several times and to ask me to make sure that my guests show up right on time as Mother's Day is busy and they would like to ensure a \"smooth flow of guests\". The calls were getting ridiculous interrupting me during work and family dinners... I was already not in the best mood coming in today but remembered how much I liked this place food and service wise and brushed it off to poor customer service skills on the end of the one person who kept calling.  Unfortunately my bad experience didn't end here. Upon arrival to the restaurant I was not greeted with a hello but pointed to where my party was without as much as a head nod... When we started ordering the food some of my guests were excited to order from the pre set menu as it was provided to me in advance and I shared it with everyone. The menu was changed and when my friend inquired about the crab cakes she was told they don't serve crab cakes. When she said but they were in the menu she got a very rude \"well I'm telling you there are no crab cakes!\" from the server. No apology or explanation. Small things like forgetting to take a drink order from myself while all others were served without as much as an apology and an overall attitude on behalf of our server did not add to a great experience. Dishes were described incorrectly so my guests ordered a pasta with a rose sauce that came with no sauce at all and another got frozen shrimp in her pasta. Oh and did I mention that the restaurant was half empty the whole time that we were there? We were told that we could choose to sit on the patio but won't be able to go back inside if it starts raining... so we stayed in. The restaurant never filled up.  I'm extremely disappointed by gourmet bistro as I've known this place for years to have amazing food and excellent service. The one time that I decide to take it a step further an have a small get together there it all comes crumbling down. I highly doubt that I will be back."}
{"text":"Went back to this restaurant a year later and want to update on my experience... this time the dinner was far from impressive. Food was only OK, I've had better. The decor and ambiance are no longer 'romantic' rather it now feels like a cafeteria.  I was very disappointed with this as I took my family there for a b-day celebration and upon entering the restaurant it made us feel like we are at a pickle barrel or something instead of a fine dining restaurant.  The appetizers were good however. The main course, Steak, that I had was only OK, my guest had the tuna dish for main and didn't like it. I had the tuna last year and it was very good. The lamb dish was just a stew and it was only OK. Last year I had the lamb with the bone in and it was delicious, nothing like this time around. The live music they had was a woman singing and playing guitar - it was like a cat screeching, very annoying!  I don't know what happened with this place but my initial good impression is gone and I don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"Really enjoy going to this restaurant.  In the summer there is a really nice patio which is a rarity in this area. The food is always on point. We love the roasted beet salad. Their seafood linguine is great,  the lamb shank is one of my go to favorites in winter. Staff are friendly and service is great. We even booked part of the restaurant out in celebration for a special occasion. We arranged a specific menu for the night. Everyone was happy with their meal."}
{"text":"Location: 8707 Dufferin Street (Vaughan) & Summer Ridge Drive (in the same plaza as a TD bank) Price: $$ Service: Thumbs Up  So, after driving by this place multiple times and hearing good things about this restaurant. I thought it was time to give it a try. The decor inside made the Bistro feel very romantic and nice. I went with a group of friends and we all thought it would be nice to have a date there (teehee). It is family friendly- they also have a small menu for children as well. It was weird when you walked in because on the looks of the outside of the Bistro you wouldn't think how fancy it looks on the inside (don't judge a books by it's covers...)  Our server was friendly and she came to check up on us often- which was great. The server was a great help and offered a lot of advice on the Bistro's specialty. While we were deciding on what to get they gave us a plate of olive bread and dip. I am not the biggest fan or even a fan of olives overall but the bread was delightful.   As for the main entree, I personally got a House Steak special and I got fries to go with that, instead of their house mashed potatoes topped with some kind of mushrooms/sauce. One thing about me is that I am a fries FANATIC! Hands down in love with a place that have amazing fries. Their fries were alright since it was not as crispy or tasty, therefore it was more on the blander side but the dipping sauce was really good. It was like a cross from tartar sauce and chipotle (or maybe it was just chipotle and I'm insane). On to the steak... I love my steak rare or medium rare and to be quite honestly a lot of places don't make it right. Lucky, at G Bistro they made a good medium rare steak- not as juicy as I liked it to be but it a A-OK for a pretty good medium rare steak. The dish also came with salad (arugula and I think it was a balsamic vinaigrette for dressing) .   My friends had; Chilean Ancho Glazed Salmon, Moroccan Braised Lamb Shank, Burger, and Chicken Wrap. They all seemed to enjoy with entrees. We also got a deep fried cheese cake. I'm not a fan of cheese cake but this one was good.   Highly recommended =]"}
{"text":"The several changes in signage is an unfortunate difficulty in finding themselves, but the final results have all been worth it.  The menu is diverse and I have yet to be disappointed.  A couple weeks ago I tried the Seafood Linguine and have had it twice more since, the roast corn addition to the dish is a welcome sweetness."}
{"text":"Great food, service and atmosphere. Food tastes great, well portioned and cooked fast. This is a nice little neighbourhood gem. The restaurant is great for romantic dates and for large and small family gatherings. The only complaint is the heavily scented entry way, which is nauseating."}
{"text":"I'm rating it at 4 stars, not because of the food, but because of the service - we got anything and everything we could think of, and the server kept surprising us with thoughtfulness. We then discovered that the place had closed an hour prior to us wondering about more food, and yet nobody has even hinted it is time to leave - that's customer service with a capital S.  The food part itself is questionable, to an extent - the appetizers were excellent, but I felt like my steak and seafood weren't much to write home about - it certainly did not taste like it's price.  At the same time, we had a blast, and with summer at the door, their patio is a winner - I've been there before, when the place was under different ownership.  So, will definitely repeat, giving a chance to other dishes, and failing that, enjoying a cold beer on the patio."}
{"text":"The placed is bluntly overpriced for the insulting tiny portions served. \"Seafood Mix\" with two (!) shrimps, two calamaris (!) , some tiny pieces of other ingredients, plus cheap pasta to make the tiny dish look half decent. All for \"just\" $30 per Entree. Also, two of the menu items we initially chose were \"not available\". No reason provided. Service was also anemic and disappointing. We are not picky eaters and are willing to spend for fine eating but this place was a big disappointment. As it was almost empty in what may be considered peak time for a restaurant (Fri evening), it looks we are not the only people with this experience. Don't bother."}
{"text":"Everything I ordered was absolutely divine: fresh carrot ginger soup de jour which came with three artisan raisin croûtons but I swerved that bread #dietlife, chicken in a nice light marsala sauce (hold the potatoes and add extra veg if you're low-carbing!), and ending the fab dinner with a liquer that seconds as a digestif, amaro de Monténégro. Lights turn down a little for dinner service which complements the sexy lounge decor just right and sets the mood for intimate memories...and GOOD FOOD! Going back for that lobster bisque and the cheesecake (mission accepted!)."}
{"text":"What a lovely place! Good food, excellent service and romantic ambience. Lobster bisque was delicious, and so was the steak. We also enjoyed organic sparkling lemonade with bourbon. Delicious!  I also have to mention that service was top notch. Our server was very nice  and attentive, and tried to make our night out special. Overall we had a great time and will definitely return!"}
{"text":"It was a very strange experience at this resturant the menue that was given to us totally different from what you see online!!!very limited food choice on top of that they were out of half of menue like calamari on saturday 7 p.m !!!!!!!there in no complimentry bread and no menue for drink very basic!!!!!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, good service, nice wine selection, and most importantly, good food. Went to dinner with my wife, kids and in laws. Everyone enjoyed their food. Our waitress was lovely. Will definitely return. Btw... The chocolate lava cake was fantastic."}
{"text":"I am usually not a pub fan because the food is often average at best.  However, I was pleasantly surprised by the food at G Bistro.  G Bistro is pub 2.0, updated and revised.  The food is g-o-o-d and reasonably priced.  We had mostly appetizers and finger food that evening.  We had sliders, chicken nuggets and fries and some drinks.  Sliders were juicy and tingly; chicken nuggets were soft, salty with hint of pepper and not dry at all. The fries were good, had a light crunch when bitten and mushy inside.    G Bistro is a nice pub that I feel fine to not only have finger food but have dinner.  It does not hurt that the interior decor is contemporary and relaxing.  I will return.  Overall, 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Saw this restaurant on a TV show \"Eat Here - York Region\" It looked good on TV so decided to give this place a try.  Wanted to get the lamb shank but the waiter crushed my dreams when he said they were out of lamb shank. (Feet stomping on the ground in disappointment)  Complementary bread to start off. Comes with butter, vinegar and olive oil. There was a regular white bread and also a bread that was made with alcohol.  Lobster bisque $8 - decent portions with a good amount of lobster meat. Soup tasted amazing. This was a great start to the meal. I was tempted to order another one it was so good.  Calamari Fritti $15 - tasted really fresh. A nice layer of batter that gave it that crunch and crispiness. Another good start to the meal.  Seafood Linguine $26 - The best part of this dish were the shrimps. They were large and fresh. Not overly cooked so it had a nice bite to it. There were also mussels and scallops which were okay.  Lamb Bolognese $24 - minced lamb meat tasted good. Found there was too much oil in this dish.  Penne with scallops $26 - I liked the sauce they used for this dish and it went well with the penne pasta. There were 5 small scallops that came with it. The only reason I would say these are small scallops because I am comparing it to the scallops I had at Novita Italian Cuisine which were super large. I would rather get 2 large scallops rather than 5 little scallops.  There were some hits and misses but overall a very good restaurant. A bit pricy though."}
{"text":"I have been to several iterations of this restaurant over the years. Not a regular because I have found them inconsistent around allergies.  Tonight allergies were not a concern and I wanted something healthy and a little nicer. We both had salads with water and tip in, $70. I wasn't paying enough attention when I ordered the steak salad as for some reason I thought it was $19, but it was actually $29. My mistake. Some of the prices are okay but a bunch of prices feel out of line.  Best part of the experience was the baby bunny on the way out. Lots of bunnies in the Woods. :)"}
{"text":"Local gem.  New menu with lots of fresh options.  Love the fact that most fish is wild or organic.   Considered a local gem for most in ththe area.   One of the best patios in the area as well."}
{"text":"Loved it everytime i went. Can't resist their fresh oysters,  and the fresh tasting wine sauce that came with it.   Pistachio cheese cake is a fresh,  light dessert that is a very good bargain.  Be sure to ask for daily specials.  Loved their Porter House Steak - bloody,  juicy and flavorful.  Always well-prepared, adequately seasoned and skillfully presented.  Excellent place to hangout for an hour or two with superb service and little noise and disruptions.  Can't miss their Tawse Reisling.  They have a fireplace and a patio too."}
{"text":"G Bistro has a great menu, both for lunch and dinner. Great place for parties or small groups. Service is good, people are friendly. If you like lamb and your craving a burger, you got to try their Lamb Burger, so delicious. Another favourite is their lobster bisque soup. No matter what you order you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've come here for lunch a few times now, and it's just not worth my time/money.  There's nothing fundamentally wrong with this place - my main issue is what you're getting/ versus what you pay.   The price point is on par with Eagle's Nest just north, except it's not the same experience or quality at all. A salmon salad at lunch will set you back 30ish, which to me, just doesn't make any sense for a restaurant that's drab, dingy, empty and the food isn't really gourmet at all."}
{"text":"Ive been here on a few occasions. Food is very good, friendly service and their daily specials are great!! I have found my favorite place (Strangely enough) for their take on Butter Chicken. Generous portions. Great Patio for the Summer. Highly recommend this little gem!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem in Thornhill! Went here with the family and was pleasantly surprised by everything - food, drinks, and great service.  Started things off with their house lager - a solid, if not simple and easy drinking brew. Then started with 1/2 dozen oysters. They come with raw horse radish, lemon, hot sauce and shallot vinegar. They were decent Malpeques!   For the main course, I highly recommend the Tuscan Lamb Shank. It was a massive hunk of meat, that fell off the bone and melted in the mouth. Delicious and I would definitely order it again!"}
{"text":"Scanning at all the restaurants that participating in the Savour York Region this year, I couldn't stop yawning... All these Italian restaurants serving similar items.. how many Cesar Salad can I eat?? Veal Marsala again?! $35 for dinner?? Until Grain's Bistro Menu caught my eyes!!  OK! The price helps a LOT $25 for prix fixe dinner?! Interesting Menu Selection? No more pasta!! Yes I am IN! The good thing  that Linguine Frutti  Di Mare is in the main menu just in case my boyfriend just want his usual!  Grains Bistro decor is chic, modern and minimalist. The bar area has a sport bar feel with big TV and there are also 2 others dining area that can be curtain off.  My Choice which is also the waiter's recommendation: -Seared Ahi Tuna and Asian Slaw - Moroccan Braised Lamb Shank served with Garlic Mush and Veggie - Chocolate Torte  My dinner mate's choice: - Golden Beet and Arugula Salad with Buffalo Mozzarella - Creole Jambalaya (French Quarter Style Jambalaya with PEI Mussels, Shrimps, Clams, Langostino Lobster, Chicken, Andouille Sausage in a Spicy Creole Sauce) - White Chocolate Vanilla Bean Mousse  I love all my choices!! The seared tuna was so heavenly!! Lamb Shank soft and tender, and chocolate torte was served warm!  As usual, other people food are always better?? My dinner mate started looking at mine!!! And when he started to make excuses of  - I don't eat Golden Beet?! What is Golden Beet? Your Tuna looked better - Spicy Sauce for the Jambalaya is too spicy!! I think you would love that... - White Chocolate Vanilla Bean Mousse? I don't like White Chocolate...  So switch... My waiter got a little confused....  Special mention is all our food were served piping hot and fresh! I guess it helped when we were the only table just one hour before closing!  I definitely be coming back again!! Especially on Saturday when Grain's Bistro has Live Jazz Performance!!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent but service was quite disappointing. Not even got a glass of water until we asked for it."}
{"text":"G Bistro is a little hard to see from the road and looks fairly small from the outside, but once you step inside the place looks great. Nice decor. It's unfortunate that there aren't as many patrons on a Wednesday night.  For appetizers, we had the grilled and the fried calamari. The grilled calamari won hands down. For entrees, it was hard to choose. There were tons of specials (at least 5). We ended up ordering the Canuck burger and the mushroom risotto. The mushroom risotto was quite delicious, al dente with a creamy sauce. The burger was quite delicious as well. It tastes as good as the burgers at my favorite burger joint in the GTA. The fries come with a tasty chipotle mayo dip.  Personally I think the prices are a little higher than I would expect for equivalent food quality. We'll keep this place in our back pocket for places to visit for a quick bite."}
