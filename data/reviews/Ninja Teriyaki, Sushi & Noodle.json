{"text":"I ordered food from here off of door dash. I wasn't disappointed but I wasn't overly impressed either. I would say for the price it's pretty good. I enjoyed my katsu curry! The katsu was cooked perfectly. Didn't have much flavor or juiciness but it was good. The curry sauce was delicious and had a perfect texture. I just wish there were veggies or something in it. I also got the fried chicken appetizer which I didn't really enjoy but I loved the sauce that it came with. I will probably continue to order from here when I need delivery as the delivery was free and the price was reasonable."}
{"text":"Yummy take-out option for those nights you just want to stay in. Good and fast service too! I had the tonkatsu plate which comes with rice, mac salad, and green salad with a really tasty sesame dressing. The flavors are traditional Japanese (some people might interpret it as bland) but I thought everything was well seasoned and not too salty. I recommend this place. Support small businesses and give this place a shot."}
{"text":"They not only have sushi but a variety of items on their menu. Ramen, bowls, bentos & sides. Very good service and  so welcoming, clean establishment. We ended up ordering the karaage plate and teriyaki chicken. Very delicious and flavorful, excellent presentation! I already know what i would like to come back to try next!"}
{"text":"This place is PHENOMENAL!!!! Would dine here at least weekly if I loved close by, great service, food, atmosphere, parking, and clean bathrooms!!! I had the vegan roll and spam musubi-could eat both everyday!!!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place up the street. Your food has amazing flavor like the beef udon. Your sushi has a nice flavor,fresh taste and sticky rice. It is always a pleasant experience walking in with warm greetings and welcoming smiles. When I order online I'm told 35-40 minuets and it blows my mind how you have that order completely bagged and ready to go In 20 minuets"}
{"text":"Nice for some good sushi, not overly fancy but decent quality. I ordered the egg rolls, soft shell crab roll, California roll, teriyaki chicken and miso 

I would eat from here again, my 15mo old even ate the sushi, egg rolls and Goyza and loved it."}
{"text":"Wanted to try something new around the house and just found this place. I ordered the salmon bento box from their website and upgraded to a rainbow roll. This may have been the smallest piece of salmon I've ever had; now reading some other reviews I'm thinking maybe that's just normal here. The potato croquettes were fine and the sushi was average. The lady I picked the food up from was very nice so I'll give it another shot, I was just expecting a little more for a $17 bento."}
{"text":"You have an awkward location with awkward decor that interrupts the flow of the ambiance and a horrible staff who has absolutely 0 common sense. No one in this place knows what they're doing, not the cooks, the cashier, or the 11 year old girl they have answering the phones and ringing in the orders. The old Japanese female with the short hair has the nerve to raise her voice to people without understanding English 100%. Opening a restaurant isn't supposed to be this way. You all have A LOT OF LEARNING TO DO. Go back to the drawing board and reevaluate what needs to be done in order to run a business because what you're doing is NOT the right way."}
{"text":"The corner of this Southwest plaza has been dying for a good restaurant. With the recent closure of Jun's Korean, which did not compare to it's sister locations, Ninja has moved in its place. This is the 2nd location of the business, which seems to have a successful following as well (Ninja Teriyaki + Sushi 2 Go). I thought I'd take a chance for lunch and I'm glad I did. I ordered their plain curry with chicken karaage on the side. Curry was flavorful and not super thick, a welcomed addition to the area since Curry Zen is losing a bit of its luster. The karaage was well done and held its crispness during the drive home. Portion and price are decent and I thought I got good value for what I got, but I can see some people not wanting to pay $12 for the combo of the items I ordered. I'm eager to try the other items on the menu. The lady that rang me up was friendly and made sure I knew what I was ordering. Decorations are minimal, as this restaurant seems to be for people on the go. Wishing them success in the area!"}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time today using Postmates. I'm a huge spam musubi fan and this was the worst I've ever had. I ordered 6 pieces of cucumber sushi. Was small as shit. A complete waste of money and time."}
{"text":"Really good no frills AUTHENTIC Japanese style. Very similar to restaurants found on every corner in Japan. Great Ramen without having to go all the way to Monta. Inexpensive in relation to what is available elsewhere. Not fake Japanese like Ohaja. NICE people. We have spent a lot of time in Japan, and this is somewhere we can absolutely recomend."}
{"text":"Sushi is on the same level as what you would buy from the grocery store. There is a ton of rice. I've definitely had way better, but it's good for the price."}
{"text":"My cousin took us to this place, & it was great! Their plates are so fulfilling. We were not disappointed! I had their chicken karaage plate & it totally hit home (Hawaii). We ate there this past Sunday, it's Tuesday & I'm having this for dinner AGAIN! This is now my go to, head on their way!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for a reasonable priced Japanese food that was close to us and came across this place, they took over the old Juns Korean bbq spot and I didn't even know it closed down. The prices looked like what we wanted to spend that night and have a nice take out dinner at home. The place wasn't upgraded yet and still had the old spots paint on the walls. The people running the place are very nice and welcoming.

I had high hopes for the flavor of the food and the way the pictures looked on their menu I was expecting a lot I guess. I ordered the chicken Katsu curry since I was feeling a simple taste and Japanese curry is my firs favorite curry style, my wife got the chicken sesame ginger and we also ordered the spicy tuna and Cali rolls. My chicken had some pieces with the cartilage still attached and one piece was all chewy skin, nothing is worse than bitting into Katsu to crunch on some cartilage or skin that's not crispy. The curry was so on point and saved the food for me. The sesame ginger chicken was a little bland for the amount of flavor the dish was portraying in its name, the spicy tuna and Cali rolls also saved the meal for me. 

I am hoping the next time I try this place it redeems this experience because I love when a mom and pop shop opens and does great."}
{"text":"I know this used to be a Jun's Korean Restaurant and I was actually going to call in and pick up some food when I noticed it was not Jun's. However, I looked at Ninja's menu and I was so happy that it was Japanese food!

I tried the salmon bento shioyaki bento with a shrimp tempura roll. It was so good, and I loved that there are potato croquettes in there. Those are my favorite.

They have other things like sushi, Japanese style curry, teriyaki bowls, etc. and it's super affordable and filling. Definitely coming here more often!"}
{"text":"Little hole in the wall.  Clean and food was amazing. Happy to see a Japanese owned Japanese restaurant.  I ate the miso ramen and it was Oishi.
Priced right and portions was perfect.   I will be back"}
{"text":"Great food, customer service and clean atmosphere. I have come in many times and everything is reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Good food and good service. I ordered the salmon bento box and upgraded my California roll to a tiger roll for $5 extra. The roll was good, and the shrimp was still crispy! The salmon was very small, though. Probably a 1 - 1 1/2oz sliver. The bento did not come with white rice. For those reasons, the salmon bento is slightly over priced. The cashier was a adorable little girl, that could barely reach the counter. She was very nice, sweet, and provided good service. Overall, a nice new little mom and pop shop."}
{"text":"Ordered a 48 piece vegan platter and they jipped me with 30 something lol but the service was fast and the sushi was ok."}
{"text":"This location just opened a month ago, their second and we had the chicken teriyaki bowl and tonkatsu ramen and beef sukiyaki.  I thought all three dishes were average in flavor and the ramen very basic compared to many places that make their noodles from scratch.  I would recommend not getting the gari garnish on top of the sukiyaki is only for color try it without.  The staff is real helpful and apologetic for forgetting my spicy tuna roll appetizer."}
{"text":"I was recently in the area and saw that this place had opened up, so I decided to give it a try. (Previously Jun's Korean and Kauai Cafe before that). Their menu consists of sushi, bento boxes, ramen and curry which was what I was craving for at the time. 

My first experience here wasn't the greatest. No greeting when I walked in. The girl standing behind the counter had no interest in welcoming me to this newly opened restaurant or giving me a run down of the menu. I decided to order the Katsu Curry to go and waited about 7 minutes until my food was ready. What a disappointment! I get that this is not a curry house, but the curry was pretty bad! It was way too watered down and although it wasn't bland, it could have tasted a lot better if it was thicker! Sadly, L&L has better curry.

But, they are new and everyone deserves a second chance, right? Came back a week later with the husband. This time I ordered the Chicken Teriyaki Bento Box. It was nothing special, but the chicken wasn't too fatty and the potato croquette was simple - only corn inside, but tasty. My husband ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen and Curry Rice, which he enjoyed. The curry was thicker too! I'm pretty picky about salads and I liked how they don't use crappy lettuce, you know the kind that is barely green and mostly brown. 

Nice to see a Japanese owned restaurant! I guess if I'm in the mood for simple Japanese food I'll come back here."}
