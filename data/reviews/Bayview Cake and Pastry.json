{"text":"Just a small Chinese bakery.
  They have typical Chinese bread like pineapple buns, sausage buns and coconut cream buns.  They sell some cakes, deserts, bubble tea, tea eggs and curry fish balls.

I think they also have hong-kong waffles since I saw the waffle maker but I couldn't find it on the menu and didn't ask.

The prices are pretty cheap so its not a bad place to get a lunch or snack."}
{"text":"A small Chinese style bakery with the standard / favourites such as BBQ Pork buns, curry beef buns, egg tarts, and coconut buns. The price is quite good for the quality of the food. The buns look great and taste fairly good. They also offer bubble tea but we didn't order any. If I lived in the area I would definitely regularly frequent this bakery because it's a better quality and price than going to the Asian supermarkets. And it's a family owned and operated shop, so it's better to support the small local businesses.

The owner seemed to be a nice guy, a soft spoken gentleman.

I will definitely go back for more treats if I'm in the area with my family."}
{"text":"Why doesn't this place have any reviews? Do they even get business??? :(
They deserve a lot more traffic and attention. As such, I'll be back with photos.

My friend got some egg tarts from here. They didn't have enough (she wanted a dozen?) so they told her to take a seat and they'd make a fresh batch just for her. She got the fresh tarts out of the oven in 20ish minutes. They were delicious... Today I got another tart as well as several buns since 6 items are TAX FREE. the egg tart was just as yummy when cold. They're 85 cents each. The price of buns range from $1.95-$3+ with the higher priced buns for meat sandwich types. They also sell small cakes, cup noodles, egg waffles, bubble tea, ice-cream and tons of quick food options. I was surprised at how extensive the food menu was. They had bbq pork rice, kimchi fried rice, Mac and cheese, fried chicken, Taiwanese fried chicken, curry beef balls, and fries... Tons of options with the price ranging from $6-9 I think. Very cheap, but I had already got takeout elsewhere that day so I can't comment on the portion or quality. Next time, I may try their Korean chicken and rice.
If you read this post, give this place a chance!!!"}
{"text":"I was introduced to this bakery by a friend who has brought egg tarts from this shop to many of our dinner gatherings.

Personally, I LOVE these egg tarts. I hate the flakey egg tarts and these ones have a nice tart shell and the egg tart is so light and creamy. It's hard to have any self control when there is a box in front of you.

The owner is also a very nice man. It is out of the way for me but totally worth it. I'd say these are my favorite egg tarts EVER."}
{"text":"Bayview Cake and Pastry is a really small bakery with limited selections of Chinese buns and sweet. 

Most of the buns cost $1 each with some traditional choices and western/chinese fusion.

They also has a limited menu for a light breakfast and lunch, probably trying to attract the lunch crowd from the school across the street.

The interior is clean and bright with white shiny deco."}
