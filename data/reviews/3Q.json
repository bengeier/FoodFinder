{"text":"Meal for about $10-13. We tried a variety of rice bowl meal and we like everything. We always get the cold tea with sugar. Love their signature fried chicken and condensed milk bun. I also tried the chicken udon soup. I wish the broth is heated more for my liking."}
{"text":"I discovered this really good bubble tea cafe a few weeks ago. The manager, Jovi, is really nice and well informed about tea. He spent 3 years learning to make bubble tea and it's evident in the quality of the drinks. To ensure the drinks are authentic everything is ordered from Taiwan, the origin of bubble tea. The tea is freshly brewed for each order which is pretty unique for Calgary. It takes a little longer but it's well worth the wait.  The lemon kumquat iced green tea was made with fresh fruit juices and even till the very last sip there was a strong fragrant tea aftertaste in my mouth. My boyfriend had the signature milk tea with brown sugar agar, grass jelly and pearls. It's the first bubble tea cafe I've been to outside of Taiwan that has agar in the drinks.  I'm impressed with the quality of tea from this cafe and I can't wait to come back to try other drinks."}
{"text":"Great place to snack :) the popcorn chicken rice bowl is very simple and delicious ... the rice just needed more flavour and the rice is cold !!! Not sure if that was on purpose.. the roasted Milk tea was amazing amazing g and amazing !!!"}
{"text":"Ever curious about this place, l had noticed this place across from a perennial favourite, Hotpoint, across the street. It was -10 out and I was hankering for some real bubble tea so l stopped in.    I like that everything is made fresh, and not from flavoured powders. I tried two teas- the most popular 3Q tea and a Kumquat tea.  I like that the teas were not overly sweet.  The bubbles, agar and q was amazing. The tea was milky and flavourful.   Definitely will return for more amazing teas.  Did not get a chance to try the snacks and was delighted to see that they were expanding next week. Since parking is slightly better than across the street, l surely am returning for my favourites at a newfound place!!"}
{"text":"It's real Taiwanese bistro!!  All drink and food here are so amazing! The drink is much much better than other store ( all fruit drink is made by natural fruit!!)  Meal here are all traditional flavors and so relax place! Came so many times and I will come again and again!!"}
{"text":"They currently has 5 tables, very small, under expansion by early March 2017. Very interesting Taiwanese Bubble Tea/Snacks/Noodle House. Foods are very strong flavored, very good, need to come here a few times to try them all out. Recommended to venture."}
{"text":"AMAZING authentic Taiwanese food. The taste reminded me of home. My partner had TWO bento's in ONE meal!! Very friendly, fun, caring and down-to-earth owner and staff. Highly recommended for anyone who wants to try Taiwanese bento's, appetizers, snacks and bubble tea with the unique Taiwanese friendly service style of love and care."}
{"text":"Tried this on a Saturday night and it was quiet. Only 2 tables were occupied. We weren't very hungry so ordered snacks n drinks rather than full meals. The fried tofu was my absolute fave!! It was hot, fresh, had a coating with dipping sauce. The popcorn chicken was good but the pork dumplings were not. They tasted like frozen gyoza that they heated up. The yam fries had a choice of prawn powder or salt n pepper. We had the prawn powder which tasted amazing!!! It had a mild brown sugar, salt mixture that was addictive!   For drinks, our kid had a mango smoothie while I decide on a longan and red bean hot drink. Both were tasty and they have a good selection. If I'm near this area I'd like to try their soups or other full meals rather than the snack items."}
{"text":"Looks are deceiving... the ramen noodle lunch special they had looked really good but when it arrived it was flavourless the meat was tough the ramen was soggy and who puts uncut romain lettuce into ramen soup?    For 12.95 I rather not bother for the food here. Across the the street they have Hot point which has their 12.95 special also and is always packed.     We only decided to come here because Hot point was really busy on the Friday long weekend.      The only good thing was the jello that it came with.      Can't judge the bubbletea as I only got the tea with the combo. But it seemed like people were only coming in for that. Other then that the restaurant was dead."}
{"text":"Review: lunch and dinner.  We felt like having some bubble tea to fuel up after spending most of the day running errands in the Southside and was reminded of this place near Chinook centre. We weren't all that impressed the first time around, but we were quite surprised when revisiting this place.  Bottomline: Great deep flavors of bubble tea and well cooked bubbles, but unfortunately the experience was anchored by inconsistent food.  Atmosphere: casual Asian style cafe. Restaurant was minimalistic and clean. Service was good.  Food: On first visit, I ordered the spicy beef noodle soup combo as recommended by the server. It came in a neat little tray with the bubble tea and a jello dessert. At first glance, the bowl of noodle soup looked quite appetizing, but unfortunately it did not deliver. The soup was spicy and bland. The depth of flavor is equivalent to a kiddie pool. The only saving grace was the well cooked beef and the tea-infused? Jello. On second visit, I ordered the deep fried pork rice bowl and what a difference! The pork was fried to a perfect crisp and quite flavorful (much like the food you get in Taiwan). The Jello even had lychee pieces inside (which was missing the first time we went). When the food is cooked right, this cafe is worth 5 stars.  Value: the BBT was a bit more expensive than other places, but worth the extra $. Price was average to good for the food depending on the cook. Again, portions were small to average depending on the day."}
{"text":"Best Oolong Milktea in yyc !   Strong flavour and the quality of the drink is consistent (not like other bbt place, ordering the same things but taste differently every time).  The food is not bad here but I have only tried like 3 items, so I feel like I should do the review on food items later."}
