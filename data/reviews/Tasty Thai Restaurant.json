{"text":"First time going here. The place looks really old on the outside, but the inside is very nice, and looks newly remodeled. The decorations are very interesting, and give you something to look at while waiting for your food. It's a nice atmosphere, and they were playing traditional Thai music. I had the yellow curry, and it was one of the best I've tasted in the valley. Will definitely keep coming back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Yum!  This place was delicious!  A completely unassuming little Thai restaurant.  We walked in at 2:30 in the afternoon and the place was empty.  I was worried at first, but it turned out to be a really good spot.  I had tried Thai Basil and wasn't impressed.  The portion size was good, leaving me with filling meal there and enough for a light dinner at home later.  The soup was delicious!  And the medium spicy was plenty spicy for me, although I'm kinda wimpy with spiciness.  Also, the prices here are great!  I got lunch, a Thai ice coffee and split a dessert, and the total came to about $12.  Not bad for all that stuff!  Delish!"}
{"text":"I had green chicken curry that was Thai hot and it was pretty good as was the soup.  It was nearly as hot as I wanted it.  The owners are very friendly and want to make sure you enjoy the food."}
{"text":"I'm here on business from the Midwest and this place rocks!! Medium spicy was what I expected ... Just hot enough to make my face sweat a little.  Perfect!"}
{"text":"Very impressed by the  6.95 lunch specials, which go until 4pm! I had the Chicken Panang, which is my favorite,  I took it to go, and it was still hot and delicious when I got home 20 minutes later. I didn't give it 5 stars, just because I didn't eat in, and I'm sure there is better Thai out there somewhere, but for the price, this is the best Thai I have had."}
{"text":"We loved coming here but on our last visit here with my  two granddaughters it was surely a disappointment. My oldest granddaughter loves orange chicken they were out of it who runs out of chicken in a restaurant. Next my youngest granddaughter wanted  fried rice she gets plain rice, my husband orders Mongolian beef gets his order with tons of veggies that he could count the beef strip's three of them. Need to find another Thai restaurant. Any suggestions?"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! I come in here for the lunch special at least once a week.... usually more. The service is second to none and their hot and sour soup is the best I've ever had. Tasty Thai has definitely earned the top spot in my lunch rotation. Do yourself a favor and give them a try!"}
{"text":"After reading all the good reviews, we were looking forward to eating here, but we were a bit apprehensive due to the couple of bad reviews because of the smell. Bummer...the smell just killed it for us right from the get go. Immediately, upon walking in the door, the pungent smell of backed up sewer hit us like a ton-of-bricks. We did a 180 and walked right out. No way I could sit through a meal here while breathing that funk.   Get the smell worked out and we will give you another shot, Tasty Thai."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I have tried every Thai place around ASU and Tasty Thai is probably on the top of the list. I love Thai really hot (hotter than Thai Hot) and they can actually take care of my addiction. Last week I had the Spicy Noodle and it was probably the best noodle dish I have ever had. They had fresh crispy green beens and mushrooms in it which gave it fantastic flavor.  I highly recommend this place, not to mention it is very nice in side, and the people running it are very helpful!"}
{"text":"Food looks good. That's all I can really attest to as we've been waiting for 40 minutes and all other tables around us have been served, even the ones seated after us."}
{"text":"Portions were rather large, however they were not tasty at all. Save your time, money, frustration, and overall meal experience and go elsewhere. There is a reason the restaurant had no other business when we walked in during dinner time on a Saturday night. Don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"AWESOME thai, especially for what I have had at the same price. Portions are big enough that 2 entrees could easily be split between 4 hungry college guys. Thats saying something, especially when their pad thai packs a punch to your mouth with heat and flavor, without putting the burn on your wallet. Good form!"}
{"text":"Just ate at tasty Thai. It was awesome. We have eaten on a lot of Thai restaurants around the world and save Hong Kong, this was one of the best we've had. Had the massaman and yellow curries. Also the coconut soup and fried rice. All weres excellent. Had to keep the kids (and the adults) from licking the plate!"}
{"text":"After touring the ASU campus, the family wanted to have Thai food. We yelped Thai food and Tasty Thai was on our way to the resort.  I was kind of skeptical about this place because all the surrounding buildings in the mini mall were closed .  Didn't know what to expect but was surprised the food was good ."}
{"text":"Delicious food that's well presented, only one complaint... Food takes a little too long at lunchtime.. Every time. It's worth it! But, speed up a little please! Place isn't huge but well worth a try."}
{"text":"Don't let the zero other customers at 530p or abandonned donut shop looking building deter you from Tasty Thai.  More customers are on their way and the food is awesome.  Their red curry is full of great veggies.  The larb salad-really excellent (altho id like it with more veggies).  The pad thai--a litle sweeter than you might expect, but in the best possible way.  Go.  Eat.  Be happy."}
{"text":"I really feel Tasty Thai is one of the best Thai places in the SE Valley.  I'm allergic to soy and love curry and none of the curries at Tasty Thai have soy in them. The pumpkin curry is exceptional.  I would recommend this Thai place to anyone.  It doesn't have the loveliest interior, but if you are going for the food, I'm sure you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Small establishment located in a nearly vacancy strip mall. Curious odor, as others have noted, approaching the entry (likely a  unmaintained grease trap). Courteous, friendly service and marvelous, extremely tasty food. Reasonable price and ample portions. Traditional decor, and not cramped even though small dining area."}
{"text":"Orange chicken so good I forgot to wait for my food to cool down and burned my tongue."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I ordered Thai hot, and that's what I got. The spicy noodles with chicken and tofu is delicious and sized to break up into two meals."}
{"text":"I found this place because I was working in Tempe and I wanted some Thai. Sometimes you get lucky, sometimes you don't. I feel like I got pretty lucky at this place and I have been back several times. Their spicy red curry is the yardstick by which I measure all spicy red curry. It is fabulous. I'd never had it until I had it here. I've since tried it many places and boy, it's not always like this let me tell you. Great service, reasonable prices - if you like Thai, hit this place up."}
{"text":"dinner here and found this place on yelp reviews were good so gave it a shot. place sits in an empty strip mall parking lot was full so thinking this place was busy. walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others  there eating. was seated quickly and the waiteress was very nice. ordered a tom yum soup which is hard to find at other places as a single cup waiterss suggested to have a med temp way  to spicey couldn't even get a 1/4 of the bowel eaten.which is to bad cause it was filled with all kinds of good stuff. my phad thi was good and plenty of it on the plate. overall i would go back and check out the lunch menu but will go to my old stand bys wild thaiger..for dinner.."}
{"text":"Very delicious curries have made this place a regular destination for me and my roommate. Small place but definitely a must try for those who want to try or already love thai food."}
{"text":"I love that there are so many good Thai restaurants in this area. This one does not disappoint either. The food is good and the ambiance is cute. I got my pad thai at a medium-hot, but I would bump it up 2 levels next time since it wasn't very spicy. I think this one is a little more expensive too. I got a shrimp pad thai ($12.95) and a \"large\" Thai Iced Tea ($3.50). It was $20 for just me doing take out. However, I was in and out within 10 minutes."}
{"text":"This place is soooooo good! Seriously my mouth is watering just thinking about their food. Service can be slow cause I only ever seen one waitress doing everything haha but for the most part everything comes fast and is super yummy!"}
{"text":"just ate there tonight. food was great! i had the pad thai and it was awesome!! kinda small and in a low budget place but that is where you usually find great places.. a must for thai..."}
{"text":"I love Thai curries and have tried just about every place you can think of. Tasty Thai is, by far, the best Thai curry you can get in the Tempe area. My favorite is the yellow curry but I have true them all here and they are wonderful. It's also worth mentioning that this place has a wonderful atmosphere and the staff are always friendly."}
{"text":"We have had a proliferation of thai restaurants of late!  I must have 7 within a 2 mile radius of where I live... but this one rocks a curry dish that I adore... Pumpkin Curry - I think the \"squash variety\" changes according to what is available but the over-all quality of the dish does not.  Yum Yum Yum it makes me happy!   Service is a little slow but when the grub is good so am I."}
{"text":"Good thing they have a sidewalk sign, this gem is easy to miss heading west on Broadway from Mill Ave. Small and tastefully decorated, the service was as good as the food.  We ordered Satay Chicken- the peanut sauce is particularly delicious, and three lunch specials to share: Spicy Cashew Chicken- medium hot.  Very flavorful, tender white meat slices of chicken and a nice lemongrass zing. Masaman Beef Curry- medium hot.  This was very much enjoyed by my guests who are new to Thai food. Not too thick or pungent.  Tender potatoes and melt in your mouth slices of beef over their jasmine rice was the favorite. Pad Thai- medium spicy. I like my pad thai a little drier. This was very flavorful, but the noodles were a little overcooked and didn't give the texture that would have made this an otherwise outstanding dish. Don't miss the warm Thai Custard for dessert. IMO far better food and ambiance than other East Valley Thai spots."}
{"text":"The Yelp reviews on this place are spot on!  The place was very quiet on a Friday at dinner time.  Small and quaint and very clean.  Our server was gracious and friendly.  The potstickers were great!  Not greasy like can be found other joints.  Soft, hot and wonderful soy-ginger type sauce.  The Spicy Noodle was almost perfect though probably too hot to be considered the medium that I had ordered.  Thankfully I had my Thai iced-tea to help me through it.  My friend says the green curry was freaking awesome!  Those are her words, not mine.  She says it had great flavor.  Also be conscience of the spicy level you order as it was also hotter than the medium she expected.  We will definitely go back for more!"}
{"text":"Got back from out of town and was craving Thai food. Didn't review it the first time I came in but had to the second time. First the food is excellent. I had pot stickers, wonton soup and pad Thai To go and it all was on point!! Reason I'm writing the review is the women working....assuming she is the owner... Big storm was coming in....power was in and out and she had customers. It was noon and there was a lunch rush. I sat at the bar and got to watch and see how she would handle this situation. As a fellow business owner I have to say during all the madness she completely kept her cool while making sure everyone still getting good service..taking orders over phone and calling out everyone individually thanking them for coming in. Good food..good ownership...I won't question coming back here again!"}
{"text":"Wanting something spicy, I went to this Thai place last week. I was not disappointed. I had the pad ped curry with chicken - spice level - hot. It was awesome! The curry - made of red curry paste - was great! Some of the other places add a little too much of coconut to their curry which kinda overwhelms the other flavors, but this one was perfect!  The interiors, though, leaves a lot to be desired.. They have this part-funny, part-scary looking plastic skull fitted with reindeer party horns at one corner. I mean, seriously!?  Overall, definitely a solid 4.0!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by my experience. Small thai place in a dead strip mall. Ive seen it there for a few years just have never gone in. Recently my go-to thai place went down hill so I tried something new. Sadly there are a lot of crappy thai places in Tempe. I am no means a thai food expert but I do eat a lot of it. First off, I hate Thai Basil, whoever think that is good thai food has no taste buds.   The smell is still there, it reminded me of vietnamese cooking not a sewer so much. I got a lunch to go order of Yellow Curry / Chicken Hot (my stand bys), I had them add bell peppers and Pad Thai / Chicken Hot. The hot level was perfect, nice and spicy to get your nose running but not too hot where you cant enjoy it. The prices were great, $14 for both meals. The portions were very generous. My only qualm was that there were only two pieces of green onion in my pad thai? WTH?! Thankfully I had some at home so I could doctor it up. Next time I will ask for extra green onion. The flavors and spices were perfect. The lady who took my payment seemed to have troubles with the register, but whatever.   The place was empty when I was there, hopefully it stays alive since I will now be a regular there.   I will certainly go back there."}
{"text":"Delicious Panang!! I came at 17:00 on a Thursday and it was completely dead. Not a soul in the parking lot I was a little nervous if the reviews were all true. Well I'm glad I went in. Quick service and good tasty Thai. Sodas come in a can and their hot really wasn't that hot but everyone has different temperature tolerance. Overall not bad and I would come again and maybe try Thai hot."}
{"text":"We love Tasty Thai.  Many of my coworkers go there and the wait staff is excellent.  Unfortunately, when my friend and I went there yesterday we had a slightly different experience.  While enjoying our meal, I felt something fall in my hair.  Panicking, I jumped up from the table and asked my friend to see what was in my hair.  Lo and behold, it was a giant cockroach which I assume came from the vent above.  After that, neither one of us could finish our meal and were quite shaken about the experience.  My coworkers and I will not be going back.  One word of advice to those loyal patrons, don't sit under the vent!"}
{"text":"This is one of those places that I wish I could give a better star rating to but I just can't. My co-worker and I go here regularly for lunch during the work week and we always have the same waitress who does a good job.  I'm a creature of habit here and always order the beef pad see ew and find that it's inconsistent. Some visits it's fantastic to where I'll be craving it and wanting to go back. But then other visits it's not flavored well or the meat is tough. You never really know what you're going to get. My co-workers have noticed the same.  The soup that comes with the lunch is usually good but I also find that on random occasions it has more of a kick to it than normal. Just more inconsistency.  Prices are good."}
{"text":"Best Thai in Tempe, love their Pad Thai and Pad-See-Ew. Super friendly, great for takeout, reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Came in for a late lunch.  The place was empty but we tried it out anyways.  Two people came in while we were eating to order food to-go.    The food was delicious and authentic.  I had the chicken pad thai.  I love when they add a generous heaping of crushed peanuts!  I just wish it was spicier, or that there was some better hot sauce to add on.  My thai tea was perfect.  Can't beat the price and the flavor!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry but I had a VERY hard time with the smell as you walk in the door.  It smells like backed up sewer.  :(    My yellow currey chicken was good but defintely not hot enough for me.  I ordered the hottest I could and it just wasn't very spicy.  Overall though, the flavor was good.   We tried the pot stickers and they were very good also but I'm not crazy about the pancake/crepe doiley thing they came on.    I also ordered the coconut ice cream cake and was NOT impressed.  I believe the ice cream was actually freezer burned.    So all in all, I don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"I think I've eaten about half the lunch menu here and have yet to be disappointed. Friendly staff, great food. I would definitely recommend the red curry or pad prik king...or the spicy noodle."}
{"text":"Great food, reasonably priced. But the one waitress/barmaid working in this small place with tacky decor seemed very nervous and unhappy to be there. A little odd, but it's the food that counts."}
{"text":"Food was completely boring and  average.  Panda is to Chinese food what they are to Thai food.  Their spicy is Taco bell spicy.  Service was bad.  We were the only patrons when we ate dinner.  It still took the ditsy waitress 8 minutes to take our drink order.  I went to the bathroom to wash my hands and someone had dropped a hot load that stunk up the bathroom.  When I went back to the table my girlfriend could smell it from the table.  Again, there were no customers, so it was the staff.    I ordered Dr Pepper and received a coke.  10 minutes after finishing our meal we finally were given the check  With so many good Thai places in the valley, dont bother with this one.  I assume the huge number of glowing reviews are from the business lunch crowd.  I guess it beats the fast food options in the near area?"}
{"text":"The survive was very quick and helpful. I ordered the Green Curry and flavor was awesome... I will be back good experience !!!"}
{"text":"Not a huge Thai food fan but I went here this weekend and it was pretty good, service was good food was good. A little warm though inside seemed the ac was turned up a little to high for my taste but it was ok. Overall will defiantly recommend all the time"}
{"text":"Husband and I went here and the food was ok but the service was beyond slow. When we got there, there was another party just leaving so we were basically the only customers. After reading other reviews I see this is a normal thing. My warning to you: Don't go here unless you have a lot of spare time."}
{"text":"I think I'm in love! By no means am I a Thai food-aficionado; but my palate recognizes good food and my wallet recognizes a good lunch special. This place satisfied both my wallet and my taste buds! I had the Red Curry Chicken which was served with rice, Spring Roll and House Salad all for only $6.95! The Red Curry was rich with just the right amount of heat (there's three levels heat available to suit everyone's needs). Even though the House Salad was pretty plain I really enjoyed the house dressing which was some type of Olive Oil, Pepper, Garlic mixture. There was so much food I was able to pack the leftovers for later. My co-workers all love this place too. Can't wait to go back for more Thai food!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Pad See Ewe and Tasty Thai makes a very good version. They serve an excellent salad as an appetizer during lunch. The restaurant is nice inside it has the same decor as of most of the other thai places here in the valley. It's a small place with a bar and dining room \"cozy\" would probably be the appropriate word.  The waiter we had for lunch was a nice guy and didn't mind us bringing in fast food for my nephew which is always appreciated as he has not developed a love of thai just yet.  I will deffinately be back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Absolutely top notch on all fronts.  Locally owned and ran.  Easy location to get to and very clean inside.  Staff is extremely polite and friendly.  Excellent pot stickers to start and I had the Pad Prik King with chicken, hot, for lunch.  Hot on their scale is quite hot, so be wary.  I shutter to think of what their Thai hot would be like.  All very fresh and flavorful, including the egg-drop soup and the jasmin iced tea.    We finished it with sticky rice and coconut ice cream, which was a perfect foil to the spicy entree.  This will absolutely become a regular visit in the lunch rotation."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times before, but most recently my girl brought me here for lunch on our anniversary. I had the garlic & pepper beef with salad. Absolutely delicious! I chose mild. The flavor was good, but basically no heat. I really like the salad dressing, which is their own recipe. She had a chicken dish that she chose medium spice. It was also really good and good spice level. They serve soda in cans, which I don't really like but it's not the end of the world. The service has always been good and fast. I've only been there for lunch and I've never been late back to work. The place is pretty small, and I like that. It's never been too crowded, which I also like. I will probably eat here a lot more times. If you go and you sit in the small room to the right, you might notice an interesting piece of art on the wall."}
{"text":"After eating at Tasty Thai, I come out disappointed at other Thai restaurants. We love the red curry, jungle curry and pad ped curry!"}
{"text":"Was in Tempe on business and was starting to get desperate for something a little different after a few days in town. Chose Tasty Thai based on Yelp reviews. Man, was I glad I did! Wasn't too impressed pulling in- looks like a converted fast food place on the outside. It was also warm inside; a/c was unable to keep up with 115° outside (I was there in June 2013 during near-record setting heat). Clean but the decor nothing to write home about. Thought briefly about leaving but hunger won out so I sat down.   Ordered satay and cashew chicken, medium spicy. Satay was good. Not the best I've ever had but solid. The cashew chicken on the other hand... absolutely phenomenal!! Incredible tasty, thin, peppery sauce. Not the typical starchy \"brown sauce\" served in many Thai places. Loads of fresh, crunchy, perfectly cooked vegetables and lean, tender chicken perfectly seasoned and spicy. I nearly lifted the plate to drink the last bit of sauce on the plate.   To make it simple: I used to travel to travel to Thailand fairly frequently for work, and I've not eaten Thai this good since I was last in Bangkok. I find myself  looking forward to my next business trip to Phoenix... I plan to eat here more than once next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"One of my go-to Thai places for lunch.  It's close to work and the prices are reasonable.  Red curry chicken is my fave!"}
{"text":"After returning from a trip to Southeast Asia this is exactly what I needed. The food is authentic and wonderful. Get the \"hot\" ... nice and spicy."}
{"text":"Its an adorable little local place very intimate seating, the place is called TASTY THAI because that is exactly what it is, best food and prices I have had in awhile.   no happy hour because no booze, but one does not need booze with every meal especially when the food is this good!   this is more of an adult setting don't bring children its small and cute!"}
{"text":"Since continue to have trouble finding really good Chinese food in the valley, I've gravitated toward Thai, and have been fortunate to find wonderful places like Tasty Thai.  The staff is lovely and warm, and I've yet to be served anything I didn't love.  You can throw a dart at the menu and not have to worry about what you're getting.  As soon as I've left, I start planning my next visit.  Check You Tube for their \"Check, Please Arizona\" episode."}
{"text":"Spot is quaint...I think it's funny they cover up the outlets so people don't camp with their computers...do people really do that in Thai restaurants? Anyhoo....absolutely loved my server, the sweetest lady ever she gets 5 stars from me...I had the Pad Thai just on the edge of being too sweet for me but tasty. They have a salad dressing that is delish some people think it has a lot of salt and pepper which it does but most people like it, I think they might even sell it. I would come back again especially since I didn't smell anything weird."}
{"text":"YUM! I had the spicy fried rice with beef and it was so good! When you say HOT here they really mean it. I have been to other thai places and have ordered Thai Hot and it is nowhere near as spicy. lol. This place really has an odd smell but their food is very good. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!!! Thai curry noodle, pad Thai, or pad see ew lunch specials with soup are my favorite!!!!"}
{"text":"Great Chicken Pad Thai! Definitely recommend and will be going back! Ease of ordering for take out and the food was delicious. Perfect balance of taste, spice and flavor."}
{"text":"Food is good. Hotter scale than most Thai restaurants. Little slow on service.Good prices, but I've had better Thai food."}
{"text":"I'm surprisingly disappointed! I've eaten here before and it was OK. Tonight, takeout Pad Thai with chicken and Yellow Curry with chicken were not good at all!  Neither had much flavor, or hardly any chicken. There was NO hint of Thai spice, and as mentioned by another reviewer, the curry was more like a soup than a sauce, and lacked flavor. The rice noodles were stuck together in lumps, as if they had been cooked and held too long then not treated appropriately.   I likely won't return to this establishment, since there are several much better Thai choices in the area. If you go, eat in, and be prepared to send dishes back if they don't come out right."}
{"text":"Tasty Thai doesn't get nearly enough love but they're incredible. They have a diverse menu and basically everything is good and some things are great. Best orange chicken I have ever had and some of the spicy Thai dishes are incredible. Still exploring the menu but nothing has disappointed thus far."}
{"text":"Overall the food is amazing and very reasonable price during the lunch time. However, I was very disappoint it at the end. I saw a lady order a drink for to go. She drink it and found out it was wrong order. They made the new the order for you. When she left, the owner put the drink back to original jars and serve for next customer. I am shock and very disappointed about it."}
{"text":"I really, really, really want to give Tasty Thai a better score, but I can't. Their food I flavorful and plentiful and their way staff is friendly enough. The issue is their inattentive and extremely slow. I've been here multiple times and at different capacities. I've been seated at the last available seat and been the only sold in the dining area. It doesn't matter the time or the occupancy, your food is going to come S    L    O    W. Want Pad Thai? 40 minute wait. Green Curry? 40 minute wait. I work less than 5 minutes from Tasty Thai and it's almost impossible to get lunch here in less than an hour. I will have to find a different place for my lunch thai cravings."}
{"text":"Great Larb. Service was o.k., but the  food is what matters, and it was top notch."}
{"text":"Delicious food!  Service was great too.  It is spicy but yummy.  I'd highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Small place, big flavor! This Thai restaurant is worthy of its name. The exterior of the building may be very generic, but inside it is very clean and cozy, with a friendly staff adding to the overall warmth of the place. The food is very well seasoned, the heat tempered to your taste, with individual flavor elements like toasted garlic and spices distinct without being overly assertive. The food is well priced, too. This is certainly a place for numerous repeat visits."}
{"text":"Amazing little Thai place. So glad I stumbled onto it. Had a massaman curry for lunch. Perfect sizing. Very clean and nicely presented!"}
{"text":"I'm new to town been here for 3 weeks and this is my go to place. I have come at least once the week.I absolutely love their food and everyone in here is so sweet. I have had their spicy fried rice and pad Thai. Two things that are simple dishes but most can't get right. They do. The sauce is always perfect with the right kick. Of course you can add more heat if you choose but I find their flavors to be spot on. If your in the area stop by during their lunch hours and try multiple entrees it will be worth it."}
{"text":"Got pad see eww here to go while in town. It was okay, not the best I've ever had...not even close. The girl at the from was nice but the food was flavorless. I don't think it was cooked in soy sauce or anything and they put cabbage in it which they didn't say on the menu."}
{"text":"I was quite excited to see a Thai place open up right next to one of my most favorite dance studios in the Valley!  Thai is the perfect light, yet satisfying fare after working up an appetite dancing - and this little place does a great job.  Much more atmosphere inside than you would expect from seeing it from the street, the food is also high-quality and authentic, and the owners are friendly and service-oriented.  I've been in there a few times, and have always been happy with the food.  But I would stick to the Thai dishes.  I had a wonton soup one time, and it was really salty and bland.  But you can't go wrong with their hot & sour Thai soup, their coconut soup, any of the curries, Thai tea, sticky rice - all delicious!"}
{"text":"First time lunch here on a Saturday.   Yes the place was empty except 2 other patrons.   We were greeted and seated right away.  My 10 year old son ordered the Yellow Curry with chicken, medium spice.  It was amazing! !  I ordered the Panang with chicken,  it was better then the yellow even.   We loved it.   I found the place to be clean,  service was great and food was delicious.  Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"First time try. The interior design of the Restaurant is pretty neat. I ordered Pad Thai. Food presentation was great, and it also had a huge portion. I squeezed bit of lime to add some flavor; It was outstanding! Definitely visiting this place back :)"}
{"text":"Price is amazing and food is out of this world good I would eat here every day if I could so yummy and nice staff"}
{"text":"What is the deal with the small servings of food sitting on bar stolls outside the doors of the restaurant?  The smell inside was a bit mildewy.  Was not offered any drink other than water so that is what my friend and I stuck to.  She ordered the spicy pork fried rice off the lunch menu and was highly impressed.  I asked for a bowl of Tom Kha soup even though it wasn't on the lunch menu with tofu and vegetables.  It was the smallest bowl of soup I have ever received in a thai restaurant.  For about the price I pay anywhere else it was 1/3 the size.  It was tasty though.  I was so starving after finishing it that I had to order another item from the lunch menu to eat.  I ordered the eggplant with rice and salad.  The salad was simple but with a very delightful dressing.  The eggplant was also very tasty.  I took a very small portion home for b/fast the next day.  Even the spring roll that comes with the lunch was the tiniest one I have ever seen.  So long story short.  Tasty food at super tiny serving sizes.  I don't think I wll go back."}
{"text":"This plays says what it does, and does what it says.  The Thai here is tasty.   You have to have good Thai in this part of town as there are 3 other options within a mile of here.   Their lunch menu has all of the favorites, plus a few Chinese dishes like orange chicken. For most dishes tofu is an option which I really appreciate. For lunch dishes are 6.95 (for tofu, chicken or beef) and a buck or two more for seafood options.  The meal includes Soup, or salad. I had the salad and the simple oil and vinegar dressing was great. A small veggie spring roll and rice if it is not a noodle dish. The rice comes pressed in a nice flower pattern.  I opted for the spicy noodles to tofu, Thai Hot.  I was glad that Thai hot here really means hot not just semi spicy, the dish was good, but not the best ever it seemed a bit dry and could have used a bit more sauce.  Overall this is a solid pick for the area"}
{"text":"Reasonable price with tasty food. The portion is big, I even bring my left over home. I like their tom kha, they were so generous to give us a lot of meat"}
{"text":"If you are tired of all the tasteless American foods, just come here to treat yourself something that you will not forget. The Tom Yum is beyond delicious. sharply sour and brilliantly spiced. Anything with duck is amazing as well. It is in a different league compared to Thai Basil."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch during the week based on the good reviews of the place.  Service was quick and friendly. Ordered a lunch combo (spicy noodle?) with tofu.  The soup that came with it was a little sad... it was about 2 spoonfuls, no kidding.    Rest of the food came quickly and looked much more promising than the soup, however I took a bite of the spring roll and immediately realized that this would NOT be my #1 thai place, nor #52 on the list.  The spring roll was cold (yes, cold, not even lukewarm) and so was some of the tofu throughout the dish.  The dish itself had good flavor, but the random cold pieces of tofu were a turn off to say the least.  Disappointing meal & I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Perfect lunch portions and prices. If you like it hot, go for their Thai Hot, as their regular hot isn't as hot as they advertise.   I totally love this place. Don't get turned off if you go in and there aren't any other diners. Every time I sit here to eat in the evening there are 10 people coming for Take-Out."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai in Tempe.  The green curry was a little salty last time I had it, but I had gotten medium spice, so the next time I got yellow curry, Thai hot, and it was wayyyyyyyyy better.  The lunch portions are a little small, but if you eat in you also get a salad.  Its still enough for me, but I eat the ENTIRE thing (probably seems like its small because I don't want to stop eating it! YUM!) I'm satisfied when I'm done eating, but forget leftovers (which is ok with me; I'm not a fan of the HUGE portions I've gotten over the years.)  To Jasmin (other reviewer): The smell in the restaurant is actually eggs, not mildew (making fried rice, perhaps?) I don't really like eggs, or the smell, but its not mildew. The small plates of food you refer to are traditional offerings to Buddha.  The restaurant is very traditional in their decor, which includes mirrors (reflecting on yourself inside), flowers, fruit and water offerings.  I've never been to a Thai restaurant that tries to \"up sell\" you on a drink.  If you want something other than water, order it (I suggest Thai tea...its like drinking dessert while you eat!)  Great place to get Thai...it is, indeed, Tasty!"}
{"text":"Ding Ding Ding we have a winner in the over crowded tempe thai battle royal. In a tiny town with about as many thai restaurants as gas stations this one just jumped way out ahead of the pack.  I have been looking for one thai place that just jumps out and hits all the right taste buds and reminds me of the great thai I would find in the Pacific Northwest. This one comes the closest. The massaman curry was excellent in the hot spice with a nice burn but distinct flavors still coming thru. The chicken satay was great and the peanut sauce was perfect and not just peanut butter with chilli paste like most places. I loved the eggplant dish with beef as it was the first time in a long time i got an eggplant dish where it had plenty of eggplant AND it wasnt just mush. Plus the flavor of the eggplant, basil, spices and beef all came through.  Top this all off with friendly service and perfectly reasonable prices this is a true winner. I am just sad I am .3 miles outside the deliver zone. Maybe if a offer up an arm or a leg I can get it."}
{"text":"I have only heard great things about Tasty Thai. So I was excited to try it. My last few Thai experiences have been Meh so I was hoping for more.   I ordered my usual's Pad-See-Ew, Green Curry and Eggplant. I am always in search of the best Pad-See-Ew, and while this was the highlight of my meal at Tasty Thai, it was in no way the best Pad-See-Ew I have had.   The Green Curry was almost like water, the broth was really thin and there was tons of green beans and bamboo shoots (although the bamboo shoots were shredded, not a fan). The broth was okay, but the fact that it was watery kind of ruined the whole dish.  The Eggplant was just not as good as I have had before. The actual eggplant was at times undercooked and then another pieces was a mushy mess. Just not a worthy dish.  Overall, I am probably not going to return, there are just too many Thai restaurants to continue trying one that didn't impress on the first try. Oh I got my food to go, not sure if that might have made a difference, and the left overs were just as Meh and the food was the first night."}
{"text":"Been twice now and was even better than the last. Have had the pot stickers, spring rolls, spicy nut chicken, cashew duck, eggplant beef, and all where fabulous. I haven't had good thai in a long time and this hit the spot. And my house is within their 3mile delivery area! But I would still probably make the drive as the place is nice and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"My friends at work have tried this place a few times & keep telling me about it went with them this last time. We were able to sit right down, but must have had perfect timing because it filled up pretty fast. Its a little small, but has a great atmosphere & I love all the decorations and details. The lunch menu has a pretty nice variety. And you can ask them to alter the spice level for you if you do not like it hot.  I had the Massaman Curry (so did my other 2 friends that have been here before) but we all ordered it with different levels of heat. I went with hot (not Thai hot - i wasn't sure how crazy that was yet & trust me - hot was HOT, but in a good way) It came with a choice of salad or soup & I went with the Hot & Sour soup. It was delish. It was just enough to make me want more, but not enough to fill me up and ruin my lunch. Then the curry came out and i was in Heaven! It smelled amazing, and that creamy coconut spicy broth was to die for! I even added some extra chili to it & boy it was kickin'! It was the kind of hot that comes up on you and makes you want to eat some more. The little crispy spring role that came with it was perfectly cooked & it was a nice break from the rich curry sauce. I was even able to save a little bit to take home to the husband so I can tempt him to come here with me in the future.  I will definitely be back to work my way through this Tasty menu."}
{"text":"Best thai food I've been able to find in Tempe. They're really good with takeout orders, I've never had to wait more than 15 minutes before leaving my place to pick it up. The pumpkin curry is definitely a recommendation.  I'm a rice hog so I typically order an extra side of rice, but they give you good portion with your order even if you don't unlike other places in the area."}
{"text":"I eat lunch here a couple times a week. I've had a couple different curries & they're great. Thai tea is good too."}
{"text":"Horrible!  I had pad thai, not bad.  My friend had Kung Poa.  The vegetables looked like they were from a frozen bag, the chicken was very dry and the sauce was bland.  The menu says the lunch is served with Thai spring roll.  Really?  It looked like a cheap frozen appetizer you'd find at the grocery store...Never going again."}
{"text":"I was hoping this was a great place to eat Thai food because of all the great reviews. I ate inside and the place was just okay. In a 12x20' dining room, there was 5 cameras, I don't know what that's all about.   First thing I ordered was a glass of ice water with lemon. When it was brought to me the lemons were already in the water and I picked them out to find they were almost dried up and definitely old.   I ordered the coconut soup and it tasted great but there was a lot of tuff inedible stems, some sort of leaf and raw ginger. After I picked all that out the rest tasted great. I also ordered the Pad Thai, very underwhelming and to add a better taste, I added hot sauce.  Live and learn, there are better places out there."}
{"text":"So, I was really enjoying my spicy cashew chicken take out until I found a black hair, about 4 or 5 inches in my food. Gross. Hair net. Paid for food I'm not going to eat. Bummer."}
{"text":"The best Thai in Tempe that I've found. Super fresh and delicious. Their Hot & Sour soup is wonderful, as is their yellow curry, and my friend said their Chow Mein was the best she's ever had. The only place I will go for Thai from now on. (Their lunch prices are really great, too!)"}
{"text":"After passing this place a couple of times, I wanted to eat here for my lunch break so I called the Tasty Thai to ask how long the dish would take to cook, the person that answered was very polite and she offered to set up my table and prepare the dishes so that my coworker and I would not have to wait long for our meals since our time is limited.  When we arrive our food was on the table and everything was nicely set up.  We both ordered the lunch special and had the Pad Thai with salad, they also had water with lemon and straws on the table.  This was really good food and the décor was warm and tranquil. There was music in the background and a nice waterfall on the bar they have made a nice little retreat here that you would never imagine from the outside. I will be back to Tasty Thai because the service was impeccable and the hospitality was inviting."}
{"text":"Nice little place. They're new to the area but not that new...have been around a few months. Their pad thai and spicy fried rice are great in all flavors from mild to Thai hot. Their pricing is moderate.   The owners are friendly."}
{"text":"Fresh pumpkin curry was awesome! Tons of fresh pumpkin slices IN EVERY BITE! Service was very friendly and able to run you down even while peddling away via bicycle (should one happen to leave one's credit card on the table). I will be back for more fresh ingredients soon.  Bike rack available in the same complex."}
{"text":"Need to update my reviews, I took a friend who is new to town & new to Thai food to my fav Thai lunch spot, we were there for dinner.   I'm the kind of person who notices things right away, like how they changed the front dining room around; it's just something I notice. So I looked on the wall by the bar and saw they have a B rating from Maricopa County Health Department, now if you're a foodie, you know how to access that information to see what happened, and it seems they failed their routine inspection and operating permit was immediately suspended but within 24 hours had a re-inspection, corrected the issues and where given a B rating. The fact that they corrected everything within 24 hours made me feel more at ease at staying there to eat.   Tasty Thai, your one of my fav lunch spots, but if can't get it together I'm going to find something else, let's get that rating back up to A and keep it there!"}
{"text":"**Vegetarian Friendly**  We ordered this as take-out for work for about 20 people. In my experience, when you order so much food, something is bound to get messed up. Tasty thai delivered our whole order perfectly!! Everything came labeled, so we knew exactly what it was. I personally love when restaurants do this because I'm a vegetarian so it's important to make sure I get the correct item.  I ordered the vegetable red curry with fried tofu at medium spicy, and the spice level was perfect. Tons of vegetables and tofu - it was the perfect balance. My curry was off the lunch menu so it came with a spring roll. I loved this because most places come with an eggroll, which generally isn't veggie friendly. I also had the thai tea which was the perfect beverage for my meal!  I did peak over at other dishes, and everything looked and smelled fantastic.   Group consensus: Definitely ordering from here again!   Unfortunately I didn't get any pictures, we were too hungry"}
{"text":"Ohhh emmmm geeee. There was a terrible stink in this place when we entered. It smelled like the sewer had backed up (or like someone was stewing cabbage or something). There was hardly anyone in the place and we were seated, initially, right by the washrooms. Uh, no thanks. We moved but the smell stayed with us. A beer helped numb our senses of smell somewhat.   Food was decent. Not the greatest Thai around, but decent. My lard nar was okay, but the gravy was pretty watery.   Would I go again? I'd probably pass."}
{"text":"Despite lots of misgivings about this place, the food was pretty solid. I liked my meal.  If I had eaten in, I don't know if I could have given this place more than 2 stars, and it could have been a single star. But taking it to go let me focus on just the food.  I read some reviews of this place before going to eat here, and there were plenty of good ones, interspersed with some bad ones. I decided to give the place the benefit of the doubt and try it. I ordered the spicy noodles to go. The woman on the phone was nice.  When I showed up, I was the only one, not just at the restaurant, but in the parking lot. No wonder this place doesn't get much business in the evenings--it's in an abandoned strip mall! So that wasn't a good start. When I walked in, the smell of the place was pretty nasty. It smelled of moth balls, to the point that my eyes were burning sitting in there for a few minutes. That's not good at a restaurant. As for the lay out and decorations, it seems like a decent place. But the smell! I figured I could just not eat my food if it turned out to be horrible. I paid and drove away.  When I did eat, I was pretty darn happy with the food. The food itself is more than 3 stars. I had asked for extra vegetables ($2 extra), and there were plenty in my dish. The spiciness (medium, to gauge how spicy they do things) was really nice. The flavor was excellent, and the noodles were delicious. I definitely enjoyed the dish.  I might come by here again for to go food, but I won't be staying in to eat unless there's some serious improvement inside this place."}
{"text":"It was difficult to get past the smell of the place when I opened the front door.  Growing up in oil and cattle country, the only thing I could compare the faint odor that I experienced when opening the front door was standing in a field where there was an oil well next to a feedlot.  Between the smell of manure and fresh oil, the combination is vivid and unforgettable.  Unfortunately, this was what greeted me when I walked into Tasty Thai.  I had placed an order for Som Tom, Thai hot, and an order of jasmine rice to go.   The papaya salad had all the requisite notes, lime, chile, spicy and sweet...the portion size was respectable, 2 cups of salad and 1 cup of rice...the spice came in at about 5 (makes my nose run , while 8 makes my forehead sweat and 10 brings tears to my eyes) and the rice was OK, not too sticky and not too dry.  I want to give this place higher marks because the waitress was great...and the chef came out to say hello...but that smell just took about all the desire I had for Som Tom out of my evening.  Gotta hope this changes!"}
{"text":"Had a craving for Thai food today. Decided to try this one. They have very nice atmosphere. It is very good for a romantic dinner. Order larb pork as an appatizer. It was very good. The dish presentation was beautiful and it was tasty. The pork fried rice was not too heavy on the flavor and some people might like that. Over all 4 stars."}
{"text":"03/16/13  The others are right, what's that smell?  The food was good, but that smell is surely not right. There is no way 5 stars can be achieved with that smell. At least I know they cooked my food fresh, as the fresh cooking masked the awful smell. I knew my food was off the grill, when the smell returned. I won't be back, until YELP reviews confirm the smell is gone.  Thai Hot, is hot, so be careful. I like the presentation of the beef Larb. The cabbage is not all shredded like other places. I like easy access to lime and chilli marinated beef."}
{"text":"This place is one of the better Thai places I have eaten at so far here in Arizona. It's a nice little restaurant with a good atmosphere. My only complaints so far would be the inconsistency in food occasionally and the customer service could be better."}
{"text":"i really like this place, except for the weird smell. once you get past it, the food is really good. i've gotten green curry chicken both times- first spicy and then thai hot. both were amazingly spicy but not overpowering. the portions are good sized and the service is good."}
{"text":"I love Tasty Thai! Moved my boyfriend to Tempe in January and at the end of a very long moving day, and famished, we called Tasty Thai to pick up. We've been doing the same ever since! I like the standards: tofu green curry, pad thai. Boyfriend is a big fan of their tom kha soup, masaman curry, and pad prik king.   We've tried other thai in Tempe and this is still my favorite. Thai Elephant gave me chicken in my vegetarian curry and food poisoning for both of us, all in one night. I like Thai Basil, but Tasty Thai is more consistent and the owners are really friendly.   The other reason I am motivated to write this review is that TT is always so empty, which breaks my heart since it is so... tasty! Help support a great local business, eat at Tasty Thai."}
{"text":"Tasty Thai is in fact, tasty. The boyfriend and I hit Tasty Thai for a late dinner on a Saturday night. Maybe it's just because it was late but we were the only people in the place for most of the time we were there. Which is too bad because their food is actually really good.  I ordered the broccoli beef and boyfriend ordered fried rice. I ordered mine no spice and boyfriend went for medium. Even with no spice my dish was still full of flavor. The brown sauce was quite yummy and the portion was big enough that I had leftovers. Boyfriend's medium spice fried rice was too spicy for me but he enjoyed it. His nose was running a little though so it definitely had a kick!  The atmosphere was fine. There was a bit of an odd odor though, can't quite place what it was. I might just do take out next time."}
{"text":"So yummy! I've only had the massaman curry because it's so good I always want it. Nice staff."}
{"text":"There are a lot of choices when it comes to Thai in Tempe, AZ. We visited Tasty Thai just a week after it opened, in the plaza located next to Bite-Me Subs.   Don't let the outside of this place fool you. Yes, the building could use a new paint job, but inside it is very clean and modernly decorated. I'm not sure what is it about Thai restaurants, but a majority of the ones I've been to have really nice dining areas. The interior and almost the floor plan of Tasty Thai looks very similar to Thai Basil.  Our table tried the Red Curry with Chicken, Drunken Noodles, and Tom Yum. The Red Curry was a curry soup with chicken and other vegetables which you poor rice into. A rice, curry soup. It was okay, a bit too much liquid. It had a bit of a weird smell to it when I first got it. The Drunken Noodles which somebody else at our table got, looked pretty good. The Tom Yum was quoted as being average. When you sit down you don't get a customary cup of soup that you get at some other thai restaurants. The price was average, about 6-10$ per dish, depending on what time you go.   As far as spiciness goes, we have still have yet to find a place that has an additional spice rating.. Medium, Hot, Thai Hot, and \"NUCLEAR\". I would recommend asking for Hot at Tasty Thai.   In a town that has at least 4 Thai places near by, you've got to come dressed to impress. All in all, I'd say Tasty Thai isn't bad, but it isn't the best either. Maybe everything we experienced was them trying to get their feet off the ground after opening a week earlier. If you are into Thai food, then I would recommend trying Tasty Thai, it is similar to Thai Basil in most respects. If you want the best Thai food you should go to Thai Elephant or Thai Rama (Char's), both in Tempe."}
{"text":"THE BEST!!!  I was there recently with my wife. LOVED IT! Thanks Tasty Thai!  Our waitress was very courteous, and left us alone except to take our order, re-fill our glasses etc.  Food was GREAT! Both of us LOVED it especially the FRIED ICE CREAM! Portion size was so big that we even got to-go. Prices are INCREDIBLE!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say this because I love Thai food, but I experienced how terrible Thai curry can taste. Maybe this is how they really make Thai curry in Thailand, but it was the most watery curry that didn't taste much like curry. It tasted as if I were eating rice in coconut milk... Rice and milky taste with not much other flavor is just not a good combination...  It really tasted like they poured a lot of coconut milk, then sprinkled a bit of red curry into the mix for some color. Maybe other items on the menu is awesome, but I have not tried.  Consider this review really just for their red curry; I do not wish to rate the entire restaurant badly because of the one item that I've tried...  Also, maybe it was the time of the day I went to the restaurant, but when I walked in... It was a bit...awkward..?. There were two (I presume) Thai ladies, and two caucasian gentlemen paired up.. they were... sorta cuddling as the white gentlemen talked and ate. Of course this is just a restaurant, but that first impression I got was \"did i just walk into one of those thai massage parlors?\" kinda feel... it was quite awkward for me..."}
{"text":"Walked in here for a late lunch last Saturday. Stood waiting for someone...anyone... To seat me... Or even greet me. Someone was rustling around in the back but obviously didn't see or hear me. Waited for what felt like way too long and walked out. Maybe they should invest in a bell on the door. Seriously even a $2 jingle bell would work. Lost my business and went to Thai Basil instead."}
{"text":"One of my favorite food is Thai food! Avery time I have the chance to visit a Thai Restaurant around the country when I travel (travel often for business) I Yelp and visit the  Thai restaurants with 4 stars or more.   This particular restaurant had 4 start rating, because of that I didn't bother to read the low grade postings.  Big mistake!! From the time I arrive to the restaurant, the parking lot was empty (that should have been a red flag) but because I was already there and fix on having Thai food I went in.   The restaurant smelled like it was sprayed with some sort of pesticide. The waitress was mopping, I don't think she washed her hands to bring the food.   I order as appetizer Thai spring rolls, a coconut soup and a chicken Thai stile. When they brought the food, I immediately notice the spring rolls were burned and the inside was cold! It taste it like rubber. The soup was tasteless the chicken was burned, like it was cooked in old oil or a dirty pan. The Thai sauce was bitter. Needless to say I left everything on the table.   I would highly advise NOT to come to this place. Stay away from this restaurant. It gives a bad name to all of those wonderful Thai restaurants."}
{"text":"There are so many great Thai places in my neighborhood and this one can be added to the list.  I went during their opening week and they had a screaming deal for a huge lunch special. It cost 7 bucks and some change and included a free drink. I stuck with my standard chicken pad thai and it was a treat. It wasn't very spicy and they didn't ask how spicy I wanted it, maybe I should have offered that information because the spicier the better for me. The interior is small and I would describe it as intimate. Well lit, well decorated, clean. I was politely greeted and served quickly. Definitely a place I'll be back to with more frequency."}
{"text":"Since moving to Phoenix we have been in search of good Thai food.  We have finally found it!  The owner prepares her food in a flavor packed tantalizing of taste buds!  Not sure how else to describe it.  We are regulars here and what first impressed us was the cleanliness of the whole place.  Even the bathrooms were immaculately cared for.  Now the food just keeps us coming back for more.  The owner is so nice too.  She remembered us after our first visit and always visits and likes to know what you think of her food.  I especially love the coconut soup.  It's a must try even if you just try a cup of it.  It's packed with flavor so a cup might just be enough for you."}
{"text":"Just got back from Thailand and was craving some good tasting authentic Thai food. Found this place on Yelp so I thought I would give it a try. Glad I did. Extremely friendly service and food that rivaled anything I ate while in Bangkok or any other city I traveled. Family run by Thai people and the mother cooks. Like going to someone's house and having their mother cook for you. You can taste the love, and the legitimate quality in the dishes and the ingredients. Reasonably priced for Thai food in the states. Similar to other places in that respect. I would recommend you go here now. Quiet, nice decor. Good for a romantic meal with your significant other or a quick solo lunch. Try the Pad Gra Prow chicken (Spicy Chicken with Basil) or Pad Kee Mao (Large fried noodle)"}
{"text":"Quite aptly named! This small little restaurant serves up big portions of delicious Thai favorites. I went in to indulge in one of their lunch specials, a panang curry with seafood ($10.95). It didn't take too long for them to make my meal and I was in and out in no time.  The curry came with a small spring roll, a nice little appetizer, with good crunch, filled with veggies. The curry was a sizable portion, filled with fresh veggies, lime leaf, bamboo shoots, and a generous amount of seafood. The seafood itself was tender and perfectly cooked. I asked for it Thai hot and it was the right amount of spiciness for me! It definitely packed a punch. It might not be good for a lunch if you have to work right afterwards though, since your nose might be running a bit from the spiciness.  Service was good and there are frequent regulars that come by for lunch. They were greeted warmly. I was thanked after I received my to-go meal and the cashier said she hoped I enjoyed the meal.  I'll definitely be here again to try more tasty dishes."}
{"text":"Some friends and I stopped by Tasty Thai for lunch. One of them recently discovered it and suggested it as a nearby option. There are several to choose from in that area and I have been to a couple of others. One thing I liked is the location was close to work and thanks to many of the businesses in the shopping center being out of business; there were plenty of places to park - unlike trying to find a spot at Thai Basil. If I could continue to benchmark against Thai Basil, I felt cramped while seated there, but Tasty Thai was spacious and comfortable. It was also much quieter than other places.  The food arrived very quickly. We each had a lunch special - which consisted of the entrée, rice, Thai spring rolls and soup or salad. The drinks and soup arrived first, but as soon as we finished the egg drop soup, the meal came out. Each ordered something different- I know one was the Pad Gra Prow, which I understood was spicier and more flavorful than other similar restaurants; another ordered the Pad Prik King, and that was tasty as well. A third member of our party went with the Kung Pao from the \"More Asian Style\" selection, and the fourth person had the Red Curry with Tofu. I ordered the Masaman Curry Chicken - incredible! The flavors of coconut milk and tamarind were present, soft potatoes, onion and a sweet (but not too sweet) curry. It was one of the more flavorful plates I have had at any restaurant.  Based on my initial visit, I will definitely be back. Of the Thai restaurants I have tried in town, this new restaurant tops the list. And, as an added benefit if you live within a 3 mile radius and place a minimum order of $20 - they deliver."}
{"text":"Small place, good Pad Thai, reasonable prices.  The salad dressing is salty, but amazing.  The eggroll was pretty dang good, too.  Don't let the interior throw you.  The food is worth it."}
{"text":"I can't believe we've been by this place so many times and never stopped until now.  We've certainly been missing out.  This place is fantastic.  Not only is the service great, the food is fresh and delicious.    We stopped for a late lunch and only one other couple was inside at the time.  The server promptly provided our drinks and took our order.  She was friendly and service was fast.  We were surprised at how good our food was.  Not only was it good but also the lunch price was excellent.    All we could say when we left is that we'd be back.  And, we will."}
{"text":"I have gone here from time to time and I have to say this place has the best Thai food in Arizona. This is a smaller family business from the looks of it. Everytime I have went their I encounter very nice staff that are quick and efficient. The food is hot and fresh and their food consists of traditional Thai heat. Thai hot is hot! I love heat but medium is a perfect flavor and enough heat for me. I typically change it up but the Thai fried rice with chicken and a medium heat is delicious, same with their wonton soup.The restaurant itself is very clean and the ambience is nice! Highly recommend this establishment!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed a dinner here while traveling with a coworker. It wasn't very busy, even for a Thursday night. However the food was fantastic. Started out with Thai rolls. They took a whole to come out but were worth the wait. Then I got #60 on the menu (I can't remember the exact name but it was a noodles dish with shrimp, fried eggs, tomatoes and spinach). Very good.  One important thing to note: their 'hot scale' starts at medium, hot, very hot. I ordered hot thinking that was their medium. Boy was I wrong. Hot means hot hot hot HOT! Ouch!"}
{"text":"I have to say I'm very particular about my Thai. I've had my share, know what I like, so I'm definitely picky when it comes to my curry. What I will say about Tasty Thai is that I like the value-for-money on their lunch combos. The price is just too rightt! What I dislike is the lack of flavor.  I've noticed that a lot of Thai restaraunts here in the PHX valley seem to lack any zest.. There doesn't seem to be much flavor in the food. Having found a place in Tempe that I LOVE for flavor (5 ra-cha), I can't give this place any higher than 3 stars, even though the server is delightful (although slow) and the ambience isn't half bad."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the opportunity to check out another local Thai restaurant in Tempe.  ASU is out for the Holiday break, so everyone in Tempe needs the business.  That was true here too!  We arrived around 530 on a Friday night and we were the only ones there the whole time.  I ordered the combo appetizer platter ($12.95) for my entree, asking for peanut sauce in addition to the sweet and sour sauce that comes with it.  It cost an extra dollar, but it was worth it to me for the ability to vary the flavors. It said it was a light batter and that was true.  Everything on the platter was done perfectly.  My partner got a smaller portion of the Tom Kha soup (5.95).  I tasted it and it was tart-er than I like and thinner.  But the overall taste was A-OK and appreciated by my partner (but the flavors of the soup were not addicting like some others are).  The other entree chosen was Sweet and Sour Pork and that was good and wasn't too hot.  The service was fine and the server filled our water every time when needed.  I wasn't really in the mood to try the curries.  Funny ain't it?  I really wished for a curry sampler... something I've never seen anywhere, probably an absurd thing to ask for... (and I didn't ask for it).   Wouldn't that be great, to be able to try 4 different curries, to be able to find one you really like?  OH WAIT!  That's called having 4 people at the table ordering one of each!!!  What a concept!  LOL   Yeah I crack myself up sometimes.    Anyway, back to the review...     I am really really glad I went to try Tasty Thai out.  I might try them again to see if I like Yellow Curry or Pumpkin Curry.  My partner isn't really interested in going back.  Too bad it didn't pass our Tom Kha test."}
{"text":"Muy agradable lugar para disfrutar de rica comida, precio accesible y muy limpio. Puedes disfrutar de una agrada le velada con alguien especial o puedes aprovechar la formalidad para una comida de negocios. Los precios están en el promedio y la porción justa para satisfacer me gustan los lugares estrictos con la limpieza y este cumple perfectamente"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. We order here from work so much that the people know our names and our typical orders.   I have had their Chicken Yellow and Green curry (yellow is by far my favorite). My friend has their Red Curry Duck. It is also really good.   Their Thai Iced tea is also very awesome it helps the burn...and believe me if you have never had Thai food DO NOT ORDER SPICY...no matter how much you think you can take it....you can't. Build up to it.  Love this place and go here at least 3-4 times a week if I can afford it!!"}
{"text":"Tasty Thai is fabulous, is the best in the Phoenix metro area, AND is as good as any Thai restaurant in the San Francisco Bay Area!  It's clean and has a pleasant atmosphere, while providing great service."}
{"text":"Lovely small restaurant located in Tempe, Everything there is superb ! The owner is there all the time and she is super nice! I would say this is in the top two Best Thai Restaurants that Arizona has to offer!"}
{"text":"Food is great, it's a nice little place, very clean and cozy, the service is awesome, they can do a bit better within their salad, it's super fresh but it's a very salty Italian dressing..other then that it's a very good Thai restaurant. You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"I walked in at 6:30 pm on a Tuesday a little scared, because it was empty inside.  I had just seen a guy leaving with what was probably take out which made me feel a little better.  In the end the place had good reviews, I was hungry, and I rationalized the emptiness of the inside as this being a lunch spot.  The lady at the front greeted me shortly upon entering and asked me where is like to sit.  Since the blinds were drawn it didn't matter and I sat around the corner from the front door.  This always helps with temperature control.  After seating me she came back fairly fast and I ordered pumpkin curry with chicken, extra mild.  The wait for the food was reasonable, not too long but not super fast.  This made me feel better that they actually cooked the food instead of serving me something pre-made that was sitting around back.  The pumpkin curry was delicious and satisfying.  I though I was going to want more seeing the bowl, but I couldn't finish it and took left overs back with me.  Overall a good experience even with the scary empty restaurant at dinner time."}
{"text":"We haven eaten at most of the Thai restaurants in the East Valley and can declare that Tasty Thai is in the top 25%. Upon entering and seeing that we were the only customers on a Saturday night brought upon some concern. It must be the location because there is no reason for diners not to be filling up all the tables. The menu is extensive so even picky eaters should find something to their liking. We started with the Tom Yum soup w/squid. Perfectly cooked and savory. Companion had the Red Curry Shrimp mild heat. Very flavorful with veggies and 6 shrimp. I had the Pad Prick King Beef medium heat. The spice had a kick but not too much. Could have used a bit more beef though. The decor is a bit eclectic but the place is very clean with well made and comfortable tables and chairs. Service was very good. Make sure and save room for dessert. The Thai Custard topped with homemade coconut ice cream was the ending of a very good meal. The freshness of the ice cream helped to offset the sweetness of the custard. I can't wait to visit again and try the Pumpkin Curry."}
{"text":"I had the medium green chicken curry, it was perfect and so yummy. My fiance had the drunken beef noodles awesome. The jasmin tea is great too, the service is good but a little slow but its busy so its expected."}
{"text":"Seriously Tasty Thai serves tasty Thai... I've been to a ton of Thai restaurants around the valley (6 of the Thai Basil chains, Yupha's, Thai'd Up, Thaiger, and others which aren't worth remembering by name) and Tasty Thai is by far my favourite. Small quaint atmosphere, always courteous service, perfect for a casual lunch or a nice evening date. The food is amazing, all of it. I've had at least a dozen different dishes. The flavor, richness of the spices and in-house presentation is always 5-star worthy. The bathrooms are clean (I'm assuming the women's restroom is as clean or cleaner than the men's, which is always sparkling), and the floor and tables are always pristine. I highly highly highly recommend Tasty Thai to anyone that enjoys Thai food and especially to anyone that is unsure if they'd like Thai food for a first time. You will NEVER be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I really like this place.  Been here quite a few times and I have some favorites, but everything I've tried has been delicious.  The orange chicken is surprisingly good and their curries are just what you'd hope for.  Nice little restaurant with friendly staff and great food - plus it's literally 30 seconds away from me"}
{"text":"I come here about once a month, sometimes twice. I have seen it packed over lunch, which is why I get there after 1pm. I am a big fan of the red curry as well as green. My lunch pals usually order something else and have had no complaints. The price is great also, around $8 for the lunch. Enjoy."}
{"text":"All I have to say is WOW! This place is EXCELLENT!   All the dishes we had were extremely fresh, authentic, and DELICIOUS!    My favorite pot stickers EVER.  The skin is super thin, tender, not greasy, mostly steamed encased around a very light, delicate dumpling that makes me want to order 2 next time. 6 is just not enough, they are tiny, but oh so delectable! The sauce is perfectly balanced of sweet, spicy, and tangy and does not overpower the pot sticker.  It also comes with a thin airy, crispy (rice chip?) underneath the pot stickers that give it an extra texture with scallions scattered about.  MMMMMMmmmmm.  The green curry is more brothy than others than other's that I have had, but no matter...It is delicious with bits of vegetable, and whatever meat you prefer..we got chicken.  I love sopping it up with rice and trying to eat it with chopsticks.  You may need a spoon :)   The eggplant and chicken stir fry is also fabulous.  The asian eggplants are cooked to perfection. Their sauces are spot on.    BEST Coconut ice cream!  It is light, fluffy, icy, dreamy, pea-nutty, coconut cloud confection that makes my mouth water!  It is not sickly sweet sticky artificial coconut tasting at all...Predominant coconut flavor is not my favorite and I LOVE THIS!   Even if you don't like curries, there is plenty of food here that will make you a fan!  This is a mom and pop kind of place, they are really nice.  It's a trek for us, but definitely worth the drive!"}
{"text":"finally tried this place....  Location is a bit small inside, but the decor very relaxing..  Other post about a stench,, did not smell anything fowl on my visit..   Greated by the hostess/cashier, very nice and casual...   Ordered the Pad see ew.  Veggies very fresh, broccoli cooked perfect with a tad crunch in the middles. flavor was pretty good and a few extra ingredients that i dont find in other places.. The only negative about the dish, was there were more ingredients than noodles, iw was about an even mixture of all indredients, so the proportion of noodles to other items was off.. Another Positive was the amount of shrimp.. for the small dish i am use to a couple to maybe 4 shrimps, (small ones at that) but these were decent sized shrimp and about 6 or 7 ish... NICE.. Cook also came out and asked how it was,,, Delish,,,   When in the area, i wuill stop on by n try the next dish...  I would not drive more than 3 miles out of the way for it. Eat in or Take out,, Def eat in n relax,,, plus AZ summer its hot outside,, stay in the AC  would be 3.5 stars,, but not 4 so opted to remain at 3.... (4 to me would be a go out of your way for it... 5 would be sending donations so they never ever close)"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place! It's my number one. The owner and staff are very nice. the food is so Dang good, I always wanna order seconds. Have to eat medium spice because their food is traditional Thai spicy. I recommend the panang curry, eggplant with chicken and the pad woon sen."}
{"text":"This place has awesome authentic Thai food. I spent 4 months in Phoenix and I found myself at Tasty Thai many many times for lunch and dinner. Thai fried rice was moist and full of flavor. Pad Thai was full of real authentic Thai flavor, spicy with a hint of lime. I'm Asian and I tried many different Asian and Thai restaurant in Phoenix. This place was the best."}
{"text":"So I went here with a friend for lunch yesterday and at first I thought it was going to be terrible, because when we walked in it smelled real bad in the restaurant. Thankfully, they lit some incense and the smell went away. I ordered the spicy noodles with chicken and my friend got the pad see ew. We both got salad with it because the soup was egg drop, which I'm not a fan of. The salad was just a rabbit salad from a bag, but the dressing was good. I really enjoyed my noodles. They were spicy and had lots of veggies, which I always like. I thought the spring roll had too much dough and was a little chewy... not awesome. My friend thought hers was ok... but it was weird that they didn't even offer to make it spicy like at most thai places. It did have a good sweet flavor, but it was odd that she couldn't order it with some heat. Overall, the place is good and I would probably come back."}
{"text":"Good, food, great service.  I had the yellow curry chicken, hot.  It was the lunch special and it came with a soup and spring roll.  Very delish.  I also tried the Thai Coffee and it is probably the best coffee I have ever had.  I have been to the Tasty Thai probably 10 times now and have not been disappointed."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm. My my my... Best Curry in town!  This is a diamond in the rough. You don't know how good it really is, until you put the fork in your mouth. I've passed by this place for years! Because of the area and the name, I never thought twice about giving it a try.  Thanks to a good friend, you know who you are. I've found my go to place when I'm tired of Chipotle, which is my liiiife.   When you come in the decor is contemporary (newly renovated) upscale with a nice balance of cultural decor as well. It's a small dining area so it's not good for large groups.  I've tried a few dishes here and they have all been great, the Panang Curry, the Green Curry, the Yellow Curry, The Pad Se-ew, The Drunken Noodle, and the Orange Chicken.   The vegetables are crisp and fresh, the noodles aren't overly greasy like I've found at other Thai restaurants, very light grease. The flavors marriage together perfectly, I mean I'm hooked.  The staff is good, there is one lady there that isn't very consistent. She never checks on the table or refills water, she doesn't smile much, she does't bring the credit card when you're done without asking for it. The place can do without her to be honest.   However the owner is nice and the older lady her name starts with a T is super nice as well.  Great place for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"The best Thai food in Tempe, hands down. Tasty Thai always puts me in a good mood. The service is amazing, and they continually recognize me whenever I visit (i don't know if that is a good or bad thing :P). I like my Thai food pretty hot, and they're not afraid to pack the heat!!"}
{"text":"The portions were HUGE! Pretty good overall. I will say, it's not my favorite (Palee's Crown, flavor-wise is) but if you're in Tempe and want to get your Thai grub on --- This is an excellent spot : )"}
{"text":"After seeing Tasty Thai on the PBS show Check Please, I decided I needed to try it for myself. I went about an hour before closing on Saturday, so there was plenty of seating available. The first thing that struck me was that the restaurant was very clean. It is always great to see that in any restaurant.  The waitress was very friendly and took my order quickly. I ordered the red Thai curry chicken and asked for it to be mild. While I do like Thai food, I am not one seeking to be wiped out by something super spicy. I was very pleased that the curry came at the perfect level of spice for my tastes. The curry contained a good selection of fresh vegetables, and the chicken was cooked to perfection. There was enough to take home for a second meal.  I really enjoyed the food at Tasty Thai, thought the service was attentive, and appreciated the cleanliness of the restaurant. If you happen to be on the east side and are craving Thai food, definitely have lunch or dinner there."}
{"text":"I love how this place used to be a hole in the wall Mexican Fast Food joint.! They really did a good job at decorating and making it feel welcoming.  The staff is nice and the lunch specials are really affordable.  I've had the pad thai and pad see ew...BOTH excellent and tasty!!   Only downside is that they don't deliver. Boo to that!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing just the right ammount of spice i had the green curry, for those who think they like spice id go with medium so you can taste the food the girl friend got number 58 dont knowhow to spell it but it was amazing def coming back again great firt time experience."}
{"text":"Great little Thai food joint. I tried their Panang curry with Tofu hotter than Thai hot. Though it wasn't as hot as I was expecting, it was pretty tasty. I wish they had their starter soup with Veggie broth just so a lot more people can have it.   It kind of frustrates me when I go to a Thai food place and food tastes sweet. Till now, it was only La's Thai that made the cut...Tasty Thai is a close second."}
