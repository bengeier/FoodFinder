{"text":"It was terrible for delivery. It was actually good for a few months and now the quality just went down to almost at the level I don't want to order from there anymore. I called for a large orderof padthais and 2 seafood Padthais do no have any mussles in them. It was the only thing I was waiting for. I walked in the place on a Monday and it was empty so I asked for drinks. The guys was like :\"it's...uh one...\" And the lady who sat behind him jumped in to say \"two dollars\". Wow they just try to upsale me I was annoyed so I left. Never again real Thai on."}
{"text":"Keen for low-quality imitation Thai food delivered with poor service? If so, here's your place.  With so many places in the city offering excellent Thai and SE Asian cuisine at reasonable prices accompanied by proper customer service, I can't imagine why one would want to waste their money at a place with shabby decor, at turns indifferent and dishonest service and food that's sole redeeming quality is the sheer quantity given."}
{"text":"Just moved into the area my husband and I were starving.  We both had the lunch specials one pad Thai and one green curry.  Food was decent and hit the spot I didn't expect more.  The service was excellent though and the restaurant itself looked clean and was comfortable."}
{"text":"After a long day at work I was greeted by my beautiful wife who informed me that she had placed an order for Thai. The excitement on my face was plain for all to see and the sheer joy that soon I would be feasting on Thai food was almost uncontrollable. The only downside was that there was a one hour wait, but after the day I had had, one hour was fine by me. As I sat there, salivating in anticipation building up small puddle on the floor, it suddenly dawned on me that one hour had passed and there was no sign of our Thai food. I stood up to the get the phone when I slipped on the salivation puddle I had created. My wife came in to see me in clear distress so she reached out Real Thai ON and was informed that it was a little bit late so please hold tight. I picked myself up off the floor and returned to the couch where I decided it would be the best place for me to conserve energy until the food arrived. I couldn't contain myself and the salivation continued. Fast forward another 30 minutes and my small puddle was now a child sized swimming pool. I picked up the phone and through the drool dribbling down my face I conversed with the operator who informed me that the delivery driver was on his way. Despite being 30 minutes passed their delivery time I simply could not muster up the energy to fuss. I sat there for what seemed like an eternity...another 30 minutes passed...two hours now and still no sign of food. I stood up and dove off my sofa executing a perfect reverse 2  1/2 somersaults with 2  1/2 twists in pike dive into the Olympic sized swimming pool I had created on the floor. I swam across the living room to the phone and using every bit of strength I had left I called the number again. This time, after two hours of waiting I was told that the driver was just leaving. My wife overheard the commotion and took the phone from my frail and weak grasp. Irate that not only is the food still not here after two hours but also that the operator had lied to us 30 minutes ago saying the driver was on his way when in fact he hadn't even left. They offered us 10% off our bill which is more of a joke than a good \"knock-knock\". We cancelled the order immediately and ordered a pizza....which arrived from a location further away in just 30 minutes. All in all, its safe to say we will never be ordering from there again, despite me perfecting my diving skills in the process."}
{"text":"#YYZ  For a long time I have been searching for good Thai food delivery in the Dixon area by the Toronto airport. This is it. I have had fake Thai with weird veggie combos and watered down sauces. I was so amazed by the delicious creamy green curry chicken and spicy basil beef. Great quality, real Thai spices and very satisfying. Definitely recommend!! Ordered online via Justeat.ca. Just give an hr for delivery. It took 48 mins. Food was hot, fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Very good quality. We did takeout.   Pad Thai: very good. Appropriate amount of tamarind paste was used (unlike many otherThai restaurants where tomato paste is dominant). The chicken pieces were tender & not overcooked. There was a reasonable amount of meat & vegetables to noodle ratio, again unlike many other Thai restaurants.   Lemon grass soup: Excellent! rich & flavourful.  Beef devil: very good, but would be better fresh & not as takeout. Deep fried beef coating doesn't travel well. Will try a sauteed beef dish next time.  Clean.  Friendly staff."}
{"text":"The good was terrific! No fancy sign or decor, but the food was delicious, especially the red curry chicken!!"}
{"text":"No doubt the food here is good. I have only had takeout from this place so I can't comment on the service.   I have ordered the beef devil and pad Thai and both are delicious. I ordered the beef devil extra spicy and it did not disappoint. I love spicy and this was perfect.   I took advantage of their Monday special... Buy one get one free pad Thai. Great value for a yummy dinner.   When I go in for my pick up they are very friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Pineapple red curry shrimp was wonderful, service was fast and friendly. Would def come back again. Very casual!!!"}
{"text":"I've never had malaysian pad thai before so didn't know what to expect when I headed in with a group on. The restaurant (I've been there a few times now) never seem to have more than 1-2 tables filled, hopefully most of their orders are pick ups or delivery.   I have had their pad thai (Monday special=buy 1 get 1 free), the texture is good and the taste is flavorful but there's way too much noodles vs meat/tofu ratio. I almost wish for a smaller portion so I don't have to waste the noodles. 3 meals and I still haven't finished the take out box. Good to share for sure!  The lemon grass soup was delicious the first time I had it in restaurant with a lot of fresh veggies and clear broth taste. The second time was via pick up and it tasted just like salty water with a few little chunks of cabbage floating around.   The appetizer plate we got was delicious, fresh rolls, mango salad, fried mushroom spring rolls and shrimp chips!   I'd go back again to try their roti (never heard of malasian roti) and curry!  The woman who i think is the owner is very friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"We've gotten delivery from them about 5 times now and everything has been just stellar.  Food arrives within 45 mins, is piping hot, the portions are HUGE, and everything is better than I would expect, every time.  Really surprising how well their Thai food is seasoned, food isn't too greasy, they aren't afraid to kick the heat up a bit, and know how to make every part of the dish taste good, from the rice, to the veggies to the proteins.  Great stuff, highly recommend. I wake up at nights now craving their curry rice."}
{"text":"This was such a nice surprise. Place was very clean, just under new management. Golden curry chicken was just tad on a sweet side but that's how they usually come. Waitress was pleasant, alert, answered my Q's on the menu very well. All lunch specials were $10. True, I had to wait a bit but food was fresh, tender, satisfying. It's actually quite a bit rather than what the pic shows. Couldn't find one thing wrong with the place. There were no people likely because of the late lunch time, but maybe they just don't know. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Ordered two classic RTO pad thai (shrimp and chicken) and one green curry chicken  takeout. Pad thai was completely coated in oil and ketchup, not a trace of pad thai sauce. No peanuts and almost no chicken, honestly one of  the worst pad thai I've ever experienced. Definitely not worth $11.50.  Green curry was very tasty with a strong coconut flavor (would recommend over their pad thai)! Service was polite, but the woman did not give us any napkins for our food. This wouldn't be my first choice for malay/thai food, but if you do go, give the curry a shot."}
{"text":"I have lived in this area for almost 3 years and have seen many restaurants come and go, but Real Thai On is so yummy that I hope everyone supports it so it will stick around! I'm not usually a fan of pad thai, but decided to taste my friend's shrimp pad thai and it was so good! I've also tried the chicken one and it was good too. My favourite dish is the mango chicken. The beef satay was a bit dry, but the chicken satay was really good. Last night I wanted to try a tofu dish so we ordered the crispy fried tofu... soooo good! Even someone who does not eat tofu tried it and said it was good. They are a bit slow during dinner hours, but the food is so good that's its worth the wait and the staff is super friendly which also helps."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout from here a few times. The curry and the peanut chicken was good. The appetizers specially the sate beef was dry and chewy. The coconut soup was yummy and so is the coconut rice. It's decent tai takeout"}
{"text":"I went at first for the monday special methinks. 2 padthai for the price of 1. it was ok, but i've had better pad thai, even outside of thailand. then i went back to eat dinner there, and the Malaysian beef curry was yummy...tho i'm still trying to find the potatoes that should be in there somewhere. and my date said his sweet n sour chicken was good.  Note the brown rice is small for just 1 person, but the jasmine rice is bigger.. The lady is friendly too."}
{"text":"Let's be honest, if I don't get food poisoning tomorrow I'm going to be surprised.  I am so disappointed, I had really high expectations based on good reviews, to no avail.  Fried rice - way too spicy, pad Thai - sickly sweet, satay skewers - over cooked leather and too sweet peanut sauce,  wings - below, spring rolls - undercooked dough with good filling, average, cashew chicken - actually delicious but after spending 50 dollars on food that only one thing was edible - annoyed"}
{"text":"Really awesome place. Food is delicious. Staff are very friendly. Have had delivery from here a couple of times, never had a problem. I hope this place does well, there is a lot of restaurant turnover in this community. Would be nice if this place is bumping every night."}
