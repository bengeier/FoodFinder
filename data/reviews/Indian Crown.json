{"text":"Had take out and was unimpressed. Karahi gohst was bland and tasteless. Chicken tikka was better but not great. Naan was fresh and well made."}
{"text":"This was a truly bizarre experience.  I've never said this about a food place, but this store actually has too nice a website.  I was hunting for a good Indian restaurant close to me and this place popped up on Google.  Only the website doesn't tell you, Indian Crown is actually just a storefront inside a mall, one unit in a food court.  When I got there, I got another unappealing sight -- one of the employees reaching up to a high shelf, with his jeans slouching down almost giving us a sight of a plumber-style butt crack.  Sorry, fellas...this is really not acceptable for a food establishment.  The weird thing is, the food is actually quite good.  I ordered my usual, the lamb korma, and not only is it less expensive than other places, but the portion is actually quite decent in size and tastes great.  The lamb is tender, and while the sauce is a bit on the sweet side, it's also creamy and goes with rice very well.  I actually saved up the sauce and used it for a second meal after bringing it home."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed with take-out i bought from here. The palak paneer tasted like it was prepared many days ago. The rice was okay. Butter chicken tasted sub-par and one-dimensional. My co-worker had the goat curry which he said was stale and had to throw it away more than half un-eaten."}
{"text":"This place is great! Stopped by for a quick lunch and was really thrilled with the customer service and food! I have food sensitivities and had no problem speaking with the staff to find something suitable. I loved my experience so much I ordered delivery a week later and was just as impressed! They're now my favorite Indian place :)"}
{"text":"Had the lunch special including one meat and two vegetable and had butter chicken, rice and chick peas. Naan bread also came with it. Butter chicken was flavourful and delicious and the chick peas were spicy and nice. Got this all for $7 in what can be an otherwise pricy area. Good value for the money."}
{"text":"Delicious food made in house in their own tandoori oven. Naan was flaky and buttery. Curry goat was delicious as was their daal. Yum!  $7 lunch special. $9 dinner special. Includes one near, one veggie, rice, naan and salad. Ask the chef for some of his homemade hot sauce!"}
{"text":"Food didn't taste like indian food. Butter Chicken & tika masala tastes like ketchup."}
{"text":"Lunch special is a bargain at $7 and the Butter Chicken/Chick pea combo will definitely fill you up. The Butter Chicken is so creamy and the chick peas have a little spice to them and the naan is always made fresh when I order. I'll def keep coming back."}
{"text":"What trully makes this place awesome is the awesome people that work here! Every time I've been here, they've always been so generous with their portions and offer additional snacks for free on the house! The food itself is delicious and extremely satisfactory at that price point. I'm a big fan of the butter chicken dinner combo and especially the pakoras!!"}
{"text":"I ordered food from this place via foodora and the food arrived steaming hot!! Naan seemed like it was just made. I ordered butter chicken and Chana masala and they were both very tasty. Everything seemed so fresh! Definitelyu going to order again!"}
{"text":"Amazing tasty lamb curries,decent price take out place.....I highly recommend the palak paneer."}
{"text":"I don't get how this is rated so high. Even for a food court restaurant it's pretty bad. The butter chicken lacks flavour, it's just ketchup and heavy cream. The meat was not fresh at all. I would give it 1 star at least for the naan."}
{"text":"Are you freaking kidding me? Restaurant? I ordered food from uber eats thinking that it's actually a restaurant! The food came in and I had guests. My guest found an insect in her veggie biryani!!!! I called to tell them about it, guess what? The guy answering the phone said i got the wrong number!!!! Next time he called me crazy! I had to take uber to go there to show them what had happened( another $20 for uber) he called me crazy again and said that I had put the insect in there myself or the uber eat driver must have done it!!! He had the nerves to tell me that I was doing it all for free food. I had spent $100 on food and on top of that $20 for uber ride just to get there! I started making calls in front of their unit( not a restaurant) Which was filthy as you can see in the pictures, when he saw that I'm going to get someone there cops or consumer rights department he started throwing food out! I was so shocked and was just looking at them in disbelief!!!!! They started sweeping the floors and washing the dishes. I did a smart thing and started recording them and taking pictures which was sent and filed with the ministry of government and consumer services. Not only they gave me my guests and my 2 year old contaminated food they were also rude and called me craThis place won't be open too long."}
{"text":"Delicious Indian food at excellent prices. Unfortunately it was too spicy both times I tried their lunch special. I will try a la carte and ask for medium spice."}
{"text":"Update:   Have been coming here regularly as it's one of the only Indian restaurants in the area and it really deserves a bump up to 4 stars. I usually get the dinner special which I believe is $9 and it comes with rice, one main dish, one vegetable, an appetizer and a little salad which is usually just some lettuce leaves. This special is great value but you'll pretty much get the same selections from the hot plate each time you order which aren't bad at all, just not as much variety and not as fresh. I recently tried an order of the mattar paneer which is one of my favourite Indian food dishes and it was surprisingly delicious. After I ordered, the gentleman working there started cooking my dish fresh. The outcome was really good and for the price and portion I'll probably be ordering off the main menu from now on. The portion is large and packed with green peas and paneer cheese, the flavour is great, I like it a bit saltier usually but it's still really good and fresh tasting. Also, the last few times I've come, they make the naan fresh in an actual tandoor oven they have built into the stove in the little cooking area, those details make this place worth noticing.   I'd definitely recommend Indian crown for a quick way to satisfy those Indian food cravings!     I have been here a couple times now and have had mixed experiences but I'll chalk that up to them being new.   The food is actually pretty good and if you get the lunch/dinner specials it's a decent price as well.  They have an extensive menu but only showcase a few dishes per day. We've asked about ordering items not on display and they said they can still make them. We've seen them remove buckets of food from a fridge which makes me believe the food is made ahead and stored until someone orders.   We've had the lunch ($7)and dinner special ($9) and unfortunately for $2 more the dinner size is the exact same as the lunch size. Try to go before the lunch special ends as it's the same portion for lunch and dinner; dinner will just cost you a bit more.   I have tried the eggplant, beef curry, Chana masala, butter chicken and aloo gobi and it was all pretty good. The butter chicken is definitely above average and I really liked their eggplant as well. The first time we came here, we got the most stale quarter of a piece of naan with the lunch special which kind of turned us off but we were still impressed with the taste of the food. The second time we went, the naan was actually freshly prepared in what appears to be an actual tandoor oven in the small little food court spot, this time it was fluffy, crispy and delicious. The \"salad\" is really a couple shreds of lettuce and a slice of tomato. The food is the reason I'll keep coming back here as well as the kind service. I'd take this place over similar options like Amaya express which I'm always quite disappointed with and it tends to be pricier.   The gentlemen working at the takeout spot are super nice. They seem to be proud of their food and will offer to give some sauce from a different dish so you can try other items. One time he almost forgot to charge us and he to remind him that we hadn't paid yet.   Overall I will be back, the food is good, consistency can be improved but, again, this is a food court so expectations can't be the highest. I look forward to trying some other dishes they have!"}
{"text":"We ordered from here through UberEats. We ordered Naan - garlic and plain, tandoori chicken, aloo ghobi, aloo paratha, chicken briyani and eggplant Bharta. I absolutely LOVED everything however the chicken tandoori did not taste fresh. It was very dry and not very tasty. My favorite was the eggplant and the naan was absolutely perfect."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place!  It's a tasty option for Indian food in an area of town with barely any Indian food. Also, it's not too oily--I've been to a couple Indian places that used way too much oil. Take out or eating in the food court only though! My roommates and I have ordered from both the hot table and from the fresh menu. A lot of the hot table items (at least the ones I get) are medium level of spice. If you ask them for a fresh dish, they'll adjust the spiciness for you.   Their hot table lunch combo (1 meat, 1 veg, palao/rice, lettuce, and naan) is $8, so super affordable. Their dinner combo is $9, and it comes with a pakora and a gulab jamun as well. I usually get the vegetarian options and am super happy with them. Ask to have some of their homemade tamarind/sweet and sour sauce for your lettuce and rice! It's super sweet, like a thin jam, but it's delicious--just add a little bit. I usually don't like sweet and sour sauce but I love it here.   I appreciate that their rice is always properly cooked: not too soft with nice separate grains. It shows they know how to treat their rice!   If you order naan separately, they will make it for you fresh rather than the thinner, crispier hot table ones.  My favourite dish is their yellow dal!   A couple potential drawbacks:   -the makhani/butter paneer and chicken is in a  very creamy, very sweet, not spicy sauce. This is the crowd pleaser for picky kids and grandparents. Personally, I think it tastes good, but if you want something more complex/savory/spicy/traditional, try a madras or tikka masala.   -the paneer dishes don't come with much paneer, presumably because paneer is expensive. Maybe go for a veg or meat.  -The biryani is stir fried rather than cooked using the dum/closed pot method. It's still super tasty though!"}
