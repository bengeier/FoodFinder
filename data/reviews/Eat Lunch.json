{"text":"SAVE YOUR MONEY!

I work in this area, and it's one of the only places to grab lunch or breakfast in the Wingold/Tycos area. 

I gotta be honest here- the management does NOT care IN THE SLIGHTEST about satisfying their customers. I think they changed owners a few months ago- and they were very sweet and accommodating. The new management there is entitled, rude, and do not know how to run a business. 

Their MEGA- overpriced menu should have been the first red flag. One time they tried to charge me $5 for a bagel with cream cheese and told me I was wrong when I asked about it. Then I had to do the math myself and present it to them (came to $2.29 or something with taxes). Did they apologize for attempting to overcharge me then told me I was lying about it? No. He rolled his eyes and cashed me out. Clearly trying to pull a fast one. 

I reluctantly have gone back a few times (like I said, there is not a lot of choices in this area).  The other day I went in and ordered a sandwich. I asked what was on it, she mentioned 4 ingredients, and I said sure I'll have it. 

Got back to work and it had been PACKED with cilantro. I couldn't eat it. (If you also hate cilantro you know it RUINS a meal if there is too much). For an $8 sandwich, I walked back over and asked them if I could have something else, since I did not know this was going to be a cilantro sandwich, and it'd be nice since they made no mention of that before I ordered it. 

The \"chef\" there told me I was LYING again, that there is NO cilantro on the sandwich, and then had me dissect the thing IN FRONT OF OTHER CUSTOMERS. It was ridiculous. 

After all this I politely asked if I could just have something else instead, and I apologized for the trouble. I asked for a chicken cutlet sandwich, which they of course put together in a hurry and didn't bother to heat up the chicken. So it was a cold chicken cutlet with cold tomato sauce and cold cheese. Appetizing, right?  

It came to a dollar more then the other sandwich, so they asked me to come back with a dollar next time. Whatever. They're cheap, it's very clear. 

My next visit: I order a bagel, toasted with cream cheese. They didn't listen when I asked for it toasted and got annoyed when I had to repeat the request. 

While I'm waiting to be cashed out, the \"chef\" there ACTUALLY YELLS ACROSS THE RESTAURANT: \"you didn't come back the next day with the dollar\"

IS THIS GUY FOR REAL?

My response \"you served me two terrible sandwiches in one day, wasted my lunch hour with continuing to screw up very simple orders, gave me a \"hot\" sandwich that was freezing cold, told me it was MY fault, and now you're bothering me about a dollar? This is will be my last visit here.\"

He shrugged his shoulders and said \"Ok\"

I hope the other patrons heard this. This place is only there to take your money with their overpriced, bland food- and they do NOT care about making their customers happy. Not one bit. YOU'RE BETTER OFF GOING TO MCDONALDS, YOU'LL DEFINITELY GET TREATED BETTER."}

{"text":"Good selection of sandwiches and wraps, plus soups and salads. I had the turkey and avocado sandwich, but didn't realize it was pre-made sitting in the fridge - the set up looks as though you get to tell them what to put on it, so this was kind of deceiving. I don't like sauces on my sandwich (honey mustard and mayo are already on it) and they grilled it without asking (prefer non-grilled). If you aren't as picky as I am, you probably won't care. The sandwich was fine, but I thought it was pricy to add a side salad, as the total for both was almost $14. Good spot, though, as its in an out-of-the-way area with not much else around when you don't have a vehicle. I'll likely return if I am working at this location again."}

Came here for the first time and I'd heard from a regular that pretty much everything is made in house.  She says even the fruit is cut fresh (as opposed to places using the cheap syrup stuff from cans).

I wanted to get a burger from the photos they had but it's a bbq Friday special.  They were just out of whole wheat bread when I arrived after 2:30 so I settled for a whole wheat chicken Cesar salad wrap.

Portion of chicken was good, and the toppings seem fresh.

For some reason, there's something special about this place.  I can't put my finger on it.  They have wifi which is a plus!  I think it's run by a family but I can't promise it is.  They seem pleasant here which is a big plus.

Yes, they have premade sandwiches there but there are other options there too for you to customize your sandwich.  

This place reminds me of a little sandwich shop I'd like to run one day."}
{"text":"The place is under new management! Fantastic sandwiches. Albeit not sure if the sandwiches should be cold inside...but good either way. There specials on certain days such as the korean bibimbap and kalbi on friday are some of the best and remind me of korean home cooking. 're did the front station area as well so customers move alittle bit smoother then the old system. They need alittle work. But the food and specials are great!"}
