{"text":"I just received some of the most rude service of my life. It takes quite a lot for me to write a negative review but after ordering a sandwich from the Farm Fresh Deli at Pittsburgh airport I am mad. The sandwich itself was quite tasty but the way I was spoken to was inexcusable. The man who served me was not very friendly to begin with but when I asked for tomato on my sandwich and he replied very rudely with \"you can have tomaytoes\" I was stunned. I am Australian and although I have lived in the United States for over 6 years I still have a fairly distinctive accent. If this man is this discriminatory towards anyone that is clearly not American then I think that the airport might not be the best place for him to work. I suggest that you find somewhere else to eat when waiting for a flight at PIT."}
{"text":"Bottom Line: Wish this place was in my neighborhood!!  I'd stop 5 out of 5 mornings for a breakfast sandwich.   Walked up to the \"Order\" line. Young man immediately acknowledged me. I ordered the 2 Farm Fresh Eggs, Cheese and choice of thick cut bacon, sausage or turkey sausage Panini. I got the turkey sausage and added avocado. He told me he would have it at the register in a few minutes. Went to the register and told the cashier what I ordered and also added a large coffee.   It came to $9. Fair for an airport meal.   The sandwich was delicious. It was warm, the eggs weren't overcooked and all the ingredients were fresh.   Bottom Line: anytime I'm here in the morning I'll get the same thing. I also can't wait to try them out for lunch!"}
{"text":"A good option for Airport food. The staff was friendly and courteous. Our egg sandwiches we're cooked right in front if us.  The ingredients were fresh. Prices are high but on par with other places nearby.   There was a short line and it moved rather quickly.  Our food was okay, nothing exciting, but a reliable choice."}
{"text":"They STOP serving breakfast at 10:30 AM! Does the ownership know this? ! Young kids work there. Beware!"}
{"text":"Ordered a vegetarian sandwich with swiss cheese, no onion. Was supposed to have spinach on it according to the menu board, instead of was mostly romaine & a few pieces of spinach. The girl loaded it with onion, NO cheese and the bread was barely toasted, mostly soggy. (This was a panini supposedly) Will not return. Girl was turning around looking at the menu board clearly trying to figure out what was supposed to be on the sandwich and she still couldn't get it right. Waste of money."}
{"text":"Although the sandwich was actually very tasty, the horrific service made it seem like it didn't matter- I felt like a prisoner in line at the mess hall the way this woman treated me- first, she was extremely rude to the elderly woman ahead of me...... making me almost frightened to order my sandwich.  slamming kitchen utensils around with a scowl on her face, she barked at me for my order, I timidly asked if they had gluten free, She nastily remarked no. I ordered my sandwich and while checking out, I said to the manager, is she in a bad mood..... and instead of apologizing, she made the excuse that she's working alone and that I would be crabby too..... seriously???!!! I don't care if I'm starving, I will never go to this establishment again, I would rather go across the floor to McDonalds, where the food may not be as good, but at least the service is far more friendly and less abusive."}
{"text":"This was my favorite stop as part of the yelp tasting event at PIT Airport! The name of this place is spot on and the customer service was great.  They served me a sample of their California chicken panini sandwich with a side of chicken and wild rice soup.    The sandwich was very tasty and I liked the bit of char from the grilled bread. I do think it needed a tangy or spicy sauce, but that could easily be added to your order I'm sure.   The soup was delightful! It tasted so fresh and full of flavor. I am not much of a soup person but I gobbled this up and considered getting another bowl of it to-go!  The employee who served us was very friendly and explained that all of their menu items are made fresh daily with quality ingredients. She was thrilled at how much we enjoyed our food.  While browsing the counter I also noticed that they have a 'Pepper Patch' where you can add several types of pickled items to your sandwich for an extra zing of flavor. I thought that was an excellent way to give customers a hand at customizing their own meal.  I will absolutely be back to try some more of their menu as I thought it was a not too heavy, relatively healthy meal, perfect for a traveler at the airport. Farm Fresh Deli will leave you feeling satisfied, but without the guilt or heartburn.  Check them out!"}
{"text":"If you prefer dry tasteless food, then I highly recommend trying this place. You could get more flavor from fresh saw dust, a bowling bowl and even dirt. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here earlier today by myself for breakfast.  Farm Fresh Deli is located in the center core at PIT and I must have walked by it a hundred or so times before today.  It's a free standing \"kiosk\" so there's not much to it.  You can walk up, place your order and walk down the line subway style before paying at the end.  On this morning what caught my eye was the avocado and egg white panini.  It consisted of avocado, egg whites, American cheese and tomatoes (I chose to forgo these) all on a toasted wheat bread for 5.99.  After ordering my sandwich I watched it get made and they put on a decent amount of egg white and cheese before being stingy with the avocado.  I am talking 3 tiny slices for the whole sandwich which maybe made it 1/8 of an avocado.  If you are naming a sandwich after it, you probably should add a bit more.  In any case, I paid and went to wait.  It took a little longer than 5 minutes which seemed like quite a bit for a faster airport place but I was happy about it whenever my bread ended up being well toasted and the cheese nice and melted.  Other than that the sandwich tasted decent enough although i really could have used avocado.  The bottom line for me is that I might stop by here again in the future.  While my sandwich was well executed and tasty, I really wish they would have added more of the namesake ingredient."}
{"text":"The food is decent breakfast food but they did not put the acocado on my fianc√©'s sandwich and she paid for it."}
{"text":"This was the rudest service I've ever had. The egg and cheese sandwich was also not very good, it had the smallest egg in there. Go to another place that serves better food and better service."}
{"text":"The guy that is currently working is super rude and has no training working with customers.  I walked up to the counter not seeing the sign and I ask the guy working the counter if I order thru the register, he just simply threw the mop and didn't say anything and proceeded to yell at me by saying, \"didn't you read the sign\".  I said my piece and walked away.  I will never come to this place again."}
{"text":"The best Italian hoagie I have had in a long time. The bread was fresh. The meat was perfect. The hoagie  was so big  I could  only eat half.  It taste even better the next day."}
{"text":"This place has a familiar ring to it and it wasn't long before I remembered. This place used to be Au Bon Pain. Often times when I had that early am flight I would rush over here-grab something on the fly to take to my gate and then if I had time eat it while I was waiting for them to call my flight or eat it on the plane.  Normally I would get either hot cereal, fruit, juice, and water-you aren't allowed to bring bottled water past TSA checkpoints. This time I was in for a little treat. They were serving sample California chicken panini, wild rice soup, and crackers as part of the Yelp's passport to the airport event.  The food was okay. Typical airport food that you really don't want to go all out on. It is centrally located in the center court of the air mall in the airside terminal of Pittsburgh International airport. You can easily grab and go to any of the concourses provided you aren't running late so that you can get to your gate.  Staff is friendly and helpful. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Had a turkey panini that was extraordinarily great and a soup that was chicken and wild rice that was my favorite soup ever....I don't even like soup! Great upgraded cuisine."}
{"text":"The service was good and quick. Food wise, it definitely falls under the boring airport food category. I got avocado eggwhite panini. It is wheat bread with Gouda cheese, generous amounts of egg whites, and a small quantity of avocado and a slice of tomatoe. The Gouda cheese is the main flavor adding element. The sandiwch could have used some more avocado and a bit of salt and pepper. However, I should say that it is a filling breakfast for $6. I recommend this if you are looking for healthy breakfast."}
