{"text":"I wanted a burger for lunch one day, and this place was recommended to me by a friend.

It's a bar, so yeah.

The burger I got was pretty good, but there was something strange about the way it tasted. Can't quite put my finger on it, but I think it was something in the buns they used. I may have to go back to try again with a different type of bun (if possible) to see if that alleviates the issue."}
{"text":"Went back there last night, only to find out that they got rid of the half-day happy hour. That was very disappointing. Also gone was most of the appetizers, and only a minimal menu. Gone was the lobster quesedillas, and the lobster potato skins.  The waitress let us know that they were trying to revamp the place and cutting back to focus more on the regulars. The other location (blue diamond) still has some of the menu, and still has happy hour, so I'll check them out instead.

The place still has nice wait staff, and nice regulars. But I'm disappointed, and won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"Our family LOVES this place!! GREAT food & Service and easy on the wallet too!"}
{"text":"Nice bar and grill, don't expect fabulous five star cuisine mostly your typical bar food. During certain sports seasons they have awesome happy hour prices. 

If your looking for a warm friendly bar with great bartenders this is the place. Porter is awesome best mint julep in town besides the ones I make at home. 

Waitresses are hit and miss some are great but others disappear for long times leaving you looking around for drink refills."}
{"text":"Simply put - I love this place.  It's one of the few true neighborhood bars in Las Vegas (almost all the customers live in Mountain's Edge), and the bartenders and servers are some of the nicest I've ever met (my first time there, the bartender greeted me with \"Welcome Home\" and has called me by name ever since.)

The food is a tiny step up from your \"standard\" pub food, with slightly more diverse options, although some of the dishes are absolutely superb (I can't have enough of the Crispy Ranch Salad).

But what I like most about it, is that it's not your \"standard\" Vegas-style pub where nobody knows each other and puts their head down for the night playing video poker - everyone is talking to the bartenders, dancing to the music, playing darts or Golden Tee and generally having a great time.  As much as I hate to say it, it's a place where \"everybody knows your name.\""}
{"text":"Just had an amazing steak dinner here with my wife. 

Service was great. I love the fact that there are TVs in dinning room but its separate from the bar and smoke free!!!

Wife liked her BBQ pulled pork. We are definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Like the sun tricking through the forest, The place is wonderful great people, will return there often thanks 
Ashl inc"}
{"text":"Great local pub.  Friendly staff, who generously comp while you play.  The patrons are also very warm and welcoming.  I will be back, possibly to try the food."}
{"text":"Great local bar right down the street from me. They have a great menu with a variety to choose from. The food is very good for your typical bar food. They also have a dining area separate from the bar. Good spot to watch the games."}
{"text":"I love there tune salad I think about it while I'm working, driving, sleeping lol. So good and my friend wins on keno every time were there. I love it."}
{"text":"Great food and happy hours deals but horrible service on dinning side 45 min to get an appetizer and to get a beer 15min and the restaurant with like 3 people so not even busy horrible service, So I came back and went to the bar for there happy hour and the service in the bar area was great, so I recommend the bar area for sure"}
{"text":"Came here randomly after a day of driving around and visiting a few different spots.  Was just in time for happy hour and it was a good time with some cheap drinks.  this place is pretty non descript, but good."}
{"text":"We went here a few weeks ago. I was actually surprised how good the food was. Stuck our heads in late one night I think it was Friday at 9 or 10pm. We had a burger and pasta it was above average for a 24 hour gaming restaurant. Flavorsome pasta dish which was the special of the night,  well cooked fries and burger and good value. Didn't goto the bar or gaming area though"}
{"text":"I used to go for happer hour a lot.  They have great deals and the food is high quality compared to other happy hour bar food.  Staff was always nice.  Porter is a really nice and hospitable bartender.  Honestly my issue is specific to their happy hour.  It was one of the best in the area until they switched over to PBR as the special.  Sorry guys I can't follow you there."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for the first time yesterday afternoon, as I rarely go to bars and don't gamble, but this place is close to my house. 

First off, the female bartender (don't think she told me her name, but did say she was new to the establishment) was super sweet,  and provided excellent service. I was shocked that it wasn't very smokey! It was in the afternoon and there was only one other patron, so perhaps when it gets busier it would be, but it was just fine then.

Started off with fried cheese curds, that were awesome! They come with a Dijon- type mustard dipping sauce, which I didn't care for, so i asked for ranch. Their ranch is delicious!! Tastes like they make it from scratch. My friend ordered a Philly cheese steak and tater tots. I tried the tater tots and they were yummy. I ordered a Mediterranean salad, (I'm a vegetarian). Salad was a good size and was delicious! Very fresh, with just the right amount of dressing. Pretty decent prices for everything.  As with most gaming bars, there is a separate server for the food. She was great. Definitely will return, and highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"While visiting a local barber shop (Yelp review for that place later), I discovered that a bit of eavesdropping is still helpful these days when you want to know where the locals eat. The vicarious recommendation led us to this watering hole, where the food was apparently delicious. I thank whomever that young Las Vegan was because he was right and Rounders absolutely did not disappoint.

We started with the lobster quesadillas and wings...one word--YUM!! For the entrees we ordered the pulled pork sandwich and it was seriously the best one I've ever had! Also had the Asian chicken salad, which was OK, but then again, who orders salad at a bar? Won't make that mistake again when I come back. 

We were the only ones sitting in the dining area (since everyone else is at the bar), but it was a welcomed silence considering we had just driven into town that morning and just needed some good food with no distractions.So glad to have found an excellent place to chow down without making the tiring trip down the Strip. 

Bottom line: damn good food, great service, decent drinks, lots of parking, and you still have money left for the slots."}
{"text":"Rounders is conveniently located for residents of Mountain's Edge. This is a great place to come and pick up a few inexpensive happy hour draft beers and a good meal. 

Food is fresh and properly portioned for the price. I've had both of their \"Asian Inspired\" salads and was impressed that a corner bar had such great salads. We come here every once in a while for a quick bite and a hectic work day liquid therapy."}
{"text":"I go there for a quick meal while avoiding cigarette smoke.  There's a sign \"please seat yourself\".  I feel like adding \"because we ain't here to seat you\".

 The dining area is always ignored.   Even if they know you're there, after they take your order they play the disappearing act again only to be found hanging anywhere else but the dining area.  

Menu changes around and have always been pretty good.  Service at the bar have always been above par.   Dining room service is way too slow."}
{"text":"Great bar food, close to Mountains Edge, good service.  Potato skins are fantastic!!!!!!  Love it."}
{"text":"Fair warning: If you are a woman and sit at the bar for drinks, you will be ignored. If you are a man and sit at the bar for drinks, you're golden. 
Came with a girlfriend of mine when the female bartender with brown, shoulder length hair (very plain looking) was working. Wish I remembered her name. She completely ignored us and stood in the corner chatting up the male customers for 30 mins at a time. She walked by us several times, looked directly at our empty glasses, and continued walking over to her male customers. 
Very unfortunate since the food is good and it's close to home. However, management may want to take a second look at their employee customer service considering PTs is coming in a block up the road at Blue Diamond and El Capitan. If homegirl doesn't realize that women can sign a check, too, Rounders is going to have some issues soon. Good luck."}
{"text":"I like rounders!! Kinda my go to place for food to go, or a beer or two while i have time. Love the service, and food. If i owned a bar id set it up like rounders. The burgers and flat breads are great!!! Tommy knocker burger is one of the best hearty burgers in vegas."}
{"text":"I love this bar. Like others have said, I'm proud to call it my local bar.  

Their chile verde is almost the best I've ever had. I love the bartenders, they are always chatty and full of conversation. The drinks I've had are always good, I'm not much of a beer drinker so they are generally mixed drinks. The service between the bartenders and the servers is always good. The crowd is generally decent, I mainly stop by for a quick drink after work during happy hour. 

Today was my first football Sunday at Rounders and it was definitely fun with good times and a fun crowd no matter what team you might be rooting for. 

If you are in Mountains Edge or the SW, this is a good spot to call \"home\"."}
{"text":"I love the breakfast here, perfect cure for a major hangover! Service is always awesome no matter how busy it gets, and the staff really goes out of their way to make you feel welcome. The only complaint is their beer taps. I have gone there many times as its very close to my home and no matter the time of month, day, or type of beer, it always has a weird taste to it as if their lines had never been cleaned, or the beer is super old. As they rotate beers often, I would imagine dirty lines is the problem."}
{"text":"The food is great. The service is pretty good. The bartender at night is great. He is quick with checking in on people. I've been their once in the morning to watch a game and the morning one forgot my drink a couple of times. If I didn't already have a great experience at night I probably wouldn't have come back."}
{"text":"The cloest bar/tavern to the house.

Gf and I hit it every other week.  

The scene - the bar is busy every time we go in there ( primarily weekdays tuesday or wednesday )  the bartenders are great - attentive service, good attitute, easy on the eyes.  Beer selection is average but works for me.  The TV's are conveniently located.

gaming is hit/miss - our problem is we seem to have a knack of either sitting by the chain smoker or the CS sits down right after us and of course, frickin murphy's law  ...the smoke gravitates to our nostrils !

the food - ok / inconsistent.  Bar food with a few specials thrown in.  The go-to can't lose - the kettle chips - perfect ! 

Overall, a decent place to hit when you want to get away from the grind."}
{"text":"Its - ok but used to be better!  Was our go to for a sit down meal.  Nice atmosphere not pretentious Great waitresses.   But over the last 5 or so months they have decided to be more .. up scale..  so now its not a 2 times a week but more like once a month.  Gone are the potato skins, appetizers are non existent.  No real happy hour.  Burgers are still good, as are the chicken fingers but dinners are too foo foo.   Used to like their lobster quesadilla - gone.. fish tacos - gone.  New manager likes to freeze out the dinning room.. had to leave twice.  Its just lost its appeal.  At this pace all that we liked to eat will be eliminated eventually.  YOU ARE A BAR!"}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood restaurant/bar. The restaurant is segregated from the bar, so there's no smoking in it and the kids can dine there. The bar is vibrant, with a great bartending staff."}
{"text":"Servers are always attentive and friendly. Food and appetizers are very well prepared. A better ventilation system is the only thing that could make this place better."}
{"text":"Another local bar and grill we've tried in the Vegas area.  The portions are huge!!!  My husband and I went here for dinner.  I had the steak dinner and he had the pork chimichanga.  We ordered some buffalo wings for appetizers, but you can probably go without an appetizer because of the big portions.  We'll definitely go back again and maybe try them out for breakfast."}
{"text":"This is definitely a regulars bar. If you are not a regular they definitely dont make you feel welcomed. The greeting at the bar was- what do you want? With no smile or anything. Felt like I was an inconvenience to them hanging on the other side of the bar with the regulars, eating off their plates. No one comes back to check on you to make sure if everything is ok. The server messed up part of the food order and never came back to check. 2 bartenders walked passed my empty drink. I even asked a girl for a refill and she just walked right passed me. Waited about 10-15min with my credit card out trying to pay my tab before finally someone noticed. The food is really good so its a shame. Next time will definitely get to go."}
{"text":"Naked wings and the Atomic Sauce off the hook. With a giant pretzel and a side of PBR. So good at 1am."}
{"text":"Met a friend for drinks. Great bar service. But don't go expecting great food. Green chile verde has a nice kick, but the pork belly tacos- meat didnt seem like pork belly but just marinated pork. Spinach artichoke dip was good, just need fresher tasting chips. Fries are thick cut. Thinner fries would taste better with beer!"}
{"text":"VERY customer oriented!!! porter and laura are great!!! make sure to wear gloves if you try the hotwings!"}
{"text":"Worst bartender in Vegas. Lived here 19 years. Went in and dropped $940 in a machine. Bartender \"Girly\" says  You only played $20 and charges me for drinks. I tab out. Pay. And of course stiff her on a tip.  Find a new job. You are a detriment to your workplace. Lost a whale."}
{"text":"Always a friendly smile when I come here! The food here is always to par and the drinks are poured well! I tell everyone to give it a shot and often see my friends coming and going. Keep up the good work Rounders! I'm looking forward to trying some of the other locations."}
{"text":"Have been here so many times as we live really close and it never disappoints. They have great happy hour specials, the wings and potato skins are great. They make their own mini corn dogs which rock. The staff is very friendly and the food always great. If you are in the mood for a burger I recommend the Fire House, great spice and a thick burger. My only regret is that it took me so long to review Rounders. Come here and you will leave happy and I promise you will be back!!"}
{"text":"My local bar in the Mountains Edge area. Rounders, well, is well rounded for any type of person looking for night life entertainment in the area. 

Games - Games are located at the bar and range in denomination. 

Waitresses - Always friend, some hot, and are quick to get you new drinks and eats. 

Pulled Pork Sandwich - I suggest it. 

TV & Sports - Packed on Monday for football and deals are always going. I always ask the bartender if there are any deals going on and it never fails to lower my bill. I think they have $1 beers during the games also. I don't remember. 

All-in-all, I highly recommend checking out Rounders if you are in the area and wanting to hang out with some friends."}
{"text":"Drove by for 4 years and finally stopped as its close to our home. Very nice decor and staff is very friendly and menu is large and not just typical deep fried bar food."}
{"text":"Just your average around the corner bar. But i did enjoy the favt that they have a different menu than PTs Gold. So it's always good to change it up. It has the bar area for smoking. And a separate section if u just want to eat in peace. They have tvs everywhere. So you wont miss anything. And the machines payout well in my oppinion. So that's always a plus when you can make your bartab free. LoL"}
{"text":"Walked into a place Ive never been to before and after tonight I will never return. Not for the food which was not bad nor the server who took care of my food order while I ate and played at the bar. For the simple fact that you have a late night bartender manager who is rude an completely disrespectful. Matt Porter who somehow thinks its ok to criticize a paying customer for how much they play. I didn't go there to get anything comped or to drink for free. I only went to hang out with a friend who happens to be a regular. I ate, drank and asked to pay my tab. For someone who happens to be a GM he doesn't know anything about customer service. A smart ass attitude like that who yells at clients will not bring you repeat business. I will gladly take my money elsewhere and I am sorry for anyone who has to deal with him. Its sad how jaded and petty some of the people can get after years of working in the service industry. Maybe consider another profession if your own customers say you treat others just as bad at your bar. Thank you for my chicken tenders. Good luck with Porter."}
{"text":"Drove by this place for over 3 years and always wanted to stop. Finally did and what a great place. Had the rueben sandwhich and their handmade chips. Beer specials and staff was over the top!! A new favorite place close to Mountains Edge!"}
{"text":"I recently turned 21 this year and have spent lots of time checking out bars, Rounders is right across the street so I figured it would be a convenient regular spot for me. When I got there with my fiancé, the bar wasn't very busy at all. Mostly people talking at the bar and only one other table other than us, so we thought it would be quick, but it was the longest dinner I've ever had to endure in a not busy place just because the waitresses never came over to check on us. They actually made us feel like they were purposely not serving us by the way they walked around the bar and talked and laughed out loud to each other and never once looked at us. To order took at least 15 minutes, another 20 for the food and drinks to come, and then probably another 20 before anyone asked us how we were doing. To add to that, the food was not very good and I couldn't even drink my drink. When we finally got a waitresses attention, we just asked for the check and left, barely touched our food or drinks. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Rounders is a wonderful neighborhood bar! The dining room is separate from the bar and doesn't smell smokey at all. The staff here really makes it a go-to restaurant. They're so friendly and prompt. While everything on the menu is good, the cheeseburger is especially excellent!!"}
{"text":"I'd like to start with a giant compliment to all the waitresses you're all AWESOME ... but here is my complaint.. seems you are trying to be upscale when really most everyone loved the food you've taken off the menu .. and what happened to all the yummy Happy Hour appetizers ??? Prices going up because of the companies desire to put out something upscale has turned off a lot of people ... instead of a couple times a week it's now monthly"}
{"text":"Service was solid. Good food and drinks. Stopped in randomly and was pleasantly surprised by the craft bottle selection. Wings were delicious."}
{"text":"amazing food for a bar that resembles the countless PT's

ive gotten the seared tuna salad, the buffalo medium wings, the campanille pasta, the gyro, the tommy knocker burger, the kc burger, the pastrami burger, the clam chowder, the iceberg wedge, the philly steak and i have never been disappointed.

they have soild craft beers too. i usually go with the joseph james citra rye ipa but they have others on draft and even more in bottles. 

this is a fantastic place to go to for food... your expectations will be exceeded here"}
{"text":"The friendliest bartender in town! Crystal is awesome and has a great personality. She is very attentive and remembers our names. We have been going in every weekend for the past 6 months for breakfast. Unfortunately, they have a very, very limited menu. You have three choices....eggs, eggs, and more eggs. No pancakes, no French toast, waffles. We have pleaded with Crystal to inform the owner to change the menu. The other location has extensive menu in Henderson....I guess they cater to zip codes. If they would add just a couple of items, I'd happily  give them a five star rating for great locals pub."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and it went well. But the last time I went was the worst. I walked in with a friend and once in the smell of smoke was horrible. Smokey and the smell of old stale smoke made it hard to stay long. It wasn't even crowded to have the smoke be like that. I was coughing a lot. Maybe something was wrong with the ventilation that night. But the service and food was good though."}
{"text":"Graveyard Male Bartender is a Thief:  

I was playing a video poker machine and left my money in it while I was sitting at a pub table chatting with my friend. They usually put a reserved sign on a machine when you step away from it but I was just a few feet away.   I could see the machine from where I was sitting w/ my friend. It was actually kind of slow and not busy at all.  The bar tenders did a shift change...the girl (long dark hair) leaving kissed the guy coming on to the next shift so I figured it was her boyfriend and that she told him what we were drinking and that we were playing that machine. (It was the low handicapped machine so it's not along the bar top with the rest of the machines) 10 minutes later a young guy walked up, quickly played a few hands, and hit \"cash out\" I jumped up and said \"what are you doing, that's my money!?\"  

This is amateur hour and I knew exactly what was going on.  The bartender and patron thought someone left the money behind and they were going to split the cash.  I confronted the guy that hit the cash out button on my machine.  The great thing is when the idiot bartender ran over he said \"Yup, it had $83.50 on it when he started and he played it down to $80.\" SInce when does a bartender know down to the cent what amount a machine had on it before and after a few hands of poker play?? He admitted his guilt right there.

Long story short the patron felt bad and ended up telling me that he and the bartender were going to split it.  The patron had to cash it out and was going to give $40 to the bartender that's why he played it down to $80 even. I was beyond furious that the bartender thought this was a good idea.  I was sitting right there and he was to lazy and stupid to ask if either of us were playing that machine? They planned to take something that didn't belong to them and they got caught doing it.  The bartender sheepishly retreated when the some-what drunk guy told me that I was correct and they were indeed going to share the cash.  I can see a patron taking a cheap shot at some quick cash but didn't expect it from the bartender here. 

I was sitting right there the whole time.  You could have just asked if we were playing the machine and saved yourself the embarrassment.  I asked the guy \" if you would have hit a Royal Flush...then what?\" He said he would have given me one third...yeah right, it was all my money to begin with, loser!  

I probably should have called the Gaming Control Board to tell them that a sneaky bartender tried to steal my money out of a machine.  He is supposed to be there for the patrons to sling some drinks and payout slot wins---not rob them!!

$80 isn't the end of the world.  It's the principle behind the whole matter---I don't want my pocket picked by the staff.

This left such a bad taste in my mouth I will never gamble, play darts, or hang out here ever again.  

Dear Bartender, You work for tips.  Wait to get tipped and don't just help yourself to my money."}
{"text":"I have dined and drank at this location several time and although the food was good and the staff was very nice, my last experience was not very good at all. As I was having my drink a very tall man, who I think may have been the owner or someone in upper management,  began screaming and berating what seemed to be a lady (vendor) of some sort, he got right in here face, it was terrible. I thought first of all, nobody deserves to be to be spoken to like that, however, how unprofessional to act like that. I will never go there again after that scene."}
{"text":"We are from Oregon and some friends here took us here a couple days ago, and we've been back three times, we leaving to head back to Oregon tomorrow, but we will be back next year
The food was super, and Panyah made our time there a great evening.
Bill and  Nancy from Oregon"}
{"text":"Great food! Never real busy.  Staff very friendly too!  Portion sizes are huge.  I'm a big guy and get stuffed every time I have one of their skillets."}
{"text":"Smoky.  Like - toooooooo smoky.  We came in... sat down, and no one acknowledged us.  No one cared.  Minutes passed.  Still no one cared.  But the regulars got a big round of hugs from the waitress.  Took about 15 minutes to say hi to everyone.  Still no one cared about us.  We left and still no one cared.  Lol.  Never again."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Food is decent, Bloody Mary...amazing, very friendly people. Katie is my favorite bartender! And, great place to watch a sports game."}
{"text":"Food and apps are awesome! And service is very friendly and prompt. Ordered the Thai tempura shrimp, sauce was amazing! Laurell was our server and she was awesome!"}
{"text":"Nothing great here... it is just another bar.  I am not sure what makes people go to these half gaming-half food joints, but I havent found one yet that makes me want to go back."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in the Mountain's Edge area.  Menu items are fresh and  tasty - love their discount appetizers before 6:00 p.m.  Service has always been great."}
{"text":"The best fish tacos!! I know it sounds crazy but it's true!! Chris & Greg are my favorite bartenders and they are so accommodating!! I always have a fresh adult beverage and never have to ask for a refill;)-"}
{"text":"Great staff and amazing food!! I have had at least half of the menu and they always deliver. My favorite is the Ahi Tuna Crisps!! Other favorites include the carpacio, burgers, pasta dishes, and chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"I don't know why but he really loves this place. Anytime and nearly any attire and booze and mediocre food is at your fingertips here. I do appreciate their assortment of bottled beers as well as all their other drinks. Wait staff and bartender always give off positive vibrations. It is always a good time for rounders especially if you enjoy wreaking of cigarette smoke and long walks under the moonlight"}
{"text":"The food was pretty decent - especially the kettle chips. I was going to give it only 1 star because of the female bartender but then the bartender coming on shift was great and made up for her being so bad. I wish I got his name. Now I will come back but only after 4!"}
{"text":"Worst bar I've been in a long time. The bartender insisted for me to keep my tab open when I only wanted to pay for a round. During the night a few more friend showed up,  I kept telling him that I was just gonna pay for the first round and he comforted me saying he'll take care of it at the end. Long story short,  him and the Asian,  super rude bartender,  refused to do THEIR job and split the bill so everything went on my card. And they even overcharged us. I told him that was not what I asked him to do,  he shrugged and offered me a shot as if it's not his issue. I'll never come back and neither my friends,  the bar is lame anyway. And btw, the dude thinks he's funny calling customers names, no dude,  you're just a douche."}
{"text":"It was obvious that unless you were a regular of the bartenders that the service from them would suck.  We sat at the bar to have some food and drinks and no more than five words were spoke to us by either bartender.  No hello, goodbye or thank you, just a\" what can i get you.\" If your just looking for a cold beer and decent food than the spot is good.  We ended up having a food server, Corey, help us at the bar and his service is the only reason this place gets any stars.  If you are a manager or owner reading this we were there on Mon 17th between 6 and 7 p.m.  I sure you can find out who the bartenders were and maybe think about some customer service training."}
{"text":"Love the service here. The ladies are always very sweet and go out of their way to provide top notch Service. 

My drink has never been empty without them askin if I want another. I hate having to ask for another drink. Just a small pet peeve of mine. 

The decor is mediocre. Pro that the place doesn't reek of smoke like other bars.  Con is that there's usually lots of guys and small amounts of women. I guess I shouldn't complain being single and all but sometimes I'm just coming for a damn drink and not wanting to be picked up on."}
{"text":"I stopped by tonight to grab a beer after work and catch.the game. It was a great experience . The bartender was attentive but let me enjoy my beer and game without hovering.  I will definitely be stopping In again at a later date. Highly recommend this place. Good beer, service and over all experience"}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst service from the bartenders. I was there for 2.5 hours and the waitress stopped by once when we called her over. I sat for 45 minutes with an empty glass before I was approached for another drink. When we wanted to pay for our bill she swapped the credit cards that we gave her and she charged me the full amount of the bill when we indicated that it should have been only $12.00. Not friendly. Only concerned with the customers that were spending money on the machines. Do not recommend at all!"}
{"text":"Rounders is a bar that serves food and drinks 24/7. It was one of those places that I'd always passed but never thought of going into.  I don't know why I ever thought I wouldn't like this place but I am definitely a fan of Rounders.  Actually a non-yelper convinced me to go cause their wings are suppose to be great.  So why not I had to try them.

My first time there I order 6 wings while everyone else order 12.   I thought about the 6 wings not being enough but when they came out I was satisfied with the size.  They are pretty meaty wings in comparison to those wing places, not double the size but definitely larger.  You can sauce them like other wing places too, BBQ, mild, hot, etc.  If your looking for a food challenging they have their Atomic wing challenge I don't remember the rules or details but if you're successful you get your picture on the wall.  I asked the hot female bartender there about how hot the wings were.  I think she said stupid hot then put a jacket on.  It's probably the way I asked and what I was doing, I don't even know but she covered up. Usually I'm cool with hot I've don't some insanely hot wings before, back in the day.  When I tasted their firecracker wings, which isn't their hottest, it was nice and delicious tasting but it had a spicy after taste which was making me sweat, I wasn't expecting much heat but it had some. Maybe I won't do the challenge and just ask for 1 wing dipped in their hottest sauce and see if I can do that first.

The K.C. Burger is another item I tried it was a monster of a burger and very tasty. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rounders-las-vegas-2?select=kvMiLVGbvDHK2ugy6dQbvQ#20dvj-huFQxX6dOWmpCGSQ It was a juicy 1/2 lbs burger perfectly cooked with bacon, tasty BBQ sauce, cheese, and onion ring The bun was pretty cool.  It was about $10 with onion rings substitute over fries. I would eat it again.

They have these fried shrimps and jalapenos sides with their dipping sauce another delicious offering.  Really enjoyed the dipping sauce and shrimps. I like the rest of the menu, would mine trying more.

They have an sweet happy hour at least its still running when I get off at 1:30 am.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rounders-las-vegas-2?select=kvMiLVGbvDHK2ugy6dQbvQ#5_z0YjXBCJCo7e05B3W94g  The HH is from 2 pm- 7 pm and 12 am - 3 am and includes 50% off apps, $2 drafts, $3 wells, $4 wine, and $5 you name it martinis.  They have an awesome selection of beer.

So why did it take me so long to try Rounders!? Probably because there aren't a lot of yelpers living in the area or a lot of yelpers reviewing them, they are good. Great friendly service, atmosphere, and interior. I'll be here on a weekly basis."}
{"text":"Another great little place I come to kick back.  Great bartenders...Porter, Maria, Laura.  Awesome service and great atmosphere.  Haven't tried the food yet but I hear it's pretty good.  They have my favorite beer and it's cold cold, so I'm good with that."}
{"text":"Food was too far from ever being called good, it was a good thing we were starving.... Beer was flat, warm and skunked. Appts were half price but what was the worst of it was the angry bartender ( gentlemen in his 40's in a red shirt ) was saying inappropriate language in the dining room... And was pretty much making a scene. Not a experience I ever want to relive."}
{"text":"Great, friendly staff and everything on the menu rocks. Only disappointment was the flat iron steak... Eat here at least once a week and alway excellent! Super cheap happy hour menu with great variety."}
{"text":"After a girls night in we decided we needed a little girls night OUT time. We hit the bar and started gaming and drinking. Our bartender was VERY nice... we didn't win ANY money that night and she comp'd us some food for our loss! We ordered the BBQ Chicken Flat bread. VERY cheesey. Like VERY. It was good though! 
Nice neighborhood bar with a friendly staff!!"}
{"text":"Good happy hour especially games. Quick to get a drink and didnt have to call him back for a second, making there rounds on a half way busy sunday. Food is bar food quality so not bad but not great.  All in all a good atmosphere and good service for a bar that lives off games and happy hour."}
{"text":"This place is awesome mainly because it is so close to me. The staff are nice and the food isn't to bad either . The only thing I hate is how smokey it is in there, I feel like a I need to shower immediately after I leave. I know it's a bar so can't do much about it but hey, some fresh air wouldn't hurt :)"}
{"text":"I stopped in here after trivia at the Freaking Frog to take advantage of their $50 birthday match play. This is a great birthday promotion. You just put $50 in the video poker machine and rounders will match it. Once you run through the $100 whatever is left is yours to keep. I cashed out for $80, got to drink for free while I played and made a $30 profit. Pretty good deal and even if you're not a gambler the rounder's pints are only $2.

The kitchen closes at 9 so we were too late to eat but I have had lunch here before and they serve a pretty good turkey burger with chipotle mayo. It comes on a pretzel bun that I absolutely love. 

Craig was our bartender and he was very personable and kept the beers flowing. I told him I was going to give him a good review on yelp and he said \"What's that?\" :) Despite that minor glitch, he was awesome. The only reason I didn't give Rounders more stars was the smoking. I hate it. Always have always will. It wasn't bad while we were there. It was Monday night and they were pretty slow but I imagine it can get nasty when this place is busy."}
{"text":"I ate at Rounders the other day for the first time and was super impressed!!
The bar and gaming area is perfect and comfortable, with great TV's for sports. They even have a separate dining room that is smoke free! The food and service was awesome!

Special thanks to Larissa our waitress!  Friendly, knowledgeable, and fun, she took great care of us and made our dining experience really special!  She made the perfect recommendations, and everything was served quickly and correctly....thanks again for helping make our evening so enjoyable!

If you haven't been here yet, try it! The food is great, and the service is top notch!"}
{"text":"This review is only for breakfast in the bar (pre-8:00am). Needed an early morning place to eat breakfast before getting to the airport. Found Rounders on Yelp. You kind of don't know what you'll get so we stopped in. It's actually more of a bar inside and before 8, the restaurant side isn't open yet though they do still serve breakfast. Didn't want to fuss around finding another place so settled into the bar. They have a decent breakfast menu. Trying to eat light after a lot of overeating on my trip, I went with the yogurt and granola parfait (says homemade granola!). The parfait was great but the ratio of granola to yogurt was off (too much granola!).

The service was great (there were only 2 other people in there gambling and drinking). Bartender was very attentive and friendly. What minused a star was just the fact that it wasn't a true restaurant experience. I don't care to eat my meal in a bar with people smoking nearby.

Ample free parking just outside the bar/restaurant."}
{"text":"Oh Rounders, how I miss you!  I lived within a mile of the place when I lived in Vegas.  It quickly turned into the hang out spot for my friends and I.  In a city with so many bars and places to eat it's hard to find the good ones.  This place is one of the good ones, for bar food that it.  It's definitely a locals place, as it a good 5 miles off the strip.  Their happy hours tend to never end, I think if live sports are on it's considered happy hour.  Regardless the servers will take care of you if you're not a douche.  Try the lobster quesadilla then try the tri trip quesadilla, you won't be able to decide which is better.  Great locals bar, great bar food, great service and awesome happy hour!"}
{"text":"Nice local bar with a great happy hour. Happy hour starts at Midnight and offers $99 cent domestic draft beers with half off appetizers. I had the three tacos and they were awesome.

i would only suggest this if you want to drink at midnight and you are in the southwest then this is a great place"}
{"text":"If you want 5 star service ask for Missy. She's absolutely amazing. You'll feel like Cheers where everyone knows your name. Missy will even remember your special order. I will only deal with Missy for a server. Again Girlie and Laura are always fun and put on a show. Love those two bartenders. Missy your the best. Xxoo."}
{"text":"A cozy bar in the Mountain's Edge area.  I've only eaten breakfast there, but it was solid.  GREAT breakfast potatoes.  It's a nice sports bar with lots of TVs, video poker (as all the bars have), nice staff and good happy hour specials.

The location is really what does it for me, but that's all I need. :)"}
{"text":"Are you kidding me? Ordered a meal at the bar waited an hour then asked the bar tender to cash me out as no food has arrived. The bartender asked us if we  were sure we wanted to leave as the manager would probably comp the meal due to the unacceptable service (her words) so we stayed, put the order in as the server apparently never placed the order. 15 mins later we got a meal. I figured they would comp the meal as they messed up sooo bad but they didn't and gave us a bill. Management is a mess up and the server is a mess up. Wonder what the turn over is like as the management was lecturing our server prior to this about taking other customers orders."}
{"text":"The sound system is awful. Service is awesome and the tri tip quesadilla was really good"}
{"text":"This is the best little local pub in the area. We went last night and, as expected, had fantastic food. I really cannotsay enough good things about the food, service, and value.
Oli was our server and she was loads of fun. She brought just that right tone to the casual meal.
This is a standard lunch option, now it is a dinner option as well."}
{"text":"Small place on blued diamond but it's really good. Great service. That matters to me most. The waitress was always checking on us and refilled out glasses before we asked. I hade some breakfast while everyone else just had lunch. My huevos ranchoes were good. Gotta stop by this place at night one of these days."}
{"text":"This place is great, we have been here about 20 times.  The happy hours specials are fantastic. The breakfast is great as well.  We have always had outstanding service, which is also very important.  We have played Keno here, and we never win....that is the only bummer!"}
{"text":"Good bar with great happy hour specials. Dollar beers an half off apps. Fast friendly service. The Ruben is your typical bar sandwich but still pretty good. All of the sandwiches are decent sized.  Average prices are between 7 and 10 dollars."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast in Vegas.  This place beats Black Bear..Babystacks..Jamms..IHOP.  thankfully it's in my neighborhood and not many people know about the quality of their food.  It's all fresh..generous portions and top quality...prepared in a way that shows they care about what comes out of their kitchen...for a great price.  You cannot beat the service. Never a wait.  Fortunately it's a locals secret..and for Rounders I want them to know they're putting out great food..this is the only place we come for breakfast other than 4 Seasons for occasional special breakfasts.  Glad we finally found it after 6 years of going to the above listed places."}
{"text":"This place is decent.  We went to watch Thursday Night Football and they had great happy hour specials with $2 beers and half off a decent list of items including chicken wings, tri tip quesadilla and lobster quesadilla, chicken bbq pizza, tx chili, and many more items.  The lobster quesadilla was quite decent while the chili was awful but take this from a chili snob from TX.

The tv setup is not as good but if i lived in the area i may frequent b/c of proximity.

It's a decent spot.  I probably won't be back but if you go during happy hour they have decent deals."}
{"text":"Ok I LOVE rounders, do not get me wrong. I have been coming to the blue diamond location for about three years and have never had but amazing service. Well today I went for an early morning drink. And as usual I play music via their touch tunes. I always play a good mix rap, rock, country and of course some good ole Mexican music ie Selena and Elvis Crespo. Nothing crazy like I said a good mix of music and no one has ever complained. Well today I played a nice popular Selena song and about halfway in the owner Ed walks over to me (obviously the only Hispanic customer there) and asks me if I had picked this song. Awkward I go well yes I did why is there a problem. Ed tells me well I just wanted to make sure someone paid for this and it is not a random song, usually we skip music like this. As my jaw drops I ask why. Well Mr. Donald Sterling tells me well it's early in the morning and I don't want people to get uncomfortable  it's almost like playing hardcore rap music with a bunch of F bombs no one wants to hear that. Whoa whoa whoa it's an open juke box and if you don't want certain types of music played then block it. Simple as that. So I tell him to give me my money back and he can skip the song. Ed tells me no that's ok he will let me play my song this time. And I could already see who had complained as an older woman and her maybe mother or friend had a sour look on their face as they were staring at me. Well my response to all of that was hello you are at a bar before noon and there are no listed guidelines on what music to play. So I will take my money somewhere else where my brownness will not offend anyone. Sorry Ed you lost a really loyal customer over two older women and their fear of a little diversity."}
{"text":"This is a great bar to just relax and drink a couple of beers. They have nice single person leather couches to sit on, and the servers are really great. That's one of the things that definitely stands out. 

They also have a decent selection of craft beers, although it took me like 20 times of coming here to even know this. I believe you have to ask them for the craft beer menu.

As far as appetizers, I would stick with the trifecta sliders, the pork skins, and maybe the margarita pizza. I believe they have 50% off apps when games are playing, 4-7 and after midnight? 

I've been here a ton of times and for the most part the crowd is fine. I think only once have I seen the bartender have to kick out rowdy guests. People keep to themselves and I've never had a problem there. At the end of the day this is a locals bar, and it does well in that regard. It is a little hard to find though."}
{"text":"Food was good, not great, but good enough for my family to enjoy a quick meal. the prices were good during happy hour, if it wasn't discounted, I may have been disappointed.   We loved the wings, and would come back for them.  Service was great, friendly waitress.
I wish I could do 3.75 stars, but I'll give it a 4."}
{"text":"This place is great for that late night bar food craving. The Happy Hour here is not too shabby either. 

Friendly bartenders and this place seems to be popping even on off hours. Then again there is a limited selection bear Mountains Edge.

I enjoy the martinis here and they make my absolute dirty martini just the way I like it. I've so far tried most of the breakfast menu. I'm always a fan on breakfast for dinner. The chicken wings are pretty average for bar food. They offer sweet potato fries! So that's a plus in my book. 

You'll probably see me here when it's late, I don't want to cook, and i don't want to drive far. That's pretty often."}
{"text":"You may think this just another PTs type sports bar in Vegas, but the look doesn't match the quality of the food. I've been here over a dozen times and have never had a bad menu item. Everything from the spinach artichoke dip to start, the grilled steak salad, the ahi tuna salad, French dip, wings and so much more just make for a great experience no matter what you're craving. You'll be able to eat some great food while watching any game and have some great service as well. Highly recommend if you haven't been before!"}
{"text":"Solid bar food. You can find a bar like this on pretty much any corner but I will say that Rounders is one of the better ones I have been too. Tommy Knocker Burger was good. Also had the artichoke dip, a bit heavy on the parmesean but over solid."}
{"text":"Be careful!! Price might not be as advertised!!!!

   We stopped by for martini specials. They have a huge sign $5 martinis, $2 draft beers. Service was good. Food was good as well. Drinks ok. We ordered from the martinis special list and two draft beers. As we were ready to pay and check was not as we thought it was going to be. Martinis $7.50 and $5.00 beers, WTF??? I asked the bartender why are martinis $7.50, he says because \"specialty\" martinis are not included on the special. But, they were made with 3 olives, which was the happy hour vodka special.  WHY DIDN'T HE TELL ME THAT BEFORE? I am not cheap, but i hate when businesses try to take advantage of people. I guess my 40% tip on food wasn't good enough!!! Anyway, I tried to get answers and no one was willing to help. Too bad but i'm not coming back at all..."}
{"text":"Just ok!!! Something is missing from the menu (my opinion)....I wanted junk food and just got flat bread and fish and chips....and it was all just ok. Waitress didn't know wines by the glass and acted like I put her out to ask her what they were.....sorry....I drink wine!
Kids had mini burgers and pasta....it was just ok. I have fish and chips and they were good...I have been here before and sat in the bar area and the bartenders were great and friendly.
This isn't my favorite bar in the Mnt Edge area....sad because it is so close."}
{"text":"I stopped through here last night to grab a quick drink with a friend and some food to go. The man working the bar was very nice and gave me prompt and accurate service, he kept the shots coming! He also took care of all of the drinks between my friend and I since I gambled a bit. I understand bartenders don't necessarily have to do that so I appreciated it. 
My friend got some chicken fingers to go and they smelled so amazing! The only downfall of this place is it felt kinda dark and dingy. I feel like we have so many nice brand new bars within 10 minutes of this place, despite the good service and food it just didn't stand out to me and I felt the atmosphere all around was kind of lacking. But maybe it was the person I was with LOOOL so 4 stars for this place they just need a little re vamping"}
{"text":"First of all if you do not like smoke don't come here. Second of all if you are a diner or parent who can tolerate it in a separate room then you will be surprised how great the food is here.

Rounders is a amazing bar with amazing food! They also have a separate dining room but the smoke can waft over so if your freaked out about that then don't come here. Every time I ask my kid (who's 6 now) where she wants to go for dinner she says Rounders...

The staff is great no matter how busy they are they try their hardest to make sure it is perfect. My husband and I have been going to rounders for about 15 years now... For gambling and drinking only. When we had a child it got hard trying to find places that we could have a sit-down dinner and practice with her manners. This became the automatic favorite instead of the typical McDonald's or other fast food option for a small child.

When it is just my husband and I we enjoy going to the bar playing keno and getting appetizers and our drink on!!!! Porter and Sasha are amazing bartenders who always try to work the entire bar making sure everyone is happy.

As far as the restaurant goes, the staff is  is over flow from the bar. Don't forget to be patient with them as they are still serving food for the entire place.  Being regulars they always treat us amazing. 

As far as the menu goes they have everything from apps specials for the day and a really good chef who continues 2 add something extra special every couple months to change it up. Lastly don't forget about the happy hour specials which are awesome.

Honestly we've tried other little hole in the Wall's around our neighborhood and this by far is the best"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Rounders for the past 6 years, since I turned 21. Since then, the food has been consistently good. In general, I can be really iffy about eating bar food, but they do a great job. My favorites have been the turkey burger and the grilled chicken sandwich. I recommend getting them with the pretzel bread, which is amazing.

The chicken fingers were an old favorite of mine. The fries are really good. And the warm homemade chips and the dip they give you with it are amazing. And just recently I tried the steak and cheese quesadilla for half price during happy hour, and it was bomb dot com!

Furthermore, I am a fan of craft beer. I like that they have a good selection of craft beer bottles. I do prefer draught beer, but the bottle selection they have appeals to me more than their draught selection, and I like that I have that option. Also, the service has always been excellent."}
{"text":"Locals spot. Industry people. Late night option. Great happy hour here. Fast service and large selection of beers. Great setup and parking lot is accommodating. The decor inside is very \"man cave\" styled."}
{"text":"First time I came here a couple months ago, I was cruising for something open late night, but i didn't feel like drive thru crap. So, i decided to go in & order something to go. I got the ahi tuna wraps & sliders, to go. I was really surprised how awesome & fresh everything was. Great portions, not greasy bar food at all. So, tonight when I just  couldn't  decide what I was hungry for, my memory went back to my first experience.  Uh, so round II not so good. Straight away, I call & say:  \"Hi, I have an order for pickup.\"   Douche bartender : \"You mean you'd like to place an order to pick up?\".  Ok, I didn't know that this was for a fucking grade but whatever, so I say  \"Uh, yeah .\"   So, long story short, I order the ahi tuna wraps that I so loved the first time around, and the Texas rock shrimp & jalapeños w/drambuie dipping sauce.  When I open the box, I got lettuce cups brimming with a shitload of minced water chestnuts & scant few strips of completely unseasoned ahi. Very sad. My Texas rock gulf shrimp looked more like dried up microscopic sea monkeys, with watery ass mustard sauce. Oh, and my husband got the KC Burger which he found to be average. Grand total for a jerkoff to correct my diction, sub par shrimp, and lettuce cup \"filler\" = 32.96  All and all, from the difference in my experiences, I'd say that it's highly likely that management has changed, and gone straight to the business of cutting corners via food quality, & experienced kitchen staff.  I'm not interested in going back. The food quality really was the hook for this place."}
{"text":"There is no need for a long ass review.  If the kitchen simply takes 30 minutes to cook a damn burger, they need to get their shit straight.  It's 11:30pm, and probably 10 people here which half of them are drinking only.  There is no good reason for it to take this long to make a \"firehouse burger\" with fries.

Sat down and didn't get acknowledged probably until 10 minutes after sitting down.  Had to go and ask for a food menu. 

I'll never come back here again."}
{"text":"Rounders us awesome. I love their chicken strips and my wife n kid like the chicken noodles. We dine in occasionally but, mostly do take out."}
{"text":"Loved everything!  First time didn't think we could dine here because of a young adult with us but they have a separate dining room"}
{"text":"Rounders is another one of those bars in Vegas with better than the environment food and cheap drinks. They have a nice seating area around the bar with big comfy chairs which is a big plus.

On the minus, the environment itself is a little mediocre at times. We literally had a catfight between two women bust out here where the bartenders and such did little to react and service can be a little slow at times. You can't really fault a business for the actions of the customers, but I think an attentive staff would have noticed these women were too drunk and screaming at each other for quite a while.

As for the food in particular, I've had probably 8-10 different things here and most of them are tasty. For example, the lobster quesadilla has big chunks of \"lobster,\" but it does taste like lobster at least. The steak quesadilla is really good, and my favorite might even be the chili cheese dog. One thing that didn't come out that well was the mini hot dogs. Scooter's version is 10x better. The sliders are average, but the wings are pretty good.

Best of all though is that nearly half the time it seems like they have a happy hour going. All football games and like 2-7pm and 12-3am are happy hours, and all the food above costs around 4-5 dollars when it's half off. It's an absolute steal!"}
{"text":"Great little bar close to my house. Food is decent, drinks are good and the prices are fair. Not much to complain about here. I have had breakfast, lunch, and dinner-Drinks included. I do love the little bottled beer fridge. It's one of our go to bars just to get out and stay close to home."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 4-5 years now. This is my very own personal \"Cheers.\" The staff is great during any time of day. Ashley, Burke, Rachel, Chris, Dan, Greg, there's always someone awesome behind the bar. You can't go wrong coming here. Food is your standard bar fare. But, always taste great with a beer."}
{"text":"Recently moved to the area, so we are checking out the local places for \"regular\" food.
Had lunch here and was pleased with our food and service so decided to return for dinner a couple days later. Limited menu choices for dinner entrees, but we were both very pleased with our meals. Hubby had the special, Chicken Parmesan with side of garlic butter pasta and broccoli. I had the Mediterranean Market Salad.  Both dishes were presented nicely, good sized portions and most importantly tasted great. I hate sweet salad dressings, so was ecstatic with the delicious tart dressing on my salad.
We will be back here as regulars for sure."}
{"text":"Another great experience at Rounder's. So far it's always been dinner. The food is great, fast and tonight when they ran out of one appetizer and a dessert they comped us the alternate dessert. The wait staff is always helpful, chipper and fast, you're never waiting around for service or to get your check. It's always clean, the tables, the restrooms and the glasses. Even the ice water is pure and delicious, not gritty or muggy. The menu isn't maybe that extensive but everything on there is good and made consistently. Try the prime rib dip or kickin chicken. Amazeballs."}
{"text":"This place should get 7 stars!!  It's the only true pub that serves good restaurant quality food  anywhere along Blue Diamond Rd.  The others are just finger foods and burgers. 
So, speaking of Burgers. Rounders actually makes the only Turkey Burger I've ever been able to eat in my entire life. I've tried them nearly everywhere and I can only eat Rounders. The appetizers are awesome especially during Happy Hours everyday and the dinners and side dishes are great. Since I live around the corner it's like a home away from home even though I'm not a big drinker or gaming person. Yes, of course there are more upscale options which would be considerably more expensive but when comparing pubs to pubs this place is tough to beat. 
The head bartender/Mgr... Porter is not only a warm, welcoming gentleman but he engages the customers in good conversation. The rest of the bar staff....Laura, Gurley, Rebecca, Ava and the others are awesome and attentive as well. You won't ever wait for a drink!!  The other great thing is that you can eat quietly in the restaurant and non smoking section or eat at the bar which I usually do and or take out service.  You can watch the games from either spot in the pub. The waitress staff are incredibly friendly, funny, always smiling and provide great service. I'm only sorry that I don't know all of their names at this moment but I do know every face....:)  And yes...they are all pretty...There you go, I said it and why would reviewers not mention a great looking staff.   
I see some complaints here that I've never ever experienced in 4 years so it could've been just a bad night for whoever served you as nobody is perfect in this world and we all have bad nights once in a while. 
Since I was also a bartender in NYC for about 20 years I can tell for sure that we all make mistakes but try our best to make you happy. From what I've seen if they screw up your drink they will normally simply make you a new one with a smile."}
{"text":"Sunday football head quarters. If I want to see my best friend during football season, this is where to find her. Cheap happy hour and cheap food specials. Decent neighborhood bar, way better than T-Birds or The Lodge, in my opinion."}
{"text":"Good here is delicious. Check out the deals during happy hour you won't regret it. The waitress we had was super friendly. She changed the tvs so we could watch the Olympics. Go USA!! We ordered wings, bbq burger and the steak quesadilla everything was delicious! Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"We stopped in today for a quick drink. Crystal the bartender was so friendly and personable. She introduced herself to us right away and asked us our names. 

We couldn't stay long as we were on our way to an appointment. We'll definitely be back and stay longer just because Crystal made us feel so welcomed!!

LP"}
{"text":"I ordered two things to go via phone. I got home and it was the complete wrong thing, I called and the bartender, Will,  gave me a hard time about getting a refund. This is the second time I had ordered food and it was completely wrong. I told him I ordered off the online menu and he just kept arguing with me. I have gone in person and he has been the same way this is a great location and I feel like this late-night staff is ruining it. Smh, 
Specially the online menu says they have an oriental chicken salad, I got a salad with feta cheese and roasted red peppers.. Smh, it's the owners fault for not keeping things accurate and the bartenders fault for not offering to make me something different of offering a refund. Smh. It's an inconvenience, especially on my birthday. 
Too many things have been wrong when I corn in late, including the bartenders attitude . this is not the place to ever try again."}
{"text":"Food never disappoints, and the drinks are always wet :)  We usually hit Rounders late night and Juan always treats us great!!  if you live in the Mtns Edge area this bar is worth your time to visit."}
{"text":"Just moved to mountains edge and I really enjoy this bar! Everyone was really nice. We have some BBQ and I thought it was delicious!"}
{"text":"About two months ago my wife and I decided to find some breakfast. . We had arrived late but they were incredibly nice and wound up providing a breakfast menu to us. We had noticed a lot of Bronco fans go here, which was nice. We are fans of NFL and Broncos. So we get a Denver, Colorado feeling to this place. 

What turns out is their menu has some really great Colorado inspired flavors like the Chili Verde. 

The breakfast menu doesn't have a bad tasting meal on it. My absolute favorite is there country fried steak. It's a dead ringer for perfection. Thank you!! 

We had dinner there tonight and couldn't be happier. Hard to choose from all items but chose the ribs, was very happy. Fall of the bone, super awesome sides, great beer selection. 

I am always happy to come here. . You won't find bad tastes here! 

Try it!"}
{"text":"Well went back to this place since I like the juke box and apparently they favor certain gamblers over anyone else.  Put some money in the juke box and selected a wide variety of music. I was drinking and my wife was  gambling so we spent a good amount of money this night. Well apparently the bar tenders have their favorite customers so every time this one guy didn't like my music , which if it wasn't from the 70s, he would make the bartender skip my paid for songs. Now I like 70s music but not the whole night. The bartender did say she would comp our bill but when she started skipping all my music I was pissed especially when that guy started talking crap. Called the manager the next day to file a complaint, he told me that they had problems of bartenders favoring certain customers and she should of written the songs down, let it play and delete the song later. The manager said he would remove the juke box since it was causing him too many problems. I never went back since that night due to that issue never really being resolved. I was really pissed at the way the bartender handled the situation and I will probably punch out that guy for talking shit about military. There are better places like Hooters where I can spend my money and not worry about being mistreated."}
{"text":"My hubby and I come here on the weekends for breakfast. Staff is friendly and breakfast is great! Breakfast ends at 11am so get there before then. I have had their appetizers and they were good too. Haven't been in the bar area."}
{"text":"Celebrated St Patricks day here.  We went to a couple bars in the area that night and this one had the best waitress, drinks, eats and seating; by far our favorite.  We found it to be the best bar in the area for drinks with friends and we will be back.  You got to try the giant pretzel!"}
{"text":"Great service, great drinks, Jael was a great waitress and I can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"Service was a bit slow. Our waitress, I guess also worked in the bar serving to? We couldn't find her and then we see her coming in from the bar side emptied handed. Hmmm. .  Food is good, prices a little higher than expected. But overall it was an okay experience."}
{"text":"This bar was nice but not a whole lot to do. There was no pool table and limited gaming. The bartneders were great but probably will not come back"}
{"text":"Great bar by my sons and daughter in laws..video poker and love the trivia game machine..good service and food..the fish tacos were great with a happy hour price of 50% off. Enjoy coming over here..watch a game or grab something to eat"}
{"text":"We go here maybe 1-2 times a month, and the waitress always remembers our drink order for the whole family. So friendly and welcoming. The staff is great and the food is pretty good too."}
{"text":"We get take out from here.  Huge well-done wings, great big juicy burgers (try it with a pretzel bun) done a perfect medium-rare or whatever temperature you want instead of your usual over-cooked hockey puck, and healthy portions.  You can tell they cook fresh ground meat that hasn't been frozen.  Never been disappointed here.  I usually get the chili verde and a bunch of other stuff but am usually too full after the chili verde to eat anything else.  By far the best fries all over town.  They stay crispy even after we get them home.  Love this place."}
{"text":"Been coming and ordering from here for a few years. Delicious nachos. Everyone is really nice and welcoming unless you talk to Rachel. She is condescending and has bad attitude problem, avoid her and you'll have a nice time."}
{"text":"The best food every time. Very nice people too. I love Rounders!"}
{"text":"Love Rounders happy hour. Good selection great prices and good food. Food came out fast . Very nice staff."}
{"text":"This is my favorite bar to go to!!! Right by Mountains Edge, very easy to get in and out of. We always go during happy hour, which is amazing. During any football game they run the happy hour specials too. I recommend the quesadillas and tacos. Always amazing service from the waitresses and bartenders, love Porter! Go Broncos!"}
{"text":"Came in here with one of my girlfriends to catch up.  We both ordered drinks, I sat there and fed the machine atleast $160.  I had 2 drinks, my gf had 1.  As we were gettin ready to leave the monday day bartender gave me a bill for all 3 drinks. I get ONE drink for my friend but for ALL of them when I was playing?   Coming from a gaming bar myself I should have said something but didnt want to waste my time esp when it took her 15 minutes to get our first drink.  Who ever trains your bartenders, please teach them to keep track of your gamers so that they are comp'd accordingly.  Def wont be back to waste my $.  I'll go to the bar up the street where they take care of their gamers."}
{"text":"Nice bar, friendly bartender, food good, not great, clean ambiance, and lots of tvs"}
{"text":"Excellent wings! Burgers are great too. Good beer selection too. They usually have Pranqster, which I'm a big fan of. Great service too!"}
{"text":"My friends and I had a blast here last night.. The bartender with the spiky hair and goatee was on point and probably one of the best bartenders in Vegas,,,"}
{"text":"Lobster Quesadillas are to die for! 2pm - 7pm happy hour 50% off apps and drinks! So dank!"}
{"text":"Was very disappointed with our service last night. This is my 3rd time there usually go for the midnight happy hour. Four people in my party and 2 ordered wings. They came still frozen in the middle. When we told the server he just took them off the table. He never apologized for them or asked if we wanted something else. We requested them to go thinking he would comp us or at least only charge for 1. Nope charged for both no discount and waited over 35 minutes for our food."}
{"text":"A friend that lives down the street said this place had amazing food. I was a little sketchy, you know bar food isn't all that great. I was so wrong! They're philly cheese steak sandwich was the best I've had in Vegas! Really good on meat portions and fresh bread. I've tried they're Mahi too and it was fresh! Great prices, great food, great service. And they have happy hour prices for food and drinks."}
{"text":"$1.50 beers during happy hour (liquor is a bit pricey though)- or during any football game. Good deal.  Bartenders are nice and the place is clean. Could stand to have better ventilation...come home smelling like a cigarette after going there. They do have a non-smoking dining area with bar service and tvs for watching the games. The food is great and reasonably priced. Half price apps during happy hour.  Video poker if you feel like gambling. Also has a few nice (p)leather chairs with coffee tables in the middle if you dont feel like sitting at the bar.  I'd go there more often, but they do not have a pool table and told me that they wont be getting one because it would eat into their seating too much. Overall a good neighborhood bar where you see the same faces every time and the bartenders remember your name."}
{"text":"I have been to Rounders a few times now and I feel the need to update my review for one reason and one reason only - their Pulled Pork Sandwich. If you are hungry and anywhere near Buffalo and Blue Diamond, you MUST make it a point to head to Rounders and try this sandwich. It's not a happy hour item, so stop in any time! It's only $7.99 with fries. Simply put, it's one of the most amazing pulled pork sandwiches I've ever had. I think a big reason is because of the pretzel bun on which it's served. It really makes the sandwich.

Overall, I think Rounders serves some of the best bar food in town. In fact, I think their food is good compared to non-bar restaurants. I'm proud to call it my local bar."}
{"text":"had a burger from here on a pretzel bun.... it tasted like an over cooked hockey puck... the fries here tasted like deep fried potatoes.... they kept playing \"red solo cup\" on the juke box, it was funny the first 30 seconds into it, but the 4 time i heard it i felt like cramming a a red hot steak knife into my ear drum.  I probably should have."}
{"text":"Always liked this place until now.  Ordered the Asian salad with chicken to go.  Got home and the chicken was bad...as in rotten, spoiled-it can make you sick, bad.  How could they not tell?  I could smell it as soon as I opened the container and you could see that the chicken had that slimy coating on it.  Yes, I know - disgusting."}
{"text":"Came here with a girlfriend for happy hour since I seem to be spending a lot of time on this side of town.
She comes here often and knows everyone who works here so we had amazing service. I am on a quest to try dirty martinis every where I go so I of course had  a few here and they were pretty friggen good.
But the highlight was the lobster quesadilla..it was filled with chunks of lobster and was very large. Perfect for two to share.
I cant wait to get back there and enjoy happy hour again..it was a bargain! My new favorite place in town for sure."}
{"text":"Rounders is my first and favorite bar. Greg, chris, burke, best bartenders in vegas. Biggest cocks ever. I would gladly come here every night and swallow every thing they pour."}
{"text":"Love this place! Best pretzel and desert! Customer service was friendly and the place inside was clean and smoke free. Will definitely return here again in the future. A+"}
{"text":"The food is decent with their half-off specials, but the bar staff seems lazy and apathetic. You have to constantly wave them down to get service. 

Perhaps they don't like men who come in alone. I'd be better off sitting in the restaurant section so I could at least be waited on, but I prefer to sit at the bar when I'm solo.

I honestly got better conversation from the server than the bar staff. They also won't add food to your bar tab! You have to pay 2 separate bills in this place if you order food at the bar! What a hassle.

Not a lot of people under 45 hang out here so forget about hooking up with anybody decent. Just a bunch of frumpy baby boomers. It kinda reminds me of Tommy Rockers near the strip.

This shit hole needs a good face lift and hopefully a better clientele will follow."}
{"text":"The best hands down hotwings and the customer service was amazing I'll be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Living in Moutain's Edge, this is our go to bar for that local feel and personalized service. We have only been a few times now but I am addicted to the Tuna Crisps and if you go on monday when there is a game going on, you can get half price appetizers. I believe you can also get them from 3-7pm happy hour as well (still doing my research on that as I have to find out when I can get the crisps at the best price so I can have more than one order :-)) Additionally Cory usually serves us at the bar and he remembers our drinks each time. The drinks are also reasonably priced during these times as well.
If you play the games at the bar (and in some instances you have to to sit there) bet 4 at a time and the bar will keep you from getting parched.
It definitely gets crowded on the nights there are games on and if you dont sit at the bar it could take a minute to get a waitress over to take your order, but a trick we use is that we go to the bar and order our drinks and take them over to where we want to sit (big cushy chairs by the telly) and Cory usually asks if we want food. Problem solved :-)"}
{"text":"It's 2 am and I was hungry and most places was already closed. So I got fried calamari and steak salad...all for $24!!! Price is fair as long as you get good reasonable quality....but here I did not...!!! Calamari was deep fried way too long that the calamari shrink to nothing , so basically eating fried breading. Steak salad (I ordered medium rare) was okay~ish. Steak was pretty good but burnt the outside of the steak, so every time you take a bite, you have that ashy burnt taste to it, not pleasant!!! So overall, don't come here around 2 am and ordering pick up...not a good idea!!"}
{"text":"Well I haven't been here for a while now BUT as usual I'm never disappointed. They have a nice family friendly dining room - smoke -FREE and a awesome bar area nicely designed for when I feel like relaxing and feeling lucky  great place to visit"}
{"text":"Love coming here for breakfast. The steak and eggs is really good. It's a large steak with a lot of flavor. The service is always good plus it's never busy."}
{"text":"One of the better neighborhood bars in Vegas. The happy hour prices are insane and the food is always great. The ahi tuna crisis are my favorite. Go during Monday night football and you're almost guaranteed to win a prize at the half time drawing. Service is great everywhere in the place. It always has people there so its a social atmosphere, but never crowded to the point of being unpleasant. Great bar."}
{"text":"Wow smokey but hey it's a bar right but seriously smoke smoke and more smoke. But the main reason for my bad review is they advertise happy hour till 7pm but nope they changed that to 6? So basically there website advertised hours are not honored."}
{"text":"Okay it's been updated again. New menu most of The fried food has been replaced with fresh cooked dishes. Had a salmon that was just bomb. Three cheers for the new menu"}
{"text":"No longer my favorite tavern in the Mountains Edge area.  They've had a problem for quite some time.  The problem is long waits to be served in the main dining area.  Sometimes this is caused by heavy business in the bar area, but many times it's caused by the wait staff being in the back and forgetting to check the front for customers.  

Yesterday morning was the worst.  When I came in I could tell the bartender saw me enter.  I was alone in the dining room at the time (it was after the time when the dining area opens).  I sat and waited, and waited and waited.  A couple came in and waited, and waited, and waited.  A man who is either the chef or the manager came in from the bar area.  He obviously has no peripheral vision because he didn't notice either set of customers.  I guess I could have screamed or thrown something at him to get his attention, but it's his (and the rest of the staff's) job to notice customers, not for the customers to be noticed.

So he walked by and started having a personal conversation with the waitress in the back.  Both the other couple and I could hear it.  The phrase \"Hey, you have customers waiting to see menus and give their orders\" was not uttered during the conversation.  The other couple left, yelling \"Bye!\"  I thought \"what a good idea\" and started to leave too.  Just then the man and waitress came out, but it was too late.  I informed them that they lost my business and other business due to the overly long wait.

I ended up eating at The Lodge on Shelbourne."}
{"text":"My review is for the burgers only. Hands down best bar burgers in our neighborhood. They are juicy and do not taste like frozen patties. They're huge and come with delicious hot and fresh out of the oil fries. YUM!"}
{"text":"Chicken wings are delicious, never will I go back to buffalo wild wings when I'm craving wings!!"}
{"text":"Chili and fries are the best. The bar tenders Megan, Chris, and Krystal are amazing. The places is great for regulars who want to come in and unwind for the day."}
{"text":"Their breakfast is simply awesome. Great service. Plentiful ingredients. Beats any of the other 'breakfast places' in town in every way possible. 

The omelettes are terrific and so are the pancakes!"}
{"text":"Favorite local watering hole! All of the bartenders are awesome and the servers are too. I love coming here after work for a drink and some food. I really love the salads! Great happy hour specials too."}
{"text":"Just like many of the other bars that serve food out here. the dining area is separate though and wasnt very crowded so it was pretty quiet. my sister had a wrap with sweet potato fries, i had a penne dish with spinach, chicken, and some other things.  but i really just ate the pasta and picked at everything else. best parts of the meal were the sweet potato fries and the garlic bread that came with my pasta. my pasta was good though, and reheated well as lunch the next day. it was a way bigger serving than i had expected."}
{"text":"Tri tip quesadilla was really yummy. Staff was really friendly. Good selection of beer."}
{"text":"It's a solid local spot. 24/7 with good food and friendly service. Fun place to watch football. They are partial to broncos."}
{"text":"This is my spot! The food is amazing, I love their hummus, burgers, Flatbreads, Fries...everything.  Girlie, Porter, Ryan and Will treat my boyfriend and I like family. It really is a great spot to enjoy some great food and drinks!!!"}
{"text":"Bar is great, clean and fun. I love the staff. My boyfriend and I go to Rounders often, its our local bar and every time we go it is always a good time. We love to go there because the bartenders are great people and we enjoy watching sports but most of all the food is great. They have a great menu and their lettuce wraps, BBQ flat bread pizza, Kettle Chips and burgers are great. They have great happy hours with deals on appetizers, martini's and draft beer. They have a martini list that is delicious, they are all so good, orange creamcicle, cherry cheesecake, raspberry lime, key-lime and espresso coffee is my favorite. 
Over all best bartenders, martinis, draft beer deals and happy hour, added bonus great food. 
Highly recommend stopping in for a great chat with the staff, happy hour or dinner you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Came here to watch some football of course and I think I found my new favorite bar. Porter (the bartender) is awesome. His energy and his presents is very welcoming. Along with the other employees here, everyone is very nice. I will definitely come back here next Sunday. Oh and you can't go wrong with $3 PBR."}
{"text":"Nott enough machines at the bar. They have more machines separate from the bar. Excellent service and drinks were never empty but machines are very tight."}
{"text":"Unbelievably outstanding food.  Staff is on key.  Greatest place to eat.  Service is on point"}
{"text":"Sound the alarms: HAPPY HOUR ALERT! Not all Rounders are created equal because this location does not believe in the regular 2-3 hour special. Instead they run a 2pm-2am happy hour with $2 Rounders' draft, $3 well drinks, $4 wines, $5 Three Olives martinis, and half off food. 

A couple of friends and I had just finished playing tennis and was looking for a place that did reverse happy hour. When we called to see if they had one, the woman who picked up the phone sounded really confused and didn't know what that was. If I had to work at a place that had happy hour for half the day, I would be confused too. 

We ended up getting the sliders trio; a combination of a pulled pork, beef in a green chili sauce, and a buffalo chicken mini sandwich. All three was good, but sliders are sliders. The seared ahi stackers with the Asian slaw was amazing for a bar. The chili con queso was a soup. It lacked the consistency of a dip, but as it cooled down it got thicker. The lobster quesadilla is no joke. The folded cheese tortilla was stuffed full of luscious lobster meat. Smear some guacamole and spoon on that pico and I went to town. This is one of the best bar experiences I have experienced. Three drinks and four appetizers between three people came out to $32 before tip. That is a steal and their serving size is no joke either. This will not be a late night spot because I already see the aftermath. At least I know I will not have to rush here to catch the tail end of a happy hour."}
{"text":"Happy hour 4-7pm. $2 Coors Light and PBR, $3 well drinks, $5 Three Olives Martinis, and a list of half off appetizers. A few friends and I stopped in for a quick drink before we went to a BBQ. Although we did not get anything to eat, it did not stop me from looking. Lobster quesadillas and stuffed potato skins, wings, sliders, and so much more were available to be devoured in a drunken haze. 

With plenty of comfortable leather chairs, stools around the bar, and tables off to the side, it was not hard to find a place to sit. Within minutes a waitress came around to take our drink orders. With the price, no one is going to go broke while getting happy.    17 different flavors of vodka will ensure a martini to satisfy."}
{"text":"Great place. Friendly employees and great food. Try the shrimp tempura. It's the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Met new friends at this bar kinda near my house!   Good prices ...food was standard bar good.  But our server was this totally cool funny lady!   Made great conversation. Like we almost wanted her to hang out!   Awesome cus service!!!"}
{"text":"The staff was so nice & accommodating we popped in for a night cap on my bday & they whipped up a dessert w/ candles & sang happy birthday to me! Super special service good martini's nice bartenders!"}
{"text":"Citycoups had a coupon for the place and we were in the area so we decided to hit up happy hour and get the $10 match play for video poker there.  Pretty similar to most other decent sports bars around and you certainly can't beat 99 cent mugs of the house brew.  DIdn't have any of the food but it looked pretty decent from what we saw other customers eat.

You can find the coupon here: http://citycoups.com/rounders.html"}
{"text":"Local bar, great location and awesome service. Get to know the bartenders, they'll treat ya right."}
{"text":"I stopped in here only one time with my graveyard bartender buddy from Hooters to see Juan, one of the graveyard bartenders at Rounders (who kicks ass by the way). From my first impression this is a very nice place! A lot newer than most other local bars with gaming. And one of the few places in the Mountains Edge area. When I lived in Mountains Edge I couldn't wait for this place to open but moved too soon!

If you live in Mountains Edge this is a \"must go\" destination for you. If you live nearby in the SW it's worth the short trip to check this place out."}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood bar! They have an extensive beer list which was great. I opted for the Lost Coast Tangerine Wheat beer. I've been to the Lost coast brewery and loved their beers, and once again I wasn't disappointed. A pint (bottle) for 7.75 is a pretty good deal. Our bartender was very friendly and attentive, our waitress was the same. I ordered the Tuscany chicken sandwich and my husband got the KC burger. (as a smoker I was happy to be able to eat and smoke and drink in one place- sorry non smokers) The food was excellent! The burger thick and juicy, the chicken sandwich very flavorful. WE have definitely found our new local hangout!"}
{"text":"Came for breakfast and the portions were very large.  Bacon was crisp - toast was thick - eggs were prepared exactly as requested.  The server was super sweet and nice.  The pancakes were fluffy and yummy.  This was our first time there and we will kost definitely be back."}
{"text":"95% of the menu is cooked in the deep fat fryer. Super smokey even in the non-smoking restaurant area. 

Would never go here if we had more options in the Mountain's Edge area."}
{"text":"My local dive bar, where everyone knows your name.  Prime rib on Fridays is a must try.  During the week happy hour ends at 6pm.  Not a lot of food options on happy hour so prepare to pay the regular price (wish they'd change that).  You will leave smelling like an ashtray in the bar area, fair warning."}
{"text":"A typical all American eatery/sports bar. The dining room is separated from the bar, making it family-friendly. The food was good, but not great. Both the burger and gyro pita sandwhich could have used a little more seasoning. The service was great and speedy. We would gladly return and recommend to friends."}
{"text":"Im not really sure how this place got 4 stars on yelp.  Anyway, I was convinced to take me and my girl out there and yes I will grant the service was friendly but the place smelled funny and the food tasted even funnier...almost as though it was cooked in contaminated water.  

Bottom line:  I would rather take a look at the dollar menu at McDonald's than come here.  My food would have come faster, cheaper, and tasted better.  It makes Chili's look like the Ritz Carlton and I know I can have dinner for 2 for $20 there easily.  I know this sounds harsh but I do eat a lot around Vegas and don't want others to have this experience."}
{"text":"Seared Ahi Tuna Crisp was the best. Very comfortable place to eat and hangout.  The  waitresses are very friendly.  :o)"}
{"text":"This was the first place in Vegas that I ate at on my own when I moved out here in 2011.  It became my regular place for dinner and weekend drinks; as my comfort level with the city grew I expanded my regular locations and now only hit this spot once every few months. Each time I return I kick myself for having been gone so long; 

I really have to give two reviews for this place; the first is for the restaurant; great food; great portions. I love their walleye plate; great fresh fish and flavor; the sauce they serve with it is great; the side dishes and vegetables compliment the flavors elegantly; it's almost like they knew what they were doing  the service can be a little slow to notice you at first but once they realize you are there they are friendly; prompted and always willing to answer questions. Oh and you will absolutely love the Lobster Quesadilla. I can't come here without ordering one.  

I've mentioned before in my reviews that I love hot wings; these guys have by far the hottest wings I've ever had and I've done the triple nuclear at BWW and a few other crazy hot local restaurants where I had to sign a waiver promising not to sue. Not sure how they get away without a wavier but if you are bold enough I recommend you give them a try. 

On the bar side of things; you can still order from the full menu but have to deal with the smokiness of the bar; I like showing up for their many themed parties (Redneck New Years was a blast!) they are always running some type of special even if it's not \"happy hour\" I really think they have happy hour 3-4 times a day here. 

The regulars from Mountain Edge/Gate are very nice and easy to talk to and get along with and every time I visit here I leave with a smile on my face;"}
{"text":"This poker bar has potential to be a fun hangout spot, but a few roadblocks are in place. I went on a Thursday evening to meet a few friends and redeem a text club promo for $40 play to bring a new slot club member. The location is not ideal, with what appears to be a vacant office building behind the building where Rounders is. There was a person sleeping in the alcove close to the Rounders entrance, and I was curious to see what was going on behind the building, but thought better of it. Getting into the complex from Buffalo is a pain too, although there's another entrance from Peace. Their sign is pretty cool- it changes colors. 

There were a few customers at the bar when I arrived, and other than our party of 3, it wasn't busy while we were there.  A few more people came in as we were about to leave. I couldn't miss the (multiple) security monitors in full sight of my seat at the bar. Not sure what to make of that! The food is better than decent, and the chicken fingers and fries I tasted were excellent. My friend had chicken sliders and said they were also pretty good. This is annoying- they have different people dealing with food orders and beverage orders. When only 2 customers in the entire place are eating, I don't get it. I didn't order food, and probably wouldn't have if I was hungry but had to deal with that! 

For you gaming enthusiasts, their comp policy is available right at the bar! I was intrigued, to say the least. Surprisingly, it doesn't state that one drink per $20 will be comped, as is the norm at many poker bars. It does state that continuous play is required for comped drinks. Fair enough! I posted a pic of the policy with my review. I took advantage of the card of the day promo for hitting a 4 of a kind in 10s, and received $10 to use instantly in my account. Another wacky thing here is the freestanding poker machines. They have about 6 of them and I didn't play those but am a fan of having that option! 
All in all, I walked out a winner, as did both my friends, so that part of the visit was a success!"}
{"text":"A great spot to stop and hang out by mountains edge.  They have great food and the bartenders are always friendly.   It is also a terrific spot to stop for lunch."}
{"text":"I love this place, period! They have great food, I think some of the best wings in town! Their chicken piccata is also one of my absolute favorites. The staff is simply amazing and polite. Great service every time I go."}
