{"text":"I always walked in front of it on my way to some friend's place and I recently decided to try it out. I have to say it's not the best place, the prices are a bit high when compared to other places and the food lacks in flavour. if you're a fan of spicy food, they can go very high on the spicy scale."}
{"text":"Makmak was decent. Not super delicious and slightly overpriced. They carry singha. The tom yum was slightly unusual and not fantastic but I have had worse. The spring rolls were normal. The pork dumplings were good. Good peanut sauce. I haven't tried the pad thai so I cannot judge. Service was good. Cute place too."}
{"text":"People seemed really nice and friendly. I didn't get to experience the service since I was ordering for take-out. The food was disappointing though. First, the dishes were not particularly flavourful and second, I found the amount of noodles and rice to be too abundant compared to the quantity of sauce/meat/soup. The place seems to cater primarily to people who identify as MSG-sensitive, which might account for the lack of flavour."}
{"text":"Ordered vegeterian wonton and vegeterian dumplings for delivery. Both had pork in it. What a wasted Friday night dinner at home!"}
{"text":"Don't know what they're serving, but definately not Thai. One of the only times I've left without finishing my food."}
{"text":"I have been here several times throughout the past 3-4 years and the food has never dissapointed.  Staff is super friendly and overall leaves me with a warm St. Henri kind of feeling.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Went here jonesing for tom yum on a cold winter day between Christmas and New Years. It was quite disappointing. I chose the seafood Tom Yum on the specials list (chalkboard). The broth was good but the seafood was awful. The shrimp were rubbery and over-cooked, the mussels came from a can, the bits of octopus were tough and tasteless, the little bits of veg in the soup hardly worth the effort to pick up with chopsticks. Makmak means \"a lot\", so I was told. My experience there was not."}
{"text":"Small thai influenced resto in St-Henri. Cozy dinning room-I prefer delivery! Large beer selection (30+). Mostly noodle/veggie based dishes, also a selection of soups around $8-12 per dish. You choose your protein (tofu, chicken, beef) and level of spice (1-6). A good deal for the price. They do tend to go easy on the spice so be sure to ask for it if you prefer a kick."}
{"text":"We visited MakMak for the first time recently, and were overall pretty happy with the experience. the restaurant is quaint, and the service is great- the waitress was very hospitable and sweet, and helpful when making the menu selection.  The veggie tomyum soup was awesome. it had a good 'kick' to it. I liked the imperial roll as well, but I found it to be a little bland- although I enjoyed the crispiness. I was a little disappointed with the pad thai- the noodles were kind of soggy and the saucy was pretty salty and tasted a bit like ketchup. I know there are different variations of pad-thai, but generally i like mine with the noodles fried a little longer and crispier and the sauce to have a little more going on. I was also dissapointed with the spice-rating- I ordered a 5 (out of 6) and it wasn't spicy at all!  on the whole, I like makmak and i'll probably be back, but I find it a little overpriced considering the magnitude of cheap thai in montreal."}
{"text":"Bien décevant et beaucoup trop cher pour ce qu'on nous sert. Nous sommes allés chercher pour emporter. Je n'aurais pas mangé sur place, car makmak fait un peu picpic. On s'ennuie de Maison Thaï sur St-Laurent qui n'a jamais rouvert après un incendie."}
{"text":"Went craving a pad Thai. Ordered tofu veggie pad-Thai. Not the best I've had. The sauce is on the sweet side. You can order 6 degrees of spicyness. I tried 3 and felt no heat at all. Had some yellow peppers, green beans, carrots and broccoli. I found the noodles mushy and the bottom of the plate had an accumulation of water. A bit more bean sprouts would have been better. On a positive note the lime was fresh and not dried up.  The veggie peanut butter dumplings were the worst I've ever had. Warmed up in the microwave and stuffed with what tasted like box mashed potatoes. Definitely avoid. Great soup selection. I'll be back to try something else. Friendly service."}
{"text":"After a late night of working, we were seeking quick warm comforting food so we decided to go in. Interestingly enough this place had a flatscreen tv airing the hockey game, and also a beer menu so extensive that it made us look around to see where they could have fit it all.   The menu itself was different, in that the font was so tiny and the place was so dimly lit that we all had a really hard time reading it, and there were so many random stickers placed on half the selection to say it was unavailable. When ordering the server announced to us that his wife was Thai, so we thought we were in for a treat. We decided to share our plates to get a little of everything, we ordered a soup with noodles and wonton, rice dish with shrimp, and the cric crac croc, fried noodles and chicken.   When the plates came, we found the portions to be a little bit on the small size considering the price but nothing could hide our disappointment for the flavour and taste. There seemed to be a common theme for flavour here, sweet, or sweet heat or bland. One of my favourite things about Thai food is the complex layers of herbs, and sauce and spice, you can take a bite, and get a nice little harmony going on, this just left us very disappointed and unsatisfied.   I wish I could recommend it since it's in my neighbourhood, but I can't, it just isn't what Thai food should be, What I do think though, is next time there's a game on, it would be a good place to drink a few beers and watch the game, cause it seemed like that was what everyone else was doing."}
{"text":"I've been walking by MakMak for a few years now, and have never made it in for many reasons. I was finally able to make it in  tonight, with it being a cold late fall evening, I was pleased to see they have a curtain to keep the cold draft out of the sitting area. This is a pretty small space, with seating for 25-30 people. The service was pleasant and helpful, but the menus really need to be updates, with many hand edits done to the inside.   I really enjoyed the food, the spring rolls were tasty and my main dish was delicious, I would recommend eating here, and I will return, for an inexpensive meal. It's not the cheapest, but it's worth the price."}
{"text":"I just ordered to go today. Seriously, it was the worst general Tao ever. Very disappointed. It was almost only rice. I also ordered a the padsew and it was bad. I would not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"I used to go here/have takeout all the time from here, but things have changed in the last ~year... I'm not entirely clear on where there was a change in management or whether management made changes, but the food took a sharp turn for the terrible... I quit going, but backslide every once in awhile and am consistently reminded of why I stopped going. This review comes a while after I last ate there, but I think in a word, everything has gotten less flavourful..."}
{"text":"Je dois avouer avoir commandé du Thaï de chez Makmak pour partager avec des amis en regardant un match de hockey à la maison, donc je ne peux pas dire grand chose par rapport à l'endroit en particulier.  On a commandé un peu de tout. Du cari vert, un pad thai, des rouleaux de printemps et du boeuf au basilic et chili. Pour donner ma commande, j'ai dû répéter certaines choses à quelques reprises et on d'est retrouvé avec 3 fois plus de rouleaux de printemps que prévu. Pour le reste, tout est arrivé comme on l'a demandé et j'ai bien aimé qu'ils gardent le riz et les caris séparés au lieu de les mélanger comme à la \"Thaï Express\". En plus, la livraison est arrivée en 30 minutes comme on me l'avait dit. Tout était bien et bon, mais rien de remarquable. J'aurais aimé un peu plus de saveurs.  Ce qui m'a déçue le plus c'est le livreur. Bien gentil au départ et il s'est assuré qu'on ai bien tout ce qu'il nous faut. Quand est arrivé le temps de lui donner l'argent, je lui ai donné le montant complet de $50 et un extra de $5 pour le pourboire. Je dois avouer ne jamais être certaine combien donner pour des livraisons, et j'ai été très confuse quand il m'a dit sur un aire bête \"Ouin ben un pourboire pour livraison c'est 5% minimum. C'est pas beaucoup ça. \" À moins de ne pas utiliser le même système mathématique, il me semble que je venais juste de lui donner un pourboire de 10%, donc le double du minimum et il s'en plaignait. Se plaindre de mon pourboire n'est pas la meilleure manière d'en avoir plus ou même de m'inciter à retourner au même endroit pour en devenir cliente fidèle.  Donc, si Makmak est ma seule option, le prochaine fois je vais simplement aller chercher ma bouffe moi-même."}
