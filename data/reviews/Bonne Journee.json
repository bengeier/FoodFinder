What a wonderful bakery with so many things to choose from! The eclairs are delicious and so rich and creamy. They also have a wonderful addition of Greek Pastries and the Hellenic cookies are so good! It is so nice to have this little gem in the hood!"}
{"text":"I cannot believe this place hasn't been reviewed yet - it is lovely! The shop itself is cute and homey.  The breads are really yummy and fresh. My boyfriend raved about their pain au chocolat.  I don't know if this is a regular item, but I picked up a couple of churros there and normally I don't like donuts or fried doughy things because they taste too greasy, but omg, their churros were light and awesome. 
Support this place!!"}
