{"text":"I love Sjolinds for many reasons.  The food is fantastic. Since I'm usually there in the morning, I get a scone or piece of quiche right out of the oven. They are simply fantastic! I've never had food there that I didn't like or wasn't good. Besides pastries, the also have a combination of in house crafted chocolates and treats as well as some from all over the world to purchase. Their hand made truffles are amazing! The coffee is nothing special (this isn't a starbucks or coffee shop), but it passes well to accompany the breakfast foods. They also carry an assortment of juice boxes and milk for little ones. You can get day old scones and bakery treats for a fraction of the cost and they are still quite delicious!   The atmosphere is nice and local. There is local artwork and pictures from local events. There is also a bulletin board to advertise local events and activities. When you first walk in from the street, don't be deceived by what seems to be a small amount of seating. There is twice as much seating in the back. They also have a stash of toys for little ones to play with. This is definitely a family environment. You can also find lots of locals here talking shop or catching up.   The staff has always been friendly and kind. This is a family owned and run business, and it shows! We are always warmly greeted and they love to interact with my 2 year old son.   Overall, this is a great local gem of a business. Sjolinds has the right combination of good food, quality service, and welcoming environment. If you are in Madison, you definitely need to stop in!"}
{"text":"Chocolate lover's heaven on earth . . . amazing selection of all kinds of chocolate from around the world."}
{"text":"An oasis in Mt. Horeb, which is otherwise devoid of espresso based drinks. The place is quaint, the employees will on occasion exude a certain small town friendliness very typical of the Midwest. The iced latte (with soy) that I had was equal in quality to any offerings in Madison, which is sadly still without a third-wave coffee shop. They also serve food, having sampled their gorgonzola chicken salad with dried cranberries and a slice of their diablo chocolate cake, both of which were made in house and were decently good but not amazing. One of my favorite spots in Mt. Horeb."}
{"text":"Excellent coffee and chocolate, friendly service, ample space to sit and chat with others or catch up on work. Saw a long list of hot chocolate flavors by the counter--I definitely plan to pick up one of those next time! Affordable prices, too...I believe my 12 oz brewed coffee was $1.75 in house and I also got a second fill-up."}
{"text":"Such a fantastic little place!  It's more of a coffee shop/restaurant than a chocolate shop with excellent baked goods.  They have a great selection of scones, muffins, cupcakes and other deserts, but I'm probably an even bigger fan of their savory items, like their rotating quiche and meat pie selections.  Their coffee is quite delicious and the place is cozy and the staff is very welcoming.  They recently expanded and probably doubled their available seating."}
{"text":"As others have said, this is a quaint store that is imbued with a comforting homeyness. If I lived close I think I would be a regular for a new chocolate treat each week.  On my visit I sampled the french hot chocolate a beef and onion pie and the chocolate raspberry scone. The pie was alright though I would have prefered a stronger flavor and the scone was quite delicious. Next time I'll also try a milk chocolate hot chocolate option.  Good luck to you Sjolind. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"they use real everything here for ingredients, and it makes no sense to get coffee anywhere else in mount horeb, plus staff is always super friendly"}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat in Mount Horeb for breakfast and lunch. They are not open for dinner. Excellent caffeine, baked goods, quiche, sandwiches. I love them. Friendly service and hard workers. Worth every cent spent."}
{"text":"Lunch food is of outstanding quality - like the best N.Europe home cooking of your aunt or neighbor who is an excellent cook. Potato salad was very fresh, balanced (not at all sweet), super. Same for blue cheese chicken salad, sausage plate with pickled radish and a honey fig raisin bread... Again outstanding with the tomato soup - and the scone for dessert.  Whoever is running that kitchen has taken cues from the best of Gourmet Magazine or just their own refined palate. A welcome departure from typical restaurant fare.  Order at counter; plenty of pleasant coffee shop/cafe style seating. Lots of import chocolates as well but we focused on the lunch fare."}
{"text":"Delicious. Friendly staff and customers (who I could only assume are regulars in this fine, close to home shop!). I love places that provide smiles with their service and the artichoke quiche is something I will definitely be back for! Although the list of not only quiche flavors but scones, coffee flavors, and pastries alone will garuntee another trip!"}
{"text":"A great small town coffee shop. They know my name. They know my drink order. They even know that when they don't have the scone I want what my second choice will be!  Funny story: I was telling one of the owners that their vanilla lattes were my favorite and I said \"Isn't that weird? I would think a vanilla latte would have the same ingredients no matter what.\" She told me it wasn't weird that theirs tastes different as they make their own syrups. OHHH. Yummy.  Just know that this is not Starbucks where they're slinging coffee at the speed of all things pre-packaged. You might have to wait in line. You might have to wait for your order. Take a breath and enjoy shopping small."}
{"text":"Wonderful little place.  The bakery items are all made in house and are fantastic!!  Plenty of room to sit and enjoy your coffee and pastry.  I can't wait to try the chocolate!!  So glad a we didn't miss this place!!!!"}
{"text":"We have been here a few times and really enjoy it.  There seems to always be a vegan soup option and they never disappoint.  Today we are enjoying the black bean soup.  Last time we were here we had a tomato vegetable soup that my husband and I still rave about almost a year later. Our kids loved the soup today and are fully enjoying their blueberry lemon cheesecake and mocha cream cake.  Both are delicious!  There are a few reasons  I gave 4 stars instead of 5 - nut cross contamination is a definite here, the service is a bit slow and it's hard to tell what vegan/vegetarian options there are without the waitstaff looking everything up."}
{"text":"I'm a real person, albeit a Sjolind's regular,  so not sure why my first review was filtered but I stand by it - -Sjolind's is my absolute favorite . When anyone visits me in Mt. Horeb for the first time, this shop is a must on our to-do list. Chocolate torte is my absolute favorite along with the sea-salt and dark chocolate caramels (made by hand by the owners). No one makes a vanilla latte like Melissa, and I found out her secret...they make their own syrup! Let's see...the quiche is amazing, scones are yummy and it's fun to see all the different chocolate bars from around the world.  if you are on hwy 18/151, do not miss stopping by this shop. (P.S. It's pronounced SHOE-lindz)"}
{"text":"We were stalking all the trolls in town and stopped here for breakfast. Since we had our dog with us we sat outside at the cafe tables. The wife had a mocha coffee and I had a regular and we both thought they were good. We settled on the raspberry coffee cake for each of us and shared a breakfast quiche. The quiche could have been a little more flavorful but it was ok. Next time we're in town will most likely stop here again."}
{"text":"Excellent service, from scratch pastries, soup, sandwiches, cookies and chocolates. If you have kids they do have a small kids activity table. Wide array of their own chocolates to buy and other brands. The chocolate cake will leave you drooling for more. Will not disappoint."}
{"text":"This is a great lunch spot, coffee place, and chocolate shop! I had a root vegetable soup that was DELISH! And I also had a chicken salad on lettuce--also wonderful!"}
{"text":"The Sjolinds Chocolate House is a misleading name, in my opinion. Sure, they have wonderful chocolates and lots of it (I highly recommend the chocolate covered toffee, btw), but they have so much more. They have quiche, sandwiches, wraps, tarts, danishes, cheesecake, cake, and a million other things. My fiance and I stopped in a few times while we were visiting Mt Horeb. She fell in love with the Winters Mix sandwich and the quiche (had french onion soup, and crab & asiago). My favorite thing was Princess cake, which I can't even describe it other than saying it has green icing, and white and pink stuff in the the middle - I've never had any cake like it, and I loved it. I also really enjoyed the beef pie and the apple cherry tart. Everything we had tasted like it was prepared with care and passion, and had a very 'homey' quality to it.  There are so many options at Sjolinds, and chocolate is just one of them. If you stop in, you're bound to find something delicious. A true gem on the Mt Horeb trollway."}
{"text":"Every small town should have a Sjolinds Chocolate House. This place is adorable, inside and out.   Stopped in for hot chocolate (they have at least a dozen global varieties - the French, with dark chocolate and vanilla bean, was awesome) and ended up with a bag full of goodies.   Make sure to stop in and check out the house-made goodies like chocolate and caramel drizzled popcorn and cinnamon/chocolate caramels as well as all the interestingly flavored chocolate bars (beef jerky chocolate anyone???)"}
{"text":"Amazing tuna melt! Stopped in for coffee and loved the atmosphere. The staff is very friendly and prompt! The credit card machine took a little longer than normal, so that slowed us down just a bit. There were lots of people sitting inside, so it is clearly popular for a reason."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Great coffee, other drinks, cakes, pastries, and location.  Friendly Staff and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"The tea is always nice but I have yet to have food that is not odd in some way. The quiche is pretty good but microwaved so it gets mushy and has hot pockets in it as well as cold. The oatmeal had a decent base until they covered it with so much sugar it became hard to eat. It's a good homework spot and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Best quiche I have ever had. Spinach and Feta is by far my favorite. Their chai lattes are also delicious! The service at both locations are always outstanding and it will continue to bring me back. Love my favorite local spot!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here on a whim mini-road trip to Mt. Horeb. The staff was excellent, very pleasant and helpful. The Columbian hot chocolate was perfect, I love spicy hot chocolate!   We purchased chocolate covered ginger and a liebe kuchen (love cake). They were both delicious and well worth the trip. There is a play area for children, but it was still quiet enough to read. We're definitely going back."}
{"text":"Funnily enough, I never come to Sjolinds in the mood for anything sweet; I want the savory dishes. I grew up in a Swedish-and-proud family so I spent lots of time around limpa, lingonberries and lutefisk, and one of the things I love about Wisconsin is that I can actually find those things without too much difficulty.   Sjolinds is a winner because it's some nice Swedish dishes and they're priced very, very fairly. I'd always stuck to the Swede sandwich until my recent visit, which I certainly don't regret. However, the potato sausage plate is an absolute steal. $7.25 for sausage, potato salad, cabbage, and limpa. I practically had to be carried out of the building.   For those not interested in Swedish food (madness), there's coffee, tea, quiche, cake, cookies, and chocolate. So I imagine the next time I'm in Mt. Horeb and my sweet tooth gets to me, this is where I'm going."}
{"text":"Great food, good prices, nice staff, clean, small feel but plenty of space, and a small kids' corner with toys. We had a lovely lunch!"}
{"text":"Sjolind's has a great selection of chocolates in many variations, along with fresh baked bakery items that are made everyday! The fruit soup is delicious and the German hot chocolate is unique and tasty!"}
{"text":"Super cute chocolate shop and cafe in downtown Mount Horeb. Had one of their handmade ice cream sandwiches, chocolate cookies with chocolate ice cream. A delightful little bite despite a little freezer burn."}
{"text":"Normally, I would give sjolinds 5 stars. The chocolates are great, the quiche is delicious. Today I stopped in for an afternoon cup of coffee and a pastry. The girl working the counter could be described in one word, surly. My husband asked about a particular tart. She looked at him like it was the most annoying thing in the world for her to answer a question. It wasn't even a weird question. Just \" what's that tart like?\". She was rude while she took our order. Rude to her coworker. I watched her while she waited on several other customers as we drank our coffee. Rude. Surly. Rude. One lady asked a question about a type of chocolate. Snippy answer. Lady didn't buy anything. Honestly- it's a chocolate shop. People might ask questions about your product. If you want to sell it, perhaps just answer the question. Nicely......She ruined the whole vibe of the place while we were there. What a shame for such a great place."}
{"text":"I had been intending to go to Sjolind's for months and finally got around to it today... and I'm sorry we waited!  What a great little coffee/candy shop!    The atmosphere is really more coffee shop than candy shop.  They have quite a few options for teas, specialty drinks, several different types of hot chocolate, and juices for the kids.  I had a toasted coconut latte - HUGE cup for $3.15. Hot chocolates were about $2.25 for an 8 oz.    They also have many types of chocolates, both house-made and store-bought.  Really, a great selection.  For food, they have light brunch fair such as quiche, soups, scones, rolls, as well as cookies.  Prices range from 50 cents - $1 for cookies, and $1-2 for baked goods.    Overall, our cookies were awesome, drinks were awesome, prices were reasonable, and service was decent.  They also have a small area for young kids to play.  We will definitely become regulars!"}
{"text":"I'm in love with this place. There's all kinds of amazing-looking cakes in the glass case, and I look forward to trying each and every one.   For lunch, try a Scandinavian meat pie--holy cow. Just... holy cow. Happy tum.  I had the beef/onion/mushroom because they were out of the Finnish pie that day.   I've stopped in a few times now for a cup of the Mexican hot chocolate. It has a dense, flavorful profile that's rich and satisfying. The cinnamon and chocolate are punched up with just a touch of capsaicin (cayenne, I think?). Try it... seriously.  If you need to cheer yourself up, stop in. If you need to get a friend a little gift of prewrapped chocolate cheer, stop in. If you need something sweet, stop in. If you want a hearty, happy lunch, stop in.  Mt Horeb is magic. Come for Sjolinds or Shubert's, stay for Moonlight Mercantile, Duluth, Telsaan, or any of the other fun little shops.  On-street parking is ample in this town, and there are so many choices for food and shopping."}
{"text":"Passed by here on the road after seeing the wonderful reviews. Ordered a coffee and two pies and they completely forgot our order while we thought the food was in prep. After 40 minutes I went to ask about the food and the staff looked completely confused as to what I was asking about. They also didn't seem to care that they forgot about us and we were just sitting there looking around waiting on our food.   Honestly, I'm quite disappointed because everything else about the store/restaurant was lovely.  Edit: after getting the food served, the pies were mediocre. Crust was bready and not very flaky and the filling was decent."}
{"text":"This place is a real treat. Its as if some delightful little elves took over a Starbucks and turned it into something so much better. The Starbucks analogy is only for the self-service set up. Otherwise there is no comparison. The coffee is wonderful, the chocolate superb and the other bakery items like the Quiche and the Finnish pies are great for breakfast or a light lunch. Small cozy dining area in the back. The elves who work there are just the friendliest you could find. Definitely a must stop if you are passing through Mt. Horeb. Just one of many great Main st. delights here."}
{"text":"Great option for coffee, treats and light meals. The savory pastrys are delicious, my kids love the chocolate selection and the staff are all wonderful and quirky. This shop would fit in well on willy street, Mt. Horeb is lucky to have it.   They've also recently expanded their shop and the extra space is really great. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Very delicious quiche and homemade soups! Good coffee too! Desserts look yummy but we didn't have room! Great service and cute, clean little place!"}
{"text":"A cute cafe that serves quality drinks and desserts. Whenever we're in Mt. Horeb we try to stop by Sjolinds.  I love browsing around, taking a look at their different chocolate bars and treats. Afterwards, we'll order a chocolate cake or some truffles and a drink. I love their hot chocolates, and they provide a variety of different kinds based on the flavors of different countries. I tend to stick with the tried-and-true \"regular\" flavors such as the Norweigan's milk chocolate and peppermint or the Icelandic white chocolate (or maybe I'm just secretly a Nordic wannabe). One day I may try a more adventurous flavor, such as West Indies that has ginger and peanut butter. I've also never tried any of their lunch options because we usually wander in here after getting lunch at the Grumpy Troll, but the food does look great. There aren't too many tables in the store, but there are a handful.  Sjolinds adds to the quaint feel of downtown Mt. Horeb. Definitely swing by and enjoy the quiet atmosphere along with a delicious cup of cocoa or a dessert."}
{"text":"During a break in the action from my daughter's soccer tournament, we ventured to Sjolinds Chocolate House in search of a home-style cooking.   While the experience did not blow my hair back, the food was generally well prepared with fresh ingredients.  Even factoring in the imperfections, I would return if travelling through Mount Horeb.  On a brilliantly sunny day, the sunlight struggled to make it into the interior of the store.  If you are looking to catch some rays while you eat, there is a nice elevated patio behind the restaurant.    The cashier, the pastry display case and the tiny kitchen are located in the center of the restaurant.  It gets a little cramped in the ordering area when more than a couple patrons queue up to order.  The lunch menu is small (six sandwiches and three savory Finnish pies).  In addition, several soup, salad and lunch specials change on a daily basis.  The food is prepared by hand with fresh ingredients.  Because the small kitchen size, our food came out two dishes at a time and it took a while for all five members of our group to receive our food.  The food is generally worth the wait.  When discussing the meal, everyone in our group liked their food, but there was always one thing that prevented them from loving the dish.  The roasted tomato soup with bacon was brimming with tomato flavor, but the smokiness of the bacon seemed out of place.  The borscht was chock full of vegetables, but the tomatoes seemed of place with the cabbage and the beets.  While I enjoyed the soup, it lacked the deep earthy flavor that I associate with this dish.  The sausage in my lunch special ($7.25) was superb.  When I saw that it was sliced in half lengthwise, I was worried about it being too dry.  However, that was not the case.  It was moist, well seasoned and packed with flavor.  My only misgiving - it was far too small in relation to the massive serving of potato salad and Limpa.  Please sir, could I have some more...  The red potato salad served with my lunch was lightly dressed and well seasoned with a generous dose of dill.  I also enjoyed the hearty slices of Limpa (Swedish rye bread), peppered with caraway and anise was practically a meal by itself.  Cut into triangular wedges, I imagine Frodo and Sam could sustain themselves on their journey to Mt. Doom with just a slice or two of this bread.   My gooey mozzarella and cheddar in my daughter's grilled cheese sandwich would make the heart of a seasoned Cheesehead melt in delight.  However, the English muffin bread was too dry and in need of a little more butter.  The lefse wrap ordered by my wife and mother-in-law spawned a strong difference of opinion.  My wife thought the lefse served as an effective wrap for the succulent turkey and crisp greens.  My mother-in-law, who probably gone through a metric ton of potatoes making the holiday lefse for her family was less than impressed with the quality of the lefse and was not a fan of her sandwich.  I have enjoyed the scone and cinnamon rolls and they are an excellent value at $2.  I soooo wish I could give Sjolind's a 3.5.  It's clearly better than A-OK, but the rough edges to the meal make me hesitate from entering \"I'm a fan\" territory.  Since I have a soft spot for family-owned and operated businesses and for restaurants that apply some effort when preparing their dishes, I'll round up to four stars."}
{"text":"Very nice coffee shop. My girl friend & I were delighted they serve True Coffee which is roasted in Madison & which I also drink at home. Pleasant eating area, charming & relaxing. As we only had coffee, can't comment on the rest of the offerings."}
{"text":"Great little coffee house and chocolate shop. Excellent baked goods and an incredible chocolate selection. A must stop in Mount Horeb."}
{"text":"A very cute place; lots of prepackaged chocolates from different producers around the world, many of them fair-trade and ecologically minded.  I only saw one chocolate bar actually made by Sjolinds, which was a little disappointing (and expensive).  The desserts and coffee, however, are top-notch; my wife and I had some cake (delicious) and a latte (a little sweet, but well made).  Not too much seating inside, but enough to comfortable hold 8-10 people.  Overall, I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Went when they first opened and the service was bad: people sitting at tables with dirty dishes, waiting for a coffee took 15 minutes and the coffee was mediocre.    I decided to wait to go back and guess what ... still horrible service and bad coffee. Candy and pastries looked good."}
{"text":"Awesome place for breakfast or lunch. Portions are small so you may need two orders but well-prepared and delicious! Got to try their homemade marshmallows on the way out!"}
