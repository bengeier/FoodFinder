{"text":"There food is decent but tonight I tried the spare ribs they were like shoe leather. Extremely tough"}
{"text":"We picked up some take out here and it seemed really clean and the employees were very nice. We tried Mongolian beef, king pao chicken and bbq pork fried rice. All were good but the favorite was the fried rice. Great big portions, awesome prices. The lunch deals are too good to pass up."}
{"text":"The kung pao chicken was great, but we weren't as impressed with the house lo-mein.  The noodles were orange in color and sweet, noodles had a strange texture and it didn't taste like lo-mein at all."}
{"text":"How do they not have 5 stars? Worth every penny.  I usually don't care about / think about service at Chinese restaurants, as they pride themselves on efficiency and quality of food, but they have the best service compared to other dim sum on top of quality, fresh food.  They let me and my friends stay way past closing several times (we didn't notice the time).  I believe they have their own meat counter and butcher, hence the freshness of the meat.  The venue is spacious and quiet, comparatively. I think the owners work there themselves (the older couple that is always there).  

I don't order pastry-type stuff because that's not their specialty and they probably buy it made from somewhere else.  

They have the absolute best tripe and steamed squid in my opinion.  Noone else makes their squid like that, that I know of (very flavourful Thai curry-style and steamed).  

Anyway, if you like savoury and fresh and meaty, and want a quieter Chinese spot, this is the place to go.  They can accommodate large groups, too."}
{"text":"As a Chinese person, I'm fairly disappointed in this restaurant. The dim sum was not up to par, the customer service was pretty bad (probably due to the low number of staff serving in the front), the food was pretty bland, food portions were pretty small given the prices they offered them at, and false advertising in the Chinese newspapers make it a bad restaurant. They also charge a fee for using debit and credit card which means that you'll be spending a bit more than what you calculated for.
Wow factor(s): I am pretty surprised dim sum can taste this bland. 
Saving factor(s): The BBQ noodles were all right and I guess they were good at their price. 
Overall: If you are eating dim sum for the first time, do not go here. This is a bad representation of the actual qualities dim sum has to offer. The food is bland, the service is terrible, and they do not have much to offer."}
{"text":"Right off the bat, this place garnered my respect as one the first restaurants (Chinese or otherwise) I've been to without any noticeable spelling errors on the menu! No need to roll the culinary dice, as I once did with the crap [sic] salad at a sushi bar.

And what a menu it is. At western Chinese restaurants, there are 100+ variations on combining the same dozen everyday ingredients. Here it looks like there is a genuine wide array of traditional dishes available, including several I haven't seen before. I'd have to come several times to form a truly informed opinion.

A group of 7 of us went one late morning, since there is always strength in numbers when partaking in dim sum. We got items running the whole gamut of dim sum options, and overall I was happy with the quality. Not head and shoulders above the usual suspects, but a bit (hence 4 stars). The tripe, which I usually abhor, actually had an acceptable texture, and was heavily gingered in a good way. The only miss was an odd flank cut, consisting mostly of cartilaginous nubs that no one at our table enjoyed. 

Not as many sauces were automatically serve as at other popular downtown spots, but you can ask for them and the service was prompt. No trolleys here, ordering is à la carte. After ordering, a receipt is printed and put on the table. This lets you see how much is left to come, because they strike items off it as they are served. There is some free parking in the back, just try not to get blocked in like we did. I'll probably be back, as the authentic dinner menu definitely warrants exploration."}
{"text":"Consistently good food, always friendly, & occasionally they throw in cake!! I highly recommend for take out."}
{"text":"No wait. The food is incredible, and the service is swift.
Favourite dish was the salt and pepper squid. I don't think I've had better anywhere else in the city!! Truly delicious. Will come again."}
{"text":"It's a small restaurant, but the food is simply amazing. This was the second occasion when my wife and me had lunch here and on both occasions we were happy with the food. The curry chicken is a delight..."}
{"text":"I'm from Vancouver and I'm very new to the city. I'm exploring the culinary scene in Calgary. This is my second dim sum restaurant. It's a nice, clean, comfortable room. The service is very good. The food is very good as well. Well priced too. I will certainly return to dine here again.  :-)"}
{"text":"I ordered steamed ginger chicken bun - the taste was very mediocre and it took them about forty minutes to prepare the food."}
{"text":"We had tried one or two of the previous incarnations of this restaurant and decided to to give the new ownership a try. We were not disappointed. Large, family style portions. Delicious food. The Drunken Chicken is amazing. The owner/waitress was very attentive and offered great service. She made certain that everything was to our liking. This is going to be a more frequent destination for us."}
{"text":"YUM! 
The inside decor needs some serious love and updating, but just like Dragon Island and Big Heng, this is so yummy! Prices are normal, nothing more than around $10. My boyfriend and I got the Mongolian beef and the crispy glazed chicken, an extra side of rice, and each roll (1spring roll and 1egg roll) for $23 not including tip. Everything was wonderful!!! There wasn't one thing we didn't devour. Welcome to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Drove by the other day, and it has a new name and a sign looking for employees. Looks like it's no longer Dragon :("}
{"text":"Ate late lunch here in Calgary Chinatown. Dim sum, congee, and noodles. Food was hot and entrees good. Looks like this place caters to locals."}
{"text":"Charged for Ice tap water and take out containers. Price was about 30% more than other dim sum restaurants in Chinatown.  Food was decent but was no better than others. 
Will not go again due to the nickel and diming for the water and takeout containers"}
{"text":"The service is fast and friendly. Good size portions. Each time i have had their food i have enjoyed everything. Its not the best Chinese food if all time, but its good food for a good price."}
{"text":"Very fast and friendly service.  This is definately a no-frills place and there is nowhere to sit down and eat in the restaurant, BUT it is a great place for take-out!  The woman/cashier I deal with every time I go up there always seem to know instinctively what my order is and she is always very nice and accommodating.  The food portions are LARGE and everything is always very GOOD."}
{"text":"You can count on a Chinese place to be open on Christmas Day! The dim sum for the most part was good and tasty. The shu mai, har gow, nuns were fine."}
{"text":"Service wasn't good and food was ok. 

Garlicky Chili oil was really good 5/5

Scallop dumpling 4/5 it was good but it had only a tiny piece of scallop and the rest was shrimp.

Pork and shrimp dumpling 3/5

Shanghai dumpling 3/5

Crepe shrimp wrap 5/5 taste so fresh and delicious!

Wonton in spicy chili 3/5

Shrimp dumpling 3/5 it was brought out still frozen in the middle but after they took it back and cooked it a bit more it was better tasting."}
{"text":"Somebody got a hankering for DIMSUM!  Well if you want it hot and fresh, come to Dragon Chinese Restaurant in Calgary.  But I will say $100.00 bill for 4 people.  Yes....One hundred dollars!  14 total dishes.  Each dish average 7 dollars.  Expensive.  I am used to California rates and specials for prices usually ranging 3 to 4 bucks.  I will say the waitor knew about hot mustard.  He got me some.  With hot dim sum, it was derishes!  Yes, I said it....DERISHES!  This is what we ordered:  long donut rice roll, rice roll bbq pork and shrimp, fish congee, 2 order hargao (shrimp dumpling steamed), 2 order siomai, marinated chicken feet, pork spareribs in black beans sauce, tripe, steamed egg yolk bun, fried shrimp dumpling.  Now some of the downsides...they charge for water!!!!   Who the f....charges for water.  I'll pay for tea, but water is absolute ridiculousness.  Oh and don't do the take home boxes, they charge you for that too.  Decor was meh, parking sucks, but they were clean.  Also the lady dropped off 2 extra orders of meat balls on the table, we told the manager we never ordered it.  Luckily we had our receipt to back it up.  Oh and try not to be taken advantage of, the receipt is in chinese characters.  Good food, experience so so, price no no."}
{"text":"Very basic dim sum dishes for VERY expensive prices. Not worth it! Ha-gaw has very sticky and thick skin that tore apart when I picked it up!"}
{"text":"5 stars because i couldn't find anything to complain about,  aside from the restaurant not offering some of the common dim sum dishes.  However, the waiter is very friendly."}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere, delicious food, friendly service, and a really fancy bathroom sink to boot!"}
{"text":"If you're going to charge me $6.95 for basic dim sum like ha gao (steamed shrimp dumplings) and siu mai (steamed pork meatballs), don't nickel and dime me by charging $1 for tea per person.  To add insult to injury, they offered me a takeout box to pack my leftovers yet  charged me for the box.  Yeesh.

Food is still decent but I am not pleased at the pesky little charges."}
{"text":"I like this place for dimsum! I love how you order your food, so it comes out burning hot and fresh every time. No food in carts that has been sitting there for ages. Even their donuts for congee is hot and freshly fried! Lots of selection. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"If you like U & Me, you will love Dragon Chinese Restaurant. The food is more expensive than other Chinese restaurants in Chinatown but it is worth it. You can see and taste the difference. The restaurant is upstairs, and I think it's pretty cute place. The decor is not the typical Asian hole in the wall. 

Dragon Fried Rice and the Rice Roll Doughnut are my picks for now. The rice has plenty of crunchy shrimp, tobiko and squid. The doughnut itself was light, warm and crunchy. The rice wrapper around it was silky smooth. 

The restaurant gets busy at lunch. Mix of city workers and seniors. Good staff to customer ratio, so no wait for food/tea refills."}
{"text":"My most recent Dim Sum excursion to Dragon for Dim Sum has it landing at a solid 5-stars from me.

The restaurant is a little bit hard to find and even a little bit harder to get to. It's on the corner of 5th Ave and Centre - just as you're about to take 5th Abe over the flyover, there it is in the NE side, on the second floor, next to a National Car Rental. Not exactly where you'd expect to find some fine, authentic Chinese, right? Well that's just the beauty of it.

1st time - Chinese New Years with Terrence L. and friends. A bunch of delicious different courses including lobster that I absolutely loved. What did I eat? Who knows?! I didn't ask and I didn't care. All off it was exceptionally tasty for the amount we paid. Can't remember the exact figure, but I can't remember paying that little for this extensive of a meal, ever.

The 2nd time I visited was for an Unofficial Yelp Event, arranged by none other than Ange T. Our group went to town on this Dim Sum, eating every steamed bun this and that we could get out hands on. Total pice - $29 per person including tax and tip. For an all-out, no holds barred Dim Sum extravaganza this struck me as pretty good.

They do dim sum via a sushi style check menu instead of a cart. You don't get to see what you order before hand but it comes out piping hot and extremely fresh tasting. I'll take the mystery with the freshness any day.

Notable items - the rice of all things: plenty of seafood mixed in. A surprising amount."}
{"text":"I fully agree with the first poster.  When you have a bunch of retired old ladies and men who show up after 2:00 p.m. and go for the deals, that's the place to go for cheap food.  

Deals like BBQ duck on rice noodles (the round and slippery ones like spaghetti) for $3.50 a bowl.  Dim sum for 20% discount.  Good Eat like they say.  

They have pricier menu for dinner with all the exotic menu for eye popping prices....that's with abalone and geoducks and the likes.  I plan to try them.

Restaurant is small, but very comfortable for a newly renovated eatery.  Let's hope they keep up the maintenance.

It  sits across from the Bow tower, very convenience on Sundays with free parking on street."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been in Chinatown for more than a year now but we have not been there since we do not eat in Chinatown all that often.  We have heard good things about it from different people and thought we would finally try it out for ourselves today for lunch.  The owner and all the staff were helpful throughout our stay, which is something that you don't get at Forbidden City or T.Pot or most other Chinese restaurants.  The good service was definitely appreciated and noticeable.

The dim sum that we ordered came out promptly without a long wait.  Overall, the quality was good but there were a couple of items that other restaurants do better.  The prices on the dim sum items are on the high side, which is fine if the quality was on par.  While this is true on most items, there were others that are not worth the extra price and could be improved on.  We have heard good things about their dinner menu, so maybe we will one day try it out for ourselves."}
{"text":"This chinese joint is excellent, I must say! They are quick, friendly, and the food is delicious! I recommend this to every person who loves chinese food! Take out only i believe... Try the broccoli&beef!"}
{"text":"Great Chinese food! Can't sit down to eat, but the food is definitely good and you can enjoy it at home...or in my case, at the hotel"}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed the Dragon restaurant. The lady up front is very friendly and attentive and the food is delicious. Shrimp with Garlic sauce is my favorite."}
{"text":"Decided to switch up my usual location. Never had it before with past owners but food was fresh and flavours were amazing. A little pricy but worth the extra penny."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. Nice place for take out they do not have no dine in restaurant area but good prices and decent quality food. The girl who runs the register is super nice and friendly she always knows what I want too :)"}
{"text":"Awesome quick food. Lady who answers phone and runs it is super sweet and great. 
Food and sauces are good!! 
Chicken / meat isn't the best quality but over all a good value!!!!!"}
{"text":"The girl was very nice and friendly on the phone and when I picked up the food, but I was very disappointed in the taste of the food. We ordered orange chicken and general tso's both with fried rice. The fried rice had no taste and no vegetables or anything else with it. The chicken tasted terrible also. I was really disappointed because the price was cheap, however we will not be ordering food from here again."}
{"text":"Very low key atmosphere. All you can eat hot pot from September onwards into the winter. Service was very good ."}
{"text":"They only said two words to me during my entire dinner: \"thank you\".  And they said them 10 times. Only thing better than the service was the food. Dim sum pan fried pork buns were amazing yet marginally topped by the shredded pork on crispy noodles."}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure what to say or where to start for this restaurant, and usually I have a lot to say. I think the overarching theme for this review is that it's very ordinary. 


You can find Dragon Chinese Restaurant on the second floor of an unassuming, old building nestled at the foot of the Telus building. The entrance is up a flight of somewhat dingy stairs, but it's Chinese food, so this is kind of on par with what to expect. The restaurant itself has decent décor - the usual Chinese styling of red with gold letters, etc. They have pop music playing in the background and ESPN on the TVs.... which is a little eclectic. However, It's very clean, open, and comfortable feeling - and the service is much better than most Chinese restaurants. 

As always, they have a regular bilingual menu as well as some seasonal stuff - some printed Chinese-only pages in some page protectors that they'll hand you. As usual, the \"seasonal/specials\" menu that is only in Chinese is pretty much where you wanna order off of if you want something authentic, although this restaurant also does you the favour of labeling which items are western and which are authentic on the regular menu as well. With the exception of the 8$ \"small plates\" (which are actually full sized dishes), I found the items to be over-priced compared to what I'm used to. The food itself was pretty much the usual fare as far as taste and quality goes - edible but unremarkable. The items I ordered off the small plates menu were pretty good - I suggest those over the regular menu. 

I find that it's a little off the beaten path, and was very empty on the stat holiday evening that I visited. It's not a bad place to eat, but I wouldn't say this would pop into my head as THE place to be if you feel like eating Chinese. I hear the dim sum is pretty good, though!"}
{"text":"An authentic Chinese dimsum place that's still doable for foreigners! The decorations are nice and the menus is in English so you will find your way around it even without a Chinese speaking companion!
It's not pricey and the staff are very friendly."}
{"text":"Yelp rarely steers me wrong, but this time it happened. I ordered take-out and was so disappointed. The hot and sour soup was neither hot nor sour. The crab puffs were some of the worst I have had, weak and soggy with no crab. The mu shu chicken lacked flavor and I honestly think they used tortillas instead of crepes (I couldn't taste any sesame oil). 

The pricing was a bit high and the place was a dump. I'll stick to China Chili in the future."}
{"text":"This is the new name for the old Big Heng restaurant. From what I hear, the new owners are from New York and have a long history in the business. It shows. I loved Big Heng and I love Dragon Chinese even MORE! Food is always fresh and portion size is good. The menu is much larger and has added new items like lamb and prawns. A markedly Hunan influence is evident, but spiciness was spot on with each dish we ordered. I am a wimp and get one star but my wife and son are full on wackadoodle and get the full monty 5 star level every time. Cudos guys and welcome to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"so-so Chinese restaurant.  I was hoping for real dim sum but they don't have the carts here.  You basically just order off their menu flip which is fine, but picking stuff off the carts is what I expect when I go for dim sum.  Food tasted fine though...was not disappointed there.  Not a whole lot of parking and the restaurant is actually located on the top floor so you have to navigate a narrow staircase which is no fun if you've got bad knees.  A-O-K in my book, will have to try it again for dinner family style for a better assessment."}
{"text":"This place is just slightly out of Chinatown so it would be easy to overlook it. It's on the second floor of a rental car place so I drove by it because I didn't trust that the Google lady knew what she was talking about. (Yeah right. Google knows everything.)

Anyways, I was here to celebrate Chinese New Year with a 10 course meal with friends. 

The light when you go up the stairs does this cool thing that could induce seizures, but maybe that's just their way of screening out people who can't handle the deliciousness that's about to happen. 

On to the food. 10 courses. Obviously I came prepared and wore my stretchy pants. You would be wise to do the same, even if you plan on less gluttony. 

My friend had pre-ordered as we had a large group and family style works so well when you want to try a lot of things. We had lobster, chicken, duck, fish, pork, veggies, rice, soup, shrimp, more chicken, more duck, and a whole lot of other stuff that I can't remember. Everything was insanely delicious. 

The service was a bit hectic, but I really can't fault them for that as we were a large party and there was a lot going on. 

The best part was that the entire meal, with tax and tip was only $40. I don't know about you, but I love ringing in the New Year, any New Year, with awesome people and incredible value. 

Bottom line - An inconspicuous location just means you won't have to fight others in order to enjoy a great meal. Go with a bunch of friends so you can try lots of dishes."}
{"text":"Finally, a Chinese dim sum restaurant that gets it.  Give good service and you'll get a good tip.  This is the first dim sum restaurant where we were never once neglected.  The restaurant isn't huge but it's a good size and is tucked out of the way to keep it semi-busy.

We were initially expecting 15 for Sunday dim sum brunch but then it changed to 13.  They were happy to accommodate us into one large table.  It was a tight squeeze but we managed and they were happy to oblige.

The food was quite tasty and fresh.   There were no carts being rolled around (not many places do anymore) but that was OK because the menu was well laid out and there were even pictures for the newbies in the group.

It was also the first Chinese restaurant that when I called to make reservations they didn't screw up what I had just said; or worse, pretend they understood and then wrote down the wrong request.

The great food, good service and friendly staff made for a good experience. I'm definately going to go back."}
{"text":"Dim sum is quite good, but the prices are a little on the high side compared to other options in China Town. The decor is nice and the service is average. I would come back if I felt like a snack, but not if I am starving. Even still, I'll have to come back to try some more of the dim sum."}
{"text":"Really good dim sum!  About time there was another authentic Chinese restaurant in Calgary.  Dragon Chinese Restaurant is having a grand opening special of 20% discount.  They have the dim sum check off list in English and Chinese.  Lots of choices both regular dim sum fare but also interesting unusual dim sum items like pork liver rice crepes, wontons in spicy sauce, BBQ pork pastries but with ginger.  The usual dim sum fare was pretty fresh.  I liked their shrimp dumplings - no fishy smell, taste was great.  All their items were served piping hot and that's what I like!  

The decor is neat.  As you ascend the stairs to the restaurant up one level, you follow a gold and glittering trail.  The restaurant is adorned in red and gold.  Dragon heads are everywhere!  

The wait staff was really polite and professional.  They can speak in English and Chinese.   I'm impressed at how many times they came to check our tea pot to fill up with hot water or take away dirty dishes.  Chilli sauce and chilli oil were brought promptly to the table when asked.  We ordered congee and they made sure to bring bowls with Chinese spoons and white pepper!  Usually, I have to ask.  

The owner was so impressed with our BIG order that he told the waitress to bring us dessert - goji berry with lychee jelly.  Delish!  

Parking is on-street or there is a parking lot to the west of the restaurant.  

No elevators at this building."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good place to go if you are in the mood for fresh and local Chinese food.  We have gotten take out from there many times and the portions are large but delicious.   The veggie are fresh which is a pleasant surprise."}
