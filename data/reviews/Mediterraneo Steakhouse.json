{"text":"Amazing food. Great ambience; kosher as well.  Try the poutine, the mashed potatoes, and the carpaccio.   Came here with two buddies; we all loved it."}
{"text":"Kim is the best waitress I have ever witnesse. She is truly a phenomenal host. Food was amazing and ambiance was truly one of a kind..... Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Well, a real pleasure! An attractive, comfortable restaurant that oh, by the way, happens to be kosher. The missus and I were visiting Montreal; looking for a kosher spot for dinner. I'd heard of this new place through Dani K's YeahThatsKosher blog.    The tag line says steak and Italian,  but the menu is quite complete.  We started with the Tuna Bombs and the Gnocchi Poutine. Tuna bombs were too spicy for the missus but just to my taste. A spreadable, tuna tartar with a nice kick.    The Gnocchi Poutine,  as documented elsewhere,  is to die for. Little pillows of potato covered in lamb and gravy. A guilty pleasure not to be missed.   We then moved on to the Mixed Grill Platter for two. A spectacular array of grilled meats, cooked to order, served on a thick wooden cutting board. A plate of grilled vegetables, a bowl of well seasoned mushrooms and onions and rather good French fries completed the entree.    We enjoyed a very good 2013 Barkan Cabernet from a short but adequate wine list. Waitress, Kim, was quick, knowledgeable and attentive. Host Amir was warm, friendly, gracious and accommodating.  All in all a terrific dinner that will likely be the capstone of our Montreal vacation."}
{"text":"There is no better kosher restaurant in Montreal for meat. The service is phenomenal and the food is even better. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Food was great- we were visiting Montreal and based on other reviews, decided to check this place out- it did not disappoint. All the food was really good, service was great and it was a really nice ambience. It seems kinda expensive but we stuck to burgers and appetizers and the strength of the US dollar helped keep the price reasonable."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of coming here the first time last night. The restaurant has been tastefully renovated with a cozy feel (it was formally an Italian restaurant before.)   This is a high end Kosher establishment which specializes in steaks and Italian cuisine. The service is top-notch and the owner was warm and welcoming (even with my rambunctious four-year old). They don't mind children and completely outfitted for parties as well.  We enjoyed drinks, tuna bombs, handmade gnocchi poutine (to-die-for), pasta and steak. Wow, everything was made beautifully and tasted amazing. I would compare it to Moishes (but for a Kosher crowd). I find that the food here is amazing and I would come back for more.  I would try out the gnocchi poutine (and next time, I'm trying out their steak for two!)."}
{"text":"Food was great. Service was great. You feel like your in the owners personal dining room. Decor was nice. Pargiot chicken was amazingly juicy. The cocktails curated by Kathy were great. And she really knows her menus very well. Plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Disappointing and really overpriced.  We dropped in for a light dinner and were glad not to be ordering a full meal, although the service was quick and pleasant. The $22 large \"Greek Salad\" was made of underripe tomatoes, sliced olives from a can, peppers, cucumber, onion and tofu. TOFU?! Not the essential chunks of Feta Cheese?  Yep. Nothing told us this place was kosher, until we complained about the salad and were told that no dairy could be on the menu. Great. We didn't bother to complain about canned olives -- in a place that bills itself as Greek. We just finished up fast and departed. A note on prices here: hamburgers start at $24 for a plain one and go up from there. Steaks go from about $45 to $115. They'd all need to be wonderful, because the ambiance is nothing special."}
{"text":"Was so very excited to try this restaurant. We started off with the table bread, which was so-so. The olive butter parve was very good, but the bread was just OK.   The appetizers stole the show. The lamb poutine was really outstanding.  Wonderful gravy, tasty lamb, & perfect french fries.  The chicken wings were excellent, fried with a spicy buffalo wing sauce.   I ordered the Montreal burger. There was a very skinny piece of smoked meat on the burger. The burger was just so-so. Was not as juicy as I expected, and needed condiments. The chicken burger was a little better, while the child spaghetti and meatballs was pretty good. The side salad was excellent, beautiful presentation was very fresh vegetables. Really enjoyed it.  Next time, I will try the steak, or one of the chicken dishes. But the burger was not a great burger. Still worth coming, although it is not a cheap meal.  Service was very good, and the owner is quite nice as we spoke to her for a while. Unfortunately they do calculate the tip after-tax versus pretax."}
{"text":"Delicious food from grilled fish, burgers and steaks. And service was amazing from Kathy Kim and Amelie. Highly recommended."}
