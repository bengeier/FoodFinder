{"text":"Very warm and welcoming host that serves selective but amazing Korean food. Interior is well organized and sort of unique in our little town."}
{"text":"Food: it's just meat with large amount of bought sauce.  Some lettuce that's all.   Really no effort at all.   And that's no way Korean/Asian taste 

Portion: small and only lettuce comes with my order.  They don't even bother putting more veggies 

Price: NOT WORTH IT.  $12 for 6 pieces of tiny fried chicken.  And the fried chicken has little meat in it

Not recommended."}
{"text":"Hands down the best restaurant in the village. Many different options, excellent prices, prepared fresh. We had the bibimbop and bulgogi plate, they weren't 9 and $12 respectively. Absolutely delicious. Friendly staff and inviting atmosphere. Fast service. Can't wait to go back and try other things."}
{"text":"Great Korean restaurant in Ste-Annes. It's hard to find any Korean places outside of Montréal and this one is delicious by Montréal standards. We had dumplings as appetizers and beef bibimbap as mains. The dumplings were fresh with a lemony taste that really made them good. The bibimbap beef was marinated nicely and tender, with perfectly cooked rice and veggies were crisp. Personally, I don't really like bell peppers in bibimbap but that is just my own taste. The Korean lady who was working there was helpful, nice and a quick cook. The atmosphere is very casual with a cute café feel. I really want to try other dishes here since it's an authentic Korean resto close to home. I encourage people in the area to populate the tables at Boaboa more because it is a real diamond in the rough when considering the inexpensive menu and quality, authentic Korean food offered here."}
{"text":"Really excited to have this place in the village. The food was delicious and really affordable. The atmosphere is really charming and staff are so nice! The only thing I would have changed would be to have more sauces than soy sauce for my dumplings and spring rolls. But even without the sauce, it was so delicious. I highly recommend it!"}
