{"text":"Tried the Rib eye last nite at Azools. It turned out great. I usually always go with the sliders as theses are hard to beat."}
{"text":"I go to Azool pretty regularly. The service is always good and they have something for everyone. I definitely do not recommend it as a \"family friendly\" venue, as its more of a sports bar. But they have pool, darts, trivia, off track betting, a large viewing screen and cornhole. Ask about the specials because they tend to be varied and different than the menu items."}
{"text":"The WORST service EVER!!  I have been going there for awhile and every time the service sucks!!!  We always sit on the patio and the server will walk out and and never come by our table.  They make  us the wrong drinks and still charge us!!  We had to flag the server down every time to get a drink.  Def, gonna start going somewhere else.  They don NOT appreciate our business I guess!!!"}
{"text":"What a great place that I can't believe we have driven past a hundred times and never visited. Great food ( I had the meatloaf ) and one of the best waitresses I've had the pleasure to meet. We were there 10/14 in the evening and really enjoyed ourselves. Menu is simple but has something for everyone. Indoor/ outdoor dining. Fun place."}
{"text":"Nothing bad about this place. They do have pretty good food and a selection other than the typical greasy bar-food as well. Beer selection is adequate and staff is pleasant. It's a place that I stop by for lunch on occasion. It's better than the alternative next door.... Denny's."}
{"text":"Personally, this place is not that good, but I was still willing to go back there until recent events.  Their food is overpriced and the drinks really aren't that good. Mary the owner shouldn't have such a thin skin sometimes.  Yes I admit I was unruly last time, but the bald headed dude who's Mary's boyfriend just decided he wanted to kick me out today for no freaking reason. Therefore, you guys have just cost yourself hundreds if not thousands of dollars but that's okay.  My apologies for last time, but your attitude towards me today was truly unacceptable.  I would have been willing to talk about it with you, but you can take my picture off your wall now.  Azool=Looza."}
{"text":"Our new favorite place to watch the CARDINALS games, great food at good prices and our server Brandon took really good care of us and was so friendly, thanks for making my birthday night a success."}
{"text":"Good food. Would have been better if the smokers on the patio closed the door. Good bar fight."}
{"text":"Love the live band Mob vs. Ballot Box - great drummer and gutarists.  Food food and friendly atmosphere.  Outside patio is nice too."}
{"text":"My husband and went here for dinner the other night.  Since there aren't many other choices in the area, and we like to eat at local, family owned restaurants- we thought we'd give it a try.  Honestly, with the prices on the menu, we were expecting a somewhat upscale version of bar food.  What we got however, was mediocre to say the least.  I honestly would have rather eaten at Jack In the Box down the road.  At least then, I wouldn't have been pissed off paying $40 for a pile of crap.  The waitress was exceptionally slow and literally didn't come back to our table for at least 40 minutes.  We almost left without paying.  We will never go back there.  I have never written a review on ANYTHING before now, but for some reason the whole experience irritated me that much..."}
{"text":"First visit Saturday 8/17/2013 - VERY LAST VISIT - recommendation to everyone reading YELP AZOOL GRILL Rating - DON'T go here even one time for your own health and safety.  Ready for a turn your stomach review?  For our own health safety we are never going back and turned in a complaint to Maricopa County food inspector http://www.maricopa.gov/EnvSvc/Complaints/Forms/ComplaintForm.aspx

We told the waitress it was our first time at Azool Grill and asked the waitress for recommendation - she recommended fish and chips.  I double checked with her and I ask if it was from frozen or fresh - she said \"Fresh\". 
At her excited recommendation ordered fish and chips.  NOT sure what it was but not cod, not sure what the batter was but for sure it was tasteless.  
Now for the health scare - after the third bite there was a oozing moisture leaking out on the \"steak fries\" I decided to open the fish, cold, cold, cold and frozen - like the kind of frozen that the fork could not penetrate.  

We feared for our health safety.  Only three fries were not soaked with wet defrosting fish moisture.  Cole slaw - could not even keep first taste down, spoiled, slimy and old.  Draft Guinness Beer - warm and no head, glass dirty.   

We told the waitress the fish was still frozen she said, \"oh my bad luck other customers have also complained of frozen fish!\"  Liar, Liar, waitress! Listen up Mr. Azool owner, your staff are aware of the frozen food and still recommending this to customers, I wonder if they are doing you in, but then again, you are doing yourself in if you are not checking reviews or tasting the food.  Waitress and cook at Azool Grill you are cost your owner well spending customers.  

As we walked out of this place we took notice there were very few people in the place and NO ONE had food!  Darn should have noticed that on the way in but it was so nasty dark that we were watching our steps instead of taking note of the theme that no one was eating food.  Frozen soggy, not sure it was cod, soggy fries, can't trust recommendation from staff.  Waitress didn't take food off the bill or let the manager know - done, done, done not wasting money or winding up in the hospital from the food being extremely under cooked."}
{"text":"A place of gluttony and waste especially if you get involved with the locals."}
{"text":"Cool bar just outside of town ....Just on border of Phoenix/Anthem ....great service, friendly servers always around ....off track betting in the back of the place.  Outside patio has lots of room.... Cool place well worth checking out !!"}
{"text":"Food middle of the road... The staff is rude.. Seems like it starts with the owner. I think she makes the staff pay for everything that goes wrong so in turn they dont want to fix issues with poor, wrong food etc.  I think she tends to forget the customers are actually what keeps a business open. For a long time it was the only choice in the area. Now there are multiple choices.  If your in the area Chili's or Connolys is much better choice in my oppinion."}
{"text":"It's a hit and miss place. I've had good burgers and tuna sandwich, and the next month the food was well below average. The worst part about the place and it's been consistent is they are always understaffed! Ownership is trying to save money by not staffing property, hence I'm sure he has a low labor overhead, he's also losing customers because every time I go I wait over 5 min. just to get water and 10 min. for anyone to take my order. I typically go now during football season for lunch to watch a game... and the pub is not that busy (crazy) and it's a frustrating because it's an hour to get in and out for a simple burger. I'll try again when ownership starts taking responsibility for their service and product and cares more about the quality of the service and food, customers like myself work to hard for our money to get sub-level service when we are dining out."}
{"text":"Great place for a last minute lunch stop, menu was a little small but had the ribs and very tasty."}
{"text":"My family had a decent dinner - I had a bug in mine.  The waitress was less than sympathetic when I mentioned the extra protein in my food.  I finally told her forget it, so they kindly credited back my portion of the meal and I left hungry.  I gave it two stars because apparently my husband and son's dinner was edible - I wouldn't know as I left hungry."}
{"text":"Went here when I visited some friends who moved to AZ. Really not much of a choice for places to go at night in the area. The food was actually surprisingly good. I got the ribs and they were amazing. The highlight of the night was when the place turned into a karaoke bar. Nothing like getting a little tipsy and belting out Aerosmith - I Dont Wanna Miss a Thing. Fun night (what I remember of it anyways...)"}
{"text":"The food here was horrible. The waitress told us they were well known for their pulled pork. It was horrid. If I ever go back it will only be for a beer. I will say that the service was otherwise excellent which is why they actually get one star."}
{"text":"The food is OK, but over priced, crowd is 20's to 40's and semi-biker-ish, the service is all right, but the staff seams shady. 

I am not sure what is going on with the people who work there but we have a friend that lives nearby and I have (reluctantly) been to Azools several times. 

Once the bartender picked up my money then claimed he hadn't, asking me for more money, a few minutes later saying he had forgotten he had already picked it up. Another time the owner followed us out to the parking lot claiming we had not paid, then walked away before my friend could even respond. Going back in to clear things up the owner pretended like she had no idea what we were talking about. Another time we had placed an order, in a very short time something completely different was placed in front of us and the waitress very quickly exclaimed \"Whats wrong? THIS is what you ordered!\". Her response was very immediate and sounded rehearsed. I think it might have been a miss-order from one of her other tables she was trying to guilt us into paying for. We only go there because there are little other options in the area. 

Some times the service is average but we have are so many such incidents it makes me think there is something shady going on. My friend has said other local merchants have other such odd stories about the owner and restaurant. Normally I don't eat at chain restaurants but when I visit I prefer the Chilles next door by default."}
{"text":"I wish I could comment on the quality of food, but the first 10 minutes were so horrible I couldn't even stay long enough to eat. 

Walked in with a group of five, including two children under 10, and immediately was overwhelmed by how absolutely loud it was inside. There were multiple TVs blaring and no one to greet us, but rather a bartender who screamed from over the bar to pick a seat. We chose patio seating outside in hopes of actually being able to hear each other speak.

We get outside and our waiter takes our drink orders. Before we could even order for the kids, he said that they couldn't have their juice drinks on the patio. Weird, but okay, fine. We asked if we could set them down by our bags and the waiter, without any remorse, said no-- we had to throw them away or put them in the car. Already off to a bad start and we didn't really care to stay for more, so we gladly left. 

Sure, if I were to bring in a Starbucks coffee and sit down at the restaurant, I would understand, but these were KIDS with gatorades. Typically, the argument against bringing outside beverages in to a restaurant is that the restaurant wants you to purchase a beverage from them, but we weren't even given a chance to order drinks for them (which we had planned on) because of how abrupt the waiter was. And then not to even let us set them aside? Ridiculous. 

Rules are rules, but be courteous and friendly while delivering them, and maybe make sure everyone has ordered before you start barking them out."}
{"text":"A great place to go for lunch, dinner or drinks. I highly recommend the steak bruschetta. It is amazing! The servers are friendly and the service is consistently good."}
{"text":"Azool Grill is a great place to go for Off Track Betting! the atmosphere is great and lively, and the food isn't bad either. I get the chicken ceasar wrap every time and it is delicious. Definitely a go to place"}
{"text":"Went here several times with my boyfriend...slowest service EVER! Food was terrible. Owner is nasty! If you're not one of the regulars they couldn't care less. Don't waste your time!!!"}
{"text":"What an awesome neighborhood bar. I brought my little brother here when he was in town and the service was spectacular. For entertainment they have pool, darts, games and music. Our waitress Chris was more than attentive. I will defiantly be coming back!"}
{"text":"Sorry I really don't like the service at all! I have been there several times and every single bartender is so rude. Especially the owner? Food is good but too expensive. Hoping for another bar to open up."}
{"text":"Run for Hills - any hills that are close. We ran to In and Out after 11 miserable minutes sitting in a corner booth.

1. We immediately started sweating when we sat down. Turning off the AC when the temperature is still over 80 is unacceptable.
2. They have no concept of a lunch special. After asking about lunch specials, the not so smart female bartender replied with an answer that made no sense saying something like oh we are just starting that and I think its gonna be Wednesday or Friday. I guarantee that whatever day a person is there to eat the lunch special will be in a few days. What a joke.
3. Regular food menu is way overpriced for this neck of the woods. There is nothing under 11 bucks and I wasn't going to take a chance on a frozen burger patty when IN and Out serves them up fresh for 2 bucks. 
   
    Bring your own food and fan and maybe I would watch a football game there if it was the last bar left on earth."}
{"text":"Quite frankly the best time I've had in a really long time. Thank you so much. Everyone should go here! #theoregonians #djdave"}
{"text":"Good booze, good prices, good clean fun!"}
{"text":"Azool Grill is a must on places to check out!! All of my group had incredible food(their AZ Cheese Steak blew me away) and they even had live music. The drink and food prices are very reasonable and the atmosphere was made beyond perfect with the entertainment playing a great mix of rock and country at a volume we could all enjoy and still converse easily over. It is a hidden treasure in more ways than you'll expect!!"}
{"text":"Bar is great, food is good but nothing special. The service is lacking at best. Sat at the bar up front and was not acknowledged for 15 min. After ordering a beer, it came out warm. The bartender was good about helping with food selection after waiting another 15 minutes to get a menu and another 10 min to order. After finishing, it took 10 min to get the bartender attention to get my tab. Definitely will not recommend and will not be back. Not sure how this place stays In business what so ever!"}
{"text":"First time at Azool. Brandon did a fantastic job! He was personable and professional!  Menu had great options and tasted great!! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The shrimp cocktail is the bomb. Sweet potato fries aren't bad either. Hubby enjoyed the wings. What makes this place stand out the last two visits is the live music. I was really impressed with a band they had from Flagstaff though I am not sure who they were. It's pretty ok for a local bar."}
{"text":"My roommates and I went to Azool Grill for Name That Tune w/ DJ Dave last night. It was the most fun we've had out in Phoenix since we've lived here - and we've been here for a few years! The trivia host was so good at getting everyone involved, the bartenders were awesome, and the crowd was super friendly. Look on their website calendar to find out when they are doing this event again and go! Looks like DJ Dave is there a few times a month. Thanks for the great time! We'll be back! #theoregonians"}
{"text":"Here is the exact text I just sent my roommate: Also btw azool bar on carefree is new place. Horse betting. Great food. Amazing bloody Mary's. Open at 10 and have 4 breakfast items. Two bars and pool tables. It's the sheeee..."}
{"text":"Came in for a beer on the way home after a long day. Just wanted one beer. Went to pay with my debit card like any of the thousands of transactions I complete every year... only to be told \"$10 minimum for a card\". Had to have a second beer so I could pay my tab.  I won't be back out of principle. Too many other options to choose. Welcome to 2016, Azools."}
{"text":"Came here passing through on thsnksgiving and was so
Pleasantly surprised! Erin was a great waitress, welcoming and helpful.  No attitude when I asked to taste the dressing for the Caesar salad prior to ordering! The salad was delicious , I hAd grilled Shrimp with it.  Hubby got mixed plate if hamburger sliders and sausage sliders and French fries that were thick and crisp.  Given that we were prepared for Denny's which was closed, we felt we had a bonanza!

Only negative us one cited by previous reviewer.  The tv volume was ridiculous.  My ears are still experiencing some pain answer left ten minutes ago!"}
{"text":"great neighborhood with more than decent bar food, cold drinks on a nice patio, and casual friendly people!"}
{"text":"I've been a long time customer of Azool. They have the best steaks/large meals on CareFree Highway. The drinks are cold and they have a nice selection. 

I always sit at the bar, it's where the action is. If your expecting a nice mellow place to eat then get there earlier in the day. 

It is a bar first and a grill second."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place! We recently made it our local staple. The staff is very personable, attentive, friendly and upbeat.  The food is super consistent. No matter what we order it comes out tasting fresh and yummy! The chef is clearly thoughtful about temperature and presentation regardless of its a hot or cold meal. Spot on every time! The vibe is energetic and fun! Our cocktail is never empty! They don't miss a beat here!! The attention to detail is refreshing. They set the bar!!"}
{"text":"Yuck. I wanted to leave after we got our water but my husband didn't want to leave. This place needs bar rescue.  Food is over priced for what you get. I got the sliders for 10 bucks and nasty is the best word to describe.  Burnt cheap patty with a slice of cheese.  Nothing else.... I wish I would have went to in and out burger instead.it looks like a good place to get trashed and not give 2 shits about the world."}
{"text":"Food has always been good here. Had the prime rib Saturday special and a good value, well prepared w mashed potatoes and green beans. Service is fine but not what it once was. Live music. Kodos for that in a big way."}
{"text":"I've been to this place half a dozen times.  From the turkey Rubina sandwich, to the B.L A.T., to the pulled BBQ pork Sanny, everything is good!  There specials are always great too!  Great service, fun casual atmosphere. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Good local bar within walking distance to our house. Drinks are well made. We have only eaten minimal menu items but they have all been good. Happy hour is okay the specials are just okay."}
{"text":"Azool Grill has great food and a great bar for after dinner drinks if you want to stick around!

I've had at least 10 things from the menu and have never been disappointed with anything.  From fish and fries to the one of the best pulled pork sandwiches I've ever ordered, the food never seems to amaze me.  Sandwiches, pastas, salads... it's all absolutely great!!!  Meals range from $10-$15 each..

The bar has several beers on tap along with a larger line of hard alcohol.  Prepare to spend about $5/beer when though.  There is no such thing as happy hour either, so these prices are the same all of the time.

The staff and owners are what keep this place running.  There is a consistant stream of regulars that come through the doors and the staff makes each one of them feel at home.  You're always greated by somebody when you walk in the door and seat yourself and that type of attention keeps customers coming back for more.

The venue has two sides to it... both that have bars and dining areas available.  Big screen televisions and a projector television in the rear room show as many sporting events as possible while even broadcasting the occassional UFC fight.  A jukebox, pool table, Golden Tee arcade game, and electronic darts make sure that there is plenty to do while you are drinking and relaxing with company.  The patio is usually filled with those that choose to smoke, but if you can catch it empty at sunset, it's nice to sit and just watch the traffic go through the parking lot with a cold drink in your hand.

** Side Note ** --- the side room of the restaurant is available for private functions as well so you can have your own party there.  My wife and I did this for an event and we couldn't have been happier with the food selections and preperation and staff availability/friendliness.  Very reasonably priced too for your own private bar with full staff and your very own restroom!!!!

Enjoy!!!!"}
{"text":"The wife and I went there just to check it out and have dinner and was pleasantly surprised, she had the French dip and I had the meatloaf and both were very good. The waitress was on top of her game and did a great job, we will be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"Service is hit or miss here, food is the same but the patio is a nice place to hang and the drinks are decent."}
{"text":"It's-not good.  Food tastes like basic bar food and the place is just a little off on the feel of a sports bar.  Staff is friendly and I would love to like this place as I live close by-but it needs a major renovation."}
{"text":"Easily, one of the best sports bars in the area. Great service and the food is way better than most places in the area. Nice patio area, you can watch and play horses if you like too. Well lit and clean. However, the music is so loud that a lunch meeting is impossible to do here, their day business is very low as a result. The restaurants in the same area are much quieter for lunch and breakfast."}
{"text":"Went there last Sat for dinner. My mom had their Prime rib special and I had their ribeye. We were both extremely unimpressed. We both ordered a salad with our dinners. I have never been to any restaurant that brings the salad on the same plate as a steak or prime rib. So it goes without saying that our salads were drench in steak juice. Also moms prime rib was ordered medium rare and was brought out Rare and bloody (all over her salad too). Our waitress was not attentive and kept hanging at the bar jamming out to the music instead of checking our drinks or to see if we needed anything else. We did send the prime rib back for the extra cook time but it definitely was not worth it.  I think this place might ok to hang out and have drinks but I don't think it's really worth the drinks either due to the overall poor experience we had."}
{"text":"So I came in for a quick beer before heading home. After my beer I decided I wanted a grey goose dirty martini with bleu cheese stuffed olives. I should know better right?  

I asked the bartender if there was any chance they had bleu cheese stuffed olives because I really wanted a martini with them.  She said no. The frown on my face must have put her into service mode because she said, \"we have blue cheese crumbles.\". I tiled my head to the side and raised my eyebrows and then...she said \"I guess I could stuff some for you.\". I smiled and off she went to the kitchen after grabbing 3 large olives from the bar. 

Service is everything. Especially when places are willing to go above and beyond for an \"off the menu\" item. 

Bravo Azööls, Bravo."}
{"text":"Azool Grill is quickly becoming one of our go to places, since there aren't many places to go near Carefree Hwy and I-17.  There is never a problem getting a booth no matter when we go.  The place is situated with the bar in the middle and booths/tables surrounding with quite a few TVs to watch various sporting events.  They also have a back room with dart boards/etc and a patio outside.  We haven't been on the patio due to many folks that smoke there.  They have 4 beers on tap (Fat Tire, Guinness, BL, and another I couldn't see), bottled beers, and full bar.  I've had a few of their items now and like the Cilantro and Lime Chicken sandwich with spicy fries.  The French Dip sandwich is also really good.  Just an FYI, they do play classic rock music there, which is fairly loud.  I didn't mind it at all, but there was one patron (older) that was complaining the last time we were there.  The staff is really good and attentive.  All in all we will be going there more often."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the chorizo and egg in a hash brown bowl.  It was delicious, very filling and awesome presentation!  If you are a Minnesota Vikings fan this is the place for you:)   There are tons of flat screens to watch games and horse betting is available."}
{"text":"This place was pretty busy for a Thursday evening. The bar was very full but I got a seat. The bartenders were very friendly. I ordered a French dip which was pretty good. Good value for the money. The well drinks were very small and didn't taste like they had much alcohol in them. The environment was noisy but that's ok because it's mostly a bar atmosphere. Overall a-ok."}
{"text":"Seems like a fun place to drink and hang out.  The Spicy Thai wings were nice and big and the flavor was fantastic!  Shared a smoked pulled pork sandwich and it was pretty good.  I think the service could have been a little better since there were only 2 tables of people eating.  Several at the bar that the bartender was taking care of.  I think it's over priced for what you get.  I think everything should have been $2-$4 less.  The happy hour special for domestic bottles is $3.25 and most places it's $2.  I would go back to check it out during happy hour, but probably not to eat."}
{"text":"More of a bar than anything. I think their food is way too greasy and when I go in there, something is always sticky. That's pretty gross.."}
{"text":"FIrst time and just passing through.  Saw someone order the Bratwurst Sliders that were listed as appetizer.  Four nice size sliders with bratwurst, swiss cheese and sauerkraut.  Also comes with plate of fries!  Surprising for appetizer but I wasn't complaining.  Very tasty.  Price was right.  Atmosphere was like a neighborhood bar.  Nothing special unless you are a regular.  Gave it that extra star just becuase of brat sliders.  never seen it before and it was tasty.  Good solid choice for some bar food and cocktails."}
{"text":"Fish wasn't cooked. Good Guinness. My wife and I stopped in for dinner on Saturday 4-17-10 around 5:00. We sat on the patio and ordered Guinness while we looked at the menu. She got a French Dip and me - Fish & Chips. Easy. The patio was comfortable with the misters but the cushions on the wrought iron chairs had a lot of wear (sweat) on them - pretty gross. The food arrived and looked good. Her sandwich was great; lots of French Dips around are pretty flavorless. My fish was deep-fried and crispy. A really big piece and a very small piece. Started w/ the small which was just okay. Then tearing off a piece of the big portion - it was much juicier than fish should be - at closer look, it was kind of clear looking flesh, not flaky. The waitress was right there and pleaded ignorance since she has never eaten fish. I told here to just get me a French Dip instead. About ten minutes later it showed. No apology from the waitress (although she was nice enough) and no acknowledgement at all from the kitchen or anyone else. If it was my restaurant I would've comped the entire meal - at least the food part.  Wasn't busy so I'm not sure why the kitchen may have been rushed if that was the problem. We won't be back."}
{"text":"This is my first review of this place. First and best, I can walk here. Not helpful for anybody but Tramonto people, but there are lots of you. I had 2 tall icy beers and a chicken ceasar salad. Getting the beers was nice, easy and quick, even though the Torpedo IPA I ordered was on tap at \"the back bar\". I'm assuming way down by the pool tables, electronic dart board, and juke box is another bar. 
The main bar is circular and invites conversation with neighboring drinkers. At 3ish in the afternoon it is mostly guys, but wtf, it's not like I came here to hook up...thats what the internet is for.
People seem happy here. It's not a \"sitting in the dark, mumbling to yourself\" place. 
There's a fanned and misted outside area, maybe for after Mr sun goes down.
Lots of sports flags hanging, but no noticeable Raiders flag...I may downgrade them for that."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch last week and was disappointed.  Food was bleh, nothing special.  Probably not a bad place to go grab a drink just too far for me."}
{"text":"This resturant is located off the Carefree Highway and the I-17.  Its up in the Carefree Highway, and is in a shopping complex with other businesses.  

My friend Austin and I decided to dine here after doing a drive down the carefree highway.  Its a restaurant, with a bar feel to it as well.  When you walk in, the bar is the center point of the resturant, and the seating boarders the resturant.  When we were there, it was seat yourself, and we chose to sit in a booth.

They have a nice menu of appitizers, including nachos, spinach dip, and a few other things as well.  We were greeted by our hostess, who was warm and friendly.  She seemed to have a good grasp on the menu, as we had a few questions about what dish to get.

We ended up splitting an appatizer, which was a plate of sliders.  They have two different types of sliders, one with sauerkraut, and one that is a french dip style.  Since Austin and I couldnt decide which one we wanted, we asked if we could do half and half.    The server said thats A Okay, and they did it at no additional charge.

The server was really good about offering us all kinds of items.  Things like booze, more food, desert, and even after we finished, she asked if I wanted a coffee with baileys!  I passed since I was driving.

I recomend this place if you are ever up in this area.  Great full menu, and its easy to have a conversation here, as the noise level has never been a problem. Worth the stop!"}

{"text":"Clearly I made a serious mistake taking these reviews at face value and not reading the other reviews these people wrote.  Clearly their idea of good food is not my idea of good food.  Clearly some cross referencing should have been done.  While I ate here twice - once at lunch, once at dinner - my experience was varied and mediocre at best.  Lunch was the better of the two for a few reasons - I ordered it to go and I remembered to get my salad dressing on the side.  The worst thing ever is over dressed salads and generic restaurants are infamous for it.  This place is no exception because at dinner the next night I forgot and my side salad showed up a soggy mess.  My marinara at dinner was cream based which is disgusting and also extremely over dressed.  I would have been better off ordering no marinara and just the sausage and plain spaghetti noodles.  

Over zealous dressing fail."}
{"text":"Went here at the recommendation of a friend and was pleasantly surprised. Ordered the margarita and it was quite tasty - seems the alcohol content wasn't amazing but decent. Chips & dip and wings very good indeed. 

The interesting thing this place had going was the quality of the patrons singing karaoke. Some of these people need to go audition for American Idol!"}
{"text":"For those of you who don't know how to yelp correctly; it's about the food. Almost didn't come to this place because of the stupid reviews. Review the FOOD people and comment on the service and atmosphere.  We had the Cajun shrimp angel hair pasta all done perfect.  Ahi tuna salad was fresh, tuna cooked perfect and the wasabi dressing wonderful in the tongue    BTW- service was 5 stars as well.  We'll be in AZ a few more days and gonna come back a few times before we leave. Wonderful!"}
{"text":"This community at I-17 and Carefree does not have a lot of choices. People that live nearby, people going to the lake or bikers riding the loop come here to have a drink, a little bar food or bet on the ponies. I had a couple of sliders that were enjoyable and a black and tan in a 16oz cold mug. I love the new Golden Tee golf game, lots of fun. The gals are nice."}
{"text":"Just wasn't for me...

Cowboys everywhere... the food was not good. I suspect it's a great spot if you live in the neighborhood and want a place to meet friends. If you are alone forget it. I didn't finish my food, had it wrapped up and went somewhere else to eat."}
{"text":"The food is always great and the atmosphere ranges from chillax to party depending on the live entertainment! Solo artists, bands, and karaoke fill up the weekends and during football season, you don't want to be anywhere else...well, I know I don't. So easy to lose track of time!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a place to watch my beloved eagles and when I called up Azool they let me know immediately that they had The Ticket. I enjoyed my stay at azool, they set me up with a fantastic bar spot and I had front row to the eagles in Arizona! Awesome. I'd absolutely visit again. Just another show of how Arizona hospitality is like no other!!!"}
{"text":"Extremely friendly and a fun place to go. It's like a cheers bar and restaurant where everyone knows your name. We will go back"}
{"text":"I have to preface this with: Our expectations in the far North Valley are terribly low. 

That said, Azool is good by any standard. 

It's set up with the bar in the center, with old-style wooden booths along one wall, a fairly large performance / dining space, and a great patio. 

The servers really set Azool apart. They all know the menu, they're willing to bend over backwards to get you want you want, and they're always far enough away that they aren't hovering, but close and attentive enough to catch your eye if you need something.

The menu is both modern and unpretentious. Everything from barely-grilled panko-crusted ahi sashimi over greens, to basic bar sliders. It's a brief menu (only a page), but it's the kind of food I actually eat. 

My one complaint is that they only have a handful of beers on tap, and aren't very adventurous with their drinks. 

Sometimes they have live music, and it's great. Just someone with a guitar and a good voice, playing good music.

\"Good\" about sums up Azool. Everything about it is predictable, but well-done and enjoyable.

Update: Went here last night, and they ran out of carbon dioxide for the soda. They ran to the grocery store and bought some bottled soda for us, and still didn't charge us for the drinks. Awesome service."}
{"text":"Had the burger and fries. It was ok not bad but not great. I hate when restaurants don't have ketchup on the table instead brings a small container which is never enough."}
{"text":"I may be a few months too late and writing this review but the facts of what happened still matter I had been drinking with a friend of mine and we buy each other drinks all the time never have been a problem and one night I was unable to tip the waitress that was working spoke with her told her and told her I would get her next time she was completely OK with it then I had asked to get a water and because of their $10 minimum on any card my friend had got a beer for her and I and completely forgot about my water so when I asked for it I was told I could go to the bathroom and drink the water out of the toilet as that was the husband of the owner  that was saying that and the owner that was standing right there. I have never been so disrespected in my life and refuse to give them any more of my money."}
{"text":"The is the best casual local bar the north valley has to offer. My husband and I frequent here mostly to eat . The food is always fresh and delicious. I highly recommend the burgers , best beef dip and yummy sweet potato mashers stuffed in a pablano chile."}
