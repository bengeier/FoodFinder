{"text":"I have been there for 3 times, and i guess it's time to write a review on this restaurant. They just reopened after the renovation and it is a huge improvement, especially the dinning area. It is more tidy and clean. Food remains in a high quality, very fresh and tasty. I can see they spent some efforts on the food quality. I like their coffee cup design as it won't burn my hand. Most of the meal cost around $10 and I have no complaints with the price, especially in that area. 
(Frankly speaking, it's $10 's meal place, what do you expect?)
The only drawback is the speed. It usually takes around 5-10 mins to get it. Not a place for people in real rush.

P.S: The store managers are friendly and they really care about customers comments."}
{"text":"Their spicy chicken sandwich was a-okay! ... the pancakes were decent as well. It was nothing special but an experience. Fairly decent on pricing for something in downtown. Parking was easily found opposite the building."}
{"text":"My order of egg and bacon sandwhich was very good.  The bacon was crispy and the eggs  was over easy as I had requested.  They only use white bread.  Will be back to try the French Toast."}
{"text":"There is a distinct lack of decent restaurants near my home, with the exception of \"WOW Sushi\" and maybe 7 West.  There's really nothing good for breakfast, so my wife and I  had been anticipating the opening of this place for the last few weeks.

This appears to be an attempt at a North American breakfast eatery gone horribly wrong.  It would be akin to two white guys from Cleveland who go to Korea and set up a congee or Bibimbap shop. They might have been successful opening a burger or wing joint, but certainly nothing of local fare.

I ordered the \"Best-Omelette\" ($7.95) while my wife had the eggs, sausage, bacon and french toast. ($8.95).  Add a coffee and Coke and the total came to $20.20 with tax.  Not too shabby if the food is decent.

Alas, it was not.

My dish consisted of small button mushrooms (whole), monterey jack cheese, eggs and a small portion of melon which was really more of a garnish; and I'd asked them to toss the bread and add in a little extra fruit. The omelette was dry and lacked flavour.  

My wife's dish was pretty strange.  Instead of sausage, they formed a small amount of hamburger into a tiny patty.  Did they think this would pass for sausage?  She also asked for her eggs \"over easy\", but they came scrambled.  This was after they verified for the second time how she wanted her eggs prepared.

Lastly, our dishes came out about 8 minutes apart.  Not horrible if you're eating family style in a Vietnamese restaurant, but full of suck for the purpose of eating breakfast together.

I gave them an extra star because they've just opened in the last day or two.  I'll check back in a month or so to hopefully up their rating."}
{"text":"The grilled cheese was good, prepared with a sharper cheddar and large thick slices of (egg?) bread. It took awhile to come out but that is likely because of the fries. Price was cheap considering the neighborhood (8 bucks tax in with fries and pop). 

Will probably return from time to time when I'm in a real grilled cheese mood. However, the atmosphere is decidedly lacking (no sound other than the hum of a beverage cooler)  but the manger did ask me before I left how I found everything. It is evident this is a start up looking to do their best an I give them credit for this."}
{"text":"This place should be called TOAST, because everything I ordered seemed formerly delicious with a side of BURNT.

I went because it was newly opened a while back and it was conveniently located in my neighbourhood.

It was a Saturday morning and it was quite busy with 5 staff in the open kitchen and cash out.  They all looked completely confused and one of the 'managers' was yelling at the cook.... this is an OPEN kitchen remember.  I can see you guys bickering!!  Save it in the privacy of your office please.

I ordered 2 hamburgers with a side of fries.  Found  NOW Magazine to read until my order was done.  I finished flipping through it.  They told me 5 more mins.  So I waited a bit.  Then I left and went to browse another store nearby to pass the time.  By the time I came back it still was not ready so I waited a couple more mins.  All in all, 20 mins to get my small order.

The bread buns were over toasted and basically flaked apart into a dust after I brought it home 5 mins later to eat it.  The fries were shoestring sized and were a bit burnt in colour and taste.

They are probably new to this type of operation.  I would not personally order from here again but I have ordered items for my boyfriend who loves breakfast food... even with the burnt taste.... though he would say otherwise."}
{"text":"Bbreakfasts is a nice little place... if you stay away from the breakfast. What they really should call themselves is Bgrilledcheese, because that's my favorite thing on the menu. They make it the homestyle way -- nothing fancy, just cheese slapped between two thick slices of bread. It can't be beat for a ~$3 lunch. As I mentioned, the breakfast left something to be desired. The fries and poutine are okay, if a bit soggy.

The real travesty, however, is that they don't serve tomato soup. What goes better with grilled cheese than tomato soup? Nothing, that's what! So, whenever I get a grilled cheese from Bbreakfasts, I often take it to my place and heat up a can of soup to go with. I'd much rather skip that step and get soup at the same place I get my sandwich.

However, the people that work there have been so super nice to me, that I almost feel guilty for not liking their food better. They've always been super polite. There's a sign on the door lately saying that they haven't been able to fulfill coupon orders due to \"low inventory\" (or something like that), so I suspect they've fallen victim to overselling themselves on daily deal sites. Hope that they get that resolved."}
{"text":"Sadly, bBreakfasts is no more. It is now SLAB BURGER. So if you've always wondered why your burger was not a SLAB of meat instead of a dainty patty, your time has come."}
