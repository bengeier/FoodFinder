{"text":"Boy, it is a sad state of affairs when I walk out of this restaurant and say to my husband, \"God  that service sucked,\" and the people who walked out next to us said, \"we agree.\"  No greeting at the counter, clerk didn't understand what pinot noir was, only included one piece of pizza in order when I ordered two and then, stated that only one piece of pizza was available and we were to wait.  And wait my poor husband did.  His piece of supreme pizza was given away at the drive through window.  After waiting 10 mins and eating my own pizza, I finally asked the busser where my husband's piece of pizza was.  He looked up and saw no pieces there (remember his piece was given away to the drive through).  I said, \"My husband is not going to wait forever.  How about you give him a different slice.  He then went back and got another piece.  No, \"I'm sorry it took so long, No, \"I'm sorry that you didn't get what you wanted.\"  Just nothing.  It will be a cold day before I go to this location again.  If the manager reads this, get new help fast, train them right in customer service,  and if you want to send me a coupon for a free meal, please PM me.  We deserve it."}
{"text":"Got a slice today around 7PM, drove home to eat it, only to find out the cheese was hard, the crust was kinda crispy but the dough was still really gooey. I usually get a slice 2-3 times a week and it's either a hit or miss unfortunately. Throw out old slices instead of selling them.  definitely disappointed."}
{"text":"I read the previous reviews and almost didn't stop in today. But my love for Rocky Rococo's pizza won out, and I decided to give this location a chance. I'm so glad I did! Service was fantastic. Honestly, it was better than I've had at any other location. The pizza was wonderful, as usual, and the wait was not bad at all. Do not let the other reviews scare you off! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"February 14, 2018  Stpped here on our way to Madison. Granted they were running a Valentine special BUT we stopped for a slice. Ordered  a meal with Uncle Sal's, breadsticks and a drink; also an extra Uncle Sam's slice.  Disgusting, burned them kept too long, really disappointed with slices, rubber crust... Same with breadsticks, old, old, old.  I want my money back but wasn't given receipt. I was embarassed as I twice worked for Rocky's in the Madison area.   We left everything on the table, didn't bother to complain, so busy. However... My almost $15 should have given me QUALITY Rockys whether they were busy or not."}
{"text":"Ask the guy what they had available and he said pepperoni so I order thru the drive thru. I get to the window and said its a five min wait. I said I asked what was a available but I guess I'll wait. So he just took my money and didn't hand me my drink to wait."}
{"text":"Not sure what's up with all the lackluster reviews. This location's friendly staff always exceed my expectations, and the food is consistently great! I'm a fan, especially since Rocky's is a Madison original."}
{"text":"The service at this location is insulting. It's very, very poor.  The product is good, if you can get past the clerk making you feel unwelcome.  My advice would be to check and see if the blond woman is working the counter, and if so, go somewhere else. Like anyone who grew up in Madison with Rockys, it's always been a favorite. Just don't go to this location."}
{"text":"Ordered a large pizza as a take out.  It looked great except when we got home we realized the bottom crust was not baked.  It tasted bad.  I tried to bake it longer in my oven, but it still gave us a stomach ache.  Even though our first experience here was good, not sure if we will be back.  I just never feel very welcome here and I haven't heard good things from others regarding the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Got some pizza and the salad bar around 5:30PM.  The pizza was old and hard and had 2 slices to choose from.  The salad bar was not fresh and was a mess.  The mushrooms were slimey and the pickles were rotten. Very disappointed. I would not recommend a visit to this location."}
{"text":"No pizza ready for lunch rush. Not ideal for fast food lunch breaks. Had to wait quite a while. Disappointed."}
{"text":"This location left a lot to be desired. That really surprised me.... The first thing that REALLY turned me off was the fact that I ordered cheese with my breadsticks. They charge extra, no big deal... I get my food and they didn't include my Marinara sauce that automatically comes with your breadsticks. I asked for it and the lady seemed a bit put off that I wanted my Marinara too.   Listen, if you're going to play games and only offer one sauce with the breadsticks, DONT CHARGE EXTRA! Jeeze.    I can't say I plan on going back to this location, NO WAY.   I'll stick with the Rocky Rococo on Madison's West Side. Sorry you got a dud Sun Prairie!"}
{"text":"Remember when you were a kid and you were always trying to eat the raw cookie dough mom had in the kitchen? It tasted pretty good, and it was worth your mama yellin' at you about it.   However, raw pizza dough has no where near the same appeal. We've been here several times since they opened, and EVERY time the crust is virtually uncooked on the bottom. It's like chewing a huge chunk of flavorless bubble gum. No one should be biting into a piece of pizza and thinking \"mmm the crust is so ooey and gooey, like it wasn't cooked!\"   We've given up on this location, and with 10+ other pizza places in the 53590 zip code, there is no good reason to go to a pizza joint that can't cook their pizzas properly."}
{"text":"The establishment itself is very beautiful, but the service needs some serious work. I have tried this place several times and will not be returning. People running the cash register are never friendly, not even a warm hello has ever been said. I went through the drive through once and got breadsticks and got all the way home just to find out they didn't give me marinara sauce when I specifically asked twice for it. The woman working didn't say one word to me, no hello or goodbye. I'm sick of the service here, it's pretty obvious that the employees are only there to get a paycheck and they could care less about the customers."}
{"text":"My family and I came here and ordered a family size pizza and cheese bread to eat inside the restaurant. They gave us a number and told us our order would be out in a few minutes. After waiting over 35 minutes (!!) we went up to the counter and asked where our food was. Nobody seemed to know anything about our order or the status of it. Finally someone said, 'oh your cheesebread has been sitting up here under the lights'. Okay?? So why didn't you bring it out to us? Another 10 minutes and we finally got our pizza. Someone did come out, possibly the manager not sure, and had us write our name and number down on a sheet so we could get our same order again for free at a different date. Free food is nice but I'm not sure I want to come back for it any time soon. I am grateful they tried to fix the situation though."}
{"text":"New Sun Prairie location. Expected a little more fanfare for grand opening but there really wasn't anything.  No opening deals, fun, nada. On top of that they forgot to take our pizza to our table.  Still. Rocky's has a place in my heart having had lots of memories eating at the other stores.  :/"}
