{"text":"Omg! This place is very modern with a hint of old school style, beautiful earthy colours make you feel relaxed and comfortable. The music here is very rustic and in Greek so I don't understand a thing! But hey who cares if it sound good I'm not gonna complain. The lamb here is quite scrumptious! Btw I normally hate lamb because of the gamey wild taste and foul oder the meat has. I had the mussels and vegetables in wine sauce as a starter and I found it mediocre but I would come back to this place and that's says a lot. Service is good and food came out quickly. Definitely a hidden gem on he danforth that I never tried before :)"}
{"text":"Spent $90 here and what we got was:
-burnt lamb chops (some parts of the lamb were seared to the point where it was simply not edible. Was very bitter and dry. 
-charred quail (was way too dry and tasteless. No moisture was to be found in the bird whatsoever. I was completely convinced that someone had simply thrown a couple of thawed quails into the oven without seasoning or marinating them, and forgot about them for the next 50 minutes.) 
-lukewarm service.

The salad was the best part of the meal, and that should say something. 

Avoid."}
{"text":"I ate here last night. I've been here a few times in the past and remembered it as a place with really good food. I was not disappointed. All 3 courses were delicious and my friend ordered a different combo and also loved her choices.

I also really like the service. It has a more european feel to it where I feel like I'm well taken care of but also allowed to just sit not bothered until I look up to indicate I need something. I know some people think they're being ignored if the server is not coming over to talk to them all the time but I like this.  They are paying attention, water glasses are kept filled, plates are removed as soon as they are empty etc.

As far as I'm concerned, if I'm going to eat greek on the Danforth, this is where I'm going to go."}
{"text":"buConsistently great! I have been to Ouzeri 5 times over the years and my visit here this past Saturday was again pleasant overall. 

My boyfriend and I ordered off their $15 summerlicious menu, which is an excellent value considering both portions and flavor!

We both ordered Mydia - Mussels (a Must-try-item!!) as our first course, then ordered Chicken Souvlaki (Moist on the inside but great grill char on the outside  with tons of flavor and best of all, no grease!) and Fried Kalamari (both come with rice pilaf and lemon potatoes) as entrees. For our dessert we got Baklava and Loukoumades (honey fritters - they were so Yummy!). 

I took the last star off because of two glitches, one mishap from the kitchen, but more importantly an excuse I got from their hostess when I asked to move to another table. 

I was there for lunch and it was a hot day. I had made a reservation for two and requested a patio table since I was planning to bring my puppy. When I arrived, although I mentioned my reservation, I didn't see any tables on the patio with a reserved sign. All the tables in the shade were taken and I was seated under the sun. Shortly after I started my first course, a table (two small tables put together to accommodate 4 ppl)behind us became empty. I asked the hostess if we could separate those tables and moved to one of them. She refused. Not even a minute later another couple just walking in to the restaurant requested the same thing, and their request was accepted. This was quite upsetting.

My boyfriend's mussels dish had a small piece of hair. We were both so bummed because it was extremely tasty. When we brought this to our waitress's attention, she apologized immediately and handled it in a very professional way. She did not hesitate to bring us a fresh new one instead of trying to argue otherwise or wasting time to come up with excuses.

This outstanding service from our waitress carried on throughout the entire time we were there, and very fortunately, this combined with excellent, and clean flavor from all our dishes overshadowed the unpleasant hostess. 

I will most definitely be returning to Ouzeri - Just can't say no to their SUPERB yummyness!"}
{"text":"I had one of the worst experiences of my life in this restaurant, okay - I'm exaggerating but it really was just about that awful. The food was greasy, sour, made without care - and they tried to make up for it by giving you three times more food than anyone could possibly eat. 

The service was unforgivable. The restaurant was empty and the waiter didn't once come back to check on us, to see how everything was going. He screwed up our order, he didn't refill our drinks/ water once, didn't offer us coffee with desert, and he brought the cheque without conforming that we were finished. We felt unwelcome, and the waiter's ego was felt by all of us, during the entire meal. It was actually really upsetting. 

I can't believe this place is still in business. I'm a long time resident in the neighborhood, and I think this is just about the worse choice that you could make for dinner on the Danforth."}
{"text":"I bought teambuy voucher and we went to this restaurant. It was too noisy. Most of the greek restaurant are noisy, so no complain. 
The foods were good, I liked the muscle which I ordered as starter. Then I had Chicken Souvlaki and Cream Caramel and Coffee for desert. My wife ordered meza for start and lamb shank pie as main and coffee and some sweet for desert (I forget the name).
They were welcome and overall service was good. I can give 6out of 10 to this restaurant. 
I have a comment for the manager,The floor and tables need to special cleaning care."}
{"text":"Very good food. We had a few different appetizers, including the grilled octopus and spicy meatballs. Both excellent. Their wine list is Greek and runs from 35 to 70 and more for a bottle. Very good selection and price range. The place was pretty empty at 5 pm, so we got a nice spot on the patio. It was pretty busy by 630pm. Server John is a great guy. A very enjoyable evening."}
{"text":"Loved how fresh their dips were.  Better than the dips at the few other greek restaurants I've been to on the strip.   They usually have a fixed price lunch / dinner deal.  Be very hungry if you get this because the portions are huge"}
{"text":"If you are looking for to Kallitero Greek joint to hit on Danforth, pate sto Ouzeri!

First, the ambiance was enchanting. Low lit, with nice Hellenic nick-nacks but tastefully put together, with some light bouzoukia mousiki in the background.

The food was amazing across the board. We had the saganaki, spanikopita, horiatiki salata, kalamarakia, however the piece de la resistance was the octopus. Boiled, then grilled, with a near perfect consistency on the palette, and served up with lemon and olive oil. 

Lastly, the service was excellent, and despite the late hour, the staff (some of whom speak fluent Greek) acted like true Greek taverna owners and waited until our party was ready to depart at well after 11 pm. . .on a weeknight.

Efaristo para poly!!!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this Greektown resto, since we are always hearing about other venues in the area and had not heard much about this one. We came here for an early Mother's Day lunch, and were able to book a day ahead via OpenTable.

We started with the saganaki (cheese flamb√©e), just because it's fun and was a new dish for some. FYI: It's a bit more exciting in the evening when you can see the flames.

I had a Greek salad with grilled calamari, and the portion size was just right for me. I usually want to try the grilled calamari when I eat around here, and Ouzeri's did not disappoint! It was done quite nicely - not greasy or chewy. The salad was fresh and crisp. I would recommend this over the Ouzeri salad. I enjoyed my dish and recommend it if you do not want a heavy meal.

The service was fine - nothing to rave about, but also nothing to complain about. I don't recall any issues with getting water, although we did have to request refills.

I'd put Ouzeri forward as a fairly solid option for people wanting to enjoy a casual meal on the Danforth."}
{"text":"Solid Greek food that hits all the expected points, but doesn't seem to do much to differentiate from the formidable local competition. The Bifteca was tasty, but the seasoning seemed a bit similar to standard Gyros meat.

The service was quite fast, and the waiter was affable... though at times his demeanour almost seemed rude. For example, when we asked for a prix fixe menu or for separate bills, he seemed a bit put out. Seemed like a friendly enough guy, though.

Baklava was a highlight-- added touch of cinnamon really set it apart from the crowd."}
{"text":"This restaurant should get five stars for the service alone. Spectacular people, amazing and attentive, great sense of humour, made our night!!

The food was unbelieveable, muscles so fresh, and the mains cooked to perfection!!

Pricing for what you get can't be beat! 2 appetizers, 2 mains, a btl of wine and dessert for $108. If you had that 1.5km closer to downtown that would have been closer to $300!! 

I strongly suggest going to Ouzeri!! It was an amazing night out!! Thank you to the staff!!"}
{"text":"I eat here on a regular basis.  The portions are enough for two and I personally love the falafel, shawarma, chicken kabob, and mango salad. I've tried the beef and lamb kebabs a few times and fin they are hit and miss, not sure why, and to bad because when it's a hit its amazing. Great dependable Mediterranean food at a reasonable price, good experience whether eating in or taking out."}
{"text":"I'm always impressed when a restaurant offers a vegetarian menu during Winter/Summerlicious.  You'd think it wouldn't be such a big deal, but if you've ever tried to join friends for dinner only to be faced with the same generic pasta dish that's every restaurant's fallback option, you'd understand.  So any place that even tries to make a vegetarian dish that isn't covered in tomato sauce earns points from me, and a place that actually gets it right--as Ouzeri does--definitely impresses me.  In short, try the chickpea moussaka.  Seriously, I'm still thinking about it."}
{"text":"Amazing Greek food. Generous portions.  I love the scallop app dish.  It's filling enough for an entree to be honest.  Friendly service."}
{"text":"I've been going there for a couple of years almost monthly and found the service and food deteriorating. I guess they may have viewed us as regulars and didn't give us the service most customers were getting. The salad dressing was becoming bland and chicken souvlaki was getting to be more on the burnt side. Also noted a few infractions upon an inspection by the city
inspected on: April 28, 2015
Inspection finding: Yellow (Conditional)
Number of infractions: 3 (Significant: 1, Crucial: 2)
Crucial infractions include: Handle ice in unsanitary manner. Store hazardous foods at internal temperature between 4 C and 60 C."}
{"text":"Over the weekend I went for dinner. We were first seated in a small corner of the restaurant where more tables were actually available but we're very kind about moving us when we asked. I wouldn't say the service is top notch as it wasn't a busy night with four tables were actually seated and there was give workers. Our server was slow for order and not even refills for water. After dinner as we waited for the bill we saw that the workers were actually having there break and chatting with each other rather than attending to their customers. Overall we enjoyed our appetizer, the mussels but good is mediocre. Not sure if I will return any time soon as it's not really special atmosphere or good service."}
{"text":"Quantit√© de bouffe √©norme.
Qualit√© moyenne.

La place est bien situ√©e, l'alcool est cher et pas tr√®s bon."}
{"text":"Overall a 3/5, but admit I'd give them 4/5 for a warm atmosphere and delicious food--gorgeous green olive oil, moist tasty salmon and dolmades to die for! But that's not all there is to a meal, right? We found the staff had no personality and were very inattentive. We had to stack our own appetizer plates because they didn't come to clear for sooo long. And if we hadn't flagged them for more water, for the next round of drinks and for the bill, we would still be waiting. Not cool."}
{"text":"This place is great! If you like Greek food, this place is a must.

We were a group of 4, dining on a Sunday evening right on the patio. No reservations.
It was an impromptu decision to try it out. The place was buzzing with patrons. So we were lucky to have a nice table outside.

The food: 
Appetizers: Calamari, fried. Awesome! Chicken liver: Surprisingly tasty!

Entree: I had the lamb chops with rice and potatoes served on a rectangular dish. Very juicy and fresh. Had it medium rare. Cooked to perfection. Most places you tell them medium rare, they still overcook it. Ouzeri had it right!  5/5

The misses had the lamb souvlaki. It also tasted very nice, but not as fresh or tender as the chops. My advice, if you like lamb, go for the chops. 4/5

Service:
The waiters were cool and very friendly. Service was prompt. Didn't really have to wait that long. No complaints 4/5


I am very surprised to not find this place rated higher on Yelp. The food was alot better than Pantheon that is down the street and the service great. We just chilled, ate wicked delicious food and had lots of laughs."}
{"text":"Good Greek food. Very good price for the wine. Service was good. I would probably go back."}
{"text":"This was the worst restaurant I've ever been to. There were 10 of us and we all went out to celebrate a friends birthday. From beginning to end this place was a nightmare.

All the appetizers but mine came out. I had to wait another 10 minutes to receive the salad I ordered. Let me also add we had to remind him that we ordered it and it hadn't come.  My friend asked 3 times for an iced tea and the waiter still hadn't brought it to us. I had to ask my boyfriend to ask for the iced tea in Greek. That's when the waiter finally listened and brought my friend her iced tea.  The bread that came with our meal was probably the best part of our meal.

When the mains came out everyone got theirs except for me and a friend of mine. We asked him where our food was after about 15 minutes of not receiving it. He told us it would be out in 15 minutes and that he forgot put in the order with the chef.  When my food came it wasn't what I ordered. The rosemary pie came but the rice and potatoes weren't on the plate. Instead there was a side salad. The menu clearly stated that any mean course comes with rice and potatoes. He apologized and came back a few minutes later with them. By the time we got our food everyone else was almost done theirs.

During the meal the waiter knocked over my friends glass of wine while he was cleaning off the table. She has just poured it and was ready to drink it. The waiter laughed and said it was good luck. He didn't offer to get her a new glass or even apologize for the incident. She had to ask for a replacement. The water was refilled only once the entire night. My friends and I resorted to sharing the drinks we had left over in our glasses, since we were thirsty and our water was never refilled.

The waiter gave everyone their desserts. My boyfriend and I didn't order one but the waiter offered to get us one. We asked if it would be charged to the bill and he stated that it wouldn't. I assumed it was free since all of the hassles that happened through the night. 

When the bill came I was totally disappointed. He charged me for the price fix menu when I clearly stated to him that I didn't want the price fix menu and that I was ordering from the regular menu, when I was placing my order at the beginning of the night.  The price fix menu was 8 dollars more expensive then what I ordered. The waiter ended up putting the dessert that he stated was free, on the bill. We had to ask him to fix the bill and return it when it was correct.

This was the most horrible dining experience I've ever  had. The customer service was horrible and the food wasn't that great either. All and all I would stay away from this place. It was a nightmare and in a city like Toronto, there are so many wonderful places to dine. Don't ruin your night by going here."}
{"text":"We had Mydia, Soupa, Rosemary Pie with lamb, Souvlaki, creme caramel & Yiaourti, they all are very good"}
{"text":"first impression, the restaurant was busy, very happening and the place was nice.

I was here with a group of friends over the weekend and we were excited to have a great meal and drinks.

Our waitress was meh, she didn't seem to want to be there or to even serve us.  A few of us ordered a pint of beer (they only have one on tap) then our waitress came back to tell us that there was no more beer on tap. So ordered a different beer and that one wasn't available either.. our food was slow to come some of us had to ask to get our appetizer as others were getting their dinners and honestly didn't taste any better than the friendly greek or mr greek and I've had better service there!

overall I give this place a 2 because the food wasn't horrible but I wouldn't recommend it to a friend of to people going there with a group!"}
{"text":"Went around 8 it was an unbusy night. We ordered the price fix and food was delicious. Hummus was incredible."}
{"text":"a little tricky to find at night, but a cozy spot with delicious food. opa!"}
{"text":"This food was good.  I ordered the meze for my appetizer and it wasn't bad.  The mussels almost had an odd hint of something not quite greek, although my husband says they were good.  Adequate.  

I went to the clutch chicken souvlaki for my entree, and boy did old faithful come through.  Chicken was well seasoned, piping hot and came accompanied with delightful lemon potatoes and rice.  The tatziki sauce was normal.

My husband ordered the angus steak.  He almost ate himself to an accident.  He seemed content.

For dessert, I ordered the greek yogurt with honey and walnuts.  It was very rich, the honey was tasty.  No complaints.  The hubby got the creme caramel.  Normal.  

Overall, the ambiance was great, abundant seating, drinks were reasonably priced and wait staff were alright.  We'll definitely go back in the future!"}
{"text":"I'm not gonna sit here and call myself some kinda greek food expert, nor have I been to all of the Danforth hot spots. But I do know that Ouzeri is all kinds of *drooool*.

The space itself is lovely - great for patio dining but their indoor seating feels comfortable and intimate even though it's quite full. Service is wonderful - knowledgeable and friendly, with a family-run feel (maybe they are?). 

The menu is dense and delicious. Good wine selection and it's next to impossible to order less than two apps. The saganaki might make you wet your pants; the octopus is worth eight hugs (I had to demand a location to buy their olive oil). If you go for the generic souvlaki dinner, you won't be disappointed; I could lick the plate clean of that tzatziki. And if the rosemary pie didn't have lamb in it, I'd order it (just cause it's called rosemary pie. Come on!!). 

So far, this is my top Greek spot in the city. Got any other suggestions to top it?"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon.  I tasted the following:

Saganaki (appetizer) $10.25 - a flat piece of salty cheese that is flamed in front of you with a shot of something.  After the flames die down, they squeeze some lemon on it.  This cheese was really good, though I've only had saganaki one other time, so I don't have much to compare to.  Easily shareable among 3-5 people.  It might be tough for two people to finish since its a bit heavy.

Classic Mousaka (it also comes in a vegetarian version) $15.95 - sort of like a sheppards pie.  Baked with minced beef, eggplant.  Comes with a salad.  Good overall.

Grilled Calamari on a salad $15.95 - pretty large portion.  The salad was good, nothing special.  The grilled calamari was excellent though.  Thick cut pieces, grilled perfectly, very soft and tender. 

Lamb Pie $18.95 - lamb stew in a filo pastry.  The lamb was really tender, and the filo pastry was as expected. Comes with a salad.   This dish was also quite good.

Service was good, no issues.

Portion wise, I felt it was a bit on the small side.  However, they do bring bread and butter before the meal.  I found everything to be simple and fresh tasting.  

Probably closer to 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"On my recent travels through Greece I completely fell in love with Greek salads,  fresh thwacked & grilled Octopus and oregano potatoes with Tzitki. I never knew that I loved Greek food THIS MUCH until then, and I had been just waiting to have a solid Greek meal since my return.

So Lauren M. (review below) sets up a lunch at Ouzeri during the infamous Winterlicious. Looking at the menu online, there was a good variety of options and it was only $15 so I thought I'd give it a try. 

SO glad I did. Usually Winterlicious is a nightmare, even at lunch  (at least in my experience -- looking at you Bistro 990) And the quality of food and service is usually lacking. Not here. We were given really generous portions and efficient service.

Appetizer was some lovely artichoke hearts in a garlic sauce. Good! Not spectacular, but solid for artichoke lovers. Main was a vegetarian mousakka which was tasty and hearty. Served with rice and potatoes, I could barely finish half of the plate. Lacking a bit in the B√©chamel area but forgivable. Dessert was a utterly fantastic two scoops of thick Greek yogurt with Greek honey and walnuts. Again, I could barely eat half. 

The feature wine (which also is usually a Winterlicious disappointment) was a pleasantly full bodied and tasty red and priced at $7 a glass. 

My only regret was not getting the Kalamari. I had serious grilled seafood envy as it looked soo ooooo tasty.

Will return."}
{"text":"I've been to this place three times. Each time we ordered a broad selection of appetizers and main courses.  On our first and second visit we went mid week, the place was not crowded and the food was great. We ate muscles, beef tenderloin, rack of lamb and the chicken souvlaki. Everything was good. 

If I'd reviewed the place after visit one or two, I would probably give it 3 or 4 stars. BUT on our third visit, on a friday, the place was crowded and the food was much worse. All our meat was undercooked, we sent back two fillets and a lamb dish, and they came back still pretty rare. The muscles which we ordered again were much worse also. The kitchen just can't handle busy days. I will not go back, the last visit was disastrous, especially at the fairly high price. 

They also wouldn't let us re-cork a wine bottle to take home, which they claimed was illegal. I checked the liquor laws after, and it's in fact legal. Idiots."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a Greek colleague of mine.  Very good mussels and rosemary pie! very tasty and fresh. My girlfriend had Gigantes and salmon and told me they were excellent. Very nice atmosphere and very good service! Really like it!"}
{"text":"Traditional creative culinary improvement without making Greek food unrecognizable. Everything was fantastic however, the lamb chops and pork souvlakia....they are a must! Service was friendly, professional and welcoming. Defiantly the best on Danforth!"}
{"text":"Sampled Ouzeri's $25 3-course Greek prix fixe dinner with my wife and son during Winterlicious.  For years our regular \"go to\" restaurant for Greek food on the Danforth has been Astoria a few blocks to the west.  We were all excited to try a new place and the menu was very appealing.  We each chose different starters and mains.  We all chose baklava for dessert.   For starters we tried Gigantes (a lima bean casserole), Meze (3 traditional greek dips including humus, taramosalata and eggplant) and Mydia (mussels steamed in red wine, tomatoes, herbs & garlic).  For mains we tried the Grilled Calamari, the Lamb Pie and the Pork Souvlaki.  Portions were generous and included rice, roasted vegetables and greens.   Nothing was bad.  But nothing was great.  The souvlaki was overcooked and dry.  Everything was surprisingly bland.  This in spite of the generous use of garlic in the tzatziki.  Service was professional and attentive.  The atmosphere was warm & friendly.  And Ouzeri definitely has a far more sophisticated atmosphere than Astoria.  That said, all three of us felt the food didn't come close to Astoria.  Disappointing.  Only served to reconfirm our loyalty to Astoria."}
{"text":"A very cozy place that serves awesome dishes.Try grilled octopus and lamb, they are so tender and delish~! The prices are very affordable and food is delicious, I recommend this place for casual dinner at any occasion."}
{"text":"Went for a late lunch and had a table close to the patio the restaurant is nice and clean. 
I ordered chicken souvlaki which was good. But I found there was just to much olive oil everything was covered so I used my side plate to get rid of some of the oil.  
My husband had the moussaka and he said it was very good. I tried it and it was yummy. Very similar to what we tried in Greece.  We both had the Greek salad with lots of yummy feta and the dressing was very good.   
I did mention to the waitress that we did come here after hearing it from Yelp but we didn't get the discount.  I didn't notice as my husband paid.  :(.  
I had the yogurt with honey and fig dessert,which I thought was very good.  Great way to end the meal. Not to large"}
{"text":"Enjoyed $ 15 Summerlicious with my family.

I ordered 1 Martini as a start and they made an error by gave us 2 (We were being charged 2 Martini, of course...OMG).
My family asked for 2 glasses of water before ordered the meal and we kept waiting for that for a very long while.
Taste of food is not bad. We loved their Mussels & Calamari. Dessert (esp. BAILEY'S CR√àME CARAMEL) is good to try.YIAOURTI - pressed Greek yogurt topped with nuts and honey poached figs (vegetarian)  - good for someone who loves Greek yogurt. (Don't order if you don't !)

Washroom is clean.

Good to enjoy to sit at t bar chair & tables (indoor) but right next to the outdoor, tiny patio, which good for someone people, like myself, don't like to sit under the sun, but  want to absorb the street atmosphere.
We were being billed $25 Summerlicious dinner in error but they fixed it before we paid (Tip : Always good to check the bill before paid !!!)

Service is alright but might not back again. I prefer Pan on Danforth, based on level of service; but nothing hurt to try once."}
{"text":"I went this Saturday night for an early dinner with some friends. I didn't have a reservation and was told that they were completely booked with reservations for Winterlicious. No biggie - I figured I'd wait for my friends to arrive and we'd go elsewhere. While I was waiting, the hostesses figured out a way to squeeze us in - really appreciate it ladies! Now that's customer service!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere and service here were kind of blah.  The food however was excellent.  I was thinking that the place was going to be a bit more elegant than it was. I guess the last time I was there it was in the winter and was a bit darker so I didn't notice the conditions and now being there when it's still light out really made my eyes open.  Honestly the place was dirty.   It was also cramped which was odd since there were more empty tables than full ones.  I thought to myself why wouldn't they remove some tables to open it up some so when a person has to get to the washroom they aren't fighting with the chairs at the empty tables around them to get out. 

The timing of the food was way too fast as we did not finish our appetizers before our meals arrived.  The waitress didn't have much knowledge of the menu and had a very difficult time being able to take our order as she kept leaving our table to do other things and going back to ask questions to her kitchen.   She initially was in a rush to get our order then at the end took so long to clear the plates and offer coffee or tea.  

The only reason I gave it a 3 star was for the food.  So many Greek restaurants in the area that I probably won't return to this one."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Dirty, ripped up menu's,  old looking salads, unfriendly waiters. Clean washrooms though. Wasted time and 50 $, only had a couple beers and barely toched the food. Would not come back."}
{"text":"YUM YUM YUM. Had lunch there and it was absolutely, friggin, finger licking delicious! I brought my mom here for lunch today, and we left feeling happy and stuffed. 

The place is big, nice and can easily fit larger groups.I vaguely remembered having been here before with friends, and having drank flaming shots and watched a belly dancer contort and move in ways I can only ever dream of doing. 

On this occasion we were greeted by a friendly waitress, who told us to choose were we wanted to sit ( at 2:30pm the place was pretty empty save for a couple other tables). We were handed our menus and left for a few minutes to decide what to get. We decided on the Lemonato dolmades ( grape leaves stuffed with ground beef and creamy arborio rice with a creamy lemon and dill sauce), and banana peppers stuffed with roasted red peppers and feta cheese. For our mains we chose the moussaka and grilled calamari dinner. 

Warm, crusty yet soft bread rolls were brought to our table while we waited for our starters, which came only a few minutes later. The lemonato dolamdes were delicious, and a very generous portion for a starter, the stuffed banana peppers were spicy and also very,very tasty. We were just finishing our starters when our mains came out, unfortunately at this point I was pretty much full from having stuffed my face with warm bread and the generously sized starters. 

Both the moussaka and grilled calamari came with Greek salad,roasted potatoes and rice. I had some of the grilled calamari and it was incredibly tender and delicious! Some of the best grilled calamari I have ever had. The moussaka was also very good, however I was really full and could only handle a couple of bites before I asked for the rest of my dinner to be packed up. 

The service throughout our meal was attentive, and friendly, and our waitress checked on us a few times to make sure were doing fine, and to pour water on our glasses for us. All in all very friendly without being overbearing or annoying. Our two starters with mains and a large bottle of sparkling water came to a little over $60.00. Very reasonable for the amount and quality of food we had. 

My only recommendation when coming here would be to wear pants with some extra room in them, because at the end of my meal I was about ready to loosen my belt by a couple of notches in order to accommodate my \"food bump\"."}
{"text":"I found this place rather pricy and the waiter looked annoyed. I was with children and was under the impression that they were not welcome. We left without trying the food. I just didn't feel they deserved my business."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon after craving moussaka for a while now! The portions for lunch were justttt right and we were pretty satisfied. We shared a moussaka platter (a square slice of layered eggplant, tasty ground beef, and creamy bechamel sauce on top!), and winterlicious lunch meal (mezes dip, calamari and baklava!). The appetizer came with three dips. All were wonderful and tasty. The calamari was lightly battered and fried, not too soggy and not too fried. It was just right! And the baklava... oh my oh my oh my!! Definitely get the baklava if you have a Mega sweet tooth like me! I loveeeed the flakyness and how it was just oooozing sugar and goodness. Even though we were stuffed, we still had room for dessert! I would have ordered a second piece but I had to seriously control myself!!  

Service was great!They were quite attentive and accommodating. Staff was friendly. 

Come to this place if you want good value for good food on the Danforth!"}
{"text":"I had a voucher for this place that was for a 3 course pre-fix dinner for two for $25. 

I started with the spanakopita, which was delicious. My first time having this dish and I really enjoyed it. However, it was big portion for a starter, so needless to say I couldn't finish it all. 

For my entree, I had the chicken souvlaki. Again, it was delicious -- some of the best chicken souvlaki I've ever had in Greek town. The tzatziki sauce was so flavourful. The portions again were huge! I could only get through 3/4 of the dish. The rice that is came with was OK, but the chicken and tzatziki were top notch. 

For dessert (at this point I had no idea where I was going to put it -- I was SO full), I ordered the baklava. I had to wait a bit before I attempted to eat this and let my dinner digest first. The baklava was excellent. It was a generous piece and smothered in just enough honey. I didn't finish it all -- but I wish I could!! 

I had a glass of Jackson Triggs merlot -- it was only $6 for a glass! Went great with my meal.

This place was nice, the staff was friendly and service was prompt. Just make sure you come here hungry! Good value for the $25 pre-fix menu."}
{"text":"This is one of those instances where my expectations were simply not met.  In some ways, I feel that Ouzeri SAW my expectations from across the room, averted their gaze and avoided them all night.  

The food was uneven - the dips were all fresh and first rate - the bread was of the oven warmed commercial variety (seriously, in Toronto?) the spanikopita was great (although I am personally done with it for awhile).  Things dropped precipitously at the grilled veggies which were nether grilled nor varied sufficiently .  The marinated octopus was an abomination; I love my Cephalopods and this stuff just wasn't right.  Funky, chewy - yucky!  Yes, I know I should have ordered the grilled squid - but after one bite it was too late to fix.  

Perhaps the place was suffering from a long weekend hangover - perhaps it was just the proverbial bad night... whatever it was, it will be awhile before I venture in again."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for the $15 prix-fixe lunch during Summerlicious 2011. The food was delicious and filling, to say the least. 

It was shortly before noon on a Saturday, so the restaurant was fairly empty at the time. We were seated at a table just under the roof, fully exposed to the warm summer breeze outside. The restaurant walls are dotted with a variety of knick-knacks I assume are Greek-inspired decor. 

I ordered: 
- Appetizer: meze, which the menu says are taramosalata, humus, and melitzanosalata dips served with grilled pita. 
- Main course: chicken rosemary pie, which also came with some salad greens. The pie crust was crunchy and buttery. Extremely filling.  
- Dessert: baklava, which was probably even more filling. 

My friend ordered: 
- Appetizer: mydia, which is mussels in red sauce. The sauce was a little salty.
- Main course: sfyrida me domata, a \"baked seasoned white grouper fillet topped with garden vegetables in a tomato sauce served with rice pilaf.\" The filet must have been 20cmx10cm large, so we had to share it. This dish seems to be off their current menu. 
- Dessert: chilled custard or, as they call it, Bailey's Creme Caramel. 

We were both bloated after the meal, and I would definitely say it's worth the mere $15 price tag per person. Just make sure you come with an empty stomach!"}
{"text":"I did not know about this place until I bought a deal from one of the deal sites. I made a reservation for 7pm and was seated almost immediately. The restaurant was very noisy, however, and I had to yell at the waitress for her to even hear me. There were many kids running around, which I thought made it very dangerous for the waiters since the walkways were very narrow. 

The food was very good overall, and the cocktail special was on, so I ordered a $5 casaer. I was not a big fan of the Greek yogurt that everyone on here was raving about, but my boyfriend's baklava was amazing! 

I probably won't be back again since I live uptown, and would not have visited anyways if not for the deal. But, if you live around the area and have kids, it's definitely a family-friendly restaurant that can cater to your needs."}
{"text":"calamari standard.  tzadziki very good.  baklava - worse i have ever had...  crap service - waiters are rude - will never go there again..."}
{"text":"Went here with my boyfriend for lunch, as we were craving home-made tasting Greek food as per usual. I really love the decor of the place and its relaxed atmosphere, it really does make for a pleasant dining experience. I ordered the pasticio entree, which is a Greek-style lasagna, (baked penne pasta with ground beef and bechamel sauce) and he ordered a bifteki, or meatball, atop fries. I must say, that although the pasticio was not bad, it lacked the home made taste that I am used to growing up with my Greek mother's cooking. However, anyone who has not had the privilege of tasting a proper pasticio would find the meal more than satisfying. The portion was quite large, and I liked that it came with a scrumptious, generous garden salad on the side. My boyfriend's meal was a huge grilled meatball atop a mountain of fries. I would definitely reccommend that entree for those with a hefty appetite, or eaters who may not be familiar with most of the Greek items on the menu. Meatballs and fries-you cant go wrong! The dinner came to about $34 after tax, which I found a little steep, although I may be back again :)"}
{"text":"Food - 3 star
Service - 4 star
Location - 4 star
Value - 3 star (summerlicious menu was amazing value though)
Ambience - 4 star

We went to Ouzeri for the summerlicious menu. 
For starters, I ordered Mydia (Mussels steamed in red wine sauce; which was good). Wife ordered Meze (2 dips and hummus served with pita; we didn't like this dish).

For mains, we had one Spanakopita (which we didn't like much) and Chicken Souvlaki (which was pretty good; the meat was medium done and was juicy; it was served with rice and potato)

For desserts, we had Loukumades and Baileys Creme Caramel which were both good.

We might go back. But not really in a rush."}
{"text":"Two stars because of lacklustre and uninterested service staff. I don't mind that the waiter is from Greece and doesn't speak much English but just from the very beginning they really weren't interested in getting new customers ----when we arrived there was two people standing holding up the hall on the way into the restaurant by reading the take-out menu. We waited patiently behind them for about 10 minutes to wait for some staff but nobody showed ----finally I sent my kids inside to ask if they are expecting us to seat ourselves on the patio or do we wait for staff and the waiter just waved with his hands very disinterested and said whatever. That's not a good first impression. We mentioned to the waiter after we ordered from lunch price fix ($18 for appetizer, entr√©e, and dessert, which we thought was a pretty good deal for lunch) that we read online we get 15% off for being a yelp user and he immediately said no not for price fix. When my saganaki arrived for the table to share as an appetizer I asked for bread because obviously you need to eat your flaming cheese with bread and three brown buns show up that we're hard like rocks like literally we couldn't even cut them with a knife-  we asked for more bread that's fresh and he said oh you mean white bread. The Whitebread finally arrived and no it was not as hard, it looked a lot like crappy Wonder Bread to me. The saganaki was delicious, but the mussels appetizer smelled terrible and out of 15 muscles that we got two had nothing in their shell - When seafood smells horrible usually it worries me about future food poisoning. The pasta that showed up was very small and my kids found it too oily. The desert which everybody raved about was cr√®me caramel and I agree with the writer who said she thought it was Dr. Outker-  the presentation was terrible, instead of a solid creme caramel it was falling apart into little pudding pieces. My kids didn't like the desert, and usually they like all desserts. In total I paid $35 before tip for just one lunch price fixed plus one Saganaki so I was not extremely impressed . Our waiter was obviously overworked as he was responsible for that six tables and I was busy so whenever we needed something like side plates more bread or water refills I would send my sons to the bartender who is standing around doing nothing and he would just tell them just to talk to the waiter. Who only responded after about 20 minutes for what we would ask for-  Plus when I asked for more side plates as we were all sharing food he would say I don't understand you have side plates. Meanwhile they were filthy and covered in empty muscle cells. I shouldn't have to explain why I want more plates, it makes more sense to eat off the clean plate. Also the service was very slow and it was not just us I heard many tables near us trying to cancel their entr√©e because it was taking too long, being told that the food was literally on its way and then still waiting another 15 minutes. Very frustrating. I don't know how this place has stayed alive so long."}
{"text":"you cant beat Ouzeri for quantity and price. A girlfriend and I went for lunch and decided to both do the $15 prix fix lunch. We shared everything. the portions were plentiful. We had Greek salad-chicken souvlaki- baileys tart and meze platter(huge)-spanakopita(fab)-  loukoumades(really sweet)

The food was really good and the quantities were huge"}
{"text":"I was here last night for dinner and I will say the food was pretty good. We ate the gigantes, tirosalata dip, saganaki and lamb souvlaki dinner. Everything was delicious. The service was ok for a night that wasn't busy at all. What is making me review this as 3 stars was because of what happened when we got the bill. The waiter took our money and didn't return with any change. At any restaurant that doesn't sit well with me because you should always say you will be back with the customers change and let them leave the tip they want without expecting the whole amount was for you. With all the restaurants on the Danforth I probably won't return again."}
{"text":"Came with our Travelzoo voucher.

Would be 5 stars, except the service was lacking this time around.  We didn't even get bread.  First time wasn't busy and the food & service were great.  This time, visiting on a Saturday night... oh boy...  We'd definitely go again, but on an off-peak night.

Grilled octopus appetizer: Mmmmm....  Perfect on texture, and great flavouring.  Yes, it's as simple as lemon juice and olive oil, but fantastic.

Pastitsio: It's baked penne with meat, topped with cheese.  Can't go wrong.  Delicious.

Rosemary pie with lamb: Sooo glad we chose the lamb.  Fantastic.

The pastitsio & rosemary pie each came with their own side salads, so there was enough food to go around."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday for lunch and it was pretty quiet inside.  Ordered the fixed price menu as well as a chicken souvlaki and fries.  

In the fixed price menu, for apps, got the mussels in a tomato sauce, and it was perfectly seasoned with a generous portion.  Got grilled calamari as a main, again generous portions and positively delicious calamari, and baklava as a dessert.  

The chicken souvlaki had lots of tzikiki which was delicious and a generous portion of fries that were perfectly seasoned.  

My boyfriend and I were really blown away by everything and the service was attentive and quick.  We'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Rarely around the Danforth area, I was happy to eat here for my company Christmas lunch. We got the restaurant's holiday lunch fixe for $18 per person. Because of this, I got to try three appetizers, one entree, and four desserts!

The appetizers included Gigantes (lima beans baked with herbs and tomatoes), Meze (grilled pita with assorted dips), and Mydia (mussels steamed in red wine).

First served was the mussels. Although the mussels were not too big, the Mediterranean sauce made the dish very tasty. As I'm not a big bean fan, the lima bean dish was alright - it had its uniqueness and texture somewhat like mashed potatoes. The pita, however, was delicious especially with hummus and chickpea dips!

I had the Kalamari (calamari) as my entree. It was pretty good combined with rice and potatoes. Some may find the potatoes towards the salty end but I actually loved it - doesn't seem plain and baked. The calamari was plentiful accompanied by tartar sauce tinted with lemon juice. It wasn't the crispy type but it was cooked well enough with a chewy texture.

Their desserts were quite sweet but I was too full to appreciate all. I had some bites of their baklava which was made nicely - crisp and layered. I also tried their honey fritters and greek yogurt. Those were not bad but again, too full to devour.

Overall, the restaurant service and atmosphere was nice. The food was yummy especially being lucky enough to try so many dishes!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! My boyfriend and I go at least once a week!!! Service = AMAZING!! Food = FRESH & DELICIOUS!!!"}
{"text":"The Danforth is a continuously evolving area from cheap to fine dinning. You can find Thai, Indian, fast food and cheap or high end Greek. The Danforth is always changing, except for a select few that seemed to have found their niche on the Danforth.  Ouzeri is one of those places that has founds its sweet spot. Try the Rosemary Lamb or chicken pie,  this is my favourite and a signature dish for Ouzeri, they seem to have perfected this and a few other dishes. Always right on!  This is also their offering for the festival Taste of The Danforth."}
{"text":"Amazing service and amazing food! The lamb chops were the best I've ever had. We came here twice while visiting the greater Toronto area."}
{"text":"Everyone has their favourite place ont he Danforth, and this is mine.   We normally order a series of meze.  Definitely a place where you can think outside the box a bit: the grilled octopus is deliciously tender with a nice sear on the outside.  I also like the quail.  Some very nice Greek wines; we always go for the Assyrtiko.

I wish that they had Greek coffee so one could top off the meal in style!  But they do have nice espresso.  Also, I'm sad they took the bakaliaro (salt cod) off the menu; it was delicious.

If you want dessert: the baklava may be better elsewhere, but the creme caramel is quite good.  

Oh, last, but not least: the dips are truly delicious."}
{"text":"The food here was incredible but it was hard to find seating for a large group and was quite expensive after drinks and tax was included. The staff was very friendly and it was good service. The portion size was a good amount for the price and there was a wide variety of selection."}
{"text":"I don't get it...did we just go on a bad day?
Service- what service? Like we were even there.
Food- cold! yes, really...and we were sitting right beside the kitchen- ridiculous.  My husbands pork slouvaki was dry to the bone. Would have been better off going to the Friendly Greek or a cheap place with better food.
Atmosphere- Beautiful"}
{"text":"My sister and I had an itch to scratch...an itch for some great Greek, that is. After my sister put in countless hours poring through reviews on Yelp, we finally settled on lunch at Ouzeri. After reading all the rave reviews, we couldn't help but have high expectations.

We hurried to make our reservation, but upon entering an almost empty restaurant a little past noon, we realized there had been no need to rush. A disinterested looking server, who appeared to be the only one working, eventually drifted over to seat us and present us with menus. We had decided beforehand that we were going to order off the $15 lunch prix-fixe menu, but our quick decision making was not rewarded by quick order taking. 

Once our orders were finally taken, it then took another 20 minutes (*warning: hyperbole alert*) for the server to punch it into the computer, and then another 10 for him to bring us our water, then another 10 to bring us a basket of (cold, dry, uninteresting) bread. Meanwhile, I killed time by gazing over at what the kitchen staff were doing. To my horror, I watched my Greek salad be assembled and dressed before my sister's hot appetizer was even fired. When we received our appetizers, mine was predictably soggy, not only from sitting around but also from being drenched in oily, flavourless dressing. The iceberg lettuce looked sad and brown, the tomatoes, in contrast, were freakishly red, the cucumbers were chopped in large, uneven portions, the feta was surprisingly bland, and the two kalamata olives dropped on top just looked lifeless. 

After being thoroughly disappointed with our appetizers, we waited some more for our mains. We filled our time by imagining the comments we would write in our Yelp reviews and watching our server shuffle around incredibly slowly. Once our mains finally arrived, there was a bit of redemption. My chicken souvlaki was a lot more \"appetizing\" than my appetizer (hehe), and all in all I would say it was worth breaking my vegetarian streak for (especially given that my sister was displeased with her vegetarian moussaka). The rice pilaf was tender and delicious, and the tzatziki was tasty and served in a generous portion, but we both found the potatoes a bit too tangy. 

I was already pretty stuffed at this point and couldn't finish my main, especially since dessert was included as part of the prix-fixe. At least I can say that the value is there. I had ordered the Baileys creme caramel for the grand finale, but there was very little that was Baileys about it. In fact, I have a sneaking suspicion is was one of those Dr. Oetker's prepared packages of creme caramel, or just a clone in both taste and appearance. The lackluster food, coupled with the slow and disinterested service, left a lot to be desired. Perhaps the head chef was off when we went? Either way, the itch remains unscratched..."}
{"text":"People, please. Notice how all the good reviews are from the \"Elite\"?

Unfortunately this place is crap. I loved our waiter but the food was just too terrible to rate any higher than a 2. I had the regular salad with chicken souvlaki and she had the moussaka. Mine was WAY overcooked and tough as leather. Hers was undercooked and still very cold (frozen?) in the middle. Sent it back. Waiter seemed ashamed of the food altogether. 

Oh well. Next!"}
{"text":"This place is actually huge, definitely noisy, but the energy is great. Staff is friendly and efficient even when the place is packed. My Beef Martini (a house specialty, kind of a beef stew) was really good, and so were the entr√©e (assorted Greek dips) and dessert (salty-yummy Greek yoghourt with almonds and honey).

Good wine list, fair prices. Happy place. Will return :)"}
{"text":"The food was incredibly delicious, but service ruined the experience, it was by far the worst we had in the whole city. The guy was completely unfriendly, with no smile or a nice word."}
{"text":"First time dining here for lunch and what a fantastic experience!  I would highly recommend the prix fixe menu as portions were very generous and the taste was delectable!  I ordered mydia (mussels in red wine sauce) for the appetizer and was so impressed with the taste and portion size...could have easily passed for an entr√©e!  Also shared my husband's meze (grilled pita with three dips) and a very tasty sampler as well.  Had solomo domata feta (herbed salmon) as the entr√©e, can never complain with salmon.  Delicious, healthy and filling.  Dessert was Bailey's cr√®me caramel, a great way to top off the lunch.  For $25, this was perhaps the best prix fixe I've ever tasted and that's saying a lot in terms of taste and value.  Although it's really out of our way to dine here, I will definitely make it a point to patronize this restaurant whenever I can.  Lovely ambiance and very responsive service.  Well done!"}
{"text":"I like!! 
It was smart of us to go on a Tuesday because I hear this place is packed on Thursdays, and weekends. 
I had the eggplant mousaka because thats my favourite greek meal and it was yumm and each meal comes with a small greek salad beforehand which is a surprise and it was yummers. The dishes come with a side of white rice, too. 

Other had the \"real\" mousaka (meaning with beef) and I had a taste of that too, was quite good but I did prefer the veggie one. 

The waiter was kind of cute, too and I was treated to the meal by a friend so that made it that much more enjoyable :)

Definitely want to go back."}
{"text":"Wow. Just wow. How do you give restaurants a 0 rating on this thing. We haven't been here for a while because the food was so bad. But we thought that we would give it another try. Well the food was awesome. Service and attitude? HORRIBLE!!  They forgot my fianc√©'s chicken on her chicken salad. When we asked if we could have it, the lady said that she wasn't a waitress (apparently she only seats people - really?!!). I asked if she could get our server (who was seriously distracted) and she WALKED AWAY WITH AN ATTITUDE!!!!
So, we won't be going back there again!!! $0 tip for you guys!!!"}
{"text":"Ouzeri

A solid OmNom!  A SOLID Winterlicious lunch menu.  I've stopped going to Winterlicious pretty much because most restaurants really alter their menu and the service is just plain awful.  Why lure people in there only to give them something they're not expecting?  

Ouzeri on the other hand was fantastic.  We did go off hours at 3pm for their lunch prix fix so not sure how they handle a regular service.  The Meze dip sampler was awesome.  Two Pita breads with enough dip that after I shared there was still enough for another two pitas!

I couldn't resist the grilled Kalamari even though the Lamb Pie sounded awesome.  It was cooked to perfection and couldn't ask for more.

I was going to get the custard for desert but got talked in to the Greek Yogurt.  It was nice, but a bit too tart for me however everyone else enjoyed it.  It was super thick, and the honey nutty yummy goodness that went with it was awesome.

Looking forward to going back soon."}
{"text":"I am a Greek, my father was born in Filiatra, and I was BLOWN away by this place. The avgolemono soup was just like my father's, thick but light, lemony and filled with delicious rice and celery! The lamb chops were cooked and seasoned to perfection. The octopus was served charred but tender and packed with flavor. There was a sweet pepper relish on the side that had a truly unique flavor. The Lemon potatos and the tzatziki were some of the best I've ever had. I absolutely loved this place and I HIGHLY recommend you bring your business here. It's the best on Danforth."}
{"text":"Summerlicious Round 4!  I've been wanting to go to Ouzeri since summerlicious last year, so I was really excited when my dining group decided to go there for dinner.  The location is pretty good, not a far walk from Chester station, and the d√©cor was nice - nothing special in my mind.  

I think between the six of us, we ordered just about everything on the menu - and nothing really impressed me THAT much.  It was all good, but not amazing.  The best part of the meal for me was the mussels.  It's pretty hard to go wrong with mussels, but when they're in a yummy tomato based sauce (albeit a little overly salty) and there's warm bread on the table for dunking, I get excited.  It was the highlight of my meal for sure.  The spanakopita and the meze looked just okay to me, although both were very generous.  

For mains, I ordered the chicken rosemary pie.  I was disappointed.  Maybe I ordered the wrong thing, but I figured I'd try something besides souvlaki since that's what I always get at Greek take out places.  The chicken was pretty dry, and the flavours fell flat.  It was, again, a large portion and I couldn't finish it after having so much bread with my app.  The salmon looked delicious, although two of the three that were ordered weren't cooked all the way through and had to be sent back to be reheated.  The Patitsio looked like a mac and cheese sort of dish, and my friend didn't seem overly impressed with it.  Ironically for me, the souvlaki looked the best and was served with a TON of tzatziki - my favourite part!!  

The desserts were pretty good, I'll admit.  I tried all of them, and I definitely think I ordered the best option - the Greek yogurt.  It wasn't what I was expecting, but was really tasty.  The baklava, a favourite of mine, wasn't the best I've had.  I'm picky about what types of nuts are used.  The Bailey's cr√®me caramel did not go over well.  The girl who ordered it thought it tasted like egg.  The loukoumades were pretty good though.  

All in all, this is stereotypical summerlicious in my mind - some hits, some misses."}
{"text":"***1/2 stars

Ouzeri is one of the landmark restaurants located on the Danforth, otherwise known as Greektown.  Its $25 prix-fixe menu is no doubt a big bonus, although upon leaving dinner and walking along the strip, I noticed many other restaurants had the same type of promotion!

The decor is typical of any Greek restaurant, although I did like the dim lighting, and two-tiered seating arrangements.  My favourite would've been the ornate candle holder which illuminated an iron-like nook in the wall.  Well enough about the decor already... how was the food?

Adding to the bonus of a $25 prix-fixe menu was my voucher which would entitle me to 2 prix-fixe meals for the price of one.  What what?!  But what's a good Friday night without a glass of wine, or two?  Those of you who know me know that I am not a fan of red wine with its tannins and all, so I opted for a glass of the E.J. Gallo White Zinfandel and my dining companion (DC) ordered a glass of the Kouros Nemea which is supposed to be a lighter red wine.  I had a sip, and it didn't leave that dried-out feeling in your mouth (you know,  the same one you get after drinking a cup of Orange Pekoe?)To my surprise, my DC had never tried Saganaki... And being the cheese lover that I am, I just had to order it!  It was like eating a pizza minus the empty carb-laden crust... The cheese itself was nicely crusted, and was served with their ever-so-flaky dinner rolls which were pillow-y soft on the inside.  Yummy!                    

Appetizers consisted of Mussels steamed with garden veggies, fresh herbs and garlic and dowsed in a Mediterranean red sauce - which is especially good for dipping if you have any of the dinner rolls left over!  The Spanakopita was equally yummy, though I found the filling to be a bit on the cold side. 

For mains I ordered a feta and sundried tomato crusted salmon.  I have had a lot of bad experiences with salmon at restaurants (e.g. they overcook the salmon and its dry) but Ouzeri has renewed my confidence in putting salmon back on my list of orderables!  It was served with horta (wilted greens with lemon and olive oil), which, would give any child the right not to eat their vegetables as the greens were bitter.  The rice was delicious, no doubt infused with a broth of sorts.   

My dining companion opted for the Spatstisio which was baked in a bechamel sauce and layered with spiced ground beef.  The pasta was velvety smooth, and the Ouzeri mixed greens salad was equally delectable. 

For dessert we ordered the Loukamades and the Yiaourti.  The Loukamades were disappointing and I didn't quite enjoy the texture nor the taste of it.  I cannot put into words what it was, but the syrup tasted \"funny.\"  The pressed greek yogurt topped with figs and honey however, OPA!!!  I may just give up ice cream because of this!  The greek yogurt was extremely creamy and dense.  Being plain yogurt, it was a bit sour, but that's where the figs and honey go to work.  I am so glad I ordered this.  I haven't had a good dessert in a long time, and lest you underestimate the power of simple ingredients - lesson learned.

Verdict:

I enjoyed my experience at Ouzeri.  Although service is a bit lacklustre, the food makes up for it.  I cannot wait to come back to try more of the savoury foods that Ouzeri has to offer, not to mention ample portion sizes.  The ambiance is great, and I would definitely recommend it if you're looking for a place to eat on a Friday night."}

En tout cas, je le recommande fortement, √ßa vaut la peine d'essayer ce resto!"}
{"text":"This was my second time at Ouzeri, this time for my bff's birthday celebration. It was mad packed when we arrived, but we still managed to get a table for 5 without waiting. Our friends and I decided to share three apps! They were the grilled calamari, grilled octopus and mussels covered in tomato sauce. The apps all came in a big portion that we quickly devoured it all. Everything was delicious, but some parts of the grilled octopus were a bit burnt imo but still good.

For the main, I ordered the moussaka which is a casserole layered with eggplant, ground beef and a bechamel (?) Sauce. It came with a side of Greek salad as well. Loved the moussaka, it was my first time having it and because there was eggplant, I loved it even more. Unfortunately, I couldn't even finish half of the meal because i had eaten way too much of the apps before, I had to take mine home. As for service, we had a great server who patiently answered our questions and responded to our requests, came to check up on us from time to time.

I would def. Recommend this place, although there's no AC inside there's only a fan. Try sitting out on the patio if you can though!"}
{"text":"THis place is great.  My friends and I were on a trip to Niagara and couldn't pass up an opportunity to see TO.  Being Greek we made our way to Greektown and combed the streets looking for a place to eat...we found Ouzeri.  The food was AMAZING!  After eating the crap surrounding Niagara we were in heaven.  Authentic, exciting and just plain good Greek food!  I could totally move here (okay not to the actual restaurant but to TO) if this is the kind of good I can expect.  Dolmades were excellent as was the Avgolemono Soup.  Great beefteki and mousaka.  COME HERE!"}
{"text":"Really tasty Saganaki and Spanakopita. The owner came and spoke for a bit with my friends and me and served us the Saganaki.
Easy to reach because it is located between Mont royal and Laurier metro stops, and affordable. My favourite Greek place in Montreal"}
{"text":"We wandered into this place looking for a decent Greek place for lunch. The lamb kabobs were flavorful and tender. The rosemary chicken baked in phyllo was a bit on the greasy side but had tremendous rosemary flavor. The meatball appetizers were good, as were the simple salads accompanying the meal. Portion sizes were generous and the service was prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"Came here last night for dinner with a friend and her colleagues. It was a warm Friday night and the place was p a c k e d !!

The bread that came out before our meal was delish. I usual avoid the bread before meals, but I'm glad that I had one. I had their grilled calamari appetizer as my main. It was f a n t a b u l o u s ! I'm coming here when I'm jonesing some grilled squid.

My experience last night totally upped this place from a 3-star to a 4-star in my books ~"}
{"text":"Ate here last night and was absolutely delighted with the food. 

First of all, the reason we came was to satisfy my darling girlfriend's and my need for Saganaki - cheese flamb√©e. We were a little worried when the flames kissed the ceiling, but once that crispy cheese hit our tongues we immediately forgot the fact half the restaurant was on fire. 

After that, we had the tri-sampler of dips, which was a better value than the two separate dips we were planning on (before the waitress kindly tipped us off). The Taramasalata (caviar-based) was so good, my mom bought some to take home with her.

Finally the mains - I tried the Garides Skaras (Giant Shrimp) and Kalamari (Grilled Squid) dinners, as well as the Vegetarian Mousaka (Eggplant-based Greek Lasagna/Casserole). They were all substantial and delicious portions. 

My only complaint is that two children at the table next to us were staring at us for a long percentage of our meal. I would love to know what was going on in their heads, I can only hope it was some variation on wondering what we looked like as dinosaurs. I hope I was some sort of T-Rex or Allosaurus/Human hybrid. But I'm sure with my luck, I'm sure they were imagining me as an Ichtyasaurus. Weeeeeak, yo. Those kids be trippin'."}
{"text":"The Grilled Kalamari was great!  Cooked to perfection and the portion size was impressive for the price.  I'm a big fan of kalamari and cannot stand it if it's over cooked.  These guys know how to make it!  The Saganaki was good and i'd definitely recommend it to anyone.  Our table really liked the dips.  The slavaki was ok, not the best in the city but not bad.  Great taziki sauce.  
Bathroom and restaurant area were clean.  The service was good.  It wasn't too busy when we went.  Great for a date or double date.  
I'm only giving this place a 3* but it should be 3.5 star.  It was good, but not mind blowing that I must come back.  Not sure if I'd come back as there are so many other greek places nearby to try out."}
{"text":"I felt this place is way too overpriced and their food is okay. Came here with my friend, and we both ordered the prix fixe menu. Their meat was a bit too dry for my liking and there was an extra charge for salad/veggies instead of rice and potatoes? How does that make sense at all. The prix fixe was $25 and with an extra charge for replacing food for salad that would be over $30 before tax. Will not be coming back, with so many other choices on the Danforth I would try somewhere else. Their food is nothing to rave about, disappointed after coming here with all of the raving reviews on Yelp."}
{"text":"The food's great - it's too bad the service is awful. Both times I've been to Ouzeri the service is perfunctory and joyless. I hate feeling like I'm being a giant pain in the ass by asking for water, or... y'know... ordering my entree. I realize that it gets really busy in there, but there are plenty of busy restaurants where the hosts and servers are swamped, but at least they put forth the appearance that they're having no less than a pretty decent day.

Anyway, the entrees are pretty damn good. The greek salad is fresh; the grouper with cream sauce was tender and delicious. My husband's rack of lamb was tender and perfectly medium-rare. Even the specialty cocktails are great. 

I'm torn as to whether I'd come back. The food's great and the prices are really reasonable, but... based on the service I've gotten there so far, I'm pretty sure my money is better spent elsewhere."}
{"text":"Came here twice. first time was really good with summerlicious - lamb pie and calamari were both awesome. second time I came during taste of danforth - waay too crowded, service was sub-par and food was not all that either :("}
{"text":"I recommended this place to a friend based off the reviews here. We went with her kids and to be honest I was a tad disappointed. The bread was old and dry (one of the kids actually even refused to eat it), we took a mix of 3 entr√©es which for some reason I thought will be hot but they were cold, and the menu wasn't kid-friendly. The manager though (at least I think we was) was super friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Calamari is excellent. Moussaka could use a bit of work but on the whole a really nice experience. friendly staff and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Impressive place and simple choices. The ambience was calming and the food was not only authentic but delicious and cooked to perfection! The menu selection was simple and the wine list was impressive. I will definitely come back. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Hit their patio yesterday for a $15 Summerlicious treat!  There were 3 of us and we ate well.

I had the bean dip appetizer while my two table mates ordered the steamed mussels.  The dip was delicious, but I have to admit that the waft of dill made  me just a teensy weensy bit jealous that I to had not ordered the mussels.  My friends assure me that the mussels were divine.

Main courses?  I ordered the fried calamari with rice pilaf and their infamous potatoes - Lauren M had the spanakopita and Nicola ordered the grouper.  All three plates were well portioned and tasty!  The grouper looked absolutely divine.  

Now onto dessert!  Though two of us didn't actually finish our mains (perhaps it was the heat bearing down on us as we sat on their sidewalk patio), we vowed that dessert would not suffer the same fate.  Lauren ordered the Loukomedes, Nicola had the Yaourti drizzeled with honey, nuts and figs, while I stuck with my favourite - baklava!  All three were delicious and despite feeling immensely full from the previous 2 courses, we all finished our desserts.

I must say that this was a spectacular meal for $15.  

My only negative comment was that the service was mediocre.  Our individual appetizers arrived between 5-10 apart, however the mains were all served at the same time.  For dessert my friend Nicola was served the wrong dessert, but the bonus part is the server let us keep it and didn't charge us.  It was a creme caramel, and nothing spectacular when compared to the loukoumedes, baklava and yaourti."}
{"text":"I like the food there except the lamb chops was chewy and more like goat chops! Other than that food was great my hubby ordered the grilled shrimp which I ate most of that it was A M A Z I N G! Tiziki was the best I ever had! Yum"}
{"text":"To start our meal we shared the 3 dip combination. The skordalia was excellent, the tarama salada good, and the roasted red pepper and feta excellent. However the portions on the combo do not equate to these dips served on a stand alone basis. So the 'savings' were not there.

The salad that came with the main course were horrible. This lost this restaurant 1/2 star. The lettuce was sitting around for long time and the flavor was just not there. In addition the feta was crumbled a bit too much.

I had, as a main course Al's Lamb which are lamb skewers taken from the leg accompanied with roasted potatoes and rice with the feta and pepper dip. Unlike other reviewers, I found the potatoes very small making a skimpy but ok tasting side. The lamb did not disappoint at all it was medium rare and totally delicious.

My wife had the 2 chicken breasts which were tasty, with the same accompaniments. 

For dessert she had a baklava which was very good, and I had a Yogurt with fig compote, walnuts and cinnamon.

We did use a Groupon Now coupons which was gracefully accepted. As a small additional points the tables were clean but 'sticky' and they are granite....I guess the were not clean enough....

I will return but they have to be have to improve a few things particularly the side salads, the sides and cleanliness of the table."}
{"text":"I've been to Ouzeri about 4 times. I've never been disappointed. That being said I've not been blown away either. I would have preferred to rate it 3.5 stars but we can't. 

The service is always friendly. No complaints. I enjoy their meze plate. 

Don't be shy to give it a try!"}
{"text":"Average. Expected. No creativity. 

Same food and recipes as many other Greek restaurants on Danforth. 

The waiter was very charming. Nice patio."}
{"text":"First, I would like to say I absolutely love Toronto and Danforth.

I went to Ouzeri for my cousin's wedding reception and it was perfect!

They had a long table reserved for all of us and we ate like one big happy loud Greek family. 

I think we had a bit of everything from the menu. All three dips: humous, tzatziki, melitzanosalata with pita bread. Octopodi toursi, saganaki, kalamari, gigantes, octopodi skaras, etc.

Our service was quick, consistent, and friendly. Wine was flowing. It was truly a lovely meal. Overall great dining experience for me.

Opa!"}
{"text":"Ever wonder how so many Greek restaurants all lined up on the same street in the same neighborhood can survive? Probably because they all serve very good food. The Winterlicious menu is a steal. I usually spend more than $25 on dinner at these Greek restaurants (not including booze) so having the option to do this is fantastic.

The Sfyrida Moustardolemono was fantastic. I love how the Greeks cook their fish. I was never a big fan of fish until I tried the Greek fish. A nice decent sized Grouper with lemon sauce and topped with shrimp. That alone I would pay $25 for. But now I also get to throw in the three dipping sauces as an appetizer and Greek yogurt for desert???? No way. Absolutely fantastic. The fish alone made the meal."}
{"text":"I was here the other night with 2 gf's.  MAKE A RESERVATION.  This place is BUSY!
The food was good.  We ordered some apps to share and wine.

The calamari was good, and we had some meatballs, we ordered some delicious dips.  
YUM YUM."}
{"text":"Came here for summerlicious yesterday with my boyfriend it was also my birthday.
The place is very nice with a nice bar area. Our waiter was attentive and friendly. 

For apps we had the Avgolemono soupa and the Meza. The soup was amazing and the dips were very good as well. We also ordered calamari as an app. and it was delicious. 

For mains we had the Souvlaki. I had chicken and my boyfriend had pork. very generous sizes with options to change your sides! I had the salad and my boyfriend as the rice and fries. We both enjoyed our meals minus the rice which wasn't very good. 

For dessert I had the baklava and my boyfriend had the Loukoumades. the Loukomades were a little stale/dry but the baklava was amazing! The waiter was so sweet and put a candle in the baklava and brought it out so I could blow it out because it was my birthday!

Very nice date place and definitely a family friendly restaurant as well. Warm and inviting and I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Indifferent oversalted chicken Rosemary pie, terrible soggy overdressed salad. 

Nice staff though."}
{"text":"Try that slavoki lamb. Seriously, give it a try. It's juicy, tender, deliciousness. The dinner comes with taziki sauce and you must not forget to drizzle some of that lemon on top of your sliced lamb before dunking that bad boy in the sauce! Yummy. I was almost worried that I'd leave this place feeling disappointed in my fellow yelpers. 

The potatoes that came with it however, were too salty for my taste. My boyfriend apparently liked it.. Well, if you smoked for 17 years, you'd probably like them too. 

For appetizers, we tried the mussels tonight. They were nothing special to be honest. Perhaps I'm bias since I am not a big fan of mussels in general. (I've just never been blown away!)

We also got complimentary bread at the start of our meal and it was not impressive. The bread was cold.. Maybe it was meant to be. I don't know. I personally like my bread hot and soft. Im more convinced it just came out of the oven this way. This one served to us cold and hard. 

Ouzeri,
You're only getting 2 stars from me because I love your lamb. Your gin and tonic, bread, potatoes, greek salad, rice and mussels did not meet my expectations. 

I will come back just for you though, you sweet, juicy hearty lamb."}
{"text":"Came here for winterlicous for the $15 lunch

my and the buddy got

artichokes/meze (dips and pita)

fried kalamari/mousaka (sort of like shepherds pie but with eggplant and zucchini)

and for dessert the Greek yogurt and the creme caramel

most other reviews are right on track. I liked everything however the creme caramel tasted (and probably was) the same as something you could get in a grocery store.

My personal discovery of the visit was the mousaka, its like Sheppard's pie but with zucchini and eggplant instead of potatoes.

Usually I hate boring-ass Sheppard's pie (potatoes, peas and meat? blah) but the mousaka was great


Overall the food was good and I would eat here again for Greek food."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends for a 1pm Summerlicious lunch and we all enjoyed our meals overall.  Ouzeri was very accommodating in finding room for our party of 10.  Also a friend brought her dog and they allowed her to eat in the patio with the dog next to her.

For the appetizer I was able to try the GIGANTES, MYDIA, and MEZE.  All three were good.  I am more of seafood fan so prefer the MYDIA the most.  There were plenty of mussels and the broth that came with it was very flavourful.  I'd recommend dipping the complimentary bread rolls in the broth to balance the flavours.

For main course  I was able to try CHICKEN ROSEMARY PIE, CHICKEN SOUVLAKI, KALAMARI. The CHICKEN ROSEMARY PIE was crispy and had some nice flavours but to eat it with rice and potatoes is too much starch for me.  The CHICKEN SOUVLAKI was moist and had a nice grill taste to it.  My favourite was the KALAMARI which weren't overly battered and was crispy with some nice spices added to it.  They also were very generous with the amount of KALAMARI.  

For dessert I was able to try all 4 desserts HOMEMADE BAKLAVA, BAILEY'S CR√àME CARAMEL, YIAOURTI, and LOUKOUMADES.  Most of my friends and I said the desserts were too sweet.  I'd recommend going with the BAILEY'S CR√àME CARAMEL.

I've been here before and I would be interested in coming here again.  Quality seems to be same as before.  Would have giving this meal 5 stars but we all including our two patio friends were auto charged 18% for gratuities."}
{"text":"The food is good but mediocre - if you don't know good greek food, this may pass."}
{"text":"Ouzeri is one of the few best Greek restaurants on the Danforth.  Only Mezes, Pantheon and Pan come close to the quality.  It is very clean restaurant and has a nice patio outside.  The service is informal but friendly.

I had the Fasoulades soup, since I love beans, and it did not dissapoint - it was amazing, and the $2 extra for feta and olives was worth it, big chunk of Feta inside.  

The Moussaka was also very good, but the topping was not the best I've had, a bit bland tasting and the texture too soft.

My friend had the Taramosalata (awesome!) and the meatballs with tomato sauce (good, but I've had better)."}
{"text":"Good food. Best baklava tasted so far in all Greek restaurants I've visited in Toronto."}
{"text":"We discovered this restaurant by chance,  while walking down St. Denise.  It was one of the best experiences we had in Montreal! They served us a delicious side of meatballs and bread right after seating down. The service was really fast and easy-going.  We ordered the grilled calamari  and octopus.  They were delicious! The manager also greeted us and offered us ouzo! He was really nice and warm! Another  table was celebrating a birthday and he  broke a plate in their honor,  Greek style! We will definitely return once we come back to Montreal! Hopefully soon:)"}
{"text":"A group of 4 of us went to Ouzeri last night; I hadn't been since I was a kid and our friends wanted to try out a place they hadn't been to before. We were pleasantly surprised to find that Ouzeri was participating in Winterlicious. We were there around 8pm and luckily seated right away, even though we didn't have a reservation. The place was packed and loud. Their decor is classy, which makes you think it is a high-class establishment, but the food (at least what we ordered) is the same as most other Greek restaurants I've been to. Everything in there is really tight; the front entrance, the space between the tables and even the washroom stalls, I had to press myself up against the toilet in order to open and close the door. I didn't see a baby change table anywhere. The spanakopita, taramosalata and humous appetizers were good, but the gigantes (lima beans) were bland. The main fried calamari dish came without sauce but the portion was generous. The pork souvlaki and chicken souvlaki portions (that came with potatoes and rice but no salad) were also quite large. The Pastitsio (baked pasta) was nothing to write home about. The baklava was too hard (it came with a steak knife!) but the creme caramel was very tasty. The service was efficient, though not not the most friendly, and the server didn't want to split our bill for us. If you can get a table upstairs it is preferable. I would only go back to this restaurant during a promotional time."}
{"text":"Ouzeri is a lovely Greek restaurant with very reasonable prices and friendly service.  The prix fixe menu is a great deal for $25/dinner with 3 courses.  The portions are just about perfect, although I was very full at the end of the meal. The baklava was particularly delicious!  I would definitely return to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"We tried out Ouzeri's Summerlicious menu at lunch today.

Great value for the $15 price tag!

There were 4 options for each appetizer, main and dessert.

We had the Gigantes and the Mezes plate with pita.  Boy! These were big appetizers!  The Gigante were ok -- it was not that they were not a great dish -- but I tried just for something new and it wasn't so much to my taste.  However my hubby and I shared the appetizers and his Mezes plate was great -- very generous and easily could feed too -- the hummous was my fav - with nice warm pita -- Yum!

For the main, my hubby had the calamari (came with tzatziki, potatoes and rice), and I had the pork souvlaki (with the same) --- again both with generous portions , we shared and in essence had Greek \"Surf and Turf\".

We were starting to feel quite full after this, but had the Baklava and the Yogurt with figs, honey and nuts.  I really enjoyed the Yogurt but had a bite of my hubby's Baklava and frankly it was the right pick....Yum -- moist - great filling and was great.

So - well worth a visit -- Opa!!!"}
{"text":"Have been a few times before (years ago) and really liked them - they had AMAZING bread - so I chose Ouzeri as the locale for my celebration dinner. Mistake. Food was OK (but they must have changed their bread :(). Service was AWFUL. Our server forgot to punch in my boyfriend's meal so while the entire table had their meals, we had to wait for his. The server seemed like he didn't care at all to be there and when he brought the bill, my father was shocked to see my boyfriend's meal still on the bill. He asked about it and the server said \"yes, but I apologized\" Highly unprofessional, and my boyfriend, being a server himself thought it was ridiculous that he wouldn't even offer to comp it. He did bring us a small slice of baklava (for the 7 of us to share :|) and some coffee but only AFTER we said something about his mistake. Sad to say I'm not going back to Ouzeri. If I want a lovely Greek meal from now on, I'll go to Christina's or Pan. So very disappointed."}
{"text":"They had one of those Groupon Now deals going on tonight ($15 for $30), so I had to check it out. 

As I was dining alone and needed to spend $30, I ordered an appetizer along with the meal. I got the Scallops Kaseri, and it was fine but not great. The scallops were a bit overdone and the ratio of vegetables to scallops was disappointing.

At this point I wasn't really expecting much from the entree, and I was very pleasantly surprised. I got the Makaronada Thalasino with a mix of the tomato sauce and cream sauce, and it was absolutely fantastic. Seriously. Best pasta sauce I've ever had, and the portion was quite large. I'm practically drooling right now just thinking about this dish. I am fairly certain it was simmered with a crack rock or two in the pot.

I do have to note that it took almost an hour after I finished my meal to get the bill because the poor server was running around like crazy between too many tables. This didn't bother me too much because I had a book to read and I've been in her position. When I showed her my mobile Groupon she had to take my phone (my week-old iPhone 5) with her to scan the barcode, which made me very nervous. Overall, though, I was really happy with the experience and would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place did not sit well with my stomach. We got the spinach and feta pie (normally would be my favourite), lamb pie, lamb chops and aged steak. The best was probably the steak but even that I could probably make something better myself (and I'm not even that great of a cook). The lamb chops were super thin and overly done. I'm not too sure which one of the items I ate that caused my stomach to turn shortly after leaving the restaurant, but whatever it was, it was not pretty. 

The service also was not very friendly. Honestly for the price you pay, I'd expect to see a smile or some sort of acknowledgement that you're a customer would have been nice. 

I won't be coming back to this place again."}
{"text":"Love this place! Get the price fix menu. I had the mussels to start, pork souvlaki and then creme caramel. I have had Greek food in Toronto but this place is by far one of the best. Although empty on a Monday do not be deceived, it is well worth checking out. I didn't try the Greek wines but I will surely try then next time. This place only loses one star bc it was chilly in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Had dinner with friends here the other night.  Food was very good and it was nice to have the live entertainment.  Waiter was not attentive and made a mistake with one of our orders and it took some convincing that he had made an error."}
{"text":"I came here for one of the Summerlicious.

My table got artichokes lemonato, fasolada, mousaka, lamb rosemary pie, kalamari skaras, homemade baklava and Bailey's cr√®me caramel. I don't have much experience with Greek food but I did enjoy my meal here. The service was nice here, the portions were nice, the food was not too salty and although the baklava was very sweet (like most baklava), it tasted great.

I would come here for a nice sit down Greek restaurant but if I was really craving Greek food, I would be satisfied with just Jimmy the Greek fast food."}
{"text":"Came here last night for my friends bday celebration. It was packed on the Danforth and we've had a good experience here before, so we decided to give this restaurant another shot. Our server was super nice and came by often to check on us. Even made a joke that we ordered too much food. 

The atmosphere is busy. Crazy kitchen, people running around. But it was HOT when we got there. As my friend mentioned in her Yelp review, don't think there was any AC on. The patio would have been nice. 

We ordered 4 apps, Greek fries, grilled calamari, grilled octopus and mussels. I would have to say my favourite was the mussels. We got the one in the tomato sauce and it was big, and also flavourful. The octopus was my second fave, but some pieces were a bit over charred for my liking. The third is Greek fries, can't go wrong with some feta on French fries. The least fave was calamari. Thought it was a little too soft for my liking and not enough flavour. 

For my main I got the pork souvlaki. Again, a bit too charred for my liking but with the tzatziki it was delicious. Their Greek salad is also really good and better quality salad compared to the other Greek restaurants I've been to. My friends got a variety of other meals, scallops, chicken pie, moussaka etc. they all thought their meal was ok. 

Still giving the restaurant a good review because we had a great time and great service. Ps. Mention Yelp to get a small discount. It says 15% but I think we only got 10%. Still good and we didn't want to ask why it was less Lol."}
{"text":"Best souvlaki I've ever had! 

We went online to find a restaurant for lunch, and since Winterlicious was going on, that was our search criteria. They had a number of times available, and the reservation steps were flawless and easy.

The menu had plenty of variety, so we had no trouble finding a mixture of vegetarian and non-vegetarian options. We both ordered the Meze to start (generous portions of dips with perfectly grilled pita). 

Our entrees were the perfect size for a lunch (we couldn't even finish them!) I ordered the chicken souvlaki, which was the best chicken that I've ever had. The potatoes were seasoned to perfection. My girlfriend had the spanakopita, and was surprised on the quality, the fact there were 2 (she was just expecting one), and the size (THEY WERE HUGE!). 

We had the Loukoumades and Baklava for dessert, and it was a great way to end a great lunch!

The only thing that was a downfall was that it took some time to be attended by our wait staff, however, they were fully booked and they were really working hard to keep the guests happy. 

This was a great experience, and we definitely recommend this restaurant for great greek food on the Danforth!"}
{"text":"We went for Sunday lunch.Service was slow except for a couple that were Greek and were well known to the staff.They came after us but got expedited service and more then one server attending to their needs.
The food over all was good, though slow .The two women who came less then five minutes after us had even slower service then us.Appetizers came out fast but that was it . We waited a while for our entrees as it seemed that they were still attending to making entrees for guests who came way after us . 
We felt sorry for the two women ,because they were drooling over our food when ours finally came and started gobbling up their table bread , which my nephew had done the same waiting for the entrees.When we finally got our deserts which we had to remind the waitress of and finished it ....the same two women were just getting their meal.I noticed though that every one were swarming around the Greek couple behind us .Honestly I would not even care if he was the owner that many to attend to the two of them while the rest of your patrons are bitting their nails and gobbling the bread on the tables!


The Backlava although sweeter then others I have tried was the best desert .The Bailey's cream caramel was okay .
As for  the Yiaourti...well let's just say the three of us at the table took one spoon to taste it and abandoned it to the crows.
It's an okay restaurant but Fantastic ? would I go out of my way to go their , due to the slow service .The answer is no .Sorry"}
{"text":"Sometimes I enjoy just driving around and randomly going to a restaurant. Specially a restaurant that might not have many reviews.

At first when I walked in, I wasn't really drawn into the ambiance. It was painted light orange and had paintings of Greece. Greek music was playing and a few tables were full. The owner sat us down and gave us menu, the menu has a few choices but all items are authentic Greek food. You have the option to chose 3 cold mezzes for 10.95$. I ordered pickled octopus, tzaziki, and greek humus.  I didn't enjoy the mezzes at all and do not recommend the pickled octopus at all.

At this point I was nervous about the meal, we had ordered grilled calmars, chicken brochette and feta lamb.
They first brought us the grilled calmars and oh was it delicious, grilled to perfection not burned at all, just the perfect golden colour, it wasn't rubbery like others I've had, it was accompanied with a medley of peppers.

The chicken brochette was also succulent, the chicken was sliced and grilled, it was so juicy and was on a bed of onions and green peppers with a side of tzaziki. It was really good.

The lamb was also excellent, I don't like lamb at all as the smell bothers me, but in this case in did not smell at all and it tasted to good and juicy, topped with spicy feta cheese which gave it just the right about of kick.

A gem that may not be know quite as well as other greek restaurants but is a must try. Skip the mezzes and go straight to the meals. I did not try the salad but it looked good. Also the have a great variety of Ouzo so if you like this, you will enjoy their selection."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service! 

Went there with a group of 13, we were seated upstairs in a semi private area which was nice. Though this was going to be a great place but then the service began or I should say lack of. 

The waitress was rude, didn't bring the items we asked for, restaurant was out of beer on tap and specials of the night, waitress didn't smile once! Forgot our order, gave us appetizer with main meal and ignored us as much as possible. I have never left without tipping until this night. I will never return!"}
{"text":"I generally stay away from summerlicious but glad we went. I had zucchini fritters, chicken and rosemary pie and a pressed yoghurt. Greek sauvignon blanc was actually great and my friend's pork dish was wonderful. Yp reservation which was confirmed didnt show up on their system but we had a nice table on the patio. I'll go back. No service isn't fast but I really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Unlike McDonald's, Ouzeri does not dispense 'smiles for free'. The servers here are among the most dour and unimpressed in the business. However, what Ouzeri DOES get right, is their standard winterlicious / summerlicious menu which is pretty much their standard menu (it's always offered here), and that's why I've come back about 8-10 times. 

Ouzeri knows that more choice = more opportunities for mediocrity - and worse. They've nailed the menu and every single selection is rock solid reliably delicious...that's why I'll keep coming back. Order the Greek yogurt with honey for dessert - you will thank me and likely realize you've been lied to about what Greek yogurt is for years.

Classically sad, tiny, and cramped Toronto-restaurant-style bathrooms are found at the bottom of the obligatory steep Toronto basement set of stairs and remain passably clean, but could do with less dust.

Note: unless you know what retsina is and you've had it before, do NOT order the retsina wine. It's not like other white wines and you probably won't like it."}
{"text":"Pricy and just so below average greek food!
Me and my husband went for the summerlicious lunch. I chose ofcourse all vegetarian options. 
On the name of pita the served undercooked thick naan.

To my surprise, how could anyone go wrong with hummus? And particularly when you are in middle of greek town.
Spanakopita I would say we still average. 
Desserts were with average taste but way far from decent greek ones.

My husband ordered mussels and chicken souvlaki, they were slightly less worse then my order.

We were wondering how come they are in business with so pricy food in such an competitive locality???

Service was fine."}
{"text":"I agree with Wendy. Ouzeri is the kind of place you go once, and then just don't want to risk any lesser Greek food when walking on the Danforth. 

Let's start with the details, then work our way out to the general picture. 

1) They even make potatoes taste really like a delicacy. I am racking my brain trying to remember my entree because I can't forget the taste of these tender young things.
2) The tzatziki is thick and creamy and has enough onion & garlic to heal the world.
3) The dolmas are perky and not overly oily
4) Oh yeah, the grilled calamari was my entree. I've never had bad grilled calamari in Toronto (Spuntini, 5 Doors North, and Ouzeri some of the best), but what impressed me was the doppelganger serving.
5) The rest: the waiters are cheeky. The wines are aplenty  by the glass and good value. And the open air terrace is very pleasant.

I've never gotten so far as desert. Maybe because by the time I finish I see some nearby table order the flaming cheese, and get a bit queasy. Typically Ouzeri dinners require long, long walks afterwards just to forget that such a thing as flaming cheese exists."}
{"text":"Not too much to say here that hasn't been said. Been looking for a quality Greek place and this scratches the itch. Mid-high end so it would work as a nice date place as well but it's the food that's important and it's right on. I've been looking for a good, fired at the table saganaki since I had my first years ago and I found it here along with multiple other well done tapas."}
{"text":"It's been a while since i've last come here and i forgot how much i appreciate this place.

If you're in a large group, this is a great place to come. If you're with family, it's a great place to come. If you feel like taking a date to a better greek restaurant, this is also a great place to come. Really meant and designed for everyone.

The reason why i love this place is the value to quality quotient you get here. Your bill can add up getting different things, but worth every penny you spend on anything.

But my primary reason for loving this place - it is hands down the best octopus i've had in the city. No one seems to be able to get the protein as tender as these guys do. 

I highly recommend the seafood and meat platters. For $40 buxish, you are really getting a hell of a deal, especially if you are sharing.

Their horitika salad, greek salad, all loaded. Their chicken livers is tasty and delicious as hell.


My only complaint, is that they tend to slightly overcook their meets but do well on the seafood side. Just ask for it to be cooked slightly less and you'll be gold."}
{"text":"We've visited Ouzerie in Feb. 2012 on a Saturday night. Didn't make reservations (proved to be a mistake!) and had to wait about 30 min. Eventually were sited in the upper portion - not quite a balcony, just up the stairs, which are probably the best seats in the place. The waitress provided an Ok service, not too friendly, but not rude either. The menu was the reason that we've decided to wait - it's quite diverse and different from most standard Greek fare on Danforth. 
The food was quite good, although the three appetizers were not as impressive as Astoria's (than again, Astoria is a staple - haven't tasted better Greek food yet), the liver appetizer was tasty. The mains were plentiful and decently tasty, again just a nudge lower than Astoria. 
All in all, a decent Greek place would come again when the patio will be open."}

VIBE 
Ouzeri is in the heart of Greektown on The Danforth. It's one of the nicer places to get your Greek fix or go on a date in the nabe. I love the big, black tiles on the floor and the rusticity of the orange paint on the walls. The walls and decor could use a little bit of a makeover. The tables could also be bigger because a basket of bread takes up half the table.  

I was here to treat my mother for Mother's Day. It was the perfect place for a great late lunch. Lots of other families are here too and the Greek music videos on the TV in corner are entertaining to say the least. It's casual and we never felt rushed. 

WE ATE 
Currently, they have a $25 prixe fixe menu which give you good value over the regular menu (I added it up...though it's interesting that they don't have the dessert listed on the main menu). I also like that they are many options to persuade you into buying prixe-fixe. 

Mom and I split a few of our dishes. We had the spanokopita, which are two generous portions and good. I recommend! The phylo is flaky and delish. 
We also had the trio of dips with warm pita bread. Skip the bread basket, as tempting as it is staring you right in the face. They do a pretty good taramousalata here (and I think you can get it during taste of the Danforth as well). 

I had the signature Rosemary lamb pie. It's hearty, meaty and filling. The flavour of the shank really does come out. It's served with a massive \"salad\" which is basically spring mix salad from the bag with some feta (at least they use real feta and not Canadian like at Mr. Greek's), red onion and a slathering of balsamic vinegar. I was craving roasted potatoes but with the prixe fixe won't pay extra for it. I wish I had the option. They should give you the option! 

Mom had the salmon which came with more sides like horta (wilted greens with lemon and olive oil) and rice. The salmon was tender, cooked well and topped with feta and tomatoes. It was a great dish and one I would recommend if you're looking for something healthy with a greek twist!

We were pretty stuffed at this point! 

Desserts were disappointing. The loukamades were drenched with honey and way too sweet for my tasting. They just looked like cheap, desperate pieces of dough screaming out to be eaten from the plate. And for $3 you get more than 4 pieces at Athens Bakery across the street. 

Mom had the creme caramel. It was soft and sweet as well. Not bad but not mind blowing. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
Not sure if a prixe fixe was worth $70 for two (with tax, tip and drinks) but I still consider it good value for how stuffed we were after the meal. I'm not \"ouzing\" to go back but it's been a mainstay of the Danforth for a reason (or they just have really good rent control). Also, this is the first Greek restaurant I've been to where the waiters didn't serve us water at all. Shocking considering it's a water refill fest at the other establishments in the hood."}
{"text":"My girlfriend reserved for a party of 12 for winterlicious, and I was surprised that the service was quite fast given that the place was packed. Friday night and weather was gorgeous. Prix fix dinner I opted for was the Calamari. Fresh and beautifully fried (you can get em`grilled if preferred, so bonus for the calorie counters out there) with the tatziki sauce perfectly tangy and refreshing. 

All of us had different appetizers to share and I chose the spanakopita which was delicious. Flaky and the right amount of cheesy goodness with spinach, can`t go wrong. Loukoumades for dessert this time around wasn`t too appealing, tasted stale.
But I was already quite stuffed and buzzed from wine that in the end, I can do without the extra calories anyway! OPA!!!

All in all, cozy atmosphere. Friendly staff. 
Washrooms are tiny though ,LOL! Hubby almost elbowed a fellow peeER while washing his hands. The guy wasn`t too pleased with the `feeler-upper`he got. HA! Not like hubby enjoyed it either =D"}
{"text":"The food and servers here are delicious! I was in the neighborhood exploring Greektown and came here because of its Authentic Greek food. Note: The food ordered here was part of the Winterlicious 2018 special. 

ATMOSPHERE: It's a cozy little restaurant, but found there was still enough space between the tables. Lighting was cute with little edison bulbs hanging everywhere. My server was really nice and funny at times as well. 

FOOD: We tried a mix of almost everything on the winterlicious menu and found that all foods were well seasoned and not too salty. Their homemade tzaziki sauce that came with some apps and the mains blew me away! For apps, we tried the mussels (these were soooo soft) and the zucchini fritters (which go great with the tzaziki). For mains, we tried the rosemary lamb pies (phyllo pastry was so light and flaky) and the beef patties on pita. My favourite were the lamb pies! They were so juicy and full of flavour. Lastly, we had the baklava and honey fritters for dessert and I'll admit, these were a bit too sweet for my liking. 

Overall, this is definitely a great place to check out if you're in the mood for some authentic greek food!"}
{"text":"Prix fixe dinner for $25! Wow! What a deal!

A delicious leathery red wine from Greece. Tasty dips (salmon roe, eggplant and hummus though the salmon roe was the best one in my opinion). Rosemary lamb pie with philo wrapping. 

Friendly, attentive service. 

Their regular menu items looked a bit expensive compared to this deal but I don't know how long it'll be around. I definitely recommend going for prix fixe! A delicious, cheap date night out. 

After getting my ass whooped at TKMT nearby this was the perfect place to take myself on a date."}
{"text":"Went here today for my second time. I absolutely love it here and travel from North York to eat here! 

I did the 3-course fixed prix $18 lunch and what a great deal. The pita and dip was phenomenal and the souvlaki was so moist! I'm always floored by how little customers the restaurant has. 

This restaurant deserves way more hype and please people, take advantage of the fixed prix meal! It doesn't get better for $18!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here on Good Friday.  Maybe in keeping with the occasion, getting our drink and food order was like waiting for the second coming.  What finally arrived was less than miraculous.

I'm ready to convert to another restaurant."}
{"text":"*OOOOOOOOOOOOooooouzeri*

Solid 4.5 star, but 5 star during Winterlicious, Summerlicious or whenever they are offering a prix-fixe menu (which is quite often).

Ouzeri has become my new favourite Greek place on the Danforth. I have been here 5-6 times now, for both lunch and dinner. They often offer 3 course prix-fixe lunch for $15 and dinner for $25. It's an absolute bargain for the quantity of food you get and the variety is great too!

This place goes beyond the usual souvlaki, greek salad and spanakopita served up by every single Greek restaurant. They do a lot of traditional seafood dishes.

My favourite appetizer is the Mydia (mussels steamed with mediterranean sauce), but the various dips, dolmades and saganaki (OPA!) are all great choices. Skip the greek salad, you can have that shit anywhere!

The mains come served with traditional rice and potatoes, but if you're a carb-ophobe like me, you can upgrade to grilled vegetables for an extra couple bucks. My favourite main is the Kalamari Skaras, which is grilled (not fried!) If you're not into seafood, the rosemary pie and mousaka are A+ too. 

For dessert, I always get the greek yogurt with honey and walnuts. Better than crack cocaine! This authentic greek yogurt is the thickest, creamiest yogurt you will ever taste. It's heavy, more like cream cheese than yogurt.

The decor is dark and romantic, currently done up very nicely for Christmas. Service is usually good - always friendly but can sometimes be a bit slow when it gets busy.

Winterlicious is coming soon and I'm pretty sure I'm going to post a BIG FAT GREEK UYE here!"}
{"text":"I know nil about Greek food except the run-of-the-mill kind that you find in a food court. You know, grilled chicken brochette served with some potatoes, lettuce and tzatziki slapped on a styrofoam plate that's always way too small. Perhaps this is why it took me two years to finally give this place a shot. The hubby and I went there for dinner on new year's eve, the main reason being it was frigging cold that evening and we didn't want to walk too far from home.

To be honest with you, I was initially disappointed when they seated us in their upstairs dining room because it isn't as pretty as the main dining room that's visible from the sidewalk. But hey, I said to myself, at least the chalet ambiance was nice. Anyway, this review is about food so let me get to the point. I had their vodka beef stew from their specialties menu, which the server described as tender beef in creamy spicy mushroom sauce. She had me at \"creamy mushroom\". Boy what an excellent choice that was. Every bite was a delight. The downside was the plate of potatoes and steamed vegies that we ordered on the side. They were quite bland. I wonder, though, if they were purposely bland so that they wouldn't take the spotlig?t away from the main dish. My hubby had a lamb dish, also from the specialties menu, and it was equally wonderful.

Lastly, a special mention goes to the complimentary appetizer which consists of these small meatballs in tomato sauce. They were quite the delicious little suckers. I'll definitely order them next time I'm there."}
{"text":"Ouzeri occupies a rare niche in Montreal's Greek food scene, somewhere between the atrocious BYOB casa grecque and company and the high-end Milos. Ouzeri serves good-quality, tasty yet affordable Greek food in a casual atmosphere. The saganaki and feta lamb are must-haves. The octopus is hit-and-miss, sometimes delicious, sometimes overcooked and chewy. But overall it's very good. Be aware that the place can get quite animated. It's perfect for a get-together with friends. If you're nice you might even get offered a shot of ouzo ;-)"}
{"text":"On me parle d'Ouzeri depuis pas mal de temps, et je passe tous les jours devant en rentrant chez moi : ce restaurant est toujours bond√©. C'est donc avec pas mal d'attentes que nous y sommes all√©s un soir de semaine, en amoureux. 

D√®s notre arriv√©e, nous nous sommes vu offrir un verre de vin Grec suivi de quelques bouch√©es (Tzaitziki, Humus...) - Quel accueil !
L'endroit est malheureusement tr√®s bruyant car tr√®s fr√©quent√© et adapt√© aux groupes. Mais la qualit√© et la quantit√© de la nourriture nous a fait passer outre. La carte est belle et vraiment remplie : on ne sait plus o√π donner de la t√™te !! J'ai pris les calamars farcis contre la fameuse Moussaka pour mon cher et tendre.
Un r√©gal !! Ouzeri est vraiment un super restau entre amis ou en famille, mais un peu moins adapt√© en amoureux car trop bruyant.

Un dernier conseil : ne vous emballez pas car les portions sont tr√®s g√©n√©reuses. Mais au pire vous partez avec les restes pour continuer de vous r√©galer le lendemain."}
{"text":"One of the more modern Greek restaurants on the Danforth. The menu has a good variety of lamb, chicken, seafood and beef dishes. The food tastes fresh and not overly garlicky. I recommend the dips for appetizers. It comes with baba ganoush, spicy feta and hummus. I had the Pastitsio for main. It was a cheesy pasta dish with ground beef and a creamy bechamel sauce. It was served piping hot straight out of the oven in a baking dish. It was not quite as savoury as I was expecting and hoping for. It was more light and creamy than its Italian cousin, lasagna. I also tried a bit of the chicken souvlaki and thought it was very good. Overall, I think they have reasonable prices, a good menu with lots of choices and a chic and inviting atmosphere. As good as our waiter was, I don't think I can speak on the service since the restaurant was not busy enough to test it."}
{"text":"I had a hankering for some good Greek food for quite some time, and I turned to Yelp to help me satisfy my craving. Ouzeri seemed like a good pick, and I promptly made a reservation for lunch on a Thursday for my sister and I. Walking in, we quickly realized that a reservation was completely unnecessary, as the place was nearly empty. 

The service was slow and lackluster, and particularly disappointing given the number of diners in the restaurant. We were a bit tight on time, and I found myself anxiously watching the clock while simultaneously watching our server shuffle about as our food sat on the counter getting cold. Frankly, Ouzeri seems to exemplify inefficiency at its finest. To add to my sister's review below, the food also failed to make up for the poor service. I did not enjoy my appetizer (Artichokes Lemonato), although this may have been more of a personal taste preference and I can't speak much to the authenticity of the dish. I ordered the Vegetarian Moussaka as my main, which came with rice pilaf and lemon roasted potatoes. The potatoes tasted more like salty lemons disguised as potatoes, and I've had better Moussaka elsewhere. I think the fact that the rice pilaf was the most-eaten part of my plate speaks for itself. By the time dessert rolled around, however, I was stuffed and could only manage a few spoonfuls of Greek yogurt before rushing out the door.

Overall, the $15 prix fixe lunch menu is cheap, filling, and relatively satisfying, but with all the Greek restaurants lining the Danforth, I likely won't be returning to Ouzeri again."}
{"text":"This restaurant was basically the only Greek place in town I had yet to dine at, so my visit was basically inevitable. I personally thought that the restaurant was super cute, and very clean! I also want to mention that the entrance is on Saint-Denis because that was a bit confusing. 

Upon arriving we were promptly seated and given some complimentary bread, and a bowl that included hummus, green olives, and a few other items. The hummus was amazing...I couldn't stop eating it! Our waiter was extremely polite and professional, and managed to answer every question I had regarding the food. The menu was pretty small, but there were a few items that I was able to eat so I ordered all of them. Everything was fairly good. Prices were also reasonable. All in all, my party and I enjoyed our dining experience!"}
{"text":"(Probably more like 4.5 stars)
We arrived at the door right around 7pm, and we were seated right away. We had a quick look at the wine menu, and the server was there to take our drink orders. We ordered a bottle of greek red wine, it was very nice, and not too badly priced. We decided to start our meal with the olive and feta plate followed by the spanikopita. Both of these were really tasty and generous portions. For our entrees my wife had the Al's Feta Lamb, and I had the Britzola. Both dishes arrived at our table hot and cooked to perfection. We finished off by sharing an order of baklava, like everything else, it too was delicious.

The only bad thing I can say, like other reviews, is that they seem to bring out your next course almost too quickly, when we were halfway through our feta and olives, out came the spanikopita, halfway through that, out came our salads, and before we could finish our salads, they were out with the mains. 

Overall, it was a great dining experience, and we would definitely go back someday."}
{"text":"Haven't been in years, used to be a regular. I was worried food might not be good anymore, but it was! We tried a bunch of apps (saganaki, tzatziki, gigantes, etc. ) everything was really good. Their tzatziki is my fave anywhere - extra lemony and lots of garlic! 
The Mains were all really good - moist chicken and fish, lemony potatoes, decent salads. We had a few reasonably priced glasses of wine, and a great time. Service was good; my only quibble is the squishy bathrooms, poor space planning! 
This place is reasonably priced- if not cheap for the amount and quality of food - we had more than enough left over for dinner the next evening!"}
{"text":"As soon as we entered the restaurant we were impressed by how nice the place looked. I know a reviewer said it was cramped but I thought they had a lot of space. Its a pretty big restaurant, patio in front was pretty as well. Service was good. There was only one person for Saturday lunch which meant that it took awhile for water to get refilled but honestly that wasn't an issue as server was very nice and food was amazing. I wish I had taken pictures as I was blown away by how delicious everything was. The bread was soft and tasted freshly made, the calamari was crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside. We had the grilled octopus, carbonara and lamb dinner. We were all very satisfied. I think I have found my go to greek food place. 

One thing though, they do not serve gyros. Not the end of the world but if the owner of the restaurant is reading this: you should. :)"}
{"text":"We looked for a family friendly placecwith good food and this place eas exactly what we needed. We ordered alot of small dishes and a good bottle of wine and had a great time. All the food was extremly teasty, we lucked our plates drank all the wine and were very happy. The food is great, the price is ok but the only downside is the noise. The resturant has a terrible acoustic and if it is full ot is very noisy. Still I will revist this place with guests if I am in the area."}
{"text":"We arrived around 4:30 and had the place to ourselves for a bit.  They first brought out some meatballs, hummus, olives and mushrooms with bread. It was an amazing blend of flavors!! I can't remember the name of my chicken dish but it came with chicken, green peppers and onions. The chicken was tender and a good solid portion! My friend had the chicken feta and loved it. We shared rice and veggies. It was a great meal!"}
{"text":"We ordered the octopus, not tender at all. The Moussaka was not as good as the one i made at home. The lamb was overcooked. It was for a birthday dinner and desapointing."}
{"text":"Was it seriously $15 for all that Greek deliciousness? I came to the Danforth for the incomparable Lauren M's Winterlicious UYE (Unofficial Yelp Event). Just a stone's throw from Chester subway station, Ouzeri is a spacious and friendly restaurant that seems built for group and family dining.

Ouzeri accommodated our baker's dozen or so (what a stupid numerical grouping amiright?) with aplomb. The lunch prix fixe is a KILLER deal. You chose an appetizer, an entr√©e, and dessert. Apps included simmered artichokes, meze, fasolada and a traditional Greek salad. Looking around the table I noted the hefty portions. Tony F's meze came with a fist-sized scoop of hummus and two (count 'em two) whole pitas. I chose the artichokes which had an enjoyable tart flavour. But there were too many for me to finish. I wanted to save room...

...for the mains! There was moussaka, a rosemary lamb pie and calamari (which came either grilled or fried) to name a few. I'm not a chump so I got the lamb pie. It was really nice. The lamb was flavourful and the phyllo crust was brilliant. The rice and potatoes that came with every entr√©e was a bit of a snoozefest in my opinion, and I barely touched mine.

And then came dessert. Simple options: homemade baklava, a Bailey's Creme Caramel (zzz) and Yiaourti. While my neighbour slowly climaxed to the baklava, I opted for the \"pressed Greek yogurt.\" I was told it packs a punch and I'm not one to step down from a dessert-related challenge. When I received a plate with two little scoops of yogurt (ice cream consistency) covered with nuts and honey, I had to laugh (probably haughtily). But I got served: this dessert is 1.5 times denser than Osmium and 1,700 times as delicious. After all the prior food it was tough to finish. But I did. Not only was it an incredible mix of flavours and textures, I had a point to me.

Five stars for solid service, amazing food and solid value. I will come back.

Obligatory Title Pun: OUZ-ing with solid Greek eats.

Menu Readability: I can't remember. Can I just mention that with an 'e', the word 'yiaourti' would have all the vowels in the English alphabet? 

Need to mention: Osmium isn't that bad in small doses, like in a sorbet or something.

What this place teaches me about myself: I may have met my dessert nemesis, and her name is Yiaourti. There will be a re-match."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner during taste of the Danforth. No line to get in which was awesome. Place was hopping busy. Had lamb souvlaki which was great. Service a tad slow but it was Saturday and there was the world's largest street festival going on! Most entrees under $20."}
{"text":"Had lunch there today, on the pleasant patio. Only one other table was occupied. One waiter on duty. Wine came quickly followed by grilled octopus and grilled calamari. Despite assurances from waiter that both would be tender, neither was. Then we had to wait ages for coffee. Waiter had forgotten. Loud elevator music did 't help the atmosphere either. Next time will go next door to Pan, which was full, no music, roughly same menu.

Last week we had fabulous grilled Octopus at Illhas de Bruma on College Street. Really fresh and tender, too."}
{"text":"Excellente cuisine ! Tout √©tait frais et go√ªteux! Nous avons prit le b¬úuf au martini qui √©tait d'une tendret√©! Les crevettes au vin blanc et feta. Plat frais √† souhait! Et les l√©gumes grill√©s ainsi que les asperge √† l'ail et citron. Tout √©tait bon!
Le Service est courtois et professionnel. 
Le seul point qui serait √† am√©liorer c'est le d√©cor et les meubles. On voit que ce restaurant roule √ßa bosse depuis longtemps. Mais bon ... on s'entend que ce n'est pas le point le plus important"}
{"text":"I have been going to the Ouzeri for quite some time. I always try to sneak in when I am in Toronto. I like the atmosphere and the wait staff is excellent. Ouzeri is a place where the drill is that couples share starters and mains. What I usually get is a selection of Meze for my starter. Typically, I get hummus, spiced feta and skordalia. All are very tasty and the pita provided is excellent.

For the main, I usually order mixed grill souvalaki. The greek  potatoes are yummy and have a nice bite. Nice simple fare that goes down smooth and sits well in the stomach.

All in all, I think this is a very good Greek restaurant with a very good food and a good wine list. I think it is reasonable for the price."}
{"text":"I went to Ouzeri a while back but I went back again for Winterlicious this year. As always, great food and service! They definitely don't skimp on the portions. $18 for lunch was worth it :)

What me and my boyfriend ordered:
- Mese - three of their dips with warm pita bread. The dips were so delicious! Perfect start to the meal.
- Mydia - Mussels were a good portion in a tasty broth.
- Pork souvlaki - tender meat with potatoes and rice. Generous portion - I was stuffed!
- Calamari - Again, very generous portions.
- Ordered the yiaourti and loukoumades; a sweet end to our filling meal.

Although the restaurant wasn't full when we went for lunch, the service was attentive and efficient. 

This is our place to get Greek food!"}
{"text":"Our friends took us to Ouzeri for an early dinner.  Had a good time at this Greek restaurant in Montreal.    

Honestly, my wife and I weren't very hungry cause we had a late lunch.  Still, we saw a couple of items on the menu that we just had to try.  The Dolmades was alright.  The Grilled Calamari was very good!!  Not rubbery or tough like I find in most restaurants.  Everyone in our large group seemed really pleased with their meals.  There was no leftovers at all.

Ambiance was nice.  Service was polite without being intrusive.  I would return to Ouzeri especially for that delectable Grilled Calamari!!"}
{"text":"In the midst of the chaotic crowds from the Taste of the Danforth and down pour of rain flooding the streets we decided to seek refuge and refuel at Ouzeri.

There was a line upon entering which was no surprise as this is probably one there busiest days for business however after a short 10 minute wait we were seated at a cozy marble top table towards the back of the packed restaurant.

A waiter came over to greet us and take our drink orders. We decided on two glasses of White Zinfandel which was refreshing and light.

After placing our orders the waiter returned with the bread basket which had an assortment of some the heaviest rolls I've ever eaten.

For appetizer we decided to order Greek salads because surprisingly our mains of Chicken Souvlaki dinners didn't already include the standard Greek Salad.

Greek Salad - Fresh Crisp Lettuce With Tomatoes, Cucumbers, Peppers And Onions Topped With Crumbled Feta, Olives & Special Dressing.
The salad tasted pretty good and I enjoyed the fresh bright red tomatoes and addition of peppers throughout.

Chicken Souvlaki Dinner
It was served with a simple standard greek rice, a tiny portion of roasted baby red potatoes (1 & 1/2 baby potatoes) and a Delicious side of Gigantes which are Giant Lima Beans baked w/ fresh herbs, vegetables & tomatoes. I loved those beans, really soft tender and flavourful! The chicken had a nice charcoal taste however I found it a tad on the dry side. Luckily there homemade Tzatziki was soo creamy and packed soo much flavour that it definitely was the saving grace.

For dessert I decided to step outside the box and try something different for a change. I'm not a fan of the traditional greek dessert baklava so I figured the next best thing has to be Greek yogurt?

Yiaourti - pressed Greek yogurt topped with nuts and honey poached figs
Super fresh creamy thick tangy Greek yogurt goodness balanced by the sweet & juicy poached figs drizzled with that succulent honey fig reduction topped with crunchy toasted walnuts. Sensory overload! I devoured every last delicious bite!

Overall I'd say Ouzeri is a typical Greek restaurant. It had some misses but the hits seemed to make up for it. Despite the how packed and busy the restaurant was our waiter was really attentive and food came out at a good pace. They managed to always keep our glasses full which is definitely a bonus is my books."}
