{"text":"This place rocks. We like it more than Hammersmiths that was here before. Wife and I love everything we have tried: trout hash, 80/20 burger, 'shrooms on toast, big chick thighs, buckwheat pancakes. All unique menu items rather than run of the eggs benedict. Kids love the view of the street from the big windows, pumpin beats, free banana bread that comes while you wait for your food (which is a good idea, because it's usually busy), and friendly service. Tea comes in a huge pot. Prices are reasonable for the quality and quantity of food here!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I'm THRILLED a neat little place like this has opened in my hood (I think of it as being located in Leslieville but I may be incorrect as others are saying it's Riverdale...south). 

Great service, friendly and low-key vibe. Understandably, the menu is currently limited so it doesn't reflect what's posted online. They may want to consider saying that on the actual website so people are prepared. 

Food was good. Personally, I felt some was overpriced when compared to similar establishments that offer a lot more in terms of ambiance (I love this place but it's not fancy, which is fine, but don't charge fancy prices) and a level of quality that is a notch higher. I had a fish brandade appetizer at $12 that me and my dining companion thought was good but nothing special. And we both had the fish entre, which was quite good...but hoped it would be a little better at $18. 

On my visit, there were two white wines on offer. Neither bottle was open, so I asked our lovely server to ask chef what she recommended I have with the fish. It was undrinkable. Both my dining companion and I couldn't take more than two sips as it was not only sweet, but simply a pretty bad wine. I find it shocking that the wine was on the menu, let alone that the chef would have recommended it with the fish. There were only two choices and she got it very wrong. Odd. I also think the wines were overpriced when compared to other similar establishments that offer quality, and curated wines. For example, I visited a hole-in-the-wall called Corks and Platters in the Beach. Wine was the same price of $11 but it was spectacular. The owner used to work in the wine industry, so she curates her offerings. Couldn't help being disappointed with my experience at SD.

I'll go back for dinner when they have a few more offerings on the menu that appeal to me, like mushrooms on toast. I think lunch and brunch would be excellent choices and fair pricing for this little gem.

Chef and family have a lot on their, er, plates right now. I'm routing for them!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable, best burger ive ever had 20/80 lamb and beef. Service exceptional and superb atmosphere. ILL BE BACK"}
{"text":"I'm always down for brunch but can't bear weekend crowds. Having brunch on a weekday is something thing I can dig. Discovered by my girl on IG, I was hesitant to make the trek across town from Bellwoods to Leslieville with so many options in our hood. The girl is always boss so off we went.

Entered to a typical hipster aesthetic and your tatted beardman that lives on his triumph. He approached with a gracious and polite demeanour. +1. 

Scanned the menu to find the most uncommon of items. Suspecting I now may have been conned into an over-stylized organic veggie cliche, I went for the Dinette Brekkie. No meat included and no bacon option (I'm your robot brunch type) so I ordered a side of sausage. A couple of fresh-pressed juices to start and Fried Chicken and Buckwheat Pancakes for the wifey.

While waiting, took a closer look at the decor. First off, I was getting up on the sketch and water color stroke drawings that lined the wall and menu. The retro cameras, chair bar. All looking good and worthy of a cam pic.

The food arrived and my fears continued... All looking too  veggie hipster for me. Smaller than avg components. Touch of pea sprouts for colour. Eggs pre-peppered.  Uh oh.  Plating for both our dishes was pic worthy so out with the phone cams again. Click click. Time to eat.

SO.  No idea why, but I started with the grilled tomato.  Usually not my first target. This is where the journey really began for me.

I cut a piece off the first tomato and put it down.  Now, I'm really not a foodie nor do I care to advertise my outings, BUT... The tomato hit my mouth and there was a rush of flavours that hit me. My eyes rolled back and then began to tear. WTF just happened? I moaned, then cursed. THIS WAS THE BEST DAM TOMATO I'VE EVER HAD. I was experiencing emotions I haven't had since I was building snowforts in my backyard as a child. It's only just a tomato but it moved me like the lady eating that cake in Matrix 2. Then I hit the toast. Texas cut. Toast is toast, until I put that drop of fruity jam or compote. OMG. Best dam jam I ever ate. Everything else just became a blur of bliss, but if a tomato and jam can inspire me to write my first post, then u catch my drift. The food for this dude was interstellar. I won't go into the Fried Chicken and pancakes. Try it for yourself. While settling up the bill, I take a loving look at a stack of books beside the cameras. One is about afro-vegan cuisine. Another is from Cafe Boulud. I get it.

The bearded man. His name is Johnny and he's a sweetheart and loving and willing to serve.

All the stars align at Saturday Dinette. The decor matches the mood that matches the food. It's all real. No cliche here."}
{"text":"Food: fantastic, Atmosphere: hip and unassuming, Staff: wonderful, location: meh (but I'm a die hard west-ender). The lovely people at the Saturday Dinette have nailed the 'brunch experience'! The menu is eclectic, ranging from middle eastern favorites like shakshuka to a carribean staple like pulled goat shoulder on a home made bun. I was very impressed with the way the chefs had created such interesting and unique flavour profiles, while serving visually stunning meals. I would highly recommend the Saturday Dinette and I'm really looking forward to going back and trying them for dinner soon. Watch out, they're taking a break over the Christmas break this year so make sure you check that they're open before stopping by over the holidays!"}
{"text":"This is, by far, my favorite place in Toronto for lunch/brunch. I've never had a bad experience and the staff is incredibly nice. The locally sourced food always tastes fresh and makes me want to order a second round. You must get the herbed poached eggs! The atmosphere is funky, warm, and inviting. Be warned though for weekend brunch it can be a bit of a wait but it is soooo worth it!"}
{"text":"We had breakfast here for the first time last week and it was absolutely fantastic!  We noticed when they opened up in the area and then again when they were featured on You Gotta Eat Here.  From the moment we walked in everyone greeted with a warm smile and enthusiastic hello.  The menu has some really creative twists on otherwise plain standards (high stacked mushrooms, toast topped with egg; shawkshuka with a bunch of veg, okra and a homemade flat bread).  They're great with kids too!  Funky atmosphere to the tune of an eclectic retro vinyl collection.  All around we loved it and will definitely be making SD a regular stop for weekend brunch."}
{"text":"We had such an amazing dinner here. The atmosphere was excellent and the food was so good. Great comfort food for our cozy winter dinner date. The owners are really nice and made the evening perfect. I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I was eager to try out this new brunch and supper joint at Gerrard and Logan.

The interior is almost as hipster as you could imagine. Think steel buckets holding the utensils, nouveau-rap-rock music constantly blaring from the speakers, denim-looking napkins and teeny tiny almost-shot-size glasses to drink your tap water out of. Oh, and tea and coffee comes by default in French presses. 

Whether or not you like the ambience will entirely hinge upon how much you like or dislike general hipster vibes. I personally am sorta neutral to that kind of atmosphere, but was really grateful and relieved to see that the helpful, smiley, genuine staff did not exude any stereotypical hipster sultriness. What did bother me though, was the descriptions of some food items on the menu. The baked beans, sausage and fried egg I ordered was described as :'molasses baked beans (I could not taste any molasses), farmer's sausage (uh...what? There was hardly any sausage with it, anyway) and an 'over-easy cluck' (turns out this ridiculous description was a mere fried egg). 

I'm sure some people would find these elaborate descriptions funny; me, hungry and decaffeinated and wanting to order quickly, found it distracting and annoying. To each their own!

Staff were all around fantastic. 100%. The hostess welcomed us immediately and seated us at the bar, on surprisingly comfy stools. The man behind the counter making cocktails and hot drinks was a joy to deal with, really friendly and funny with an attitude that would put a smile on anyone's face. One of the chef did her work while dancing around and generally loving life. Brilliant!

Unfortunately, the food did not live up to the great expectations set by the staff. The baked beans came a bit too crunchy for my liking and the sausage parts were barely noticeable. In fact, had I ordered simply beans, toast and egg, without sausage, I may not have even noticed that any sausage was present, or may have just commented 'huh, seems like a bite of sausage found its way into my dish'! Disappointing. The toast came dressed with olive oil, which I hate, and I did not know about this dressing when I ordered. Gah. What's wrong with butter?! 

There was a $1 for ketchup. BOOOOO.

Boyf liked his buttermilk pancakes but was still starving after having eaten them, and not happy about the portion size (small) vs price ($9).

I know it's a clich√© to say 'I really wanted to love this place', but I really, really did. The staff were as great as I've ever encountered, I love French press coffee, it's nice to see a trendy place opening in an otherwise dull intersection, and I admire the much-written about community spirit of the chef and the establishment overall. Unfortunately, I just didn't enjoy my meal enough to warrant giving this place any more than three stars - and that's at a stretch; I feel I have to be generous as the staff were lovely and the place is still new so I don't want to be harsh.

I may return and try something else - I do hope to be proved wrong if I do come back."}
{"text":"Excellent innovative comfort food. I have been here for both dinner and brunch and was very happy with my meal every time. It's a little on the small side. 
The chicken and johnnycakes for brunch are amazing."}
{"text":"Go here!!! You will not be disappointed! The food is wonderful! The service warm! With drinks it's still an affordable dinner out! A local gem!!!"}
{"text":"Whether it be for brunch or dinner, Saturday Dinette is always going to be the right choice.  Not sure about the other reviews on here but I have been several times for both and it has always been great!  The traditional diner style ambiance with an updated menu is perfect....and delicious.  I think it is really the best thing to have happened to the neighborhood in a while...."}
{"text":"Can't get enough of this place. Great food. Great staff. Great vibe. A little secret gem on Gerrard East."}
{"text":"Saturday Dinette happened to be opening the same week that we moved to Riverdale- it was a fateful coincidence because it immediately became our fave spot for any special night. It is a business you really want to support because it is run by the sweetest young family who takes such pride in their food and restaurant. You know owners who dump a bunch of cash into renos and promo and then think later of the menu? This is the total opposite. They started with mad talent and great staff and worked with what they had to create an earnest and cool vibe. Delicious and totally unique!"}
{"text":"Community involvement, neighbourhood gem, sumptuous/delish meals. 

The smell once walking in is mouth watering and you know how you can tell when the person making you a meal loves eating themselves. This is your jam, baby. I found this article on BlogTO, which inspired me to go in, and then my taste buds gave me a high five. I love eating and high fives. Go, Toronto. Make your tummy happy on a fall day.

{"text":"So glad we finally tried out this little neighbourhood gem! We went for dinner and had the wedge salad, country fried steak & pan roasted white fish. The brunch menu sounded so great we returned the next day for herbed poached eggs & the Dinette Brekkie. It's clearly a family-run labour of love. It feels like being invited into someone's home for an amazing local & seasonal meal. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"It's hard not to order everything from the brunch menu. Biscuits and pancakes and adult beverages - oh my. An amazing east end option for brunch. I'm already planning my next visit - this time for dinner."}
{"text":"Pros: the staff were VERY sweet and friendly, good music.

Cons: freezing (most patrons had their coats on, staff were wearing heavy sweaters and toques), over-priced food.... $10 for soup?, tiny wine glasses, uncomfortable seating, not a lot of items on the menu appealed to me, food was just \"okay\" tasting.

We went for dinner, perhaps brunch is better"}
{"text":"This is one of the cities best restaurants by far. Amazing!  We visited SD once before and they have consistently great food. The service is warm and friendly. It's one of a kind for the east end."}
{"text":"Lovely vibe and good room and kind attentive and professional service. The flavours were alright.

And then something quite embarassing happened. I am not a foodie, not a critic but this was a customer 101 gaffe.  It made my experience unpleasant and awkward.

My male friend ordered the beef rib appetizer and then gave him 3 robust ribs. I ordered them and got 3 tiny ones. We all felt awkward and made some jokes but said nothing. Was the gender-based service?  They could have given me 4.5 small ones and the portion size would have felt equitable.

If this happens to you. Say something.

Whatever.

Not going back."}
{"text":"Saturday Dinette will easily become your favourite brunch spot (though they do serve dinner which I will be trying soon. While it can be described as a diner, this place boasts an inspired menu reminiscent of something you might stumble into in Brooklyn. An open kitchen serves up delicious meals while old school hip hop delights. 

Try the Herbed Poached Eggs or the Dinette Breckie. Order a sausage on the side. Enjoy. 

More on this gem when I return for dinner."}
{"text":"I really like this place. It's a cozy little diner in an unsuspecting place, with a great cozy atmosphere, friendly servers, and amazing food. I've been here for dinner and brunch, but have always gone during non-peak hours so no issues with wait times or service. The food is really delicious and often rich and flavourful fusion soul food (not health food by any means). I was told that they're going to stop serving dinner service in 2017, which is a bummer because that mushroom mac 'n cheese and cauli baba dish was on point."}
{"text":"Not what you expect from a typical diner- the food is exceptional with attention to detail. Beautiful presentation and great service. Wait times are long (45min on a Saturday at noon) but well worth it. Small, cozy, and beautiful touches with art and marble tabletops. Instagrammers haven!

Ordered the Shroom's on toast with a side of hashbrowns- you'll want to order both! Packed with flavour, there's no skimping on ingredients here.

They also employ women from the local YWMCA and play the best hits from the 90's- what's not to love?

Note- while waiting for your table head on over to Hailed Coffee for a delicious latte or cappuccino"}
{"text":"This has been a great place to visit for home cooked meals. They offer a cute diner style environment with friendly service. Sadly, after three years in business they have closed due to landlord issues."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere. Food created with care. Great people and just the spot that riverdale needs. Great burger. Try the pork belly."}
{"text":"Thank you Suzanne Barr for making our city a more wonderful place.  For adding some delight to a world that can be dark and cruel at times.

This is a woman who CAN COOK!  Her flavors are fantastic.  Even the veggie dishes are mind blowing!  

A cute home like spot, comfortable and unpretentious.  Perfect food.  Small but perfect menu selections.  

I just feel real good after eating here.....

And Suzanne is very community minded.

What more could a diner ask for.

I could go on but you really just have to eat here to understand."}
{"text":"Living in the neighbourhood we've been passing this place for two years reminding ourselves we really must try it, and today for brunch, we did. AMAZING food and service, with a highly creative menu. I had the dinette breakfast, with eggs, thick toast, hash brown, grits and grilled tomato, with a sausage on the side. SO incredibly yummy. My husband had the burger, which is a beef-lamb combo, miles high with an egg. Superb. The most incredible milkshake, see photos, with a candyfloss-like topping and sprinkles underneath...wow factor. I had the pomegranate mint lemonade, also phenomenal. This place rocks. Cannot wait to try it for dinner! Note...no AC and today was 40 degrees outside, so it was toasty, but still worth every second!"}
{"text":"Saturday Dinette is located at a not so glamorous portion of Riverdale.  But it sits well at this spot, elevates the street corner but yet blends in very well.
It's a cozy place with an open kitchen. Nice music wafting through the space. Already I felt happy even before the food.  
We ordered the burger and the chorizo.  Chorizo was nice, but not too impressive.  The pickles that came with it were very good. 
The burger arrived towering high, two thick patties, one crunchy layer of crispy cheese with sweet potato string fries on the side. The burger was juicy and bursting with flavour. The mint sauce totally complementary to the lamb/beef patties.  The fries were delicious and fun to eat.
Service was attentive but not overbearing.  Perfect!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots for brunch. The food is fresh, the atmosphere is great. I always seem to get the Dinette Brekkie which is a combination of grits, hashbrowns, fried eggs and tomatos, It's delicious. The pea puree on the herbed poached eggs is aaaamazing. I've never been for dinner but if the brunch food is any indication, then I definitely have to get myself there."}
{"text":"I'm so sorry to write this, but I feel the need to update my review. My most recent meal at Saturday Dinette was so-so. The food seemed over salted, the ingredients seemed less fresh, and even the candied walnut salad was lacklustre. 

The service was great, the milkshake was great and the people remain lovely. Which makes this very sad to write. I wonder if they are having difficulty getting the best ingredients? I will give them several more tries before I give up."}
{"text":"Great little brunch spot. No wait on a Saturday at noon! No AC, so keep that in mind on these sweltering summer days, but staff was friendly, service was quick and everything was super tasty. Had the dinette breakfast, (cheesy grits, yum!) and friends had poached eggs with pea pur√©e which was super fresh and delish. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Ok, so I was a negative nelly going here with the fianc√©e.  We went to hammer smith and loved it, and thought that the replacement couldn't match up.  We were wrong.  Service is fast, caring and fantastic.  And the food is Fabius.   We had the zucchini latkes, and the pear compote was a brilliant match. For mains, the nightly pie was fantastic.  This was it in a nutshell- as a kid, you love pot pies but there's always something off.  It might be texture, flavor, or crust.  Fuck.  This killed all of it.  Light thin crust with fantastic gravy.  Tender meat.  Sided with mashed and mint.  I will steal the recipe.  Dessert was the ginger bread s'mores.  All made in house and all fantastic.  
I'm done with my overly glowing review. Just go.  Small, romantic, great food and casual atmosphere.  I hope you survive the east end. We will be back."}
{"text":"A lovely little diner! Run by a husband wife duo. Delicious food. We had the zucchini latkes, funghi salad, and two different burgers. Also the milkshakes! All were great. The chef is a trained vegan chef so if you are looking for creative vegetarian options this place is for you!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I want to write this in the most fair way as possible. Two stars is the most accurate, non exaggerated score I can give. 

First off, we arrived at a full restaurant. No problem, we asked how long the wait might be. She said oh Um, Half an hr? Sure. Ended up being an hr and a half......if we had known we would of never had stayed that long. I mean granted she can't control how long people stay for, but if they just sat down or haven't started eating, don't say to your customer the next table is in half an hr! 

Chicken balls were frankly not that tasty. A sauce with a whole garlic inside didn't really work, might of been better crushed since it wasn't very garlicky infused at all. 

Fish cakes were dry and hard like pucks.... Uh Ya. 

Bbq pork sandwich finally turned it around I thought it was tasty but on the sweet side... 

One of the chefs or owners I'm not sure came by to ask us about the food and I was like oh ok I better tell her about the sandwich how it was too sweet. She was like oh.... That's bbq sauce that's how it is. Then when I continued to provide some constructive criticism she cut me off and said well I won't bother you enjoy your food. I'm like OK u asked me for my opinion and when you don't hear 'oh everything is wonderful!' or something like that you cut me off? Okay. 

The meat platter was overall not bad. Chicken was flavourful and tasty so were the beans. I think the ribs used the same sweet bbq sauce and again, just too sweet. The beef steak kebob, overcooked and tough. Bread, was cold. 

Sigh

So. Food wasn't all that bad  it not spectacular. A fair three. - 1 for service."}
{"text":"I had a terribly upsetting experience here today, and although I can't comment on the food, (we left after canceling our order), I thought it was worth commenting on what happened hoping that we both can learn from the experience. I acknowledge fault in that we shouldn't have gone for brunch on a Saturday morning with a time limit. That was a mistake. We arrived right at 9am, the time they opened, and although the door was wide open, we were told they weren't ready and it would be a few minutes. It wasn't long though, and we sat in a nice sunny spot. After a while, we were offered coffee, and that took some time to come. It was fully 20 minutes before anyone came to take our order. At that point I was worried about being rushed, so I explained our hurry and asked if we might be better off just having our coffee, and coming back another time. We were assured that it was fine, so we ordered. This is where it got ugly. The chef (owner, I think) asked us over the counter if we BOTH had to leave, and we said yes. With an eye roll, she huffed that Saturday's were busy, and in the future... I stopped her then and said we had been waiting for a while, and had checked with the server. She seemed so put out that I said (yes, with ire in my voice, but perfectly politely) that we would prefer to cancel the order, pay for the coffee and go. She said, no, through clenched teeth that she would push our order through. I had literally lost my appetite, so I declined again. The server ( her husband, maybe?) came and asked her what was going on, and she went the route of public humiliation ... Shouting for all to hear that I was unreasonable for getting annoyed at her simply clarifying the order. The level of venom in her voice was shocking. My heart was racing as she slammed cabinets, and ranted. I kept quiet since it was clear arguing would have escalated the incident to epic proportions. We left... To a series of rolled eyes and smirking. It was all capped off by a sarcastic \"have a WONDERFUL day\".  Totally unprofessional, totally childish, and really upsetting. I know we're just two customers, so really, who cares, right? 
From the reviews, I can see that the food is probably great, and the service usually friendly. Maybe she was having a shitty day, and it got dumped all over me. Whatever it was, we won't ever be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! The restaurant for sure has its hipster vibe and you can feel it as the staff are humming and dancing while serving you decent hearty food!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and pride in ownership from back to front of house. A well assembled team who care about the food, and customer. A balance led by owners clearly aware of what it takes and what matters.  

The menu provides a really nice balance of unique well thought out flavours, without compromising comfort staples of comfort.  Case in point - a masterfully slow cooked french onion soup.  Great, decor, staff and menu."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch this morning , and what a surprise . First off Annie T I'm sorry you had a bad experience but give it another shot !!! I cannot even think of a single negative thing to say . The coffee itself is amazing , we ordered biscuits and jam to start and it was great . We also ordered the Dinette brekkie and the Jaynes Manfield ? Pancakes with fried chicken !! Both were amazing !!! The Chef and waitress were humble and really made it a great experience !! Will definitely be back to try some other dishes !!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here 4 times. The food seems like it should be good. The staff and environment give a sense of professionalism and quality. the dishes seem well thought out and evidently a lot of effort has been put into curating the menu. That being said, prepare to be disappointed.

 Every dish I have ordered has been extremely poorly executed: A hamburger who's bottom bun was MUSH before it hit the table, from soaking in gross pink cabbage juice that was used as a garnish. An offering of a \"side\" of sweet potato chips, which amounted to three (3) yes, you read that correctly, THREE medium sized chips as the \"side\" to my 18 dollar burger. 

The mushrooms on toast was probably the saltiest thing i've ever been served in a restaurant (im not exaggerating here), I asked the server to have the cook taste it, and was told it was \"how it's supposed to be\", though it tasted like the chewy mushrooms had been boiled in sea water and then burned on a dirty flat top that was long overdue for a proper cleaning.

 The $22 fried chicken with pancakes and collard greens came with 3 bite sized buckwheat pancakes, each only slightly larger than a toonie, and a few mouth fulls of room-temperature slimy overcooked greens smeared along the bottom of the plate.

Be prepared to read a menu which boasts upwards of 6 components per dish, but receive plates which contain minuscule portions of each listed ingredient. This is my biggest gripe, the portions are just downright insulting. Every time i've dined here i've left hungry after my 15-24 dollar entree.

The only reason this business didn't fail within a few months of opening is that the yuppies of Leslieville don't know the value of a dollar. $12 or $22 for a burger makes NO difference to them, nor does the way said burger might taste, as long as it is going to look nice on their instagram account.

The people that run this place are very nice and welcoming, it's the only redeeming factor of the business. The Chef surely has some talent, but why bother putting any effort in when, like i said, people are there more or less exclusively for the insta photos and the facebook statuses.

I was excited when this business opened and wanted it to be my new local. What a shame that it's turned out to be what it is. If the staff put as much effort into providing good service and cooking good food as they put into tooting their own horns and building a community of people that buy into their shitty brand, they would be running a half decent restaurant. Too bad they aren't."}
{"text":"A few bites of our experience review - 
\"Perhaps the most memorable part was the beautiful long artwork of watercolor illustrations behind the bar. It was made of unfinished women's faces interrupted by geometric figures. There visuals played into the menu and branding very well.\"
\"There was a turntable at the front, as well as fun program to go with their vinyl collection - buy, swap and sell from their large selection plus the option to spin your favourite vinyl if you bring it in.\""}
{"text":"I love this place. 

It's a very unassuming restaurant at Gerrard and Logan. Based on the decor, you would expect this place to be a very casual diner experience.  But it's anything but average and it's charming inside in a totally unpretentious way. 

I've been here three times - twice for brunch and once for dinner. 

I came here on a weekday evening for dinner. It was pretty empty but it was also late. 

We split three dishes which was more than enough food. The highlight was the cauliflower baba ghanoush. I love eggplant and cauliflower so this was a no brainer 

We also had the mac & cheese and the chicken & grits. The latter was good but probably the least interesting. 

For brunch, the restaurant filled up pretty much right after they open so go early.  I've had the shakshuka and the biscuits and gravy. The former is  a nice tomatoey mildly spicy dish.  The latter is quite savoury and heavy. 

Overall, I've had great meals here. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We came to eat here for the first time and we were starving,staff was very nice and welcoming right off the start.
We started of with the french press coffee, bad idea. It was disgusting, didn't even finish a cup. It was like drinking brown water. Don't even think it was the proper ground for a press.

When the food finally came we had the jaynes manfield, the fried chicken was good but the pancakes were burnt and you could taste it. Overpriced for what you get, two small pieces of friend chicken and two thin pancakes.

The biscuit and gravy were also a disappointment. The Brussels sprouts and biscuits were burnt. Did not even finish the meal. 

After spending $50 and leaving hungry we had to go and eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Best food in the city hands down! Brunch or dinner you'll never be disappointed. Incredible service and tunes to boot."}
{"text":"LOVED the brunch food. AMAZING.

Highly recommend getting here EARLY on the weekends for brunch otherwise you might not find seating, particularly if coming with a party larger than 2, since the space is pretty small and they don't take brunch reservations. My friends and I arrived here at 9AM today (Sunday), which is when they open and did not have to wait at all for seats. But by 10AM the restaurant was generating a line at the door.

Food- 5/5. Lots of eggs on the menu, but they do have many vegetarian and vegan options on their menu. I came with high expectations for the buckwheat pancakes, but felt kinda letdown because there wasn't much texture to brag about and it was too sweet. I like denser pancakes with a gritty and chewy texture, so felt that the buckwheat pancakes that I had once at Insomnia was much better in comparison. I ordered the herb poached eggs, which featured 2 perfectly poached eggs on a nest of split pea spread (absolutely delicious if you like the sweetness of peas) on a piece of corn arepa (didn't like this because it was way too dry and tasteless) on a bed of pre-dressed greens with actual herbs within the blend. My friends ordered the burger, which I did not try since it was lamb+beef, the shakshuka, which also had meat but you can opt for a vegetarian option, and the shrooms on toast. The shrooms on toast was majestic looking, but I felt that the mushrooms were too salty.

Value- 4/5. Not cheap like other smaller brunch diners, such as Figs, but also reasonable. The cheapest brunch entree was $12 and most expensive was $16, I believe? The portion sizes are reasonably large, so not fancy French portion sizes, but also much smaller than at comfort food-style brunch places like Insomnia.

Service- N/A. They appear to be understaffed, so expect service to be very slow, but all the staff are very responsive if you approach them with a request, so do that and don't expect them to come to your table because they are too busy cooking up a storm for you :) Everyone is also super friendly. 

They also have weekday brunch and dinner options here. I will be back soon :D"}
{"text":"Everything tastes amazing, friendly service - highly recommend! I ordered the Shrooms on toast (I'm not a vegetarian) and it was so tasty I did not even miss not having meat!"}
{"text":"We went to Saturday Dinette last night and it was out of this world yummy! The service and ambiance was spot on. Tiny spot with room for us only at the bar which was fine; it allowed us to talk more to the lovely staff :)
It seemed there were lots of regulars. 

We ordered the tacos, mac & cheese and the Bimbibap, paired with beer/cider. The food was some of the best comfort/diner food we've ever had. The mac and cheese was perfectly creamy (without being overbearing); the tacos (vegetarian) were so, so lovely for a veg taco - lots of flavour notes with great textures. 

We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My sister invited me to eat brunch at the newly opened Saturday Dinette in between grocery shopping. It wasn't so long ago that this corner location at Gerrard and Logan was a hip yet basic diner called Hammersmith's. And it was a long time ago that this was the Logan Grill, a place that never kept regular hours so I always wondered if it ever opens whenever I pass by it on the walk to school way back in my teenage years. A man sitting next to me recalls the time the Grill was open, where he was a regular there could chill for hours all morning alone in a booth.

Saturday Dinette maintains the floor plan and white walls of its predecessors, though the bar counter has been remodeled and now serves alcohol. he walls are decorated with facial motif paintings by illustrator Stephanie McKay. The open rear kitchen bustling with women at work. Some of the kitchen staff come from a YWCA training program, here to learn on the job alongside chef/owner Suzanne Barr. I asked about this to a waitperson, who remarks, \"We are very into community involvement and giving people a leg up on life.\"

I didn't know what to expect from this cozy and very hip, 'feminine moderne' diner, scanning the daytime menu where food makes up a small chunk. I just went for the burger ($12), and another waitperson was kind of second-guessing herself. \"I think that's half lamb, half beef... like, it's two patties, with the lamb and beef mixed in together.\" You sure? Sign me up for one! Wasn't even expecting a two-patty burger at a place like this, never mind a big burger.

The 80/20 refers to the ratio of beef to ground lamb (it doesn't say anything about it on the menu though) in the two tender-loose patties they give you in an oversized bun. With the addition of a house mayo and a relish of diced beets and zucchini, the burger is so damn exploding with juicy flavours, you will forget there is such a thing as ketchup or pickles. Highly recommended, highly out of this world. With a focus on fresh modern takes on comfort diner fare, served in dainty cups and dishes, there's no fryer in the kitchen, so you can forget about fries on the side as well.

The community investment theme seems to extend well to the diner's hospitality, where they made us feel more than warm and taken care of in our dine-in. It's hip but mature, beatnik modern but classy, romantic yet totally chilled out, and certainly gives the Gerrard area more vibrancy than it has ever seen before, where the Leslieville and Riverdale crowds can hang out for an evening. I'm more than surprisingly impressed; I'll be poking my head here more often when I can.

{TTC: the 506 all the way to Logan Avenue.}"}
{"text":"Sadly I must update my prior review - I understand that Chef Laura is no longer at the Dinette and it was clear that she was the backbone of the operation.  Such a loss. We won't be returning.  The one meal we had when Laura wasn't cooking was average at best - we thought it to be an aberration but with Laura gone it won't be the same."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast hoping to see how it would compare to Hammersmith's, the beloved brunch spot that occupied the space beforehand. Maybe I am getting older, but this place is definitely more hipster and not as calm - hip hop blaring, curtains hanging in the window and door (wasn't even sure if it was open), and a few nudie pics hung like wallpaper in the ladies (not sure how the mom I saw explained it to her kid). I didn't see the \"romantic\" side of this place as some reviewers had mentioned - it's small and tightly packs dining parties beside each other. 

Despite this, the food was good - I had scrambled eggs with Rosti and beans, and my dining companion had something similar. We also indulged in dessert which was pretty yum: a crumble with rhubarb and a small scoop of vanilla ice cream.

Not sure how I feel about paying $5.50 for coffee (even though it's French press and all) and my friend being charged twice for two pots of tea (most places just fill it up again without a charge). 

Will we be back? Maybe. But for now, our search continues for a less hipster place in the East end."}
{"text":"People who know the restaurant scene in Lesliviille / Riverdale know that it is a brunch phenomenon. Lineups along Queen street with Bonjour Brioche, Lady Marmalade, Yaya, Okok Diner .. wow I'm surprised (not surprised) I've eaten at all of these places for brunch alone ... and that's just a very short list. Little do they know (I don't really want to share), but there are lots of other establishments north of Queen that have great brunch options - one being Saturday Dinette. At 1pm, I thought I had skipped the lineups, but NO. You put your name down, they call you and if you opt to wait in the small front area, you will be let down knowing that others who have been called are coming back to claim their seat.

This place is bumpin'! The cool, casual, non-pretentious type, where the atmosphere is lively, the music is great, and the food is constantly being pumped out in the little kitchen. The service is friendly, patient, and easy going. When our table for 2 was finally seated almost 1:30, I was starving and knew what I was getting.... sadly, my  herbed eggs was sold out and given to the one table who ordered ahead of us. Bummer. No fret, all the other items on the menu made me salivate, and I went to the Mushroom toast instead (with a poached egg, not fried). My friend got the S'More buckwheat pancakes.

Finally the food comes and the first flavour is delicious. The flavours are bursting in your mouth and it is saucy, and well worth the wait. Each bite comes with new sensations and I was very impressed. The SMore pancakes was super unique. While it was very sweet, the taste of the buckwheat balanced out the entire dish...also something I have never experienced before.

All in all, a great meal.... I will be back to get those herbed eggs.... and need dinner here too.

See you soon Saturday Dinette!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Pretty good food, better than average service. Priced a bit high for the quality of food. My husband's burger was missing the string fries described in the menu. Maybe it's just me but I prefer chain store milkshakes over the milkshake I got here. My friend's cocktail looked great though! Would go back, probably for brunch instead of dinner."}
{"text":"This place is super cute and the prices are really affordable compared to what you usually see downtown. The location is quite inconvenient though if you're coming from the core. 

Food-wise, I would recommend the shrooms on toast - very yummy! Service was rather slow and inattentive though...I had to work hard to flag the waitress down. Also, this place can be quite busy during brunch hours so be prepared to wait a bit!"}
{"text":"We frequent this great local spot. The staff are all so friendly and the food has been consistently yummy. Love their vanilla milkshakes with burnt mashmallow, their breakfasts, and have been once for dinner, which was terrific. People started dancing spontaneously as we approached closing time!"}
{"text":"Popped in here on a rainy evening, and the ambiance was very warm and cozy. I love what they've done with the space, especially the patio lights strung across the ceiling; it feels like an intimate, candle-lit room. We ordered a small meal, but everything from the very creative menu tasted great. There were some unexpected flavours (especially the zucchini latkes) that were pleasantly surprising.  The service from everyone was very warm and welcoming. I'll have to go a few more times before I can give a full review of the food, but I definitely want to go back."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time. Food looked great however idk if it was my taste buds or the dish. It tasted like play doh to me. I got the herbed poach eggs. Maybe I should have subbed toast instead of the corn which gave the play dough taste. The chocolate buckwheat pancakes were the best thing that day  however it was way too sweet. My friend had the Dinette Brekkie and said it was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Great brunch spot in Leslieville! Diner style with hipster vibes all set with the vintage records and turntable and old cameras as display. Their brunch food was simple, but really well done. It had just the right touches that still made it unique and yet a very satisfying \"typical\" brunch menu. 

We got the Dinette Brekkie ($11) - Eggs, toast, tomatoes, grits and hash brown. All the ingredients felt really fresh and the tomatoes were excellent - oven baked I believe until almost dried then reheated in the grill again before serving. It added a great sweetness that complimented everything else. 

The Shrooms on Toast ($14) was also very tasty. Very fresh oyster(?) mushrooms with lavender ricotta, topped with eggs. 

Great coffee as well, comes in a French press, but they don't charge you an arm and a leg for it!

Definitely recommend this spot for brunch if you're in Leslieville. And even if you're not, it's worth the trip over!"}
{"text":"Only been there for brunch. Large portions, tasty food, friendly service. Shakshuka was the best I have ever had. Parmesan crisp in the 50/50 burger was a nice touch. Only wish is if you had espresso..."}
{"text":"- The service was good and friendly. However, it took half an hour for food to come out.
- I ordered 'Shroom on toast which is extremely salty that I could not finish it, and Shashuka is also salty but the tomatoes took away some of the saltiness. The breads were all burnt for these 2 dishes.
- I would say the price is expensive as compared to the quality of the food ($13-15).
- Will never come back 
1 star for the waitress."}
{"text":"Came by for brunch.  Great feeling, Real LP's playing for background music (bring some of your favourites to share).  Cozy and not too noisy.  Fun neighbourhood find.  We sat near the cook grill, so it was fun to watch and see the care in preparation of the food. My friend, who raved about he Burgundy French Onion Soup (only on the dinner menu) had the buckwheat pancakes with fruit compote and maple syrup - loved them (would order the syrup on the side next time). I had an egg dish with avocado on homemade crunchy toast.  A nice combination with a green salad and a citrus dressing.  We ordered the coconut mac n cheese - too watery and no real coconut kick.  
All in all a nice find, met some friends, chatted and enjoyed this neighbourhood diner - give it a try - plenty of options.  Will do dinner there next"}
{"text":"Just a lovely spot.   Great atmosphere.

But it took me over a year to finish my review of it.     And even then I can't really remember anything of any consequence about it.    Which must say something.

Clearly nothing bad happened.   Unless it did and somehow they were able to blank my mind using a fast acting poison.   But what are the chances of that?  If so... well played. 

I seem to remember it being expensive for what it was.   Then again, this is the land of the million dollar semi.  And I guess some people spend their lives collecting worthless chatchkas from the Franklin Mint and limited edition Coca-Cola cans.

So, recommended.  I think."}
{"text":"We ordered 2 appetizers and 2 entrees for dinner - 2 of the items tasted amazing where two were overly salty. 

Server was attentive and friendly, not what you would expect from a regular diner. Diner was small but cozy, it was an interesting night due to the unique dishes but not sure we will make another trip to the diner again."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday and tried the brunch.  The menu is varied as other posters have said, but more importantly it is delicious!  We were three mama's with babies and they were so accommodating, with Suzanne the owner chatting with us.  There seemed to be some regulars too, which was good to see.  I had the shrooms on toast which was filling and the ricotta was a nice surprise.  Everything was a nice twist on classic items and I want to go back again to try other stuff on the menu!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing meal at Saturday Dinette. As with Hammersmith's before, the space is open-concept, cozy, and has a great vibe. Staff was attentive and friendly and the prices were very fair for the excellent food.

After sampling bite of every dish on the table, everyone in the group was thoroughly impressed with everything and we ate every last bite of food. The coconut milk mac and cheese was really delicious. There were lots of vegetarian options and extremely tempting side dishes, appetizers, and milkshakes!"}
{"text":"Good vibe, varied and interesting menu, tasty food.

This restaurant has everything I look for in a brunch place. Lively, but not so lively that there was a line outside the door. A varied menu that has multiple things I'd want to go back and try, and so far anywys taste great. And has a cool vibe with good music in the background. Would definitely recommend it for brunch and I'd go back."}
{"text":"This is easily my top brunch spot in Toronto. It's a quint brunch place with a great menu. Everything looked amazing coming out from the kitchen, and their service was great! Even though, we changed our order after seeing the burger come out (we realized when we saw it coming out that we had to get it), and we changed our seating, they were still very accommodating and nice about it. 

On to the food, we had the hash browns, 'shrooms on toast and the burger. The burger was to die for! I was a little hesitant at first to get it for brunch but have zero regrets about it. 

I am coming back here. I loved it and can't wait to eat my way through the entire menu!"}
{"text":"Delicious food combined with attentive service. No tables were available so we grabbed a coffee at Nailed Espresso Bar and waited for our table. SD waved through the window our table was ready and off we went!  A great partnership ... Try their poached eggs on corn cake arepa with pea sprouts or their scrambled eggs with Trout and home fries--fresh and delicious!  Watching Suzanne and her team work the kitchen is awesome..."}
{"text":"This was our first visit; we really wanted to like it.  Food looks great, no doubt; however we were disappointed.  First off, French press coffee was so watered down; could have used twice as much coffee grounds. Second, the \"fresh\" orange juice tasted of concentrate. When my food arrived, it was room temperature. This is not normally a problem but I had sausage and toast in my dish. Flavours were really good; but they really need to up their game."}
{"text":"Did I get a \"lemon\" dish? 

I was so excited to eat here, the menu looked so interesting but I was so disappointed from my first bite. I got the shrooms toast and it was super salty. Tasted like there was a lb of salt in the dish leaving me thirsty for the rest of the day. I also didn't like how soggy the toast was with all the liquid from the mushroom but it looked good tho. My friend the pancake and fried chicken and she loved her dish. 

The resto is really small and bit crowded.  The back of my chair was tightly against another chair with no room to spare. Once you sit down, you are in position and you are not moving."}
{"text":"If you can get a table, well worth the wait! Everything is delicious. Staff is friendly. I had the chicken n pancakes, which I forgot what it was called but it was good. They use buckwheat pancakes so it's not as buttery. I would.prefer waffles but it was all very good regardless! $17. 

 Make a stop at hailed coffee next door, well worth the caffeine trip!"}
{"text":"We came here for the first time last week for lunch on a weekday and were pleasantly surprised by the genuinely friendly service and great food. I liked that there were plenty of vegetarian options, and my meat-eating partner enjoyed his food, too. I had the Dinette Brekkie and my partner the Biscuits and Gravy. Also nice that the restaurant has an employment training programme placing women from the YWCA."}
{"text":"Small, unassuming joint on the cusp of Riverdale/Leslieville.  The food is fresh, thoughtfully executed and affordable.  They make it look effortless, but you can tell a lot of love has gone into the restaurant.  The vibe is cool and the staff are friendly.  Kudos, so happy to see a restaurant get it right."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and have been very happy with the food, service and the vibe in general. The food is on the southern side, with a great assortment of dishes I'm very familiar with but each done with zest and flair that reflects the chef's respect for ingredients. Grits were lovely and I think last time I had a trout which was spectacular. Great tunes playing here and the staff are fantastic. I keep meaning to come by for dinner and am certain I will be nothing short of ecstatic about it.

Don't sleep on Dinette or the eastside in general."}
{"text":"Saturday Dinette is a modern diner that opened up in the Riverdale/Leslieville area a few months ago.  The diner offers a healthier take on classic comfort foods with dishes that incorporate local and worldly produce. 

The small diner seats 30 making the ambiance quite intimate and cozy. The space is littered with feminine art, vintage kitchen equipment, old-school vinyl and lovely hanging light bulbs strung across the ceiling. The creativity and flair is fluent throughout the diner which truly makes Saturday Dinette a welcoming neighbourhood gem. The diner has also implemented a great employment programme for staffing women from the YMCA Toronto who have an interest in the restaurant industry.

The food at Saturday Dinette ranges from ribs and burgers for the meat lovers and millet burgers and blackened tofu for the vegetarians.  Comfort foods such as beef brisket, savoury baked pies and liver & onions are some local favourites. Fries are not an option at this diner instead you can order candied plantains, polenta cakes, roasted vegetables or herbed smashed potatoes to accompany your meal.  Saturday dinette also serves cocktails, local beers and wine. 

I sampled some of the dishes during the opening of Saturday Dinette and everything was loaded with impeccable flavour. I was really impressed with the creativity that went into each dish and would love to go back to try some of the other menu items that Suzanne has created.

Fav dishes:

The ribs with sesame seeds and green papaya slaw - very fatty and juicy and full of flavour, top-notch ribs!!!

80/20 Beef Lamb Burger  - Two Patties, Beet Mayo, Daikon Slaw and Candied Plaintains - this burger was loaded with great flavour and I loved that it came with plantains instead of french fries. Much healthier and quite tasty too.

Great spot if you're in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Um, yeah.  First we ordered way too much food, all of which was awesome.  Our server was lovely and attentive.  Chilled atmosphere, great drinks (two carafes actually) and you have yourself a perfect neighbourhood spot."}
{"text":"What a delight! The small space, phenomenal food, and the minimal, colourful aesthetic makes it such a gem. Even though it was just a streetcar ride away, I felt like I was on a weekend getaway in the east end. The 'shrooms on toast were out of this world, but I think I'd opt for a cup of Sloane tea instead of the lime coconut milkshake (with blue cotton candy and rainbow sprinkles).

If there is a wait, head over to Hailed Coffee and get a cardamom spiked cortado, a ma'moul, and some dates from the date bar."}
{"text":"I have had dinner here twice and will definitely keep eating here. The food is fabulous, the atmosphere wonderful, the service is friendly and honest. It's the perfect place to sit back relax, eat, talk and laugh. Treat yourself to the yummiest diner food out there."}
{"text":"This place rocks!! I went for dinner and was really impressed with the food.  We had the bakala fritters, dirty rice, and the Pancakes with fried chicken.  All crazy good!! So the only reason I didn't rate this place 5 stars is that they didn't have things available on the menu, which as a first time diner is off putting, so be prepared.  The main reason we went was to try the Cuban sandwich which not available.  But that's ok,  I will go back!!"}
{"text":"TL;DR
A really cute but small breakfast diner to check out for some nice pics and good food in Leslieville. Slightly higher than average price.

------------

This spot is a busy brunch restaurant ideal for 2. It's a small diner that has really kitchy decorations and super chill staff. The cooks and wait staff all seem like cool people and definitely give off a nice vibe. You're kinda in just a long room one side with seating and one side with the kitchen which is a pretty cool setup but because they don't have AC it does get a little hot in the summer.

I can definitely see the possibility of wait times being long, but when my girlfriend and I went I think we were seated in under 10 mins (~11 AM Saturday). The food is BOMB! We got a Herbed Poached Egg and a Dinette Brekkie and they were great! BTW my phone is super old and I just wanted to grab quick pictures but the decorations or vibe of the diner just automatically look like summin' you can just toss on Instagram lol. Everything really cute and the food is dope. I also grabbed their Iced Frappe and that was DELICIOUS. I'd definitely recommend grabbing that if it's hot and you craving your coffee.

I'm not usually in that area but it is definitely a spot worth visiting. Not sure if it's a must return for me because there are a couple more brunch spots I want to check out in Leslieville but after that I might update the review to see if I'll come back. I guess the thing that would deter me right now is that I feel like I may have eaten brunches of similar or better quality for the price.

Overall, good brunch in a small spot in Leslieville."}
