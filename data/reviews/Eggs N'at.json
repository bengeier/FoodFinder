{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat real breakfast. No fake eggs. No garbage Sysco food. They have excellent pancakes and change them up throughout the seasons. The owner is fantastic. The food is fantastic. What else can I say!? The only bad thing is if you're not there early, prepare to wait because its tiny inside and everyone wants to eat there."}
{"text":"it looks like a hole in the wall, but then aren't most hidden treasures located where we least expect to find them?  Yes, it's small.  I prefer to describe it as \"cozy\".  Parking is sometimes a challenge.  But isn't that a sign of success?  

I love this little neighborhood spot.  I'm a big fan of breakfast anytime, mostly because I have trouble getting up in time to eat breakfast out.  Pancakes, eggs, sausage ... everything was cooked just the way I like it.  The service was fast and friendly.  It felt like home ... except I could leave the cooking and clean up to someone else!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on our way thru town thanks to Yelp reviews.  Delicious veggie omelet and hash browns, everyone else enjoyed their dishes including the delish Eggs Benedict.  Mary's service was great and the owner is a pro in the kitchen!"}
{"text":"Super friendly & a variety of yummy pancakes :) love love love  EGGS 'n' @!!  I Love the owner Kelly, she is sooooo super Awesome !! Stop 'N' eat Yinz Guys"}
{"text":"This is not a fancy place, but it is great. Will go here many more times. Good food, good portions, good service. Parking is a mess but the cozy atmosphere is worth it."}
{"text":"Great breakfast! Order the Eggs-N-at special: Two eggs, three sausage, pile of home fries, toast, and a pancake for $8.50! Very good food and the best coffee around. Super service and nice atmosphere. Back patio in summer makes great place for morning coffee and breakfast. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Good food served piping hot.  Super friendly staff.  If I were a local it would become a habit."}
{"text":"Was recommended this place by a P-burgher a few months back when staying at one of the hotels on the University Boulevard strip.  Said hotel had a rather crummy \"free\" breakfast so I was happy to have a diner option.  I like diners.  

It is unfortunate, however, that the one day I had to check out Eggs N'at was the morning after I had been up most of the night boozing with said P-burgher and pals, so I did not make it out for brunch till the crack of noon, by which time teeny Eggs N'at and its equally teeny and weirdly tilted parking lot were jam packed like the Mall of America on Black Friday (it was a game day weekend for pro and college teams, the entire University Boulevard strip was full).  As my cheapo rental car putt-putted around the lot in the hot sun, I considered skipping the whole thing, especially in view of Eggs N'at's well-known early closing time, which would leave me barely an hour to scarf my food after getting a seat, but then somebody pulled out of a spot right in front of me (as opposed to the three other cars also futilely circling the lot) so I figured it was Fate.    

I lumbered inside and after a mere few minutes got a seat at the counter.  It was so crowded there I was practically sitting in the lap of the strange guy next to me and just hoping that in my bleary eyed state I wouldn't elbow a cup of coffee into his crotch.  It was so freaking busy in there that getting the waitress' attention even from 2 feet away was like trying to buy a beer at a sold-out Pogues show on St. Patrick's Day.  But, I persisted.  And now comes the reason for my only-three-stars rating:

They were OUT of the Crabby Eggs Benedict.  

Y'see, I never, never order Eggs Benedict.  I used to, a long time ago, but then got told that it's generally composed of the slop from other food and is an unsafe and yucky thing to ingest.  There was even a story about a famous basement bar that I used to eat in during my Bright College Days, composing its Eggs Benedict sauce from whatever the fancy restaurant above happened to dump down the drain that day.   But, my P-burgh buddy said Crabby Eggs Benedict was the way to go at Eggs N'at, so I steeled myself, I mentally prepared myself to take a chance on something I normally would run from in a diner like the Black Plague on a bun.  

And they were out!  Well, I ordered something anyway, I think it was some variation of eggs and toast, and it was good, and I ate too much, and that was that.  But, my life will not be complete until I check this Crabby Eggs Benedict off my bucket list.  When that happens, I will feel complete again, and hopefully I won't be hungover that day, and  I will update this review."}
{"text":"Best breakfast food I've had in a really long time if not ever. I wanted to give the cook a hug after eating my Juevos Rancheros. It was that good. Highly recommend those. My friends got the beef hash and the Arizona omelet and I tried both of theirs and it was great as well. We sat outside so I can't comment on the interior but as good and cheap as the food was I wouldn't have cared if it was tiny. Two thumbs up in my book."}
{"text":"Cute little hole in the wall, hometown diner.  (Parking is out back, we overshot the drive so be on the lookout.)  Just what you'd expect and a WHOLE lot better than Eat n' Park.  If you're on the west side of the 'Burgh near the airport, skip Eat n' Park and eat here, if you're looking for breakfast or brunch.  I imagine if you're going at peak times the wait might be long.  We were early on a Sunday morning (9-ish) and with a party of 3 adults + 1 kid, didn't need to wait.  Friendly wait staff, too.  I just wish they'd had the AC on!"}
{"text":"Local,  cheap breakfast food... Food not awful but needs cleaned top to bottom,  we were seated by the back door with kids in freezing temps and left sitting for ages,  we had to leave,  have eaten there before,  it's \"ok\""}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast. I'm new to the area and have been in search of a good breakfast place that's not a chain. I have finally found it!  The food here was hot and delicious. It really is quite a small place but I was seated in 5 mins. I will be returning."}
{"text":"The food is always good.  Sometimes the service is slow..  Never had a bad thing here.  You can't go wrong.
A definite come as you are place."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hype is about. Very small seating area and it took a long time to get seated. Then, even longer to order. Our food was delayed as well for unknown reasons, never explained. The chocolate chip pancakes my daughter ordered looked like they just threw some chip in the middle of the pancakes and not very many. The pancakes were thin and not like the photos here.  I ordered the breakfast pizza with eggs, cheese, bacon, and sausage. The menu states it comes on a crisp pizza dough. It came on a piece of bread, I guess they were out of the pizza dough. It would have been better on toast. About the worst breakfast pizza I've ever had. The rum raisin French toast my wife ordered was very good though. Coffee was not good and had grounds in the cup. It was not cheap either. $10 for the \"breakfast pizza\". It also took over 2 hours!  Save your money and go to iHop. The food is better and cheaper. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I simply love this place.  It may be small but the food is big.  Suggestions on what to order?  Try it all...  We here in Pittsburgh have it lucky, we aren't stuck with big chain restaurants and have the choice to stick with the home cooked meals from family owned businesses.  You won't regret going here for sure."}
{"text":"I've been going to Eggs N'at about once a month for the last few years.  I've never dined on the deck, as I try to avoid eating outside as often as I can. 

I typically order coffee and the \"Eggs N'at,\" which comes with eggs, a choice of toast, a choice of pancake, a choice of meat, and a choice of potato (or tomato slices for a lower calorie option, which is typically what I get).

Pros:  The breakfast food is consistently high quality, the service is typically great, and the menu has some great variety and (I think) is priced fairly.

Cons:  The parking lot is kind of a pain in the backside, they close at 2:00 pm, and the dining areas can get noisy and cramped (especially on weekends).

In terms of space, Eggs N'at is the perfect place for a party of 2-4.  Anything more than that, you're not going to be comfortable, and you're going to make fellow patrons uncomfortable as well.

I noticed previous reviewers have rated this place as \"good for kids,\" and I would like to strongly disagree with that assessment.  There aren't any booths, it's cozy with just adults in the room, there are a lot of college students who patronize the place so sometimes conversations aren't \"family friendly,\" and the noise level can get to a level that I would say is probably overwhelming for babies' ears.   I strongly suggest if you've got a child/children who is/are under 12 that you go somewhere other than Eggs N'at."}
{"text":"I went there for the first time on Sunday. Breakfast was very good and the staff was very friendly, but the wait was long both before getting seated and waiting for our meals. I will go back, but probably not until it warms up and they have their additional outside seating available."}
{"text":"Great little joint for cheap, good breakfast. I had the veggie breakfast burrito with sour cream and salsa, my husband had the veggie omelette and we shared an order of chocolate chip  banana pancakes. The home fries were really good, crispy! The rest was solid breakfast/hang over food. The parking is in the back and there is limited seating.  But overall a good little breakfast place."}
{"text":"Good breakfast fare.  Atmosphere is diner minmalist.  Theme of 70s album covers adorn the walls.  There is also a pittsburghese theme running in the menu and on the t-shirts of employees.  Prices are average to above aveeage.  Omlettes well prepared.   Crabby eggs benedict will run you$ 9.50.   Coffee is bad.  Weak and poor quality beans.  Get yourselves a good roaster guys.  Try Kiva Han.  Still like place and would recommend over chains in area.  Locally owned."}
{"text":"Good breakfast, mid range prices. Don't be in a rush Sunday mornings early as they're packed. Friendly service. Outside deck seating is awesome"}
{"text":"Sooooooo good! Caramelized apple pancakes were perfection and the service was equally as good :-))))))"}
{"text":"Really great classic diner style food. I had the Canadian bacon and eggs (over easy) and it came with home fries and toast. The eggs were perfectly cooked, dippy yolk but a nice set white. The Canadian bacon was slightly sweet but not overly so. I had rye toast, which was maybe the best toast I've had recently when dining out. It was nice and crunchy without being burnt, plus it wasn't drowned or soggy from too much butter. The potatoes were a bit salty for my taste, but still cooked well.
The servuce was really great as well. Very friendly server and not too long if a wait, despite how busy it was."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place with a home like feel but food you just can't replicate. Anything you get will be amazing and there triple stack of pancakes are very cheap and amazing if you're into omelette I definitely recommend the Arizona omelette I can eat one every single day. This place towers over delucas in quality!"}
{"text":"Love this place. It's my favorite interview spot. Coffee good and eggs and potatoes are great."}
{"text":"We passed up A couple of chain restaurants to go here and it was a good choice. We sat on the cozy deck and had a leisurely breakfast; I had a huge sausage-egg-cheese burrito and it was delicious. Friendly, attentive service too."}
{"text":"Two words: forget Pamela's. 

Now, as a native Pittsburgher, I understand both the deliciousness and the cult following of Pamela's. I love that they have expanded, and they have their place in the breakfast space. But, Eggs N'at is better. Hands down.

The cheese may stand alone on this one, but I submit that until you head west to this adorably folksy and TINY breakfast nook that is Eggs N'at, you have no room to talk. I have dreams about this place, specifically the BLT Egg Burrito. The pancakes are fluffy and the breakfast kielbasa is just the thing to get your weekend started right.

Eggs N'at is in a tiny house with a really awkward sloped parking lot out back (the only downside in my book), and it's fun to sit at the counter and peek into the kitchen. The cooks make magic in a space that is no bigger than a twin bed. Their collection of funny and local (Kennywood and RMU) coffee mugs that look like they were randomly pulled out of your grandmother's cabinet will make you feel right at home, especially because of the friendly locals serving you.

In adition to the delicious food, which you simply must try, their t-shirts are hilarious. Bring $10 in cash because you won't want to walk out of here without buying one for yourself. My personal favorite says \"Gitadda Tahn.\" True yinzer love here, people."}
{"text":"Great place and well worth the wait.  My husband had the Ironworker and marveled over crispy potatoes and fluffy, perfect pancakes.  The marble rye warm, crunchy and buttery.  I had the rum raisin French toast.   Caramelized outside and cinnamon delight within.  A side of kielbasa glazed ever so slightly with barbecue sauce was the perfect complement.  Service was prompt and friendly.  The only downside was a very generic and bland coffee.  Watch out Pamela's.  Eggs n at is out to win the breakfast game."}
{"text":"I love this place! The eggs benedict is probably my favorite breakfast and the do a fine job. The place gets packed and is small, but I normally go solo so I never wait for a bar stool. Parking can be an issue because the spot is behind the building and is fairly small. They have an outside deck for those beautiful mornings. The staff is nice, but don't get to converse much, but not due to a lack of friendliness but due to being so darn busy. I definately recoomend visiting."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the unimpressive exterior.  This is a really decent breakfast joint.  Location is Moon township near the airport.  The interior is clean and modern.  The breakfast food is traditional fare but well prepared with good ingredients and no grease.  Service is friendly with a smile.  I park next door when I go out of town.  From now on I am going to build a little extra time into my trip to stop and have breakfast here."}
{"text":"Totally dug this little diner.  Awesome food.  Great service.  Best kept secret.  Had eggs w/ chorizo and rye toast.  Breakfast burritos looked delish, too.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Stoped in and had the western omelet and coffee. Stellar as usual. Plan on a wait on the weekends as the place is really small."}
{"text":"If you haven't been the you need to go. This is an establishment that I wish was better known because their food and attitudes are great but, at the same time, I want to be able to get in when I'm back in the 'Burgh. 
All their food is good but the pancakes... And the chorizo... Oh my goodness. 
Just go, my description isn't going to do it justice!"}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast here with super friendly service. Breakfast potatoes are classic, like your grandma would make. So good. Generous potions. Good bang for your buck. We'll definitely be back. Waitress terrific with our three year old too :)"}
{"text":"Had a lovely brunch on a Sunday morning. Place is pretty hopping but we got promptly seated. The decor is unpretentious but comfortable and the staff was friendly. The food is really good, like a delicious home cooked brunch. It tastes fresh, flavorful, and the prices are very reasonable, especially considering the portion size! Didn't get hungry until a late dinner that night! It's a little out of the way for us but I'd definitely would go back there."}
{"text":"Tiny place. Easy to pass by... and if that happens turn back. All four of us loved our meal. My brother even reordered a second breakfast sandwich. Excellent! Revisited today and posted a pic my breakfast plate"}
{"text":"Hands down the best breakfast in Moon Township. I love that the owner is usually on the premises. The waitstaff is friendly and competent. Food is delicious. The cooks crank out a lot of food quickly. I just love the place."}
{"text":"My son and I typically do not eat \"breakfast food\" but after an early morning practice we decided to try Eggs N'at. So glad we did. The Oatmeal Raisin Pancakes were the  best pancakes we ever had. Eggs Benedict, strawberry pancakes and homefries were great. Will definitely go back and try huevos rancheros and breakfast pizza's."}
{"text":"Favorite breakfast place in the Pittsburgh area. Staff is amazing and food is prompt, delicious, and affordable. In and out in 30 mins! Even when it's packed (which it always is)."}
{"text":"This restaurant is phenomenal. My mother and I came in for breakfast and could not be happier. I got a sausage egg and cheese sandwich on Italian, and she got the same but with Canadian bacon and we both got sides of their breakfast potatoes. The waitress was friendly as could be and very attentive. The atmosphere was exactly what you'd expect from a Pittsburgh diner (except much cleaner). The coffee was average, as to be expected. When we got our food, oh man. Take my advice and get the breakfast potatoes. Get two orders. They are the best I've ever had, and I have no idea how they do it. I was practically scraping my plate clean.  Also, the bread for my sandwich was delicious. 

Also price: I was amazed at how cheap their menu is. I've had much more expensive food for half the taste.

Be careful with parking, though. The lot is a littl awkward. Also the diner itself is very small.

I would keep coming here every day if I could. I love a good diner, and breakfast is my favorite thing in the world, especially when it's done right."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in town, & around the area! If you're looking for a greasy spoon kind of feel with delicious breakfast options this is is. 
They might have the best pancakes.. go with banana/ bacon 
I would also like to give props to them for going earth friendly and using biodegradable straws, & wood stirrers. Every thing counts! Way to Go!

I wish they would play the music louder!"}
{"text":"I would give 4.5 if I could. Nice selection of breakfast items to choose from. Folks working there were extremely friendly and kind. They accept cash and plastic, seems like a lot of little breakfast places only take cash. I had an Arizona omelette with egg beaters. Very good. Fried potatoes were great too. Big breakfast and the bill was only $10. Great value, good food, nice staff. Try it, you'll like it."}
{"text":"Definitely a must-try if you're in the area.  I stayed at a motel a block or so from here and decided to treat myself to breakfast.  I got strawberry chocolate chip pancakes like the big kid I am and they were tasty!  

But really, what stood out about this place were the employees and other customers.  I'd go back just to people watch (in a non-creepy way).  The employees seemed to know most of the customers there and they cared.  They would ask questions, talk about family and such.  It was so much fun to get this small town feeling.

The employees were also just generally fantastic at their jobs.  I was never low on water or coffee and they asked me several times how everything was even though the place was kind of busy at the time!  So a big THANK YOU to the employees of Eggs N'at and keep being awesome!"}
{"text":"Great little local diner! The breakfast is what you have to go there for. If you aren't accustomed the Pittsburgh accent, like this Virginian, be prepared. The omelets, eggs and sausage, and pancakes are fantastic. The biscuits N' gravy are eh(what can I say, I'm a little biased), but the biscuits by themselves are phenomenal. If you love breakfast as much as I do, you owe it to yourself to stop in."}
{"text":"Great breakfast!  I can eat a lot of food and even I had a hard time finishing all of my food.  And, it was less than ten bucks!!!  (Not including the well deserved tip of course)."}
{"text":"Up early running errands near Moon Township , haven't had my coffee yet I look at my wife and say \"breakfast\" she relies of course, \"where\" . I go to Yelp look up breakfast near by it gave a number of options but we like mom & pops places so we here we are.  Its a local place that was packed with good customers, friendly faces, bountiful plates and fantastic service.  They only do breakfast which I thought was great because they do it extremely well. I had pancakes eggs & sausage. My wife had home fries, eggs, pancakes and sausage...Both selections were can't miss the home fries were terrific fried perfectly and tasted like more. Maybe because the place is located near RMU the prices are like 1990 price. This is now are #1 breakfast go to place. Great experience."}
{"text":"Stopped here with the parents before heading home to Ohio.  Glad we did!  I loved the Rum raisin bread French toast!!  Coffee was very good to ( I am picky) a bit stronger than most places (hate coffee flavored water!!).  Eggs were cooked to perfection and dad liked the hashbrowns.  Great selection, prices, and everything we got was yummy.  Just a little hole in the wall... But I love places like this.  Had a nice back patio you can eat on!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here 5/28/16, Service was excellent, had a table within just a few minutes. Four people and we all had full platters, good coffee refill, and our waitress managed to pay attention despite having a full group of people inside and on the porch. The blueberry pancakes were full of fresh fruit, eggs were perfect regardless of style, toast was not burned even along the edges, and the sausages and bacon were fresh, not greasy, and perfectly made. This place was recommended by some police officers who work in Moon. We will stop here anytime we are in this area for a good meal. Closest I have come to a real diner like New Jersey ones. Attorney29"}
{"text":"Customer service could have been a little better, my waitress seemed a little depressed. This place is a cool little spot (literally,  I had to dine on the patio) They have a large selection of foods though. I ordered the Famous Eggs N'at which comes with toast, eggs hashbrowns and bacon. They give you a lot of bang for your buck. Toast 1-5=4. Eggs 1-5=4. Hash 1-5=5. Bacon 1-5=4."}
{"text":"You know when you pull into a breakfast joint and there are three state police cars there it's great food or safe ... in this case it was great food. Friendly service, great food, freshly prepared."}
{"text":"awesome food great diner atmosphere.  Can be crowded and is cash only but it's well worth the visit."}
{"text":"They had me at homemade sausage gravy. Seriously, my two biggest complaints about diners or breakfast joints are canned gravy and canned hash. Both are not difficult to make, and make such a huge difference.

Eggs N'at is not a huge place. Seating is a little tight, but that's okay. They turn tables pretty quick and have high volume in a short period with a closing time of 2 p.m.

I ordered a pancake, two eggs over medium, ham, a biscuit and gravy and a large chocolate milk. My bill was $12, which is nothing for what I ordered. Pancake was great. Had those crisp edges I love, and the syrup didn't taste store-bought, though I did not ask. Eggs were perfectly cooked, which believe it or not is something NY diners tend to struggle with, and the ham was a nice portion with no fat on it.

I come into Pittsburgh on business quite often, and am so glad I found this place for when I stay near the airport. I will gladly walk here for breakfast every day I'm here."}
{"text":"It was a lovely hole-in-the-wall breakfast restaurant. I had the pumpkin pancakes, chorizo sausage, eggs and homefries. It was all delicious. My fiancé got the crabby eggs Benedict, which were cooked perfectly. We would definitely come back."}
{"text":"This should be  the only place permitted  to serve breakfast. Great ppl small place but cheap prices for great food."}
{"text":"What a great little find. 
Small, nothing fancy to look at, and you have to park the bottom of the hill out back, but my breakfast was great. This is clearly a spot the locals like, and I'll be back the next time I stay in one of the local hotels. 

My corned beef hash special this morning was delicious. The homemade hash had chunky home fries and fresh corned beef that wasn't dry. My eggs were cooked perfectly and the raisin toast was good too. Their assortment of breakfast burritos were a popular item and looked huge. 

I have to agree with another Yelp review in that the crowd here is unplugged. From the graphic conversation at the next table about one of the guys .45 Magnum security system, to the college girl having coffee and experimenting with ring tones for 20 minutes, to a table of suits planning a coworkers demise. Not a place to bring the kids for breakfast, but there was a certain entertainment value. Won't stop me from coming back though."}
{"text":"The worst food I've ever had. I went to the hospital the same day I ate there. I don't recommend it at all."}
{"text":"Always good food, never disappoints! Great atmosphere! Reasonable prices for a great breakfast that won't leave you hungry!"}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast place in town. Their pancakes are phenomenal and your coffee cup never goes empty."}
{"text":"An \"EGG\"traordinary local alternative to the usual chain fair found at B. Evans, IHOP,  V. Inn, et al.  

My companion and I wanted to experience another \"Burghian\" delight without traveling too far from the airport district. Initially we wanted to revisit Pamela's, but because our agenda required we stay outside of Pittsburgh proper, we opted for the Egg Nat Diner.  We were not disappointed. After a discussion with our waitress, we chose the Juevos Rancheros and Corned Beef Hash Combo.  Both of which, added a Pittsburgh Twist, to a couple of time-honored breakfast selections. The JR is a mash-up of scrambled eggs, chorizo sausage, onions and cheese served over a bed of nacho chips with a side of chunky tomato salsa. I requested the half order and what arrived was a huge plate full of flavor and just enough spice to make this a wonderfully savory dish. The CBH was a nice surprise; real potatoes and ground corned beef! WOW! I gagged when my partner chose this combo. Corned beef hash from a diner?...PLEASE!  But I knew she had chosen well when that steaming mound of fresh cut home fries and delicately cured beef was presented to her. The Egg Nat is a must do \"LOCAL\" Pittsburgh experience worthy of the drive north of town."}
{"text":"A small place on University Blvd. with fresh home cooked diner-like portions.  If you don't know it's there you'll pass it right up to go to the big chain restaurants on the Blvd., skip those and try this place! 

Breakfast at a local place is well worth the wait (and with less than 10 tables there very well may be one) on nice days they serve on the back patio also. With hearty portions and attentive staff who never let the coffee go past 1/2 empty, the service is as good as the food."}
{"text":"I had the best-ever Greek omelette in this cozy, friendly diner which is decorated with framed LP albums from the 70's."}
{"text":"We tried Eggs N'at for the first today. We parked in the back and there was plenty of room on a Saturday at 12:30.  They have a few tables outside on a covered deck with a nice view and gentle breeze. 

Our server arrived quickly and was terrifically perky and sweet! She pointed out some of the favorites when we told her it was our first visit.

The food comes out very fast and piping hot. I tried the western omelet with home fries and Italian toast. 

It was Eggcellent!!! Get it?! 

Seriously, very tasty. Right amount of seasoning on the eggs and good proportion of sautéed red onion, green peppers, ham, and gooey cheese. The home fries had a light orangish colored seasoning on them that was delicious. 

We also tried a small order of the rum raisin French toast. It was really sweet and needed a little longer soak in the egg bath for my taste. Pretty good though.

They also serve lunch but get there early because they close at 2pm. 

We will definitely try it again."}
{"text":"This is not fine dining, it's a breakfast/lunch place. And for that it's perfect. Great food, and plenty of it. Potatoes seasoned perfectly. Steak thick, a bit chewy like you expect in a diner, not gristly. I could have used more Hollandaise on my Eggs Benedict, but it was clearly made on site and delicious, not that mix crap that's used in other places. 
Service is pleasant and hopping fast. Decor has framed 80s album covers, what fun! And the T shirts have 'Burgh slang; I'm gettin' one and yinz should, too."}
{"text":"I ate the Greek breakfast pizza. It was so good. I thought it was going to be shaped like a regular pizza. But it wasn't... staff were very friendly and helpfully"}
{"text":"The food is delicious - blueberry pancakes with bacon IN the batter?! - and the staff is warm and welcoming. Pure Pittsburgh diner plus an outdoor deck with a scenic view. Easily my favorite breakfast/lunch spot."}
{"text":"The food was fairly good, but I walked away feeling pretty underwhelmed.  The prices were about what I expected, and the food largely fine, but our drinks were never refilled, and it took more than a few minutes after we finished eating for the check to come, despite our server walking in front of us every minute or two.

I also thought the hashbrowns were lackluster.  It's personal preference, but I got big chunks of barely fried, minimally seasoned potatoes, whereas I like the potatoes to be more finely diced, seasoned, and crispy."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Moon Twp.  Hometown vibe, friendly, delicious breakfast with a lot of options."}
{"text":"Attentive, friendly service and a great breakfast!! Ordered banana chocolate chip pancakes and rum raisin French toast... both were to die for. Will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"I really was not all that impressed with this place.  I got the mixed grill and it was like a bland pile of mush. Perhaps it was a mistake to go on a Sunday mid day. The servers were attentive however it took a long time for food to come out.  Between waiting for our food and waiting to be seated we were there for over two hours."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. I've been here a few times, and the food has been consistently delicious. It is the perfect breakfast food. I also love how thoroughly \"Pittsburgh\" it feels there. The restaurant is very small, so I recommend avoiding peak times if possible (Saturday and Sunday at 11am, for example), but even if you do go then, the wait is not very long. The service is quick. The downside is that if you do have to wait, there's not a waiting area, so you sort of get smushed into a corner to wait for a table. If it's nice out, they do have a patio, which is a good option. All the servers are friendly. I always leave feeling that I have been treated well, ate well, and got my money's worth. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Yum!! Traffic place to eat, found it on Yelp while traveling, great service, tasty food, good coffee! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for the first time yesterday for breakfast. It looked really small and the parking situation was a little odd, so I wasn't expecting much. Wow, was I wrong! This place was really good. The service was good and food was delicious. My husband got the Arizona omelette, which included potatoes. I got Strawberry Chocolate Chip pancakes and added an egg and sausage. I've never seen Strawberry Chocolate Chip pancakes on a menu and I'm so glad I got them! For a Saturday morning, we did not have to wait; however, the place isn't very big and there were people waiting while we were there. It's worth it, though, for the food and true diner experience!"}
{"text":"Pretty good little place on University. Reasonably priced and you won't leave hungry. 
I had crabby Benedict. Basically a Benedict with crab added on top of the bacon. Good home fries too. Wife had corned beef hash. She wasn't impressed. Still all in all a good breakfast."}
{"text":"Hate giving this place 5* don't want it to become too popular lol. Excellent food super friendly staff and love the open kitchen. Can't wait to get back to PITT so I can go again!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place very friendly and great food.  Would definitely return again.   A little home that was converted into a restaurant has a hometown feel to it."}
{"text":"Just your good old fashion diner. Right off of University Blvd Eggs N'at is inside a small building so be prepared to wait for a table on the weekends, but the service is excellent and you'll be in and out before you know it.

They serve all the traditional breakfast meals and have a few seasonal treats like Pumpkin pancakes in the fall that are delicious.

I usually go with the traditional eggs breakfast and can vouch that they have some great bacon! Thick and not too crispy! :)"}
{"text":"Nothing beats a homemade breakfast, but when I woke up this rainy Sunday morning I realized our refrigerator was quite empty.  A trip to the grocery store?  Nope.  My guy and I decided to check out Eggs N'at.  

We arrived around 10:00, sometime between the old early birds and the church crowd.  We sinners get a table without waiting.  

Our waitress seated us in the corner, which was a nice spot to people watch while perusing the menu.  We were both drawn to the idea of a breakfast pizza so we decided to share half a Greek Pizza and the Vegetable & Cheese Omelet.  We added ham to the omelet, which was served with home fries and toast.

The topping for the Greek Pizza was delicious.  Nice, salty olives and plenty of spinach and tomatoes were mixed in with tasty feta and scrambled eggs.  But the crust?  Not my thing.  At all.  It reminded me of an undercooked Boboli shell and I refused to eat it.  Instead I picked the topping off of the crust, which satisfied my craving for feta and olives.

The Vegetable & Cheese Omelet was just about perfect.  It was packed full of ham, tomatoes, green peppers, onions, mushrooms, cheddar and provolone.  The home fries had nice, crispy edges and after adding salt & pepper I quickly scarfed them down.  The cinnamon raisin toast added just the right touch of sweetness to the meal.

The service was great, nothing was greasy and I left satisfied, albeit a little confused by that pizza crust."}
{"text":"Amazing little diner. Food was outstanding; so many options on the menu. Probably the friendliest waitress and best service I've had in a very long time."}
{"text":"A great local breakfast nook. While small in space the place is big on breakfast. Indoor and outdoor seating for this quaint location, You'll have a great breakfast for low cost. Lots of local 'Burgh charm. Great for parties of 1-4, you could squeeze 6 in but too tiny for much more than that. Do yourself a favor try Eggs N'At!"}
{"text":"Really excellent breakfasts!  The place looks tiny, however there is lots of parking around back.  The staff were very friendly and the service was fast.  It is worth noting that the portions are large.  The home fries are simple but very good, cooked the old fashioned way.  Eggs N'at is a wonderful alternative to a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Great little find. Staff very hospitable and outgoing. Food amazingly tasty. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Holy local diner, Batman!  My boyfriend took me here for breakfast, warning me beforehand that we might not even be able to get in on account of its size and popularity.  I loves me a good breakfast-brunch-lunch-only restaurant, and you couple that with a good old Pittsburgh \"N'at\", and I was raring to go. Well, the only good thing about the lousy icy weather that morning is that it seemed to keep people away, and we were able to get seated right away during prime breakfast eatin' time.

Our waitress was super friendly, fast, and didn't miss a beat when I asked her for \"dippy eggs\".  I got the Eggs N 'at house special (2 eggs, meat, home fries, 2 pancakes, and toast), and the boyfriend got the Ironworker, which is essentially the same thing, but more.  That's a lot of food, and the price is super reasonable, but most of all, it was DELICIOUS.  They had just started serving a hot sausage as a meat option, which I got, and it was a really great compliment to my sweet cinnamon raisin bread and bites of blueberry pancake I kept alternating with.  In the end, I could only finish about half of everything, however, and it's probably for the best.  Had I busted a gut, I probably would've started making a negative association with Eggs N' at, and we don't want that!

Other notables include great classic rock album covers on the wall (and playing throughout), as well as random coffee mugs--no two are the same.  I dig that.

All in all, this is such a solid breakfast diner that I almost don't want to spread the word, because there will come a time when icy weather will not keep other patrons away at breakfast time."}
{"text":"Small, \"down-home\" kinda diner with great food. It may seem simple, but you'll be pleasantly surprised; they don't skip on quality. Staple Pittsburgh breakfast stop. Always friendly staff."}
{"text":"This place gets absolutely packed, for good reason. Scratch made breakfast in a tiny cozy atmosphere including a breakfast bar to contribute to the diner feel. I've raved about this place numerous times and have taken many of my friends there all had positive things to say about it. I love all the omelettes and home fries are great! I'd recommend ordering for takeout to avoid wait times!"}
{"text":"Delicious pumpkin pancake with scrambled egg whites an bacon..Great taste and service! Owner on hand to oversee that each dish is made to order!"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast spot in the Robinson/Moon area. They are a small place so it can get crowded, and the parking lot is tiny, but don't let that deter you. They have amazing breakfast food for very good prices and excellent service. I recommend trying one of the pancakes or the rum raisin french toast with whatever you get."}
{"text":"Everything you're looking for in a \"Ma n Pa\" diner. Clean seating area, friendly staff, affordable prices. I ordered the veggie egg and cheese burrito, my friend got the eggs Benedict -- Both dishes were delivered within 15 minutes of being ordered. When they ask if you'd like the breakfast \"Kelly's home fries\", definitely say \"yes please\"! Overall great experience, so happy we stopped in this little gem."}
{"text":"A trip to Pittsburgh is never complete without a breakfast from Eggs N'at. This place has magic in its grill. There is no other way to describe the fantastic flavor ALL of their menu items have. Go in pick what feels good and I guarantee it will more than satisfy every urge!"}
{"text":"Highly recommended!
I was in town for business, and the restaurant was walking distance from my hotel. My co-worker, who comes to PIT a lot, told me this restaurant, so I wanted to try it. 
I dined in here two days in a row! That's how good their food was!

First day, I came in around 8:30am on Monday, and it was't too busy. I don't usually eat big breakfast (especially carbs), but I read reviews prior, and pancakes and home fries seemed to be good, so I decided to order Eggs N'at with sausages and a blueberry walnut pancake. 

I waited about 20 minutes to get food. The food looked good and very fresh. They used fresh blueberries on my pancake, and it was very good! Kelly's home fries was good. It had enough seasoning. It was crispy and soft at the same time. 

Since the food was so good, I had to come back the next morning. I came in around the same time, but It was busier. I waited 30 minutes to get my food. 
I got the same dish, but this time with banana walnut pancake. 
The food was still good. The banana walnut pancake was good, but I only got a few slices of bananas, and pancake was smaller than the day prior.

The portions were huge, but the prices were very reasonable. 
I would definitely come back here whenever I'm in town."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!!! We are a breakfast family and both times we've dined here for breakfast, we have been very pleased!!! It's totally worth the wait! The service is very friendly and timely. The food is delicious and not your typical diner food. They have the BEST Greek omelette I've ever had!! My son is in his first year at a local college, and I look forward to eating here many more times while he lives in the area."}
{"text":"The place is tiny but Our server ABIGAIL was amazing! She was very sweet, pleasant and attentive. Their menu items were great but their food was even better! I got the \"Ironworker\" which was plenty of food for me. it includes 2 pancakes AND you get to chose from an array of pancakes flavors which was awesome! The pancakes tasted as if they were made them from scratch; they were fluffy!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place for breakfast.  I had heard so many good things from other people, but I have to say I was disappointed. I ordered bacon, eggs, home fries, with one pancake.  My daughter got the short stack of chocolate chip pancakes with a side of sausage and home fries.  The home fries were luke warm, the sausage was weird tasting, and the pancakes were ok, I could have made them at home.  The bacon and the scrambled eggs were the best thing on my plate.  I just think that it's a little over priced and over hyped for $35 plus tip, I made the same breakfast at home and it was way better.  Next time I will just opt for cooking breakfast at home and save some money.  This was a huge disappointment we had been waiting so long to come here to."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and I have to say its a great breakfast spot. Portions are big and the pancakes are amazing."}
{"text":"It was our first time to Pittsburgh and we had no idea where to go for breakfast. Eggs N'at was highly rated and  it didn't disappoint at all! My wife had a pancake with strawberries and blueberries and their home fries which were excellent. I couldn't make up my mind and got a breakfast burrito which was good too but I'd probably get some different next time. The servers were friendly and the price was right! We ate for less $15! I'd definitely suggest checking them out!"}
{"text":"Being from out of town and loving diners - I definitely recommend this place.     From a far - it appears you are eating at someone's house.   The parking may be intimidating because you have to park behind the restaurant and down the hill (in Pittsburgh, like Seattle - everything is on a hill).

You walk up the stairs and see outdoor seating - it looks like it would be the place to sit during the summer, spring and fall.    You walk in the very small updated restaurant with flat screen tvs, bright yellow paint, and album covers as art.

The meals aer really good.  I have not tried their specialty pancakes but you know the place is good with the entire Pennsylvania State Trooper Substation is eating breakfast with you.

They have a variety of pancakes, breakfast burritos, omellettes, etc..  All are very good.

The meals are no more expensive than Bob Evans or iHop.   I say support local.

I have only visited during the week - I could see where this place would be packed and crazy on the weekend.   Just be aware.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Awesome joint. Probably the best food near the airport. Small, can be crowded, but worth it. I had awesome service today, and the food was very good.  I had the huevos rancheros."}
{"text":"A tiny breakfast gem!! Crazy packed on a Saturday morning but well worth it! Personable service with pancakes to get fat on!! Try the Rum Raisin pancakes if on the menu WELL worth the calories!"}
{"text":"Love this place so close to home. You may have to wait 5-10 min. But it's so worth it."}
{"text":"It was a solid breakfast with a yummy spin on french toast.  Coffee was meh."}
{"text":"I loved this little restaurant! Stopped here after dropping family off at the airport (after reading some YELP reviews), and I will return every chance I get! Hearty amounts of food, great selection, great price!!"}
{"text":"Read a bunch of reviews and decided to try it out for myself. Went there on a Saturday morning around 8:30 am and were seated right away. After us, a wave of people came and they had to stand and wait for tables to open up but it seemed like people would come and go in waves. 

We had tea and coffee and I suggest going for something other than coffee - unless mediocre is sufficient. My husband ordered the whole order of sausage and gravy. He probably could have had a half order and would have been fine. I ordered the corn beef cash that comes with hash browns, two eggs and rye toast. I was not disappointed. 

The entire meal came out to $18 and I was pleasantly pleased. I will definitely be going back and suggest you try it too."}
{"text":"In the area for family thing and Yelped a breakfast place so I wouldn't have to do the franchise-thing.  Ended up at Eggs N'at at just after 7am on a Thursday.  No problem with parking or seating as there were only about 2 others in at that time.  Ordered 3 egg bacon omelette and tomato slices (no bread...damn diet) and coffee.  Coffee was very good (and I am picky). Omelette was HUGE and packed with bacon and cheese.  Tomatoes were actually not bad considering this is NOT fresh tomato season.  Total bill $10.  Maybe a little high for the geography but not bad for a Dallas guy.  Very good all-around and plan to hit it again tomorrow before I leave for home.  Glad I don't live here because I would be here every week......"}
{"text":"Great little Mom and Pop place not far from the airport.  Very reasonable prices, and solid good diner food.  We had the Egg and Cheese Breakfast Sandwich on English Muffin; Egg, Cheese and Bacon Breakfast Sandwich on Bagel; and the Pancake Special (two cakes, eggs and bacon).  Good solid American breakfast fare for half what we would have paid for similar food at our hotel.  Well worth the four minute drive, and ready in 20 minutes after I called.  Super nice, friendly folks, too.  I love diners, and this one is right up there with the best.

Oh, and I love that they change their name to \"Fish N'at\" every Friday during Lent."}
{"text":"A decent greasy spoon with excellent prices and large portions. For $10 I received a coffee and a heaping portion of home fries, toast, and more omelette than any person should attempt to eat. The Arizona Omelette was delicious but I was unable to taste any of the chorizo."}
{"text":"If we are going off food let's start with that!! I am so happy that I found this place!! I had to help a co worker out today and I yelped this place:) so! Let's talk break fast!

We got lucky and found parking and it was really easy to spot! It was right on university ave and if you use Yelp it has a picture of the location so just use that. Yes it's small, yes you will wait an extended period for your food, that's because it's homemade people!!! 

I landed on the crabby eggs Benedict! I love crab and wanted to try something new! It was me trying something new and I am so very glad I did! I wanted to really step out of my comfy food zone! I had never had eggs Benedict, I thought it was good

The orange juice was really good! It tasted so fresh to me. I will be back and enjoy some pancakes or burrito next time.  The 20% military discount was nice too!!"}
{"text":"I'm new to the Pittsburgh area and just moved from Detroit. I would have to say this place gives my Coneys back home a run for their money. Generous portions, lovely staff, extremely cheap, and a very cool atmosphere and floor plan. Would recommend to friends and this is probably the first place I'm taking my friends from Michigan when they come to visit!!!"}
{"text":"If you're in the neighborhood, eat here.  The pancakes were okay, the chicken sausage was CRAZY good!  And the brioche French toast, worth the trip alone.  Okay, did I say the chicken sausage was tasty?  Just making sure.  Get a good breakfast, a good price and good service.  Walk out with a smile and start your day full and happy."}
{"text":"Flew out from California and found this gem. We just enjoyed some of the best French toast ever with delicious butter!  The waitresses were friendly and we felt like part of the family by time we left. Coming back tomorrow."}
{"text":"I am a fan of heavy brunches and the \"brunch god\" blesses me every time with a good spot at a new location. We were visiting and there was no breakfast at the hotel we were staying and so decided to try this little place out. It took us a few mins to figure out where the place was as it has a poor visibility from road. Anyways we walked in and were greeted with a smiling hostess and we were seated in 2 mins. The menu is very homely and freshly prepared right there. The coffee was a little milder to my taste but the food made up to that. Got eggs benedict and it was cooked to perfection along with the home fries. Its more of a hash or chopped potatoes. But it tasted yummmm! I wanted to try their breakfast sandwiches as well but then dint want to stuff myself till the gut. Worthy of a place to be at for breakfast lunch."}
{"text":"This is an awesome breakfast and lunch spot.  Very intimate with fun and friendly staff. The food is  delicious. Pancakes eggs for breakfast. Cheese steaks or cheese burgers for lunch.  Home fries are always good....  N'At :-)"}
{"text":"This is the type of place that you are looking for in your home town that is close by, the hole-in-the-wall place that you need to eat at.
The food is exactly how you would expect from a home kitchen. Fresh, and full of flavor.

While I didn't have the stomach to experience the pancakes, I had the english muffin egg and cheese sandwich with Canadian bacon.

It is really good, and I would recommend stopping here!
Prices are vary fair!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and service was awesome. Perfect breakfast place and very fairly priced."}
{"text":"Great little breakfast/lunch spot.   Good food, friendly people, and good prices.

Mostly breakfast items but they do have chicken sandwiches and burgers at lunch.

Note they are only open until 2pm though!"}
{"text":"I used to frequent the location in Greentree for lunch when I worked out that way, but had never visited the Moon location.  The Moon location is pretty much a converted house, and still feels like that inside.  But it was just as awesome.

There is a ton of choices on the menu, at an amazingly low price, and service was quick, fast, and friendly.  We went around brunch time on a Sunday morning- the whole place was packed (deck included), yet .we were seated promptly.  Our server was there every few minutes and she got our orders placed and back out quickly.  It's hard to take our toddler anywhere because she loses interest in sitting still after 15 minutes or so, and we had no problems at all with her because everything was so efficient.

All the food tasted great.  Breakfast for 3 (okay, 2 1/2), with drinks, came to $20.  And we were stuffed for hours.  Do not hesitate to visit this place if you're around!  Don't let the divey look of the place keep you away."}
{"text":"Pretty good stuff! Prices are right! Small place with big taste. Ok, it's not high end but jus had the breakfast burrito and I was pleasantly surprised. Add some jalapeño and it was pretty close to what is very in Texas. Great portions, too! Worth checking out."}
{"text":"This seems to be a very popular place, and very tiny at that. There is no where to really sit when you have to wait for a table. We waited about 10 minutes for a place to open up out on the deck (which thankfully is non smoking). 
Our waitress was good at keeping our coffee filled and the meal was excellent.  The 45 minute wait for the food was truly the biggest downfall. I was so hungry by then anything would have tasted good. I think this would be a place if we lived in town we would go to once in awhile. The hassle of waiting detracts from the overall experience. 
My breakfast pizza (first time I have ever had that) was extremely good. Hubby went with the Arizona omelet. They do takeout as well so that might be a better option for some people."}
{"text":"Took our family out to breakfast while staying in the Pittsburgh area. The food was great. The prices were more than reasonable. Although small, this was a fun little place to eat. The marble rye and oatmeal raisin pancakes were sensational!"}
{"text":"One of the most spectacular breakfast spots on the planet!!!  You know damn well when it's small, u almost drive past it, and then see the line out back waiting to squeeze in....you are in the right spot. The mama Evans pancake special is the only thing I have ever ordered and ever will. When blueberries and bacon collide inside a pancake, an explosion of flavor erupts in your mouth!!!  This diner is worth the wait any day of the week, period.   Treat your friends your family but most importantly yourself.... You know you deserve it"}
{"text":"Classic all American breakfast and food. I grew in Moon Twp and had to stop in while visiting Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This used to be our go to breakfast place on saturdays.   It's a small place. Staff has always been so wonderful.  The food is always good. My Fav is the French Toast here. Their side of potatoes are really good too."}
{"text":"Exactly what you would expect.  Friendly staff, reliable food.  Even though it's small, we usually get waited on"}
{"text":"The food here is good, solid American diner fare.  Having been here quite a few times, I can say that other than one waitress, no one was particularly friendly or eager to please.  If this was the case just once or twice, I likely wouldn't even mention it, but I found it to be a regular event."}
{"text":"Probably the best breakfast joint I've ever been to. Great food, fast service. Can't beat it!"}
{"text":"These guys rock! Food good, servers care, owner usually on site. Like a Presbyterian wedding, you're in, you're out."}
{"text":"Eggs N'At is a small little place in Moon Township, obviously popular. We decided to try this place for breakfast on July 4 and it was packed. The food was excellent - I had the Arizona omelet and Paula had a breakfast pizza with bacon and sausage. BUT (and it is a big BUT) the food took 45 minutes to arrive! The waitperson was suitably apologetic, and all of the other aspects of the service were first-rate. But when the place is as small as this, I cannot understand how it can take 45 minutes to turn an order around - and it winds up being all that you can remember of the experience. This would have been a four-star or five-star review had we gotten our food in a timely manner."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place. They've got a great concept, and a nice space with the deck on the back. And it's hard not to love a place that is through and through Pittsburgh. But I just wasn't really that impressed. 

I ordered eggs Benedict and biscuits and gravy. Now, it took at least 45 minutes to receive my food, which is not horrible, but I thought it was a bit of a wait for what I got, and I was by myself. The upside was, I got to sit on the deck and drink coffee while enjoying the view on one of the last warmish fall days. 

The eggs were pretty good, but could have been warmer, and the hollandaise was kind of watery. The biscuits and gravy I couldn't finish, and let it be known that I LOVE biscuits and gravy. The gravy was just sweet... peppery too, but just way too sweet. I've never had gravy like that on biscuits before, and I didn't like it. The coffee was great though, and the service was good.

Aside from the food, this place is right next to a university, and my blissful autumn coffee date for one with a view was ruined by loud college kids taking up a ten person table on the deck screaming and laughing. 

It was charming enough that I'd be willing to give it another shot, sans gravy."}
{"text":"As you pull off into this little place, it's very hard to see that the entry ramp that gets you to the rear of the building. But once you go to the right side of the door, the driveway follows well being the building. There is a flight of stairs that take you to an outdoor covered patio with around 8 - 10 tables. There are signs on the door asking you to come in and see a server to get a table. As you enter the restaurant, you can clearly see that there are only 12 tables inside and 8 counters seats as well. 
  The servers are buzzing around moving quickly about, bringing food from the busy small quartered kitchen. The decor on the walls are lined with old rock album covers.
 The food is like at most diners, casual breakfast such as omeltes, french toast ect. I ordered pancakes, beacue we were flying out and needed food to hold me. my wife ordered a differnt egg dish that came on chips. We asked the server whats with the chips, she said thats how its served. Overall a okay breakfast place, but nothing outstanding about it."}
{"text":"Pretty delicious, regional fare! Don't expect crazy speedy service on a weekend morning, but the food's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Average diner Pittsburgh diner. Gives you a large portion but doesn't serve anything exceptional to wait in line for; probably won't return. First Watch is still the best quality breakfast place in the Robinson area."}
{"text":"I'm always one to say that all diner food is pretty much the same; you know, it's always kind of greasy, tastes good, costs the same and makes your stomach hurt a little when you're done eating. Eggs N'at is the exception to the diner rule. Now don't get me wrong it truly is a diner in the simplest sense of the word but the food here is beyond that of a typical diner.

In true diner fashion you find a table that's emptying and sit down before someone else beats you to the booth. The price range is that of a normal diner and the service is friendlier than your typical diner. You know what I mean. I don't think it's in a diner employee to be friendly. I really can't blame them but the girls here are which I appreciate.

The have great breakfast sandwiches and if I can recommend something to the hearty eaters out there like myself, please do yourself a favor and get the breakfast burrito. It takes a village to eat the entire thing and for the price it is definitely worth it. As I'm typing this I am thinking to myself, \"self when are we going back there?\"

So grab your newspaper or iPad or just your appetite and get yourself over there now. I know you will not regret it."}
{"text":"One word describes eggs n hat. Everytime I are there for the past 6 years, only one word could describe it. Perfection"}
{"text":"Visiting from Atlanta, and our hotel concierge recommended this breakfast place. We are so glad he did! I had the crabby eggs Benedict and it was delicious. Eggs cooked perfectly, delicious hollandaise, and the home fries were amazing. The coffee is also on point, and the service was great. Perfect place for a good breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"I was told this is \"the place\" for breakfast. Let's go after church, says the idiot (me). Try to find a spot in a narrow parking lot around back and wait for an hour for a table. That's all my fault cause this place is SMALL. It's quaint if you're a real estate person. The waitstaff are fantastic and don't hold punches. The decor is on point in a hipster's house. 

But the food? I won't write home to mom about it. It's just...breakfast. The portions are sizable but not ginormous \"gonna have a meal for three days!\" size. I got the Crabby Eggs Benedict to try something new. I always forget that we're no where near the ocean and to stop ordering seafood items. It was fishy. The fishy taste was everywhere. 

Everyone in Cori says the potatoes are supposedly \"OMG\". I say meh. Maybe it was an off day? 

I liked the coffee. But I use creamer and sugar so I like all coffee. 

It's priced in the Bob Evans/Eat N Park/Denny's area, so that is nice. I want to like this place, I really do. But I won't be craving it."}
{"text":"Came her for late breakfast. Food was amazing. Service was a little slow and not very friendly at times. Overall, I will be back."}
{"text":"Well, my experience seems to be vastly different than other reviews.  Perhaps it was an \"off\" day for their staff, but I was disappointed.  The coffee was served in cups that appeared to be dirty on the outside with old coffee stains.  Were they rinsed out, but not washed?

My breakfast was eggs benedict.  The eggs were overcooked - completely solid yolks.  At best, the hollandaise sauce was sparse so I really can't comment on its taste or flavor.  The dish came with a serving of hot homefries...nothing bad, but not memorable either.

The waitress was friendly.  There were two TV's with ESPN on.  Be prepared, it is LOUD when busy.

If this was closer to me, I might give them another shot."}
{"text":"Was looking for a great breakfast and found it! The service provided by Abby was perfection, as was the food. We couldn't decide so ended up getting breakfast for four, for two. Egg sandwich and omelet were on point. And it was all rounded out with French toast and chocolate chip banana pancakes. Thanks for a great experience all around!! Oh and what seasoning was on those potatoes?! Incredible."}
{"text":"Eggs N'at is by far the best breakfast place in Pittsburgh and surrounding areas. The food is consistently amazing, the staff is always friendly and quick, and the atmosphere is cozy and upbeat. There's often a wait on weekends but it's always worth it. I usually order the veggie omelet with home fries, which are to die for. I highly recommend the Italian bread when getting toast. I also get the Eggs N'at breakfast which is equally as good. Their pancakes are amazing- fluffy and delicious. My Boyfriend always orders the Eggs Benedict, which he says are transcendent. You really can't go wrong no matter what you order, it's bound to be great!"}
{"text":"Not knowing the area you would never stop at this place but WOW! This ones a local's treasure. Inside is just plain old history from old Steely Dan, Steve Martin and Pat Benatar albums hanging on the walls with many generations of remodeling. The corn beef hash and eggs was awesome. Parking in back of place, stay to the right."}
{"text":"Now this is a diner! I agree with Jake H., the place seems very authentic. It's tiny and cozy with old vintage records framed on the walls. 

The coffee wasn't great, but the Rum Raisin French Toast is ANOTHER STORY. 
It was one of the most delicious plates I've had in a long time. It's actually the main reason we chose this spot in all of Pittsburgh for breakfast, and the french toast delivered. My boyfriend also enjoyed his meal, and the plates, tables, utensils were clean. Worth a go, especially for these great prices."}
{"text":"This was a wonderful experience. Our waitress was extremely friendly and rather cognizant to our needs. We never went long without water or fresh coffee. I had the Eggs Benedict with Kelly's homefries. The food was delicious and after I got a side of tomato to add to my meal, another waitress recommended I try it with spinach and promptly brought it over. Such a good addition to a classic dish. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very solid. Cute little diner atmosphere. Staff was amazing. Good was good. Had the iron worker. Their sausage wasn't my fave. Wasn't bad but not up to the tastiness of the rest of the food I had. Coffee was good. Staff very attentive."}
{"text":"I have a few reviews to post from our most recent trip to Myrtle Beach, but before I get to those I want to share an excellent breakfast I had on another trip near Pittsburgh a few weekends ago. Some friends and I were staying at the Marriott near the Pittsburgh airport and decided to venture out for some local flavor one morning. The restaurant of choice was Eggs N'at, a funny named little diner not too far from where we were staying.

We arrived in two cars to find a mostly full parking lot, as well as a really full diner, both good signs of what was to come. The space is not very large, with just a dozen or so tables, along with a counter. We put our name on the list for a table for eight and waited outside the front door. When it was our turn we were told that we would have to split up as they can't accommodate that many people together. Half of our group sat at the bar counter and my half found a table in the corner.

One glance at the menu and I knew what I was getting, Sausage Gravy and Biscuits ($6.95 for the whole / $3.95 half). I'm a sucker for this breakfast treat, especially when it is all homemade. The sausage gravy from Eggs N'at was great! Not too peppery, lots of butter flavor, and a good amount of sausage. The biscuits were sliced in half and toasted for an added crunch. I was very impressed and would easily go back for more when in the area again. I think all of my friends were pleasantly satisfied as well."}
{"text":"Thought about getting a burger for lunch today until I past the sign for EggsN'at and thought, \"Maybe I'll do a burger tomorrow\". 

This is a cute little joint that appears to specialize in breakfast and lunch; mostly breakfast. The place is very clean and the lady that took my order was friendly but not overly so. One interesting thing I noticed is that the walls are adorned with framed album covers; mostly albums from the eighties. Nice touch which I'm sure has started many of conversations here (\"I remember when I first heard Thriller...\")

While looking at the menu I could have had a burger if I really wanted one, but instead I went with the juevos rancheros. It was gooey cheesy good with some crumbled up sausage in it over nachos. It came with a tasty side of salsa that looked as if it was homemade. 

EggsN'at  impresses me as a very comfortable, down home kind of place.  I'd like to try breakfast here sometime."}
{"text":"What a find! We stopped here for breakfast after we got off a long flight. This was the big affordable breakfast that we needed. The breakfast potatoes were the best I ever have had. They had just the right amount of salt. The eggs tasted fresh and the sausage patties were yummy. The sourdough bread was some of the best I have ever had. The service was amazing and the place was packed. We even had to wait for a parking space. You know a place is good when there is a line to get into a parking spot. You won't leave here hungry. The portions are big enough to keep you full until dinner time."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in moon!! Great spot staff is super friendly and food is excellent prices are reasonable"}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never rated Eggs N'At!

It's my absolute favorite breakfast place in the Burgh. You can keep your TV featured diners in the Strip. Eggs N'At is where it's at! It's a little on the small side in the winter. But in the warmer months, they have additional seating on the back deck. I honestly would wait an hour in a snow storm for a Eggs N'At Mixed Grill... so size doesn't really matter (in this case). 

Really cute spot, near RMU. My Dad always said if you're looking for a good breakfast spot, look for a place with police cars parked in their lot. I don't think I've ever been here when a cop wasn't enjoying breakfast and sipping on a coffee. So I think his theory is legit.

Pancakes are da bomb and the Mixed Grill is a personal favorite. 

Great quality breakfast!"}
{"text":"This is your typical greasy spoon for breakfast. Eggcellent ;) for treating a hangover. There is extremely limited seating and the parking lot is AWFUL, so I don't recommend it if you have more than 4 people. We experienced really terrible service for breakfast, but did not really care since we were being leisurely. My table of four got an array of pancakes, sandwiches, burritos and biscuits. Everything was decent and pretty tasty, but definitely nothing to write home about. I LOVED the biscuit, but didn't like the gravy that came with it. I think the eggs were fake eggs. The bacon burrito was better than the chorizo burrito. My dining companions said the pumpkin pancakes were delicious. The coffee was okay- obviously cheap and quickly brewed, but not gross. The checks just have prices on them, without telling you what the \"$4\" is for. I would go back if I was passing by, but wouldn't go out of my way to return to Eggs N'at."}
{"text":"Great little breakfast diner. If you're in Pittsburgh, get down to Eggs N'at. Donnie Iris commands it."}
{"text":"I love this little hole in the wall restaurant. I feel like I'm
coming home when I eat here. Waitress are so great, foods good... can't go wrong here. Just get there early on the weekends cause it's so busy!!"}
{"text":"Egg-Cellent food and service!! 
Our party mainly got breakfast and it did not disappoint!  Large portions and super tasty.  Get the ironworker if you want all the protein."}
{"text":"Eh, to my tastebuds, Eggs N At wasn't \"all that\" as the kids say, or do they still say that?

This so-Pittsburgh-it-hurts-even-though-it's-out-in-the-sticks beanery is MICROscopic, so much so that we fretted over whether or not we'd even be able to get a seat, especially considering their early closing time (2PM) and the time of our arrival (12:45-ish). Nevertheless, the food is served quick, and the customers fly in and out, so we ended up getting seated after a 10 minute wait that we spent simply trying to stay out of everyone's way. Despite the cramped quarters and hectic atmosphere, everyone on duty was friendly, cheery, and eager to please. I just wish I liked the food more. Onto our breakfast...

I will talk to my mother about her hollandaise sauce recipe and see if she's willing to sell it to area diners. Hers is quite simply superior to any I've had in a restaurant. Case in point: ENA's Crabby Eggs Benedict. Having crabmeat on some Eggs Benedict is something I've been wanting to try since I saw it prepared on an installment of \"Great Chefs\" (the best cooking show there ever was) years ago. Seeing it on an area menu compelled me like the Power of Christ. It's too bad that it wasn't very compelling. The clawmeat (arguably better than jumbo lump in my book) was catch-of-the-day fresh, but damn, nothing else about the eggs benedict had a heckuva lot of smack, if you can see what I'm approaching here. The ham and poached egg were nigh undetectable flavorwise, but that hollandaise sauce, the thing that is supposed to make an eggs benedict really holler, didn't taste like anything. Having been seated at the counter, I could see the food being made (Kay loved cook/manager Kelly's tattoos, by the way), and what I saw was a yellow liquid being spooned onto the poached eggs. It wasn't being warmed through in a pan. I gotta wonder what the hell it's made of, 'cause I'm used to hollandaise being made with real eggs (and a few other things I won't disclose for free...hee, hee...). ENA's take on Eggs Benedict had none of the twang nor any of the richness I tend to associate with the dish.

Also disillusive was the corned beef hash that I ordered as a side. Far more hash than corned beef, I found what corned beef there was to be arid and sinewey like the worst beef jerky. The potatoes, which also came with the main dish, were equally droughty and crumbled like clumps of sand on my fork.  

A short stack (two) of Strawberry Chocolate Chip pancakes almost recovered our brunch, but anything including strawberries and chocolate is apt do to that. The flapjacks were sufficiently fluffy, but again, there was something missing, and when I sampled Kay's flapjacks, I felt the same way, and hers had syrup on them of course. Perhaps it was a lack of sugar or salt? Had there been no extras in these griddlecakes, I probably wouldn't have enjoyed them at all without drowning them in molasses. 

Aside from her pancakes, the only other portion of Kay's breakfast that I tasted was one of her fatty, juicy sausage links, and when I did, I immediately wanted to ask the server where the diner gets its meat from since it was easily the best part of our meal. 

I almost ordered a breakfast pizza. Yup, they have 'em. 

On a high note, I did like that there were 70's album covers embellishing the walls. Alas, the decor ain't on the bill 'o fare, y'know?"}
{"text":"Just love little diners that serve good breakfast!  It is small and tables on top of each other but not to noisy and easy to talk.  All the tables on the little deck were in use so we picked a table inside. 
Our waitress was super friendly and helpful.  
There were a couple of specials to go with the usual breakfast menu and there are a few sandwiches or wraps, too.  Stopped by with a couple of friends because one loves the omelettes.   I had the Huevos Rancheros that has Chorizo, onion, tomato, with salsa on Nachos.  The waitress suggested a half order, and oh she was correct.  Very good sized half order. of mixed grill with lots of egg, pepper, onions, potatoes and sausage!  Yum!  Very good indeed.  The others enjoyed their omelette and French Toast. 
Service was fast.

If you are in the area and want a good breakfast, this is the place."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Pittsburgh and after driving around, we saw this little place and decided it looked like a place to go for breakfast. We figured out quickly, it was a breakfast place and waited the 25 minutes to be seated. This to me was a sign that this is the place to be for breakfast.

The staff was great and very friendly. It is small but very comfortable. It does have outdoor seating but I figure it may have been closed for the season. It was a little chill out. You could probably fit about 50 people in the restaurant but they have limited seating area and counter that seats about 10. Though it is small, people are there to eat and they leave when they are done. Not rushed but it seems that the people there realize it's not a place to just linger after you're done with your meal. Eat then head out for the next group to chow.

My first day, I tried the pumpkin pancakes and had an order of 2 eggs and bacon. The eggs were yummy, along with the crispy bacon but I have to say the pancakes were divine. Syrup was available but I just decided to eat the pancakes with butter. Another plus for me, they just scooped enough butter on it so it didn't swim in butter as it melted. My only regret, not ordering anything to soak up the eggs (which my bf shared his with me because he only wanted two pieces instead of four). Ok, yay!

My second day, I ordered the corn beef hash with one pumpkin pancake along with marble rye (it came with the corn beef dish). Again, everything was very tasty and I corn beef was mixed just right with the potatoes. 

I can't wait to visit the Pittsburgh area again and make the stop at Eggs N'at."}
{"text":"Food is always so good. A great place for breakfast. Friendly staff, quick service, and coffee cup is always full. I'm a bacon and eggs over easy n'at kind of guy. This is my go to at least 2-3 days a week"}
{"text":"The front looks like it's been closed for years, but inside it's lively and hoppin'!  From a super pleasant greeting to a serenade from the chef, this place has an energetic family vibe. The \"house\" looks loved and lived in with chips on the wall and scuffs on the floor,  but it doesn't take away from feeling like Momma made my breakfast. I had a 1/2 breakfast pizza with spinach, mushroom, and bacon and coffee. Coffee is strong and not bitter. The breakfast pizza is DELICIOUS! It's a little pricer than I would expect for breakfast, but considering that I special ordered my pizza it's not unreasonable. They're happy you are here and treat you like family whether a new guest or a returning regular."}
{"text":"I don't even remember what brought them onto my restaurant RADAR, but about a month ago I found a reference to Eggs N'at. With a name like that, I absolutely needed to make my way over to scope them out...and I'm not even a Pittsburgh native. For me, a breakfast outing requires a weekend, so I found a free Sunday and made a point to head out that way. I had all sorts of trouble getting there and showed up just 30 minutes before closing time (sorry guys!), but they did serve up a solid omelet in a somewhat unique, cozy little diner setting.

{"text":"A west-side Pittsburgh MUST for breakfast.  Tiny, seat yourself at tiny tables or the bar kind of place.  No booths which are almost a requirement for me and breakfast.  But for this place, I will manage.  

Everything is good.  Eggs Benedict?  Good.  Eggs and sausage?  F---ing great.  But my favorite is without question the oatmeal pancakes. O...M...G

Dis is da best in da burgh."}
{"text":"Who doesn't like a nice breakfast at a local restaurant?  We had just arrived back into Pittsburgh, after flying all night long.  Those red eye flights are a killer.  So, we were really hungry for a great breakfast!  We got a table on the back patio deck.  It was really nice.  However, the parking lot out back is a complete cluster.  Some people really need to learn how to drive and park.

I got the biscuits and gravy and BJ got the corned beef hash.  BJ liked his meal okay, he thought it was decent.  He liked the real corn beef, however he thought is was overcooked.  But I wanted to call the kitchen and let them know that I found their case of pepper.  It was all in my gravy.  Worst biscuits and gravy ever.  Sorry to say. 

We really wanted to like the place.  It's okay, but nothing about it would make us want to return.  Only the coffee here was good.  Maybe we ordered the wrong things."}
{"text":"It is a little small in there. Went with a group of people. Everyone loved what they got to eat. I got the Blt egg sandwich and home fries. Yum! Although the French toast looked pretty good. I would love to go to this place again, without a doubt. Parking in the back. Entrance in front or up the stairs in back."}
{"text":"For me the breakfast was ok. We were staying out by the airport for a couple of night and decided to check this place out. The servings were smaller compared to other places in the area. That part was fine but there wasn't a lot of flavor to me. None of us finished our meals and it wasn't because of the portions."}
{"text":"This is the best and most inexpensive breakfast you'll have outside of downtown! The dining area is someone small and gets crowded but the wait is worth it! They even will make you a to-go cup of coffee for when you leave!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended to my husband and I by a bartender at Las Velas, since it is out towards the airport where our hotel was.  It is good and cheap, and a very nice location.  Parking in the back and clear markings to walk up the back stairs and in the back door.  Very good service and food.   Extensive menu."}
{"text":"Honest effort. Good spot. Authentic through and through. Breakfast in burgh suburbia is a rare place to find and find well. This does it right"}
{"text":"A GREAT Ma and Pa breakfast place. The prices are very reasonable, and the portions of food are BIG. Of the four guys at my table, nobody was able to eat their entire portion. The service is great, and the food came promptly. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great place to observe the local demographic and experience the real Pittsburgh. Buttermilk pancakes were some of the best I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"Worth the wait. The only bad part was sitting by the door in winter with those waiting for a table drooling over our food."}
{"text":"I love breakfast food and have always loved going out for breakfast on Saturday/Sunday mornings. Since trying Eggs N'at for the first time a little over a year ago, I will not go anywhere else. Service is quick, food is absolutely delicious, coffee is hot, and servers are friendly. I CRAVE the food from Eggs N'at (especially the pancakes). If you're looking for a breakfast diner, this should be your place to go! I recommend this spot to all friends and family coming into town. Keep up the great work, and I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"A great diner atmosphere that has a mixture of college students trying to sober up from the night before and old-time regulars (who are probably trying to sober up from the night before, too).

The breakfast menu is huge and has something for everyone (I always opt for an omelet, which are pretty big). They have a great selection of bread choices also, which you wouldn't think is a big deal, but the more diners you go to, the more you hear \"all we have is white, wheat, and rye.\" 

If there is one downside to Eggs N'at - and really, I can only think of one - it would have to be the size and layout. It's a perfect spot for a party of two, but anymore and you will (1) have to wait, and (2) likely be incredibly cramped. But it's worth it. 

Another piece of advice: if dining with anyone 60 and over, you might want to drop them off up front. The parking lot in the back is quite an uphill hike."}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly which creates a great breakfast atmosphere. You can tell everybody that works there are friends and enjoys what they are doing. Most important though is the food! Very hearty portions with lots of options. Yinz try their chicken or turkey sausage? .... Eggcellent!  My son makes me bring him here almost every weekend!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Saturday morning but didn't get to eat. Waited on the deck overlooking the parking lot in the rear for about 30 minutes and decided to leave (Yes, the hostess had our names on the wait list) after looking inside to see if things were opening up to find people standing in the back between the tables where others were trying to eat. Don't know about you but I have no desire to dine while staring at someone's butt about two feet away. Hope this business someday moves to a larger location as I would really like to try it."}
{"text":"While in town for a Steelers game, we stopped here for breakfast. The food was delicious. Had the chocolate chip pancakes with sausage and eggs. Wife had regular pancakes with eggs and sausage. Service was spectacular and friendly. 

It's not the biggest place in the world so you may behave to wait a bit. Also, parking is behind the building. 

Definitely recommend stopping here if you're around."}
{"text":"Rollin into eggs on a rainy day was a delicious choice. 
Eggs Benny was on the menu, so I devoted to devour it with pleasure. Accomplished! 
Staff was friendly and the price was too. 
Next time I will order the breakfast pizza"}
{"text":"It was a great little spot, and the breakfast was good"}
{"text":"I ate here twice years ago, and they serve up food that's like homemade. Very tasty, I am definitely going to have to come back here at some point. I have yet to bring my grandmother here because they have really good food."}
{"text":"My wife and I were recently visiting Pittsburg to attend a concert and were looking for a diner for breakfast.  We used TripAdvisor and found this establishment.  The first morning we had breakfast, we were not disappointed.  The food was great as was the service.  Our dining experience was so good we dined there the following two mornings.  Each morning we tried something different from the menu and each meal was plentiful and delicious.  We will definitely use this diner the next time we are in town."}
