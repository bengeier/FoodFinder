{"text":"I lived in Hawaii for 18 years and I am familiar with all of the local bbq foods. I enjoyed eating at this place because it reminds me so much of \"home\". I just wished that they made the kal-bi in bigger portions. Other than that, everything else is good."}
{"text":"Today was my second or third time coming to Paradise, but I wouldn't call it that if I had a choice.

I ordered the Chicken Katsu, which is a favorite of mine when it comes to Hawaiian food.  I was disappointed that it was especially chewy, and that they served it with BBQ sauce instead of Katsu sauce.  It just didn't taste quite right.  The lady working there wasn't particularly friendly, either.  I'll just go to Ono next time I hear the call of Katsu."}
{"text":"My search for Hawaiian-style plate lunch is finally over...I've found everything I've been looking for at Paradise.  Sure there are some decent plate lunch restaurants, but nowhere could I find what I missed the most--Korean style food.  

Granted, I have only tried one Korean style dish, but it was the best.  Almost like home in Hawaii!  I had the Meat Jun and Mandoo combo plate.  It of course comes with your standard 2 scoops of rice, but I was absolutely giddy when I saw the area with all the Korean veggies.  You can select 4 veggie sides with your plate.  When I went, they had the standard fare of cabbage kimchee, cucumber kim chee, bean sprouts, seaweed salad, chap chae, and others.  Now if they only had shoyu potatoes and daikon, I'd be in heaven.  

The meat jun was seasoned perfectly and flavorful.  The egg coating was crisp and it was well coated over the each piece of meat, not falling off like at other places.  It wasn't greasy at all, and the dipping sauce was delicious as well.  

The restaurant itself is easy to find right off the ASU campus.  There is metered parking along the street (a quarter gets you only 10 minutes!).  The food is fresh yet comes out quickly.  They also have beer available for purchase, as well as Hawaiian fruit juices.  

I am looking forward to trying more of their plate lunches.  The owners and cooks are actually Korean and from Hawaii, so this is as authentic as it gets in Arizona.  I would definitely recommend this place to any homesick Islander who needs a plate lunch fix.  
They also offer the full range of plate lunches, from Loco Moco to Katsu to Spam Musubi.  

You won't be disappointed with Paradise Hawaiian BBQ."}
{"text":"Ok, so I have never been to Hawaii or had Korean food in Hawaii, so my experience is solely from enjoying the flavors and spices of the food.

However, living in Korea for almost two years has compelled my taste buds to know when Korean food is amazing, mediocre, and just plain bad.

The food here is actually rather tasty, and somewhat authentic.  It is not as yummy as Korean food that I have enjoyed in New York, California, and Korea but it calmed my craving for inexpensive Korean food.

I ordered the combination of the fried chicken patty and grilled spicy barbecue chicken.  My sides included kimchi (which was decent), seaweed salad (yummy), macaroni salad (a little too much mayo, but surprisingly tasty), and cabbage (which got lost in the sauce of the kimchi and spicy barbecue chicken).  The white rice was nice and sticky like I like it when eating Korean food.

The young lady at the cash register was nice enough.  She and I talked about Korea and how things had become expensive there since I last lived there almost 4 years ago.

Overall I received a lot of good food for less than $10.00.

I will be back and maybe have a beer next time with my meal."}
{"text":"I ordered the Meat Jun and Chicken Katsu combo. It came with 4 sides, and I had three servings of their delicious mac salad and  the noodles. The chicken katsu was very crispy and well done, just the way I like it. It's also the first katsu place I've been to that didn't have the issue of the chicken getting soggy or soft after I closed the box and put it in the fridge for a few hours to eat later. You get a good amount of food for the price you pay.
I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is sub par Hawaiian. The meat was tough and stringy and there is only plastic silverware. The Macaroni salad has twice the amount of mayonnaise needed, the vegetables were cold. My stomach has been flipping all night after eating here. I have had better Hawaiian in the valley for much less. If you are ever in the neighborhood for Leo's, give that a try."}
{"text":"Just ate here last Monday. Food was amazing. I lived in Hawaii for 3 years and this place was spot on. Going back this week before flying home. Can't wait for the next trip back."}
{"text":"Honestly my favorite Hawaiian bbq place in Arizona! It takes a little while to get food because they make it fresh for you. The wait is so worth it!"}
{"text":"Coming from someone who is from Hawaii I love this place! The food is delicious and the owners are super friendly. You get a lot of food and its all reasonably priced. I love the Korean and Hawaiian mix. 
No offense to My Island Grill but they obviously closed for a reason! I would go to Paradise Hawaiian over that place any day."}
{"text":"Well I was wanting to feel like I was back home but was sadly disappointed.  First like Juli said in her review the two ladies are not very friendly they barely acknowledge you. There is no Aloha at Paradise. .  The utensils are so cheap that it will not cut anything.  We got the paradise special, kim chee soup, 2 Hawaiian Sun drinks, and 2 spam musubi  and my total was about 28$. The musubi was the best thing I ate there.  After 15 minutes my stomach wasn't happy.  ( you know what I mean)  Would I be back..... NO not worth the drive and hassle..... My search is still ongoing to find taste of home."}
{"text":"Decent food not amazing, liked the atmosphere however they charge extra for everything. Only one free refill per visit, and extra for the containers to go."}
{"text":"Everything here is so authentic and tastes just like home. It's always a hard decision on what to order, but meat jun never has failed me. I always order meat jun unless I'm wanting to try something different. All the food here reminds tastes just like the food home back home in Hawaii."}
{"text":"Yummy Hawaiian dinner! I ordered shrimp and chicken katsu combo and my husband ordered the Saturday special- Kalua pork. Both dinners were excellent. At first I found it odd to pick all of the veggie sides, but we enjoyed them,too."}
{"text":"This is as good Hawaiian food as I remember having in Hawaii. The portions are huge and filing. I always get the kalbi and chicken katsu. Don't expect the woman behind the counter to smile though."}
{"text":"This is the best authentic Hawaiian BBQ in AZ.  Being from Hawaii it's as close to the local Korean BBQ spots in Hawaii.  They need to have cucumber Kimchi on a much more regular basis though!  I tell the owners that all the time :).  Paradise never disappoints and just wish they had a spot in Chandler.  I believe it's the only place in AZ that serves Meat Jun which is a staple of Hawaiian Korean BBQ."}
{"text":"I like their food because its only one like it in Arizona when it comes to Korean-Hawaiian BBQ.. Some people have given them bad ratings because they are comparing it to a traditional Korean cuisine. You cant compare the two because they are different. This is a Korean-Hawaiian BBQ restaurant where they serve multitude of dishes from different ethic groups in Hawaii....

My favorites are Meat-Jun and Kalbi combo.. Try it out.."}
{"text":"Had the spicy beef lunch plate with four sides. It was outstanding! Great kimchi too."}
{"text":"This is a great place to grab a plate lunch, it reminds me of home (Hawaii)"}
{"text":"This was my first Hawaiian BBQ experience and it was great. Good prices, large portions, fresh food"}
{"text":"I like this place for lunch. It's cheap and filling. The food is good, not great. The plate lunches are nice. The Korean dishes are a bit better and I usually opt for these.

The service matches the price (as in there is a cashier and you take care of everything else). The place is clean, but calling it \"no frills\" would be too much praise. It's paper plates and disposable utensils. If you ask for a water cup, you get a tiny little dixie cup. On the water tap on the soda fountain there's a sign that reads \"ANYONE CAUGHT USING WATER CUPS FOR SODA WILL BE FINED $2:00!\" I have no idea why I find that so funny.

Oh, and they have beer. A nice plus."}
{"text":"On my quest to try all the local Hawaiian BBQ places in iown, I finally made it to this one. Great portions for the price and mom was cooking. Everything was fresh except for the restaurant itself. Kinda dive'ish and not real comfy to sit and enjoy the tasty food. Take out is your best option here. The Mac salad is good and I love the veggie side options. A definite stop next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Not Hawaiian food it's more on the Korean food side. Terrible customer service. I went in looking for some Hawaiian food I go in and look at the menu and notice not one item on the menu is real Hawaiian food. It's mostly Korean food. No kalua pork, no chicken long rice, no lau lau. Asked them questions about the menu and got total attitude back. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I ordered a mixed plate of spicy chicken and kitchen katsu. The portion (of meat) is huge and the food is tasty. I just hope they can be more generous of side dishes. I chose broccoli as one side dish and there are just three or four pieces....."}
{"text":"These grindz were not ono!! Over cooked my chicken katsu really bad. Gave me the smallest amount of sauce ever. And no wonder my chicken was so over cooked it took over 15 minutes to make and it wasn't even busy. So disappointed. They offer four sides besides rice, and long rice is one of them which is awesome.  Too bad they were all cold. They put my sides in the box right in front of me when I ordered and let it sit there while my katsu was being cooked a lot crispier than should be. The chicken was rough, border line jerky status. I figured I'd give the place a chance based on all the good reviews. You people are nuts, of this is the best Hawaiian local food you can find there's a problem. I'm sick of all these fake \"Hawaiian\" restaurants. They're all just weak Korean bbq's ran by people who don't know anything about adding that aloha to a plate. I don't like giving such bad reviews but I'm sincerely upset about wasting $10 on a very poor plate lunch that had me in there 20 minutes. The cashier didn't have any enthusiasm. The whole vibe was just sad. No aloha! I'll just stick to golden Hawaiian BBQ off southern and dobson. At least when I wait forever there, the food is good. And not overpriced."}
{"text":"Moved to Arizona from Hawaii 7 years ago.  I came here for the Meat Jun.  I was told that Meat Jun only exist in Hawaii when I went to a few Korean restaurants in the Valley.  So I was thrilled to eat it here.  The food reminded me of home.  The Meat Jun was good, but then I fell in love with the Spicy BBQ pork.  My kids are picky eaters and they actually ate all of their food including the side dishes."}
{"text":"The food here is really good, and the portions are decently sized considering it's around $10 a serving not including a drink. Each entree option comes with three side choices. The kalbi is great here, and my personal favorite sides are the japchae, kimchee and mac salad. It's a really good substitute for when you're missing that good old island food! Also close to campus, which is a huge upside. Good-sized seating area inside, and outdoor seating offered as well."}
{"text":"Love this cool lil spot. The paradise plate is great kuz u get four different meats(short ribs, chicken, beef, meat jun). Which are all sooo good, I like the spicy option for .50 cents more. All the sides I've tried are good too, although they may look a bit wierd. Only real knock is no kahlua pork even on the  weekend, and they're closed sundays. But I guess the 2 chicks that work there gotta have some time off."}
{"text":"As a local boy from Hawaii I made it a quest to find a place that reminds me of home and after living in Phoenix 4 yrs now.....I finally found a place that can subdue my craving for a for Korean style plate lunch. Plate lunch is a term that us locals like to call our plates from a bbq or local eatery. A normal plate that you can get from ONO Hawaiian BBQ, L&L BBQ, or any other hawaiian places is that every entree comes with rice and mac salad. But Korean style plate lunches come with rice and 4 sides like mac salad, kimchee, cucumber kimchee, noodles, corn, salad, and seaweed plus a few other choices. Thas the key difference and so far this is the only place I have found this.

I like this place the most compared to any other Hawaiian bbq spot out here is that they serve Meat jun and the sides.  Meat Jun is thinly sliced marinated beef that is egg battered, then pan fried, and served with a slightly spicy sauce. It is also a Korean entree that originated from Hawaii so don't really expect to find this at any other Korean restaurants.

I recommend people to try this place."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for well over a year and have never been disappointed with the food nor the service..I have seen quite a few clueless customers who probably don't understand the point of the SIDES..they are called BACHANS known as side dishes and guess what the ones they serve are supposed to be served COLD. If you are complaining that they are nickel and diming you maybe its because you're a cheap ass lol seriously 25 cents?  if you ask nicely they might not charge you the 25 cents!  I sit right there and listen to people complain why they limit the mac salad..ever thought that its in such high demand the GREEDY ones who ask for more didn't think about the other people who want to eat it too and you should know mac salads do take some prepping..Oh and yes it's a self service also that means get up and get your own drink don't wave at them and ask them to refill your water.  The twins who own the restaurant are great people, just bc one looks MEAN doesn't mean she is mean..as a fellow Asian I get that a lot..cant help that i look mean when im not its called resting bitch face lol but honestly though both girls are great girls and actually friendly if you actually get over your fear of us Asian lmaoooo...i come often with my son yes i like them a lot they're my son's godaunties now and no i don't get free extra scoops of mac salad bc I know one guy whos so unfortunate he had to cuss at them and leave a sad review over a  mac salad..you can have my scoop dude if youre so butthurt over a scoop lol to finish my review..the food is DELICIOUS i have tried them all only thing is i need more hot sauce people be hogging the hot sauces at their tables at least return it i don't want to walk over to your table"}
{"text":"This place has quickly become one of my favourite lunch stops when I'm at school, partially due to the distance, but also because it's tasty! For the portions you get when you order, it's a great price. 

I like to order the lunch special whenever I go there, but it's only from 11-2pm (?). What you get is barbequed chicken, grilled strips of steak, and meat jun, which is thiny sliced beef battered in egg over rice, and four different sides! The way they barbeque the chicken is tender, and the grill flavour is apparent whenever you take a bite. The same goes for the steak. I'm not sure I really care for the meat jun, because mostly what I taste is egg. The sides are wonderful, I usually order their macaroni salad, marinated cucumber, seaweed salad, and the noodles. I used to order their kimchi, but it's not tart enough for me, so I stopped. 

This is a great joint to quickly stop by and grab a lunch, so I don't have any problems regarding the look of the restaurant since I'm there for only around 10 minutes at a time. The staff is nice, quick, and has great service."}
{"text":"Good food, would eat here again, recommend for anyone who lives there in Arizona. Almost the same as soon's in salt lake."}
{"text":"It's the Korean touches that make this place great, great, great if you've ever lived in Hawaii -- and even if you haven't. The kim chee, meat jun, short ribs, sprouts, etc., are out of this world. Order the lunch special -- meat jun, BBQ beef, BBQ chicken -- for a treat. The spartan, somewhat cramped atmosphere isn't going to win any awards, but that's part of the charm, as is the friendly service. The portions are big enough for two. I split a plate with my young son and still have leftovers to take home. For light rail riders, it's a block south of Tempe Transit Center, so you can get there easily without dealing with campus-area parking. Check this place out and make sure it stays open. I can't live without it."}
{"text":"I hate to give bad reviews. :( 

I excitedly came here after careful research in AZ as to \"Hawaiian food\" and found this place. I am from Hawaii and am part korean. So my Hun and I excitedly came here with high hopes from reading the reviews and comparing to other places. We drove 35 min to get there. Upon arrival, the place reminded me of plate lunch places in Hawaii... Kinda hole in the wall ish. With Hawaiian stuff decorating the place. This place reminded me of a chain in Hawaii called \"Yummys Korean BBQ\", except not as clean, veggie portions not as big, nor did they have a veggie place option (5 larger portions of veggies and 2 scoops rice). :( Or a fried tofu option like Hawaii often has... :(  I proceeded to the counter excitedly explaining I was newly relocated and from Hawaii and that this was the first \"Hawaiian\" place I found online and was going to try. There was a lady that helped me that was completely rude, unfriendly, and did not care about what I just expressed. :( Just rude and wanting to hurry and take an order from me. With that said, I would never return back to such a rude place where no true aloha is being expressed from them. :( You would think a simple \"hi\" or \"welcome!\" back would have been great, especially because I happily greeted her with a smile and that I was from Hawaii excited to try their food!  But nada. Just rudeness, straight face, and no smile. Bummer. Not coming back. They need a veggie plate option, a website, and nicer servers who don't act like customers are bothering them. 

I am one who highly values my interactions with others, especially when it comes to being served, and when a restaurant claims to have anything connected to Hawaii, I would hope to find some true aloha spirit there to keep me coming back for more. What a disappointment. :("}
{"text":"This place is good. But be sure to know what you want before you order. There are tons of options and it can get busy so knowing what you want ahead of time will help. They cook your food to order so be prepared to wait 10-15 minutes. 

Great Hawaiian BBQ style food (hard to find places like this is AZ)."}
{"text":"Im happy..macaroni salad made the way it should be...kalbi soft and tasty.four oieces of shrimp...what the hell are you waiting for..get some!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible! The cashier had an attitude as soon as we walked in and asked our first question. When I asked what something was the cashier rolled her eyes and answered like we were stupid, sorry your food up front doesn't look fresh and was hard to figure out what it was by the looks. Bet if the cashier wasn't so busy doing school work and acting like we are a bother for coming inmore people would feel welcomed."}
{"text":"I had been wishing for an inexpensive korean restaurant for years. When this place opened, it was a dream come true because it was also walking distance from my apartment. Score!

Huge portions. Great flavors. The lunch special comes with 3 types of meat, 2 scoops of rice, and 4 sides of your choice. I really like the sesame noodles. All for about $7"}
{"text":"The lady that takes orders/picks up the phone is unbelievably rude. I try really hard to be nice to her and every time I leave I say have a great night, give her my best attitude, but she is just so short with her words and passive. I tell myself I'm going to say something every time but I live close by and pick up a chicken plate with macaroni salad when I'm too lazy to cook so I'm scared she'll do something with my food.. 

I really hope she brightens up because she gives everyone the worst attitude and acts like customers are a bother. Even when you call she doesn't say \"thank you for calling\" or \"see you soon\" it's just \"paradise\" \"15 minutes.\""}
{"text":"Food is GREAT, but the service sucks. Not a good way to represent a \"Hawaiian BBQ\", being from Hawaii. The twin sisters are rude and not good with customer service at all."}
{"text":"Portions are good, and it's worth the price. I love their chicken katsu and bulgolgi combo."}
{"text":"I have not been here since I was in college...I graduated in 2012...definitely one of my favorite places to go...and I have been thinking of coming here for the longest time so we finally did today....it was....okay...

The servings are awesome because the plates come with 4 different sides...plus rice...sooo much food! The meat is good and flavorful...but idk it was better before....

I'm glad I finally went tho :) Brings back memories lol"}
{"text":"Food is good, Meat Jun, spicy pork ,and Kalbi.. just like Hawaii kine Yummy's and Tasty BBQ, btw the owners are from Hawaii also.. wit side of mac salad, kim chee, long rice, and much more. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Stopped by Paradise Hawaiian BBQ during lunch time on a weekday. It was pretty crowded but they were getting through the line fairly quickly. I will say that the lady working the  counter was not friendly at all. She was hurrying people along which is understandable since it was busy but but no need to do it in a very rude way.

I ordered the teriyaki chicken with rice and 4 sides. The pasta salad was pretty good but the rest of it, including the chicken was just okay. I felt that it was nothing special, especially for $9 and some change. Based on this experience, I don't see any reason to come back and try anything else."}
{"text":"If there were any other Hawaiian food place in any part of the greater Phoenix area that served food as good as Paradise, I would go there instead. Unfortunately, we must settle for Paradise. The motto here is \"be as openly hostile to your customers as possible.\" On three occasions I have made the 45 min drive down to Tempe during posted business hours, only to find the place closed, with a handwritten sign \"Sorry, we're closed.\" Honestly, who does that? Lesson learned, call first. I wonder if they are as sloppy with the food preparation as they are with running the business. Makes you think."}
{"text":"Don't really eat here but the food was good and it was really hot (temperature wise) probably won't come back again for awhile because it's not my type of food but I will return eventually. Nothing against them I just rather a steak ha! Thanks guys."}
{"text":"Amazing and fresh food at a fair price. I eat here multiple times per week. Family run and excellent all around!!"}
{"text":"4 sides, shrimp tempura and chicken bbq all for 7.99. Good deal! 
I like Paradise because of the food- very down to earth, comfort food for a hungry Pinay like me and also because I am an avid supporter of local businesses, especially immigrant owned businesses. 
Back to the meal though: I came for dinner and the sides that I chose were steamed broccoli, a cabbage vegetable dish, glass noodles and macaroni salad of course! All very scrumptious and totally filling. I was halfway thru my to go box and pretty much had to stop because I was so full.
Another plus- it's within walking distance of the lightrail, so even if you are not near ASU or Tempe, it's a good place to check out. 
Other things to note:
1) no public restrooms
2) they close at 9pm most nights I believe
3) they are not open on sundays"}
{"text":"Food is fairly good especially the katsu chicken. Portions are lacking in size compared to other Hawaiian bbq joints."}
{"text":"Good food, but don't eat there. The forks and knives won't let you pick up the food sometimes, they are so cheap. But the food is good!"}
{"text":"Great find! Love Hawaiian plate lunches...and they had jun! Marinated, the deep fried fish or meet...and you get to pick FOUR sides!!! Everything I had was delicious! I will return on my next trip back to AS.
Oh...and the sweet young lady that took orders...so nice!"}
{"text":"Not really that great. Food didn't taste all that fresh, tasted like it had sat in a fridge for awhile. Prices are higher than indicated here on Yelp. Most everything on the menu is about $9-$10 with a few exceptions but it's just really bland. I LOVE Hawaiian food and this place isn't really true Hawaiian either, it's like, some Hawaiian, some Korean and some other strange stuff. I guess if their prices were $5 for everything and I lived real close or went to ASU I'd probably stop by every now and then, otherwise it's just not worth it."}
{"text":"I had the chicken teriyaki and mandoo. It was incredible. Very good kimchi and jap chae style side dish. The chicken was cooked perfectly. The dumplings were petite and crispy but it was the most perfect plate of food. Great portions and fair prices."}
{"text":"This always hits the spot for me, I feel like I'm having a home cooked meal! 

I order chicken katsu and the spicy bbq chicken. Both so flavorful! My mom likes the kalbi -- only thing is you only get a couple of pieces, so I'd recommend something else that will fill you up. 

I like that you get to pick 4 sides with it, I usually just order 2 kimchi and 2 macaroni salad. 

I can never finish my order in one sitting. I love that the portions are big enough for you to take home for another meal."}
{"text":"Love the food, prices and portions, but the service wasn't too friendly. You get four small sides with your meal which I love. Best Hawaiian place I can find so far"}
{"text":"The teriyaki chicken is AMAZING!!!! I also really loved their pasta salad even though I am not usually a fan"}
{"text":"This was a staple in my diet during college. Generous portions, not too pricey, and the lunch special is so much food. The meats are well-seasoned, the rice is nice, and everything is authentic--the fact that they serve bean sprouts as one of the many optional sides is fantastic."}
{"text":"This place is a total let down for how good their food is.  The two twin ladies that run the place have the worst customer service ever.  They are robots and do not engage customers at all.  Also,  they have began limiting the amount of Mac salad one can order.   Who has ever heard of a restaurant limiting what a customer can order?  I used to love it but now avoid it all costs because the owners do not have a clue, and I will not let someone limit the amount of Mac salad I can eat."}
{"text":"Good but makes me crave a true hawaiian plate lunch."}
{"text":"Love the food and always have a ton to take home for later. The locomoco is really nice, as is the kalbi. Looking forward to trying the fish and the spicy ribs."}
{"text":"Being from Hawaii, food is pretty good. Probably best place in AZ to get my fix. Kind of expensive but you get a lot of food. They should have mini plates for cheaper price, normal plates have too much food for a normal person. Otherwise, go here, lots of choices."}
{"text":"Previous reviews are true about this place. Staff is lack friendliness and enthusiasm, even though she still talks to customers politely. Take out condiments and boxes will be charged extra. The food is still great actually. I believe that this place can survive in the future due to great location and the amount of daily guests. I guess thats why great service can't be considered here. 

I ordered kalbi and fish jun, along with other veggies. For the portion, I think the price is decent. Mine was around $10, dine in. It can get really busy at lunch time."}
{"text":"I found most of the staff to be fine, although the owner isn't as enthusiastic. The first time coming here, I was a little worried because it was a little on the pricer side, but as soon as I get my food, I was satisfied by the portion side and the amount of sides I was allowed. The bbq meat was really good and was worth it."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Better than the traditional fast Hawaiian food!

This place I'd say is very authentic with huge portions!  It's inexpensive, great quality/fresh, and a huge portion!  A must try if you are craving Hawaiian food!"}
{"text":"The owners are Korean...the cooks are Korean...if you want to eat the good food on the menu, order the Korean food.  (btw--I'm Korean too).  

We've been here 3 times and have order the Kalbi, bi bim bop and bulgogi...all were pretty darn good considering the price (cheap) and the fact there aren't any casual inexpensive Korean restaurants...

I didn't try any of the other food on the menu (ie: hamburgers?) so perhaps the less Korean/Hawaiian foods aren't very good. 

Regarding customer service.......it's an inexpensive order and eat place in a college town...as long as food is good and service is quick, then it's a win in my book."}
{"text":"The food was cold. Also tasted terribly. I think they cook (if they do! The corn came from a can!) in the morning and serve it all the day! 
I went home made an egg for myself!
The staff is also very rude. 
Just stay away from this place."}
{"text":"I had not been here for about 3 years but I was in the neighborhood and went to pick up some \"plates\" for my family.  I was a little disappointed.  So I can only give them 3 stars, at best.  First of all, their meats are not as good as before.  I ordered the bbq beef and bbq pork and kalbi.  Not very much and the quality of the meat was lower than what they used before.  Further, they now grill the raw meat without it being marinated and then brush the marinade on the cooking meat.  Consequently, the meat is not \"well soaked\" and not very tasty.  Their prices are OK, but I never would have thought I would say this, but even Hawaiian BBQ has better prices and better quality meats and more of it.  The only think that Paradise has over Hawaiian is the sides -- Paradise at least has Korean banchan choices while Hawaiian only has sauteed cabbage and veggies."}
{"text":"I'm always a fan of bbq. So one time i went to chodang but unfortunately they were closed so i thought I wasn't lucky to get a bbq that day. then I browsed bbq on yelp and the name paradise Hawaiian bbq pops out. I went there and I was surprised that it's cheaper than chodang yet I can have any bbq that I want even the kimchi. they have 4 side dishes, a rice and a bbq your choice for only $ 9-10.00:) now I always go back there."}
{"text":"In town for training and saw this place on Yelp. I absolutely love Hawaiian food and Korean BBQ...what a great combo. Location is right in the heart of ASU. The trick is to go a little later...you don't have to feed the parking meters after 6 p.m., and traffic (vehicles and foot) was definitely lighter. Staff was friendly. I ordered the kal bi and spicy chicken, mac salad, and corn. It was so good, I just about finished the whole thing! Kal bi was yummy. Spicy chicken had a nice kick. Mac salad and corn added a nice touch. I washed it all down with a Lilikoi Passion Hawaiian Sun. Great authentic Hawaiian and Korean food. I will definitely be back when I'm in town...and next time I'll try the Meat Jun!"}
{"text":"I just recently moved here to Queens Creek and was referred here by a friend. The food was okay, I've had better (I'm Hawaiian so I know my Hawaiian foods) the mac salad was yummy. With their plates it comes with 2 scoops of rice and 4 sides of your choice. They fooled me with their 4 sides because the girl was picking at the sides so they are very tiny portions. Now, the reason why I give them 2 stars is because before one of the lady cookers made my 3 orders of musubis,  she was at the trash bin cleaning everything out with the same blue  gloves she was using to make my musubis!  I was soo disgusted because I seen her cleaning out the trash that was filled with left over food and other people's plates and drinks and dirty napkins. I didn't even eat the musubis I ended up giving it to my dog. Smh. Never going there again."}
{"text":"The food is great and not too pricey. Meat Jun and chicken Katsu are A+. This place can use some work on their service. Unfriendly staff, lacks patience, etc."}
{"text":"Easily the best Hawaiian food within 30miles. Makes me feel just like home.  Hot plate style that makes you wish they delivered. I bring everyone from back home here. It never disappoints unless it's filled with drunk post game college idiots. But that's not their fault. It's tough to be so good!"}
{"text":"I'm a flight attendant and was out exploring PHX on a layover and stumbled upon this place.  OMFG!  The food here is insanely good!  I used to go to this Korean-Hawaiian BBQ while on my layovers in Honolulu, but have never seen it here on the Mainland.  This place is just amazing!  I tried the Dinner Combo and am still dreaming about it 3 days later!"}
{"text":"Very tasty Korean/Hawaiian fusion, good for lunch. The sides are the best part! Don't miss the spicy BBQ pork."}
{"text":"FINALLY!

A quality Hawaiian BBQ place that is nearby. I've been to just about every one, and this one takes the cake for me at least. 

Fresh ingredients, quality meats, great selection and menu items that can't be found elsewhere. MEAT JUN! 

In my opinion a Mac salad can make or break a Hawaiian bbq spot for me and theirs is the best I've found in a while. 

Went with the paradise special. You get teriyaki chicken, beef, kal bi short ribs(not just one strip either) meat jun! and plenty of rice. Combined with 4 sides and it's more food than i could finish. 

Definitely will be back to try other things"}
{"text":"Maybe when they opened in 2009, they had better service but this place is pretty close to horrible.  I am pretty easy going, and would come back to most places but this place is a one time thing.

Too many complains that are similar to others who have 1 or 2 stars.  Read theirs, its very similar to my experience there.  The 2 stars is purely for the decent quality of their meats and sides (except the macaroni salad which taste of pure mayo).  No stars for layout/appearance/settings, no star for unfriendly and rude customer service.  No stars for being cheapskates and posting signs asking for 25 cents for to go boxes, one refill each or they will charge u if they catch U.  Use the water cups for soda and they will \"catch you and charge U the full price\", and oh also no Restrooms.  Not even for customers.  I wonder who they bribed at the City of Tempe to get away with this.  

My own experience goes like this, stood at the counter after looking thru the menu at the side.  Was the only one there except for another customer who is sitting and talking with the cashier.  Cashier reluctantly comes over and take my order.  Told me to pick 4 sides, half way thru scooping my mac salad, turns away and disappears to the back.  Comes back and ignored me, went to the microwave and pulled out a plate of food.  Grab chopsticks and a napkin and brought it out for the customer she was busy chatting with (probably a regular)  Realized that I am still here (its hard to miss a 6-1 fella standing behind your damn counter)  and came back to get me the rest of my sides.

What is wrong with that previous paragraph................Microwave.  other than bad service which I have already expected, i guess they have meat and stuff ready grilled and just popped them with the sides all on a plate into the microwave.  

The Kalbi ribs were decent, some sections had too much fat, use a better grade of meat to prevent this.  chicken terriyaki is good.  Meat Jun is disgusting.  Sorry whoever had it, might have had the fresh ones, mine is stale cold and microwaved, I know it because anything with egg when left for too long will start to leech oil and turn a darkish yellow color.  They have a lot of food, yes, but their formula for success is just that, lot of food, lot of mediocre, cafeteria, mess hall type of food.  if you are hungry and need a lot of food and have no problems handling this, well, its all good, this is your place to come to.  I would have loved this place when i was in college, but wait, I had mai island Grill back when I was in ASU and they made really good BBQ for about the same price.  Don't be impressed by the sides because all Korean places in the valley give U these sides of 6-8 dishes with your lunch or dinner.  Their sides are nothing special and same as any Korean place.  if that is all someone need to beat them, then just make medicore food like they do, don't use a microwave or better yet just hide it from the front, give 5 sides with every order, charge the same price, give free refills, free to go shit and last but not least, service with a smile.  Open your restaurant down the road from this place and yup, maybe even call yourself the Real Paradise Grill :)

I think some of the people I usually see with great reviews on Yelp had probably came here in 2009 when it first opened but now, its lost its sense of pride in terms of appearance and food.  Its time for either an owner change or a restaurant change.  Last but not least, Sun Devils, come on, you need to pick with you feet and walk away from places that gives you bad food and service, I did, you can too.  get a george foreman grill, some korean bbq sauce, some beef short ribs, put them in a bag, pour in some bbq sauce and let it sit over night, next day just grill it.  Thats it, all the kalbi u like to eat."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting! The only thing I could appreciate at this restaurant was the sticky rice.

I went out of my way to find this restaurant because I was craving hawaiian food and Ono hawaiian BBQ was not getting it. 

First of all, the store is littered with demanding signs about not using water cups for soda and 25 cent to-go containers. Really? I understand that may be an issue in a college area but its just makes the place look unnecessarily ghetto. 
Now onto the food.... I ordered the lunch special 4 sides and 3 meats, which seemed generous for the price. I got 2 servings macaroni salad with 2 servings broccoli and then the 3 \"meats\". The macaroni salad is the worst and saltiest I have ever had. The meat was decent but  after eating the macaroni salad I didn't have an appetite to eat anything else. 

Overall, this place is very disappointing. I would not recommend wasting your time or money."}
{"text":"I've been here for lunch a few times in the past month, and I think they have well seasoned chicken, katsu, pork and of course Mac salad...But, my question is, is it the best priced food? Probably not. You pick your main and two sides and if you get it on a plate I feel like you get way less food than if you get it in a box, maybe that's just me though. If I could I feel this place gets a 3.5 not a 4, because there are better Hawaiian places in the valley."}
{"text":"Ordered via grubhub. Chicken Katsu was lacking chicken and appeared to be refried from an earlier batch (Maybe) what little chicken was inside the fried breading was super dry and hard. Didn't help that it was only accompanied by 1/2 ramekin of Katsu sauce. The Broccoli was cold, and while the Mac salad had good flavor it had waaaay too much mayo. The white steamed rice was good. Will not recommend or eat here again."}
{"text":"Like all other people from hawaii, they really do come close to a yummys from back home.  The owners are easy to talk and really helpful on giving insight on something's being we just moved here.  It was also pretty cool we lived in the same area back home and here as well!

I love Korean food and the sides they come with.  I got the kalbi and meat jun mixed plate which was awesome.  I was kinda scared having read some reviews but when my food came I was ready to eat.  Kalbi was cooked well, big pieces and very juicy.  On top of that they had my favorite hawaiian sun juice  

Ordered take out for home, haha.  But well be back!"}
{"text":"I love Hawaiian BBQ and this place is very good! I had the BBQ Beef and Chicken plus you get to choose 4 sides. I had Kimchee, Sprouts, Cabbage and Mac Salad.I will definitely be going here again."}
{"text":"I always get the meat junn.  Food is good and portions are large. I always leave full.... and with the wifes left overs for lunch the next day.  The only thing I wish they had is manapua..."}
{"text":"Food is Good here. Service really needs some work. I really don't feel welcomed here at all."}
{"text":"This food is awesome. The ladies working there are Korean and you can see Korean bbq staple kalbi on the menu and the side dish choice include kimchi, which is great for me who loves Koran food. But they do have regular choices like teriyaki chicken. And each choice has a picture so there is no guess work. I ordered the kalbi and meat jun plate. They taste so good and the serving is really generous. I'm so glad to find a bbq place with a true Asian twist."}
{"text":"Like everyone has said before, Korean food served Hawaiian plate lunch style. Big portions are good, but a little much for lunch. Prices are good. While the Korean is not as good as it's possible to get in Phoenix (i.e. Hodori), it's still quite good. Easily my favorite Asian restaurant within walking distance of ASU."}
{"text":"A review from an Island Girl! 

My family and I moved to the Valley from Kahalu'u on Oahu 4 years ago and have been searching ever since to find a good Korean Island Style BBQ . 

We found it right here in Tempe AZ. Paradise Hawaiian BBQ is the bomb! Korean/Hawaiian BBQ meat with 2 scoop rice and 4 sides complete your plate. The mac salad is ONO! 

The restaurant is family owned (by a local Korean ohana) and the service is great. Eh, they carry Hawaiian Sun Juice and make a mean SPAM Musubi too. 

If you are missing some good Island food this is the best place we have found to get our fix!"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place remains open... mediocre food, AWFUL service.  The ladies work there act like you owe them somethin.  There are plenty of BBQ places around.  Go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Decent Hawaiian food, good portion for the money! Rice comes with every meal i've ordered and its typically 2 large scoops that i can never finish. Lunch combo i tried came with 3 meats but couldn't even tell you what they were or tasted like. You also get 4 small veggie sides, macaroni salad, corn, mixed veggies, etc. the establishment could use a little upkeep, almost no pride in ownership. They have a old buffet as you walk in the door just used for storage of random items. The hot sauce bottles were all down the very last bit. I looked all over the place couldn't find napkins and theirs signs that say they charge for togo boxes and thats never a good sign. But like i said its decent food for the price would definately recommend to try it once especially if you like hawaiian bbq but i certainly wouldn't go out of my way to eat there."}
{"text":"Only place in the state I've been able to find with Meat Jun, which is a big deal being raised in Hawaii.
Coming to this place gives me a little taste of home away from home, only dislike is you tend to crave meat jun on Sunday, the one day a week they are closed. 
They also carry Aloha juices! Black can, lilikoi is the bessst.

Oh they teriyaki chicken is also bomb, can get mix plate to get both and always able to order another half order meat jun"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty decent.  I ordered a spicy Chicken and spicy Beef mixed plate.  It really wasn't that spicy, but it tasted good.
The service is kinda short, bordering rude.  I've never been here before and the lady seemed upset or bothered that I didn't know what the side dish options were.  Maybe she is used to the students who come here regularly, but that wasn't me.
Overall, although the food wasn't bad - it wasn't anything exiting so I'd try a different place next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great mix of Hawaiian + Korean BBQ selection in the Tempe area, this is it. 
Trust me, I'm Korean.

In fact, this place has been vetted by over 60 MBA students at W.P. Carey School of Business. I know this because we had picked this place for catering one day, and everyone loved it! All sides are vegetarian, so all we had to do was allocate more sides per each BBQ dish, and it worked just fine.

Huge portions. I mean HUGE! The lunch special might seem pricey by a couple of bucks, but it's essentially a two-meal deal, so don't you fret. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I was craving for Hawaiian BBQ and came here. I've had their food at the Aloha festival before, but I wanted to see how it was at the location. 

My husband and I ordered the spam musabi and 2 plates of the kalbi (beef spare ribs) and teriyaki chicken plate. Each plate came with 4 sides. 

The spam musabi was REALLY good. I highly recommend it to start off with.

The kalbi was moist and cooked to perfection, but I'd skip the teriyaki chicken. I personally didn't really care for it. As for the 4 sides, I wish they would have warmed up the steamed veggies. It was cold and just didn't taste right. The macaroni salad was on point though I do suggest getting that as one of the sides.

We also ordered a drink and it was a disappointment that you can only refill your cup ONCE! Not worth it if you're paying $1.85 for the cup. I'd stick to the FREE cup of water with unlimited refills. 

I'm really big on customer service and they are NOT friendly at all. They just take your order and that's it, no thank you or anything."}
{"text":"The closest Korean Hawaiian BBQ restaurant you will find in Arizona. Take this advise from a local from Hawaii easily can be compared to Yummy's from back home! Now that's some Ono kine grindz!!"}
{"text":"It's been more than one year since my review. The food is still good here. Everything is made-to-order and they have Shocktop on draft! You can't beat that."}
{"text":"Great place near campus that has quick service, Korean/Hawaiian food.  Ten bucks will get you your choice of two entrees (BBQ pork, BBQ chicken, spicy pork, kalbi, katsu, mandoo...you name it) plus 4 sides (made fresh each day). 

Sometimes in the summer they will leave to visit family in Korea - so check before you go!"}
{"text":"The manner of the Korean woman working there is terrible. She looks like customer owned her 1M dollars. I have never seen any Korean woman behaves like that. Please don't come to this place guys... its not a comfortable place."}
{"text":"Pretty good for a korean food pick-me-up.  The portions are HUGE and incredibly filling.  For under $10 you can get 2 choice of meats, rice and 4 sides.  Now THAT is a real value.

Of course, you get what you pay for.  The restaurant looks like a converted baja fresh and all dishes are served on either paper plates or stryofoam boxes.  The cashier is always busy, so it is hard to ask for a cup for water or a pair of chopsticks.

I will say, though, one good thing is that there is restaurant parking out back, very convenient since you'd normally have to pay meter parking to eat around Mill."}
{"text":"They'd be good if they wouldn't be so stingy about their servings, I ordered a chicken katsu plate and they only gave me 6 strips? Really!? It was over priced for a snack size meal, some kind of business. Seriously no Aloha at all....don't eat here! If you've lived at Hawaii, and had Yummys Korean BBQ, these guys are like a bootleg version of them, shit I shouldn't even have given them a star they're that bad! And the ladies asking if I'm from another Hawaiian BBQ spot!? Seriously?! Honestly! Don't waste your money!"}
{"text":"I came here last night with my roommates and came away very satisfied. I ordered the dinner special which came with 4 sides (I got the noodles, potatoes, Hawaiian cabbage, and pasta salad) and I got a lot of food for a good price. the only issue I had was that the dinner special took the longest to make, so when I got my food my roommates were nearly done with their meals. I would suggest finding a method to speed up the process of making a dinner special. other than that, it was truly one of the best meals I've had in Tempe. the meat was so fresh and tender, which is true of authentic Hawaiian cuisine. the rice was cooked to perfection and it felt like I was in Hawaii, it was really a great culinary experience. I liked the openness of the restaurant with all the windows. I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Located just off busy Mill Ave, I come here once a week. I love that you get four side options. I always go for macaroni salad, bean sprouts and two scoops of the cabbage salad. My favorite main is the spicy pork. Their short ribs are also incredible. I love this place. Yum! You can't go wrong here. :) Don't expect good parking, because it sucks.  Just get in and get out."}
{"text":"food is just like Hawaii but the customer service is almost insulting. Brought friends there from a swim meet and not only will they never go back but they were left with such a bad impression that I'm sure they will pass the word around.
They seemed put out to be there, charge us for an extra plate to share or to go. Had to ask for everything and we were told to clean up our area."}
{"text":"I agree with the other yelpers from Hawaii.  This place is pretty awesome! It's the best plate lunch in AZ!  It reminds me of Yummys back in Hawaii.  Customer service does need to improve but who cares, the food is delicious!! Even the cold sides are delicious! People who complained about that obviously don't realize this is a Korean/Hawaiian bbq restaurant. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We ordered a garlic shrimp meal, a barbeque meal, a shrimp tempura meal, a beef (?) meal, and potstickers through GrubHub. The food was okay, not great.

I had the garlic shrimp, which were large and precisely the right firmness. They weren't very flavorful, though. The broccoli and zucchini tasted odd. (It may have been proper Hawaiian food, just not pleasing to my taste buds?) The potstickers were tiny, less than half the size I was expecting. They were a bit dry.

The beef and BBQ meals looked dry and overcooked, but I don't know this for sure because they weren't my dishes.

It's an okay choice, if you want something different that's not terribly expensive. (Four meals, an appetizer, delivery fee, tax and tip was only $85.) An order placed at 7:30 on a Saturday evening took about 90 minutes to be delivered. However, I wouldn't order from here again."}
{"text":"I used to live in Hawaii and this is the best Hawaiian food I have found in AZ, and the ONLY one that serves Meat Jun."}
{"text":"Not too many places in town that offer Hawaiian bbq places but thankfully I found a gem around the ASU campus ( across from sun devil stadium). The short ribs plate had so much flavor, followed with the soft white rice. Other side dishes was the macaroni salad, sprouts and corn. The other dish was the shrimp tempura plate complimented with white rice, baked potatoes, and broccoli."}
{"text":"The service here is terrible. Like most of the reviews, there's a mean twin/ sister. She acts like she hates this job and she has a very rude personality. One of my cousins have an extremely hard time trying to speak English so she was a little slow when trying to place her order and the rude sister became obviously irritated and impatient. The food was mediocre. We are visiting from LA and there is way better food and service back home."}
{"text":"Hmm...was this a Hawaiian restaurant? I'm not sure...I don't recall seeing spam on the menu. Or was it because I never got past the Korean dishes that were listed first? Oh wait, wait, I seem to remember seeing something about Kalua pork on Wednesdays.

Usually I would feel bad about going to a regional restaurant and ordering something that's not part of that region, but I was hankering for some Korean food and the people operating this restaurant were clearly Korean, so I figured I couldn't go wrong there. 

This turned out to be one of the most flavorful and varied meals I had on this trip! I ordered the spicy pork and galbi plate, which came with 4 sides, and since I didn't want rice, the lady offered to give me an additional side. The sides I picked were kimchi, cabbage salad, spicy cucumber, zucchini salad, and bean sprouts. I read the macaroni salad is delicious, but it's not always easy to get enough veggies on the road, so I thought I'd jump at this opportunity. Both the spicy pork and galbi were tender and tasty. The pork wasn't very spicy, but I'm sure you could ask for more hot sauce. I was too lazy. For $10 plus change, this was a fantastic find. 

Next time I'll try the Kalua pork, or something else that's more Hawaiian, if I can get past my Korean food craving."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant near ASU campus. the cashiers are super friendly, and the food is so freaking food. I stop here at least once a week to pick up some dinner to-go. everything is so fresh!"}
{"text":"There are two ladies who are twins that work up front and take orders. They have many plates to choose from. One of the ladies lack in friendliness and shes super rude to customers and she has that look on her face like she hates her job. The other twin is really nice, she has a convo with you and is upbeat. Customer sucks when the bitchy ass twin is there.

The food is a 4 star but customer service is about a 2 or 3. 

The meat jun and kalbi plate was really tasty. The meat jun is good and I wish they had just a meat jun plate. The amount of dipping sauce that they gice you with the meat jun is unreal, its super tiny and I wanted to ask for more but the lady probably would have given me nasty attitude. The kalbi was good but it was only three little pieces. You can choose up to four sides for your plate. I got sweet potatoes that werent too sweet, mac salad which I liked, um I also got steamed broccoli and I dont remember the last side. Try out this place and try not to mind the mean twins attitude and customer service"}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch before a movie and was craving some food. Picked up the lunch combo (almost $10 yikes) with chicken katsu and mandoo. The katsu itself had a nice fry but the chicken was pretty dry. The mandoo (only 4 small pieces) wasn't that great (again good fry though, just flavor wasn't there). They provide 4 sides which I had their Japchae which didn't taste very good (no sesame flavor). Their marinated bean sprouts also didn't taste that great (again missing sesame flavor). Lastly their potatoes actually tasted pretty good, great marinade. 

The workers seemed very disinterested in serving, and honestly just didn't seem happy. 

I wouldn't recommend really coming back to this place unless you're looking to overpay for not so tasty food."}
{"text":"Hey guys! This was my first time trying Paradise Hawaiian, and I was so impressed by the flavors! The large Hawaiian style portions were enough to feed me AND my fiancé! This was so delicious and the value was awesome. I really appreciate the variety of the side options and ability to choose more than one protein. I will definitely dine here again. 
I ordered the mixed plate (2 proteins of my choice + 4 scoops of sides= $10.99). I opted for the meat jun (egg battered teriyaki beef) and kalbi (Korean bbq short ribs) with my choice of 3 sides (macaroni salad, squash, sesame oil noodle salad, and spicy kimchi) +2 spam musubi +teriyaki and gochujang sauce!
P.s. I ordered mine as take away!"}
{"text":"I was looking for something possibly economical and different for dinner.  This popped up on Urban Spoon...double-checked here on Yelp...and we had a winner.  I stopped in...the lady was helpful in explaining the options on the menu to me (had a hard time understanding her...but after a few tries we were on the same page).  I've never had a \"Hawaiian plate lunch/dinner' whatever before.  I got the 2 meat combo, the Meat Jun and BBQ beef.  The Meat Jun was good...a little plain...but add a dribble of the sweet/spicy sauce the put on the side and it kicks. The BBQ beef was pretty good by itself...a couple drops of the sauce though...brings out some more flavor. 

What surprised me the most though was just the sheer amount of food (was not actually looking to eat that hefty).  I heard \"pick up to 4 sides\" and I was shocked.  4?!  OK...picked the macaroni salad, bean sprouts, spicy cucumber, and spicy cabbage.

I got the plate.  On top of the food I knew, there were two large scoops of rice also.  A LOT of food.  ...and most of it was good.

Good:  Meat Jun and the BBQ beef were both good. The bean sprouts and spicy cucumber...surprisingly good.  Definitely interested in a revisit.  The finale...I had a couple scoops of rice to deal with.  The remainder of that tasty sauce mixed in with the rice.  Good stuff.

The Meh:  The macaroni salad...meh.  Tasted like it was drowned in Helmann's...which to me might as well be curdled water...tasteless mayo.  The spicy cabbage was a little too spicy for me.  

Conclusion:  Cool little place.  I would definitely like to return sometime."}
{"text":"This place is okay if you're just looking for something to fill your stomach or if you just want Asian food. As a fan of Korean cuisine, the food here is not even close to authentic Korean food (even though the owner is Korean) I ordered a bibimbap and it was served in a plastic bowl with plastic utensils. I could just go to Panda Express (which is nearby) if I want that kind of service."}
{"text":"This place is ono! I moved here from Hawaii in a January, and I must say, trying to find good local (Hawaii) food is a mission.

I've been trying to find Meat Juhn  here in AZ, since January. Other than the Aloha Festival, I've had no luck, until we found this place today. Little did I know they are the same restaurant that makes the Meat Juhn at the Aloha Festival.

Much Mahalo! This is definitely the go to place for Local Hawaii food."}
{"text":"Will fill you up and not let you down. The lunch special with 3 different meats and 4 sides for $7.49? is a steal. The owners are friendly and consist ant and I like the fact that you can kick back and have a drink or 2 while your here. I would give them 5 stars, however an amazing Hawaiian place used to be located down the street and tasted even better than Paradise.. its a shame they are gone but Paradise isn't that bad of a substitute."}
{"text":"We tried a mix plate from Paradise Hawaiian BBQ at this year's Aloha Festival. The BBQ chicken was outstanding! It had incredible flavor and was cooked to perfection, with that magical caramelized crust and just enough char. The kalbi we had was more uneven, with less depth of flavor and a tough, chewy texture. The macaroni salad was fine, if a little heavy on the mayo. Prices were very reasonable.

All in all, I would definitely go back to Paradise for future BBQ outings--I'm still thinking about that chicken!"}
{"text":"Not very good today and it's a trend that has been consistent over the past year.  The BBQ chicken plate had two really thin pieces of overcooked meat that was absolutely terrible. The spicy pork looked like it was rubber and it too was tough eating. How does a place that caters to the students, on budgets with 100s of places to eat, serve food that is low quality? I'll be going elsewhere"}
{"text":"I found this place completely on accident - wrong turn leads to a wonderful find!  You know you are in for an authentic meal when you are the only white person in the joint.

Huge selection, tons of choices and BIG servings.

My food was delicious.  And I love that I got to chose all of my sides - fun and tasty.

What's not to like about all of that?"}
{"text":"The first time I was a customer there, after being seated, an old man who, I'm guessing is one of the owners, kept staring at me, which made me uncomfortable. The lady who was cashier and cook was expressionless, as if she didn't care if I was a customer or not and after I sat down, she called me up again to pick four sides (when she could have done so right there). When I asked her if I could have napkins and chopsticks she angrily pointed at the area where they were. As I walked out, I saw them hauling on a dolly, FROZEN hamburgers, fries, and other items from a mail truck. The second time I was a customer there, a more friendly, younger girl took my order and was actually happy that I was a customer. Though, the same lady from my first visit was preparing my loco moco to go, and she took a long time because a customer who she was more familiar and friendly with happened to be there and she stopped to have a chat with him while my loco moco was getting cold. My last and lesser pet peeve is the pricing of the food. I feel like I've been cheated. How I miss Mai Island! They prepared all of their food fresh, it tasted delicious, and Jay provided one of the best customer services I've ever experienced!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to spot for when I want Hawaiian food. Trust me I've tried it all and even mama's in Tucson. Hands down best tasting Hawaiian food in AZ. And people complain about the price, well all the Hawaiian food places range from $8-12 a plate anyway. It's the stupid cheapos who give this place a bad rating. Why don't you just go to the dollar menu at a fast food. Don't be a yelp reviewer in these kinds of places if you're broke or not willing to spend an extra few bucks. 

Anyway, I've tried everything. Meat Jun is my favorite and for the sides it's the noodles and Mac salad that is a must try. Their Hawaiian drinks are pretty damn good too. 

The lady at the front was nice. Spoke up a conversation with me while waiting for my food a few times. Just gotta be friendly and spark up a conversation. Overall I've always had a good experience eating here."}
{"text":"So after discovering that Mai Island Grill closed the boyfriend and I tried to be optimistic and try \"the other place down the street\" - Paradise.

Boooo. It completely pales in comparison. I got the lunch special which included BBQ chicken, BBQ beef and Meat Jun. The chicken was meh, the beef was hard to chew, but the Meet Jun was pretty good. Hence the two stars instead of one.

You do get a lot of food. The meat comes with two scoops of rice and your choice of sides. I chose the mac salad (given) and veggies. The mac salad was okay, very creamy. But my veggies were cold. Like intentionally cold, not just that they had cooled off. I thought this was weird. Cold corn? Chilled cooked zucchini? No thanks.

Boyfriend had the katsu. It was decent but not outstanding. Overall it seemed like they use pretty low grade meat. As he put it - \"lots of knuckles.\" Yuck.

I might go back to try the pork or the spam musubi - at least you know what to expect from spam - but I won't be running back anytime soon. Maybe once my stomach ache goes away I'll feel better about the place."}
{"text":"Very good Korean and Hawaiian BBQ in the heart of Tempe. The kimchi is very good as well as all the meat. Low budget with paper plates and plastic utensils but the food makes up for it. Downside? The smallest water glasses in the world. Still my go to place"}
{"text":"I love this place. When they first opened I went here almost everyday. Well at the least 3-4 days a week. I love how there is a more Korean influence since a good and cheap Korean restaurant in hard to find. 

I like the fish jun it is my absolute favorite. It brings back memories of when I was younger when my mom used to make them. I love how you get a number of sides and there are many healthy options to choose from. I have tried a number of the items on their menu and I have no complaints so far. 

This is a Family run business and always better than any corporate places. The BBQ chicken and fish jun are the best, large Hawaii style portions so come hungry folks!

Perfect for Game days since they are close to the stadium and they have a few beers on tap."}
{"text":"Refused me a drink because I did not have a Arizona ID. Makes no sense I'm here vacationing why would I have a Arizona ID? Told me I can only use my passport if I want a drink. I don't carry my passport to go get food - super horrible customer service."}
{"text":"I suppose I'm disappointed because it's more Korean than Hawaiian, though from reading other reviews I should have realized that. I do like Korean food, but in this case, I didn't think it worked out too well. The prices are normal - about $8/plate - and you get a main entree with 4 sides. For the sides, you get to pick from a selection of various Korean side dishes, like kimchi and pickled cucumbers. They also have macaroni salad, which is more of a Hawaiian BBQ side dish. 

Today I ordered the Beef BBQ plate and my boyfriend ordered the Chicken Katsu and Meat-Jun plate. I thought the beef was cooked well enough. It wasn't so tough that I couldn't cut through it. But I thought it was a little too salty and dry after a while. The meat-jun was really good. I'm not sure what it is. It seems like it was meat wrapped in egg or something...? The chicken katsu was also all right, but the katsu sauce was too thick and too salty as well. 

About half way through the meal, I started feeling a little uneasy. I'm not sure what it was - maybe it was the macaroni salad or the kimchi. My boyfriend felt the same way, too. It wasn't too bad that I couldn't finish my food, but I didn't really enjoy it and I don't think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Located right down College Avenue by ASU's Tempe campus...I was honestly surprised at how much variety they have on their menu! You can get typical Hawaiian BBQ dishes like Galbi, Spam Musubi, Loco Moco, and Chicken Katsu, but they also have other items like mandu (dumplings), bibimbap, burgers/sandwiches and Korean soups (kimchi, tofu, ddeok). 

Since I went during lunch I decided to try the lunch special, which was way bigger than I expected and had meat jun (thin beef dipped in egg batter then fried), teriyaki chicken, and teriyaki beef on white rice. It also came with 4 sides (that you get to choose!!!), and I had two scoops of kimchi, vegetables (zucchini and carrot I believe), and a scoop of the mac salad. Overall the food wasn't the best but it wasn't the worst. I most likely wouldn't come out of my way to come back here, but it was convenient since I was on campus. 

The girl at the cash register was nice and friendly, but everyone else in the back was definitely not. They were yelling at each other and were faaar from approachable, so that was kind of awkward. Also, the mac salad has a lot of mayo. Like a lot. So beware."}
{"text":"I must say it was just ok or average, the amount of food given really depends on what u get, the prices i think are a lil steep but that because it's in the heart of college town. Its walking distance from the metro link so that's kinda cool, it's a small establishment, with a pretty large menu! The service was ok n it looks like they sell beer on tap also, it's not my go to spot for hawaiian food that's for sure but if ur in the area its worth trying at least once n go from there. N the free water certainly tasted like tap water so we ended up buying small soda cans instead cuz yah the water was not tasty even with ice in it. Parking is kinda tricky also cuz looks like meters n not far from the stadium so good luck."}
{"text":"The menus and food at this restaurant definitely replicate the feeling of the Korean-style plate lunch and you can get everywhere in Hawaii.

This visit was my first to the restaurant and it was primarily for the meat jun, which I have not been able to find anywhere else in the Phoenix area. I was pleasantly surprised with the rice, mac salad, plus 4 sides offered with each plate.

I really liked the food. However, I think they could do more to make the restaurant more attractive. It just seems a bit dingy and I know my wife (a native Arizonan) would probably not want to come back. I think they are relying on good, cheap food and quick service, which would be great if I just wanted take out. They do have a good location with enough tables and parking, so I think dressing up the place a bit more might keep a few more customers, especially on the weekends. We were there on a Saturday evening and were the only ones there (7 of us).

Regarding the refills and to-go boxes, I think they had a sign that said you're limited to one refill and they charge 25 cents for the takeout box. I had added a couple bucks tip on my cc receipt so the gal gave me the box for free. Not a big deal, but be aware. I guess you could just order the food \"to-go\" for the box and eat it there if you wanted to.

Anyway, I'd definitely go back for the meat jun, kim chee, and mac salad. I'm bummed that the L&L closer to me is closed (the one at Stapley/US60), but I'm glad I found this place. I hope that they prosper and invest in making the restaurant itself more attractive to complement the great food."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today. While browsing the menu, I hear what sounds like a cackle from the distance. I look over and spot what seems like, a kind woman (oh how wrong was I), who is yelling at me asking what I want to order. At this point I'm being rushed so I go with the original, the chicken teriyaki. As my sides I chose to gamble by taking all 4 as \"macaroni salad,\" it should just be called mayonnaise, but hey, it's a free country. The place is kind of hole in the wall, which I don't mind, so long as the food and the service is good. The chicken was great, which is why I gave the place 3 stars but the service was horrible, the woman behind the counter was rude, and the macaroni salad was mayonnaise with a few cold pieces of macaroni, topped with more mayonnaise. Give the place a try, but don't go in with expectations."}
{"text":"Best Hawaiian BBQ I've had! Such a convenient location for ASU students and you get a lot of food.

I always order the Chicken Katsu and Shrimp Tempura. It comes with 3 (or 4?) sides that you choose (macaroni salad, kimchi, potatoes, corn, salad mix, and more). It also comes with 2 scoops of white sticky rice. 

The restaurant seating area is kind of small and it can get really busy but it's a very nice atmosphere and the staff is very nice. I would recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"First of all, I incorrectly thought I was going to the other high rated Hawaiian place because I didn't pay attention to the name or address.  I just knew this place replaced Julio too's (dating myself) and checked it out.  

Pretty much everything about my meal was poor.  All of the sides are either really bad impersonations of Korean sides, or corn straight out of the Del Monte can.  The seaweed used white vinegar, the cabbage was bland, and the clear noodle things were just not tasty.  

I got a combo plate with BBQ chicken and the short ribs.  The short ribs were chewy with very tough fat on them.  They were not that good.  The BBQ chicken was not that good either and resembled slimy dark meat chicken that you find in a Panda Express rice bowl.  I guess the white rice was... white... and made of rice.  At least they didn't screw that part up.

for $10 I expect a much better meal.  I ate about half of it and threw the rest away.  I will never go back, and if you are someone that wants a lot of these flavors, go check out Cho Dang in Chandler.  It seems a lot of Paradise's (horribly ironic name) food is highly influenced by Korean food but poorly done.  You can get a better meal at a sit down place for less money at Cho Dang.  

 If you want food that rivals Samurai Sam's, Kyoto Bowl, or Panda Express than this is your place.  If you want decent food I suggest looking elsewhere.  I will be checking out the other Hawaiian joint around the corner to see if it is any better.  I am clueless on how this place averages 4 stars.  They deserve 1 star, but I was going to be nice and go with 2.  However, I just remembered that they do not have a public restroom which always chaps my ass."}
{"text":"Larger menu than you would expect from a Hawaiian BBQ place with a huge assortment of sides to choose from. I ordered the teriyaki pork and chicken katsu. The food was good, but the katsu sauce is either 90% ketchup, actually ketchup, or I was given ketchup by mistake."}
{"text":"I was very unimpressed. 

We started ordering our food and some college kid actually pushed in front of us while we were placing an order and started ordering his own food. The woman at the counter turned away from us and decided to help the kid who had just walked in a stepped in front. When we were able to order one of our meals was forgotten. After requesting the forgotten food the woman brought it out and slammed it down on our table. It was all a very strange and confusing experience, as we were being polite and friendly despite the terrible service. 

To top off terrible service the steak lunch special came out as strips of fat. I do not often give bad ratings; I feel that they are reserved for the rare combination of poor service, unappealing environment and bad food. This place had all 3."}
{"text":"This was my go-to lunch spot last year when I was working nearby. The food is pretty consistently amazing. I have tried the teriyaki chicken/beef/pork, spicy chicken/beef/pork, and meat jun--they are all delicious. My favorite is probably the spicy chicken but it's really hard to say since they are all so good.

I have not tried other items such as the spam musubi or dumplings but as far as the entree plates go, they come with rice and a choice of 4 sides. It is important to note that the sides are served cold, which throws off some people (such as my parents), but I actually like this because it's refreshing and reminds me of eating at a potluck. For sides I like to choose broccoli, kimchi (my fav), cabbage, mixed steamed veggies, or sweet potato noodles.

The place is run by twin sisters (and I believe more of their family), which is great because things are always in order. I know some people think the owners are a bit too curt when taking your order and whatnot but I don't mind because I know they are actually really nice and if they are being curt it's just because they are really busy."}
{"text":"Some friends decided to get lunch here, and I wasn't too excited because it just didn't look that good at all. But in America, majority rules, and I had to go...

I'm not really into expensive places for lunch, and my threshold is about $7-8. Almost everything here was $9+ for lunch, except their special \"Blazin Steak\". It came with a drink, some pretty good steak, a side of some balls of rice and a side of macaroni. While the steak was pretty tasty, the macaroni was really plain and the rice was just plain boring. Even with additional \"teriyaki\" sauce I was bored.

To make things worse, they couldn't remember whose order was whose. It took about 5 minutes to figure out everything when they started bringing out food. A girl at our table got food she didn't even order, and then had to wait 10 minutes to get the right order. This place is clean, the service is debatable, but for me the food is kind of bland. Don't think I will be trying this place again."}
{"text":"Very good plate meals, but don't go in expecting great service.  Don't expect any cheerful \"Hello, how can I help you?\" and don't expect any eagerness to give you extras, like extra napkins, without a dirty look and exasperated expression on the cashier's face.  Despite the service, it's worth it for the great selection of dishes and sides.  The meat jun was very good, and is somewhat like the Asian version of a chicken fried steak.  It's an egg battered steak that's been fried.  The steak meat was tender, and the meal came with steamed rice and your choice of panchan sides as well as macaroni salad to choose from (4 for each meal).  They had panchan such as fried cabbage, bean sprouts, kimchee, jap chae, marinated seaweed, and broccoli florets.  They also have Hawaiian Sun drinks as well as a soda fountain for your beverage needs.  This is a place I'll be frequenting again for the delicious plates."}
{"text":"The food is good, they usually give you a lot. Everything eventually tastes the same though. They do charge for everything, extra sauce to extra to-go box, which I guess is their right."}
{"text":"i was super impressed with this place.  never would have found it if a girlfriend who went to asu hadn't told me.  SO glad she did.

i got some awesome bbq chicken...i was tempted to get the bi bim bop, but i have korean roomies, so i had to try something i can't get in tucson.  i had the chicken which was TENDER and tasty.  the macaroni salad, which is the deciding factor on my ratings of plate lunch, was pretty damn ono!  i had the long rice, which was a lil bland, the cabbage, which was tasty and the cucumber kim chee, which is always a winner in my book.

the staff are wicked friendly and the food was SUPER tasty...next time i'm trying the garlic chicken."}
{"text":"This place definitely filled my korean bbq hunger. I got the bbq chicken and kal-bi combo which was probably the best combo in my mind. The chicken was juicy and flavorful. The kal-bi had a nice flavor, although I would have liked more or it in proportion to the chicken. We added a bud light for a dollar, which is a plus in my book. 

I enjoyed the sides, the macaroni salad, noodles, kimchi, and broccoli. Although the kimchi is not as pickled as I normally like it, it still had a good flavor. 

Sure this place charges you extra for things like takeout containers, but is it really a problem to just order it as a takeout and then eat what you want there and then take the rest home? 

My complaint is that it was hard to eat the food with plastic forks and knives."}
{"text":"Found this gem hidden down the street from campus while I was in college and I have been in love with it since. The service is kind of whatever, but the food is what keeps me coming back! I always have the chicken teriyaki plate and I love that there is a large variety in sides you can choose from (you get to choose four sides!) I no longer live in Tempe but am willing to make the trek for some good hawaiian bbq. Trust me, it's worth it!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Granted I've only tried two things on their menu, but these two items are so good, I can't bring myself to order anything else.  The Lunch Special is a great deal if you're stopping by for lunch and the Paradise Special is basically the same thing but with an extra serving of meat (I forget which one) and is available all day.  Now for a quick rundown of the pros and cons of this place:

Pros: Tastes amazing - I've heard tons of people comment that it's pretty authentic Hawaiian food.  Lots of food - 3 servings of meat for the Lunch Special, 4 servings for the Paradise Special, 2 scoops of rice, and your choice of 4 sides (I always get the macaroni salad, bean sprouts, kimchi, and noodles).  And did I mention, the food tastes amazing?

(Minor, minor) Cons: Closed on Sundays, when I crave it the most.  25 cents for a take-out box and though I don't drink that much soda, it only has one free refill for drinks.

Oh and their spam musubi, wonderful if you love spam and still somehow have room for more food after the sheer amount of food they give you."}
{"text":"U can order bibimbap for vegetarian :) awesome!"}
{"text":"Being from Hawaii I love the Hawaiian plates. This place has it all. The sides you can choose from are fresh and delicious. I always get the japchae, potatoes, macaroni salad, and zucchini with the kalbi (Korean short ribs bbq).  I have been to other Korean restaurants and I have to say Paradise's Kalbi is the best in Arizona. I also get the kimchi soup here. It is like homemade soup that I grew up with and they really put a lot of love in it. Again the best in town in my opinion.  We love their spam musubi as well.  I've become a repeat customer and got to know the family as well.  They are friendly and know how to cook. This family owned business is worth the trip to try out their food."}
{"text":"I wish I can give this place 3.5 stars but I can't, so I decided to round down. 

Anyways, this place is really delicious. But I'm a cheap Asian, so I don't like to spend money. This places charges for so many things like to-go boxes. I always thought those things were free. Oh well, at least the food was good. We went too late, so there was no more pork bulgogi (spicy pork) but it's okay. I ordered spicy chicken and mandoo (dumplings) and it was still delicious. Perhaps my favorite part of buying something was the fact that I had a wide array of sides to choose from. I like kimchi, but I wouldn't recommend it from this place. It was sort of bland to me. 

Anyways, a pretty solid place deserving of one extra star...if it didn't charge extra for unnecessary things. However, I would definitely come back. I WANT TO TRY THE SPICY PORK~"}
{"text":"Hip hip hooray! Hip hip hooray!!!! Chheeehheeeee!! Being a native Hawaiian, lived in Hawaii all my life, and now recently moved to the desert/valley transition has been difficult as anyone that moves from their comfort zone it's difficult in the beginning! You try to find some kind of similarities back home and your friends/family say \"you simply just can't and have to start learning how to eat differently!\" A friend of mines who also says \"Millie, you cannot find the same Korean bbq places anywhere in the states, get over it!\" :-( :-( I refused to give up! Lol..
One day, at home I went on Yelp and I just thought I give it one more try and this time instead of typing in \"Korean bbq\" I typed \"Meat Juhn\" and low and behold - waaaaaahhhhhhh Paradise Hawaiian BBQ Plate Lunch pulls up! I was like no way, no freakin way, in Tempe! Seriously reading some of the reviews from the Hawaii peeps and Ohhh my gosh, We have struck Gold!! Lol... 

Now, I just recently learned that Meat Juhn is a Hawaii dish, that's why there are no other Korean BBQ places that serve Meat Juhn! Hawaii is a unique places with many many different authentic flavors and food. I'm learning this as I'm living out of my comfort zone! 

The owners are beautiful girls with beautiful hearts! Yes, they are strong spirited because well they've been doing this for a very long time. In fact, they used to own Kim Chee 5 in Kailua, Oahu and also on Ward avenue in Kakaakao when sports authority used to be Gems. How cool is that!!!! 

I'm excitedly hauoli (happy) they are here! Sharing their mea a? (food/meals) with all of us near and far. You folks bring to me what I miss the most of home. It's the Flavors in each meat you cook. Not everyone will understand that unless you are from Hawaii. 

Of course, I had my meat Juhn plate and it was onolicous, broke da mouth, no can move!!! Lol and the sauce for the Meat Juhn winnahz, winnahz! Some places back home only give you the aloha Shoyu brand with chopped green onions or Kikoman Shoyu (blaaahhhh can't stand Kikoman) but, Ohhh my gosh their meat Juhn sauce... Yummy! 

You know you have a loyalty customer that will be by on a frequent bases! I am thrilled, excited, happy Yelp brought me to you folks! 

A hui hou malama pono!"}
{"text":"Coming from Oregon, we amazingly have a lot of really good Hawaiian places, in my opinion. We stopped by here on the way back to the airport. It is a nice campus location that was pretty quiet on a Monday lunch hour.

Unfortunately for this review, we ended up just getting a few Musubi as we had a flight to catch. It was very fresh, delicious, and had my wife (who is not a spam fan) asking for more. I am solely giving this a 4 star because of the limited menu item we sampled. However, that item was 5 star delicious."}
{"text":"Upon Entering this Establishment I had Employee Look at me Didn't ask If I Need any help and Didn't offer service I wait 5 Minutes Boomer"}
{"text":"Having traveled the Hawaiian islands, and having family from and in Hawaii, I can with confidence share that this is the real deal. The best mac salad that I have ever eaten. The Meat Jun was outstanding.  The moco loco and spam musubi are off the hook.  And the owners were sooooo friendly. 5+ stars!!!!"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite Hawaiian restaurant in Arizona, i only say probably because the folks at Leo's are the nicest of the nice, the food here though...

It is amazing, you may be struck buy the seemingly endless combinations of 1, 2, or 3 item dishes pictured on the wall.. but fear not, all taste great.  Just decide, do i like beef, chicken, or fish and then choose (it will save you a ton of time) .. and then you get to the sides, that's up to you.

I personally ALWAYS get the island fried chicken, I'm not even sure if that is what they officially call it here, but they know.  It is chunks of perfectly fried and seasoned chicken that just explodes with flavor once you bite into it. MAKE SURE YOU FIND THE WANDERING BOTTLES OF THE CHILI SAUCE (gochujang)"}
{"text":"The owners are so cheap, they will charge you 50 cents for using international credit card or 25 cents for take-out box. 

The restaurant is tiny: eight seating tables and bar area. There is some hot and cold bar that is stuffed with garbage; it looks like it used to be salsa bar of some sort. The interior is very poor and gives you the feel it hasn't been redecorated in thirty years.

Kalbi was okay, since I like Kalbi, but the amount of meat - five or six tiny pieces! -wasn't worth 10 dollars. As another reviewer mentioned, it is much better to cook your own. It was nice that they give 4 side dishes, but I personally don't like cold side dishes and the flavor of them weren't that great.

Probably, it was accidental, but little fly came to our table and got stuck in my japchae - not to increase my appetite. 

The staff wasn't very friendly. All in all, definitely, not a paradise."}
{"text":"The meat is 5 stars. The sides are not so good, which is why it's getting 4 stars. I got the teriyaki chicken which was super good!!"}
{"text":"Hands down best place to go when you're on campus and forgot your lunch. I call auntie like 10 min before I get there for spam musubis, made to order, no questions asked, except \"how many?\" Mac salad and kimchi are really good here too. Also their loco moco will satisfy your craving so gooood you'll never get a craving again."}
{"text":"We were staying at a hotel around the corner and came here to get takeout. Ordered the chicken katsu and meat juhn. It took awhile to prepare as they were making everything fresh to order - I don't mind!  We were amazed at the amount of food when we opened the boxes. Hubs and I are hearty eaters and had leftovers for lunch the next day. 

I've never had meat juhn but got it based on other reviews. I thought it was great, especially with the dipping sauce. Katsu was nice and crispy too."}
{"text":"The owners are moving to California in a month!!!   Whoever hasn't been to yummy Korean - Hawaiian place yet- you must eat here before they're gone.  This place has the Best meatjuhn (egg battered beef)"}
{"text":"Found a new love at Paradise Hawaiian after almost eating here for four years! 

Spicy chicken with mandoo (dumplings) combo for $9.99 may be the tastiest lunch in Tempe under $10. Chicken marinated in a garlicky sweet & spicy sauce char grilled and served over a bed of rice with 4 sides. You get about 5-6 mandoo in a combo dish and while on the smaller side are cooked beautifully. If you don't like chicken all their spicy offerings are pretty good with pork following in a close second to the chicken.

Spam Musubi ($1.95) is excellent as well with a large slice of spam topped over a big hunk of rice encased in dried seaweed. 

Place gets packed around lunchtime but the service is quick and to the point. 

After you eat here you won't settle for a Hawaiian chain (like Ono) ever again."}
{"text":"Only place in AZ that serves meat Jun *drool! Love that we get 4 sides with the entree and great service! It's a far drive for me but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"My favorite place nearby campus. It's hardly to find out  any Asian restaurant better than this one near ASU. I would recommend their teriyaki chicken and kabi. Anyways, It's amazing!!"}
{"text":"I had delivery from here.  It was my first time eating this type of food, and it was all delicious except the meat jun. I had no idea what it would be when I ordered the plate it came with, and it turns out to be something like meat foo young without gravy. But everything else - the teriyaki beef, teriyaki chicken, and tempura shrimp - was fantastic, and I absolutely loved their macaroni salad. I'll definitely be ordering from here again, but nothing with the word \"jun\". And I'll stay away from the Hawaiian drinks as well. I ordered two different flavors and they were both bland."}
{"text":"I didn't love it.

The food was just ok. 
The multitude of \"NO\" signs didn't impart a vibe of friendliness (see pictures).  That said, the staff were nothing but friendly and kind, but the signage implied that their manager or owner did not share their attitude.
The bathroom key situation strikes me as extremely unsanitary.

Food: The chicken was fine.  The sprouts were intolerably salty.  The menu offers brown rice, but I was told it was not available...ever.  Rarely do they receive a request for it, they said. 

The signs: 
Front door - \"No public bathroom\"
Over the soda fountain - \"Limit one free refill for each drink purchased\"
Multiple locations - \"Due to high demand in macaroni salad, we are now limiting up to two scoops of macaroni salad on each plate\"  Uh, ok?
Multiple locations - \"No outside food or drink allowed\"
Multiple locations - \"Extra plate or to-go box: $ 0.25\"

Seemed like a lot of rules to me.

The bathroom: 
I asked to use the bathroom and was given a key attached to a large wooden spoon and directed outside and around the corner.  These situations always repulse me.  There was really nowhere to set the spoon in the bathroom.  I reluctantly held it squeezed between my upper arm and my ribs while I used the bathroom.  Then, after washing my hands, the spoon still under my arm, I transferred the spoon back to my hand and tried not to think about those who had done the same...without washing their hands.  Using a paper towel to open the door seemed ridiculous as this point: I was carrying an item people hold *while they pee*, not just transiently touching an item others touch *after* they pee.  Then it got worse. I returned to the restaurant where I handed the wooden spoon / key back to the woman behind the counter, whom hung it back in the kitchen where they keep it and then continued to prepare food, including presumably mine (yikes!), while I returned to my seat where my diaper bag was waiting. I quickly retrieved and used the hand sanitizer from the diaper bag for both myself and and my child.

Overall, I found I left without a positive sentiment.  As such, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for almost 5 years and it has been a great place to get food that reminds me of Hawaii. They are Korean owned and serve plate lunch food in the style of L&L and Yummy's. I like coming here for the kalbi, chicken katsu, and bibimbap. The flavors are authentic and the serving sizes leave nothing to be desired. Great local kine grindz in the desert."}
{"text":"Got the spicy chicken plate with four sides.  Delicious food, however the \"sides\" are tiny. I asked for a double helping of broccoli and I only got 6 florets  #whitegirlproblems.  Great place otherwise"}
{"text":"Meh.

I'm pretty adventurous with food, and not hard to please, but this place fell short of the mark.

Dingy, not enough seating and way too close together (I had to say \"Excuse me\" 5 times when leaving), they charge for EVERYTHING. That's one of the few things that has always really ground my gears when eating out - being charged 25 cents for ranch or whatnot. This place charges for to-go boxes, more than one drink refill, extra sauce, you name it. They even have a sign on the water that they'll fine you $2 if caught drinking soda out of a water cup. It just gave off a cheapskate air.

My friend had a cheeseburger that just looked blah and she said it was nothing special. I had chicken katsu, which was pretty stringy, the breading just tasted greasy, and there was not nearly enough sauce. The macaroni salad was just bleck - it was warm, eww. So was the cabbage, come to it.... everything from the display case of sides actually.

It was a lot of food for the $10 something with drink, but I barely managed half of it and in a very uncharacteristic gesture, I declined to take it home - must have been pretty bad."}
{"text":"The food here looks better than it tastes. I have eaten here a handful of times, and the last time was the LAST time. 

I am very flexible and adventurous when it comes to dining, and have very few hangups when it comes to food. While I am fully aware that there are many breaded and deep fried items in different Asian and Pacific Island foods that have bones in them, I personally did not expect to bite into a breaded piece of chicken Katsu with a little bone in the end. I almost broke a tooth! I am sure this is normal, but my favorite joint, Ma'i Island grill did not have the bone-in variety, and I just wasn't expecting it. 

Moving on, the flavor of every dish I have had here has been lacking. They have a wide variety of sides to choose from, but most of them seem like canned food items that were dumped into a display case. No complex flavors, nothing to write home about. 

One of the most disappointing items on the menu is the macaroni salad. It isn't bad, but when I go to eat Hawaiian, this is something I look forward to, and it is plain and bland here. 

I have heard the Korean food is good here, but it is pressented as a Hawaiian food place, so...

All in all, there are better choices when looking for Hawaiian dining, just Yelp it out till you find one worth going to."}
{"text":"I always come here for lunch after I work and I love it! I usually order a musubi, meat jun plate, or kalbi plate. I usually have the broccoli, potatoes, and Mac salad as my side orders on my plate. I'm born and raised in Hawaii so I know what I'm talking about. The food here is pretty spot on. I've seen many people complain that the sides are cold. I'm sorry to tell you this but that is how they are served. Even in Hawaii. I've never encountered a Hawaiian/Asian restaurant that served their sides hot. The prices are actually cheaper than what I would pay back home. I've also been to Ono Hawaiian BBQ and I prefer this place than Ono's. The restaurant owners are also from Hawaii so they know what they are doing too. Highly recommend to others!"}
{"text":"it's decent i guess.  i just had it.  regret going and feel yucky.  i never want to say anything bad about a mom and pop place.  all i can think about is that's their bread and butter.  but it's not good :(  and if you ever had mai island grill your absolutely going to be dissapointed."}
{"text":"They always have Ono food! It's a place that We when we are in town!! My favorite dish is the kalbi and bbq chicken BBQ!"}
{"text":"I guess I missed something? Ordered a mixed plate - came with rice and 4 sides. Seems like it would be a lot of food, but the side servings were tiny. In hindsight, I should have asked for 2 sides, double portion. Live and learn.

Anyway, ALL THE SIDES WERE COLD - which may not seem odd, but a) they were all in steam trays (like a hot buffet), and b) it looked like some of them were cooked at some point (sauteed, maybe?). The corn was very obviously from a can, but that's besides the point. Cooked broccoli, cooked zucchini and carrots - all ice cold.

In the end the beef was tasty, though skimpy, and the rice was cooked well. I've never experienced a Hawaiian joint like it. $12 wasted."}
{"text":"3 stars because the food is pretty delicious. Cons: I felt like the lady in the front was really rude. She was not friendly at all. Another con was that it is pretty pricey and that they charge for to go boxes."}
{"text":"I've been mourning the loss of Mai Island Grill since it closed. Desperate for a nearby Chinese fix, my coworker and I swung down to brave Paradise Lost Hawaiian BBQ, as I'm wont to call it.

It's incredibly hot inside. The dining area is air conditioned, but the lobby/foyer where you order, not so much. The food is just barely passable. It lacks the rich flavor that I'd come to associate with good Hawaiian from Mai, and I suppose there's a decent amount of it, but it feels just slopped into a take-out container and there you go. The rice is a too-sticky mess (not in the good way), and the broccoli and macaroni salad were disappointing.

I had the lunch special and the chicken just wasn't doing it for me. My coworker was excited by a big noodle soup bowl an older Korean gentleman was slurping in the dining area, but he was brusquely informed \"we no serve soup\". So much for that.

The cook was just behind the counter, literally sweating onto the grill, dropping his grill-cleaner on the floor, and having at it again without much of any concern. Now, I know I leave my grill scraper outside and I'm sure I've dropped it, but this is just one of those things that piled on the disappointment. The food was lackluster, but you get a lot of it, and it's relatively cheap. 

I won't be back. I'll resign myself to hoping the Mai people come back as they've hinted at on their Facebook and Twitter."}
{"text":"Awful! 

Short list;
Cashiers are rude and unhappy,
All sides are made beforehand and scooped per order (COLD SIDES).
Will charge you for just about anything (Sauces and refills)
Frankly, the BBQ is just not that good (just bland, nothing special about it)

Being an ASU student, I frequent many of the restaurants around the area. This place was one I was the most excited about. It is such a disappointment. This place has won awards so obviously it used to be good, but they have dropped their standards so much it's sad. Workers don't care if your happy, they use customer tables to complete tasks, not one of them smiles or will even look you in the eye, BBQ is a bland as it can possibly be and the sides are just scooped onto your plate cold. 

It is without a doubt the worst restaurant  in the ASU area."}
{"text":"Just like back home in Hawaii, doesn't make you miss Hawaii. The meat Jun combo with bbq chicken hit the spot with their sides of longrice, kimchee, potatoes,  and macaroni salad. So many options to choose from, be sure to go on an empty stomach!"}
{"text":"Being from Hawaii, I was craving a plate lunch. Found this place busy with college students. What I liked was it was Koreans cooking Korean food. I got the kalbi and fish jun and lit smelled so good I couldn't wait to get home. When I opened it, it was just what I was craving. The kalbi was a little dry and tough and as much as I like mayo there was too much in the mac salad for me. The fish jun and other two sides were excellent. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"The chicken katsu is super crispy. The sides are okay (e.g. japchae, steamed corn, pasta salad, potatoes, etc). Everything's around the $8-11 price range, is pretty reasonable for the quantity that they offer. 

I ordered the kalbi and pork plate, and those were okay, but I liked my friend's the katsu better. The kalbi and pork were really flat and not as flavorful as I thought it would be.

The service is why this place gets a -1. But, I wouldn't be opposed to going back. Plus, they have their own parking lot below."}
{"text":"Good food & good service at a place with some rough edges.  

It's a bit divey with tacky signs posted around the restaurant warning customers that they will be nickel & dime'ing them for additional commonplace items such as to-go containers, refills, and extra plates.  

Which is odd because I actually feel they give you way more food than expected for the price.  I had a combo plate which came with chicken katsu, kal bi, 2 large scoops of rice & 4 small choices of vegetable/pasta/kimchi.  The katsu was crispy & flavorful and went well with their provided sauces.  The kal bi was a good representaion of trademake hawaiian & korean flavors.  Mac salad was also a side i would look forward to getting again.  

Along with the plate we also got ourselves a teriyaki chicken bowl.  Good chicken, tasty teriyaki, and some steamed cabbage.  Another good item on their menu.  With those two orders that was way more than enough food for a very good price. 

Please adjust your prices & portions and stop posting weird signs to tax people for simple things like an extra paper plate."}
{"text":"Love this place! They do Korean BBQ right and the best BONUS about this place is you get to pick 3 sides to go with your meal. You can pick from cabbage kimchi, cucumber kimchi, glass noodles, broccoli, corn, bean sprouts, to name a few. Typical hawaiian bbq joints just give you rice and macaroni salad and I always crave the kimchi and pickles to go with it and this place gives you 3 options! I've had the kalbi, chicken bbq, and cold noodles. All very very good!"}
{"text":"I moved from Hawaii, after living there for 30+ years.  I would say my taste buds are pretty accurate on whats good and whats not on hawaiian style food.  Paradise BBQ is on par to what a local Hawaiian/korean bbq place would be like and better.  I've been traveling to different so called Hawaiian influenced plate lunch places in the area and thus far they are only 'OK'.  I've learned that the ownders of Paradise BBQ actually lived in Hawaii and understand the tastes of the \"Local People\" which already gives them an advantage over the other restaraunts.  If you want to have good food, alot of food and feel sleepy after eating a good meal- as the locals in hawaii call it. \"Kanak Attack\"- than this is the place to go!  OK Pau Now!"}
{"text":"Don't need to go home to Hawaii for Korean BBQ anymore!"}
{"text":"Best place to find \"local plate lunch style\" Korean food.  Big portions, cold sides, great Kim Chee.  The meat jun is the best.  They also have katsu and combo plates.  Whenever we are craving Korean food, we hit Paradise.  Aloha."}
{"text":"Food is great but people taking your order are worst beings I've ever dealt with. Doesn't matter if you smile or not, they are mean. It makes me hate going there but the food is so good."}
{"text":"Looking for some local grinds?! Go to Paradise Hawaiian BBQ. Called in an order and was told 15min. Got to location and I figured they had a \"pickup\" line but I actually had to still wait in the line (which was about 5 or 6 ppl deep). 

Plate lunches were huge and we definitely couldn't finish it in one seating. Mac salad was a little on the salty side but still good. I love having to choose our sides. It reminds me of one of my favorite places back home (Kalena's). Meat jun wasn't as soft as I expected but all in all we enjoyed our lunch. We'll come back again to get that home feel."}
{"text":"Meat jun was good, macaroni salad was nice and creamy, kimchee was on point I love garlic so it was definitely awesome. The garlic chicken was definitely my favorite. The chicken katsu was a bit underwhelming. All in all its definitely better than Ono Hawaiian BBQ."}
{"text":"Great place for some delicious food. The Paradise special is everything you can ask for."}
{"text":"I really like this place. The place doesn't look all that appealing but the food is great. My daughters and I usually get teriyaki chicken, corn and macaroni salad and it is pretty spot on to Hawaiian dishes. I wish they had Kailua pork more often but it's no big deal. Stop in if you want something tasty and cheap."}
{"text":"By accident, I found Paradise or at least the restaurant Paradise Hawaiian BBQ nestled next to ASU. Its hard to find Hawaiian food much good Hawaiian food. All the popular foods are on the menu, and don't worry, there are pictures up of all the dishes. I ordered one of my favorite dishes is Kahlua Pork, and they had it. I had it with the popular Hawaiian side dish, macaroni salad and then added a side of Korean Kim chee. The food is great and a break from all the normal college row food fare. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Agree with other reviewers about the service. The people really wasn't interested in serving and they just look so unhappy. We walked in with no one at the register and then the lady came back from the back with refills for their sides. She had gone back and forth 2 times to get her refills so we had to wait for a good 4 minutes to be acknowledged. I asked if she could let us order first cuz we have somewhere to be; she said she will need to finish what she was doing. So she went back two more times to refill the bean sprouts and then she was finally ready for us. So no, I didn't  feel welcomed there but I guess that's not what they are striving for. They are in a good location with tons of college students would frequent their place so they are not concerned about a few unhappy customers. But if you care about your service experience and not from this general area, I would definitely NOT recommend this place. It's not worth the drive and there are other better Hawaiian food places in the valley!"}
{"text":"Literally the first time in my life I've experienced sub-mediocre bibimbap. I didn't even realize you could make bibimbap anything less than delicious, but yep...they've done it."}
{"text":"This is my typical spot I go to when I want some good Hawaiian/Korean BBQ.  This place is just like places back home in Hawaii.  The owners are from Hawaii.  I love this spot because this is the only place in the valley where I can find a quick korean bbq stuff.  The other Hawaiin spots are good too but don't serve Meat Jun or all cool Korean side dishes.  My favorite dishes are the meat jun and kalbi.  The kalbi has great flavor but its a hit or miss on the portions.  Some times I get surprised and there is more than usual but sometimes I get pissed and wonder if I should come back for Kalbi here again.  The Meat Jun is always a huge portion.  Probably cause the meat doesn't cost as much as kalbi meat.  It's a great alternative for people looking for good Korean BBQ.  Most korean restaurants are way more expensive than here and more sit in restaurants.  I always order out at this place but I did notice the nickel and diming they do with all the small stuff like refills and stuff.  I hate when places do that too but its a rough economy and the owner have always been super cool with me so that stuff doesn't bother me I guess since the food is good."}
{"text":"I just wanted to say that years later, getting food poisoning from this place is still one of the worst experiences of my life and I still refuse to go to any hawaiian bbq restaurant. Be VERY careful if you decide to eat here."}
