{"text":"De la bouffe correcte, mais à un prix un peu trop haut ! L'ambiance n'est pas extraordinaire ! 

nous avons trouvé cette expérience bonne mais sans plus.

Par contre le service était excellent !"}
{"text":"A nice restaurant you would expect to find somewhere trendy and up scale like on Laurier but instead nestled in the middle of a semi quiet residential area. 

Came on a quiet Thursday night and the restaurant was nearly empty except for a few tables. Flipped through an all French menu (which featured predominantly different types of meats such as veal, bison, beef, venison, chicken, like 3 fish dishes, and 3 pasta dishes) and decided on the table d'hote. 

For $33 I got a creamy soup, a choice of appetizer (I picked the foie gras), and a main of bison steak with mushroom risotto. The soup and foie gras was just good, but the bison and risotto was absolutely amazing. Probably the best of both that I've ever tasted. 

Great service as well, overall solid date night restaurant."}
{"text":"Cozy yet vibrant bistro, which stands out from this reborn neighborhood. Ordered a table d'hote that included a delicious orange, ginger and carot creme. It was followed by an exquisite lamb rack and veal mignon cooked to perfection and sided with a creamy and rich mushroom risotto. Make room for dessert... A voluptuous and crispy chocolate and hazel nut cake , reminding me of a tastier ferrero rocher. Must I also add that it was topped by a white chocolate and yogurt ganache. If you somehow end up in this area, you should definitely make a pit stop. The staff was über friendly representing Montreal at its finest"}
