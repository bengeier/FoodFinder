{"text":"The best indian food I've had in Montreal. They deliver take-out almost as far as you want, and it's delicious on location or as delivery.  Bring your own wine/beer, or buy beer from the nearby depanneur!  (repost from above, because my other account might get deleted.)"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is vulgar: the decor, the staff, the crowd, the background music, the food.  It's edible, I guess, but you can get a thali that's twice as good at half the price by going to Pushap on rue Paré."}
{"text":"Ordered shrimp thali and chicken tandoori for delivery tonight.  YUCK! Really odd taste that I can't quite place permeated everything.  Extremely greasy and lacking in flavour.  Even the little sauces on the side were pretty gross.  Rice was mushy. Disappointed, will not order again!"}
{"text":"Un excellent resto à prix très abordable. Commandes pour emporter et on peut apporter son vin ou sa bière mais si ce n'est pas écrit. Très bon service, en français . Je suis client depuis 7 ans ."}
{"text":"I've been here with my husband a few times and we keep coming back to try the different dishes in their menu. The restaurant is very unsuspecting but the food ranges from good to excellent!  I definitely recommend this place and I would suggest risking it and trying some of the less known dishes."}
{"text":"Thali est l'endroit rêvé pour déguster de la cuisine indienne.  Premièrement on y parle français, c'est l'fun et rare. Deuxièmement, c'est super bien situé sur ontario & de bullion. L'ambiance est intime mais éclairée naturellement par le soleil. Tu n'as donc pas l'impression de manger dans une caverne, comme trop souvent dans les restos indiens.   Le service est ok, sans plus. La bouffe par contre est merveilleuse. Servie dans un petit plat de métal, la viande est succulente et cuite a point. Les sauces ne sont ni trop sucrées, ni trop épicées, ni trop crémeuses. Le riz est cuit a la perfection et se marie bien avec les sauces. Le tout, pour un prix modique tournant autour de 12$ pour un dîner.  Pas ouvert les mardis."}
{"text":"For what I have tried so far, to my indians or anyone trying to eat really good indian for ( for Montreal) Thali is probably the only good indian option you will have. Although it was quite far, I had great samosa chaat and my two friends had thali's. The staff are a bit grumpy but TBH the crowd is pretty rude as well.  Yummy indian food for Montreal."}
{"text":"I went there for my birthday dinner, expecting to eat some good food.  Blah, it was not at all good. The bread was thick and not like something you would eat with an Indian curry. If you are an Indian, I woud definitely not recommend you to try this place."}
{"text":"This restaurant has no connection to the Thali on St Marc.To keep a long story short, this is a mom and pop restaurant with cute decor and a decent menu. I was cashing in on a groupon for the place on one of the final days so there are some aspects I can't complain about with that in mind. The experience itself left much to be desired between the super cold restaurant and disorganized service. That being said, we were some of the lucky ones. We ordered, got our food without it being too long, ate well enough, and enjoyed the fact that its a BYOB. Other tables, including a couple we shared a 4 person table with, weren't so lucky. Portion issues, food taking far too long, and unauthentic dishes. We personally got our apps after our entrees but I honestly didn't mind since our wait wasn't too long. The butter chicken my partner had was definitely more sweet than spicy but it worked out seeing as he can't ever usually handle indian cuisine. The couple we sat with however were used to \"real\" indian and were very much unimpressed all around. Things to keep in mind, if going in winter the restaurant is COLD so dress accordingly. The owner also doesn't care about your feedback as was made apparent that night. They try and get the most money for their work which meant they kinda fibbed to groupon about the original value of the meal. Overall, I had a good meal for the discounted price I paid and it's good to know incase I'm ever hungry in the area, but I won't go out of my way to visit again."}
{"text":"I live right around the corner from Thali, so I like to get my food to go (also because it's not the most appealing place to eat..). I really like their samosas, and I always get the meal with 2 meat dishes and one veggie dish. Everything I've had has been really good-- the butter chicken and anything with eggplant are reliably great choices."}
{"text":"This is a great \"fast food\" Indian restaurant. I like picking up their vegetarian thali and adding another dish on the side and it's more than enough food for two people to share. It's very reasonably priced and I've always enjoyed their food."}
{"text":"An unpleasant experience.  I don't like the female owner's attitude towards me nor the tone to the waiter. It just make me so stressful. The place is so small and our table was close to the entrance door. Every time people opening the door I felt a chill. After the meal on the way back my hands were still cold.  Waited too long for the main dish after the appetizer. We were the second table since they opened after 5pm. The chicken tandoori came just lukewarm and the inside is still raw and the area in contact with kebab stick was in burnt black. That's just odd. Had to ask them cook it once more. The naan come with the thali was also undercooked, since the naan was thick and the inside is so moist and sticky. The other dish was lamb curry which is fine. Overall the dish is lack of seasoning spices which is the soul of Indian food.  I had better Indian food with this price level."}
{"text":"Horrible service, butter chicken is not good at all, im suprised.. samosas were good though. Took an hr and  about 20 minutes for the food to arrive. The naans werent good ethier"}
