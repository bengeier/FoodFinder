{"text":"Worst Delivery Ever Had.

Ordered tonight for the first time. tried calling queen and bathurst location first but was automatically sent to the King and Dufferin - no one let us know.

Regardless, the King and Dufferin is closer to our home. After waiting 40 minutes they called to double check our order and said the accidentally made it wrong and were fixing it. 40 minutes after that, our pizza still wasn't here. When we called he said the driver was outside. We said he wasn't, and he said well it will be a few minutes.

Ten minutes later we called again. They didn't answer. We called from a different phone line and he answered and said he didn't know where the driver was and that he'd call him again and call me back. No call back.

Driver showed up ten minutes later. Pizza cold. No apologies, no offer from whoever was back at the shop or apology. Oh, he offered us the chance to send the pizza back. Great.

Anyway, we took the pizza, hungry and too late to get anything else, got it inside and opened the box - the pizza they called to double check on and redo was wrong. They added ham to a vegetarian pizza that had three ingredients. 

The WORST. Will never order from again."}
{"text":"This pizza place rules. Have been to it over 10 times and literally every single time I say \"man, this pizza place is the best.\" The crust is thin and perfectly crispy , the ingredients are super fresh and so unique. The fact that they usually have a vegan slice ready to go?! Amazing. Not to mention the huge amount of vegetarian options. The garlic sauce is also awesome. The staff is really nice and accommodating.  For 3.75 you get an entire quarter of a truly delicious pizza. 

I am surprised the reviews are bad for this place, but they are all over a year old. I never review places on yelp but my roommates and I all agreed we need to give this place the review it deserves. 

Seriously, this is consistently some of the best pizza I have ever had."}
{"text":"The Toronto Lover system:
5 stars = Must visit!
4 stars = Really good. I take my friends here.
3 stars = Somewhat worth it... if you have nowhere better to go.
2 stars = Below average. Attend only when necessary.
1 star = Do not visit!


At one time, Amato was a revelation. They served beautifully crafted pizzas with unusual ingredients. They put care into the dough, sauce, and toppings in a way that was far beyond the usual delivery chains. Now, it's just another slice joint. This place is pretty dirty, and it doesn't have enough slice business to convince me that they ever have a fresh pizza in the oven.

Honestly, you'll get a satisfying slice for $3.75, so it's 2 stars and not 1. But I really wish they remembered what built up their name in the first place.

2 stars"}
{"text":"Delivery took 1.5 hours and our order was wrong.  Garlic bread was over cooked and had to be thrown out."}
{"text":"I've upped this bad boy by one star because their delivery is surprisingly good. I would even say better than the old Amato's.

Chicken, pesto, goat cheese and some mushrooms made for a very nice pie. I was impressed."}
{"text":"Passible pizza, but definitely not the place to go in the neighbourhood. King Slice, Pizza Nova, Pizza Pizza and last but not least, Vesuvio Pizzeria are significantly better.

I found my slice to be mostly dry and not terribly favourable, and the ambiance wasn't particularly welcoming either. There's probably a worse pizza joint in Toronto, but I haven't experienced it yet."}
{"text":"The pizza was amazing and the service was good. Im going to go back their for all my specialty pizza needs."}
{"text":"This is my lazy Sunday go to. They load on the toppings, and it's way more authentic than ordering from a chain. Doesn't get a full 5 stars as sometimes the overloading of toppings can result in a soggy centre, and their wings are sub-par (but it is a pizza joint after-all!)."}
{"text":"This is by far the best pizza in the junction area! We had 2 medium pizzas and asked for the slightly well done and they came out perfect!  The toppings were very generous and the pizza was so flavourful. We will definitely be ordering from here again!!"}
{"text":"worst food the pizza was saugy and the ingredients smelled ( onions especially) worst service, delivery guy was stoned & asked me to come down get my food and that he didn't want to come all up ( are you serious !! ) just the worst !!!"}
{"text":"I'm re editing this review because the past few times my pizza was over cooked, I was still ok with it so I never said anything ...

 But this 1 star is because this time my pizza never arrived. 

Now I know why this place has such shitty reviews . 



****************************
First 5 star review
I have no idea why this place has such shitty reviews . I'm giving it 5 stars cuz I'm a pizza addict and eaten pizza all over the city as if it were my job.

Hands down best delivery pizza, and I'm only speaking for this location .

My only tip is. Only Order a large, because if you get any size bigger the quality of dough changes.
 
Pepperoni green pepper mushroom extra cheese. Can't go wrong ."}
{"text":"This is the worst operation around and they are complete liars. I ordered some food for delivery through their online ordering. I waited way past the team that they indicated in their order summary. I phoned them to inquire where the order was. They started lying by telling me they had called and said it was to far for them to deliver. This was a complete falsehood as their number was not in my call history. I also rechecked their delivery area map and I am located well within their delivery area -  5 minutes drive from their location.

Do not order from such a shoddy and unscrupulous operation. You will be disappointed! !"}
{"text":"Awesome pepperoni pizza. Big fan of the crust. If you like greasy pizza, this is your place."}
{"text":"Without doubt this is the worst take out food I've ever had. 

I ordered a plain cheese pizza and some potato wedges which I'm aware is a pretty gross order. The potato wedges tasted like raw potato and toe jam which had been fermented in a rotten sock for months. The \"pizza\" was a literally the worst pizza I've ever eaten. Microwaved Wonder Bread and margarine would be better than this attempt at food

The owners should be ashamed of themselves"}
{"text":"There definitely has been a change in management and I don't like it.
The sweet old man who use to greet me with a smile is gone and it seems he brought his pizza secrets with him. 

The pizza look rough now... like two day old stuff you ordered drunk and left on the counter over night and the taste is similar. Even my carb overload pizza tasted like burt cardboard and I loved that potato pizza.

Please come back old man and bring me your blessed carbs :-("}
{"text":"This place deserves negative a Billion stars. It smells good when you pass by, but don't be deceived. These triangular keys to gastrointestinal Hell will make you weep for Jesus. Just don't.

The easiest way to explain it is the fact I live nearby and I've noticed even the racoons avoid their garbage. If a Trash Panda can't stomach it, you shouldn't risk it. So turn around, run away and thank your lucky stars you (hopefully) read this first."}
{"text":"They seriously need to clean this location. A few touch ups of paint and a cleaner looking store would make this place a lot better! Makes me wonder if health and safety rules are being followed...dirty in front so why would they clean the back/ unseen area? They use store bought packaged pasta and recently raised prices without upgrading quality. I like their alfredo sauce so I will go there occasionally but if they made a few minor upgrades I would be there a lot more and I'm sure they'd have more customers."}
