{"text":"Very friendly staff. Coffee (Phil & Sebastian) was excellent.  Food was a little slow but I'm not complaining. It was French toast and bacon,  and made from scratch....well worth the wait. Will return for sure."}
{"text":"When I first approached the cafe I had trouble figuring out where I was and what establishment I walked into. There was little in the form of branding, what was was easily glossed over and the place looked empty at 9am. Though on a Tuesday they can't be faulted for this.  Hungry for breakfast I noticed instantly that their menu was very traditional with little in the memorable dishes category. Located in the heart of inglewood there was little that made this place stand out.  Deciding to go with the eggs, toast and bacon, it took some time for food to be prepared. Though customer service was kind enough I waited patiently reading today's issue of 24hr that I picked up on a sidewalk paper dispenser nearby.  When my food arrived it was well presented as the toast was arranged with care and eggs done the way that I like them. Upon investigating the bacon further, I discovered that the $2.15 extra they charged me went to one slice of crispy bacon cut, arranged, and hidden under my toast to look like more was going on. Though my meal was tasty and quaintly presented, I was disappointed with the value that accompanied it.   Breakfast is very important. I feel that if your going to offer this as an option, the menu should include a variety of healthy, standard and unique choices outside of what you'd find in ones own kitchen. This topped off with current appropriate, Canadian Food Guide proportions."}
{"text":"Nine Cafe took over the space where Serendipity used to be. In principle it's the same - cafe up front, retail in the back.   They've downsized the retail a bit (I can't imagine they sell much), and increased the cafe side of things. Their menu is small but decent - breakfast, sandwiches, soup, salads.  We stopped in there on Canada Day for the first time. The staff were super, let me say that up front. Clearly trying hard and it showed.  M had the bacon, eggs and toast which he really liked. His only complaint (and I'm fussy about this too) is the lack of a pepper grinder, they just had the shakers. I think no matter how casual the approach, every restaurant should keep one around.   B and I both had sandwiches, freshly made and tasty. The salad was plain but good too.  What makes or breaks a place like this for B is the coffee. He's the coffee snob of the western world. And while he's not a huge fan of the Phil and Sebastian coffee (which is what Nine uses)...he did pronounce the coffee \"good\".  Whew. This means we can indeed go back.  Well done Nine."}
{"text":"I guess I won't keep going indefinitely-- Cafe 9 of Inglewood is no more. I was really sorry to see them fold, and wish the owners well in their future endeavors."}
{"text":"We love this little cafe and tend to stop in here for lunch before we hop over to the Crossroads Market and take in an afternoon performance at the Loose Moose theatre with our kids.  It is a cafe, coffee shop and gift shop and every meal I've enjoyed here has been tasty.  I tend to order the prosciutto sammy every time but have had their breakfast bagel before which is made to order and very yummy.  Hubs sticks with a ham & swiss or turkey & cheddar sammy and the kids are happy with ham & cheese.  There is lots to look at in the cafe, even while you are chowing down on your food.  The staff are friendly and the coffee is good.  I guess that's why we keep coming back :)"}
{"text":"Nine Cafe... you and I have got to spend a bit more time together. The brief period I spent sipping my latte and eating my ginger bread cookie were delightful.  You're a cafe in the front and a cutsie-pie store in the back. I don't know exactly what that makes you, but you're far cooler than a mullet.  Next time, I'll be sure to pop in more than 15 minutes before you close to thoroughly peruse your wares. From what I saw, board games, knick knacks, books, cards, I'm in for a treat."}
