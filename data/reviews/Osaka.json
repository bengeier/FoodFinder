{"text":"The menu looked promising and the numerous options that come with the food sounded impressive; however the soup tasted like beef bullion out of a can and the salad lettuce was watery. The rice was bland and the scallops not fresh tasting. The server seemed confused and messed up our table's orders. The neighbors were looking forward to another food options in the Stoney Creek area but this just isn't going to be it."}
{"text":"Got To Go after a few nights it opened. It was terrible, the vegetables were soggy and watery. This place doesn't have sushi, menu is very limited. This place will not stay in business for long. The decor is terrible. Save your money, do not go here if you don't want to be disappointed."}
{"text":"We were so excited to see a new option in the area. I decided to order take out. While waiting for my order, I noticed how disorganized the wait staff was and the complete lack of decorations. I ordered the filet and it was cooked perfectly. The noodles were bad, I didn't try the soup and the salad was watery. The vegetables were tasty however it was mainly onions.  I'm hoping they get it together! The steak was good enough to make me give it one more chance."}
{"text":"Sadly, this is not going to be a positive review. I really had high hopes for one of the only restaurants in this area, but we've now had two bad experiences with food, and won't be returning for overpriced underwhelming food again.   The first time we waited 40 mins for take out, only to be told that they gave our food to someone else. Instead of being proactive, they waited for me to come back in to ask me if I wanted it remade?!.... Um, of course I do, I already paid for it and have been here the better part of an hour. No apology, no compensation, nothing.   The food LOOKED great. A few bites in I realized it was a waste of time after all. The rice was mush and had no seasoning or flavor. The chicken was obliterated it was so over cooked. It was essentially inedible. The noodles, like the rice, were mushy and unseasoned. The veggies were also bland and overbooked. My husband got the steak, while it was slightly better, it was still far best well done even though it was ordered MR.   We gave them another chance hoping that these were rookie mistakes that would be corrected with time. It was same experience, with an even longer wait time. The prices compare to that of sit down, quality Japanese steakhouses in Gso, yet the food can't even be compared to that of one of the many Japanese express restaurants around."}
{"text":"Came here twice both times place was almost empty which is great! The service was quick and sociable. The food came in mere minutes after ordering! Kind of amazing how quick they were to have a plateful of food in not even 5 minutes. The taste was like going to a much more Expensive Japanese restaurant without the price and WAIT. Would 100% recommend."}
{"text":"I agree with some previous reviewers that there are some kinks to still be worked out but overall I have enjoyed eating lunch there on several occasions. I can't comment on anything other than the hibachi chicken and/or steak lunch combo. Everything has always been cooked well with good flavor. I enjoy the noodles as an added bonus instead of just rice. The salad is definitely plain but not unlike most Japanese style restaurant salads that others offer.  The wait staff has changed some since their opening and is better now with very friendly folks.  Atmosphere does does leave a little to be desired, but I think they are just trying to keep everything simple and costs down until they formally establish themselves as a long term presence."}

{"text":"I felt the need to write a review because we order takeout from this place all the time and I really like it! I was surprised to see such negative reviews.   The only thing that I can complain about is that I called before 9pm one time to place a to-go order and they said they had closed early. I was disappointed but it didn't stop me from going back. The food is well seasoned and they give you large portions. The sauces are just right and they don't charge you for extras. I wish they had a spicy mustard sauce but I'll live.   I haven't found another Japanese restaurant in the area that meets my standards. Most are pretty bland, don't give you enough food or are too far. We tried the hibachi chicken, steak and shrimp. Our friends from Charlotte really enjoyed the teriyaki as well (and they are Asian!). The noodles, I agree, could be left off. I never eat them."}
{"text":"Subpar for Japanese food. It's Japanese food hibachi style but something it lacks is taste. I remember being unimpressed with the flavors. There is just no wow factor to this place and it took a while to get my to go order. Not much else to say about this place but it lack flavor and for that I can't recommend."}
{"text":"I have never thought I would write a bad review about a restaurant, but this place has done it.  From the food, the service and decor or lack there of, it was terrible.  The food was bland and not made well.  The supposed Asian noodles were nothing more than store bought spaghetti with a bit of soy sauce.   The salad was nothing more than iceberg lettuce with bad dressing. I understand that they just opened, but they have a lot to work on. Our waitress was so bad that the other waitress working, came up and apologized even though we did not complain.    There are no pictures or any decor on the wall, so it gave the place an almost sterile hospital like feeling.   After waiting anxiously to try the new place, I was extremely disappointed. They have a lot to work on before I ever decide to go back."}
{"text":"I picked up a to-go order for some Hibachi Chicken along with an order of their gyoza. The chicken was very good, it's cooked with mushrooms and served with fried rice, vegetables and noodles. There was also a choice of salad or soup, I chose the salad with ginger dressing, the salad was just lettuce with one tiny piece of carrot, nothing exciting there, but the hibachi plate and the gyoza were both great as were their ginger and mustad sauces."}
{"text":"Before I begin, I should note that I've only gotten their lunch take-outs. In other words, I can't really speak much for the service.   The food on the other hand is OK. With the lunch special you get your choice of hibachi meat (or vegetables), fried rice, noodles, and side hibachi vegetables with a salad. Every time I've gone, I ordered the hibachi chicken. The lunch portions are appropriate and very filling and sometimes I even have leftovers. The hibachi chicken, fried rice, and vegetables were all really good. However, the noodles are nothing more than spaghetti cooked with soy sauce and stir-fried. The salad is a little lacking but that's not too much of a big deal. They have also recently added appetizers like dumplings.  So, overall, this is a good place for take-out."}
{"text":"Should have checked the reviews before going. We will not go back. Bland food. Chicken overcooked. Scallops undercooked. Nothing redeeming here."}
{"text":"The gyoza were good. Miso soup was watery.The hibachi was beyond bland and used mostly onion filler. I wouldn't recommend this place and definitely not onsite dining."}
