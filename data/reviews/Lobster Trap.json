{"text":"I am going to walk through this incredibly disappointing visit my girlfriend and I had to The Lobster Trap.

Ambiance: 3/10
Dated. This is the easiest way to describe the interior. It is easy to believe that this place is 50 years old as much of the decor appear not to have been updated, ever. The chairs and tables are cheap and uncomfortable, the through-the-wall air conditioner was dripping away, carpeting looked ancient. Oddly enough there were a few modern styled glass tables near the entrance that only made the rest of place seem worse. The whole place is in desperate need of some TLC, perhaps with a fresh coat of paint and some new lighting it may not come across as so dingy. 
Cheap is the other word I could use to describe my experience. The water pitchers are cheap plastic ones, likely a dollar store purchase and the ramekin in which the  dressing for my salad was provided in was certainly from a dollar store. I know because I have the same ones at home for paint brush water. This seems like a small detail to be complaining about, but when I go to a restaurant where appetizers average $15 and entrees at $32 I expect them to put some effort into what they serve with.

Service: 9/10
This is the Lobster Trap's sole redeeming quality.  Our waitress was always available, extremely personable and did not check in too often (something I really appreciate). Zero complaints here.

Food: 4/10
This was a staggering let down. I ordered the rack of lamb with salad and baked potato, my girlfriend ordered the 1lb broiled lobster with rice and baked potato. 

I will start with their 'garden salad,' it was a sad mixture of romaine, baby spinach, and a few other mixed greens. These were hardly the freshest ingredients and were topped with three huge chunks of tomatoes and a few slivers of cucumber.  Very limited choice of dressing and the Italian I ended up receiving was clearly just Kraft.  

Their baked potatoes were beyond basic. It was literally just a potato baked in an oven. No extra love involved. Good but extremely forgettable 

The rice was a joke. My girlfriend received a small plate of dry brown rice topped with a pinch of shredded parsley. She took tried a bit noticed a faint hint of lemon but said that it was far too dry to be edible. Not sure why this is a side option or who would find this enjoyable.

To their credit the proteins delivered. My rack of lamb was cooked wonderfully. It has a nice crust and was juicy and tender. My girlfriend loved the lobster.  These were good enough to bail out the bland and cheap food up until that point.

As a side note, I am not a seafood person but we went because my girlfriend is and they had a few (very few but understandable) options that were turf rather than surf based. I had gone in there with the intention of ordering the chicken but when I asked how it was prepared the waitress  said that it was just lightly sauteed with salt and pepper. Now I get that this is not the main attraction of the restaurant but if you're going to have an item on the menu don't completely half ass it. 

Over all: 4/10
I suppose if you want a lobster and nothing else and don't mind sitting in a depressing dining room this could be a winner for you. but I am serious, order your lobster and tell them they can just keep the sides. To be fair I believe the restaurant has recently changed hands and why our experience was not even reminiscent of the reviews on here from a while back."}
{"text":"Toni D. 
Can this place go downhill anymore than it already has. Who is managing this place. They should be fired. I have never seen such a Sh--t show in my life. Worst service I have ever had. It was busy when we were there and only 2 waitresses???Food was okay. But not worth the price we paid. I used to come here years ago.  It was great then. Here they pay you to come back. How sad is that. The wine selection is near to NONE. What's the story??? THE NEW NO FRILLS. With Pusateri prices.  1962 Avenue Rd. Thank God for Rodney's and Rock Lobster. It rocks there. Lobster Trap Avenue Rd just sucks. Won't see me again. They've reached their all time low."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for at least 20 years and have seen the quality decline significantly. It kills me to give this place two stars when the current owner, Tania, is the nicest lady ever, and tries so, so hard. But the quality of the food is really quite poor.

Lobster: The most common dish ordered here is, obviously, a whole lobster. You specify the size, starting at 1Ib for $40, 2 Ib is $75, up to 4Ib. Most people usually get 1.5 to 2 Ibs. 4Ib the meat will get tough. Option of steamed or broiled. Broiled is more tasty, but lots more butter. We came in a group of 9, and half the lobsters came out at room temperature, the rest lukewarm. Unfortunate.

Lobster bisque: I remember 10 years ago the lobster bisque was THE best soup in Toronto. Had lots of chunks of lobster, so much flavor, and so, so creamy, probably made with a bazillion calories of  real butter and cream. Now, for $11 a bowl, the butter and cream got replaced by cornstarch. The chunks of lobster got replaced by bits of undissolved cornstarch. No flavor. Just like the average cream soup in the grocery store. So disappointing.

Other food: Your meal starts with a free basket of garlic bread. Those are good. Salad, side rice, potato are all very bland. As is the pasta. They also offer non lobster things like steak, but I have never tried it.

Misc: 
Back then, there was ample waitstaff. They used cloth napkins / bibs and the waitstaff would come and help you put the bibs on. There were these flame heated glass bowls of butter for you to dip your lobster in. 
Now, on a weekday, there is only 1 person running the show - the owner herself, Tania. So service can be a bit slow. They use disposable napkins. Melted butter go in little disposable plastic cups so that the butter has coagulated and formed chunks at the bottom of the cup. 
There used to be a big tank of water with live lobsters swimming around, just inside the front door. While waiting to get seated, I loved watching all the lobsters that would later end up in my tummy. Now it is empty :( I guess not enough business or lobsters to justify filling the tank.

Service:
Tania, the current owner, is lovely. She's been there for over 30 years and she tries so hard to please the customers. She gave us extra lobster, extra lobster bisque, extra salads, extra dessert at the end. I wish I could give more stars based on how hard she tried...

Parking: 
There is some free parking on the side street and metered parking in front of the store on Avenue Road. Few spots at the back of the restaurant belonging to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Disgusting ! This was a family favourite years ago. The lobster was gross, old, chewy, over cooked and certainly not fresh.  Even the melted butter tasted odd, sweet. The charm is gone and I will never return.  200.00 for four dinners, no one finished their lobster it was so bad.
So sad and disappointing, I'm not sure if new owners or just very bad 'chef' on duty on Wednesday evenings."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in the city.  The best place for steamed lobster.  If you expect high end, modern, fancy, trendy ambiance, this place isnt for you.  The restaurant is a mom and pop style type place that tries to give the feel of being at a wharf.  They display the lobsters in this big gigantic aquarium at the entrance of the restaurant.

If you want good food and down to earth wait straff and low key restaurant, this is the place to go.

I always order the 1lb and a quarter lobster.  It comes with a side and they bring you garlic bread.  The lobster is very fresh and price is reasonable (around $35-$40 if you don't order drinks or anything else). The waitstaff doesn't try to upsell you on apetizers, wine, or dessert.

I have had lobster at Red Lobster and it isn't comparable.  I have also had lobster in Maine and cooked the Lobster fresh from T&T supermarket and by comparison, this place is very good. You won't be disappointed.

Service is ok but they are not most attentive when it gets busy.  The place gets full very quickly every time I have been there.  Restaurants that are not good do not usually get full and have low food turnover so you never know if what you are getting is fresh. This is a place that is always full and that people keep going back to. 

I highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"it'll be the first time and most likely the last time i'll go there.  i had high expectations of a place that has lobster in their name coupled with the fact that they are in one of the more higher end areas of the city. maybe that's the downfall.  from the outside, it looks like a place that you'd find in a old strip mall, and the interior's more of the same.  

when i saw that the food and wine menu were both laminated, i started to get an idea as to what i was getting myself into both pricewise and food quality. our server was not the most attentive to our needs even though we were a group of 12, and was noticibly pushing certain items on the menu.  there were also a couple of kids with us and she wasn't the most friendliest person with them, seemingly just focused on doin what she needed to do to make her coin and turning the table over. not that i find it wrong but it's not something i'd expect from a place that you're paying up to $94 for a four pound lobster. 

me and my friend ordered garlic shrimps to start. they were of a decent size and flavour but were lacked presentation and quantity for what we paid.  i'm not really concerned with presentation that much on the regular but the plate they served it on made it look like we weren't getting a lot or we were missing something.

we both ordered a 1lb lobster with baked potato and soup.  we were informed that the french fries were not available which again i wouldn't expect from a place where you are paying so much for your meal.  my soup was a new england clam chowder that was nothing special at all.  the soup nutsy or even the marche had better.  the baked potato was plain with just a small dollop of sour cream to consume it with.  the final item to arrive was the lobster.  i ordered for it to be broiled which it did but the 'stuff' (cause i don't really know what the heck they decided to put on it) just made it a very messy proposition to eat.  it didn't really do much to enhance the enjoyment of the lobster, and it made me wonder was it really worth the coin i just dropped for this.  the whole meal just tasted only just average.

the whole experience was topped off when our bill came and our waitress almost made it a point to point out that the gratuity was not included in our bill.  

if you really want lobster, i would just say to go to red lobster and do it there.  you'd probably pay just the same but the service would definitely be better and so would the flavours!!"}
{"text":"I have real nostalgia for this place. Foods just fine.  But c'mon what can you do with a lobster?  I'll keep goin to this place forever as long as they keep this seventies shuck shack decor!  Been going every five years since I was a kid!  Can anyone actually eat a four pound sea-bug? Now really."}
{"text":"I've been a good 5 times over the last 3-4 years, and everytime they manage to make a mistake on the bill.  First few times, I may have suspected it was just a mistake, but after that I can't help but to imagine they hope I didn't notice.

My last time visiting this place, they harassed me to give them more tip when I already gave 15%.  

It's a shame they need to pull these lowly tactics as I do enjoy the food."}
{"text":"I should mention that this place has been under a new management for the last few months (I overheard the new owner arguing with another customer).  We went with my friend's couple because they really liked the food and service last year.  

The food was not presented nicely, and while the lobster seemed fresh, the taste wasn't rich enough for the 1 1/2 broiled lobster ($49).  Lobster Thermidor tasted very creamy, without much taste.  

The service was just terrible.  We had to ask twice to get our second garlic bread; the waiter sure looked like he had forgotten about it -- he did not apologize about the delay.  It took them about 40 minutes to get our main entree and we didn't get our necessary condiments (butter for lobster and other seafood) until we were halfway done.  When we asked for the butter for the second time, he (the same waiter) mumbled something about there's not enough for every table as he was walking away.  Adding to what is becoming a bad dinner night, sauces for seafood and baked potato came in disposable ketchup cups that you see at McDonald's; they said they ran out of those 'aprons' to cover your shirt when eating lobster; and they also happened to run out of lobster cutters as well.  

We were trying to be nice on a Christmas Eve and look past all that since it was a relatively busy night (It's a Christmas Eve, so the 'new' owner should have got more people working), but when the time came to pay for our food and leave, the owner was giving us a very arrogant attitude, saying, \"What do you want me to do about it?\", not in a polite tone, to say the least.  Needless to say, I didn't feel like leaving a tip for such terrible service and not feel bad about it.  I have never left a restaurant feeling so disrespected after spending over $50 a person on what was passable food quality.  I get treated much better at Subway or McDonald's.  Maybe the new management will get their act together over time, but it's too late for me.  I do not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I have my Groupon and come to this restaurant.  We still remember how tasty it was before.  I heard that there are more than 6000+ such coupons being sold.

The first thing we notice from is that the menu has been changed and of course the price has been increased.  We order a 1 lb and another 1.25 lbs steamed lobster together with a soup and a salad.  There are 2 choices, either Lobster bisque or a clam chowder.  We are in a lobster restaurant and we order the Lobster bisque.  It comes with garlic bread as well.  It is half burn and hard, don't know whether they have been re-heated.

When the Lobster bisque arrived, it surprises us that the soup is creamy in color.  I still remember last time here in this restaurant and any other restaurants that I order the Lobster bisque is orange reddish in color.  It tastes like lobster meat in a cream soup.  I wonder whether the soup base for both clam chowder and lobster bisque are the same in the kitchen.  It is not real lobster bisque.  The salad is green salad, not much special.

Then the lobster comes, it tastes very good.  Not anything can beat a fresh lobster.  

We are too full to order any dessert.  We order coffee and tea.  We seat at the very end of the restaurant almost next to the washroom entrance door.  It is a bit hard to see the waitress.  When she comes and we let her know what we want, she sometime forgot us and we have to repeat our requests again.

The bottom line is the lobster is still very good but the lobster bisque is out and the price has been increased. The bill is $100 for 2."}
{"text":"Third time going to this restaurant.

Went there on a Sunday, place was packed and there was only one waitress serving the whole front side of the restaurant.  Super slow service and was not even offered water.  They really need to hire more staff on the weekends.  Due to the slow service, the waitress gave us complementary soups and pop which was nice - but dunno if that makes up for all the waiting.

Lobster was tasty and the mussels are my favorite. But the $35 steak was way too dry.  I swear the food was better when I was here a couple years ago.

For the six of us, with no alcohol, the bill came out to $300 before gratuities - quite expensive for the lack of service and atmosphere.  I used my buytopia vouchers but the damage to my wallet had already been done.

Verdict: At this price point, I would expect consistent food and better service.  This restaurant offers fine dining prices without the fine dining experience. For those who have never been, you can consider trying it at least once - rmb to check out the tank at the front of the shop. But I think 3 times is enough for me."}
{"text":"Surprised the restaurant is still around. I have been there twice with family n friends. The First experience was fantastic , things really went downhill on the second visit. Reservation doesn't seem to be taken seriously as the manager seem to prioritize her friends who did not make reservations. We waited 1 hr to her our appetizer, and 2 hours waiting for our main. The manager was just soo busy talking and taking care of her friends. The food was alright, but would I ever come back or recommend it to anyone ?"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me there for my birthday. Absolutely fell in love with the place. I had the steam 1lb lobster + lobster soup + dessert & my boyfriend had the broiled 2lb lobster + lobster soup + dessert.  Love it. :D price is fair and food is delicious. Awesome service."}
{"text":"My first experience with lobster was circa Hanukkah 1993. The irony of my family going out for un-kosher lobster on a Jewish holiday is certainly not lost on me. I had my brand new Molly doll from American Girl sitting next to me, and I, once known as the Princess of Picky asked to try a bite of my parents lobster.

The ended up having to order me my own.

And the rest is history. Although we had a mid-nineties flirtation with Red Lobster (the cheddar biscuits still haunt me) Lobster Trap is my family's go to for a lobster feast.

As others have mentioned, all lobster dinners (the only dinners with which I have any familiarity) start with the choice of starter and the amazing garlic bread. For the reviewer who called the garlic bread too buttery, there is NO. SUCH. THING.
The salad is fine, the chowder is good, but everyone knows you need to go for a big creamy bowl of lobster bisque. So good, I think I need to get a fix soon.

The main event is always good, obviously certain times of year are going to yield fresher results but I've never had an issue with less than delicious lobster. Is it as fresh as at a lobster pound in the Maritimes or New England? Nope. But a trip to the trap is definitely cheaper than a plane ticket!"}

After having a taste of lobster from Maple Yip the other day, my dad was surprised to see us enjoy lobster so much. He wanted me to look up lobster restaurants so we can go feast on it instead of having a tiny bit here and there. Lobster Trap has been on my go to list for awhile, but my family never really craves seafood so I never got a chance to go until this day.

Just like what I expected, it was a medium sized restaurant that had very laid back home feel to it. Maybe a little too laid back because when we walked in, they were so short on staff that we literally stood there for 5 minutes before we were approched.

There were 5 of us so we asked our server how much food would be enough for us and she said 6lbs of lobster from couple other dishes would be enough to fill us up.

Right after we sat down, we were given a baket of garlic bread. Ever since I moved to Toronto, I became a bread snob and the moment I saw these garlic bread...I knew they were made with the cheapest bread you can find!

But seriously, garlic and butter makes everything taste so good- and sometimes cheap stuff is so comforting! I couldn't resist but to have a piece of two making sure I don't fill myself up before the lobster feast.

Also keep in mind that they will refill the garlic bread for you if you want..but you don't want to fill up with carbs at a lobster restaurant, do you!?

While we were waiting for food, I realized it was getting really hot in the restaurant. The heat slowly creeped up on me, but I didn't think much of it until my forehead was covered in sweat. Why was the restaurant so hot!? especially a seafood restaurant? that's just so wrong. I asked the waitress if the AC was on, moments later she checked and said one of the AC in the main dining room wasn't turned on because they 'forgot' to turn it on.

Really? how can you forget to turn on AC? Can't you feel the heat? I looked around and everyone was dripping in sweats, that was not pleasant at all. At least few minutes after the AC was turned on (for goodness sakes), I could stop showering in my own sweat.

Ordered: Coconut Shrimps

* 5 pieces of coconut shrimps for $9.75
* Shrimps were butterflied and deep fried with actual coconut bits in the batter
* When it arrived, it was just luke warm
* And the sauce looked like it was from McDonalds (seriously?)
* I was the one who wanted to try them and boy, did I regret ordering these
* For $10, this was def not worth it

Ordered: Lobster Bisque

* Small personal lobster bisque for $8.95
* This wasn't very hot either but it was delicious!
* It is super creamy and rich with lobster meats
* My dad loved this and finished a entire cup himself
* It is def not cheap but very much worth it

Ordered: Jumbo Garlic Shrimps

* 9 jumbo shrimps Butterflied and Baked $25.50
* If lobster is not your thing, they always have shrimp dishes
* They were perfectly cooked and had good flavor with garlic bits
* It was kind of on the dry side but with the melted butter it was fine
* I just tried one of this and my sister had the rest of it

Ordered: 2lb Steamed Lobster & 4lb Broiled Lobster

* 2lb lobster was $57.00 and 4lb lobster is $97.00
* You can choose the lobster to be steamed or broiled
* I mostly had the broiled 4lb (obviously shared it with others)
* Steamed had much clean taste since no other seasoning was used
* Broiled lobster tasted more rich with the crust on top
* 4lb lobster was so huge the claw was as big as my face
* They get pretty messy to eat so you are given a plastic bib to put around your neck


Summary: I walked in not expecting much but I fully enjoyed the meal at The Lobster Trap. You can't really go wrong with lobster when they are fresh and I did enjoy the home cooked style the restaurant offered.

The only thing that irritated me was the whole situation with the AC (but that got fixed) and the way they present the bill at the end. I feel like in this day and age restaurants should have proper receipts clearly indicating what you ordered and how much you are getting charged for each dish. The bill I received at The Lobster Trap was hand written in scribbles and it was difficult understanding what it said so I had to ask the server couple times just to make sure. 

Other than that, I really enjoyed my meal at The Lobster Trap and if I am ever craving lobsters, I will be back!"}
{"text":"Ate here with my fiance about a year ago for a special occasion and their lobster bisque was so delicious! Their baked lobster was OK. Decor is really ugly and service was slow. But would go back just for the lobster bisque!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch after Williams Sonoma Warehouse sale before Christmas.   My wife and I ordered the seafood pasta dishes  and were disappointed with the slow service and watery tasteless sauce on our pasta despite not being busy.  Server told us to put salt and pepper on it.   Few shrimp or variety in pasta and lobster claw still in shell. 

Very expensive for what we got and poor quality.  We were not impressed and will not return.  We expected better."}

Lobster Trap is one of those old Toronto restaurants that never changes. This is both a good and a bad thing. 

The good - the food is really quite tasty. You may choose to have your lobster steamed or broiled (with breadcrumbs and butter). Both come with dipping butter on the side. The lobster is beautifully cooked - scrumptious, moist. 

As it is a family owned business, my guess is the service is just as good as it was 35 years ago. Your waitress will be a member of the family, and they know the place inside and out. Very family homey feel.

The only downside for me was the decor/atmosphere. AKA the bad - the place looks like it hasn't been renovated in 35 years. As an example, they provide the same napkins that I use at home, dulling the eating out experience a bit. However, if you know this is what to expect, the lobster is worth these downers. 

THE BOTTOM LINE: know you're not going to a white tablecloth place, but be rest assured the lobster is delicious."}
{"text":"Came on a Thursday night... only two waiters and the service was extremely slow. Food was so overly priced it was scary. $29 for 1 pound of steamed or boiled lobster??? Limited menu... furnishings and decorations from 50 years ago... terrible place for the price. If you'd like to feel ripped off then this is the ultimate place to go!"}
{"text":"Lobster Trap is always my favourite place in town for lobsters! I come here for years and it is always a pleasure! Their lobster bisque is the best in town! You have to try it! I always get 1.5 lbs lobster along with lobster bisque and salad. Tanya, is amazing, she is always welcoming! Superb! Strongly recommended!

PS: don't mess up this location with the Vaughan one, this is the original and the only Lobster Trap that opened for 50 years already. The Vaughan one just took the name and it is not the same owner. Make sure you go to the authentic lobster trap at Avenue Rd!"}
{"text":"One of my fave neighbourhood restaurants to go with my hubby, or bring friends and fam along. 

We usually get a lobster (maybe 1.5 lbs) broiled, salad, fries or roast potato, drink, garlic bread and awesome lobster bisque.  Seriously, we could have a pot of that delicious bisque every week and not get tired of it!    We tried the poached salmon before too, and it was tasty.  

The new owner, Tanya, who previously worked here when she was not the owner, is a very sweet lady.   I enjoy giving my business to establishments that are so friendly and welcoming.  

The decor is older, but I think it's part of of the charm of this restaurant.  Just enjoy it.  

I did not know this before, but after years of going to this restaurant, I found out that the \"new Lobster Trap\" in Vaughan mills is not associated with this one!  The Vaughan Mills one apparently stole the logo, name, reputation, etc. and pretends that it's affiliated with this one... but it isn't.  That sounds very disreputable to me.  I would welcome the Vaughan owners to contact me if this is not the case, and I'll edit my reply accordingly.  

Please do visit this Avenue Road restaurant, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Okay to be fair we went on a bad time so we didn't get to experience the place as we liked.  Apparently everyone's Groupon was expired the next day so there were so many people.  The sad part was they only had 2 wait staff and they didn't seem to care (well the younger one basically told us in our face she don't care and just want to go home, that she served over 1000 people today).   No one was taking ey said care of the wait line so a random dude took out paper and start compiling a list, he even helped cleaned the table.  When he told us he didn't work there, I was surpised and didn't know if he was joking or not.  Well, the worst part is we made reservations and the young wait staff was like we don't take reservations.  Which pissed us off as we called in twice and everything was okay.  Good thing the older staff which was the one that took the call remembered and told us it is okay.  We still had to wait over 1 hour for a table as everyone else that came in 2 took all the tables before us so resevration was useless as it was a zoo in there.  

The food itself was okay (heard the partner splitted and there is another location in Vaughn but it is even worst there).  We got the 2 pound lobster each with the upgrade combo with soup and drink.  We got free garlic bread as well.  (It was so busy no one was allow to pick their own lobster)

I guess I will have to come back next time and see how it is."}
{"text":"I travel this neighbourhood fairly often and had always been curious about lobster trap. I've often walked by and seen messy tables but rarely people and now I know why. I went for dinner with my in laws hoping to get a nice seafood dinner after reading some good reviews about the food. Upon arrival the decor is very dated and tacky, everything  looked dusty and unkempt but they had just opened for service so we decided to sit. The waitress sat us in an odd and unfavourable location despite being the first and only customers there. We also noticed all the tables were set overnight so everything was a little dusty on the table. All of our cutlery and glasses had food stuck to them. When we asked the waitress for replacements she said they were all like that then started rubbing them with a cloth from her belt and said she would just dip them in water for us. This pretty much threw everyone's appetite for lobster trap so we decided to leave. If they can't keep the front of the house clean I doubt the kitchen is run much better. Would have loved to have tried the food but the staff need to do better."}
{"text":"I am not a huge lobster fan by any means, but upon my first visit to Canada from the United States, my co-workers and I were taken to this lovely gem! 

The food was fresh and worth the extra spend.  I particularly loved the guitarist in the room over.  He was very spunky and even played my request of \"Tiny Dancer\" by Elton John!  Great food and live entertainment? I'd say I definitely got a bang for my buck!"}
{"text":"Like some of the other reviewers, I too came to The Lobster Trap years ago and found that my experience last night didn't compare to what I was used to.  This used to be an amazing lobster restaurant! What happened?

We arrived to an empty hostess desk and had to wait a few minutes to be seated.  The restaurant needs to be updated.  It looks the same as it did ten years ago, only older. 

Our server messed everything up.  My friend and I ordered:
The muscles appetizer 
One lobster combo
One lobster
2 glasses of white wine. 
Price: $140 (before tip)
Thank goodness I had a $70 voiture!

What we got was:
2 lobster combos and the muscles served in an awkward order. At times we had several dishes on the table at once. BTW we were NOT there late. There was no reason to rush our meal like that. 

I ended up with a lobster bisque -- which was too creamy and very skimpy on the lobster. 
The lobster was tasty.
The muscles were good and fresh. 
The salad was wilted and my friend got the wrong dressing. 

Each time the waitress brought something erroneously, she was gone before we could tell her. This was plop food on the table service. Not \"I care if you have a good meal\" service. Which is fine for a $50 or less meal. Not for $140."}
{"text":"The first thing that greets you at the Lobster Trap is an overwhelming stench of mold coming from the 35 year old carpets. It appears that the jumbo sized hot tub (? No, I'm not making this up - it's the lobster display!), has leaked more than a few times. I can only imagine the rotting slime underneath that carpet, and if I had been wearing sandals, would have run screaming.

I thought the food and price must be outstanding to compensate for the state of the restaurant, and gasp when I open the menu. The cheapest entree is $38.00. (You can get Ahi Tuna, Potato Samosa, and Cauliflower from George, one of the finest restaurants in the city, for $28.00). Most of the wine is $18- $19.00 A GLASS.  The entrees are served with stale, chewy, garlic bread made from garlic powder and your choice of either salad,OR  baked potato OR Uncle Ben's rice.  $38.00 for 10 shrimps, and they can't throw in a 25 cent potato? The salad is chopped, tasteless lettuce, with half a styrofoamy tomato on top, and your choice of Kraft dressing.  The lobster is very good, but small for $40.00.

The staff is lovely and the service is flawless. I really want this place to survive. I do. Here's how.

1./ Get a loan and tear out the carpet, you'll probably have to replace most of the floorboards too. Put in laminate. Do whatever it takes to get rid of the mold. Buy a lot of bleach.
2./ Put the lobsters in a tank, don't use up half of your dining room with a hot tub. It's not the kind of weird that's cute, it's just creepy.  Paint the walls. Keep the rest of the decor the same - it's charming, and will contrast well with a new floor.
3./ Get your chef to go on-line and learn how to make garlic bread, salad, and dressing- if you can't find a bakery, just use Ace. Or hire a chef who knows how to cook.
4./ You can keep your prices the same if you have a vegetable, salad, and potato or rice with the entree.

The staff here obviously love this place, and it is an institution worth saving."}
{"text":"The family charm of this longtime Toronto favorite is a quiet miracle. We hadn't been here since our last visit to the city over six years ago, and tonight was our first time meeting the young lady who now runs the place. The care she put into making sure we were happy was absolutely amazing and we had a great time."}
{"text":"Lobster Bique is one of the best soups that I have had in a while.

The place is pretty packed for a snow-storm, was wondering why even though it is so busy that they only have one person serving so many tables. Puzzled- as there seems to be other people complaining about service. MEH

Experience. I got the $33 for $70 Groupon Deal. I cannot complain what so ever.  Soup was great- Lobster was splendid (no sure if that was 2 1/2 pounds). 

Salad was horrible- PASS on it... overall I would do the groupon deal anytime. 

My review would be very very different if I didnt get that deal. Worth the value!"}
{"text":"Went there yesterday with a coupon for a New York style lobster dinner for 2.
I was there in the 70's when it was THE place to go for Lobster.
I called to make reservations as the coupon instructed, and there was a message telling me to leave my name and number if I wanted to make a reservation. So I did, also saying to please call me back to confirm. When I did not get a return call within 24 hours, I called again and spoke to Tonya.
Tonya explained that the reason she sometimes does not return calls is because sometimes she does not properly hear the messages that are left. I left my number very clearly twice in my message, which I always do.
I asked what a New York style lobster dinner consisted of and was told shrimp, mussels and a 1.5 lb. lobster.
When we arrived at 5:45 PM, I noticed that the large tank at the entrance that used to contain all of the live lobsters, was empty and the place smelled very musty.
 We sat for quite a while before Tonya approached to take our order, even though there were only 2 other tables occupied at that time. She did not even come with water to pour into our glasses.I then asked for another bread plate. It was dirty and did not even match my date's bread plate. The knife was also dirty and the cutlery looked like the same ones I used in 1972.
As she was leaving with our order, we had to ask for some water.
Shortly thereafter came the bread, our salad and a cold soup, all at the same time. I did not bother returning the soup as I already couldn't wait to leave.
Then came the main course platter. Instead of the 1.5 lb. lobster I was promised, there were 3 tiny lobster halves (maybe from a .5 -.75 lb. lobster) but no claws whatsoever. Each tail was basically one bite.
Besides the fact that the salt shaker on the table was virtually empty, I asked for some fresh pepper. No such luck. After being open for over 50 years, How much of an investment would a pepper mill be?
After being there 45 minutes and finished our meal, I asked for the bill and also asked why there were no claws on our lobsters. She explained that because they were so small, she removed them. lol How ridiculous! They are either buying very cheap canners with not even one claw, or, because there were no lobsters in their tanks, I was eating a dead, frozen lobster.
If she removed the claws from the lobster because they were too small, perhaps the lobsters were too small to serve in the first place. Did she really expect me to believe that nonsense? Where is the 1.5 lb. lobster I was promised? How many lies must one endure?
I waited quite a while for the bill to arrive. Instead, Tonya was nice enough to bring 2 nice sized claws. This was the best part of the meal and there was more meat in the claws than in the tails we had.
It still took forever to get the bill and I had to ask for it again. I couldn't wait to leave.
We were given a $30 credit toward our next meal, which I will never use.
If people in New York had a New York style lobster dinner like this one, they would never eat out again.
I hate being lied to.
I will not return.
So sad."}
{"text":"Went once and never again. It was supposed to be a special occasion and both the food and service were not great. Maybe I was spoiled after spending 5 years in an ocean town... or maybe I did not have the required nostalgic thoughts towards the resto... or maybe it was just a bad night.

Lobster YUM! Lobster Trab yuk.

10 years ago this place was run down, and from the outside it has not been touched. Like their website this place is dated.

http://www.thelobstertrap.ca/Lobster/index.htm

There must be something great about the Trap though. It has been in business for decades."}
{"text":"My parents came here on a date in the 70s and I bet those are the same fishing nets and conches that made their night as it did mine.

I've been here numerous times.  Once I even came for a week day lunch but noticed they were closed.  There were boxes and boxes of fresh flown in lobsters from the East Coast just sitting there by the door.  I guess I am the only cold hearted customer who would even think to pick up a box and run to the closest  boiling salted pot.

I usually come with my boyfriend he gets the broiled 2 lb lobster dinner and I the garlic prawns.  Add to that 2 Lobster Bisques, coconut shrimp, and sometimes another Lobster Bisque.  I capitalize the 'Lobster Bisque' because it deserves to be addressed as so.

Very delicious and the perfect amount of saltiness in the bisque.  And actual chunks of lobster.  Comes served hot with a smile no matter how busy they get.
Note:  this is known to be a saltier soup so if you are opposed to salt.... I suggest you order something else

The coconut shrimp are medium sized and delicious but obviously they ordered it frozen and already prepped.  

Did I mention the garlic bread?  It's tough to control yourself when you first get there on an empty stomach.  If you can't fight the extra butter and garlic then just go ahead and cram it in there.  You can always doggy bag.  If you order a second order of bread and not eat it, you can include that in your bag as well!

I am not a fiend of lobster like some but I do eat it.  I've tried my bf's meal and the lobster is done to perfection.  Still full of juice with that lobster brine flavour still intact.  Great portion as well.  Some times he has to take it home.  I think that's why he orders the larger lobsters on the occasion.  So smart is he.

We contemplated ordering the 5 pounder but really... that is just a show piece right?  Wouldn't that make the lobster almost 30 years old?  He should be honoured instead as a pet at the Lobster Trap.  Have him in a large aquarium at the front complete with a plastic diving bell and soothing bubbles.  Afterall, he lived for so long and never got caught!

The giant garlic prawns have never sold me short.  They are juicy and broiled and just enough of them.  It's almost like eating 10 little lobsters!  Don't quote me on the 10... that was just a guess from the last time I was there.

Service is always friendly and they are rammed on Saturdays.  Worth the visit for sitting in a theme restaurant that never really mean to be a themed restaurant = authenticity."}
{"text":"We haven't been in a while and it was fabulous. Best lobster I've ever had. The service was wonderful also. My son has lobster thermador and loved it. I love the atmosphere as it takes you to the east coast. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Bought a $75 groupon dinner for 4 people.  Showed up with reservations on a friday evening and ordered 8
$80 worth of food.  Waiter and this tiny little short girl who is the manager say they cannot redeem me the full value of my groupon because my kids are not adults and thus we are not a group of 4!!!!  Where the F__k does it say this on the fine print?! I complained to them that this is BS.  Tiny little short girl manager says i can give you what you paid for your groupon and redeems 36.50 on my final bill after taxes.  I ended up paying way more than i expected for food that was just average at best.  Their steak was dry and not even done to what i requested as it came well done when i asked for medium rare.  Their lobster is not tasty and their portion sizes are small.  Would never come back to this restaurant even if they had a 50% off deal.  Stay away from this restaurant you have been warned."}
{"text":"I'm not a lobster fisherman nor a commodities economist when it comes to seafood but when I'm used to lobster prices at Chinese restaurants, this place I find is a bit on the pricier side. That said, each of the times I've gone, they've delivered a perfectly cooked lobster to my table.

The atmosphere and decor is similar to \"mom & pop\" seafood places found in the Atlantic so don't expect anything high-end.  It's more about character. Sadly, with my most recent visit, there were no place mats on the table with a map of the Atlantic or interesting lobster facts.  More importantly, I did not get a bib to protect my shirt when I ate my lobster. The price of the dishes haven't changed in over a year so I guess by removing some of the frills, they were able to prevent raising the menu prices.

The service was friendly but they only had one waitress for the entire place.  I guess because it was a Tuesday, they weren't expecting it to be a busy night. We did get our food hot out of the kitchen so even though we didn't get too much attention during the course of our visit, they met the expectations when it came to the kitchen-to-table timing.

They tend to participate in the group deal sites so that could be why they were busy on the Tuesday.  Also, it's with these group deal sites that I would recommend you giving them a try (if you haven't already)."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend had a fabulous time at Lobster Trap, it felt very homey and we had great service. I had made reservations ahead of time incase it was packed, but we did arrival earlier than anticipated and there was plenty of room. We ordered the escargot, seafood platter (I think that's what it was called, it consisted of shrimp, salmon, lobster tail, and another type of fish...all very delicious), and 1.5lbs of lobster broiled (highly recommend very delicious), garlic bread, and baked potato.The owner also gave us free soup (the lobster bisque) which was amazing!! I mentioned at then end of our dinner that it was my boyfriend's birthday and she was very kind to offer us cake but we were both full. 
Excellent service and food."}
{"text":"Nice and fresh. I suggest a large bowl of lobster bisque! If you are not in the mood for fish or lobster, go elsewhere. The selection is small but what they serve, they do well. The pound + broiled always gives the best flavour, dip into the utter and enjoy! Other places don't compare."}
{"text":"Guilt trip....  don't bother going through the menu...  the owner or chef or waitress.... who runs the whole \"show\" will give you her recommendation.  It's not like it was 10 years ago.  Out of style....  out dated...  I was disappointed..."}
{"text":"Tonight was our first visit to the Lobster Trap in a number of years.  It used to be a special date-night destination for us, but we returned this time with our two sons, excited to share a wonderful memory.  We were so terribly disappointed.  The restaurant smelled of must, the lobster tank was filthy and was in desperate need of a cleaning. Table cloths had a plastic cover on them and smelled like they were wiped with a dirty rag.  The carpet was in need of a vacuum. This should have prepared us for the meal we were about to receive. The Lobster bisque was a floured concoction with no lobster meat to be found. The clam chowder was over-seasoned with thyme and heavily floured as well. The 1 1/4 lb lobsters we ordered were so small we could hardly get any meat out of the claws.  The market price for 1 lb of crab legs was $63 and they were water logged because they had been previously frozen.Our waitress neglected us entirely, bringing our meals out at different times...our sides didn't show up until we were halfway through our seafood and we had to ask for drink refills and missing items. The bill, with tip, came to $340 which was outrageous for the quality of food we received and the horrible service.  There are hundreds of other restaurants in this fabulous city that deserve your patronage. Don't give it to this one."}
{"text":"stood at the door for 10mins till the first server came and only said to the person in front of us it will be couple more mins. Didn't even look at us. -_- what's the point for making reservation? And another 10mins passed by... I m still standing there will NO one to speak to yet as I m writing this"}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant many years ago and really really enjoyed it.  I recently found a deal for $25 for $50 worth of food at the Lobster Trap and decided to re-visit this restaurant.  

We ordered the following dishes:
1) Coconut shrimps: The coconut shrimps were quite good with batter around it and lots of coconut shreds.  I did however find it quite oily but because I was ordering something fried...duh - it's going to be oily. 

2) Lobster meal (1 lb): The lobster was split in half and my friend and I each got a half.  The dish was again quite oily but the flavour was quite good.  There was freshness preserved but I've definitely had better lobster in the past.  However, for $30, you get what you pay for.  

3) Mussels meal: It was like any other mussels I've had before.  They didn't pop out at me.  They could have used bigger mussels but they didn't.  

Overall: 

FOOD: 3/5 stars - It was A-OK.  Nothing was horrible tasting but nothing really popped out at me.  I remember the Lobster Trap in its glorious days as a restaurant that people wanted to go to for special occasions.  I now see the place filled with Groupon dealers (including myself). 

AMBIANCE: 1/5 stars - OK..they REALLY need TLC to come in and do a \"Restaurant Makeover\" rendition for this place.  The seats are half broken and I was definitely sitting on a replacement cheap chair tonight.  The place looks like it's going to fall apart.  The washroom is 80 years old.  

SERVICE: 3.5/5 stars - They were initially slow to take our order but the waitress came and moved things along and our food came on time.  She even gave us a $20 voucher at the end.   

The fact that the place is now filled with \"Deal-finders\" & \"Groupon-ers\" makes me a little skeptical as to how sustainable this place is.  The fact that we got a $20 coupon afterwards made me feel a bit sorry for the place.  Is it really doing this badly?  Pricing wise, it's really not that bad.  I've been to way more expensive seafood places but they've also served way better seafood.  You basically get what you pay for.  

The place is definitely under-staffed and it's definitely not the waiters and waitresses faults for not being up to par with service.  It's the guy up there who owns and manages the place.  I hope he/she is reading these reviews.  

The person up there who manages needs to take into consideration: 
- Restaurant make-over (BIG TIME) unless he/she plans to close this business in the next couple of months
- Staffing - hello, stop making your staff run around like their heads are cut off.  
- Quality - they really need to re-evaluate the quality of this food

Unless the manager/owner wants to keep this place a Groupon Haven, they better smarten up and re-vamp this restaurant to make it look better and present better and perhaps revise their menu as well.  I hope they are taking all these Yelp reviews into consideration because really, why I am I even wasting my time typing this if they're not going to be receptive to change/improvement?"}
{"text":"Came here in a group of 4 using a voucher I had purchased from buytopia ($30 for $70 worth of food on weekdays or for $60 on weekends) on Saturday. It is located on a busy road so as far as I know you need to pay for parking on Avenue Road ($2.25 per hr). It started getting quite busy around 6:30pm so I suggest making the reservation earlier -- like 5pm. 

ATMOSPHERE: it's an old restaurant, so everything is kind of old and rusty, but has a vintage feel to it. There are live lobsters by the entrance and you see the kitchen staffs going back and forth to grab the lobsters, so you know they are fresh. The table setting was pretty bad though - they had placed all 4 sets of utensils facing one direction. I mean - if there are 2 people on each side facing each other, 2 sets of utensils need to face one direction and the other 2 need to face the other (pic posted for those that don't get what I'm saying :p). It's no biggie but it's something they need to pay attention to. 

SERVICE: They open at 5pm and we went in at 5:10pm but no one was at the table and few other groups were waiting there for about 5 minutes until the hostess finally came. 
Also, the water was not even served until 10 minutes after we were seated and it smelled really strongly like chlorine!!! or some other chemical! like realllllly strong - we all couldn't drink more than a few sips. Maybe this is some kind of bad business tactic to make the customers to order other beverages? 
Prior to visiting, I read that this place is under new management and the quality of food and services have gone down. So we wanted to try some appetizers and lobsters before we decided ordering more entrees. When the waitress (who seemed like the owner) took our orders of 4 appetizers and a 1 1/4 lobster, she was all like \"you're in a group of 4, you need to order at least 2 entrees\". This was neither written on their website nor in the fine prints section of the voucher. When we told her we will order later, she said \"The kitchen gets very busy and it'd be better if you ordered now.\" Ummm... Okay? I guess we as customers need to consider THAT far. Anyways, fine, we decided to change our order and get lobster grandin (appetizer $12), garlic jumbo shrimp (entree $32), and 1 1/4 steamed lobster (entree $36) for now to see how the food is then get more later if we like the foods (yes we were that scared). Funny thing is, the waitress/owner, who was not very pleased that we were reluctant to order more food, actually put on a lobster bisque ($10) on the bill without even asking us and brought 3 bowls, saying \"oh you must try the soup, it's really good. I brought 2 extra.\" I was not very happy that she had put a dish without even asking us although she did bring extra, because if she really wanted all 4 of us to try it, she should have either made it free or brought 3 extra since there were FOUR people sitting at the table. Well, whatever.

FOOD: the food came pretty fast probably because we came as soon as it opened. garlic bread was alright - nothing special. lobster bisque ($10) was pretty good - I think this is their specialty since the owner wanted us to try it so bad. lobster grandin ($12) was alright. Really greasy and small in portion for what it is. 1 1/4 steamed lobster ($36) served with butter was average. It was really just steamed, seriously nothing special, I'm not sure why they jack up the prices so much for what I can easily make for $10-15. Rice came with it and it was super bland. Garlic jumbo shrimps ($32) were good, but again, nothing special. And I'd like to quickly add that I got bad stomachache two hours later. 

OVERALL: Generously putting it, everything about the food was really below average and definitely NOT worth all that money. I know seafood is expensive, but for the high price I'm paying and the small portion I get, I expect some kind of uniqueness and exceptional quality in the food and good service from the servers. Service was below average -- the waitress was trying to be nice and friendly but it seemed pretty fake. I'm just glad that we were using a voucher and that we didn't order too many dishes which I'm sure we were going to be disappointed in.  Lobster Trap didn't turn out to be one of those restaurants that offer a good discount (through a voucher) and still offers excellent customer experience thus make customers return. I do not recommend this place to anyone - you can find other excellent seafood restaurants in a similar price range and Lobster Trap cannot compete with them."}
{"text":"My boyfriend is a bit of a seafood connoisseur, so after eating crab and lobster a dozen of times at Chinese restaurants, Red Lobster and at home, we decided to go for something different.   
Now, if you're interested in getting a real seafood experience, i.e. digging into the seafood and not just eating the claw/tail of the lobster, then go here!  If you're not open minded enough to try eating the body of the lobster or would like to stick to seafood that doesn't really look like seafood, then go to Red Lobster.
We started off with the lobster bisque (soup) that was so creamy and delicious that we had to eventually go home and try to replicate it.  At $5 a bowl, it was a great value with real chunks of lobster right in there.
Then we both shared a huge lobster, I believe it was 6-7lbs that we hand picked from their aquarium.  We chose the steamed method of cooking (there was steamed or deep-fried) because we felt that it would bring out the taste of the lobster best, while keeping it nice and juicy (which it was).  They steamed the lobster and split it right down the middle!
It was a lot easier to eat than I thought.  All the meat was sitting right there in the body part and it was so sweet and the brains were delish!  The way they cut it made it so easy, we barely needed the cracker.  The waitress even puts on a bib for you so you don't make a mess on your clothes.
I think this place is great to explore lobster eating.  As for decor, it kind of feels like you're inside a really old wooden boat I guess, but then again that's not what I'm really there for.  The only thing that I feel could use some improvements are their side dishes.  Their rice is just plain white rice, which they ask if you want soy sauce on and their garlic bread is just really mediocre."}
{"text":"I came here with few friends because of I bought two coupons of  $40 for $80 of expenses.

We actually came here twice because first time we came here around 7:30pm and the place was so packed that we were told to wait for 1hr. We left for another restaurant instead. 

I called the restaurant to book a table, the owner refused to take any reservation less than 6 people, and if you want to come here at 6pm, he said you just walk in because people don't really show up till 6:30pm.

We actually went there EARLY for the 2nd time, we went there just before 6pm. It was empty, only few table were occupied, which was great!

We were greeted by a friendly waitress and she patiently wait for our order and answered all our questions.

We have a party of 5, so we ordered a 2 1/2 lobster for 2 ppl and 4lb lobster for 4ppl. We also ordered lobster bisque on the side. 

The meal came with garlic bread (Delicious but very buttery!), potato or fries or salad. We ordered baked potato and fries.

Both lobster is huge! I would say go for the boiled lobster for most bang for your buck. The boiled version they mix the breadcrumb with herbs and butter and baked it wit the lobster. Certainly not the healthy version but it is delicious! The lobster is certainly fresh and not over cooked.

The downside is the side of potato or fries, the portion does not match what you ordered. They would give more garlic bread because of the amount of people but they wouldn't give more fries. It is odd!

Total for each of us came to be around 30 dollar including the use of the coupon, taxes and tips. Not bad, but I would not do this everyday.  It is certainly good for special occasion, but I wouldn't do this without a coupon either. It is expensive without the discount coupon!"}
{"text":"Lobster Trap is an establishment. It's a piece of history. 

There's a marked difference in the Trap of 10 years ago versus today - there's definitely a need for an update and some TLC. 

But putting ambiance aside, the service is still as personable as ever and the food is still great."}
{"text":"Tried it last week and was a major disappointment.  This place use to be cool. I could stand the poor decor and service when the food was good. But when the bread is weak, bisque is light and lobster sucks. It's hard to take on all the other negatives. Really regret buying those deals to come back to this place. Stay away. Something happened here. Either new staff or owners."}
{"text":"I tried the lobster trap tonight for my Birthday dinner walking in I will admit could tell it was a seafood place just by the Decor pictures of lobsters and lobster traps on the walls over all was a very nicely decorated place. The menu is a bit confusing on a few items and could use to be a bit more detailed. I ordered the clam chowder $10 witch was pretty good. For dinner I ordered the 2lb king crab dinner market price witch was $86 and a lobster tail $ while we were at the table a waitress was showing a almost four lb lobster to a child I must admit looked delicious. On the way out to have a smoke I noticed the lobster tank ( don't know why I did notice this when I came in ) it is a open top tank that you can look in and and see all the lobsters. One thing I found out is if you want a candle for your butter you have to ask or they will bring it in a little cup ( if your a seafood fan you want the piping hot butter ) My meal comes my crab is cut into small pieces witch I am not a fan of  Prefer the whole legs (personal preference) they were cooked perfect. The lobster tail came with a bread crumb topping on it and was slightly over cooked but still good. The service was a little slow but still ok. All in all I would return to the lobster trap."}
{"text":"My parents took me and my sister here for a Christmas dinner without claiming it was going to be a Christmas dinner... and I'm glad they did!

The decor is not classy, I'd say it's very family-like. Nothing special. Reminds me of 'The Fishouse'. 

I don't even know why, but I wasn't craving lobster at the LOBSTER trap so I searched the menu for something I was craving - MUSSELS. Oh lord. I fuckin' love mussels. (Recommend me a place if you know good ones please). So, my parents ordered 2 2lb lobsters and I ordered a mussel appetizer and my sister got the butterfly shrimp. 

Each lobster came with a soup, salad and free garlic bread. Who the hell doesn't like garlic bread? Their bread was good but too much butter and tad too salty. The lobster bisque soup was great. It actually had chunks of lobster meat! Very creamy and thick. (I took my moms soup since I only ordered an appetizer) BUT to my suprise, the mussel appetizer was HUGE. I could not even finish it myself. Oh my god. It was honestly the best mussels I've tasted. It was the most common broth used for mussels, YES you guessed it! White wine! Simple yet oh so good. And asbolutely no need for the side of butter. They were PLUMP, JUICY, and most importantly, F-R-E-S-H. Like, you'd think they have an ocean in their parking lot or something...

Oh, I also took a few bites of my parents lobster. One had it broiled and one had it steamed. I definately liked the steamed more simply because I think by steaming your seafood it just allows the natural flavours to shine more, which it did. And as for my sisters shrimp, it wasn't anything special really. Then again, it might be because I'm not a huge shrimp fan.

I should mention that they gave took 10-15% of our bill and gave us Lobster Trap money with that. I have $15 dollars I can still use. Pretty awesome! MORE MUSSELS MORE MORE MORE!!!!

Overall: Seafood is fresh, but it's $$$!  !^_^!   Two thumbs up."}
