{"text":"Locale che esaudisce le aspettative del suo nome...bohéme e cioè vita povera e disordinata, ma libera e anticonformista, che fu caratteristica soprattutto di artisti della seconda metà dell'Ottocento (definizione dizionario Garzanti). Quindi? Locale originale e libero...alla mano, che non ha pretese ma allo stesso tempo ti trasmette qualcosa....CASA! Cibo buono, fresco e naturale. Personale gentile e disponibile. Prezzi nella norma. Approvo"}
{"text":"We dropped by for lunch after taking the ferry over the river. Service was friendly and the food was average. My mom and I had the soup of the day with bread and my sister had a flatbread. The place is clean with a cute rustic chic decor. We would stop here again for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Café Bohème is a very cute spot in Tadoussac. They have a nice selection of brunch items which all seem so delicious!
We came here on a Sunday around 8:30 am and sat outside. Their patio is very cute, it's a quiet neighbourhood. The indoor seating of the restaurant looked pretty good as well. It is cosy and nicely decorated.

Let me tell you about the food... Amazing!! Every single item that we ordered was delicious!

The staff is friendly and speaks both French and English fluently.
The prices are very acceptable for what you are ordering.
Café Bohème was definitely a highlight of our weekend in Tadoussac, and I would recommend it for anyone coming to this town.
Merci Café Bohème pour le service, le delicieux and généreux petit déjeuner! :)"}
{"text":"süsses kleines Café!
Schöne Auswahl an Süssem."}
{"text":"Délicieux! Demi pizza marguerita/bacon, frites allumettes au parmesan et un smoothie coconut/ananas. Miam! Et le personnel est super sympathique."}
{"text":"I'm glad I checked Yelp. This place was just what I was looking for. It's a nice reasonably priced restaurant with great little outdoor seating. I was on my own and was well attended and not rushed at all. Food was delicious and the atmosphere was great. I recommend it."}
{"text":"Stayed in Tadoussac for whale watching as a french canadian tourist for 3 days. In those three days we've been here twice. On both occasions, the food wasn't that bad, but it was by far over priced. Definitely sub-par to what we had paid for. Staff was unfriendly, screwed up our order, talked back with snarky undertones on either occasions, and made it seem as if though we were bothering them. I. e. waited 5+ minutes just to get seated (with no line, plenty of seats available, in front of a sign which says to wait to get seated), awkwardly staring at all the hostesses passing by until we asked one of them if they could give us a seat, to which she responded by laughing at the fact we were just waiting there. Overall, wouldn't go as far as to say to avoid; food remains pretty decent, but I'd say lower your expectations. This place looks and feels much nicer than it really is."}
{"text":"Excellent service and great food. My vegetarian friends worry not they have got you covered here!"}
{"text":"Great little cafe in beautiful Tadoussac - easily THE place to eat in this area! We had dinner there one night on our trip and we liked it so much we came back for breakfast. 

We ordered the three cheese pizza and lobster mac and cheese - both were good but the pizza was perfect! Soft dough with just the right amount of crisp, and plenty of gooey cheesey goodness! The apple and candied pecans were an awesome touch. I would go back to tadoussac for that alone!

Our waitress at dinner was wonderful, but I will admit that the service at breakfast was sub par. I chose to chalk that up to one person rather than the establishment itself though! 

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Tadoussac c'est un peu un repaire à touristes... Alors quand il s'agit de trouver un endroit où se régaler on se méfie....! Le café bohème nous l'avons trouvé par hasard au bout de la rue de notre hôtel et grâce aux bons avis yelp nous avons décidé de pousser la porte...
Gros coup de coeur pour les nachos qui ont su nous rassasier après une longue journée passée sur le fjord à la découverte des magnifiques paysages de la région."}
{"text":"La devise du Café Bohème c'est : \"bien manger, bien boire, bien vivre\". Vous y trouverez petit déjeuner, brunch, déjeuner, thé, pâtisseries et dîner. C'est le coup de cur de mon guide (lonely planet). J'ai bien aimé l'ambiance du café. La cuisine est simple, copieuse et très correcte.

Si vous aimez le poisson fumé, testez aussi la Galouine, juste à quelques mètres (et puis leur tarte au sucre...j'en rêve encore...)
Le WiFi gratuit est dispo au café Bohème et à l'auberge de la Galouine.


NB : A Tadoussac, peu de gens le savent mais il y a une vieille spécialité : la tarte au vinaigre ! Pas de panique, c'est très bon, ça a le goût de la tarte au citron. Malheureusement, aucun de ces deux restaurants ne la proposent (snif)"}
{"text":"REALLY good food, especially the desert we had the \"Explosion Choco-Caramel\" and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Nice and cosy bistro with great pastries, excellent pizzas, super burgers and thin french fries. Try the local Vire Capot beer (0.5l)"}
{"text":"Serveuse super sympa et la nourriture était très correcte ! De belles moules et les pizzas étaient bien!"}
{"text":"Côté rapport qualité prix je suis très satisfait. Nous avons bien mangé en comparaison aux autres restaurants dans le coin. La nourriture était fraîche et de qualité. Je recommande !"}
{"text":"This is maybe my favourite restaurant in Tadousac, we come here twice during our whale watching trip. Highly recomended."}
{"text":"Un lieu incontournable de restauration à Tadoussac : les plats y sont bons et abordables, le personnel souriant et agréable. N'hésitez pas à aller y déguster un     bagel ou un burger avec mention spéciale pour les desserts"}
{"text":"We loved the food!! I ate the Mac and cheese with lobster and it was delicious. Then my husband had the moose and enjoyed it. My son at the pizza and he ate everything. It was a tasty meal. Dinner is a little pricey but the food is delicious!! We even had a customer play piano while we ate which was very nice. The waiter was patient and very nice."}
{"text":"Had dinner here one night and enjoyed the atmosphere.  Food was good, had the Mac and cheese with duck.  Would recommend for a casual fun dinner out."}
{"text":"Nous cherchions un resto avec des options végés dans le coin, et nous n'avons pas été déçu. Le burger au tofu était très bon, quoique il faut aimer le vinaigre balsamique et j'ai bien aimé mes cannelloni au fromage. Les portions étaient parfaites et la déco était pile sur le style de resto. Il y a aussi un menu pour enfant de disponible.
Je garde ce resto dans mes signets pour une voyage futur."}
{"text":"Cute cafe in Tadoussac!!!!  They carry soy milk and have dark chocolate for sale.  Also a veg burger option (not sure if vegan?).  Indoor and outdoor seating.  Friendly staff and a great place to go if you need a pick-me-up.  Since it can be hard to find vegan options in this area, this place is def go-to with their soy milk and dark chocolate.  I got a chai here and it was yummy!"}
{"text":"Very nice Cafe! We ordered 3 pizza, a smoked salmon salad and 3 dessert. Excellent!!!! Food very fresh and taste great! Very recommended!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Very sweet atmosphere, especially sitting outside for dinner and watching passers-by. Waitstaff is friendly and bilingual, and our waiter was serving nearly 30 people out on the patio at once! It was the eve of the fête nationale, and luckily we weren't in a hurry. We got the cod mashed potato casserole, and the duck mac n cheese, both were delicious. Local beer, \"pale wh(ale),\" was good, as was the accompanying salad and a local Inuit tea. Carrot soup was deliciously flavorful and butternut squash cake for dessert was a treat! Espresso to finish off was just right (part of the \"table d'hôte,\" where you add an extra $10 for a soup, dessert and coffee to accompany your meal). About $60 CAD for two, before taxes, which we thought was a good match for the food and service. They also have WiFi, a cute upstairs with local art where the bathrooms are, and products like tea, coffee, and chocolate for sale. Not great for vegans, lots of dairy and meat/fish products..."}
{"text":"J'y suis venue 3 fois lors de mon arrêt de 2 jours à Tadoussac. C'est tout dire. Les produits québécois sont à l'honneur dans ce charmant petit café à la carte plutôt impressionnante, logé dans l'ancien magasin général!

Le premier souper, j'ai commandé l'assiette de produits du fumoir du terroir gaspésien (saumon, maquereau, crevettes et moules) accompagnés d'une excellente salade. Le goût de fumée était délicat et mettait vraiment en valeur les produits. Miam! Mon copain a pour sa part pris le trio de cannelloni de viande des bois (cerf, wapiti, daim). Également très délicieux.

Le lendemain midi, nous avons tous les deux pris un Croque-canard qui nous faisait envie depuis la veille. Canard du lac Brome, pommes et cheddar sur un divin pain brioché, le tout coiffé d'un peu de gelée de sapin (j'aurais aimé en avoir plus!). Miam, oh que miam. 

Nous sommes plus tard venus profiter du Wifi pour travailler au deuxième étage, dont la décoration et l'ambiance cozy me plaisait largement plus. Les espressos et allongés ne m'ont pas impressionnée plus que ça, mais le chocolat chaud aux épices boréales était vraiment très intéressant.

Gros thumbs up pour les produits canadiens mis à l'honneur. C'est fantastique de pouvoir ainsi partager notre terroir avec les touristes de passage à Tadou.

Ce qui m'a un peu déçue, par contre, a été le service. Il est vrai que nous étions en pleine saison touristique, mais quand même, les serveurs et serveuses ne venaient presque jamais nous voir. 

Mais bon, malgré tout, je recommande chaudement ce resto!"}
{"text":"Chaleureux, convivial, cet endroit charmant est un incontournable de Tadoussac. Ne le manquez pas"}
{"text":"Une bonne adresse à Tadoussac : les brunchs sont bien préparés, le cadre accueillant et bien tenu, la musique agréable. Un bel endroit, de caractère.
Des efforts sont faits pour bien tenir la qualité, à poursuivre pour éviter tout risque de compromis sur la fraicheur.
Les desserts sont bien agréables aussi."}
{"text":"This was one of our best meals and experiences on our trip in Quebec.  The service was warm and friendly.  The choices were excellent and very well priced.  My wife is veggie forward and I am veggie reserved and we were both very happy.  Good wine choices.  We came back for breakfast the next morning.  My wife thought it was the best latte she had in the week in Quebec."}
{"text":"Been three times and all were good experiences...good food, coffee and service; try the duck confit, it's worth it. Not cheap, but the place is hours from most food sources, so you have to pay for good quality in a relatively remote locale."}
{"text":"A gem! Lovely dinner in Tadoussac! Waitress was wonderful!!! Food delicious! Pizza with organic sausages is fresh and the Mac and cheese with lobster had chunks of lobster in every bite. Salads tasted fresh from the garden. Dessert was explosion of chocolate with caramel center. Yum."}
{"text":"Super restaurant ! Amazing dinner at this restaurant ! 
Fresh food, great service, we had a very nice moment over there ! I highly recommend you to stop at this cute restaurant while you visiting Tadoussac"}
{"text":"Great spot to people watch and authentic Québécois cuisine. Good beer and outdoor seating as an option. Lamb shanks well done. The seafood platter not very large but expertly done. Prices seemed reasonable."}
{"text":"We were in Tadoussac for 2 days and ate here 3 times.  There is a different menu for lunch and dinner with a great variety of choices.

Some favourites were calamari, macaroni and cheese and their pizzas.  Great choices for kids too."}
{"text":"A great coffee and food place . Ambiance is  fabulous. I went twice for lunch. French fries delicious. Seafood pizza to die for. Coffee is a must. I was not taking by the soup but left 5 stars since everything was extra and was probably my taste. I will stop again next year!"}
{"text":"I came here this past September when the family came to Tadoussac for a weekend excursion of whale-watching. We came here the night before for dinner and all of us were happy with our meals. I got the lobster mac'n cheese after reading the reviews here and it was delicious. The salad it came with was every bit as fresh and tasty. Other family members    opted for salmon which they also enjoyed. Service was really friendly too. Located inside a typical Quebec-style cottage, it's a great place for food and dessert and because Tadoussac is such a tiny picturesque village, everything is within walking distance so no matter where you're staying, you can easily stroll over to Cafe Boheme."}
{"text":"Nice cozy place with good food. A little bit pricy. We ordered smoke salmon which have 3 pieces of smoke salmon and one maple salmon on the plate, very tasty. A 4 smoke platter is very good but the portion is a little bit small for entre. Pizza is good ,above an average. 
In TA said they have the best choco cake which is not true. The chocolate lava is so so , not much melted lava inside. New York cheese  cake taste like lemon cheese cake . The chocolate moose cake is perfect , rich of chocolate. 
We order 1 smoke salmon , 2 smoke platter 1 pizza and 1 lobster macchesse. Plus 3 pieces of cake. No drinks. Total is 145$ which a little bit pricy for this style of restaurant."}
