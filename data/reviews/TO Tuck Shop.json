{"text":"This shop really filled a need in this neighbourhood. They carry a lot of snacks that are not available here and a huge assortment of candy for those candy enthusiasts.  The Jamaican patty & pizza is really good as well. The owners and staff are pretty friendly too. I just love the variety of food they carry."}
{"text":"The girl at the counter was utterly unfriendly. The atmosphere inside is not welcoming to seat (apparently they do not have a proper airconditioning, so you have industrial fan just in the middle of the shop, noisy and ugly)  ; sitting outside is an option, but 6 lanes of Lakeshore at 10 m distance is not fun. Espresso and cappuccino are below average. 
This is the closest place to my condo, but we found out that in 2 years we visited them only 3 times... and this for a reason.
I will go to this place for \"emergency\" only. Otherwise, the nearby alternatives are much better: Music Garden Cafe for the best atmosphere, Thor for superior cappuccino and Sobey's for grocery."}
{"text":"The T.O. Tuck shop really does address a dire need for that particular part of lakeshore living. Unfortunately there's no grocery store or snack shop anywhere in sight.  

As for the shop, I was pleasantly surprised with my first visit there.  The dude at the counter was super helpful and talkative with me about the shop and how it works.  A key points of interest is the delivery service.  You go to their website, place an order, and they will deliver anything from breakfast, groceries, smokes, and pharmaceuticals right to your door!  They'll even pick up your laundry and do it for you.  This place seems like a perfect lazy day service.  

Picked up a Brazilian coffee (7/10) and a Jamaican patty (8/10). I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"So I was back there again today. I noted there was Mr. Noodle on the bottom shelf.  So they do carry Mr. Noodle afterall.

I also found an equally good latte place in Kensington market on Baldwin street. I have yet to find the name."}
{"text":"It's a shame such a nice shop is marred by employee's who clearly don't want to be there. I've given this spot a few visits and each time am met with an employee who is dismissive and abrasive. I don't expect much from convenience store customer service, but this place is so unwelcoming it's worth avoiding."}
{"text":"Saved my life. The delivery service is so overdue for this neighbourhood. Pizza was great can't wait for patio season. Welcome Tuck 2"}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss. If you need anything, they don't stock it. Simple pantry items such as flour, sugar, ketchup, mustard, etc.  don't exist. However chili sauce and air fresheners a plenty. 

Pricing is out of this world too. Bought large bag of chips,  a small chocolate bar and a 500ml pop comes to over $10. Wow."}
{"text":"Decent little place in the bottom of a condo building but on a street corner on Lakeshore just east of Bathurst.

I've had the pulled pork sandwich which comes with a portuguese roll filled with a healthy amount of pulled pork and a small thing of coleslaw. I also had the jerk chicken sandwich, which I also enjoyed although the accompanying side of a quarter of a soggy dill pickle was less than impressive. The sandwiches are an even $10 (tax in) and leave me satisfied in in area of town with a complete lack of other lunch hour food options.

On the flip side, the pizza slices seem overpriced for their quality, and for all the random convenience store type items, only half of it has prices (with the other half being marked up quite significantly over expected value), but I guess they can get away with it given the locale."}
{"text":"Unsocialized staff and rat shit on all the shelves.  Good candy selection."}
{"text":"In a sea of condos a convenience store meets traiteur. It has everything you're looking for from water to fruit to snacks to made in front of you handcrafted sandwiches but everything is a tad too overpriced. But when you have nothing comparable nearby, you can't argue with prices. And they know it. Not friendly. But not bitchy either. Perfunctory is the word that best describes the service..."}
{"text":"Love this place. It's right near my friend's condo so we often stock here to get goodies.

It's basically a convenience store but 90% of the inventory is stoner time munchies - huge selection of candies (lots of US imported one), chips, chocolate, KD, ramen noodles, frozen junk food, soda, etc. 

They also make lattes and do really good in house pizzas. We tried a jerk chicken one which was great. They even deliver! 

They also have a gelato/ice cream counter. 

Staff are very hipsterish. Cool and unique store concept though and it definitely works for the area."}
{"text":"On a visit to Toronto, I discovered the TO Tuck Shop in the neighborhood. I'm not a sandwich person. I'm even less of a sandwich from a convenience store person. Well, that has changed. 

From the moment I spotted grilled onions on the counter, I sensed this place knew something about deliciousness. We ordered the pulled pork sandwich on toasted kaiser w/bbq sauce a la avery (see picture) and jerk chicken sandwich - both exceptionally tasty. The pulled pork is one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. Savory, toasted and served with crunchy cole slaw and sweet whole pickle. Thanks to a la Avery. ;-)

On a second store visit, we ordered the shaved prime rib sandwich with horse radish and au jus. Once again fully satiating. I can't wait to try the spicy chili lime sauce we bought from the store as well. TO Tuck Shop promotes delivery of store goods. They certainly deliver on taste and service as well!"}
{"text":"This T.O. Tuck Shop finally opened just before Christmas after more than a year of construction. As far as convenience stores go this is very good, nicely designed and very welcomed here as the Harbourfront neighborhood is definitely lacking in retail.
Best of all it is downstairs from my condo, how convenient is that!

They have a good selection of staples, snacks and household products. The prices are on the high side, but you are paying for convenience. They have a great coffee bar that serves hot food and when I was there one of the staff was baking cookies which made the store smell so good. They also have WiFi and an internet lounge.
They were playing some good tunes when I was there, so this should be a good place to have a coffee, hang out and work on your laptop."}
