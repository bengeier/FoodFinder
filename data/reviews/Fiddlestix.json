{"text":"Yummy in tummy..Breakfast 101 & 3 egg omelet: mushroom, pepper jack, spinach, tomato, avocado, bacon, green onions w/a side of papas and ciabatta toast."}
{"text":"I eat lunch here regularly and really enjoy the food and the fresh baked cookies.  I can't give more than 2 stars due to the rude women (Savannah, Sequoia and Andy) that routinely ignore  customers and their complete lack of customer service.  They act as if it is not their job to take and deliver orders.  On the other hand, Cameron is excellent, always attentive and smiling."}
{"text":"My partner and I had the ultimate combo flatbread pizza and two cookies for dessert.  The pizzas were delicious and the cookies were very tasty.  My only critique would be for the crust to be more crispy.  Place was very clean and the employees were very friendly."}
{"text":"We came in off the street with a party of 20 and were easily accommodated quickly. The staff was quick and friendly and the food was delicious. You can't do wrong with the boozy milkshakes!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! Steak was exceptional, made sure everything was perfect and seasoned very great. Would come back here for food. This place seems like a great spot for a group of friend to go to and have a good time in. Thank you."}
{"text":"This place is actually super good. One girl in particular was amazing to me. Jasmine is the best server here. Always a smile on her face. I definitely recommend seeing her. She's amazing"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time. Took over 25 minutes for a double cheeseburger and fries. Would have been faster to walk to McDonald's and back. Have waited 30 mins and haven't gotten my food yet."}
{"text":"Yummie!  My sister and I specifically went here for the unicorn grilled cheese sandwich.  Its conveniently tucked away inside the Gold Spike pretty close to the door.  The ladies behind the counter were nice and cheerful.  We were pleasantly surprised at how yummie the grilled cheese sandwiches were.  They use 4 different types of cheeses (not that gross american cheese).  We thought it was grilled to perfection.  We both got tater tots for our sides.. yum!  We went there thinking it was a one time thing.... but after glancing at the rest of the menu and our yummie experience i would go out of the way to return."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's right near work which is convenient but the food is really good. I have had the nachos and a couple of sandwiches. All really delicious. Keep coming back for lunch."}
{"text":"It was my husband and I's first time ordering from here and it was very good, we couldn't find anything to complain about. We ordered the Chicken Tenders & Potato Skins and they both tasted very fresh. The Potato Skins were definitely our favorite and the one thing we'd recommend if you were to ever eat here. The packaging was great as well. The food was nicely placed and not messy!"}
{"text":"Wow! All I can say is that this place was an unexpected diamond in the rough! A bit hard to find, hidden inside the casino, followed by being subjected to a full pat down by some characters who looked like they should be getting the weapons check themselves rather than giving it. The service extremely friendly however a bit slow.  Really that is the only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars, because honestly, the food was ON POINT!!!  My boyfriend got the chicken & waffles which were more savory with just a hint of sweet due to the sauce covering the dish which consisted of cheese, bacon, scallions and other delights.  I ordered the breakfast burger with shoestring fries.  Probably the best prepared shoestrings I've ever had. Then the burger, which can only be described as an absolute dream! The egg on top was cooked to perfection and the bacon and crispy onion straws was a perfect compliment to the delectable burger to the sourdough bun. I would definitely come here again and recommend that you all do too!"}
{"text":"The food was quite tasty, only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was the fact that they were short staffed. Other than staffing the experience was great."}
{"text":"Amazing food as always! The difference this time was the service! Cameron was exceptional, made sure everything was perfect, checked on me several times, very attentive to detail! You guys have a rockstar on your hands. Best experience I've had in a restaurant in a long time! Thank you"}
{"text":"So my daughter and her friends wanted to come here because of their unicorn grilled cheese. This place is in a ghetto casino with lazy ass employees! Mind you this place was empty! Dead!! It took 25min to get a damn grilled cheese!! Then it came burned! My daughter asked for a refund and  was told there's no manager here to give us one. After I go up to complain then all of a sudden there's a guy that appears acting like he can give a refund then says he doesn't have a mgr card, then goes to look for a mgr with one.....but supposedly there was no mgr here in the first place! Literally all the employees are chilling here! No wonder why this place is super empty! Then as we're waiting for a refund the security tries to tell us we need to leave because their closing. Ummm no! We getting that refund! Finally they give my daughter her refund....total it only took 40 min for nothing! Worse  place ever!"}
{"text":"i have had it with none of these delivery drivers not knowing how locate me and the worse part is i am right on lvblvd. its pathetic and i am to the point where i wont order food anymore. very disappointing."}
{"text":"A group of us were hanging out at Gold Spike for my sonny's 21st birthday.  We needed some food to soak up all the alcohol we had been drinking.  LOL!  Fiddlestix has great bar food to serve a crowd.  

We had the nachos, wings, & potato skins.  Now I know that we were tipsy, but it was really good food.  The chips were crispy and didn't get soggy from all the toppings.  The wings were spicy and rich and the potato skins were good too.  The staff was really awesome.  They were friendly and the cooks delivered great food.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I am new to Vegas and stumbled across the reviews for Fiddlestix without knowing what Gold Spike was. I arrived on a Sunday with a friend of mine and entered paradise. Oasis at the Goldspike is located in the back of this place, a childhood dream come true. There is so many games, tetherball, twister etc. It was like entering elementary school without being as insecure and awkward. 

Now to review Fiddlestix, it is a small fast place to grab something to eat while drinking at multiple places inside. They have burgers, grilled cheese (unicorn), tater tots, pastries, coffee etc. 

I purchased the unicorn grilled cheese with tater tots. It came out and I must say it was delicious but tasted a little sweet. I spoke with an employee and was informed they sprinkle sprinkles on top of it so it is salty and sweet. It was an instagram worthy picture/presentation. I will be back there to try more things. 

They did have complimentary tablets that were attached to the wall where you could check in on social media. The staff was friendly and even gave lighting advice for taking photos. The food was great for being in a bar area and quick service. I was impressed and will return to try other options including their alcohol infused milkshakes."}
{"text":"Walked around downtown vegas and found this new place, Thought we could check it out.
The restaurant was pretty hard to find.. We walked around 2 or 3 times and finally found it inside Gold Spike hotel.
We ordered the steak lovers breakfast skillet & the açai bowl.

The steaklovers breafast was very good. It was $12 with an egg, steak skillet and two pieces of bread - they also will ask you how you like your egg.

The Açai bowl was pretty good- they offer 4 toppings which is alot for $9.
I had the açai bowl with granola, mixed melons, strawberries, and crasins.

Overall this place is worth trying out if you are around downtown vegas.. It was about 5 min walk..
This restaurant is open 24/7 too !!"}
{"text":"Unicorn Grilled-Cheese: 
Mozzarella, Provolone, Swiss, and Muenster, sandwiched between crunchy, buttery toast, and infused with Unicorn DNA. Served with Kettle Chips."}
{"text":"Edit--I did come back when it was late and there was booze involved. The staff was super friendly at 3 a.m., so they earned the mean chick an extra star.

I only write reviews when I have really great or really off-putting experiences, and I had the latter here today for lunch. I have a feeling Fiddlestix is more geared toward the late night crowd when other sandwichy options are closed. The food is fine--in fact, it's yummy, but there's plenty of similar, also fine food downtown in the same price range at lunch time so I won't come back here unless it's late, and there's booze involved. 

The main offense was the only employee with whom I interacted. She was rude to the point of seeming pissed off that I had dared order food from her. My assumption is that maybe she was having a really bad day, or maybe I came off as unfriendly to her on accident and she was just returning the favor. Whatever it was, it was just really unpleasant."}
{"text":"BOOZY MILKSHAKES , we tried the peanut butter and the Kailua one and omg the peanut butter one was toooooooo dieeeee forrr.
Located in an absolutely adorable hotel, the staff was a treat, and the food was great! Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Stayed at Oasis when I was in Vegas and this restaurant was downstairs. It's conveniently open 24 hours. I was hesitant at first but after getting a recommendation from another guest, decided to try it. The pizza, tots, quinoa salad, and cookies were all fabulous. Some appetizers are even only $5 during happy hour. Hotel guests get a 20% discount on food. Everything was great."}
{"text":"Customer services is out of this world! Must go stop while visiting Las Vegas! If you come, you need to try the breakfast burrito! Best Item on the menu!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb good appetizers potato skins and buffalo wings on point, breakfast was awesome 
Will come back when I'm in town
Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Nachos are delicious!!! Lots of chicken, tomatoes, jalapeños, cheese, and really yummy beans.
Fun atmosphere, nice people, and yelp them for a freebie. The cashier was wayyyy adorable and so friendly. Good music, I'll be back from breakfast to try the Tasty Toast!!"}
{"text":"My favorite place on earth. Love everything about the gold spike !! Food is so good love there all you can eat salad bar!"}
{"text":"The food here was pretty good. It has a nice laid back environment. If you are staying at the hotel it's a nice place to grab a  quick cheap bite to eat.

It's located in Goldspike which turns into a club at night."}
{"text":"If you check in on Yelp, you get a free side of salad! When I ordered my Swiss mushroom burger, it came with a boat load of fried which was awesome. It was a pretty decent burger, especially for the price."}
{"text":"First time here, bought room through groupon... we were attended by Sequoia she was rude.. we asked where we ordered the compli.entary breakfast and she sent us to reception..  we asked the receptionist about the breakfast and he said it was only at fiddlesticks.
We went back and Sequoia ignored us, went to the kitchen instead of aknowledging us... she made faces at us for no reason.  Threw our plates at our table.
We went back the day after and she still had a bad attitude and made faces at us again.
The other girl was really nice tho."}
{"text":"I had the truffle fries and they were the effin bomb!!! My man and I couldn't not stop talking about them!! Yes! They where that good! Super buttery sauce! Cheese goodness velvety and the fries were still crisp not soggy at all! Best fries ever!!!! You will thank me!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast to start the day!  The potatoes are excellent. Bacon and sausage are cooked right,  not greasy. Eggs cooked as requested, would definitely eat here again! Nice staff as well."}
{"text":"Ordered through ubereats for work, it was my 1st time trying it out. The caprese flatwich was absolutely delicious!!! You can taste the basil and veggies were nice and fresh. The only thing i didn't like was the fries and tater tots. They were stale. But if you are vegetarian, this place has a nice selection for you. So that's always a plus on top of the convenient hours also. Thanks fiddlestix"}
{"text":"All of our food orders were wrong 3/14 8pm disappointed in the meals. The girl who took our order tried to tell the kitchen our order was missing avocado but instead of quickly fixing the order, they kept asking around if someone forgot it. I had to keep waiting for them to solve the mystery. Waited 5 mins then went back to the counter to finally retrieve it. Sandwich was cold. Kids meal not as stated on menu. Bleh"}
{"text":"The Service was fast and the food was soooo yummy!!! I highly recommend the 8 Man Milkshake as well!  Alcoholic Milkshake with fried Oreos on top! I also tried their burger with tater tots and nachos ! Everything was fresh and delicious ! I can't wait to try some of their other menu items."}
{"text":"Had a fun night last night! Invited out by a new friend to check out Oddfellows downtown. Got funky there for some dancing with grits and gravy their special funk themed weekly night. Worked up an appetite so walked over to the Gold Spike after to go to Fiddlestix inside as I've been hearing good things. Side note: the Gold Spike renovation/make over is one of my favorites ever downtown. So enter my late night snack the ultimate unicorn rainbow  grilled cheese sandwich. So incredibly fun & visually pleasing. Especially to see all that multi colored cheese stretch out and man is this cheesy! Will definitely come back to try more as they are 24 hours and the booze shakes look fun if I'm in mood."}
{"text":"The food here is low quality and tasteless.  It's a shame they are the only food option within Gold Spike.

The service is decent, but cannot make up for the bad food."}
{"text":"Loooved their steak and eggs. Everything was seasoned very great and I didn't have to add anything to it besides hot sauce of course. I work downtown and am always looking for new places to eat so this is definitely added to my list for when I want steak and eggs and I'll definitely be trying other items as well."}
{"text":"First of all I wasn't expecting too much other than a quick lunch but even with that I was very let down. Took 30 minutes to get food despite being the only customers there, they appeared to have at least three cooks who looked like they spent most of their time talking. The first dish was brought out way earlier than the second and was timed poorly. The unicorn grilled cheese is entirely too much for even a grilled cheese sandwich and might as well just be a pile of goo. The fish tacos are more like a fast food style fish taco (did not taste fresh). Not worth coming here. Would be better to go to a fast food joint."}
{"text":"Very good , burger was great the milkshake was awesomehard to figure out the entrance but with it when you do."}
{"text":"Connected to golden spike hotel and open 24/7 which is amazingly convenient. I'm a vegetarian and got the tater tots, flat bread pizza and milkshake it was pretty good. Food is greasy but what else do you expect 2 am when everyone's fucked up."}
{"text":"Located in downtown Las Vegas not far from Fremont Street is the Gold Spike, which contains Fiddlestix.  It's a Friday evening close to 6:30pm so it's not too busy.  They have a unique menu.  I went conservative and ordered the Shrimp & Chips.  The food was prepared crazy fast and out came golden fried shrimp with fries.  The food was good - would go again to try more if the menu.  

Parking was limited here, so we parked at the Freemont Street garage- they bill by the hour for parking."}
{"text":"Love this place! came with a couple friends and we all enjoyed the food. I was so surprised when FiddleStix came about when I was at GoldSpike! I most definitely would go back"}
{"text":"Food was fantastic! Amazing ultimate grilled cheese along with tots and tomato bisque soup for $10"}
{"text":"Service was fast and the food was soooo yummy!!! I highly recommend the 8 Man Milkshake as well!  Alcoholic Milkshake with fried Oreos on top!"}
{"text":"Can't comment on the food because security wanted to strip search me before I could get in the door. This establishment is apparently contiguous with a nightclub that is sufficiently concerned about its own clientele that they feel it necessary to pat down everyone who steps through the door. I was hungry but not so ravenous that I couldn't choose a restaurant that doesn't search me before I eat."}
{"text":"This place has a nice ambiance. It's inside Gold Spike so there are plenty of games and things to do. However the food is mediocre. I order the Shrimp Poor Boy and they coated the shrimp with Panko breading and it becomes really hard and it cuts the roof of your mouth. The Unicorn Grilled Cheese is way to sweet, and very unappetizing."}
{"text":"League of Legends is the main reason why I even considered coming here and ironically there were crows sitting in the trees outside lol

From the outside this place is almost invisible, if it wasn't for the back door which is labeled I would have completely missed this spot. You have to go in through the goldspike club then aimlessly wander to the back where you will stumble right into it.

As unimpressive as the outside and inside may seem... for whatever reason, their food is outstanding.. I had the 3 egg omelet (substitute the meat for other veggies) and i was surprised at how filling and delicious the meal turned out to be. It came with a side of potatoes which were very good as well as their French vanilla cappuccino.

The price sat on the higher side of things at over $11 for the omelet.. other than that this place wasn't a bad find at all."}
{"text":"It was one of my co-workers suggestion to check out this new place for her birthday and to be honest, it's not that bad, I feel like perhaps their still working out the details of a few of their dishes.

The nachos plate was a hit with everyone, the portions were perfect and it seemed to be the first dish to \"disappear\" before we even touched out own personal dishes.

Presentation to all the food was nice and appealing creating that anticipation to bite in!

Caprese flatwich: just right, not overwrought with too many topping leaving the bread to soft, here it rightly portioned and still had that crisp!

Fish tacos with Alaskan cod: The tacos were great, light and crispy battered cod filets topped with a nice slaw and cheery tomatoes. It was good but it could use perhaps a mild aioli with a maybe a slight kick. Just some feedback :)

Chicken and waffles: chicken was very good! The breeding was crisp and the chicken nice and juicy. Not to happy about the waffles. They seemed too flat and soft, when I cut into them, they actually came a part, perhaps \"crumbled\" may be a better word. 

Most of the dishes were served with a side of potato tots, like the Nacho, they were hit also!

I'm going to come back in a later time and give this place another chance. 

Lastly, I was able to try one of the milkshakes- super delicious!! Try The Dude, chocolate-y and yummy!

:)"}
{"text":"Came here specifically for the Unicorn Grilled Cheese, and it was well worth it. Also ordered chicken and waffles, they, unfortunately did not meet expectations. It was just okay. Had amazing service though! They put bacon when we asked for none and they were happy to remake the food as well as gave us two cookies to apologize for the inconvenience. The cookies were really good and I was super happy with the service"}
{"text":"Best French dip I have had in years It was seasoned in the Au jus, ,tons of flavor big portions, excellent au jus most restaurants have weak au jus just colored water not at this place it is worth going to downtown just to eat here"}
{"text":"1st time in this place. Rad! Next door to Gold Spike, thats really kool that I didn't have to go anywhere. Those Sunday mornings in Vegas, you know lol. Shrimp poor boy and portobello burger were amazing!"}
{"text":"After passing this place millions of times, I FINALLY checked it out. I wanted to try their famous unicorn grilled cheese. I came around 9 pm on a Wednesday night, and thankfully it wasn't crowded at all.

One thing that always draws my attention to this place is the bold and colorful decor. The floors remind me of those geode rocks - all sorts of swirly colors. They also have scrabble tiles on the wall spelling out food related words, and also funky fake animal heads sticking out of the wall. 

The service was quick and friendly. As for the unicorn grilled cheese, I definitely hyped it up in my head. It's good, but not the magical experience I was anticipating. The sprinkles also threw me off - I wasn't expecting them, and the sweetness clashed with the savory. That being said, I loved the rainbow cheese and I mostly came for the experience.

I definitely want to come back and try out some of the other menu items - especially their alcoholic milkshakes."}
{"text":"The muddslides are amazing and the customer service was excellent I loved the chicken wings and fries really good when you've had a couple drinks."}
{"text":"After getting our disgusting hotel room at gold spike, we decided to eat at fiddlestix. I don't know the name of the waitress but she was so rude. It was like we were a giant inconvenience to her. I ordered mild chicken fingers and heard the cook put them up and say they were hot. She said \"they were supposed to be mild\" and instead of correcting them, served them to me. I tried them and they were obviously hot. I asked her if they were the mild ones and she lied to me and said yes. Even if they were mild they still would've been gross. Maybe we just went at a bad time but the overall experience with the hotel and the restaurant was enough for us to pay a lot more to stay somewhere where the service, cleanliness, and hospitality was so much better."}
{"text":"I tried Fiddlestix a few weeks ago for dinner during an evening out at Gold Spike. I ordered several dishes, all of which were very good. The staff was super friendly and a great time was had by my whole party. But then...

I had an issue that needed to be resolved, so I called Fiddlestix on the telephone. For whatever reason, they are essentially unreachable. I have called approximately 25 times over the past five days trying to get in touch with someone who can help me since I live across the country and can't just run down the street to the restaurant. I have called so many times that I assumed they must have been closed until I recently checked their business hours... apparently they're open 24/7. ONCE out of 25 times my call was answered and they took down my number to call me back... no call yet. If you call the Gold Spike main line, three of the four different extensions redirect to the same line and after four rings (during which you have approximately a 1% chance of your call being answered), it cuts off your call. If you call the number on Yelp, it doesn't even ring, just sends you to a mailbox that has not yet been set up. I can't for the life of me figure out why I can't get in contact with Fiddlestix, but it is extremely frustrating and unfortunately the food was not good enough to risk dealing with this ridiculousness again."}
{"text":"I received a free coupon for breakfast and a coffee from my hotel for Fiddlestix. I got the breakfast bagel with ham and potatoes. The portions are HUGE! It could easily be split between two people. They have a wide variety of menu items including a unicorn grilled cheese. I'll definitely be back to try their boozy milkshakes (I know it's Vegas, but I don't need alcohol at 9am)!"}
{"text":"You should never judge a book by it's cover.

My wife saw a video on YouTube feature Fiddlestix's \"Unicorn Grilled Cheese\". We couldn't wait to have our daughters, ages 8 and 11 to try this item. The video advertised this as a \"Secret Menu Item.\"

So we arrived and our daughters immediately noticed the electronics on the wall and took to that. The restaurant looked very inviting to us.

 My wife and I were viewing the large menu on the wall. We saw the Unicorn Grilled Cheese advertised.  So much for being a hidden menu item.

She decided to try a Southwest Chicken Wrap, advertised as having avocado, the wife said she could hardly taste it. She also wished it had a little more spice to it's taste, that's what she expected from a Southwest Chicken Wrap.

I tried the \"3 Way Pig\". No complaints, except that it did taste a little burnt, possibly over cooked.

Both daughters tried the Unicorn Grilled Cheese. The older daughter didn't care for it. She says her bread and cheese were both burnt. But she did eat it all.

The younger daughter had the same complaints. She didn't like it from the first bite.  as he and her Mom traded half the Unicorn Grilled Cheese for half of the Southwest Chicken Wrap.

The floors at FIDDLESTIX had a neat design, but needed to be mopped. 

Service, my 3 Way Pig was served before anyone else's meal. Not good. At least bring out the kids meals first.

Not once did a staff member approach our table and ask how things were.

Sadly all four of us left disappointed.

I guess you could say, \"Ahh Fiddlestix\". 

I guess they lived up to their name."}
{"text":"Pretty fast service, great good, great out door space. Part if our complimentary breakfast for staying at Gold Spike Hotel"}
{"text":"I ordered a Cobb salad with steak it was amazing ,probably one of the best Cobb salad I've ever had.  It look like a work of art, even had a egg over easy on top of it which made the salad!"}
{"text":"Savannah rocks. This chick hooked it up. Good food. Solid vibe. Got the grilled cheese with turkey and avocado."}
{"text":"I was there this week promoting for Little Darlings and I must say that the staff was incredibly welcoming. Customer service was on point and the place is impeccable. This will be my go-to spot whenever I'm at Fremont."}
{"text":"A hidden gem!

Wow!  We were at the Mob Museum and needed lunch.  My husband looked on trusty Yelp and the Cafe Market across the street had terrible reviews. He kept looking and this place came up with great reviews. We walked five minutes in the rain to it. The location is a little confusing because there seems to be an entrance in a parking lot but you actually have to go around to the street side and enter the Gold Spike Hotel and Casino to get in. 

My kids has burgers and my husband and I split the chicken pesto panini.  When I asked about what kind of oil they used they girl behind the counter seemed a little clueless. My son has a life/threatening peanut allergy so it's a tad important.  She went into the back and found out vegetable oil so we were all set. 

The Burgers were huge, melt in your mouth monsters. And the fries uber crispy and tasty.  Our panini had great flavor and was big and juicy.  They also have one of those crazy soda machines that has a ton of variety. 

The atmosphere is a little weird.  I had my doubts going in.  The floor is cement. You order at the counter and they bring your food to the table. There's a salad and pastry display right up front to encourage you to be good and then bad in your choices. The seats aren't comfortable and don't encourage you to hang around. Service is okay... They forgot the panini and we went to the counter to get it. 

The music is great too! 

I completely recommend this place. If you're at the Mob Museum it's a don't miss for us now whenever we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Sholana and Cassandra, especially Cassandra made my early morning trek to get my daughter, husband and myself a meal we would all enjoy (regardless of the fact it was just 6:30AM!!) AMAZING! She put extra effort into making a simple pastrie into a dream come true fantasy. The bagel sandwich is amazing too!!!"}
{"text":"Hello all, My familey and i were in the restraunt attempting to enjoy food. We had to send a pizza back beacuse of too much grease for the kids. My Daughter and i over herd one ofbthe staff members say we were to picky when the pizza was remaid. 
  A homeless person sits inside of their restraunt can disrupt people and nothings done. The Homeless man then bothers other guests , besides my family and i while we are trying to enjou are meal.
   The manager of the restraunt then has security come to escort us out because we caused a scene in their Resturant. Very bad experience and i hope all see this and boycott the place at its entirely."}
{"text":"This place has the most rude staff and they always have an attitude when you ask them a question or for something. 
*** POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE ***
Even as a simple request for a cup of ice or ice water. You can't expect everyone to want alcohol or soda just because you sell it there. Not my fault you chose to work there and for Downtown Project."}
{"text":"I'm not really sure what to make of this place. I've been in a couple of times, and the service is always nice, the food isn't awful, but it's a funky vibe. Like, it's a restaurant, but not really. You can sit down, for sure, but I almost feel better about getting take out. Perhaps if one is staying at the Oasis it makes a little more sense; I'm usually just coming in from the neighborhood and the Gold Spike is empty in the mornings.

Anyway, I'm glad they're here because the breakfast burritos are big and tasty. The coffee is pretty decent, too. They offer some sort of boozy milkshake, which I haven't had but may be tempted by one of these days."}
{"text":"It's ok. The staff isn't really friendly or unfriendly. The fish tacos taste and look like they fried up some frozen fish sticks and tossed them between some tortillas. The burgers are pretty good. I'd come here more often since I live downtown but they don't really offer any reason for me to."}
{"text":"Employees are not doing their work very slow and don't seem to know what they are doing! They are eating on the clock! My order was a grilled cheese and it took more than half an hour! They food came out burnt and had no flavor! They told me they couldn't refund me my money because their was no manger in charge!"}
{"text":"A few friends and I are staying at the Oasis hotel (gold spike), and we're lucky enough to have Fiddlestix downstairs, open 24/7. Another guest told us everything they've had here is great so we finally tried 4 different items, all were delicious!! Great happy hour prices on a few apps and drinks. Oh and it's connected to the dance floor haha."}
{"text":"Pretty cool spot for breakfast and lunch in downtown Las Vegas. It's located within \"the playground for adults\" which is Goldspike. I'm pretty sure they also serve dinner, but we were here for brunch and the food quality was great. Servers were friendly and they had iPads on the walls for the kids as we waited. Try'em out!"}
{"text":"I liked it bc it was convenient. Try the chicken and waffles. The biscuit n gravy are homemade. Yum....

Fyi... order then sit at the tables...

I thought it was kinda pricey. $$$..."}
{"text":"This is located inside Gold Spike casino in the downtown area. When visiting Vegas I had to come here because they had RAINBOW grilled cheese. No that is not a typo. They have rainbow grilled cheese. It looked so pretty that I knew I would enjoy it, if not just to take the picture. We came in the middle of the day while visiting the down town area and decided to stop in while we were there. It wasn't crowded as it wasn't a prime time for lunch or dinner. The service was quick since we were the only ones there. The grilled cheese was very tasty as is most grilled cheese. If you want a yummy grilled cheese that will take a great Instagram worthy picture then this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service!! Brought my daughter here for the unicorn grilled cheese, she loved it."}
{"text":"Food was good when I stopped by. So much so that I tried to order for an event...really DENSE people on the phone. Ended up going elsewhere."}
{"text":"I agree with the odd door in the parking lot.  But the food was excellent service was great and easy parking for a downtown location.  Sooooo many interesting items on the menu it was heard to choose."}
{"text":"My wife and I stayed in Vegas for the night for a friend's wedding. We were at the Oasis at Gold Spike, a chic little hotel, and Fiddlestix was the attached restaurant. Honestly, we ate there three times and everything was tasty and reasonably priced. The pool at the hotel and Fiddlestix food (and open kitchen 24hrs) were part of why we decided to stay an extra night and make a mini vacation out of the trip. Very good time! Oh, good service too. \"Thanks Fiddlestix!\" ...I just like saying it....Fiddlestix."}
{"text":"ordered a breakfast burger. Good concept just very bland. For the Nachos though those were damn good and a good portion for what you pay. The fact that  I got a \"what do you want?\" While I was waiting to order was annoying. I've been in hospitality for 10 years, sorry but that's not how you talk to customers. 24/7 though I can dig it."}
{"text":"Super yummy food! Great for sobering up. Only downsides are the food takes a long time to come out and the restaurant closes sometimes when Gold Spike isn't really busy."}
{"text":"We have been here several times. Every time we come we are pleased with everything. The best burger we have had since moving to vegas! The pork sandwich which is huge...was packed full of flavor. We love that they serve tater tots and the adult milkshakes are exactly how they sound on the menu!!! Captain my captain is so good...we got one to share ...after one drink I made my fiance go get his own because I was not going to share... :)
Definitely a must do when downtown and if not...definitely worth the drive from where ever you are!"}
{"text":"Nachos and the dirty tots are my go to while at the gold spike. Place is never really busy and you can order from the bar."}
{"text":"Great place, great food, and great service. My server Cameron was kind and attentive. I would recommend for anyone to go here."}
{"text":"I've had the nachos, fish tacos, and BBQ tossed chicken strips at Fiddlestix. The nachos were the best thing I've had at Fiddlestix so far, with generous toppings, and pretty presentation. The fish tacos were what I would expect from a bar - kind of bland, with half-sliced cherry tomatoes which is strange, and flour tortillas that weren't the best. Batter on the fish was really crispy and good though. They hit the spot, but they're definitely not the best fish tacos in town. The BBQ tossed chicken strips were your typical chicken strips, so they were good. Tots and fries are great at Fiddlestix if you like them really crisp. 

Service is lacking. The two times I've gone so far, it's taken a few minutes to be acknowledged by anyone, even standing a few feet away from them at the counter. As a new restaurant, I think a lot more could be done to greet people and make them feel excited about this new place that's opened up. 

The setup is cool. There are still smaller tables if you want to eat with your own group, but there's also community seating with table games and iPads if you want to interact with strangers. I like the concept."}
{"text":"It's a fun atmosphere for a dinner inside a huge bar that offers lots of games and hangout area. You know, it's just food and snacks for drunk people. There's nothing special about this place, you don't go there to eat, you just need to eat something to absorb some alcohol so you can drag yourself home to bed. Milkshake is blahhh, they don't use real fruits and for the price it should be real and organic fruits."}
{"text":"A lot of food, so the price is about right. I wasn't thrilled with the quality - everything was just too greasy for my taste."}
{"text":"Located inside of the Gold Spike in Downtown Las Vegas, this new addition to the area is every drunk person's dream come true. After a night of indulgence at Gold Spike, we had to come in to see if they could satisfy our drunchies.
They have an array of items on their menu, but I has feeling some good ol' chicken tenders. The tenders were huge and it came with a side so I opted for the tater tots. Make sure if you are ordering take-out that you double check your order because when I got back to my hotel room they forgot my dipping sauces...fail. Other than that my food was definitely satisfying. The prices aren't too bad, so you definitely get a good portion for what you pay for. If you're in the area or inside of Gold Spike and need some greasy goodness then definitely check this spot out for those late night munchies."}
{"text":"Simple eatery in gold spike. Fresh, well seasoned food and good portions. You do have to come through the casino not from parking lot. 

Would return."}
