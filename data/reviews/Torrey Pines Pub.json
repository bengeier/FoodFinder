{"text":"First let me try to say something nice . . . um . . . hmm.  Well, the drinks are cheap.  We paid $6.50 for a vodka soda and a Heineken.    Now on to the bitching.    Do not eat here.  I am a fool.  No matter how appetizing bar food may seem at the moment, you don't want theirs.  I ate over 2 hours ago, and my stomach ache has yet to find an upper limit.  It just keeps getting worse.  Ugh.  Did you see that?  Before I could even finish this review, I just ran off to the bathroom and violently vomited.  I'm in hell right now.  I don't think it's food poisoning.  My boyfriend and I shared our turkey club sandwich and onion rings, and he's okay.  They probably just never clean out their fryer, or something  I mean, the food tasted alright (the first time around, not the second!), but I will never go back now.  Not even for a drink.  Oh, and the bartender was surly as hell.  Yes, dear we aren't regulars.  And with that attitude, you have assured that we never will be.  Do.  Not.  Want."}
{"text":"The Torrey Pines Pub is absolutely underrated! The staff here are like family! Dave, Jen, Bob, and Arnie well everyone here make you feel right at home.  Unless most bars out there, they make an effort to meet you and address you by name regardless of how busy they may be. Drinks are cheap! Good eats! AMAZING mozzarella stick hand breaded here and delicious philly cheesesteaks! Give this place a chance! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I met my good friend from Montana here. She was in town for a convention and she wanted to go to this bar....why I asked, what's special about it??? WELL, they cater to Grizzly fans!  University of Montana Grizzlies!  We met the owner who sat down and visited with us for at least 2 hours.  My friend knows him through her Uncle.  The place is older yes, smokey OH YES, but it's a bar so liquor and cigarettes go hand in hand.  The food was pretty good. I had chicken wings, my friend had a Philly cheese steak sandwich which looked delicious!!! Wishing I had chose that! Wings were good. though. Affordable food."}
{"text":"Happy hour nachos.....unreal. You can't finish em!! Suicide wing sauce, great pizza. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food, great bartenders and servers, and a clean environment that's well taken care of. I win so much here the owner and bartenders joke that Im either extremely lucky or somehow cheating. What more can you ask for from a neighborhood pub?!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite pubs in Las Vegas. The prices are extremely reasonable and the staff is one of the friendliest around. On my second visit to this establishment, the bartender greeted me by name and asked me if I wanted my regular... Holy Cow!!  I usually get the club sandwich, which is one of the best in Las Vegas and during happy hour the suicide wings, which are extremely delicious!  Strongly recommend this pub!"}
{"text":"Such a great bar.  Great bartenders and servers.  This place has great food too.    The gaming here is also fun and a lot of different contests going on all the time."}
{"text":"Girlfriend and I decided to give this pub a shot.  We drove right past it the first time, as there really is no sign.  We entered the restaurant side and were the only ones there.  The bar must be great, because that side was pretty full.  Our waiter was fast and the food was great.  I will go again when we're cruising this part of town again."}
{"text":"The food is great also employees in costumers all know each other so it was fun,and welcoming. HAPPY new year 2017"}
{"text":"I am from Montana and my husband and I LOVE to come here.  We eat there about once or twice a month - my hubby adores the Bob Philly Cheese steak, says it's the best he's ever had.  I order the sliders every time and they are the best.  The bartenders are amazing.  It's a great little bar to have a quick drink or sit for a few hours and watch the Griz play.  Awesome place!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for thanksgiving for about 10 years. I love this place. Great food, great cooks, great waiters and cool TV's in the restaurant. Plenty of parking and cheap drinks with \"old world\" bartenders. Make sure you lock your car doors though because the area is a little rough."}
{"text":"It was soo much fun here! my bofriend is a huge E-A-G-L-E-S! fan so he felt right at home. Having a lot in common with the ppl around us cheering the same team felt amazing! Even if your not an eagles fan the whole place makes you feel welcomed lol The manager was nice he introduced himself & was making his rounds checking on tables. I like that . Im pointing it out because we eat out alot and its not often that we see managers checking in on their guests.  Our server was very friendly as well I wish I could've remembered her name. We played squres lol even though we didnt win it was still fun. They have free raffles and a hand full of ppl win prizes!  All in all it was a great 1st time for us ...we definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"Went in the with my wife to just get a drink and was pleasantly surprised. The bartender was great, kept my drink full and even gave us a free drink each (after we bought a bit, hehe). Definitely will go there again."}
{"text":"Great people small town atmosphere can't wait watch steelers game with Jennifer! Met guy whose son lives where I used too in Pa small world!"}
{"text":"Great service no issues Dave and his staff are champions! Don't forget to try the pizza or the Reuben and Ruben pizza bon app√©tit."}
{"text":"Great bartender Dave and waitress Jessica. Good specials. Love the trivia! The french fries are crap and have a shelf life of 30 seconds. But everything else on the menu is yummy."}
{"text":"This is such a throwback to the bars I went to in my 20's (I'm 55). The bartender is awesome, funny and totally on top of his game. Ask for Dave; he's amazing. Jessica is an amazing waitress, made us feel so comfortable as soon as we walked in. If you like an old neighborhood bar, this is the one for you!"}
{"text":"$5 for a giant draft beer. Great service Great food.   Went in here while staying near by on a work trip. Definitely a local dive bar. A couple pool tables and a big TV in the corner. The rest of the setup is pretty standard a few tv's around the bar showing games and they have the game system that all the BWWs have for playing trivia and poker. (They also have video poker with running jackpots)  The giant draft beers are $5. Which is a pretty good deal. Food was really good I got the Bobby Steak which is a classic cheese steak with jalapenos. And the mozzarella sticks which caught my eye because they were almost $9 but when they bring them out you see why. Definitely for sharing.  Bartender was very friendly introduced himself and called me by my first name like I was a regular. Very good experience."}
{"text":"What a great place, friendly local bar. Excellent food and service. They have NTN trivia with lots of local players that are very good and like to help you play."}
{"text":"Great dive bar, with excellent bar food. Suicide wings are a must. Loose slots and quick beer."}
{"text":"What a great bar-  My friend Jesse told me about this bar so I decided to check it out.    We came here and got some great service from Arnie, Shay and Deanna.    We really enjoyed our drink selection and the food selection.  Great wings, beer and burgers."}
{"text":"Great local pub. The food is always good, try the wings and the club sandwich, beer is cold, and the bartenders are welcoming. You can't ask for much more than that!"}
{"text":"Pool tables, Great food, gambling 'You can Expect to win at the Torrey Pines Pub' :) :) :)"}
{"text":"Great Montana Grizzlies place. Got to watch a playoff game there and everyone in the place was a Griz fan. The food was great too. Well cooked and didn't take long. Service was also great, loved our server. Met tons of great people there and the atmosphere was second to none."}
{"text":"This is one of the best local bars in Vegas.  I love the service, food and beer selection.  The bartenders will know you by name and take great care of ya."}
{"text":"When I first moved to Vegas, I was worried I wouldn't find a great local bar. I am so happy to say I was wrong! My boyfriend and I LOVE Torrey Pines Pub!  First of all, the staff is awesome and very fun! They made sure we felt right at home and always strive to remember who we are (sadly because of work we don't get to make it in everyday ): but we would)!  They have great draft beer prices, selection of drinks, pool, free buzztime trivia and poker games, and yummy food!  If you're ever nearby, stop in! If I'm there, don't be a stranger, tell me hi!"}
{"text":"Comfort in every way; the food and drinks, games, staff, seating, and customers. Top shelf service. This establishment is always inclusive of non-gamers. You will leave with a smile and possibly new friends!"}
{"text":"Pretty annoyed. It's a die hard Eagles bar, but they shut off the Giants game literally 20 minutes before the end of the game (Eagles not on yet) to make us look at a blank screen. Prices weren't horrible. But coming from Brooksy's Bar and Grill, I was disappointed. Servers were super nice."}
{"text":"My mom and stepdad were the ones who introduced me to this gem and we continue to visit every time I am in Vegas.  I am originally from Montana and I went to school in Missoula, so it was really great to be in Griz bar.  The owner is incredibly nice and I talked to him for quite awhile about the Griz, Bobby Hauck, and Missoula the first time I was there.  I have never been disappointed with their food.  Their sliders are freakin phenomenal, their chili nachos are amazing, and according to my stepdad and boyfriend the Philly cheese-steak is the best one they've ever had.  Not to mention they also have my favorite Montana beer, Moose Drool. I will definitely continue to visit Torrey Pines every time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"I'm a huge Eagles fan and have been looking for an Eagles bar in the area. I ordered a pretzel and it was just ok. The South Phillie cheese steak was really good. The crowd seemed a bit too weird at first but the owner is very cool and made us feel right at home. Get there early to get a good seat for games. Smoking is allowed and that is a down side. Beers are good priced. It was a fun pub."}
{"text":"Best cheesesteaks I have found in Vegas.  I particularly love the Bobby.  If you hit a royal you will also get 50% off food for a couple months. Friendly staff all around, and they will put on whatever games you request."}
{"text":"Dingy and smokey, but a decent neighborhood watering hole. Typical Vegas style bar that's been around for decades.  Good pool tables and they host a few leagues there. Bartenders and bar staff are all cool and pour with a heavy hand. My friends's Makers and coke was 98% Makers with a splash of Coke for color!  A lot of regulars and friendly boisterous bunch at that. I've never eaten here but at least they have a separate dining area for the non smokers, like me, because this place is nicotine heaven."}
{"text":"The Philly cheese steak is very good I had to take some home. The bartender was funny he made me laugh when I didn't want to I would definitely recommend this place. And"}
{"text":"Warning this is an Eagles bar. Every TV will be on the Eagles game. They have NFL ticket but don't really use it, since every TV will be on the Eagles game. I requested 1 small TV which no one was facing to be changed to RedZone channel. Took a solid 20min to get it changed.   5/5 for drinks/food Drinks are really cheap and delicious! (Hennessy only $6!)  All the food we got was super solid as well!   I understand that it's an Eagles bar so that game should be dominant, but EVERY + the only SOUND is a bit excessive."}
{"text":"The BEST Philadelphia Eagles bar in town!!!! We are so lucky to live right around the corner from this gem of a neighborhood bar. We've come in here several different times of the day and week the crowd is always casual, respectful & the staff is always super sweet and on point. The food is pretty fantastic for bar grub especially their Philly cheese steak and the breakfast is always great!! Especially with a series of mimosas and or bloody Mary's! Regardless of what team your routing for TP pub is one of my favorites to watch football. And I love the free raffles during all the eagles games and not just cause I win all the time. Thanks for the fun TP Pub!!!"}
{"text":"The Suicide Wings and big, cold Pabst Blue Ribbon beer on tap will make your eyes roll back in your head!  Warning, they are addicting and you will find yourself sneaking there at all times during the day and night to fill this insatiable urge. You can get both in the bar or restaurant part of the pub.  The bartenders and waitresses are super friendly. Experience this ASAP!"}
{"text":"I am not kidding this place is perfect! Beer is cold, the bartenders are more than nice and the atmosphere is beautiful. Lots of tv's, great delicious food and two pool tables at 75 cents a game. The bartenders are seriously the friendliest people. I could not imagine a more perfect place. Lots of regulars come in and the bartenders greet them. A beautiful friendly atmosphere. Cheap beer and they have a great selection of draft beer as well. LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE! They just redid this place with brand new floors and tables. It's definitely a must stop bar in the area."}
{"text":"Well just your average pub but, the food was decent and I like that they have more than one type of frie there. The service was sooo slow though. I am unsure why they have such bad and lost help, they must be hiring friends and family because this town has a lot of unemployed people that can do a lot better."}
{"text":"Still enjoy the food here I'm just a little upset because they had a section for the restaurant and now they are taking that away for pool tables. So for the past 10 years we would bring our family here for food and now we can't. I'm a little sad that they are making this move but I will still come here when we don't have our kids if we feel like pub food.. service was very good. Food came out fairly fast buy changing my review due to the fact we can't bring our family anymore. I remember a time when we would come here after church for Sunday breakfast and the waiters knew us by name. The owner has new ideas and wish him the best. Sometimes change can be a good thing but I'm sticking to my 3 stars because I have a family and they can't come anymore and they ask on Sundays for breakfast from here. I take it Pool tables make more money. I'm no bar/pub owner so what do I know."}
{"text":"Bar motto is 'Expect to win!' and they're not joking. Hit more 4 of a kinds and Royals here in 6 months than combined in my entire life.  Great fish & chips, phenomenal sliders, especially with Thousand Island,  and the Reuben pizza is to die for (special, only available occasionally,  so get it when you can). Great bartenders."}
{"text":"My perspective is from die-hard N.Y. Giants fan and all around bar fan. This bar is only one of two bars in town that cater to 'NY Giants' fans. As you read this review, keep in mind that this was an early game but this is football season in Vegas and I have been to bars for early games and they were as busy as if it were Monday Night Football.  CONS: This place is not advertized to the general public as a NYGiants themed bar in the Las Vegas area. I found out about this place through a buddy of mine. The reason they can't advertise as being a Giants bar is because one of the criteria required by the Las Vegas Review Journal is that you cater only to the team support and not show any other game while your team is playing. But, they do, they have every game on TV and they display the Giants game on the big screen with sound. This in and of itslef is not that big of a deal because there is a decent amount of Giants fans in the place, but there are also plenty of fans of other teams too and that kind of takes away from the whole concept.  They raffle prizes at half-time but they are freebies they get from vendors and none Giants related.   The bartender wears a Philidelphia Eagles jersey every week.   Smoking is allowed and ventilation is definitely lacking.   PROS: Because its definitely a locals place, the price is right. The service is always excellent. The staff is welcoming. The customers are friendly and the place is set up pretty nicely. The menu is pretty good. When I go to an early game I have the stake and eggs with hashbrowns and choice of toast for $9. It's absolutely excellent!, Well cooked and delicious. The beer always cold and on point. I'd already had breakfast so I just had the potato chip fries. These chips are very good.   CONCLUSION: As a bar it gets four stars but I only go during football season to watch the Giants when their not already on TV so that's all I have to go by. I gave the place three stars instead of two as a 'Giants' bar because it is as close to a Giants bar as any other bar gets in this town and beggers can't be choosers. I'd give it four stars if they were a strickly Giants bar, and five if the bartender didn't wear an Eagles jersey. If you're a football fan you understand."}
{"text":"Great Pub!  I'm extremely glad that my friend invited me and a few of other friends to come and visit this gem!  The decor is \"old-wester-Vegas\" as this pub has been around for quite a few years living through the ups and downs of Vegas and the growth of its West side, where this pub is located.  The food was EXTREMELY affordable--we're talking $4.00 for a full platter! It is more of a diner fare with a few upgrades. The service is extremely quick, the drink selection is vast and also affordable. Bartender was very good and waitress made us feel at home. I loved their BLT sandwish on sour dough bread, and their take on \"quasadillas\" stuffed with a plethora of meats and vegetables. Their yummy fries come in different flavors and seasonings, my favorite being \"cajun.\"  This was a very good experience from start to finish. I could understand that even on a week night it was packed. Highly recommend this place!  P.S. The owner is extremely down to earth and friendly! This is a plus for anyone who is a Griz fan!"}
{"text":"What a cool, laid back bar this is. It's a Montana Grizzly bar which is a rare find here in Vegas. My cousins are from Missoula so they are huge Grizz fans.   The people here were very friendly, Rebecca behind the bar does an awesome job. I had a Philly cheesesteak from the restaurant and it was very good, very authentic style. The menu is typical bar food but looks to be well done.They have a nice big screen TV for game action, as well as TV's above the bar. Two brand new pool tables so you can get your pool game on here and get a true roll. Owner sounds like more improvements are coming up so this place will be pretty nice for a neighborhood bar, of which there just aren't many near my place.  I'll be back again and again. Great vibe, nice mix of people young and old."}
{"text":"bar/restaurant. pretty small with good service most of the time. basically typical bar food. not to bad...except when hair manages to find it's way into your hash browns. haven't been back their since."}
