{"text":"Best Pizza we've had in a long time!  We love Amadio's thick crust pizza and we normally go for thin crust everywhere else.  We tried all 3 crusts as a test and have stuck with their thick crust since.  Their dough is just so flavourful you have to try it.  It's crispy on the outside but light and fluffy inside.  The toppings are very fresh.  The rest of the menu is all good too.  It's just good solid food but the pizza, it's a winner.  We order Amadios once a week.  Our only complaint is they take Monday's off and a month in the summer.  We tend to find Sunday Monday as our 'want to order in' nights and in the summer who wants to cook?  As for the owner being a jerk, he's just busy because he makes such good pizza.  Who cares, the man's a genius you only have to try his pizza to know that."}
{"text":"My favourite Pizza joint as of 45 minutes ago. Delicious crust, fresh toppings, flavourful mozzarella. Not at all greasy. Soft & Chewy Garlic bread. Just too good."}
{"text":"Great pizza! The premium salami is soooo good! I also made a custom southern-style pizza (cheddar, sweet corn, bacon, garlic, grilled chicken) that I think should be a regular one of their pizza options and should be called \"The Kat\" lol"}
{"text":"Extensive list of fresh ingredients and my favourite crisp thin whole wheat crust puts Amadio's at the top of my list of favourite pizzerias. I'm lucky they are conveniently located since my family and I are frequent customers!"}
{"text":"For Review #200, let's talk about the only pizza place in Mississauga that exists through sheer force of will from the community.  The whole story of how Amadio's ended up where it did never sat right with me. A mainstay of the Port Credit area, they essentially got pushed out by a neighboring grocery store, which wanted to have their own pizza place. As we all know now, that replacement pizza joint crashed and burned like the Hindenburg once Pizza Nova rolled in.  Perhaps it was a blessing in disguise. Amadio's moved into a space that is a true hole in the wall - a small corporate plaza in the middle of a residential neighborhood, located right near a set of train tracks. Yet, their business hasn't slowed down at all. If anything, it might have become even busier.   Whenever I show up, there's a hive of activity around the front door. Joe (the owner) is usually inside slaving away and pizzas are constantly flying out the door. This place is more active than some pizza chains I've been to.  While the pizza might be a bit more expensive than normal (starting at $17 and up for medium-size signature pizzas) and it may take a bit longer to cook, this place more than makes up for it in quality. The dough is nice and crisp, never doughy, and the ingredients are always fresh. There's nothing particularly out there in terms of topping combinations (most of the signature pizzas are your standards like Hawaiian, deluxe, Canadian, meat lovers, etc.), but who cares? It's still delicious.  I kick myself sometimes because there's a local pizza chain just mere steps from where I live, and I don't get enough chances to visit. Buying a slice from Amadio's is always a nice treat, because it's almost always piping hot right out of the oven.  While I understand that there are some complaints about Joe's... brusque style, he's always meant well and goes above-and-beyond for the community. I can't count the number of times I've seen him doing pizza fundraisers at local schools or just being out-and-about helping with local events. Joe's the rare example of a local business owner who gives back as much as he can, and his style of pizza-making evokes very fond memories of great food and great times.  Make this one of your favored pizza destinations. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"This review is not about the food. The pizza there is very good. However the past few times we ordered it it was mushy when we got it.  This is about the customer service. The owner is the rudest jerk !! I checked the website and it said they were open until ten pm. I called at 9:50 and the attitude and straight rudeness from the owner was shocking.  I knew he wasn't at all sweet or friendly but Jeese this is a business your running. He has been rude a few times over the phone. But this took the cake. We order from there monthly. Never again.  If you want to stop delivering at 9:30. Say that. Don't be so ignorant.   He was so rude.  Your pizza isn't that good to have to be spoken to that way.  He said he was tired and didn't want to stay after ten. Uum okay. Great customer service there."}
{"text":"I am a complete pizza snob. It is still one of my favourite foods since childhood. I was the kid who ran to the principal's office with my two dollars in hand last minute to get my delicious slice of pepperoni pizza on Pizza Day. Remember Pizza Days? Sigh.  Amadios Pizza is more expensive on paper as soon as you check out their menu. But by god, it is the BEST pizza I've ever had while growing up in Mississauga. I love me some NYC pizza from Lombardi's, but since I can't get it regularly, Amadios is more than a perfect substitute!  Amadios is a family run business, and the owner's name is Joe. I've been a customer for many years now and he still recognizes me when I come in.  The quality of their ingredients is absolutely fantastic. Flavourful and fresh. The crust is chewy, crunchy, and has a satisfying yeasty flavour. The tomato sauce is zesty and fantastic.  Spend your money wisely and support local businesses! EAT AMADIOS PIZZA and I promise you will NOT be disappointed. EVER!"}
{"text":"My partner and I have been ordering pizza from here for a year now and they have yet to disappoint! Even though the owner can be a little crotchety, their crust and toppings are always FANTASTIC!"}
{"text":"Amadio's is definitely my favourite pizza place in Mississauga. If you haven't eaten here definitely give it a shot. The pizza is definitely some of the highest quality pizza I have had, all their ingredients seem very fresh, more so than I expect on pizza. We usually get their bacon & cheese pizza. It's as amazing as it sounds. The pizza is fairly thin crust, an average amount of cheese and a bit greasy (which I love). I can't say enough good things about this place though and I feel as if most people haven't found this hidden gem. I would hands down, recommend anyone who enjoys a good pizza to at least try out this place, I guarantee you'll be going back! There are very few pizzas I have enjoyed more, and definitely none in the area."}
{"text":"One of the best pizza places in Mississauga by far. Their ingredients are always fresh and the pizza isn't greasy like other pizza places. You have to give them a try."}
{"text":"I have yet to find my favourite pizza joint in Toronto. Didn't even realize this place existed until I did a quick search on Yelp since it's a little hidden away in a strange area of Port Credit. Half residential, half industrial. I had ordered take-out, simple pepperoni and cheese. Not bad, the crust was a little light and water based but nonetheless, tasty. My first impressions when walking in is that is seems quite busy. No less than half a dozen young students working in the back in an assembly line style prep. Greeted by the gentlemen behind the counter but I wouldn't say that he took customer service to the next level. Could be a little friendlier.  My search for the best pizza continues..."}
{"text":"Since moving to Canada, we have mourned the loss of our beloved favourite NY style pizza joint. We've searched throughout Oakville and Burlington. I've had a couple of the best pizzas in Hamilton as well, and they are good in their own rites, but just not quite the NY thin crust classic with fresh ingredients. We expanded our search to Mississauga, and at Amadio's, we have finally found the answer to our pizza prayers.   Perfect thin crust, fresh ingredients, good quality cheese. Crust is crispy on the outside, and the sauce is flavourful.   In addition, it is a local, family-owned business, and they were very friendly. It's delivery and take-out only. Coming from Oakville, we're outside the delivery radius, but they actually gave us a pizza bag to keep the pizza warm on the drive home, which is awesome!   If you haven't tried it yet, do! That's all there is to it."}
{"text":"My parents and I order from here when we want a pizza.  They do have delivery but we prefer picking it up and saving ourselves the delivery charge.  We haven't gone there enough to be considered a local yet, but to the people that visit regularly, the guy behind the counter knows them by name, knows their orders, everything! It's a great family own business with great quality ingredients.  My pizza was thin crust, and I had a choice of whole wheat or white dough.  Slightly expensive, but they do have specials throughout the week."}
{"text":"First time ordering from them using there online system    took about 1hour 10mins to get a pizza 5 blocks away from the store     Quite expensive.    not the best pizza    but Not the worst we've had.    Just not our fancy"}
{"text":"We enjoyed our Meat Lover's Pizza. The delivery guy was friendly. It took a little longer than expected for delivery, but the pizza was still piping hot when we got it, so I assume it was pretty fresh. I love how they use bacon pieces instead of bacon bits. I would definitely eat here again but may pick it up if I'm in a hurry."}
