{"text":"My favorite place to order to go when I want something quick and healthy and at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"We have always enjoyed this restaurant - the food is very good.  Tonight however, the customer service fell below my expectations.  I brought home some chicken strips home for my son (in their styrofoam takeout containers) and the chicken strips melted through the styrofoam because the cooks put them in there when they were still too hot.  He had eaten about 1/2 of the meal before he had noticed the holes at the bottom of the container.  We were extremely concerned of the chemicals from the stryofoam that our son may have just injested and told him to stop eating immediately.  When i brought the container and remaining food back to the restaurant i expected either a refund or an alternative option to the food we were returning (since the thought of eating styrofoam had blown his appetite for that particular dish).  Restaurant policy is replacement of the same exact dish, regardless of cost.  I expected a more customer friendly policy."}
{"text":"The menu in the store is nothing like the one online, standard fast food Greek fare, nothing special. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"They get one star because they, in fact, serve food. The customer service is atrocious. The \"cheeseburger\" had no cheese but \"you can pay extra for it\". If you ask to substitute a side, they offer the substitutions but fail to say that it will cost you $4 extra. They could only provide plastic ware because all of the flatware was dirty. Hmmm, this somewhere you want to eat? I think not."}
{"text":"I wish this restaurant was closer to me!  I have been going there for over 12 years and I love it all the time!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch a couple of months ago. The service was not very impressive,  tables were wobbling and diner looks outdated. I wasn't impress with the food either, very bland! Somehow it took me over 30 minutes to get my food."}
{"text":"I love this place. My family has been eating here for years and I really make an effort to get in when I'm back in town.  This is an order at the counter type of place so it's not fancy but the food is fast and good.  I've looked around wherever I've lived for a greek place I like as well, but so far have been unsuccessful.  

I mostly get the gyro platter which is great.  It comes with greek salad and those wide yellowish french fries that seem to be common to greek places.  I'm not a fan of the fries myself so I always order it with no fries and extra salad.  It only comes with half a pita bread though, so If you like to put the meat and salad together in the pita to eat (like I do) I suggest you invest less than a buck in an extra order of pita bread.

We also like the stuffed grape leaves if you are in the mood for an appetizer, but the gyro platter is usually big enough without anything else."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed. I placed an order and it was not correct when given to me. The fries were cold and my gyro was not as I requested. I requested a refund and was told no refunds. I just read another review who had a similar complaint and the same issue. I have ate here before but never will again. I was told to call Mike Sadri after 2pm to speak with him. I am beyond pissed. I will definitely be giving him a call."}
{"text":"One of the places I have to visit whenever I'm in town. Food is exactly what I expect every time. Service was excellent today. All of the servers passed by several times and checked in each time, returning quickly with anything we needed. Location is looking a bit tired, but that's my only complaint."}
{"text":"Delicious Hidden Gem.
Husband and I took a chance on this place a couple months ago and so glad we did:
FOOD:
Freshly made. Highly recommend the gyros.
This restaurant has a big variety of options - everything from chili to salmon kabobs to baklava. While this may seem unfocused to some, we found the options delicious.

Parking:
It is located in a very busy shopping center and the parking can be challenging.

Atmosphere:
It's a diner/hole in the wall atmosphere - tables are very close together but it's cozy. Local hint: There is a small lake behind the restaurant - highly recommend getting the food to go and enjoying it outside with a water view."}
{"text":"where to begin...the food was so authentically Greek i almost lost my appetite BUT the spanakopita was out. of. this. world. so crispy. so fresh. so delicious, and ever so slightly salty with a bit of spinach (go iron!). the fries were a bit too hot, but after much blowing, from both me and my child, they were cool enough to bite. the star of the meal was by far the tzatziki sauce - thick, white, and perfectly spiced - my baby even drank it! and used a pita as a spoon! all those wonderful things aside (except for salad because i don't eat salad) the low stance of this rating stems from the judgmental, rude, hurtful stares from the customers when i walked inside with my baby. i was banished to attempt to enjoy my meal outside while the other customers mingled indoors. my baby may have to learn to drink tzatziki sauce elsewhere but as for me, ill be back. never be afraid to go greek! #gogreekorgohome"}
{"text":"The food is consistently delicious. The staff is young so somewhat distracted but nice. Usually there are more employees than customers and they (employees) are usually eating at the counter. Not sure if on their break or off and hanging out or ? I would suggest designating a place in the far back of the restaurant for them to dine."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Greek food.  I ordered a greek gyros platter which consisted of greek salad and gyros and I had them leave out the pita bread and fries.  The gyros was a processed, almost spam like tasting gyros.  It was nothing compared to the kind and quality of gyros you would get at other Greek Restaurants in town.  It had a rubbery, processed reddish tint to it and the low grade processed taste I would never had paid nearly 8.00 for if I knew what it was.  I left almost the entire platter.  Never again."}
{"text":"Used to be a great little joint for a quick salad and bowl of soup. But the past few months the service has become a real problem. Too many teenagers, not enough adults."}
{"text":"Food is good, service and cleanliness need major improvement. Teen staff mostly ate and was clueless to the customer,
Moire mature servers, steam clean the place, would be a great experience."}
{"text":"We have been coming here off and on ever since this place opened.  We have seen a high turn over in servers over the more recent years and today I understand why. We ordered 2 diet cokes with our meal in to go cups.  We stood at the counter and watched the girl fill our drinks as we thought we would save her the trouble of bringing them to the table.  She filled up the first to go cup with regular coke and put a lemon in it (which, I think, usually goes into a diet coke). So we thought maybe this isn't our order.  We watched as she filled the second to go cup with regular coke and again put a lemon in it. Hummm, surely this must not be our order.  
She turned around, we told her we were waiting for 2 diet cokes, and even asked, Are those diet cokes? and she starts to hand them to us.  I told her, we just watched you fill them with regular coke.  She just smiled, never said I'm sorry...or... oh I made a mistake...or... isn't that a funny joke to switch regular coke and diet coke, nothing.  She emptied them out and filled them with diet coke as we watched her.  After we sat down, another waitress came over and was very apologetic but with servers like the one who thinks it's funny to fill orders with coke when diet coke was ordered, we probably will not go back. Good thing I am not a diabetic."}
{"text":"Try offering a gyro sandwich with a side Greek salad and not make the customer order two entrees. Some of us like a little healthier option for lunch and don't want fries and a coke with our sandwich. Gyro, fries and drink = $7.95. Gyro and side salad = $13.95."}
{"text":"I officially love this little restaurant.  I've seen it around in my travels and finally decided to go try it, and I'm sure glad I did.  The inside is painted to look like a Greek villa complete with a great view of the beach, which I thought was cute.  

As far as the food goes, I was ready to mark them down a bit for having slow service but then the food finally arrived and all bad thoughts were banished.  My chicken suvlaki kabobs were cooked perfectly and served with fresh, hot pita bread, and Greek dipping sauce.  This restored my faith in them because even though the place was nearly full and they were understaffed (I saw a help wanted sign in the window) they took the time to make sure every dish was done well.  

They also have some American fair, like hamburgers and such for those afraid of international cuisine."}
{"text":"Fantastic lunch served super fast by a friendly staff in a clean dining room, perfect!
Oh yeah, not expensive either. Had the #6 ...Marinated Chicken over rice and added a side order of hummus. All were delicious. The manager \"Lupe\" came out of the kitchen and asked everyone if everything was good, and grabbed me a refill of my tea, a nice touch these days. 
Take your friends and family, we need to keep this place around because they care about their customers."}
{"text":"Service is absolutely terrible. It's a bunch of teenage girls with the biggest attitudes. The place is so nasty and looks as if it's never been cleaned. There is never a manager, so when you have an issue it is never taken care of. This place is an absolute joke...."}
{"text":"I've been going to Akropolis since it was put into the Arboretum.  

The atmosphere has never been much to write home about.  They close a week or two out of the year to usually clean/repaint the place but it always meets south of expectation.  The tables are loud, the chairs they use heavy as anything and louder still.  The service is usually wage (or sub) high school students and you know how that can go.  That's not what it's about though.. it is the food right?

I think they have the best gyro meat in town.  While it's not like leaving the country and having lamb/steak on a spit it is served fresh and well spiced.  Others in town that you get gyros from will serve you some Cisco food service derivative which is freaky.  Their Chicken and kabobs are also juicy and never dry.

You could rank a lot of complaints on this place if you weren't careful but I've been to them long enough and a repeat customer for probably 15+ years and they continually draw me back a few times a month."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite Greek restaurant, but it has gone downhill so much in the past few years that I probably won't go again.  Everything appears dirty and greasy -- from the nasty floors to the wobbly tables with very old plastic table covers. The service stinks, the bathrooms stink, and the place just looks gross. The food is okay -- not as good as it used to be."}
{"text":"Usually go in there for the Gyro Combo - with fries and a drink it runs $7.50. Great flavor, just the right amount of Tzatiki and the fries are fresh and crisp!"}
{"text":"This place deserves more then a 2.5 star rating. I ordered the #13. Souvlaki chicken kabob platter. I loved the salad dressing. Reminded me of the dressing my mom use the make. Just the right herbs with oil and vinegar.  Fries were cooked to perfection. The chicken kabob was cooked perfect and the taziki sauce I could drink. Staff was kind and attentive. Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"Usually I am really happy with my meals here when David and I are in the mood for a quick casual bite on a Sunday night.  However, last night things were just a bit off.. the salad wasn't as fresh as normal and was doused with wayyy too much vinegarette.  The chicken soulvaki was cooked ok, but the tzatziki sauce didn't seem to be on pointe - couldn't quite put my finger on it.

The only other issue is that the piece of Baklava that David & I split was really hard.
  :-(  

Hopefully, things will be back up to par on our next visit."}
{"text":"Akropolis has a diner feel about it.  They had a bbq sandwich special.  They have some traditional greek items souvlaki, falafel  and the obligatory  hot dog and  burgers.  Somewhere you can spend $6 and get a sandwich.  There were a lot of employees in there.  I think I saw 6 employees and the owner.  

I ordered the falafel, it was a bit overcooked simply topped with onion, lettuce and tomato, served with tahini, of course I wanted some tzatziki.  I have had better but all in all, it won me over.  They serve large cut steak fries, they looked delish!    It took a lot of will power not to add an order.  They were very pleasant, food came out hot.  It didn't set the world on fire but there is something appealing about the cafe."}
{"text":"I have tried Akropolis three times now over the last seven years with the hope that it has gotten better.  Third time is a charm and no more for me., sadly given the potential for this special nook.  

Each time the service has been horrendous.  In fact, rude.  I was actually checking out and the individual ringing me up was on her phone while asking for my money.  For real?  #sad"}
{"text":"I'm a little surprised by all the negative reviews. I've been coming here since I was a kid so there may be a little bit of nostalgia coloring my view but the food here really is quite good for the price.

This is fast food type Greek so it's definitely not fancy but it's reasonably priced and tasty. Anything with chicken in it is a good bet here. It's tender and very flavorful as a result of being marinated in Greek spices. Akropolis also has some of the best Greek dressing I've ever had. I pretty much put it in everything. It's excellent on the French fries and on the Greek rice in addition to the salad. I'm a big fan of their spanakopita because it's served in very small little triangles and has the perfect filling to dough ratio. I'm not a fan of big slices of spanikopita because there's too much spinach and too little crunch from the phyllo dough.

I'll readily admit Akropolis doesn't have the best service. The staff here is always made up of really young high school kids and a lot of them fool around behind the counter instead of getting the food out promptly. This can be kind of annoying but realistically, you usually can't expect excellent customer service at a quick service restaurant and since I'm never paying a lot here, I can deal with a few instances of fifteen year olds slacking off. 

This may not be a must visit spot in Charlotte but it's a great spot to stop for a quick, casual meal while shopping at the Arboretum."}
{"text":"Some of the best gyro I've had in Charlotte. They are BUSY at lunch time and food can take a while, but it's always been worth the wait. I have never had stale pita, which I have ended up with just about everywhere else I've eaten gyro frequently. I love the platter with salad and fries as well!"}
{"text":"This place isn't going to be the NYC gyro, but it's decent and well-priced. Depending on who the cooks are that day, the food may have more or less flavor. The owner is a good guy, but isn't there nearly as often as he used to be. The staff are mostly local teens (girls). Most of them are quite nice. If the line is long, just know you will need to be patient as the staff is young and isn't as focused on customer service as adults would be. 
All in all, this is a place I get a craving for every month or two. Service is what it is, but a side of gyro meat, pita, and tzatziki hits the spot!! Be aware -- you can ask for crispier pita at the counter or when you call in your order :) 
Happy eating!!"}
{"text":"This is probably the second time that I've visited this year. Good food but slow service and nobody asks you if everything is okay with your meal or if you need refills."}
{"text":"This wasn't really greek food - it was more like fast food in a greek form factor.  It was not authentic at all.  Service was okay - yes it was high school kids but they were pretty great with the free refills.  If you are craving greek food this might not hit the spot."}
{"text":"We missed lunch and stopped ther for just a bite around 2 pm. There was just a few costumers but we were standing at the counter waiting to order for over 10 minutes while a waitress was talking to someone eating at the counter and ignoring us the whole time. I glared at her until she got uncomfortable, said her shift was over and left the restaurant. 

The girl she was talking to turned to be an employee, she finally got up, apologized and took our order.  We sat down and when our order came this other server didn't bring any settings, we actually had to call her back for it. She thought that was funny. I got the impression they only hire high school girls.

The spanakopita appetizer was actually quite tasty but the portion was way too small, 4 bite sized pies Hey spinach pie is not a luxury item! The grape leafs were run of the mill. No lamb gyro or kabab? Only beef and chicken, I have no use for a beef Gyro. The funny thing is that at the Charlotte cafe right next door they serve lamb Gyro and they don't even claim to be a Greek eatery. 

Not convinced"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Run by a family that thinks all customers out to cheat them or something. Placed a Togo order and they said 10 minutes. I go there and only when I paid did they put the order in and I had to wait after for another 10 -15 mins. Just dumb. Food is all right. Go to plantation market and kebab hot instead."}
{"text":"I usually try extremely hard not to give mediocre to bad reviews but the food was just not good.  My expectations weren't super high I don't think but then when I tasted the gyro I was disappointed.  I thought that a gyro would be a safe choice considering it is a Greek restaurant but no the meat was not at all tasty.  The tzatziki sauce left much to be desired and I was just disappointed.  The staff was super friendly consisting of mostly young people and the restaurant was pretty well maintained, price points are low... But with good reason.  It's not great. I come from NYC, land of the cheap and quick gyro served up from a food cart or full service restaurant sometimes guaranteed to give you heart burn and this fell short of that even.  I'm afraid I won't be back."}
{"text":"Great food! Atmosphere needs help. Employees gathered in the middle eating both behind the counter and seated. Not paying attention to customers. Place needs better management and a facelift."}
{"text":"The one star represents the restaurant's lack of effort on customer satisfaction. If you make a to go order at this restaurant, make sure it is exactly right before leaving. They will not try to make their screw up \"right\" on your next visit. The food may be good, but customer satisfaction should go hand in hand! If you want good Greek and good customer satisfaction, go to showmars.!"}
{"text":"It's unfortunate that I can't speak to someone after two attempts (via phone and in person) when I get home with a wrong to go order.   Bad customer service will run me away.  Too bad since we eat here about 4 times a month. .."}
{"text":"Today was a great experience at Akropolis. I have been here when either the food or the service was not that great. They seem to have stepped up their game. I got the filet kebab and it was great. The gyro platter was good as well. They have a great, fresh, light salad with feta and olives. The fries are crispy and fresh. I was hungry when I got here and was hoping it would be a good day for them. It was."}
{"text":"The spinach pie is yummy, and the french fries are good. It's a standard Greek restaurant, and the food will hit the spot if you have a hankering for Greek. The service leaves a lot to be desired. It's slow, and the high-school age staff are often a little fussy about being interrupted from whatever it is they were doing to have to work. 

One of the waittresses flirted openly with my date in a way I found pretty yucky...it was a bizarre combination of indifference to providing timely, quality customer service while fawning over my man...Boo to her.

If you've got time to wait, though, and you're not with a dashingly handsome man, and you're willing to suffer through some sloppy service to get to the promised land of souvlaki and spanokopita, Akropolis is a good option. It's pretty affordable as well, so it's a nice option to the Taco Bell across the parking lot in the Arboretum."}
{"text":"Akrapolis Arboretum-Poorly managed, poorly run Greek restaurant. Manager is rude and does not hesitate to berate customers for mistakes that the restaurant makes. Mistakes on orders are frequent and the food is at best mediocre."}
{"text":"Alas I found a location that serves simply good, inexpensive Greek food. The grilled chicken is great. The pork kabobs are delicious as well. Their house made dressing is fantastic. Service is a so so. You order and pay for your meal at the counter and they bring it to you but friendly."}
{"text":"I was doing some window-shopping and my stomach reached up and punched me in the face.  I fell into a Greek restaurant which I could deal with because I love falafel.  The noticed that the café was loaded with teenie-bobber couples, probably from the high school across the street.  Oh well, I spotted a few quiet places available for me to enjoy my meal.  

The cashier seemed unenthusiastic and her she wore her hat so low that it looked like she was trying to hide something.  I ordered the falafel with a side of fries.  

The food popped up within ten minutes and the place was crowded!  I enjoyed my waitress, she had a sweet personality and quick on the refills.  The unsalted French fries were huge and steamy and the Falafel was hot and crunchy.  I do have a suspicion that the fafalel was frozen and recooked, but good nonetheless.  They played Smashing Pumpkins, Honey, and I thought for a minute about dessert, but I had to run.  Baklava next time!"}
{"text":"I feel like this place has gotten a bum rap. My food--a chicken souvlaki appetizer and a grape leaf appetizer got to me quickly. It was fresh and good. The menu was overwhelming though! I could not figure out what to get without having to get French fries. I ended up getting the two appetizers."}
{"text":"This place must be alright cause I keep coming back and have been doing so for years. So why only 3 stars? Well, the service is hit or miss. And you have to stand in line and place your order, just like  you would at say McDonalds. After your order is placed then the vibe switches to a wait staff environment where they bring food to your table when your order is ready (and tipping is expected - as the note at the cash register reminds you). I always find those set ups annoying."}
{"text":"Skip this place.  Totally disorganized.  I had a gyro, meat was dry, taziki sauce flavorless.  The frys were inedible, cooked in old oil.  They have a lot of people working there, most of them just standing around and yet they cannot figure out gets which order.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Voted Best in Charlotte 17 years ago, this was probably the last time any pride was given to this establishment. To start, the decor and food is very outdated and bland. The worst part, however, is the service. Untrained, preoccupied high school kids running the entire front of house operation, wow!

Hot tip: Don't sit at the bar, it is also used as the bussing station."}
{"text":"Busy place. Menu has a Mish mash of things, from gyros to lasagne. I had the gyro platter and DH had the gyro and pork kabob platter. First off, the gyro meat reminds me of meatloaf in texture and it was very salty. They put some kind of gravy on it. The Greek salad was good. Fries...well, they're fries. Signs everywhere saying, \"We work for tips.\" However, aside from bringing the food to the table they really don't do much to earn a tip. In addition, we paid with a card and there wasn't a line for a tip anyway. Overall, tried it once. Will not go again."}
{"text":"So where do I start. Let's just say I would never eat here again mind you this was my first time. Hands down the worst dinning experience of my life. My friend ordered a Greek salad and as she's eating she found a worm moving around in her food she then got up and went to the bathroom to vomit. As my friend was dying in the bathroom I then called over a staff member to make her aware that a worm was in the salad. The young lady had no remorse or sympathy to the fact that we had a live insect in the food. She looked at me rolled her eyes and said \"what will you like us to do?\"  I asked to speak to a manger she then proceeded to tell me that there wasnt  a manger there. A more decent place would have apologized. But no instead we still had to pay for the Greek salad with a side of worms. This place is a dump and should not even be in business. We don't want restaurants like this in our area!!!!! Keep you nasty attitude and salads away. P.S Any decent restaurant should have a manager in duty to make sure the guest are recovering a proper dining experience."}
{"text":"We go here for the falafel sandwich. It's consistently good and a pairing of fries with hot sauce always does the trick. Ask for extra tahini and enjoy."}
{"text":"This place tears me in two, while I love the cheap Greek food their service truly is bad. It really is something else to experience, just disorganized and mismanaged. They need to have one of those restaurant intervention people to do an episode here, because the place could so easily be better. Again I love their Greek salad, humus and Gyro platter so as I said, the place is what it is. So if you go in with the proper expectations, you'll walk away happy."}
{"text":"Great falafel at a super low-key restaurant. I was not a fan of the falafel sandwhich, because it was wrapped in a thick pita and I am used to a traditional middle eastern thin pita, but the actual falafel ball itself was tasty. And the food arrived piping hot which is lovely. 

Definitely worth visiting for a casual lunch."}
{"text":"As someone who listens to Vampire Weekend, I crave falafel and let me tell you this place is delicious. I got the falafel sandwich and it by far exceeded expectations. The place in general might seem a bit dated (they won some award for being the best at something in 1998) but if you are hungry for mediterranean food and you are in the area Akropolis will hit the spot."}
{"text":"I truly enjoy the food at the Akrop; it's the main thing that keeps me coming back. In the past, I have had an expired coupon denied. Just today, a lady working the counter already assumed my coupon was expired before even looking. I feel like the customer service needs an overall attitude change. Also, the food takes a pretty long time to make it to the table/take-out. I understand they serve great food but that isn't the only thing that makes a restaurant worthy of patronage."}
{"text":"BF had suggested this place, I lived down the street from it previously for years and never tried but they were busy for a middle of the week lunch and the menu look good.
We started with the hummus... it was cool and creamy served with warm pita bread, I would go back for this alone. I ordered a plate that came with a small greek salad, steak fries and a grilled chicken skewer with a side of tzatziki. The salad had fresh crispy romaine, some of the best goat cheese Ive had, onions, olives, carrots (maybe? cant remember!) and cukes. The chicken was very tender and the marinated was good, the tzatziki was cool and creamy and worked perfectly with the dish. For a little over $7 this was a great deal. BF opted for the burger and fries and he enjoyed the burger, nothing fancy but he said it was better than he had expected. 
Service was good, they came by often to check on us and made sure our drinks were refilled. We enjoyed sitting outside, relaxing and enjoying a good meal."}
{"text":"My favorite little Greek place for the past two decades - the tzatziki dip is addictive. Go for a kabob platter and sample the Greek salad, steak fries, and grilled meat along with pita bread. The turnover is low and the servers seem happy, prices are reasonable and takeout is fast enough for a quick lunch break."}
{"text":"Interesting experience. Although it looks like a diner, you place your order at a counter and they bring it to you. However the service was very disappointing. The cashier who took my order payed more attention to the customer, a guy behind me, than I. I ordered the chicken kebab dinner, with fries, a Greek salad, and pita bread for $7.99, not a bad price. However, I waited over 20 minutes for my food and not be given a #, the servers just walk around and see who it belongs to.
So, the chicken was seasoned great, and I enjoyed the sauce and pita bread, but the Greek salad was bland and the fries cold and not cooked or hard a rock.
Not the best Greek in my mind."}
{"text":"Great food, consistent and good value. Gyro Platter is good! #6 very good. Greek salads always good."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. Poorly run and mediocre food. Called in an order for takeout - a whole 2 items and they forgot to include one meal when we came to pick it up! Plus we ordered from the online menu and I tried to order a couple things that she said weren't available. Then as I was asking the girl about the combo platter (probably my 3rd question) she told me the menu online isn't up to date. One, wouldn't you tell me that up front? Two, why wouldn't they pay someone a hundred bucks to update the website?! So inconvenient for both sides. 
Now the food - aside from the order being wrong, when we got home (only 3 minutes away) the pork was so dry it was hard to chew. The grilled chicken had way too much garlic in it and the pita was soggy and flavorless. They offered a to-go menu on our way out but we didn't take it. We'll never be back."}
