{"text":"I have been here on 4 different occasions and every time I was very pleased. The potatoes served with breakfast are seasoned well and very good. I also enjoyed the club sandwich that was so big we split it and had plenty with the large helping of crispy fries! There was plenty of meat and toppings! Another visit I had the turkey sandwich that was an actual turkey breast sliced and served and not subway lunch meat! There have been several restaurants located in this spot but I know this one will make it! Cute atmosphere and good place for any age. They do have many flavored ice teas and coffee as well as thrifty ice cream which I need to leave room for next time! I am a small business owner in the area and take clients there too! Wishing them much success and hope the area will support them!"}
{"text":"I had been here once before and enjoyed the breakfast burrito. Decided to take friend there today. Walked in no clean tables so waited two ladies ( one the owner)each cleaned off one booth and one two top. I asked if we could sit at booth. One other customer came in behind us. He was seated. We sat down. I watched both ladies serve meals to customers waiting. The man that came in after us was asked(by owner) what he wanted to drink, was given a menu and received his drink and order taken. We had not been greated or even talked to after we sat down. I sat and watched for 10 minutes. When the owner cleaned the table directly across from us that was it. The place was not busy. I was excited for my friend to try the new place. I said lets go. Someone else will take our money. So sad. So we ate at the Royal Cafe. Excellent service and food."}
{"text":"This is one of those small local treasures that are easily overlooked, but shouldn't be.  From the moment you walk in, you can feel the love in this place! The staff love the food, praise the cook (appropriately), and are focused on you, the customer. Coffee was refilled, orders were checked for details before they were put in to be cooked, and the food was brought to the table, and just like at mom's house...left overseers attempted to be sent home with you.       Great food at reasonable prices!      I highly recommend this cafe!"}
{"text":"Amazing! They have Loco Moco on the menu!!!  Today my 2yr old tried the pancake special (includes 1 huge pancake, slice of bacon and a slice of watermelon) and I tried  the Tuna Melt (includes a sandwich and a choice of side) I wish I took a picture but we were so hungry!   The food was very good! Can't wait to go back and try the Loco Moco (they said not a lot of people order it because they don't know what it is! So they didn't have rice ready -totally understandable) BUT they were gonna make some for me if I wanted - If we weren't in a rush to go somewhere, I wouldn't loved to try!) definitely next time!   The service was great! Our server was nice to give my daughter some extra watermelon slices for free because my kid was going crazy over em hahaha so of course, I made sure her tip was more than usual since she was so nice to do that for us.   We will be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and friendly staff! We stopped in for brunch and had a mix if breakfast items and lunch items. The service was fast and friendly! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere with an obvious community vibe, where the lovely servers greeted customers by name as they walked in. It was our first time here and we love this diner style \"greasy spoon\" that isn't easy to find anymore. We each had an omelette made with our requested ingredients, which was fresh and delicious. This came with a side of fried potatoes and sour dough toast and lots of butter, amazing! The coffee was also quite good and the service friendly. Highly recommend and this is our new favorite breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast and friendly staff! Great breakfast and lunch place!!! Egg and potatoes were great and I really enjoyed coming here, I will be back!"}
{"text":"Good food, great service & reasonable prices!! Menu has a variety of a selection for breakfast & lunch! Military discount with a valid ID card for active and veterans too!!"}
{"text":"A true diamond in the rough. Today was my 5th visit and if there's one thing I appreciate in a business, it's consistency.   The only thing that's changed from day one is the garnishment on the plate, which is a pleasant surprise. Otherwise, the restaurant has been immaculately clean with attentive service.  Great prices, delicious food, and perfect portion sizes are the recipe fur success in my book. They have it all!!"}
{"text":"What an amazing experience! Great customer service, super clean and cozy. The food is fresh, delicious and a lot. Great prices!!! I will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"This is a cute little restaurant, I've been back every Saturday for the past month. It's definitely a place I would recommend. The cafe is always so clean and has a great atmosphere. Sunnyside offers a simple menu that isn't plain. I'll continue to come back, thank you Lisa for your cafe!!"}
{"text":"We were over on this side of town and had no idea where to eat-as all the restaurants were near closing. We stumbled upon Sunnyside Up Cafe and were delighted with our hole in the wall find.   The people inside were very hospitable and enjoyable to be around. Service was great and we had no complaints. I personally loved the locals from Youngstown coming in and chatting. It just gave the restaurant the authentic home town feel.  The food was pretty good. Some of the items are definitely not homemade, but for the price and quality it was worth it.    There's only one complaint, the AC is terrible. It wasn't hot, but definitely sticky and lukewarm.   Overall, if you find yourself in this portion of town, come and try Sunnyside Cafe!"}
{"text":"My family and I tried Sunnyside Up Cafe today for breakfast; it was a wonderful experience and the food was excellent. Prices were very reasonable for the quality of food. I believe it was the owner that served my family and she was great with my four-year-old daughter. I've tried other establishments in my area and have not been impressed, so it was really nice to thoroughly enjoy everything I tried. We had biscuits and gravy, pancakes, a breakfast burrito with sausage, and country style potatoes. Food was all excellent and the service was great. You should try it!"}
{"text":"It was not crowded at all, food was amazing, and service was fantastic. Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I had an absolutely perfect breakfast this morning made up of a half order of biscuits & gravy, over-medium eggs, and bacon. My husband had burger and fries.....which he said was good but nothing to write home about. The staff was super nice and attentive. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"stopped in with the family.  the staff was very friendly.  food was good.  the only thing that kept me from giving a five star review... the bacon.  breakfast is so cheap to make.  use better bacon,  please!  that little detail is the difference!  everything else was great.  I wish you guys success!"}
{"text":"I ended up here because I was going to the old cafe that use to be there but unfortunately they closed and its now this cafe in there. When I walked in I didn't feel as welcome as I should the waitress kind of just stared at me. The place was really clean. The food though was DISGUSTING. I'm not sure how every single person has said this food is delicious. My potatoes were instant mashed potatoes from a bag, the green beans MAY have been fresh but I doubt it, my bread was really good, and my chicken fried steak was also DISGUSTING and it looks just like a frozen one you would get out if the frys freezer section. If I wanted instant potatoes and a frozen chicken fried steak I could have bough it myself and made it at my home for a lot cheaper than what I paid for here. If you're going to use instant potatoes from a bag ATLEAST TRY and hide the fact they are from a bag and put some salt and pepper on them. I most likely will not be back here. Ever. Wasted my money."}
{"text":"Our first visit was breakfast this morning. We were happily surprised on how clean everything was, bright and shiny. The decor is very cheerful. The menu choices are pretty basic, but that is good. I liked that the bacon was thick cut and cooked on a flat top and not deep fried. I really liked that the dishes are sprinkled with a light dusting of parsley flakes...makes it special. Everything was very tasty and we will be back to try out lunch."}
{"text":"We were looking for a new place to try and so glad we stopped here! They were all super friendly, the food was great, the place is spotlessly clean. We had the biscuits and gravy which were really good... yummy fries too. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great coffee.  Low prices.  Pretty good food.   Breakfast was good.   Out In Sun city."}
{"text":"Tiny little mini hot dog for about $5.50 (with tax). This is a seriously small hot dog- especially when compared to the one you get for $1.50 (with a drink) from Costco- the Costco dog is about twice as big and about a third of the price! Where do they even get hot dogs this small?"}
{"text":"My sister and I went there yesterday for breakfast. Service was great, as well as the food. I just moved here from Dallas this week and saw this by the post office. Very convenient. We will be back again and will bring our friends."}
