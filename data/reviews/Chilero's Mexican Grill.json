{"text":"We went there for the first time tonight, the food was just okay, nothing great and WAY overpriced for the type of restaurant it is.  We went because of the reviews but now I am thinking they were all written by staff and family.  Don't get me wrong, the food wasn't horrible it just was about twice the price as I would expect to pay for what it was.  The guacamole was very good, homemade and yummy.  The service was slow and I wasn't sure why, there were at least 3 ladies serving at it wasn't very busy.  We waited about 15 minutes for our check.  I doubt we will go back, there are better Mexican restaurants that cost less."}
{"text":"Not sure why but Chilero`s Mexican Grill is closed. No sign or note saying why. Will greatly miss this neighborhood establishment."}
{"text":"We visited Chilero's after purchasing one of those $40 worth of food for a $20 \"coupon\" online.  As I will explain, I would give Chilero's a 1 star based on ambiance, a 3.5 stars based on food, and 5 stars based on attentive and friendly service.
The restaurant is located in a strip mall type setting; you can buy swimming pool supplies next door.  Upon entering the restaurant, we found modest, if not spartan, tables with metal chairs scattered about in an odd-sized eating area, giving the eating area a rather cold and uninviting look.  On the north side of the restaurant, there are bar stools in front of what looks like a river rock facing to a bar/counter area (perhaps the highlight of the restaurant's decor) with a kitchen area behind it, showing off glimpses of its stainless steel components in the background.  
We were promptly and warmly greeted and invited to seat ourselves \"anywhere we wanted\", and menus (the \"lunch special\" menu and regular menu) and chips and salsa soon followed.  The regular menu prices seem high for typical Mexican fare, but the $6.95 lunch specials seemed fair and reasonable.
We were pleased with the quality of the food and its presentation.  Nothing real unique in terms of offered items, but everything that came to our table was freshly cooked, in good portions, nicely presented, and all accompanied by first-rate and attentive service.  Our chicken fajitas came on a sizzling hot platter with an accompanying side plate with two large tortillas, refried beans, spanish rice, quacamole and sour cream.  We also received a supplementary plate of vegetables (green and red peppes, carmelized onions) and a visit from the owner who apologized for standing in for the cook who was out sick (there was nothing to apologize for).
Overall, if ambiance is not a primary factor in eating out, you will be very pleased with the food and service at Chilero's.  Nothing really unique or outstanding on the menu, but what they offer is done very well, with very friendly and attentive service."}
{"text":"First the good: The food is good and the service is attentive. Our server made sure our drinks were always full and one of the bussers also asked us if we had everything we needed. Another reviewer said they were charged for chips and salsa. We were not. 

Now the bad, which unfortunately completely outweighs the good. The atmosphere is terrible. First, if you go at night, bring a flashlight because it is too dark to see anything. Second problem is the seating. It is cast iron mesh with the back of the chair being too far back to offer any back support. In about 5 minutes, you'll feel as though you are sitting on a solid block of iron, that's how uncomfortable they are. It escapes me why anyone would select the most uncomfortable seating imaginable for a restaurant. The third problem is the music. It is a constant, incessant barrage of Spanish accordion music. I suppose it's intent is to conjure up images of a quaint Spanish cantina on some backroad of Mexico, but because it is non-stop, it quickly grates on your nerves. And fourth, there is a large refrigeration unit in the dining area that emits a loud, unceasing drone. 

It's a shame too, because if it wasn't for the atmosphere and seating, we would go back. However, there are simply too many other restaurants in general and too many Mexican restaurants in particular to visit for us to return to a place with such a disagreeable atmosphere and awful seating."}
{"text":"Great food and good service,atmosphere. Only been twice so far, once for lunch with one son, fast, relaxing and delicious food, The chips and salsa are homemade and really great flavor. I drug my sister and nephew in the other night with my other 2 boys and they all loved it, my oldest son 17 loves Mole pollo and is particular about it, the owner/our waitress gave him a nice sampling to try it and he loved it! I just can't mix Chocolate and meat! Great alternative in North Mesa to the chains along Power road!"}
{"text":"We really like this place.  The food is good and the staff is friendly.  We have been there a few times with the family and it is always good.  Kids love the variety and enjoy trying new things.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I went here with a gf who RAVED about it.  I have to say, I didn't feel the same way.  It was really, really bland.  I didn't think Mexican food could ever be described in such a way, but such is the case.  

The service was slow but it was lunch time and only one person working, so I will take that into accout.

The prices were fair to moderate for the lunch special.  

The food, when finally served was lukewarm and just had no taste."}
{"text":"Restaurant is clean and food is good but service staff needs training.  Beware, if they ask if you want chips and salsa - they are not free!  Most places offer complimentary.  Not here.  $2.50.  The casual request as you are being seated is a little misleading.   Charging is fine but don't imply it's free.   Get the Groupon for $12 for $24."}
{"text":"My husband an I used a groupon deal to try them out. Good thIng as they are a bit pricey. The food was bland, not what you expect from Mexican. Everything tasted watered down. Too many other restaurants to waste $30 on a meal for two."}
{"text":"I really appreciate small neighborhood restaurants that take the time to do a complete decoration job.  The minute we walked in the door, the decor said \"friendly and fun\".   I'm not a big fan of the usual fare offered in Mexican restaurants, but this one offered small different selections.  The carne asada steaks were HUGE and quite tender.  And the price was below $15.00.  We'll definitely be going back.  (They are closed on Sundays.)"}
{"text":"Nice little family run place.  Love their beef tacos  & chips!  All in all a stop worth making, much better than any of the chain restaurants."}
{"text":"Loved the place! Extremely friendly!!! We love salsa and my girlfriend and I skipped hitting the dives on Main and tried out Chilero's.  We just wanted to pick up some salsa and when we asked how theirs was, the lady poured us some of each and gave us a big bowl of chips...the kind that other places charge several bucks for.  They were fresh and the salsa was great.  We also had the green chile pork. AWESOME!  Didn't sell beer but she told us to bring our own beer or wine next time.  Went back again with a cooler of beer and ate.  Paid really reasonable restaurant prices for large portions of food and drank beer at grocery store prices."}
{"text":"I need to make one thing clear: this place is good. Apparently my first review gave the wrong impression, as if I was unhappy with this place. Well, consider the 4-star rating then. That's good! And consider the 4-star rating now. Even better, considering I've been back several times!

You should check this place out if you're in the area. The service is fantastic, and you'll be supporting a local business. How refreshing. 

There's something on the menu for everyone, including a tasty chilero salad for those watching their calories. I always order the shrimp quesadilla, though, with the side of raspberry chipotle sauce. It's addicting, and I find myself craving Chilero's from time to time. It's just one entree I'll never grow tired of eating... In fact, I'm craving it now!

Hey, the last time I went with the family, it was my suggestion to come here! So, yes, this is a great option for anyone in or near Mesa who likes Mexican food done well and served by friendly people who actually have a vested interest in the success of the business. You'll get top-notch service in a charming establishment. So go. Please. Support local businesses!"}
