{"text":"Beer was good service was extremely slow especially from the kitchen. We were not able to alter our selection at all because cook said we couldn't change his burger choice. He's no Michael Simon."}
{"text":"Awesome bar food, great beer, all hidden away in the little town of Avon. I feel like goo dpatios are hard to find  and ABC delivers. Will definitely be coming back, loved our service!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on my way from Detroit to Cleveland. Great atmosphere! Big open bar, lots of TV's. Ryan the bartender was very knowledgeable in the different beer offerings they had, plus he had a wealth of knowledge about the 200 year old building that the brewpub is housed in. Definitely ask for the history lesson. I had a flight of beers and for me, the standouts were their award winning KoKonut Porter, the imperial black ipa and their French Creek IPA. So good. They have lots of seating and a big deck out back overlooking the creek. What more can you ask for. I will definitely return to hang out out there this summer."}
{"text":"The service was AMAZING! It was fast and the server gave great suggestions and was able to help us decide on a beer that we both enjoyed! We both ordered an Eagle IPA and it was delicious and tasted just as the server described!  The food came out fast, and exactly as we ordered but was nothing special. I will definitely be going back to enjoy the great patio and delicious beer!"}
{"text":"I travel for work and generally spend a good deal of time in one area.. I have now come to the Avon pub 5 times and always the food has been great, great staff always had fun and a great meal"}
{"text":"Absolutely great local brewery experience.  I sampled all their brews and NONE disappointed me at all.  I had two appetizers and neither disappointed at all.  Absolutely try the Blue Mussels ... they are amazing."}
{"text":"We love going here. Simple but good food and these guys know how to brew beer!  All their brews have great flavor. There is a wide variety and the have some outstanding guest taps as well.  Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go in Avon Ohio, the beer selection is amazing and the unique menu is quite tasty! The new owners have really taken this Brew company to the next level! I am very excited to have our holiday party there this year. I think the staff will really enjoy this establishment."}
{"text":"Came here Saturday afternoon just before Thanksgiving weekend.  Found seats at the bar and noticed the Halloween decorations were still up.  The place looked nice and clean.  We were so excited to try the menu but ended up disappointed. Both dishes came out cold and my calamari dish was under cooked and way to chewy.  The service was just ok.  Not sure if we would return."}
{"text":"Shocked to see any negative reviews.  This place is great! My favorite beers are Ohana and Medicinal wheat (I like wheat beer). The food is always delicious.  All their sauces are home made (BBQ, dressings, dips, etc.) and everything is fresh.  When we want a casual spot to grab a bite and have a couple beers this is the place because it's always good."}
{"text":"I've been there 3 times now and I can say that the beer selection is very good but the food is mediocre at best. The staff is friendly the service was descent . Another thing was it is exceptionally loud in the eating area almost to the point where you have to yell to talk . I would go back again but only for some beers."}
{"text":"Very comfy and relaxed atmosphere with good service. We had the Avon Brewing Company flight and the Christmas flight. The flights were delicious and they have a good selection of other beer as well. The food selection would fall into the bar food category but it was definitely above average and very enjoyable. We are looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"18 of their own brews on tap, 6 guest brews. Very good/fair prices on flights, and a nice selection. Tons of bottled options. Good atmosphere and excellent bartender today. My first time here. I'm excited to come back and try more beers. I simply had a 4 beer flight today of their own brews. All decent to good, one quite good...none great.  I'll update down the road when I get back here. I'm impressed so far.  Can't comment on the food."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped here on a Wednesday night for a Cavs game and it was pretty empty but it also was 9pm on a weekday. We have been wanting to stop for awhile because we drive by it all the time but it seems that we always want to come when they are closed (sundays). Right away we noticed their patio which sits right next to the parking lot but any place with a patio has to be great right?! The restaurant is actually fairly large. The bar is a great size and they have a good amount of high top tables.  I started off with the Blonde Ale (it reminds me of Platform's High Brow) and ended up drinking that he rest of the night because I loved it. My boyfriend ordered the Pale Ale Wheat which was also delicious. Men be warned it comes our with a piece of pineapple on the glass  making it look like a fruity cocktail (ha ha). We ordered 3 menu items to share the grilled romaine, asparagus flatbread and the espresso  dry rub wings. Definitely order the wings! Everything was delicious but those wings were so incredible and we almost didn't order them but our bartender convinced us...thank goodness!"}
{"text":"So glad I finally got to this place. The beer they brew is really good. Tried 4 or 5 and liked them all but stuck with the Avon ugli IPA.  Bar tender David was very helpful and gave good service. The menu is awesome. Lots of chef's specials. The cheese plate was the best I've ever had. $13 and worth it. Hope this place sticks around longer then the past tries did.  For sure  a regular stop for me now."}
{"text":"This was a great experience! I had the chicken dip and it was great! All of the food at our table was delicious! There were pretzels and wings that could win awards. Our server was very knowledgeable about the beers. Even if she didn't like a certain flavor she was able to explain them. We had a table of nine and they had no problem accommodating all of us."}
{"text":"Good food and wide variety of beers. Kind of pricey on certain items but everything seems reasonable."}
{"text":"The food and beer was mediocre. My chicken sandwich was a little dry but tasted ok. The fries were pretty bad and the homemade root beer watery. Decor is nice, though, and service friendly."}
{"text":"An awesome addition to the French Creek District in Avon, Ohio! From the impeccable service to the hancrafted brews and cocktails,  your experience is well worth the waitlist you may encounter on the weekends. The menu is  genuine, and built and prepared with passion by Chef Brian Weaver. Aside from the dinner menu, the chef always has plenty of dinner features to add variety and keep dinner interesting for the regular clientele! Great Job ABC! Cheers to many more years!"}
{"text":"Visiting my Kids the spouses n Grand kids in Cleveland area and went for the fish during lenten Friday.  First off the beer is real good.  Barista Blonde is worth drinking every day. Notes of coffee in beer are traditionally for dark porters. That was a great surprise.  The help was absolutely tops. They stayed around and several people came around and made sure all was well. No complaint at all.   So, the beers of which I tasted several were worth going there. However I went for dinner and to me, a beer was a side dish. The food was portioned small and that's my issue. I even paid of an extra piece of fish and I didn't have enough to call that plate the fish fry. The wings were among the smallest I've ever seen and the cod bites were to few to share.   In closing I'd pay the additional food cost for a proper helping. I hate not getting enough. :/"}
{"text":"The Best chile beer I've ever had including those in New Mexico.  They use real green Chiles from hatch New Mexico.  The burgers are great, so was the chicken wrap"}
{"text":"It has potential;  The owners are very nice;   I wish they had some draft beer that I  knew, or had a micro-brew conversion chart.   It does look like it could be a fun place for a large group of people that want to drink.  Parking is limited in the French Creek area, but I did learn that all the lots are shared, so there is no fear of getting towed.  The food needs some improvement;  I have not found a meal that I really like, after 3 visits.  One more thing:  The chef may be related to the soup Nazi;  He refused to put my dressing on the side;  I guess you cant modify the menu."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed every meal I have ordered.  I have visited about eight times. Interesting historical spot. Friendly staff. Definitely recommend it for you."}
{"text":"This was our first time here. Sat on the outdoor patio. Beautiful overlook. My husband ordered a flight of their beers and I had a Georgia Peach cocktail? It was purple and I wouldn't order it again. Didn't taste anything like peaches. More like pot poured. Live and learn I suppose!! We started with the onion ring appetizer. They came out smoking hot and crispy with a green chili aioli that had a gentle heat. Very tasty!! I had the BBQ chicken sandwich and fries. The sandwich was buttermilk fried and a tad overdone for my taste but still good. The fries were no longer hot. Should have asked for fresh but was a little too hungry. My husband had a special. The Kimchi Cuban. He thought it was very tasty!! We will definitely try them again!"}
{"text":"Avon Brewery is a craft brew house that currently has six house beers on tap along with approximately 15 guest brews as well. I always recommend a flight of beer to fully immerse yourself in the experience. Along with beer, I ordered the Grilled Romaine salad & the Black Bean & Corn Spring rolls. The food arrived in a timely manner and was very tasty. My favorite beer was the French Creek Pale Ale of which I enjoyed 2 pints. The bartenders are very knowledgeable & friendly, which is very important in a brewery setting. The bar/restaurant is expansive and will comfortably seat a large party or an intimate gathering. There is ample outdoor seating as well for warmer weather. I highly recommend the Avon Brewery for an awesome time. Cheers!"}
{"text":"A solid 4.  My kids and I were looking for somewhere to grab a quick bite to eat in Avon.  I had heard good things.  Bonus points RIGHT off the bat as my son, in typical ADHD fashion, grabbed the hostess stand to hop on the little ledge, only to have it almost tip over....and the guy behind it, totally unphased, said \"Yep I do that all the time.\" And so we stayed.  Food was good, but we only had kids meals and I had a salad.  Was a little surprised that some of the kids meals included sides, and some did not.  So a kids mac and cheese ($6) plus fries ($3), was a bit steep.  However....that Mac and cheese was literally to die for.  Homemade....creamy, almost had a brown butter taste to it.  I'll pay 6 for a little bite of heaven!  Service was excellent.  Above and beyond.   So I'll be back when I'm adulting.  For brews.  Or mac n cheese.  Or whatever."}
{"text":"Had the Poppa Popper burger and French Creek Pale Ale.   Both excellent!! Hope this place does well. The house brewed beers were great."}
{"text":"They still have some wrinkles to iron out but I've seen steady improvement over my visits.  1. Beer selection is good and their in-house brews are pretty decent. 2. Food is okay. A little heavy handed with the flavors, but that's better than bland. 3. Service is friendly but really lacked in knowledge earlier. Much better on this visit.  Tighten up the service. Dim your lights a tad at night. Keep serving good beer and good food."}
{"text":"Steak was outstanding. Good value for the price and all around exceptional food.  Waitress was friendly, attentive and quick. Dont pass this place by. Beer selection seems to have something for everyone's taste. Family friendly dining room if one doesnt want a bar atmosphere. We will be back."}
{"text":"When a place brews its own beer, it can smooth over quite a few missteps in the food and service arenas. Well, for me that's the case. We've been here twice now, so this is a bit of a combo review. The first time was during the summer and we sat out on their patio. The second, about a week ago, was an inside job. I'm going to try and rank the areas individually here. Something new. We'll see how it works.  The Beer: **** The beer here is really, really tasty. I'm talking about the house-brewed beer, of course. I have turned myself into a painfully picky beer snob over the last 5 years or so, so not I spend just as much time nitpicking as I do drinking. The brewers at Avon clearly know what they're doing. I have no idea what the hell the other Yelpers are are talking about when they're complaining about the beer. It's like they're expecting some kind of life-altering experience when they drink or that they should have unicorns fly out of their snifters trailing rainbows from their asses. Whatever. ABC is solid brew. They have some delicious renditions of pub faves intermingled with some rather beer geeky creations. I'm talking specifically about their double black IPA called Black Widow and their brain cell murdering Old Man River barleywine. With nearly 20 taps at any given time, you also won't have any trouble finding something to satisfy your liquid barley itch.  The Food: ***  The food is actually pretty good. It's not great, but for a place of ABC's ilk, it's probably about what you'd expect. Think belly-filling bar food that won't break the bank.The burgers are well-made, well-seasoned and yummy. The wings are crispy and dressed to the nines. The salads contain fresh, inviting ingredients and are coated with just the right amount of drizzle. The jalapeno hushpuppies are so damn good I'd eat them off a stranger's dirty foot. The main issue with the grub is that it's inconsistent, even across dishes during the same visit. My last order of fries was a pile of tater afterthoughts barely big enough to dip and my wife's salmon on her grilled caesar salad was brutally overcooked.  The Patio:**** This is one of the best features of this place. It's wide open, has umbrellas for shade, plenty of seating and it overlooks a scenic little valley the runs to the side of the property. The bad part - and this is by no means isolated to ABC - they permit smoking on the patio. Smoking should not be allowed on any patio at any restaurant anywhere. IMHO anyway. The reason for the 4/5, too.  The Service:**** We have received nothing but excellent service both times we've been here. Our servers have been attentive, prompt, and knowledgeable with our last server actually training a new ABC recruit during our meal. He was doing a great job and so was his shadow, btw. We are always promptly seated, too, but it probably helps that we eat pretty early compared to most.  Others have knocked the parking situation here, but I can't. That's just something they can't do much about. The front lot, basically a Twister mat for cars, isn't worth your trouble. Go around back and look for a spot there, it's much easier. Barring that, you're on your own. Uber maybe? Overall, Avon Brewing Company is a good thing to have in the area. It's a solid joint with really good service, some hit or miss food and damn good beer. It's local, it should be supported, and so I will. Besides, I live like 8 minutes away now and, well, you  know, beer and all."}
{"text":"Wow. This was not a good experience. Waited for about an hour. There were little kids running all around the eating area screaming and acting ridiculous. Then we can talk about the service. \"Non existent \". People that arrived after my party did received dinner before we received appetizer. Then there was the food. Nothing to cheer about here. Below average meats and soggy waffle fries. Ok. Pretty sure I won't be back. Gave it a try. Won't go again."}
{"text":"We decided to check this place out finding a parking spot was challenging. Not due to the restaurant being packed just limited parking period we finally found somewhere to park.  Once inside we were greeted and seated pretty quickly. My husband was excited to try the beers upon the waitress recommendation he decide to do 5 flights or samples of their beer after he tried them all his thought was they were just ok nothing he thought was great .We ordered the buffalo chicken dip came with round tortilla chips the chips were borderline stale dip was spicy with lots hot sauce we liked it.  On to entrées my husband decided to order a cheeseburger and asked for medium well. Waitress was quick to advise us to say chef will only cook medium only as stated on the menu he decided to get it anyway. It came with shoestring fries overall he said burger was ok he really liked the fries and so did I (yes I sampled his see below to find out why)  I asked for a house salad but asked instead of mixed greens could I just have it with Romain lettuce I was told no the chef will not change the lettuce. So then I asked can I have a Caesar salad (made with romain lettuce) dressing on the side I was told no the chef will dress the salad with perfect amount of dressing but nothing else. Feeling at this point at loss for words and wasn't gonna just order a burger as I could not get it medium well either I just said I'll take the Caesar salad. It was a salad nothing special did eat much of it and felt it had more dressing than I wanted.  We were both felt unsure if we want to return they had other things on the menu we would like to try but seems the chef is unwilling to bend to provide a better customer service experience. Asking for a medium well burger and asking for romaine lettuce on the house salad was not an out of the ordinary request.  Final thoughts beer was so so, food so so, chef thumbs down. We figured there are plenty of other restaurants that will make a medium well burger and accommodate salad preferences.  We love to support the local mom-and-pop businesses this just place missed the mark for me."}
{"text":"We wanted to love this place.  We tried many of their brews, which were generally well-crafted and tasty.   Limiting the number of selections to increase quality and focus could be a good strategy to consider.  We ordered burgers on burger night. 80% of our burgers were overcooked - it was like we should not even bothered ordering a cooking temperature.  We wanted to love this place."}
{"text":"Medium wings and orange ginger are very good. Tater tots are good. Ask for crispy, otherwise they are just ok.  Sachetti was outstanding. Guinness on tap! Barbacoa tacos were tasty. Service was great. We will be back. They even changed the tv so I could watch the TN game. Go Vols!"}
{"text":"To be fair, this place is undergoing the growing pains of a newly-opened restaurant.  The good news is that Avon has a non-chain restaurant whose proprietors want to bring something new to the city.  Came here with a large party for lunch on a Saturday, just a couple days after they opened their doors.  We were able to be seated immediately, thankfully.  The indoor dining area has plenty of seating, which is nice.  The decor seems to be an upgrade over the previous incarnation, including TVs hanging from the walls throughout the dining area.  The beer menu is craft-happy, and features five of ABC's own creations.  I will admit that I did not order one, as they had Southern Tier Pumking on tap.  My profile pic should explain the rest.  I did have a sip of the Pale Ale, and it had a nice full flavor, and definitely tasted like a Pale Ale should.  The food menu looks very appealing, with many interesting items to choose from.  For apps, we tried the \"totchoes\", which were tator tots done nacho-style.  We also tried the soft pretzel bites.  Both were to be served with beer cheese, but the cheese didn't seem to be house-made, and the waitress admitted as such.  This was a tad disappointing, as was the serving size for both plates, considering the price.  For the main, I went with the French Dip burger, which sounded a little better on paper than it was in reality.  They were served with a side of shoestring fries and a deli pickle spear.    Everything is made fresh to order, which is great, but the results from the kitchen were uneven.  One order was brought to the table wrong twice, and another burger was overdone on first try.  However, the kids mac & cheese dish was pretty tasty, and the kids were not happy that the parents were stealing bites from their plates.  One of the three owners, Matthias, came to our table and spoke with us about our dining experience.  He removed one of the apps from our bill because they took so long coming out from the kitchen, and may have comped my wife's burger as well (I believe).  We discussed how they were still getting the kinks worked out, which we understood.  Hopefully for ABC, they work them out quick enough so that they can establish themselves in a location that has not had much recent success (on the corner of Detroit and 611 in the French Creek district).  We will check back in a couple of months to see how they're doing."}
{"text":"Our Service was excellent! The beer was decent, the food, meh!   Pros: They offer paddles so you can try a lot of the beer. The cream soda is even delicious!   Totchos and Onion Rings and both accompanying dipping sauces were excellent.   Cons:   They offer Lake Erie Perch and Lake Perch. You would think you would want the Lake Erie Perch because it would be local. The Lake Erie Perch is clearly some mass quantity ordered frozen product. And it's the more expensive of the two!!! The Lake Perch however, is hand breaded and delicious and cheaper!! The Lake Erie Perch should be taken off the menu and they should be embarrassed to serve it.   If you order wings, which are nothing special, you get a generic packet of Ken's Ranch dressing that you peel the top off. If you order a side of ranch dressing wth your meal you get a thinner, homemade ranch. Why anyone would chose Ken's over homemade is beyond me.   The brat burger had good flavor but the pretzel bun doesn't hold up and is soggy slop before your first bite.   So all in all appetizers and beer seem to be your best bet!"}
{"text":"I don't understand the lower reviews! The beer is consistent and solid, the food is some of the best that I've ever had at a brewpub, they remember their clientele and they love what they do and do it damn well. I take out of towners here every chance I get and they are impressed. Keep it up Avon Brewing Company!! Big fan here!"}
{"text":"Beer and food are mediocre to bad.  Location on corner of two busy suburban streets is not enjoyable nor scenic."}
{"text":"Avon brewing company is a great local brewery right in the heart of town. The head brewer is a great guy who comes around to the tables and to make sure that people are enjoying his beers. The food there is top notch as well and we love going to this place for a beer and a bite. If you haven't tried Avon Brewing what are you waiting for?? Get there now!"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough about this establishment. From the welcoming staff to the amazing beer and food.... they've created a wonderful brew house. Family owned & ran, this place is a new favorite for my family. Kid friendly, too.  The owner is so friendly & took the time to come to our table to visit. We drove over an hour to get here, & will do it again every chance we get."}
{"text":"The beer is very nice...the kitchen, at this point, is to be avoided.  Distinct beers including a gorgeous coffee infused blonde, but the food was right out of the frozen food section of the local More 4 Less. Unfortunate and not cool..."}
{"text":"Got the green chili burger medium.  It came out well done (completely charred) and had almost no flavor.  They said it was supposed to be a half pound but it seemed smaller than a rock n roll mcdonalds quarter pounder.  The fries tasted old and stale.  Very disappointing for a brewpub experience.  I have seen similar feedback in past reviews so I am surprised they haven't made any adjustments."}
{"text":"Top Notch! Great food- terrific service. So many in house beers to choose from. Arrived hot & hungry, left refreshed & ready to go!"}
{"text":"I am terribly disappointed in this restaurant. Service is lacking and the food is... less than.  $11.00 flat bread pizza is a 9\" tortilla looking chewy mess with what may be asparagus tips??? Parking is hard enough, I will not be back."}
{"text":"Good beer and good service. My family and I were checking out a couple of breweries on my latest visit home and this was our second stop.   The brewery has three seating areas- an outdoor patio in the back of the building, a dining room inside, and the front bar area. We sat in the front bar area, but I'd recommend choosing one of the other two seating areas. There wasn't anything really wrong with the front bar area, but it was a bit dim and lacked ambiance.   The staff seemed very friendly. We were greeted by more than one employee upon arrival and our waitress was friendly. She supplied us with waters and had our beers out quickly.   The beer menu offered a nice selection of beers from Avon Brewing Company as well as beers from other breweries. Flights could be made up of five Avon Brewing Company beers for $10 or a mix of their beers and beers from other breweries for a little more. I liked that they offered the option to try both with the same flight.   Their menu is far from limited to beer. The brewery also offers home brewed root beer and cream soda. The drink menu also includes cocktails and local wines. We didn't have food on this particular day, but I was impressed with the variety of options for food. I could see myself eating here on a return visit.   I went with a flight that I shared with my parents. We chose only beers from Avon Brewing Company and the root beer. I loved the Root Beer because it had a great sarsaparilla flavor. The Verde Gold was delicious. It's made with Hatch Chile and was perfection. The chile flavor was present, but didn't make the beer too hot. The flavor without too much heat was delicious. The Barista Blonde was also delicious. Of the two beers and one soda I enjoyed I'd say that everything was a winner."}
{"text":"Really good beer they brew! The food is pretty tasty as well. A smudge pricey for your typical bar food but still really good."}
{"text":"Avon BrewCo is one of our favorite spots in town. I love the tasty eats (pear salad is my fave) and fun cocktails. My husband is a huge fan of their craft brews, especially the IPAs. The atmosphere is fun, the service is friendly and the outside patio is 2-thumbs-up in the summer! Flights are right-priced if you want to sample beers- CHEERS!"}
{"text":"My husband and I both agreed we were not impressed. The whole feel and the dining experience was just awkward. We sat there with empty beers and the server only asked us if we wanted another beer when she brought our check.   I felt like I was sitting in a cafeteria. There is no decor in the place. I had the corned beef wrap and it was cold as can be. Definitely unimpressed and for a $50 bill it was just not good."}
{"text":"In a metropolitan area where you can't turn around without hitting yet another new brewery at any given time, I came here prepared to be underwhelmed. Avon Brewing ended up rather gracefully leaping over the low bar I set for them. As is our wont, we ordered a sampler of the house beers to get a feel for the whole range. While the IPA was a little one-dimensional, we found few quibbles with their offerings. I especially enjoyed the black IPA and their blonde ale that had a touch of coffee. Were I in charge of the beers, I'd add a sessionable dark beer to their lineup; it's really the only thing missing at the moment. Some of the beers are available in smaller sizes, which is perfect for when I don't want a full pint of something.  As for food, we started with a very properly prepared sautéed calamari - a welcome change from the usual fried fare. We both went for burgers for our main course, and I have to say that I appreciated the ability to order a smaller (4 oz) patty so I didn't leave waddling. They have an 8 oz and a double option, too. The menu does warn that they all come out medium to medium-well; ours both had a nice char on it, but I do like mine medium rare. One nit to pick: the refrigerated tomatoes on the burgers were a waste of time. They made me sad. But the shoestring fries more than made up for that.  Service was initially a little slow at the bar (busy Saturday night) but it picked up from there. Our server was attentive, enthusiastic, and patiently answered all of my nerdy beer questions since he was also a passionate home brewer. He made a good experience even better. We'll be back to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Ive been here a few times now! The food routinely has gotten progressively worse than my first time. I wont go back. The food is undercooked or just not what I   Would consider worth the price. The beers are somewhat ok but, most of the good ones are made by another brewery.  Find another place in Avon to eat.."}
{"text":"Update: I've been back a couple times and this place is improving. Bumping it to three stars now but I feel like it'll climb it's way higher if it keeps striving for improvement.   I'm really bummed out that this place has opened with the same issues that likely put it's predecessor out of business. The food is the issue. It would get four or five stars if it were only a bar/brewery; however, when you serve poor food without any thought or care behind it, you damage your whole establishment.  My wife and I stopped for lunch on a slow September Saturday and ordered a flight of beer, a buffalo chicken wrap and the green chile burger. The beer is good and you're likely to be pleased if you stop in for a drink. I liked their pale ale and IPA the best, but don't skip their pineapple wheat or coffee blonde!  The burger was the worst I've had in quite some time. Dressed with only a smidgen of green chiles, no seasoning on the meat, and with what I would not call a brioche bun, the burger was charred to a crisp. I ordered it medium. Also, it looked really small for what they advertised to be a half pound patty (it looked like a quarter pounder). In the pic you should be able to see where the cook cut the burger nearly in half to expedite the cooking of it, which I didn't want. As a former grill cook I can tell you that is a sure fire way to dry out and ruin the burger. The fries were thin cut and as a result were really dry and without flavor.  My wife's buffalo wrap was a bit better but the grilled chicken was dry and it was oversauced. You couldn't detect the bleu cheese dressing. Fries that came with it were okay.   Please step it up in the kitchen so I can make this a regular spot!!"}
{"text":"Really, I'd like to give Avon Brewing 3.5 stars.  I didn't dislike them at all - I enjoyed the food and the beer.  They are heavy on the IPA's I know, I know, IPA's are in vogue right now but I don't really like them.  My husband does and says theirs are really good.  There are no \"fruity\" beers on the menu (which I enjoy) but the pilsner and blonde are really good.  They do have guest beers which is always nice in case you don't like the house brew.  The food was really good and different.  We had the \"tatchos\" which were tater tots with cheese, bacon and scallions on them. Really good!  We also had the buffalo chicken dip which was good, but I've had better.  You couldn't taste the cheese at all.  The pretzel bites were good, very soft and flavorful but the dipping sauce also lacked flavor.  I had the panzanella salad which was very good.  I'd get that again for sure.  The staff was really nice and helpful if you had questions about the beer or the menu.  I appreciate that.  There were kids as well as adults in the dining room where we ate.  The bar area is very nice and the bar itself is really pretty so I could see my husband and I sitting there for a few.  I would certainly go back but I'd like to see some different beers on the menu.  The bartender said their Christmas Ale is to die for so I will take his word on it and come back to try it."}
{"text":"Okay I am changing this from a 3 Star to a 5 Star!   Update since my last review!!! This place has turned it around! The food is excellent and we have been back twice this month. Originally we did not have a good experience, but we came back about a year later and the menu is totally different. Everyone must try the sachetti and the 3P tortellini! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times now to feel comfortable with throwing that 5-star review out that for all of Yelpdom to consume. It's a full service craft brewery with a robust beer menu. The Barista Blonde, Ohana Wheat, Ugli IPA and King Kokonut are standouts. Pretty full food menu so there's something for errbody. The atmosphere is a cool mix of local dive, hipster microbrew and sticks hangout bar. The bartenders are knowledgeable and beyond friendly...ask for my guy David, he is the TRUTH!"}
{"text":"Good beer selection. Brewed by cellar rats on the east side. Food was not good however. Nacho appetizer was average. Wife had the Reuben and I had the French dip burger - both with fries. Burger was under seasoned and the rest tasted of old grease. Prices are reasonable but was underwhelmed overall. I would drink here but not eat here."}
{"text":"What a great experience! Just got a grapefruit mule and it's delicious! Salad with added chicken and the house bacon shallot dressing is wonderful! The flat bread pizza is definitely a go to, and the buffalo chicken dip is to die for! Love the homemade cream soda and root beer. The bartenders are friendly and take great care of me or our group every time we are here. The menu has a few new items and I can't wait to try them. Have been here multiple times and love the place."}
{"text":"Okay. I have wanted to try ABC since it opened. I finally had the chance. Based on food, I would rate probably two or three stars. However, the staff was really great, and the service was fast. The prices are reasonable, and the location is nice. The building is old and cool, and it's clean.  Here's the bad. I ordered a plain Jane burger. The burger was not what I expected. I don't need grass fed Kobe (though it's nice), but this seemed prepackaged. Not good. My husband got the special, the boom boom chicken wrap. It was very good. I'd go back for that. We started with the pretzel bites, which were eh. I like the effort of them making a beer cheese dip, but it was still very eh. The beer. The beer was great. I got the coconut one (I forget the neat name) and the barista blonde. Both beers were very good. I would go back daily for that.  One more thing. ABC is closed Sunday and Mondays. They have missed out on my business for football games more than a few times. They have a nice set up and nice tv situation. I'm sad I can't watch games here.  Thank you ABC. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Beer was good....free chips and dip they delivered by mistake and didn't charge us for were good,  Heather's  totchas (tater tots / nachos) were good but the Blu-mussels that had gorgonzola and bacon were a little rough.   Tasteless.   Pretty sad.  And some of the help there is quite vain!  Extremely noisy too!  Not a great experience!"}
{"text":"We finally tried Avon Brewing Company, and so wanted to like it, but it fell short.  While we liked their craft beer, we thought it was pricey compared to other establishments we've frequented.  The food was not that good, I've had better in a cafeteria or as good.  The tab was $50 and for a few beers and food that was below fast food.  Sadly, we've been looking for a local bar that we can frequent - this will NOT be the place.  We would return for their craft beer if it wasn't so pricey."}
{"text":"Not a bad brewery, the patio looked good although I did not sit on it, it looked spacious. The beer was not bad but I was not a huge fan of the atmosphere. It's still worth checking out though."}
{"text":"Stopped in right as they opened and got a seat at the bar. Bartender(s) were very friendly and courteous. I got two drinks, an on-the-spot coktail (which was fantasic, props to the bartender) and an Irish Peach Sour, and then their double patty Volcano Burger. I'm usually a pretty heavy eater, but after eating the burger I wasn't able to finish my fries, which was dissappointing because they were beer-battered and some of the better fries I've had. Will definitely be frequenting."}
{"text":"Ace in the Hole IPA was awesome as well as the flatbread pizza and garlic/Parmesan wings!!!"}
{"text":"Nothing special here. There were 4 of us at the bar, all had drinks and dinner. I had the grilled chicken sandwich and it was ok but that is the good news. The BLT wrap was not that good and was ordered with no cheese but arrived with cheese. Another dinner was ordered with fries and came out with chips. For the last meal, a brat burger, the bun was inedible because it was so cold and the soup ordered with that sandwich had to be asked for well after the sandwich was out. The last negative and maybe a minimal one, the $8 cosmo ordered was made with triple sec not Cointreau.  The place is nice inside with plenty of seating. It was busy and a bit loud for dinner time, but it is a bar. The service was a bit slow and the food was subpar. Most likely we will not return anytime soon."}
{"text":"Go here for the beer, not the food!! I would have given them one star if I was just going off the food and service. The salmon was TERRIBLE!! It was over-cooked and didn't taste good at all. When I told this to the server he took my plate and said \"okay, I'll go see what the chef thinks\" and walked away. He actually brought my plate back to me and said since I'd eaten some of it (literally three bites and one was by someone else at the table), give it my best shot and they'd get me dessert. I eat out A LOT and have never heard of a chef doing something like that!! Also, avoid the tortilla soup unless you like spicy broth. To sum it all up, I spent 2.5 hours there but still stopped at Sheetz for some food on my way home ?"}
{"text":"Very relaxed atmosphere, the workers are very friendly and engaging and intelligent. The beer menu is just out of this World, they have their fresh brewed beer on tap along with other locals and other famous Brewers. The food menu is perfect for the style of this restaurant offering people plenty of options. This Brewery has an Untappd live feed on a screen and I think that is the coolest thing I've ever seen in a Brewery."}
