{"text":"The best Mexican food in the country as far as I'm concerned..homemade tortillas . We had the Arrachera Estilo Sonora.. a great taste of everything including then best skirt steak ever prepared. The refried beans to die for, guacamole and salsa incredible.. The cucumber margaritas are amazing and Arturo is bartender extraordinaire.. Loved it and can't recommend it enough!!!"}
{"text":"I had the arrachera and wife had shrimp tacos and they were pretty good! We also had the Carne asada quesadilla and it also very good. The salsas were very tasty, not very spicy though. The margaritas were well made and had a good balance if taste and alcohol. Very nice and clean restaurant with very friendly staff. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great place! Food was very fresh and super tasty. I had the Barbacoa tacos and they were the bomb  Very freindly and attentive staff."}
{"text":"Had a carne asada burrito and it was amazing! Loved the chips and salsa too!! Will def eat here again!"}
{"text":"Terrific taco lunch. Satisfied my craving for tacos. Tried three flavors, chicken, fish and barbacoa. Fish was my favorite but all were yummy. Also at $2 each for taco Tuesday a bargain."}
{"text":"The food here was awesome. We started with the carne asada fries which were incredible. Fries were just crispy enough, and the cheese was nice and gooey. My boyfriend had the shrimp tacos and couldn't stop raving about them. I had the arrachera, and it was cooked perfectly. And the homemade tortillas were delicious. The house margaritas were so good. No premade sour mix! Yay! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome I just tried\" tacos del compadre \" and they are the best tacos in town very good flavor and not to mention the hand made tortillas. everything about this place is great, very good services and very clean restaurant . I highly recommend this place if you are looking for an authentic Mexican food restaurant."}
{"text":"The customer service is excellent.  The food was a bit bland.  I likely will try them again and get another menu item.  They're super close to work and I move Mexican food, so hopefully it'll be better next time!"}
{"text":"I've been back several times to Ricky's and continue to try different dishes. What is consistent is the cool bartenders/staff, and Luis as he moves around his restaurant to ensure his customer's are happy!

$2 Taco Tuesday and you can't go wrong!  I've found my favorite dish at this spot, their Barbacoa tacos!  They serve their salsas warm and I have to tell you, it's the best I've tasted! Definitely not made in New York City! :P  Best Mexican Food in the area!"}
{"text":"Had an unpleasant experience but got a refund and the owner got ahold of me to try to make amends. Thanks."}
{"text":"Tried Ricky's for the first time today with coworkers.  It was off to a bit of a rocky start when I noticed that the table menu did not include some items that the website menu listed.  One of those items I had my heart set on - the Chicken Enchilada and Chile Relleno Combo.  When I asked about it, the waiter was unfamiliar with the menu posted on their website.  Anyway, they ended up letting me order it and it was really good!  All of the food is very tasty, you can tell they make it there, and the presentation is nice too.  The owner/manager was there and was very attentive to us.  He wanted to make sure that we were satisfied.  Very rarely do you see this kind of service at a restaurant anymore.  We agreed that we will be back.

Keep up the good work.  Make the table menu match the website menu and next time I'll give you ALL FIVE STARS!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat authentic Mexican food, rich flavor and quality ingredients. Excellent service and great atmosphere. I love it!!!"}
{"text":"I cannot understand how this place is open. Slow service, terrible margaritas (a ready mix from grocery store is 1000x better), cold and tasteless food, and it is expensive!
You can have a better experience, food and drinks, for your money in any chain restaurant or taco joint in the city."}
{"text":"This place is DT Scottsdale's finest garbage. Went here after a concert because it was the one place without a line before and after the concert. Now I know why. We spent $300 in about 90 minutes having shots and tacos and got nothing but dirty looks from our \"server.\"  Sorry to inconvenience you, Ricky's, sheesh. Also the tacos were clearly unfresh. The tortillas were stale around the edges and my guess is the pack had been out all night drying in the kitchen. Skip this place and wait in line somewhere."}
{"text":"This place has terrible margaritas. We even ordered a second round to see if perhaps it was just the first drink we got however; the second ones were just as bad! The \"large\" guacamole was not very filling at all and was very bland.... I definitely  wouldn't  recommend it and won't be back. For four 6 oz margaritas and an order of guacamole,  our bill was $50-- The atmosphere was not even that great either it's a construction zone surrounding the whole patio."}
{"text":"Great food. The shrimp tacos are bomb.  Bartender brea makes awesome drinks! Great company.  And the atmosphere is so chill. Definitely would bring all my friends."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had. Entrees came before our waters came 30 minutes later. Don't come here."}
{"text":"Walked in by mistake and WOW I'm glad I did. Awesome Shrimp tacos and a perfect Margarita and super friendly staff. I'm in Scottsdale regularly and this now on my rotation."}
{"text":"Disappointed. When we got there, we were told that they changed their happy hour time from 7 to 6:30pm, though their website clearly states it's until 7. The manager gave us the discounted price after i showed him the website, hence the only reason for the 3 star review. Drinks weren't good but the food was yummy."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been here a handful of times on random week nights. It's never super packed (which I have no idea why), but we've always left extremely happy we came. The service is great; everyone working there is attentive and friendly without being overbearing. The food is delicious. Guacamole is on point and one of my favs. The tacos are filling and fresh. The margaritas are solid and the huge ones you can share. I'm sure we'll be back again."}
{"text":"Close to work so it was a great spot to walk to from work.  When we got there no one else was in the restaurant  so it was open seating of your choosing around noon during the weekday.  The service was a bit slow but it worked because you didn't have that awkward server who checked with you every 2 seconds. 

Had the quesadillas...they were seasoned well, good and reasonable priced. 

They had a snub prior to us leaving with their credit card machine being down."}
{"text":"I'm not really active in the whole \"write reviews online\" thing because I feel most are negative but after my experience at Ricky's I decided I had to because it was that dang good! 
My first experience with Ricky's was after my late night shift in old town. They had a limited menu but that's ok. At that hour I'm just hungry and am not exactly looking for 5 star cuisine. I will be shocked the day you can order food at 3am and actually be impressed! But my actual dine-in experience was for from mediocre. It was great!
My boyfriend had been in a couple times beforehand and was excited to find out it was a Packers bar. He absolutely loved it and so this Sunday I tagged along. 
We were greeted right away by one of the owners and an old friend at the bar. 
After deciding on a table, we started out with wings. Shockingly they were amazing!  
 We ordered a chicken enchilada and chile relleno along with a carne asada burrito. All were above the par of what we expected.
After watching the game for about an hour we decided we wanted dessert and decided on the churros!! My goodness were these things amazing! They're made to order and you can definitely tell with every bite. 
Needles to say everything was delicious and the service was very personable. 
Definitely our new Sunday packers spot!"}
{"text":"I discovered this place last week and loved it. I had past by it many times, the out side and name is deceiving.  The interior is modern and sleek. the food is amazing!  This is real authentic Mexican food, everything was made with fresh ingredients.  The GM came over and said hello and made sure we were happy with everything.  I have been back twice in a week and told a few friends about it, they two were very happy. Its nice to see so much pride put into the food and customers. This was a great find!"}
{"text":"We were he only two in the place on a rainy Sunday afternoon, but we had so much fun! The bartender, James, turned on the game and sound we wanted, he was attentive the perfect amount and he made excellent drinks! The $6.99 two tacos with rice and beans special was so good! I recommend the carne asada. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I came here with a group of friends on Saturday evening around 7 p.m.  The place was empty, however the service was very slow.  It took awhile for all of us to get drinks.  Our server had a bit of an attitude at first, but warmed up.  She did not know what the house tequila was.  Whatever it was, it was not present in my margarita, which was extremely watered down and tasted terrible.  But I drank it, considering I wasn't sure when our server would be back.  When she did return, I ordered a different drink, this one tasted great but also did not have much alcohol in it, if any.  I left the restaurant more sober than I was when I arrived.  On to the food: The chips and salsa were very good, and we ate a ton of them because it took awhile for our server to take and deliver our food order.  The guacamole was ok, a little bland.  The quesadillas were fine, it's hard to mess those up.  The beans that came with them, however, were straight out of a can.  For dinner I ordered the shrimp tacos, they were pretty tasty and came with some good spicy salsa.  Now, this is what takes the cake, literally.  It was my friend's birthday and we were going to order a dessert to split, but we were told, \"Sorry, we are all out of desserts.\"  Huh?  Our server said they had catered a party earlier that day and ran out of everything.  She also blamed the slow service on being short-staffed, but like I said, the restaurant was dead.  She somewhat redeemed herself later on in the evening when we came back in to sit at the bar for drinks by giving us our first round for $5.  It was a nice gesture, but once again, my drink was watered down.  I'd rather pay full price for a real drink.  There are too many other great places to eat and drink in Old Town.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE UNLESS YOU WANT EVERYTHING TO GO WRONG!

I came here for my birthday on Saturday night and it was absolutely AWFUL!!

There were 8 of us who drove to Scottsdale from San Diego for my birthday. We all love tacos and drinking, so this place should have hit the spot. 

The waiter was super nice, but I don't think he could hear us very well over the loud music. I ordered a margarita when we first sat down and it was REALLY gross. It tasted like pure salt!! I hate complaining but we talked to the bartender and she made me a different drink. It was delicious, although fruity and not very strong. The bartender was very good about it and blamed it on personal preferences, but I suggested she taste how awful the drink was. 

As we complained about the drinks, we were talking to the manager about something unrelated. He was very friendly. Then another man came up that we assumed worked there and handed us all shots! We were like cool, this makes up for all of their poor service! 

We finally got our food. I ordered a taco salad with chicken and pico de gallo and sour cream on the side. Both were on the side and carne asada was on top. That's fine... we later dig in and see that there was nothing but lettuce and carne asada! It was suppose to come with corn, beans, and rice. Did they forget how to make their own food??

We let them know and our waiter brought us the rice and beans on the side. Shot guy comes around and gives us more shots!! Cool.

Well bill time comes and we look and we were CHARGED for not only the shots we took, but also the man that worked there!! We were appalled!! My margarita wasn't taken off the ticket either!! 

Pros: 
the people were nice and good looking

Cons:
Food sucked, drinks sucked. We had an awful experience and we we're expected to pay for it!"}
{"text":"I had a very bad experience here. Came in on a Friday night when the music was so loud you couldn't even hear the voice in your head. When we tried to pay our bill there was total confusion. We were overcharged/double charged. It was too loud to try and sort it out. The waitress gave my friend the finger. Never coming back."}
{"text":"Ricky's tacos located in the heart of old town. For the longest time I thought this place was just another bar in old town that happened to serve tacos. I went there on Tuesday evening after having a craving for tacos. The service was slow. I sat at the bar and the bartender was responsible for making all the drinks for the tables. In his defense he was doing the best he could to keep up. The tacos were pretty darn good. i did one fish, one shrimp, and one steak taco.  The fish was lightly breaded, full of flavor, and a good sized piece of fish. The shrimp shared the same batter and there were enough shrimp on the taco to satisfy you. The asada was my least favorite, not that it was bad, the fish was just that much better. They offered a decent happy hour. I would go again!"}
{"text":"i had the entire restaurant to myself on a recent Tuesday night at 8pm which is pretty unusual in anyone's lifetime at that hour. Regardless, I wanted to try the $2.50 tacos special. The grilled chicken and Carne Asada both had top quality meat and both tacos were very filling overall. I have been seeing cabbage on tacos lately, but that is not necessary, unless it is native to whatever section of Mexico Ricky comes from. The bar guy had the Suns game volume jacked up like he was watching in his living room and it is kind of weird just being the only person there, but hey the tacos and $5 Corona draft were on the spot and hit the spot as well."}
{"text":"Fui a Ricky's Tacos y Cerveza la semana pasada por almuerzo. Ida a Wadaa, pero estaba cerrado, y necessitaba comida mucho. Y Ricky's estaba conveniente. El menú es bastante corto y al grano. Pedi las fajitas de pollo para llevar. Su precio es de $15. ¿En Scottsdale es normal, no? Yo era la única hay alli, a los 1330h. Llega la comida mas o menos rapida. Y los camareros eran amable. 

La comida? Es normal. No era mucho sabroso, pero había un gran cantidad de ella. Y fue sufficiente para almuerzo. Es comdia tipica de restaurantes Mexicanos en Norte America. Creo que este restaurante es mas que bar, donde los cócteles son mas importantes. ¿Perfecto por 'happy hour'?

Creo que es 'A-OK'."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem and is now my go-to spot to eat tacos after enjoying a night out in Old Town.  The food is tasty and the service was great! Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Subpar Mexican, a lot out of a can, depressingly bad. 

We went out looking for good late night Mexican. We asked a club promoter and he said Ricky's was the only place in the area but said it was bad. If someone from Iowa thinks the Mexican is bad, you know it's bad. 

Got chicken and carne asada tacos with rice and beans. The beans and salsa weren't homemade, the rice was whatever and the tacos were not up to standard for this part of the country. 

Sadly even the house marg was bad. How do you mess up tacos and margaritas and call yourself a Mexican place?

The service was great and friendly and the DJ was awesome. Good check in for some beers and good music, just don't order any food."}
{"text":"Actually, the food was pretty tasty . . . room temperature, but tasty.  The first issue was there were a lot of other things going on there besides dinner.  There was some sort of fashion-show mixer going on so there were lights, cameras and lots of women in clothes that were too tight and wearing way too much make-up.  The second issue was our server.  She was nice enough and took our order.  My friend ordered the chili relleno/chicken enchilada combo.  When the food came out, none of meals were hot, but she got two chili rellenos and no enchilada. The server told her that \"they\" (not we) were in the process of changing the menu and they didn't have that combination any longer.  The manager ended up coming over and he said he'd bring her the enchilada, but it ended up taking 20 minutes and we had all finished eating my then.  Like I said, the food was actually pretty tasty, but everything else going on in there was a huge distraction from the enjoyable dinner we were expecting."}
{"text":"No thank you! 

This was a disappointing experience.  If it wasn't terrible service place potential because the food was decent. Unfortunately we had to ask for water four times... and My husband never got any. 


We stopped in for happy hour on Saturday, because of the sign on the street advertising it. We waited forever to be greeted at the table and then we're never actually assigned a server. So not only did we receive terrible service , the bill came and no happy hour pricing... When we asked about it, they said it was just Mon-Fri ... Then we let them know that the sign didn't say that, so they did look at the sign and honor it. 
 

We might give them another shot if they are still around in a couple months."}
{"text":"I went here with a group of friends (4 of us total) on CINCO DE MAYO just trying to get some tacos and margaritas. We sat in the empty waiting area for 3-4 mins before even being greeted and sat at a table. We got waters and chips & salsa then ordered our margaritas. We then waited 30 mins and still had not gotten our margaritas or had our waters or chips refilled. Even after asking our waitress how much longer it would be and if we could get refills. Needless say we got up and left without being served."}
{"text":"Chips & Salsa were good.  Fish tacos - unsure of the fish they used or if it was just old, heavily breaded with too much mayo.  Wish they had a sauteed option.  Won't be going back. Should have had a discussion with them since they are a new establishment, but I needed to get back to work."}
{"text":"I was excited about trying a new place after a night out in Scottsdale. The menu was short and easy, which can be helpful if you are the DD of the group. However the portions per price was high.
The waitress was semi patient with us.
It took a while for the appetizer to come, which we didn't even get until the entree was served. 
When the check came I paid in cash due to a recent problem with my credit card and waited for my change...for 20 minutes.
I feel that the waitress tried to take advantage of the group due to their intoxication.
In the end I went to up to find her and ask for the change, which she had to search for to find.
I found it upsetting that she tried to take  advantage of intoxicated customers and I wondered if that happend often after the clubs close at this place."}
{"text":"New place in the entertainment district of Scottsdale. Not your typical decor - more modern with blue neon lights under the bar, in the ceiling, and accented by blue walls. Very nice and calming atmosphere.

We started with the guac, chips and salsa and a couple of margaritas. We're a fan of spicy, so we pretty much devoured the spicy salsa and pushed  the medium salsa away. Spicy salsa wasn't overly spicy but did have a nice flavor. The guac came in a fried tortilla 'bowl' garnished with radish slices. It was chunky (onions, tomatoes, avocado) and was really delicious. House Margaritas were good - not overly sweet like so many restaurants tend to do.

When the name of the place has a food in it, you just have to order that food (especially if it's your first visit) so we opted for tacos: Barbacoa and Carne Asada. The refried beans looked really strange to me. Light in color and like a 'blob' on the plate - wasn't appetizing to me at all. I took a bite and didn't like them at all, but my husband thought they were great. Evidently they are not made from pinto beans, but a white bean, which is very traditional - that explains the light color. Both the barbacoa and asada were very flavorful. The tortillas were very fresh. The waiter later told us all the tortillas are made by hand on-site.

The staff was very friendly, stopped by several times to make sure our food was good, to fill our water glasses, bring us more chips, etc.

I definitely recommend. We're planning on taking out-of-town guests there in a few weeks."}
{"text":"I somehow come more often than I would think. I probably live 500 away at most so I consider the entertainment district of old town my bavk yard.... The reason I came so frequently is that is never to busy at happy hour and service is fast and I find all the employees friendly and approachable."}
{"text":"My friends and I got carne asada tacos and they were good. Could have been better if they would have offered salsa and limes. Service was mediocre. The waiter was careless and not attentive at all. Do not ask for the carne asada burrito!! It literally has all beans and NO MEAT!!!! Waste of your money!! Place could have potential but, they need to step up their customer service!"}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday at it's finest. Yesterday was my first dining experience with a group of friends. The six of us regularly dine out for Taco Tuesday and decided to try something new. The $2.00 taco special and chips with salsa sold us so we stopped in.

The Resturant was slow when we sat down around 5pm. We were immediately greeted and seated. The only drink specials were drafts but all other drinks were reasonable priced. We all ordered the $2.00 tacos from Chicken, Carna Asada, BBQA and Fish. We all had a little of each and they were some of the bet two dollar Tacos I have had. The flour tortilla shells were fresh. The garnish on the place was cute me tasty. The chips and salsa were good too. The customer service was wonderful from the gentlemen who served us. I would defiantly recommend this place due to the quality of the food and the variety on the menu. I will be back to try other items as the menu has a unique variety of main entrees as well."}
{"text":"The service was really good, the staff was excellent, the place it's self was nice and they had good outdoor seating. Although the food was pretty much white washed but what do expect in old town, not Mexican food necessarily."}
{"text":"Great service, not so good food, very small beer selection.. Especially for having \"beer\" in their name"}
{"text":"Ricky's is a Mexican restaurant in Old Town Scottsdale with no Mexican food? I went over the Labour Day long weekend after reading a lot of positive reviews, and with a craving for real Mexican food. It took quite a while for my friend and I to be seated. Despite the fact that the place was half empty, most of the tables were still covered in dirty dishes. When we were finally shown to a table and given menus, it took quite a while for a server to come and take our order. My friend ordered a Corona and I ordered a margarita - we were told that they were out of Corona. Really? It's CORONA. It's not exactly in short supply. So we changed our drink orders to share a Bulldog and off the waitress went. 

She came back about 5 minutes later without our drinks and asked to take our dinner order. We each ordered fajitas - and at that point the waitress rolled her eyes, tossed her hair and said \"Ok, we're out of beans and rice and tortilla chips, but we'll take $2 off any order that comes with those items as sides.\" Really?!? It's a MEXICAN restaurant - EVERY dish comes with rice and beans! Again, it's rice and beans! Go to Costco and get more! There isn't exactly a shortage of them. 

We agreed that we didn't want to eat there s nothing else really looked appealing on the menu, and we left. It would have been considerate of them to tell us this before we even sat down, rather than wasting our time while the hangry-ness set in. We also learned that nothing is open past 9pm on Sunday's despite it being a long weekend - so we ended up with disgusting take-out pizza. Boooo"}
{"text":"This place is great for so many different things.  Want to just come hang out during the day and watch a game.(here) Want to have a dinner in a lively atmosphere.(here) Want to pregame before the club.(here) Want to get some food after the club.(here)"}
{"text":"Amazed at how great the food is!! Right in the middle of Old Town with a great modern interior.  We have always sat at the large bar to eat, but they have a good sized dining room too; would be great to get tacos with a big group before the bar hopping begins.  

Chips and salsa comes with 2 delicious salsas, one a bit spicy and one with more of a roasted flavor.  Kicking myself now for not thinking to ask for a salsa container to-go! Now for the main event...Ricky's tacos!  First of all, all of there tortillas are freshly made.  There not doughy at all and have a great flavor for any of the tacos and/or burritos.  They fill each of their tacos with a cabbage slaw base, pile on a good portion of meat or seafood, and top with a pico de galo and mayonnaise cream drizzle.  The meat is very juicy and tender with great seasoning, while the seafood is all fried, but it has a good light fry batter that is used.  Also, all plates are served along with rice and black or refried beans.  

Service is very friendly, there is never really a wait to be seated, plus food comes out quick!  Excellent and plenty of food to enjoy at Rickys!  Already craving more!!"}
{"text":"My office is located in Old Town and I have been searching for some authentic Mexican food...well my search is over. 

Ricky's definitely delivered in authenticity. I ordered the carne asada tacos which I believe is their signature taco. Delicious!!!  Excellent flavor, juicy and tender and not fatty at all like some places. The rice had the traditional peas in it just like south of the border and the beans had a great consistency. Oh, we started with chips and salsa and the salsa was warm and very tasty. 

I will definitely be going back, probably to check out some other menu items along with the margaritas."}
{"text":"Their meat is so flavorful, I love this place! I get the carne asada and chicken nachos, or the filet taco salad...fantastic!!!"}
{"text":"Came here to grab a quick dinner before meeting our friends at another bar... we sat at the bar. Based on our experience, I feel this place is two-star worthy. Here's why:

-This place has no idea what it wants to be. There's neon, club-like lights everywhere and a bouncer checking ID's at the door... while its still set up like full on restaurant serving mexican food. I know a lot of places in Old Town have bouncers out early, but this place is just different.

-Big dude walking around the front of house, helping guests.. which wouldn't matter, but he had a chef's coat on that actually had the word \"chef\" embroidered on the front.. shouldnt you be in back of house orchestrating the kitchen? Whose making the food?

-Bartender 1 knocked my water all over me. Got my shirt and my pants. He offered me a free drink,  which was nice, but for some reason that just didn't feel like consolation enough. Bartender 2 watched the whole thing and just shook her head. 

-The tub of sanitizing water bartenders use to wash glassware was situated right behind the bar, in front of where we were seated. As bartender 2 washed glasses, drops of the sanitizer water hit my face. It probably got the food too. This happened TWICE. Definitely not cool.

-The food is just mediocre.

-When a place has the word \"tacos\" in the name, I expect a decently wide variety of tacos on the menu. Not the case.

I would eat here again if I was with a group of people who all wanted to go, but I wouldn't come here on my own accord, thats for sure."}
{"text":"Went here with a party of 8 around 8 pm. It took about 45 minutes to get our food, and the server got two of our orders wrong. I ordered the pesto shrimp tacos- they were bland and I was still hungry after eating them. I tried the steak burrito too. It was basically a pound of meat wrapped in a tortilla. 

The pro: good margaritas. Come for the drinks, skip the food."}
{"text":"I was walking past, and offered a free shot of tequila with the ticket I was being handed. On my way through the door, I was offered a bracelet entitling me to half priced drinks. So far, so good, right? When I asked for my shot of tequila, the bartender advised it was not tequila at all. What the heck - it was free. I asked if they were still serving food, and the bartender handed me a menu...a few minutes later he advised they were only serving the 3-4 items on the monitor up above. Why wouldn't he tell me that when he handed me the menu?? My half price beer was still more than most bars charge. The comments about this place not knowing what it wants to be are spot on. Blaring club music with a restaurant layout is just weird. Doubt I'll be back to try the food."}
{"text":"The food is bland, they LIE about the posted specials, the managers NEVER return phone calls and are magically NEVER in the office when you're attempting to reach them, and the so-called \"MANAGERS\" are very unprofessional. I've personally witnessed the FAT one in the white coat yell at employees in the front of the restaurant. LIKE, WHAT? At least take them to the back office if you're going to throw a bitch fit."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying that we just stopped by here on the way to another place but since we had some time to kill, we thought \"Hey why not?\"  We had two drinks and some chips and salsa but the people here were so incredibly helpful and nice, I had to say that Luis and his staff have the Customer Service side of things down pat and if the food is as good as the service, this restaurant should have a nice long life here.  I wish them well."}
{"text":"The guacamole was a generous portion and the carne asada burrito was to.die.for! We ate here twice during our long weekend stay. GO SEAHAWKS!"}
{"text":"Ricky's is the place in Scottsdale to come for amazing tacos. I love the shrimp ones."}
{"text":"Amazing food.  Fantastic service!  I'll be back! I highly recommend this place for anyone that loves Mexican food!  :)"}
{"text":"It looks like they finally got the message and got rid of the obnoxious club/techno music during dinner.  I can now give it a five-star rating.  Great food!!  We couldn't be happier and will continue to dine here."}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican restaurants I have been to.   I live downtown Scottsdale and eat out a lot.   This place has good food, atmosphere, drinks, and is not over priced.   I love the shrimp tacos, shrimp salad, and shrimp burrito.   Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Last night around 7PM my boyfriend and I were on our way to El Hefe for Taco Tuesday but decided to try something new & go here (of course I had anxiety because I didn't have time to check the Yelp reviews first LOL). We sat at the bar and there was like one other person in there besides us, so I was kind of worried. HH was still going on so I got a glass of wine for $5, it was nice big pour, & I spotted that it was one of my favorites -- Velvet Devil (which in stores is around $15) so this was a great deal for a bar. The boyfriend got a $5 HH margarita which was good, a little too strong for me, but I'm sure most people would love the fact that it was that strong. The Taco Tuesday special is for $2 ea you can get carne asada ; chicken ; barbacoa. So we got some of each & they were all really good & big for street tacos! A lot of stuffing, and even a big dab of guac, I was impressed. I would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Great friendly service! I enjoyed a delicious mojito and steak burrito. Before I leave I think I will have to go back and try something else. However the homemade  tortillas were tasty!"}
{"text":"Just tried RIcky's for the first time. Staff was friendly, place was fun with club music. The food unfortunately wasn't anything to rave about. I had called ahead of time for pickup order. They had some miscommunication in kitchen. I ordered the shrimp tacos, which were bland, and the sauce they used way to much Baja sauce.

May try again if they get a new chef. For now i'll be staying with Julio Too's downt he street."}
{"text":"Barbacoa tacos on Taco Tuesday were delicious.   Great family-operated restaurant with quality Northern Mexican dishes and fun, upscale decor, appropriate for the location.  These brothers are hard workers and are serious about delivering quality.   I especially appreciated the freshness of the warmly-served salsas, unleashing greater flavors.   You can catch me here regularly now for lunch."}
{"text":"We sure didn't have a very good experience. The server was pleasant, but got a lot of stuff wrong, ie: no silverware, wrong order, empty drinks, wrong info on menu item even after asking the cook. The fact that we were her only table made it all that much worse.  Food was really awful.  It is hard to mess up Mexican food, but they did it.  The \"relleno\" was a plain pepper with cheese whiz and no sauce or spice or anything, the enchilada was hard and nasty, the beans and mild salsa were both anemic looking and tasteless.  The tacos were just  \"ok\" . The only good part was the hot salsa.  Save your time and money and try something else."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible terrible.... These people are racist and awful customer service. Star away!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. We waited 15 minutes to have someone offer us drinks. We waited another 20 minutes and hen had to ask for a menu. The waitress never came back to ask if we wanted to order food so we left."}
{"text":"It's taco Tuesday on cinco de mayo and for some reason this place is dead. That should have been the first red flag. We sit down at the bar after standing at the sign
That said wait to be seated for 5 mins while the ONE waitress at the bar looks at us not saying a word. We have to ask for menus that are thrown down in a pile. We ask what specials are and wait as another bar tender comes out. They two seem really busy at the computer for quite some time. More people come to the bar waiting. Another group asks for a waitress and finally leaves after no service. I think this place is poorly staffed and managed. 4 different groups left just in the time we were there without eating or drinking. This place should have been pack on cinco de mayo."}
{"text":"We loved this place! the owner and her family were so hospitable! I would recommend this place to everyone for a classy casual night"}
{"text":"I was so impressed walking in here. The seating is very comfy, TV's all over. Menu sounds delish and the man who served us (also working behind the bar) was helpful and fast. 
Free chips and salsa (good salsa) 
I ordered chicken street tacos and my chicken was in tough tasteless cubed pieces. My boyfriend loved his fajitas and his chicken was nothing like mine. My tacos were missing some taste too. Maybe needed more spice. I may try their food again, but wont be the tacos or chicken."}
{"text":"I love Ricky's. The food is high quality and very fresh. I'm a very picky eater and if you ask for a custom order, they're amazing about it! I basically make up something different every time and they just say \"yep, we can make that!\" And they do, and it's glorious. 

I'm a vegetarian, and I LOVE their refried beans. They are made with butter instead of lard, and they're creamy and amazing! 

Portions are huge. Burritos are bigger than chipotle. All my meat eating friends love the tacos. 

It's always very dead in the day time (I've only been in for lunch), but I've been told they are a pretty big night drinking hangout place. 

If you work in the galleria and haven't been in to Ricky's yet, give it a try! Ricky's doesn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Best tacos ever!! I still think about them to this day. We went at 8-9pm on a Friday night and it was busy & loud but the service was fine. I had a top shelf margarita and it was decent enough. Not sure what all the complaints are about."}
{"text":"This place should be far busier at dinner than it is. The flour tortillas for the tacos are simply awesome, and the filling is good too. The rice left my husband totally satisfied. And the churros. Get the churros. Seriously. All for a really reasonable price of $10-15 a plate. The drink was weak and the atmosphere was lacking, but overall a really pleasant experience. The food isn't unique and creative-- but they master the basics."}
{"text":"So I'm currently sitting at Ricky's for about an hour and a half. We sat unacknowledged for 20 minutes. We ordered about 30 minutes ago, we are now on our 4th basket of chips and salsa. We've had one round of drinks. Granted there's 6 people in our party, however we ordered all the same beverages, burritos and enchiladas. We've had not one bit of acknowledgement from the manager who I can clearly see is running his butt off to cover up some sort of mishap. Our server came to the table about 30 minutes ago to tell us our food was right out. Only to say 30 minutes later it would be another 10 minutes because they've been backed up. I'll also mention that I'm a manager at a resort in Scottsdale so I work in hospitality and am extremely understanding. I understand that things happen, however I've never been this disappointed to write a review on the spot, but this absolutely has to be the worst service I've ever received in my entire life."}
{"text":"Really good food at a fair price. Service was top notch, very friendly. Not sure with the word Taco in their name you would try anything else, but looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by on the way home from a going away party for a friend.  Pleasantly surprised!  Great service and even better food.   The food is very fresh and authentic.   I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Oh wow!  Drove by and circled back to try it out. Don't drive by. GO!  The tacos are unique in creation and packed with flavor. I tried the shrimp, pork belly, carne asada and barbacoa tacos. I could eat them all night. Brea behind the bar makes the best Sangria I've ever had, anywhere. The place is decorated nicely and has both indoor/outdoor seating. The bar is large and has TVs to watch. Private booths and tables for ample seating."}
{"text":"Nice location, Tory was a great server and our lunch was great!  The salsa is very good and the chips were fresh and perfectly salted.  I had the carne asada tacos on a corn tortilla.  The 3 tacos come with avocado cream sauce and guacamole.  Great value for the price.  Awesome spot!"}
{"text":"Great place in Old Town for good late night food. :)"}
{"text":"This is a brand spankin new gem in old town Scottsdale. They opened up in June 2014. It's hidden around the corner from all the noisy hot spots -- El Jefes, Majerle's, etc.

Don't let the name fool you.....they're not just tacos and beer. Everything, yes EVERYTHING, is made in house (except for cheese and sour cream, they say). They make their own tortillas, taco shells and even refried beans. I chose the chicken burrito on this most recent visit. It's a massive platter that includes those glorious refried beans and a side of rice. We also tried the guacamole, which was equally as epic. Oh you'll also get chips and salsa as soon as you sit down.

Customer service here is outstanding. Manager Dave is truly passionate about his establishment. He knew far more about the ingredients they use than most front-of-the-house people usually know. He was an absolute delight, as was our server (sorry sweetie I don't remember your name!)

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"First time there for dinner after work.  I ordered the Sonoran fish tacos grilled and they were some the best tasting I have had in at least a year.  Their chicken burrito was also excellent and the refried beans were amazing.  They also had a nice sized margarita for happy hour.  Overall atmosphere was good and service was excellent."}
{"text":"Wow so the reviews about Ricky's running out of food are true, I thought they were a joke. No joke folks I went here last night with with a friend on Labor Day weekend. You would expect them to have a stock of food,right? Hell No! I would normally give this place a 5 because of the great chicken tacos they had, but after reading reviews, I'm sure they screwed those up. Anyways chicken tacos is what I ordered and they told they were out of chicken, beans and rice. My friend ended up ordering steak fries and I ordered a quesadilla. I guess it was ok, too much vodka in me to remember. But I remember Rickys running out of food. My question is If Rickey's so damn worried about spending money on food supplies, why you even in business? #1 reason why you will go out of business and these reviews will warn others"}
{"text":"Seriously most legit Mexican food in the area. Fresh tortillas, fresh and clean meats. Bringing all friends and family here to try it out. Ignore some of the reviews below, if your into great Mexican food you have to check this place out. Everything from the chips and salsas to the actual dishes are executed really well. I'm hungry again!"}
{"text":"Waste of time! Drove here from south chandler to eat breakfast (website shows serve it from 8a-3p) to find out they stopped serving breakfast months ago."}
{"text":"It's basically a sit down Taco Bell. Orders came out wrong (breakfast burrito vs carne asada), not authentic food and the nacho cheese is best described as cold Velveeta. Very slow for a night that wasn't busy. Maybe it was just an off night, but would not return and would not recommend. Probably better if drunk."}
{"text":"You will not think you are in a taco place at all. Serious disco funky vibe going on. I loved the neon flashing lights in the windows. We found this place by accident looking for the pizza place next door.  We were starving after attending a Mixology event across the street. From the minute we walked in we were treated like royalty. It is very apparent that Dave the manager just adores his restaurant. He is very proud of it and was a wonderful host, stopping by our table many times and yaking it up with us. I really felt at home here. 

It was not the best Mexican food I ever had but it was solid. What I had was very good and I would go back. Their Gauc is very flavorful and chunky here. It was delicious and I slaughtered the entire bowl. Haha! I was not a fan of their chips and salsa for some reason. I am not sure why. I think it was much more about me then them. Just a personal taste thing more than the quality of the food. It also could have been the Whiskey talking from the Yelp event we just came from. ;)----Oh yeah, I also had a Carne Asada taco that was pretty good. My Yelp buddy had a chicken Burro that she gave five stars to. They are doing something right for sure. I would go back for the service alone. Talk about being spoiled."}
{"text":"Went there to grab something to eat because the Patriots bar across the street was too crowded.  Glad me and the wife made the choice.  I had the fish taco's and she got the pesto shrimp taco's.  Both were fresh and very flavorful.  The fish taco's were beer battered and fried and came out great, not greasy like most places.  The chips were home made and hot and the salsa was fantastic.  I live in east Mesa but am definitely going back for more.  Well worth the trip."}
