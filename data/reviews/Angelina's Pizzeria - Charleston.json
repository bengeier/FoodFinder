{"text":"Good food. Delivery was right on time. Food was hot and the baked ziti had a really nice crust on the cheese ! 

Will order again I also loved they put extra honey mustard dressing I requested online and didn't charge me for it!"}
{"text":"There seems to be many Angelina locations in Vegas, but reading Yelp, I opted for the Charleston branch. It's located in a shopping plaza and the inside was surprisingly really spacious. There's carry-out or diners can choose to order restaurant style and sit at a booth or table. It's really more of a casual restaurant. I ordered a white pizza for the family and it was huge! Best of all, it was super cheesy and creamy. I've never described pizza as creamy, but the ricotta on the white pizza was just spectacular. There was plenty of spices and the crust was my favorite part. Nobody could stop eating this pizza!

 Angelina also offers appetizers, pastas, sandwiches, and etc. They have an online website with special deals if you want to check that out."}
{"text":"Ordered two meals and a dessert. The two meals were both missing sides and everything was overdone. I ordered delivery and it took twice as long as estimated. 

Honey dipped fried chicken dinner: did not come with corn bread and the 4 pieces were tiny, about the size of wings 

8 hot wings: very dry from being overdone and did not come with the side of fries. 

Zeppolis: came with a lot which was the only positive note of the whole order. Otherwise these were hard because they were over done."}
{"text":"The very first time I had a piece of Angelina's pizza I fell in love.  It was so yummy and the way a pizza should be.  This was when it was on the other side of town.  I have had it few times after from the new Charleston location and that is where the love ended.

The very last time I ever ordered from them was this summer.  The dough has changed, the taste has changed, the amount of toppings has changed, and worst of all the attitude of those who answer the phone is awful.  You hardly get a second to agree before you are placed on hold by someone who sounds like they would rather be anywhere else.

I don't know happened.  Change in management?  Cheaper ingredients?  Unhappy staff?  Whatever it is change it because the food and ultimately the customer suffers.  Sadly you will not see another dime of my money or time.  There are too many pizza joints in Vegas to not stay top notch against the competition."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. The food we ordered took forever. Not only did it take forever the food was just bad. Over cooked and so not worth the money. I'll never eat here again!"}
{"text":"I used to go to the location so I didn't get to wait the famous 1hr-1 1/2 waiting time for deliveries. Still I waited 45 minutes only because I let them know. Last time I ordered a pizza to have it delivered, the pizza looked like   vomit."}
{"text":"The Food is GREAT! But they are super expensive and the delivery is the worst ever! We have ordered from them several times. We gave the delivery 3 chances and will never order delivery from them again. We only live 1 1/2 miles from there and it still takes them and hour and a half to get our food to us. At the prices they charge you would think they would offer better service. And whatever you do don't complain because the service just gets worse once they know it was you who complained!

The Calzones and Stromboli are excellent!  As long as you don't want fast delivery this place has great food!"}
{"text":"Like everyone says..it's a hit or miss. The pizza is okay, nothing special but I mainly go for the chicken fingers.  The menu is overpriced in my opinion and on several occasions they seem to be stingy when asking for extra ranch. Some days are good and I get the nice Russian chick taking my order but the others are rude. I stopped going there for awhile because the environment was uncomfortable but came back every now and then for the fingers and fries. That's it. Nothing else"}
{"text":"Horrible..poor service ongoing, is a shame Putters gets the brunt of this crowd.its always something. ..I give em 5 as that will boost the show..management doesn't return calls and there are too many places to give it another try. Fail on service and attitude. .."}
{"text":"Delivery takes forever, Sarah hung up on me 2 times and then screamed at me to hold on!!!! Delivery drivers deliver wrong orders and food is either raw, overcooked, or just cold!! Spoke to the \"manager\" Yuri and she was no help!! Food and service used to be really good :("}
{"text":"Go here often. Was there just a couple of days ago. Had family from New York here for Christmas. Spent just over $150 and everything was great as always. They loved the pizza. Thank you for your great service April decker"}
{"text":"Just done with this place. Every single delivery order has been wrong or lacking items. Delivery time quoted as 45min has turned in to an hour and a half at times. This time was the last time, called in to let them know what they forgot and STILL brought the wrong itemS back. Unfortunately we let this go on way too long hoping that it was going to get better or resolve itself while it only became worse. Don't bother with this place, food was good but service has took a steaming dump on what was once great food. So long incompetence, you will not be seeing any more business from us or recommendations to friends and family. Just need zero stars."}
{"text":"Had the double cheeseburger.   Very good considering it's a Italian food joint.  A good place to try if in the area."}
{"text":"This pizza is great... best pizza. I don't like eating the crust most the time but the crust on there pizza is better than most place whole pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza was lacking. The sauce had no taste. The chicken wings are good. But not so much with warm ranch."}
{"text":"I hardly ever write reviews but this pizza is terrible! I waited over 90 minutes for overpriced delivery/pizza. Super greasy."}
{"text":"This is our favorite pizza place that we've found in town so far. The pick-up specials are great prices. I love when I can feed my family dinner for about $12. 

Eatng in can get a expensive and I have to say that I don't love the servers. If they smile it feels like you hit the jackpot or something. But it's so convenient and the pizza is sooooo good we still meet family here for weekend dinners sometimes.They do have a nice room a little seperate from the main dining room that is nice when we have a big group with lots of noisy kids.

Other than the pizza, we've tried the cheese sticks, the chicken ranch wrap, and of course the beer. All have had good reviews. This location and the location on Eastern & Tropicana-ish are both our regular spots."}
{"text":"Good food nd affordable. I have only done delivery orders so i cant say much on staff bt the food is always good. Love there wings nd pizza. Only had one bad experience when they took almost 2 hours to deliver my food bt not much more to say other than that."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza spot in East Las Vegas. Reasonable prices and quality food. I'd recommend their family specials, and lunch specials available during the week. I've had their wings, pizzas, and sandwiches and are amazing. The service is really good as well and relaxed. I'd suggest dine-in or pick-up."}
{"text":"They always put customers on hold for long period of time and sometimes hang up on you. On top of that they get your order wrong. I am a frequent customer and keep receiving poor service. You guys could do way better."}
{"text":"This place really sucks bad' you want cold gross food that takes 2 hours then order from here.  Or hey maybe one night they will just start banging on your door at 9pm delivering for a person that hasnt lived at that address for 4 years! But still had the same phone number except the company didnt verify before they sent out for delivery.  Overall 3 horrid food delivery experiences then they offer 20% off next order lolololohahah yeah right.  Next order?
 I cant believe my wife even ordered from this place."}
{"text":"I got off work at 11pm and I was feeling hungry. I have had Angelinas before and love the cheese pizza, garlic knots and the fryer mushrooms. I have recently moved and there is an Angelinas right across the street from where I live so I decided to stop there tonight. Just let me say WOW !!! I went to the door the sign said OPEN, and it also said to ring hell if locked. There was a female working and she was on the phone. I rang the bell and she just looked at me so I rang the bell again still nothing so I rang it a third time.... This time she put her hand up like to say stop ringing the bell. Needless to say she never opened the door or hung up the phone. I guess her conversation was more important that customer service !!! You can bet I will NEVER eat there ! I will drive across town to a different Angelinas to eat."}
{"text":"REALLY bad customer service, food is good, they take forever on delivery and the girls answering the phones do not know what they are doing and rude on top of that. Never eating here again"}
{"text":"Yelp page lies. Restaurant is NOT open 24/7. Closes at 1am during the week and 2am on the weekends."}
{"text":"I'm writing a review for the bar more so than the pizzeria. Love the bar namely for the bartenders. Great food and deals. Nice spot to make your usual hangout. Chill atmosphere."}
{"text":"Years later, service still sucks. 3 cashiers up front and theyre still unorganized. Having trouble looking for orders. Giving people the wrong food. I ordered ahead and still had to wait. Ugh."}
{"text":"The food has always been good but don't ever expect good service. Half the time we're ignored or just given attitude,  I don't think I've been here once where the people were actually nice and friendly."}
{"text":"This place used to do so well with my orders. Recently, they've completely forgotten about my order, didn't bring my entire order that I paid for nor did they compensate me, and finally they take well over an hour and thirty minutes for delivery. Don't come here, you'll starve to death before your order is delivered."}
{"text":"Angelina's is great. Good pizza, wings, garlic balls, and fires. I always order for pick up because delivery can and does take a long time."}
{"text":"The food is really hit and miss. Sometimes it's great and others it only edible at best.  Most of the issues stem from delivery problems.  Most times it takes about 10-20 minutes past the extended delivery time. I live less than a mile from the restaurant so I am. It sure how a simple order can take more than two hours.  Tonight was the last straw, I kept checking updates and it said everything was \"on time\" yet it was still in the cooking stage 20+ minutes after deliver window of 90 minutes.  After almost 20 minutes on hold with the Eat24 app they were able to get through and somehow the order was never received despite the updates on the app.  They really need to get it together over there. It is also common for them to. It read the special instructions noted on the order, simple instructions like: no lettuce, no ketchup. When the food is sent quickly it's usually very good, too bad the delivery, poor attention to orders, and customer service ruin it."}
{"text":"Fair - but cheap!  $5.99 lunch special was good, qualizty lcked."}
{"text":"I love this location!!!  Our favorite waitress is Lilly, and they have the best pizza and wings in town."}
{"text":"What a rip off. I order from this place all the time and usually love the place. But i just tried calling and they said $5.00 delivery fee. Are you kidding me? in this economy when everyone else chages $1.50-$2.00, they have the balls to charge me $5.00. Hell I only live 2 blocks from their store. And the girl who answered the phone was rude as hell. I work concierge at 2 Different hotels and usually refer business to this small chain, but never again."}
{"text":"The most horrible experience I have ever had EVER. So I order a pizza with pepperoni and artichokes and the lady says it will take about an hour. I said ok, she took all my info including my address and cross streets. After an hour and a half of waiting I call them back, wondering is the driver got lost or whatever. No, she assured me he was on his way and they just got a little behind. Ok, no prob. Two hours later my pizza is delivered. The guy says to me as I open the door that I called the wrong angelinas and that there was a closer one to me. I said \"oh\" bc the lady who I ordered from said nothing about that. Then he proceeded to tell me that he was late bc it took him \"forever\" to find this place since its \"so out of the way\". What. The. Eff. 

I took my pizza and hoped that despite waiting 2 hours and listening to someone tell me I'm an idiot for ordering from the wrong pizza place, I thought that the food would make up for it. No. Horrible. Cold, not melted cheese. With a total of 10 slices (I counted since I was pissed) and a few artichoke heartsthrown onto this large pizza I became irate. 

This was seriously the worst pizza I've ever had with the worst service. I'll never ever ever (ever!) go here again and neither should you.  Oh and it was $22 for a crappy pizza. Lame."}
{"text":"Ordered for pickup. They said it would be 25-30 min. Arrived at the store 30 min later and ended up waiting there another 30 min for the food."}
{"text":"Pizza was pretty good. Service was okay. Ordered pizzas for pickup and had to wait a bit once we got there and the place wasn't really that busy. Also bought a $5 cannoli that wasn't that great and didn't seem fresh. Not sure about the other food, but I'd probably give it a try since the pizza wasn't terrible. I do wish they sold by the slice as well as full pies."}
{"text":"So its been an hour and 30mins and just got a phone call trying to verify my address, im guessing the drivers lost. Not sure how you have delivery drivers who cant deliver to your address. Last time I order from here. Really Disappointed

UPDATE: FOOD CAME AT 1hour 40mins and food was cold. Thanks for making me burn $25."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town. Great wings. Pick up special is the best deal if you can pick it up. Lasagna is superb."}
{"text":"I was really craving some pasta so I came to the closest place there is that serves pasta aka Angelina's. I just ordered the shrimp scampi and the large criss cut fries. 

1. It took forever for the food to come out! 30-40 minutes for just 2 items and I was doing take out!
2. They didn't even bother telling me along the way if my food was close to done or not. They said it would only take about 20 minutes but it actually came close to 40 minutes overall for the food to actually get to me.
3. When I tried the shrimp scampi, it didn't go to the expectations that I had been hoping for. It actually sucked to be honest. The shrimp scampi tastes like literally just noodles soaked oil. There is no flavor whatsoever. I was really disappointed. I had tried the fettuccine alfredo the last time that I had come here and it wasn't that great either. The alfredo sauce was really loose and not that creamy. The criss cut fries were the only things that were actually decent, however, the fries are super hard and considering I have braces, I felt like it broke as couple brackets of mine when I was chewing on it.

I'm not sure if I will come here again considering if it had disappointed me for the second time."}
{"text":"I totally forgot how horrible the food from this place is.... my boyfriend did an order of 2 Phillly 1 order of wings and 1 order of plain garlic bread. Waiting time 1 hr for delivery, the cheese from the Philly tasted it horrible like old cheese the french fries were cold and old the wings were cold with a bad smell and my plain garlic bread came with cheese melted on top.... I call for complain the guy that answer asked me if I wanted to get a new order of garlic bread and french fries I told him that if they were gonna make their customers to wait 1 hr for delivery make sure the food gets warm and fresh he said he would give me 20 percent discount on my next order and he hanged up. After this bad experience  (2nd time bad experience ) I'm definitely not going back to this a place. I'm pretty sure if I call dirty dining this place would get a gad grade."}
{"text":"Great food & pizza!  Come here at least once a week.  Great service.  Garlic balls are the bomb!"}
{"text":"We ordered take out tonight and I was completely ticked off.  First, we ordered criss cut fries and both received regular.  But the worst thing was I had ordered the Tuna Sub, \"made with albacore tuna\".  Not so.  The tuna in my sandwich was a grayish color - albacore is white, so it was either 'chunk light' or bad.  I didn't eat it because it certainly didn't taste like albacore.  I feel I was lied to and will never eat here again.  What a waste of money."}
{"text":"Not bad, the wings are pretty good especially as far as late night pizza goes.
Quick delivery and friendly.
 Would of gave it 4 stars but the pizza could use some work in the flavor zone, and gets a bit soggy not terrible by any means. 
I will for sure order from them again."}
{"text":"i tried the burger this time , it was disgusting !!!! 
the burger patty wasn't even meat it tasted so fake & had a nasty texture .
everything else i've gotten has been good ."}
{"text":"Pizza is overpriced for what you get. Got a simple pepperoni pizza and it's not even good. Cheese was miniscule and the pepperoni was razor thin slices. Little Caesars is 5 star pizza compared to this. Only reason I ordered was because it's one of the only pizza places open super late, only thing they got going. Will try other food, but pizza and cheese bread was not impressive. Lacking flavor for a $15 one topping pizza."}
{"text":"The worst ever...... I had a craving for some great pizza and a light bulb went off about this great place I ate at a couple of years ago..... and boy has time change these people sent me a nasty  burnt taste like frozen pizza from Smith's the pizza had these mini pepperoni.....  this was the worst and the nastiest pizza I've ever encounter ...... poor quality cheap tasting yuckkkkkk I asked the manager why the pepperoni looked like mini ones she says because the oil cause them to shrink..... smh then I was like well what's your excuse for it being burnt!! Ahhh Duhhhh .... is what I got smh someone need a new JoB and it's not in the kitchen"}
{"text":"Delivery is very long my order came through at 3:35pm and finally got it at 4:52pm so expect a wait.
When I called to ask about it's delivery status the lady that picked up told me that they don't get orders from yelp but started to list a variety of places. A moment of panic ensued in thinking well where the hell did my order go through. I would think the first question to ask after someone calls for a delivery status was to ask name and address instead of going through emails to figure out it was with eatstreet. Then tells me that she doesn't have any eatstreet orders so it must be on it's way already. I asked is she could look me up to confirm and finds me she tells me they have my order and on the way. She doesn't give an eta. Lack of stars was for that crappy customer service.
Ordered the tiramisu and it is a bad version of one. It doesn't even have the flavor of tiramisu. It's tastes watery. I kept hoping additional bites may taste better the more I get towards the middle. I've had better and dessert was a disappointment. The Greek pizza was good however I didn't think I'd have a layer of olive oil under the entire pizza. The onion rings were ok they were greasy and not as crispy but that may have been from the drive time? The dip for it was the only thing I can say was amazing used it for my pizza."}
{"text":"Delivery is fast. I order the triple decker turkey sandwich, the bacon was still warm when I got it. I also order Cannoli's, best ever!"}
{"text":"This place never messes up my order and the ladies are very nice. Even delivery guy is on point. You guys needa chill."}
{"text":"Friday march 6th was a no meat during lent for my family we decided to try the vegetarian pizza i must say it did not meet my expectations i was very disappointed! It was cold didnt have the veggies that i liked and the flavor wasnt there! We also ordered mozzarella sticks, zucchini sticks and calamari rings once again disappointed with the calamari very rubbery and cold the zuchinni sticks did not have flavor the only thing that was some what edible was the mozzarella sticks. 

As for the service it was worse than the food! They were so rude you walk in they dont even acknowledge that you are there, i walked in to pick up my food i was the only person waiting another lady comes into the restaurant and gets helped first how is that correct!  Definitely not ever going back. As for pizza ill continue going to little Caesars seems like theyre so much better! Dont waste your money at angelinas! Super disappointed!"}
{"text":"this place is usually on point but tonight it shouldn't take a hour and a half for my order to get to me..will still eat and order here but tonight i was truly disappointed"}
{"text":"I am sooo disappointed inAngelina's they use to be our favorite pizza and wings place, been going to them for quite a long time as a matter of fact when they started out just a whole in the wall. I have always recommended them to everyone! There food has went down hill... do not buy there pepperoni pizza is a joke! They have pepperonis now the size of a nickel and nasty in taste! I must say they lost my business after all these years! I"}
{"text":"Pizza arrived more than an hour after ordering, cold and nasty. Do not recommend, definitely not worth $50."}
{"text":"I technically didn't eat here, rather I ordered through GrubHub. I picked the Pasta Fagiole and Caprese Salad. Coming from an Italian family on the East Coast, I have high standards when it comes to Italian staples. While it does seem like there is something missing (more black pepper? Oregano? not sure), the Pasta Fagiole was incredible otherwise. Perhaps it was the creaming was of the broth that reminded me of Manhattan Clam Chowder (also love.)

The Caprese salad was large and well, was more of a salad-salad than what I was expecting. Usually, a Caprese salad is a slice of mozzarella, a thick slice of tomato (no seeds), and a basil leaf. I didn't want an Italian style garden salad but that's what I got. Probably won't order this again."}
{"text":"I'm glad I waited to write this review because of the inconsistency of this place. I've been there and wanted to give them 5 stars and then felt the complete opposite on other visits. The service is usually decent, good if you get the cute Russian chick with the accent- she's always on point.  I've had better experiences with their dine in over their delivery. And as many have said, it's true, the pizza is just so-so. 
A couple of my choice options are as followed: The Diablo pasta. With or without added chicken or sausage this dish is by far my favorite. It's linguini with a spicy red sauce with chunks of all types of onions and peppers. It's not for the people who order mild wings. This dish (if done right) usually has me sweating and downing the nearest liquid. Now I say if done right because again I must stress the inconstancy. I've had it unbearable hot, and then I've had it where I'm wondering if I ordered the right dish. 
Another plus on this menu is the salads. I enjoy them. Greek or buffalo chicken to be exact. Good dressings and ingredients. My last fav is the cheese fries add jalapeño. This channels my inner fat kid and I find myself getting full sometimes after I realized I ate an entire order before a meal. 
I'd pass on their Alfredo, it's not bad just I've had and made better. Also I prefer their hot subs over the cold. As much as I want to be mad at this place when they screw up, I continuously find myself coming back. Again, and again. 

PS there's always cops here."}
{"text":"Perfect for when it's your only day off and you don't feel like cooking. Ordered for delivery and came fairly quick. About 20 mins before my estimated time.

I went with a custom mini pizza and garlic Parmesan wings and fries. When I got the food it was still steaming hot. A+. Took a bite of my pizza and I wasn't expecting it to be soggy like the other times I've been there or ordered food. But nope. That sucker was cooked to perfection. The garlic Parmesan wings packed hella flavor but it was hella greasy. Still good. But still hella greasy lol. Fries were alright. Again, hella greasy. Like soggy greasy. But it tasted good. Whatever not a huge complainer cause my stomach is full and I'm about to fall into the deepest food coma.

I'll run off everything I ate tomorrow. Peace.

P.S.-there is a delivery charge, but tip the drivers anyways"}
{"text":"Loved the hot chicken strips and fries! We got a pepperoni and jalapeño pizza, the cheese slid right off which was pretty annoying. Overall had a pleasant visit."}
{"text":"The Charleston store is several times better than the nut job store on S. Eastern.  They need to rid themselves on the tall \"well nourished New Yorker\" who talks way too much and is kind of scary. I think she said her name was Julia.  Bad news and bad for business."}
{"text":"We order from here a lot we own a business close by that has table space for people to hangout and chill so they order from this place a lot as well. There delivery takes and hr and a half normal to get here we are 6 minutes away. But today they took 2hr 17 minutes to bring us 25 chicken tenders and some fries it was the worst food I have eaten in a long time and on top of that we asked for some extra BBQ sauce and they forgot to bring it. We will no longer tell people that play at our store about this spot nor will we order from here again"}
{"text":"We ordered because it was the closest wing and pizza place that delivered.  We experienced: Quick delivery, good food.  Would Definitely order a again! 
We had pizza, wings and fries."}
{"text":"i love Angelina's it is the best place to eat my family and friends love the pizza and the service is great the food is fast and hot we all love Philly subs that's why we keep coming back great job and thank u"}
{"text":"The pizza is ok, greasy but ok. Employees ain't so friendly, my opinion if you don't like your job go back to school and do something with your life! Never again"}
{"text":"We've been frequents of this Angelina's location for about three years now. They've always provided excellent food and excellent service! Their ingredients are always fresh (you can tell!) and that's something you just can't get from Little Caesars or Pizza Hut.
On the East side at least, this is the best place to go for pizza. I can't speak for eating in, but every time we've ordered food or picked up from this location, our order was hot and ready to go! We order out usually about once a week (pizza is a staple for my family when my dad goes on business trips) and the food has always made it to our home within the 45 minute-1 hour window given by the restaurant. Our usual go-to is two orders of garlic balls (FYI those things are sinfully delicious) and a large vegetarian pizza with pineapple, basil, onions, spinach and jalapeños. We almost always have food left over, so whatever we've got left we just throw in the freezer- everything freezes extremely well and is just as delicious later as it is the first time around. We will continue to frequent this location so long as it continues to live up to the amazing standard it has set for the last three years. You guys have some pretty loyal customers on your hands! :)


Update: The cannoli's are absolutely delicious! You can definitely tell that they're homemade. I'd highly recommend them for anyone who likes desserts. They are best when picked up though- if they're delivered, normally the inside is a little runny because they've been near heat for too long. It doesn't change the flavor, just the texture!"}
{"text":"They need to train their waitresses on how to wait & serve on guests... This is the second time I've been here & both times I've had a different waitress but the same issues...I have to ask them for everything from the eating utensils,  sugar for my tea, for the to go box & for the check. After waiting & waiting I have to get up & go to the counter to ask for a to go box & my check  because they don't bother to come over & check on you or ask if you need anything. I spent at least 1/2 hr. more there then need be waiting to be offered a to go box, my chevk & to come pick up the check themselves but NO I have to do it myself (neither times had it been busy). Last time I reluctantly tipped & this time for the first time ever did I not tip someone...I will no longer tip someone for intentionally bad service...There was no reason for us to get the service we did (either times). PS...I'm a waitress myself."}
{"text":"Tonight my boyfriend and I ordered pizza from this location. After we placed the first order, they cancelled it via text. Thinking it was a mistake, we tried to order it a second time. After that the restaurant called us and told us that they don't deliver to our location (even though we are less than a mile from their location). Upon my boyfriend calling to ask about the cancelled order the employee of the business said \"we don't deliver to your location.\" After we told them we ordered from GrubHub they then said \"Go ahead and try to get us taken off of GrubHub\". CAN WE TALK ABOUT HOW THIS IS AN INAPPROPRIATE RESPONSE????? GrubHub is a great company but Angelina's is not. I DO NOT ever recommend ordering from them. 

If I could put a negative star rating for this location I definitely would."}
{"text":"They were ready on time and the order was correct! So much better than pizza hut and its 24/7!!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband loves their pizza, I'm more of a chicken fingers kind of person.  Hit and miss, I ordered medium, could not eat them they were so spicy.  Ordered at 6:50 p.m., arrived at 8:15 p.m. on a Tuesday night.  It's always interesting to see when they arrive; however, my husband loves the pizza, so we wait.  I have no real serious complaints, just know it will usually take longer to arrive and if you veer from the pizza, it may be a challenge to eat.  : )"}
{"text":"When your paper menu has a picture of a club on bread I kinda expect it to at least be on bread not a bun. Then they give you barely any fries and serious the tomato is lottery the very end of the tomato. How cheap can you be? I won't be ordering from here any more."}
{"text":"So, we've been back Angelina's a few times since my last review. They've definitely made efforts to increase their service levels, and ordering by phone hasn't been an issue since then. We aren't going anywhere.

Food is always good, if the tall, dark hair manager is there, she always recognizes us and when she's there, our service is great. If she's not there, service hovers below average."}
{"text":"I feel like every time I order here the pizza always taste different. Sometimes it's good and cheesy and sometimes it taste completely different! Not sure if they have different cooks all the time and if they were all trained different. It's a hit and miss with this place! And somehow I still coming back. It's convenience since I live right down the st. Place seems to stay packed and I have better luck dinning in. Customer services is legit and they serve beer (when I really need it) family friendly place and I love to order there gigantic pizzas! Good for small get togethers."}
{"text":"Avoid the chicken wings, overcooked and dry. The tables were mostly dirty and the service was lackluster. Would not return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"They should close the doors.  No one looks like they want to be there.  Why does it take 1 hr for my Pizza to come out when I'm the only customer? Terrible."}
{"text":"The food used to be good.  Quality has really diminished over the last four years. Pizza was soggylike. Chicken fingers were below average. When people take pride in their work it shows. When food is made with a great attitude it carries through.  So sad for Angelina's - east location.  We have been  looking for a different restaurant that sells this kind of food in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Food is okay. Service was egh, I find it rude to go to a table while the server is chewing her gum away. Not welcoming"}
{"text":"The food is terrific, but the service....not so much. They have to get beer from the bar next door. Would be much better if they had more tvs and more of a locals sports theme vibe to it."}
{"text":"Pretty decent grub over here, especially onna late night they'll do...I kinda prefer the location over on Decatur & Russell but solid spot nevertheless"}
{"text":"Tired it for the first time today. Oh damn taste so good make you wanna slap yo mama. By far the best! And i mean best pizza and wings I've tasted since I've been alive lol"}
{"text":"I ordered a BBQ chicken pizza from this place two years ago. When it arrived, it looked disgusting (pale, soggy, covered in mounds of shaved red onions, etc).  I gave it a whirl anyway, because really, how can you fuck up a BBQ chicken pizza?  I made it through one bite, peeled off the onions, and fed it to my dogs. Absolutely vile. It took an hour and a half to arrive; and $20 later, I opted to eat a dinner of toast and jam. This place should be ashamed. Haven't been back in two years."}
{"text":"My husband and I has been ordering from here for years. I even got my mom to go there a couple of time . I never have many problems here and if I do the manager and staff take care of it right away my family and I normally get it delivered to our house which doesn't take any more than an hour. We love the food and the pricing is fair."}
{"text":"Great place, Not horrible, also not fantastic. Gets the job done if you're hungry and wanting something that's quick and convenient. I wouldn't go out of my way, but if you live nearby it's not a bad option.

I can't comment on delivery since we went there to pick up our pizza. We didn't have to wait long, and the service was friendly. But very unattended to our table. Did not finish taking the order when she left to help another table. Again, just nothing here that was especially outstanding or memorable."}
{"text":"I love Angelina's pizza. The pastas are pretty good but the pizza is what really stands out here. The prices are reasonable as well. Only thing I would change is the servers/cashiers. Not too friendly in my opinion and kinda come off as the \"we-don't-really-care\" type. If it wasn't for the service, Angelina's would definitely got the 5-star treatment from me.  The $8.99 pick up special which includes a 16 inch one topping pizza is my type of deal.  Killer pizza always keeps me coming back!"}
{"text":"The lasagna is the best I have had here in Las Vegas besides my own home bake lasagna. Delivery takes a little while but well worth the wait, comes with salad and garlic bread. Better be hungry each meal is quite large...;-)"}
{"text":"This is the absolute worst place to ever get anything from. We come here all the time and seems like the service gets worse and worse. They act like they don't need your Buissiness. And trust me they are slow and don't care. Stuck up and the food definitely is t that great."}
{"text":"I spent a lot of money over the past few weeks ordering from this place. I ordered from them because they are a member of eat24hours.com and accept paypal which is something I need...Anyways their pizza is average, their appetizers are hit and miss. Some times they taste stale. The garlic balls are good. THE MAIN REASON THEY GET 1 STAR is that I've never had a major issue with a delivery until today. Normally it takes them 60-90 minutes to deliver when I'm told 45-60 minutes. Today I ordered food at 1:18pm and at 2:20 the food still isn't here. I find out what's up and the delivery driver hasn't left yet... then at 2:45 I ask why it still isn't here and he says he rang the doorbell and nobody answered... LIES. They are average, and overpriced and I was spending a lot of money weekly with them just for the convienance. NOT ANYMORE. They don't value delivery orders or their customers.  Save your money and go someplace worth the extra money because this place is not."}
{"text":"This place use to be a great group place but has drastically fell off throughout the years. Customer service, food quality, pretty much everything. This place could def use some remodeling and revamping the staff."}
{"text":"This place has the BEST Buffalo wings , they are jumbo and only $26.99 for 40 wings, used to get wings at Napoli pizza, until they raised their price for 40 wings to $51.99, those greedy bastards ! , that $1.30 a wing , and they aren't jumbo wings , do your wallet favor and go to Angelina's , their Stromboli and pizzas are great also"}
{"text":"If you're coming here, it's not for the customer service. The pizza itself is delicious, but the long wait times and rude employees are what makes this place a turn off. The best things on the menu are the chicken fingers and the white pizza. I get either of these every time I come. Delicious! I wish this place had better customer service but the pizza itself is so good that I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"Food is great ... Good customer setvice Delivery could take some time so pick up is better .."}
{"text":"Poor service. Overpriced. Delivery was extremely late. Would not order from this place again if they paid me"}
{"text":"I don't know why I keep coming here. The service is not good and their food isn't good. And they aren't even busy! 

I've been here about 6 times. Mostly take out and one dine in occasion.

I've never had one of those experiences where I notice someone order AFTER me and still get their food first. Until here! 

I remember that occasion. We ordered a pizza, and two appetizers. Our pizza came out literally 45 minutes after ordering it, they bring the one appetizer another 5 minutes later, and then the second appetizer just about the hour mark. One of those that's it I'm leaving moments but I stuck it out. We were in there when there were maybe 2 other small parties were there so I just didn't understand. They had a lot of workers but we maybe got one refill when we asked after we ate. 

There was never a \"sorry out kitchens baked up\" or even a just plain \"sorry it's taking so long\". That tells me they don't see a problem.

How hard is it to fry up some garlic balls to bring out as an appetizer? How about wings? That should have come out first to freaking offset the pizza wait! Restaurant and service 101!

Our entire meal took almost an hour and a half. 

Granted the take out line started getting busy we still ordered way before it got busy.

Then tonight I went and took a take out order and our crust was burnt on our pizza. 

Sorry but that was the last straw. I just can't see myself eating here again.

Yes their garlic balls are good and cheap but I'll go elsewhere at all costs. 

Their ordering sucks. You call and automatically get placed on hold. WHY?! I was in there and both girls did that. WHY?! They weren't even doing anything that couldn't wait!

Also the staff sucks.

Customer service and personality go along way. I don't see how that girl works there. She must be related or own the place. Dark hairs girl that is a little pale. Sorry to put her out there but she just sucks. One time she gave me a free ranch with my order but I left a tip larger than the cost of the ranch so that doesn't make up for it. 

There's no appreciation of the customer. I'd rather eat where they have good service and good food as opposed to bad service and great food. 

They don't give a good name to local businesses and I'd much rather eat at a big corporate chain as opposed to this place."}
{"text":"I ordered through eat 24. This was by far worst experience. My food arrival was passed 90 minutes. I ordered chicken fingers (hot) & fries. My food was Dry & cold. My order was placed at 7:40pm I received it at 9:41 pm. I will never order from here again."}
{"text":"Horrible! Wrong order received after strict instructions i wanted a BBQ chicken pizza they sent a spicy jalapeño pizza to me and told me 2 hours to send my correct order after sending the bad one back to them. After one slice of the wrong order my girl vomited and was sick the whole night DO NOT EAT HERE this place is disgusting the other food that did come was gross and soggy! 0 stars . Pitiful manager Keith is rude and doesn't help in any way if there is a problem. I am calling the board of health in the morning let's start the year off with a fresh inspection of this disgusting food. Trying to include photos of what it REALLY LOOKS LIKE not the fake menu photos ."}
{"text":"I love Angelina's.  Their pizza is great.   Good thin crust with a nice crispy edge.  A ton of sauce and cheese.  Excellent toppings.  I've had their sandwiches a couple of times too.  Pretty good.  I've had better.  They are filling though.  What I love most is the build your own stromboli.  You get your choice of three toppings.  I always order the small and it is enough for at least two meals.  It comes out buttery and garlic-y with parmasean cheese dusting the top.  You get a cup of sauce for dipping.  It is good sauce but never quite enough.  I like to order the 'boli with spinach, mushroom and artichoke.  Or sometimes pepperoni, olive and mushroom.  Really any three toppings you want are a good choice.  An amazing stromboli.

I have never ordered for delivery so I cannot speak of the complaints of taking too long.  I can tell you it does take usually 20-30 minutes when you order in house.  It is worth the wait though.  And most locations are connected to a bar.  Pop in after ordering, have a beer and enjoy your food and evening."}
{"text":"When I first tried Angelinas a few years back I was so impressed and I would try a new dish or pizza each time. I'm not sure if they changed owners or management but the quality and taste of the food, staff, and even wait time is just awful. 
Even though I knew the food started to taste pretty bad I kept going back here and there thinking it was just a fluke. Well, big mistake on my part because I do not enjoy heart burn or feeling sick immediately after eating. 
My last and final experience I decided to order a pepperoni, sausage, and extra cheese pizza for take out. They told me it would take an hour so I took my time driving assuming the place would be packed. When I got inside it was empty and the lady at the counter never acknowledged me but instead kept talking on the phone until I finally said something. I'm pretty sure that pissed her off because she abruptly ended her phone call and practically shot laser beams at me with her eyes lol...
I gave her my name and paid and she went back to get it. She didn't come back out for another 5min maybe longer. Finally got my food and headed home. I really wished I would have opened the pizza box before I left because I would have given it back. First off, I had grease that seeped from the pizza thru the box and got all over my car seat. Not happy about that! And then when I checked the pizza it was hardly cooked and you could still pull the dough apart. What gets me was all the grease...it was covered in pools of dripping nasty grease. Where the hell did all that come from? Threw it away and didn't even bother trying to call for another one or to get my money back because I didn't really want to deal with the lady again. 
I really hope the owners read some of these reviews. It used to be a delicious place to eat but after my last experience I will not be back nor recommend it."}
{"text":"We ordered from here the first night we got to Vegas, and then delivered within an hour to our hotel. We ordered garlic balls, a small stromboli and a small pizza.

The garlic balls were awesome, we've never had those before, if my husband could have just ate those the entire trip I think he might have.

The small stromboli could have fed 3 or 4 people, so it lasted for 3 meals for me, and it was way yummy with the pizza sauce to dip it in.

The small pizza was huge and lasted my husband about 3 meals too.

We are definately going to order from here on our next trip to Vegas for a nice quiet night recovering."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!!!  Normally I order the Supreme Pizza and it's to die for. Definitely a FAVORITE in my book."}
{"text":"The pizzas taste great. The prices are a little high. I can't comment on the rest of the menu; I only ever order pizza. Delivery can be hit-or-miss and tends to take a while (long enough that you start thinking maybe they got lost) so I tend to pick up instead. That way I get fresh, hot pizza that hasn't been sloshing around in the back of someone's car while they drive in circles.

If the staff make a mistake (and it happens from time to time) they tend to get surly rather than just fix the problem. 

And now, some unsolicited advice: if you need to reheat pizza, use your oven or a frying pan over low-medium heat, partially covered. Never ever microwave unless you enjoy eating soggy garbage."}
{"text":"This is the most inconsistent food I've ever seen in my life I can't do it I keep getting disappointed ordering from this place I will not do it again"}
{"text":"Food was good, kinda expensive, I thought. I went there and ordered for take out. Service was OK. didn't impress me none.. I might go back, but note for a long time..."}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER DELIVERY FROM THIS PLACE !!!!....My delevery took twice as long as they quoted me, the food was cold. I called back and they told me they could get a new order out to me in another 45 minutes..ya right, 45 minutes, I live 5-10 minutes away. I asked for the manager and was told there was no manager on duty and to call back tomorrow. What place does not have a Manager on duty? I have been in the restaurant business for 22 years, having managed most of those. There is always supposed to be a Manager on duty. DO NOT ORDER DELIVERY FROM THIS PLACE !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Manicotti was good. My husband and kids ate the Angelina's specialty pizza with the mushrooms and meats bell peppers etc.. They liked it. I ordered online and was satisfied because it was super easy. I even had a special request which was met. Thanks. There is a disclaimer when ordering online that says they try to deliver within 30 minutes but it's possible it could take longer. It's all good, just sucks that our food took an hour to get to us."}
{"text":"do not ever ever order from this business, we had been ordering from here for over three months. we only had a problem once with hardly any toppings on the pizza, so we called and they sent out a new pizza and took the old one back. the second pizza was fine and i thought this was all over with. boy did i get a shock tonight when i placed a order for pizza and wings. they told order-24 a bunch of lies, they said we always sent food back and that our dogs were a problem. we have very small dogs the biggest one is around 6 pounds. i would never ever order from angelina's pizza again and if i were you i would not order from them.  one thing i can't stand is when someone lies to me straight to my face. i would warn anyone not to order from angelina's if they can lie straight to your face and make up stories about sending food back who know's what they are doing to the food before they bring it to you. i am going to channel 13 and post a complaint with them to warn other people not to order from them. i see now why they only got three stars, so save your self some time and order from someone else. your better off going to the grocery store and buy a frozen pizza and wings and make them yourself."}
{"text":"I love their chicken cheesesteaks but unfortunately they gave me two overdone Philly cheesesteaks. My husband ate his as he was starving and I ate half. Tried calling numerous times but was put on hold for 7 mins each time. When I finally got through the gentleman was not very apologetic and said nothing could be done. Not sure if there will be a next time. To many places to eat in vegas."}

{"text":"I order the 8 peice wings and large fries from here almost every weekend and I love them. the delivery is actually pretty quick they usually arrive within 45 min. these guys have  good food and very well priced definitely happy with angelinas pizza"}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice now both time with my boyfriend . The first time I went it was lunch time two ladys where there at the time the ladys where rude had a nasty addituted. Their customer service bottom line just sucked . Decided to go again tonight maybe give the place another chance, I regret it . We got there we sat down we must of waited 15mins before we got a menu all the employees were  on there phones . The guy brought us our drinks we placed out order they brought us our food. We never once got asked if we wanted a refill or if we needed anything else . Overall I'm very upset with this place . I don't see myself ever going back !"}
{"text":"This is an edible pizza that was big on size but lacked cheese and toppings. We were impressed by the size of the box and the crust was of decent quality. Maybe ordering a cheese and my own topping might make this work better."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here a lot back when I used to work swing shift because they are open late. Their pizza is decent, but they have very good burgers and sandwiches, which is the main reason we come here.

I've had their pizza a few times, and each time I've been happy with it. It's not great pizza, but it's not bad either. There aren't very many good pizza places nearby, and this is one of the few places that stays open late.

They have a very good Philly cheesesteak, probably the best in the area. My wife gets this every time we are here and has always  loved it. It's always juicy, well seasoned and cheesy. It seems like a lot of places have trouble making a good Philly but Angelina's is not one of them. Their ranch jalapeño burger is also fantastic, and is the best burger I've ever had from a pizza place.

Their fries are seasoned and very good. They also have very good garlic dough balls which are greasy in that good way. You know they are bad for you but can't stop eating them.

I've never had them deliver so I can't comment on that. I usually order to go and wait at the Putters bar next door. I typically wait about 20 minutes, which isn't too bad. Their prices are also pretty average.

If your in the area and want a good sandwich or burger, or maybe it's late at night and you want pizza, then stop by here and you shouldn't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I'll have to agree with most of the comments.. It's a hit or miss. The first time I ate here I was thrilled to finally have a good sit down pizzeria close to home. Pizza was delicious BUT service SUCKED. I decided to give it a second chance but after the second time I won't be back. Pizza was not as good as the first time and service was still the same. Oh well, no Angelina's for me!"}
{"text":"The food experience was well done. I got my food in a good time span and my order was made to perfection, I was given my receipt, napkins, ketchup packets, utensils, and of course the food (I ordered a personal pizza and cheese fries).

Let me start off with the cheese fries because I ate those first. The fries are excellent, they give off a real taste of a potato unlike other restaurants. The seasonings are all there and the cheese was a good addition. One thing to know is that the cheese can get solid fast and it's a little thick but overall the cheese fries are great.

Now the personal pizza is good and I liked the flavors made present especially the crust. The crust is crispy and the toppings were delicious but I do have to say that the pizza needed more sauce. No doubt the pizza was juicy and had a crisp bite but the sauce needs improving. For a pizza that size needs to be at par with the regular sizes of their pizza. 

All in all I had a good food experience and I would like to order again from this place."}
{"text":"I went there with my family.  We ordered Pepperoni pizza, Garlic balls, wings and a Antipasto Salad.  The pizza is okay.  Its a little thin and kind of doughy even.  I'm not a big fan.  The salad was okay, but nothing to get excited about.  The Garlic balls were good.  The wings were good.  We ordered the mild ones and they were very mild.  The service is not the greatest, but not the worst either. I wish they would serve you the salad and appetizers before bringing out the pizza & wings, but we got it all at the same time.   I dont know if I will go here for this meal again, although I do want to try their Philly Steak Cheese sandwich w Fries for $6.99 at lunch time.  I hear that is a great sandwich.  The place wasn't busy when we got there, but filled up soon after."}
{"text":"I had the motor city burger and deep fried mushrooms. I wasn't impressed. Food is okay but nothing special."}
{"text":"I came in yesterday with a family of 11 people 2 of them being children of 1 years old. We wanted to eat pizza and mainly kill a little time because we were attending a wedding at a church just around the corner from here. We were denied access because the two children of 1 year had a happy meal box and could not enter with food from another establishment. It's understandable but when your business is completely dead, it's getting close to summer weather and we're completely  dressed up, they are not even children they are babies,  you cannot make an exception and on top of that want to be an a whole about it. It's a complete turn off from your establishment and all Angelina's in general peace out you guys lost a loyal customer."}
{"text":"This place is my go to for pizza since they are right down the street from me.  Not the best pizza in the world, but definitely better than average and at a reasonable price and they deliver late into the night.  I always enjoy their pizza and love that they are so close.  Their appetizers are great and generous too."}
{"text":"I give it one star because I can't give it less. 
The place smells like cigarettes since the moment you walk in.

Ordered the Cordon Bleu pizza and it didn't have any Ham.

The attitude of all the girls there is as if they were literally on their period! Not friendly at all. 

Hadn't been here in Years and now is my last time. At least include the stuff the pizza says it has.
Avoid this place"}
{"text":"So me & my friends ordered from this particular location last night. The wait was an hour, it was pretty reasonable. When he gets here, we just got one bag back, we had ordered 2 chili cheese fries, chicken tenders & fries with a large pepperoni pizza & a two liter of pepsi & sierra mist. So it would take more than one bag to hold all our stuff. He had forgot our sodas & the pizza. So we waited an extra 30 minutes for our drinks & pizza. We get our food & we open our \"chilli cheese fries\" & all it was, was old left out fries with a little cup of so called chilli & a cup of nacho cheese. I don't think that was our definition of chilli cheese fries. Now when ordering our chicken tenders he asked about our sauce preference, we said bar b que, the chicken tenders were drenched in bar b que sauce. After waiting we get our pizza which wasn't actually bad, i don't know if i would be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service every time. Great place to dine in or order for delivery."}
{"text":"Food was good.... services mmm  not so good. They need to work on their customers service skills."}
{"text":"2nd time i ordered from here. 1st time was delivery and the pizza was good but it had shifted while being delivered. No Worries cause we Nom nom Nom nom Nomd it all down. They have great specials and fast delivery. I ordered just a plain cheese pizza, it wasnt greasy but the crust was thin with a fluffy crust at the end of the pizza I LOVE THAT. And the Zeppolis are delicious. 

2nd time ordering. They have a great Pick up special. Got a 16inch cheese and sausage pizza. What a deal for pick up. And The pizza didnt shift though i brought it home. Mmm The sausage has a different consistency than other places that put sausage on Like Pizza hut per say. This was like crumbled up sausage. And I liked it way better. And the tomato sauce, or maybe its the crust. But i tasted a little honey and a Tongue Never lies. Again the Zeppolis are delicious and hot and fresh. And if you cant finish em they heat up well the next day in the microwave."}
{"text":"I'm so pissed, so I thought okay I'll give them a try again. Angelina's special pizza. it was so paper thin you couldn't pick it up,you had to fold it in half,and the girls are Rude, one has Meth mouth, how embarrassing to be up front working the counter to help other people,"}
{"text":"The service was terrible and so was the food. The screwed up our order twice. We will never go back"}
{"text":"Angelina's is kind-of a hit-&-miss. Somethings are great, somethings are blah!!.  Now I have never had their pizza, so this rating is on their flip side of the menu. The Lasanga is pretty good but the Spaghetti is lacking. Their Jumbo Stuffed Shells are decent, and their burgers are good. Philly Cheese is OK. Salads are good especially the Antipasta and a delicious Basalmic Vinagarette. The appetizers are poor, they taste frozen then fried. Kind of pricey. Decent portions. An average dinner, nothing special."}
{"text":"Over the past few years this was my go to pizza joint.  Angelina's isn't to far from my place, and it's located in a decent strip mall, where an Albertson's resides.  So, I would usually place an order, hit up Albertson's for sides and drinks, then grab my grub from Angelina's.  Very convenient!!!  But, something happened and I stopped coming here for a while.  Maybe it's because I wanted to try something new.  But, this last weekend I was wanting a burger.  And, I have always liked the burger offering that Angelina's provides.  I usually go for a Double Bacon Cheeseburger with a side of fries.  Filling and tasty.  So, I decided to come back and order one.  Here is my experience from this trip:

I call in my order for my Double Bacon Cheeseburger and make the trek out to Angelina's.  

*Side Note: The trip would be faster if they would open a road that goes between Vegas Valley and Sahara.  It would take a few miles off of my trip.

Anyhow, I get to Angelina's and get to the counter and pay for my order.  They told me that it would be a couple of minutes before it was ready.  No problem, I don't mind waiting.  A few minutes go by and up comes my order.  They put it in a plastic bag filled with napkins and ketchup packets.  Nice!!!

I get home and get ready to chow down on my burger.  I look and what is this... they forgot my bacon.  What???? I have a total love affair with bacon.  I mean, I order a side of bacon with my bacon.  I'm a little disappointed but, I'll get by - barely.  The burger is seasoned nicely, the tomatoes were fresh and the lettuce was crispy.  I also like the toasted bun.  A nice touch.  I could have used a little more fries but, whatever.  So, I say, decent job but took off a couple of stars for forgetting my bacon.  But, I'll be back!!!

My tip: They have more than pizza! Sandwiches / burgers / wings! If you ever go into Angelina's on Charleston, pick up a menu.  It is extensive and has a lot to offer."}
{"text":"TOTAL NIGHTMARE order at 7pm received my food at 9pm called the pizzeria and the assistant manager  told me it was grub hub fault in top of that i typed on the notes very specific i wanted a ranch dressing and they didn't deliver and the pizza was cold.

{"text":"Kept giving this place a chance for the past 4 years, as it's the only game around for a hot minute, but never should have given it a 2nd chance.  Pizza is consistently soggy when a well-bake is requested. Really wish it were worth it. Like the vending machine, though."}
{"text":"It was just \"okay\". The wings that we ordered were cooked perfectly, but there wasn't enough sauce. I found myself adding my own special hot sauce to them to keep them moist and not dry. The pizza...I'm not a pizza let me start by saying that. I've eaten it enough as a teenager though to know a good pie and this just wasn't it, especially for the price ($16 for a medium?). The dough was soggy and when you picked up a slice all of the toppings slid off. I wasn't that impressed, but willing to give them another shot, maybe during the day time. If you have coupons definitely use them."}
{"text":"I'm finally putting my feelings down in writing, finally, after being \"disappointed(to say the least)\" by this particular locations' standards for the last time.

Frankly, I'm not sure where to start. I order delivery from them fairly often, and usually order the same thing for myself, The Philly Cheesesteak with fries. It's usually sub-par at best but I sacrifice quality for convenience. Burnt meat, soggy flavorless fries, missing ingredients was the norm. Never again. Recently it's gone way below sub-par to disgusting. A handful of times now my fries have tasted like dish water and my meat had a sandy sort of grit to it. Still I never wrote any reviews and stopped bringing it back, because I'm of the admittedly pessimistic opinion that reporting dissatisfaction to this restaurant does absolutely nothing to improve things, as has been shown in the past when the few times I did call or go to Angelinas, to inform them they forgot parts of my order, I was met with horrible attitudes and just felt extremely uncomfortable, like I was somehow in the wrong. 

Why did I continue to order their food? Because it's convenient and they used to be great and I guess I just wanted to give them a chance(or numerous chances) to get their stuff together. Also, I'm an idiot apparently.

Another point I'd like to add: if you eat in, the food is significantly better. Doesn't taste off and doesn't show signs of the staff just not giving a damn, probably because you're right there to complain about it. This tells me it's not a question of someone just being a bad cook, but that they take advantage of being able to skimp and screw over take out orders because people(like myself) usually won't take the trip to bring it back in lieu of just putting up with bad food or throwing it away. That's just my take on that, though.

I'm gonna wrap this up with a summary of today's order. Gritty meat, dishwater fries, and after a few bites felt a giant hard chunk that squeaked when I bit into it, similar to glass or hard plastic. I instantly felt nauseous and my stomach contracted, and I had to run to the toilet where I vomited so forcefully, there were traces of blood in it(excuse the gory details). I'm irate at this point. Not sure if I will go up there later to personally speak with a manager as that may be irrelevant at this point; I will never ever order food from there again so there won't be much they could do to repair the situation. Very sad to say Angelinas is permanently removed from my list of regular eating spots. They used to be fantastic."}
{"text":"The pizza is ok, not the greatest but it has some flavor to it. I'm not sure on the prices, they are a little over priced for their quality."}
{"text":"We ordered for delivery a chicken Alfredo pizza and a ranch chicken wrap. It took over an hour when delivery time was supposed to be within 45 minutes. The pizza was pretty good although cold but the wrap was inedible. Cold, dry, and tasted old. Even my partner who can eat almost anything couldn't stomach it. Overall IF I order from them again I won't trust anything else but the pizza, which sucks because so many things on their menu sound delicious."}
