{"text":"Why is the location not been changed yet ??? Next to a Strip Club on Lakeland Blvd near 200 exit.."}
{"text":"Came in last night (March 4th) to celebrate my sister's b-day. Party of 8. Best ribs in town.  Best waitresses in town.  They really hustle and are very accommodating.   Thanks for being in Euclid/Cleveland."}

{"text":"First off, I'd like to give this location another shot, as well as the location near downtown a shot. Having said that, the place is WAY too pricey for the quality of the food. Let me be more detailed to be fair:  The appetizer platter is VERY expensive and not one of the appetizers was prepared well....like it all was waiting under a heat lamp since a week ago Thursday. Don't get it. You WILL feel ripped off.  The booth seats are the ridiculous kind that has this force feedback feature that lets you know when the man in the booth behind you has to go pee...sometimes before THEY even know it.....annoying.  The Ribs were pretty good. Can't complain about them. The pulled pork was lacking in both sauce and any kind of texture....almost a puree......  Overall, not worth the money spent for the quality given back."}
{"text":"My wife and I go to Pacer's often.  Their sauce is absolutely delicious, and I've never had a bad rack of ribs.  Their sides (rice pilaf, French fries, pork-n-beans, cole slaw) are always delicious as well.    I've seen complaints about the neighborhood in other reviews.  Granted, it's not the greatest but it's faaaaaaaaaar from the worst.  And it is right off the freeway...you don't have to drive past anything.    I highly recommend Pacer's and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Took a large party here for a business lunch. The black bean soup was great and everybody loved their food. Service was great."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how much business this place has been drumming up at this location since its new ownership but hopefully they give the place a once over.  It looks like a place straight out of a Old Western.  I went there for lunch once and got the over priced riblets.  This was supposed to be their specialty, WTF?  I went back and got the burger and was back in the saddle again...lol.  I think it could be a fun after work bar, just add people and booze.  I guess that could be said for just about any place, but this one seems especially pathetic in a good way.  I haven't been there in months but have a craving to go again just to see if anything has in fact changed.  Anyone else in?  It's only like 3 minutes from my work.  http://www.pacersribhouse.com"}
{"text":"Ribs are awesome award winning. They have prime rib specials on Tuesday and Saturday,  pizza night is Wednesday and any hamburger special is Monday's"}
{"text":"My wife grew up in Euclid and had mentioned this place as having excellent ribs and a generally comfortable atmosphere, both of which are true. However, the first time we tried to visit in 2010, after driving through the abandoned Malls and collapsed industrial areas of Euclid, we came up to Pacer's to find the parking lot empty except for two Lincolns pulled side by side with each other. My survival instincts sufficiently concluded that it was a drug deal or gangster meeting, so I floored it, spun out of the parking lot, and got on the interstate hard east as fast as I could.    As it turned out, it HAD closed and been reopened... So it probably really was a drug deal. Euclid can be rough in places.    But someone reopened it subsequently, and so in our next trip through while moving from Washington to New England, we stopped by, and it met all the old expectations!    It's sports bar-ish, but more like the Northwestern incarnation which is more or less a restaurant first than the very bar focused \"restaurant and bar\" of the East. The rib sauce is truly excellent and the selection and sizes of portions of side orders very good. They don't turn the televisions on too loud and service was quick and prompt. Absolutely no complaints, outstanding ribs, and a good atmosphere. Give it a try, and don't be afraid of the location, it's very nice now."}
