{"text":"Delicious, freshly prepared foods with great service. The free brownie that we got to try is like crack - Food Dudes, we will be back! Only bummer is that street parking can be a pain on Carlaw."}
{"text":"stumbled on this place. the barn board lined entry way acts like a beacon for the upwardly mobility on that otherwise industrial strip of carlaw.   good price point for lunch. I had the delicious beef brisket, on par with black camel, with the basil pesto quinoa salad and Mac and cheese. good mix of healthy and comfort.   best to take it togo. I sat on the chairs outside and was romance by the roaring parade of diesel trucks 3 feet away."}
{"text":"I love surprises! Especially rotating food ones!   I wish my leftovers were like Food Dudes leftover catering food!   They have a great selection of proteins - today was BBQ chicken, jerk chicken, lamb kebabs and more!   The GT cauliflower was superyum.   It's a takeout joint, so I found a nice spot by the water. I can't wait to grab another lunch here!"}
{"text":".@fooddudesto I've driven by this place every day, and it wasn't until I heard of their new restaurant (Rasa), I read that I can actually try their food almost every day! (at least I'd like to)  The pantry is a hidden gem. Take out only (or eat on Carlaw St) - but we took our food to the lake.   Freshly made salads (quinoa, coucous, bean, greens), baked goods (brownies, cookies), mac&cheese, pierogies, chicken, brisket, pork, porchetta - anything you can think of. Today they also have Soft Shall Crab as a special. OMG it was delicious with pierogies and bean salad.   I think their menu changes daily, and is just a sample of what they are making in their giant back room that houses the catering operation. There's TONS of food here, and I asked what happens to the leftover food. They told me, there is no such thing. They open until 6pm, and by 3pm people are calling to see if there is anything left. We came today at 12:30 and it was good to go.   Super friendly people, made us feel welcome, and didn't rush me trying to choose among all the good food.   It is a little pricey. My one protein + 2 sides + brownie = $18.99 including taxes. But I can be cheaper if you got a regular meal, or maybe even just one salad.   This is an excellent choice to pick up something quick and healthy. Or rich and decadent (depending on your mood)"}
{"text":"I previously had the brisket and wasn't very impressed - though the quinoa and potato salad was delicious.  Today I got chicken curry, quinoa and couscous.  All of it is absolutely fantastic.    If you're looking for delicious brisket I prefer that served at the Leslieville pumps up Carlaw, but this curry is really good."}
{"text":"This place is THE BEST! They have lots of choices every day, so there is something for everyone. I have tried the Jerk Chicken, the Miami Ribs and the Lamb Kebab and they are all amazing. For the sides, I like the Kale Caesar, Mac and Cheese, Roasted brussel sprouts, or the Broccoli. Also, they make a killer banana bread!  Limited seating, but we have managed to eat in there at least three times. When it's nice out, we usually take our food to the park so we can enjoy the sun."}
{"text":"Fantastic lunch spot to grab and go. The staff are super friendly as well. The Jerk Chicken and mac'n'cheese are the bomb"}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of Food Dudes so when I heard they were opening a pantry today it was my duty to show my support.  Located on 24 Carlaw Ave the Food Dudes pantry/production facility is the only place in the area that stands out.  With their huge sign it couldn't be missed so I headed in to check out what's really good.  When I got in I was greeted right away and offered some homemade chips....yum!!! They had hot/cold serve food ready to go for a really good price too.  I went for the lunch combo which was $10 that offered 1 protein and 2 sides.  I went with the beef brisket, mac n cheese and quinoa salad.  They also offer desserts, drinks, nuts, pickles, cookies, sandwiches, food food food foofdfododofodoof etc.  I drove back to the office right away because I wanted to sink my teeth into this delicious lunch.  As soon as I had my first bite of everything I thought to myself \"oh ya I could eat this everyday\".  The portion was big enough that I stored half the meal for lunch tomorrow, what a sweet deal!  Definitely checking this spot more often and I encourage you to stop by and say Hi to Mike behind the counter.  Tell him Chris sent you.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"This a great place, and I go here at least three times a week for lunch.   The ONLY knock I have is that when it's not the girls serving, just turn around and walk out because the guy who serves you gives the smallest portion size, its not worth the $13.   The food taste great, but I really can't go there for lunch if I'm not full after, so if you see the guy behind the counter, turn around and go to the Leslieville pumps or Completo."}
{"text":"Stopped in here right before an audition just to grab a bite to eat and it's gone straight to my list of best restaurants. It's NOT A CAFÃ‰, it's an amazing lunch spot with absolutely fantastic food. One downside: there's no seating so I ended up eating outside on a set of steps. This might have changed since then, but even if it hasn't, the food quality is SO good I would sit outside every time. Go to Food Dudes!"}
{"text":"gez, thought I wrote a review but I probably forgot to press post.  Well Ive been here a second time since I thought I first posted so this is a more accurate review.  So the first time I went here I popped in just because I drove by once and was curious - Its kinda in the middle of no where far away from any other restos/ food places. Their pantry doesnt have any seating other than the outside ones along the wall. It would be nice if they had a couple tables inside but really, there isnt any room.  So its all take out. I had the fried chicken adobo. Was Yummy!! I didnt have any sides.  I find the prices seem a bit high for take out and the long trek away from everything but hey - I'd def go back for the Fried chicken adobo.   .... And I did for the second time. Thing is I got there at 11:20 am. closed. I guess I should have looked up the opening time. Though I figured, if you are open for lunch and you are take out, lunch usually is between 11-2 ish for most places. So I walked allllll the way back to my work. Then 12 came around I was humming and hawing about going back. But the chicken adobo is worth it... so I trekked back.   They did not have the chicken adobo. UGH.   So apparently, the menu changes every week. You get what you get so dont expect to have the same thing the next time you visit.   I opted for the curry chicken and a couple of sides. There was a couscous dish that I found to be a bit pastey. and the chicken, though the sauce was flavorful, was kinda dry and the sauce was simply put on top - not infused with it. And then I had a salad with that - unfortunately the salad was the one thing that made the food less dry.   Hit and miss. The hit part was great, the miss part was a disappointing miss, especially for the trek and cost. Some consistency would be nice.   Especially since I've been telling family and friends to check out their Fried chicken adobo - I would not like for them to trek out there and they not have it.  Hands down, it is much better than the Fried chicken adobo at LaMesa filipino kitchen. Much flavorful inside instead of just a bit of the sauce outside. (and thats a big compliment for Flip food since you should take a look at the reviews for LaMesa - they are pretty good already for flip fusion).  And as there are not many filipino restos out there or the taste is not promoted as much as it should be, Food dudes should have this as a staple. Just sayin. There is a niche that needs to be filled, no one has so far!    ( I think even the curry chicken should be made with more flavor infused inside that just the sauce on the outside - the sauce was pretty darn tasty - just not enough of it)   One thing they did mention was that if you come back with the black tupperware container they give you with your food, they will give you a dollar off your next meal? Not sure if that is still happening.  So my review after my first visit would be a 4.5/5  (minus . 5 due to the trek and prices being a bit mahal (expensive for take out - though worth it if all the food was like their adobo).   But after my second visit ordeal its now a 3.5/5 (wish yelp would do half stars here)"}
