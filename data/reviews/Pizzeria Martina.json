{"text":"I ordered a pizza for delivery and it arrived in really good time - but it was cold. Not just cooled down but cold. The ingredients were of good quality and, individually, were tasty but they were clumped in little piles in a few places rather than distributed (do I really need 6 whole olives in one bite?) and the cheese was not even melted. All in all, a strange experience."}
{"text":"The restaurant has a very interesting concept. Loved the casual and artistic vibe. Went there with coworkers and we had a great time. You can bring your own wine. The pizzas are a little pricey. Despite that, it was delicious. If you want to have a pleasant and/or romantic evening, its the place to go :) i think I will bring my next date there."}
{"text":"Très bon souvenir de ce restaurant calme et agréable. La nourriture est très bonne! Un gros + pour la décoration et l'ambiance que cela crée."}
{"text":"C'est vraiment dommage lorsque tu dois donner que 2 étoiles pour un resto ou le problème n'est pas en cuisine!! Délicieuse pizza mais quel service horrible! Se faire demander si nous avons terminé de manger  lorsque nous avons la fourchette en main en train de manger?!?!? Imaginez-vous que cette expérience c'est terminé avec le gâteau d'anniversaire; que nous avions emporté, renversé sur le sol en cuisine!! :("}
{"text":"Amazing pizza AND byob!! Can it get any better. Home made everything with lots of attention and love. Really underrated place in st Henri if you ask me. Recommended this to out of town colleagues and they now make the trip from Ottawa to bring their family. Seriously good pizza."}
{"text":"The ambiance in this restaurant is great, the service is very helpful and friendly, the music was good. I love that it's a BYOB and there's an SAQ within walking distance. Do note though that they are closed on Mondays (which is a real bummer because Mondays is easiest day of the week for me to dine out). We tried the antipasto (which as other commenters have mentioned looks expensive but is decent value for money - the portion is generous) and three different pizzas. I was impressed by the quality and the expertly made crust. Great little spot!"}
