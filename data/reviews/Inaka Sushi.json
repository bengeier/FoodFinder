{"text":"We stopped here on the way home from the cottage and this was everything we had hoped: excellent food, generous portions, and fast and friendly service. Both the orange dynamite roll and Inaka Udon were outstanding and comparable to any Japanese restaurant in Toronto. We also got free appetizers with our meals."}
{"text":"Was visiting w/ my bf n his brother from CA and didn't to eat here w/ their bro n sister in law who recently moved to Henderson. It's like All You Can Eat within ONE Hour of ordering!! And make sure you finish it All cuz they'll charge you!! It was my first experience with sushi n thanks to this place I love it!! The five of us finished everything we ordered and were Stuffed!! Service was Great btw!! Very fast!!"}
{"text":"Great food and never have to wait for a table. Service is excellent and the orange roll is a must have!!!"}
{"text":"We used to come here often. The sushi was always good. I had a friend in town and attempted to bring him here last Saturday night. Sadly they were closed for renovations. I went to their website on friday just to see if they had changed anything on the menu and it did NOT mentioned they were not open. I find that to be poor customer service. Wasted an hour driving there and back."}
{"text":"Went today and left. Grouchy owner, pushy waitress.  Not going here unless you wish to be treated badly. Almost like you are bothering them to show up. Only day to go is when Larry the sushi guy is there or don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"We ordered take out sushi the other night.  Not only did they short us a roll, when we went back and requested the full order the server became upset with us.  When she finally ordered the forgotten roll, the server and sushi chef began speaking in another language, looking at us and laughing loudly.  I guess something about them messing up our order was funny?  The sushi and tempura were sub-par.  I will never go back to this place again--why pay to be treated like an amusing joke?  Guess that's why we were the only customers in the place.  How hard is it to get the only outstanding order right?  Utter disappointment."}
{"text":"OMG... been here about 5 more times since my last review. 

Consistent great service.

Consistent excellent sushi.

I'm addicted!"}
{"text":"My son and I had lunch here last Friday, June 7. He had the eat all you can sushi and before sleeping that night, he vomitted once and all throughout the night, probably vomitted about 8 more times that finally ended in him ending up in the emergency room of Summerlin Hosp early morning Saturday for food poisoning, as explained by the ER physician. Some of the sushi my son ordered did not look fresh and I told him that but he said its taste ok but I what does a 15yo know about what's fresh or not. I should have tasted it before allowing him to consume the sushi. I thought about what could have caused this incident w him and I can only put my finger on the sushi. 
Not coming back here again."}
{"text":"Eh, finally tried a sushi joint close to home, went with Richie H. to check it out the sushi joint out of sheer adventurism and to help support  locally owned businesses. 

The decor is pretty minimal with the star of the dining room being the sushi bar located on the right side of the room.
 
The service wasn't too bad, I didn't encounter any unpleasant service or anything like that. In fact, they were very attentive and wanted to make sure we were comfortable during dinner. An extra * for that! 

However, the food could use a bit more help. While the fish was OK, the portion could use a little help. It was a bit on the smaller side, while being pretty thin. The rice could be way better, sushi rice needs to be a little more on the grainy side with the eater being able to feel each grain separate in your mouth. Well, not in this case! Kinda of too sweet with the rice being a little on the mushy side. I know I'm kinda of nit picking, but if you think about it, especially in Vegas aka. in the middle of the desert, almost all of these restaurants go to the same fish monger for \"fresh\" fish. Rice is the thing that's going to separate the good and the bad. Also, they did this weird thing with the scallops, they actually minced it like the spicy tuna roll meat, so getting the scallop nigri sushi was out of the question. Maybe a cost saving move?    

Maybe I'll check it out again, but who knows. Until then, if you happen to be in the SW and don't feel like driving very far for some sushi, then is may be a compromise. 

Bon Appetite."}
{"text":"I went for lunch with my bf & we had all you can eat, not too expensive. It's pretty good & the people were nice. I would come here more often."}
{"text":"We went there for lunch for the AYCE. The rice on the nigiri's is way too much, but then again, I didn't see any Japanese cooks making them, so I can't blame them if they don't know what they are doing. No matter how nice the servers are, the food needs to be good for me to return.  Not my favorite place."}
{"text":"Very unimpressed after our visit today. The fish was too mushy, the rice was too sweet, and they overcharged me but I was honestly too nervous to confront the off-putting host/server man. We won't be returning. The chef was friendly and therefore I give some stars."}
{"text":"This place is not good sushi and the prices don't reflect the service.  I went with 2 friends and the waitress made a huge deal about my friend returning her cucumber salad that looked a few days old.  Will not be going back.  Smith's on Valle Verde makes better rolls!"}
{"text":"Amazing! We come here a couple nights a month for our date night and it's by far our favorite resturant. The service is great, everyone is so friendly and the owner always makes a point to make you feel welcome. Spicy chicken dish is delicious!
You will not be disappointed coming here,"}
{"text":"I love this place!  Sushi is amazing and service is great.  Also very clean.  Inaka Sushi is definitely our go to sushi craving crusher.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because they don't have tempura ice cream."}
{"text":"My husband and I use to come here a lot a few years ago when Apple was still here and we could not complain about it. However, we went last night after not coming for a while and all I can say so that the service is horrible.  Not only was the male server rude to us but he yelled at an elderly couple and embarrassed them in front of everyone.  I know the rules say that you can not share with people who are not doing the all you can eat option but this poor elderly lady's sushi roll had not come yet and she took a piece of her husband's roll (mind you they said it was going to be the same roll) because the wife was starving.  They are an elderly couple! Give them a break! I'm sure they aren't going to eat that much. Anyway, this male server isn't very pleasant and he makes you not want to come here again. The sushi itself was just ok. Not as fresh as other places here in the Vegas/Henderson area. One thing is for sure, not coming here again!"}
{"text":"My sister recommended this place and we thought it was pretty good. I appreciated there was not sauce (mayo) smeared all over the top of my rolls. The service was good and the food came out quickly. The restaurant offers happy hour Monday - Thursday. The experience made for a good date night. We were informed a new location opened near Mountains Edge."}
{"text":"A great find in the Caledon/Orangeville area! Very fresh fish and friendly service.
My in laws eat here often and informed us that they always bring a \"chef special\" which was
a very tasty fried cod plate during our dinner. They said it changes each time and is on the house.
I found their soup to be very well flavored. Unlike many sushi houses in the city where I find them quite bland. 
They really must give the soup time for their flavors to meld.  Whatever they do, it was great!
Everything our family had was very good. They recently opened, but I'm sure they will be there a long time with food 
and service that good!"}
{"text":"I always come back to this place. It's the best for me. Especially since I live in North Las Vegas. Wait...Don't get me wrong. There are places closer to me and around town. Tried them, but I always come back here."}
{"text":"Great place. One of the only sushi joints that has fresh uni. Every time my husband and I have eaten here its quiet and slow so you get immediate attention and interaction especially sitting up at the bar. Great happy hour too. All you can eat with free beer or sake, sounds good :)"}
{"text":"Ate here multiple times and for the price great food! Friendly service and awesome happy hour. Would recommend to friends and family."}
{"text":"I was a little nervous about this place given the other reviews, but after skipping it previously and trying 808 sushi (which was disappointing) I thought I would give it a try.  I ordered a couple rolls to go and was pleasantly surprised with the food.  I thought it all tasted very good, which is awesome since this place is very close to my home.  Everything seemed really fresh.  Granted I have only had a couple of rolls, but I would encourage you to try it for yourself.  I personally don't think the other reviews give it justice."}
{"text":"It's too bad the waiter always seems \"put out\". 

You are a server, look up the definition. I would hate to go to this person's home. I learned a long time ago serving others in your place, you make sure they are comfortable.

The place lacks the experience of smiling faces, genuine care in making us comfortable.

Of course, when you feel like serving lemon slices with salmon as \"too much\" or that each person is not deserving of their own wasabi and ginger tray....it becomes offending.
Still I love their sushi. 
It's actually the most consistent fare I've had in the valley, attitude and all.

x)"}
{"text":"There are so many \"all you can eat\" sushi places in town to go somewhere that the service fails. I do like their rolls but whatever, it's all the same rolls wherever you go-rolls with a bunch a different goop slathered all over them in different combinations, I'm not dumb. 
The guy who works there, the waiter, owner, whatever has the personality of a mackerel!
The staff there and at their other location near Rhodes Ranch, have terrible personalities. They do not say thank you when leaving or entering. When I go there I feel like I am intruding on their time. There is a place called Sushi Koma on Flamingo and Durango...I will just drive there next time....(it's farther) but at least, those people appreciate your business.
No more Inaka for this girl...and all the people I take. It's not worth it. I go out for the environment as well as the food. I literally left there the last time like I did something bad."}
{"text":"Really good sushi.  Always fresh and the chef makes good conversation when I am there on lunch.  I get the sushi quite fast as well."}
{"text":"Inaka is one of the best Sushi spots in town.  The Inaka roll is amazing and the fish is always fresh.  True, the service isnt the greatest, but I can overlook that because the food is awesome."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to get sushi. It is always so fresh and tastes so good. I had to post the menu because they don't have a website so just check the photos is you want to know what is on the menu."}
{"text":"I chose the Take Box with Beef, shrimp sushi, vegetables, tempura, California rolls, ginger, salad and miso soup. The flavors were as great as the food looked. Customer service outstanding. Our first visit was for lunch and this visit, dinner. Both occasions, the staff and service was excellent. Meal portions are more than adequate. This will be a regular stop for us. 
 I plan to try the delivery soon."}
{"text":"Me and the wife had AYCE and expected it to be ok. My first bite into the yellowtail nigiri was the worst i have ever tasted. The main part of sushi is the rice and it was very mushy yet hard, meaning it was undercooked and then left out for a long time making the edges of each rice hard. Let alone the texture, the flavor was awful. The fish was so thin and was not fresh. We only had an hour for AYCE, and i couldnt hang. It was torture and the waitress was a chinese snob. How can you mess up sushi this bad? Going here will give you the experience. Even the low sodium soy sauce was not low sodium lol. How is this place still running? Because like me, i didnt yelp it before coming. So STAY AWAY!!! There are many other AYCE places that are faaar superior."}
{"text":"Went in and was the only one there. The hostess was friendly and helpful. Not a big fish fan but go because my other half loves sushi. Luckily there are a few things on the menu I can eat, although not as big a selection as oyshi or kobe on the non seafood. Had the vegetable roll which was good, decent size portion esp. For ayce. The hero roll (spicy tuna, cucumber, avocado, Tabasco, covered in spicy mayo, also asked them to put jalapeños in it) was awesome. As I said not a big fish fan but this wasn't fishy at all. Very fresh. Only gave it 4 stars since it's easy to be attentive when it's slow. Will definately go again."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS !!! I always go with my family But we only go when Larry is there . Now hes there tuesday through saturday. He always remembers his customers and when you walk in the door ,you know hes getting started on your sushi. Hes very friendly and always gets our orders PERFECT. He will even make you things that are not on the menu especially if you want to tweak something! Im always absolutely stuffed when I leave ."}
{"text":"Avoid this place at all costs!!! There sushi was beyond horrible, which tasted like saucy cardboard. I have been to many sushi locations in the past and this is hands down the worst. The way I found out about this place is through yelp, but was mislead by how many stars they should really have. 

First off, the fish was of poor quality and definitely not fresh, according to sushi standards. Buffet Asia would of satisfied me a lot more than this place, that's how bad this place is. There rolls were devoid of any delicious flavor, due to the high usage of rice and stall fish.
 
Secondly, the big Asian guy who was our server, looked pissed off at us the whole time. I just don't understand why it's hard for servers to be that way and complain why we don't tip them as well as they wanted. That is how the cookie crumbles in America, bad service equals bad tips.

Going to various sushi spots in Vegas and California in the past, and eating at Inwhacka, it has given me a higher appreciation of what real sushi should be like. All I can say is don't waste your time or money ($25) if you want sushi. There are numerous sushi joints that serve a much higher quality of sushi. Such locations are: sushi kaya, oyshi, goyemon, and sushi mon. My goal in this review is to save as many victims to bad sushi as possible."}
{"text":"If the service was as good as the sushi perhaps i would give this place 5 stars. 
We always seem to be treated horribly and they always forget a few things we order!
Its on the paper for Pete's sake!!! Errrrr....as much as it aggravates me i always go back for more because the food quality is superb!!! So if ur looking for amazing sushi but not expected good service at all then this a great place to go. I love how they have a loyalty card! For every 10 all u can eat sushi u get one free!!! Saving on a meal is fantastic in my book!!!
The salmon Kama is super yummy!!!!"}
{"text":"Good sushi, decent prices, not a great atmosphere but we go often for the convenience & good food!"}
{"text":"It's a shame that they don't have good quality sushi. It's so close to home but unfortunately they don't know how to make sushi. I've never tasted such bad Saba till we ate here. They don't use ponzu on the fishes that need it. The workers/owners I believe are chinese, I think they should stick to chinese food. The sushi chef is inexperienced. You can tell by the shape of the nigiri sushi and it should be molded tightly to each other. The art of sushi is mainly about the sushi rice.I think they need to learn how to use rice vinegar or something. I really wanted to like them but everything I tried was horrible."}
{"text":"I have been going to Inaka for years. Their sushi is some of the best I've had, everything is always fresh and the chefs are always willing to change up anything in a roll, not that it's necessary since they have a great variety already. Also the price for the AYCE is very reasonable and competitively priced compared to others around town."}
{"text":"Inaka is quality sushi! Leo is a very caring person Along with his awesome staff. Food here is awesome. Try the Leo and Inaka rolls!"}
{"text":"It doesn't take a lot to provide terrible service but when my wife and I went in here it was as if the Host ( overweight rude slob) was trying to piss us off and make us feel unwelcome.. 
Cozy place but I wouldn't recommend it.."}
{"text":"Not fresh. Not yummy. Probably worst I had. And we tried twice in case it was a fluke. It wasn't."}
{"text":"Really good AYCE menu. Nice, clean place. Some AYCE sushi places seem to skimp on quality and quantity of fish, but not this place. My husband and I ordered way too much and had nearly 2 whole rolls left. It is common for AYCE places to bill you for anything you don't finish however they we very nice and did not bill us. Inaka is very close to our home but even if it were a bit out of the way, we will absolutely be coming back."}
{"text":"It is very rare that I give 1 star reviews, but this one takes the cake.  Before calling this place I looked over the lunch special menu, on the top of the  menu there were these two words that I hate!! \"NO Substitutions\". I looked all over the menu for the combo that I usually get, but for some reason they did not have it.  I made my call over to this place and I was about to place a nice sized order for my staff and I.  I asked the gentleman, who I felt was rushing me, If I could get tonkatsu instead of chicken katsu with beef terri, the gentleman said that they \"Do not offer this combo under the LUNCH SPECIAL at all\"  OK understood.  I then asked him,  okay well I don't want the lunch special, would I be able to get one plate of beef terri and a side of tonkatsu.  The gentleman replied, NO, I can not do that.  I asked him why, he said that it was too expensive to do it like that.  I asked him how much would it cost for me to get this, he chuckled and said like $30-$40 for the plate for doing this.  I WAS appalled by this response.  One, how do you know what I can and can not afford.  Two, your a restaurant and you should accommodate your customers.  Three, there is more then just your Japanese restaurant out there.  Four, provide people with alternatives or options instead of just saying NO!!!  I will not recommend this place to anyone!  Your money is well spent at Papa Johns right next door instead of this place!"}
{"text":"I always enjoyed this place since it was near and food was actually good. I went wirh family to eat and the service was just horrible!! Probably wont come back. And not because the waiter said so. (was mad at tip) claiming not even 10% when it was more than that. if the service was good it would of been a better tip. But since service was  horrible. I even had to suck on the ice cup to get the waiters attention and still didn't get water."}
{"text":"A sushi bar walking distance from my neighborhood,

Nothing too special, but it gets the job done."}
{"text":"Very fast service! Some nice rolls!! Intimate dining! Close to Mountains Edge for a fast bite!!"}
{"text":"Not impressed, and will never go back. The sushi chef was eating while he was making rolls! Head down at the bar shoveling food in his face all while making people's orders and he never washed his hands! 

The sushi was okay, but the sauces were very bland. We are in Vegas where you can find all you can eat places for $25 with more variety, a better atmosphere and clean hands! The service was quick, but they missed three of our rolls then seemed irritated that they had to make them after we politely reminded them. Probably because we were interrupting the chefs dinner. Completely ridiculous."}
{"text":"Stay away! This is a rip off! The fish does not take fresh at all. The sushi tastes just like one you would buy at 7-11. Every sushi roll tastes about the same. This is by far the worse sushi  I've had in this town."}
{"text":"we go here often and always get great service the people are always friendly and the food is great.  great value for money, never feel rushed and get chance to have a relaxing dinner!! great place would reccomend to everyone!!!!"}
{"text":"We love this place! We go there at least once or twice a month. we tried every sushi place around Eastern and St. Rose area and we think this one is the best.The staff is always fast ,pleasant and helpful. They offer all you can eat sushi including sake on weekdays for a great price. You must get the Jalapeno Poppers with Ahi when you go. We try to sit at the bar so we can talk to the sushi chef. Tip them, they deserve it! They are even open on holidays."}
{"text":"Food is just ok, nothing to write home about. The portion is not worth the money. The miso soup, you might find a couple of specks of seaweed and two or three small cubes of tofu. If you are looking for good bento boxes, you will want to visit the Japanese restaurant at Fort Apache and Patrick Ln. It will be worth the travel."}
{"text":"Inaka Sushi is not our usual sushi place.  We decided to give it a try since we were in the neighborhood.  It is a good place for all you can eat sushi.

We were greeted promptly at the door and seated quickly.  The wait staff did not mind if we shared our all you can eat sushi with our 2 year old daughter.  We were told that we would be charged another AYCE if our daughter was 4 or older.  Good to know.

My wife and I chose a variety of sushi rolls such as California rolls, spicy tuna, caterpillar rolls, tomago, oshinko, and cucumber rolls.  All of the sushi was fresh, the plate presentation was awesome and the sushi was delicious.

Overall, it was a good experience.  It seemed to me that you would get better service at the sushi bar.  If I am in the neighborhood again (St. Rose and Eastern) again, I would give Inaka Sushi another try."}
{"text":"AAmaing!!! If you like american made, watered down, trendy sushi then dont stop here. Larry, and leo make damn good sushi and im a food snob! (Read my reviews) we have taken so many out of towners there and they all leave very happy! These reviews blow me away, and wtf!!!! Drop by and tell larry what flavors you like and watch him make magic. Booooo hoooo there is a little clutter. The place has a A rating and bomb sushi. Check em' out.."}
{"text":"Got there on a Sunday.  Nobody in the restaurant except one guy at the sushi bar.....service, by the female waitress was the worst I have ever experienced.    Her english was bad however her attitude was even worse.   As we asked her about the menu she was 3 feet away from our table and was not interersted in helping , like she was in a rush to go some where.  usually sushi here is good..it seemed almost room temp.  the mussell app was awful with big stringy pieces of something and mostly mayo. i asked for the HOT scallop app she brought some horrible scallop roll and then demanded she take the whole plate away when I told her it was incorrect.  Sake came cold.  when we told her we ordered hot sake she returned with another (which we paid for) which was scolding hot..I know because i burnt my thumb picking it up.  Lastly a cockroach walked across my foot nice end to a meal.  i have been calling the owner for three days now and no return call.  I called today again and advised the waiter how upset I was and told him i wa sgoing to call the health dept...his words exactly \"I dont care call the police see if I care\"....................."}
{"text":"I go here about twice a month with my boyfriend and my baby. Waitress can first come off as rude but she is super helpful. She always tells me how cute my baby is too. :) sushi chef is super cool and sushi always comes out fast.
if you go, order the INAKA ROLL or CALIFORNIA CRUNCH. shit is to die for. love the yum-yum sauce."}
{"text":"I tried this place only because it's so close to me -- I am pretty adamant about sticking to my favorite sushi chef in the world -- Naka from Naka Sushi in Summerlin 

This place made me realize that their are 2 types of sushi chefs -- (1)The super serious just-take-whatever-I-give-you chef and (2) the fun loving come-on-in-everybody sushi chefs -- Unfortunately this place had the first kind of sushi chef -- the mean mugg dude that acts like he doesn't want to be there... the type of dude that doesn't ever go off the grid and just sticks to the menu

Speaking of the menu, it's REALLY confusing because they have these LITTLE menus that show pictures and names of the different types of sushi fish and it's on this stand up V shape card that's actually meant to be a promo for a certain type of sake or Japanese beer or something -- THIS IS NOT THEIR MENU -- Their menu actually looks more boring and is just a list of things in black and white... I mistakenly tried to order something I saw on the little promo menu and he told me THAT'S NOT THE MENU IT'S JUST FOR PEOPLE THAT DON'T KNOW WHAT SUSHI LOOKS LIKE -- I get the point but from a customer's POV it's just confusing that you have something that LOOKS like a menu... albeit a second, smaller menu... but what was disappointing was that this little menu had fish that the restaurant didn't even have -- So, ONCE AGAIN... why bother having this little menu at all???

The sushi chef wasn't a total a-hole. He just didn't have (what I would consider) an upbeat and pleasant attitude -- and when customers are asking you for certain types of fish or for you to make a roll a certain way -- whether it's on the menu or not -- you should have a better response than \"We don't have it\"... or in this dude's case he pretended to NOT understand what I was asking for.

The salmon and tuna HAND rolls were the best thing here. The saba (mackerel) didn't have that fishy taste that I was used to and was actually quite bland -- The main reason I wanted to come here was because I wanted to try hamachi -- but it was nothing to write home about

All-in-all there are just way better sushi places to go to in this valley"}
{"text":"The ahi tuna was not red but dark"}
{"text":"I went there for the first time a little while ago with my brother. The place was dead at dinner time so we should have known to turn around and go somewhere else. But nope we wanted to give it a try. We both had the AYCE. Sushi was not good, too much rice, not enough fish. Appetizers were not good either..ordered fried tofu and they gave me a full plate of not fried but soggy tofu...enough tofu to fill anyone up. I guess they didn't want anyone to order anything else....so wrong. I'm surprised this place is not out of business yet."}
{"text":"This place used to be a 5 star place when Larry was making the food.  Without him it is not worth the time or effort. Sorry to see Larry gone and now we need to find a new place for Sushi"}
{"text":"Tried this place with my family, because it was close to home and fast.  The all you can eat price at $24/person as reasonable and actually a few dollars cheaper than most places.  The sushi was just mediocre.  Some of the fish as not very fresh.  The sweet shrimp was not true sweet shrimp and they don't fry the head.  The service is good, but the sushi is disappointing.  Oyshi a couple miles away is much better."}
{"text":"We always go on weekdays, its not very busy and with ayce you get free hot saki.  Service is good, sushi is good.  We have been to several sushi places, we prefer inaka over all of them.  Even Oyshi on Rainbow."}
{"text":"I decided to try a new AYCE sushi joint for lunch today. We were the first customers of the say so we were seated fairly quickly. As soon as you walk in, you can smell the strong fishy scent lingering in the air (I probably smelled like fish after I left). The glass of water that was served to me had a really strong afrer-taste. It was very yucky. I started off with miso soup. It was nothing special. Then came the shrimp tempura. I was impressed because the shrimp had the right crunch to it. The shrimp was also not soggy or chewy. The seafood ragoon (is that how you spell it?) was not very good. I only ate one of the three pieces. The tuna and garlic tuna nigiris were actually good. The tuna was not dry at all unlike past experiences with other joints. The Japanese lasagna was not very good either. We actually ended up having two pieces then gave it back to them. I liked their baked green mussels. It was served on a really big round shell. I thought that was a nice touch to it since its never been served to me that way. I was disappointed that their salmon kama was not a part of the AYCE lunch. I tried their smoked salmon and it was extremely salty. The saltiness overpowered the smoked flavor. Our server did a decent job at keeping up with us. He only forgot two things: smoked salmon and our check. Overall, it was an okay experience. Still satisfied my sushi craving but I don't think I'll be coming back. One last thing, their toilet was extremely dirty. Their were poop stains on the toilet. This should've been cleaned the night before considering that we were the first customers. It was very disgusting."}
{"text":"Been going here for years. Got to know the owners, chefs and servers. Outstanding sushi and the beers keep coming!!!"}
{"text":"Awful sushi. If you like avocado at all don't come here every single piece of avocado was brown and rotting. Everything was warm and overall mediocre. The pacific roll was the best thing they had at their first location but at this location it's not very good at all. The place is always empty which goes to show how it is. If you can drive to a better sushi place don't bother stopping here."}
{"text":"Wow the rice to fish ratio is way off. The fish is cut thin and the rice is way over, I tried 3 rolls and they were all tasteless and the scallops were slimy. I can see why this place has the rating it has. Call me crazy but even their soy sauce tastes watered down. Don't eat here there are way better places around!!"}
{"text":"Went there over the weekend with a party of 12, had some issues.

Good: Food was good.  No issues with the quality of the sushi at all.

Bad: Service was awful.  We all got AYCE, and they had us fill out the papers on the table (which is normal.)  We only received some of the food that was ordered and had to request the rest of it on more than one occasion.

Some of us had beer, some had sake, some (myself) just had water.  The server couldn't figure out who had who, so wrote all of the checks as one lump sum and split it between us... making my (and my girls) 2 $25 AYCE and waters to $74.  Everyone else at the table was having the same issue.  When we explained that we all know what we ordered and should pay that, the server started to argue (really) with us about \"how it works.\"  Well, 20 minutes later we finally got the correct bills and left.

I can get good sushi at tons of places in town (Kaizen is about 3 minutes from this place and is better,) but with service like we received, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Food sucks. My brother in law ate here twice and had food poisoning. Service sucks. Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"There are many options for sushi throughout the Las Vegas area. Many good ones but this has taken a top spot on my list. I have some friends who have been here and I don't know why I never visited sooner. 
One night after work I was in the mood for AYCE sushi and decided to try Inaka Sushi. Pretty standard looking inside, quick welcome and glad to take an open seat at the bar. There were 2 chefs, one older and one younger. I sat with the younger chef and he was friendly and turned out to be awesome. 
As with most other places, you find some of the same rolls so I started off with a couple of my usual suspects mixed in with some nigiri. This is when the chef asked about what I type of fish I liked, spicy preference, etc. I was more than happy to try his suggestions. WOW. He was great, making some rolls I may not have thought to try or overlooked. I loved every one he made. 
I went back again since for a 2nd visit, sat with the same chef and he remembered me. The older chef remembered me as well just from some casual conversation during my first visit. Pretty much the same if not better visit. Had one of my favorite rolls and one I recall that he made for me last time. This visit he ended up making something custom based on my likes and man it was good. This has become my favorite place and I will be going back again soon."}
{"text":"Totally craptastic...me and my friend go here because its right around the corner from the house...there were 2 people in here, so its not like the server was n Tue weeds..
I order all you can eat. Three rolls, only get 2, she takes my menu away and never returns it. Then when I ask for my menu back she has a total stank attitude and gives me the wrong one I filled out!!  I never got my third roll, I was too pissed off.  The edamame was covered in salt like McDonald's French fries...I had to rub it off with a napkin...It was a total waste. And free sake???  Doesn't exist. Fuckery. Total fuckery."}
{"text":"We had a groupon for this place (50% off) and it was near us so decided to give it a try, and I'm glad we did...

I was skeptical because of the previous reviews commenting on the service, but we experienced none of that! Granted we were one of only 3 tables in the place, but service was quick and courteous. Our waiter brought us a high hair for our daughter, strapped her in, and even brought her a water cup, very nice and helpful!

I'm not a sushi fan so I ordered the matsu box w teriyaki chicken and it was all great, the gyoza, rice, salad, etc. my boyfriend had 2 sushi rolls and said it was good. 

Other than being pretty empty, there was nothing to complain about!"}
{"text":"We drove up to Forks Credit Rd. from Toronto on Victoria day to get out of the city and stumbled upon this place. Simply, this is one of the best sushi restaurants in the GTA. 

Very inexpensive and very good quality. By Toronto standards it is 10/10. By ultimate Tokyo standards it is a 6/10. This is high praise in light of the mega bucks and Tsukiji restaurants I've eaten at.

Although not strictly Japanese, there is more authenticity in decor, procedure and food preparation than just about any other place in town. On a holiday the fish was fresh and tasty. They even had uni! I was shocked. The salmon was perfect and maguro very respectable. 

I also had unagi don, gyoza, shrimp tempura. All above average. To top it off, the free house salad appeared to have lettuce grown out back.

I've largely stopped eating the garbage sushi available in Toronto and will consider the hour drive to eat here. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"All-you-can-eat is reasonably priced and you get a free bottle of Saki. Food tasted fresh and very friendly service but they don't take Amex."}
{"text":"Got the all-you-can-eat dinner special for 25 bucks.  Pretty good price, really good sushi, and the service was great.  Good spot to go if you live in the southwest area."}
{"text":"Been here a few years back.  Still as good as I remember it.

Fried rice was delicious.  Not too greasy & full of ingredients (chunks of chicken, peas,  & onions) 

Salmon was just as tasty not over powered by the teriyaki.

Hello kitty roll was good rice wasn't rolled ass well as it should have been kept falling off my roll.  Lots of crunch w/ every bite.

Iced tea was on a lrg cup... No need to keep bugging for refills."}
{"text":"Been coming here for a couple years... never again... we ordered 3 different rolls, rainbow, dirty harry and sex on the beach... the rainbow roll had grey, sticky old fish... didnt even try that part of it... i let the server know (she wasn't very attentive to us and we were not even doing the ayce) . She said she would let the chef know but still charged me full price for the roll... i paid it but will not be going back...."}
{"text":"Great sushi, first place i goto when i get into town, all you can eat is awesome. The staff make you feel wecome and also give some great suggestions if you cannot make up your mind from the vast selections of roll's"}
{"text":"I was introduced to Inaka not too long ago and I think I have to say I love it.

Let's start with the stuff I like:

Inaka Roll
Shrimp Tempura
Spicy Shrimp Roll
Tuna Rolls (any variety)
Steamed Dumplings
and more on this later...

Placed just inside Mountains Edge, Inaka is hidden between a gym, a yogurt shop, Subway and a Mountains Edge Dental. The place is typically quiet and that results in first class service. However, I have no doubts that they would be able to keep service high even with many more people frequenting the place.

I personally like to sit at the Sushi bar and give my order straight to the Sushi chef who knows all the items off of his head. This is great, but you should see him pump out rolls for the people who order All You Can Eat (AYCE). I am more of an ala carte kinda guy because I don't eat that much in the first place.

About the food: Sushi is fresh, veggies are fresh and the sauces are good. There is only one other sushi place in town that does it for me and the quality is just as good, if not better then that place.

IF you live in Mountains Edge, you must make this your Sushi place of choice."}
{"text":"Absolutly unexpected! Looks like a little dive but the food is great. I'm surprised to find such a good Japanese restaurant in a tiny village. The private booth seating is a plus and the staff are extremely friendly, not too mention the food is great. 10 minutes from Orangeville and 25 from Brampton,"}
{"text":"in the area of Eastern/Horizon Ridge in henderson there a few good sushi choices, but for us, this is not one of them. While I cannot site by name each role we had, I can say that none of them stood out or impressed. The plus side was the incredible speed at which they showed up (although lacking any personality), the minus side was the flavor/quality. We happened to have a Groupon, had ordered beer and was told if we bought two we got one free. However, once we presented the Groupon, the third was apparently not free after all. So, for $72 for2 of us, with pretty flavorless sushi, next time we will head back to either kaizen or I Love Sushi."}
{"text":"Went to have all you can eat sushi with Teri, Reggie, and her friend. Although the all you can eat sushi's are popping up everywhere in the southwest, it is in an area that is just beginning to develop so I don't know if that's why they didn't have business. Kinda weird because it was a weekend! There were only a couple other people in the restaurant. I think most locals have their all you can eat faves like Sushimon :). 

The nigiri was ok, fish was cut thin and small pieces, but rice sucked. When the rolls remind me of something you can buy at a grocery store, it's a bad sign. They had alot of the crab mixture filling them up. One roll we got was covered in mayo and sauce which made it better. The cucumber salad had a dressing straight from the bottle and the tofu was not the way I was used to from other restaurants. 

For being empty the service sucked. At other all you can eat, the waitresses are usually right there ready to take more orders. Also this waitress did not seem like she got her sushi training because she was having a really hard time answering questions etc. 

I admit I am a tad bit of a sushi snob, but I would not recommend this restaurant unless you have very low expectations for sushi! hehe"}
{"text":"The place is close by, tried it a few times. Bad service: receptionist guy seems to always be in a bad mood. Raw fish didn't seem to be chilled properly, orders smelled more fishy than it should. I can say this because I eat a lot of sushi. I gave this place a couple more tries even after getting turned off a few times already. Same thing everytime."}
{"text":"Larry is the best sushi Chef in Vegas, just let him create his magic and it will blow you away."}
{"text":"This is probably the most decent sushi restaurant in the area since the Nagoya location on Rainbow closed down and if you want to avoid the wait time at Oyshi. My one gripe, although minor, is that they don't offer mochi ice cream as part of the AYCE. They do offer regular ice cream, which is fine, but even the crappiest of AYCE sushi places offer mochi."}
{"text":"This is all you can eat sushi restaurant. And did we eat a lot! We sat at the bar watching the chef making of every sushi that we ate.  It cannot get any fresher that this. Everything we had was very good. They have a lot to choose from. All you can eat deal is better then order each roll individually. It was fun talking to the guy making sushi. It was like in the movie \"Lost in Translation\" BTW we love that movie!!! Everything was delicious, place was not crowded did not have to wait for next roll. Sake was very good too. Price was affordable for all you can eat. At the peak hour they get busy but not overly busy. Owner handed \"membership card\" and if you eat 10x you get 11 for free. We are going back for sure."}
{"text":"This place isn't a dive, it's just a bit dingy...but not in an unsanitary way. 

The food here is good, very comparable to sushi in Toronto except the miso soup was a bit salty and the table top soy sauce was EXTREMELY salty!!

Prices were OK, some things were a bit expensive compared to other sushi restaurants. 

Service was very, very friendly! Each staff member including the sushi chef greeted us when we we walked through the front door!"}
{"text":"Super friendly and FAST sushi chefs. Also delicious sushi with an afordable all you can eat menu. win-win!"}
{"text":"I honestly give this place a 3.7 but what the hell, I'll round (lolz).

I've been coming to Inaka Sushi for awhile now. The sushi is delicious! If your a fan of nigiri like I am, you'll love it here. The fish always tastes fresh and the oils on the tuna, tastes amazing. My all time favorite roll there is the Hello Kitty roll =) If you have a small group the service is good and the place is clean.

What keeps me from giving this place a complete 4 or 5 is because of the service. The first time I came here was with a group of friends (there was 6 of us). The place was already packed for dinner so the wait time was about 15 min. When they gave us a table, it was in a corner with it's own little \"cove\", it looked like they just stuck a table there so that we wouldn't have to wait long. But since I've been back that table is purposely there. So guess it's good for some privacy. Anyways, the lady that was serving us was really friendly and fun but she kept for getting our orders (drinks and ice cream) good thing you have to check off what sushi you want on paper or she might forget that too! Maybe its cause we were in the corner or the place was pack, and granted there were only 2 waitresses for the whole place but we were forgotten most of the time. We were barely checked on and it took awhile for someone to get our orders.

Despite my first time here, I come back for the sushi, with my boyfriend or a small group. The service is better."}
{"text":"We stumble upon this place when the wait at another sushi place was too long, and boy am I glad we did.  Kinda a hole in the wall but wow!!! The girls keep our table clear, never an empty plate left, and the sushi is great.  All you can eat menu has a good assortment of rolls, and everything seems very fresh!!  Allen is an awesome sushi chef, give geanerous pieces of fish were some places cut them super thin.  I will continue to go back and love it!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty consistent. 

The fish and rolls are good, fresh. I have a few favorites, like the happy ending which has slices of fresh lemon inside of it. The Cajun rolls, and garlic albacore are also delicious. 

However, they are also consistent in forgetting parts of your order. Every time I come and sit at a table, at least two rolls are never delivered. So I recommend sitting at the bar if it's available and convenient for you (and your party). 

I also feel that the service is better at the bar. The waitress who has been there the last few times has been a little rude."}
{"text":"Wow, this place was shockingly expensive. It's like they added $5 over what would be a reasonable price to each item. 

Tape worms don't have day jobs, how the hell am I supposed to afford two pieces of tuna for $7?!  I also had a pretty basic kani maki, and they're charging $5 for some rice and fake crab. Sad!

The server was impatient and not all that accommodating.

Nice decor though."}
{"text":"On my search for great sushi in the Henderson area, my friend and I went to Inaka to cross it off our list.  I have to admit I was wary when I saw the $20.00 all you can eat sign, but with reservations clouding overhead we entered.  To our surprise the sushi was great and the service excellent.  We went into full pig-out mode as the first round of sushi was terrific, in our dizzy enthusiasm we accidentally ordered 2 more additional rolls when we still had 2 more coming.  Yes it was pleasure and pain mixed together just like Thanksgiving.  And yes as true sushi slut the Japanese lasagna roll was beyond taste euphoria!

Not only do you get all you can eat sushi with a great selection but you also get a large warm sake.  But be aware of the rules, you have 1 hour to consume your sushi and be careful not to order to much because you have to pay for what is leftover. Yes our waitress had to come over to our table and plead with us to eat more.  All the rolls were good and I loved the cucumber salad.  Also this special only runs Monday through Thursday."}
{"text":"So... This place is the closer sushi joint to my house, and I've been coming here for the past 6 years. Sometimes I'd be on a sushi spree and have all you can eat weekly. I've been on a hiatus after experiencing other sushi joints in my neighborhood. My friends that I've taken here have said that it isn't as good as others, and of course I had to try it out. 

After I while I decided to come back here because it was always my fav to come to eat alone, since it isn't that crowded. I arrived 30 min till close with my mind set on getting a couple happy hour rolls. The hostess, which I think is also the owner/manager, greets me and asks if I want all you can eat or happy hour. For some reason I hesitated, then she says \"probably happy hour because all you can eat will only be for 15 mins\". I'm kind of thinking.. Why did you ask then, but glad she kept me aware. I ordered two mountain rolls and an order of tempura. My total was the same as all you can eat pricing.... What's happy about this hour??? I can order more rolls at a place without happy hour and be cheaper and better food. 

Mountain rolls are my favorite here, I discovered this before I ventured off into sashimi. I know they take time to make because they are baked... Didn't mind this. When I received the rolls however, they looked rushed. I didn't take a picture, wish I did, because I felt that I needed to hurry up and leave. Presentation isn't everything... But it helps. As I was eating them, they don't taste as good as I remember. Almost seem over cooked, and we're falling apart. 

I get that I came in later than I would normally... But I've never had an experience like this here. Maybe it has something to do with the experience I've had at other joints in the area since. 

All in all... My friends were right. It isn't good sushi. Guess I won't be coming here again."}
{"text":"Great experience! I had the spicy chicken plate that came with rice, miso soup and side salad which was delicious. Our server and the chef were great as well. Looking at all the negative comments about the customer service makes me assume those customers are uncultured. Don't let the ratings fool you, it's a must try!"}
{"text":"I'm from San Diego and was up in Las Vegas for the weekend.  We were on Yelp.com and looking for some nice Sushi place.  Many of the places didn't open until 5pm on Sunday and we were stuck driving around until we found Inaka Sushi.  We didn't know anything about the place but we decided just to go in since they were open.

I'll talk about the bad things later but I have to say I love this place and the food.

I decided to pay $20(lunch) for all you can eat sushi.  You must eat everything you order or else you'll be charged for the leftovers.  You also must eat within an hour.  I love the Americanized rolls so you can take this review as-is. The one thing I always look for in a sushi place is the Philadelphia Roll.   This place made the best tasting sushi I've had.  The fish wasn't room temperature.  It was cool and tasted fresh.  I then tried the Mountain Roll(Baked Salmon on California Roll with Mayo) tasted pretty good as well.   I also had the best Spider Roll(Soft Shell Crab Roll) here.  The crab was crunchy and taste pretty good.   I ended up having another order of Philadelphia Roll before I called it quits.  I had the green tea ice cream and it was also one of the best tasting i've had. 

The bad:
The Philadelphia Roll went for $9.99 for 8 pieces.  The pieces were bit on the small side but they were good.  Many of the rolls above are over $10.  The ice cream was $3.00 for one scoop.  If you going to go here, I suggest you do the all-you-can-eat because just ordering it a-la-carte isn't worth it.  Lunch is $20 and Dinner is $24.  If you're eatting over $20 worth of food, then this place is definitely awesome to go to.  

I had a lemonade and it cost me $4.50.  I don't know about you but even if  I get unlimited refills, $4.50 is definitely not worth it for me.  Stick to water imo.

Other than that, I love the place and will be coming back.  The people were nice and we even had a nice small chat to the waitress about where we were from.  Everytime someone came in, the chef knew their name so I am assuming this place gets alot of regulars.  If I didn't live 5 hours away, I would be a regular too."}
{"text":"The food was good and the AYCE price ($19.95 for lunch) was great! But, the waiter was super rude and barely spoke to us while waiting on us. Not a reason to stay away, but steer clear on slower days when there's only one waiter (it's a super tiny restaurant, but not uncomfortably so)."}
{"text":"Mediocre fish. Super small portions.  Bland.  No atmosphere.  Good service though."}
{"text":"As I got there I noticed my friend and I were the only customers in the restaurant. I figured since we live about a mile away we should try out and support our neighborhood Sushi Restaurant. I've been to many AYCE sushi places in the valley and this is the worst of them all. 
I ordered NIgiri, Salmon, Yellowtail, Spicy Tuna, Halibut and Tuna. The only fresh fish I got of the bunch was the Salmon!!!!! The Spicy Tuna tasted and smelled very bad. I took one bight and nearly wanted to VOMIT! The Halibut was also spoiled!!!! I can't believe they would serve such old disgusting fish. When I complained about the fish and it's very potent smell, the waitress then confronted the Chef. He looked at me as I was stupid. He then took some of the Spicy Tuna with his hand and shoved it in his mouth! Thereafter saying that, \"You're crazy! You probably don't know what good fish is! Everyone that ate it today said it was great!\" I figured that everyone couldn't have been more than one person.... I didn't eat any more sushi and ordered a Miso soup which wasn't bad. Obviously you can't really mess up MISO. I didn't complain after the first time and kept my mouth shut. They don't want input on their food so I had to put it on here. I paid my bill and left a 10% tip. I work in the service industry and I know how bad it is when you get stiffed. 
Please take my advice. Don't eat here! The service is just as bad as the food.  In a competitive market like Las Vegas service and quality is very important. There at Inaka I will never go back. It's not worth getting sick over spoiled fish in my opinion."}
{"text":"First time I came here was over ten years ago. I loved this place was as loyal as could be. The quality and the employees have gone down hill. The waiter is as rude as people say he is. I will never come here again and am saddened that they let this place go."}
{"text":"We eat here all the time now. There food is as good or better than any place in the city. It's an odd location but well worth the drive."}
{"text":"I have been going to Inaka for over 7 years. Management has never been especially friendly, but tonight I found out Thomas and Larry - the best sushi chefs in Vegas, don't work there anymore. 
The owner and the new chef served me at the bar and there was not one single roll that was made correctly. Not one!
They were sloppy, falling apart, drenched with sauce, some of them had the WRONG sauces and ingredients. 
Long story short - I will never go back."}
{"text":"Here's an update to my review! The sushi chef commented on my review saying that my boyfriend ordered all you can eat. If you see my original review you will read that we told three different employees NO to all you can eat MULTIPLE TIMES and they still tried to charge us for it. 

He also commented on my review saying my boyfriend was drunk. EXCUSE ME?! Neither of us had anything to drink whatsoever until we got there and ordered a beer. We were not drunk. 

Maybe the service was awkward cause it was empty and they didn't know what else to do but stare at us. 

This place is just a bit ridiculous. Try it out if you know nothing about sushi and you might like it."}
{"text":"This place is more for the SW Vegas locals. 

It is never crowded and the service is always fast. 

As for the sushi it's good, but one could find better. Not bad for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Terrible. Over priced and not that good. I've tried it a couple times. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Errr...stumbled upon this sushi place on a afternoon bike ride. AYCE Sushi is $20. It was only me and my friend in the whole establishment. Not busy at all. 

DO: Sit at the bar when it's not busy so you'll get the chef's attention.
DON'T: eat here unless you're very very very hungry.

PROS: Service A+
CONS: Food, too much rice for their nigiris!"}
{"text":"The food is great . But the service are worst  . the workers has lack of experience , they dont know how to treat customers . DEFINITELY 1 STAR FOR ALL OF YOU"}
{"text":"Decent priced all-you-can-eat and great saki specials (weekdays). The atmosphere is a little drab though. And the music was a trip down memory lane, ha!"}
{"text":"One of the best Japanese cuisine experiences you will get in the GTA. Beautiful interior, service is the best I have ever experienced anywhere, extending beyond the food industry (it is also consistent...recently had my fourth visit). The sushi you will get here is fresh and some of the best, which explains some of the more costly pieces. Best white tuna I have ever had. This place offers an authentic experience, it sure is a treat to go there."}
{"text":"My husband and I went in for lunch on a Tuesday. We were the only people in the restaurant so the service was beyond great. The chef kept making us special little tastes of fish that were fresh and delicious. Definitely will be going back again!"}
{"text":"Came here for the all you can eat sushi.. I know what good sushi is, and I've been to many great places.... I kind of wish I read the reviews before coming here. The rolls are as dry as their service. They remind me of the sushi rolls they make at grocery stores. Not worth the price at all. They didn't even have roles with no rice for people who are to that liking. I only gave 2 stars because they compensated the rice thing with not putting too much in. 

I apologize if the workers see this - this should be a sign that maybe to change some things up a bit. The goal is to get people to come to the restaurant. Sure enough, when we went, it was empty. 

Overall experience was 3/10. Not sure if I would ever come back."}
{"text":"Yelp has had Inaka Sushi at about a 2.5 star rating for as long as I can remember and I had no plans of going here but since I had some time to kill and skipped lunch I figured why not. There were some decent items but also some poorly made items.

Let me go from good to bad

The Salmon Kama was perfect. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/inaka-sushi-las-vegas?select=mGxF9VycMweaT8yX91vQLw#mGxF9VycMweaT8yX91vQLw Seasoned and cooked perfectly I should've ordered more of this. Having had Salmon Kama at a lot of the good AYCE sushi spots it was maybe best done here.

The Salmon Skin Handroll was good. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/inaka-sushi-las-vegas?select=BWxE9Xk3pUOlb79Rg5G1GQ#BWxE9Xk3pUOlb79Rg5G1GQ Almost as good as Blue Fin Sushi at least the salmon skin was crispy to my liking but smaller. Again I should've ordered more of this.

The Green Mussels were good. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/inaka-sushi-las-vegas?select=SgY609FWYyumxdK3nHdyBg#SgY609FWYyumxdK3nHdyBg The mussels were separated from the shell, baked up with some mayo sauce, and served in a large hot shell-like container, it could've been a real shell but I don't know. I'd eat it again, can't say no to baked mayo things.

The Fried Aged Tofu was good http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/inaka-sushi-las-vegas?select=BWxE9Xk3pUOlb79Rg5G1GQ#TFitLA0VBCRzNXenjCgI-A and simple. It was served hot so let it cool down a bite, I burnt my mouth after the first bite.

The Leo #2 roll wasn't that great http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/inaka-sushi-las-vegas?select=qZgA2rEBe0t46SRX_EfzTw#qZgA2rEBe0t46SRX_EfzTw It was filled with shrimp tempura and jalapeno and covered with eel sauce, spicy mayo, and tempura flakes. Way to much tempura flakes and spicy mayo wasn't spicy if anything it tasted just like mayo.

The nigiris for most parts were bad. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/inaka-sushi-las-vegas?select=BxkesQEfcsvHjYZY78f2AQ#BxkesQEfcsvHjYZY78f2AQ The tamago was OK, the uni was hard for me to eat, the other 3 in the pic wasn't so good in quality. The oysters wasn't that great and shrimp was pretty bad seemed old http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/inaka-sushi-las-vegas?select=BWxE9Xk3pUOlb79Rg5G1GQ#BWxE9Xk3pUOlb79Rg5G1GQ After seeing how the freshness and quality of the nigiris were I started ordering non-sushi items.

Customer service was OK. Spacious place but no one was really there maybe one other person. It's the only sushi place in the area but I'd drive farther if I was craving sushi."}
{"text":"I could eat Sushi every day of my life and not get tired of it but Inaka is the only place I go. The food is crazy good (I'm sorry about all of your bad experiences) and Leo is the sweetest guy ever. I always bring my friends here and I wouldn't go somewhere else if I had the choice."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place!!! They have great rolls, delicious sauces, tasty sushi!!! Their teriyaki chicken is one of the best!!! This is my favorite spot for sushi!!! I'm so glad they're close to home and I can meet up with my friends here for a delicious dinner!!! Also a nice seating environment! :)"}
{"text":"Sad, sad. New to the area and was hoping to find a decent Japanese restaurant. I had sashimi, sushi and spicy salmon rolls. Very disappointed. Maybe people are reviewing this place based on the cooked dishes which I did not try."}
{"text":"So my girlfriend and I literally live right by this place. We have gone multiple times but I said I wanted to try other sushi places. I've tried a 5 star sushi AYCE and the service was good the first time but expensive and horrible the second. Another sushi place got my girlfriend sick because the sushi chef had a cold ( not good ). Every time I try a new sushi place I always come back to this one because they are the best to me and my girlfriend. And they have smoked salmon which is a must. They are never busy and always attentive. I have never gotten sick and have gotten great service from here!"}
{"text":"Amazing service all the time!!! Very fast with Quality food!!, my favorite is the Dragon and Inaka Roll along with the Ahi Poke. Mm. Def gotta try. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I have been here many times but not in a few years.  The quality has gone down.  The sushi is not top grade and one of my rolls had refrigerated rice."}
{"text":"This place sucks!  I have been to many many sushi places.  The sushi chef has issues.  I asked the server if I could order a special roll and she said yes no problem.  I have ordered this roll in a lot of places.  One place even said they were going to put it on the menu. The chef took care of everyone else in restaurant many times (including people that came in after me and the others at my table).  Almost an hour later I got a roll that was not what I asked for.  If they didn't want to do a special request then they should have just said so.  I would have respected that but not his passive-aggressive behavior.  The place was hot.  They had a box fan sitting on one of the tables.  The yellow tail was not fresh. And the chef doesn't do good sticky rice.  I will not go back."}
{"text":"We came here because of the stellar reviews you see below, but although the food was good it wasn't amazing. I've had better, and service was loooong. Prices were inflated a little, but could be because I am used to city prices for about the same quality of food. I'm flip flopping between giving the place a 3 or 2 star. 

Thursday evening, and they were busy. There were lots of running around and I believe it's due to the poor layout of their restaurant. The majority of the tables were on the left side, and the kitchen and prep area is all the way on the opposite side. There are a few tables along the way, but 80% of them were on the other side. Lots of running around, and I think the two servers would be alleviated by having a prep station more centrally located. 

Aside from that, we came in and was seated quickly but it wasn't until 20 mins later, we got any tea or were spoken to. I know this because I checked in. 
The waitress finally came to us, and gave us tea and took our order. She did tell us that they were very busy and the order might come to us slowly. 

The wait for food wasn't that bad. We got appetizers (Fried Calamari - simple tasting but complemented by the tempura dipping sauce) and she gave us some fried fish complimentary (not sure if it was for everyone, or special just for us). There was also miso soup and salad. 

We shared a bento (Kalbi bento with tempura, california rolls and salad) and a sashimi platter (14 pieces). 

The Sashimi dish was about $1 a piece. Cut in good sized portions I was extremely disappointed that when I bit into it, it had not thawed enough and was still very cold. 

The Kalbi bento (yes they some korean dishes like kalbi, bulgogi and jap chae) was decent. The meat was tasty and marinated well. Tempura was good too. The California Roll seems a little weird. No cucumber but only a piece of lettuce. 

For dessert we got small little ice cream profiteroles. Frozen solid. 

Dinner was about $30 per person, but like I said, same quality in downtown Toronto would be half that. 

I might be a little harsh, but part of me wished we had gone to the grill in town. Nonetheless, the place is bustling with people! So don't shoot the messenger, this is just my opinion."}
{"text":"Horrible service when I tried to make a take out order. It was close to closing and he rejected my order. This in unacceptable service. Even though it is one minute away from my house I refuse to give these people my money. You need to make your customers feel like priority. I will be sure to tell all of my friends to stay away. I'm sure this place won't last very long in this area."}
{"text":"This is our favorite sushi place in the Las Vegas valley, great fresh all you can eat sushi. The prices are pretty affordable and on some nights you get hot sake included with you meal. Defiantly give it a try."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The sushi is better than anything I've had in Toronto. It is so fresh and totally delicious. The staff are sweet as can be. It's such a pleasure coming here."}
{"text":"Great service and all you can eat! They have competitive pricing comparable to other AYCE places on this side of town. They are certainly the fastest AYCE place I have been to as far as service goes and whenever I sit at the sushi bar the sushi chef always makes small talk and asks what you like so he can create some fancy pieces for you to try. He is incredibly talented but also really friendly! I usually stop in by myself since my fiancé doesn't eat sushi and I have not once felt uncomfortable dining here on my own. They always make you feel welcome. Great job Inaka, keep it up and I'll see you next time for some of those custom/personalized plates!"}
{"text":"Chinese owned sushi bar that is all about cutting costs and not about any sense of pride in their food.

My Chinese girlfriend and I have gone to Inaka three times over the course of five years. The deal is it is in the neighborhood so I REALLY want to like this place!

This place has been consistently over-priced, low-quality sushi! The first time we went there my girl-friend swore that they swapped out eel-sauce with maple syrup! Today the miso soup was... honestly, I am not sure what it was... The salad tasted like it had some ranch dressing variant. The sashimi lunch special for $14.95 was about half the amount of other places - thin, had a weird sauce on the salmon, and one piece tasted partially frozen. The cucumber was cheap? How can cucumber be cheap?

We actually had okay service today, but last couple times the waitress had to pull herself away from the Chinese programs on TV to check on us...

I am praying that Mountain's Edge grows up with some shopping centers so a real sushi bar be built in our neighborhood. 

For now I suggest: 808 Sushi on Durango, Ohjah Japanese Steakhouse Sushi & Hibachi off Blue Diamond, Sawa Sushi in the Kohl's Shopping Center, or Kazuki Sushi in Southern Highlands. If you would notice, that is EVERY sushi bar in the area except Inaka Sushi."}
{"text":"Average food. Lack presentation, ingenuity, and tasty. Taste like something I've picked up from a grocery store."}
{"text":"Great food, lots to choose from even if you don't like sushi. The service was good. No complaints at all."}
{"text":"I've been twice, having gotten their all-you-can-eat menu both times. Each time it was well worth my money, as my companions and I took out quite a few rolls, appetizers, soups and ngiri.

Their food in general isn't heads-and-shoulders above other sushi places I've dined at, but it was all good and left me satisfied. Their unagi roll and other eel-based rolls were all excellent, but the spider roll wans't quite as spicy as just about every other spider roll I've had.

The service was a bit of a mixed bag. They were very prompt and courteous, however they have a penchant for missing items ordered on our menu, as it has happened both times I've been. This isn't a huge issue, but it's an oversight nonetheless.

For a neighborhood sushi place, Inaka is a pretty good spot. They don't beat out the other places in Vegas that have really great sushi, but with such an affordable and good all-you-can-eat menu, I wouldn't recommend passing them up if you're just looking for sushi that's close-by that's good."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of friends since the AYCE sushi we'd planned on going to was closed. We were not impressed. 

Pros: They got the food to us pretty fast. (Of course we were the only ones there).
I thought the gyoza was better than some I've had. My husband really liked the salmon collar (I think that's what it was)

Cons: Sweet shrimp looked shriveled?? Maybe it had been frozen. I wouldn't know. But, husband forced it down. Everything else was pretty \"meh\" That was the consensus of our group of sushi-lovers. Also, the server seemed to be rushing us. When we were filling out the sushi form, he came and asked if we were done yet. He kept checking to see if we still wanted the rest of the rolls that we ordered, and mentioned that more people had come in. We didn't complain about anything once. 

I didn't try much. I ate the vegetarian roll. It was supposed to have avocado in it, but barely had any. It's vegetables! Why skimp on the avocado for a veg. roll? The other rolls didn't look very appetizing to me, so I didn't bother. 

 I'm not the biggest seafood/ sushi fan. I can only eat so much of it before I get tired of eating it. If it's really fresh, and well-made, then yes, I'll try it. But if it seems less than fresh, or not great in quality, then I won't bother."}
{"text":"It's the most convenient AYCE sushi restaurant in the Henderson/Anthem area.  Overall, not a bad place and I'd come again.  But not my favorite in the city.  I'd rather go farther for better.  

The space is clean and spacious.  Authentic Japanese kimonos and artwork line the walls.  

It wasn't busy on the Mother's Day holiday that I went (~25% filled at any given time), but families did come so it was steady.  However, saying that, there should be no excuse as to why we didn't get better service.  We were missing utensils/straws/salad orders and when we reminded the server, he seemed annoyed.  They didn't clear our table as quickly as they brought the food so at one point, we ended up with a few empty dishes cluttering our table.  When we got the check, he had incorrectly charged us more tax than was required.  It's a lot of little things that could have been prevented if someone had been paying more attention.  

The food is delicious and that would be the only reason I'd come back.  My favorites were the Pacific Roll, Hello Kitty Roll, and the Bonzai Roll (if you like sweet + spicy sriracha).  The cucumber salad was disappointing and didn't taste as fresh and crisp as I'm used to.  Free refills for soda are a plus.  

Overall, not a bad experience.  The food balanced the mediocre service.  I'd come again but I'd be coming back more strict."}
{"text":"I've never been here and just stopped because we were hungry and just happen to be driving by a sushi joint that offered AYCE.  We figured why not?  I was actually pretty impressed.  

 What we demolished:

*  Shrimp Tempura - Not my fav.  It had a bit of a weird taste.  Nonetheless still good.
*  Shumai - these were deep fried and were heavy.
*  Yum Yum Roll -  Yum Yum indeed!
*  Sugar Dad Roll -  I accidentally ordered this, but it was good!
* Spider Roll - a classic favorite.  How can you mess this one up?
* Sake Nigiri -  The freshest fish in town.  Seriously it was amazing!!!!!
* Harry Potter Roll - Very vinegary in taste.  Jade and I were not impressed.
* Pacific Roll -  Coconut and Sushi.. whaaaa??  I definitely will order this again!

Pros:
 *  They had a few interesting specialty rolls (such as the Pacific Roll). Plus!
 *  Very clean interior and friendly staff
 * Stamp card available !
 * Seriously the freshest Salmon!  Thick cut and Fresh!
 *  I loved their presentation & how they combine numerous orders on 1 plate.

Cons:
 *  Parking can be a pain.
 *  Harry Potter Roll & Shumai in my opinion were a no go.

Overall:
  This place could have given me super crappy service and have overcharge me on AYCE,  but serving me Sake Nigiri of this quality would still give them a 5 star!  I'm really picky with my Sake Nigiri (my fav) and seriously this place had the freshest I have ever tried! Jade and I are pretty big fans of Sushi and I think I can speak for the both of us by saying we definitely recommend this place to others.

Tips:
  * have some Sake Nigiri!
  *  Experiment with their Specialty Rolls.  
  * Just in case they forget, make sure to ask for their Stamp Card."}
{"text":"Pros:
-Only a 2 minute drive from my house 
-Very fresh nigiri
-During their happy hour, AYCE comes with free sake or beer!
-Very fast service

Cons:
-The people working here don't seem to be the happiest. A small group of people came in while we were dining and they've never done AYCE before, so they had A LOT of questions and the sushi chef seemed to get very irritated fast

Verdict:
I absolutely LOVE their Salma Kama! You get a very large piece of perfectly seasoned, tasty Salmon (http://s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Jq6hPiOvqVuR6m8ajZzaSw/l.jpg). I also really like that they give you hot sake or beer with AYCE during happy hour."}
{"text":"Love my neighborhood sushi joint.  Fast and friendly service.  They're very generous on the bento boxes. My favorite."}
{"text":"My husband and I frequent this place often since it's just down the street from us. We have had ok service and good AYCE experiences. I do wish they had more of an upbeat atmosphere. It's decent and price is the same as others in town."}
{"text":"I went there and had the AYCE. I sat at the sushi bar and it was spacious. I ordered the shrimp tempura and they were crunchy and hot. I had some yellow tail, mackerel, and tuna nigiri and they just okThe service was excellent. They were attentive the whole time maybe because they weren't that busy yet on a Friday at around 6 pm. I ordered more shrimp tempura. I tried the spider roll and who's your daddy and they were delicious. I also had some salmon skin and unagi hand roll and they were good. I had the green tea ice cream for the finale and it was ok. Overall my experience was great."}
{"text":"Very fresh and extremely yummy! The all you can eat rocks. Spider & shrimp tempura rolls are my fave. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Sushi was okay.  $24 for all you can eat sushi. We got a few rolls immediately but then it took them 45 minutes to bring the rest of the sushi. You only have one hour so we couldnt order anything else. Worse, Most of the sushi they brought to the table was not what we ordered.  They dont refill your drinks and generally have bad service. Beware!"}
{"text":"Great sushi place. Every dish we ordered was great. Got some spicy sushi. Great ones. Not disappointed in the spice level."}
{"text":"We went here the other night, despite the 3 star yelp rating- hoping for the best.
Yick.
The AYCE was reasonably priced- I'll give them that but- the quality of the fish was horrible.  I felt like I was eating sushi from Albertsons.
The miso soup had like, pureed snippets of seaweed and teensy bits of tofu.  The spicy tuna was DEFINITELY prepared in advance and had very little tuna in it.  The rolls themselves had very, very small filling and lots of too sweet rice.
I think I am equally disappointed because its SO close to my home...I'm on the hunt for a great local sushi and...my hunt continues.
That will teach me for going against Yelp recommendations!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and amazing food!! Private booths provided, which is kind of cool. Defiantly give them a 5 star rating. Also, everyone at this location is super nice!!"}
{"text":"Not the best AYCE sushi place in Vegas. 
The one waitress seemed like she didn't want to be there. It's work, we know but that's just bad customer service. 
Also don't get the  shumai(spchek). Tasted like it was the frozen kind. My gf spit it out and wrapped it up in a tissue, then put the last two pieces in another tissue and slipped it into my pocket so we didn't have to eat it. Threw it away right after we left.
Quick tip: don't get all the nigiri or rollsin one order, they will put them all together and if you get any with sauces such as the garlic sauce or teriyaki sauce, they will mix into the other rolls. Idk about some but I like my nigiri without a sauce unless I plan on dipping it into some soy sauce. 
It gets two stars cause the chefs called the waitress to help us. Or else it would've gotten one."}
{"text":"Worst Sushi in Vegas, Might as well served the sushi in a bowl with the amount of rice that they are putting in sushi. The rice is not fully cooked so some parts are hard and at the same time it's very mushy. How can a Sushi place serve out food like that? I would never go back to this place."}
{"text":"Don't bother. Unless you enjoy eating large balls of rice with tiny fish on top. I get that rice is the way all you eat sushi can make a profit but this place takes it to the extreme. We came on a Saturday and the place was dead. There is a reason why."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch on Tuesday with some friends for all you can eat. We ended up going here because we live around the area & didn't have much time to eat before work. We were the only ones in the restaurant & I could sense the server behind us waiting to take our plates away when we would finish our rolls :P Anyway, the sushi chef was very friendly, told us to come back for dinner because they have certain rolls that's for the dinner menu only. They also have beer & sake specials Mon-Thu night. They do NOT offer those cards where you get to eat free after x amount of times. The price is about $22 for lunch, not bad at all since the specialty rolls are around $10 each.

The sushi was decent, nothing out of the ordinary. We had all you can eat sushi & if you order soy paper for your rolls it's an extra $1. The shrimp tempura was good, my friend ordered it as an appetizer & I had it in a few of my rolls. I had the seaweed salad for an appetizer & the serving was a good size. No complaints from me! I'll be back again since I can't have meat on Fridays during Lent :D

btw I think they changed their hours & stay open only until 11pm daily.  the hours on their chopsticks say 1 or 2am? yup."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE. Let's just start with the waiter/host actually followed me into the parking lot and rudely asked me why I did not leave a tip (b/c the service was beyond terrible), then when I told him why, he actually threw a temper tantrum and slammed the entry door behind him as he went back inside. 
But here we go... We were regulars here ALL the time (for about 10 years) and loved it! We raved about it to friends and family. Recently it seems they have switched management; new chefs, owner, host, etc. And now, they are SO rude. Not only that, the food has gone down hill, and the prices went up. It's not as fresh. I EVEN GOT SICK ONCE (about a month ago)! No joke! A place that used to be crowded has completely slowed down. I kept giving it another try hoping it would get better, but it hasn't :( worse every time and more rude service every time. It pains me to never again go back to a place I genuinely loved and spent a lot of money at."}
{"text":"Today was great. The food was awesome & service was nice!! Friendly and helpful!! I love this place"}
{"text":"This place was not very good.  

Chinese owned and run, the sushi chefs are very nice and good service.  

Unfortunately the fish isn't very good.  Tried just about every piece of fish they offered and the only thing I would even consider eating again was the salmon and maybe the uni.  Usually these types of places make up for bad fish with creative rolls and we tried a few but didn't like any of them.  There were two that were supposed to be spicy but not even slightly..."}
{"text":"Food was okay, nothing to brag about. Miso soup was good, Ginger salad was a miss at it was served with a Ginger Mayonnaise sauce that was basically Mayonnaise. I ordered the chicken teriyaki which was basically a chicken breast smothered in teriyaki sauce. I've definitely had better for the price."}
{"text":"I made the mistake of going back. I just got home and literally insta-vom'd.

Fuck my life, what a bad choice.

Also, the place still smells like farts. I can't believe I actually went back.

You know what, five stars because this place is great if you want to lose weight. One star because you become anorexic for 2 days post-sushi."}
{"text":"Came here for a to go order. I live in the area and was tired of the usual sandwich shops and bar food. I ordered the shumai and the spicy tuna roll. The Shumai were tiny (think the frozen stuff you find at the grocery store). I wasn't all to impressed with the sushi either. It was ok for a quick fix but I probably won't be back. I'll gladly drive a few more minutes for better sushi."}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi. Went with a friend for lunch. $19.95 all you can eat special. Quick service. Friendly staff. Their spicy sauce wasn't that spicy. TNT roll was the best. The yellow tail and red snapper sushi was really good."}
{"text":"It's not the cleanest place. The fish is very much stale and not fresh at all. They have two people working. One making the food one taking orders. One hour limit for all you can eat. Meaning barely come to your table so they don't have to take your order and take their sweet as time. I would avoid this place if I were you. This is not a place I recommend at all unless you want to loose five pounds by getting a stomach flue."}
{"text":"This is my first time ate sushi here.Everything was so good?The fish was fresh?sevrice was good?I can't believe I could spend such a low price to eat such fresh fish and many kinds of rolls?I really recommend this restaurant?"}
{"text":"Our family enjoys the all you can eat!
Good variety and selection. We especially like their Harry Potter roll. Come hungry, leave full and satisfied!

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Tried it for the first time last month and have already been back 3 times. Quality is great,  service is great!  Prices are a little high but I know I'm getting quality.  Try it,  you'll like it!"}
{"text":"This place was highly recommended to me by a friend. I have been meaning to try it again. I had eaten here once several years ago. 
Food is good... Sushi was fresh & tasted good. I would definitely recommend that no one order the garlic edamame as it was inedible, but other than that every thing else that we ordered was fine.  As far as sushi goes Octopus was really good, eel, white fish & yellow tail were great! ... Boyfriend said the sea urchin was the best he's had... I couldn't try it.... Maybe if it had been in a roll or something ... But just with rice & wrapped no thanks. 
For rolls the Japanese Lasagna was OK... Boyfriend didn't prefer it (so what - more for me) although almost every piece I had fell apart... But what can you do. We both really liked the Kiss the Ass Roll & Leo #3 (daily special), and sec on the beach. Our absolute favorite was the Unagi roll.  Delicious! 

As far as service that's where things get a little sloppy. For the most part we received everything we asked for... Although I did all for lemon for my water & was basically told no, until my boyfriend asked them he finally brought me some.  Neither sushi Chef nor waiter smiled at either of us even once during our entire visit, and I was going out of my way to be extremely nice. I said thank you about 40 times. It was kind of ridiculous. Twice the sushi Chef just kind of grunted our way when we ordered something new. Also we arrived around 2pm, lunch AYCE goes until 3,  but we were charged for the dinner AYCE. We didn't complain because we ordered a lot, but something to keep an eye on. 

I'm not saying we won't be back, but they're are a lot of sushi places on Eastern that have great quality fish & pleasant staff. Pull it together, Inaka!"}
{"text":"We had lunch here yesterday before we headed up to Mt. Charleston for some snow and fresh air. We got there right when they opened at 11:30 and we were the first ones in. The sushi was fresh and the service was very good. Spideman roll was fresh and tasty with a good soft shell crab inside. Caterpillar roll, Spicy tuna roll was perfect and we really enjoyed the sushi overall and ordered the garlic tuna twice because it was very fresh and delicious. $19.95 a person for lunch and a few dollars for the drinks is a great deal. The only flaw is the wasabi, it was very mild and a not a single wasabi \"buzz\" the whole time, might have to bring my own tube next time!
We'll be back more often, we don't live that far away. Good job Inaka Sushi!"}
{"text":"I've come here over the last several years through all the management and chef changes. It does have ups and downs but generally the food tastes great and the service is reliable!! Definitely recommend it to try the all you can eat!!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good but the staff are a bunch of freaking idiot's.  Not friendly at all."}
{"text":"Food was decent. My friends thought it was great, but then again they were high. Service was decent, atmosphere was decent. If your desperate it's a great place. Worth checking out, especially if you're drunk or high"}
{"text":"Not fresh, just don't bother. Stale! Service is bad the vibe is meh and I'm like 30 steps from it, what a shame!"}
{"text":"I have to say this place is very meh.  It is a tiny place, the waiter was super cool quiet nothing super special.  Their hot foods were not on par with any of the sushi places around here.  I must say it was very very difficult eating those seafood rangoon.  Super dry and the flavors were not something i wanted.  The sushi was ok.  The nigiri is decent, their rolls were not so great.  Not too much of a selection of items, the price is good though.  I would rather go to some of the other sushi places around the area for the better quality and selection."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places in town by far. All depends on what type of sushi u enjoy but so far almost everything I've gotten has been amazing. I go 1 to 2 times a week."}
{"text":"I am going down one star because of the waiter. I LOVE this place. The sushi is always fresh. The sushi chefs know my boyfriend and I so we barely even order. He knows exactly what to start us off with. 

The male waiter is always rude. I always sit at the sushi bar because I never want to deal with him. I was there last night and gave him my card and stamp card for Inaka. I was there less than a week ago. He charged me for my free one and gives me back my card. I asked him why he didn't use my free one. He said \"Oh no worries. Just come in and we will give it to you next time\". What the hell. I handed it to him like always for him to use it this time. I have been going here for years. I wish they would of kept the female waitress. She was always in a good mood, never had issues like this, and overall made the experience enjoyable. 

If you go here, make sure you sit at the bar. The sushi chefs are AWESOME and always enjoyable when it comes to the experience. Avoid as much contact at possible with the tall male waiter."}
{"text":"Its a great place to have AYCE, friendly staff and comfortable atmosphere. Sushi rolls are juicy enough to be drooling;)) the only reason not to give it 5 star is there nothing like special special about this place comparing to others. Anyways its a good place!!!"}
{"text":"Very average. Nothing special, nothing bad. For sushi, they give you a tiny ball of rice with a generously sliced thick piece of fish, which is something I liked but the taste didn't blow my mind off or anything. Quick, friendly service. Kinda pricey though."}
{"text":"This is the best Japanese restaurant in the area. There is also a number of Korean dishes on the menu. Favorites are \"Inaka Special Roll\", Inaka tempura, and bulgogi. But everything is delicious!!!! Nice and friendly service!! The chef's treat changes everytime we come. Also a great place for take-out."}
{"text":"HELLO KITTY ROLL.  That's what it's about here ladies and gents.  This is my go to roll whenever I visit Inaka mainly because it's not really saucy and every other roll here is pretty dang saucy.  So if you're into thick sauces being lathered all over your sushi then this is yo' jamz.  But as for me, the hello kitty roll is my favorite because it reminds me of the yama crunch (which should affectionately be known as THE mecca of all that is sushi).  I'm also pretty fond of the dragon roll because of the soy wrap that they use to make it.  I'm not a particular fan of the roll (because of the eel in it) but I think I really like the concept of using the soy paper.  Some of my best friends actually swear by the hamachi kama appetizer here at Inaka, but I'm more of a salmon kama kind of guy and the past few times I've been here they were out.  Oh well.  This joint would be a \"fiver\" if it wasn't for all the sauce getting in the way."}
{"text":"Honestly, this was the most disgusting sushi I've ever had in Las Vegas. (Missouri sushi is a whole different story) I eat sushi ALOT and I can definitely tell the difference between awesome sushi, mediocre sushi, and awful sushi and inaka was just awful. The specialty rolls were bland and my fiance and I literally had to choke down the 4 rolls we ordered so we wouldn't get charged for the remainder. Yes that's right we only had FOUR rolls. I dared to try the salmon nigiri and it wasn't any better. I also tried the baked green mussels which is normally my favorite thing and I couldn't even finish it. I really have no idea what the other people writing reviews on this place are thinking... I can only assume they have never had good quality sushi so this is good quality to them. 

The service was ok. The sushi chefs were not interested in being there and you could totally tell. The waitress had to ask them multiple times to get started on our order.

All in all Inaka sushi was the worst ever and I will never be going there again. If you are looking for an amazing sushi place, go to Sushi Koma and you will not regret it."}
{"text":"I love this place! All of the food is awesome & everyone that works there is super nice. Me & my boyfriend eat there 2-3 times a week! I like how it's never crowded & it's also right by my house. I recommend the garlic tuna, super white tuna, & tiger roll."}
{"text":"My husband and I love sushi and we have been to this place many times. It's very close to our house so there's no discussion where we should go for sushi when we feel like it.
Good happy hour too :)"}
{"text":"I don't know which is worse the food or the service. I am still trying to figure out how it was so busy for a weekday night. This is probably one of the worst sushi restaurants I have ever ate at. Its a bummer because it was so close to my home, but after my experience there I don't mind making the drive another mile or two down Rainbow."}
{"text":"19.95 all you can eat! Friendly service that's close to home is always welcome."}
{"text":"Another all you can eat sushi place here in Henderson.  I love sushi especially all you can eat sushi.  I've been here a couple times, but I haven't really liked the food that much.  They give each sushi with too much rice, the little secrets to help fill a person up.  There's a descent amount of selections to choose from here though which is cool, but the fish didn't quite taste as fresh as some other places.  I wish the service was just a bit better, but a couple times were busy, so I understand.  However, one time one of the chefs did give a bit of an attitude when my friend ordered a second helping of ice cream since that's all you can eat too.  He asked, \"Does anyone ELSE want ice cream too before I have to go back and scoop it up again?\"  Weird.  It's just not my favorite place to go for all you can eat sushi."}
{"text":"great chef.great sushi. everything is fresh and awesome here. all the negative reviews are not true. why so negative on the chinese people?

this is a great sushi play after all.

p's: i am not paid by anyone.

pps: @russ. a .you just have to admit you re ahole and loser in life by harassing my true review.

ppps: we are pround to be chinese. the haters may rest your cases. all the racism haters just behave yourself."}
{"text":"This is the best place of sushi in Las Vegas, you can't beat the all you can eat deal. They have all their rolls, soups, and specials on the all you can eat menu. The staff remember you and the rolls you always get.  

It is fast, fun, and unique. We always suggest it to friends, family, and tourists.  The Inaka Roll is so good along with the Screaming Orgasm."}
{"text":"This place is awful. I literally had to choke down some of my sushi. It was warm, falling apart and the avocado was brown. I complained but they said if I didn't eat it they would charge me the a la carte price. Have not and will not ever return. If you like good food so not come here."}
{"text":"The food was just ok.
The beef teriyaki was bland. (You have to marinate the meat before cooking it. You can't just pour teriyaki sauce over the meat after cooking it & expect it to be flavorful.)
During the first half of our meal, the server was attentive. But for some reason, we got a different server for the last half & he was NOT attentive at all. It felt like he ignored us. There was only one other couple in the restaurant, so it's not like he was busy. In fact, he was chatting it up with the other couple & giving them full attention, while completely ignoring us. We had to flag him down so we could get our check & leave."}
{"text":"Been coming here for a year... loved the 30% discount, service, and food until tonight! They wouldn't honor the discount because we ordered 7min prior... howecer the receipt time is 9:08p and to top it off they didn't want us to walk on the floor because they mopped!! Disappointed with their service!"}
{"text":"Here today for lunch. Service was great and will be back if in the area and in the mood for AYCE sushi.

Taste is about average to what you can find out here. Price too about the same as everyone also."}
{"text":"It was alright, not great, not bad.  I went in Tuesday afternoon and was the only one in there.  Everything was fresh and everything, just not a bunch on flavors that jump out at you.  Better than a grocery store, but certainly not the best I ever had."}
{"text":"A nice surprise for the area, excellent sushi, great service, good value. We will be regulars from now on!"}
{"text":"Moved to Las Vegas almost a year ago from Hawaii. My mom brought me to Inaka Sushi and I have to say, it's better than any sushi restaurant in Hawaii.

All you can eat is reasonably priced.  They have a special \"yum yum\" sauce that is addicting!  Selection is larger than almost all sushi restaurants I've been to in Vegas so far.  And there's never a wait for a table.

The only downside I can think of is they don't serve Tobikko, but the Masago substitues just fine.  Also, mochi ice cream would be a great addition to their menu.

All in all, this is really the only sushi place I like to eat at.  Would recommend it to ANYONE, and will go back again."}
{"text":"Sadly I used to love this place years ago when everything was amazing about it. I have tried it twice within the last couple months and the food is great as always but the service both times were horrible. The guy was very rude and I had to ask him for our drinks cause he never asked if we wanted anything.  Then he didn't give us a menu for over 10 mins of already being seated. The food my be ok but not good enough for the worst service I've ever had."}
{"text":"My two kids and I eat here fairly regularly.  I love the AYCE as my children would eat enough sushi to put me into debtor's prison if we went to an a la carte place!  The owner is lovely, and the restaurant is very clean.  We are always treated very well and we find the special rolls particularly good.  I love the Spider Roll which is with soft shell crab.  Daughter loves the Rainbow Roll  It is not a fancy place so don't expect a bunch of fluff.  We sit at the counter, eat well and are very happy!"}
{"text":"Larry isn't working here anymore so if you are going to see him don't waste your time. This place isn't someplace i will be going anymore the sushi is just plain sushi with no flair without him. SO SAD. WILL MISS YOU LARRY WISH I KNEW WHERE TO GO TO SEE YOU. I found him Larry is now at OHJAH ON 8595 S DECATUR BLVD LAS VEGAS NV. Thank God Sushi wasn't the same without him"}
{"text":"Love this place!!!! Staff is all friendly & Larry is the best at sushi!! Just trust him with your order!! You won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and I've never encountered a problem, the food is tasty and they have all sorts of options with their AYCE... I will definitely be back. it's just a shame that sushi places in Henderson seem to be going down hill lately but Inaka has remained pretty good..."}
{"text":"The food taste subpar, it's an all you can eat place but it seems like the owners get angry when you order more then what they think you should be getting for the money you paid, does not feel like a friendly place, don't think I'll be going here ever again even thou its a 5 min. ride from my house."}
{"text":"We always drive past this place on the way up North, but never stopped because it appears a bit run-down on the outside, and we always thought \"How good could Japanese food be out here in the sticks?

The answer is, very! The inside of the place dispels any appearance of dingyness, done up in a typical wood and fabric Japanese style. A strange part of the greeting we got, in a nearly deserted restaurant in the middle of nowhere, was \"Do you have a reservation?\" The answer was no, but they graciously let us eat anyway. Other than that initial strangeness, the service was efficient throughout.

Everything we ate was was carefully prepared and had a great flavour. Standouts were the salad, Green Dragon sushi, and the glass noodles with beef.

It's not a cheap place to eat, but the portions were plentiful, and you'll leave feeling you had a delicious meal, thoughtfully prepared."}
{"text":"Just average for sushi.  The staff is very friendly and the price is good but the food is just average.  I was hoping for a lot more.  The selection is limited and a lot of it was over sauces.

The taco was OK and the sunomono salad was very good.  The garlic tuna was over sauced.  The spider roll was odd with imitation crab in it."}
{"text":"Awesome place for rolls, the staff is really cool and friendly."}
{"text":"I agree with \"Jane D\" below 100%.

Sum it up: Horrible Service + Rude Cashier/Server = Never going back again.

I used to order take out quite frequently via a nice female on the phone. Upon ordering, I was surprised an abrupt male speaker hurried me for an order, after agressively asking if I knew what location I was calling. I struggled to forget his rude manner on the phone, but sadly the offenses stacked up when I came in to pick up my order. 1) He became pissed when I questioned why I had only one soup with my Lunch Special order (I had ordered 2 lunch specials on the phone). 2) He was annoyed I came in wanting to add sushi last minute (heaven forbid I give them more money). 3) He thanked other patrons as they walked out the door, but said nothing to me, even when I politely said \"Thank you\".

The food is satisfactory. Sad to say, I have been going there out of habit and failed to venture out to other Sushi places in the Anthem area. Now, I have my prompt to do so.

Bottom Line: Avoid this place. I would rather tolerate bad food than blatant disrespect."}
{"text":"This place has a relish veggie roll. I'm practically addicted to it!  I also like their green salad.  The service is good and quick here as well, and the place is never so busy that you have to wait to sit.  yay!"}
{"text":"the place is very open, no separating walls like I Love Sushi, but i had good company.  Sushi was very good, i agree that there was too much rice on some rolls, and on others, the proportion seemed to be right on.  After driving from vegas without stopping, we took advantage of our exhaustion and hunger by coming to the first all you can eat sushi we found....it wasnt busy when we came, but it was packed by the time we left, so we lucked out...i sugges sitting at a table to spread the sushi out....

while i couldnt really eat my money's worth, i did enjoy the ice cream.  that part is unique compared to other sushi bars...green tea ice cream - cleanses and satisfies a sweet tooth"}
{"text":"Server Jerry was all over it! Amazing amazing service. Thai tea is good. $10 sushi special was also good. A quick and convenient sushi trip if you live in Mtns Edge. I prefer the Asian salad dressing but theirs was a nice change. Great miso soup. Bright atmosphere (lots of windows), though not much regarding decor. We will be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in with a group of 5 guys who love this place.  We basically told the sushi chefs to have at it and make whatever...everything that came was very good.  Sashimi was very fresh, rolls were excellent with some interesting flavors and the sushi chefs were very fun.  If I could find this place again, I'd certainly come back for the creations."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff and the chef was very nice and very attentive(we sat at the bar) definitely coming back here again. Also They have plenty option for people who cant eat row. Dont forget to order the lasagna, it taste hella good!"}
{"text":"We've been looking for a favorite sushi place.   Inaka is pretty good,  but still not the BEST! 

Alan the sushi chef is incredible!  Nice, Friendly, Fast and inventive.

The fish is Fresh and cool and good. 

My favorite is the Dragon roll with soy paper.  Ricks favorite is the sashimi platter.   

Edamame portion is too small,  the Gyoza is good.

Whatever you do, don't try the fried rice,  it was absolutely gross.  white rice soaked in brown sauce and too many veggies and not enough chicken (hence the 3 stars instead of 4) 

For sushi a good find."}
{"text":"Not sure how I feel about this plate. The fish did not look fresh but I ate it anyway. There are so many better sushi places in Vegas. It was ok."}
{"text":"Afraid to go back. I used to love this place, but the last time I went I got food poisoning! Of course I can't say for sure if it was from the sushi, but my friend also got sick and we both ate the tuna. She mostly ate it in the rolls, and I ate that along with the garlic tuna. Shortly after leaving my stomach started acting like a small alien family had moved in. Then for 12 hours straight I felt like I was being stabbed in the stomach repeatedly and did not sleep the whole night. The next day the stabbing sensation (aliens?) slowed down but I could not eat or drink for a day or two. Had to even call in sick to work. I have avoided all sushi since. It could've been a fluke, maybe bad batch of tuna that sat out too long, but just thought I would forewarn you!"}
{"text":"Yummy food. Nice staff. I live close and will be coming back again. Considering on delivery next time."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi.  It really helps that this place is a 3-minute walk from my house.  We did the all-you-can-eat.  Their eel sauce is super sweet like maple syrup.  At first, I felt like I was eating sushi at IHOP.  The taste did get old towards the end, but by then I was incredibly full anyway.  The salmon kama is also awesome.  I love their unagi!!!  (I love unagi in general, but theirs is exceptionally good)."}
{"text":"We were regulars and loved it because Larry was there behind the sushi bar. Always 5 star service and sushi. 
Now, not so much.
We will not return. 

Where's Larry? Please help us find him. 
Where ever Larry is, it's a 5 star place."}
{"text":"Had the Bonzai and Cajun rolls..both had a weird taste and the rice was mushy. It tasted and looked as if it was pounded and them rolled up. The spicy sweet sauce on the Bonzai was clear and slimy. Never coming back."}
{"text":"I made a Yelp account to write this review. I have NEVER had such poor service. I don't know how this restaurant survives. I've been twice - and when I was there the waiter and cook acted annoyed that I existed. Most of the meal they whispered and looked at me. The sushi is decent. But don't expect to have a good meal due to lack of service."}
{"text":"Ordered some rolls to go and was shocked to see how small they were. My husband and I ordered 5 rolls total and they did not taste very good :/ I was really disappointed since this place is so close to my house! It was also a tad pricey for what was delivered. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"They were ok/decent the first visit, but the second time they served me fish that had gone bad. I'm forgiving but this is a sushi place, you don't get a second chance after that."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since 2005. 10 years of loyalty, through food poisoning and mediocre service throughout the years, but the chefs were always the best part next to the food. Today is the absolute last time we eat here. Host/waiter couldn't be more rude. All of the old staff is gone, owner is the sushi chef now and this waiter walks away when we ask something, acts like we are a pain just walking in. With so many great sushi restaurants around here, they should be mindful of their customer service."}
{"text":"K. I never write reviews. But Ken, the sushi chef, told everyone at the sushi bar that he he was sick - AND SERVING US HAND MADE SUSHI! we went though the whole menu and nothing was better than other sushi spots. nothing that made inaka fresh and nothing is worth going back to especially with a restaurant with a a chef that tells you that he's sick while serving you. that's the inaka standard."}
{"text":"Food was awesome...larry was great and creative. He had a great memory of what we ordered last month..amazing service..food was fresh. I would definitly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The only reason I go here is because its close to my house and this place doesn't have a 1 to 2 hour wait like most AYCE sushi restaurants. I love the fact that I can walk in and never have to wait for a table. I've been here a few times and the price for AYCE sushi is reasonable but the quality of the sushi is just ok. Honestly you can probably get better & fresher sushi from the grocery store. 

HUGE SIDE NOTE - I dunno if anyone else has noticed the fact that the staff and chefs are not Japanese. I've heard them speak Chinese to each other. Possibly the biggest reason that there isn't a big following for this restaurant due to the fact that it is not an authentic Japanese sushi bar :("}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I was totally bummed that this Sushi restaurant soooooo close to my home (3 minutes by car) would be so expensive and yet so mediocre. My bf and I went there yesterday to get something for a late lunch, and found it was Happy Hour (2-5pm) for 30% off any roll you order, and it seems to be on ALL rolls you order during this time frame. Well I ordered 3 spicy crab rolls - nothing too hard to do on that one, 2 spicy cucumber (which ended up costing me as much as a roll that had everything in it) and the shrimp tempura roll + cream cheese (add a dollar for that little delicacy). As I mentioned, they charged us 7 dollars for a cucumber roll with siracha on it, that's  dollars for the two. Our spicy crab rolls were 6 a piece..... so thank goodness for Happy hour Pricing! I just wasn't all that impressed honestly and the lady seemed really put out to be taking our order. I love sushi and I probably wont be going back here, unless they lower the prices. I'm use to getting my spicy crab for 3.50. That seems more reasonable to me."}
{"text":"Friendly and accommodating staff. Sushi is always good. It is one of my biggest pet peeves when sashimi or nigiri isn't cold & theres is so that's great. Love their dinner combos, I haven't done the all you can eat yet. Prices are okay, I really wish they had a happy hour. It would get my husband in there a lot more. but as for a local good quality sushi place this is it if you are in southern highlands or mountains edge"}
{"text":"A friend had suggested we try this place out on our weekly 'commute' up north. I must admit that I was sceptical at first - Sushi?  Caledon?

Well, it's great and a wonderful treat vs stopping at all the box chain restaurants up the road in Orangeville. The sushi is great (I usually order the Inaka dinner) - nothing too crazy, but fresh salmon, tuna, smoked fish etc accompanied with miso soup and salad. It's well prepared, consistent and fast. While I usually have the sushi my family has tried the bento boxes (very generous portions), tempura - quite delicate and not too greasy and, most recently, the udon noodles - lovely broth, fresh ingredients and perfect noodles. 

Price is completely fair and a really great of value. As others have noted the other extras are the wonderful, friendly service - professional and attentive. The interior is great as well - lots of booths. I went once when the place was packed and service was a bit slow - but completely understandable so nothing no to worry about and what do you expect with no reservation?"}
{"text":"always fantastic i go every Thursday to see Larry this dude hands down best chef I've ever seen truley loves his work every roll is a work of art deff the way go won't go anywhere else"}
{"text":"Absolutely gross. In the summer, their A/C must not work because it's sweltering in there. Feeling uncomfortable is one thing but then to eat rubbery fish? Gross. I've never said fish/sushi wasn't \"fresh\" because I'm not even sure what that means, but I would apply that to this place. I felt sick WHILE eating it. Service is very poor, no one is friendly and those things could be overcome with great food but sadly that's not the case. Tried it twice, never again."}
{"text":"This is my FAVORITE sushi place!  My husband and I have had probably 20+ trips to Inaka on Eastern and we love it.  I have been known to break my diet, pick up sushi on my way home several times, go there for a sad day to pick my mood up, I just love the place!  Miss my old two favorite waitresses that knew our order with our faces, but the place is still fantastic.  Wish they did a punch card or something is my only desire.  Best spicy shrimp I've had from a sushi place!"}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi?? Why not? I decided to give this place a try, after driving by and seeing that they were offering all you can eat sushi for a set price. I came with my boyfriend and knew that this would be perfect since we both have excellent appetites. When we first arrived, the hostess was sitting in a chair and the place was pretty much empty. There was one family of four sitting across the entrance.

We decided to bring our 16 month old and did know our visit would be cut short if he started acting up, so we quickly ordered our choices. About 15 minutes into our visit my son started acting up and we had about 4 different sushi choices on our table. (The all you can eat buffet was 23.99 per person) (Our choices added up individually to about 26 dollars) We decided we had enough and didn't want to risk our son flipping out more. 

We asked the hostess if it would be ok to box what we had on the table. She smiled and walked over to the two men making the sushi and when she came back, she told us that next time we needed to try harder to eat our food. She stated that \"this\" time we will let you slide but next time we will need to finish what we ordered. I was a little confused by what she was saying and was under the impression that she will box the little bit we had on the table.

 I do understand this was a \"buffet type\" of sushi and under any other circumstance, we would not be able to box anything up. While we asked for the check and I began to take my child out of his high chair, the hostess grabbed all the food on the table and tossed it in the garbage!! I was horrified and got very upset that she would throw it away the way she did. If I would have know that she was going to throw it away, I would have asked her how much extra?? Mind you, we were already paying almost 50 dollars.

To prevent any confrontation on my boyfriend's part (he was pissed), I decided to just go. I will not be returning to this place.....ever."}
{"text":"We were pretty excited when the signs for Inaka Sushi were going up!  Finally, a sushi place in our neck of the woods and an all-you-can-eat one too, no less!  (Even better, the Husband was more than familiar with their first location after being a regular there.)

Joining us was Melissa G. and another friend from SoCal who never gets AYCE sushi ever.  The dinner menu is $23.95, which is cheaper than some of the other sushi restaurants around.

It was pretty empty on a Saturday night, but we figured it was because of the location more so.

The menu selection is pretty standard with appetizers, nigiri, sushi rolls, and ice cream included in the AYCE.

Appetizers: 

* Age Tofu (Deep Fried Tofu With Tempura Sauce) - Not quite like other restaurants where it sits in broth with bonito flakes.  Rather it's slices of soft tofu, lightly deep-fried, and tempura dipping sauce.

* Shrimp Tempura - Standard, nothing special.

* Green Mussels (Baked Mussels with Special Mayonnaise) - When we ordered this, we thought it was just regular baked green mussels.  It's more like \"Dynamite\" because of the mayo sauce and served in a scallop shell.

* Yakitori (Grilled Chicken on Skewers with Teriyaki Sauce) - The Husband ate all of them, so I guess it was okay.

* Seafood Ragoon (Deep-Fried Mixed Fish and Cream Cheese Wrapped in Wonton Skin) - It had a stronger salmon taste, and a dipping sauce would have been a good complement to it.

* Miso Soup

* Cucumber Salad (Sliced Cucumber with Sesame Dressing) 

Nigiri:

* Amaebi (Sweet Shrimp) - Limit of one order of two per person.  It wasn't exactly what I called amaebi, the raw sweet shrimp.  It's a fake and bad substitute of two pieces of cooked shrimp sitting on rice.

* Albacore (White Tuna)

* Cajun Albacore

* Hamachi

* Garlic Tuna

* Ikura (Salmon Roe)

* Saba (Mackerel)

* Sake (Salmon)

* Hotate (Scallop) - Before ordering this one, we asked if the scallops were small ones mixed up with stuff or the larger variety.  The waitress confirmed it was the larger variety sliced in half and laid over the rice.  Well, when she brought it over, it was the former variety and not what we wanted.  It's a good thing we only requested one order since we ended up not eating it.  The waitress said it was because she was new and didn't know.

* Uni (Sea Urchin) - Limit of one order of two per person.

From the first bite of sushi, we knew that we weren't going to be happy.  The sushi rice was mushy and lacked the vinegar that makes it sushi rice.  Over and over again, I was getting less than impressed with their rice.  Blah.

Sushi Rolls:

* Salmon Skin Handroll

* Spider Roll (Soft Shell Crab, Crab Salad, Masago & Eel Sauce) - Melissa G. wasn't too impressed with their version as they use a different batter so it comes out a lot darker and not as tasty.  It was alright.

* Something Wrong Roll (Deep Fried Assorted Dish Fish Roll with Spicy Sauce) - It's tasty because it's deep fried and sits in a bed of mayonnaise spicy sauce.

* Catepillar Roll (Fresh Water Eel, Cucumber & Topped with Avocado and Eel Sauce)

* Kiss The Ass (Spicy Spider Topped with Spicy Crab) - I didn't even realize there was a soft shell crab inside because the crab concoction dominates the roll.

Before we started ordering any of the rolls, I asked the waitress if they used Sriracha to make the hot sauce.  After much confusion, she finally went to the sushi chef to ask.  They were making a big deal out of it as if I was asking for the secret recipe to their spicy sauce when all I wanted to know is if they use it at all.  The final answer, yes.  I'm not a big fan of the stuff in my sushi.

Dessert:

* Green Tea, Plum, and Mango Ice Cream - Pretty good ice cream, and we all had our share.  Good stuff!

Service could use some improvement.  With only two parties present, our waitress was too busy socializing than getting our order or refilling our tea and water.  Some orders were forgotten and needed some reminding.  The other waitress was a bit pushy about rushing me to clear a plate off as she waited so she could take it away.

Overall, we were less than impressed and won't be going back.  It was just disappointing and screwing up the basic sushi rice is a bad sign."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, we should have listened to previous reviews...this is definitely not fresh sushi. The spicy tuna looked like canned cat food. We could taste/feel ice chips in the crab mix. The employee was super nice & the miso soup was delicious, but that's it. It's a bummer because it's close to home."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi. Try the Inaka signature roll! Service has been great both times I've eaten there. On the second occasion the place was full and the service was slower but management made up for this by serving complimentary spring rolls and dessert. I would highly recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This place sucks!  There are way too many good sushi spots to even bother wasting your time here"}
{"text":"Should've listened to the reviews... But since I live so close to inaka I felt compelled to give it a try... Never again.   I love sushi and am not picky... But this place sucked.  Decent service and cute interior are the only reason they're getting 2 stars instead of one. It seems like they have very low quality food... The ginger barely had any taste... I had to spit out bones from one of the rolls... Don't waste your time... Kobe is further away but SO much better with much better happy hour deals. . don't waste your time or money here."}
{"text":"Their sushi is not good and they are pretty overpriced for a la carte. The reason I have gone here a couple of times is because they have pretty good lunch specials and they are walking distance from my job. Besides that their sushi is def nothing to rave about or waste your money on."}
{"text":"I ordered the Lunch Special Teriyaki Chicken for pick up. My first impression of the restaurant was that it was very cute little spot! For the lunch special I thought it was a good deal which came with; miso soup, 4 pieces of a California roll, and tempura shrimp and veggies. The chicken teriyaki was a very small portion but it was enough for me. The food was pretty good, I do want to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Quality of sushi and ramen isn't up to par but two stars for trying, giving good customer service, and being in a convenient location."}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday evening and ordered 
1. Dynamite, 6
- Baked Mixed Spicy Scallop, Sushi Rice W/Special Mayonnaise, Eel Sauce
2. Take box, 16.95
- Beef Teriyaki, Shrimp, Vegetable Tempura, Gyoza, California Roll
3. Ume box, 16.95
- Salmon Teriyaki,Shrimp, Vegetable Tempura, Gyoza, California Roll 
for $7 (Used the $20 Groupon, valued at $40)

- Have you ever eaten at Yasai Japanese Grill before? 
..Yasai is a Japanese fast food restaurant thats all over SoCal. Their bento boxes taste very similar at almost 2x the price. Although at Yasai, there is no gyoza, there is a vegetable skewer! 
..Salad was plain. Yasai has 2 salads! One is an oriental salad with madarin oranges! So good. 
...They give less beef and salmon teriyaki here than Yasai. 
- Miso was good. Not too salty. Hot when received.
- Beef teriyaki was tough. My GF almost choked for not chewing extra thoroughly! haha. oh man, fail. 
- Salmon teriyaki was also tough, but better than their beef teriyaki 
- Dynamite was good. Although a bit oily, there were plenty of scallops. Fresh. Recommend. 
- 2 tempura shrimp. 1 onion. 1 yam. 1 cucumber. 
- Service was a bit slow. They forgot to give us soy sauce and tempura sauce so we had to wait a while before we ate. 
So to sum it up, Aside from AYCE, their bentos are fast-food quality. Maybe they should open up a Yasai Japanese Grill in this area. I'm sure it'll be very successful."}
{"text":"Going to keep it simple. The service truly does suck. Money crunching. For an all you can eat that is a bad sign already. One piece of a role was remaining as we were trying to finish it after paying, the server an older man comes back I will charge you a full portion was appalling. With so much sushi places around town this was the first and last time at this restaurant. Based on the negative reviews I don't see how people continue to go and how they will survive."}
{"text":"I go to Inaka Sushi regularly, at least once a month (when possible).

Leo (the Owner) is a good guy and treats me very well.  He is currently the chef for the sushi as well, and I believe makes once of the best Rainbow Rolls that I've had.  

Inaka has your typical kitchen foods (gyoza, shrimp tempura, etc...) but I believe it is is the Sushi that stands it apart.

The decor is o.k., the staff will occasionally look like they are running around without their heads when they are busy, they are attentive and try to do the best for their customers.

I don't know how this place stays in business as the fish is fresh, Leo looks to make sure you are full, and the prices are great for the Henderson/Anthem area.

If you are looking for AYCE (All You Can Eat) Sushi, I think you should give this place a try."}
{"text":"Sunday sushi excursions prove to be more difficult then one would imagine. Tried to go to two different restaurants, on different sides of town, to find out that they were either closed or not open for lunch. Finally, my group called to make sure that Inaka was open. Finding a place close by to satisfy our sushi craving, we ventured here. I remember disliking the one on Eastern, but went here with an open mind. Sometimes different locations can prove to be drastically different.

The decor is nothing special until you look up at the ceiling. Beautiful paper parasols are hanging down creating a colorful display. The area is small, but the tables are spaciously spread out. 

The sushi chef is friendly and was preparing our food at break neck speed. The presentation of our meal was nice and neat. The woman that worked the front of the house was more reserved and could come off as unfriendly, but was helpful. She was willing to answer any of our questions. Since we came with a mom that is still new to sushi, it was beneficial. 

The appetizers were limited and nothing special. Seaweed salad is a dish that I can devour bowls of. Inaka's was on the dry side. The tofu has the broth on the side for dipping and did not come with the benito shavings. Our party did enjoy the squid tempura though. They are little rings of meat dipped in batter and fried to perfection. They are tiny and easy to eat. They remind me more of potato chips than your usual calamari or tako karaage.

The down side were the rolls. The fish were fresh, but the sushi all tasted the same. Anything that was suppose to be spicy was bland. What the rolls lacked, the nigiri made up for. The Cajun albacore and garlic tuna are both flavorful. The tako and ika were chewy, but not rubbery. Inaka does not have halibut, so that was a big disappointment. Out of all the rolls that we ordered, the only one that stood out to me was the Leo #1, but that had the garlic tuna and Cajun albacore on it. 

If you must have sushi on a Sunday and can't wait for dinner, then this place is acceptable, but there are many other places that have a wider selection."}
{"text":"This is very close to my home so few times a month, I come to this Sushi restaurant to eat.  They have great parking, wonderful service and fresh Sushi. They have tempura and other stuff from the kitchen. Moderately priced, you can relax enjoy some Saki with your Sushi. They also have huge take out business.  If you like you can pick up Sushi to go.  I suggest you all come and try this restaurant."}
{"text":"I'll keep this short... By far the worst Japanese restaurant I've ever eaten at. Simply terribly prepared food. I actually felt bad for the people who were coming in as I was leaving, but hopefully this review will save some of you from the trouble."}
{"text":"I'm a picky sushi eater and being from an area like California where there is awesome sushi and horrible and not much in between I was a septic going in. I just moved right down the street and decided to get it a try. I was impressed that not only rolls were on the all you can eat. The chef was nice, and made up some sushi, and a spicy hand roll in record time. He also had me try the garlic tuna sushi... awesome! I capped off the night with a dragon roll and the check was record low for sushi 34 bucks! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"If I walk into an AYCE sushi restaurant, I'm automatically a fan of it and the buffer zone to take me out this fan range is pretty large. Unfortunately, Inaka did plenty of negative things to take me well out of the fan zone despite me being a pretty forgiving diner. We went there based on our many previous experiences which were OK, and were hoping they might have stepped things up. If I had read the more recent reviews, I would have never set foot in there.

The male server is everything previous reviewers have described. A corpse comes to my mind as comparison: rigid, cold, and unresponsive. When we arrived we were the only table at 3 PM on Saturday afternoon with one television on and light background music. After the server greeted us saying, \"how many?\" the only other words he said in the entire 30 minutes we were there were, \"finished?\" If he wasn't running our food, he would literally stand 3 feet away from us, just staring at us. Talk about awkward.

The menu is minimal for nigiri and rolls. The presentation of my first order of 20 pieces of nigiri was horrendous. The chef placed all 20 pieces on one small rectangular plate like that was the only plate left in the restaurant. All the pieces were in contact with each other and the sauces that come on some of the fish mixed with other fish ruining the flavor. It looked like he used a butter knife to cut the fish, just terrible presentation. The rice was mush without flavor. And the fish was discolored and didn't look fresh, especially the maguro.

I really felt like I was playing Russian roulette at this point. So before I took another turn, I ordered some green tea ice cream and we bolted. I chalked it up as a big time loss as I was also charged dinner price. Don't come here, there are plenty of better options a short drive away."}
{"text":"Signed up on this site specifically to review Inaka.  It has become our go-to ACYE sushi joint, and is well worth the money.

$19.95 for lunch, $23.95 for dinner.  The fish is extremely yummy---the garlic tuna melts in your mouth and is super delicious.  The rolls aren't flashy, but are packed with flavor, and the service is outstanding.  The chefs are super friendly and willing to recommend/tweak their menu for you to get you what you like.

As far as rolls... the Inaka roll is great.  Wife can't get enough.  Really enjoy the Pacific roll with coconut shrimp in the middle.  Yum!  

Could use a little more variety as far as dessert goes (only 3 types of ice cream, no mochi), but who goes to sushi for dessert, right?

Stamp card is almost full, and I can't wait to get back to finish it off!"}
{"text":"When it comes to sushi I am not that \"sushi whore\" that jumps from place to place and try's everything on the menu just to run and try another place.... Or am I? Lately I would say that I may be just that. I was all about some of the other competition here in town and I am not saying that we are done with them but Inaka was impressive, not only the service, but the speed, the cleanliness, and the quality. 

It was a dark cold night here in Vegas and the wife and I had a sitter for the kiddos and we decided to go out to dinner and hit up Carrabas, after pulling up and realizing that we could very easily go to carrabas with the kids so why not try and hit one of our favorite sushi restaurants. A flipped a U-turn in the parking lot and got ready to leave the parking lot as we noticed the buzzing neon of the Inaka sign that is literally on the driveway out of the shopping center. We pulled up and I pulled out the handy dandy Yelp app and notice the great reviews. 

This is when we pose the question... Do we A Keep driving and go to the regular joint or do we throw the car in park and try Inaka ( if you happen to be a Metro officer, The car was in park and I was on a hands free device...) needless to say we turned the car off and headed inside. 

The greeting was quick and we were at a table in no time with our larger than average glasses of water, which I love by the way, the one thing I hate is running out of water. The all you can eat menu is large and includes lots of fresh fish options. some of the creative rolls are very impressive also. Here is where they truly shine. I think we ordered like 5 rolls combined, the gentlemen at the counter grabbed our order and no joke within about 5 minutes we had all the rolls and appetizers we ordered on our table. WOW. Other places that we like to go to take that long to bring us drinks let alone bring the food. 

I am a fan of this place now, The sushi was fresh, the service was fast and friendly and the plum ice cream was a great way to end the meal. If you are off of Eastern running around or taking care of something and the hunger pains start calling, Do not hesitate to hit up Inaka you will not be let down."}
{"text":"Price is good but never have eaten at a sushi place with all you can eat that doesn't allow all specialty rolls to be offered"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the AYCE. I prefer to go when Larry is there, I believe that's his name. He is very friendly and takes such pride in his work. He'll even fix you things that are not on the menu, \"new creations\" we always say. Very good and the place is always clean which is extra important to me in sushi places."}
{"text":"I agree with the reviews on this place. We went there when they FIRST opened this location and two of the four of us got all you can eat.  The amount of food you get for the price isn't really worth it for the combination dinners.  I understand they you can't share the \"all you can eat\" sushi with those getting the regular dinners, but they said something to us when we were taking a spoon full of the green tea ice cream at the end of the meal...that was a little much.

I love the location of this place because it is close but we have never gone back and chose to drive further for better food, amount of food and better service."}
{"text":"Food was great. Customer service and environment were awful. No one was in the restaurant, no music, very awkward. Server was  standing by our table the entire time pretty much just staring off in to space, made the entire experience very uncomfortable. Also was very rude - every time he'd come to the table for any reason he had an attitude, despite us being incredibly nice and even going as far as trying to conversate with him. When it came time to pay, I left a tip of 3$(with the service we had gotten up to that point it should've been nothing, but I gave him the benefit of the doubt and assumed he was just having a bad day) He got pretty angry when he saw the recipt and demanded a 15% tip on our 70$ bill(there was 2 of us, so no mandatory gratuity.)
Will never return. Shame, because the food was pretty good. I'll be amazed if this place is here for more then another year. Based on how dead it was, I'm going to assume I'm not the only one to have such a terrible experience."}
{"text":"My son and I ate here once and never again. The fish  didn't taste fresh and the sushi chefs were so unfriendly. Funny thing was they were friendly to the white family that came in (we're Asian by the way).  Surprised that it's still open."}
{"text":"I tried this place out yesterday, with my husband,son (on a high chair) and brother.  We got the all  you can eat sushi for around 22 dollars.  I have tried a couple of sushi places in the are and thought they sucked so I was judging this one before I walked thru the door.  I was pleasantly surprised to find out the food was pretty yummy.  The place was empty besides a couple and us, and really clean.  There were two waitresses that were on us like hawks, waiting to see if we needed anything else.  The only thing that was kind of weird but understandable was after we ate the girl came to our table and told us that next time we were going to be charged for anything we left on our plate cause they didn't like to waste food.  Ummm How are you supposed to try things out to see if you like them? (it was a jalapeno roll, I don't recommend it!)   Other then that nothing bad to say!"}
{"text":"Most amazing sushi everyone needs to go here. It's a crime not too! Wonderful staff and nice surroundings!"}
{"text":"Placed a to go order on 4/30/18 for a miso soup and tempura veggies. Previous to this visit I'd only ordered miso soup from here. The tempura was HORRIBLE. The worse I've ever had. Very greasy, no flavor, and only 4 pieces: 2 carrot, 1 broccoli and 1 onion. I've never heard of broccoli tempura. The miso soup was good. So I'll just stick with that. Also was very surprised that around dinner time (6:30pm) the place was really empty. Only 2 tables having dinner."}
{"text":"The sushi is great (I've never had the food off the menu) I particularly like the Harry Potter roll. They go crazy with the garlic which I like, definitely worth checking out, and they have all you can eat which is great if you can put it away."}
{"text":"When I first saw the reviews, I was like... ummmm no. I don't want to die. Nope. 

This place is legit right by my house and I had the feeling that maybe, just maybe, it wasn't as bad a people say. You know, Yelpers tend to be overly generous, so if this place is rockin' 2 stars, that doesn't bode well, but maybe Yelpers tend to be a little overly critical as well? Who knows. 

I have never had AYCE sushi before - that's not to say I've never had sushi, I've just always had it one roll at a time. When my friend Gil R. came by to visit on 6/12/14, I decided that maybe it was time to try this place out. 

Because we went at a certain time, I believe before 7 PM, it was Happy Hour so we got free hot sake with our meal. 

There was nothing I tried that I didn't like. Nothing. And that's saying something because my friend Gil is a big guy (6'2, 410 lbs) so I got to try a LOT of rolls. I thought everything was great, minus the ice cream. It was just meh. 

For $52 for two people, I'd say this place is a great deal. I did order uni and it never came out, but Gil warned me that I would hate it and that it's a good thing that it didn't come out so we didn't have to pay for the uneaten portion. He also said the fish wasn't the freshest compared to other AYCE places, but that it was still good. I thought it was fine.

Will be back to try again."}
{"text":"Came here a year  ago and came back again today Very good sushi got the California crunch the inaka roll and the spider roll all very good"}
{"text":"I love supporting businesses in my area, but this place was just awful. They are not friendly, have no customer service and their sushi is sub-par at best. BTW, if you don't finish everything on the table, they will charge you a la carte. They take that seriously people. Make sure to eat everything if you come here."}
{"text":"My family and I were craving sushi for Fourth of July and we decided to give Inaka a try. I was hesitant because of mixed reviews but it was so convenient to our home in Mountains Edge we decided to give it a chance.  The sushi rolls were delicious especially the Inaka roll. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Yeah, great sushi, if you don't give a s$&! about customer service!
Instead, try \"Sumo Sushi\" down on durango and warm springs, it is WORTH THE DRIVE!!

We came in at about 10:20, 40 mins til closing. (We were the only ppl there) And they pressured us to leave the WHOLE TIME WE WERE EATING! I felt like I was trying to scarf down the fricken sushi! Sushi chef even convinced us not to get the AYCC..because \"We should have come earlier\"..as he looked at us scornfully. When we left we said goodbye to the reception lady and she didn't even pay us a second glance..made us leave 15 mins early."}
{"text":"First time at a Japanese resturant...amazing food, perfect service, couldn't have asked for a better first experience."}
{"text":"Damn it!!!! I was praying that this place would be at least \"okay\" since it's located near mountain's edge and there is nothing out here! I'm not exaggerating when I say the best part of the meal was when they notified me that after the second beer, the third would be free. 

They messed up rice... RICE! How the...? It was hard to even swallow the rice; it was too dry! Uncle Ben's minute made rice has treated me better. Also, no Uni, no toro despite it being pictured on an advertisement, and no super white OR and other fatty fish that could make up for it.

I ate a lot of Nigiri on the AYCE menu and nothing really tasted fresh. I've eaten a lot of sushi in my day and the fish here was NOTICEABLY different IN A BAD WAY. I know. I know; all you can eat sushi is not the way to go if you want good sushi (under most circumstances), but this place was something else. I wasn't even going to try a roll after the nigiri, but I went with a half roll of something on the spicy side. The roll that they presented me with was something u might find in an Albertson's; wrapped up in plastic to take to go (maybe even worse). 

Let me emphasize: DAMN IT! I was really hoping, despite the not-so-great reviews that this place would be okay or at least bearable. I won't be back. Very simply: the place sucks. And that's too bad.

Hopefully one day when I drive by in the future there will be a big banner that says \"Under New Management\" or something because they must know. They must know that they're setting standards that no one should be proud of. 

**sigh** the whole experience was disappointing. At least the free beer has helped mask my utter discontent with this place!!!! The service wasn't bad but who the hell cares when the food blows ass.

I won't be back even tho it's seconds away. Womp. Womp. Womp."}
{"text":"Wasnt great tuna but the rolls were above average. Not bad for all you can eat and happy hour prices!"}
{"text":"BEST SUSHI IN VEGAS! Just wish it was open a little later!"}
{"text":"The sushi is ok but the service is not good. I've been here a few times and every time the waiter is rude and seems annoyed. He misunderstood what i ordered and then got mad because i didn't want what he brought me. The proper thing to fo was to simply say \"i apologize\" but he put the blame on me. Also, the prices went up and i went based off of the menu prices but he charged me more. Apparently, in his mind, i should've just known what the new prices were! So again,  the sushi is ok but customer service is bad!"}
{"text":"This must be the same horrible owners as the Inaka on Eastern because they like to put different prices on the bill that are higher than the menu!! When I mentioned it to the waitress she said \"Oh, you must be looking at an old menu!\". I was looking at the menu that she gave me so it is not my problem that she gave me an old menu; a good business owner should honor the price on their menu instead of expecting me as a customer to just know that the prices indicated are inaccurate. The prices were also too high!! Menu price for an Alaskan Roll (salmon and avocado) was $7.99, which is already a high price for that type of roll, but she tried to charge $8.99! This roll is typically $6.50-$7.00 at the most! Also, I was not able to replace a spicy tuna roll with a regular tuna roll. This in fact made me order less because I couldn't get what I wanted and so, therefore, they lost money. 
On a good note, the sushi was ok and the dining area seemed clean."}
{"text":"This place sucked.  If they where real japanese people making sushi then it might have tasted a lot better. The rice was hard, seriously?!!!!!!I will never eat here again. If anyone know what authentic sushi is this is not the place guaranteed. I give it two thumbs down."}
{"text":"Always excellent service, the sushi chefs even smile and greet you at the door! Service from the waitresses is alway friendly and quick.  The booths are nice and private, but overall the restaurant is quite small.  The sushi here is undoubtedly the best sushi in the area!"}
{"text":"This is the only place my husband and I usually go for sushi.  We try others, but they are never as good.  We always get the all u can eat and our favorites are the following: cajun albacore nigiri, Inaka roll, Pacific Roll, baked green mussel, jalapeno popper, ama ebi, and salmon kama.  If you don't like sushi, they have a chicken dish that I love.  I think it's called spicy chicken and it's served in a cast iron sizzling platter so it caramelizes the sticky spicy sauce...Yummy!"}
{"text":"Great for the whole family.  They treat us like we own the place and my kids love it.  I think it just good sushi and I am in and out. Nothing fancy but if you want a tummy full of good sushi for a good price you can't beat it!"}
{"text":"I love their location on St. Rose but this location is terrible! The waiter was so rude, I asked for a menu to mark what I wanted to eat and handed me a plastic one stating you can look. I received a burnt  tempura roll and asked for a new one but they said i would have to pay al la cart for the burnt one! on top of all that he included his own tip when we had separate checks..never again never again!"}
