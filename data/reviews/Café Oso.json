{"text":"Had an amazing lunch at Cafe Oso today. The talapia tacos and fresh guacamole were amazing. The customer service was also outstanding. To top it off their prices are extremely fair. Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"This is Phoenix College Culinary Programs Restaurant. I attended Phoenix College from 2009-2011 and would eat here often when it was named The Culinary Cafe. They changed the menu a few years ago and I stopped going because I loved the old menu. I started going bake to the re-named Cafe Oso and became a big fan all over again my two favorite entrees is the Flatiron Steak and The Ahi Tuna... The ice tea is also great and for $12 for three courses it can't be beat. They are open each semester Jan-May, Sept-Dec. Tue-Thur 11-1. I would suggest anyone try it out, it is truly a great experience and it helps the culinary program. I go at least four times per semester..."}
{"text":"Formerly the Culinary Cafe, Cafe Oso has been re-vamped by Phoenix College faculty member and Valley restaurateur Anthony Redondo.  He and his staff have done great work here. They did an entire re-design of the menu, and are now offering a wide array of contemporary entrees at totally reasonable prices.  The table-side guacamole gives Gallo a run for its money.  Complimentary vegetable platter was savory and beautiful.  The flavors and textures I had were clearly well thought out, if not perfectly executed.  This is a local lunch secret that is unfortunately too-well-kept.  At a minimum, PC students need to know about this place, since the quality and price of the food would actually fit within their budgets I think.  For less than $10 you can have a great meal, innovatively prepared, and made from quality ingredients.  I will be advertising this to my classes, for sure.  Kudos to Cafe Oso, keep it up."}
