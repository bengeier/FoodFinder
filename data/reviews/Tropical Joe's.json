{"text":"Every time I'm in the area I make it a point to drop in for a goat roti.  I don't eat large portions so I order the half portion which is generous and the price is right - $9.!!!!"}
{"text":"Has anyone cut open their so called \"general tao chicken\"?  There's absolutely no chicken inside.  I cut open every single piece (approx 15) and it was all dough.  I challenge anyone to go and do the same and let me know if there was any chicken inside.  STAY AWAY!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. When I first moved into the area, I'd frequent the home depot and smell the food, and always dismissed it as mall carribean food smell. I've tried a couple of 'Carribean' places at malls, and usually end up with chinese food. One day, after another trip to home depot, I finally gave in and went in. I ordered the Jerk Chicken and I couldn't believe how much food they were putting in there. As a note, I'm not recommending this place just because of how much food they put in there, just noting that as a point. I was pretty sure I wouldn't be able to finish all this food. 

I sat down and with really low expectations, dug into the jerk chicken. Sometimes you eat something and it reminds you of childhood, or a memory of good food or a great place. That's what happened. It amazes me to say this about a little food stall in a mall, but the food there is fantastic in a way that's hard to describe. Is it a little over salted? Yes. Is it a little too greasy? Yes. Is it absolutely delicious? Yes. 

I've tried a couple of their other offerings like the goat curry and the beef curry and didn't come away as impressed. The jerk chicken is quite excellent. I read more reviews on this board and someone was raving about the chickpeas. The next time I went there I asked for some chickpeas as well. 

Thank you yelper for telling me about this. The chickpeas were fantastic - a little crunchy and perfectly spiced. I have a soft spot for 'hole in the wall restaurants' or tiny nondescript places that put out great dishes and maybe that's what pushed it to a 5 star for me. 

PS: Ask for jerk sauce on the chicken, it really completes the dish."}
{"text":"I just LOVE this place. Its a shame they dont have more locations around our city. But everytime I go to this mall I have to grab food from here bcus theres no place like it that ive been too. In my opinion this place has the best carribean food."}
{"text":"Always good. Large portions friendly staff what more could you ask for. Best place in Leslieville for Roti. Just wish they had doubles!"}
{"text":"Huge portions and delicious homey food awaits you here. My go to take home dinner is their large jerk chicken dinner with rice and potatoes plus the same with oxtail stew, all drowned in oxtail sauce. My only grievance is that they should be open much much later, but alas the mall closes at 9. They close at ~8:45pm. 

Obviously don't come expecting a fine dining service from the staff. They're friendly and chatty if you initiate conversation but honestly, who goes to a mall food court looking for an elegant dining experience. 

Nah, the food and the food alone will bring me back every time. Plus, their prices aren't bad either considering what other Caribbean places charge."}
{"text":"Best jerk in the City!  I get double orders so we have leftovers, and the jerk sauce is out of this world. Absolutely love this place, I've been getting Friday night dinners there forever.  I was reading the reviews, can't believe someone gave it 1 star then commented on the weight of one of the women - the \"unfriendly heavy set female manager\" - she probably sensed what a  Shallow Hal you are!"}
{"text":"So an update   They've changed the menu and now have jerk pork  the jerk pork is brilliant, one caveat tho its chopped up too small.
But how does this sound? Jerk pork poutine with oxtail gravy?  Really?  Too bad the rating here only goes to 5.  But you have to get there early as it runs out fairly quickly"}
{"text":"If you're willing to accept the absolute garbage and rude customer service, Tropical Joe just may have the best island foods in town."}
{"text":"Had the ox tail with rice / beans and the portion was plentiful and the food was great. Even better is that is located in the mall where you are guaranteed a seat."}
{"text":"I gotta say this place is now a mall court fast food place.  No longer cut chicken quarters in ur order.  Pre cooked boneless shit in your take out plastic shiny container. The nice guy that was out front may be gone. U got now this bitchy non interested employee that seems like fuck u and fuck ur order.  I mentioned I must have not been here in awhile and chicken different. She was like ya easier for roti. Then when I went to pay the stupid interact didn't work and I had to go to the CIBC beside it and paid $3. mentioned ur machine is not working and she again was a bitch and said it worked before u.  She was an employee before for the nice guy. And was a pig then.  I hope she reads this and understand that a smile and a bit of niceness goes a long way.  I love the tip cup. I should of took $3 for the bullshit I went through.  And the food was meh.  No longer a good place.   Just mall food."}
{"text":"I use to go to tropical joes after school all the time. They give students a discount and a large jerk poutine with a drink of your choice, it was pretty cheap! 
There are 3 different \"spice\" levels for the jerk poutine (mild, mix, spicy) I usually get mixed. 

I recently visited tropical joes again and the prices have changed (it's more expensive than I remember). They also no longer have Arizona to drink. The jerk potions however, stayed exactly the same, and it's GREAT!!!"}
{"text":"Hidden away in the corner of the food court of Gerrard Sq., this place is a true gem! Worth traveling out of your way for.
Try the stuffed patties. The soup is terrific!
The good news is that the owner is thinking about opening a full fledged restaurant, the bad news is he's thinking of opening it in Vaughn."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in Gerrard Square, worth the trip on its own. Great rotis with a nice hit of spice, melt in your mouth jerk and a good selection of Grace sodas."}
{"text":"This is the excellent restaurant, their poutine is the best, is better then any stores. The price is reasonable, and the food tastes good. So far, this is the first restaurant that I actually really like it"}
{"text":"They've seemed to have undergone some renovations recently and along with them some changes to their food.  I got their jerk chicken with rice and peas but instead of vegetables it came with coleslaw and curried potatoes.  The coleslaw was great in that it didn't have mayo in it (I hate mayo) but the potatoes were bland.  Since I already had rice And peas I felt that the amount of starch was overkill.   Furthermore the jerk chicken is now boneless.  It still tastes great but it tasted better before in my opinion.   On the other hand, it was definitely easier to eat.  And they still cram in a ton of food into your plate.  I still give them a thumb's up but I preferred the food before the changes."}
{"text":"4 stars  out of 4 four:

I found me some oxtail for lunch!

I wish though that I had more of that fall-off-the-bone oxtail meat that came with my rice and beans + curried potatoes.

Reasonably priced.

Friendly lady staff for a quick Brampton City Centre service."}
{"text":"This place makes me look forward to going to Gerrard Square. That's an accomplishment. I've only ever gotten 1 thing--the jerk chicken stuffed patty. Basically a giant jerk chicken sandwich on a patty instead of a bun. It's kinda messy to eat but delicious. I don't know about all these reviews saying they use processed boneless chicken--I got chopped dark meat. Tons of delicious free toppings, including these amazing spicy pickled onions. I always find the service on the friendly side of normal for a food court."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and experienced this place first hand many times. They seem to go to great effort to \"stack the reviews\" with friends. They now may be serving Jerk Rat? Maybe or maybe not I don't know to be fair. Pairs nicely with your Cosco meat patty. My opinion is this place continues on its downward spiral on many levels. They have switched their jerk chicken from acceptable real quarters with bone in to a boneless processed chicken possibly from China. Boneless chicken should be a concern everywhere. The latest news on boneless chicken from china is that it is mixed with rat meat. Millions of pounds are floating around and goes to the lowest bidder that has regard for quality. This place has already demonstrated that they do not care about you with their new black plastic non-recyclable food dishes and therefore they are likely buying the cheapest process chicken on the market which could be from China and possibly laced with rat meat (google it if you don't believe me). So do you want to risk Jerk Rat Meat? Apparently millions of pounds of rat meat is in circulation and they have no way of tracing it. This is fact. You should avoid boneless chicken everywhere not just here. We don't need government to legislate anything, we can take matters into our own hands and just not accept this and spend our dollars elsewhere. As for the service here, judge for yourself but they are the most unfriendly bunch I have ever seen in the service industry."}
{"text":"Love the curries! Value for the money. Husband and I really enjoyed everything. He had Jerk Chicken and it was fall off the bone tender and flavorful. I kept taking his pieces :) A friendly hard working girl at the counter serve it up with care. What else can u ask for?"}
{"text":"If you are looking for quick and cheap Caribbean food, this place should be your go to spot! They offer quite a few items and combos with varying meats such as but not limited to: beef, chicken, and goat. They also offer rice dishes and roti!

They are also well-known in the area for their Jerk Chicken Poutine for it's low price, generous servings, and delicious flavour.

Be warned - this location is very popular which in turn creates longer lines and wait times, especially if you visit the place during the afternoon as the surrounding high-school students flood the food court."}
{"text":"Customer relations is great, poor quantity size, quality in food is sad. Super expensive compared to what you get. Used to be great before change of management. (Before the renovation)"}
{"text":"Love this place! I would LOVE to give this place 5 stars if they would please change the rice from that parboiled stuff! Please for the love of Kanye change the rice!!!!!!! Say it with me..white rice, white rice, WHITE RICE! still love you though"}
{"text":"This place used to be so decent, but I think everyone here has stopped caring.  Just like my review.

(tear)"}
{"text":"Don't go here for the service or atmosphere, just the food.

Had the Large Jerk Roti and it was massive. Enough for 2 servings IMO. They really load up the filling and the chicken was boneless, so it was really easy to eat. Yum"}
{"text":"Jerk Poutine is incredible, would give it 6 out of 5 if they used curds. Get a large if you don't need to function within the next 24 hours. Just wish there was a better spot to park, I come here far too often and you've got to hike a bit into the mall."}
{"text":"I'm surprised Tropical Joe's in Woodside Square hasn't been listed on Yelp yet! They've been around for a while and has been my go-to for cheap Caribbean food. I can't comment on the authenticity but the portions, taste and flavour all deserves 4 stars! A 3 meat combo is $11 with a Grace Pop. I shared it between 2 people and we couldn't even finish the jerk chicken. I especially love their fall-off-the-bone ox tail! Remember to ask for extra ox tail sauce to drench the mountain of rice they give you."}
{"text":"Ok, ok, ok!  First, I have to point out, as others have, that the Gerard Square Mall, which houses Tropical Joe's, is such an incredibly strange little place.  I'll add here, that I'm pointing this out POST reno, so I can only imagine.  Seriously?  Where am I?!  However, I digress.  Let's examine the culinary offerings, now, shall we?  
  Tropical Joe's holds solid ground in the food court area of this kiosk mall.  And I love it.  Maybe not the healthiest dining option, however, the gluten free, super vegan, macro nutrient joints are not options under this roof.  Instead, I go here.  I've visited on a number of occasions, and it never ceases to delight that my food containers are repeatedly filled to the brim with various offerings.  At $6.50, yes, $6.50, out comes a full leg and then some of jerk chicken, rammed in, atop rice and peas, and some mixed veggies.  Crazy!  Crazy good.  A new favourite.  
  Other options include a various mix of roti, all full of flavorful curried chicken and potatoes, wrapped up in flaky roti shell.  Hot sauce, optional, yet, never forgotten.  One does not go hungry here.  
  Service is what one would expect from the venue, running the gambit of friendly to down right annoyed.  However, I don't go for the chit chat, and the smiles, I go for the grub. You follow?"}
{"text":"THE BEST FOOD EVER! Try the Jerk Poutine or if you are really hungry ROTI! I loved all the items, combos and of course my cream soda! I've tried other places, this place is real guyanese food from back home! Go hungry or if you are just looking for a snack, try 6 polories or 2 potatoe balls with Mango chutney & Pepper sauce. You will not be disappointed as the chef has a passion for cooking with a lot of love in his food!"}
{"text":"THE BEST CARIBBEAN FOOD YOU WILL EVER FIND AROUND THIS AREA! You will see that sizes are amazing, the atmosphere is friendly and again the food is 10++++. Ask for the daily specials and enjoy! Can't wait to get my Jerk Poutine!!! My FAVOURITE!"}
{"text":"awesome Jamaican food, roti, curries, patties, jerk. Every now and then I'd get the jerk chicken poutine.. My mouth is watering already"}
{"text":"Since D&D Roti closed down on Gerrard and Greenwood, the (south)east end has seriously been lacking for a Roti fix.  Enter Tropical Joe's.

I can't believe I hadn't heard about this place until recently. Oh wait, yes I can. It's tucked away in the back of the Gerrard Square food court. Seriously, other than procuring my Insane Clown Posse wardrobe, there would have been no other reason to stumble across this. But now you know and knowing is half the battle 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9UawGGWTg0

 The boneless goat roti is good but I found it to be a little too \"saucy\" and too  \"bayleafy\" (totally legitimate jargon. Look it up if you don't believe me.) for my liking. I believe this is more a regional thing so it's all up to your tastes. But the Channa, ohhh the Channa! Delicious and perfectly spiced. It's actually pretty hot and the fact that my friendly server asked if I wanted hot sauce made me question my manhood just a little."}
{"text":"One of the most flavourful curry goat I have had in awhile.  I was drawn right away by the aroma coming from the spot. It overpowered all the other food court places with its amazing spice filled aroma."}
{"text":"it is thanks to our neighbourhood that we have, within our food court, a carribean food option called tropical joes.  not that its any healthier than any other option perhaps, but ive been there a couple of times and i had a roti filled with goat and potatoes.

its a pretty healthy portion with a nice soft roti for about 5 bucks.  they microwave the roti first to, um, i dont know, soften it?  id definitely prefer everything without microwaves included, but hey its fast food.  

so they take a couple deep spoonfuls of a potato curry mixture coupled with a couple deep scoops of goat and dump it in the roti, make an attempt at folding it together and shut the styrofoam container and youre off.

the sauce was great, the meat very tender and lots of it, the potatoes well cooked and the curry accompanied by a little kick.  (you can get it spicier if you like).  there were these little flakes of some sort that appeared every so often on or around the roti and im not sure what they were.  it kind of looked like it was supposed to be there but who knows.  not being all that precious about it, i gobbled it up anyway.

nice alternate choice for mall grub is tropical joes."}
{"text":"Tropical Joe's is a Caribbean restaurant located in Sandhurst Circle. The menu offers so many different things from jerk chicken to fried chicken, beef curry, goat, roti, and even curry duck. 

Despite all of it, I wanted to go for jerk chicken and fried chicken to try. I got the combination that comes with rice and peas (opted for white rice) and oxtail gravy. The jerk chicken was pretty good. Though not as spicy as I wanted it to be, it was decent. The chicken was tender and fell off the bone pretty easily. The fried chicken was the same. Skin was thin and crisp while the meat also fell off the bone. I thought both chickens were a bit dry and bland, even with the pepper sauce. The rice with the oxtail gravy wasn't bad either, but again, could have used some more salt.

They have daily and lunch specials that come at killer prices. The portion sizes are huge and they don't skimp on the portion or the amount of sauce you want. The service was super friendly and the place is quick. Most items are on display via hot table so feel free to pick whatever looks the best."}
{"text":"One of the better mall food court picks for sure!  But the renovations seems to have made the veggies dissappear from the menu. So my last take out was channa roti (cant go wrong with this!) and Jerk chicken dinner, but the Jerk chicken dinner was on a bed rice and potatoes with slaw on the side. Not bad, but my boyfriend did enjoy the mixed vegetables more. Prices seem to be creeping up as well. But 2 dinners under $20 isn't terrible. :)"}
{"text":"Overall good food, portions are big. The rice is not the best but the jeri chicken was properly cooked and flavorful."}
{"text":"I really dislike food court food for some reason but I was starving and decided to check this place out as I'm a huge fan of Caribbean food.  Boy was I in for a huge surprise.  This place absolutely rocks.  My girlfriend and I got a roti and large jerk chicken.  Let's just say it was about two meals for the roti (it's absolutely massive and full of flavor).  Only downside is just ask for a little oxtail gravy on your jerk chicken otherwise they might flood it!

Love this place and now i'm going back whenever I get the chance!"}
{"text":"My Order: Ox tail & chowmein

PROS
+ food: it was very delicious. At first, I was a little skeptical with eating chinese noodles at a Carribean place. However, they do it well. The sauce adds a different ethnic flavor to a dish that I so commonly eat at home. They also pack the food into the container which is nice:) 
+ service: very nice and friendly staff. 

CONS
- payment: they only accept cash or debit."}
{"text":"Been going there for almost five years, there food is good but the owner and staff are completely rude!! Beyond rude that every time I go I think I don't want to give them my business, and for that reason I now only go when I absolutely need to. They have also become way overpriced for mall food. I use to go at least 3/4 times a month and now it's more like once every three months. I just don't want to give rude folk my business even though their food is good. As mentioned earlier, I was very loyal and always went there but they don't seem to appreciate loyalty. There is only one other place better then this and it's in Sheridan mall in north York. If everyone thinks this place is good wait till you try the jerk at carribean cuisine in Sheridan mall."}
{"text":"Jerk poutine?! C'mon!

This place servers it up hot and fresh, great food. Best patties around btw."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place often for their food.  I tried many items on their menu, including their rice and peas, roti, poutine and patty.  Their food has been consistent as they give a large portion of meat each time.  I usually get hot sauce on the side.  If you want another hot sauce, it costs $0.25 extra."}
{"text":"This is my favorite hole in the wall places. 
Delicious food and good portion sizes.
My go to dish is a mix of curry chicken AND jerk chicken together, on a bed of rice with lots of sauce, oxtail gravy and a few potatoes. A small portion of house coleslaw on the side. Voila!"}
{"text":"It's located in a food court inside a tiny mall BUT the food is amazing! You also get bang for your buck. I typically opt for the large roti with jerk chicken and it's so good - it's also boneless! It is enough for two people or two meals (reheating in the oven is A-Okay). Another great option is their poutine with jerk chicken. I'm usually the first to complain when there are no cheese curds in a poutine (they only use shredded cheese here) but the combination is so good that I don't really care. I usually get a large to share, it's definitely a meal for two people. You get a base of fries, topped with shredded cheese, then a generous serving of jerk chicken (it was shocking), then optional gravies and sauces (say yes to all of them) and optional hot sauce (I only ask for a bit of hot sauce - it's very hot). I've tried their spicy beef patty and it's just okay, I wish there was more filling."}
{"text":"i come to tropical joe's almost once a week. Their jerk chicken poutine is mouthwatering. They have two sizes: small & large. They also have three spice levels: mild, mix (a mix of mild and spicy) & spicy. To me, all three spice levels taste a little different. The mild is not spicy at all & has a little bit of a sweet taste to it, however it's kind of boring. While the spicy has a huge kick of jerk spice, which is kind of overpowering to me. i usually get mines mixed cause it's the best of both worlds and my spice tolerance is pretty low. The poutine is nice but the chicken in it is really bland.. the gravy is what makes the poutine the best out there. Everything about this restaurant is phenomenal, except for the fact that i come here every week & the SAME exact girl takes my order each time & she still has not remembered my order; i guess it's cause of all the faces she sees everyday, which is understandable. If you do not like bland chicken, like me lol, then i suggest you ask for \"cheesy fries\" instead of a \"jerk chicken poutine\". cheesy fries are the same as the jerk chicken poutine, except there's no chicken. You still get the jerk chicken gravy & all the same flavour. i have not tried anything else on their menu because the jerk chicken poutine keeps pulling me in lol.

PRICES:
small jerk chicken poutine/cheesy fries with a drink - $3.99 (i think)
large jerk chicken poutine/ cheesy fries with a drink - $5.99
extra cheese &/or extra gravy - $1.00
*the spice level/flavour does not change the price*
also, there is a 25cent charge to use the debit machine."}
{"text":"I like this place better than The Jerk.  Their portions are large, actually ginormous and so flavourful!  The jerk chicken isn't dry like it is at The Jerk and it's cheap!

I don't think people normally go to a mall just to eat in the food court, but I have gone to G Square to eat here intentionally a few times and for take-out a few times.

My west-indian friends have also given this place a thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Solid boneless jerk chicken no need for hot sauce it's plenty spicy (unless you're a spice fanatic). Soft curry potatoes a bit of Cole slaw and a ton of rice and peas rounds  out an awesome combo. $13.50 tax in with drink. 

Best food court meal I've had in a while."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced plate lunches within a neighborly older no frills shopping mall.  Surprising good tasty pre-made Caribbean food, jerk chicken is da bomb, what a gem of a find.  Great food, only thing missing is the beach sand, an ocean breeze, Bob Marley music and an extra strong rum fruit punch drink, hey mon pass the duchie"}
{"text":"This place is kind of a hidden gem like many others have mentioned, it was only discovered by my fellow colleagues whom recommended that I give it a try as I prefer to dine with poutine and let me tell you. Their jerk pork/jerk chicken poutine is great. They are all boneless and don't require a knife to do the dirty work, I just wish they used cheese curds over the packaged style mozzarella cheese. They also have other dishes that are very delicious. There are always a good line up and everyone is friendly and the portion size are pretty generous.
In their conventional oven warmer, you will see they have patties made by Allan's. Always delicious."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review as I'm eating their boneless curried chicken with rice and potatoes at Gerrard Square Food Court:

The taste of the chicken and rice is excellent, but the potatoes r a bit bland inside (flavour didn't sink in and get absorbed). I asked for a size small because it's already a big round container portion, and you do get a lot of food. The guy who served me was great. He asked me if I wanted hot sauce on the food I said no because I wasn't sure if I was gonna like it, but he gave me in a small container on the side for me to try.

However, I give them a 3 star instead of 4 because the girl at the cash register just did not give a f about customer service. She was taking her time, doing her own thing, talking to other employees and not paying attention to the customer. I told her I wanted to eat my food here before she was about to put my food in a plastic bag, and tilted over my hot sauce without even caring to pick it up.

Overall, it's a good place to go to if you are nearby and want some fast and tasty Jamaican food"}
{"text":"The best curried goat and jerk chicken that I've experienced in Toronto. And yes, my West Indian friends would agree.

The portions are usually substantial.

In fact, I'll be heading there in about 15 minutes for a small curried goat, half rice/peas and half veggies, with perhaps a little jerk gravy on the rice."}
{"text":"I used to come here back in high school all the time! It's affordable and yummy. 

As usual, I get the jerk poutine that consist of chicken, cheese, and fries. The sauce makes the ingredients bind together...which enhances the flavour of the chicken. 

Service may be a bit slow during lunch and after school!"}
{"text":"Had the most dry and tasteless goat roti there earlier today. The dhalpuri is not homemade or freshly store bought. The goat was decent enough. But the potatoes were massive for a roti. All pieces were about 4 inches around, otherwise known as way too big. Asked for medium spicy and got no spice at all.

So, in summary, 1 disappointing roti and a can of pop was $16. I've learned my lesson and will spend my money elsewhere from now on."}
{"text":"Ewwww...Gerrard Square. Tropical Joe's...yum. I had a small chicken roti and there was no way I could finish it all in one go. At first I was a little put off by the watery sauce and by the kind of thick, chewy roti skin, but the favour of the chicken made up for it.This was one tasty roti! I only wish I had asked for extra hot sauce because I didn't find it packed much of a punch. I would go back again."}
{"text":"Tldr: takeout Caribbean food. Tasty, cheap, great value. would recommend

Great place for  quick, delicious Caribbean style food. Tropical Joe's has been open for a while, and it's situated within the main food court at Woodside square as a takeout joint. They offer various options and combos with choices like: jerk chicken, curry (chicken, beef, goat), oxtail, and roti dishes. 

Used to come here often (still go occasionally), and i don't think it's on the menu, but i usually get the Jerk chicken poutine. They pack the box with a load of fries, jerk chicken, cheese curds, and gravy. Comes in a large size (with the option to make it to a combo w/pop for under $6) and a smaller size. The fries are ok, but what you're here for is the flavorful jerk chicken blending in with the creamy cheese and savoury gravy. If you do decide to get the poutine, get ready for insane cheese pulls and mad itus. From time to time i also get the 1 meat meal (chicken or beef), or the boneless beef roti. These options are pretty bomb too. 

The staff (one man and a woman) can sometimes look rude, and they're usually at the back (don't know what exactly what they're doing back there lol) and they come out when they see someone is waiting to order. But trust me, these guys are super nice, and they give you tons of food. The price here is amazing for the amount of food that you receive. Would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"My fiancé, his family and I have tried almost everything on the menu.. Best Caribbean food hands down! Portion sizes are proper too.. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Best option in Gerrard Square's food court.  Jerk chicken poutine is an odd dish but it is delicious. Most of the servers are young students who live in Leslieville so drop a twoonie in the tip cup"}
{"text":"The poutine over here is delicious. I love the poutine over here. I really would suggest y'all to go and check it out. Please."}
{"text":"My small Jerk Chicken ($5.50) was jammed full... 

- Chicken leg chopped up in pieces... (nice and moist and tender!)
- Pea with Rice (a little cold though.. but it is fast food!)
- Veggie medley (cabbage, broccoli and carrot, I need my veggie)
- Oxtail Sauce, Hot Sauce... (lady kept asking me if I want all these sauce)
- Big Smile and Thank You from the server

Good tasting and satisfying! 

The Large for $1 seems like a better deal... double the size..but definitely something to share!"}
{"text":"Honestly, 
I've been around to all the new/old jerk chicken joints in the area (beryl's pepper pot, the new real jerk, and hummingbird) and none of them come close to this taste. It's a little cheesy being in the gerrard food court but the food is worth it. There's usually a line up but the service is friendly and fast. The owner himself is a great person too. 
Lovin the trop joe!"}
